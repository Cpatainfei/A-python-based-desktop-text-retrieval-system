   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA REMOVES LAST HURDLE TO BOSNIA AIR STRIKES ; DIPLOMACY : MOSCOW WON ' T INSIST U.N. CHIEF SEEK SECURITY_COUNCIL APPROVAL . AMBASSADOR REQUESTS MEETING TO FIND OTHER WAYS TO DEMILITARIZE SARAJEVO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russia removed the last legal obstacle Thursday to the calling of air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina by U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali when it dropped its insistence that he seek new Security_Council approval before he acts . Russian Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov told reporters before he met with other ambassadors of the Security_Council that his government was not trying to prevent North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization planes from bombing Bosnian Serb positions . &quot; Who said that we are stopping anything ? &quot; he told a questioner . When asked about Boutros-Ghali ' s contention that he does not need any further approval from the council , Vorontsov surprised everyone by replying , &quot; The man is absolutely right. &quot; The Russian ambassador did present the other diplomats with a formal request from the Russian Foreign Ministry for an urgent meeting of the Security_Council &quot; to consider practical ways to demilitarize Sarajevo and to introduce there a United Nations administration. &quot; A demilitarized Sarajevo under U.N. administration is one of the proposals under_consideration at the Bosnian peace conference in Geneva . Many U.N. diplomats had feared that the Russian attempt to bring this issue before the Security_Council was an attempt to thwart any air strikes . But Vorontsov told reporters , &quot; It ' s complementary , not a substitute. &quot; Ambassador Roble Olhaye of Djibouti , who is president of the Security_Council this month , said the ambassadors had acceded_to the Russian request for a meeting , but only partly . The Security_Council had planned a public meeting today in which all U.N. members would be able to offer their views on Bosnia . Vorontsov was invited to discuss his proposal at_the_same_time . But Olhaye said that the Russians would not be allowed to introduce a resolution or call_for a vote at the meeting . With the Russian obstacle removed , Boutros-Ghali assumes the role of the key figure with the power to order air strikes in Bosnia should they prove necessary . U.N. diplomats said that , although the secretary_general has long been wary of such military_action , he has crossed a threshold and would have no hesitation about ordering air strikes now . There was some confusion at the United Nations , however , about the exact nature of the secretary_general ' s role . European diplomats said that Boutros-Ghali had the right to order air strikes both before and after the expiration of the 10-day ultimatum for the removal of Bosnian Serbs ' heavy_weapons from the_hills around Sarajevo . The strikes could be ordered before , the diplomats said , if artillery_fires on Sarajevo ; afterward , Boutros-Ghali could order the strikes to take_out the heavy_weapons that had not been removed . A senior French diplomat , however , described these orders as &quot; a shared initiative , &quot; implying that Boutros-Ghali would surely consult with NATO before ordering its planes into action . Any air strikes before the ultimatum expired would probably simply take_out the battery that had been firing , the European diplomats said . Boutros-Ghali would order each such air strike separately . But , the diplomats said , any order for air strikes that came_after the 10 days were over would amount to a general order for NATO to attack the emplacements at will , without waiting for approval from Boutros-Ghali for each air strike . The senior French diplomat nuanced this somewhat , saying that Boutros-Ghali would be consulted on each of these strikes and would have &quot; the power to prevent -- to say , ' Don ' t do it. ' &quot; To illustrate this scenario , the diplomat described a situation in which NATO pilots spotted a Serbian battery still firing . &quot; NATO will say , ' There are batteries . We have to take them out . Is it OK ? ' &quot; The diplomat said that Boutros-Ghali would surely approve unless he feared the air strikes would threaten the lives of U.N. peacekeepers or humanitarian workers . The French diplomat said that he believed that Boutros-Ghali would not object to this role . &quot; I don ' t think he will mind so_long as it ( the order for air strikes ) is done_in close coordination with the secretary_general , &quot; the diplomat said . Others doubted that the secretary_general would actually have any veto power , as there probably would be little time for him to stop the air strike once NATO had told him about it . Vorontsov told reporters that he believed Boutros-Ghali would never have to use his authority to order air strikes because the Bosnian Serbs would comply with the demand that they leave Sarajevo . Vorontsov ' s discussions with the Security_Council seemed much more moderate than the statements made earlier in the day in Moscow . &quot; Why should NATO decide the issues of a peace settlement , and what ' s more , by issuing ultimatums and threatening the use of force ? &quot; First Deputy Foreign Minister Anatoly Adamishin told the Interfax news_agency . &quot; This is not NATO ' s business . It is the United Nations ' business. &quot; Times staff writer Sonni Efron in Moscow contributed to this report .</TEXT>
