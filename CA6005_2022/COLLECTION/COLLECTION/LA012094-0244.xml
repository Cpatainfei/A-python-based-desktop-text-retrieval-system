   <HEADLINE> INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE : EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; HOW TO TURN THE TABLES ON DEVELOPING BETTER QUAKE BUILDING_CODES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Predicting earthquakes may be impossible ; minimizing their damage is not . Apartment complexes don ' t have to crumple ; critical freeway overpasses needn ' t collapse . If California and the country don ' t want to relive this week ' s destruction every time a major temblor roils the earth , it ' s time to invest in technologies that tell us how to build structures that are seismically safe_and_sound . While seismographs are terrific for charting the course of a quake , they ' re of little use in building quake-resistant highways and houses . A different tool is needed . Talk to the structural engineers and they ' ll tell you the most valuable data for designing and testing earthquake innovations doesn ' t come from sophisticated computer models of digitized earthquakes striking simulated structures , but from an aptly named device called a shake table . Shake tables shake ; they can be programmed to physically simulate the bucking and thrashing of earthquakes , real and imagined . The bigger the shake table , the larger the scale model of the structure that can be attached and tested . Design innovations , new materials , innovative construction techniques and even soil conditions can be effectively emulated on the appropriate shake table . What wind_tunnels have meant to the design and development of airplanes , shake tables can -- and should -- mean for building and retrofitting quake-proof structures . Our earthquake investment policies must now reflect that . &quot; What this country really lacks is a large enough shaking table , &quot; says Nicholas F . Forell of San Francisco-based Forell &amp; Ellseser , one of the country ' s leading earthquake engineering firms . &quot; The shaking tests that we ' ve done have been extremely revealing and helpful to us . Computer models are important for design , but even they need the empirical data that comes from the shaking tests. &quot; &quot; We could have made significant inroads and cut by a significant margin much of the damage that happened ( Monday ) if the engineering community relied more rigorously on shake table testing , &quot; says Jack Moehle , who directs the Earthquake Engineering Research_Center at University of California , Berkeley and is part of the teams investigating the freeway collapses . Astonishingly , there are fewer than five shake tables of any meaningful size in the entire country . The State University of New York at Buffalo has a 12-foot shake table ; the University of Illinois in Urbana , along with the Army Corps of Engineers , has two tables ; UC San Diego has a fairly crude one . The nation ' s largest shake table is at UC Berkeley ' s research_center . It ' s all_of 20 feet long . By contrast , says UC Berkeley structural engineering professor Stephen A . Mahin , Japan , which is very concerned about seismic design , has no fewer than 20 larger tables . In fact , the largest shake table in the world is_on the island of Shikoku off the east coast of Japan -- a 50-footer that was originally used to test the integrity of nuclear_power plant designs . &quot; We don ' t have the Japanese mentality to test everything that ' s possible before we build it , &quot; Mahin says , but he adds that recently the Berkeley center has done shake testing for a handful of private builders . Still , why don ' t insurance_companies insist on shake table tests for new building designs or for proposed seismic retrofits ? Why , for example , has the California Department_of_Transportation relied solely on static hydraulic tests for determining highway integrity , rather than pushing for shake table testing of scale models here in the United States or Japan ? Why aren ' t shake tables being used to figure_out low-cost ways to buttress and reinforce the higher-risk buildings in Southern California ? Why aren ' t the U.S. Department_of_Transportation and the Department of Housing and Urban Development working hand in_hand with California and the construction community to sponsor more shake table testing ? The answers lie as much in the politics and economics of funding as in any technical problems . For one thing , shake tables are still seen more as a research tool than as a vital testing medium and so are treated like discretionary academic Tinkertoys . For another , building and construction codes are written independently of the data that can be generated by shake tables -- even though , ironically , some of the computer simulations that shape the codes are drawn from shake table tests . According to Moehle , large shake tables can be built for less than $ 25 million , and the cost of maintaining them is not particularly high . Indeed , for less than 0.1 % of the cost of a space_station or a superconducting super collider , America can build devices that help assure that people ' s homes and highways are significantly safer . If a shake table test could have saved but one freeway this past Monday , it would have more_than paid_for itself . &quot; The earthquake engineering community has not organized well on this , &quot; Moehle acknowledges . &quot; We haven ' t gotten our act together ; it ' s nobody ' s fault but our own. &quot; That has to change . What ' s the point of being able to predict earthquakes if many of our key structures are not engineered well enough to survive them ? While shake table testing -- like wind_tunnels -- don ' t guarantee the safety or integrity of structures , it does offer a cost-effective way to boost their chances for soundness . As Los Angeles rebuilds from the rubble , it ' s essential that state and federal_governments recognize the critical importance of investing in testing . Without that investment , efforts to rebuild will merely be futile exercises in tempting fate .</TEXT>
