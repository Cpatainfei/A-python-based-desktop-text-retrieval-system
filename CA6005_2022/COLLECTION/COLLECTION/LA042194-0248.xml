   <HEADLINE> STUDY OFFERS HOPE OF KIDNEY_DISEASE TREATMENT ; MEDICINE : UCLA RESEARCHERS FIND THAT THE ANTI-CANCER DRUG TAXOL HALTS THE GROWTH OF DESTRUCTIVE CYSTS IN MICE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> UCLA researchers report that they have opened the door to what may be the first effective treatment for a devastating inherited kidney_disease that affects more_than 500 # 000 Americans . Working with mice with a naturally occurring form of the disease , called polycystic kidney_disease , the researchers have shown that the anti-cancer drug taxol can halt the growth of the cysts that cause the destruction characteristic of the disease . Compared to untreated mice with the disorder that died four to five weeks after birth , those that received the drug lived several months before they were sacrificed for study , according to the report , which appears today in the_British journal Nature . &quot; This is the first time that a medication has been given to an animal with polycystic kidney_disease that stopped the disease in its tracks , &quot; said Dr. Jared Grantham , a nephrologist at the University of Kansas Medical_Center and chairman of the Polycystic Kidney Research Foundation . &quot; that ' s a very significant achievement , and I ' m personally pretty excited about it. &quot; Physicians at UCLA hope to begin a multicenter clinical trial of the drug in humans within a year , according to UCLA molecular geneticist David Woo , head of the team that did the research . The path toward such a trial is a little smoother than usual , he added , because taxol is already approved for treatment of ovarian , breast and lung_cancers . Dr. William Bennett , a nephrologist at the Oregon Health Sciences University and chairman of the Polycystic Council of the National Kidney Foundation , cautioned that there are differences between the human and the mouse forms of the disease . Nonetheless , he said , &quot; It is very encouraging that there is something that will do this ( stop the disease ) . &quot; Even if taxol proves not to be the best drug for humans , he said , &quot; this will give us a lot of clues to help us find others. &quot; Polycystic kidney_disease occurs in approximately one out of every 800 people . Victims are born with thousands of microscopic cysts in their kidneys . These cysts accumulate fluid and grow in size over three to five decades , eventually destroying the kidney . In the last stages , patients require kidney dialysis to clean waste_products from their blood and kidney transplants , at a yearly cost to Medicare of more_than $ 750 million . There is no known treatment that can halt progression of the disease . Most therapy is of a supportive nature that limits infections and includes dietary restrictions that minimize the accumulation of noxious byproducts . The mouse model used by Woo is actually like a more severe form of the disorder , called infantile recessive polycystic kidney_disease . This form strikes only about one in 16 # 000 people , but is much more devastating because it progresses extremely rapidly , usually causing death before the age of 20 . But , Woo said , &quot; there is no reason to believe that the pathogenesis of the slower form of the disease is any different from the more severe form , &quot; a view that is echoed by Grantham and Bennett . German scientists have recently developed a rat model of the more common form of the disease . Woo did not work with it originally because studies with rats are substantially more expensive than those with mice , but he is planning new studies to determine whether taxol will work in this model as well . Taxol was originally isolated from the bark of the Pacific_yew tree and was initially in short supply because of the difficulties of obtaining enough bark to process . But drug_companies have successfully devised techniques to isolate it from needles and branches of related shrubs , and currently there is no shortage of the drug .</TEXT>
