   <HEADLINE> UNWILLING FIGHTER IN WAR ON SECONDHAND SMOKE ; HEALTH : ROSITA GARCIA SAYS SHE GOT CANCER AS WAITRESS IN A BAR . BUT EX-EMPLOYER HAS FOUGHT OFF WORKERS ' COMP CLAIM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rosita Garcia never wanted to be a poster girl for the fight against tobacco . But here she is , living testimony in the debate over the dangers of secondhand smoke : the cocktail waitress who never touched a cigarette but got lung_cancer after 11 years of serving drinks_in the blue haze of a smoky airport bar . This is not how she wants to be remembered . At 39 , she is a very private woman , a former fitness buff ( she quit exercising when the cancer was discovered ) who hates to be thought of as being_sick . She does not look sick ; there is color_in her cheeks , her dark eyes are bright , her waistline is_full -- a sign that she is again eating well . Yet the evidence is there , if one looks close enough . She wears her reddish-brown hair in a pixie cut , not by design but by necessity -- it is just growing back after chemotherapy and radiation . With every few sentences , she lets_out a sputtering cough . Lately , she says , her chest has been hurting . Sometimes , she must excuse herself to vomit . The coldest proof of all sits in the medical file that Garcia keeps_in the closet of her tiny government-subsidized apartment in Daly City , a working-class suburb just south of San Francisco . Although her disease , diagnosed nearly three years ago , is confined to a single lung and is not getting_worse , neither is it getting better . Her tumors , reduced to scar tissue by radiation , may recur . Her oncologist says she is lucky to have survived . Her prognosis : Fair . Garcia rarely looks in the file . She does not want to think_about what it says . &quot; I don ' t believe that , &quot; she says optimistically . &quot; I think I ' m getting better. &quot; Garcia ' s plight provides a snapshot of the human side of the emotional secondhand smoke debate . Last year , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency declared secondhand smoke a human carcinogen , saying that it causes 3 # 000 lung_cancer deaths a year . Health advocacy groups put the annual total death toll at 53 # 000 from secondhand smoke , including deaths from various forms of cancer as well as heart_disease . Despite these figures and several hundred scientific studies documenting the ill effects of secondhand smoke , the tobacco_industry counters with research showing that it is little more_than a nuisance . As a consequence , Garcia and others who count themselves as its victims must battle not only disease , but also skeptics . For Garcia , the fight comes_with a price_tag : $ 26 # 889 . That is the cost of her medical_care . She is seeking this amount , plus her weekly wages , in a workers ' compensation suit that is languishing in the bureaucracy while she lives_on disability_checks of $ 600 a month . Her former employer , Host Marriott , which operates the bars where Garcia worked for more_than a decade , thus far has successfully fought the claim , saying Garcia did not get sick at_work . At the San Francisco airport , a handful of Garcia ' s former colleagues have waged a losing battle to clean the barroom air . Ironically , the airport has won plaudits for its aggressive anti-smoking policy ; in 1991 , it became the first airport in the nation to ban tobacco in all public places -- with one notable exception : bars . For the next two years there was nowhere else for smokers to go . Then in 1993 , the airport began installing ventilated smoking_rooms . Although airport officials could have banned tobacco in the bars , they left that decision to Host Marriott , which after a trial ban chose to permit it . The reason ? Economics . Bars lose money when patrons cannot smoke . Customers complained . Tips got so low that even the bartenders -- many of whom say the smoke makes them sick -- asked to have smoking back . &quot; No smoking did not go_over well , &quot; said Nancy Wood , a Host Marriott official . &quot; We had a very hard_time explaining to our client base , which is largely international travelers , why they couldn ' t smoke in the bar. &quot; &quot; It was a total fight in anger and futility , &quot; said Elizabeth Voigt , a friend of Garcia and former airport bartender . Voigt says she also is a victim of secondhand smoke , but unlike Garcia , she does not trace her illness solely to tobacco . Like many victims , she has an underlying medical disorder -- a heart_condition -- that is exacerbated by secondhand smoke . She has developed a phrase for herself : &quot; I am , &quot; she says , &quot; a disabled American who cannot be around secondhand smoke. &quot; Voigt is recovering from heart_surgery at Stanford_University Hospital . Although Host Marriott officials say they went_to great lengths to accommodate her -- installing ventilation and a separate time_clock in a smoke-free area -- Voigt complains that passengers and airline employees are protected while she and other bartenders are not . &quot; I am not a human_being ? &quot; she asks , her voice laced with sarcasm . &quot; I don ' t have a heart ? I don ' t have lungs ? &quot; * The struggle at the San Francisco airport typifies a nationwide wrestling_match over the issue of secondhand smoke . While more workplaces are banning tobacco use , in restaurants , bars and other quarters , matters of health collide_with matters of money . Money often wins . Moreover , what is sufficient proof for the medical Establishment may_not be good_enough in a courtroom , as Garcia ' s faltering workplace injury claim reveals . The case , which is hung_up on a technicality , pits the word of a noted researcher -- who says Garcia ' s lung_cancer was caused by secondhand smoke -- against the word of a Host Marriott doctor , who says it was not . Nationwide , there have been dozens of lawsuits and workers ' compensation cases filed by victims of secondhand smoke , including a recent $ 650-million wrongful death suit filed against tobacco manufacturers by the heirs of a Mississippi barber . Although no one is tracking the results , there have been some victories , particularly in California , which has long been considered a leader in the anti-smoking movement . Esther Schiller , a former Los Angeles teacher whose lungs were so damaged by secondhand smoke that she has difficulty talking , won $ 29 # 999 after a workers ' compensation judge found that smoke from a teachers lounge had drifted into her classroom and left her disabled . She now coordinates a statewide network of secondhand smoke victims . Avatar Ubhi is a 58-year-old San Francisco Bay Area waiter who had a heart_attack after years of working in a smoky restaurant . He won a $ 90 # 000 settlement shortly after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency released preliminary data deeming secondhand smoke a human carcinogen . He now owns a smoke-free restaurant in Sausalito . But for every Schiller and Ubhi , anti-smoking advocates say , there is a Garcia -- a victim who fights and gets nowhere , or worse , one who is afraid to fight at all . &quot; There are many , many_more ( victims ) , &quot; said Juliette Linzer , project director at one of the Bay Area affiliates of the American Lung Assn . After learning of Garcia ' s case , Linzer won a $ 40 # 000 state grant last year to create a group called BREATH -- Bar and Restaurant Employees Against Tobacco Hazards . But the group , which hoped to change smoking policies , met with little success ; bartenders and waiters are often afraid that if they speak out , they will be fired . &quot; I just got a call from somebody at a casino in Nevada who told me that she ' s the only one who is willing to speak_up and say anything , and she ' s scared for her job , &quot; Linzer said . &quot; She told me that all_of her co-workers face what she does -- they have trouble breathing , they have shortness of breath , sinus problems , headaches and dizziness , and on days when they don ' t work , they don ' t experience these symptoms. &quot; * To Rosita Garcia , this is a familiar , painful tale . Her father always warned her about cigarettes . She came_to San Francisco from the Philippines to live with him when she was 16 . He was a smoker , but never around his children . Although smoking never made him sick -- and there is no history of cancer in the Garcia family -- David Garcia begged his children not to pick_up his unhealthful habit . Often , he would show them pictures of lungs blackened by years of smoke . Young Rosita got the message . She left home at 18 . After a series of jobs -- waitressing at Woolworth ' s , assembling yo-yos , working as a nurse ' s aide -- she was hired by Host Marriott . This was 1980 , and nobody was thinking much about secondhand smoke . Garcia was 24 . She was jogging and doing aerobics . She thought she was in great health , despite the incessant headaches that came_on at_work . Anyway , the money was too good to leave -- about $ 100 a day including tips . Often , she would joke with her smoking customers . &quot; I ' ll probably catch cancer , &quot; she would say . The first sign that something was wrong came_in the summer of 1991 . The airport had gone smoke-free a_few months earlier . For the 31 # 000 workers and 88 # 000 travelers who pass_through each day -- the majority of them nonsmokers -- the policy made San Francisco International a much nicer place . For cocktail waitresses , the new rule created an ironic backlash ; it made dirty air even dirtier by driving smokers into the bars . At night , a hacking , dry cough kept her awake . The first attack came_on the afternoon of Aug . 8 , as she was working her regular 4 p.m. to midnight shift at the Hub Bar , one of the airport ' s busiest . &quot; It felt_like there was a bubble inside my right chest and it just burst. &quot; The doctor said it was pneumonia . After two weeks of antibiotics and coughing_up sputum streaked with blood , she went_back to the hospital . As she was waiting for an X-ray , it happened again . Her chest hurt so_much that she thought it was a heart_attack . There were more tests -- X-rays , bronchoscopy ( in which the doctors threaded a tube through her nose to examine her lungs ) , and then a biopsy . Chemotherapy and 37 consecutive days of radiation treatment lay ahead . On Sept . 24 , 1991 , the doctor called . She talked medical talk : squamous_cell_carcinoma , a right hilar mass extending into the mediastinum . Garcia ' s head was swirling . &quot; The only words I understood were : ' So we will call it cancer . You have cancer. ' &quot; * In a bare-walled government_office in the San Francisco Civic Center , the details of Garcia ' s disease and treatment are revealed in a three-inch-thick sheaf of paperwork , Workers ' Compensation Case SFU O360532 . Here , dueling medical_reports -- each buttressed by scientific_research -- debate the cause of Garcia ' s lung_cancer . The risk of a nonsmoker getting lung_cancer is 1 in 250 , far lower than the 1-in-8 risk for a smoker , according to Lawrence Garfinkel , a consultant to the American Cancer Society . And of all diseases that may be caused by secondhand smoke , the link to lung_cancer is most firmly established . But , Garfinkel notes , &quot; any one case is hard to prove. &quot; The key question for Garcia , in the cumbersome language of state bureaucrats , is whether her disability is &quot; the result of occupation , either as an industrial accident or as an occupational disease. &quot; The answer ? Yes , said Dr. Christine Angeles , the Kaiser Permanente physician who first treated Garcia . Angeles based her conclusion on Garcia ' s account that she had been exposed to excessive secondhand smoke at_work . No , said Dr. Irene Danse , who was hired by Host Marriott lawyers to examine Garcia . Noting that Garcia is Filipino , Danse wrote in her report that Asian women , &quot; for some reason that has not been defined , &quot; seem prone to lung_cancer . Citing a study that found Garcia ' s workplace exposure to be equivalent_to smoking one cigarette per day , Danse concluded : &quot; I cannot link her lung_cancer to her job. &quot; To counter that assertion , Garcia ' s lawyer hired Stanton A . Glantz , professor of medicine at UC San Francisco and one of the nation ' s most respected researchers on the issue of secondhand smoke . Glantz reviewed Garcia ' s medical_records . He found that she had only incidental exposure to secondhand smoke at_home , that she had no exposure to other toxic agents -- such_as asbestos or radon -- that might have caused her cancer . He dismissed the study Danse cited as flawed and said she had ignored &quot; large and compelling scientific literature. &quot; Garcia ' s cancer , he concluded , was caused &quot; in major part , by her exposure to environmental tobacco smoke at her place of employment. &quot; But there was a problem with Glantz ' s report . He is a Ph.D. , not a medical doctor , and he never examined Garcia . So Host Marriott persuaded a workers ' compensation judge to strike his testimony . The judge also ruled that it was too late for Garcia to be examined by a medical doctor . That was in March , 1993 , and the question of whether Glantz will be permitted to testify has lingered on appeal . Without Glantz , Garcia ' s lawyer says , he has no case . Tom McBirnie , a staff attorney for the Workers ' Compensation Board , suspects that Garcia ' s claim has been delayed in part because workers ' compensation law is not equipped to deal with the emerging science of secondhand smoke . &quot; What we basically see , &quot; McBirnie said , &quot; are bad backs and stress claims. &quot; In his small , cluttered office at Moffitt Hospital , Glantz grows furious when he talks_about the judge ' s ruling . Leaning_back in his chair , he shakes his curly mop of gray hair , says he does not understand how any doctor can be allowed to examine Garcia and render an &quot; expert opinion , &quot; while his words , based on a career of research , do not count . &quot; It ' s outrageous ! &quot; he thunders . &quot; A cheap procedural trick. &quot; * Not much has changed at the San Francisco airport since Garcia served her last drink nearly three years ago . The fight over secondhand smoke in the bars is pretty much over . One bar went smoke-free after airline employees complained , and the bartenders who work there say they are losing money . If anyone is carrying_on Garcia ' s legacy , it is Michelle Barron . She is the sole bartender in a tiny cocktail_lounge , a peach-and-burgundy place where double screwdrivers can be had for a dollar extra , and she is surreptitiously waging her own war on smokers . Although smoking is permitted in her bar , she has plastered it with no smoking signs . Her bosses have made_peace with her by looking the other way . On a recent Wednesday morning , a passenger in khakis and a golf_cap came_into her bar and ordered a gin_and_tonic . &quot; There ' s no smoking anywhere around here , is there ? &quot; he asked . &quot; No , &quot; Barron said simply , and that was that . In fact , there is smoking down the hall , in one of four new glass-enclosed smoking_rooms that resemble smoky fishbowls . One airport official said he spent 30 minutes inside one &quot; and my throat was scratchy for the next three days. &quot; The rooms are not a big hit with smokers . &quot; This , &quot; said one , &quot; is exactly like people felt when they were forced to sit in the back of the bus. &quot; But this is the balance the San Francisco airport has struck -- a balance that tips largely in favor of nonsmokers , yet still fails to protect everyone . Other airports , including Memphis , Tenn. , and Dallas-Ft . Worth , have gone completely smoke-free , and Los Angeles International Airport is planning to do the same . But from his corner office , with a sweeping view of the runways , the airport ' s general_manager , a frenetic engineer named Louis Turpen , says more restrictions in San Francisco are not likely anytime soon . &quot; Is it perfect ? &quot; he asks . &quot; No , it is not perfect . But I think we have done_it as well as it can be done. &quot; As for Garcia , she spends her days visiting with friends and family , reading her collection of medical texts and investigating various alternative remedies to improve her health . She has tried tree bark juice and herbal treatments , even capsules containing ground-up shark cartilage , which is being hawked by a doctor on the theory that &quot; sharks don ' t get cancer. &quot; She would like someday to return to work -- not as a cocktail waitress , but perhaps in health_care . Her dream of becoming a nurse seems beyond reach -- she does not have the money for school -- but she has enrolled in an eight-month course to become a medical technician . She starts June 13 , and is hoping that school will mark a new beginning . She misses her aerobics , and being able to go_out dancing and partying with friends , but she sounds upbeat . &quot; I ' m a very happy person , very happy , &quot; she says . &quot; Right now , I live every day and I don ' t have to worry that I have to go_to work and face the smoking world. &quot; Deadly Consequences Epidemiologists -- people who study patterns of disease -- estimate that secondhand smoke claims 53 # 000 lives each year , including 3 # 000 from lung_cancer and as_many as 40 # 000 from heart_disease .
