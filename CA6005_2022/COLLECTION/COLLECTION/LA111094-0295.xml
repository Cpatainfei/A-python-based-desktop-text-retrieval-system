   <HEADLINE> SRI LANKAN PREMIER WINS PRESIDENCY , PARTIAL RESULTS SHOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Apparently looking_for a peaceful way to end a long-running ethnic uprising , Sri Lankans on Wednesday entrusted the country ' s supreme office to their novice prime_minister , who has pledged to abolish the job by the summer , partial returns showed . In an election that pitted two political widows against one other , the first results showed Prime_Minister Chandrika Kumaratunga winning more_than 59 % of the vote for the executive presidency . Opponent Srima Dissanayake beat her in only one locality , the early results showed . Kumaratunga would be the first woman to hold the presidential post in Sri Lanka . Immediately after polls closed , Dissanayake seemed resigned to losing , but claimed that she had been the victim of widespread vote-rigging . Members of Kumaratunga ' s People ' s Alliance , or the PA , forecast a landslide win that they said would be a popular mandate to resume talks with Tamil rebels . &quot; If she ' s elected with an overwhelming majority , it endorses her peace policies , &quot; Housing Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said . Kumaratunga broke_off groundbreaking contacts she had initiated with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam after the assassination last month of Dissanayake ' s husband by a suicide bomber , a terrorist technique associated with the insurgents . Srima Dissanayake , 51 , a lawyer , was then named by the United National Party to replace her murdered spouse as the opposition ' s top candidate . For reasons of safety , she campaigned only through the media . She denounced as naive Kumaratunga ' s willingness to talk unconditionally to the Tigers . Fearing that a bitter , violence-marred campaign could mean trouble on election_day , police put more_than 40 # 000 officers on special duty . But clashes were reported at more_than 100 polling_stations . Two of Srima Dissanayake ' s supporters were reportedly stabbed to death , and a third was knifed but not killed . More_than 100 people were arrested . The government proclaimed an island-wide curfew to prevent more violence or settling of political accounts . But Kumaratunga ' s supporters defied the curfew , setting_off firecrackers in the streets to celebrate her expected victory . Dissanayake accused her opponent ' s party of stuffing ballot_boxes and intimidating voters . She blamed the alleged harassment from the PA for an estimated turnout of 60 % -65 % , low by Sri Lankan standards . Final returns are not expected until today . For many voters , the election was a plebiscite on the first contacts in four years between the government and the Liberation Tigers , a group that for 11 years has fought to establish a separate Tamil homeland on this Indian_Ocean island . More_than 30 # 000 people have been killed in the conflict . &quot; Everything depends_on what the outcome of these peace talks is , &quot; Colombo schoolteacher T.M.I. Mutaliph said . &quot; Everyone is looking_forward to peace . The prosperity of the country , its stability -- all_of this depends_on ending this ongoing war. &quot; Kumaratunga , 49 , whose mother and father both served as prime_minister , has repeatedly assured voters that if elected , she will work to abolish the executive presidency , which was created in 1978 . That powerful post concentrates too_much power in the hands of one person , Kumaratunga has said . She said by July she will work to amend the constitution to restore the British-style parliamentary system Sri Lanka once had .</TEXT>
