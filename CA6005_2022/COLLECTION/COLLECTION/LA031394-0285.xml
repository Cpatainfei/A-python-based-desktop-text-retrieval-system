   <TEXT> &quot; Does_it trouble you , Mikhail Timofeyevich , that your creation has killed so many people around the world ? &quot; The kind-eyed old gentleman had heard the question before . Clearly , he has even put it to himself at times , in those long winters hidden away in the Russian heartland . &quot; All I can say , &quot; he replied , &quot; is that terrorists would have found something else to kill people with , even if there weren ' t my Kalashnikovs. &quot; Forget Clinton . Forget Yeltsin . Forget Marx and Mohammed . For the gun boys of Somalia and the old_boys of Vietnam , for the gangs of Los Angeles and the grunts of Bosnia , the name that matters is the name whose parts -- kah-LASH-nik-OFF -- s nap and click into place like a fresh magazine of high-velocity ammunition . Mikhail T . Kalashnikov , still cherub-cheeked if silver-haired at 74 , was almost a boy himself , age 23 , when he began designing the assault_rifle they eventually dubbed the AK-47 -- &quot; Avtomat Kalashnikova 1947. &quot; If , as Mao said , power grows from the barrel of a gun , this was the gun . In 40 years as the standard issue for Soviet-bloc forces , as the weapon of choice for guerrillas from ' Nam to Nicaragua , as the everyday tool of terrorists , perhaps 50 million copies of the &quot; AK , &quot; its descendants and clones have been produced in almost a dozen countries . Rugged , dependable , cheap and 600-rounds-a-minute lethal , the no-frills Kalashnikov is history ' s most widely distributed piece of killing machinery , the curve of its &quot; banana &quot; clip familiar to generations of TV news viewers . And over the years it has done great damage , a toll that weighs_on its creator . This Siberian peasant ' s son has told friends , for instance , that he sometimes wishes he had become an agricultural engineer instead of a weapon designer . Last year , he said publicly he wanted to establish a &quot; fund for gunshot victims. &quot; When asked about the fund in an interview , he was interrupted by Elena , his daughter and traveling companion . That impractical idea was &quot; a mistake , &quot; she said . Kalashnikov , offering no further explanation , moved_on to another concern , his longtime hometown , Izhevsk , a city of a half-million people in the highlands west of the Ural Mountains . Izhevsk was a major Soviet arms-manufacturing center , a &quot; closed city &quot; where Kalashnikov ' s design team worked over the years to improve the AK-47 for the giant Izhmash defense enterprise . Now , he said , &quot; these are very bad times. &quot; &quot; In our region , everyone was in the military business . Now that there ' s not such a demand , people are losing their jobs at Izhmash . It ' s a mess. &quot; Kalashnikov feels the pinch himself , not having been showered with royalties like U.S. gun designers . &quot; But the government was never against giving me medals , &quot; he joked . The hard-pressed local arms plants have hit on a Western-style marketing inspiration , capitalizing on the great designer ' s name by forming something called &quot; The Kalashnikov Joint Stock Co. &quot; The shareholders are all old state enterprises . In a telephone_interview from Izhevsk , an Izhmash deputy director , Alexander G . Likhachev , explained that the new company is gearing_up for an export push . He threw_in a pitch for Kalashnikov rifles : &quot; They ' re highly reliable and have a long service life . . . . They are better than , say , similar American products. &quot; But Kalashnikov himself seems out of the corporate loop . He thought his namesake company had never gotten_off_the_ground . Then again , he acknowledged with a laugh , he has no head for business . &quot; I ' m just a designer. &quot; It ' s evidence of the confusion that reigns as Russians try to reorganize their post-Soviet economy . The looser times at least have set the old designer loose to see the world , including America , where he was interviewed while attending a recent gun show in Dallas . &quot; They really kept him prisoner all those years , &quot; said American friend and host Berge Boghossian , an arms dealer who calls Kalashnikov &quot; the sweetest man on earth. &quot; Emerging from his shell means facing questions , however , about sharing responsibility for a violent world . And that means retelling the story of the AK-47 ' s origins : In 1941 , tank commander Kalashnikov was wounded in a battle with Russia ' s German invaders . In the hospital , other wounded men complained of their army ' s deficit in infantry weapons -- ancient bolt-action rifles versus the Germans ' modern firearms . Sgt . Kalashnikov , a clever mechanic , decided to spend his recuperation building a machine_pistol like the Germans ' . His pistol was never put into service , but it established him as a weapons maker . In 1943 he competed with other designers on Russia ' s first assault_rifle -- a weapon firing light rounds at a rapid rate , and also capable of single-round semiautomatic fire . When they dragged the Kalashnikov weapon through swamp water and it still fired , he was_on his way . The moral of the AK-47 story : &quot; I built it to protect my country. &quot; Today , Kalashnikov still designs weapons , but only hunting rifles . &quot; I ' m not going_to work_on any more military things , &quot; he said . Has he sworn_off man-killing devices ? The cheerful old father of famous guns hesitated and smiled . &quot; No , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s just that , into the next century , nothing is going_to be made better than my rifle anyway. &quot;</TEXT>
