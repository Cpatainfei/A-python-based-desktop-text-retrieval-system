   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; A GAMBLE TO REFORM THE LAPD ; ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT VAGUE , COMMUNITY POLICING IS SLOWLY UNFOLDING . IS IT AN OVERRATED CONCOCTION OR THE NECESSARY STEP TOWARD REFORM ? SOUTH BUREAU IS THE PROVING GROUND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To Los Angeles neighborhoods where crime has shredded the social order , now comes community-based policing -- an idea that is at once disturbingly vague , tantalizingly hopeful and eagerly embraced by people with vastly different notions of what it entails . To Ping Own , a Taiwanese immigrant with an auto service center near Los Angeles Harbor , it means clearing out the day_laborers who gather on the curb outside his business and scare_away his customers . To Cleve Freeman , it ' s using the police advisory_board he heads to clean_up a trio of dilapidated houses that have become embroiled in South-Central ' s drug trade . To police_officers such_as Margaret Mazotta or Keith Thomas , it is a near-endless meeting -- convened in parking_lots and living rooms , diners and doughnut shops -- where residents lay out their concerns and ask_for the Los Angeles Police_Department ' s help in solving them . And to the institution of the LAPD , community-based policing may be the last best hope for recapturing the public_trust shattered by the beating of Rodney G . King , broken again by the response to the 1992 riots , and only recently on the mend . Yet , despite the enormous stakes , community-based policing remains more of an ideal than a program . It is slowly unfolding across the city , and in South Los Angeles -- where a newly assigned deputy chief publicly introduced his version early this year -- it faces its greatest test . It is a work_in_progress , winning accolades despite its vague outlines and encountering resistance from some officers who worry that it distracts from the hard business of law_enforcement . Some residents also are skeptical , unconvinced that the LAPD will recast itself in a friendlier image . LAPD officials take every opportunity to proclaim that the effort is genuine . Although Police_Department leaders and law_enforcement scholars draw_up the plans , street cops and residents ultimately will be the ones who carry it out . The success or failure of community-based policing in their neighborhoods , particularly in South Los Angeles , will decide whether the idea is an overrated concoction that leaves Los Angeles even more vulnerable than it is or an overdue reform that restores a measure of peace . Nearly six years ago , when Edward Dabbs came_to the Normandale Recreation Center_on Halldale Avenue near 224th Street , he found a community program in crisis . Gang members from the neighborhood would congregate at the center , drinking malt_liquor and smoking marijuana around the building . Graffiti covered the walls . Broken glass littered the grounds . Frightened residents stayed away . In those days , Dabbs had little company and lots of work . &quot; My first week here , all I did was paint out graffiti , &quot; Dabbs said . &quot; They had covered every wall with graffiti , and they were started on the sidewalks. &quot; Conventional policing had failed the Normandale center . Police responded when the center was burglarized or its windows were smashed , but officers can only spend so_long at a crime scene . When they left , crime crept back inside . * One aim of community-based policing is to approach problems differently , to focus_on preventing crime rather than simply arresting criminals . In this case , that job fell to Margaret Mazotta , a personable , tough , 10-year veteran who nimbly juggles two roles -- social_worker and street cop . As she travels around what the department calls her Basic Car Area -- a long , narrow band of Los Angeles that runs from Palos Verdes Drive North to 190th Street -- Mazotta pauses to chat with merchants and homeowners . She calls_out to a minister and drops_by a schoolyard to hear how various students are doing . Children who know Mazotta come running_up to her car when she stops -- they know from experience that she is a reliable source of baseball_cards and balloons . But she is not shy about mixing it up either . When during a recent tour_of_duty a call came_over the radio about a possible attempted kidnaping , she set_down her coffee , said a quick goodby to a_couple_of neighbors and sprinted to her car . And when she spotted a group of idlers gathering near Ping Own ' s auto center , she did not hesitate to challenge them . One of the men , hurrying to get_away , darted across the street . She cited him for jaywalking , explaining the violation in Spanish . &quot; I am an immigrant too , &quot; said Own , his voice tight with frustration , as the men shuffled off . &quot; But these men , they scare my customers . They ruin my business . that ' s why I need the Police_Department to help , to save my business. &quot; Faced with the stubborn problems at the Normandale center , Mazotta blended soft_touch and stern resolve . She corralled other officers from the Harbor Division to increase patrols . She organized anti-graffiti efforts and trash cleanups . She took a_few of the children at the center under her wing . When she enters these days , they come running_up to her for advice and a hug . Gradually , the center recovered . Once-fearful elderly people now drop_by for senior programs . On Easter , roughly 300 children scrambled for eggs as a sea of parents dressed in their Sunday_best looked_on . On a recent Tuesday morning , the only sounds were of thumping basketballs and a_few squeals of laughter from tiny children on swings . The walls were clean , not a trace of graffiti . Mazotta ' s work_at the center has solved few crimes and resulted in few arrests , the goals of traditional policing . But residents of the neighborhood say Mazotta ' s efforts have given them a community_center , made them feel safer in their homes and happier in their lives . &quot; We ' ve taken this park back , &quot; Mazotta said . &quot; If we can do that , we ' ve not only served the community , we ' ve protected it as well. &quot; * As LAPD officials try to develop a coherent plan for community-based policing , they sometimes convey the impression of religious_leaders struggling to remember what was written_on the lost tablets of their faith . In the 1970s , then-Chief Ed Davis founded Neighborhood Watch , a rudimentary form of community-based policing , and also something known as the &quot; basic car plan. &quot; Each of those programs -- distant relatives of the_British bobby system founded in 1829 -- emphasized crime prevention and stressed community contact over arrests and incarceration . Davis ' approach was de-emphasized by his successor , Daryl F . Gates . Although he initiated some community-based efforts , Gates built a Police_Department far more military in its bearing and its relationship with the community . The emphasis shifted to a tougher style of law_enforcement . The vestiges of Davis and his community-oriented department gradually receded from memory . Then came the police beating of King , the Christopher Commission inquiry , the riots and the departure of Gates . He was succeeded by Willie L . Williams , an enthusiastic proponent of community-based policing who arrived from Philadelphia armed with a mandate to return the LAPD to its roots , to the programs that Davis pioneered two decades ago . Some of the LAPD ' s initial efforts to rekindle the spirit of community-based policing have been halting . At one point last year , the department sought to change the LAPD ' s fabled slogan , &quot; To protect and to serve , &quot; to one police leaders thought might be more suited to the new mission . The proposed slogan : &quot; To protect and to serve our communities . &quot; Some officers chuckled over that suggestion , privately deriding it as a cosmetic change that did little to address the challenges of retooling the department . Williams withdrew the proposal . On the streets , meanwhile , community policing was taking_shape in the San Fernando Valley where , until recently , Deputy Chief Mark A . Kroeker served as the top LAPD official . Late last year , Kroeker was transferred to the South Bureau -- a sprawling , hard-to-manage area of Los Angeles that encompasses scores of neighborhoods from the tidy homes of San Pedro to some tough neighborhoods in South-Central . The Valley has its trouble spots , but the police administration views South Bureau as a far more difficult challenge . That part of the city is home to the city ' s highest crime_rates and the greatest tension between the community and the Police_Department . As a result , South Bureau is widely seen as the most difficult proving_ground for community-based policing , the place where it either will thrive or perish . In December , Williams gave his officers the LAPD ' s blueprint for community policing . Administrative Order No . 10 called_for a rejuvenation of Davis ' basic car plan and a reconstruction of public confidence in the department through the creation of police advisory_boards . A month later , Kroeker took the mission to the streets of South Los Angeles . On a warm January morning , Kroeker introduced 30 senior lead officers , the front_line of the community-based policing effort , whom he described as &quot; some of the finest police_officers that anyone will ever meet. &quot; Men and women of varying backgrounds , some of Kroeker ' s senior lead officers have more_than a decade on_the_job , others are newer . But they share a conviction that officers can do their jobs better if they work with residents , not against them . They project an image -- optimistic , open , accommodating -- that was_on display at Kroeker ' s newsconference . With dozens of reporters and curious residents looking_on and his senior lead officers beaming behind him , Kroeker debuted his program at a location rich_in symbolism : the intersection of Florence and Normandie avenues , site of one of the LAPD ' s most conspicuous failures . * Community-based policing will be a hard_sell in some quarters of South Bureau . Take , for instance , the modest shopping_center at Martin_Luther_King Boulevard and Vermont Avenue , one of many that burned during the riots . Today , the mall is rebuilt , but the shopkeepers no longer depend_on the Police_Department for their well-being . Once exposed to the street , the mall now is surrounded by a forbidding , black fence . The gates close at night . Security_guards pace the parking_lot during the day . &quot; The sense I get from people is that the police are not their friends , &quot; Robert Munoz , manager of a video store at the mall , said recently . &quot; There ' s other areas where I ' ve seen the police closer to the community . Here , they ' re trying to do_it through the papers and through TV , but they need to get_out and talk to people. &quot; The LAPD ' s public pronouncements about community policing have barely reached these merchants or their patrons . Some shake their heads in puzzlement when asked about the idea , some commend the effort but say they have yet to see results . Others simply dismiss the department ' s promises . &quot; It ' s the same here as always , &quot; said Bruce Fisher , who lives_in the neighborhood . &quot; If anything , it ' s worse . . . . They ( the police ) show no respect for us. &quot; * On a recent drizzly Saturday afternoon , Officer Keith Thomas got an earful from the community he serves . The community he grew_up in . The same community he lives_in today . One man told Thomas of a nearby house where a drug dealer peddles crack in the afternoons . Another let him know about a local park where young_men spend the day drinking , gambling and smoking dope . A third complained about a liquor_store where prostitutes solicit customers . Yet another raised a common fear , that of reprisals against those who cooperate with police : &quot; A lot of us are worried about gang intimidation , &quot; the middle-aged woman said . &quot; If I call you , do you have to come_to my house ? &quot; Thomas , a gregarious , barrel-chested officer with nine years on the department , fielded each concern , offering suggestions , promising that he would request patrols and personally check the trouble spots . To the woman afraid of retaliation , he pledged understanding and discretion . &quot; I can call you or , if I come_to your house , I won ' t bring the black-and-white ( police_car ) , and I won ' t come_in uniform , &quot; he said . &quot; I can come and sit on your porch , and we ' ll watch the problem . I look_like everyone else. &quot; Already , Thomas has registered a string of successes in his area , a mixture of middle-class and run-down neighborhoods that stretch from 79th Street to 108th Street . Of those early victories , however , none is sweeter than what happened at 84th Street and Kansas Avenue . At a small house near that intersection , drug dealers were running a bustling business , exchanging crack for cash through a mail_slot . Users would smoke the drugs in the area around the house , cars would stack_up outside , and residents of a nearby retirement home were forced to endure threats and indignities -- customers would block the sidewalks , forcing wheelchair-bound seniors into the street . People got mugged . Car thefts skyrocketed . So did prostitution . The intersection had drawn the attention of the local councilman , Mark Ridley-Thomas , and when a police advisory_board was formed , 84th and Kansas topped its list of problem spots . &quot; We don ' t just want you to come_in and arrest the people with the drugs , &quot; board President Gloria Jean Howard , a forceful and enthusiastic woman , told Thomas . &quot; We want a real resolution , a lasting one. &quot; Traditional policing offered little hope of achieving that . The house at the corner was fortified with a series of iron doors , the outer ones specially mounted to resist crowbars . Sentries were often posted on the roof . Officers worried that by the time they got inside the building , all_the drugs would have been disposed_of . So Thomas took a different tack . He started off by donning street_clothes and videotaping the scene . He shared that tape with the district_attorney ' s office , while Councilman Ridley-Thomas solicited the help of the Falcon unit , an innovative , multi-agency group that can confiscate property involved in the drug trade . The owners , at first reluctant to oust their trouble-making tenants , softened considerably when Falcon officers threatened to seize the building . At the same time , officers were bringing pressure on the tenants , serving warrants and arresting customers . Two weeks ago , the suspects took_off , flinging their belongings into the alley , at last leaving a community they had terrorized for months . Last week , tow trucks carted_off a_few abandoned vehicles from the property . Building and safety workers boarded_up the house . Cleanup crews hauled_off the garbage while a representative of Ridley-Thomas monitored the scene . &quot; We knocked that problem off our list , &quot; Officer Thomas told the residents at their community meeting . &quot; Now we ' re on to the next case . Eventually , we ' ll get every one of those things off the list , and we ' ll work_on something else , like beautifying our neighborhood. &quot; But the press of crime offers little opportunity to bask in victories . As Thomas strolled the property last week , a call came_in summoning officers to a possible break-in a block away . Less than a minute after Thomas was talking to a boyhood friend about life in the neighborhood , he and other officers were bursting inside someone ' s home , guns drawn , braced for the worst . No one was inside . This time . * At the heart of community-based policing in its current LAPD incarnation is a nascent network of police advisory_boards -- panels that the department hopes will eventually draw hundreds of volunteers and form the focal_point of police-community relations . The city had a handful of such panels before Williams mandated creation of boards in all 18 of the LAPD ' s geographic divisions in December . But as the boards grow in number and stature , they are raising new questions about how and by whom the Police_Department will be managed . Some politicians , most notably Councilman Ridley-Thomas , have raised concerns about the process for selecting advisory_board members and about a department rule excluding council_members and their staffs from serving . The LAPD has tried to prevent the boards from becoming politicized . Already , it has had to rein_in a_few . In the Valley , one Neighborhood Watch group used its newsletter to criticize a City_Council member . The members of that group were warned that politics had no place in literature that bore the Police_Department ' s seal_of_approval . In the South Bureau , the advisory_boards are being encouraged to offer guidance and direction . There are limits , certainly , but for the most part they have yet to be tested . What happens , some officials wonder quietly , if one of the boards directs its local police_officers to stop carrying batons ? Or to revise their shooting policy ? &quot; We ' re going to push until they say : ' No. ' That will tell us what the limit is , &quot; said Cleve Freeman , 46 , a soft-spoken but determined Texas native who became president of his police advisory_board in January . &quot; We want results . We ' ve done enough talking . We need to improve the quality_of_life in our city. &quot; Freeman and his colleagues have targeted three houses where graffiti , gangs and drugs have taken_hold . At a recent meeting of their advisory_board , they informed their senior lead officer that they wanted action in those areas . In return , they pledged to help the department by keeping_an_eye_on the houses and by calling_in anytime problems arise . &quot; we ' ll measure our success by looking_back at our goals , those three houses , &quot; Freeman said . &quot; Did we do everything humanly possible ? Did those problems get solved ? If not , we failed ; but if so , we will have made this a better place. &quot; Reaching Out ( BullDog Edition , A24 ) On Dec . 3 , 1993 , Police_Chief Willie L . Williams released to his officers the LAPD ' s most far-reaching explanation to date on community-based policing . That document , Administrative Order No . 10 , outlines the LAPD ' s definition of community policing and the chief ' s most current proposals for implementing it citywide . According to the order : &quot; Community policing is a guiding philosophy which strengthens the partnership between law_enforcement and all_the people in the communities we serve . It draws upon our goals to protect and serve by broadening and strengthening our ability to succeed in reducing crime and fear of crime . Through the empowerment of our employees and our customers , a true problem-solving partnership can be created for the good of all. &quot; To implement that philosophy , Williams directed his officers to &quot; implement change by focusing_on three of the most important issues facing the department today : * Rebuilding our patrol force and rejuvenating the basic car plan ; * Developing a strategic plan in_order to develop goals and strategies for the future ; * Rebuilding public confidence in the Police_Department through the development of police community councils for all 18 geographic areas. &quot; Source : Los Angeles Police_Department , Administrative Order No . 10 .</TEXT>
