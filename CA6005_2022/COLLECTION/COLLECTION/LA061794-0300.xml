   <HEADLINE> PIANIST ' S STRONG MIND IS AGAIN JOINED BY A STRONG BODY ; JAZZ : THE CHINESE MEDICAL ART OF CHI GONG GIVES JOANNE BRACKEEN THE STRENGTH FOR SUSTAINED PLAYING OF INTRICATE , ANGLED , HIGHLY EVOLVED MUSIC . SHE MAKES A RARE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA APPEARANCE THIS WEEKEND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The spare New York loft of JoAnne Brackeen is dominated by two grand_pianos , facing and tucked into each other , the melding of curves a happy if formidable yin / yang . But nearby , on her wood writing desk , is the image that telegraphs so_much more : a photo of Brackeen at the keyboard , characteristically bent forward while summoning canyon-like walls of chords , with a strange fuzzy cloud of light hovering over her . Is it a defect in the print emulsion ? An eerie accident of flash lighting ? &quot; Energy . It ' s the energy , &quot; says Brackeen . &quot; If you can see it , then you know it. &quot; The Energy . Right . If anything characterizes this protean jazz artist , who makes a rare appearance in town tonight and Saturday at the Jazz Bakery , it is her seemingly exhaustion-proof capacity for the sustained playing of intricate , angled , highly evolved music that often rides a nervous edge between atonal anarchy and lavish , unapologetic romanticism . A fair amount of energy is required of the listener , not to mention the practitioner , and so energy and its management take_on a special role in the Brackeen conception . But it hasn ' t come easy . In the mid- ' 80s , Brackeen was poised to enjoy the central role in modern_jazz music that musicians and critics often prognosticated for her : to be a dominant force in the evolution of jazz piano . She had served with distinction the apprenticeships reserved for those very few up-and-comers who show not only facility but imagination . Dexter Gordon , Art Blakey , Stan Getz , Joe Henderson -- each had in his band the woman whose playing complemented the band ' s sound yet whose solos at times edged toward space , the odd chord , the roiling 3-D knit of new sounds . Brackeen , in the late 1970s , would go her own way , be her own force . By the early 1980s , she ' d achieved considerable artistic success as both composer and recording artist , notably with her 1981 LP &quot; Special Identity , &quot; featuring Eddie Gomez on bass and Jack DeJohnette on drums . She would , however , find herself struggling to find an identity as a band leader who might find easy booking at New York ' s hallowed but male-dominated jazz clubs . But her music expanded further in both solo and trio formats , and her sound became ever-singular . Critics struggled for modifiers of comparison . While McCoy Tyner ' s name serially appeared to account_for her thunder and Bill Evans ' legacy arose as compass to her tender side , it was clear that the only workable references would be spiritual and bear no similarity in_style or content : Ornette Coleman for his freedom , his spaciousness , his daring ; Cecil &quot; What ' s-He-Doing ? &quot; Taylor for just that mysterious quality . In being true_to her idiosyncratic vision , however , Brackeen eluded many who classify and promote music . By 1987 , Brackeen had become not a household name but one of jazz ' s inside players , lost on the mass audience but winning critical notice and passionate listeners willing to summon the energy to meet her on_her_own ground . If she wasn ' t at the Village Vanguard , she was nearby at Bradleys , the premier piano-bass room in America , happily exploring the outer limits of duo playing with the formidable bassist Cecil McBee . But the Brackeen constellation also was undergoing a far worse threat than that posed by a fickle jazz marketplace . Her energy -- the very source of her complex , demanding art -- was threatened . In 1987 she was experiencing deep bouts of fatigue and , in her arms , pain and muscle failure -- symptoms she prefers not to name medically but refers to as &quot; problems we all have at some point. &quot; that ' s when she met the man who would help her find the cloud of light in the picture , help her commence what has since -- through the release last month of &quot; Take_a_Chance , &quot; her latest CD -- been the most fecund period of her career . * Brackeen appeared recently at the University of Hawaii to perform and deliver a lecture titled &quot; Jazz , Chi Gong and I. &quot; In the audience was Dr. Chu Chow , Brackeen ' s Toronto-based master of Chi Gong , an ancient Chinese medical_practice that seeks to establish balance between one ' s output of physical energy and one ' s capacity to receive , or renew , it . Chow , says Brackeen , &quot; changed everything . He teaches me , and Chi Gong has given me my life back. &quot; It has also given Chow a tune_in his name , a conceptual piece written and recorded by Brackeen in 1989 on what would become a landmark effort : the first of Concord ' s CD series of solo piano performances at Berkeley ' s Maybeck Recital Hall . Chi Gong is a Tao-rooted system of animal-like body movements . Its name translates to &quot; working with chi , &quot; or working with life-force energy . The exercises are designed to awaken natural fields of energy throughout the body . In Brackeen it has erased pain , bolstered energy and reinforced the notion that creativity is connected to the body as much as the mind . Brackeen gives at least two hours a day to her Chi Gong regimen but also notes that &quot; you can live your whole day within it. &quot; The result , she says , is a continuous restoration of energy for someone who &quot; puts_out enormous amounts of energy &quot; performing , writing , teaching and touring . Like Brackeen ' s music , though , Chi Gong can challenge sensibility , and Brackeen ' s use of it as a life and art battery charge may be singular . Pianist Marian McPartland was introduced to Chi Gong by Brackeen but found it elusive . &quot; I can ' t go_with it , &quot; McPartland says , &quot; and ( JoAnne ) knows it. &quot; McPartland , however , is accustomed to challenge from her friend Brackeen . &quot; I don ' t think there ' s anybody like JoAnne , &quot; McPartland says . &quot; She has wild ideas , and she ' s not afraid to try them . She ' ll lay out the melodic_line , such_as it is , and right away I ' ll think : ' What the hell is she doing ? ' Then , she ' ll improvise , with variations on chords that , it seems , shouldn ' t work . But it always sounds right . If I tried it , I ' d be in a pickle. &quot; Making unlikely things sound right , of course , is at the heart of improvisation . And improvising is a peculiar deed . It involves so many things : playing in real time with band members , hearing those band members and choosing yet simultaneously playing notes that &quot; sound right &quot; against the band ' s sonic backdrop and coalesce into a distinct statement , or solo . It ' s a subject that has pushed a professorial Wynton Marsalis to ponder consciousness and an incisive McPartland to differentiate between moments of &quot; making choices &quot; and moments of playing by &quot; impulse. &quot; Brackeen , ever the iconoclast , will have no such talk . &quot; When you eat your lunch , &quot; she says , &quot; your stomach is working and doing things , your blood is moving all around , but all you know is the taste . Music is like that . All I know is the taste . I don ' t know about descriptions . Descriptions are at_odds with facing the pure energy. &quot; The Energy . Brackeen pauses a moment . &quot; I don ' t think Picasso had time to go_into descriptions. &quot; * Brackeen , like Picasso , broke convention , and she always likely will . The Ventura native refused to practice piano_lessons as a child because , she says , &quot; they were boring. &quot; But she did take from those lessons the ability to read &quot; lines and spaces , &quot; all_the notation she needed to teach herself facility on the instrument in six months . She started gigging at age 11 at private parties . At 17 she won a scholarship to the Los Angeles Conservatory but dropped_out in days because &quot; they had names for stuff I considered very obvious. &quot; Then it was headlong into jazz , with work in L.A. in the late 1950s with Charles Lloyd , Dexter Gordon , Harold Land . In time she would show the daunting fluency that allows her to scoff at the mechanics of improvisation , a gift succinctly stated by McPartland : &quot; She has the technical ability to play what she thinks. &quot; More_than most , however , Brackeen ' s career is marked by one constant , jazz ' s most important ingredient : change . Her newly released CD is a jazz appropriation of Brazilian music -- a taste she first developed playing with Getz and later made her own in her bristling 1991 CD , &quot; Breath of Brazil. &quot; The new CD , featuring longtime associate Eddie Gomez on bass , drummer Duduka da Fonseca and percussionist Waltinho Anastacio , brings an especially supple , elegant contour to the genre while managing to clearly communicate that spacious , alternately dissonant and romantic , Brackeen voice . It also has the most apt title in her discography : &quot; Take a Chance. &quot; that ' s pretty much all JoAnne Brackeen does at the keyboard anyway , pretty much her only choice under that cloud of energy . * Brackeen appears in solo performance today and Saturday at the Jazz Bakery , 3221 Hutchison Ave. , Culver City , ( 310 ) 271-9039 .</TEXT>
