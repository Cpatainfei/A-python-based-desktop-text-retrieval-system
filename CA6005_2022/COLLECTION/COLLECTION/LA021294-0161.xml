   <HEADLINE> RICK DU BROW : ' CADILLACS ' CARTOON ENTERS BRAVE NEW_WORLD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Creatively , the Saturday-morning CBS cartoon &quot; Cadillacs and Dinosaurs &quot; is a curious mix of action , merchandising and political correctness . &quot; The machinery of life is a balance , &quot; intones the hero of the futuristic tale , an ecologist-adventurer named Jack Tenrec . &quot; We have to maintain it. &quot; Such dollops of environmentalism are hardly the overwhelming content of the children ' s show -- they are dropped_in here and there amid the adventure and commercialism that over the years have become trademarks of Saturday-morning cartoons . But Southern California viewers have not been able to get much of a look_at the show because of preemptions , which will continue with CBS ' coverage of the Winter_Olympics next week . &quot; It ' s preempted a lot , &quot; acknowledges a network spokeswoman . &quot; Cadillacs and Dinosaurs &quot; is , however , scheduled to make one of its rare appearances here at 10:30 a.m. today ( Channels 2 and 8 ) . And if the environmentalism doesn ' t exactly match the slam-bang action , the series nonetheless is yet another pertinent example of how the much-criticized use of kids ' programs as 30-minute commercials to sell related products is being upgraded for the interactive computer age and beyond . The co-executive producers of the half-hour &quot; Cadillacs and Dinosaurs &quot; include Steven de Souza , screenwriter of such movies as &quot; Die Hard &quot; and &quot; 48 HRS. , &quot; and Sasha Harari , who produced the film &quot; The Doors. &quot; Their Saturday children ' s program -- now in its first season , with renewal up_in_the_air -- has made a deal granting licenses for the show to the new Palo Alto , Calif.-based firm Rocket Science Games Inc. for such technology as Sega CD , Sony CD and CD-ROM , disks that combine audio , video and text . &quot; Understanding that games are serious business is the new revolution in Hollywood , &quot; says Mike Backes , a co-founder of Rocket Science whose credits include display graphics for &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; and writing for the film &quot; Rising Sun. &quot; &quot; Key players are beginning to see that when kids spend more money on Nintendo and Sega games than they do for movie tickets , the future in entertainment may be in game software , &quot; Backes adds . So are we solely into a mind-bending , unfolding maze of technology , or is the play still the thing ? For Harari , there is no doubt : The key to &quot; Cadillacs and Dinosaurs &quot; -- whether it is picked_up or remains in television syndication -- has been the creator , Mark Schultz , the noted comic_book artist on whose work the series is based . If &quot; Cadillacs and Dinosaurs &quot; has the requisite good_guys , bad_guys , chase scenes and the_like , nonetheless , an analysis of the CBS Saturday morning schedule by Esther Sinclair , UCLA associate_professor of psychiatry and bio-behavioral sciences , had some favorable words for the show . &quot; Jack is altruistic , does not have aggressive impulses , resists temptation and is sympathetic toward others , &quot; she wrote , also noting the attitude toward protecting animals : &quot; The viewer may draw an analogy to other endangered species such_as eagles and condors . . . . There is an emphasis on the interconnection of all living things . Jack respects all life forms. &quot; In the series , as CBS describes it , Jack and scientist Hannah Dundee , in the 26th Century , cruise the landscape &quot; in their classic Cadillac , searching for the remnants of ancient technology that can tame their savage world . Pitted against them are dinosaurs ( as well as ) tyrants and warlords , poachers and mutants. &quot; With TV violence and commercialism of kids ' shows deservedly being targeted , Harari maintains that the mayhem of the comic_book version was toned_down : &quot; We absolutely adjusted it . We did reduce this . We tried to have Jack reacting to choices. &quot; But he concedes that &quot; these kinds of shows are primarily oriented to boys . Kids need to see some forward-moving adventure , and I think we did_it quite well . And through this we try to weave messages and introduce the goals of proper social behavior and the environment and ecology . If it gets preachy , you lose most of the audience. &quot; In addition , he says , CBS programming standards also brought pressure to bear . He adds , however , that the network &quot; did not support the show &quot; the way ABC and Fox promote their children ' s programs and that CBS &quot; management is primarily oriented toward prime time. &quot; Although promotion is important to building overall merchandising impact , the challenges are probably more diverse in the growing world of video_games and interactive TV . For the game versions of &quot; Cadillacs and Dinosaurs , &quot; alternative scenes and endings and other viewer involvements will build_on Schultz ' s work -- as with the original output of other creators . Harari , discussing &quot; Cadillacs and Dinosaurs , &quot; told Forbes magazine last year : &quot; Our only care is to create a digital database of content because down at the bottom of everything , digital content is oblivious to its means of transportation . . . to the consumer . It doesn ' t care if it plays_on a videotape recorder , a video_game , a compact_disc or a compact_disc interactive . Content doesn ' t care if it is networked through cable , microwave or satellite. &quot; The former owner of a computer_business , Harari does not argue the point that children ' s shows like his are in large part commercials to enhance merchandising in other forms : &quot; Unfortunately , it ' s true . The stakes are very high. &quot; He notes that even the high-minded &quot; Sesame Street &quot; is &quot; a major , major industry. &quot; He adds : &quot; What ' s happening in the new digital world is that we ' re witnessing the birth of a more complex and non-linear storytelling . You can take a world created through comic_books or other entertainment properties and , through computers , have the ability to fast-access any angle of this world , which doesn ' t have to be sequential or linear . that ' s the way it ' s been until now , reading a book from page one . &quot; It ' s not the death of linear storytelling , but forming a new form of storytelling. &quot; Fine . But I want to read &quot; The Great Gatsby &quot; in a book , starting on page one .</TEXT>
