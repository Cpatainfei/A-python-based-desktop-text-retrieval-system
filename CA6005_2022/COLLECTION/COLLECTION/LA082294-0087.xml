   <HEADLINE> CHAVIS MAY FORM GROUP TO RIVAL NAACP ; CIVIL RIGHTS : OUSTED LEADER WELCOMES FARRAKHAN , 60 OTHER BLACK ACTIVISTS AT SUMMIT THAT THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION HAD SAID WAS POSTPONED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ousted NAACP head Benjamin F . Chavis Jr . rebounded Sunday from his firing by embracing controversial Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan at a black leadership summit . At the same time , there was speculation that Chavis is organizing a new , grass-roots organization to challenge the nation ' s oldest civil_rights group . As the NAACP board began its search for a new executive_director , Chavis welcomed Farrakhan and about 60 other black activists to a summit that included representatives of community organizations , fraternities and sororities , and religious groups . In doing so , Chavis contradicted NAACP Chairman William F . Gibson , who had informed reporters after Chavis ' dismissal Saturday night that the summit had been postponed . The 2 1 / 2-day series of private strategy sessions and public town_hall meetings was relocated from the NAACP headquarters to two black churches here . &quot; We ' re going to move forward , &quot; Chavis said in his opening address at the National African American Leadership Summit . &quot; We ' re not going_to let what happened yesterday pull us back. &quot; Describing Chavis ' conduct during his 16-month tenure as &quot; inimical to the best interests &quot; of the National Assn . for the Advancement of Colored People , Gibson declined to say precisely why the board -- for the first time in its 85-year history -- fired its executive_director . The phrasing of the board ' s resolution , however , was broad enough to cover a range of complaints against Chavis , including his use of NAACP money to pay a former employee $ 332 # 400 to settle her threatened suit charging him with sex discrimination and wrongful discharge , as well as his attempts to redirect the group to appeal_to younger , more confrontational members . Chavis ' remarks immediately after being fired Saturday night and a day later at the summit suggested that he is laying the foundation for a new group aimed at &quot; mobilizing the masses &quot; of young and poor blacks who supported him as NAACP head . &quot; I feel good , &quot; Chavis shouted to the summit participants , sounding like soul singer James Brown . &quot; As I reflect back now . . . I recall my election ( as NAACP executive_director ) took_place on Good_Friday in 1993 . Now there ' s been a crucifixion , but today we celebrate the resurrection. &quot; Rodney Orange , president of the Baltimore chapter of the NAACP and one of Chavis ' strongest supporters within the organization , said he sensed that Chavis was testing his support for a rival group . Orange said the NAACP board would respond to such a challenge by &quot; deciding what role it wants to play with_respect_to the grass roots . Once things settle_down , I think they would have to get involved with that process . They have wanted to do that all along , but they were concerned with how Dr. Chavis was doing_it and how fast he was doing it. &quot; In a news_conference immediately following his dismissal , an emotional but defiant Chavis promised he would n ' t fade from the civil_rights spotlight even if the NAACP no longer wanted his leadership . And he added : &quot; This is unity time . we ' ll stay_together come hell and high water. &quot; The leadership summit that began Sunday is a follow-up to a similar meeting held last June and was one of the more controversial NAACP programs during Chavis ' leadership . Many board_members objected to Chavis ' invitation to Farrakhan , fearing his presence would cast a negative light on the more mainstream civil_rights organization . The Nation of Islam leader is perceived by some blacks_and_whites as anti-white and anti-Semitic . But Chavis scoffed at such concerns , arguing that the NAACP under his leadership would not be told what to do . As Farrakhan beamed with obvious satisfaction , Chavis repeated that pledge Sunday , saying : &quot; As you heard me say at the conclusion of the last summit , never again would we allow forces outside of the African American community to dictate to us whom we should meet with , when we should meet and what we should meet about. &quot; Chavis said all_of the participants of the previous summit were invited back , but many of the better known black figures who had attended the previous meeting -- including the Rev . Jesse Jackson , Rep . Kweisi Mfume ( D-Md. ) and Harvard_University professor Cornell West -- were not present at the opening session . &quot; Over the next 2 1 / 2 days we have a lot of hard work to do , &quot; Chavis said , noting the attendees would focus_on black economic development , youth employment and moral development of the African American community . Chavis said that since he is no longer being held_back by the NAACP board , &quot; I feel a little liberated right now . I do not have a straitjacket on. &quot;</TEXT>
