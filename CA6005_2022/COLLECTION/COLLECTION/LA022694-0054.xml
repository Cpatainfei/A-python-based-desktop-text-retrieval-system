   <TEXT> Boris Yeltsin used to run this town . Now the mob does . The new czar is a former soccer star named Konstantin Tsyganov . Police and fellow gangsters say Tsyganov ' s crime organization controls 60 % of this rich industrial region , with branch operations in Moscow . In or out of jail , Tsyganov is a man with clout . During a mob war last summer , his henchmen decided that they needed more_than machine_guns to battle rivals from the ferocious Chechen mafia . So they hijacked a state-of-the-art tank from a nearby military testing ground and parked it in the central square . The Chechens left town . Tsyganov ' s men make regular deliveries of food , chocolate , tea and medicine to Ekaterinburg ' s overcrowded jail . The warden , who says the state has slashed his budget so severely that two inmates died from the poor conditions , shrugs and accepts the booty . Tsyganov is something of a Russian Robin_Hood . His thugs allegedly extract up_to a third of the profits from businesses struggling to establish themselves . Yet after he was arrested on extortion charges last spring , invalids , pensioners and the local soccer team wrote letters of protest , extolling his philanthropy and demanding his release . All said they could not survive without his largess . But while Tsyganov sat in jail , someone used a grenade launcher to blast the Ekaterinburg City_Hall and the headquarters of the police organized crime unit . Thugs then gave a bone-crushing beating to a judge who had denied him bail . Not surprisingly , nearly three-quarters of residents believe that their city is ruled not by the government but by the mafia , according to a 1993 survey . And 56 % believe that the police are not fighting organized crime because they have been bought_off . Ekaterinburg is not unique . Organized crime and corruption have become so pervasive that they are choking the development of a free-market system in Russia , according to a growing chorus of officials , business people and victims . Some believe that the problem could even threaten the Yeltsin government itself . &quot; The growth of organized_crime , permeating the police and local authorities , threatens political and economic development in Russia , creating the conditions for the national_socialists to come_to power , &quot; said a report sent to President Yeltsin in January . In his State of the Nation speech Thursday , Yeltsin promised a crackdown on crime , which has seemed to grow as fast as the private sector in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet_Union . He warned that organized_crime in particular &quot; is trying to take the country by the throat. &quot; He called_on Parliament to revise the Soviet-era legal_code adopted in the 1950s to make_it easier to fight crime and corruption . During the December parliamentary elections , Communists told voters that the Yeltsin administration was more corrupt than the old Soviet system , and ultranationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky promised to convene tribunals to shoot criminals on the spot . Reformers did not make crime a campaign issue , and were trounced . Determined to deprive his conservative foes of a populist issue , Yeltsin called fighting crime the year ' s most important issue , a goal that reflects the realization that the lack of law and order has become a serious political liability . The Red Star newspaper wrote this month that analysts have for some time predicted that Russia ' s estimated 4 # 000 organized crime groups would consolidate , divide up turf , forge links with foreign criminal networks , buy_up key officials and become politicized . Now it is happening , the newspaper asserted . &quot; It is now clear that this phenomenon . . . poses a real threat to national security , threatening the political and economic development of Russia , &quot; it said . According to the report to the president by Pyotr S . Filippov , the longtime Yeltsin adviser who heads the presidential Analytical Center for Social and Economic Policy , all owners of cafes , restaurants and retail_stores are paying protection money to mobsters , as are 70 % to 80 % of privatized businesses and commercial_banks . Extortionists routinely demand tribute of up_to 20 % of the turnover -- often totaling more_than half the profit , the report said . This &quot; hidden_tax to bandits , &quot; as well as price-fixing and monopoly-building by mobsters , increases prices by 20 % to 30 % , contributing to the further impoverishment of the population , the report said . Organized crime groups and their shady business partners are all known here by the umbrella term mafia , though they are smaller and far less organized than La Cosa Nostra or Latin_American drug cartels . Collectively , these corrupt bands are blamed for hastening the flight of Russian_capital abroad . Russian officials say at least $ 1 billion a month is flowing into Western and offshore banks that already hold_up to $ 40 billion in Russian deposits . Unofficial sources say the real figures are closer to double that . Some of the dollars are ferried out of Russia by businesses anxious to protect their money against inflation , confiscatory taxes or mafia extortion . Some of the outflow comes from government credits to industry , which , instead of being invested in rebuilding Russian manufacturing , quickly find their way into foreign banks . But a significant portion of the $ 1 billion fleeing Russia each month is believed to belong_to the mob and its growing business empire . In some cases , gangsters have forced banks to transfer tainted capital abroad illegally -- and then killed the bankers who knew where the deposits were kept , according to the report . Bankers now have a high mortality_rate ; more_than 30 were slain last year . At a time when Russia faces growing unemployment , some would-be entrepreneurs are being scared out of business by the mob . One is 23-year-old Oleg Morozov , who started a private real_estate company in Moscow in late 1992 . Morozov is no shrinking violet . In the army , he spent three days in an underground stockade for painting a mocking mural of Felix E . Dzerzhinsky , founder of the Soviet secret_police . Morozov said he dropped_out of law_school when he realized that students were paying bribes to pass exams and could even buy their degrees . He and a friend cut their teeth in real_estate by leasing a hotel floor for the ruble equivalent of $ 25 per room , and then renting the rooms to foreigners for $ 110 a night . &quot; It was perfectly legal , but they never would have let us do_it if we hadn ' t paid the hotel director and the front desk receptionist , &quot; the former athlete said . Less than three months after Morozov and a new partner opened a real_estate office , racketeers came calling . &quot; One guy who knew how to talk and four hulking guys with broken noses &quot; promised they would be back in a week to start collecting an unspecified sum in tribute , he said . Morozov quit then and there . He and others say the only way to stay in business in the face of an outrageous payment demand is to find a &quot; reasonable &quot; mafia that charges low rates -- as little as 8 % -- and provides protection against street thugs and other would-be extortionists . Such &quot; good mafias &quot; are known here as krysha , which means roof , and many business people say it is impossible to function in Russia without them . Not all gangsters rely_on physical force to collect payment . Some merely threaten to report their victims to the tax inspector . Nearly every business fudges its income to avoid taxes that can total 90 % of its profit . In Ekaterinburg , which was called Sverdlovsk when Yeltsin was first secretary of the local Communist_Party , a recent government survey of 400 enterprises found one-third were not paying taxes . Entrepreneurs figure it is cheaper and more reliable to pay the mob than to tangle_with the tax police . Bureaucrats and politicians also are held hostage . Filippov , the Yeltsin adviser , says organized crime leaders are carefully building dossiers on all major government officials and politicians . In Ekaterinburg , organized crime investigators working in the building that was damaged by the grenade attack say they have evidence that mobsters are not only keeping files on them , but surreptitiously photographing them . Attempts to crack_down on organized_crime have failed because law_enforcement has been infiltrated with mob informers , Filippov said . In some places , local officials seem to be cowed by gangsters , while elsewhere they collaborate . In the old town of Tver , officials will not issue a business license for a coffee_shop without getting clearance from the local godfather , Filippov said . In the Volga city of Kazan , only mobsters are allowed to drive foreign cars or Volgas , the Russian luxury sedans ; gangsters yank other drivers from behind the wheel and drive_off in the prestigious vehicles . Moscow officials are unable to stop the dangerous and illegal sale of gasoline from the backs of trucks , because the gasoline gangs reportedly pay the traffic police to tip them off when a raid is coming . With law_enforcement compromised and mobsters running amok , the populist promises of neo-fascist leader Zhirinovsky , who campaigned on a law-and-order platform , have a dangerous resonance . &quot; Failure to take decisive and systematic measures to alleviate the economic causes of crime . . . as well as the absence of political will to fight organized crime , could bring the national_socialists to power during the 1996 presidential election , &quot; Filippov wrote . In an interview , Filippov called_for the creation of a Russian equivalent of the FBI to fight organized crime , but with a catch : Not one officer who has served in the police or the KGB should be hired for the unit of &quot; Untouchables. &quot; The unit ' s regional supervisors would be rotated frequently , he proposed , and officers would be dismissed at the first whiff of corruption . In return , the unit would be permitted to conduct stings and to make preventive arrests to keep suspected gangsters in custody without charges for up_to several months . Such tactics are banned under Russian law , and would raise the hackles of human_rights advocates , but Filippov argues that only Draconian measures will suffice . &quot; We need a white terror , &quot; Filippov said , meaning a righteous purge of evildoers rather than a bloody , Bolshevik &quot; red terror. &quot; An elite squad of &quot; 300 fanatics &quot; could put the mob out of business in short order , he said . Filippov ' s findings about the mob ' s grip do not surprise most Russians , who believe that their nation has been plundered by officials in cahoots with criminals . The police are held_in pure contempt by the many citizens who have had occasion to bribe them . The disenchanted often remark that &quot; the state itself is the mafia. &quot; Every day , the media reinforces the impression that the bad_guys are winning , and that no one is safe . The latest travesty was the Feb . 1 assassination of a revered publisher who had brought_out the works of exiled novelist Alexander Solzhenitsyn . Sergei Dubov was gunned_down as he left his Moscow home for a morning jog . Police said the killing had all_the earmarks of a professional &quot; hit , &quot; and newspapers speculated that Dubov had a fatal financial disagreement with the mob . If crime abounds , punishment is rare . Gangsters are far more likely to be slain by rivals than arrested . The conviction of a bribe-taking bureaucrat or a corrupt cop would be sensational news here ; but such stories almost never appear . Despite the torrent of allegations of corruption exchanged by Yeltsin supporters and their foes in the Supreme Soviet last summer , not a single high-ranking official has appeared in the dock . &quot; The prosecutor ' s office is an exclusively political tool , &quot; said Igor Baranovsky , an investigative reporter for the Moscow News . &quot; It will never work against the party in power. &quot; Low-level officials do get nabbed , but these cases get little publicity . In 1993 , the Interior Ministry logged about 13 # 000 crimes by government officials , ranging from abuse of power to forgery , theft and graft . The ministry also opened 8 # 000 extortion case files last year , said Gennady F . Chebotarev , the first deputy chief of the Interior Ministry ' s organized crime control department . If the vast majority of bribes and shakedowns go unreported , it is not only because of fear , but because &quot; both sides are satisfied with the arrangement , &quot; Chebotarev said . In Ekaterinburg , even the police admit that Tsyganov is a well-liked man . Supporters say it is because he gave fledgling entrepreneurs what their government has been unable to provide : protection against petty criminals and other extortionists , reliable debt collection , a well-connected &quot; friend &quot; to run interference with meddling bureaucrats and , sometimes , financing at much lower interest_rates than banks offer . Even if much of his capital was extorted from businesses or stolen from state enterprises , Tsyganov was trying to make his 30-odd companies into a legitimate business empire , they said . Police paint a less flattering portrait of Tsyganov , who is being held_in the nearby city of Perm because the local jail is not secure enough . Tsyganov ' s thugs once tried to batter a businessman into signing_over half of his company , said Vyacheslav I . Latyshev , deputy head of the Ekaterinburg organized crime department . When the man stoically refused , Tsyganov allegedly poked a knitting needle in his ear until he signed . The terrified victim is in hiding , and another potential witness is under heavy police guard after being shot . Latyshev believes that both men will eventually testify against Tsyganov . But he bemoans the lack of a program to protect , relocate or give new identities to the few witnesses willing to stand_up against the mob . In an interview in Trud newspaper this month , Yeltsin ' s ousted economic guru and deputy prime_minister , Yegor T . Gaidar , pointed_out that &quot; organized crime thrives by uniting with corrupt bureaucrats . Without this union , organized crime could not exist. &quot; No Ekaterinburg officials have been charged with protecting Tsyganov . Russia has no financial disclosure requirements for public_servants , so it is impossible to investigate whether there are official ties to Tsyganov-owned firms . Corruption is hardly_a new phenomenon in Russia . In czarist times , historian Nikolai Karamzin wrote , one could sum_up his country ' s plight in a single word . &quot; Voruyut , &quot; he wrote -- &quot; They are stealing. &quot; Soviet officialdom was also notoriously corrupt . What makes the current situation so troubling is that the state has relinquished central economic control without first dismantling state-run monopolies , safeguarding ownership rights or stripping bureaucrats of their near-absolute powers , analysts said . Organized criminals , inside and outside the massive Soviet-era bureaucracy , have rushed in to fill the vacuum . &quot; The state monopoly was replaced by a criminal monopoly , &quot; said Yuri Y . Boldyrev , who was fired as Yeltsin ' s top corruption investigator last summer after complaining that the administration lacked the will to stop the plunder . &quot; There is practically not a crime-free sphere in our economy. &quot; Russia ' s legions of ministries still have unchecked power to decide which firms should be given valuable export licenses , which ones should get loans , which ones should be given special tax_breaks , all with a lack of public accountability that creates a paradise for payola . &quot; If in Italy corruption means handing_out construction contracts , in Russia it means handing_over buildings that are already built , giving land plots away for free and handing_out various privileges , &quot; Boldyrev said . Gaidar argues that corruption cannot be fought with police methods unless its rich economic source is eradicated . For example , government credits to industry are tightly rationed , and it has become common for recipients to pay kickbacks in return for the valuable loans . As long as all bounty flows_from the state , graft will be hard to curb . &quot; If we are serious about fighting organized crime , the battle must be based on limiting the absolute power of the bureaucracy , &quot; Gaidar said .
