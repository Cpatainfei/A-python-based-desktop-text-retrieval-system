   <HEADLINE> SHAKE , RATTLE &amp; SPLIT ; THE JAN . 17 QUAKE ROCKED SOME FAMILIES TO THEIR VERY FOUNDATIONS , INCREASING MARITAL STRESS AND -- PERHAPS -- DIVORCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For Kim , the issue was not one of whether to leave , but of how . Three weeks after the Jan . 17 earthquake , with her Northridge home damaged , her husband rendered jobless by the disaster and the ground still rolling from aftershocks , she found a way . In the midst of being treated for a post-traumatic stress disorder , Kim took matters into her own hands , moving herself and her two small children to her parents ' home_in Oregon -- and leaving her husband behind . &quot; ( The earthquake ) propelled her like a shot from a gun , &quot; said Dr. Richard Ferman , a Northridge psychiatrist who treated Kim . &quot; She wanted to go anyway , but she couldn ' t justify it before . The earthquake gave her the perfect excuse. &quot; This , then , is the latest unhappy consequence of January ' s devastating earthquake . In an eerie echo of a phenomenon that has occurred among survivors of such disasters as Hurricane Andrew and the Mount St . Helens eruption , divorce and marital stress seem to be_on the increase among quake-affected Angelenos . Although experts caution that it is still too early to make definitive correlations , and even though post-quake divorce statistics have not been tabulated by Los Angeles County , marriage counselors and psychologists say many already troubled relationships have foundered even more following the quake , and divorce specialists report that their caseloads are inexorably rising . &quot; I ' m seeing a lot of divorces right now , &quot; said Lois Isenberg , a Miracle Mile paralegal who estimates that her number of clients has risen about 20 % recently -- a phenomenon she also witnessed in 1971 following the Sylmar quake . &quot; We had more clients last month than we ' ve had in a while. &quot; Similarly , at the Los Angeles Free Clinic , officials say the number of couples seeking divorce through the clinic ' s legal department is up dramatically in the past 10 weeks -- about 40 % from the same period last year . Observed Richard Thor , the clinic ' s counseling services director : &quot; The quake has put people over the edge_in situations where they normally would have coped. &quot; Although the question of whether divorces follow catastrophes is just starting to be examined , researchers and psychologists say separations are to be expected , given the extraordinary pressures disasters place on people . Just eight months after Hurricane Andrew , for example , the number of couples seeking divorce in Dade County , Fla. , climbed 30 % , a figure disaster experts predict will grow even higher in several years ' time . Psychologists beginning to study the effects of last year ' s Midwest floods on survivors say they also expect to see a similar increases in divorce , especially among younger couples . &quot; The anecdotal data suggests that ( disasters ) are a stress that many weak marriages do not recover from , &quot; said Dr. Charles Figley , director of the Psychological Stress Research Program at Florida State University . &quot; When the cleanup is over , people sometimes go_back to their relationships with a new perspective , and sometimes that perspective is not that useful for the relationship. &quot; * Researchers give several reasons for the upswing in separations . Paramount among them is the host of psychological conditions any disaster can trigger in survivors , including anxiety , depression and a rise in psychosomatic complaints . Domestic violence and substance_abuse can also increase , experts say , and in extreme cases , survivors may suffer lingering bouts of post-traumatic stress disorder . In the case of unhappy spouses such_as Kim , disasters can also serve to &quot; crystallize people ' s thinking &quot; and enable them to act_upon their subconscious thoughts , said Dr. Kenneth Manges , a Cincinnati psychiatrist who specializes in treating people affected by catastrophes . Indeed , for survivors , the cliched &quot; moment of truth &quot; is one that occurs frequently in disasters . &quot; It ' s not uncommon for a person facing death to make decisions that had been lying_dormant , &quot; Manges said . &quot; There ' s the sense of , ' If I live through this , I ' m going_to do things differently. ' &quot; Margery Shelton , director of clinical training at the California Family Studies Center in North Hollywood , concurred : &quot; It clears_up a lot of gray areas . Some people have said , ' I was thinking_of leaving my spouse , and as a result of the earthquake , I realize that I must. ' &quot; That was exactly the thought that flooded the mind of Tina , a college instructor in her 30s from Los Angeles , who nearly left her husband on the afternoon after the quake . She was_on the verge of hailing a cab to the airport and was prevented only by the fact that &quot; I couldn ' t make_up my mind where I wanted to go . Otherwise , I would have left. &quot; She is attempting to reconcile with her husband . Then again , some couples find their relationship better as a result of having rallied around each other in a time of crisis . Ruben Murillo , a coordinator with Project Rebound , a quake recovery program that provides mental_health services , escaped the disaster with just the clothes on his back . Although his Sylmar home was destroyed , Murillo credits the quake for making his 28-year marriage even stronger . &quot; When you ' re standing outside among the ruins , that should help you see that what ' s important is each other , &quot; he said . Likewise , Los Angeles divorce attorney Patricia Phillips said she was handling the divorce of two couples -- each of whom suffered through November ' s fires and January ' s quake -- when both couples decided to reconcile . &quot; Together , they felt they could probably make_it , &quot; she said . Researchers say this response is also common but warn that in instances where the &quot; pre-disaster &quot; state of the marriage was weak , old problems and issues are likely to recur , and perhaps even be exacerbated with new dilemmas arising from the disaster . In such marriages , the added pressure of a catastrophe may_not be the primary factor fueling discord , but may well become the stress that finally overwhelms a struggling couple . &quot; There ' s a real survival response , and people try to protect what is closest to them , &quot; said Dr. John Freedy , who heads a $ 1.5-million National Institute of Mental Health study on the survivors of five major catastrophes , including hurricanes Andrew and Hugo . &quot; But that could give_way very quickly to depression , frustration and aggression between people if their needs aren ' t being met. &quot; * Consequently , Florida State ' s Figley anticipates that the true effects of Hurricane Andrew on divorcing couples will be felt one to four years from now . &quot; I expect the rates to be much higher later , &quot; he said . &quot; Right now , they ' re still in the recovery stage. &quot; If so , such couples are only beginning to process their disaster experience . The Family Studies Center ' s Shelton identifies four phases that those affected by disaster generally pass_through on their way to recovery . The first , she said , is a joining together in the face of crisis . This is often followed by a period of emotional and physical exhaustion as couples tire of managing the disaster -- and each other . If the couple sticks_together , Shelton said , the next phase is reorganization , in which normal routines are again enjoined in the aftermath of the crisis . Finally , if this is successfully negotiated , couples may experience a renewal in which they gain new understandings from their experience . But because various and often conflicting emotions may be felt by people at different stages of the process , Shelton recommends that couples not make important life decisions until they have gone_through all_the phases toward recovery . &quot; Don ' t ignore your feelings , but don ' t make hasty decisions , &quot; she said , adding that although judgments made in the heat of the moment can end_up to be good ones , time is needed to absorb the impact of catastrophic events . &quot; Disasters do present opportunity for growth. &quot;</TEXT>
