   <HEADLINE> U.N. OFFICIALS IN BOSNIA LASH_OUT AT SERBS ; BALKANS : ANGRY CHARGES COME AFTER REBELS HIJACK FUEL TANKERS , BAN ARMED ESCORTS OF RELIEF CONVOYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.N. Protection Force officials Sunday accused Bosnian Serbs of deliberately undermining their peacekeeping and humanitarian mission after the nationalist rebels hijacked U.N. fuel tankers and banned armed escorts of relief convoys . The incidents were the latest in a monthlong series of humiliations , provocations and sabotage directed at the U.N. mission , which has 24 # 000 troops deployed throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina . Coming at a time when Western nations are seriously considering a pullout of their vulnerable troops , the actions seemed calculated to encourage the international community to leave Bosnia at the rebels ' mercy . Bosnian Serb gunmen surprised Danish military escorts early Sunday at a roadblock near the capital , Sarajevo , chasing most U.N. personnel away at gunpoint and stealing three tankers , mission spokesman Paul Risley said . Two of the drivers refused to leave their vehicles and were hijacked along with the fuel . They were later released . Lt . Col . Jan-Dirk von Merveldt , the U.N. mission ' s Sarajevo spokesman , called the fuel heist &quot; highway robbery and inflamed banditry. &quot; Constant harassment of the mission supply_lines has endangered most U.N. operations in Bosnia . The 400 U.N. troops in the &quot; safe area &quot; of Gorazde have been forced to make dangerous foot patrols to keep_an_eye_on that city , and all armored-vehicle convoy protection was_due to cease this week for lack of fuel even before the Serbian announcement banning military escorts . Shepherding relief convoys into besieged areas of Bosnia is the main task of the U.N. mission , and such a ban would render the presence of most troops meaningless . U.N. troops also are supposed to protect six designated safe areas -- Gorazde , Sarajevo , Srebrenica , Zepa , Tuzla and Bihac . But their presence in those enclaves is largely symbolic and has done little to deter artillery attacks . The Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees has warned that the agency would be unable to deliver food , medicine and shelter supplies to embattled communities without U.N. military escorts across Serbian lines . &quot; This is an unacceptable demand on the part of the Bosnian Serbs , &quot; Risley said . &quot; This indicates an organized attempt by the Bosnian Serbs to create conditions for the continued delivery of humanitarian aid to civilians within their territory but without any UNPROFOR ( U.N. Protection Force ) presence . They are saying they don ' t need UNPROFOR. &quot; That has been the message from the Serbs for weeks as they have grabbed U.N. troops as insurance against further air strikes by the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization and have trapped peacekeepers guarding besieged enclaves . European Union officials who met over the weekend pushed for maintaining the troubled peacekeeping mission as long as possible . But a deadlock in peace negotiations has heightened concerns in troop-contributing countries about the safety of peacekeepers and has escalated moves to pull them out .</TEXT>
