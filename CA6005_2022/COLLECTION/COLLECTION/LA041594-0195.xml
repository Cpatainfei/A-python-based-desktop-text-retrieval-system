   <HEADLINE> GLOBAL TRADE PACT WON ' T BE CHEERED BY ALL IN U.S. ; COMMERCE : TWO PENNSYLVANIA FIRMS EPITOMIZE FEAR OF FOREIGN COMPETITION . ANTI-DUMPING LAWS URGED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and officials of 124 other nations gather_in Morocco today to sign the most far-reaching trade agreement ever written , don ' t expect a hearty cheer to rise with the searing heat of molten steel from the floor of the Bethlehem Steel factory . And don ' t look_for an appreciative nod of gratitude in neighboring Allentown , where the spick-and-span , climate-controlled workrooms of the AT &amp; T microelectronics plant turn 100-pound ingots of silicon into thousands and thousands of computer chips every day . Although Bethlehem and AT &amp; T are at opposite ends of the U.S. industrial spectrum , they have some important things in common : dependence on international sales and stiff competition from foreign manufacturers . And both grumble that the new trade pact will help their foreign rivals and cut_into their own business overseas . Their complaints may_not be serious enough to turn the politically powerful steel and semiconductor industries into sworn opponents of the agreement , initialed by negotiators from every corner of the globe in December after eight years of bitter , divisive talks . But they go_to the heart of trade politics as it is practiced in the 1990s and reflect the narrow , winding path that the Clinton_Administration must follow as it sends to Congress an international trade plan , which , in its vast scope , will dwarf the North_American Free_Trade Agreement -- only narrowly ratified by Congress last autumn . Approval by Congress is the only obstacle still standing_in the way of the global trade agreement . In the end , Congress is widely expected to accept the pact if President Clinton can come_up with a way to make_up for the $ 11 billion or so in import taxes that would be lost over the next five years as a result of tariff reductions . But as the White_House prepares to make its case to the House and Senate , says former Rep . William Frenzel , a Minnesota Republican who helped the Administration guide NAFTA through Congress , &quot; all_of the people with interests at stake are trying to get something better . Even those who will profit enormously are trying to get one more little thing for themselves. &quot; What the steel and semiconductor industries are trying to get is legislation declaring in no uncertain terms that the United States reserves the right to take legal_action against foreign competitors that dump products on the U.S. market at lower cost than they charge at_home . The vehicle for such language would be the bill that Congress passes to implement the new trade pact . Alan Wolfe , a trade lawyer representing the steel and semiconductor industries , said that the precise wording of the implementing bill is crucial . Until the two industries see the bill , he said , they can only say that they conditionally support the international accord . The trade agreement , completed in Geneva , would slash import taxes around the globe , open markets for food and consumer goods and extend the rules of international trade to the growing business of cross-border financial services . From a global standpoint , that means &quot; more trade , more investment , more jobs and larger income growth for all , &quot; said Peter Sutherland , director general of the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , the Geneva-based organization that supervises international trade rules . &quot; Economic operators across the globe will benefit . Producers and consumers , investors and traders everywhere will gain. &quot; In the United States , proponents say , the trade pact would boost the gross_domestic_product -- the measure of the nation ' s goods and services -- by anywhere from $ 100 billion to $ 200 billion , an increase of 1.5 % to 3 % . Although those figures are questioned by some -- economist Thea Lee of the Economic Policy Institute in Washington said such numbers &quot; seem completely outrageous &quot; -- few question that the trade pact will produce a significant increase in global economic activity . And few , if any , industries got everything they wanted from the Geneva negotiations , although some are clear winners . Computer manufacturers , aerospace companies and retailers appear to be among big winners . Pharmaceutical manufacturers , whose patents have been ripped_off by foreign companies , are looking_forward to protection for the fruits of their intellectual labors . The probable losers include such struggling , labor-intensive industries as textile manufacturing , which fears that the loss of protective_tariffs will doom it to extinction in the United States within a generation or less . Somewhere in the middle are semiconductors and steel . Bethlehem Steel , despite converting to a high-tech , robot-dependent operation , represents the heart of U.S. industrial history , where strong-muscled men work amid flame , smoke and the roar of blast_furnaces operating at 2 # 300 degrees Fahrenheit . AT &amp; T ' s semiconductor plant , barely five miles to the west , represents the clean , new industry born_out of U.S. creativity and a swiftly growing demand for computer-driven machinery around the world . For all their differences , the steel and computer chip manufacturers agree that the new rules of international trade will strip away their protection against foreign products that are dumped on the U.S. market at_a_loss ( to drive U.S. competitors out of business ) or at prices subsidized by foreign governments . The U.S. steel_industry is worried that it will be cheated out of the fruits of the last decade of wrenching adjustment as it modernized its plants and shed thousands of jobs . &quot; Today we are the low-cost , high-quality producer in the market , &quot; Bethlehem Chairman Curtis H . Barnette said in an interview . Dumping has little impact on consumers , reducing the average_cost of a car by no more_than $ 12 , U.S. steel_companies maintain . But it can kill U.S. companies that must drop their prices to meet the foreign competition . Frenzel , for one , is unsympathetic . &quot; The complaints of the steel_companies have been echoing through the corridors of Congress for almost as long as we ' ve been making steel , &quot; said Frenzel , now a guest scholar at Washington ' s Brookings Institution . If the trade agreement makes_it easier for steel manufacturers to file anti-dumping suits , he said , the chief effect will be to shelter them from competition -- a sure-fire formula for industrial flabbiness . As for the U.S. semiconductor industry , it has been battling the Japanese practically ever since scientists launched the modern electronics revolution by learning to etch complicated circuits on tiny silicon_chips . In the mid-1980s , the vertical conglomerates in Japan that produced a particular semiconductor known as a dynamic random-access_memory chip flooded the U.S. market with their tiny products priced at below cost . To fight_back , Micron Semiconductor of Boise , Ida. , cut its work_force in half , cut salaries and eliminated benefits , Chairman Steven R . Appleton said in a recent appearance before the Senate Finance_Committee . &quot; We had state-of-the-art technology , high-quality , low-cost manufacturing and a dedicated work_force , and yet we could not contend with Japanese prices , &quot; he said . In the end , the Japanese prices were low enough to knock nine of 11 U.S. companies out of this segment of the market , which the Japanese companies now dominate . It was only through eventual lawsuits filed under U.S. anti-dumping legislation that Micron was able to fight_back , now employing more_than 5 # 000 people at restored wages and benefits , Appleton said . &quot; A major . . . goal of Japan and its satellites was weakening anti-dumping enforcement , &quot; Appleton told the committee . &quot; We will not allow this to happen . In drafting implementing legislation , this committee must adopt the standard that U.S. law be as strong as the new code permits. &quot; The alterations in the international anti-dumping codes are written in the arcane , technical language of trade law dealing with pricing , production_costs , standards of complaints and profits . &quot; The litigators describe it as death by a_thousand cuts . The cumulative effect of all_the small technical changes make_it extremely difficult to file an anti-dumping case , &quot; said Daryl Hatano , vice_president for international trade and government affairs of the Semiconductor Industry Assn . Still , said John Boidock , executive_director of the Alliance for GATT Now , a multi-industry lobbying group , satisfactory legislation can protect the semiconductor and steel_industries . In Allentown , that means the 3 # 000 workers at the AT &amp; T microelectronics plant can continue turning_out thousands of chips destined for answering machines , cellular_telephones and telephone switching networks . And in Bethlehem , where the steelwork ' s employment is down to 3 # 500 from about 10 # 000 in the early 1980s , 1 million tons of steel will continue to roll_out of the mills each year .</TEXT>
