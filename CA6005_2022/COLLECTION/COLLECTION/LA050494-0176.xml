   <HEADLINE> JURY QUICKLY DECIDES GUILT IN MURDER OF HONORS STUDENT ; COURTS : TEEN-AGER IS CONVICTED FOR ORCHESTRATING THE DEATH OF AN ORANGE COUNTY 17-YEAR-OLD WHO HAD BEEN TORTURED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A jury took less than three hours Tuesday to find a teen-ager guilty of first-degree murder for orchestrating the 1992 New Year ' s Eve ambush murder of an Orange County honors student . Robert Chan , 19 , a onetime candidate for class valedictorian , faces life in prison without parole for his role in the killing of Stuart A . Tay of Orange . The 17-year-old was beaten , forced to drink rubbing alcohol and buried in a shallow grave in a Buena Park back yard . Chan was one of five teen-agers charged in the slaying . Two are awaiting trial , a third has pleaded guilty and , in a surprise move , a fourth pleaded guilty Tuesday . Mun Bong Kang , now 19 , admitted guilt because he wanted to spare Tay ' s parents the ordeal of another trial , his attorney said . Jurors agreed with the prosecution ' s contention that Chan sealed his conviction when he testified that he knew the killing was wrong , but still joined four other teen-agers in killing Tay . &quot; I was surprised at how fast the verdict took , but there was really nothing to decide , &quot; said juror Ulla Laing of Huntington Beach . &quot; He got_on the witness_stand and said he did_it and he knew what he was doing . It ' s like the prosecutor said -- he convicted himself. &quot; The prosecution alleged that Chan masterminded the murder because he believed Tay was about to double-cross him in a plan to rob an Anaheim computer parts dealer . Tay was lured to a Buena Park garage , where he was beaten unconscious with baseball_bats and forced to drink rubbing alcohol before his nose and mouth were sealed with duct tape . Chan , who has been diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic , told jurors he assisted in murdering Tay because he believed the teen-ager had rigged Chan ' s Fullerton home with explosives and was about to kill him unless stopped . But one juror , who asked that his name not be used , said the jury easily rejected Chan ' s defense . &quot; Even if we wanted to give him a break , our conscience would n ' t let us , &quot; the juror said . &quot; He was not ( mentally unstable ) . He knew what he was doing. &quot; The case gained widespread attention as a symbol of juvenile crime out of control , and because both teen-agers came from seemingly model homes . Chan was a top student at Sunny Hills High_School in Fullerton and his IQ hovered near genius level . Tay , who attended Foothill High_School in Santa Ana , aspired to become a physician like his father . Tay ' s mother , Linda , said she was grateful that the jury saw_through Chan ' s defense . &quot; I did expect a very early verdict because the facts were clear , &quot; she said . &quot; Even the best carpenter cannot build a house without wood , &quot; she added , referring to the fact that Chan had a prominent Orange County attorney representing him . Chan ' s parents were devastated . &quot; I just want to say this is a tragedy for everyone , &quot; said Tony Chan , a Fullerton engineer who said his son bears responsibility in the killing but questioned whether he received a fair trial . &quot; I didn ' t say he ' s innocent , but a lot of things Mr. D.A. says is not correct. &quot; As jurors began deliberating Chan ' s fate Tuesday , Kang pleaded guilty to first-degree murder for assisting in the ambush attack . His parents had urged the plea , said defense_attorney Ronald G . Brower , who represents Kang . &quot; They wanted to do the honorable thing , &quot; Brower said . &quot; They and their son hope this act will in some small way convey their true feelings and the shame they feel . They pray daily for God to ease the suffering of the Tay family. &quot; Orange County Superior_Court Judge Kathleen E . O ' Leary has not set a date for sentencing , at which time she will decide whether Kang , who was a juvenile at the time of the killing , will be sent to state_prison or the California Youth Authority . Jury selection began Tuesday for the remaining two co-defendants : Abraham Acosta , 17 , of Buena Park and Kirn Young Kim , 18 , of Fullerton . Judge O ' Leary dismissed the majority of the prospective jurors , saying she was concerned that information about the verdict would taint their objectivity .</TEXT>
