   <HEADLINE> THE WEEK AHEAD : PASADENA ; CELESTIAL SPECTACULAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Astronomers around the world will strain Saturday for a glimpse of a rare celestial event : the collision between a comet and the planet Jupiter . Several hundred scientists from the Jet_Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena will be involved , including those working with the Galileo spacecraft , which will have the closest view of the event . For five days , a stream of 21 mountain-sized fragments that form the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 will streak into the giant planet ' s atmosphere . Scientists aren ' t sure what will be visible to Earth-based observatories . But they hope for an interplanetary light show that will yield new insights into celestial cataclysms that have scarred the planets of the solar_system over the eons and , on Earth , may have wiped_out the dinosaurs 65 million years ago .</TEXT>
