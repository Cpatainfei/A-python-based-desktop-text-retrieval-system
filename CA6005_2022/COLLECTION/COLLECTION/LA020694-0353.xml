   <TEXT> The rumbling , rocking_and_rolling from the Northridge earthquake still hasn ' t stopped -- and neither have the incessant questions asked of local residents from frantic friends and relatives around the world : * &quot; What does an earthquake of that magnitude feel_like ? &quot; Since the 6.6 temblor struck -- followed by countless aftershocks from mere shimmers to real shakers -- survivors across the San Fernando Valley and elsewhere have used a colorful , often dread-inspired lexicon to describe the quake that hit literally beneath their feet . And it wasn ' t just their proximity to the fault_line that figured prominently in the earthquake experience of many residents . It was the backgrounds they brought_to the event that also colored their tales . Several East Coast transplants compared the trembling to being_on the platform of a major subway_station , feeling the frightening force of a train 10 sizes too big coming at them , refusing to stop . &quot; It was like Boom ! Boom ! Boom ! &quot; said native New Yorker Elizabeth Teicher , whose Encino condominium was condemned after the quake . &quot; It was one subway_train after another . It was terrible. &quot; Coastal dwellers used terms that applied to their own world : Many described the earth ' s movement as like riding a surfboard in their bedrooms , their house feeling the ebb and flow of a major ocean wave . Small children described monsters -- like those that might crawl out from under their beds at night -- picking_up their homes and shaking everything inside . From the religious community came descriptions such_as the &quot; hand of God reaching down &quot; to rattle houses , lives and nerves . &quot; People draw from their own pasts to describe even the newest of traumas , &quot; said Dr. Peter Swerdlick , a psychiatrist and medical director of the San Fernando Valley Treatment Center for Anxieties . &quot; Fear makes them think , sometimes even more creatively . And many people are still afraid . I have patients who are still rushing their bowel_movements because they ' re afraid the next quake is going_to catch them on the toilet. &quot; Some survivors described feeling like Dorothy in &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; when her entire house took its fantastic flight . Still others described a house possessed , kitchen cupboards flying_open , emptying their contents onto linoleum floors , some of which became flooded with a soupy mixture of Jack Daniels , vinegar and hot_sauce . Those who were awake when the 4:31 a.m. quake hit described the weird sensation of at first hearing the rumble , like a clap of thunder or herd of animals thundering toward them on an open plain . Then the room began to shake with a topsy-turvy , up-and-down , back-and-forth , frenzy , the mayhem getting stronger and stronger , reaching its unsettling peak before finally easing_off a seeming eternity later . Others said they felt_like they were punched_in the darkness . They felt the quake was only happening to them , not millions of others around them as well . There were other images -- some terrible , some as manic and breathless as describing a roller_coaster ride in the dark : &quot; It felt_like a truck had smashed into the side of our house , &quot; said several residents who lived near the quake ' s epicenter . At least one Van Nuys resident said he wasn ' t sure if he was being jolted by an earthquake or whether it was indeed World_War III unleashed upon the land -- Armageddon at last . &quot; You know those movies , those re-creations of atomic blasts ? &quot; he said . &quot; Well , that ' s exactly what was going_through my mind. &quot; Indeed , in the aftermath of the quake , images of the war ' s destruction were impressed upon the minds of many people . In the days following the Jan . 17 natural disaster , amazed state geologists reported that the Northridge temblor may have shaken the ground far more violently for a sustained period than any earthquake ever recorded . Scientists who measured the quake said instruments on the ground found that the earth moved with extraordinary force -- far more_than they previously believed possible in a 6.6 magnitude quake . Indeed , the force was enough to collapse apartment_buildings like concrete pancakes . At one local hospital , a patient undergoing stomach surgery at the time of the initial quake was thrown from the operating table and disconnected from this anesthesia . As the lights went_out , panicked doctors scrambled to replace the man on the table and immediately abort the surgery . Dr. William Bakun , geophysicist for U.S. Geological Survey , said several reasons accounted_for the violent shaking , in addition to the fact that this was a major quake hitting directly beneath a metropolitan area . Rather than fault_lines moving against one another , this temblor had one side moving_up and over the opposing fault_line , resulting in the up-and-down movement , he said . &quot; This earthquake had very large vertical accelerations , which lasted several seconds . that ' s unusual . We ' ve never recorded them , &quot; he said . &quot; As a result , the ground is moving_up and down , rather than just side to side . That might explain some of the characterizations of this event because they were sensations that few of us had ever felt before. &quot; An earthquake ' s trembling can be likened to a rock being thrown into a pool of water . The people nearest the epicenter feel the most violent jolt , as though they are part of the water being displaced by the rock . Then the trembling travels away from the epicenter like the waves moving away from the spot where the rock hit the water . It ' s for this reason , scientists say , that people farther away from the quake ' s source feel only a slight rolling motion -- one that decreases over distance , like the waves in a pool . &quot; However , the makeup of the earth isn ' t static like the water in that description , &quot; Bakun said . &quot; There are rock formations that distort the spread of the energy , blocking it , sending it in different directions , sometimes back on itself -- which is why the shaking is a very unpredictable thing. &quot; Experts say the reason people believe they can hear an earthquake coming is that the temblor sends_off sound_waves that travel faster than the motion of the ground . But while most people can articulate what they feel during an earthquake , one quake consultant and author says they don ' t always exactly know what it is they ' re describing . &quot; Many people are confused between the concepts of magnitude and intensity -- especially journalists , &quot; said Peter Yanev , chairman of EQE International , a firm that consults in earthquake risk analysis , and author of the 1974 real_estate guide &quot; Piece of Mind in Earthquake Country. &quot; &quot; I recently described it this way to a business reporter : The magnitude is the Dow Jones average of the entire event . The intensity is how your individual stock did that day , or what you felt in_relation_to how far you were from the epicenter. &quot; Kate Hutton , a seismologist at Caltech , said scientists are obviously more technical in their descriptions of quakes and instead find themselves counting silently to measure the length of the event . At the Oxnard Street Elementary School in North Hollywood , they don ' t bother counting -- they head right for the space beneath their desks . All week , teachers at the school drilled students in earthquake response . Some described the quake to rock-music-crazy students as &quot; the Earth doing the twist. &quot; Like Cold_War children from an earlier era , they practiced scrambling under desks and covering their heads , some taking the exercise as a joke , others with worried looks in their eyes . &quot; My mother told me that Mother Nature was responsible_for all this damage , &quot; first-grader Travis Lamm said . &quot; But I don ' t even know who Mother Nature is. &quot; In many classrooms , children drew their impressions of the quake . Some drew volcanoes ripping through the ground . Others colored monsters breaking freeways in half , or trees ripped_out by their roots . With the caption &quot; See the earthquake ! It moves things ! &quot; Lamm drew a chaotic scene of both cars and people being swept into the air and buildings cracking . At the top of the illustration appeared an image no doubt appreciated by both surviving child and adult alike the day the big quake hit : The sun was weeping . Tears streamed down its face .</TEXT>
