   <HEADLINE> I DON ' T LIKE BEING IN LOVE , BY SANDRA CISNEROS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Not like this . Not tonight , a white stone . When you ' re 36 and seething like sixteen next to the telephone , and you don ' t know where . And worse -- with whom ? I don ' t care_for this fruit . This Mexican love hidden in the boot . This knotted braid . Birthcord buried beneath the knuckle of the heart . Cat at the window scratching at the windswept moon scurrying along , scurrying along . Rattling trees . Screen_doors banging raspy . Brain a whorl of swirling fish . Oh , I don ' t like this . I don ' t like this . From &quot; Loose Woman &quot; by Sandra Cisneros . ( Knopf : $ 16. ) 1994 Reprinted by permission .</TEXT>
