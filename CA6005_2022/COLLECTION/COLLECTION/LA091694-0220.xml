   <HEADLINE> LAME-DUCK LEAGUE ; THE ONCE-PROUD SOUTHWEST CONFERENCE WILL CEASE TO EXIST BY SUMMER OF 1996</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How does a conference die ? More easily than you think . For the Southwest Conference , the end came painfully , convincingly and perhaps unnecessarily . The conference that gave college football 99 consensus All-American selections , 13 Hall_of_Fame coaches , six wire-service national champions , five Heisman Trophy winners and one infamous victim of the NCAA death_penalty will cease to exist_by the summer of 1996 , the first major conference to perish in the new sports order . SWC headquarters are a virtual ghost_town . Only 11 staff_members , including interns , remain on payroll . There isn ' t much to do except count the days , update resumes and wonder what happened to a league that lasted 80 years and then suffered a coronary . &quot; We ' re small and getting smaller , &quot; said Commissioner Steve Hatchell , who left his job as Orange Bowl executive_director to run the league in January , 1993 . Someone will have to turn_off the lights . If it isn ' t Hatchell , who ' s busy trying to find a home for the conference archives , maybe the SWC can enlist Don Meredith , the former Southern Methodist quarterback , who always knew exactly when the party was over . Frank Windegger , longtime athletic director at Texas Christian , was sitting in the dentist ' s chair not long ago when his doctor inquired about the availability of Horned Frog mementos . Windegger felt a pain -- not in his tooth but in his heart . &quot; I ' ve been around this league for 40 years now , &quot; he told the dentist . &quot; Why don ' t you just hang my rear_end on the wall and you ' ll have all_the tradition and mementos you need. &quot; This is hard for Windegger and everyone else who grew_up with the SWC . Somehow this league went from Dana X . Bible , to John W . Heisman , to Sammy Baugh , to Jess Neely , to Bobby Layne , to Raymond Berry , to Bear Bryant , to John David Crow , to Darrell Royal , to Frank Broyles , to Tommy Nobis , to James Street , to Earl Campbell , to Bill Yeoman , to Eric Dickerson , to Ken Hatfield , to Andre Ware , to John Mackovic . . . to oblivion . Just like that . &quot; Tradition dies_hard , &quot; said Windegger . &quot; Something 80 years old , you hope that tradition means something. &quot; It meant nothing . Instead , the SWC is a memory-in-waiting . Here ' s how it happened : DOMINO NO . 1 THE MONOPOLY ENDS For nearly half a century , the SWC cornered the Texas football market . Saturdays belonged_to Davey O ' Brien , Doak Walker , Kyle Rote and John David Crow . Sundays belonged_to the Baptist and Methodist worship services , followed by chicken and corn bread dinners . Then pro football , which had made sporadic and unsuccessful visits , came_back . And stayed . The NFL ' s Cowboys began playing in Dallas in 1960 , as did the AFL ' s Oilers in Houston . Suddenly SMU , TCU , Houston and Rice found themselves in direct competition with the emerging TV darling , pro football . &quot; We have time and we have money and it ' s how we spend the two that determines things , &quot; said Fred Jacoby , SWC commissioner from 1982-93 . The SWC began to see an erosion of some of its fan support and income . It was subtle at first , but it was also irreversible , especially when major_league baseball , the NBA and , years later , the NHL were granted franchises in SWC strongholds such_as Dallas and Houston . People had time and money , but they didn ' t have time and money for both the SWC and , say , the NFL . Someone had to take_a_hit . Guess who ? DOMINO NO . 2 HATE THY BROTHER Nine teams . . . eight of them located deep in the heart of Texas . There wasn ' t -- and still isn ' t -- another conference like it , where county_lines and city_limits determined such fierce allegiances , where four private_schools -- Rice , SMU , TCU and Baylor -- mingled with four state universities . Look_at a map . Texas A &amp; M is 80 miles from Texas and Baylor , 90 miles from Houston and Rice , 155 miles from TCU and SMU . The football claustrophobia led to rivalries that escalated into mini-wars . &quot; I don ' t think it ' s that complicated , &quot; said Hatchell , who did what he could to rescue the league before running_out of time . &quot; I think the eight schools in one state really hurt . The focus wasn ' t one of change , the focus was tearing_into each other. &quot; There was pride at stake . No self-respecting Aggie wanted to be outdone by a Texas_Longhorn . No SMU grad wanted to see the Horned Frogs steal the headlines . Corners were cut . Rules were broken . Recruiting became a sacred mission . &quot; I ' ve been told by people who have been around this area for a long_time that when college recruiting became cutthroat , sometime in the ' 60s , that ' s when we lost some friendships and loyalties , &quot; said Bill Lively , SMU ' s interim athletic director . &quot; I think he ' s right. &quot; Making matters worse was the absence of any central authority . The SWC didn ' t have a full-time commissioner ( then known as an executive_secretary ) until 1945 , 30 years after the conference was formed . James Stewart held the position until 1950 and then was succeeded by Howard Grubbs . Grubbs was followed in 1973 by Cliff Speegle , who was followed in 1982 by Jacoby , who was succeeded by Hatchell . For the most part , though , Stewart , Grubbs and Speegle were caretakers . They couldn ' t or would n ' t stop the back-stabbing so prevalent in the ultra-competitive league . Even Jacoby ' s tenure was held to a penetrating light . &quot; For a long_time things just rocked along , &quot; said Texas A &amp; M Coach R.C. Slocum . &quot; I didn ' t see us taking a strong leadership role at the conference office level . In ( the Big Eight and Pacific 10 ) those leagues always have had very strong conference offices. &quot; DOMINO NO . 3 SCANDAL The recruiting wars reached their zenith and the SWC reached its nadir from 1983-88 , the days of scandal and controversy . Free_enterprise was alive and well as high_school stars made their back-room deals with assorted SWC alumni and boosters . Some of the deals were made with the knowledge and blessings of the coaches , who watched either happily or helplessly as the cheating reached almost comical proportions . In some cases , players weren ' t recruited as much as auctioned . Jacoby was there when the explosion blew the situation out of control . &quot; It was pervasive at that time , &quot; he said . &quot; It was plugging the dam every place you could. &quot; By the time the leaks were contained , SMU ' s program had received the NCAA ' s death_penalty . TCU was_on probation . Texas , Baylor , Houston , Texas A &amp; M and Texas Tech all eventually were found guilty of violating major or minor NCAA rules . It was a public relations apocalypse . Among the penalties and trickle-down effects : fewer TV appearances and less TV revenue , fewer bowl appearances , one fewer program -- SMU ' s -- to generate income for the conference , reduced attendance and , of course , the Exodus . DOMINO NO . 4 SEE YOU LATER As the number of sanctions against SWC programs increased , so did the number of out-of-state recruiters venturing into the region for players . Texas always had been a fertile place for high_school talent , but rarely did a player cross state_lines . If he did , it was usually to Oklahoma or Arkansas . &quot; The scandals created an atmosphere where the out-of-state schools could come_in and paint a bleak picture of the league , &quot; said Slocum . &quot; And the schools here just kept hammering each other. &quot; Recruits left the state in droves , to Nebraska , Colorado , Michigan , Florida State , Miami , Notre Dame and UCLA , among others . &quot; It was really disappointing , &quot; said Slocum . &quot; Once the perception was out there . . . kids were led to believe that the best thing to do was to get_out of here . &quot; It ' s been very difficult breaking that perception . In the last five , seven , eight years the No . 1 thing I ' ve had to do_in the ( recruit ' s ) home was defend the Southwest Conference . Most of the other coaches in the country don ' t have to do that . The Pac-10 doesn ' t have to defend the league . The Big Eight doesn ' t . But the No . 1 thing I had to do was go_in there and convince them that we were playing in a good conference. &quot; DOMINO NO . 5 THE COTTON BOWL Turn_on the Rose Bowl telecast and you see sun . Fiesta Bowl . . . sun . Orange Bowl . . . moon over warm Miami . Turn_on the Cotton Bowl , you often see heaters on the sideline . Players wearing mittens . Rain . Cold . Misery . &quot; I think the Cotton Bowl hurt the league , &quot; said a high-ranking SWC official who requested anonymity . &quot; Up through the mid-70s , the Cotton Bowl was a big deal . Now it isn ' t . Here ' s the Cotton Bowl , in the cold of Dallas -- that hurt it. &quot; So did a string of poor luck . The Cotton Bowl hasn ' t had a national championship game since 1977 , when fifth-ranked Notre Dame defeated top-ranked Texas . DOMINO NO . 6 NOTRE DAME GOES ITS WAY Of the 64 members of the once powerful College Football Assn. , none was more valued than Notre Dame , the great football cash_cow . But on Feb . 5 , 1990 , Notre Dame announced it was leaving the CFA to make its own deal with NBC . According to terms of the agreement , NBC would retain exclusive_rights for telecasts of Irish home_games from 1991-95 ( later extended through 2000 ) . Notre Dame would get $ 38 million for the first five years and a comparably generous figure for the extension , too . Notre Dame ' s sudden departure , along with a Federal Trade Commission investigation into possible CFA antitrust violations , forced conferences to reassess their television marketability . &quot; When Notre Dame pulled_out of the CFA package , that was kind of the first_step of what happened to the breakup of the CFA . . . and this conference , &quot; said TCU ' s Windegger . &quot; The needy and the greedy , that ' s what the NCAA has turned into. &quot; DOMINO NO . 7 BROYLES PULLS THE PLUG Arkansas , an original member of the SWC and a 13-time conference champion , defected in 1990 and joined the Southeastern Conference in time for the 1992 season . Orchestrating the move was Athletic Director Frank Broyles , who had coached Arkansas to seven of those titles . In the time it took_for the Arkansas Board of Trustees to cast their historic vote on Aug . 1 , 1990 , the SWC lost one of its highest-profile members , to say nothing of a consistent money maker . Arkansas won games , drew well , got_on television , went_to bowl games and put cash_in the conference account . Now the Razorbacks were gone , leaving Jacoby to wonder what if . &quot; From July 1990 , I tried to encourage the conference to expand , &quot; he said . &quot; The ( SWC ) presidents said not to talk to any schools in ( other ) conferences . What you ' re left to select from are schools up and down the Mississippi River. &quot; Jacoby said he pushed to invite Memphis and Louisville . Both schools had nationally recognized basketball programs and emerging football programs . &quot; But I was blocked every time I tried to make a move , &quot; Jacoby said . &quot; That really hurt us because we had a chance to expand . Both of those programs were in the top 40 TV markets. &quot; As the SWC stood_still , the SEC added Arkansas and South Carolina . Penn State went_to the Big Ten . Other leagues began to position themselves for the inevitable Big Bang . Meanwhile , the SWC had become confined to the state of Texas . It was a geographical hostage and it was the league ' s own fault . &quot; The departure of Arkansas opened the door , &quot; said SMU ' s Lively . &quot; Somebody had to do that first , and Arkansas was the one. &quot; DOMINO NO . 8 THE RUMORS Arkansas was the first , but supposedly not the last SWC member interested in bolting . Texas was interested in the Pac-10 , Texas A &amp; M was interested in the SEC . Those schools wanted out because they were upset with the prospects for the SWC ' s future . Attendance was spotty at Rice , SMU , TCU and Houston . Facilities were lacking . Revenue sharing remained a sore point . &quot; It was just a bad deal for everyone , &quot; Slocum said . In short , Texas and Texas A &amp; M , the two marquee names , felt they were doing all_the heavy financial lifting . Not true , said Jacoby . The former SWC commissioner said revenue distribution in the conference was adjusted so that the Aggies and Longhorns , who drew large home crowds , would retain a higher percentage of their gate receipts . The formula to distribute TV money also was adjusted in favor of Texas and Texas A &amp; M . &quot; We were trying to reward them , &quot; Jacoby said . Jim Wacker remembers the mess . The former TCU coach , who now is at Minnesota , was appalled by the greed . &quot; that ' s what happened with Arkansas , Texas and Texas A &amp; M , &quot; he said . &quot; They kept demanding more and more and more of the money . Their stick kept getting bigger and bigger and everyone else ' s stick kept getting smaller and smaller . It ultimately tore ( the conference ) apart. &quot; And don ' t mention the Texas and Texas A &amp; M concerns to Windegger of TCU . He remembers a different era , with different haves and have nots . &quot; There were days when the SMUs , Rices and TCUs of the world were carrying Texas and A &amp; M , too , &quot; he said . &quot; A &amp; M is the one on probation . They just can ' t point at SMU. &quot; DOMINO NO . 9 THE ONE-TWO PUNCH Enacted in 1972 , Title IX legislation ordered , among other things , that schools receiving federal funds couldn ' t discriminate on the basis of gender . From Title IX came an increase in the number of varsity athletic programs available for women . Years later came gender equity . And from gender equity came the realization that equality costs lots of money . &quot; Title IX is the law , &quot; said Grant Teaff , a former Baylor coach and athletic director who once served on the NCAA ' s gender equity task_force . &quot; Gender equity is somewhere above the law , depending_on whose agenda you are looking at. &quot; For the SWC , the agenda was simple : Obey the law . So conference members began adding more women ' s sports and scholarships , at_the_same_time adding strain on their operating_budgets . Someone had to pay the bills , which was why athletic directors tried to squeeze more money out of football , one of the few sports capable of producing the revenue to bankroll the other programs . As dollars became more precious , the pressure to produce winning , profitable football programs became more acute . Victories meant higher attendance , more TV appearance fees , more bowl income and increased alumni donations . Losses got you red ink . And sometimes a pink_slip . Something had to give . In the end , it was the SWC . &quot; It ' s like the Soviet_Union , &quot; said Houston Athletic Director Bill Carr . &quot; The ultimate reason for change was not simply ideology , it was economics . When the numbers don ' t work , things change. &quot; DOMINO NO . 10 BLACK ROCK LOSES THE NFL The New York offices of CBS are known as &quot; Black Rock. &quot; If Windegger had been there the day the Fox network outbid CBS for the rights to the NFC , he might have jumped from a window . &quot; When CBS lost NFL football , I took a big gulp that day , &quot; he said . &quot; When they lost that , that left CBS with a lot of dollars. &quot; Added Jacoby : &quot; A black day in college athletics. &quot; Desperately in need of sports programming , CBS went_on a buying spree . The network bought the rights to SEC basketball and football and later did the same with the Big East Conference . &quot; A whole_lot of shaking and baking , &quot; said Windegger . In essence , the CFA was dead . It was every conference for itself . The Atlantic Coast Conference , the Big Eight and the Western Athletic Conference signed with ABC , which already had the Pac-10 and the Big Ten . The SWC was left without a safety net . According to Jacoby , the SWC had spent nearly three years working_on an alliance with the Big Eight . But when the CFA collapsed , people panicked -- or lied -- and the alliance never happened . Instead , Texas , Texas A &amp; M , Baylor and Texas Tech joined the Big Eight ( soon to be Big 12 ) , while Rice , SMU and TCU scurried to join the WAC , all effective for the 1996-97 season . Houston has yet to decide on a conference . &quot; It popped us like a bomb , &quot; said Windegger , whose school , along with Rice , SMU , and Houston weren ' t invited to the Big Eight . &quot; We should have been a little more progressive . We could have played that game and brought_in four of them. &quot; And this from Houston ' s Carr : &quot; It was not a result of rational and open discussion . The moving_vans came_in the middle of the night . I don ' t say that with rancor , that ' s just the way it is. &quot; SMU ' s Lively had a different perspective . The short version : The SWC screwed_up -- again . &quot; We might have been a bit naive , &quot; he said of the negotiations with the Big Eight . &quot; We were probably naive in thinking we didn ' t have a problem down here . There were schools with an option and it was only a matter of time before they took it. &quot; EPILOGUE Who would have ever thought it : The SWC -- the Lame_Duck League . &quot; I grew_up in this state , &quot; said Slocum . &quot; I remember watching the games as a little kid . I coached in this league for 20 years . &quot; It was a great , glorious chapter , when it was a chapter . Now there ' s another chapter. &quot; But you know what they say about sequels . Never as_good_as the original .</TEXT>
