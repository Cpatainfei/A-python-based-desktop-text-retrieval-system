   <HEADLINE> MANY DRUG CRIMINALS IN FEDERAL PRISONS FOUND NOT TO BE VIOLENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than one in five federal prisoners are low-level drug criminals with no record of violence and no involvement in sophisticated criminal activity , according to a Justice_Department study released Friday . The study was ordered by Atty . Gen . Janet Reno to see if the growing use of mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes was wasting space in overcrowded federal prisons that she felt could be_better used for violent , repeat criminals . The study found that 16 # 316 prisoners , or 21.5 % of federal inmates , have no current or prior violence on their records , no involvement in sophisticated criminal activity and no previous prison time . The study , produced by the office of Deputy Atty . Gen . Philip B . Heymann , the Bureau of Prisons and selected U.S. attorneys , offered no recommendations . But it noted that it costs $ 20 # 000 a year to house a federal inmate . &quot; Some might argue that these resources could be used more efficiently to promote other criminal justice needs , such_as providing more money for additional police in our communities , &quot; the report said . It offered these findings about the petty offenders : * Their average sentences are 2 1 / 2 times longer than before sentencing guidelines and the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act imposed mandatory minimum sentences for drug and weapons crimes . * Two out of three received mandatory minimum sentences . * A total of 42.3 % were couriers or played peripheral roles in drug trafficking . * Length of prison time had no effect on whether they returned to crime . &quot; At least for the low-level defendants , a short prison sentence is just as likely to deter them from future offending as a long prison sentence. &quot; The report noted that long sentences &quot; do serve important criminal justice goals , such_as retribution and incapacitation &quot; and may promote general deterrence . On the other hand , it said , they &quot; may diminish the value of long sentences for crimes considered more serious , such_as those involving violence , &quot; and undermine the deterrent value of long sentences for violent crimes . There are proposals in Congress to provide a &quot; safety_valve &quot; to give judges a way around mandatory minimums in certain cases where they appear too severe . The Clinton_Administration has offered modest support for this concept .</TEXT>
