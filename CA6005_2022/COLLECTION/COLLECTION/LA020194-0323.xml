   <HEADLINE> FITNESS / KATHLEEN DOHENY : ENERGY BARS DRAW EVERYDAY EXERCISERS , TOO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Read the label on an energy bar -- those healthy snacks designed to get you through grueling workouts -- and you can feel almost invincible . Words such_as performance , power and energy are plastered on the wrappings . Long favored by endurance athletes ( and touted by some big-name athletes ) , energy bars are also attracting everyday exercisers . that ' s partly due_to a glut of new brands and strategic ads suggesting what ' s good for the elite might help the rest of us , too . Energy bars can have a place in an exerciser ' s diet but can also be overkill , dietitians say . And there ' s nothing magical about them , the experts say . The same effect can be had with everyday foods , usually for less than the $ 1 to $ 2 charged for most energy bars . Here ' s some information to chew on before you face the smorgasbord of choices . Solving the Taste Bud Problem : Palatability has been a sore point , even among dedicated energy-bar eaters -- who describe the taste as somewhere between cardboard and taffy gone_bad . But that ' s passe , or so manufacturers claim , with a new emphasis on flavors . The Formula : The common_denominator for energy bars is a high-carbohydrate recipe that is low in fat to provide as much energy as possible . Fat intake should be kept to a minimum before exercise because it slows the transit time of food through the system , says Ellen Coleman , a Riverside dietitian and author of &quot; Eating for Endurance. &quot; Many energy bars get only about 8 % to 10 % of calories from fat , with the majority of calories from carbohydrates , followed by protein . Each bar is fortified with vitamins and minerals . The shelf_life is six months or more . The Market : In the past few years , several brands have debuted . Some have already come and gone . A sampling of what ' s still around : * PowerBar , in four flavors . Apple-Cinnamon , for example , weighs 2.25 ounces , has 225 calories and two grams of fat . * Deer Valley McHenergy Bar , sold only by phone from Deer Valley Resort ( ( 800 ) 424-3337 ) , weighs 2.5 ounces , has 260 calories and 1.4 grams of fat , pastry chef Letty Flatt says . * The Clif ( CQ ) Bar , apricot variety , weighs 2.4 ounces , has 250 calories and no refined sugars , wheat or dairy_products . * FinHalsa weighs 1.7 ounces , has 170 calories and two grams of fat . * Trail Hiker , sold at ski resorts and by phone ( ( 800 ) 234-7669 ) , weighs 1.5 ounces , has 110 calories and no fat . Who Needs Them : Energy bars are ideal for exercisers involved in endurance activities , generally defined as an hour or more , Coleman says . &quot; The average Joe going_out jogging four miles probably doesn ' t need these , &quot; adds Alicia Moag-Stahlberg , a Chicago dietitian and spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Assn . The bars can come_in_handy , though , Coleman says , as convenient meal replacements if you are short of time . They can beat a fatty burger if you are trying to eat something before a workout . When To Eat Them : Don ' t eat these bars too close to exercise time , or you may end_up with less energy as your body works to digest them . &quot; It ' s best to eat them 60 to 90 minutes before working_out , &quot; says Martin Yadrick , a Manhattan Beach dietitian specializing in sports nutrition . &quot; The more solid the bars are , and the more fiber , the longer before exercising you should eat them , &quot; he says . That will allow digestion to proceed so that once you begin exercising , blood flow can be diverted from your gut to your working muscles . Coleman suggests one-hour eating intervals to replenish energy during an endurance activity . Suppose you are heading out for a three-hour bike ride ? &quot; At the end of the first hour , start eating a half-bar an hour. &quot; Drinking water or sports drinks with the bars is highly recommended and is even advised on some labels to aid digestion . Label Reading : Look_for bars low in fat . And don ' t buy something that only looks_like an energy bar . Some bars sold alongside energy bars are actually &quot; nutrition bars , &quot; meant as healthier alternatives to candy_bars , not pre-workout munchies . The fat grams are the clue : Some nutrition bars have seven grams of fat , but most energy bars have half that or fewer . &quot; Don ' t buy an ( energy ) bar that has more_than three grams of fat , &quot; Moag-Stahlberg says . Alternatives : Other foods can help exercisers maintain energy through a workout and probably save money to boot , dietitians say . Good alternatives , Moag-Stahlberg says , are a banana , a bagel or both . Rice cakes , corn_cakes or low-fat yogurt are other good choices , Coleman adds , along with &quot; any food predominantly grain or fruit. &quot;</TEXT>
