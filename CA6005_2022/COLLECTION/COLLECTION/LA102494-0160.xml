   <HEADLINE> LAGUNA ' S FIRE VICTIMS FARE WELL ON INSURANCE ; RECOVERY : WHILE SOME CLAIMS DISPUTES HAVE ARISEN , COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN FEWER THAN IN OTHER RAVAGED AREAS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the city grapples with rebuilding a year after the disastrous firestorm that consumed some 400 homes , it can count one stroke of fortune : Homeowners have fared better with the insurance industry than other scorched Southland communities have . State regulators and many of the city ' s fire victims give reasonably good marks to insurers , who have processed nearly 2 # 600 claims totaling more_than $ 350 million in the aftermath of the Laguna blaze . The state_Department of Insurance has recorded fewer complaints from homeowners in Laguna Beach than from the Malibu and Altadena areas savaged by similarly catastrophic fires last October . While the Insurance Department fielded 17 complaints from Laguna fire victims , they handled 78 after the blazes in the two Los Angeles County communities . &quot; I ' m very happy the way the industry has responded to the majority of folks in Laguna , &quot; said state Sen . Art Torres , chairman of the Senate Insurance Committee and Democratic candidate for insurance commissioner . &quot; The majority of cases were or are being resolved . I just wish it was the same way elsewhere. &quot; With the first anniversary of the disaster at_hand , 98 % of the claims in Laguna have resulted in at least a partial settlement . The three biggest insurers in the area -- State Farm , Allstate and Farmers Insurance -- have paid_out nearly $ 195 million so far . &quot; There ' s been problems with some of the smaller companies , but on balance Laguna Beach came_out very well , &quot; said Jerry Cohen , a retired engineer whose home was destroyed in the blaze . Many feared it would n ' t be that way . After the firestorm obliterated his small Canyon Acres cottage last October , Terence ( Chuck ) Gibian turned anxiously to his insurance_company for help . Like other victims in Laguna , he had heard insurance horror stories after the 1991 fire in Oakland Hills , in which many homeowners discovered they were woefully underinsured and couldn ' t afford the cost of rebuilding . Gibian ' s consternation , however , quickly turned_to calm . His agent arrived with a healthy bailout check &quot; before the smoke stopped rising. &quot; The firm offered guidance on architects . They also agreed to pay the full price of rebuilding his house , including the extra foundation work and other upgrades needed to meet today ' s tighter codes . &quot; The insurance_companies got yelled at after Oakland , &quot; Gibian said . &quot; In Laguna , a lot of them have made accommodations . I think they wanted to recoup some of their lost reputation. &quot; Local residents and state officials cite a variety of reasons that Laguna Beach did_better with insurers than other Southland areas . Many of the homeowners in Altadena and Malibu , two regions considered high-risk because of a history of wildfires , don ' t have the sorts of top-shelf policies that provide guaranteed replacement of a home , including the costly structural upgrades necessary to meet present-day building_codes . In such areas , those homeowners are covered under the California FAIR plan , a quasi-public insurance program that provides limited coverage to residents in high-risk zones . Typically , FAIR policies only cover a portion of the cost of rebuilding , a_level of protection that one state insurance official described as &quot; mediocre. &quot; In sharp contrast , Laguna Beach has not been plagued by costly wildfires and was not designated a FAIR zone , meaning homeowners there were able to obtain the best policies private insurance_companies offer . A recent survey of homeowners in Mystic Hills , one of the neighborhoods hardest hit in the Laguna blaze , found that 59 % of the residents had policies that financed full replacement of their homes . Another 16 % were paid based on a market appraisal of their homes ' worth before the blaze , a figure that normally doesn ' t cover the entire cost of rebuilding . Meanwhile , 19 % were paid based on fixed values declared in their policies , while 6 % had yet to be paid , even_up to the limits set_in their insurance_premiums . Aside from the peculiarities of the insurance industry , a variety of other factors came_into play to help Laguna Beach . Early on , local and state politicians weighed in on behalf of the victims of the fire . Soon after the flames subsided , state Sen . Marian Bergeson ( R-Newport Beach ) , whose district includes Laguna Beach , joined Torres at a well-attended meeting at a local church . Consumer groups that flowered after the Oakland fire also made the trip , offering warnings and advice . But the insurance industry , which saw its reputation scorched along with the hillsides in the Oakland firestorm , also deserves credit . After Oakland , insurers were faulted for failing to inform consumers about the limits of their coverage , shuttling adjusters around so that consumers could not get consistent treatment , giving &quot; low-ball &quot; estimates of rebuilding costs , providing inadequate advance payments for fire victims ' living expenses and needlessly dragging_out the claims settlement process . The industry continues to dispute most of those charges . &quot; People who knowingly opted for lower policy limits in_order to save a couple dollars on their premium came_back with all kinds of reasons why they should be paid far in excess of their policy limits , &quot; said Jim Snyder , president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California , an umbrella group representing many of the industry ' s largest companies . &quot; The tragedy was used by many as a windfall for betterment. &quot; Still , after the Oakland Hills fire many of the firms launched programs to better communicate the fine details of their policies and to rewrite policies of homeowners whose limits weren ' t close to covering the cost of replacing a house . When the fires hit Laguna and other spots around the Southland , many insurance_companies reacted with dispatch . A number called_in additional adjusters from around California or out of state and established toll-free claims hot_lines . They stationed representatives at disaster relief centers . Several also changed their claims handling procedures to designate a single person as responsible_for each file , so consumers would be assured of continuity . While industry advocates such_as Snyder bemoan what they saw as opportunism by some victims of the Oakland fire , several insurance_firms took the politically safe route in Laguna and ratcheted up coverage after the fact for burned-out residents whose policies were too limited to restore what they lost . Such concessions came_in Oakland only after intense political pressure was exerted on the insurance industry . But experts say a number of problems have persisted . Cindy Ossias , an Insurance Department senior staff counsel , said some firms weren ' t working fast enough to upgrade policies and were sticking_to replacement formulas that drastically undervalued the cost of rebuilding a custom home on a hillside lot . Moreover , some victims who have recouped full replacement value for their structures have not received enough to replace their personal belongings -- clothes , furniture , carpets , TVs , personal_computers and such -- that went_up in smoke . Policies typically set a replacement level for belongings at 75 % of the cost of rebuilding the house , but critics say that figure is arbitrary and doesn ' t always cover the losses . Consider the case of Robert F . Gentry . The Laguna Beach councilman , who saw not only his personal residence burn_down but also a nearby rental house he owns , has experienced a &quot; roller-coaster ride &quot; of both good and bad in dealing with his insurance_company . Negotiations that Gentry describes as &quot; creative tension &quot; culminated with the insurer agreeing to bump_up his policy limits to a_level that he hopes will cover the cost of rebuilding . The company also agreed to honor the city ' s domestic partnership registry and cover the cost of replacing the belongings of Gentry ' s partner , Dennis Amick . But then there ' s the bad part . Even with his final settlement , Gentry is still $ 100 # 000 short on his belongings , mostly because he had amassed a house full of family antiques that included 17th-Century Victorian furniture , silver , art pieces and marble statuary . His insurer also refused to continue offsetting the $ 1 # 550 in monthly income he was losing on his burned-out rental , which is just now under construction . Gentry , a philosophical sort , chalks it up_to &quot; lessons in life &quot; and adds : &quot; I ' m a much better insurance consumer today than I was a year ago. &quot; A neighbor of Gentry ' s has a grimmer tale with a happier ending . Two weeks before the fire erupted , Bill Halbert talked to his insurer about getting a full replacement plan . When the flames consumed the 2 # 500-square-foot view home , Halbert breathed a sigh of relief knowing he had gotten the upgraded policy just in time . But a_few weeks later the insurance_firm called to tell the 54-year-old health_care marketing executive that the company didn ' t believe he had signed_up and were not going_to honor the new policy . His old policy limit would pay maybe half the rebuilding cost . &quot; Devastated is not exaggerating the way we felt , &quot; recalls Halbert , who had raised three children in the house with his wife , Ginny . &quot; It seemed like the whole_rest of our lives was in jeopardy. &quot; Halbert got an attorney and ultimately the case was taken_to arbitration , where a judge ruled last month against the insurance_firm , USAA , which provides coverage to active and retired military personal and their families . &quot; It ' s the first sigh of relief we ' ve had in over a year , &quot; said Halbert , a former Army_officer . Although the firm still believes it was correct , it has abided_by the arbitration judge ' s decision and issued the Halberts a check reflecting the new limits , said Paul Schattenberg , a USAA spokesman . He also noted that the firm settled 131 claims in the Laguna fire -- including 29 total losses -- at a cost of $ 42.6 million without problems and maintains one of the lowest complaint ratios in California . Some victims remain in a tug of war . In a case reminiscent_of the insurance struggles after the Oakland Hills fire , Bernard and Mary Anderson have sued their insurer , Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co. , claiming they put their faith in the firm ' s representatives to provide them with adequate coverage . Instead , the $ 193 # 000 of limits will only partially cover replacement of the house . Aetna had no comment on the case . Even some fire victims who ultimately reached a satisfactory settlement with their insurers said they were troubled by the negotiation process . One resident of Canyon Acres , who asked_for anonymity for fear of reprisals from his insurer , said he was continually put_on the defensive and chastised for not keeping records of his belongings somewhere besides his house , which burned to the ground . Others who kept good records didn ' t suffer such a fate . David Horne , president of the Mystic Hills Homeowners Assn. , had stowed in a bank safe deposit_box complete lists , receipts and a videotape documenting his belongings . The last thing Horne ' s wife did as flames raced toward their house was go_around snapping photos for further proof . A few said they felt the Northridge earthquake , which dwarfed the fires both in terms of victims and property loss , prompted insurers to make quick concessions . &quot; The earthquake helped , I think , in the sense that some firms didn ' t have time to deal with Laguna in detail , &quot; said Cohen , whose insurance carrier had three total losses in the Laguna Beach fire but more_than 40 # 000 claims in the earthquake . &quot; Everything was liberalized in favor of the homeowner. &quot; * POLICY RENEWALS DENIED : Some in Laguna lose fire_insurance as firms reduce risks .
