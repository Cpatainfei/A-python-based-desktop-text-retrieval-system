   <HEADLINE> D-DAY LANDING IN SANTA MONICA IS FRANCE ' S WAY OF SAYING ' MERCI '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Troops are preparing to storm ashore at Santa Monica on June 1 , but the invading force will be friendly and acting for a good cause -- history . The planned landing on Santa Monica beach , to involve a World_War II-vintage landing_craft and veterans of the Normandy invasion , will be part of an elaborate commemoration of the 50th anniversary of D-day called &quot; Merci l ' Amerique. &quot; Organized by the local French consulate with help from American veterans groups , the event is intended to thank America for helping to liberate France from the Nazis during World_War_II . &quot; It ' s a good occasion to say , ' Thank_you ' and ' I love you , ' words the_French don ' t use very often , &quot; said French Consul General Jean-Maurice Ripert . The amphibious landing will be for real , albeit not on the scale of the original . About 40 soldiers will hit the beaches after disembarking from the landing_craft , which was used on D-day . Half of those participating are expected to be actual D-day veterans -- now in their 70s -- who may or may_not be able to squeeze into their old uniforms . Others will be active-duty soldiers . To add_to the realism , Ripert has asked the city of Santa Monica to declare the beach French territory for a day . City officials are mulling this one over . The &quot; invaders &quot; won ' t encounter much resistance . The only firing will come at the start of the ceremony , when three blanks will be shot from the USS Copeland , a Navy frigate participating in the event . At the real D-day invasion , about 160 # 000 Allied soldiers landed along a 50-mile stretch of rugged Normandy coastline at dawn on June 6 , 1944 . Casualties were high , as the vulnerable soldiers wading ashore through the frigid Northern Atlantic waters were cut_down by German fire . As former Army Staff Sgt . Thomas McGowan recalls it , landing at Utah Beach was a nightmare . McGowan , now a Cheviot Hills resident , said all he could think_of was getting_to safer ground . &quot; I immediately forgot everything I ' d learned in school , &quot; he recalled in a recent interview . &quot; I was so afraid , you can ' t imagine. &quot; * McGowan fought his way through France with thousands of other Allied soldiers in what was called &quot; Operation Overlord , &quot; liberating village after village as townspeople responded with bread and wine and cheers . The heavily decorated McGowan , left for dead after being shot and beaten by Germans , said he would n ' t miss the June 1 remembrance ceremony , which is set to start about 6 p.m. Santa Monica is the only place outside of Normandy itself that will host an actual beach landing to commemorate D-day , Ripert said . California , he added , has all_the right ingredients for a successful D-day event . &quot; We have the movie_industry , crazy people and a beach looking west , &quot; he said , adding that he was undeterred by the fact that the Allies actually landed on north-facing beaches . Ripert has pushed_forward with his plan even though his own government ' s support for the event -- expected to cost in the tens of thousands of dollars -- has been mostly symbolic . &quot; We don ' t have a cent , &quot; he said . For funds , he has turned for help to companies with a French connection , such_as MGM Studios and Guess jeans . Another sponsor , Hotel Sofitel , is offering a free dinner for 250 D-day vets . The hotel ' s president , John Lehodey , was a young boy when his hometown of Avranches , France , was liberated by Americans . Besides the amphibious landing north of the Santa Monica Pier , the commemoration ceremony will feature a flotilla of ships offshore and vintage tanks and other military equipment and memorabilia on the sand . World_War II-era planes will fly overhead . The flotilla will include the Copeland , the_French Navy frigate Prairial , the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Point Bridge -- and perhaps the Lane Victory , a restored World_War_II Liberty_ship that had been headed to Normandy but had to turn_back because of engine trouble and arrived Sunday in San Pedro . Four hundred D-day veterans will be honored at the Remembrance Ceremony . And French children wearing &quot; Merci L ' Amerique &quot; T-shirts and carrying flowers will greet soldiers as they come ashore . If all goes well , Ripert said , the beach ceremony will be emotional and patriotic -- the kind of thing that will leave people misty-eyed and proud , no matter what their national origin . Though details of the program are still being worked_out , Ripert promises national_anthems , testimonies of D-day survivors and high-ranking military and government officials . The documentary , &quot; Victory at_Sea , &quot; will be shown . If all that doesn ' t tug at the heartstrings , a lone bugler will close the ceremony at sunset . * The ceremony is being held five days before the actual D-day anniversary so participants can fly to France in time for the D-day ceremonies there . For retired Marine Capt . Joseph_Smith , the far smaller scale of the Santa Monica event in no way diminishes its importance . &quot; It ' s an opportunity to salute those individuals who kept the Free_World free , &quot; Smith said . &quot; If they had not been successful , we would not have the world we have today. &quot;</TEXT>
