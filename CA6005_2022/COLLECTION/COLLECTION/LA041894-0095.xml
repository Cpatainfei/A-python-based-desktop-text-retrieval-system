   <HEADLINE> ANTI-ABORTION ZEALOT ' S GUN MAY HAVE WOUNDED ALLIES ; PROTEST : SHELLY SHANNON SHOT A DOCTOR , THEN SHE SHOT OFF HER MOUTH . HER CASE HELPED SPUR RACKETEERING PROBES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rachelle Renee Shannon , a quiet , disheveled housewife from rural Oregon charged with shooting a doctor as he drove_away from his Wichita abortion clinic last August , could hardly have made her attorney ' s job any harder . Within hours of the shooting , Shannon was arrested , had confessed to police and had written a jailhouse letter to her daughter detailing her crime . As she was led away by police in the early morning hours , she turned_to the waiting media and asked , on camera : &quot; Did I get him ? &quot; She added_to a police_officer : &quot; If ever there was a justifiable homicide , this was it. &quot; Only later did she discover , to her dismay , that she had only wounded Dr. George Tiller in both arms and that he was back at_work at his clinic the following day . But Shelly Shannon , a self-described &quot; puny wimp &quot; and 38-year-old mother of two , simply couldn ' t keep her mouth shut , even when her court-appointed attorney told her to stop talking . To her attorney ' s chagrin , she refused to plead not_guilty by reason of insanity . No , she insisted , her mind had been clear . She knew what she was doing when she shot Tiller : She was a Christian attempting to stop a man who had made a career of murdering unborn babies . Shannon entered a plea of not_guilty ; in her mind , trying to kill a murderer is justifiable . And she wanted to get_on the witness_stand and tell the world what she had done . She was convicted March 25 and awaits sentencing on April 29 . She used the months before her trial to tell anyone who would listen about her life as an anti-abortion zealot and her earlier , previously unknown involvement in a string of abortion clinic bombings across the country . Later she admitted that she hoped to make bail before her trial so she could &quot; blow_up Tiller ' s clinic. &quot; Shannon ' s willingness to talk has done more_than call attention to her cause and clinch her conviction . She inadvertently triggered the first serious federal investigation into the question of whether an organized underground network of extremists is responsible_for the wave of anti-abortion violence that has swept the nation in recent years . For years , anti-abortion leaders have denied that they are behind the growing violence . &quot; There has never been a link between the violence and any responsible pro-life leader at all , &quot; said Patrick Mahoney , national spokesman for Operation Rescue . Even those who openly support anti-abortion violence stress that they have had no involvement in any of it . &quot; Violence is not my calling ; I use the weapon of the spirit and pray for people like Shelly Shannon , &quot; said Paul Hill , founder of Defensive Action , a group that endorses anti-abortion violence . With little hard evidence , officials at the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms generally tried to avoid the conspiracy issue for fear of getting caught in the political cross-fire . Despite years of prodding from feminist groups and abortion-rights advocates , federal authorities have tended to view each new incident of violence as an isolated crime . But the treasure_trove of information provided by Shannon changed the equation . Although the ATF does not officially discuss ongoing investigations , prosecutors in Wichita and officials on both sides of the abortion battle said ATF agents are actively investigating Shannon ' s ties to anti-abortion groups . Moreover , they are said to be looking_for evidence of a possible conspiracy behind past bombings , particularly in the Pacific Northwest . Agents from ATF ' s Portland , Ore. , field office have interviewed officials of anti-abortion groups in which Shannon was an active member and others affiliated with groups to which Shannon contributed money . Her possible involvement in clinic attacks and other forms of anti-abortion violence could lead to federal racketeering charges against her and others under a recent Supreme Court ruling allowing the use of such statutes to prosecute abortion opponents . Indeed , the Shannon case appears to offer investigators much more insight into the militant anti-abortion movement than did the more celebrated case of Michael Griffin , convicted earlier this year in the 1993 murder of Dr. David Gunn in Pensacola , Fla . Shannon , by all accounts , had far more extensive ties to anti-abortion extremist groups than did Griffin . &quot; This is the case with the most documented evidence of a conspiracy we have ever seen , &quot; said Gina Shaw , a spokeswoman for the National Abortion Federation in Washington . Shannon ' s diaries and other evidence dug_up from the back yard of her home_in Grants Pass , Ore. , seem to lend credence to such suspicions . Her diaries reveal that just days before she shot Tiller , she traveled_to Ohio to visit two militant anti-abortion leaders being held_in different prisons on charges stemming from clinic bombings and related vandalism . Both leaders openly advocate anti-abortion violence , and Shannon was an editor of a newsletter for one of their organizations . Her diary entries described each prison meeting as &quot; awesome. &quot; Meanwhile , a search of her home found paraphernalia , including bomb-making materials and manuals , that seemed to provide a road map to her secret past . What makes Shannon ' s emergence as a violent extremist so intriguing is that her background is typical of the thousands of evangelical Christians who began to flock to anti-abortion groups during the late 1980s . Unlike other grass-roots volunteers , however , Shannon gradually let her life become consumed by the anti-abortion cause , testimony in her trial shows . And , like the deeply committed anti-war protesters of the 1960s who ended_up in violent organizations such_as the Weather Underground , Shannon ultimately moved from groups that merely wanted to protest and block access to abortion clinics to those advocating far more desperate_measures . Shannon , a Wisconsin native , was a single mother while still in high_school and said she experimented with LSD as a teen-ager before becoming a born-again_Christian while her husband was in the Marines in the 1970s . Her life in the anti-abortion movement began in 1988 , when she began attending meetings in southern Oregon of the local chapter of Right_to_Life , a mainstream anti-abortion group that frowns_upon civil_disobedience and militant acts of protest or violence . &quot; I ' ve always known that abortion was wrong , and I believed that it was murder , but I didn ' t see any pictures of the babies or see any picketers or know that people were even trying to save their lives or anything like that until 1988 , &quot; Shannon said during her trial . &quot; I contacted Right_to_Life and told them I wanted to get involved , and the first thing I did was picket. &quot; But she said she quickly found Right_to_Life ' s emphasis on peaceful picketing and political lobbying stultifying and that she was frustrated by its refusal to take direct_action against abortion . When members of a new anti-abortion group came_to a meeting of her Right_to_Life chapter and asked_for volunteers to blockade and shut_down a clinic in Portland , Shannon quickly signed_up . &quot; I just kind of knew right away that I wanted to do that , &quot; she said . Shannon found herself on the ground_floor of Operation Rescue . Led by Randy Terry and a cadre of rebellious , deeply conservative evangelicals still in their 20s and 30s , Operation Rescue was committed to acts of civil_disobedience outrageous enough to catch the media ' s attention . Founded in 1986 , the group by 1988 was beginning to have a nationwide impact . Operation Rescue ' s clinic blockades , called &quot; rescues , &quot; and the mass arrests that inevitably followed , offered a rush of excitement and danger to a woman whose uneventful life had been circumscribed by her early marriage to an electronics technician from a small_town who didn ' t share her religious_beliefs or her outrage over abortion . Soon , Shannon was leaving her home_in Grants Pass at every opportunity to join Operation Rescue blockades in Oregon , Northern California and eventually throughout the country , from Atlanta , Ga. , to Fargo , N.D. Along with thousands of others , she rode in car caravans to join in the biggest campaign in_Operation Rescue ' s history , its &quot; Summer of Mercy &quot; in 1991 , when the group poured all_of its resources into Wichita in an effort to shut_down Tiller ' s clinic , one of the few in the nation that conducts late-term abortions . &quot; My kids were still at_home , and the housework would pile_up and stuff , and there was always a struggle trying to decide whether to go , but I went pretty much every chance I had , &quot; Shannon testified . As she and her husband grew more distant , Shannon said she increasingly identified with her new circle of fellow activists . Bonds of friendship were forged during frequent stints in jail following clinic blockades , and conversations revolved_around radically conservative politics and evangelical religion . Operation Rescue soon became wracked by internal disputes as its leadership fractured under the threat of ever-greater prison sentences and heavier financial penalties for the group ' s practice of violating court injunctions against blocking access to clinics . As Operation Rescue ' s most radical leaders split off to form new ultra-rightist organizations that would not bend in the face of legal threats , Shannon followed them to the fringe of the anti-abortion movement . She joined a group called the Lambs of Christ and became close to the leaders of another fringe group called Advocates for Life , led by defectors from Operation Rescue . Life Advocates , the magazine published by Advocates for Life , often focused_on Tiller , who was dubbed &quot; Tiller the Killer. &quot; Shannon said she still opposed the use of force after joining the splinter_groups , even as more and more young anti-abortion demonstrators were arguing among themselves that it was time to change tactics . In the midst of one such debate in a Seattle jail_cell , Shannon recalled that &quot; I spoke_up against that kind of thing ; I told them that this was a spiritual battle , and we were nonviolent and we were not going_to do anything like that . I wanted to stay nonviolent. &quot; Her conversion came during a jail term in Fargo , following another clinic blockade . There , she said , she was given a book of letters from a German minister who became involved in an assassination plot against Adolf Hitler after realizing that prayer was not enough to stop the Nazis . She said reading the book persuaded her that her commitment to peaceable protest was a mistake and that violence was the only solution . Her new views brought her in contact with John Brockhoeft , who had been convicted in connection with clinic bombings in Florida and Ohio . Shannon became so close to Brockhoeft that she began to edit his extremist newsletter while he was in prison . By 1992 , law_enforcement authorities believe , Shannon was participating in clinic bombings and arson attacks . ATF agents reportedly consider Shannon the prime suspect in the April , 1992 , arson that destroyed the Catalina Medical_Center in Ashland , Ore . Last January , Shannon wrote to police in Chico , Calif. , from her jail_cell in Wichita to confess to vandalism at a clinic there in 1992 . In a letter she sent to a Wichita newspaper in February , Shannon said she was involved in a string of abortion clinic arsons across the nation and knows others who were involved in still more . &quot; I figure at least six different states , several places in some states , &quot; Shannon wrote . &quot; that ' s what I get for traveling hither and yon , doing this , that and the other thing. &quot; In early 1993 , Shannon said , she decided it was time to take action against the doctors performing abortions . After Griffin killed Gunn in Pensacola in March , 1993 , Shannon decided that Griffin was her hero and eventually felt she had to emulate him . Today , the anti-abortion movement is reeling from the damage wrought by Shannon and Griffin . Fearful of new federal investigations into possible conspiracies , leaders are increasingly cautious about what they say to each other in meetings or whom they talk to on the telephone , Mahoney said . &quot; There is especially a concern that the Clinton_Administration will use the ATF and the FBI against us , &quot; he said . &quot; So now there is a reticence by those of us who don ' t endorse violence to even talk or meet with those who do. &quot; The anti-abortion movement , was once a &quot; closely_knit family , &quot; Mahoney said . &quot; But this increased federal presence is severely testing those ties. &quot;</TEXT>
