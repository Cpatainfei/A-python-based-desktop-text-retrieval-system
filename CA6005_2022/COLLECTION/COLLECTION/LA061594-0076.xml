   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : DEPUTIES WILL USE MOBILE MINI-STATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A 32-foot-long motor_home seized from a suspected drug dealer has been given a new life as a mobile sheriff ' s mini-station , Sheriff Larry Carpenter said Tuesday . The black-and-white vehicle will roam 11 communities in Ventura County each week starting July 1 , Carpenter said.The areas chosen have not had a strong sheriff ' s presence in the past because of their small population or rural location , he said . People will be more likely to report crimes and other problems if they see the mobile station in their community , Carpenter said . &quot; It ' s kind of a bookmobile of law_enforcement , &quot; he said . For the past two years , the recreational_vehicle has been used as a sheriff ' s command_post capable of use during emergencies or disasters . The mobile station has emergency radio dispatching capabilities , a fax machine , cellular_phones , laptop_computers and a printer . A deputy recently suggested that the department put it to full-time use by turning it into a station , and Carpenter agreed . The vehicle will make its debut in El Rio , one of the neighborhoods selected for a weekly visit , Carpenter said . Other communities include Casitas Springs , Hollywood Beach , Meiners Oaks , Montalvo , Nyeland Acres , Rincon , Saticoy , Silver Strand and Ventura Avenue . A location in each of those areas has been designated , and the station will be open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. It will be staffed by one sheriff ' s deputy , a technician and two volunteers , Carpenter said .
