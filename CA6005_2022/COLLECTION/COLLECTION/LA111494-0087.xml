   <HEADLINE> CLINTON , CHINESE PRESIDENT MEET BEFORE SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton met with Chinese President Jiang Zemin today for the second time in a year , with the two leaders showing that they are working closely together for peace in Korea but are still deeply divided over economic and trade disputes . The two presidents talked for about an hour at a convention center in Jakarta , where both men have come_to attend a summit_meeting of leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum . Eighteen nations from around the Pacific belong_to the organization . U.S. officials characterized the meeting as &quot; businesslike and friendly. &quot; The upbeat tone represented an extraordinary change from a year ago , when Clinton and Jiang met for the first time at the inaugural APEC summit in Seattle . At that time , the two countries were preoccupied with U.S. complaints about repression and human_rights violations in China . At the session , the two presidents seemed to be joining to press for new talks soon between North and South_Korea . That would represent an important new step toward putting into effect the recently signed agreement under which North_Korea is to stop developing nuclear_weapons . A year ago , Clinton -- who during his 1992 presidential campaign had accused the George_Bush Administration of &quot; coddling dictators &quot; in its policy toward Beijing -- sat stony-faced as photographers shot the beginning of the meeting with Jiang . Afterward , looking equally grim , he said he had been &quot; as frank and forthright as possible &quot; about the differences between the two countries . By contrast , the main dispute to emerge at today ' s meeting was over China ' s current and pressing drive to be admitted to the new_World Trade Organization , which will set the rules for liberalized trade among the world ' s leading economic powers . The outcome will determine the extent to which U.S. and other foreign companies can sell their products in China . China wants to preserve some protection for its industries . It seeks to enter the world trade system with some special , more lenient conditions than apply to the United States , Japan and Western European_nations , on grounds that it is still a &quot; developing country. &quot; But Clinton told Jiang that in_order to enter the new trade group , China would have to abide_by what he called &quot; the basic rules &quot; that apply to &quot; any other nation , &quot; according to U.S. officials at the meeting . Clinton_Administration officials insist that they are still pressing human_rights concerns with China . But Clinton shifted course on his China policy last May , when he abandoned the threat to remove China ' s most-favored-nation trading privileges in the United States . Since then , U.S. officials have avoided further public threats against Beijing . Administration officials stressed that Clinton raised human_rights issues during his meeting with Jiang today , but they were not the main subject of conversation and were portrayed as merely one of many issues on the agenda . Indeed , the Chinese president thanked Clinton for what he called the &quot; progress &quot; in the relationship between the two countries over the past year . The President also acknowledged that there has been progress , but he carefully added that more needs to be done on human_rights in China , U.S. participants in the meeting said . Administration officials have been particularly eager to demonstrate that they cooperate closely with China in their policy toward North_Korea , because China is the only country with any leverage over the Pyongyang regime . Since 1991 , Beijing has also had diplomatic ties with South_Korea , and Chinese Premier Li Peng paid a recent visit to Seoul . Secretary_of_Defense William J . Perry recently gave China credit for helping bring North_Korea into the agreement it signed with the United States . In it , Pyongyang promised to freeze and eventually dismantle its nuclear_weapons program in exchange for billions of dollars in economic concessions from the United States and its allies . At today ' s meeting , Jiang said he hoped that North and South_Korea would have good talks with one another . His remarks suggested that China is now cooperating with the Clinton_Administration in pushing the two Koreas to open new high-level talks . Arranging talks between North and South_Korea is important , because South_Korea has complained that the Clinton_Administration should not leave Seoul behind as the United States begins to upgrade its relations with North_Korea . During today ' s meeting , Jiang also complained to Clinton about U.S. policy toward Taiwan . In September , the Administration announced a modest upgrading of the U.S. policy on contacts with Taiwan , with which the United States has no diplomatic relations . Clinton reaffirmed the 2-decade-old policy that the United States believes there is only one China and that Taiwan is not an independent country . While the President ' s language was not new , it was welcome to China , which considers Taiwan to be a renegade province and hopes to regain control over it someday . Another human_rights issue remained in the foreground as Clinton arrived in Jakarta , where students from the disputed territory of East Timor kept_up a vigil inside the U.S. Embassy compound . The embassy standoff came amid reports of violent demonstrations 1 # 200 miles away in Dili , the capital of East Timor , where hundreds of protesters swirled through the streets , breaking car_windows , setting small fires and throwing stones at police . The protests proved a major embarrassment to the Indonesian government , which had hoped that the summit of Asian and Pacific leaders would showcase the country ' s economic achievements . The talks will be held Tuesday in the mountain resort of Bogor , about 40 miles south of Jakarta . East Timor , a former Portuguese colony , was unilaterally annexed by Indonesia in 1976 in a move that has never been recognized by the United Nations . East Timor is overwhelmingly Roman_Catholic , while Indonesia ' s population of 180 million is predominantly Muslim . A small independence movement has been fighting to force the Indonesian government to withdraw its troops from East Timor , but most of its members are now in Indonesian jails . The group recently began peace talks with the Indonesian government at the United Nations , but Indonesia gave no indication that it is prepared to relinquish control of the territory . In Jakarta , 29 East Timorese students remained holed up in a walled parking_lot at the U.S. Embassy complex . The students scaled a high wrought-iron fence Saturday as hundreds of riot police looked_on . A group spokesman said they were demanding to meet with Clinton or Christopher to present their demands for the release of guerrilla leader Jose ( Xanana ) Gusmao , who is serving a 20-year sentence . &quot; We want a chance to tell Christopher that we have been suffering for 19 years and we hope you can solve this problem , &quot; said group leader Domingos Salmento Alvas . The U.S. Embassy said in a statement that the demonstrators had been offered water and a chance to meet with U.S. Ambassador Robert Barry . &quot; We have urged them to present their concerns in a constructive and timely manner through the President ' s personal_representative , &quot; the statement said . &quot; They have not accepted our offer at this time. &quot; Christopher told reporters Saturday that the United States plans to press Indonesian President Suharto about East Timor and other human_rights issues during a one-day state visit by Clinton on Wednesday , after the summit talks are concluded . And Clinton , during a one-day visit to the Philippines , said Sunday , &quot; Human_rights is too important ( an issue ) , particularly now , to pass by. &quot; Clinton told a news_conference in Manila that he would &quot; absolutely &quot; be raising human_rights issues in Jakarta even though the question is not part of the formal agenda for the summit .</TEXT>
