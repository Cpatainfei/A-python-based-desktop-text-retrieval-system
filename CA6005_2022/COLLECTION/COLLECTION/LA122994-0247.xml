   <HEADLINE> AHMANSON FUNDS ANOTHER LACMA GEM : ' SIR WYNDHAM '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the 72nd time in 22 years , the Ahmanson Foundation has provided the Los Angeles County Museum of Art with funds to make a significant addition to its collection . More often than not , these gifts have been European Old_Master paintings . The latest -- a life-size portrait of an English gentleman on a Grand_Tour of Europe , painted in 1759 by Italian artist Pompeo Batoni and purchased from a dealer at an undisclosed price -- is no exception . &quot; The Ahmanson Foundation ' s devotion to the museum is overwhelming , &quot; board of trustees president William A . Mingst said in a telephone_interview . &quot; This source of support , for so many years , has added key pieces to the permanent collection . . . and greatly enhanced the museum ' s value as a community resource in Los Angeles. &quot; The new addition is &quot; Sir Wyndham Knatchbull-Wyndham , &quot; an oil-on-canvas work measuring about 7 1 / 2 feet by 5 1 / 2 feet . The portrait will go_on view at the museum in the spring , after being cleaned and studied in LACMA ' s conservation center . The painting portrays an ebullient young aristocrat wearing an elegant costume and a pouf of white drapery over one arm -- leaving no doubt about his privileged status . Painted in Rome , in a richly appointed room with a view of an idyllic countryside , Sir Wyndham is surrounded with images that signify the sights and cultural experiences that educated Englishmen were expected to enjoy on their continental travels . He points to a view of Tivoli , a tourist destination northeast of Rome , while gazing at a bust of Minerva , the ancient Roman goddess of wisdom , technical skill and invention . Batoni was born in Lucca in 1708 , the son of a goldsmith . He moved to Rome in 1727 and established himself as a painter of historical , religious and allegorical subjects before turning_to portraiture . Today , Batoni is little known outside scholarly circles , but he was one of the wealthiest and most successful painters of the 18th-Century Roman School . By 1758 , he had become the premier portrait_painter in Europe , whose subjects included emperors , dukes and popes . He was also the acknowledged master of the Grand_Tour genre , finding a lucrative market in a parade of English noblemen who considered foreign travel part of their classical education -- as well as their birthright . Apparently they loved to have their journeys recorded in portraits , and Batoni was only too happy to accommodate them . He depicted his affluent tourist clients as energetic members of a leisure class who had the world at their command . &quot; Sir Wyndham Knatchbull-Wyndham &quot; is a prime example of Batoni ' s full-length portraiture . According to J . Patrice Marandel , LACMA ' s curator of European painting and sculpture , it provides a historical and stylistic connection between two other works in the museum ' s collection , Italian painter Guido Reni ' s portrait of Cardinal Roberto Ubaldino ( a 1983 gift of the Ahmanson Foundation ) and a romantic image of 2nd Lt . Charles Legrand by French artist Antoine-Jean Gros . The new acquisition brings public attention to a work that has been carefully preserved since its creation -- about 235 years ago -- in the subject ' s family home at Mersham le Hatch in Kent . The reason for selling the portrait has not been disclosed , but it is in unusually good_condition because it stayed in one place with a family that prized it , according to Joseph Fronek , senior paintings conservator at LACMA . The work ' s admirable state of health is also a tribute to Batoni ' s technical mastery , Fronek said . The pigments have retained their original colors and impasto details have remained intact . The painting probably hasn ' t been cleaned for 80 years , he said . Dirt and discolored varnish must be removed , he said , but little restoration is needed .</TEXT>
