   <HEADLINE> HIJACKED JET FLIES TO FRANCE AFTER 3RD SLAYING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An Air France plane commandeered by Muslim extremists flew from Algeria to the southern French city of Marseilles early today , hours after the gunmen killed an employee of the_French Embassy . Authorities were negotiating for the release of about 170 hostages still on board . Since Saturday , when the plane was seized in the Algerian_capital of Algiers , three passengers have been killed by the five hijackers in the most dramatic act yet in the bloody , 3-year-old guerrilla war against Algeria ' s military-installed government . By allowing the plane , an Airbus A300 , to leave Algiers for France , the Algerian government had met one of the hijackers ' demands . But , beyond that , it wasn ' t clear what the five men , armed with two Kalashnikov rifles and two handguns , wanted . An earlier demand for the release of two Muslim extremist leaders imprisoned in Algeria apparently had been dropped . The plane arrived early today at Marignane Airport , 25 miles north of Marseilles , a major Mediterranean port about a two-hour flight from Algeria . It taxied to a remote corner of the tarmac , where firefighting teams were standing_by , and negotiations began between French authorities and the hijackers . The arrival of the plane on French soil changed the situation . For one thing , the government of France , which had earlier offered to dispatch one of its crack , anti-terrorist units to help the Algerian authorities , was now completely in_charge . Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur and his foreign_minister had spent most of Christmas_Day meeting about the hijacking and trying to talk the Algerians into letting the plane come_to France . The hijackers , who would most certainly face execution in Algeria if apprehended there , may have been hoping for an easier exit from the drama in France , where there is no death_penalty . And France ' s record on handling terrorist cases , especially those involving Algerian guerrillas , is mixed . Some suspects have been tried and sent to prison , but many others have been expelled to Iran or other neutral countries in West Africa . On the other hand , France has a history of dealing decisively , and often with deadly force , in hostage situations . Algerian radio said Algeria had allowed the plane to leave to &quot; safeguard human lives and avoid material losses. &quot; On Saturday , the hijackers had killed two passengers and freed about 60 hostages , mostly women and children . The body of the third victim , Yannick Beugnet , who was a cook at the_French Embassy in Algiers , was dumped from the plane late Sunday . He was the 23rd French citizen killed by the extremists in the past three years . French news_reports said he was killed when a departure deadline , fixed by the hijackers , had passed . The French Foreign Ministry indicated Sunday that it had been pressuring Algeria to let the plane take_off because the hijackers had threatened to kill a French hostage . &quot; The hostages are our primary concern , &quot; French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told French television Sunday . The jet had 227 passengers and 12 crew aboard when it was taken_over shortly before takeoff for France on Saturday . ( Air France earlier had said 271 passengers were aboard. ) Authorities said the hijackers may have posed as baggage handlers . It was initially reported that there were four hijackers , but officials said Sunday that there were five . All the female passengers had been released , though female flight_attendants remained , Air France said . A freed hostage described how one passenger , an Algerian police_officer , pleaded for his life before he was shot in the head . &quot; He screamed , ' Don ' t kill me ! I am married ! I have a child ! ' &quot; said the woman , who spoke_to news_agencies on condition of anonymity . The gunmen also killed a Vietnamese passenger . Both bodies were dumped on the ramp outside the plane . Algerian authorities said they had identified four of the five gunmen , and all were from the Armed Islamic Group ( GIA ) , the most radical of several extremist groups fighting the Algerian government . The GIA has frequently targeted French nationals in its terrorist attacks . Although Air France declined to give the passengers ' nationalities , the authorities said most were Algerian . U.S. officials said there was no word of any Americans aboard . Juppe said 40 French nationals remained on the plane . The hijacking came two days before the third anniversary of the last round of Algerian elections , which the government had canceled when it appeared a Muslim group , the Islamic Salvation Front , would win . The military installed its own leaders in January , 1992 . At first , the hijackers reportedly had demanded the release of Abassi Madani and Ali Belhadj , the top two leaders of the banned Islamic Salvation Front . Government officials later said that demand had been dropped .</TEXT>
