   <HEADLINE> BOOKS &amp; AUTHORS : A JOURNAL NOT JUST OF SIGHT BUT . . . ; A NEWPORT BEACH COMPANY EXPANDS THE CONCEPT OF PUBLISHING WITH MULTIMEDIA PACKAGES THAT COMBINE QUALITY VOLUMES WITH AUDIO TAPE , VIDEO AND CD / ROM DISKS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Anthology : Peter Max , &quot; an upcoming title from an innovative new publishing_house in Newport Beach , canvases the life and work of the renowned pop artist who soared to fame in the psychedelic ' 60s with his kaleidoscopic style and cosmic themes . But the book is just for starters . Accompanying the heavily illustrated , large-format book is a videotape chronicling the past 30 years of Max ' s career and an audio tape in which the artist shares his insights into the creative process and imagination . But most fascinating of all is an interactive CD / ROM in which readers at their computer terminals can examine Max ' s work in both &quot; virtual &quot; and &quot; real-time &quot; formats . The virtual journey transports the reader into a gallery with a choice of hallways , each reflecting a decade or theme in Max ' s work . Face a particular painting , and you can use your computer mouse to call_up a &quot; curator &quot; who provides information about the work or the era in which it was painted . Or you can call_up text on the subject . Or Max himself might appear on the screen and talk to you . You can also &quot; morf &quot; -- or blend -- one painting into another . In the &quot; real-time &quot; format , you can watch the artist painting in his New York City studio and select different angles to view his work-in-progress . It ' s sort of a day in the life of Peter Max as he works_on a variety of projects -- from painting to sculpting to etching . You can even watch him standing_in front of a window drinking a cup_of_tea . * Welcome to book publishing in the ' 90s -- at least at Donovan Publishing , a company whose goal is to combine &quot; the best of the past , present and future. &quot; The Peter Max package is one of a number of multimedia book packages due out from the Newport Beach company in the coming months . &quot; What it does is it really expands the information you ' re reading in the book , &quot; said publisher Paul Sumner , co-founder and CEO . &quot; I think all people have a feeling that it would really be neat to see what ' s happening when they ' re reading about anything . What the CD / ROM does is give you an opportunity to witness in motion things that are happening in the book. &quot; Sumner , 47 , who had a major marketing success in the sports trading_card industry in the late ' 80s with his creation of the Upper_Deck Co. , co-founded Donovan Publishing with his sister , Win Fiandaca , in 1990 . &quot; When we started_out , there was nobody doing this , to our knowledge , &quot; said Fiandaca , 52 , the company ' s president . &quot; We ' ve now seen a_few of the mainstream publishers coming_out with books that have ( music ) CDs or tapes with them . But to our knowledge no one is developing as complete a package as we are , and certainly not with a CD / ROM. &quot; Donovan Publishing is launching its first book this month : Buddy Ebsen ' s autobiography , &quot; The Other Side of Oz. &quot; It is one of the more traditionally published books -- minus the multimedia addenda -- on the drawing board at Donovan . At $ 24.95 , it also is one of the more traditionally priced . The publishing_company ' s emphasis , however , is_on creating limited-edition multimedia book packages . The first , due in February , is &quot; Animation : The Art of Friz Freleng. &quot; The leather-bound book , published in a 4 # 000-copy limited_edition , chronicles the career of the five-time Oscar-winning animation pioneer -- from his days at Warner Bros . ( Bugs , Porky and company ) in the ' 30s through the Pink Panther in the ' 60s . The package includes an autographed book , a videotape featuring cartoon clips and interviews , an audio tape compilation of animation highlights of the artist directing music segments , an illustrated Animator ' s Workbook and three new sericels created by Freleng , who is 88 . The Freleng package , complete with collection case , will retail for $ 1 # 200 . The limited_edition Peter Max package , due out later this year , will include a signed 12-by-12 serigraph , with the whole works retailing for a cool $ 2 # 500 . The book packages , not surprisingly , will be sold in selected art_galleries . Despite its multimedia approach to publishing , at Donovan , the book ' s the thing . The leather-bound , &quot; packaged &quot; books are billed as being of heirloom quality . Even the Ebsen book was printed on a high-grade coated white_paper with the highest grade binding , and it contains more_than 125 photographs strategically placed throughout the narrative ( as opposed to traditional eight- or 10-page photo section in the middle of a book ) . In creating the company , Sumner said , they wanted to &quot; make_sure that we maintained the traditional value in book publishing while we ' re getting the reader -- or participant -- involved in the other media. &quot; Sumner has a history of innovation . A pioneer in the application of holographic technology -- he was the first to produce a &quot; white light projection hologram &quot; while studying at Cal State Long_Beach in the early ' 70s -- Sumner created Upper_Deck in 1987 after a career in sales and marketing for various Southern California printing_companies . Upper_Deck , which relocated from Yorba Linda to Carlsbad in 1991 , revolutionized the sports trading_card industry by offering high-quality cards featuring full-color photographs of athletes in action on both sides of the cards , with a small hologram of the company logo to prevent counterfeiting . Within three years Upper_Deck became one of the nation ' s leading trading_card manufacturer . In 1990 , Sumner was just off his first vacation in three years when he retired as company president to develop other creative projects . ( He ' s still one of the Upper_Deck owners and is_on the board of directors. ) Sumner had conceived_of the idea for Upper_Deck after taking his son to buy baseball_cards , but it was his late father who supplied the incentive in coming_up with idea to start a book publishing_company . His salesman father , Merton Sumner , had written prolifically all his life , and when he died in 1981 he left_behind several cardboard boxes full of his short_stories , poems and other writings . &quot; When he was living we always talked_about getting Dad ' s things published , &quot; said Sumner , who called his sister , who was working_on her bachelor ' s degree in English at Arizona State University . With her literary background and his printing background , the pair formed Donovan Publishing , named for their father ' s middle name . Their intention was to publish their father ' s writings , including a complete manuscript for a book he wrote_on a humanistic approach to alcoholic recovery . They put their father ' s writings on the back burner , however , as the concept of the company expanded . At the time , Sumner said , he was intrigued by the idea of audio books and noticed that no one was really packaging tapes and books together . Taking that concept further , he envisioned publishing traditional , well-crafted books but including with the books other items of interest that would complement the subject_matter . In other words , he said , &quot; it was like a bridge between traditional publishing and the new media coming_down the pipeline -- which is your interactive laser disks , CD / ROMs and audio / video in a collection of some sort. &quot; Still , he emphasizes , &quot; to us at Donovan Publishing the book is the most important part of the package , &quot; from the written word to the way the book is presented , &quot; right down to the way your senses react to it when you first open the book -- the traditional leather smell and the touch. &quot; Fiandaca says she thinks_of Donovan Publishing as a &quot; kind of a shot in the arm to the publishing industry , to pump a little life into books that I now see on the bookshelf in the stores . &quot; You walk into store and pick_up a book , and you have plain newsprint paper and pictures usually clumped together , &quot; she said , adding that she has purchased books in which the pages have separated from the spine even before she finished reading them . &quot; What we wanted to do right from the start was to have a very high_quality paper and pictures throughout . In other words , upgrade the product. &quot; Indeed , just as Upper_Deck spurred other sports card companies to upgrade their products , Fiandaca hopes Donovan will have a similar beneficial effect on the book publishing industry . &quot; We like to think what we ' re doing at Donovan is going_to be generalized around the marketplace so that the end result will be that the reader is going_to have a finer book to own , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
