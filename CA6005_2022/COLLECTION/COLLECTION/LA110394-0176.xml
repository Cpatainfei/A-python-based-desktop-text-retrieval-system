   <HEADLINE> EAST VALLEY FOCUS : SYLMAR ; SIDEWALK ASTRONOMY PROGRAM SCHEDULED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Forget Cruise as the Vampire Lestat . Forget DeNiro as Dr. Frankenstein ' s monster . For some real full-moon action , check_out the Sylmar branch of the Los Angeles Public_Library on Nov . 16 . There , the public can peer at the solar_system through telescopes , check_out craters on the full_moon , and take a gander at Saturn and possibly Jupiter . At a special &quot; Sidewalk Astronomy &quot; program to be held at the library from 6 to 8 p.m. , members of an amateur astronomers group from Santa Clarita will set_up their scopes for public viewing , offering insight into some murky universal matter , including nebulas , dust lanes and galaxies . &quot; Under really good_conditions , you might be able to see the Andromeda galaxy , &quot; said LaVerne Booth , one of the astronomers who will be there with her eight-inch telescope . &quot; There will be a full_moon , and a lot of city light , too , so we ' ll probably see a lot of the moon and Saturn , &quot; Booth said . If it ' s cloudy or raining , the astronomers plan to set_up a slide show inside and conduct a question-and-answer program . The Sidewalk Astronomy program was started a_few years ago by Dana Eklund , a librarian at the Benjamin Franklin Branch Library . An amateur astronomer , Eklund invited some of his friends to set_up their telescopes at a public_library and answer questions posed by curious stargazers . &quot; It ' s been really successful , &quot; Eklund said . &quot; We ' ve done most of the programs in the Los Angeles area -- some have drawn as_many as 200 people -- and the Sylmar program is one of the first we ' ve scheduled in the Valley. &quot; For information about the program , call Eklund at ( 213 ) 263-6901 .
