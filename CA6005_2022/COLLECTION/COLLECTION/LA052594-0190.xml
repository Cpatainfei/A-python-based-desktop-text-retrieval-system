   <TEXT> Spoleto ' s New Era : The Spoleto Festival U.S.A. opens a scaled-down 18th season today -- without Gian Carlo Menotti , the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer who established the prestigious Charleston , S.C. , festival in 1977 as a companion to a similar Italian festival . Menotti , 82 , left last fall_in a dispute over festival finances and who would head the annual event after he retired . This year ' s festival -- with a reduced budget of $ 4.2 million -- will run only 12 days instead of the traditional 17 . While opera , dance and chamber_music remain the festival ' s mainstays , new General_Manager Milton Rhodes has also booked more mainstream fare this year , including country star Roseanne Cash and jazz singer Cassandra Wilson , as well as music composed by the late Frank Zappa . &quot; We ' re beginning a new era built_on a foundation of 17 years , &quot; said Charleston Mayor Joseph P . Riley Jr . * On Tap at South Coast : The world_premiere of &quot; Green Icebergs , &quot; a comedy of modern manners by Newport Beach playwright Cecilia Fannon , will be produced on South Coast Repertory ' s Mainstage Oct . 14-Nov . 20 .

' next Caped Crusader sequel , &quot; Batman Forever. &quot; Producers passed_over Robin Williams , who had long coveted the role of the villain , reportedly causing a rift between Williams , his agency -- Creative Artists Agency -- and the studio .

Michael Keaton , who has played Batman in prior films , will likely star but nothing has been finalized , sources said . * An American Takeover ? : The victory at Cannes of controversial American director Quentin Tarantino ' s &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; has sparked fears that the world ' s top film festival has turned its back on traditional foreign &quot; arty &quot; fare and sold_out to Hollywood . American actor-director Clint Eastwood , himself a controversial choice as president of the festival ' s 10-member jury , brushed_aside these suggestions , but French newspapers on Tuesday put the blame squarely on Eastwood ' s shoulders , saying that he had done his utmost to defend U.S. colors . Eastwood called the voting a &quot; democratic decision &quot; but said he was bound by festival rules not to discuss the prizes . Festival director Gilles Jacob also dismissed the suggestions , saying the festival had no tradition to stick_to . &quot; We ' ve always had some juries which go_for more popular films or for more art films . There ' s no law , &quot; he said . POP / ROCK Virgin Inks Body_Count : Rapper Ice-T ' s hard-rock band Body_Count -- which left Warner Bros . Records in early 1993 after protests over its song &quot; Cop Killer &quot; -- has signed with Virgin Records , confirming earlier reports in The Times that the label was pursuing a deal with the band .
