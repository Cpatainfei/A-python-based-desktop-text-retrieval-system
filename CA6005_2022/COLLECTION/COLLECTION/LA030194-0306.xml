   <HEADLINE> GLOBOCARS : THE NEXT CENTURY ; THE NATION that ' s MOST OPTIMISTIC ABOUT GROWTH ; SOUTH_KOREA IS THE ONLY COUNTRY WITH BOTH A NOTABLE INDUSTRY OF ITS OWN AND A BOOMING DOMESTIC MARKET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> South_Korea is not what one would call motorist-friendly . In the parking_lots of apartment complexes , spaces are so rare that cars are left in lanes , unlocked so other motorists can push them out of the way when they want to pull_out . Most homes have no room at all for parking . Taxes make_up as much as 40 % of the price_tag of a new car and drive the cost of gasoline to more_than three times U.S. levels . Yet , by the year 2000 , virtually every household in South_Korea is expected to own at least one car . The era of &quot; motorization &quot; is under way ; and with it , Korean auto_makers , which now stir only passing interest from international rivals , are emerging as major global players . Hyundai , which produced 960 # 300 cars , trucks and buses in 1993 , appears certain to add its name this year to the elite ranks of 12 world auto_makers with production of more_than 1 million units . Kia also is expected to join the club before the turn_of_the_century . By the year 2000 , the Korean auto industry is expected to turn_out at least 3.2 million vehicles and brush shoulders with Canada as the world ' s fifth-biggest producer ( Japan , the United States , Germany and France will head the list ) . Last year , production edged above 2 million . * Exports , which reached 630 # 000 last year , are expected to surpass the 1 million mark by the turn_of_the_century -- a conservative estimate since this year ' s prospect for overseas sales is 815 # 000 vehicles . Rhee Du Whan , senior fellow of Hyundai Research Institute , put his turn-of-the-century forecast at 1.6 million . And as a measure of enthusiasm , South_Korea ' s Big Three auto_makers -- Hyundai , Kia and Daewoo -- have announced plans to challenge Japan by building factories to assemble 2 million vehicles a year in the next decade in developing countries that ban imports of finished products . No other nation ' s auto industry is as optimistic as South_Korea ' s on opportunities for growth . This , for instance , is the only nation that possesses both a booming domestic market and a notable industry of its own . In addition , it sits in Asia , the region expected to provide the fastest market growth in the next decade . Japan , North_America and Europe , by contrast , have strong industries but do not anticipate exceptional growth . And , at least until the turn_of_the_century , South_Korea ' s domestic market will remain unsullied by imports , auto_makers agree , despite American trade negotiators ' knocks_on the door . Imports from Japan are banned overtly , and only about 4 # 000 cars from other countries are sold here each year . The next six years are crucial to the Korean industry because demand will slow after the turn_of_the_century . Replacements will become the main prop of growth , instead of first-time purchases , said Kang Soon Gon of the Ministry of Trade , Industry and Energy ' s transportation machinery division . There are problems , however . Despite the industry ' s tenfold growth in the past 12 years , Western economic analysts raise eyebrows at its expansion plans . &quot; The industry ' s production is so inefficient that just expanding won ' t solve its problems , &quot; said one diplomat who asked not to be named . &quot; Even at Hyundai , the cost structure is uncompetitive internationally . And with this background , the push to expand seems wildly unrealistic. &quot; Indeed , despite its 10.3 % production growth in 1993 , Hyundai ' s profits fell during the year -- to about $ 62.5 million on sales of around $ 8.8 billion , said Lee Sang Bae , an auto analyst at Dongsuh Research Institute . * Daewoo , meanwhile , is estimated to have lost $ 87.5 million in 1993 and is not likely to show a profit until 1995 , Lee said . Ssangyong , with a $ 25-million loss last year , will remain in the red until 1996 when it starts manufacturing passenger_cars , he added . Yet even the skeptical Western diplomat admitted that he would not have predicted the demand that now exists in the Korean market . He also praised Korean auto_makers ' &quot; gutsy CEOs. &quot; Technically , Korea has seven auto firms , but three of them are sister companies of Hyundai , Kia and Daewoo . The fourth independent , Ssangyong , manufacturers sports utility vehicles , buses and trucks . In the wings are the Samsung and Halla conglomerates , both of which plan to start manufacturing heavy trucks . Meanwhile , the potential for labor strife remains . &quot; Japan has no labor troubles at all , but . . . whether the ( Korean ) companies are in good_shape or bad shape , they always have a problem , &quot; said Ha Yung Ku , vice_president of Citibank here . But Korea ' s auto_makers remain optimistic . Despite a disastrous collapse in U.S. sales when American consumers suddenly turned their backs on Hyundai in 1989 , Korea is set to make a new effort in the American market . On Feb . 3 , Kia joined Hyundai in establishing its own dealerships in 11 Western states . Daewoo President Kim Tae Gou says his company &quot; is working_on &quot; exporting its own cars to the United States in 1996 . This time , the move is coming_after , rather than before , the establishment of a substantial base of exports elsewhere -- mainly Latin_America , Southeast_Asia and the Middle_East . And this time , Korean makers declare they intend to build_up after-service networks , unlike Hyundai when it made its 1985 splash into the American market . Rhee of Hyundai said that Korea could win a 5 % share of the U.S. market by 2000 , or about 500 # 000 cars . With help from the appreciation of the Japanese yen , Korea ' s cars in all ranges have regained a price advantage of between $ 1 # 500 and $ 2 # 000 over Japanese models , Kang said . Small cars now stand nearly equal in quality to Japan ' s , although medium-sized and large models lag far behind , the ministry official added . All four auto_makers continue to rely_on foreign help in technology -- Hyundai from Mitsubishi , Kia from Ford and Mazda , Daewoo from Honda and Suzuki , and Ssangyong from Daimler-Benz -- &quot; which shows they still have some things to learn , &quot; Kang said . &quot; But the gap will be closed quickly . Look how far we have come_with an auto-making history of less than 30 years , &quot; he added .
