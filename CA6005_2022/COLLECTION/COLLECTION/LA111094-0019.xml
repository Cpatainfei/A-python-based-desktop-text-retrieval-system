   <HEADLINE> FASHION / INSIDE OUT : NOW , FOR OUR NEXT TRICK . . .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It isn ' t easy to grab the limelight in the self-conscious , self-promotional world of fashion -- unless you are startlingly beautiful or tremendously powerful . Being neither , we ' ve decided to experiment with an unorthodox strategy we call &quot; fame by humiliation. &quot; The latest installment of our master_plan occurred in New York last week at a party hosted by New York magazine at Barneys New York : One minute we were analyzing American fashion trends with a husky-voiced French stylist . The next , we were gazing at the floor , where our Adrienne Vittadini knit skirt had fallen_into a crumpled heap around our ankles . &quot; Excuse me , &quot; we said casually . &quot; My skirt has fallen off. &quot; We discreetly pulled it back_up and , after a brief , humiliating moment , carried_on . Fortunately , most party-goers were too preoccupied with their own clothes to notice the deconstruction of someone else ' s . But those who did witness this triumph of gravity demanded an explanation . How could a skirt simply fall_off ? &quot; With very careful planning , &quot; we said . * The Politics of Fashion : Never mind if it ' s nippy . You ' d better not show_up wearing a fur on Sunset Boulevard , where the anti-fur forces are broadcasting their messages loud and clear . The Friends of Animals stapled fur_coats to its billboard . On the backs of the coats , a simple question : &quot; Get the Message ? &quot; Just down the street , the Humane Society ' s anti-fur billboard takes the cute and fuzzy approach by showing the animals themselves . Meanwhile , over on Rodeo Drive , Fendi -- the Roman fashion house founded nearly 70 years ago with furs -- just opened for business . Although it carries the Fendi signature handbags , ready-to-wear ( designed by Karl Lagerfeld ) , fragrance and accessories , the store has already done_well with its famous furs -- selling five in the first two days of business . &quot; Furs are coming_back very strongly and there ' s a big request for them , &quot; says Irwin Tauber , president of the Condotti Shops USA Inc. , owner of five Fendi shops in the United States , including the Beverly Hills site . But the customers have been primarily Japanese . &quot; There ' s no fur controversy in Japan , &quot; Tauber explains . * It Pays to Have a Wife Who Works Out : What to do when you are confronted with large goody bags that weigh a ton ? Hand them to your supermodel wife who ' s used to working_out , or at least hefting the kids . that ' s what Rod Stewart did at the recent Carousel of Hope Ball when confronted with big Guess and Revlon gift bags . The Mrs. , Rachel Hunter , obliged and they both laughed all_the way to the car . * Fragrance Free : The University of Minnesota ' s School of Social_Work has prohibited its 250 students from wearing perfumes , colognes and other scented products , reports the Associated Press . The ban is a response to a puzzling new affliction called multiple chemical sensitivity-environmental illness , in which even a whiff can cause temporary paralysis . &quot; We ' re not the smell police , &quot; said Jean Quam , director of the school . &quot; When people get educated about it , they still may think it ' s crazy but they also realize perfumes can physically make people sick. &quot; But a perfume-industry representative sniffed at the ban . &quot; I don ' t think that ' s fair , &quot; said Regina Kulik , director of public relations for Christian Dior Perfume . &quot; Even furniture polish has a scent because people like it. &quot; * Straight Up : Speaking of fragrance , Rei Kawakubo , designer of Comme des Garcons , will make a rare appearance at Barneys New York in Beverly Hills today to launch her first fragrance . Kawakubo , writes Deyan Sudjic in &quot; Rei Kawakubo and Comme des Garcons &quot; ( Rizzoli , 1994 ) , &quot; works hard and finds the social aspects of the fashion world an unwelcome chore. &quot; But the iconoclastic designer is making an exception , with appearances here and in New York . Like Donna Karan and Sonia Rykiel , Kawakubo produced her perfume in-house rather than license it to a beauty company . The result is refreshingly unorthodox -- from the whiskey flask-shaped bottle , which lies on its back , to the scent itself , which has no top note and so goes directly to the heart of the fragrance . * Support_System : Good things do come_in threes . Just ask David Dart . After winning California Designer of the Year and the Dallas Fashion Award , his company , Force One , has been acquired by Kellwood , a St . Louis-based apparel company . While Dart retains full creative control , he gets_to share the business headaches with someone else , he says . Not to mention the sweetest part of the deal : worldwide access to large-scale production sources through Melrose , a division of Kellwood in Chatsworth . &quot; we ' ll be right up there with DKNY and Calvin Klein , &quot; Dart promises . * Inside Out is published Thursdays .</TEXT>
