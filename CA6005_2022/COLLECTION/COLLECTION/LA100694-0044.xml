   <HEADLINE> RED ALERT FOR THE RED_LINE ; U.S. HALTS FUNDING AMID CONSTRUCTION PROBLEMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Is there a systemic problem within the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that is causing sloppy and poorly monitored construction on the Metro Rail subway ? If so , that could jeopardize federal funding for Los Angeles ' huge mass transit project . On Wednesday the Federal Transit Administration ordered a halt in federal funding for the Red_Line until questions regarding construction and management of the multibillion-dollar subway -- the biggest public works project in the country -- are resolved . The federal agency also ordered a continued halt of tunneling in Hollywood , which already had been suspended because of surface sinkage and failure of braces . NO DOUBT : These stunning developments should dispel any doubt about the need for a make-over of the MTA . That should include dissolving the Rail Construction Corp. , the MTA subsidiary created specifically to build the subway in partnership with private-sector contractors . &quot; We perceive there to be inadequate management controls at the ( MTA ) for executing the ( subway ) project , &quot; FTA Administrator Gordon J . Linton wrote in a letter informing the MTA of the freeze in federal funding . Much of the culpability for the construction problems rests with the RCC . The subsidiary not only has it own board of political appointees who recommend changes and contract awards to the MTA ( itself governed by a 13-member board of elected officials ) but also has quality-control oversight and monitoring responsibilities . The RCC assumed authority over rail construction when the Southern California Rapid_Transit District merged with the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission in 1990 to form the MTA . The current structural relationship between the RCC and the MTA obscures accountability . Each time a problem has surfaced , RCC officials insist procedures were adequately followed . Yet new problems seem to emerge constantly . When The Times first reported trouble with tunnels in the subway ' s Downtown leg , MTA Chief_Executive_Officer Franklin White ordered an outside review , which later verified some problems in construction and management . NO END : The latest problem , involving tunneling in Hollywood , prompted White last week to order another outside review . Separately , on Tuesday -- a day before the federal censure -- MTA officials issued a scathing condemnation of_their_own based on MTA inspection records . They said the reports &quot; strongly indicated &quot; that the tunneling contractor had failed to place high-strength concrete or grout in joints of the outer shell along a mile and a half of tunnel beneath Hollywood Boulevard and Vermont Avenue . That failure is not going_to bolster public confidence in the safety of those tunnels . White has made a proposal to dissolve the RCC , a proposal that will be considered by the MTA board . MTA Board Chairman Ed Edelman must convene board_members as soon as possible to discuss this and other actions necessary to restore credibility -- and federal funding -- to Metro Rail .</TEXT>
