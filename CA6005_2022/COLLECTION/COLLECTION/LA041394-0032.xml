   <HEADLINE> THE FALL COLLECTIONS / NEW YORK ; OH , YES -- THERE WERE CLOTHES , TOO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For all_the clamor about skirt lengths , colors and commercial appeal , do not for a minute believe that the fall fashion shows unfolding here are solely about clothes . To varying degrees , they are about atmosphere and attitude , promotion and presentation , all exploited to create the impression something new and fascinating is transpiring . The thousand or so witnesses to this biannual rite are made to feel as if they ' re a privileged pack of seers who understand the significance of a shrunken mohair sweater far better than the bewildered masses . New , new , new is their mantra . Would Todd Oldham ' s collection of wacky , madly patterned , rainbow-colored clothes seem quite so appealing without Julia Roberts , Susan Sarandon and Mariah Carey clapping in the front row and Cindy Crawford and transvestite Billy Beyond cavorting down the runaway ? Would Oscar de la Renta ' s opulent , Far Eastern-inspired creations appear just as dazzling without an army of Beautiful People -- Nan Kempner , Carolyne Roehm , Lynn Wyatt -- in_attendance and a procession of super-models arrayed in a blaze of costume jewelry ? Although no one is suggesting that collections be displayed on hangers in showrooms , the centralized , circus_tent venue has designers so carried_away by hype and hullabaloo that the clothes get lost . The contrived excitement preceding Oldham ' s evening show -- the crush of photographers surrounding Roberts , the preening hordes of groupies -- was a prelude to a chaotic grab bag of styles ranging from tie-dyed velvet jeans and shrunken chenille sweaters to skintight beaded gowns worn with jeweled hair clips and floor-grazing fake furs . The clothes practically screamed , &quot; Hey , Look_at Me ! &quot; which explains why Oldham is the label of choice among club crawlers and movie_stars . Among the zany styles were some salable items , such_as classic pin-striped suits and flippy skirts topped by little jackets with fake fur collars and cuffs . But it was the campy creations -- riotously colored patchwork jackets , pearl-studded fishnet gowns , velvet slip dresses dangling with pompons -- that drove the audience wild . Anna Sui ' s fashion circus lacked Oldham ' s star power -- Vanessa Williams , Sofia Coppola and daddy Francis were pretty much ignored by the paparazzi -- but it overflowed with groupies arrayed in black leather , spiky platinum hair , silver backpacks and nose_rings . Sui didn ' t send anything particularly witty or novel down the runway , unless you consider Day Glo-colored fake fur , pleated cheerleader skirts , rubberized T-shirts and -- what else -- shrunken mohair sweaters news , and most of the fashion crowd doesn ' t . Still , Sui ' s giddy , riotously colorful creations had a sort of loopy charm that summoned up visions of little_girls dressing_up in mommy ' s finery . Fake fur_coats as fluffy as bath_mats , bright Lycra jumpsuits and flippy Lurex slip dresses were gussied_up with heaps of gangly plastic jewelry , spike-heeled boots and pompon ski_caps . Except for some popcorn-knit sweaters , suede vests and plaid mohair suits , most of the clothes were fun and nonsense , which suits Sui ' s fans just fine . * The atmosphere surrounding De La Renta ' s show was , as one would expect , calm and civilized . Attractive , navy-suited attendants escorted guests to their seats adorned with tiny packages of the designer ' s Volupte perfume . In this circle , rings were square-cut diamonds on fingers , not gold hoops in noses . Sure to delight De La Renta ' s gilded gang was a big , luxurious collection featuring short , slender clothes in spice colors and burnished paisleys paired with spotted fake furs and whimsical little hats shaped like pagodas . The strong Far Eastern flavor -- Mandarin collars , tassels , embroidered velvets resembling Oriental carpets -- seemed more Orient Express than Bistro Garden . De La Renta ' s evening extravaganzas , exemplified by chiffon paisley pants floating beneath a multicolored sequin-embroidered jacket rimmed with fake cheetah , were way over the top , even for the diamond-by-the-yard brigade . In contrast to De La Renta ' s too-rich feast , Bill Blass presented easy tailored clothes in lively color combinations -- mint green and pink was a favorite -- worn by models with long , shiny hair , subtle makeup and very little jewelry . Blass caters to the same over-40 socialite as De La Renta , but rarely have the two designers been so far apart style-wise . Women unembarrassed by excess will go_with De La Renta ; those who prefer understated luxe , such_as a fragile gray lace cocktail_dress concealed beneath a camel polo coat , will choose Blass . Swing coats , cuffed trousers , tailored jackets over vests and thick fabrics , including double-faced wool melton , dominated the daytime scene . For evening , amber or bronze cut-velvet pants were teamed with tunics or tweed jackets . A layered chiffon halter dress with a jeweled bolero was the ticket for more formal wingdings . * One of the loveliest surprises of the week was the tiny , informal breakfast show held by Vera Wang at the Regency Hotel . Although she has been pigeonholed as a bridal designer ( and creator of Nancy Kerrigan ' s skating outfits ) , her new_line of evening ready-to-wear should make Wang a fashion force . Holly Hunter , Sharon Stone and Marisa Tomei are already members of her fan club , which is sure to grow by the time the Oscars roll_around again . Wang ' s chic , minimalist styles , most of them in black or navy crepe and tissue-thin layers of chiffon , looked serene and sexy in a Grace Kelly sort of way . Her signature sheer illusion back and sleeves appeared on long , sinuous dresses and a_few frothy taffeta ball_gowns inspired by British designer John Galliano . White satin cuffs , a ripple of tiny satin buttons down the back or a sliver of antique gold lame were other Wang details . The clothes were elegant but fresh and young , a combination rarely seen , unfortunately , on the runways . * Next : The collections of Richard Tyler , Anne Klein , Ralph Lauren , Donna Karan and Calvin Klein .</TEXT>
