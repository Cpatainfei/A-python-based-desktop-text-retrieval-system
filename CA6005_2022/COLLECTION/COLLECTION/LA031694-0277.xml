   <HEADLINE> NIXON HEARS_OUT ZHIRINOVSKY AT CLOSE OF MOSCOW TRIP ; RUSSIA : RADICAL LEADER REPEATS DUBIOUS IDEAS . THE EX-PRESIDENT REPORTEDLY SAYS HIS IMPORTANCE HAS BEEN OVERBLOWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Richard Nixon , the former American President , wound_up an 11-day &quot; fact-finding &quot; mission to Moscow on Tuesday by hearing out Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , the Russian master of hyperbole . In 80 minutes , Nixon got an earful . Among the dubious assertions Zhirinovsky made in their closed-door meeting were : * 300 million Muslims are massing on Russia ' s southern border and could take_over the country . * Zhirinovsky , who is determined to stop them , is so popular that he is certain to win Russia ' s 1996 presidential election . * Radical democrats , who have fallen from power in the Russian government , are determined to stop him . With American support , they are plotting a military coup to shut_down Parliament , in which Zhirinovsky is a leading figure , and install a dictatorship under President Boris N . Yeltsin . This was vintage Zhirinovsky , from the blowhard jingoist who ranted on television last fall , appealing_to Russians ' fears of economic and ethnic turmoil and capturing the biggest vote for any party in December ' s elections . But this time he was speaking_to a former U.S. President , an influential figure who will convey impressions about Russia to President Clinton and other Western leaders who are concerned , even alarmed , that Zhirinovsky ' s rise means Russia is slipping back into the enemy camp . Pointedly snubbed by Clinton during a summit with Yeltsin here two months ago , Zhirinovsky arrived_at Nixon ' s hotel suite determined to fix that impression . Under questioning by the American , Zhirinovsky tried to sound &quot; benign and responsible , &quot; Nixon spokesman Dmitri Simes said . Zhirinovsky disavowed past statements that espoused fascist , anti-Semitic and imperialist views . He handed Nixon a copy of his autobiography , &quot; The Last Dash South , &quot; to deliver to Clinton , with a handwritten message inside the cover : &quot; I don ' t want to be misunderstood by you. &quot; &quot; I would like Mr. Clinton not to be afraid of me and my party , &quot; Zhirinovsky explained to reporters afterward . &quot; We are not a fascist party . We are not an anti-Semitic party . . . . We are the party that is against any violence , and we are ready to prove our superiority through elections. &quot; If Clinton reads the book , he might be forgiven for viewing Zhirinovsky as an imperialist . It ends with a vision , glorious to the author , of Russian soldiers advancing to the Indian_Ocean . In his meeting with Nixon , Zhirinovsky could not help sounding like the racist he said he is not . &quot; He did say that the greatest threat to mankind is the Muslim threat , &quot; Simes recalled . &quot; He said , ' But how would you react if Negroes took_over major white cities in the United States ? ' . . . He said that is like what is happening in Russia , that people from the Caucasus , the southern mafia , are everywhere , and that upsets the Russian people a great_deal , and we have to respond to this sentiment. &quot; Nixon , making his 10th visit to Russia , sought audiences across the political spectrum but set a condition for receiving Zhirinovsky -- there would be no joint appearance in public . The elder_statesman said nothing to reporters after the meeting . But on Monday , he described Zhirinovsky as &quot; a brilliant political tactician &quot; who &quot; pushes hot-button issues that are totally irresponsible. &quot; He added , &quot; I would seriously doubt that the Russians , who are very serious people , would consider him &quot; as their next president . Of Zhirinovsky , a Nixon aide said : &quot; He ' s smart , articulate and unburdened by an excessive concern for the truth . He confronted his past statements by denying he ever made them or explaining them in a different light . He ' s not a devoted anti-Semite but an opportunist . He speaks_to the mood of his audience . &quot; President Nixon confirmed his impression that Zhirinovsky is a serious player whose importance is overblown in the United States , &quot; the aide added . That assessment seems to be confirmed by recent defections of three leading members of Zhirinovsky ' s party , which could undermine its strength in the Duma , or lower house of Parliament . Among them are Viktor Kobelev , its No . 2 deputy there , and Anatoly Kaspirovsky , a TV hypnotist . Kobelev said last month that he was quitting to protest Zhirinovsky ' s friendship with German neo-fascist leader Gerhard Frey and his threats to wage war on the West if it launches air strikes against Bosnian Serbs , to create nuclear holocaust in Germany and to blockade Japan .</TEXT>
