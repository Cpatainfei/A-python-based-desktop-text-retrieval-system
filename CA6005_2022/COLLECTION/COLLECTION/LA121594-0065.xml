   <HEADLINE> SPECIAL EVENT ; PLEASE TOUCH THE EXHIBITS ; FROM THE BOWERS COMES KIDSEUM , WHERE THE LEARNING IS HANDS-ON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Bowers Museum executive_director Peter Keller went_out for a sandwich one day last spring , he didn ' t plan to pick_up anything more substantial than a ham on rye . But his lunch-hour walk turned_out to be the first_steps in an eight-month process that , through a serendipitous mix of good timing and combined efforts by Bowers and city staff and community members , is about to bring a new learning center to elementary school-age children and their families . On Sunday morning at 10 , the Bowers ' Kidseum will open its doors to the public . Housed in an 11 # 000-square-foot building two blocks from the Bowers ' main Museum of Cultural Art , it will feature interactive exhibits targeted to kids ages 6 through 12 , along with a children ' s art lab and gallery and a resource library for teachers . The majority of Kidseum ' s exhibits and programs will focus_on the three cultures emphasized at the main museum : The Americas , the Pacific Rim and Africa . Opening festivities , which will include storytelling , art activities , ethnic games and live music and dance , will be free to the public and will continue till 4 p.m. Kidseum is opening just a little more_than two years after a three-year , $ 12-million expansion of the main museum . And frankly , the plans for it came as something of a surprise even to the Bowers staff . On the day Keller took his lunchtime stroll , the Bowers administrators had been poised to begin a $ 165 # 000 renovation of their existing education center -- then housed in a down-at-the-heels former strip mall just north of the museum -- with funding from Santa Ana ' s Community Development Agency . But while walking down the alley that runs parallel to Main_Street from the museum , Keller noticed the vacant former California Federal Savings building on the corner of Main and 18th . It struck him that the museum could make_good use of the building for its educational_programs , and when he returned to the office , he mentioned the idea to Janet Baker , the Bowers ' chief of education and curator of Asian art . In the weeks that followed , planning sessions between Keller , Baker and Patricia Korzec , who would be named Kidseum coordinator , along with input from members of the city ' s redevelopment agency refined the initial plan from a simple expansion of existing programs to a full-blown children ' s museum . The process has been fast and furious from the start , Baker says . &quot; When Peter told me he ' d like to open ( Kidseum ) by Christmas , I said ' Christmas what year ? ' It ' s amazing to think all_of this came_about in just a_few months . We ' re still a little dizzy around here. &quot; City officials helped move the project along by quickly transferring the $ 165 # 000 earmarked for the old education center to the Cal Fed building project . Most of the money was spent modifying the building to comply with fire-safety regulations and to improve access for disabled visitors . The building is owned by the city ' s redevelopment office and is being loaned to the Bowers through a special operating agreement . Kidseum doesn ' t stand to be a big moneymaker for the Bowers : Admission is only $ 1.50 to $ 4.50 -- and the tickets also will be good for admission to the main museum . The money to develop exhibits and programs and to meet operating_costs has to come from somewhere , so the Bowers launched an $ 850 # 000 fund-raising_campaign to cover the next two years . So far , about $ 700 # 000 has been given or pledged by corporate and private donors , including the Weingart Foundation , Disneyland and New Line Cinema . Monterey Carpets has donated custom floor_coverings , and dozens of $ 100 donors have created hand-painted tiles to hang near the entrance . Although it won ' t be ready by Sunday , a 6-by-20-foot mural is being drawn by Chuck Jones , the internationally known creator of the Road_Runner and Bugs Bunny ( among other characters ) who lives_in Corona del Mar and is an honorary Bowers fellow . The mural , which will feature Jones ' characters , will hang_in the main hall . Donors of $ 50 or more gathered Sunday evening for a party that featured a sneak peek at the Kidseum , a dinner and a performance by Santa Ana ' s St . Joseph Ballet troupe of inner-city youngsters . The renovation process had been in high_gear for weeks . Five days before the party , construction workers still were installing lights and building exhibit areas . The Discovery Bridge , a free-standing suspension_bridge that visitors can use to cross into the main exhibit area , was a skeleton of poles and cross beams ; toilets awaiting installation stood sentry in the back parking_lot . Power_tools whined while Howard Stern blared on a worker ' s portable radio . Strolling among the chaos in shirt sleeves , Keller explained the motivation for establishing a separate children ' s center . Even though hundreds of schoolchildren tour the Bowers ' California history rooms every weekday , he said , &quot; we ' ve felt_for a long_time that we had underserved families with young children. &quot; He noted that Bowers patrons -- including his own 8-year-old son -- had expressed this view_as well . But as Baker pointed_out , children are not the only ones who might benefit from the new center . &quot; Our target audience is 6- to 12-year-olds , but by and large I hope we will educate parents and teachers , too , &quot; said Baker , who had put aside her academic work to schlep garbage bags full of cardboard bathroom_tissue tubes and empty tennis_ball canisters into the Kidseum art lab . &quot; This is a changing world . Our demographics are changing , and we are living_in communities where people are from diverse backgrounds , &quot; she continued . &quot; This is what the future holds , and ( we hope that the multicultural emphasis of Kidseum ) will help the younger generation get a step ahead. &quot; To that end , Kidseum organizers have established a central theme of adventure and exploration to carry visitors through the museum ' s separate areas . As he or she enters , a child will be given a Kidseum passport to be stamped at each area when the child completes a task . The first stop is the Explorer ' s Backpack station , where visitors can check_out one of 21 brightly colored packs , each containing a different self-contained lesson . Korzec showed how a parent and child would use the packs by demonstrating one labeled &quot; Bountiful Bazaars. &quot; Inside was a script , one of many written for the series by Korzec and Baker , to help the parent guide the child through lessons on textiles , communication and other aspects of various cultures . The scripts offer information and suggest questions to peak the child ' s observational and problem-solving skills . On the average , a backpack project takes about half an hour to complete , depending_on a child ' s age and the degree of difficulty , said Korzec , who has a bachelor ' s in art education and is completing a master ' s in museum education . &quot; Bountiful Bazaars &quot; asks you to identify a strip of African kente cloth , to estimate how many you would need to make a shirt for yourself , and to write your name using a set of hieroglyphic stamps . At other points in the lesson , one can trace figures with a Chinese brush , take a stab at chopsticks , finger the wool of a toy llama or send a message with a small African drum . Other titles in the backpack series include &quot; Cracked Pot , &quot; an exercise in archeology ; &quot; Fit for a King , &quot; a lesson in international textiles , and &quot; Swingin ' Safari , &quot; an overview of African instruments . Korzec says the format allows children to contrast and compare aspects of various cultures through hands-on study . &quot; So many times we segment the study of cultures , &quot; she said . &quot; But in the backpacks , kids will see there are a lot of similarities between them. &quot; From the backpack station , children can cross the Discovery Bridge into the main gallery , where they will find a variety of interactive exhibits . They can dig through trunks filled with ethnic costumes and stage impromptu performances on a raised stage . An organization called the Fashion Group of Orange County has donated many of the costumes and will continue to add_to the collection , Korzec said . The stage also may be used by visiting groups , she added ; on Sunday , Fiesta Folklorico , a children ' s dance troupe , will perform there . Nearby is a storytelling alcove with a glass wall facing the gallery . Here , children can pull_up &quot; magic carpet &quot; squares to listen to international tales spun by volunteer storytellers . On Sunday , the lineup will include Paul Apodaca , the Bowers curator of Native_American exhibits , telling Navajo and Hopi stories . Storytelling sessions , developed by Bowers docents using artifacts from the museum ' s collection , will continue Saturdays from 1 to 2 p.m. initially and will increase as time goes_on , according to Dottie Weingarten , the volunteer coordinator . Organizers hope soon to offer stories in Spanish and Vietnamese . The old Cal Fed bank_vault , its foot-thick steel door propped permanently open , has been transformed into the Time Vault , dedicated to Native_American history . Here , against murals painted by local artist Higgy Vasquez , children can explore the evolution of Native_American culture and traditions through a variety of artifacts , pretending to grind corn with a stone mortar and pestle , trying_on a ribbon shirt or beaded moccasins , or playing the hoop and dart game of the Yokuts tribe . Artifacts will be rotated every few months so repeat visitors will &quot; always be able to see and try new things , &quot; said Korzec . &quot; I don ' t think there ' s anything going_on in this place that ' s not touchable , &quot; she added . &quot; The whole concept is to be able to touch and experience . . . . I have a feeling that after they ' ve been in the Bowers ( main museum , where the artifacts cannot be handled ) , adults will enjoy ( Kidseum ' s ) accessibility just as much as the children. &quot; Next to the vault , a large art lab appointed with tables , sinks and a kiln will be open weekends from noon to 3 p.m. for drop-in art_classes . Projects will tie_in to the Kidseum exhibits ( on Sunday , children can make Native_American rain sticks and rattles ) . Korzec also plans to implement a &quot; Rainbow Exchange , &quot; a monthly program in which Kidseum visitors will create artwork to trade with_children of other cultures . The art received at Kidseum will be displayed in a children ' s gallery in the community room ( Korzec hopes to mount a display by children in Africa there in the spring ) . The second floor of the facility is for offices , a teachers ' resource room and storage . Members of the county ' s arts and business_communities have been instrumental in getting Kidseum on its feet , said Baker , noting that an advisory committee has helped her develop educational_programs and fund-raising and will help attract local artists to display and perform . Baker and Korzec also received direction from representatives of some of the area ' s established children ' s facilities . One was Cathy Michaels , executive_director of the 17-year-old Children ' s Museum at La Habra . Though she expressed some concern over competing with Kidseum for community funding , Michaels said she views the new facility as a positive addition to the county ' s cultural landscape . Karen Johnson is director of the Discovery Museum , which operates a hands-on history facility in Santa Ana as well as the Launch_Pad , an interactive science center in Costa Mesa ' s Crystal Court mall . Johnson hopes to open the Discovery Science Center , a 76 # 000-square-foot interactive learning center and Imax theater , on Main_Street in mid-1997 . If that happens , the Discovery Science Center would join Kidseum and the Bowers in Santa Ana ' s &quot; museum district , &quot; a downtown area city leaders hope to establish as the cultural heart of the county . Although her science center would be less than a mile away from Kidseum , Johnson doesn ' t view Kidseum as competition but welcomes it as a positive step for arts groups and their audiences . &quot; I ' m pleased , &quot; she said , &quot; because I think the City_Council and the city staff are making the arts a priority in Santa Ana . &quot; There aren ' t nearly enough cultural opportunities for kids in this county . Having a strong program like Kidseum will be a great advantage for us , and vice versa. &quot; * What : The Bowers Museum of Cultural Art ' s Kidseum children ' s center . * When : Opens Sunday , Dec . 18 .
