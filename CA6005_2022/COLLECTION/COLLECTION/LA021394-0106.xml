   <HEADLINE> ROSES ARE RED , GROWERS ARE BLUE AT INTERLOPERS ; FLORAL MARKET : DOMESTIC PRODUCERS MUST CONCENTRATE ON QUALITY AND ON TYPES OF FLOWERS THAT CANNOT SURVIVE SHIPPING FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES . VALENTINE ' S DAY IS INDUSTRY ' S &quot; CHRISTMAS. &quot;</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> All for love in the shape of a rose , men and women make summer days of winter nights in the snow-laden Taconic hills . In an icy valley 20 miles west of Albany , on a seven-acre indoor farm , bathed in the amber glow of simulated sunshine , hybrid roses grow on 6-foot-tall bushes pampered in a computer-controlled atmosphere . &quot; This is Kardinal , &quot; said greenhouse manager Phil Riccardi , 53 , curling his chapped fingers delicately around a vibrant bud . &quot; This is the most popular red . Very bright. &quot; Roses by any other name may smell sweeter -- the mauve Lavande , for instance , fills a room with heady perfume -- but the nearly odorless Kardinal , Royalty , Samantha and other reds rule for Valentine ' s Day . For Riccardi and his four brothers , and America ' s 225 other growers of florists ' roses , Valentine ' s Day is big business . According to industry figures , the holiday accounts_for more sales , at higher prices , than any other day . Wholesale prices for long-stemmed red roses typically double between mid-January and Feb . 14 , from about 50 cents to more_than $ 1 a stem . The Riccardis , owners of the 66-year-old Henry J . Seagroatt Co. , grow more_than 4 million roses a year on 152 # 000 bushes in greenhouses started by their grandfather . In the days leading_up to Valentine ' s Day , they ' ll cut about 300 # 000 velvety red buds . &quot; That one day accounts_for 20 % of our business , &quot; said Al Riccardi , 51 , Phil ' s brother and president of the company , which also sells carnations and other imported flowers from its wholesale warehouse in Albany . Americans spend $ 12.5 billion a year on floral products , according to the Floral Index , a trade group in Chicago . Sales of cut flowers have more_than doubled_over the last two decades . But these are hard_times for American growers . Many have thrown_in the trowel , unable to make a profit in a market flooded with low-priced blossoms from Colombia and other countries . &quot; In the last 21 years , we ' ve lost more_than 5 # 000 growers , &quot; said Dave Machtel , executive_director of the Floral Trade Council in Haslett , Mich . In 1971 , more_than 1.4 billion cut flowers , 4 % of them imported , were sold in the United States , according to the U.S. Department_of_Agriculture . In 1992 , sales topped 3.4 billion blooms -- 73 % imported . Carnation growers have been hardest hit by global competition . The number of domestic growers dropped from 1 # 525 in 1971 to 139 in 1992 . Imports now account_for more_than 84 % of the market . Rose growers have fared better , because roses don ' t ship as well as carnations . The number of U.S. rose growers declined from 323 to 225 over the last 20 years . Imports now account_for 55 % of the 1.2 billion roses sold annually in the United States . Eastern rose growers have been affected most by the imports . But in California , which produces 65 % of domestic roses , growers are keeping an uneasy eye on the budding business in Mexico . &quot; My market has completely changed , &quot; said Ron Enomoto , who grows roses in Half Moon Bay , Calif . &quot; We used to ship to people back East . Now , that market ' s been taken_over by imports coming_into Miami from Colombia. &quot; He worries that imports from Mexico will take_over Western markets as trade_barriers fall_under the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . Johna Beall , owner of Beall ' s Roses in Seattle , grows roses on a 40-acre farm in Bogota , Colombia , where equatorial sunshine and moderate mountain temperatures provide perfect growing conditions . She sells 8 million roses a year in the United States , 1 million for Valentine ' s Day . Beall agrees with Floral Trade Council allegations that some Colombian growers are &quot; dumping &quot; roses in the United States at unfair prices . Growers who are staying afloat despite the flood of cheap flowers are those with the highest_quality product and best marketing skills , Beall said . &quot; We have to continually work to produce a better product for less money , &quot; Al Riccardi said . &quot; We ' ve expanded our greenhouses , we ' ve computerized them , we ' ve added lights . We choose the most productive varieties . We have to use energy very wisely. &quot; The Riccardis added a new complex of greenhouses to their first nine in the mid- ' 80s , doubling their growing space to 300 # 000 square_feet . Double-layer acrylic glazing provides better insulation than the old glass , but it still takes 300 # 000 gallons of oil to keep winter temperatures in the 70s . Soil has been replaced with a mixture of bark , peat_moss , and rock_wool , which is watered twice a day by pipelines injected with fertilizers . Two-thousand 1 # 000-watt sodium vapor lights bathe the plants in golden light all night long and on cloudy days . &quot; We ' re replacing sunlight with these lights , &quot; said Al Riccardi , raising his voice above the hum of greenhouse fans , the clickety-clank of steam_heating pipes and the clamor of the cutters ' rock radio . &quot; These high-intensity lights have allowed us to double our winter production. &quot; A computer controls everything : lights , cooling vents , irrigation lines , heat , fertilizer . Even the air is engineered for maximum plant growth , with carbon_dioxide increased to three times the level outdoors . Plant pests and diseases are a problem , complicated by Environmental Protection Agency plans to ban or limit certain chemical sprays , Al Riccardi said . &quot; This controlled atmosphere is ideal for fungus and insects as well as roses . Mildew is very difficult to control. &quot; In raised concrete beds 4 feet wide and 150 feet long , the roses form hedges 6 feet tall or more , supported by a network of steel wire . In shoulder-wide alleys between the beds , cutters search the walls of green for buds at just the right_stage of color and size . Cut roses with 26-inch stems are held_in buckets of water in a refrigerated warehouse for shipment within a day of cutting . &quot; We can ' t compete with Colombia on price , because labor there is so_much cheaper and they don ' t have our heating and electricity bills , &quot; Al Riccardi said . A poorly handled rose may hang its head and refuse to unfurl . Imports may be flown in out of water and held_on docks and in warehouses for as much as a week before reaching consumers . But Seagroatt roses are trucked in water within a day of cutting_to retail florists in eastern New York , Vermont , Massachusetts and Connecticut . They choose flowers that suffer in shipping . &quot; The more perishable it is , the better we ' ll be able to compete by offering quality , &quot; Al Riccardi said . &quot; We can sell our own alstroemeria for two to three times what we get for the South_American stuff. &quot;</TEXT>
