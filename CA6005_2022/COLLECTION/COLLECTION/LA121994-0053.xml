   <HEADLINE> BOOK_REVIEW ; A CAUSTIC COMEDY WITH A PLOT TOO DELICIOUS TO PASS_UP ; PLUCKING THE APPLE BY ELIZABETH PALMER , ST . MARTIN ' S PRESS / A THOMAS DUNNE , $ 20.95 , 272 PAGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ginevra Haye is an Oxford-educated art critic of some repute who cares nothing about her appearance . And why should she ? Self-employed , she is intent_on finishing an academic treatise and rarely leaves her cottage in Little Haddow ; she has few friends , because of graceless , clumsy manners and careless , corpulent looks ; and in any case her husband , Kevin , a bricklayer , is employed in Saudi_Arabia . Ginevra reserves most of her energy for intellectual work -- and her &quot; Little Haddow Kama Sutra &quot; as well , the journal in which she fantasizes a steamy romance with art_dealer James Harting , with whom she had her first sexual experience many years before . For the love of James , will Ginevra resolve to improve her figure and make the best of her attributes , thus forging a connection between her cerebral interests and her physical self ? For a time , especially after we learn that Ginevra is in fact losing_weight and seeking counsel on her attire , it seems that &quot; Plucking the Apple &quot; may be following the path blazed by Fay Weldon ' s wonderfully wicked &quot; Life and Loves of a She-Devil &quot; -- boy beds girl , boy deserts girl , girl takes furious revenge . That proves not to be the case , however ; neither Ginevra ' s appearance nor her journal come_to mean much in the novel , as if author Elizabeth Palmer had changed its plot midstream . Instead of focusing_on this character , as one might expect from the early going , Palmer instead portrays with dark humor the romantic entanglements of four marriages , none particularly attractive . &quot; Plucking the Apple , &quot; a bestseller in Britain , is a caustic comedy of domestic manners , and , if it ' s too diffuse and lightweight to rival Weldon ' s best and blackest humor , it won ' t be mistaken for a work by Anita Brookner , either . The Careys are the central couple in the novel : Jack , the rising artistic star at the gallery run_by James and Victoria Harting , and Ellen , Jack ' s long-suffering , indispensable wife . The gallery has scheduled an exhibition of Jack ' s new work , but as deadlines loom , the work , as usual , doesn ' t yet exist ; Jack has been too busy cheating_on Ellen to lift a paintbrush , and Ellen , at long last , is seriously thinking_of divorce . Things come_to a boil when Jack takes_up with James ' sister , Tessa Lucas -- gorgeous , socially ambitious , nearly nymphomaniacal , and married . Tessa proves more_than a match for Jack , being a woman as egocentric and willful as he , but with even less compunction and much less talent . Palmer describes Tessa ' s beauty as being &quot; so potent that it currently transcended the emptiness of her head , &quot; but that doesn ' t prevent Tessa from devising an ingenious scheme to enrage both Ellen and her own husband , the brooding poet , Alexander , and thus clear her way to become the second Mrs . Jack Carey . As Tessa blandly tells her brother about spouses , &quot; I don ' t want the one I ' ve got . I want a different one. &quot; Ginevra believes , we ' re told early in &quot; Plucking the Apple , &quot; that &quot; marriages were either made in heaven or in hell and there was not a great_deal in between. &quot; The hellish certainly dominate this novel : Ellen stays with Jack mostly for the children ' s sakes , Alexander with Tessa almost exclusively for her dazzling looks , Ginevra with Kevin purely for the sex , their intercourse being limited exclusively to the sexual . The Hartings alone appear to have a viable relationship , but only because of the art_gallery , it seems ; James suffers the often-insufferable Victoria in large measure because her ingratiating social skills are good for business . The one truly loving couple in the novel , ironically , is the battling Careys , for when synchronized -- which admittedly isn ' t often -- Jack and Ellen are capable of recovering the passion and trust of their courting days . It may_not come as a surprise , given the above , that &quot; Plucking the Apple &quot; ends equivocally . There are no happy reconciliations ; Ellen alone receives good news at the novel ' s close , learning that she may finally be able to embark_on a career commensurate with her abilities . Palmer doesn ' t tie together the novel ' s many loose_ends with much conviction or elegance , but it ' s only fair that she provides Ellen , the book ' s one attractive character , with a promising future . Ellen is described at one point as a &quot; born muse &quot; -- indeed , she inspires superior creative work , following lovemaking , in two characters -- but until the novel ' s conclusion she is far too busy taking_care of her husband and children and their home lives to be able to determine whether she might be an artist in her own_right . There ' s a feminist heart beating in this book , but Palmer , wisely , doesn ' t let it stop her from ridiculing equally the parties on either side of the battle of the sexes . Feel free to give &quot; Plucking the Apple &quot; to fans of Fay Weldon , and to men as well as women -- but on no account to a couple heading_off on their honeymoon .</TEXT>
