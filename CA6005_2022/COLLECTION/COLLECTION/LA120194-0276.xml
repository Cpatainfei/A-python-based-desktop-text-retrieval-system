   <HEADLINE> ESTATE PROJECT FOR ARTISTS TO OPEN IN L.A.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A New York organization designed to help artists with AIDS in estate planning will be in full operation in Los Angeles in January . The West Coast branch of the Estate Project for Artists With AIDS , established in New York in 1991 , will work with artists to preserve their work , including copyrights . &quot; Even the most famous and successful artists don ' t know what they need to know about legal affairs , &quot; Estate Project Director Patrick Moore said . &quot; Writing a will can seem like an admission of fatality , so a lot of times it ends_up being done_in an emergency situation , when the artist is very sick . Or not at all. &quot; The Estate Project will ensure that artists are provided with easily understood guidelines for creating an effective estate via publications and individual counseling . Through the program , artists will receive assistance with legal counseling , cataloguing and inventory of art , archives / documentation , emergency grants and fellowships to individual artists , grants for studio space and art materials . Expanded exhibition and presenting opportunities will also be available . This effort is the work of the Alliance for the Arts , a nonprofit organization dedicated to policy research , information services and advocacy for the arts .
