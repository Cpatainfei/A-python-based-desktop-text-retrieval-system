   <HEADLINE> BISHOPS URGE TOP ROLES FOR WOMEN BUT NOT PRIESTHOOD ; RELIGION : PRELATES SUGGEST THE STUDY OF SCRIPTURE AND PURSUIT OF PRESIDENCIES AT CATHOLIC UNIVERSITIES . GROUP SAYS SOME IN U.S. CHURCH ARE STILL GUILTY OF SEXISM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The nation ' s Catholic bishops adopted a resolution Wednesday encouraging women to assume leadership positions up_to -- but not including -- the priesthood . The statement recognized Pope John Paul II ' s recent affirmation that women cannot be ordained as priests , advocating instead that they seek other roles in the church , such_as pursuing studies in scripture , becoming presidents of Catholic universities and serving in non-ordained ministerial positions . For the first time , the bishops told their 59 million members that some elements of the U.S. church have been guilty of sexism . &quot; We have listened to the sounds of injustice and now come_to strengthen the bonds of peace , &quot; said Bishop Eugene J . Gerber of Wichita , Kan . &quot; We commit ourselves to enhancing the participation of women in every possible aspect of church life , &quot; the bishops said in their statement , approved on a vote of 228 to 10 . The bishops also adopted a resolution condemning violent behavior in all its forms , urging Catholics to oppose such actions as assisting with euthanasia and yelling at referees at athletic events . In a specific recommendation addressing an area of concern to U.S. women , the bishops said that , although the universal catechism does not use gender-neutral language , in this country the church should avoid using such terms as &quot; man &quot; or &quot; men &quot; when referring to all_of humanity . According to the bishops ' statement on women , entitled &quot; Strengthening the Bonds of Peace , &quot; a National Pastoral Life Center study found that women now hold 85 % of parish ministry positions open_to non-clergy . However , they have been slow to move_into high-ranking jobs , such_as diocesan chancellors , canon lawyers or marriage tribunal members and in some dioceses only priests hold those positions . The statement encourages dioceses to allow women to seek such jobs . Annette Kane , executive_director of the National Council of Catholic Women , a federation of 7 # 000 Catholic women ' s organizations , said she hopes that the statement will change some hearts and minds in dioceses where women are excluded from leadership roles . But others were disappointed that the resolution did not contain stronger language . Frances Kissling , president of Catholics for a Free Choice , an organization that supports the right to dissent from papal decrees , said that the plan falls_short_of real progress for women . &quot; There ' s a lot of good sentiment and a lot of good language , &quot; Kissling said . &quot; But until I see a written plan with some concrete goals as_to numbers of women they ' re going to hire , I ' m afraid they ' re not showing the political will to do the job. &quot; Studies by Kissling ' s group show that 19 % of the top church positions in the country were held by women in 1993 , up from 16 % in 1988 . The bishops ' resolution acknowledges that sexism , defined as &quot; unjust discrimination based on sex , &quot; is still present in some elements of the church . The bishops soundly rejected sexism , calling it sinful and , according to the report , &quot; contradicting the will of Christ. &quot; But the report also took_aim at radical feminist groups in a much-debated phrase that said : &quot; We . . . reject extreme positions on women ' s issues which impede dialogue and divide the church. &quot; The bishops called_for a &quot; moral revolution &quot; in confronting violence in America . &quot; Violence -- in our homes , our schools and streets , our nation and world -- is destroying the lives , dignity and hopes of millions of our sisters and brothers , &quot; the report said .</TEXT>
