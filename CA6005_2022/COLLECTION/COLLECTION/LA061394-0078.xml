   <HEADLINE> WEST COAST AGENCIES PICK UP TOP CLIO AWARDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Milk got_it . The &quot; Got Milk ? &quot; commercial featuring a historian trying to talk with his mouth full of peanut_butter won one of the most coveted awards in advertising Saturday night -- the Clio Award for the best television commercial of 1993 . And the complete ad_campaign for Apple PowerBook , which features diverse people who use the same personal_computer for a variety of reasons , won the Clio Award for the best multimedia ad_campaign of the year . Both of the big winners were created by West Coast ad_agencies : the California Milk Processor Board ad by the San Francisco agency Goodby , Silverstein &amp; Partners , and the Apple ads by the Los Angeles office of BBDO Worldwide . The eyes of the ad world were focused_on the West Coast over the weekend , as the 35th Annual Clio Awards ceremony snubbed New York City for the first time and held the &quot; Oscars of Advertising &quot; ceremony in San Francisco . For the Clio Awards -- if not Madison Avenue -- the event represented a substantial step back toward respectability . Its image was severely strained three years ago in New York City when disappointed ad executives stormed a stage to grab Clio statuettes after a botched Clio ceremony was halted . Ownership of the Clio Awards has since changed hands twice . Ad entries and attendance were up considerably this year . And ad executives say that the Clio Awards wisely gave an overdue nod to ad creativity by hosting the ceremony in a city generally regarded_as the current focal_point of the nation ' s best advertising . &quot; This is the country ' s creative hotbed , &quot; said Jim Smyth , executive_director and owner of the Clio Awards , who noted that the ceremony will return to San Francisco next year . Although California TV viewers are very familiar_with the &quot; Got Milk ? &quot; ads , few others are . It is a regional campaign rarely seen out of state . While the campaign always shows humorous examples of people running_out of milk at just the wrong time , the reason behind it is very serious : Milk consumption in the state has dropped 17 % since 1980 . Jeff Goodby , creative director , said the ads simply try to be honest about the occasions when people drink milk . &quot; We could make ads until we ' re blue in the face , but not many people are going_to come_in from jogging on a hot day and drink a tall glass of milk , &quot; Goodby said . The other big West Coast winner , BBDO / Los Angeles , won a Clio for its combined TV , print and billboard campaign for Apple Computer ' s PowerBook . Each ad asks : &quot; What ' s on your PowerBook ? &quot; Celebrities who are polar opposites list their reasons for using the same personal_computer . &quot; The only thing the people in them have in common is their PowerBooks , &quot; said Steve Hayden , chairman of the agency . Later this summer , Fox Network plans to run a TV special featuring the winning ads . A tiny Boston agency , Doyle Advertising &amp; Design , picked_up an impressive 11 Clios -- including nine for a public_service print campaign for the National Assn . of Atomic Veterans , a group of veterans who developed cancer after post World_War_II atomic tests .</TEXT>
