   <HEADLINE> TRUSTEES COMPLIED WITH MEETING LAW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * In response to your editorial , &quot; A Vote for Darkness &quot; ( March 24 ) : The first rule of elected officials should be to conduct the public business in public . Also , it does appear that legislative bodies of public agencies do too often use excuses to meet behind closed doors . To attempt to link these statements to the Santa Ana Unified School District trustees ' action to censure one of its own reflects a lack of understanding of the issue in_question and confused knowledge of the law . The issue was the procedure utilized to release confidential documents and not what price was offered or paid_for school sites . State law ( the Brown Act ) does allow closed-door meetings not only for personnel and litigation matters but also for real_property purchases or sales . Appraisals and attorney-client privileged communications related to directions given to negotiate the sale or purchase of property are proper closed-session discussion . It ' s obvious that if this process takes_place in public , it tips the school districts ' hand to prospective sellers or purchasers . Yes , the issue as_to whether the school_board was going_to pay too_much was of substantial interest to the public . But state law requires the State Allocation Board to thoroughly review any school district ' s purchase of real_property . This procedure protects and ensures the public ' s interest in not paying an unreasonable price . The Brown Act authorizes the release of confidential documents concerning proper closed-session matters only by a majority vote of the school_board or by court_order . Agreed , the job of elected officials is not to keep the taxpayers in the dark ; it is to explain and enlighten . But it is also to comply with the law and set an example of such , especially when they guide the education of our children . This is why a board_member was censured . Since there are valid ways to obtain the property ' s purchase_price and inform the public , the end did not justify the means . KEITH V . BREON Santa Ana Keith V . Breon is legal counsel for the Santa Ana Unified School District board .</TEXT>
