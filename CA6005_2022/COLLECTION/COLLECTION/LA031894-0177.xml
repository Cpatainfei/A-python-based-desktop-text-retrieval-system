   <HEADLINE> DESPITE ATTACKS , SINN FEIN LEADER CLAIMS IRA WANTS PEACE WITH BRITAIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The leader of the IRA ' s political wing , Sinn Fein , said Thursday that the republican guerrillas genuinely wanted peace , despite its mortar attacks on London ' s Heathrow airport . &quot; I remain convinced that the IRA is willing to deal positively with any new eventuality . It is crystal_clear that the IRA are interested in developing a peace process , &quot; Gerry Adams said in a St . Patrick ' s Day message . It was his most detailed assessment of an Anglo-Irish peace process since the_Irish Republican Army , fighting to end British rule_in Northern_Ireland , fired three salvos of mortars at the airport to demonstrate its ability to hit high-profile British targets . Adams was addressing party faithful in Belfast hours before Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds was to meet President Bill_Clinton to reaffirm support for the Downing Street peace initiative , which London and Dublin launched last year . Adams , the Sinn Fein president , said it was illogical that Britain refused his request for clarification of the Anglo-Irish plan after having held secret contacts with Sinn Fein and the IRA for more_than two years . &quot; Despite the hard-line posturing from British politicians , realism and accommodation are not impossible , &quot; he said of London ' s refusal to talk to Sinn Fein until it gets the IRA to lay_down its arms and itself renounces violence . &quot; Their ( Britain ' s ) current stance of refusing to provide clarification of the Downing Street Declaration , set against the background of three years of private contacts with Sinn Fein , is illogical , &quot; Adams said . He said he was certain that Sinn Fein will again be in contact with the_British government , despite Prime_Minister John Major ' s adamant refusal to talk to the party . Britain conceded last November that it had held secret communications with Sinn Fein and the IRA through intermediaries , but says the doors to further talks are now shut until Sinn Fein accepts the Downing Street peace framework . Adams said Sinn Fein favored an earlier blueprint drawn_up by himself and John Hume , head of the Social Democratic and Labor_party .</TEXT>
