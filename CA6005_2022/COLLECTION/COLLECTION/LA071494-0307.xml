   <HEADLINE> INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ; THE FALLING DOLLAR CLOUDS EUROPEAN COMPANIES ' PROFIT PICTURE ; TRADE : LARGE MULTINATIONALS DO AS MUCH AS HALF THEIR BUSINESS IN U.S. DOLLARS . WHEN THE GREENBACK FALLS , SO CAN PROFITS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In late April , Mercedes-Benz Chief_Executive Helmut Werner strode into a meeting , overjoyed with a big bank ' s latest forecast : The dollar was heading toward 1.80 marks from 1.66 by year ' s end , a hike that would add $ 263 million to the revenue of Mercedes ' North_American car operations . Werner isn ' t overjoyed anymore . With the dollar having fallen about 6 % against the mark in the last six weeks , to 1.5405 on Wednesday , and declining against other major European currencies , the profits of multinationals that depend_on the U.S. market are threatened . Large companies across Europe , such_as Mercedes parent Daimler-Benz in Germany , Elf Aquitaine in France and Hanson in Britain do as much as 50 % of their business in U.S. dollars . When the dollar falls , profits can follow . &quot; It ' s in the nature of U.K. public companies to have big international exposure , &quot; said Rob Buckland , European equity strategist at NatWest Securities Ltd . &quot; Some 25 % of the earnings of U.K.-listed companies come from the U.S. , so the dollar must have a very important impact. &quot; British companies ' total exposure to swings in the dollar can be even higher . Currencies in many Asian areas , such_as territory of Hong Kong , are pegged to the dollar to make trade easier . So when profits from Asian operations are included , some large British corporations wind_up with 40 % to 50 % of their earnings in dollars . To be sure , European companies have also been reaping the benefits of the ravaged dollar to go_on shopping sprees in the United States , snapping up companies whose price_tags have fallen along with the currency . For example , Roche Holdings of Switzerland is in the middle of purchasing U.S. firm Syntex Corp . for $ 5.3 billion . British companies have been fortunate that the dollar has not fallen as much against the pound as it has against the mark or the yen . The pound is up only about 3 % against the dollar since June 1 , trading at $ 1.5660 on Wednesday . In Germany , particularly in the auto industry , it ' s another story . Some analysts say the falling dollar may put more pressure on Mercedes and other German auto_makers to rescind some earlier price_cuts and raise U.S. prices for the 1995 model season , which starts this fall . When the dollar falls below 1.65 marks , car_makers don ' t easily make a profit on their exports to the United States and dollar-pegged Asian markets , said Joachim Bernsdorff , an analyst at Bank Julius Baer in Frankfurt . &quot; They lost money last year because of the exchange , &quot; which averaged 1.65 marks to the dollar in 1993 , Bernsdorff said . &quot; You don ' t see what they lost , because the German parent sells at_a_loss to a U.S. subsidiary so that the subsidiary can show a profit , &quot; he said . Although Mercedes and counterparts BMW and Porsche hedge against currency fluctuations , those hedges cover only six- to nine-month periods . &quot; The longer this goes_on , the more we would be worried , &quot; said Hans Christian Haas , a trader at Dresdner Bank who closely tracks the car industry . The United States takes 12 % of Mercedes ' sales and 15 % of BMW ' s output . Most of Volkswagen ' s VW brand cars sold in the United States are made in Mexico , but its Audi brand models are built_in Germany and also face pressure from a falling dollar . Dutch aircraft maker Fokker will also be significantly hurt by the weaker dollar . Though its production is based in guilders , aircraft sales are generally denominated in dollars . Fokker spokesman Leo Stein said the persistently low dollar is the main reason behind its cost-cutting efforts . Fokker &quot; adapted its cost structure when it became clear that the dollar fell structurally below 2 guilders , &quot; he said . The dollar has been below 2 guilders since July , 1991 . The company ' s two major stake holders , Deutsche Aerospace and the Dutch government , said recently that they would inject $ 566 million into cash-strapped Fokker . At Benetton , the Italian clothing manufacturer and retailer , about 70 % of revenue comes from outside of Italy . One-fifth of its sales are in dollars .</TEXT>
