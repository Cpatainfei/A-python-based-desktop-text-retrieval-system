   <HEADLINE> THE NEGLECTED LUXURY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In America , smoked fish is strangely overlooked , its use limited in many homes to occasional brunches of lox with bagels and cream_cheese ? But whatever the meal , nothing is simpler to serve , since smoked fish is ready to eat . On its own , it is one of the most elegant of first courses . Smoked salmon , for example , is a luxurious starter served at the finest of restaurants . Beyond that , smoked fish is also valuable as a flavoring . In green_salads it makes a tasty , light substitute for bacon , contributing a similar smoky flavor . Strips of smoked fish are terrific with neutral-tasting , quick-cooking foods such_as pasta and eggs . One of my favorite dishes at deli-type restaurants is lox and eggs . At home , I often make a quick-cooking dish of herbed noodles with smoked cod and roasted peppers . * Rice , too , benefits from the addition of smoked fish . A delicious rice salad I enjoyed in France featured smoked haddock , tomatoes , peppers , capers and parsley vinaigrette . In the Far East , I discovered a way to match fish with rice for breakfast . A bowl of congee ( the Chinese rice porridge otherwise known as juk ) was accompanied by small plates of savory items , including cured fish . It might seem like a curious combination , but it makes as much sense as lox with bagels , since a small amount of the fish flavors the bland , starchy food . African cooks have long recognized that smoked fish adds good flavor to other foods . They often cook it with greens , as in Zairian spinach with smoked whitefish . Smoked fish keeps well and is convenient to have_on hand for a quick meal . Some types , such_as smoked cod , haddock and herring , are reasonably priced . Even with expensive smoked salmon you can prepare economical dishes by combining the salmon with rice , pasta , eggs or vegetables ; a little goes_a_long_way . You can buy smoked fish at fish markets , delis and at the fish and deli departments of supermarkets . Most do not need cooking . The exceptions are smoked haddock , sometimes labeled finnan_haddie ( which requires brief poaching in milk ) and kippered_herring ( which is often broiled ) . * Interest in smoked fish seems to be growing , at least in my neighborhood . At my local market there are new kinds of smoked salmon in such enticing flavors as dill smoked salmon , pepper smoked salmon and even Cajun smoked salmon . * You can prepare this colorful , easy dish with a creamy sauce or as a leaner version with vegetable_oil . It is good with packaged barbecued cod , which turns the sauce bright orange , or with lox or smoked salmon . This is an adaptation from the cookbook I co-authored with Fernand Chambrette , &quot; La Cuisine du Poisson &quot; ( Flammarion : Paris ) . HERBED NOODLES WITH SMOKED COD AND ROASTED PEPPER 2 roasted green_pepper halves from jar or 1 fresh green_pepper , roasted 6 ounces smoked or barbecued cod , bones and skin removed 1 / 2 cup whipping cream or 2 tablespoons oil 1 / 2 pound dried herb-flavored noodles or fettuccine 2 tablespoons chopped green_onions 4 teaspoons chopped fresh tarragon , or 1 / 4 cup 1 / 8-inch-wide strips of basil leaves Salt Freshly ground pepper Cut roasted green_pepper halves into 1 / 4-inch strips . Cut cod into 1 / 2x1 / 2x1 / 4-inch dice . Bring cream to bare simmer in small saucepan . Add cod and heat through on low heat . If using oil , heat gently with cod over low heat . Cook pasta , uncovered , in large pan of boiling , salted water over high heat until tender but firm to bite , about 5 minutes . Drain well . Transfer to heated bowl . Add cod mixture and toss . Add pepper strips , green_onions , tarragon and salt and pepper to taste . Adjust seasonings to taste before serving . Makes 4 first-course or 2 to 3 main-course servings . Note : If using fresh green_pepper , roast directly on burner or in broiler , turning often with tongs , until skin blackens . Place in plastic food bag and close bag . Let stand 10 minutes . Use knife to peel pepper . Halve pepper and discard seeds and ribs . Drain any liquid from inside pepper . * For this dish , Zairians generally use the type of smoked fish that requires cooking , such_as smoked haddock or finnan_haddie . Ready-to-eat smoked fish makes this dish quicker and easier to prepare . I like to use smoked whitefish . This recipe was given to me by Mrs . Monzili , the wife of a colonel in the Zairian army . She serves the spinach accompanied by rice , plantains or boiled or steamed potatoes . ZAIRIAN SPINACH WITH SMOKED FISH IN TOMATO_SAUCE 2 ( 10-ounce ) packages fresh spinach leaves 1 ( 28-ounce ) can plum_tomatoes , drained 3 to 4 tablespoons oil 2 large onions , sliced Salt Freshly ground pepper 1 / 2 teaspoon red_pepper flakes , or more to taste 1 / 2 pound smoked whitefish , skinned and boned Hot cooked rice Rinse and stem spinach . Coarsely chop spinach and set_aside . Puree tomatoes in food_processor or blender . Heat oil in large saucepan or Dutch_oven . Add onions and saute over medium heat until golden , 10 minutes . Add pureed tomatoes , salt and pepper to taste and red_pepper flakes . Bring mixture to boil . Reduce heat and cook until thickened , 10 minutes . Add chopped spinach and cook over medium-low heat until tender , about 7 minutes . Flake whitefish in about 1 / 2-inch pieces . Add_to spinach mixture . Heat 1 to 2 minutes over low heat and serve . Makes 3 to 4 main-course servings with rice .</TEXT>
