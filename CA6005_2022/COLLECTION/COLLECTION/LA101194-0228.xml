   <TEXT> President Clinton on Monday ordered an additional 350 U.S. combat aircraft to the Persian_Gulf , despite a pledge from Saddam Hussein to pull_back his troops from Iraq ' s border with Kuwait . Clinton said that he is bolstering U.S. forces in the region because Hussein has repeatedly lied_in the past about his intentions and because the United States does not yet have intelligence supporting the Iraqi leader ' s promise to withdraw his forces . &quot; We ' re interested in facts , not promises -- in deeds , not words , &quot; Clinton said in a six-minute address to the nation Monday evening . &quot; We have not yet seen evidence that Iraq ' s troops are , in fact , pulling back. &quot; Iraq ' s U.N. ambassador announced earlier in the day that Baghdad will begin withdrawing its estimated 80 # 000 soldiers from the Kuwaiti border area rather than face a military confrontation with the United States over concerns about an attack on Kuwait . Iraqi Ambassador Nizar Hamdoun told reporters at the United Nations that he had notified the Security_Council formally that &quot; the instructions have already been issued and the troops are already on the move. &quot; But he declined to answer questions about specifics . Pentagon officials said that the additional aircraft include six long-range B-52 bombers , 12 F-117A Stealth fighter-bombers and 36 F-15E ground-attack jets , which will be sent to air_bases in Kuwait and Saudi_Arabia . Clinton also dispatched 42 A-10 Warthog antitank aircraft , 66 F-16 fighters , 18 F-111F bombers , 54 AH-64 Apache attack helicopters as well as reconnaissance , electronic_surveillance and tanker planes . The latest additions will bring the number of U.S. aircraft in the region -- including Navy warplanes on the aircraft_carrier George_Washington in the Red_Sea -- to 661 , a powerful force by any measure . Military experts said that the B-52s were sent to allow saturation bombing of troops and equipment , while the F-117As and F-15Es would provide added night_vision and bad-weather capability . Administration officials said that Clinton also is weighing the call-up of National_Guard and reserve troops to support the armor and Marine units that are en route to the area . In all , the United States could have more_than 38 # 000 troops in the Persian_Gulf by the end of the week . Administration officials , though relieved by the Iraqi announcement of a pullback , said it was too early to tell whether Iraq actually had begun withdrawing its troops , particularly since it was night in Iraq . One senior official said that there were some indications early in the day that additional forces were moving toward the Kuwaiti border , rather than away from it . &quot; Because of what happened in 1990 , &quot; Clinton said , referring to Hussein ' s lightning attack on Kuwait in August of that year , &quot; this provocation requires a strong response from the United States and the international community . . . . We will not allow Iraq to threaten its neighbors or intimidate the United Nations. &quot; Officials said the Administration probably would insist that Hussein move his forces_back to a &quot; non-threatening &quot; position . But it was not clear whether the United States would set a deadline or provide specifics on what that means . &quot; We are discussing the parameters of their future behavior &quot; and probably will go_to the United Nations to seek limits on aggressive Iraqi troop movements , a senior White_House aide said Monday night . Another Administration official said that U.S. ground troops would stay in the region for some time even if Baghdad withdraws its forces . But he added , &quot; I don ' t believe the President has any desire to keep American forces over there any longer than necessary. &quot; The official said that the President is determined to deter an attack or defend Kuwait and had not yet focused_on what new restraints to try to impose on Hussein . Clinton canceled a political trip to New Jersey to remain in Washington to discuss the Persian_Gulf crisis with his senior national security advisers . White_House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said that Clinton spoke by telephone with six foreign leaders Sunday and Monday about the Iraq situation , and that all were supportive of the U.S. response . He also called former President George_Bush , who led the 1991 war that drove Iraq from Kuwait , to thank him for supporting his actions in the current crisis and to say that Bush ' s pre-positioning of large_numbers of U.S. tanks and artillery in Kuwait was critical to the swift American response . Clinton spoke Sunday evening with Saudi_Arabia ' s King Fahd . On Monday , Clinton spoke with Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin , French President Francois Mitterrand , Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , British Prime_Minister John Major and Turkish Prime_Minister Tansu Ciller . Ciller , who called Clinton , pledged cooperation but did not grant permission to use Turkish airfields to launch U.S. air_raids . Military officials said that U.S. reconnaissance satellites have not picked_up any signs that Iraqi forces actually had begun to withdraw but that no conclusions about this could yet be drawn . One reason is that Iraq ' s internal communications are more primitive than those of the United States and the Iraqi army may_not be as responsive as Western military organizations . &quot; We don ' t even know for_sure yet that they ' re getting the orders , &quot; one official said . The Iraqi announcement effectively put_on hold this sudden crisis , which began in midweek when signs of troops massing near the border alarmed Kuwait and U.S. officials . By the time it turned_around Monday , Baghdad had massed about 80 # 000 troops , many of them fully equipped . But the new turn of events also leaves U.S. strategists with a knotty problem -- what to do if Hussein decides to taunt the United States by withdrawing his forces an inch at a time , forcing Washington to keep its troops in the region for months . Defense_Secretary William J . Perry already has warned that the United States will not permit Iraq to force U.S. troops to &quot; linger &quot; in the Persian_Gulf area . But strategists said that the Pentagon still has not worked_out specifics on how to enforce that warning . Private defense analysts speculated that U.S. forces could prod the Iraqis , if necessary , by bombing a command-and-control center or barracks building or by taking other steps to punish inadequate response . However , military experts said that the United States would have to maintain a credible strike force if it takes such action because Iraq could reverse course again and move_on Kuwait . President Clinton spent the afternoon conferring_with his top national security aides -- Perry , National Security Adviser Anthony Lake and Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff -- but no decisions were announced . Meanwhile , any remaining hope that the Security_Council might ease its economic embargo against Iraq dimmed further as a U.N. commission prepared to recommend that Baghdad be required to meet additional tests on eliminating its weapons of mass destruction . The panel , headed by Swedish diplomat Rolf Ekeus , said that its technicians have essentially completed setting_up a monitoring system that will enable the United Nations to ensure that Iraq does not attempt to rebuild its arsenal and praised Baghdad for helping in the effort . At the same time , however , it suggested that the Security_Council withhold action on lifting the economic embargo until Iraq also has shown definitively that it will cooperate in monitoring and verification efforts . And it did not say how long the test period should be . Times staff writer Stanley Meisler contributed to this article . * KUWAIT NOT CONVINCED : Kuwait wants proof of Iraq ' s professed pullback .
