   <HEADLINE> ENVIRONMENT ; FEWER WHALES POINT TO BIG PROBLEM ON ST . LAWRENCE ; TOXIC CHEMICALS FROM THE GREAT LAKES ARE IMPAIRING THE MAMMALS ' ABILITY TO REPRODUCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The young , one-ton beluga whale broke_away from its herd and glided astern of the research boat , basking in the bubbles of the prop wash . Daniel Lefebvre , braced on the observation deck atop the cabin , lowered his clipboard for a moment and laughed . &quot; Look , beluga Jacuzzi ! &quot; he called_out to the others on the boat . It was just the kind of playful , spontaneous , seemingly affectionate behavior that endears the sleek , ivory belugas to researchers and whale watchers alike here , where the St . Lawrence River meets the Saguenay River and widens toward the Atlantic_Ocean . But these belugas are in_trouble . They are permeated with toxic chemicals washed_down from the Great Lakes . The chemicals appear to have impaired the whales ' ability to reproduce . Large-scale hunting of St . Lawrence belugas ended in the 1950s , and there are no other known predators of the river whales . But in all_the years since , the population has failed to increase , stabilizing at 500 to 700 . A small cadre of marine researchers , led by biologists Pierre Beland and Robert Michaud , is trying to pin_down the cause . So far , the most likely explanation is the toxin levels in the whales . In autopsies of nearly 70 beluga carcasses taken from the St . Lawrence in the last 12 years , Beland has recorded elevated levels of mercury , lead , selenium , PCBs , DDT and other chemicals . Lead concentrations in St . Lawrence belugas , for example , are about 10 times higher than those found in belugas that live_in the Arctic . Beland has found as_many as 700 parts per million of PCBs in St . Lawrence whales , compared to 5 parts per million in Arctic belugas . Beland and Michaud believe that the chemicals have damaged the belugas ' immune_system , slowed reproductive rates and increased infant_mortality . But they cannot yet prove this . &quot; Ask your average person and they ' ll say , ' Yes , if you put toxic chemicals in a whale , it will have an adverse effect on its health , ' &quot; Beland said . &quot; But science doesn ' t operate that way , government doesn ' t operate that way . They need proof. &quot; So the research team , financed on a shoestring and based in this Quebec hamlet , has embarked_on a two-stage approach . Beland , assisted by Sylvain DeGuise and the University of Quebec at Montreal veterinary_school , continues to perform autopsies on St . Lawrence belugas and compare his findings to what is known of healthy belugas in the Arctic . Michaud and the staff of whale researchers in Tadoussac are chronicling beluga behavior and social patterns , trying to find_out how all_the toxins got_into the belugas and exploring other potential causes for the stable population . That takes Michaud , Lefebvre and their volunteer assistants out on the river daily , weather permitting , from May to October . The Tadoussac area is a rich laboratory for whale research , rivaled by few other places in the world . The colliding flows of the St . Lawrence and Saguenay rivers -- which contain salt water close to the ocean -- and the end of an underwater canyon reaching in from the Atlantic combine to make this a profitable feeding ground for seagoing mammals . Blue , fin , humpback and minke_whales are regularly spotted , along with the beluga ; a sperm_whale will occasionally appear . Whale-watching and tourism are principal summer industries , and the whale watch boats mainly cooperate with the scientists . This year , for example , they agreed to stay_away_from belugas so they would not influence the whales ' behavior and interrupt the research . Belugas are among the smallest whales , reaching lengths up_to 16 feet and weights of a ton or more . They are pale gray in youth but turn a bright white as they mature . Their life span is about 30 years . Most belugas live_in Arctic regions , where they are subject_to subsistence hunting by natives and to predatory polar_bears and orcas . Despite such pressures , the Arctic population -- perhaps 100 # 000 in Canadian , Alaskan , Russian and Greenland waters -- is considered stronger than the St . Lawrence colony , declared endangered in 1983 . Only recently , scientists determined that the St . Lawrence belugas live year-round in the Tadoussac area and do not migrate out_to the Atlantic in winter . Scientists associated with Michaud are doing research on blue and fin_whales , as well , seeking to track their migrations and social_structures . But the most promising research is_on the belugas . The team has not yet figured_out the main source of the toxins , in part because the belugas have a wide and varied diet . The latest theory is that eels carrying high toxin levels pass_on the chemicals when they are eaten by the belugas . &quot; The interesting thing about belugas is they present an enlarged picture of what ' s happening with other species , &quot; Michaud said over a beer at a waterfront tavern after a day on the research boat . For example , by checking his findings against what is known about the blue_whale , Beland has determined that belugas carry more toxins than blues . His theory is that the belugas ' higher metabolism , different diet and longer living period in the St . Lawrence all contribute . Surveying their findings so far , Michaud noted that &quot; a stable population in this context is bad news , but at least we ' re not going_down the drain. &quot; Beland , however , is concerned that an unexpected disease could reduce the whale herd beyond the point of regeneration . &quot; If something were to happen here , we could lose hundreds of whales in a_few weeks , and then there would n ' t be a number large enough to maintain the population , &quot; he said . The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is helping to finance the research . Other contributors are the World Wildlife Fund and individual donors through the project ' s &quot; Adopt a Beluga &quot; program . Funding , however , is a continual struggle . &quot; We don ' t have a lot of money , but we have a lot of people who work cheap , &quot; Michaud said with a laugh . Inquisitive and sociable , with turned-up mouths that give them the look of a perpetual smile , belugas have become favorite symbols for Canadian schoolchildren learning about endangered species . This &quot; poster-child &quot; status helps with fund-raising . But in the 12 years Beland has devoted to whale research , he has concluded that there is something more profound and perhaps unknowable in man ' s fascination with whales . &quot; We want to know , what is their world like ? &quot; he said . &quot; For us , the ocean is so cold and dark and mysterious , and whales live there . We hear them breathing , like they ' re gasping for air , and we rarely see all_of them at once . They ' re a mystery. &quot; Now , Beland is looking_to move_on to other research . The beluga project can be finished by others , with perhaps his occasional participation . &quot; After doing so many autopsies , you get sort of depressed , and when you see one of the whales you know on the table , it ' s even worse &quot; he said . &quot; Why can ' t we ( humans ) clean_up our act ? &quot; The Beluga Whale Distribution : Northern Russia , North_America , Greenland Habitat : Mainly coastal ; estuaries and ice_pack Size : 10-16 feet Weight : 1 # 100-3 # 300 lbs .
