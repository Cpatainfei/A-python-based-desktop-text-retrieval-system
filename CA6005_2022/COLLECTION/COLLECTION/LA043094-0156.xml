   <HEADLINE> RABBIS DRAFT GUIDELINES FOR SEX OUTSIDE OF MARRIAGE ; MORALS : PASTORAL LETTER FROM A CONSERVATIVE PANEL IS CALLED THE FIRST MODERN ATTEMPT BY ANY BRANCH OF JUDAISM TO FORMULATE A SEXUAL ETHIC .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For Jewish singles unable to wait until marriage , sex can still be a holy experience if religious moral standards are followed , according to a report on developing a contemporary sexual ethic for the nation ' s largest branch of Judaism . &quot; Committed , loving relationships between mature people who strive to conduct their sexual lives according to the concepts and values described ( in the document ) can embody a measure of holiness , even if not the full portion available in marriage , &quot; says the report , &quot; This Is My Beloved , This Is My Friend. &quot; Marriage is still the &quot; appropriate place &quot; for sexual_relations , but the report released Wednesday encourages Jewish leaders to reconsider whether even homosexual relations can be part of God ' s gift of sexuality if other moral standards are obeyed . The pastoral letter from a commission of Conservative rabbis is called the first modern attempt to draft a sexual ethic by any branch of Judaism . Among its recommendations : Jews have a particular responsibility to avoid AIDS by disclosing their sexual history to their partners , by undergoing HIV testing and by abstaining if either partner is infected . The report from the Rabbinical Assembly ' s Commission on Human Sexuality will be presented Tuesday to the group ' s Committee on Jewish Law and Standards . The law committee , which sets official policy for the assembly , is expected to begin deliberations on the recommendations in the fall . The assembly represents 1 # 500 Conservative rabbis who serve 1.5 million congregational members . The Union of American Hebrew Congregations , representing Reform_Judaism , has approximately 1.3 million members in North_America . An estimated 1 million American Jews are affiliated with Orthodox organizations . Rabbi Gerald L . Zelizer , president of the Rabbinical Assembly , said the report represents the &quot; first time that a major Rabbinic group in the United States has crafted the beginnings of a sexual ethic for the Jewish community. &quot; Zelizer , a rabbi from Metuchen , N.J. , said the committee attempted to apply a kind of moral hierarchy to the many kinds of sexual_relationships today , with marriage as the ideal . Among its traditional teachings , the report not only upholds the importance of marriage , but condemns adultery as a gross violation of Jewish law . The report also condemns casual and promiscuous sex and encourages adherence to the Jewish law forbidding sex during a woman ' s menstrual period . But in recognition of changing sexual practices , the report offers guidelines for sex outside of marriage . The values the commission upholds include avoiding coercive sex and advocating modesty in speech , dress and sexual_activities , honesty about each partner ' s commitment to the other , and fidelity . &quot; When people are not married , these norms are still valid , &quot; said Arnold Goodman , an Atlanta rabbi and the commission ' s chairman . To prevent AIDS , the rabbis urge both partners to disclose their sexual history since the start of the AIDS epidemic in 1980 and to have HIV testing before sex is considered . If one partner is infected , the couple should abstain_from sex , the report said . The commission did not take a definitive stand on homosexuality , but is asking the law committee to examine the tension between the traditional teaching that considers same-sex relations an abomination and Conservative_Judaism ' s commitment to civil_rights for homosexuals . &quot; In our day , when we have many people who are single and others who are openly homosexual , we affirm their values as human_beings and as Jews and earnestly want to involve them in the Conservative Movement , &quot; the report says . &quot; It ' s trying to imbue those relationships with Jewish values where people are doing_it anyway to make those relationships more holy , &quot; Zelizer said .</TEXT>
