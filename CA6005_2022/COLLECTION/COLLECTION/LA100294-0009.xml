   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY : WHAT THEY ' VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO IS . . .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The directors were the stars of two recent Showtime original movie series : &quot; Fallen Angels &quot; and &quot; Rebel Highway. &quot; But with the cable network ' s latest series , &quot; Directed By , &quot; stars are the directors . &quot; Directed By , &quot; which premieres Sunday , showcases short original films directed by accomplished actors Peter Weller ( &quot; RoboCop &quot; ) , Laura Dern ( &quot; Rambling Rose &quot; ) , Danny Glover ( &quot; Lethal Weapon &quot; ) , JoBeth Williams ( &quot; Poltergeist &quot; ) , Kathleen Turner ( &quot; Peggy Sue Got Married &quot; ) and Treat Williams ( &quot; Prince of the City &quot; ) . The showcase is the brainchild of Oscar-winning executive producer Jana Sue Memel , whose Chanticleer Films has produced numerous short films for Showtime as well as the full-length &quot; Lush Life. &quot; &quot; I think actors , out of all_the first-time directors I have worked with , make the best crossover directors because you can surround people with a director of photography , production designers and everybody else who can make them good , &quot; Memel explains . &quot; But ultimately , no one can go_up and talk to the actors other_than the director . And the person who I think talks to an actor best is an actor . I was incredibly knocked_out by all six of the people I worked with. &quot; Memal discussed story ideas with each novice director . But , she adds , &quot; there was a lot of carte_blanche . Treat pitched me a bunch of ideas , but he knew he wanted to do something about flying . Laura co-wrote hers , so she really knew what she wanted to do . Kathleen read this entire collection of Lynn Mamet stories and found one which really resonated within her and so did JoBeth . Danny wanted to do sort of a feminist piece , which is what he definitely did. &quot; Weller received a 1993 Academy Award nomination for best short_subject for his comedic &quot; Partners , &quot; which he adapted with Ebbe Roe Smith from Tom McGuane ' s short_story . Griffin Dunne stars in this freewheeling story about a rising young attorney whose career nearly comes_to a halt when he rekindles a romance with an old flame ( Marg Helgenberger ) , now married to the firm ' s biggest client . Directing has always been a passion for Weller , who majored in it at the University of North Texas . &quot; I just put it on the back burner , &quot; he says , until directors with whom he worked suggested he try directing . &quot; Robert Redford invited me to the Sundance Institute , and I directed at Sundance . Then I dropped some irons into the fire . One of them was at Chanticleer . I took Jana Memel ' s advice and did a comedy . I was going_to do a serious film . I think it was good advice. &quot; &quot; People who have done the heavier dramatic pieces ( for a first film ) have a harder_time advancing in their careers , &quot; Memel explains . &quot; People who have done the comedic pieces , somehow , studios are willing to risk letting someone who has done something funny do something dramatic . It seems they are less willing to risk somebody who has done something dramatic do something funny . They think there ' s a trick to comedy . If you can do that trick , you can do any trick. &quot; Weller relished being the boss on the set . &quot; I put my thumb in everybody ' s pie , &quot; he says , laughing . &quot; that ' s the fun part . I said to the set designer , ' I want all_the offices in primary colors . I want yellow over here , red over here . I want this dining_room blue , because it ' s a sign of control , you know . I want ducks here. ' &quot; Before he began production on &quot; Partners , &quot; he wrote letters to several directors who have been major influences , including Woody Allen , Steven Spielberg , Martin Scorsese and Mike Nichols , informing them he was &quot; going_to rip them off . I literally ripped them off . Woody , he wrote me a great letter back saying , ' Go_ahead , directing is no big deal . It ' s just solving problems. ' Scorsese said something to the effect , ' We have all ripped everybody else off. ' &quot; Though Weller still loves acting -- he has a cameo in &quot; Partners &quot; -- he wants to concentrate_on directing . Early next year he is scheduled to begin production on his first feature , &quot; Incognito , &quot; a thriller about art forgery for Morgan Creek / Warner Bros . Laura Dern opted to do an original story , &quot; The Gift , &quot; which she co-wrote with Emily Tracy , who also penned the screenplay . Mary Steenburgen stars , along with Peter Horton , Isabella Rossellini , Bonnie Bedelia , Mary Kay Place and Dern ' s mother , Diane Ladd . Directing something she co-wrote , Dern says , made the task easier for her . &quot; I was so connected to the story because it ' s something I worked_on with the writer , &quot; she explains . &quot; I really had a lot of answers to the questions in my head of what I imagined it to look_like . The idea is something I feel very strongly about , learning to be connected with each other and help each other through things . I think writing it alone would have been an impossibility. &quot; Before production began , Dern thought dealing with the camera would be the hardest part of directing . &quot; Actually , I had the most fun with it , just learning about it and having great people around me to teach me . I think the most difficult aspect was just physical stamina , you know , just trying to pace myself on very little sleep and really be open_to answering all_the questions , figuring_out what I wanted , trying to never compromise and also being opinionated and saying to people , ' No . This is my idea . I want it this way. ' It ' s kind of rough . I find that a difficult thing as a person. &quot; The actress isn ' t certain actors make the best directors , &quot; but I think those who are great , they ' re probably just wonderfully gifted at directing , anyway . At the same time , I think there ' s an amount of patience that makes_it more fun to work with actor-directors because they understand , having been through it , what doesn ' t feel good and what is not appropriate . I think they ' re kinder on the set. &quot; At least that was her experience being directed by Clint Eastwood last year in &quot; A Perfect World. &quot; &quot; He was really nice to everybody , &quot; she says . &quot; There was a casualness with which he approached everything , which always made me more comfortable. &quot; Dern can ' t wait to try directing again . &quot; I love it , &quot; she says with enthusiasm . &quot; I want to do something completely different . This was a piece about women and behavior and I wanted it to be that because that is what I was interested in . But now I ' d like the opportunity to do something with more camera work , so I can learn more in a more visual area. &quot; As for Treat Williams , his directing opportunity &quot; literally fell_in my lap. &quot; He acknowledges , though , he was not initially courted to direct because , &quot; I wasn ' t a big enough name. &quot; But he harbors no resentment . &quot; that ' s just business , &quot; he says matter-of-factly . &quot; The deal was the name the actor has in Hollywood and , as you know , I ' ve been doing television films . My career has not been slow , I ' m a steadily working actor , but ... &quot; His manager , though , came_up with an idea of Williams directing a film written by David Mamet and pitched it to Showtime . &quot; All of a sudden , it changed , &quot; Williams says . &quot; There was a much more positive attitude . My manager called me and said , ' I got good news and bad news. ' He said , ' You are going_to direct your first film and David Mamet is writing it. ' I said , ' God , what could be the bad news ? ' And he said , ' David Mamet doesn ' t know it yet. ' &quot; So Williams , who has appeared in Mamet plays , called the award-winning writer-director and asked him if he would write a script . &quot; It was very hard for me to do , but I called him and asked if he ' d have the time and energy to write a short film for me. &quot; Williams told Mamet the idea and Mamet agreed to do write &quot; Texan , &quot; a film noir mystery with a twist . &quot; David is an old-school guy , &quot; Williams says . &quot; He ' s a very loyal man , the most loyal man I have ever known , particularly in this business. &quot; Directing &quot; a Mamet &quot; wasn ' t easy . &quot; You ' d think with Mamet , it would direct itself , &quot; Williams says . &quot; But it is very , very tough because it takes much more technical proficiency than a behavioral film where people are naturally overlapping . David ' s writing is meant to sound like natural_language , so you must go_into the editing room and take these technical breaks and try and put them together so they start to have a rhythm . In a way , as a first-time filmmaker , my work in the editing room was very tough because it was so specific rather than a loose , artistic behavioral kind of first film where there are lots of shots of trees and people taking long pauses . I didn ' t have that luxury . &quot; I had rhythms which I knew were in David ' s writing . In the editing room , I would bang my head against the wall saying , ' This doesn ' t sound right . We ' ve got_to go_back in there and keep pulling these pieces out. ' It was sometimes like surgery to get_it to where I felt it had a rhythm that is genuinely what David had intended . To me , that ' s the essence of good directing , to really realize the writer ' s intent. &quot; As a director , Williams says , his purpose was to tell a story well that someone wrote . His favorite directors , he adds , are not &quot; the fancy shooters . I mention William Wyler . When you see his films , they can be any period . You never know who was directing , you just see the novel realized . He ' s my role_model . I really want to be a a guy who is a conduit . You take the material and you walk on the set and your job is to realize you are helping the actors be these people in the story . Once you get the camera put where it is supposed to be , you have done your homework . When you work with the actors , man , it ' s heaven. &quot; &quot; Directed By &quot; premieres Sunday at 10 p.m. on Showtime with David Mamet ' s &quot; Texan , &quot; directed by Treat Williams , followed by JoBeth Williams ' &quot; On Hope &quot; at 10:30 p.m .</TEXT>
