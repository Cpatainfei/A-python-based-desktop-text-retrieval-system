   <TEXT> We so appreciate the article about the County Women ' s Commission study on teen pregnancy and their encouraging recommendation of sexual abstinence education . Of further encouragement was the finding of a federally funded study of an abstinence program called &quot; Sex Respect , &quot; under a grant from Title XX and funded by the Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs , a division of the federal_Department of Health and Human Services . The study again proved that abstinence education does_work . Follow-up studies of 3 # 500 students who took the Sex Respect course and a comparison group showed considerably lower pregnancy rates one and two years after participation as compared to the comparison group . We shouldn ' t be surprised . Kids want to know that not everyone is doing_it . Unfortunately , too many of our youth learn their values from TV sitcoms and have come_to believe that promiscuity is normal and healthy . Glad for the hope that this may change , despite Hollywood . DONNA and EARL BROWN , Santa Paula * We were so pleased to read about the Teen Pregnancy Committee ' s report to the Ventura County supervisors . It was especially encouraging to read that abstinence education is to be promoted . But will it really ? Too often the abstinence message from &quot; safe-sex &quot; professionals is : &quot; Abstinence is best , but teen sex is inevitable : Use a condom. &quot; Not very persuasive , we ' d say . Thankfully there are some excellent programs that actually teach abstinence . &quot; Teen-Aid , &quot; &quot; Choices , &quot; &quot; Reasonable Reasons to Wait &quot; and &quot; Sex Respect &quot; are just a_few that help kids make_good sexual decisions . Elaine Bennett started a curriculum in Washington , D.C. , no less , to help inner-city youth remain abstinent until graduation from high_school . In seven years , only one girl has become pregnant following the &quot; Best_Friends &quot; program . This shows what can be accomplished when children have the right kind of support from their elders and peers . HERB and ANGELA MILLER , Ventura</TEXT>
