   <HEADLINE> AMERICA ' S D-DAY ROLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How dare The Times print such un-American hogwash as that written by Alexander Cockburn , &quot; A Smidgen of Perspective on D-Day &quot; ( Column Left , June 3 ) . It is a sad fact that many Americans with 70-pound packs were dumped in deep water and drowned at Omaha Beach . But this had nothing to do with them carrying cartons of cigarettes . The fact is , many of the coxswains on the landing_crafts lost their nerve and , rather than go onto the beach , which was being sprayed with heavy cross-fire from the German defenders , lowered their ramps more_than 300 yards out_in deep water . For Cockburn to refer to D-day as &quot; a sideshow &quot; and &quot; a skirmish &quot; is a slap in the face to every American who ever wore the uniform of the United States of America , not to mention the hundreds of brave , young_men who lost their lives on the beaches of Normandy 50 years ago . ROBERT L . WEST Calabasas Cockburn ' s sneering references_to the deaths of U.S. soldiers at Omaha Beach are incredibly mean-spirited , and his glowing accolades for the prowess of the Red Army are the pathetic utterances of an apologist for the Soviet_Union ' s amoral conduct prior to its becoming a fervent member of the war against fascism . The Soviet_Union became the victim of Nazi aggression in June , 1941 , which caused it to insistently ask the_British and then the Americans to open a second front , precisely because it had collaborated in Hitler ' s aggression in 1939 . Has Cockburn forgotten the Soviet-German nonaggression pact , under which the same Red Army that later &quot; liberated &quot; Eastern Europe from the Nazis had invaded Poland from the east shortly after the Germans stormed in from the west ? If Stalin had instead joined with Britain and France ( which belatedly but genuinely sought an alliance with him ) , Germany would not have been able to quickly overrun Poland , vanquish France and isolate Britain , leaving Hitler free to pursue his genocidal plans for the inhabitants of Eastern Europe . Hitler cleverly avoided direct provocation of the U.S. and did not declare war against the U.S. until Japan attacked Pearl_Harbor . It was not a foregone_conclusion that the U.S. would follow a &quot; Germany first &quot; approach ; it could have become U.S. policy to let the Nazis and the Soviets destroy each other while Pearl_Harbor and Bataan were avenged . While it may have been Churchill ' s fear of Soviet domination of Europe that finally caused him to agree to the opening of the second front , it should also be remembered that he was so wary of large casualties that he desired to attack through Europe ' s &quot; soft underbelly , &quot; while it was the Americans who insisted upon a head-on attack on Fortress Europe . Furthermore , even if the invasion of France might itself have been insufficient to win the war , it kept enough German divisions tied_down to enable the Red Army to overwhelm the Germans . As late as December , 1944 , Hitler still squandered his troops in the Battle_of_the_Bulge at_the_same_time that the Russians were relentlessly closing on Berlin . STEVEN L . STERN Newport Beach I watched TV and listened to the honored veterans tell the stories of their valiant fight to save Europe from Adolf Hitler ' s tyranny . I , too , am a survivor . Unlike them , I could not fight , for I was in a concentration_camp . The only fight we had was to survive the horrors of Hitler . But to the surviving heroes , I and the free nations thank_you for helping us breathe free . ROSE FUTTER Los Angeles In response to Michael Kinsley ' s apologistic Column Left regarding President Clinton ' s avoidance of military_service in Vietnam ( June 2 ) , the fact remains that many Americans , from the inner-city youth to the rural farmer , the sons and daughters of working-class America , fought and died in that conflict , and , whether too naive or too proud , they did not seek_out exemptions from military_service . For these individuals , Woodstock and protest marches were not a high-water_mark for their generation . A quarter of a century later , a hypothetical justification that the war was &quot; morally wrong &quot; and &quot; the country ultimately decided that Bill_Clinton was right &quot; stated as some type of moral high ground for Bill_Clinton ' s evasion of the draft is fallacy . A reading of names engraved on the Vietnam Memorial reflects the regional and ethnic diversity of Americans who died in that conflict . Having known and served in Vietnam with some of these individuals , I know that their military_service came from a sense_of_duty and a personal code that would not permit another of their generation to stand_in harm ' s way in their stead . It will take more_than rhetorical courage during a D-day speech for Bill_Clinton to show that his avoidance of military_service was more_than self-serving elitism . CHARLES L . TEEVAN Thousand Oaks The main issue is not being addressed -- either by President Clinton or the media . There is no comparison between the Vietnam_War and World_War_II . Clinton was not alone in protesting against the Vietnam_War . But he needs to &quot; stand and deliver &quot; now and stop feeling ashamed of those beliefs , which makes us feel ashamed . I , too , was against U.S. involvement in Vietnam but I have great compassion for those who served there and for those who lost their loved ones . MARJORIE C . SPARKS Palm Springs</TEXT>
