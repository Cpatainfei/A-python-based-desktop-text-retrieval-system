   <HEADLINE> NUCLEAR ARMS ; U.S. HOPES SWISS TALKS WILL BARE N . KOREA ' S INTENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Over the next week in this tranquil Swiss city , the United States will try to find_out , finally , what North_Korean President Kim Il Sung has_in_mind for his fast-moving nuclear_weapons program . Are Kim and his impoverished regime determined to obtain nuclear_weapons , no matter what the cost , as the guarantee of their survival ? Or do they see nuclear_weapons as a bargaining_chip that would ultimately be abandoned for the right price from the United States and its allies ? Those questions have bedeviled the Clinton_Administration for more_than a year , becoming one of the top preoccupations of U.S. foreign_policy . Now , in negotiations with North_Korea here , the Administration hopes to get some answers . The talks open today , with Assistant Secretary_of_State Robert L . Gallucci heading the American team and Deputy Foreign Minister Kang Sok Ju leading the North_Korean delegation . The United States has said it will offer North_Korea a series of diplomatic and economic concessions in exchange for abandonment by Pyongyang of its capability to make nuclear_weapons . &quot; We ' re prepared to talk to them ( the North_Koreans ) about their concerns , &quot; Gallucci said in a mid-Atlantic interview en route to Geneva . At the same time , he went_on , &quot; We ' re interested in getting_to the heart of the nuclear issue. &quot; The talks are of extraordinary significance , not only for the nations of Asia but for the future of efforts to stop the proliferation of nuclear_weapons . U.S. officials fear that if North_Korea succeeds in developing such weapons , neighboring countries -- Japan , South_Korea , Taiwan -- could feel compelled to follow_suit , heightening the risks of destruction in the most economically vibrant region of the globe . And nations outside the region with the potential to acquire nuclear_weapons , such_as Iran and Iraq , could eventually take the path blazed by North_Korea . The talks will take_place under considerable time pressure . In early June , defying the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , North_Korea withdrew spent fuel from its nuclear complex at Yongbyon . The fuel includes plutonium , which could be reprocessed by the end of this year into enough material for five or six nuclear_weapons . That material , in the form of thousands of fuel rods , now sits in pools of water while its intense radioactivity cools_down . The United States held two earlier rounds of talks with North_Korea last summer , which were suspended because North_Korea repeatedly delayed and resisted efforts by the IAEA to carry_out full inspections of Pyongyang ' s nuclear facilities . When North_Korea began removing the fuel rods from the Yongbyon reactor last month , the Administration began talking to its allies and members of the U.N. Security_Council about imposing economic sanctions against Pyongyang . Then the North_Korean president invited former President Jimmy_Carter to Pyongyang and gave assurances that he would freeze his nuclear program during a new round of talks . Few experts believe that the United States and North_Korea will solve all_of the contentious issues dividing them within the next 10 days . Instead , U.S. officials may seek some short-term deal in which North_Korea extends the freeze on nuclear development in exchange for some limited concessions . That would give the two countries time for further confidence-building steps . Still , U.S. officials admit the possibility that North_Korea ' s freeze may be a delaying tactic and that they may find Pyongyang is not willing to negotiate away its nuclear program . In that case , they say , they will soon find themselves again seeking sanctions against North_Korea . The Talks ' Hot Topics These are the main issues likely to be addressed in negotiations between the United States and North_Korea : Nuclear fuel : North_Korea recently removed enough fuel from its nuclear installation at Yongbyon to produce five or six nuclear_weapons . The United States wants to make_sure that this material remains under international safeguards and is not reprocessed to produce weapons-grade plutonium . History of the North_Korean plant : The United States believes that North_Korea diverted nuclear fuel from the Yongbyon plant once before , in 1989 , obtaining enough material for one to two nuclear_weapons . North_Korea has denied doing so , but it has refused to permit international inspectors to carry_out the checks needed to verify what happened in 1989 . The United States wants North_Korea to account_for the history of its nuclear program and to give_up whatever weapons-grade material it produced . Diplomatic recognition : North_Korea is one of the world ' s most isolated states . The Clinton_Administration has said that the United States ( along with other allies , such_as Japan ) is prepared to move toward diplomatic relations with the Pyongyang regime as part of a deal for ending the North_Korean nuclear program . Economic aid : The United States has suggested it would help arrange economic help for North_Korea as part of a settlement of the nuclear issue . One possibility North_Korea mentioned last year would be for the United States and its allies to replace the existing nuclear equipment at the Yongbyon facilities with new light-water nuclear technology , with which it would be much more difficult , if not impossible , for North_Korea to make weapons-grade plutonium . Japan , South_Korea and some European_countries might be asked to help pay_for this new technology . Security : North_Korea would like the United States to provide some form of guarantees of its security . In particular , before giving_up its nuclear program , Pyongyang wants the United States to promise that it would not use nuclear_weapons against North_Korea . Source : Times Staff</TEXT>
