   <TEXT> An amnesty law to bring a peaceful end to Mexico ' s New Year rebellion was overwhelmingly approved by the Senate on Friday . After the vote , a bishop mediating the conflict said Indian rebels have sent the government a new response to the amnesty offer . Samuel Ruiz , bishop of San Cristobal de las Casas in the impoverished southern state of Chiapas , called the amnesty a &quot; very strong step &quot; in ending the rebellion by about 2 # 000 Indians demanding land rights and decent living conditions . The uprising began Jan . 1 . The Senate voted 54-0 , with one abstention , on the amnesty proposed on Jan . 16 by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari . The lower house of Congress , the Chamber of Deputies , approved the measure Thursday without opposition . The law would ensure freedom from prosecution for actions against the government between Jan . 1 and Jan . 20 . But it requires rebels to free their hostages and turn_in their arms . The government ' s chief peace envoy , Manuel Camacho Solis , took further steps Thursday to lure the rebels to talks , announcing that the army would move_out of towns it has occupied in recent days , posting itself on the outskirts .</TEXT>
