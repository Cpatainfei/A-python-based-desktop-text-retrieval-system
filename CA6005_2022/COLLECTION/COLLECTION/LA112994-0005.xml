   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEW ; ' MADONNA ' : A LUDICROUS TALE WITH UNINTENTIONAL LAUGHS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You know just from the title alone that the TV movie &quot; Madonna : Innocence Lost &quot; has got_to be good . If Milton were writing today , really , can anyone doubt this is the story he would tell ? Not that the title is representative of what sort of tragic story arc might ensue in this putrid pre-stardom saga ( &quot; Madonna : The Brunette Years &quot; would ' ve been better ) , or that there ' s any paradise to fall from : Even in flashbacks , the fictionalized M . Ciccione is already a ruthlessly ambitious , boy-hungry brat without an innocent impulse in her noggin . But oh , there are laughs . The movie Madonna ' s voice-over narration ( written by Michael Murray , who penned one of the Menendez brothers pictures ) gets a rollicking start with transitional gems like : &quot; When I finally lost my virginity , I considered it a career move . My first one . There ' d be many_more . Starting with New York . . . &quot; The psychology here is as swift as the exposition . Near the end , as Madonna walks_out on her longtime manager -- just as she has walked_out on every lover and / or steppingstone in her career -- said manager angrily blurts out the sad subtext , apropos of nothing : &quot; Did this all start_up when your mother died ? Were you just so beat_up that you decided to stop feeling anything ? YOU ' RE STILL UNDER CONTRACT ! &quot; Of course , in a narrative that covers only the years just prior to Madonna ' s superstardom , there ' s a lot of facts-fudging to suffer between the odd moments that a line like &quot; This bellybutton is gonna make us a fortune ! &quot; pops_up to make_it all worthwhile . Comedy fans can pass the slack times by debating whether relative newcomer Terumi Matthews , least to blame here , looks and acts materially enough like Madonna for the job . By consensus , the gum-snapping mouth and doe eyes have it -- although a script mostly devoid_of intentional humor ( and deadly when it strains for wit ) doesn ' t exactly realistically serve the real Madonna ' s sarcasm . Madonna is probably thanking her lucky star this tell-little tell-all turned_out so ludicrous . Director Bradford May ( of &quot; Amy Fisher : My Story &quot; fame ) appears not to have had a clue , though you have to treasure a movie that has as its climactic epiphany the unsealing of a bottle of peroxide . * &quot; Madonna : Innocence Lost &quot; airs at 8 tonight on Fox ( Channels 11 and 6 ) .</TEXT>
