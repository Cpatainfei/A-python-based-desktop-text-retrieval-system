   <HEADLINE> THE CRIME GAME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s about time someone exploded the crime statistics myth as Katherine Dunn did_in &quot; Crime and Embellishment &quot; ( April 10 ) . During my tenure as a staff_member of the Criminal Justice Committee in the state Assembly during the early ' 80s , politicians were also attempting to inflate crime numbers for partisan advantage . This was in the face of experts testifying that the only reliable crime statistic was the homicide rate -- because you could actually count the bodies . The fact is that the reporting system for these statistics is so flaky that any group can &quot; prove &quot; just about any point that serves its interests . ROSS S . CLARK Twin Peaks Dunn is trying to open our eyes to something we just don ' t want to see . Tell your representatives in Congress that you want a study done on Surgeon_General Joycelyn Elders ' bold yet practical suggestion that drugs be legalized as a first_step in regaining safety in our communities . Pull the plug on the profits , and you will see the scum who allow innocent people ' s blood to be spilled in the name of greed go_down the drain . G . FRED LOGAN Laguna Niguel In a society where many are crying &quot; Wolf ! &quot; Dunn ' s piece was a calming influence . Crime is not mounting ; we Angelenos are not under a state of siege . Los Angeles is truly one of the best cities in the world . YONI J . STONE Los Angeles Thank_you for printing &quot; Crime and Embellishment. &quot; It ' s time that the voice of reason was heard on this subject . I have lived_in Koreatown for 10 years now , and 20 years before that in Manhattan , on the Upper West_Side , which Time magazine once described as a &quot; high-crime interracial neighborhood , &quot; and I never had reason to think my neighbors were dangerous . On the contrary , I , like Dunn , am amazed that the majority of Americans , in spite of their crowded , frustrating city lives , do not kill each other . I remember a professor in college who reminded us that &quot; crime statistics &quot; always go_up at budget time , and Dunn ' s research supports that . Fear of each other is an easy way for government to make spies of us all . MARIAN C . DUFFETT Los Angeles Dunn ' s article makes one wonder what never-never_land she inhabits . Surely it ' s not the world where drugs are pushed openly in schoolyards and on residential streets . Surely it ' s not where cars are stolen and homes burglarized . The world my friends and I live_in is a place where one does not venture out after dark and where one learns to be wary of strangers . I , too , have learned that &quot; statistics &quot; lend themselves to be bent to meet one ' s need . IRENE C . OSBURN Los Angeles Even one person victimized by a crime in this city is one person too many for humanity to acquiesce to . SANDRA ROCHOWANSKY Reseda I have worked in the field of adolescent care_for the past 25 years . When I first started , kids who came_to placement facilities were sent because they took hubcaps and the occasional car . Let me now describe the kind of student that we deal with today . They have been abandoned , abused and sexually molested . Unlike the children of decades ago , they do not fight with their fists . They fight with automatic weapons . I do not believe the research done_by Victor E . Kappeler , Gary W . Potter and Mark Blumberg for &quot; The Mythology of Crime and Criminal Justice &quot; that was cited in Dunn ' s piece . I believe what I see . What I see are more and more angry , sociopathic kids who will do anything . The research may show that there is no formidable increase in violent crime , but does_it take_into_account the random nature of these acts ? ROBERT REILLY Long_Beach</TEXT>
