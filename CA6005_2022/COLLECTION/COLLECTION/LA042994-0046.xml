   <TEXT> * I am not a homeless_person , but I see them on the streets all_the time . How can we pose as champions of human_rights when we let homelessness exist and nothing is done to attack the problem ? Is there any greater infraction of human_rights than for the government to refuse to touch this problem ? Even the countries we criticize , like China , are better in this respect . The country will pay_for this in children who are brought_up on the streets . It may pay in epidemics that get started in miserable human conditions . It is another plague that needs to be addressed at the federal level . SAMUEL L . FRIEDMAN Los Angeles</TEXT>
