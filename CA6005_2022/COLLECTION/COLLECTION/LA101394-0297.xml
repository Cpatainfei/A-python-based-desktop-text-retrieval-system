   <HEADLINE> MILLER GETS NOD ; CHANDLER SAYS HE ' S SURPRISED ; ANALYSIS : IT ' S NO SECRET THAT KNOX HAS HIGH REGARD FOR BACKUP . THE GAP BETWEEN THE TWO RAM QUARTERBACKS HAS ALL BUT DISAPPEARED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chris Miller was named the Rams ' starting quarterback Wednesday , and Chuck Knox said there was never any doubt . On Tuesday , however , Knox said he would wait until Wednesday , review medical updates and then make his decision . What decision ? Miller was healthy , and coming_off a solid performance against the Green_Bay Packers . After listing Chris Chandler as questionable on Wednesday because of a sore ankle , Knox summoned Miller to his office and informed him he would be the starting quarterback for Sunday ' s game against the Giants . Did Knox call Jerome Bettis to his office ? Robert Young ? Flipper Anderson ? If Miller is the team ' s acknowledged No . 1 quarterback , why did Knox meet separately with Miller and Chandler Wednesday ? Why is there a feeling at Rams Park that Miller is_on a short leash , and one slip-up and Chandler ' s in command ? Why did Chandler report to work Wednesday believing he was going_to be named the starter ? &quot; How could there be any question ? &quot; Knox said . &quot; Chris Miller is the starting quarterback , he was the starting quarterback , he got hurt . He ' s back to being the starting quarterback . OK ? &quot; I ' m not going_to get_into short leashes , long leashes , next week , the end of the year and all that type of stuff that you people want so you can put somebody in a trick bag . that ' s not what I ' m talking_about . He is the starting quarterback . I can ' t make_it any more emphatic than that. &quot; It ' s no secret , however , that Knox has high regard for Chandler and that he has become irritated with Miller ' s penchant for making excuses when things do not go well . It has been mentioned by several of his assistants and it has been discussed in the team ' s front office . &quot; I have never said that I favored one quarterback over the other , &quot; Knox said . &quot; That is not known , because I have never said it . You can hear that from this person or that person , but you never heard it from me . So you ' re asking me now , and I ' m telling : Yes , I have said we can win with Chris Chandler because I feel we can . I said that when Chris Miller was out and was not going_to be playing . Just like we can win with Chris Miller , and Chris Miller played well , and he is the starter . &quot; I ' m not dealing in perceptions . I ' m talking with reality , and I ' ve just answered the questions. &quot; The Rams gave Miller $ 9 million over three years to replace Jim Everett , and then gave Chandler a one-year contract for $ 600 # 000 to be his backup . There should be no debate , but after six games the gap between starter and backup has all but disappeared . &quot; When I came_in today I anticipated I was going_to be the starter this week , &quot; said Chandler , who led the Rams to a 16-0 victory over Kansas City . &quot; But I understand Chuck ' s thought that he would like to see it in practice first , that I can go_on the ankle . I just know the ankle feels_like it ' s going_to be ready to go. &quot; If 100 % healthy , would Knox have anointed Chandler , who has completed 58.7 % of his passes with two touchdowns and no interceptions , his starter ? Knox doesn ' t answer hypothetical questions , but it appears Miller ' s stock has plummeted for a variety of reasons : Miller has completed 50 % of his passes with four touchdowns and five interceptions ; he has shown an inability to stay healthy ; and when asked questions , he has elected to answer honestly rather than respond with cliches . &quot; He ' s pretty good when he ' s healthy , &quot; said Mike Martz , Ram quarterbacks coach . &quot; I don ' t think he ' s ever been himself since the first week of camp . I know he hasn ' t . Some unfortunate things have happened to him ; he ' s just kind of an unlucky guy. &quot; Miller injured an abdominal muscle early in training camp and his play deteriorated . He injured his ribs in the regular-season opener against Arizona , and after receiving pain-killing injections to continue playing , he injured his shoulder against San Francisco . He returned to start against Green_Bay after missing the second game with Atlanta , and compared to Packer quarterback Brett Favre , Miller appeared much sharper , even with a strong wind in his face at times . &quot; There ' s a big difference now in the way he ' s throwing the ball , &quot; Martz said . &quot; He ' s getting_it back . &quot; We ' re very fortunate to have both of them ( Miller and Chandler ) . The other guy is a legitimate starter in this league. &quot; After the loss in Atlanta , Miller said he had difficulty gripping the ball because it was wet , the result of center Bern Brostek ' s pants being wet from sweat . Asked about his rib injuries , Miller reluctantly admitted to playing with pain . When the story was published there were some Ram coaches who became upset , believing Miller had made_it known he was hurt to gain sympathy and explain why he was playing poorly . After last week ' s loss to Green_Bay , Miller was asked what happened on the pass he had thrown to Flipper Anderson in the end zone . Miller said the receiver had run the wrong route , thereby allowing the defender to intercept the pass . A day later , he challenged the offensive play calling_in the second_half against Green_Bay ; a similar act by Everett a year ago drew a strong reprimand . &quot; Those are facts ; they ' re not excuses , &quot; Miller said . &quot; I ' m not pointing fingers at anybody . I ' ll take the heat , but if I think someone is going_to be running a route that we have called , and I ' m going_to throw it , I ' m expecting them to be there. &quot; Miller flashed leadership skills in training camp and took_control of the offense , but then he was hurt and began standing to the side while others stepped into the huddle . The present uncertainty surrounding the quarterback position and Miller ' s inability to avoid injuries has left the offense leaderless in the early going . &quot; I felt I played well Sunday and now I ' m planning on playing well and putting all that other stuff behind us , &quot; Miller said . &quot; I expect to pick this team_up and help win the next two games and be where we want to be at the bye with an opportunity to do some good things during the second_half of the season . &quot; A lot of people are searching right now ; that happens when a team goes 2-4 . Mentally it ' s been hard on me just because I haven ' t been 100 % physically and that ' s showed in my play . And then when you ' re not on the field how can you be a leader ? I ' m back now , and that ' s what I plan on doing. &quot;</TEXT>
