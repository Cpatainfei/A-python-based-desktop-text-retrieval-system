   <HEADLINE> SURFING / ROCKIN ' FIG &amp; DAVE : COMPETITION GETS GNARLIER IN ' 94</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So Fig , before we talk_about the new competitive year for the U.S. Bud Surf Tour , where were you during Monday ' s quake ? Standing_in the doorway with both kids under my arms . I was feeling it and wondering when it was going_to stop . We live_in a three-story building , and I was hoping we weren ' t going_to get the pancake effect . Any damage at the surf shop ? Ah , a_few used surfboards got rattled out_of_place and some trophies I kept_on a glass counter were displaced , but no major damage . Now that we ' re moving back to the topic at_hand , what ' s new for the ' 94 tour ? Well , we had 10 events last year , and we have 12 events this year . Even though we ' re in a recession , things are looking_up . I hear the tour added two competitions in Hawaii and one in Puerto Rico , but the latter was dropped . It looks_like Ian Cairns , the tour ' s competition director , has been busy . Yup , that means the tour has more travel money , but that also means fiercer competition in the water . According to the tour ' s ' 94 schedule , the first contest is in the chilly waters off Santa Cruz on Feb . 9 . Fig , you announced last year ' s tour ; how was Santa Cruz ? It ' s sponsored by Billabong of Australia . Since it ' s smack in the middle of winter , Steamer Lane can be going_off big_time . Last year , it was very windy , with some 40-knot onshore winds . But the final days were just perfect , with sunny skies and good surf , four- to six-foot . I remember it rained so bad the first few days that I was announcing with ( former pro surfer Wayne ) &quot; Rabbit &quot; Bartholomew in the cab of a truck . I had my PA_system in the truck , the windshield_wipers on and a football playoff_game on the radio . I was giving updates on the game during the contest . Who are some surfers we should watch for in ' 94 ? Rob Machado of Cardiff is the returning champion , although he ' ll surf on the world tour this year and I don ' t know how many Bud Surf tour events he ' ll enter . But you also have Mister Speed and Power , Taylor Knox of Carlsbad ; Chris Brown of Santa Barbara and a lot of younger , up-and-coming guys such_as Adam Replogle of Santa Cruz . For spectators eager to view a pro contest , after Santa Cruz the tour will visit Seaside in North San Diego County , March 2-6 , Pismo Beach , April 20-24 ; Huntington Beach , May 11-15 ; Oceanside , June 8-12 ; Ala Moana , Hawaii , June 21-26 ; Malibu , July 6-10 ; Lower Trestles , Sept . 12-18 ; San Francisco , Oct . 5-9 , and Makaha , Hawaii , for the tour ' s championships , Oct . 24-29 . On Aug . 25 through 28 , the tour visits Virginia Beach , Va. , for the East Coast Surfing Championships . Also , a contest will be held_in California July 6-10 at a site to be announced later . * Surfari : Jim Hogan , National Scholastic Surfing Assn . coach , recently returned with a group of young Orange County surfers who visited Morocco , on Africa ' s northwestern coast . Sponsored in part by Bruce Hopping of Laguna Beach and the Kalos Kagathos Foundation , the group had consistent six-foot and bigger surf . Best part of the trip , said Rick Fish , 16 , of Newport Beach , was big , though stormy , surf conditions . Worst part was the congested Marrakesh marketplace and exotic cuisine , which included &quot; hideous &quot; beef and sheep guts . &quot; It was pretty nasty , &quot; Fish said . Forecast : The swell ' s dropping , but a new storm off Siberia can give us a new northwest swell by early next week if it holds together , says Surfline / Wavetrak .</TEXT>
