   <HEADLINE> BOSNIAN SERB GUNMEN KILL AID WORKER ; BALKANS : LOCAL U.N. COMMANDER ASKS FOR NATO AIR STRIKE IN RESPONSE . BUT HIS REQUEST IS DENIED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bosnian Serb gunmen killed a humanitarian aid worker in an attack on a U.N. convoy Tuesday , provoking a plea for NATO air strikes that was denied by the rebel-encircled U.N. command here . The fatal attack on the convoy near the U.N.-declared &quot; safe area &quot; of Gorazde was the second blatant affront to the troubled Bosnian peacekeeping mission in as_many days and appeared to be an attempt by Serbian forces to test the limits of the world ' s seeming indifference to the 30-month-old Bosnian war . Serbian gunmen had hijacked five truckloads of medical supplies in the presence of French peacekeepers a day earlier and refused demands lodged at the highest levels for return of the stolen goods . After Serbian forces fired on the food convoy leaving Gorazde on Tuesday , killing the Bosnian driver of one truck , the_British commander of U.N. forces in the eastern Bosnian town appealed_to the U.N. hierarchy based in Zagreb , Croatia , for a display of air_power to punish the attackers , mission spokesman Paul Risley said . But Maj . Koos Sol , a U.N. military spokesman at the forward command center here in the Bosnian capital , said British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose and the Zagreb-based mission commander , French Gen . Bertrand de Lapresle , decided against any use of force . &quot; It was decided during discussions that this would not be useful , &quot; said Sol , who described the situation at the attack scene in Gorazde as &quot; stable. &quot; According to other sources at the command center here , Rose worked_out a deal with Bosnian Serb warlord Gen . Ratko Mladic that would avert any show of NATO force in exchange for letting the United Nations retrieve what remained of the marooned convoy . Three truckloads of food and seeds , as well as two British armored vehicles that had been providing protective escort , were recovered , along with the two uninjured drivers , said a spokesman for the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees here . While Mladic appeared to have allowed the evacuation near Gorazde to proceed , his promise late Monday to return the stolen medical cargo reportedly remained unfulfilled Tuesday night . The rebel attack near Gorazde occurred just outside a 12-mile weapons-exclusion zone proclaimed in April after a Serbian rampage conquered nearly half of the U.N. haven , killing hundreds of civilians and forcing more_than 25 # 000 Muslims from their homes . Despite the incident ' s occurring outside the zone , however , any attack on U.N. peacekeeping forces is grounds for calling_in air_power . &quot; They ' re seeing what they can get_away with , &quot; protested an angry aid official . Referring to the medical supply theft , during which French soldiers at the Sarajevo checkpoint stood idly by , the official said the U.N. Protection Force &quot; should have stood_up to them . They should have locked the drivers in the armored vehicle ( for protection ) and called_in reinforcements. &quot;</TEXT>
