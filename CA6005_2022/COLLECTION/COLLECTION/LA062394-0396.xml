   <HEADLINE> CAPITOL JOURNAL : FAMILY TIES BIND ON DEATH_PENALTY ISSUE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a teen-ager , Kathleen Brown would wait for her father to go_to_bed , then sneak down the spiral staircase of the old Governor ' s Mansion and read his thick black briefing book on the latest death_penalty case . She ' d stare at grisly photographs of the victim , the crime scene and the killer on Death Row . She ' d read the horrifying details and the letters from families -- from the victim ' s demanding retribution and from the condemned ' s pleading for mercy . &quot; I will never forget those death_penalty days , &quot; she told reporters Tuesday , standing solemnly in the living room where her father , Edmund G . ( Pat ) Brown , had agonized over life or death decisions from a mustard-colored chair . She could tell when another execution was approaching because she ' d arrive home from school to find chanting demonstrators in her path . One evening , as she walked up the back steps with her father , an elderly woman in tears grabbed the governor and begged him to spare her son . She vividly recalls attending the opening ceremonies of the 1960 Winter_Olympics at Squaw Valley as a 14-year-old , how joy suddenly turned_to fright when thunderous boos greeted the introduction of her mother . Bernice Brown was there representing her husband , who had just stayed the execution of &quot; Red_Light Bandit &quot; Caryl Chessman . In all , her father sent 36 people to the gas_chamber and granted clemency to 23 others , a record . He tried twice to abolish the death_penalty . The issue severely damaged his political career . It left him vulnerable to attacks from Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan . &quot; Even in the face of all_of that , &quot; his daughter reminded , &quot; he stood_firm in his personal opposition . It was a value passed_on to me that was so strong and powerful , I could no more contemplate being politically correct on this issue than contemplate disavowing my family . . . &quot; I oppose it because my father taught me it was wrong and the religious experiences I had reinforced that. &quot; * For an hour , the Democratic gubernatorial nominee bared her soul . She revealed details of her formative years and offered insights into her Catholic faith . But she never could explain to reporters specifically what it was her father taught was wrong about the death_penalty -- or how it violated her religious_beliefs . And my conclusion was that Brown ' s opposition to capital_punishment is rooted primarily -- if not totally -- in deep devotion and intense loyalty to her father , now 89 and ailing . Pat Brown opposed the death_penalty on the grounds that it did not deter murderers , it clogged the courts and was enforced unfairly . But &quot; those are not my reasons , &quot; his daughter said . &quot; It ' s been very hard for me to talk_about because there is no neat and tidy way . . . I can ' t give you a black_and_white answer . . . It is a gut thing. &quot; She said her father ' s advice on the issue was to &quot; follow the gut. &quot; As for deterrence and &quot; all_the other arguments , &quot; she said , &quot; I can argue those either way . . . It ' s a deterrent to the person who is executed. &quot; Is she troubled by the state ' s taking of a life ? &quot; No . . . I am not speaking as a theologian . . . &quot; I am speaking about values that suffused my upbringing . They were in part Catholic . And they were very much values that I learned from my family and particularly , in a very personal way with_respect_to the death_penalty , from my father . . . In fact , the church itself is divided. &quot; She opposes capital_punishment , Kathleen Brown indicated , because to support it would be tantamount_to repudiating her father . * Last December , I asked Brown why she opposed the death_penalty and her reply was &quot; that ' s irrelevant &quot; because she would enforce it . After finally hearing her answer , I ' m inclined to agree . At times , she sounded like a death_penalty supporter . She has always understood -- partly because of those old briefing books -- why the public demands capital_punishment , she said . &quot; I would feel the same way if anyone harmed my children or my grandchildren. &quot; As a crime-fighting tool , the death_penalty itself is virtually irrelevant . There have been only two executions in Gov . Pete Wilson ' s term , none in George Deukmejian ' s two terms . There are 383 murderers stacked on Death Row . Any blame rests with the federal appeals system and has nothing to do with Sacramento . It would be refreshing if the gubernatorial campaign were fought over some legitimately important issues -- how to combat gangs , create jobs and improve schools . But the death_penalty is a comforting symbol for too many voters . It is Brown ' s position , rather than answers , that leaves her vulnerable to Wilson . And he ' ll hound her -- as Nixon and Reagan did her father .</TEXT>
