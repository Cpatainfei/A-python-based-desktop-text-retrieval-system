   <HEADLINE> WONDERS OF VITAMIN_A BEING UNCOVERED ; SCIENCE : INEXPENSIVE CHEMICAL WORKS AGAINST INFANT_MORTALITY , BLINDNESS AND MEASLES . LABORATORIES FIND GENETIC AND CELLULAR FUNCTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There are very few wonder_drugs in the world , but Vitamin_A may be one of them . This dirt-cheap chemical can lower childhood mortality by about one-third in vast parts of the developing world . It prevents keratomalacia , one of the five leading causes of blindness . It ' s the closest thing to a specific treatment for measles . It ' s a fairly good therapy for some types of anemia . It may reduce the transmission of the AIDS virus from mother to fetus . It ' s quite safe , it ' s easy to store and one dose -- good for four months -- costs about 2 cents . And that ' s just the practical side of the story . Information about Vitamin_A ' s role in the physiology of cells is pouring_out of laboratories . Whole new functions are being uncovered . Vitamin_A regulates hundreds of genes . It is a key modulator of the immune_system . It helps aim cells along the tricky trajectory from primitive to adult forms , a job that may play some role in preventing the development of cancer . Overall , Vitamin_A is emerging as evolution ' s equivalent_to the_Swiss Army knife . The substance ' s ability to fight infections in malnourished people is its most astounding property . First suggested more_than 60 years ago , and proved only in the past decade , the significance of this finding is just beginning to become clear . &quot; It is one of the most important breakthroughs in public health in the last 50 years , &quot; the retired director general of the Pan American Health Organization , Abraham Horwitz , said recently . Vitamins are substances that are essential to life but cannot be made from scratch by the organism that needs them . ( Many substances actually fit this definition , including some amino_acids that form the building_blocks of proteins . The difference is that , unlike amino_acids , vitamins are required only in tiny amounts . They act more as catalysts for biochemical reactions than as raw_materials for biological construction. ) Vitamin_A -- unlike Vitamin_C and the B_vitamins -- is &quot; fat-soluble &quot; and can be stored in body tissue for prolonged periods . This raises the risk of toxic effects , but offers one particular advantage . Intermittent doses , acquired either through diet or pharmacological supplements , can tide an organism over many fallow months . In many diets , Vitamin_A deficiency is never a threat . Nevertheless , dietary sources seem to be insufficient in many parts of the world . Marginal intake is worsened by frequent infection , which depletes the body ' s Vitamin_A stores . Butter , egg_yolk and liver contain large amounts of Vitamin_A . Equally important sources are yellow and orange fruits and vegetables ( such_as squash , sweet_potatoes and papayas ) , and dark-green , leafy_vegetables . They contain large amounts of beta-carotene , a compound split by the body into two molecules of retinyl palmitate , Vitamin_A . The latter gives_rise to a family of derivatives known as &quot; retinoids. &quot; Since its discovery in 1913 , Vitamin_A has been regarded mostly as the vitamin of vision . A compound called retinal is essential for making the light-sensing biochemicals in the retina , or back wall , of the eye . Vitamin_A deficiency shows itself , early on , as night_blindness . Curiously , the vitamin ' s more medically important role in vision involves a different part of the eye . Severe deficiency causes the cornea -- the clear cover of the eye ' s front -- to melt away , leaving_behind opaque scar tissue and permanent blindness . Vitamin_A ' s anti-infective uses were discovered -- or , to be precise , rediscovered -- in the early 1980s by Alfred Sommer , an epidemiologist working in Indonesia who is now dean of the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health . Vitamin_A deficiency -- at least as measured by subtle changes in the appearance of the eye -- occurred inconsistently in Javan villages . Some children showed signs of it while their neighbors showed none . Sommer and his colleagues sought reasons for these differences in the diets and frequency of illnesses ( such_as diarrhea ) in a group of 4 # 000 preschoolers . The researchers observed the children for several years and noticed something they had not expected to see . There was a clear relationship between Vitamin_A deficiency and mortality . Moreover , there appeared to be a &quot; dose-response &quot; relationship : The more advanced the eye problems , the higher the death rate . ( Children with severe eye changes were removed from the study and immediately given Vitamin_A . None went blind. ) The team already had plans to conduct a study of 26 # 000 Sumatran children , half of whom would be given Vitamin_A supplements and half of whom would not . Besides looking_for eye changes in both groups , they quickly added illness and mortality as &quot; endpoints &quot; they also would measure . At the end of a year , mortality in the Vitamin_A group was 34 % lower than in the control group . A simultaneous study that the Sommer team ran_on Vitamin_A supplementation in children hospitalized with severe measles showed even more dramatic results : a drop of 50 % in deaths from the disease . The studies appeared in 1986 and 1987 in The Lancet and the_British Medical Journal . As it happens , the latter journal in 1932 had published a study showing that death rates from measles could be cut by 58 % if ill children were given cod-liver_oil , which is high in Vitamin_A . The place where this research was done ? A hospital in London . &quot; As best as one can tell , nothing else appeared on the subject , &quot; Sommer said of that experiment . &quot; It did not change clinical practice . Some things people are willing and ready to accept , and some things they aren ' t , even with the evidence. &quot; Vitamin_A ' s importance in other infections is emerging . A paper published last year reported increased mortality ( and greater immune depression ) among HIV-positive drug_users in Baltimore who were mildly deficient in Vitamin_A . One published in June showed that pregnant , HIV-infected women in Malawi transmitted the virus to their babies 32 % of the time if they were severely Vitamin_A deficient , but only 7 % of the time if they had sufficient stores of the vitamin . There is little data to suggest Vitamin_A supplements are helpful in people who are not deficient . Excessive doses , in fact , can be toxic , and occasionally fatal . Nevertheless , the World_Health_Organization estimates there are about 250 million children who are not getting as much Vitamin_A as they need . A major effort is under way to right this .</TEXT>
