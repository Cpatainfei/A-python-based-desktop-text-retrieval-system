   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON CRIME IN L.A. ; FACE IT : EVERY ONE OF US IS AT RISK ; DAVID FALCONER ' S MURDER STRIPS THE ILLUSION FROM STATISTICS ; THE WHOLE CITY IS BECOMING ONE LEVEL , BLOODY PLAYING FIELD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The hold-up murder of choirmaster David John Falconer last week outside a Los Feliz convenience_store brings Los Angeles to a new level of consciousness in the current crisis of violent crime in this beleaguered city . Just as the Northridge earthquake affected everyone equally , regardless of color , occupation , income or address , these days , every one of us in Los Angeles is equally liable to being cut_down by murderous strangers . I know the riposte : Why , you ask , should the murder of one white_man -- a choirmaster with a doctorate in music from USC , a beloved teacher , a gentle , caring soul -- be considered any worse than the gunning_down each weekend of a dozen less-privileged Angelenos , the majority of them people_of_color ? Precisely ! The murder of anyone , the brutal termination of a human life , is equally heinous . But have we not , in considering the statistics of who is murdered , and where , concealed the universal implications of this crime_wave ? We say : Most people killed in Los Angeles are people_of_color . In saying this , we delude ourselves that random murder is an ethnic affair . In and behind such grasping at statistical illusions is an implied argument , perhaps even a desperate hope . If murder is a matter of ethnic identity , then in Los Angeles , the most de_facto segregated city in the nation , being at risk is a matter of residence and choice : Avoid certain neighborhoods , certain kinds of people , and you significantly decrease your chances of being a murder victim . The statistical comfort of living in one part of the city or another , or of merely being in one part of the city or another , has now , in the slaying of David Falconer , forced an acknowledgment of a reality about which Angelenos prefer not to talk : our universal vulnerability . Soon , very soon , it will not matter who you are , or what your color is , or where you live . The very fact that you are in Los Angeles will overwhelm all other statistical odds as the playing_field , the killing ground , becomes increasingly level . Gangbanger or choirmaster , you will be equal before the terror . It was debilitating for us to see crime as something happening in someone else ' s neighborhood . Now we face an equally debilitating notion in our impending acknowledgment of universal vulnerability . If crime in Los Angeles is one vast Lotto game with everyone given an equally empowered number , then we will begin to play the odds against each other . We will look_across the table at dinner_parties , we will look_to the next desk at our office , we will glance out of the corner of our eye at the person sitting next to us in the movie_theater , and we will ask : Who ' s next ? You ? Me ? The guy across the room ? Each Angeleno will regard the other ' s vulnerability as a way of lowering one ' s own statistical probabilities for being a murder victim . This will result in a social and psychological solipsism -- a defensive self-centeredness based on the most fundamental motivation of all , fear in the face of a threat to survival -- that will do great damage to the moral and civic fabric of Los Angeles . Even with this new insight , Angelenos might be tempted to comfort themselves with another statistical delusion . The odds , they will argue , still rest mostly on ethnic identity and place . True , as far as statistics go . But apart from the enclaves of the very rich , Los Angeles is a patchwork of neighborhoods where the borders between &quot; safe &quot; and &quot; dangerous &quot; are increasingly blurred , where old-timers and strangers pass one another on every street , in every convenience_store . David Falconer lived_in Silver Lake and was killed in Los Feliz . Los Feliz is one of the most civic-minded , preservationist-oriented districts in the city . Silver Lake , despite marginal aspects , is attractive enough to be the home of former City Councilman Mike Woo . Shall these neighborhoods now be ranked alongside South-Central in the category of danger ? The answer , unfortunately , is yes . In an era of universal vulnerability , with highly mobile robber-killers plying their trade wherever they choose , no neighborhood is safe . Nor is being middle-class any longer an adequate shield . Statistics tell us that death by violence is a matter of poverty -- another statistical illusion of safety . But Falconer was solidly middle-class , doing a middle-class thing : buying a snack on his way home from a productively middle-class day teaching music . What does_it do to a city when being middle-class offers no protection ? ( We already know what it means to a city when being poor implies a high certainty of violent death. ) And is not evidence gathering that the upper-middle classes are sharing the vulnerability of their middle-class brethren ? Only the wealthy , surrounded by private security , can , temporarily , escape the odds . And how long will that last ? The children of St . James Episcopal School on Wilshire where Falconer taught are devastated . One 10-year-old told her mother that she cried until the tears no longer came . She was weeping for all_of us . Better to weep as a prelude to action than to succumb to this crime epidemic . Better to weep , and perhaps even to grow angry , than to play the odds against each other .</TEXT>
