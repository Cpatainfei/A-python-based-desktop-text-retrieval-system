   <HEADLINE> FASHION / INSIDE OUT : PLAYBOY ' S BUNNIES HOPPING FOR MAKEOVER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> These days drag queens are pretty much the only ones willing -- no , thrilled -- to wear the classic Playboy bunny costume and act like they mean it . So party_girl Susanne Bartsch , famous for masterminding AIDS benefits in New York and Paris , has signed_up a bevy of high-profile style purveyors to overhaul Playboy ' s outdated icon . The results will be unveiled at &quot; The Hoppening , &quot; a $ 250-a-ticket benefit Sept . 17 at the Playboy Mansion . &quot; Richard Tyler ? Yes , I spoke_to Richard . Yes , he ' s going_to do_it , &quot; said Bartsch , who moved among the crowd at Tuesday night ' s kick-off party on the lawn of the Chateau Marmont hotel , exhorting people to sell $ 975 ads in the program for &quot; The Hoppening. &quot; Dressed in a gold-sequined cowboy_hat , sheer gold-mesh halter top and matching pants , she easily out-dragged the handful of assembled drag queens -- especially in the cleavage department . But like any good post-feminist entrepreneur , she stuck_to business . &quot; We ' re trying to raise money to fight a disease . Why do people get so caught_up in these political things ? &quot; she huffed in response to suggestions that the L.A. event would be dominated by New York design types . ( Anna Sui , Todd Oldham , Azzedine Alaia , Betsey Johnson , Laura Whitcomb and the artist formerly known as Prince have agreed to reshape the most famous of bunnies. ) &quot; Chrome Hearts is from L.A. , Isabel Toledo , LA Eyeworks , Abel Villarreal -- they ' re all from here . But what difference does_it make ? &quot; In fact , L.A. met New York in the evening ' s most exquisite attire , a custom leather costume Villarreal designed for New York actor / performance artist Joey Arias . Originally made_for Arias ' role as Cirque du Soleil ringmaster , the costume was bunny-ized with an enormous black marabou tail and rather devilish leather ears . We wonder what Hef would have said ? Tickets for &quot; The Hoppening , &quot; which benefits AIDS Project Los Angeles and the Design Industries Foundation Fighting AIDS , can be purchased by calling ( 310 ) 652-6601 . * Summer Reading : Those who can ' t wait for Robert Altman ' s &quot; Pret-a-Porter &quot; for their fix of fashion dish can turn_to Olivia Goldsmith ' s novel of love , loss , neurosis and name-dropping , &quot; Fashionably Late &quot; ( HarperCollins , 1994 ) . It ' s about a tall , slightly heavy , potato-faced designer who soars to the top of the fashion world only to see all that she ' s struggled for ruined by her handsome , artist husband / business partner . Sound like anyone we know -- or wear ? &quot; Lots of people have said it ' s Donna Karan , but I wrote this before her troubles began , &quot; said Goldsmith , who trolled Seventh Avenue for such nuggets of verisimilitude as one high-profile designer ' s habit of simultaneously moving her bowels and dictating letters . Ultimately , the writer ' s sympathies lie_with the beleaguered consumer . &quot; I didn ' t want to write an anti-fashion book , but I think there ' s something sick about overshopping . Every woman I talked to , from fashion junkies to women who don ' t care , felt they didn ' t have the right clothes . Nobody has the right stuff. &quot; As for Goldsmith , &quot; nobody cares what a writer wears , &quot; she said . &quot; But mostly I look_like a bad version of a Dana Buchman ad. &quot; * True Colors : &quot; I am not a model . I have not been a model since 1989 . I am a businesswoman. &quot; And Iman can prove it . This week she hit local JCPenney stores to introduce her eponymous line of cosmetics and skin-care products for women of color . A line she created , for a company s he co-founded , in packaging she designed . Frustrated by having to mix and match makeup to attain perfection , Iman decided to help those of us without access to professional help . The resulting collection is 132 items strong , with name groupings that range from back-to-nature ( Sand , Clay or Earth ) to positively scrumptious ( Warm Spices , Roasted Nuts ) . A sometime actress , Iman will appear in the film version of Anne Rice ' s S &amp; M novel , &quot; Exit to Eden , &quot; due out_in October , and although she ' s been_active in the film_industry , &quot; I don ' t want to sit_by the pool and wait . I want control over my life . I have longevity in mind. &quot; To that end , she plans to introduce hair and fragrance products next year . Plus she ' s taking Spanish lessons to help her tap into the South_American market . And as Iman notes , in the year 2050 , people_of_color will represent more_than 50 % of U.S. residents . If things go as planned , the Under Cover Agent Oil Control Lotion could well ensure her complete global domination . Guess she really does mean business . * Pretty in White : Many_an eyebrow was raised in the 900-year-old Holy Cross Abbey in Thurles , Ireland , recently when Cranberries lead singer Dolores O ' Riordan walked down the aisle . &quot; You could see the look_on the priest ' s face as she came_in , like , ' Oh , Lord , ' giggled New York designer Cynthia Rowley , who made the racy wedding outfit to the bride ' s specifications . It consisted_of a sheer opalescent silk boxer ' s robe with nine-foot train , tiny tank , lace leggings and thong panties that revealed a jewel in the bride ' s bellybutton . New platinum locks and lace-up boots completed the head-to-toe ivory ensemble . Groom Don Burton wore a black leather tuxedo with tails and snakeskin vest , and arrived -- in what is fast-becoming a ' 90s cliche -- on a black stallion . O ' Riordan , who arrived in a cart drawn by a white_horse , didn ' t sing her current angelic hit &quot; Dreams , &quot; but did sing a traditional hymn . * Everything We Know We Learned in a Beauty_Salon : Someday , the Internet will set_aside a place in cyberspace for beauty tips . Till then , we ' ll just get them the old-fashioned way , in crash courses at the beauty_parlor . From our most recent visit : Put milk on a cotton_ball to soothe a recently waxed upper lip . Dab liver_spots with a good alpha-hydroxy acid twice a day . Make a low-calorie ice-blended coffee with NutraSweet and nonfat milk . If you use Christian Dior Tres Tres Dior nail_polish ( to match your Tres Tres Dior lipstick ) , which has been recalled to have the toxin touluene removed , buy Chanel ' s latest shade of red , Vamp . It ' s a favorite of models , but be prepared to dunk your fingers in polish remover to get the stuff off . Sebastian ' s new Stain looks_like grape-sucker color_in the tube , but glistens cherry_red on the lips . And finally , washing your hair the day you color it will make your scalp itchy . Whew ! * Inside Out is published Thursdays</TEXT>
