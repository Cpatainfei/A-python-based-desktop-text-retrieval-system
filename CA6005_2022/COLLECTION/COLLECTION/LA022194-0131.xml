   <HEADLINE> THE TIMES POLL ; CONSERVATIVE TREND FOUND IN YOUNGER PRIESTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pope John Paul II , whose 15-year reign over the Roman_Catholic_Church has been marked by repeated efforts to restore orthodoxy , may now be succeeding in attracting a new crop of more conservative priests to carry the church into the next millennium . Although it is too early to say whether there is a sustained drift toward orthodoxy , younger priests are clearly more religiously orthodox and politically conservative than middle-aged priests , according to a nationwide poll of priests by The Times . Ordained during the pontificate of John Paul , they are less supportive of ordaining women and allowing priests to marry than are middle-aged priests , and they are less tolerant of married_couples using artificial birth_control or surrogate birth mothers to bring a child to term . On other moral issues , such_as euthanasia , abortion or sexual_relations outside of marriage , both younger and middle-aged priests tend to be orthodox in their thinking . Only the oldest priests are more conservative . In the political_arena , nearly 40 % of priests 35 and younger consider themselves conservative -- almost double the percentage between the ages of 36 and 50 . Moreover , the youngest priests are twice as likely to identify with the Republican_Party ( 35 % ) than are priests in_general ( 16 % ) . The findings from the poll of 2 # 087 Roman_Catholic priests and 1 # 049 Roman_Catholic nuns appear to validate results in recent church-sponsored polls that point to greater conservatism among new priests . &quot; The pattern is there in dozens of questions on the poll indicating that the traditional character of the 15-year pontificate of John Paul II is clearly affecting the selection , or self-selection process , for new candidates for ordination , &quot; Times Poll Director John Brennan said . The findings are among a wealth of information on how priests and nuns view their church -- its strengths , its problems and its future . Overall , significant majorities of priests and nuns are happy in their calling , would take their vows again if they had a choice and think well of John Paul ' s job performance . &quot; Honest to God , &quot; wrote a self-described liberal 61-year-old priest from the Northeast , &quot; I am still extremely excited about the gift of faith , the life it gives and sustains , the peace beyond all telling ( beyond Rome ) . What a comfort . I ' m proud to share. &quot; But even though the vast majority of priests appear to be happy with their lives , they are less sanguine about the institutional church in the United States . Fifty-three percent of all priests believe it is weaker than it was 30 years ago ; 29 % say it is stronger . Another 10 % say the strength of the church is about the same . A bare majority of priests -- 54 % -- call things in the church excellent or good , whereas 43 % say they ' re not so good or poor . Nuns are more pessimistic still , with 51 % assessing things as not so good or poor , compared to 44 % who believe things are good or excellent . Priests are fairly evenly divided between those who say things are getting better ( 31 % ) and worse ( 33 % ) , with 25 % saying things are about the same . When asked what the greater danger for the church is these days , 42 % said it was the excessive desire to please secular and humanistic forces in society ; 28 % said it was resistance to reform of moral doctrines . The poll found that a disproportionate number of priests ( 95 % ) are white at a time when the ethnic diversity of the church in the United States is demanding new approaches to ministry . However , 24 % of all priests now speak Spanish , with more_than two of five priests 35 or younger speaking that language . Although the number of Catholics continues to grow , priests and nuns say when people leave the church they do so because of both shortcomings by the institutional church , the influence of materialism and secular culture , and a lack of faith and commitment by individuals . But perhaps the most intriguing finding has to do with a possible drift toward orthodoxy by the newest and youngest of priests . They are more conservative as a group than are middle-aged priests , who were ordained and matured in the priesthood during the 1960s , when the Second Vatican Council ushered_in an era of renewal and reform within the church . By contrast , the new priests were trained during a time when John Paul has steadfastly championed a return to orthodoxy , emphasized that the church ' s moral teachings are unchangeable , elevated conservative priests to the episcopacy , and made clear his unflinching opposition to artificial birth_control , women priests , married priests , &quot; cafeteria Catholicism &quot; and dissenting theologians . Only about 20 % of all priests between the ages of 36 and 60 describe themselves as religiously conservative , but 32 % of the youngest priests do so . Only priests older than 70 are more conservative as a group , the poll found . In the oldest group , 49 % call themselves religious conservatives . Experts within the church disagree whether the more conservative complexion of the youngest group of priests constitutes a trend toward an orthodox restoration . &quot; I would be wary about saying you have a trend here , &quot; said the Rev . Andrew W . Greeley , a Catholic sociologist , author and associate at the National Opinion Research_Center in Chicago . But church sociologist Dean Hoge of Catholic University of America in Washington said that The Times ' findings replicate those in separate church-sponsored polls . Hoge said there is &quot; a very definite trend &quot; toward conservatism by younger priests -- at least on issues involving the priesthood , if not always on moral issues . Given John Paul ' s appointment of conservative bishops and other efforts to restore orthodoxy , the growing number of conservatives among new priests isn ' t surprising , said Richard A . Schoenherr , a sociology of religion professor at the University of Wisconsin and author of &quot; Full Pews , Empty Altars. &quot; &quot; It ' s something that was predictable with_regard_to the kind of church the current Pope is trying to construct , &quot; Schoenherr said in an interview . But he and Brennan noted that the youngest priests account_for just 6 % of the total priest population in the United States . And despite the greater percentage of conservatives within their group , most young priests still consider themselves moderates or liberals . &quot; The evolution toward orthodoxy and the Republican_Party will no doubt take some time , &quot; Brennan said . Nonetheless , the signs of increased conservatism among the current group of new , young priests is unmistakable . On a raft of issues , the youngest priests are more closely aligned with the Pope and the most orthodox members of the hierarchy . These priests are more likely to approve of how John Paul has handled his duties as Supreme Pontiff , and say that the Pope ' s views on moral issues are &quot; about right. &quot; They are also more apt to oppose a declaration of rights for dissenting Catholic theologians . Last August , for example , in a landmark encyclical_letter to the world ' s bishops , the Pope said that if Catholic theologians fail to be faithful to church teachings they should be stripped of the title &quot; Catholic &quot; and barred from teaching at Catholic institutions . A 29-year-old priest from the Midwest who described himself as a religious conservative agrees with the papal directive . &quot; There exists in the Roman_Catholic_Church too_much pick-and-choose Catholicism , &quot; he wrote_on his questionnaire . &quot; To be considered Catholic , one must accept all that the church teaches. &quot; Considering John Paul ' s uncompromising belief that artificial birth_control is morally evil , he would not likely be pleased that only 48 % of the youngest priests say that it is always or often sinful . But there is even less support from middle-aged priests -- 36 % of those between ages 36 and 50 , and 37 % among those 51 to 60 . The church condemns homosexual acts and not homosexuality per se , so the ordination of celibate homosexuals is not strictly forbidden . But support for such ordinations varies among priests , with 53 % in support and 41 % in opposition . The youngest and middle_aged priests were more enthusiastic . Sixty-eight percent of those 35 or younger favor ordaining celibate homosexual men , and 69 % of those age 35 to 50 are in favor . Priests over 70 oppose the idea 61 % to 30 % . Despite the fact that higher percentages of younger priests are conservative , an orthodox restoration won ' t come overnight . Brennan noted that those between ages 36 and 60 account_for almost half the priest population . And despite their Republican drift , most of the younger priests are still Democrats ( 32 % ) or independents ( 29 % ) . It is unclear why higher numbers of the new priests are more religiously orthodox and politically conservative . Authorities within the church suggest several reasons . The first is self-selection . &quot; It ' s not that seminary training has been changed . It ' s who self-selected themselves to enter seminary , &quot; said Hoge at Catholic University of America . Another factor may be that the youngest priests grew_up in the Reagan-Bush era . Greeley called it the &quot; period effect. &quot; &quot; The people that were ordained in the ' 60s grew_up in the ' 60s , which was a radical era , &quot; he said . &quot; The people who are being ordained now grew_up in a more conservative era. &quot; Regardless of_age or religious ideology , by far the biggest problem listed by priests is the shortage of priests . Nearly 60 % of all priests favored the idea of allowing married priests . &quot; The church will continue to languish as long as we maintain that only celibates may serve in the priesthood , &quot; said a 57-year-old priest in the South . &quot; The laity want service and holy priests and could care less about marital status. &quot; There are any number of other explanations for the shortfall in vocations . Some believe the scandal of child sexual abuse has taken a toll . &quot; The message I get_in general is this thing about sexual abuse by clergy has been a real downer for the priesthood , &quot; said Hoge . &quot; It has been absolutely the worst thing that ' s happened . The people around here just wish to God it hadn ' t happened . It ' s taking a toll on everybody , taking a toll on finances , and on people entering the priesthood. &quot; Although U.S. bishops continue to put new safeguards in place , support groups for clergy sexual abuse victims say the church has not done enough . Less than half ( 41 % ) of the priests surveyed said they considered pedophilia within the priesthood as a &quot; very serious &quot; problem . Another 31 % called it somewhat serious , and 18 % called it not too serious or not at all serious . Many priests in written explanations , however , stressed that they were unsure how to respond , saying that even one case would be very serious but that they did not want to indicate the problem was widespread . Brennan said the question was phrased as it was not to measure the potential amount of child sexual abuse but the intensity of priests ' attitudes about the issue . &quot; Obviously , one case of clergy pedophilia is serious -- very serious , &quot; said a 66-year-old priest in the Midwest . &quot; But if you speak_of the number of cases or actual clerical offenders it is a very small percentage , much smaller than that of other professional people. &quot; Told of the explanation , Greeley , who has severely criticized the church for its slow response in the past , said he was astounded . &quot; They don ' t think it ' s a serious problem ! But it is an enormous problem ! &quot; Jason Berry , the author of a book on the problem , has estimated that between 1984 and 1992 , more_than 400 Catholic priests in North_America were reported to have molested children . As of that time , he estimated , the church had paid_out $ 400 million to resolve the cases .

How the Poll Was Conducted This Times Poll is based on interviews with 2 # 087 Roman_Catholic priests and 1 # 049 Roman_Catholic nuns in dioceses across the United States , including Puerto Rico . The survey was conducted by mail from September , 1993 , through this past January . It represents responses to a mailing of 5 # 000 questionnaires to priests in 80 dioceses and 2 # 500 to nuns in 45 dioceses . The samples of dioceses were chosen from a list that gives the total number of priests and nuns in all dioceses nationwide . Respondents within targeted dioceses were then chosen randomly from available lists . The questionnaires , in English and Spanish , were self-administered and anonymous , though some respondents volunteered to be interviewed and quoted by name . Both samples were weighted slightly to account_for variations in the number of responses received from each diocese . The demographics of both surveys have been examined by academic experts in the field of priests and nuns sociology and have been found comparable_to previous research in this area . The margin of sampling error for the survey of priests is plus or minus 3 percentage_points ; for the survey of nuns it is plus or minus 4 points . In both polls , results based on subgroups may have a somewhat higher sampling error . Poll results can also be affected by other factors such_as wording of questions and the reluctance of some respondents to participate in surveys .</TEXT>
