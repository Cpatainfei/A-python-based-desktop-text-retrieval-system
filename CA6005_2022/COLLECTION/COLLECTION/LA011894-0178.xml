   <HEADLINE> RABIN PLEDGES NATIONAL REFERENDUM ON ANY GOLAN HEIGHTS WITHDRAWAL ; MIDEAST : GOVERNMENT MAKES IT CLEAR THAT ANY DEAL WITH SYRIA WOULD HAVE TO BE SOLD TO A VERY SKEPTICAL NATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin ' s government pledged Monday to hold a national referendum on any major Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights as a result of a peace agreement with Syria . Mordechai Gur , the deputy defense minister , told the Israeli Knesset , or Parliament , that Rabin would seek popular approval -- in_effect , a renewal of the mandate for peace he won in June , 1992 , elections -- before pulling troops off the strategic plateau . &quot; At this stage , I want to make clear that if the territorial price demanded from us on the Golan Heights is substantial , the government will bring this to a referendum , &quot; Gur told the Knesset , stressing that he was speaking_for Rabin . In terms of negotiations with Syria , the declaration made clear that Rabin considered himself bound by public_opinion -- that any deal would have to be sold to a very skeptical nation for which the Golan Heights are a key element in its defenses and for which retreat from the region would be psychologically difficult . But Rabin was also challenging the vociferous opposition Likud Party not in the general_election that it seeks but in a popular contest in which political odds currently favor his Labor_Party . He was thus making clear his determination to reach a comprehensive peace with all Israel ' s Arab neighbors . All told , Gur ' s declaration was Israel ' s cautiously affirmative response to overtures from Syrian President Hafez Assad who , in a meeting Sunday with President Clinton in Geneva , declared his readiness for a full and normal peace with the Jewish state . Gur , a former army chief_of_staff , signaled Israel ' s readiness to make the necessary withdrawals -- even the total pullout sought by Assad -- in return for regional stability and for peace . &quot; We are a very strong country , &quot; Gur said . &quot; We will provide a solution to the security of Israel . . . . On the basis of our strength , it is our duty to take the calculated risk. &quot; Leaders of the 13 # 000 Israeli settlers on the Golan Heights , convinced that the country supports them , welcomed Gur ' s declaration as an answer to their long campaign against territorial concessions there . &quot; We are very pleased , &quot; said Yehuda Wohlman , one of the campaign ' s leaders . &quot; I see this as an extraordinary achievement in our struggle . It ' s good that the prime_minister has been so sensitive to our feelings. &quot; But Environment Minister Yossi Sarid of the leftist Meretz bloc objected to the referendum pledge , saying that the government had neither discussed nor decided on this and already had an electoral mandate . &quot; The subject has never been deliberated in the Cabinet , &quot; Sarid said , &quot; and the government has never taken a decision on this matter. &quot; A referendum , in fact , would require new legislation -- and there would be a parliamentary battle over it . &quot; In the dictionary of political_science , the term ' national referendum ' is known as a manipulative tool by the government to design popular_opinion , apparently to gain legitimacy but thus to circumvent elections that are the classic instrument to determine public_opinion , &quot; declared Tzachi Hanegbi , a Likud member of the Knesset . Rabin has said in the past that he did not think the Israeli public was prepared_for an agreement returning the Golan Heights , or a major portion of it , to Syria so soon after the accord with the Palestine Liberation Organization on limited self-government for Jericho , in the West_Bank , and for the Gaza Strip . A referendum would thus offer him a way to consolidate his political position and do both deals . But Israeli political commentators say that Rabin could also initial a peace agreement with Syria and then call a national election to reconfirm public support for his entire peace platform . Syria ' s central demand in two years of negotiations with Israel has been for the return of all_the Golan Heights , captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle_East War , in return for full peace . Israel has offered to pull_back its forces in the region as part of a peace agreement , but says that the extent depends_on what full peace means . Dennis Ross , the U.S. State_Department ' s coordinator for the Mideast peace talks , briefed Israeli leaders in Jerusalem on the U.S. assessment of the Clinton-Assad talks and said he expected Israel and Syria to move forward when they resume direct negotiations next week in Washington .</TEXT>
