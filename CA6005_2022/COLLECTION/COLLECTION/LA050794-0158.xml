   <HEADLINE> SEISMIC GRANTS UP TO $ 5 # 000 TO BE OFFERED TO QUAKE VICTIMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Disaster officials announced Friday that they will send_out 250 # 000 letters next week offering_up to $ 5 # 000 in earthquake retrofitting funds to homeowners who file applications for less than $ 10 # 000 in federal assistance to repair their homes . The kind of retrofitting that would qualify for the additional federal grants includes bolting houses to foundations , strapping water_heaters to walls , and bracing chimneys , cripple walls or mobile_homes , according to state and federal_officials . The Federal Emergency Management Agency will pay a set amount -- such_as $ 50 to strap water_heaters -- for each specific retrofitting operation , with the maximum grant of $ 5 # 000 per household . The announcement by Richard Andrews , director of the state Office of Emergency Services , and John W . Eldridge Jr. , a federal hazard mitigation officer , made_it clear that the retrofitting money would go only to those who apply for earthquake repair assistance . The deadline for applications has been extended_to July 17 . Andrews and Eldridge disclosed the plans at a news_conference concluding a two-day workshop in Pasadena sponsored by FEMA and the Office of Emergency Services . About 100 local and state officials gathered to discuss what additional steps need to be taken_to guard to the maximum extent from future quake damage . One idea broached during the discussions was the possibility of mandatory strengthening of all private homes_in seismically risky areas . But this was dismissed as being politically infeasible . L . Thomas Tobin , executive_director of the state Seismic Safety Commission , noted that a mandatory residential retrofitting bill won legislative approval in 1990 but was vetoed by Gov . George Deukmejian . Tobin said no such proposal is being considered and that although the state recommends retrofitting , it remains up_to homeowners whether to undertake it . Andrews and Eldridge said the letter to go_out next week will contain a brochure outlining the kinds of retrofitting that might be advisable at the time earthquake repairs are performed . They added that the federal Small Business Administration will also encourage retrofitting by adding_up to 20 % to loan amounts for those applying for assistance of more_than $ 10 # 000 . &quot; We intend to recommend a number of amendments to the state ' s existing hazard mitigation plan based on the ongoing studies of the Northridge quake , &quot; Eldridge said . For instance , he said , broken sprinkler pipes caused by the earthquake led to flooding that severely damaged many offices . &quot; A small fix could have prevented a serious loss , &quot; he said , &quot; so that should be part of the new plan. &quot;</TEXT>
