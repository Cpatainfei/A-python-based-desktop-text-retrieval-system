   <HEADLINE> EX-PATIENT REPORTS TWO EARLIER CASES OF HOSPITAL FUMES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Several weeks before mysterious fumes forced the evacuation of the Riverside General Hospital emergency_room , a patient had to evacuate his own room after noxious fumes overcame him and his wife , the man said Thursday . Dennis Weiss , a 52-year-old cancer patient , said the stench was so strong it made him vomit before he covered his face with a blanket and his wife fled for help . The nurse who responded remarked that such odors were not unusual , and blamed it on nurses on higher floors who dump various liquids into the hospital ' s plumbing_system , Weiss said . Two days later , chemical fumes again filled his room , Weiss said -- and for a second time , he and his visiting wife and daughter had to leave it until the air cleared . Weiss reported the incidents to the attorney representing the family of Gloria Ramirez , the 31-year-old woman who died in the Riverside General Hospital emergency_room Feb . 19 after mysterious fumes sickened six attendants and caused the evacuation of the emergency_room . State investigators said Thursday that the hospital ' s plumbing_system is a primary focus of their inquiry into the source of the fumes . State and county public health experts have not yet determined the source of the fumes or what caused the death of Ramirez , who had cancer . She had gone_to the hospital complaining of breathing difficulties and went_into cardiac_arrest . The affected emergency_room attendants said they got dizzy , and several collapsed and required hospitalization , after smelling an ammonia-like odor when a sample of the woman ' s blood was drawn into a syringe . The chief emergency_room physician said he did not notice an odor , but detected crystals in the blood sample . As his colleagues began to collapse around him , the physician , Dr. Humberto Ochoa , noticed liquids in the drain of an emergency_room basin and flushed_it , Riverside County spokesman Tom DeSantis said . &quot; He was trying to rule it out as a possibility , right at the scene , &quot; DeSantis said . &quot; that ' s normal procedure. &quot; When the Riverside City Fire_Department ' s hazardous-materials team tested the emergency_room air several hours after the incident , they found nothing unusual . Ronald Schwartz , a Newport Beach attorney representing the Ramirez family , said Weiss gave a sworn declaration detailing his encounter with fumes at the hospital . Weiss ' experience , Schwartz said , suggests that the hospital , and not Ramirez , was the source of the mystery fumes . A spokesman for Cal / OSHA , the state job safety agency , said Thursday that Riverside General Hospital was cited in 1990 and 1991 for a series of violations of exposure standards relating to the use of ethylene oxide , an extremely toxic gas that is used for sterilizing instruments . In the 1990 violations , the hospital was cited for not providing adequate respirators for use by staff_members working with ethylene oxide , and for an inadequate system of alerting people to its presence . The same violations were cited the following year , said Cal / OSHA spokesman Rick Rice . This time , because of the recurrence , the violations were deemed &quot; willful and serious. &quot; &quot; In the hierarchy of Cal / OSHA violations , those are up near the top , &quot; Rice said . Six other serious citations relating to the handling of ethylene oxide at the hospital were made in 1991 before the problem was resolved the following year , he said . Additionally , the hospital was cited in 1991 and 1992 for failing to maintain annual inspection records of its ventilation_system , Rice said . In the Ramirez case , Rice said , Cal / OSHA investigators are focusing_on the hospital ' s plumbing_system and method of disposing_of chemicals . In many California communities , the state ' s Department of Health Service monitors how hospitals dispose_of their hazardous waste . But counties have the option of enforcing such state laws at the local level and , in the case of Riverside General Hospital , the monitoring is done_by the county ' s Environmental Health Department . Jack McGurk , who heads the state health department ' s biomedical waste management branch , said there is concern about how hospitals dump chemicals -- whether they are cleaning agents or dated medicines . &quot; In some cases , there might not be a ( disposal ) problem . But , if you ' re cleaning the commode with one kind of cleaner , then drop Clorox in somewhere else , the two are incompatible and you can have something happen right then and there . &quot; These are things that a hospital ' s housekeeping staff should or would want to know about -- how are they disposing mop water , or cleaners and , on top of that , chemicals , solutions and outdated medicines. &quot; Dennis and Jenny Weiss said their first encounter with noxious odors at Riverside General occurred Jan . 13 , during his five-day stay for chemotherapy treatment on the hospital ' s third floor . &quot; I heard the sink gurgling and then there was a horrible smell , &quot; Jenny Weiss said . &quot; It was an awful smell , a toxic smell , and I knew if I stayed in the room any longer , I ' d get sick. &quot; Her husband said : &quot; I ' ve worked with chemicals all my life , but I can ' t describe what this was . I ' ve never smelled anything like it. &quot; Two days later , the same thing happened . Weiss said he told nurses , &quot; You ' d better call a plumber. &quot; The family did not formally complain to the hospital , or to the county of Riverside , which operates the hospital . But after hearing of the Ramirez incident , the family contacted attorney Schwartz . DeSantis said Thursday that he could not comment on the Weiss incident , nor could he immediately determine if there was any history of complaints of foul fumes at the hospital .</TEXT>
