   <HEADLINE> FUNDING CRISIS SHOULDN ' T AFFECT O.C. ' S I-5 WORK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A severe financial crisis in the state ' s transportation program is expected to delay millions of dollars in road projects designed to ease congestion on clogged Los Angeles freeways , but Orange County ' s biggest highway-widening project should be spared . Rail projects critical to getting Southland motorists out of their cars may also be vulnerable as state officials attempt to make_good on their promise to give earthquake safety first priority for scarce transportation dollars . In Orange County , the biggest project in the state transportation plan -- the massive expansion of the Santa Ana Freeway through the heart of the region -- is likely to escape unscathed . Local transportation officials plan to use money from the county ' s half-cent sales tax measure for transportation , which was approved by voters in 1990 , to make_up for any shortfalls in state money . &quot; We ' ve done a shift to keep our priority on the Interstate 5 at a high level , &quot; said Stanley T . Oftelie , Orange County Transportation Authority executive_director . The $ 2-billion project , which will double the number of lanes from southern Orange County to the Los Angeles County_line , won ' t be completed until early next century . While the Interstate 5 project shouldn ' t be hurt , widening work_on the Costa Mesa and Riverside freeways will be delayed four years or longer . that ' s because sales tax money planned for those projects would be diverted to keep the Santa Ana Freeway project moving . About $ 94 million would come from funds intended for widening the Costa Mesa Freeway north of the Garden Grove Freeway , and $ 114 million would come from funds for widening the Riverside Freeway between the Orange Freeway and the Los Angeles County_line . Orange County residents commuting northward may also feel the effect of project delays in Los Angeles County , where the crisis means that everything from the long-awaited extension of the Foothill Freeway in the San Gabriel Valley to the completion of a system of high-occupancy vehicle lanes along the San Diego Freeway may be put_on hold . Even mass transit projects like the Pasadena Light Rail and the extension of the Red_Line into the San Fernando Valley could be subject_to postponements as officials try to squeeze enough funds out of road and rail projects to pay_for the strengthening of highway bridges subject_to damage in severe earthquakes . The official estimate is that the delays would last at least a year , but other transportation experts predict it could be much longer as the state continues to identify more bridges in need of retrofitting . The revenue crisis &quot; is going_to ricochet back and forth , up and down the state , &quot; said California Transportation Commission Chairwoman Octavia Diener . &quot; A lot of projects are going_to be stretched_out and take a lot longer to build , and it already takes too long to build these things. &quot; But even as congestion-easing projects are being delayed , Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz ( D-Sylmar ) said motorists shouldn ' t lose sight of what they are getting_in return -- the peace_of_mind that highway bridges will not collapse in a major temblor . &quot; Los Angeles is at much greater risk because of a lack of seismic retrofit than the expansion of road projects , &quot; he said . &quot; Having to make the choice , I think seismic retrofit is much more important than new roads . We ought to make the roads that we have safe. &quot; The tug of war over funds between roads and retrofitting was precipitated by the voters ' rejection in the June 7 primary_election of Proposition 1A , a proposed bond issue that earmarked $ 1 billion for the seismic strengthening of bridges . The bond issue ' s failure meant that all bridge retrofitting costs would then have to be absorbed by the transportation program , which was already facing funding shortages because of a slump in gasoline_tax revenue and voter rejection of an earlier rail bond issue . In fact , in January , even before the Northridge earthquake made seismic retrofitting a high-profile issue , Caltrans Director James van Loben Sels confided to a legislative workshop that insufficient revenue would send the state ' s transportation program &quot; off the cliff &quot; in 1995 . &quot; Because of the June 7 defeat of Proposition 1A . . . the voters shoved the program over the precipice and into a free fall about six months sooner than expected , &quot; Arthur Bauer , executive_director of Californians for Better Transportation , wrote his members in their latest newsletter . In the next few days transportation officials will put a cost estimate on the second phase of the seismic strengthening program . Once that is done , they will face the unsavory task of determining which other road and rail projects will be slowed_down to pay_for it . Rail projects are less threatened because in most cases they don ' t have to share scarce gasoline_tax dollars with the seismic program ; much of their financing is from bond issues or specially earmarked federal funds . The catch there is that , given the fiscally conservative mood of the voters , a $ 1-billion bond issue scheduled to go_on the ballot in November is considered to have little likelihood of passing . Some officials , including Katz , are pushing to keep the measure off the ballot rather than face what they predict is certain defeat . Without that bond issue , the funding shortage would climb to about $ 3 billion and financing would become less certain for projects like the Pasadena Light Rail and the East-West Valley Line , a mass transit rail_line that will run_across the San Fernando Valley connecting with the Red_Line subway . &quot; If we don ' t have a bond issue or some_other way to fund those projects , they could be impacted ( by the crisis ) , &quot; said Linda Bohlinger , the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation ' s deputy executive_officer for capital planning . She said one hopeful sign that these projects may have a better chance of keeping_on track than the road projects is that both Senate Transportation Committee Chairman Quentin Kopp ( I-San Francisco ) and Katz are urging the Wilson Administration not to delay any mass transit projects . &quot; The rationale for leaving rail out of the freeze is that rail is the one thing that worked well both in the Loma Prieta and the Northridge earthquakes , &quot; Katz said . Caltrans officials confirm that it is mostly road projects that will be delayed , but they say how many will not be known until an assessment is completed of the number of bridges that will need retrofitting . They acknowledge , however , that delays are likely to hit most large projects scheduled for the latter half of the decade . In the meantime , projects likely to face delays include : * The addition of car-pool lanes in both directions on a 7.6-mile section of the San Diego Freeway from the Orange County_line to the Long_Beach Freeway . Bohlinger said the $ 37-million project is a key element in local plans for a major high-occupancy vehicle system designed to relieve congestion on Los Angeles County freeways . * The six-mile extension of the Foothill Freeway from its terminus at Foothill Boulevard to the San Bernardino County_Line . Bohlinger said that for years the $ 274-million project has had the highest priority in Los Angeles County freeway system because it would relieve a critical bottleneck in the fast-growing northeast sector of the county . Plans for the extension call_for the construction of four lanes , including a car-pool lane , in each direction . * The construction of a San Diego Freeway interchange at Arbor Vitae Street , a project first requested by the Los Angeles Department of Airports in 1976 . The $ 24-million project would provide access to LAX from the San Diego Freeway as well as the Century Freeway .</TEXT>
