   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEW ; ' THE BLUE KITE ' : AN HONEST , POWERFUL CHINESE SAGA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Of all_the remarkable films to have come_out of China over the past few years , &quot; The Blue Kite &quot; could well be the most authentic , the most accessible and , finally , the most powerful . Daring politically and quietly shattering emotionally , it tells the truth in such a completely human way that it hardly seems foreign at all . Unlike the work of fellow Fifth Generation filmmakers Chen Kiage ( &quot; Farewell My Concubine &quot; ) and Zhang Yimou ( &quot; Raise the Red Lantern &quot; ) , there is nothing theatrical or operatic about this film from director Tian Zhuangzhuang . A welcoming naturalism characterizes his style here , an ability to see great events through the lives of ordinary people caught unawares in the toils of history that is immediately involving . Set between the death of Stalin in 1953 and the living death of 1968 ' s Cultural Revolution , Xiao Mao ' s realistic script illuminates that most chaotic period of modern Chinese politics by telling the story of an ordinary woman named Chen Shujuan ( popular Chinese actress Lu Liping ) and her extended family . Simple as it is , this idea did not find favor with the powers who run China ' s film_industry . After viewing a rough cut of &quot; The Blue Kite , &quot; they forbade shipping the footage to Japan ( where most Chinese films go_for post-production ) . The film was spirited out anyway , edited according to the director ' s detailed notes , and shown to great praise both at Cannes and the Tokyo Film Festival , where the Chinese delegation walked_out during the screening and later announced plans to sue the Dutch company that had acquired the world rights . It may seem unusual for such a quiet film to have stirred_up such a considerable fuss , but it is just the discretion and restraint with which &quot; The Blue Kite &quot; was created that makes its points so effective and its indictment of China ' s past political situation so damning . Certainly when we first meet Shujuan , everything seems happy and hopeful . Much to the delight of her idealistic sister ( Song Xiaoying ) and her brothers ( Zhong Ping and Chu Quanzhong ) , she is about to marry librarian Lin Shaolong ( Pu Quanxin ) and move_into a small apartment in a bustling Beijing courtyard . Soon a son , called Tietou or &quot; Iron Head , &quot; is born and , true_to his nickname , he grows_up to be the film ' s stubborn narrator . Much of the action of &quot; The Blue Kite &quot; takes_place in that busy courtyard and among the members of that family . Director Tian is a thoughtful , nuanced observer , and , helped by Hou Yong ' s sensitive camerawork , he gets a great_deal of poignancy out of intimate family scenes between brother and sister , mother and child , husband and wife . These moments play_out against the turmoil caused by the topsy-turvy political_movements of the day . First came Rectification , a call from the Communist_Party for honesty and criticism , followed almost immediately by an Anti-Rightist campaign that condemned those who did speak out . Next was the Great Leap Forward , a frantic attempt to increase China ' s industrial production , which led finally to the mad terror of the Cultural Revolution . &quot; The Blue Kite &quot; is especially good at showing how difficult it was for ordinary people to try to find space to just survive as the baffling crosswinds of politics caused the loss of jobs , relationships , even lives . &quot; The more I think_about it , &quot; Shujuan says at one point , more in resignation than in anger , &quot; the less I understand. &quot; This kind of rigorous , unforgiving look_at a major span of Chinese history , a willingness to take_on political_movements that are still off-limits to criticism , is one of the things that got &quot; The Blue Kite &quot; in such trouble with the authorities . The other taboo , apparently never before addressed on film , is official insistence that attractive women in the army eschew steady boyfriends and instead provide escort services for powerful party leaders as &quot; political duties. &quot; The only token of hope in this troubled time is the kite of the film ' s title . A fragile paper object that keeps getting destroyed or lost and then rebuilt , it symbolizes freedom , beauty , innocence and the hope of escape , all_the things that that generation of Chinese , as this film so carefully shows , had to live their lives without .
