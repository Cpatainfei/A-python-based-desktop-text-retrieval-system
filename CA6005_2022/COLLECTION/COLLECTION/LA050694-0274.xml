   <HEADLINE> CAMEL ' COLLECTOR ' S PACKS ' HAVE ANTI-SMOKING ACTIVISTS FUMING ; TOBACCO : R.J. REYNOLDS ' ACTION IS SEEN AS AN ATTEMPT TO LURE YOUNGSTERS . COMPANY INSISTS ITS MOTIVES ARE PURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The smirking face of Joe Camel has resurfaced on the last place that anti-smoking activists want to see him : cigarette packs . The provocative cartoon mascot for Camel cigarettes -- denounced by critics for its appeal_to children -- is being nationally distributed by tobacco giant R.J. Reynolds on cardboard &quot; collector ' s packs &quot; of Camel Lights as part of what the company is calling a temporary promotion . Just last month , the surgeon_general harshly criticized the cartoon mascot for its appeal_to children . And earlier this year , the company took heat after it added female camel caricatures to its ad mix . Marketing experts say the latest action by the tobacco company is a clear attempt to boost sales by more closely connecting the product with its highly publicized ad_campaign . Reynolds insists its motives are pure . The new packaging &quot; is just a fun thing for our franchise of smokers , &quot; said Maura Ellis , a spokeswoman for Reynolds . &quot; We ' ve said all along that if we felt the cartoon character was causing kids to begin smoking , we would stop it. &quot; But critics contend that Reynolds ' action is an attempt to get children to reach for the pack . &quot; This is a new low in advertising , &quot; fumed John F . Banzhaf III , executive_director of Action on Smoking &amp; Health . &quot; Children , of course , will now want to pick_up the packs and collect them . This is the most despicable thing that R.J. Reynolds has done. &quot; Despite claims by Reynolds executives that the cartoon camel has no special appeal_to children , &quot; it has become a status symbol among young kids , &quot; said David Altman , president of the group Stop Teen-age Addiction to Tobacco . &quot; Obviously , the company plans on pushing the camel cartoon just as far as it can. &quot; The latest promotion features five different camel characters -- four of which are members of the imaginary &quot; Hard Pack &quot; musical quartet , Ellis said . All of them also appear in print ads . Placing pictures of the big-nosed camels on the packs &quot; is a way to get consumers to look twice , &quot; said Stephen A . Greyser , marketing professor at Harvard_University . It prompts consumers to immediately link the product with the ads , he said . R.J. Reynolds and the rest of the tobacco_industry have faced mounting public criticism for months . Two weeks ago , top tobacco executives were humbled by a grilling from a congressional committee . Shortly before that , a report from Surgeon_General Joycelyn Elders specifically criticized the Joe Camel ads for their &quot; special &quot; appeal_to youth . A survey by the Journal of the American Medical Assn . several years ago found that some 6-year-olds said they were as familiar_with Joe Camel as with Mickey_Mouse . Another survey found that nearly 25 % of all Camel smokers are under 25 years old . Reynolds has also turned the cartoon camel into a promotional bonanza . It publishes catalogues that encourage smokers to purchase Camels by luring them with an array of free items -- from T-shirts to leather jackets -- in exchange for proof-of-purchases . The Joe Camel caricature was created by a British artist in 1974 for a French ad_agency . It debuted in the United States in 1988 for the 75th anniversary of the brand . At the time , the camel ' s face showed_up on all sorts of promotional_materials -- even briefly making an appearance on a limited number of cigarette packs before anyone knew who or what it was . Last year , Nicholas Price , who created Joe Camel , told a reporter that he was &quot; mortified &quot; the campaign appeared to attract children . After all , he said , he is a father of seven .</TEXT>
