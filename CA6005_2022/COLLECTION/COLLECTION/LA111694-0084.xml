   <HEADLINE> RED_DWARFS RULED_OUT IN ' MYSTERY OF MISSING MASS '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Overturning decades of conjecture over what the universe is made of , NASA said Tuesday that it has ruled_out the possibility that red_dwarf_stars make_up the dark matter that accounts_for most of the universe ' s mass . With the aid of the Hubble Space Telescope and a team of astronomers , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration said it has concluded that dim , small stars called red_dwarfs do not account_for more_than 90 % of the universe as initially thought . In fact , red_dwarf_stars , thought to be abundant , are actually sparse in the Earth ' s galaxy . NASA , along with the European Space Agency , determined that the faint red stars rarely form and that there is a cutoff point below which nature does not make this type of dim , low-mass star . &quot; Our results increase the mystery of the missing mass . They rule_out a popular but conservative interpretation of dark matter , &quot; John Bahcall , a natural_science professor and leader of one of the teams , said . Explanations centering_on the birth of the universe , including the big-bang theory , show that less than 5 % of the universe is made_up of &quot; normal stuff &quot; like neutrons and protons . This means that most of the universe is composed of unknown material that does not emit any radiation that can be detected by current technology . Possible explanations for dark matter include black_holes , neutron_stars and a variety of exotic particles .</TEXT>
