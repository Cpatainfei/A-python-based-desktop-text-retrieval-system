   <HEADLINE> POLITICS ; QUEBEC ONCE AGAIN TOPS CANADA AGENDA ; THE SEPARATISTS ' EVANGELISM AND PROSPECTS AT POLLS HAVE REIGNITED THE ISSUE . THE ARGUMENT OVER SECESSION ISN ' T WHETHER BUT HOW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Canada is being dragged reluctantly into a new confrontation over the future of French-speaking Quebec . In the last two weeks , political_leaders and commentators across Canada have lobbed rhetorical grenades at each other over the revived prospect of Quebec independence . Two factors have pushed Quebec back to the top of the national political agenda . First is the pending provincial election there , which by law must take_place by fall . Virtually every poll shows the separatist Parti Quebecois leading the governing Liberal_Party . PQ leader Jacques Parizeau has promised to begin laying the groundwork for separation immediately upon his election and to hold a province-wide referendum on independence within 10 months of taking_office . Second is the peripatetic Lucien Bouchard , leader of the Bloc Quebecois , the PQ ' s separatist counterpart in the federal_government in Ottawa . Bouchard has become an international evangelist for separatism . Last week , Bouchard was in Paris , seeking assurance of quick French recognition of an independent Quebec . He didn ' t get_it , at least publicly , but he did get saturation coverage in the Canadian media . Earlier this month , he preached his separatist message in British_Columbia and Alberta , the Canadian political equivalent of proselytizing for vegetarianism at a Texas cattlemen ' s convention . Most of the resulting argument has focused not on whether Quebec ought to be allowed to secede -- most Canadians agree that ' s for Quebecers to decide -- but what the terms of separation ought to be : What would the boundaries of the new country look_like ? Should the native peoples of Quebec be permitted to opt_out of independence and keep their lands in Canada ? What kind of economic relationship would Canada have with a sovereign Quebec ? The commentary suggests that this could be a very nasty divorce indeed . &quot; To hell with common_sense , one-sided decency and compromise . You don ' t win a country that way and you shouldn ' t lose one either , &quot; stormed columnist Peter C . Newman in the national news weekly Maclean ' s . In press interviews , British_Columbia Premier Michael Harcourt predicted his province would be &quot; the worst of enemies &quot; with an independent Quebec . Saskatchewan Premier Roy Romanow accused separatist leaders of pulling a &quot; con job &quot; on Quebec voters by suggesting separation would be simple and painless . Ron Irwin , minister of Indian Affairs , declared the federal_government would back native organizations that repudiated Quebec independence . Prime_Minister Jean Chretien , who like his predecessors for 25 of the last 26 years is from Quebec , has sought to avoid the issue , saying he remains confident his fellow Quebecers ultimately will reject separation . That prompted Preston Manning of Alberta , leader of the opposition Reform Party , to accuse the government this week of &quot; sleepwalking toward a . . . constitutional crisis. &quot; Analysts are divided on how the latest arguments might affect the coming Quebec election . Quebec voters have a history of unpredictability . While the PQ is ahead of the Liberals in current polls , the surveys show uncertainty about full separation . A poll over the weekend showed 52 % opposed to independence . The Bid for Sovereignty Here are key dates in recent battles over Quebec separation : * Oct . 12-14 , 1968 : The Parti Quebecois , dedicated to sovereignty for the French-speaking province , is formed . Rene Levesque is named leader . * Nov . 15 , 1976 : PQ wins provincial election after promising a referendum on sovereignty . Levesque becomes premier . * May 20 , 1980 : Quebecers defeat Levesque ' s proposal for sovereignty , 60 % to 40 % . * April 17 , 1982 : Queen Elizabeth_II signs a proclamation giving Canada its own constitution , replacing British North_America Act of 1867 . The move is opposed by Levesque , who says it is unfair to Quebec . ( Quebec is the only province to refuse to endorse the new constitution. ) * Oct . 3 , 1985 : Levesque retires . Pierre-Marc Johnson becomes Quebec premier and PQ leader . * Dec . 2 , 1985 : Robert Bourassa , leader of Quebec Liberal_Party and a Canadian federalist , defeats Johnson and PQ in provincial elections . * Nov . 1 , 1987 : Levesque dies . Johnson resigns as PQ leader nine days later and is succeeded by Jacques Parizeau . * June 22 , 1990 : Meech Lake agreement , envisioned by Prime_Minister Brian Mulroney as a solution to the Quebec conundrum , fails . * June 15 , 1991 : Lucien Bouchard and other disaffected members_of_Parliament from Quebec form the Bloc Quebecois to represent the separatist cause in the Canadian national government . * Oct . 26 , 1992 : Charlottetown accord , successor document to Meech Lake , is defeated decisively in a national referendum . * Oct . 25 , 1993 : Liberal_Party sweeps to victory in national election . * Jan . 11 , 1994 : Daniel Johnson , the new Liberal_Party leader in Quebec and a Canadian federalist , becomes provincial premier , replacing Bourassa .
