   <HEADLINE> TENNIS / ELLIOTT ALMOND ; ' STUPID SYSTEM ' BLAMED FOR NAVRATILOVA ' S DEFEAT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Reeling from the loss of Martina Navratilova in the third round of the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles , tournament director Jerry Diamond took_exception to the way women ' s tennis organizes its events . &quot; Martina lost to the system , the stupid system that requires players ( to ) play a 56 ( player ) draw because they want to make room for the 190th player in the world ( to ) make an $ 800 paycheck , &quot; said Diamond , a past director of the Women ' s Tennis Assn . &quot; It ' s crazy . It doesn ' t make any sense. &quot; Navratilova was by far the biggest draw_in Diamond ' s week-long event at the Manhattan Country_Club in Manhattan Beach . Adding_to the lure was her impending retirement after the Virginia Slims Championships in New York in November . As an eight-time winner of the tournament , Navratilova was hoping to say_farewell to Los Angeles in_style by reaching today ' s final . Instead , after playing almost five hours of grueling tennis Wednesday night -- she had a three-set singles victory and then played doubles -- she returned to the court Thursday afternoon exhausted . Navratilova , 37 , lost in three sets to No . 46 Ann Grossman . With a 56-player draw , the top players must compete five days during the week if they reach the final . Diamond said if they reduced the draw to 28 , the sport ' s stars would have a better chance to recover during the week . The lesser-ranked players would still have a chance because the qualifying field would be expanded to include all 56 . And tournament directors would not be left with a weakened field for the semifinals . &quot; You ' re killing the top players , &quot; Diamond said . Mike Davies , general_manager of the International Tennis Federation in London , said no system will please everyone . &quot; Obviously , if you give the top players a bye , they have one less match to play and they are protected a little bit , &quot; he said . There are other reasons to keep the field at 56 for the Tour ' s Tier 1 ( $ 750 # 000 ) and Tier 2 ( $ 400 # 000 ) events . The tournaments are scheduled when a maximum number of players want to compete , said Ann Person Worcester , managing director of the Women ' s Tennis Council in New York . With the U.S. Open two weeks away , all players want the chance to hone their skills against the best competition possible . &quot; ( Also ) we have about 500 players on the computer ( rankings ) , &quot; Worcester said . &quot; So , giving 56 players jobs is kind of a minimum. &quot; Diamond suggests the sport is run_by the &quot; also-rans &quot; who want to play every week because they lose in the first or second rounds . For them , fatigue is not a factor . &quot; They don ' t care because they get a paycheck every week , &quot; he said . &quot; But the sport can ' t support that many players . It is ridiculous to have anybody in this tournament ranked above 125. &quot; Diamond had 15 . No . 159 , Mercedes Paz of Argentina , a member of the Women ' s Tennis Assn . board of directors , dismissed such sentiment . She said today ' s tour is so competitive , the lower-ranked players deserve berths . Indeed , when Grossman defeats Navratilova one day and Amy Frazier upsets No . 3 Conchita Martinez the next , as was the case in Los Angeles , it does appear the competition is tightening . &quot; The players here , they don ' t want to play_on the farm_clubs , &quot; said Diamond , who thinks a minor_league system is needed . &quot; They want the big-time right now . You tell them they are not good_enough for the big-time , they say , ' Well , I know , but I want a shot at it. ' &quot; And because of that , Diamond says , the fans lose . &quot; Now the people who bought tickets for the weekend are cheated out of seeing Martina because she had to play two nights in a row and she ran_out of steam , &quot; Diamond said . &quot; Does that benefit the sport ? &quot; It is a question that needs to be addressed . * In an effort to make the game more relevant , the ATP recently passed several measures to speed_up play and allow more fan involvement . Not all_the players are receptive to the changes . &quot; If they want to make_it more attractive , have nude girls on the tennis_court , &quot; Boris Becker said . The most controversial rule reduces the time between points from 25 to 20 seconds . &quot; I was thinking so_much about the ( 20 ) seconds that I couldn ' t think_about the serve , &quot; Becker said of his play_at the recent Los Angeles Open . Top-ranked Pete Sampras was not so concerned . He said in a statement , &quot; I think that there is too_much toweling off and there are too many other delays. &quot; In another change , spectators will be allowed to react during points , as long as they do not intend to distract players . Andre Agassi , a crowd favorite , welcomes the participation . &quot; I think giving the crowd a little bit more freedom to support the players they want to support or cheer against the players they don ' t like is what sports is all about , &quot; Agassi said . Also , spectators seated above the lowest tier of seats near the court will be allowed to move freely in and out of the stadium during play . Chair umpires will no longer delay play for spectator movement in the upper tier , unless it is meant to distract players . &quot; To take 15 extra seconds waiting to serve because somebody is not seated straight up and down in their chair is a little bit ridiculous , &quot; Agassi said . * With a dearth of stars on the women ' s tour , and no sponsor for next season , the sport seems to be going_through a transition . But as Navratilova retires and Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati remain on the sidelines , others are filling the void . As evidenced at the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles , dramatic , entertaining tennis still is being played . The names simply might not be recognizable . &quot; It ' s just that the young players are going_to have to realize they have to take_over and control the sport that they get money from , &quot; said Zina Garrison-Jackson , who at 32 is nearing the end of her career . &quot; They have to understand that it ' s not just about being_on the court , that you have to do things you don ' t want to do. &quot; She said such players as Mary Joe Fernandez , Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Conchita Martinez must emerge as the next generation of personalities .
