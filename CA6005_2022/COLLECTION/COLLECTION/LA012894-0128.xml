   <HEADLINE> HARDING KNEW DETAILS OF ATTACK LATER , KEPT SILENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tears welling in her eyes and her lips quivering , Tonya Harding confessed Thursday that she knew about the plot to attack rival Nancy Kerrigan after the fact and did not report it to police . But Harding steadfastly said she was not involved and knew_nothing of the assault beforehand . She pleaded , all but begged to remain on the U.S. Olympic team . &quot; I have devoted my entire life to one objective : winning an Olympic gold medal for my country . This is my last chance . I ask only for your understanding. &quot; However , the U.S. Olympic Committee issued a statement later saying it was &quot; deeply concerned &quot; about Harding ' s admission , and the U.S. Figure_Skating Assn . said it formed a five-member committee to investigate . The 23-year-old Harding , the U.S. national women ' s figure_skating champion , ended her long , self-imposed silence about the strange case , reading a prepared statement slowly and emotionally to reporters at the Multnomah Athletic Club in downtown Portland . It ran counter to her previous denials in which she said she was completely innocent . &quot; I had no prior knowledge of the planned assault on Nancy Kerrigan . I am responsible , however , for failing to report things I learned about the assault when I returned home &quot; on Jan . 10 from the U.S. figure_skating championships in Detroit . Kerrigan was attacked Jan . 6 . &quot; Within the next few days , I learned that some persons that were close to me may have been involved in the assault . . . . I have since reported this information to the authorities . Although my lawyers tell me that my failure to immediately report this information is not a crime , I know I have let you down , but I have also let myself down. &quot; Harding expressed sorrow for what happened to Kerrigan and described herself as &quot; embarrassed and ashamed that anyone close to me could be involved. &quot; &quot; Many of you will be unable to forgive me for that , &quot; she said . &quot; It will be difficult to forgive myself. &quot; Harding gave no accounting of exactly what information she kept secret about the attack and neither did she identify those close to her who allegedly were involved . * As Harding made her statement , her ex-husband , Jeff Gillooly , was across town at the office of the FBI , undergoing his second day of questioning by investigators . The two have had a stormy , seven-year relationship , including a divorce last August and a reconciliation that was broken_off last week hours before Gillooly , 26 , became the fourth man arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit second-degree assault in the case . The crime is a felony that carries a sentence of up_to three years in prison . Reports have been intensifying in the last two days that Harding herself would be charged in the case . The ( Portland ) Oregonian newspaper said a criminal complaint was &quot; virtually certain. &quot; The newspaper said in its early editions today that Harding initially lied to FBI investigators for several hours when questioned last week , saying she knew_nothing of the plot . But she reportedly changed her story when challenged , amended her statements and implicated Gillooly , who was arrested the next day , sources told the newspaper . Giving false information to the FBI is a crime . An FBI spokesman said he could not comment on the Oregonian report . Legal experts said it was not a crime in Oregon , as in most states , to know of a crime and not report it . But it is unlawful to assist in trying to cover_up a criminal act . The U.S. Figure_Skating Assn . said Thursday that it will submit Harding ' s name to the U.S. Olympic Committee as a member of the team that will compete in the Feb . 12-27 Winter Games in Lillehammer , Norway . But , at_the_same_time , the USFSA revealed that it has begun the process that could result in her removal from the team . The first_step in learning Harding ' s Olympic fate will be next Tuesday when the USFSA hearing panel meets in Colorado Springs , Colo . Association rules allow Harding 30 days before she must appear at a hearing to respond to the panel ' s recommendations . Because that process might not be completed before the end of the Winter_Olympics , the USOC could be required to rule on Harding ' s status . USOC officials said that Harding ' s name will be forwarded to the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee as a member of the U.S. team before Monday ' s deadline , but the list of entries for the women ' s figure_skating competition also will include alternates . The USOC has until Feb . 21 , two days before the women ' s competition begins , to name the two skaters who will participate . The first alternate , because of her second-place finish behind Harding in the recent national championships , is 13-year-old Michelle Kwan of Torrance , Calif . Harvey Schiller , executive_director of the USOC , said the organization is &quot; deeply concerned with statements made . . . by Tonya Harding relative to her stated knowledge of the attack on Nancy Kerrigan at the national championships. &quot; &quot; The United States Olympic Committee is prepared under constitutional procedures to initiate any action deemed appropriate relative to the conduct of any athlete entered in the Games , &quot; Schiller said . According to the USOC ' s code_of_conduct , it can take action against any member of the U.S. delegation to the Olympics whose behavior does not &quot; bring credit and honor to yourself , your teammates , your national governing body , the United States Olympic Committee and the United States of America. &quot; USFSA and USOC officials , who did not want to be identified , said that Harding could be found in violation of the USOC ' s code_of_conduct as a result of her comments Thursday . &quot; I think this is what we ' ve been looking_for in trying to decide whether she belongs on the team , &quot; one said . &quot; Even if she is not charged with anything , you can certainly argue that she did not behave ethically or according to the tenets of good sportsmanship. &quot; Kerrigan was hit above her right knee the day before the figure_skating championships and was unable to compete . The FBI has disclosed that it briefly investigated whether Kerrigan herself arranged the attack to spare herself from competing , but attention soon shifted to Portland when Harding ' s onetime bodyguard began talking to others about his role in arranging the &quot; hit. &quot; Harding said her resulting victory in Detroit was &quot; unfulfilling without the challenge of skating against Nancy. &quot; After failing to disclose what she knew , Harding said she subsequently told authorities everything . &quot; I still want to represent my country in Lillehammer , Norway , next month , &quot; she said . &quot; Despite my mistakes and my rough edges , I have done nothing to violate the standards of excellence , of sportsmanship that are expected in an Olympic athlete . &quot; Nancy Kerrigan and I can show the world two different types of figure_skating , &quot; Harding said . &quot; I look_forward to being_on the team with her. &quot; As she described the sequence of events , Harding returned from Detroit &quot; exhausted but still focused_on the national championships. &quot; &quot; Within the next few days , I learned that some persons that were close to me may have been involved in the assault . My first reaction was one of disbelief , and the disbelief was followed by shock and fear. &quot; * Earlier Thursday , Harding continued her daily practice_sessions , but spent less than a half-hour on the ice . She took one fall that left her holding her back in pain . Previously arrested in the case were the so-called bodyguard Shawn Eckardt , 26 ; suspected hit_man Shane Stant , 22 , and the suspected getaway driver , Derrick Smith , 29 . According to a sheriff ' s affidavit , authorities believe Gillooly paid Eckardt $ 3 # 500 to arrange the attack . Investigators traced Stant ' s movements first to Boston , where Kerrigan practiced for the nationals , and then to Detroit . Authorities say Eckardt , Stant and Smith all confessed . The case is now before a grand_jury , where the arrests must be backed_up by an indictment . A Feb . 3 deadline faces the grand_jury , but that could be extended_to Feb . 18 . Balzar reported from Portland and Harvey from Los Angeles .</TEXT>
