   <HEADLINE> SOLZHENITSYN HEADS_HOME TO WRITE RUSSIA ' S WRONGS ; CULTURE : DISSIDENT AUTHOR FACES UNEASY HOMECOMING IN A LAND CAUGHT IN A PAINFUL POST-SOVIET REBIRTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The newest estate on a bluff over the Moscow River is an imposing red brick dacha with two stories , two wings and a high green fence secluding its 10 pine-shaded acres . From the outside , it looks worthy of the great man who plans to spend his final years here . Alexander I . Solzhenitsyn , the dissident writer who exposed and outlasted his Soviet tormentors , is returning home next Friday after 20 years in exile to rediscover his beloved Russia and offer his wisdom to help guide its painful post-Communist rebirth . But before he can weigh in on such issues as the gulf between Russia ' s rich and poor , the grip of organized_crime , the spread of Western consumer culture and the specter of fascism , he faces an irritating little problem right under his new doorstep . The basement leaks . In his first lesson about the new Russia , Solzhenitsyn has fallen victim to the capitalist version of an old Soviet problem -- khaltura , or shoddy workmanship . As often happens here , the author did not have a contract and the architect refused to do_it over for free . The affront may be trifling compared to Solzhenitsyn ' s eight-year imprisonment in Josef Stalin ' s gulag and expulsion by Leonid I . Brezhnev ' s KGB , but it is just one sign that the 75-year-old sage is in_for an uneasy homecoming . Apart from the trials of daily life , he returns as a controversial figure . Many Russians look_forward to the reunion ; students born after he left are even writing essays anticipating it . Older people say they ' ve longed for a moral leader of his stature since the death of fellow dissident and Nobel-winning physicist Andrei D . Sakharov in 1989 . Politicians across the spectrum are poised to pounce on his every word as proof of their version of the truth . But some Russians curse Solzhenitsyn and his writings as a destroyer of an old order they miss . Others say he may be returning too late to shape the new one . In a country changing so quickly and seemingly so adrift , many Russians ask , What difference can any great artist or prophet make ? &quot; He doesn ' t have a real understanding of the country he ' s coming_back to , &quot; says Mikhail Y . Shvydkoi , Russia ' s deputy culture minister . &quot; Perhaps this is because people who live_in this country don ' t have a real understanding of it either. &quot; Some are simply afraid for him . Mail from friends in Russia is running 9 to 1 against his return , according to his wife , Natalia . &quot; They are saying it ' s a terrible situation now , &quot; she reports . &quot; Don ' t go . You are very valuable for Russia , but you won ' t be safe. &quot; But Solzhenitsyn , who settled with his wife , mother-in-law and three sons in Cavendish , Vt. , in 1976 , has been planning his return for three years since finishing &quot; The Red Wheel , &quot; an epic history of Russia on the eve of the 1917 Revolution . His citizenship , stripped away by the Soviet regime , was restored in 1990 . Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin phoned two years later with a personal_appeal to come_home . Shvydkoi says the government plans &quot; a very honorable ceremony. &quot; Mindful of his preference for rural surroundings , Moscow ' s city government last year gave Solzhenitsyn land use rights here on the western outskirts of the capital , the &quot; dachaland &quot; of past and present Kremlin elites . It also sold him the buildings on the 10-acre property , which originally belonged_to a Stalinist henchman named Lazar Kaganovich . The Solzhenitsyns had the old house torn_down and a new one built at their own expense . One of the two wings will be the family ' s living quarters , the other a workplace and repository of the author ' s extensive library and archives , which will be open_to researchers . As the family began packing in Vermont last winter , plans to finish the house this spring went awry . Snowfall on the roof turned_to ice , widened the seams between the copper tiles and melted into the house when the heating_system came_on . More water leaked into the basement from a poorly insulated outdoor porch . &quot; It was a disaster , &quot; says Mrs . Solzhenitsyn , who came_to Moscow to clean_up . She replaced the architect and the roof , then halted all other work , leaving the basement to be repaired this summer . &quot; The house is only walls and roof now , &quot; she told The Times in a telephone_interview from Vermont . &quot; There ' s nothing inside , not even a floor . . . . We decided it was impossible to continue the work until we live_in Russia . People take_advantage . You have to be around. &quot; Until the house is ready , the family will live_on Moscow ' s Plyushchikha Street in a five-room apartment that Mrs . Solzhenitsyn bought two years ago . She says her husband will spend much of the summer traveling around Russia &quot; meeting lots of people and listening to them about life today , &quot; then start writing short_stories and playing &quot; some role as a public figure &quot; outside politics . &quot; He won ' t recognize the country when he comes_back , &quot; says Irina Nefedyeva , a 35-year-old teacher , as she shopped on Plyushchikha the other day . &quot; Everything is changing , but it ' s hard to say in which direction. &quot; Along the street , a Russian Orthodox church closed by the Communists has reopened , but a textile plant is struggling , and two bakeries have closed . To eke_out a profit , a tiny food_shop also sells Japanese-made TV_sets and VCRs . The newest store specializes in American car accessories . A lot of what the author disdains as &quot; squalid mass_culture &quot; from the West -- novelized versions of the Charles Bronson movie &quot; Death Wish , &quot; an Italian TV series &quot; Octopus , &quot; a Mexican soap_opera &quot; Simply Maria &quot; -- is available at the neighborhood bookstore , which didn ' t bother reordering Solzhenitsyn ' s &quot; Gulag Archipelago &quot; and &quot; One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich &quot; when they ran_out a_few months ago . &quot; To put it mildly , Solzhenitsyn ' s books are not as popular now &quot; as when they were banned under the Soviet regime , says Alexandra V . Nezhikova , who works in the store . &quot; When there are none of his books for_sale , nobody asks_for them. &quot; Even some of Russia ' s intelligentsia admit having trouble staying awake with &quot; The Red Wheel. &quot; The political and cultural elite are far more interested in how Solzhenitsyn judges 1994 . Solzhenitsyn laid_out some of his views this month in an interview for Forbes magazine that was reprinted by the Russian newspaper Izvestia and found some common_ground with Communists and radical nationalists . For example , he suggested that Yeltsin was wrong to privatize farmland and is not adequately defending the rights of ethnic Russians in the former Soviet republics . He also warned that some Americans want to &quot; weaken Russia. &quot; Democratic reformers , who have long suspected Solzhenitsyn of autocratic instincts , reacted with fear that he will exert a reactionary influence on Yeltsin . For his part , Communist_Party leader Gennady A . Zyuganov sounds encouraged . &quot; He will come_back and he will not be happy at all with the picture unveiled before his eyes , &quot; Zyuganov says . &quot; We will gratefully accept his words of truth. &quot; Those inspired by Solzhenitsyn to fight the Communist regime say the most they expect of him now is to stay above the political fray and somehow make_it more civil . Lev Timofeev , 57 , a dissident jailed in the mid-1980s , credits the author with giving his generation &quot; the language of freedom. &quot; &quot; The most acute problem now is how to find a language of social accord , &quot; Timofeev says . &quot; When Yeltsin proclaims this , a great number of people dismiss it as a political trick . But if such an idea is proclaimed by Solzhenitsyn , that ' s absolutely another thing . I hope that Solzhenitsyn will create this new language. &quot; Russian literary figures of earlier eras -- Dostoevsky and Tolstoy under the czars , Pasternak under the Bolsheviks -- assumed such roles as public figures and moral critics . But they were present to witness the changes of their times for themselves . &quot; Solzhenitsyn ' s authority is weakened by his distance from events , &quot; says Benedict M . Sarnov , a leading Russian literary critic . &quot; He is counting_on being a guru , but I think he will be disappointed . I would advise him not to come_back . . . . What Russia needs now is not prophets but pragmatists. &quot; The debate echoes in Russian high_schools , where Solzhenitsyn ' s works are taught alongside those of Pushkin , Tolstoy , Gogol , Bulgakov and Dostoevsky . At School No . 1289 in Moscow , 11th graders say it ' s cool to throw around Solzhenitsyn ' s name , even if they don ' t actually read him or can ' t remember what gulag means . One classroom discussion turned_into a spirited argument between two 17-year-olds , Timofei Kiselev and Yelena Sayenko . Timofei : &quot; Why is Solzhenitsyn coming_back ? What can he do here ? We have a very unstable economic and political situation . The country is not ready to accept him. &quot; Yelena : &quot; We should accept him . He ' s a genius. &quot; Timofei : &quot; Sure , but what can he do about our economy ? &quot; Yelena : &quot; He can help us understand each other , to live_in peace. &quot; Timofei : &quot; Not now . Maybe in the future. &quot; Yelena : &quot; He ' ll be dead. &quot; Timofei : &quot; His books will always be around . But the country doesn ' t need him now . We need first of all not a good writer but good government , economic stability. &quot; Burdened by daily hardships , some Russians view Solzhenitsyn ' s return next week with a what ' s-in-it-for-me attitude , either cynical indifference or a naive expectation that it will improve their material lot . Hope is high among the modest villagers who live outside the fence around Solzhenitsyn ' s unfinished dacha . Relieved that it was the great writer and not some Mafioso or Kremlin big_shot moving_in , they are wondering whether he might get the neighborhood some gas heating or at least a sewage_system . &quot; We are looking_forward to meeting him and talking to him , &quot; says Viktor S . Strunkin , a 50-year-old radio mechanic , stopping on the muddy road by a garbage_dump 100 yards from Solzhenitsyn ' s gate . &quot; Maybe the authorities will remove this awful dump , &quot; he adds . &quot; Maybe they will pave this road . I can ' t imagine that Solzhenitsyn will love having a garbage_dump right under his nose. &quot;</TEXT>
