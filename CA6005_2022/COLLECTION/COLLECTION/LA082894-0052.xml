   <HEADLINE> WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; PHYLLIS GEORGE ENDS HER NINE-YEAR ' HIATUS ' TO PLAY TO HER STRENGTHS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> She ' s older . She ' s wiser . And this time around she could care less if the critics vote her Miss Congeniality . Phyllis George is back . The onetime Miss America , onetime sportscaster , onetime morning news_show host has returned to television after nine years . Although her first round with broadcasting was often plagued by controversy and criticism , this time she feels she ' s found her niche . &quot; A Phyllis George Special &quot; -- the first aired in June and a second airs Wednesday -- is a one-hour program featuring interviews with high-profile personalities , a format for which George feels well-suited . &quot; This kind of show is a show I ' ve wanted to do for many , many years , &quot; says George . &quot; I love people . It sounds so corny : ' I love people. ' But I genuinely do. &quot; The show resembles the highly rated Barbara Walters specials . George , who views Walters as a role_model , is flattered by any comparison . &quot; Well Barbara , of course , is the master . No one will ever compare to her . I mean that , &quot; George says . &quot; She has this incredible ability . I mean , people just want to pour their hearts out_to her . If I could achieve one-tenth of that I ' d be happy. &quot; During her stint on CBS as co-host of &quot; The NFL Today &quot; from 1975 until 1984 and as co-host of &quot; CBS Morning News &quot; for eight months in 1985 , George was regularly taken_to task by critics . She was a former Miss America , beautiful and energetic , but she didn ' t know sports and she didn ' t know news . &quot; ( Being Miss America ) has been a help and a hindrance , &quot; says George . &quot; It ' s been a help in that it ' s opened_doors . It ' s been a hindrance in that people immediately said ' BQ , ' you know , beauty queen . And you had to prove yourself more_than the next person. &quot; George cites Emmys garnered by &quot; The NFL Today &quot; as evidence that she mastered the sports interview . But success in the hard news arena proved more elusive . &quot; I was told I was hired to compete with ' Good_Morning America , ' &quot; says George . &quot; But then I got_in there and was thrust into hard news . ( CBS ) didn ' t play to my strengths. &quot; George ' s strengths , she contends , lie_in her softer , less aggressive interviewing style . &quot; I ' m Southern , &quot; she says . &quot; I don ' t look_at someone and say , ' I don ' t trust you . I ' m suspicious of you. ' that ' s not my nature or my personality . My style is easygoing and relaxed . Therefore , in an interview , I don ' t think someone ' s sitting there with their hackles up waiting for me to throw the next bomb . ( People ) feel comfortable talking to me . I think they can tell that I ' m genuinely interested in them . And I am . I figure if I ' m conversational , if I make someone feel comfortable , then they ' re going to tell me a lot of things they ' re not going_to tell Mike Wallace and Sam Donaldson. &quot; That style , George says , has already served her well on the new show , most notedly in her interview with President Clinton . &quot; I ' ve known the Clintons for years , &quot; says George . &quot; My husband ( John Y . Brown ) was governor ( of Kentucky ) when Bill was governor ( of Arkansas ) . They were freshmen governors together , so we ' ve had a friendship for a long_time . I think he felt comfortable talking with me about Chelsea -- ( my son ) Lincoln and Chelsea are the same age . But he also knew I wasn ' t going_to take that information and twist it and turn it . It was going_to be straight as he told it to me. &quot; In this month ' s installment , George interviews Kenny Rogers , Dallas Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman and former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback-turned Fox NFL play-by-play commentator Terry Bradshaw . George , who still lights_up a room with her Miss America good looks , doesn ' t characterize her return to television as a comeback , but rather , the end of a long hiatus . &quot; I never said I retired , &quot; says George , who while_away from television started a Chicken by George product_line in 1987 and later sold it to Hormel . &quot; I just said my priorities changed and I wanted to refocus and reorganize and regroup and recharge my battery. &quot; Whatever you call George ' s re-emergence , she feels the response has been positive . &quot; This show does suit my personality . I ' m not pretending to be something I ' m not . I mean , I can just be Phyllis . And it ' s interesting to find_out who you are_after 45 years. &quot; &quot; A Phyliss George Special &quot; airs Wednesday at 5 and 9 p.m. on TNN .</TEXT>
