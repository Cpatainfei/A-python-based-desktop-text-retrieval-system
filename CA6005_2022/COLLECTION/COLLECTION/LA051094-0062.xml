   <TEXT> As a concerned parent , I have noticed that the people who spread the malicious rumors and misinformation regarding our school district ' s sex education curriculum are also the same people who are now spreading the same type of distorted information concerning the CLAS examinations . Who are these people , anyway ? CHARLENE PIZZADILI Simi Valley * I am calling_on all you liberals out there to take a closer look_at the CLAS test . It is time for us to band_together with the conservatives who have good reason to be hopping mad . This whole deal sounds like a chapter out of Orwell ' s 1984 . It is more_than just the content of the stories , it is the questions . They are subjective and personally intrusive , designed to psychoanalyze the students , pick their brains , as it were . Names are_on the tests , along with the parents ' occupation ( which the elementary teachers are required to write in ) . In this manner , CLAS solicits permission from the students to use their answers somewhere else . For example , to give info to potential employers . They are not paying the students for this service . The students , who are minors , waive their rights without fully understanding them . The test scores are put_on a statewide database without the permission of the parents . Why has the state_Department of Education threatened teachers and administrators with pulling their credentials ? Why are the rights of parents and taxpayers being threatened ? This test costs millions . There are schools in need of textbooks , school supplies , computer equipment , more teachers and smaller classes , but there is no money for these necessities . There is an Assembly Bill 2637 and a Senate Bill 1788 that will extend parental rights as per Education Code 60650 beyond the Jan . 1 , 1995 , cutoff date . If these do not pass , that portion of the parental rights will be gone . The Senate Bill 1788 , in fact , has already been killed in committee by state Sen . Gary Hart . I urge you to contact your legislators to let them know how you feel about this legislation . Also , let your school_board know as soon as possible before it ' s too late .
