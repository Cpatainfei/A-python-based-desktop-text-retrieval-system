   <HEADLINE> THE NATURAL ; LAND USE : JOE EDMISTON IS THE CONSUMMATE DEAL-MAKER , PROCURING THOUSANDS OF ACRES FOR THE SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS CONSERVANCY . HE ' S ALSO DEVELOPED MANY ADMIRERS AND DETRACTORS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> First there were the sparse domestic budgets of the Reagan-Bush years . Then came the deficit-reduction fever of the Clinton_Administration . It hasn ' t been a picnic for those who would acquire public parkland , not even for a wheeler-dealer such_as Joseph T . Edmiston . But as the only executive_director of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy , the state agency created in 1980 to acquire parkland in the mountains , Edmiston has thrived . Indeed , he has gained a reputation as an aggressive and innovative parks advocate . Even his detractors acknowledge his remarkable success at expanding parklands during more_than a decade of tightfisted government spending and spiraling land prices . In his 14 years at the helm , the agency has managed -- often in jigsaw-puzzle fashion -- to buy , swap for or procure as donations 20 # 000 acres of private land in the spectacular mountain corridor that stretches from Griffith Park to Point Mugu in Ventura County . that ' s a land_area more_than half the size of San Francisco . When the task has demanded it , he has enlisted the support of powerful political allies , outsmarted fellow bureaucrats , struck deals with movie_stars and real_estate developers and charmed community and environmental leaders . &quot; Joe ' s record of accomplishment speaks_for itself , &quot; said Rep . Howard L . Berman ( D-Panorama City ) , a longtime ally who as a state legislator led the effort to establish the conservancy . Others , however , hold a different view . Edmiston is &quot; more interested in personal power than in conservation , &quot; declared Mary Weisbrock , whose group , Save Open Space , finds him too quick to compromise with developers . Still others say he can be ruthless and vindictive with those who dare cross him . &quot; Joe has a difficult time separating professional considerations from his own personal feelings , &quot; said Peter Ireland , who was forced_out of his job at the agency last year after butting heads with Edmiston . Bearded , baritone-voiced and armed with a lightning wit , Edmiston ' s powerful persona and zeal for deal-making has made him , to friend and foe alike , virtually indistinguishable from the agency he heads . &quot; Joe Edmiston is the conservancy , &quot; said Jerry Daniel , the agency ' s board chairman . &quot; Without Joe I sincerely believe that the organization would crumble to pieces. &quot; * Not surprisingly , Edmiston is the conservancy ' s key player as the agency prepares to take_on two potential make-or-break challenges this year . In June , voters will decide the fate of a $ 2-billion statewide bond initiative that would generate $ 132 million for the conservancy and its affiliates . It is no coincidence that the measure , sponsored by the California Planning and Conservation League , treats the conservancy generously . Edmiston helped draft it , as he did a similar measure sponsored by the same group and approved by voters in 1988 . This year ' s measure , known by the acronym CALPAW , would also make the agency permanently eligible to receive money from the state ' s General Fund and undertake land acquisition projects as far afield as the Whittier Hills and San Gabriel Mountains . While the June vote represents a potential boon for the conservancy , a second test threatens to be the agency ' s bane : Opponents in the state Legislature are pushing proposals to rein_in the agency . Several lawmakers , led by state Sen . Cathie Wright ( R-Simi Valley ) , object to the agency ' s tactics , particularly its controversial attempt to use eminent_domain to wrest 245 acres in the heart of the mountains from Soka University . They are considering legislation to force the conservancy to reimburse state bond funds with the money it gets for transferring parkland to the federal_government , no small_change considering the agency has reaped $ 35 million from the transfer of about 5 # 000 acres to the National_Park_Service in little more_than a decade . Conservancy supporters were stunned last month when state Sen . Dan McCorquodale ( D-Modesto ) , long counted among the agency ' s friends , joined Wright in criticizing it . &quot; We are constantly looking_at reinventing government , and at some point you may get reinvented , &quot; McCorquodale warned during a Senate oversight committee hearing . * At the center of the storm is Edmiston , 44 , who shrugs_off such attacks by saying they come_with the territory . &quot; I ' m the Sgt . York in the Jeep , &quot; he said . &quot; I provide a nice wide target to shoot at. &quot; A self-proclaimed workaholic who wears a wrist calculator to figure per-acre land prices , Edmiston has literally wheeled and dealed all_over the Santa Monica Mountains . Beginning in 1989 , he managed to torpedo an effort by the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts to put a garbage_dump in scenic Towsley Canyon near Santa Clarita , even though the landfill agency had already acquired an option on the property . Edmiston bought two small parcels , including one near the mouth of the canyon that provided the only feasible truck route between the landfill site and the Golden State Freeway . * Edmiston ' s critics , however , say his deal-making often comes at the environment ' s expense . &quot; In many of his deals the mountains are clearly the loser , &quot; said Siegfried Othmer , a Sherman Oaks activist who accuses Edmiston of doing the bidding of developers . Othmer cites two recent transactions . In Calabasas , the conservancy last year endorsed a luxury housing_development on 938 acres after the developer , Micor Venture , agreed to cluster the 250 houses it hopes to build_on the property and set_aside nearly 700 acres of the tract as public parkland . Opponents say it was a Faustian bargain , noting that the houses were to be built_in a pristine canyon that is an important wildlife habitat . They have filed suit to block the project . Also controversial was the conservancy ' s purchase last year of the 2 # 308-acre Jordan Ranch in Ventura County from entertainer Bob Hope . Part of a complicated land swap , it ranks as the conservancy ' s single largest land acquisition ever . Ultimately , the agency stands to acquire another 7 # 000 acres in the mountains owned by Hope and the Ahmanson Land Co . But the rest of the deal hinges_on whether Ahmanson and its partners proceed with plans to develop a $ 1-billion mini-city for 8 # 600 residents . In promoting the Hope land swap and the Calabasas development , Edmiston switched hats and acted_as a lobbyist for the builders before regulatory_agencies . He makes no apologies . &quot; I talk to developers because they ' re the ones who own the land , &quot; he said . &quot; If you aren ' t willing to be pragmatic , you ' re nowhere in ( the parks procurement ) business , which some people have a difficult time understanding. &quot; * Edmiston is proud_of the Bob Hope deal , commemorated by the deed to Jordan Ranch framed on his Malibu office wall . As befits a man who sees parkland preservation in strategic terms , his office bookshelves are crammed with volumes dealing with the tactics and strategy of warfare . During an interview , Ruth Kilday , the head of the Mountains Conservancy Foundation , which works closely with the conservancy , stopped by to deliver a framed photo as a gift . The photograph depicts Edmiston ' s latest triumph , Barbra Streisand ' s 24-acre Malibu estate , which the entertainer recently donated to the conservancy for use as a conservation research_center . But even such a gift carries a price . Streisand ' s Ramirez Canyon neighbors have already begun to fret about the traffic the center may generate . Edmiston has suggested a road could be built to bypass that enclave , a notion that hasn ' t played well with some environmentalists . Critics also complain that Edmiston oversteps his authority . Earlier this month he was accused of lobbying against the appointment of Ireland , his former subordinate , as Los Angeles ' representative to the conservancy board . Despite an early overture to Ireland , Mayor Richard Riordan appointed actor Ed Begley Jr . Edmiston declined to comment on the Ireland matter . Edmiston lives in Santa Monica with his wife , Pepper , and their seven children . His wife , the founder of a camp program for children , is the daughter of Beverly Hills Mayor Max Salter . He grew_up in East Los Angeles , an only child whose parents exhibited a keen interest in local politics and environmental causes . His father , an engineer who invented a machine used in canning fruit , and his mother , whom he described as an &quot; activist housewife , &quot; shared a passion for the outdoors . Edmiston was a student at West Los Angeles School_of_Law in the early 1970s when he realized he wanted to be a conservationist . He had earlier graduated from USC , which he attended on a debate scholarship . He abandoned law_school , at age 24 , when he was offered a $ 500-a-month job as a Sierra Club lobbyist in Sacramento . &quot; My job was to preach to the heathen ( s ) , &quot; he said of his four years spent promoting environmental legislation , including the bill that established the California Coastal Commission . By 1977 he had caught the attention of then-Gov . Jerry Brown , who appointed him to the Santa Monica Mountains Comprehensive Planning_Commission , the conservancy ' s forerunner . The post made him the logical choice for his current job . He earns $ 65 # 000 a year . * His agency works closely with the National_Park_Service and the state park system to acquire parkland . It receives little directly from the state -- less than $ 150 # 000 this fiscal_year . Neither has it been able to count_on much help from the federal_government . For several years in the early 1980s the Reagan_Administration eliminated acquisition funds for local parks . This year , the agency ' s administrative budget , including salaries for its 11-member staff , is $ 650 # 000 . Typically , the conservancy finances the purchase of a given piece of parkland , sells it to state parks or to the federal_government for inclusion in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area , and uses the proceeds to obtain more land . It does so through a variety of innovative means , which observers credit largely to Edmiston . The agency often intervenes to snatch_up land as it comes_on the market , without waiting for the federal_government to complete the often cumbersome process of appropriating money . Park enthusiasts say the practice has preserved thousands of acres that may have fallen to development . But with deficit-cutting the watchword these days in Washington , there are few federal dollars to go_around . For the current fiscal_year , the Clinton_Administration allocated $ 4.5 million for land acquisition in the Santa Monicas , compared to $ 11.5 million during the last year of the Bush presidency . Over the years , the lion ' s share of the conservancy ' s money -- nearly $ 100 million in all -- has come from a series of voter-approved state and local bond measures . Proposition 117 , commonly known as the Mountain_Lion Initiative , netted the agency $ 50 million in 1990 , while Proposition A , approved by Los Angeles County voters in 1992 , brought_in another $ 40 million . To subsidize the meager sum provided directly by the state for staff and office expenses , the conservancy must rely_on interest it earns from unspent bond money . As a result , it seems almost always strapped for cash . That could change in a hurry with passage of the June ballot measure . The measure would provide $ 132 million , more_than doubling the bond funds the agency and its affiliates have received to date . The conservancy ' s legislative problems may_not be solved as easily . Supporters insist that the agency ' s troubles with lawmakers stem from the dispute over Tokyo-based Soka University ' s property . Parks enthusiasts , including National_Park_Service officials , have long coveted the 245-acre campus -- on the site of the former King Gillette Ranch -- as the ideal spot for a visitor center and park headquarters for the national recreation area . The conservancy , through one of its affiliated agencies , took the unprecedented step of instituting condemnation proceedings last year after the university rejected a bid to buy the property for more_than $ 19 million . Soka , which operates a language_school for about 100 international students at the site , wants to build a 3 # 400-student liberal arts college there . Parks enthusiasts view the site , located in a valley at the foot of dramatic peaks in the Santa Monicas , as vital to the decades-long effort to piece together an expansive mountain park . The university , meanwhile , has hired powerful lobbyists to protect its interests in Washington and Sacramento , with impressive results . Soka ' s influence could be seen in this year ' s federal appropriation for Santa Monica Mountains land acquisition . The measure ' s language precluded any of the funds being used to procure the campus . Fearing that Soka might throw its considerable weight behind a campaign to defeat the measure , sponsors of the June ballot initiative also inserted a provision to restrict the conservancy from using any of the proceeds to buy Soka property . The agency ' s backers , meanwhile , say they expect a full-scale assault in the Legislature this year from lawmakers sympathetic to Soka to either abolish or cripple the conservancy . &quot; Soka is a very powerful organization with lots of money that it spends in abundance in lobbying in Washington and Sacramento , &quot; said Assemblyman Terry B . Friedman ( D-Brentwood ) , a close friend of Edmiston . &quot; I think it poses a grave threat to the conservancy. &quot; Soka spokesman Jeff Ourvan denies that the university is out_to get the conservancy , although he does not disguise his ire at the agency and its executive_director . &quot; Joe Edmiston fancies himself as the William Mulholland of the 1990s , &quot; Ourvan said . &quot; But where Mulholland brought water as an essential resource to Southern California , Edmiston ' s mission is a park headquarters , which is hardly vital to people of the region. &quot; Edmiston , who realizes the months ahead may be the bumpiest yet for his agency , manages to project an appearance of calm . Some associates , however , speculate he may have tired_of the job and would welcome a change . He may have signaled as much last year , when he applied -- unsuccessfully -- to be director of the National_Park_Service . Edmiston , uncomfortable discussing his personal ambitions , said he wishes he had gotten the park service post . He insists , however , that he is not looking_to bail_out of the conservancy as it enters a politically turbulent period . &quot; I love what I do. &quot; Joe Edmiston ' s Mountain Kingdom Executive_director of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy since 1980 , has led the agency ' s effort to create a comprehensive park system in the Santa Monicas .
