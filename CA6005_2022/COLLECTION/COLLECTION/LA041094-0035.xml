   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; WOMEN ROCKERS -- THE SOUND AND THE FURY ; WHY FEMALE ARTISTS ARE FINALLY SMASHING THE NARROW CONFINES PREVIOUSLY SET FOR WOMEN IN ROCK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; I wanna be mesmerizing , too , &quot; sings Liz Phair in a declaration that symbolizes the ambitions of a new generation of women who have finally gained respect in male-dominated rock ' n ' roll . Phair ' s line is from her debut album , &quot; Exile in Guyville , &quot; which was named the best album of 1993 in a poll of the nation ' s pop_music critics -- defeating such young male rock giants as Nirvana and Pearl Jam . Worlds away from Phair ' s folk-accented rock , the similarly acclaimed PJ Harvey unleashes cathartic torrents of flailing emotion that baffle MTV ' s Beavis and Butt-head . &quot; This chick ' s weird , &quot; comments Butt-head , just before Harvey unleashes another guttural growl in the video for her song &quot; 50-Ft . Queenie. &quot; Her lyrics about menstruation and the power struggles of sex blend with her oddball dress -- everything from ' 50s-style bikinis to sequins and boas to a simple wrap of cellophane . Sharing the critical limelight with Phair and Harvey are the Breeders , an Ohio-based quartet that doesn ' t deal in confessional or cathartic works , but in an impressionistic , groove-conscious rock that is more likely to make Butt-head twist his tiny hips than drop his jaw . Though there have been women stars before in mainstream rock , they always seemed isolated figures cast in a strictly defined , specialized role : from the blues-mama force of Janis Joplin in the ' 60s to the poetic folk sentiments of Joni Mitchell in the ' 70s to the giddy exuberance of Cyndi Lauper in the ' 80s . But it ' s a different story today . The critical breakthroughs of Phair and the others are noteworthy because they -- and dozens of other new female artists -- are smashing the narrow confines previously set for women in rock . The roles of disco diva , stealth seductress or rocker tomboy -- which correspond with the roles of Madonna , whore or girl next door -- don ' t even begin to cover the diverse appeal of today ' s multidimensional artists . Women now can shun those ghettos , which stifled predecessors who might have had ideas just as creative . As a result , female artists making more challenging music have infiltrated rock from every angle , representing the many facets of_their_own personalities . They ' re coming_in as individuals , and winning points for it . &quot; It used to be as if female was a genre in itself -- ( whether ) it was blues , rock or dance , &quot; says Nancy Jeffries , senior_vice_president of artist relations at Elektra Records . &quot; When I first started_out in this business ( in the late ' 70s ) , certain people at labels would say , ' Oh , we can ' t sign any more females because we already have three , ' and each of those women would be doing something entirely different . It was a perception that if you had X number of females , you had enough . Now , I don ' t hear the percents. &quot; Evelyn McDonnell , a New York-based rock critic and a founding member of Strong Women in Music ( SWIM ) , an activist group supporting women on all music-industry levels , agrees . &quot; All these intelligent , strong , different women couldn ' t be squeezed into these molds , and popped_out on_their_own , &quot; she says . &quot; They ' re doing harder , more thoughtful and weirder music. &quot; The new female bands , which now number in the hundreds , are climbing_up the scales of commercial success . The pat sound of Whitney Houston still outsells groups like the Breeders , but the sheer number of bands and the strong critical support shows record companies that the parameters are changing . Independent labels have been more responsive in signing women at the start of the ' 90s , and are responsible_for supporting a number of unorthodox women artists , including &quot; riot grrrl &quot; leaders Bikini Kill . The band was able to spawn a whole underground movement of radical feminism through a homemade fanzine and the tiny K label in Washington state . But major labels , which have picked_up acts such_as Nirvana from small labels , are catching_on . Following Hole ' s earlier move from Caroline to Geffen , 7 Year Bitch has just gone from tiny C / Z to Atlantic Records and Babes in Toyland from Twin / Tone to Warner Bros. , among others . &quot; The Breeders are up over 800 # 000 ( sales ) , and that signals a positive commercial response , &quot; Jeffries says . &quot; The public reaction is definitely reflected in sales , and they ' re increasing. &quot; The number of women artists alone now is too great to pass_off as some hype or fad . Among the ' 90s contenders and their competing musical styles : the experimental hip-hop mutations of Luscious Jackson , the crushing rock of 7 Year Bitch , the surreal lilts and growls of Bjork , the trance hum of Stereolab , the gruff pop of Hole . Others include Come , Scrawl , Tara Key , Cranberries , Me ' Shell NdegeOcello , L7 , Juliana Hatfield , Belly , Tori Amos , Spinanes , th Faith Healers , Ethyl Meatplow , Bratmobile , Sarah McLachlan , Kristin Hersh , Melissa Ferrick , Frente , the Muffs , Shonen Knife and Curve , not to mention hip-hop ' s Queen Latifah , Salt-N-Pepa and Yo-Yo . Courtney Love , singer and guitarist of Hole says , &quot; There ' s more baby-boomer and hippie children -- like , I ' m one -- who are going_to play more instruments . So this is just to be expected and it ' s gonna happen more and more. &quot; Not only will more women continue to infiltrate rock , Liz Phair predicted in a Times interview last year , but they ' ll be coming_in from even fresher angles . &quot; I bet you a_million bucks you ' re going to see more women doing_it in offbeat ways , more so than men . I think that women are gonna find since there is no history , they can kind of rewrite it. &quot; * Names like the Runaways , Janis Joplin , Patti Smith , Chrissie Hynde , X , Sonic Youth , the Raincoats , the Slits , X-Ray Specs and Bush Tetras will come_up when asking women ( and men ) about their influences . But considering that rock has been thriving for nearly four decades now , that ' s a short_list . While the presence of strong women in rock in the ' 60s and early ' 70s was minimal , the late ' 70s found Patti Smith and the rise of punk_rock to be more inviting to women , spawning such offbeat artists as Lydia Lunch , Siouxie Sioux , Alice Bag and Exene Cervenka . But one of the ' 80s ' key underground movements , hard-core , largely excluded women from its testosterone-drenched stages . The more commercial &quot; new_wave &quot; scene welcomed women -- if they were willing to fill goofy roles , as Cyndi Lauper did_in &quot; Girls Just Want to Have Fun &quot; or Toni Basil with &quot; Mickey. &quot; The encroachment of spandex hard-rock was worse , using females as video-images sprawled half-naked on top of Lamborghinis . But the ' 90s brought reactions against the preceding decade in the form of Babes in Toyland and Hole . They screamed full-bore , with no heed to prettiness or melody , kicking_off the current slew of outspoken and daring bands . &quot; This was inevitable , &quot; says Selene Vigil , lead singer for Seattle ' s 7 Year Bitch , about today ' s wave of female bands . &quot; Women aren ' t putting_up with it anymore and they ' re stepping_out . They ' re not doing what they should be doing , but rather what they want to do. &quot; Jeffries puts it on an even broader sociological level . &quot; It ' s changing but it ' s a matter of evolution . This is a worldwide , cultural , evolutionary thing because the suppression of women has been so historically universal . This is the musicians ' expression of this particular period of human evolution. &quot; If there is one common_factor other_than gender between these bands , it ' s that they are offering a new viewpoint toward rock . &quot; In general , women see the world differently than men , and we ' re not all_the same , &quot; says Jill Cunniff , 27 , who shares the duties of producing , singing , and playing everything from bass to keyboard with the rest of the New York-based group Luscious Jackson . &quot; Because we haven ' t been in a position of power in society , women have a really different perspective . It ' s a lot more sensitive . &quot; Honest female expression in any art_form is refreshing because before it was usually filtered through men : ' This one ' s OK , this one isn ' t. ' Women just look_at things in less constricted ways and ignore genre boundaries . They are contributing a more fluid element to rock , and that ' s a good thing. &quot; &quot; I think women are contributing songs that are based in real_life in an artistic way , &quot; says McDonnell , who alongside her involvement in SWIM is currently working_on a book chronicling rock criticism by women . &quot; These people are articulating their own thoughts and emotions when so_much of alternative and pop is just ironic and obtuse. &quot; Adds Vigil : &quot; It gives rock a little more emotion . That whole bad boy , rock ' n ' roll image -- there are girls that are as nasty as the boys , but with the Breeders and PJ Harvey , the music ' s good and powerful , and there ' s a lot more of an emotional quality to it. &quot; With more lyrical and musical honesty comes a more individualized look . Instead of men dressing_up women to sell records , women have taken_control of_their_own images and are marketing themselves more accurately . &quot; In the old days , everyone was so concerned with , ' What are they wearing ? ' &quot; says Jeffries . &quot; They all had to have a stylist . Now , everybody comes_in as who they are. &quot; &quot; Women are not trying to be a formulated Motown thing , &quot; Vigil explains , &quot; with whipped-up hairdos and tight dresses . They ' re doing their own thing and don ' t feel they have to be a Barbie doll or have a rock slut image. &quot; While women are appearing more as themselves , McDonnell sees it causing confusion elsewhere in the industry . &quot; PJ Harvey ' s album could have done a lot better , but I just don ' t think people know how to market a women like this. &quot; There is still a lot of progress_to be made if PJ Harvey , or her peers , are to be accepted by their record companies , let alone a larger audience . &quot; I don ' t want to over-romanticize how well things are , &quot; warns McDonnell , &quot; because most of these artists are not selling as much as the guys . Sexism is so entrenched in all levels of the industry , I still think there are gut reactions that are afraid of seeing women voice certain things , that are resistant to it. &quot; There ' s a certain kickback that can also be expected by men and women threatened by the increasing power of women -- in rock , and otherwise . &quot; We get flak all_the time , &quot; says Vigil , whose band plays an ultra-aggressive form of rock with brazen lyrics . &quot; People can accept seeing an angry man a lot quicker than they can seeing an angry woman . It ' s like , ' These women must really hate men , ' but do you ever hear that about an all-male band who rags about some girl in their song ? &quot; Cunniff says , &quot; I like funky beats , I like to dance and I like to hear inspirational lyrics that don ' t degrade me , so I ' m really happy when women like our music . It ' s like a bonding thing that men can enjoy too. &quot;</TEXT>
