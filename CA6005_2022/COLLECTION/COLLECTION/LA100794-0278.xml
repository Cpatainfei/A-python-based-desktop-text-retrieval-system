   <HEADLINE> FIRM SAYS IT IS NOT TO BLAME ON SUBWAY JOB ; TUNNELS : PARSONS-DILLINGHAM CLAIMS THAT IT IS BEING MADE A SCAPEGOAT AND THAT SHEA-KIEWIT-KENNY INTENTIONALLY CONCEALED CONSTRUCTION FLAWS FROM THE INSPECTION FIRM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The assigning of blame for construction problems that have shut_down subway excavation in Hollywood intensified Thursday , as the firm paid to inspect the work accused the tunneling contractor of deliberately hiding defective work . The allegation was leveled by an official representing the inspection firm Parsons-Dillingham , which itself is under_fire for its role in not catching substandard construction . In a related development , the chief_executive_officer of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said he will immediately refer the allegation against the tunnel contractor , Shea-Kiewit-Kenny , to the MTA ' s inspector_general . Ray W . Judson , assistant to the chairman of Pasadena-based Parsons Corp. , parent of Parsons-Dillingham , said in a statement that the inspection firm is unfairly being made a &quot; scapegoat &quot; for the subway project ' s problems . Parsons-Dillingham and its earlier affiliated inspection firms have received about $ 260 million for inspecting work_on the subway project . Tunneling has been shut_down along Hollywood Boulevard since Aug . 18 . Engineers have said the failure of wood bracing helped cause surface sinkages . Judson accused Shea-Kiewit-Kenny of hiding improper installation of filler material surrounding the wood wedge braces , which project engineers approved as substitutes for metal struts . The wedges , placed in expansion gaps of the outer tunnel shell , are supposed to be surrounded by high-strength concrete or grout . Judson said : &quot; As a result of the sinking along Hollywood Boulevard , which exposed the wedges and dry packing , P-D now believes that ( Shea-Kiewit-Kenny ) deliberately and willfully covered_up nonconforming work . &quot; The improper filling of the expansion gaps on the Hollywood tunnel project was not identified by P-D because the filling material was covered over by ( Shea-Kiewit-Kenny ) , &quot; Judson said . Representatives of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny did not return calls seeking comment . They have said in the past that the company ' s contract requires it to refer all media inquiries to Parsons-Dillingham . Franklin E . White , MTA chief_executive_officer , said further investigation would be required to determine the merit of Parsons-Dillingham ' s allegation . For now , White said , he will ask his agency ' s inspector_general to review the_matter . White also said that he wants the allegation assessed by a separate engineering firm that the MTA hired last week to investigate the construction of the tunnels being built by Shea-Kiewit-Kenny . If warranted , White said , &quot; we will take all appropriate action , including making criminal ( investigation ) referrals . . . . The inspector_general is the intermediary point between our management and law_enforcement agencies. &quot; Federal authorities , including the FBI and the inspector_general of the U.S. Department_of_Transportation , have been investigating various aspects of Metro Rail construction over the past two years . Parsons-Dillingham said Thursday that it has provided the level of inspection paid_for by the MTA . &quot; Given the MTA budget restrictions under which ( Parsons-Dillingham ) operates , P-D has consistently employed the maximum number of ( qualified ) inspection personnel , &quot; Judson said . &quot; The MTA budget does not provide_for continuous and simultaneous inspection of all tunnel construction activities. &quot; White , who said earlier this week that he is considering whether to terminate the contracts of Parsons-Dillingham and Shea-Kiewit , disputed the statement . &quot; Nothing in the ( Parsons-Dillingham ) statement comes_close to justifying P-D ' s failure to thoroughly inspect critical tunnel support elements , &quot; White said . Representatives of Parsons made a similar comment one year ago when questioned about inspectors ' failure to identify thin concrete poured in tunnels Downtown . An independent review launched by White of that earlier work concluded that Parsons-Dillingham fell_short_of &quot; acceptable industry practice &quot; in its inspections . Judson said that Parsons-Dillingham has been unjustly vilified . &quot; We can no longer remain quiet about the outrageous allegations that have been made regarding our performance , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
