   <HEADLINE> FBI RANKS IRVINE 7TH SAFEST AMONG LARGER U.S. CITIES ; CRIME : SIMI VALLEY IS SAFEST IN THE NATION . SAN BERNARDINO HAS THE WORST RECORD OF ANY CALIFORNIA CITY WITH MORE THAN 100 # 000 PEOPLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Irvine was the seventh safest U.S. city with a population of at least 100 # 000 last year , according to figures released Sunday by the FBI . &quot; We ' ve moved_up . We were 10th last year , &quot; Irvine City_Manager Paul O . Brady Jr . said upon learning the news . &quot; I don ' t know if you can really place one reason on it . We like to think it ' s a combination of good planning . . . good safe neighborhoods. &quot; The safest city in the nation was Simi Valley , a white-collar community in eastern Ventura County , with a crime_rate of only 27.8 per 1 # 000 residents . The rankings are based on major crimes reported to the FBI by local police_departments . Orange County cities ranged from Irvine ' s low of 39.9 crimes per 1 # 000 people to a high of 66.7 crimes per 1 # 000 in Fullerton . Other Orange County cities ranked this way per 1 # 000 inhabitants : Huntington Beach , 48.6 ; Orange , 52.7 ; Santa Ana , 64.2 ; Garden Grove , 64.8. The rate for Anaheim was unavailable because it was one of seven cities nationwide with more_than 100 # 000 people in which the FBI reported only partial figures . The national average was about 58 crimes per 1 # 000 . Mayor Pro Tem Paula P . Werner credited Irvine ' s success to a communitywide intolerance of criminal activity . &quot; We ' ve been able to get that sort of ranking due_to the active participation of our residents in their community and a professional police_force , &quot; Werner said . &quot; We also have no tolerance of gangs , drugs and drunk driving. &quot; Irvine ' s Brady said the credit for his city ' s high ranking should be shared by many , including past and present city_council members , city administrators and the local school_system . &quot; We have had the good vision to put_together the types of programs that make_it safe , &quot; he said . &quot; The one thing we have been watching closely is our gang activity so it doesn ' t get a strong foothold. &quot; The city ' s one homicide victim in 1993 was a resident who apparently confronted a burglar in her home , city officials said . Despite the high ranking , Irvine still is not a city where residents should go_to_sleep with their doors unlocked , according to Brady . &quot; I don ' t know if there ' s a city in the country where you can do that , &quot; Brady said . &quot; Even though it ' s a safer community , I don ' t think you can let your guard down. &quot; For the fourth time in five years Simi Valley topped the nation ' s list of safest large cities . The Los Angeles County suburb of Santa Clarita ranked fourth . In displacing Amherst Town , N.Y. , as the safest urban_area , Simi Valley ' s serious crime fell 18.4 % in 1993 due_to citizen involvement , a surge in arrests of drug_users and a police crackdown on theft rings from the San Fernando Valley , officials said . &quot; It ' s nice to be recognized again as the safest city in America , &quot; said Mayor Greg Stratton , noting previous designations in the mid-1980s . &quot; It restores what we had -- ( a reputation ) that we have a really great place to live and do business , and where you can still walk the streets at night. &quot; Simi Valley ' s image was tarnished in 1992 after a jury sitting at the East County_Courthouse failed to convict four Los Angeles police_officers of assaulting Rodney King , sparking the Los Angeles riots . A recent fatal schoolyard stabbing of a 14-year-old boy has also heightened fears about youth crime in Simi Valley . But the FBI statistics put residents ' growing fear of crime in a different perspective , Stratton said . &quot; Our crime totals are back to where they were five or six years ago , &quot; the mayor said . &quot; I think a lot of what we ' ve seen has been a ( spillover ) from the opening of the freeway to Los Angeles . People started to realize there was this nice place called Simi Valley that was fresh pickings . We started to get a lot of out-of-town criminals. &quot; Other low crime_rates in California included per 1 # 000 inhabitants : Fremont , 40.6 ; Sunnyvale , 41.4 ; Glendale , 44.4. Of the state ' s 10 largest cities , San Jose had the lowest crime_rate , 45.7 crimes per 1 # 000 people . Oakland had the highest rate among the largest California cities with 117 crimes per 1 # 000 residents , followed by Fresno , 115 ; Sacramento , 104 ; San Francisco , 90 ; Los Angeles , 88 ; Long_Beach , 81 , and San Diego , 74 . San Bernardino had the highest rate among all cities in the state with more_than 100 # 000 residents -- 132 crimes per 1 # 000 residents .</TEXT>
