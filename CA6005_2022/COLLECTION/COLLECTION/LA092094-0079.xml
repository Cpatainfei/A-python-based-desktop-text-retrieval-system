   <HEADLINE> FLEISS IS ORDERED INTO DRUG TREATMENT ; COURTS : THE ALLEGED MADAM IS TO SPEND TIME IN A RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM AFTER TESTING POSITIVE -- A VIOLATION OF BAIL TERMS . ' I WANT TO GO_HOME , ' SHE SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Alleged Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss was ordered into residential drug treatment Monday after testing positive for drugs six times since August , violating the terms of her $ 50 # 000 bail in an income_tax evasion case . Fleiss , who was arrested Thursday and has been in jail since , groaned , &quot; I want to go_home &quot; as the hearing drew to a close and it became evident that she would stay in custody . U.S. District Judge Consuelo Marshall said Fleiss will enroll at Impact House , a Pasadena rehabilitation facility , &quot; if Impact is willing to take her and has enough beds. &quot; If not , Fleiss will enter another program . She will remain in custody until she is transferred to a program , which may take one or two days , lawyers said . * Fleiss and her father await a federal trial , scheduled to begin Dec . 6 , on the tax_evasion charges , and she faces trial in state court on pandering and drug charges , for which jury selection is to begin Monday . Donald Marks , Fleiss ' attorney , argued that his client should be &quot; given a second chance , &quot; saying the drugs for which she tested positive are not &quot; hard_drugs , &quot; such_as cocaine or heroin . Marks said he did not contest the charge that Fleiss used drugs in violation of her bail . He noted that she has a prescription for Valium , but said he did not know if drugs from that prescription produced the positive test results . But Fleiss tested positive for both Valium and methamphetamines , said Assistant U.S. Atty . Mark Holscher . Marks said the stress of Fleiss ' upcoming trials &quot; caused her to do things which are in violation of the bail terms and certainly very stupid and destructive. &quot; He asked the judge to , at most , order Fleiss to undergo outpatient treatment . But Marshall ruled_in favor of federal prosecutors and pretrial services officials who asked that she receive residential treatment . Holscher said Fleiss has shown no remorse during her probation about her drug use . &quot; Before her attorneys got involved , she claimed that someone spiked her ( Coca-Cola with drugs ) at her birthday_party , &quot; Holscher said . Fleiss , the alleged head of a pricey call_girl ring said to have serviced many in the entertainment world , faces a maximum prison sentence of 12 years on state charges , and a maximum of 188 years in prison with a $ 5.5-million fine on federal charges . Her father , Dr. Paul Fleiss , could be sentenced to 305 years in prison and a maximum $ 9.2-million fine . Both have pleaded not_guilty to all charges .</TEXT>
