   <HEADLINE> U.S. , MEXICO AGREE TO PLAY IN SOCCER ' S COPA AMERICA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The national soccer teams of the United States and Mexico have agreed to compete in the Copa America , or South_American Championship , next June in Uruguay . Jack Warner , president of CONCACAF , told South_American Football Confederation leaders on Thursday in Asuncion , Paraguay , that the countries had accepted their invitations . Both teams played in the 1993 Copa America in Ecuador , where the U.S. team was eliminated in the first round . Mexico advanced to the championship game but lost to Argentina . The tournament will also feature Argentina , Bolivia , Brazil , Colombia , Chile , Ecuador , Peru , Paraguay , Uruguay and Venezuela . The draw to divide the teams for first-round play will be held Dec . 9 in Punta del Este , Uruguay . Meanwhile , a patchwork U.S. team leaves Saturday for Saudi_Arabia , where it will play the host nation in Dhahran on Wednesday . Unable to get the release of most of his Europe-based stars , U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic has called_on some pre-World Cup veterans and also has included two surprise newcomers . Named to the U.S. roster for the first time Thursday were defender Gregg Berhalter , 21 , of Tenafly , N.J. , and 17-year-old Maurice Ligeon of Chesapeake , Va . Berhalter was captain of the U.S. under-20 team that competed in the 1993 World Youth Championship in Australia . He left the University of North Carolina this year to sign with FC Zwolle in the Dutch second division . The New York-born Ligeon is a defender on the youth team of Club Brugge in the Belgian first division . Among the veterans recalled to the U.S. national team for the one-game trip are defender John Doyle and midfielders Janus Michallick and Chad Deering . According to a report on &quot; Futbol de Primera , &quot; a national Spanish-language radio soccer show , Milutinovic has signed a new 3 1 / 2-year contract to remain as U.S. national coach through the 1998 World Cup in France . However , U.S. Soccer Federation President Alan Rothenberg Thursday said the report was &quot; premature. &quot; &quot; It ' s not quite accurate , &quot; Rothenberg said . &quot; Bora and I have had a_couple_of very , very good meetings and , as I ' ve said , I want him back , I expect him to be back , I ' m optimistic he ' ll be back . &quot; The negotiations are moving very positively but they ' re not done yet. &quot;</TEXT>
