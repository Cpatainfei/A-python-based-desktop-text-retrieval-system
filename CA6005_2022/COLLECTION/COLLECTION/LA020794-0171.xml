   <HEADLINE> QUAKE PAYOUT TO BE INSURERS ' 3RD HIGHEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Insurance_companies will pay $ 2.5 billion in claims from the Northridge earthquake , making_it the third-costliest insurance disaster in U.S. history but by far the most expensive temblor , according to the official industry estimate to be released today . The losses are not expected to cause financial problems for the major providers of earthquake insurance in California , such_as Allstate or State Farm . But some smaller companies with greater concentrations of their insurance risk in California may fail , analysts say . Although the insurance losses are massive , it is not clear whether they will result in higher earthquake insurance rates or in changes in policies -- although some previous natural disasters resulted in such moves . However , the losses have prompted a push by the insurance industry to get the federal_government to assume more risk for covering earthquakes , floods and other natural disasters . Insurers will receive &quot; in excess of 200 # 000 claims &quot; from the Jan . 17 quake , said Gary R . Kerney , executive_director of Property Claims Services , a Rahway , N.J. , organization that will release its estimate today . The organization surveys insurance_companies to produce official catastrophe estimates . Only Florida ' s deadly Hurricane Andrew in 1992 , with insured damage of $ 18 billion , and Hurricane Hugo in 1989 , at $ 4.2 billion , resulted in higher dollar value of insurance payouts . Unlike in those disasters , insurers may bear as little as a tenth of the total cost of the Northridge earthquake because so_much of the destruction was to uninsured publicly owned infrastructure such_as highway overpasses , water works and public buildings . Gov . Pete Wilson has estimated that total losses from the quake could be as high as $ 30 billion . Moreover , a large proportion of the damage to homes will not be covered because only one-third or fewer of all homes carry earthquake insurance , and most earthquake policies carry high deductibles so that minor damage will not appear on the insurance_companies ' books . Still , the Northridge quake will be more_than double the insurance costs wreaked by the Loma Prieta earthquake , which shook the San Francisco Bay Area in October , 1989 , causing $ 960 million in insured damage . Until Northridge , the Loma Prieta quake was the costliest temblor for the insurance industry , although in total damage it paled in comparison to the San Francisco earthquake of 1906 , when there was virtually no insurance . California ' s top two insurers , State Farm and Allstate , last week estimated that they would pay_out $ 280 million and $ 350 million , respectively , in claims from the Northridge quake . Both totals far surpass the companies ' claims from Loma Prieta . Kerney , of Disaster Claims Services , said that earthquake damage is far more difficult for the industry to gauge than that of other disasters . &quot; In a hurricane , all buildings are subject_to the same kind of wind , &quot; he said . &quot; But in a quake , the underlying soil conditions are a big determinant of whether a structure will be damaged. &quot; The disaster has prompted a renewed push for federally subsidized earthquake insurance as part of an overall natural disaster program . Since Loma Prieta , insurers have increased deductibles and taken other steps to reduce their exposure to earthquake insurance_claims . California Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi criticized State Farm for instantly adopting an 18-county moratorium on issuance of new earthquake policies after the Northridge quake . After negotiations , State Farm peeled back the area covered by its ban to Los Angeles and four other counties . After Hurricane Andrew , which quadrupled the worst insurance disaster in history , some companies tried to exit the Florida market for homeowners insurance but were restrained from doing so by state insurance authorities .</TEXT>
