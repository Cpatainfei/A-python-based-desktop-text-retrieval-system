   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS / COUNTYWIDE : KISSINGER SPEAKS AT NIXON LIBRARY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The man who helped end America ' s involvement in the Vietnam_War autographed his new book for Yorba Linda resident Ted Wells on Wednesday . &quot; I think he ' s a genius , &quot; said Wells , 38 , a real_estate_broker , clutching two signed copies of former Secretary_of_State Henry A . Kissinger ' s $ 35 book . &quot; This is a major event and I would n ' t have missed it. &quot; Wells was among hundreds of people who stood_in line at the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace waiting for Kissinger to scrawl his signature on copies of &quot; Diplomacy , &quot; his new 835-page opus . Earlier , the Nobel Peace Prize_winner spoke_to about 300 people in the library auditorium , where he paid tribute to former President Richard Nixon and castigated what he views_as the media-driven Clinton_Administration for its &quot; wishy-washy &quot; foreign_policy . In his first return to Yorba Linda since eulogizing Nixon in April , Kissinger again praised the late President ' s skill and foresight in conducting U.S. foreign_policy , even in the face of unprecedented &quot; concentrated hostility &quot; at_home . &quot; The last time I was here was at the funeral of Richard Nixon , &quot; Kissinger said . &quot; It was a sad and moving and inspiring event . It brought_together Americans like nothing else that I can remember in recent years . &quot; Even he would have been astonished at the outpouring of affection and unifying impact his death had_on America , &quot; he said . &quot; He was a patriot. &quot; Unlike the Clinton_Administration , the Nixon presidency was marked by clearly defined foreign_policy objectives , said Kissinger , who served as national security adviser and secretary_of_state under Nixon . Clinton ' s use of military_force in Somalia was a mistake , especially in_view of a U.S. withdrawal from the African_nation after 18 casualties , Kissinger said . &quot; Before we commit U.S. forces , we have to know the outcome we want and we have to be able to define the national interest , &quot; he said . Likewise , Kissinger said , dispatching U.S. soldiers to Haiti , as Clinton has threatened to do_in past weeks , would be equally unwise . &quot; I do not favor a military invasion because I can ' t describe the threat Haiti presents to the United States , &quot; he said . Kissinger said the Clinton_Administration must also develop a strategy for dealing with the post-Cold War world , which the President Clinton has failed to do thus far . Clinton must pay special attention to fostering good relations with the Russia on the one hand , but also insuring ensure the superpower doesn ' t resume its 400-year policy of imperialism . , said Kissinger . Also , said Kissinger , Clinton must work to prevent nuclear proliferation in Asia , particularly by North_Korea . Compounding the difficulty in fashioning a coherent U.S. foreign_policy , Kissinger said , is the enormous detrimental impact of television . He blamed TV for eroding the national intellect , especially among the young . &quot; Our generation , Richard Nixon ' s generation , grew_up on books , &quot; he said . &quot; We could form concepts . The television generation is brought_up on pictures and they react to sentiment and emotion and therefore it becomes very difficult to develop a long-range ( foreign ) policy. &quot; After his address , a smiling Kissinger signed hundreds of books for those who purchased the tomes in the Nixon library store . Wednesday ' s sales of the bestseller , which contrasts the foreign_policies of the United States during World_War I and 17th-Century European powers , goes toward supporting the library . On the whole , visitors who eagerly awaited Kissinger ' s signature in their new books agreed with his remarks . &quot; He ' s a brilliant speaker , &quot; said Jim Fish , a 60-year-old film_producer from Corona del Mar . &quot; I ' m just excited to be here to listen to him. &quot; Even younger people , who took a knock for their television viewing habits , applauded Kissinger . &quot; I like the fact he was talking_about our generation watching too_much TV , &quot; said 16-year-old Kyle Vaughn of Modesto . &quot; We aren ' t able to conceptualize things . that ' s the problem. &quot; &quot; He sees the whole ( global ) picture , &quot; Vaughn said . Not everyone hailed Kissinger ' s appearance . Outside the library grounds , John Eisloeffel , a government teacher at Irvine High_School , conducted a lone peaceful protest . Eisloeffel criticized what he said was Kissinger ' s role in launching secret bombings in Cambodia and undermining a democratically elected government in Chile nearly two decades ago . Nevertheless , the high_school teacher said he plans to read Kissinger ' s book . &quot; I ' ll probably buy_it , but I ' ll wait for the paperback . It ' s cheaper. &quot; MARTIN MILLER</TEXT>
