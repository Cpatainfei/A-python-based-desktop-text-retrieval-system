   <HEADLINE> TALK_SHOW ' SEX-PERT ' ; DEBORAH COOPER DIVIDES HER TIME BETWEEN COUCH-SIDE THERAPY AND TV APPEARANCES , SPECIALIZING IN SOUND_BITES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After two half-hour segments of cable-television sex therapy , it ' s on to the &quot; Leeza &quot; show to counsel the hastily married , and then a sprint through the back_door to the &quot; Hard Copy &quot; studios for a discussion of O.J. Simpson ' s love life . Fortunately , Deborah Cooper has had her TV makeup on since this morning , so the face needs only a touch-up at each taping . And &quot; Leeza &quot; sent a limo , giving her time to study the schedule and find_out it was Danny Partridge she ' d be counseling in front of a_few million people . &quot; Some people just talk_about sex , &quot; Cooper says with a made-for-television smile . &quot; Others make a profession of talking_about it. &quot; Cooper -- that ' s Dr. Cooper to clients and fans since she has a doctorate in psychology -- is the consummate confidante of sexual deviants , guest of &quot; Donahue &quot; and &quot; Geraldo , &quot; a green-eyed blonde who one &quot; Leeza &quot; audience member swore was a movie_star . It ' s a harried and quirky combination that may have Freud turning_over on his couch , but Cooper believes she ' s found the perfect practice . If only there were time for sleep . &quot; I have to schedule it in , &quot; she says . &quot; Otherwise I forget. &quot; The Encino resident is a talk_show &quot; sex-pert &quot; and relationship therapist , called_in when television producers need therapeutic expertise , glamorous looks and the ability to offer advice to nymphomaniacs and depressed mothers-in-law on the same show . And in the age of sexual openness and Prozac , she is called often . This recent day began with the taping of two sex-filled interviews for &quot; The Dr. Deborah Cooper Show , &quot; which airs on Los Angeles public access channels . Then came the &quot; Leeza &quot; taping , where Danny Bonaduce -- once the precocious Danny of &quot; Partridge Family &quot; fame -- now a morning DJ in Chicago -- admitted to marrying his wife on their first date -- a blind_date -- in_order to get the morally strict Christian into bed . Cooper gave the couple -- still married four years later -- a minor scolding and her best wishes . Then she removed her microphone and rushed over to &quot; Hard Copy &quot; to chat about O.J. &quot; The excitement , the energy , &quot; she says . &quot; I have a blast. &quot; The 42-year-old Cooper stumbled into the mad world of mass media counseling and television sex talk in 1991 , doing local radio shows in hopes of luring clients and building her private practice . Three years later , she figures that she spends half her average working_day counseling clients at her Encino and Brentwood offices . The other half is spent less traditionally : hopping red-eye flights , making phone_calls from the back of limousines , getting powdered and pampered like a movie_star . If that all sounds like just too_much , Cooper will tell you it ' s a great way to make_up for her first two decades of life in Maryland cow country : &quot; Boring. &quot; The distinctly postmodern career also offered her a chance to do something she is good at . Television and therapy strike some as being an incongruous match , but those who request her -- again and again -- say her strength is making the improbable combination appear natural . &quot; She ' s got the look , she ' s got the sound_bite , she ' s got the credentials , &quot; says &quot; Leeza &quot; producer Adora English . &quot; We call her ' Dr. Sound Bite. ' &quot; Amy Rosenblum , a senior producer at &quot; Sally Jessy Raphael &quot; in New York , says handling sometimes fragile guests in front of millions of viewers is an art , and that Cooper &quot; gets_it . It would be a lot easier for me to get someone from New York , but . . . people open_up to her . She ' s a good guest. &quot; Rosenblum pauses , chuckles , and then addresses the subject all producers get_to eventually when evaluating Cooper . &quot; It also doesn ' t hurt that she ' s absolutely beautiful to look_at , &quot; Rosenblum says . &quot; I mean , we ' re talking_about a visual medium here. &quot; Cooper acknowledges , when pressed , that her looks do play a role . She also says that being attractive is an asset in the therapeutic sense when the discussion finally gets where it always seems to be going -- to sex . &quot; People look_at me and know I ' ve had a relationship or two , &quot; she says , and that helps them relate . Even her two marriages -- one lasting six months -- and two divorces , serve to lend credence to her advice , she claims . &quot; They give me much more experience . They ' ve made me a better shrink , because I ' ve been through hell. &quot; Certainly there are the critics -- many from her own field , she admits -- who tell her that &quot; Sally Jessy Raphael &quot; is not the place for counseling , and that addressing serious concerns between soap_operas serves mainly to trivialize them . First , she says , &quot; People don ' t like people who have made it. &quot; She also readily admits : &quot; It ' s not real therapy . You do real therapy in your office . You cannot do real therapy on television. &quot; What she ' s doing primarily , Cooper says , is educating people , giving them a taste of psychotherapy , making them say &quot; ah-ha &quot; as a light_bulb of recognition flickers for the first time . She also says she ' s helping remove the stigma of psychological counseling and mental_illness by bringing it into the open -- right between soaps . And if the naysayers still don ' t like it ? &quot; So what ? &quot; It ' s the guests , her single-session television clients , who really count , and &quot; they love it , &quot; she says . Indeed , after suffering a gentle Dr. Cooper tongue-lashing on the &quot; Leeza &quot; stage -- for marrying a woman half his age , of a different ethnic background and just six weeks after they met -- a man named Steve walked up_to Cooper after the show . &quot; Thanks , &quot; he said . &quot; Any advice ? &quot; WHERE AND WHEN What : &quot; The Dr. Deborah Cooper Show &quot; airs on Los Angeles public access channels .
