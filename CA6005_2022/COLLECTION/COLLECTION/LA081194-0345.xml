   <HEADLINE> NEUTROGENA NEGOTIATING POSSIBLE SALE ; CORPORATIONS : PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS FIRM , WHOSE STOCK HAS STRUGGLED , DESCRIBES SUITOR AS ' SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER COMPANY. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Neutrogena Corp. , which turned a line of transparent soap bars into a multimillion-dollar skin and hair_care products business , said Wednesday that it is negotiating a possible sale of the firm . Los Angeles-based Neutrogena revealed the talks with what it described as a &quot; substantially larger company &quot; after its once-languishing stock rose as high as $ 23 in heavy Nasdaq trading Wednesday . The stock , which traded as low as $ 16 earlier this year , closed_up 87.5 cents at $ 21.625. Neutrogena said no agreement has been reached and that a deal is not certain . There had been growing speculation in the health and beauty aids industry that Neutrogena , which is 45 % -owned by Chairman Lloyd E . Cotsen and his family , was in serious buyout talks , said Lloyd Greif , president of Greif &amp; Co. , a Los Angeles-based investment banking firm . The potential buyers reportedly included Procter &amp; Gamble , Maybelline and Chesebrough-Ponds . Faced with slow sales , big consumer product companies have pursued growth by acquiring smaller but well-known cosmetics brand-name products and their makers . Last year , Canoga Park ' s Redken Laboratories was sold to L ' Oreal , and a German cosmetics firm acquired a majority stake in Woodland Hills-based Sebastian . &quot; There has been a whole_lot of activity recently in the personal care products business , &quot; said Greif , who also cited Procter &amp; Gamble ' s recent purchase of Giorgio perfumes and cosmetics from Avon Corp . &quot; Neutrogena is a significant player out there . . . and it ' s clear that the company is viewed_as an attractive acquisition. &quot; Neutrogena is prized for its well-known and highly regarded line of specialty soaps and hair_care products sold through drugstores , supermarkets and other larger retailers . By creating a high-quality image for its soaps , Neutrogena has been able to distinguish a commodity product and charge a higher price than competitors . It has what marketing consultant Robert Grayson calls &quot; mass chic. &quot; &quot; It appeals_to ( consumers ) who would like extra status but don ' t want to pay extra money for it in a department_store , &quot; he said . * Originally called Natone Products in the 1950s , the company made lip brushes and other cosmetic products before it began marketing a transparent , amber-colored soap created by a Belgian doctor . The soap was named Neutrogena . Cotsen , who joined the company in 1957 , helped differentiate the soap from competitors by convincing doctors and dermatologists to recommend it . With the addition of a Neutrogena hair_care line in 1980 , the company enjoyed several years of rapid_growth and profitability . Sales have continued to rise and reached $ 282 million for the fiscal_year ended Oct . 31 . Neutrogena ' s profit , however , plunged in 1990 as competition increased . Profit has since bounced_back , but Neutrogena stock , which traded as high as $ 53 a share_in 1987 , has continued to struggle . In 1991 , one of the company ' s highly regarded executives , Allan Kurtzman , returned to Neutrogena as president and chief operating officer after helping turn_around ailing cosmetics maker Max Factor . Max Factor was eventually sold to Procter &amp; Gamble .</TEXT>
