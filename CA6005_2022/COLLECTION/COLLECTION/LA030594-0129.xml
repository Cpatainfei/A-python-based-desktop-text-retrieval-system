   <HEADLINE> DID NOTHING QUESTIONABLE , SPARTA INSISTS ; INVESTIGATION : THE LAGUNA HILLS DEFENSE_CONTRACTOR DEFENDS ITS BILLING PRACTICES AS CONSISTENT WITH GOVERNMENT POLICY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County defense_contractor Sparta Inc. Friday defended its practice of seeking government reimbursement for sending key employees to yearly company meetings in resorts , saying its actions were consistent with government policy . Sparta , an engineering services company , said in a press_release that the only reason the costs were questioned during congressional hearings earlier this week was that the meetings were in places such_as Mexico , Hawaii and the Caribbean . The General Accounting Office , the investigative arm of Congress , has criticized Sparta and five other companies , saying they billed the government for questionable overhead costs . The GAO also blames Pentagon contract officers for permitting such costs . Sparta said the Pentagon and GAO do not question its need for annual gatherings of key employees &quot; to review operating policy and technology progress. &quot; The issue , Sparta said , is the extra cost of having the meetings at resorts . Sparta contends such sites add only $ 200 per employee -- a figure the company said it considers &quot; incentive compensation. &quot; The Laguna Hills company said it is &quot; dismayed by the suggestion of improper overhead charges &quot; billed to the Pentagon . Sparta ' s statement says the company had consulted with the Pentagon before at least one of such meetings and had reached agreement on the terms for being reimbursed . After the GAO raised concerns about trips conducted in 1988 and 1989 , Sparta said , the company immediately refunded $ 17 # 000 to the government for costs &quot; questioned by the GAO to be expressly unallowable. &quot; The GAO released the report this week . It criticizes six small defense_contractors , Sparta and SRS Technologies in Newport Beach among them , alleging that they billed the government for millions of dollars to cover trips to exotic resorts , for excessive company car expenses , for alcohol and for unexplained consultant costs . A GAO analyst testified before the Senate Budget Committee Thursday and released a confidential 1992 GAO report that criticized the firms , saying they submitted questionable overhead bills to the Pentagon . Members of the committee expressed outrage at the allegations of abuse of taxpayer money . GAO analyst David Cooper told the committee Thursday that Sparta continued to bill the government for such expenses , including $ 229 # 000 for travel_to Hawaii , after being notified of the GAO investigation . &quot; In fact , Sparta ' s practices are quite different , &quot; the company says in its statement . Sparta , which did not attend the hearing to defend itself , said its meeting costs had been fully disclosed to Pentagon contracting officers and that those officers largely approved them as legitimate overhead expenses to be paid by the government . Although the GAO report does not publicly break_down specific questionable expenses company by company , congressional sources identified those incurred by the Orange County firms . Sparta allegedly billed the government for employee trips to annual stockholders and management meetings . The bills included $ 333 # 000 for trips to Grand Cayman Island , Jamaica , Hawaii and Puerto Vallarta , Mexico , the sources said . Other bills considered &quot; unallowable &quot; were $ 133 # 200 in meals for spouses of employees , personal use of company cars , alcoholic_beverages and inadequately documented consultant fees . After the company learned of the GAO investigation results in late 1992 , Sparta said , it met with a Pentagon contract officer to address expenses for its 1993 annual meeting scheduled later in Hawaii . &quot; Our charges for that meeting will be strictly in accordance with terms approved by the government , &quot; the company said . A spokesman for Sparta declined Friday afternoon to answer questions about the written release . Officials at SRS Technologies did not return calls_for comment .</TEXT>
