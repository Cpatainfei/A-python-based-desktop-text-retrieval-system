   <HEADLINE> ANTI-SMOKING PROPOSALS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * I started smoking as a teen-ager and gave it up with great difficulty after too many offensive and expensive years . I applaud the strong action sought by the Clinton_Administration ( &quot; White_House Seeks Wide Smoking Ban , &quot; March 26 ) . Tobacco should neither be offered nor condoned by a civilized society . I wonder how long it will take_to get similar , progressive action on alcohol . I am also an ex-drinker . I know how alcohol can destroy families and communities in a far more tragic and criminal way . M . POWER GIACOLETTI Lake Forest * Prohibition didn ' t work , but it created a huge black_market with much crime and corruption . The ( so-called ) &quot; War on Drugs &quot; is a huge failure , with a worldwide black_market , crime , corruption in government and flouting of the Constitution ( forfeiture laws , guilty until proven innocent ) . We could have paid_off the national_debt with what we have spent and will go_on spending . Now we will have a war on tobacco , ditto , ditto , ditto ! Washington never learns the obvious -- you cannot legislate addiction away , you must treat it . SHIRLEY OSBORN Claremont * I regret very much that your editorial writers did not take the time to communicate with me before editorializing ( March 27 ) against my efforts to protect the jobs of thousands of restaurant workers without sacrificing their health and that of the public . Had The Times given me the courtesy of a phone_call , or bothered to read my amendments to AB 13 , the smoking ban bill , you would have written a very different editorial . I am a nonsmoker . In the 19 years I have served in the Legislature , I have never voted against the health interests of Californians . The memory of watching my great-aunt kill herself by smoking will forever be etched in my mind . I have always believed that smoking is bad for one ' s health . My voting record on tough anti-smoking legislation is solid . My vote to end the &quot; Joe Camel &quot; campaign was an effort to stop the insidious tobacco campaign aimed at our young people . I do not accept or solicit campaign contributions from the tobacco_industry . That is why your editorial characterizing me in bed with the tobacco_industry was so painful and unfair . California remains in the grips of a serious recession . The amendment I offered to AB 13 was a direct response to concerns raised by the hotel and restaurant workers at the hearing that further restrictions on restaurants would cost even more jobs . To label me with the tobacco lobby for speaking out for workers in this hard-hit industry , is not accurate . I stated clearly that I supported AB 13 with or without the amendment . My amendment said that if technology is available and complies with the AB 13 standard , a restaurant could choose to set_aside up_to 25 % of its space for smokers if and only if the level is insignificantly harmful to the exposed persons , including employees , and smoke gases and particulate matter from that area do not recalculate or drift to other areas of the restaurant ( this is the standard of AB 13 ) . The amendment did not , as you assert , delay the effective date of the smoking ban , Jan . 1 , 1995 . Curiously , the standards offered in my amendment for restaurants are identical to standards that the author of AB 13 carved out for the powerful hotel industry . I told the representative of the American Heart Assn . after their lawyers had reviewed the amendment , that if they still felt that it would damage the impact of the bill , I would remove the amendment . If your readers would like a copy of the amendment , they may request one from my Los Angeles office at ( 213 ) 620-2529 , or from my Sacramento office at ( 916 ) 445-3456 . SEN .
