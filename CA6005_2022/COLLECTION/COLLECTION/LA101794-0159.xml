   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS : LAKE FOREST ; PLANNERS OK LARGER SIGN FOR PHONE DEALER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Planning_Commission has granted an exception to the city sign ordinance to a mobile telephone dealer . The 3-2 decision Friday allowed Mobile Line Communications to put_up 147-square-foot signs -- about 43 square_feet larger than recommended by city planners . Dennis Curtis , who owns the firm on Swartz Drive , told commissioners that a lucrative contract with AirTouch Cellular , a major portable phone manufacturer , depended_on its getting the larger sign . Curtis said customers have a hard_time finding his business because the Swartz Drive cul-de-sac , set_back off busy El Toro Road , is barely visible from the major thoroughfare . Since December , 42 customers have complained about not being able to find the storefront . Curtis added that AirTouch Cellular is hinging approval of a five-year contract on approval of the larger sign . Commissioners Richard Neuland , David Carter and Tim Hughes favored granting Curtis ' request . &quot; I have a lot of sympathy for the applicant , &quot; Neuland said . &quot; I ' ve lived here a long_time , and that is a hard spot to find. &quot; &quot; It looks_like an alley -- Swartz does , &quot; he said . &quot; It doesn ' t look_like a street. &quot; Chairman Richard Goacher and Commissioner Peter Burrows felt that granting the exception to Curtis might open the door for other businesses to ask_for variances . &quot; I ' m having a tough time with precedent-setting here , &quot; Burrows said .
