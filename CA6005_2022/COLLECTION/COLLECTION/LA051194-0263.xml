   <HEADLINE> COMPUTER_FILE / LAWRENCE J . MAGID : THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; ON-LINE NEIGHBORHOODS YOU MIGHT WANT TO AVOID</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I love to stroll around in major cities , but I would n ' t dream of venturing out at night without knowing which areas to avoid . I never get_in a car without buckling up . My wife and I encourage our young children to read books and watch an occasional TV_show , but we make_sure the material is appropriate . Life is risky , but prudence beats paranoia any day . The same is true when it comes_to using the Internet or on-line services such_as Prodigy , America Online or CompuServe . They offer a trove of valuable information and services for adults and kids , but there are some danger spots . Newsweek recently profiled a pedophile who used an on-line service to lure children whom he later sexually molested . A recent episode of CBS ' &quot; Eye to Eye with Connie Chung &quot; focused_on a stalker who used an on-line service to send harassing and threatening electronic_mail and bulletin_board messages to people he met on-line . Should these stories dissuade you from exploring on &quot; the Net &quot; ? Of course not . When it comes_to harassment and danger , on-line services are no different than the post_office , the phone_company or the local shopping_mall . Each of these institutions does what it can to protect its customers , but none can guarantee safety and comfort . Nevertheless , most people continue to open their mail , answer their phone and shop -- for the most part safely . Crank or obscene e-mail is especially hard to control . The Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 requires public e-mail and on-line services to protect the privacy of the sender and receiver . As a result , there is no way for the service to routinely screen the content of a message , any more_than the phone_company or postal_service can screen incoming mail or calls . Messages posted on on-line bulletin_boards or forums and Internet &quot; newsgroups &quot; are not private -- they can be read by anyone who has access to the network . If they ' re inappropriate , they can be deleted by the service ' s system operator , or &quot; sysop , &quot; who is responsible_for maintaining the forum . If you get a harassing , threatening or obscene e-mail message , you can forward a copy to your service provider , who can take action , including removing the sender from the service or , if appropriate , contacting law_enforcement officials . Because virtually all public e-mail systems are linked via the Internet , it ' s possible for the message to originate from another service , possibly even from overseas . Your service provider can help you track_down the source of the message , but there ' s no guarantee the culprit will be found . You may be able to prevent someone from striking twice . Some services and software_packages have what are commonly referred to as &quot; bozo filters , &quot; which let you weed out mail or even public bulletin_board messages from unwanted sources . Exercise common_sense when posting or responding to public notices on computer bulletin_boards or forums . Unlike e-mail , your responses can be read by anyone with access to the service . Never give_out your home address , and be very careful when it comes_to personal or financial information . Consider using a pseudonym if your service allows it . Responding to messages that are sexually explicit or suggestive could tag you as a potential harassment victim . At the very least , anyone reading your response will know your e-mail address . It ' s not uncommon for people who meet on-line to arrange face-to-face meetings , sometimes resulting in friendships , business_relationships or even marriage . But if you do arrange a meeting , make the first one in a public spot , such_as a restaurant , where you feel safe . Parents should never use a computer or an on-line service as an electronic baby sitter . Just because kids are on-line doesn ' t mean they ' re engaged in productive or appropriate behavior . Most Internet systems , for example , provide access to newsgroups ( forums , really ) that feature sexually explicit stories , graphics and even short video clips with virtually no limits on content . The major commercial on-line services generally do not permit the posting of sexually explicit material . A few racy graphics or stories might get_through . One exception is CompuServe ' s Human Sexuality Forum , which includes erotic stories . Although it ' s not foolproof , the forum does employ measures to screen_out minors . Regardless of what service you use , children should be warned never to give_out personal information and to tell their parents if they encounter mail or messages that make them feel uncomfortable . They should never agree to a face-to-face meeting unless their parents are present . Don ' t alarm your children , but do remind them that not everyone on-line is a good citizen . Remind your children that people on-line are not always what they seem to be . A message from what appears to be a 12-year-old girl , for example , could really be from a 30-year-old man . Children should be especially careful in live interactive chat areas , and parents should be aware that even the commercial services carry frank discussions that might be inappropriate for some children . Some services allow parents to block access to areas that may be inappropriate for their children .</TEXT>
