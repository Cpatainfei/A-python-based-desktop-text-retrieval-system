   <TEXT> Antonio Perez stands_in the field he planted with frijoles , or beans , and watches as grasshoppers eat_away at the now stunted and torn plants . They have wiped_out his crop . Grasshoppers -- a biblical plague , but one largely controlled by pesticides in modern times . Was there no pesticide for Perez ? &quot; The government didn ' t get money to me for pesticide , &quot; says Perez , a gray-haired , pleasant man in his 40s . His mother , Maria Jesus Perez , who lives_on the 15-acre farm with her son , his wife , Graciella , and their five children , explains , &quot; It is the way God wanted it. &quot; In another field , Perez ' s corn crop survives . And he may get some money from ProCampo , the Mexican government ' s welfare system for farmers . Then again , he may return next year to Chicago , where he has already lived several times , working in a plant nursery . The plight of Antonio Perez is a prime illustration of what is wrong with the Mexican economy -- and of the direct U.S. stake in the fortunes of Perez and his neighbors . In a decade , the state of Zacatecas , in central Mexico , has sent more_than 200 # 000 people to the United States , principally to Los Angeles . This lack of economic opportunity -- in Zacatecas and so_much of Mexico -- is what has driven the nation to the brink of change this weekend , as voters go_to the polls in its most wide-open election in 65 years . In a country racked by an uprising in Chiapas , the assassination of a presidential candidate and the kidnapings of business_executives and their families , the big economic questions can be boiled_down to a simple few for typical Mexicans like Antonio Perez : Will loans be made available to irrigate and improve the land ? Will food processing plants and other factories spring_up to employ Perez and his neighbors so they can make a living in Mexico rather than the United States ? And in the cities , will wages -- now the $ 6-a-day minimum for many workers -- catch_up to the price of chicken , now $ 1.06 a pound in a Guadalajara supermarket ? Antonio Perez might shrug his shoulders at such questions . Indeed , many U.S. analysts wonder if Mexico can ever hope to lift its standard_of_living , and dubious foreign investors are waiting to see if the election results spell stability in this country of about 90 million people , half of them under 20 and more_than a third of them poor . But the urge for reform is very strong . And across the political spectrum , Mexico ' s leadership ranks are confident that , this time , their country ' s attempted dash from the Third_World to the First -- to true industrial status -- will succeed . One embodiment of that vision is a company_named Cerrey S.A. in the industrious northern city of Monterrey -- a maker of boilers for electric_power plants that almost failed in the recessionary 1980s but instead transformed itself into an exporter to Sweden , France , Saudi_Arabia and the United States . that ' s no small feat in a country short on good roads and transport and lacking the kind of export financing that U.S. , Japanese and European governments give to their companies . Cerrey ' s response has been to focus_on specialized markets -- selling power components to industrial companies that generate their own electricity -- and to use computers as a competitive equalizer . The company , located on a paved but dusty road potholed by heavy trucks rumbling over it , boasts top-flight computer-aided_design technology that custom-designs equipment for Cerrey ' s demanding overseas customers . &quot; A company like this needs a lot of investment in new methods , &quot; says President Ramon Torres , a chemical engineer with degrees from the University of Nuevo Leon and the University of Texas . He gestures across a room filled with 23 computer work stations and then walks a visitor across the plant site to prefabricated classrooms where Cerrey employees are trained to work with the software of several countries . That training -- raising Mexican employees with high_school educations to world-class technical proficiency -- is the very essence of economic development and the hope of this ambitious and needy land . Economic growth and development are imperative for Mexico , which needs to create 1 million jobs a year just to keep pace with the young people pouring into its labor_force . And it needs to find work -- and education -- for the one Mexican worker in three currently unemployed or underemployed . The faces of underemployment are the men and children hawking chewing gum and novelties on the streets of Mexico_City , moving amid cars stalled in traffic_jams . In the capital , there is an abundance of unskilled labor available for menial tasks ; Mexico_City ' s population has swollen to 22 million in recent decades . The tax_system is partly to blame for sucking people to the cities . The federal_government collects all tax_revenue in Mexico and sends a portion back to the 31 state governors , who in turn concentrate their public spending in the principal cities . Thus , Guadalajara has grown to 6 million people , Monterrey to 4 million . As a result , workers can be had for a pittance . But food , clothing and supplies cannot . Fertilizer costs the equivalent of $ 242 a ton -- more_than Antonio Perez can comprehend . Boys ' back-to-school slacks at $ 15 a pair or girls ' pleated skirts at $ 25 apiece may look reasonable to U.S. shoppers but are out_of_reach for many Mexicans . The underlying cause of this mismatch between paychecks and groceries is that Mexico does not produce enough -- and thus has a limited ability to hire and pay its people . Mexican industry has surprisingly low output for such a populous country . Even the largest companies , such_as Monterrey ' s big conglomerates Grupo Alfa and Vitro S.A. , are no match in output or technology for companies of Europe , Japan or even South_Korea . Why ? For three decades , during which world markets surged with historic growth , Mexico ' s companies produced for a closed home market , with government protection against cheaper foreign goods . The companies made high profits , and those of Mexico ' s educated elite who worked for them -- or for the government that regulated and rewarded them -- made high incomes . But the companies could not compete anywhere else , and their limited operations made opportunity and good incomes scarce for most Mexicans . One result : high prices and soaring inflation whenever demand for goods from Mexican industry or consumers heated_up , as in the oil boom of the 1970s . Ultimately , the country was caught_up in a tornado of inflation that reached 159 % in 1987 . That brought_forth the rigorous stabilization policies of the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , which have brought inflation down to roughly 7 % this year . Salinas moved , too , to break_down the protective barriers . He opened Mexico to trade with the United States -- a historic reversal codified in the North_American Free_Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) that went_into effect Jan . 1 . Initially , NAFTA has greatly increased the two-way flow of goods , with slightly more U.S. exports coming_to Mexico -- which this year will rival Japan as the United States ' second-largest market after Canada -- than the reverse . In Mexico , NAFTA has meant pain , especially for small businesses coping_with the surge of U.S. merchandise and marketing know-how . But Mexico ' s exports are also growing , and in any event the country benefits from its U.S. imports . Says Commerce_Secretary Jaime Serra Puche , &quot; Eighty percent of the goods we import from the U.S. are machinery and other products to help modernize Mexican industry. &quot; Again , Cerrey illustrates the trend : Those 23 computer work stations came from Intergraph Corp . of Huntsville , Ala. , at a price dwarfed by the value of the boilers that the Monterrey company now ships to four continents . Serra , who earned a doctorate at Yale after attending the National Autonomous University of Mexico , sees Mexico ' s big companies restructuring to become competitive -- indeed , Alfa , Vitro and others are doing just that -- and smaller firms gaining prowess by working as suppliers to larger businesses . The government gives a hand , but not a shelter . &quot; I can take you to Puebla ( east of Mexico_City ) where there are a lot of small companies producing jackets , &quot; Serra says , describing a host of firms that once saw their profits eaten_up by local middlemen . &quot; Now we have organized them to share the cost of finance and marketing and to contract directly to supply custom designs to Polo and Members Only. &quot; Yet success stories will be few as long as small- and medium-sized companies face a virtually insurmountable obstacle : lack of credit . The longest loan a business can get is 90 days . The interest runs 25 % to 30 % , with fees to the bank on top of that . If the new Mexican economy is to have any chance , those interest_rates will have to come_down . One way to bring them down is to control inflation . And with that aim , this summer Mexico took a power-ceding step surprising for a one-party state . It amended the constitution to make its central_bank -- the Bank of Mexico -- independent of politics . The model is Germany ' s Bundesbank . &quot; We have the same mission -- to keep prices stable and inflation down , &quot; says Francisco Gil Diaz , deputy governor of the Bank of Mexico . With inflation under_control , Mexico ' s leaders are turning their focus to the bricks and mortar of the new economy . Already , private industry and the government are pouring money into building Mexico ' s infrastructure -- its roads and ports , and also its phone_lines and computing capacity -- which will form the foundation of its bid for First World status . In Monterrey , local investors put_up $ 3 million to erect a 700 # 000-square-foot trade and convention center called CinterMex . &quot; It ' s a place exhibitors from abroad can bring their products and save Monterrey ' s 7 # 000 manufacturers the expense of traveling , &quot; says the center ' s director , Jesus Franco . A gleaming glass structure , CinterMex symbolizes the old and new in Mexican industry . It is built_on the grounds of the old Fundador steel_mill , which failed in 1983 . The mill ' s rusting steel furnaces still stand_in a grassy area that is being turned_into a park . Elsewhere , the formerly government-owned telephone_system , Telefonos de Mexico -- whose stock trades prominently on the New York Stock_Exchange -- is modernizing the communications_system . Two years from now , Telefonos , which is partly owned by Southwestern Bell , will lose its monopoly and face competition , just as AT &amp; T does from MCI and Sprint . Meanwhile , cellular companies , one affiliated with Bell Atlantic , are rapidly starting operations . U.S. retailers Wal-Mart , Kmart and J.C. Penney are spreading fast in Mexico , where Sears has had a presence for decades . This is good for consumers , of course , but this opening cuts two ways : &quot; There ' s a price to pay -- our local merchants are going_to have to change , &quot; says Benjamin Clariond , the mayor of Monterrey and former head of a family construction business . Such transition can be painful . But when will it halt the erosion in workers ' wages and bring the benefits of an open economy to Mexico ' s tens of millions of increasingly impatient poor ? That will happen when it leads to an upgrading of jobs . In Mexico_City , Grupo Gutsa , a hotel company owned by the Gutierrez family , is instituting computerized inventory_control through a joint_venture with Labatt ' s Food Service of San Antonio , which supplies 2 # 000 hotels and restaurants in Texas . The result is a Mexican_revolution . The computerized system has achieved tremendous cost savings by organizing the former chaos of 80 food vendors making daily deliveries to Gutierrez hotels under the watch of 20 inventory clerks . What happens to the unneeded clerks ? &quot; I need them as salespeople for Labatt Mexico ' s inventory_control system , &quot; says Al Silva , a Texan and Labatt executive who works with Bernardo Gutierrez , executive_director of the Mexican venture . But Silva got a surprise when he said he needed salespeople . &quot; I was told that was a lowly position with no pay or status , &quot; Silva says . &quot; And I was puzzled until I realized that in Mexican thinking , salesperson , or vendedor , is seen as a lowly order taker , a Willy Loman who delivers goods and picks_up a receipt. &quot; &quot; But I don ' t want a vendedor , &quot; Gutierrez interjects . &quot; I want a marketing ejecutivo -- somebody who can explain the business to a customer . I ' d pay $ 30 # 000 a year for such a person. &quot; And so will many others , as Mexico ' s economy develops . But to upgrade the work_force will demand gains in education in a country in which only eight years of schooling is compulsory and many don ' t complete even that . &quot; we ' ll have to spend 8 % of our economic output on education , compared to today ' s 3.6 % , &quot; says Rogelio Ramirez de la O , a Mexico_City economist who advises international industry . &quot; But when we do , our work_force and economy will improve. &quot; Obviously , Mexico ' s modernization and the growth of its consumer market will take many years . If turmoil grows in the wake of contested election results , development will be delayed . Still , a lot of business people are preparing_for the consumer market now . Bancrocer , a medium-sized bank with 400 branches in major cities , plans to open hundreds of small , 600-square-foot consumer banks in poor urban neighborhoods . &quot; The vision is that people in these colonias or barrios will have savings to deposit and needs for mortgage loans , &quot; says Miguel Alvarez , a vice_president and director of the bank . Of course , the line will be short for mortgages -- just now becoming available after 10 years -- as long as rates remain at 28 % . Still , stocks in consumer businesses -- retail_stores and the_like -- will rise quickly on the Mexico Stock_Exchange if Sunday ' s election is carried_off peacefully , predicts Eduardo Cepeda , who heads the Mexico_City office of J . P . Morgan &amp; Co. , the legendary New York City investment bank . That Mexican stock_market already has received a lot of U.S. mutual_fund investment among the $ 21.8 billion in foreign investment it has taken_in in the last three years -- a huge bet by the average U.S. saver in Mexico ' s future . Of course , the U.S. stake in Mexico goes well beyond investments . Socially and economically , it goes_to the issue of immigration . If Mexico fails to thrive , its people will turn north for work in even greater numbers , exacerbating tensions along the border and in major cities like Los Angeles . And the United States has deeper , broader interests in Mexico ' s success . In contrast to Japan and South_Korea ' s Asian model of development -- closed economies and confrontational trade_policies -- Mexico could become a confirming example of the Western model , an open country developing economically while nurturing a growing democracy . &quot; We are going_to have greater citizen participation and higher incomes , &quot; predicts economist Ramirez de la O . Change is coming_to all_of Mexico , even to ancient Zacatecas , 375 miles northwest of Mexico_City . The region grew to prominence in the 1500s , mining the silver that made Spain rich . Today , Zacatecas is a place of budding tourism , centered_on the old mines and struggling ejido farms . Ejidos are land that was given to farm-worker families with the breakup of haciendas , or plantations , in the years after Mexico ' s 1910 revolution . There were conditions on the gift that proved far-reaching : The land could not be sold or pledged as collateral for loans . That limited the buildup of capital and practically ensured uneconomic farming as ejido plots became subdivided with succeeding generations . The Salinas administration changed the ejido law , allowing land to be sold and pledged for loans . It was a step that helped cause the uprising in the southern state of Chiapas earlier this year -- its leaders accused the government of trying to con the peasants out of their land -- but which actually holds_out possibilities for modernization . There are , for example , 150 families in the La Encarnacion ejido , where Antonio Perez lives . The land is potentially good . Perez says he would n ' t sell but would like to borrow to improve his land . And if Mexico ' s new president and his economic administrators are smart , they will see_to_it that loans exist to help Perez and his neighbors . Because unless Mexico modernizes its agriculture , other problems could arise , especially in relations with its NAFTA partner , the United States . Prof . Rodolfo Garcia Zamora of Zacatecas Autonomous University , an authority on agriculture , senses the danger in anti-immigrant rhetoric by U.S. politicians -- let alone new steel fences and beefed-up border_patrols . &quot; We need to think now of how to reduce the number of Mexicans who emigrate ; we need to make the jobs here , not in the United States , &quot; Garcia says . &quot; I believe we need a national economic effort to modernize agriculture , with jobs for everyone , on the land and in food processing. &quot; The future he sees is bracing , not gloomy . &quot; The NAFTA is a challenge for us , &quot; Garcia says . &quot; We have 10 to 15 years to change agriculture inside NAFTA , so we have to make a greater transformation than has ever been attempted before. &quot; Indeed , Sunday ' s presidential election is only one of the profound changes that will affect Mexico -- and the United States . The Mexican Economy The woes of the 1970s and 1980s have stalled Mexico ' s efforts to achieve true industrial status . Sunday ' s landmark presidential election occurs as major progress has been made in the battle against inflation , foreign investment is rising and the economy is growing . But chronic joblessness and widespread poverty have prevented the development of a robust consumer economy . Unemployment has shown no improvement in nearly a decade ... 1993 : 22.84 % ... and the economy ' s growth has been sluggish . ( Gross_domestic_product in billions of 1985 dollars ) 1994 * : $ 215.31 * Projected But triple-digit inflation is a thing of the past ... 1994 * : 6.91 % * Projected ... and foreign investors are back .
