   <HEADLINE> TWO-TIME NOBEL WINNER LINUS C . PAULING DIES AT 93 ; SCIENCE : NOTED RESEARCHER LED FIGHT AGAINST NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND ADVOCATED LARGE DOSES OF VITAMIN_C .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two-time Nobel Prize_winner Linus C . Pauling , a leader in the fight against nuclear_weapons and an advocate of vitamin_C to prevent cancer , the common_cold and other diseases , died Friday . He was 93 . Pauling died at his ranch in the Big Sur area about 7:20 p.m. , according to the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine in Palo Alto . He had been in frail health for several months , according to the institute . Pauling was the only person ever to win two unshared Nobel Prizes . &quot; Life has always been something of a puzzle , which I ' m always trying to figure_out , &quot; he once said . Pauling won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1954 for his research on the nature of the chemical_bond that holds molecules together and its use in understanding the structure of such complex substances as protein and antibodies . He published several books and more_than 1 # 000 scientific papers , continuing to put_out about a dozen a year well into his 90s . &quot; No one has made greater and more varied contributions to modern chemistry &quot; than Pauling , said Purdue University professors Herbert C . Brown and Derek A . Davenport and Cornell University professor R . Hoffmann in their letter nominating him for the Priestly Medal . Pauling won that honor from the American Chemical Society in 1984 . Dr. Francis Crick , co-discoverer of the double-helix structure of the DNA molecule , described Pauling as the &quot; father of molecular_biology &quot; and credited him for making_possible Crick ' s own pioneering work in genetics . Crick and James Watson formulated their model of DNA -- the genetic blueprint common to all living things -- in 1962 . &quot; It was his example in building models of molecules and dealing with those models creatively that helped us in the discovery of the double helix , &quot; Crick said at a fete for Pauling on his 85th birthday in Pasadena . Pauling , the son of a Portland , Ore. , pharmacist , graduated from Oregon State College ( now Oregon State University ) , obtained a Ph.D. from Caltech and later studied under famed physicist Niels Bohr . After the development of the atomic_bomb , Pauling became a peace advocate and campaigned against nuclear_weapons . In 1958 , he presented a petition to the United Nations opposing nuclear_weapons tests , a document signed by more_than 11 # 000 scientists worldwide . On Oct . 10 , 1963 , the effective date for the U.S.-Soviet test ban treaty , he was awarded the 1962 Nobel Prize for peace . &quot; ( It ) was a spectacular recognition of Dr. Pauling ' s long and strenuous efforts to bring before the people of the world the dangers of nuclear war and the importance of a test ban agreement , &quot; Lee A . Dubridge , president of the California Institute of Technology , said at the time . Pauling , an outgoing man with bright_blue eyes , often wore a floppy beret on his white hair and displayed a wry wit . He said once that the government ' s recommended daily allowance of vitamin_C &quot; only keeps you from dying of scurvy. &quot; It was his theories about vitamin_C that made Pauling controversial during the past 20 years . He maintained that large doses of ascorbic_acid , or vitamin_C , can protect people from diseases ranging from the common_cold to cancer and extend the life span by decades . In 1973 , Pauling established the Linus Pauling Institute of Science and Medicine in Palo Alto , which continues research on the beneficial effects of vitamin_C and other nutrients , on the body . Pauling himself took 18 # 000 milligrams of vitamin_C a day ; the RDA for adults is 60 milligrams . But time and disease caught_up_with him when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer in December , 1991 . A more detailed obituary on Linus Pauling will appear in Sunday ' s editions of The Times</TEXT>
