   <HEADLINE> MEXICAN JUDGE ISSUES RULING IN U.S. KIDNAPING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a case that elevated tensions in U.S.-Mexico relations , a Mexican judge has sentenced a former California ranch_hand to a 31-year prison_term after finding him guilty of abducting and sexually assaulting a Riverside County girl , Mexican authorities said Thursday . Serapio Zuniga Rios , 28 , a Mexican national , was sentenced Wednesday after he was convicted of sexual_assault , abduction and burglary in the kidnaping of the 4-year-old girl from a ranch near Temecula in September , 1992 , the Mexican attorney_general ' s office said . Mexican officials decided Zuniga ' s fate on Tuesday after rejecting a request from Washington that he be extradited to the United States -- a request backed by several U.S. congressional representatives who took a strong interest in the case . The matter became an international cause_celebre involving high-level officials in both nations at a time when Washington and Mexico_City were renegotiating both a new extradition treaty and the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . One U.S. lawmaker , Rep . E . Clay Shaw Jr . ( R-Fla. ) , said he swung his vote to support NAFTA in November only after Mexico ' s then-attorney general personally assured him that the suspect would be extradited . Mexico has never extradited one of its citizens to the United States for trial , and word that the suspect might be sent north in exchange for free-trade votes rankled sensitive nationalist sentiments south of the border . In Mexico , many maintained that Zuniga should be tried under Mexican law , which allows the prosecution of its citizens for crimes committed abroad based on affidavits and other evidence submitted to Mexican authorities . U.S. officials sent a thick dossier of evidence accompanying their extradition request . The Mexican attorney_general ' s office said Thursday that a judge rejected the extradition request earlier this month . But Mexican officials acknowledged privately that the decision in such a sensitive case probably was made at a much higher level . Joseph Krovisky , a Justice_Department official , declined comment on the case . After assaulting the girl , whom he abducted while she was sleeping , Zuniga wrapped her in a blanket and hanged the bundle from a tree , police said . Zuniga was allegedly enraged because he had been fired from a job at the ranch , which is owned by the girl ' s parents . He later fled to Mexico , where he was arrested last December after an extensive manhunt , officials said . The girl has physically healed from the assault but is still recovering psychologically , relatives say . * Times staff writer Sebastian Rotella in Los Angeles contributed to this story .</TEXT>
