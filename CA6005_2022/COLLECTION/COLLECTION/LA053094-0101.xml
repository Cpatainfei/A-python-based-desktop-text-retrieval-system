   <HEADLINE> FRENCH OPEN ; SAMPRAS , COURIER WILL MEET AGAIN IN THE QUARTERFINALS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pete Sampras has a 10-2 record against his long-time rival Jim Courier , but they have never met on clay . That will change Tuesday when two of the United States ' best players will meet in the quarterfinals of the_French Open in a match that is expected to breathe new life into the tournament . Top-ranked Sampras and No . 7 Courier overcame tough fourth-round matches Sunday to set_up the match many in Paris have been waiting to see . The two met in the Australian Open semifinals in January , with Sampras winning . In the other quarterfinal of the top-half of the men ' s bracket , No . 4 Andrei Medvedev of the Ukraine will play No . 6 Sergi Bruguera of Spain , last year ' s champion . Bruguera has four consecutive straight-set victories after defeating Patrick Rafter of Australia , 6-4 , 6-3 , 6-1 . Medvedev ousted Jacco Eltingh of the_Netherlands , 6-4 , 3-6 , 6-4 , 6-1 . Sampras had to fend_off qualifier Mikael Tillstroem of Sweden , 6-4 , 6-4 , 1-6 , 6-4 , in a match that could easily have gone five sets . Moments earlier on Center Court , Courier escaped with a 6-1 , 6-7 ( 9-7 ) , 6-1 , 7-6 ( 8-6 ) victory over French favorite Olivier Delaitre . Sampras had to break Tillstroem in the fourth set to serve for the match . But the Swede did not give_in easily . &quot; I was playing the No . 1 , &quot; Tillstroem said . &quot; I had nothing to lose. &quot; Tillstroem , who had never played in a Grand_Slam tournament , said his only goal was to not lose in an hour . If not for a_few missed opportunities , the match could have continued late into the evening instead of ending after 3 hours 22 minutes . &quot; I was surprised by him , &quot; Sampras said . &quot; He showed a lot of determination . I can ' t play that way against Courier. &quot; But Courier also will have to improve if he hopes to get past his old friend . A two-time winner at Roland Garros Stadium , Courier has not been_on top of his game , and it showed against Delaitre . He was lucky to end it in four sets after trailing , 5-1 , in the fourth . Delaitre has a weak serve , so he was not surprised when Courier broke him to begin the comeback . But after breaking Delaitre to take a 6-5 lead , the Frenchman broke back to force a tiebreaker . Delaitre stopped one match_point in the tiebreaker , but on the second one Courier made a nice cross shot at the net to end it . ELLIOTT ALMOND</TEXT>
