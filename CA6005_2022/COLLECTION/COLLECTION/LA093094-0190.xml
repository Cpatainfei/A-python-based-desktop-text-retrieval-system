   <HEADLINE> LAW EASES PROCEDURES FOR GREEN_CARDS ; IMMIGRATION : THE MEASURE HAS CAUSED WIDESPREAD CONFUSION . IT ALLOWS UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS TO APPLY WITHOUT LEAVING U.S. , BUT ONLY IF THEY ARE ALREADY ELIGIBLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At a time when policy-makers nationwide have targeted illegal immigration , a controversial new law that goes_into effect Saturday will make_it easier for tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants in California and elsewhere to receive so-called green_cards . The measure allows illegal immigrants who are already eligible for green_cards -- those approved because of family sponsors or job guarantees -- to adjust their status while in the United States rather than returning home to complete the paperwork , a major convenience . Despite its technical nature , the law has provoked widespread confusion and raised false expectations , prompting criticism of government implementation . &quot; I ' ve gotten hundreds of phone_calls from people who think it ' s a new amnesty program , &quot; said Peter A . Schey , director of the Center for Human_Rights and Constitutional Law , a Los Angeles organization that assists immigrants . The prevailing ambiguity even prompted Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner to issue an unusual clarification this week . &quot; Contrary to rumors , this provision in no way provides amnesty to anyone , &quot; Meissner said . Many of those who will benefit have waited for years for their visa numbers to be called . Starting Saturday , those approved for green_cards may finish the process in the United States -- after paying a $ 130 filing fee plus a penalty of $ 650 for anyone in the country illegally , the agency ' s highest levy . Under previous law , illegal immigrants had to complete the documentation at U.S. consulates or embassies , a requirement that forced many people who were already in the United States to make the often costly trip back home . Each year , according to the INS , about 100 # 000 visa seekers who formerly would have been obliged to file abroad will now be able to take_care of everything at local INS offices . Most are undocumented relatives of legal permanent residents or U.S. citizens . A bipartisan congressional majority passed the measure largely without public_debate last month as part of a huge appropriations_bill . President Clinton signed it into law Aug . 26 . The change was designed to relieve the burden on overseas consular officers , legislators emphasize , not to make life easier for illegal immigrants . Concerns in the House that the change could spur illegal immigration prompted inclusion of a so-called sunset clause terminating its provisions in 1997 . Critics say the new law rewards criminal behavior and favors wealthy immigrants who can handle the stiff penalties . &quot; We believe that a person who comes_in illegally shouldn ' t be allowed to adjust under any circumstances , &quot; said Dan Stein , executive_director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform , a Washington-based group that seeks curbs on new entries . Contending that the measure &quot; opens_up a three-year window for people who wish to flout our country ' s laws , &quot; Rep . Dana Rohrabacher ( R-Huntington Beach ) said : &quot; This change in law opens a loophole so large you could drive not only a truck through it , but a truck filled with illegal aliens. &quot; Nonsense , respond supporters , who say the law merely recognizes reality : Many of the multitudes now languishing on visa waiting lists are already in the United States . Illegal immigrants who are not immediately qualified for green_cards remain subject_to arrest and deportation , the INS says . &quot; No one who is not eligible for an immigrant visa will get one by virtue of anything that was changed , &quot; said Rep . Howard L . Berman ( D-Panorama City ) . Moreover , Berman and other backers say , those who choose to file_in the United States will henceforth contribute tens of millions of dollars in fees and penalties to the threadbare treasury of the perennially underfinanced INS . The money , supporters note , now enriches the carriers that shuttle green_card candidates back home . &quot; Everyone except foreign airlines will be better_off , &quot; Berman said . The $ 780 combined fee and penalty will , for many immigrants , amount to less than round-trip travel and other expenses associated with returning home to file , experts said . The major exceptions are Mexican nationals , who could probably make the trip to U.S. consulates in Tijuana or elsewhere for considerably less . Still , many advocates say the $ 650 penalty is absurdly high for a population often struggling to make ends meet . &quot; This allows the wealthiest people to take_advantage , while forcing the poor who cannot afford these exorbitant charges to remain underground and undocumented , &quot; Schey said . Exempt from the penalty are those 16 and younger and so-called family unity cases -- the spouses and children of amnesty recipients , mostly Mexican nationals , who became legal under the broad amnesty statute passed in 1986 . The new law explicitly seeks to encourage immigrants to file_in the United States and pay the attendant costs . Those who opt_for consular processing abroad will face no monetary penalty , but most will have to wait three months before receiving green_cards -- a considerable disincentive for working people . Apart from avoiding costly travel , advocates said those seeking green_cards will enjoy another major benefit : Those filing in the United States will have greatly expanded due_process rights if they are turned_down because of criminal_records , indigence , health_problems or other reasons . After denials at consular offices , there are few practical avenues for appeal . With State_Department posts swamped with visa matters , Sen . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) wrote the law as a means of alleviating pressures and improving background investigations of the many temporary visa seekers who apply at consulates . The quality of overseas visa screening has come under intense scrutiny since last year ' s bombing of New York ' s World Trade Center was tied to terrorists allowed into the United States . &quot; The consular offices in many areas are stretched too thin to do much anti-fraud work , &quot; noted one Senate staffer who worked_on the legislation . In a further bow to security concerns , the new law requires that most adults be subject_to full FBI fingerprint checks before green_cards are issued . Criminal histories can be reason for disqualification . The high penalties for those who file_in the United States were devised to assist the financially strapped INS , which is now assuming as much as one-third of the consulates ' former visa responsibilities . Some observers see a dark side : Protracted delays may get_worse at an agency that has been assailed for emphasizing enforcement duties over service to the public . &quot; The INS is already hopelessly backlogged , and I can ' t imagine this won ' t be yet another problem for local offices to deal with , &quot; said Charles Wheeler , directing attorney for the National Immigration Law Center in Los Angeles . Despite the potential deluge of paperwork , INS officials have no immediate plans to hire new personnel . The workload burden will be particularly acute in Southern California , home to millions of immigrants and perhaps a third of the nation ' s undocumented population . The INS office in Los Angles -- anticipating handling as_many as 50 % of those seeking adjustment under the new law nationwide -- is bracing for a crush of applicants and information seekers starting Monday . Special attendants will be deployed to assist those with queries . &quot; ( The law ) caught some of us off_guard , &quot; said Richard K . Rogers , INS district director in Los Angeles . &quot; We almost didn ' t get a good handle on it till it was too late. &quot; How the Law Will Work Here is a look_at a law that takes_effect Saturday and revises procedures for foreign nationals residing in the United States who have been notified of their eligibility for so-called green_cards , or legal U.S. residence documents . * What it will allow : Permits eligible visa-seekers to complete paperwork in the United States instead of returning to their homelands and filing there . Immigrants who are here illegally at the time they file will have to pay a $ 650 penalty on top of the $ 130 fee . * Who is affected : An estimated 100 # 000 immigrants , mostly undocumented , who become eligible for green_cards each year because of family sponsors or job guarantees . Under current law , they had to file at U.S. consulates abroad . * Costs : Implementation price_tag unknown . Total fees and penalties paid to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service could run_into the tens of millions of dollars ; some may be used to offset costs . * For more details : The INS is not prepared_for telephone inquiries , but agency officials say information will be available at INS headquarters , 300 N . Los Angeles St . in Downtown Los Angeles or 14550 Magnolia St . in Westminster . Nonprofit groups that work with immigrants may also have information . * What hasn ' t changed : There is no new amnesty law , no increased immigration total . This statute is merely a technical revision allowing eligible immigrants to complete the process in the United States . Sources : U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service and U.S. Congress</TEXT>
