   <HEADLINE> U.N. EMBARGO AGAINST IRAQ</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * In response to Ramsey Clark ' s Column Left , &quot; Iraq Embargo Is Killing Kids ; End It Now , &quot; Feb . 22 : Sanctions against the government of Iraq were imposed because of that government ' s well-documented record of brutality against minority indigenous people living within its borders . It represents a brutal , but necessary measure , as it curbs the ability of the Iraqi government to do business , and represents the price that the Iraqi people are required to pay_for supporting the regime . If Clark is so concerned over the humaneness of this situation , and the suffering that it entails , perhaps he would consider the suffering of the &quot; marsh Arabs &quot; of Iraq , the Shiite Muslims of the southeastern region of the country , whose suffering at the hands of the Iraqi government was so vividly detailed in a brilliant report on the &quot; MacNeil / Lehrer News Hour &quot; of Feb . 21 . The report details how the government is draining the marshes , depriving these people of water for working , food and life itself , as part of a systematic attempt at genocide , much as practiced against the Iraqi Kurds . The report is enlightening for all who can see it , and is eloquent rebuttal to Clark . BARRY SCHNEIDER Chino * I find it disturbing that an allegedly well-meaning humanist such_as Clark would so skillfully misrepresent the situation . There has never been an embargo preventing the importation of food and medicine . The problem is that aside from international contributions of such items , the Iraqi government refuses to purchase these items . The claim is lack of foreign_exchange . If Saddam Hussein would be willing to release a_few bucks from his hoard in the_Swiss banks , the women and children of Iraq would not be deprived of anything . I find it especially hypocritical for Clark to argue against embargoes since he was most vehement in proposing the embargo in place of military_action prior to the Persian_Gulf_War . Is he opposed to the Haitian embargo too ? Clark should use his skills of persuasion on Hussein if he has the welfare of the Iraqi people at heart . IRWIN GROSSMAN Los Angeles * Clark ' s column impressed me . He told of the devastating effect the embargo has had_on the citizens of Iraq . I agree with him that innocent people suffer more_than the heads of government . However , what about the embargo we have placed against Cuba these last 30 years ? They are suffering also . In the case of Cuba we ( the United States ) have done so unilaterally . Even the United Nations has berated us for doing so . Even our &quot; friends &quot; have voted against us ! Is it not time to end that embargo first ? Cuba has suffered long enough . MILTON L . TAUBKIN Los Angeles</TEXT>
