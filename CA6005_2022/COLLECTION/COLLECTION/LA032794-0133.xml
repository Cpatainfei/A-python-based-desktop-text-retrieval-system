   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; WHY DON ' T THEY MAKE ' EM LIKE THIS ANYMORE ? ; IT ' S NO MYSTERY WHERE SOME OF THE GREAT FILM DETECTIVES COME FROM -- BUT GETTING ONE FROM BOOK TO BOX_OFFICE IS A TOUGH CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In March , filming will begin on &quot; Devil in a Blue Dress , &quot; a movie_starring Denzel Washington , to be directed by Carl Franklin , who directed the critically acclaimed &quot; One False Move. &quot; This news in and of itself is unremarkable , except when one considers the film ' s source . &quot; Devil in a Blue Dress &quot; was originally a book written by Walter Mosley , the first installment of a detective series featuring the character Easy Rawlins . Although Rawlins , a recently unemployed aircraft worker in post-World War II South-Central Los Angeles who stumbles into the world of murder , graft and seduction , presents an obviously inviting film role for any number of actors ( Danny Glover and Laurence Fishburne both expressed early interest in the role ) , history shows that the chances of such novels becoming movies are about as likely as Sam Spade pouring himself a stiff Shirley Temple . The obstacles are sometimes practical ones , sometimes artistic . But if cult followers of such best-selling gumshoes as Kinsey Milhone , Dave Robicheaux , Jimmy Flannery and Kay Scarpetta are waiting hopefully for their heroes to hit the big screen , they may want to find a good_book . There is a long , happy history of popular mystery books becoming popular films ; in fact , an entire cinematic genre , film noir , was based on literary antecedents . The novels and serialized detective_stories known to French critics of the 1940s as &quot; Fleuve Noir &quot; and &quot; Serie Noir &quot; featured the work of such authors as Dashiell Hammett , Raymond Chandler , James M . Cain and Horace McCoy . Several film noir classics were based on best-selling mysteries , including Cain ' s novels &quot; Double Indemnity &quot; ( co-written for the screen by Chandler ) and &quot; The Postman Always Rings Twice &quot; ; Chandler ' s &quot; Farewell , My Lovely &quot; ( released as &quot; Murder My Sweet &quot; ) , &quot; Lady in the Lake , &quot; &quot; The Long Goodbye &quot; and &quot; The Big Sleep &quot; -- all featuring detective Philip Marlowe ; Hammett ' s &quot; The Maltese Falcon &quot; ; Mickey Spillane ' s &quot; I , the Jury , &quot; &quot; Kiss Me Deadly &quot; and &quot; The Long Wait &quot; ; Donald E . Westlake ' s &quot; The Outfit , &quot; &quot; Point Blank &quot; and &quot; The Split &quot; ( the latter two released as &quot; The Hunter &quot; and &quot; The Seventh &quot; ) , and Graham Greene ' s &quot; Ministry of Fear &quot; and &quot; This Gun for Hire. &quot; Although revisionists lament a dearth of modern-day noir novelists , a respectable number of authors have witnessed successful film adaptations of their work . The work of Jim Thompson , who wrote in the 1950s , was adapted for the screen in 1990 in Stephen Frears ' &quot; The Grifters &quot; and most recently , if less spectacularly , in the remake of &quot; The Getaway , &quot; starring Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin ; Ross MacDonald ' s detective Lew Archer was portrayed by Paul Newman and renamed in &quot; Harper &quot; ( taken from the novel &quot; The Moving Target &quot; ) and &quot; The Drowning Pool &quot; ; and Thomas Harris ' Hannibal Lecter -- OK , he ' s not exactly a P.I. we root for -- appeared in Michael Mann ' s 1986 film &quot; Manhunter &quot; before his reprise in &quot; The Silence of the Lambs. &quot; Six Elmore Leonard novels have been adapted for the screen , among them &quot; Stick &quot; ( starring Burt Reynolds ) , &quot; Cat Chaser &quot; ( directed by Abel Ferrara ) and &quot; 52 Pick-Up &quot; ( directed by John Frankenheimer ) . And &quot; The Big Clock , &quot; originally directed from Kenneth Fearing ' s novel by John Farrow in 1948 , was remade in 1987 as &quot; No Way Out &quot; starring Kevin Costner . Still , studio floors are littered with books ( make that treatments of synopses of adaptations of books ) whose characters , plot_lines , dialogue and hordes of faithful readers seemingly have the makings of an automatic green_light but seem indefinitely stalled . When Alec Baldwin read &quot; Heaven ' s Prisoners , &quot; published in 1988 , he &quot; fell in_love with the character &quot; of Dave Robicheaux , says Patricia Karlan , who represents author James Lee Burke . Robicheaux is a former New Orleans detective who now solves mysteries from his bayou bait shop . Baldwin optioned the book with Orion , but when the studio dissolved in 1991 the deal did too . ( Only last month , after six years of development limbo , did the project finally get_back on track ; filming is expected to start later this spring for Savoy , with Baldwin starring. ) Similarly , Demi Moore was attracted to the character Kay Scarpetta , the Richmond , Va. , chief medical_examiner invented by Patricia Cornwell in the book &quot; Cruel and Unusual. &quot; The author elected not to sign a contract with the actress , instead waiting for the fifth book of the Scarpetta series , &quot; Body Farm , &quot; to come_out in October . Two books in the series starring Chicago ward heeler Jimmy Flannery by Robert Campbell -- both popular and critical successes -- have been optioned but not yet made . In fact , there are a slew of contemporary mystery writers whose names have so far been missing from the movie marquee , among them James Crumley , Ross Thomas , T . Jefferson Parker , Robert Ferrigno , Sue Grafton , Marcia Muller and James T . Hall . Which may be a blessing , considering the underwhelming film adaptations some novels have suffered . Tony Hillerman ' s &quot; The Dark Wind &quot; was made into a feature starring Lou Diamond Phillips and directed by Errol Morris in 1991 . Although it was released theatrically in Europe , it went straight to video in this country , all but disappearing . Robert Redford still owns the rights to the rest of the Hillerman series , which features Navajo Police Lt . Jim Chee and Sgt . Joe Leaphorn . Redford has declared his intention to direct the next title , &quot; A Thief of Time , &quot; for which a screenplay is still in development . * Why do so many detective series novels -- which would seem to have built-in audiences -- founder on the shoals of development or , worse , those of bad movies ? One need only consider the fate of &quot; V.I. Warshawski , &quot; the hapless film_starring Kathleen Turner based on the popular series by Sara Paretsky , to understand just how many_a slip there can be between a book and a script . While Paretsky ' s books consistently stay for weeks at the top of the book charts , the film grossed only an embarrassing $ 11 million . And Lawrence Block , whose novels feature detective Matt Scudder , wrote &quot; 8 Million Ways to Die &quot; and &quot; Burglar , &quot; both made into feature_films . When asked if he was pleased with the film version of &quot; 8 Million Ways to Die , &quot; the author responded , &quot; I can ' t say that I was . But I think it was a picture you could have disliked even if you didn ' t happen to have written the book. &quot; For one thing , the 1986 film , which starred Jeff Bridges and Andy Garcia , changed the story ' s location from New York to Los Angeles , &quot; and the story was as much about New York as anything else , &quot; he said . New York was even the source for the title , which the filmmakers were going_to change &quot; until they fished around and decided that the population of L.A. County is somewhere around 8 million , and no one knows or cares what it is anyway , so they can say that it is. &quot; Locations were also switched in Block ' s &quot; Burglar , &quot; from New York to San Francisco . But that wasn ' t as salient to Block as the fact that his lead character , Bernie Rhodenbarr , a white male in the book , was played by Whoopi Goldberg . &quot; That gave one pause , &quot; he says . &quot; It made the change of locale seem pretty minor , like a costume change. &quot; Although he admits &quot; I haven ' t been knocked_out by the movies that have been made &quot; of his books , he says , &quot; I have by no means been sorry that they have been made . I don ' t think there ' s any reason why pleasing the author should be the first order of priority for a film company. &quot; Charles Willeford has had better luck . Willeford created the Miami police_detective Hoke Mosely , who first appeared in &quot; Miami Blues. &quot; The book , which was published in 1984 , was made into a movie produced by Jonathan Demme , written and directed by George Armitage , and starring Fred Ward , Alec Baldwin and Jennifer Jason Leigh , in 1990 . Although not a box-office blockbuster , the film had a fast pace , quirky humor and stylistic flourish consistent with Willeford ' s books . ( Although Willeford died before the movie was made , his widow was an adviser to the filmmakers. ) Asked why more pop detective novels don ' t become movies , the author ' s agent , Jim Trupin , said , &quot; I ' ll leave that to the committee that puts_together the scripts . With ' Miami Blues , ' Armitage and Demme didn ' t tangle_with the story line -- they really followed it . But often , the final shooting_script bears almost no resemblance to the original story. &quot; The other books of the Mosely series -- &quot; New Hope for the Dead , &quot; &quot; Sideswipe &quot; and &quot; The Way We Die Now &quot; -- have not been optioned , says Trupin . &quot; We ' ve had offers that we rejected , because we didn ' t want to sell_off the character rights. &quot; Character rights are a crucial issue for series novelists considering film deals . Carolyn Heilbrun , who writes the Kate Fansler detective series under the name Amanda Cross , &quot; cares a lot about how they treat her precious Kate , &quot; says the author ' s agent , Ellen Levine . &quot; Who plays her is very important , because the books are very feminist. &quot; Although Dixie Carter had once optioned the books and &quot; people have come_forward from time to time , &quot; says Levine , the series is currently not under option . * If anything , fictional detectives have a better chance of showing_up on television than in feature_films : Witness SpenserB . Fletcher -- even the Saint . And thanks to the redoubtable BBC , we now have televised analogues of Sherlock_Holmes , Horace Rumpole , Adam Dalgliesh , George Smiley , Chief Inspector Morse , Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot . Although wariness of losing_control of a character in perpetuity is chief , the petards on which these books have been hoist are often the same as for anything caught in the circle of hell reserved for projects in development . &quot; The scripts don ' t turn_out well , the actors you want aren ' t available , the budgets are too high , &quot; says Joel Gotler , president of Renaissance , a literary / talent agency . Gotler represents Michael Connelly , once a crime reporter for the Los Angeles Times , and Gar Haywood , whose Aaron Gunner book series was just optioned by Spike Lee . &quot; It ' s like musical chairs , &quot; Gotler says . &quot; The right book with the right script with the right actor at the right time will hit. &quot; Connelly ' s first two books , &quot; The Black Echo &quot; and &quot; The Black Ice , &quot; were recently optioned by Robert Rehme and Mace Neufeld for Paramount . Although &quot; The Black Echo , &quot; about Los Angeles policeman Hieronymus Bosch , was bought_in manuscript form , most new books must be bestsellers or have large_orders from bookstores and book clubs to be considered demographically viable , said Gotler . The fact that novels seem to be less popular material these days for screen adaptation &quot; has to do with the fact that there really aren ' t the equivalents of people like Hammett and Chandler writing now , &quot; says Alain Silver , editor of &quot; Film Noir : An Encyclopedic Reference_to the American Style. &quot; &quot; It also has to do with the fact that buying underlying rights and options to the rights of novels is relatively more expensive than original scripts. &quot; Independent filmmakers , looking_to European markets to recoup economically , often make thriller and neo-noir movies they know will succeed on that continent , says Silver . And often , they will make a pastiche on a noir classic -- &quot; Double Indemnity , &quot; say , or &quot; The Postman Always Rings Twice &quot; -- without bothering to obtain the rights first . Ed Victor , a London-based agent who represents Raymond Chandler ' s literary estate , says , &quot; It ' s a problem especially with the Chandler estate . Because he was so original and therefore so copied , people think it ' s in the public_domain , as if all that hardboiled detective stuff came_down from the mountain carved on tablets and not written by a living , breathing person who has relatives who make money from it. &quot; Victor continues , &quot; There ' s not much of Chandler ' s to sell -- they ' re all tied_up , &quot; but some of Chandler ' s books will be available &quot; in a_couple_of years &quot; when their copyrights are recaptured by the estate . &quot; So we will have an opportunity to make another version of , let ' s say , ' Farewell , My Lovely. ' &quot; He adds that all_of Chandler ' s books have been made into films &quot; except one , which started life as a screenplay , which is in the very center of development hell. &quot; He is referring to the shelved film version of &quot; Poodle Springs , &quot; a novel written by Robert B . Parker based on a_few chapters of &quot; The Poodle Springs Story &quot; that Chandler left when he died in 1959 . &quot; We sold the film rights for rather a lot of money to Universal , &quot; says Victor . Five scripts later -- three by Academy Award winner Michael Blake and two by playwright Tom Stoppard -- the film , which was made by Australian director Jocelyn Moorehouse but shelved by Universal , is still unreleased . &quot; It ' s madness , &quot; says Victor . &quot; Here ' s a terrific novel by Robert Parker , based on Raymond Chandler , with a fabulous script by Tom Stoppard . It ' s an undone Chandler ; there are all kinds of people who could play a completely new Philip Marlowe -- Harrison Ford , Kevin Costner . Think_of all_the great Marlowes -- Robert Mitchum , Dick Powell . ( Marlowe has also been played by Humphrey Bogart , Robert Montgomery , Elliott Gould and James Garner. ) And they start screwing around with it . I give up. &quot; * Jesse Beaton , co-producer of &quot; Devil in a Blue Dress , &quot; read the book in 1990 , when it came_out in hardcover . &quot; I immediately called to see if the rights were available , &quot; she says , &quot; and of course they had been snapped up. &quot; Beaton , who produced &quot; One False Move &quot; for Carl Franklin , followed the property ' s progress assiduously , until it landed in a friend ' s hands at Universal . Coincidentally , when she and Franklin were filming the HBO series &quot; Laurel Avenue &quot; in St . Paul , Minn. , Walter Mosley was in town for a book signing . &quot; Carl and I got_in a car and tore_down to the store , &quot; she says . After standing_in line to get books signed , they finally met the author and an &quot; instant rapport &quot; developed . The deal was sealed at TriStar after Universal gave_up its rights to it . As director , Franklin won ' t rely_on such classic noir devices as &quot; the femme_fatale , the smoky sets and the light pouring through Venetian_blinds , &quot; he says . Instead , says Franklin , who also wrote the script , &quot; I want to go_further into the story and flesh_out the characters and the era . Instead of being derivative of a genre , I ' d rather get_into the history of 1948 Los Angeles and post-World War II America. &quot; Rather than the deracinated heroes of Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett , he says , Easy &quot; is very specifically drawn . He ' s a black_man overcoming fear in 1948 , in de_jure segregated America -- and fear on many levels : Not just of racist society , but of compromising himself and becoming like his alter_ego , of killing again after the war , of being in business for himself. &quot; Although Easy ' s filmic potential was clear to Beaton and Franklin , in a city where the pitch is all , are books becoming obsolete ? &quot; The problem , &quot; says Patricia Karlan , James Lee Burke ' s film agent , &quot; is that there are so many screenwriters in Hollywood who have ideas for movies that become sequels . There ' s a feeling of , ' Why do we need to be buying books when we can do &quot; Lethal Weapon &quot; without them ? ' &quot; Edward Saxon , who with Jonathan Demme produced &quot; Miami Blues &quot; and &quot; The Silence of the Lambs &quot; and is producing &quot; Devil in a Blue Dress , &quot; points to the irreplaceable qualities of books and their authors . &quot; They can be phenomenal movie set-pieces , &quot; he says . &quot; Think_of those great interrogation scenes between Clarice and Hannibal Lecter . that ' s the great thing about great books -- they ' re often great blueprints for screenplays . You have great dialogue , great characters , fascinating situations , before the screenwriter sits_down to apply that extra discipline that it takes_to make a great screenplay . It can be tremendously additive to the process. &quot; Saxon adds that because of this , the sequel to &quot; The Silence of the Lambs &quot; will happen only when Tom Harris finishes his next book &quot; because we ' re not smart enough to think_up those great things Hannibal Lecter says. &quot; Saxon says that the potential for Clarice Sterling to become the female James Bond may be slim ( &quot; Tom seems to be sticking_with his villain &quot; ) . But there is always a chance that the next Bond of either gender is out there . And while Hollywood looks_for him or her , it can be very good to some writers . Authors are typically paid anywhere between $ 1 # 000 to $ 25 # 000 for an option -- for which producers reserve the right to make a movie from one book and put a hold_on the character for a certain period_of_time , usually three years -- and then 10 times that amount if the movie is actually made . If an option runs_out , the author gets the rights back , and is free to make another deal . In fact , Lawrence Block ' s first book made into a movie , &quot; Deadly Honeymoon &quot; ( retitled &quot; Nightmare Honeymoon &quot; ) , stayed in what was for him development heaven for years . &quot; Everybody could option it , nobody could figure_out how to make_it , &quot; he says . &quot; But it was making a living for me forever. &quot; It ' s a great_deal for writers , he says , &quot; as long as they don ' t make the picture. &quot; * Dollar_signs make tempting stand-ins for the creative muse . Agent Timothy Knowlton at Curtis Brown Associates , who represents Tony Hillerman , says , &quot; I ' m constantly telling authors that they shouldn ' t be writing books as movies ; they should be writing them as books . And if , somehow , it turns_into a movie , all_the better , perhaps . It might turn_into a movie and leave a huge taste of disappointment in the author ' s mouth. &quot; In order to avoid such an unpalatable result , James Lee Burke maintains a philosophical attitude . &quot; It ' s one of those decisions you have to make about control , not simply in your art but in your life , &quot; said the author recently from his home_in Louisiana . &quot; The author has to make a commitment in terms of trust , let_go_of it , and not look_back with regret. &quot; Mosley is confident that the artistic control he is surrendering is in good hands . &quot; Carl Franklin is more of a storyteller than a filmmaker , in a way , &quot; he said from New York . &quot; He ' s worried more about character development than he is about the gloss of the film. &quot; Although he demurred from discussing the financial details of his movie deal ( two other Easy Rawlins mysteries , &quot; White Butterfly &quot; and &quot; A Red Death , &quot; were optioned along with the first book ) , he admitted , &quot; I ' m not unhappy . I ' m not rich , either -- but I ' m not unhappy. &quot; But no matter the price , there are those authors who will always be chary of the limits Hollywood puts_on their work , whether in mangling story lines , pigeonholing characters forever , or otherwise alchemizing art and commerce into an unholy brew . Patricia Highsmith ' s Tom Ripley was played by Dennis Hopper in Wim Wenders ' &quot; The American Friend , &quot; a 1977 screen adaptation of the series ' first novel , &quot; The Talented Mr. Ripley. &quot; ( Highsmith ' s novel &quot; Strangers on a Train &quot; was co-written for Alfred Hitchcock ' s 1951 film by Raymond Chandler. ) But that was the last of Ripley we ' ll see on screen for now , says Knopf editor Gary Fisketjon . &quot; Every once in a while I ' ll get a call from some nitwit out there all geared_up saying , ' Can we have lunch at the Ivy and do a deal ? ' &quot; he says . &quot; But nothing ever comes of it. &quot; Highsmith insists in her contracts that producers can ' t &quot; say it ' s connected to her work just by giving her $ 500 # 000 , and then make ' Sister Act 3 ' out of her book , &quot; said the editor , &quot; which is a reasonable demand , except to the lawyers , to whom it is an unreasonable demand. &quot; Perhaps the author most adamant about keeping her novels purely on paper is Sue Grafton , writer of the phenomenally popular alphabet series starring Kinsey Milhone , the latest installment of which , &quot; K Is for Killer , &quot; will be published in May . &quot; My position is simply the result of the fact that I worked in Hollywood for 15 years , &quot; said Grafton , who wrote screenplays for films and television including , with her husband , Steven Humphrey , movie-of-the-week adaptations of Agatha Christie ' s &quot; A Caribbean Mystery &quot; and &quot; Sparkling Cyanide. &quot; &quot; I created Kinsey Milhone as an escape_hatch , so the idea of turning_around and selling her back to them makes no sense. &quot; Grafton adds that she would lose readers , &quot; and rightly so , &quot; when an actress were cast because one person could never jibe with her fans ' myriad ideas of who Kinsey is . &quot; And here ' s how those contracts read , &quot; adds Grafton . &quot; You sell a character ' in perpetuity , throughout the universe in technologies known and technologies yet to be invented. ' that ' s serious stuff. &quot; Will Kinsey be doing lunch at the Ivy once she has safely solved &quot; Z Is for Zero &quot; ? &quot; I ' ve made my children sign a blood oath that they will never sell her to Hollywood , and I told them that if they ever try it , I will come_back from the grave , &quot; Grafton says . &quot; Which they know I can do. &quot;</TEXT>
