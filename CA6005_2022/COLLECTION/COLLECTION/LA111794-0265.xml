   <HEADLINE> LAST-MINUTE GOP DONATIONS TIPPED KEY ASSEMBLY RACES ; POLITICS : REPUBLICAN_PARTY , PHILIP MORRIS AND POLITICAL ACTION COMMITTEES CHANGED BALANCE IN SEVERAL CONTESTS , LOOSENING BROWN ' S HOLD_ON SPEAKERSHIP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the eve of the Nov . 8 election , Democrats , already anxious about the reelection chances of first-term Assemblywoman Betty Karnette of Long_Beach , saw an ominous sign . Sacks bulging with mail from her Republican opponent , Rancho Palos Verdes City Mayor Steve Kuykendall , began arriving_at post_offices for delivery to voters . The last-minute mailings , underwritten with a $ 125 # 000 contribution from tobacco giant Philip Morris U.S.A. , helped tip a close election in Kuykendall ' s favor and may end Democrat Willie Brown ' s record 14-year Assembly speakership . That the tobacco_industry would deliver the fatal blow is a strange irony . Few political_leaders in the past decade have taken more money from the tobacco_industry than Brown , who received more_than $ 400 # 000 . In 1991-92 , he received $ 220 # 000 , more_than any other politician during that time , according to a study by UC San Francisco researcher Stanton Glantz . Brown has attended the Kentucky_Derby as a guest of a tobacco company , and in his private law_practice has counseled a company with major tobacco holdings . If Kuykendall holds his narrow lead when all absentee_ballots are counted , Republicans are expected to emerge with a 41-39 edge_in the 80-member lower house . Trying somehow to hang onto the speakership , Brown has called an unusual session for today of the lame-duck Assembly , where Democrats maintain a 47-33 margin . Philip Morris gambled by crossing Brown ( D-San Francisco ) . But the firm ' s infusion of cash was also a show of special_interest strength , and Philip Morris was not alone in contributing campaign money in a handful of close Assembly races the GOP won , tipping the balance_of_power away from Democrats and to Republicans for the first time since 1969 . Gun owners and the state_prison guards union influenced other tight races . A far-right political_action_committee also spent heavily on GOP candidates . Taken together , the donations show how big money given late in the campaign influenced close contests at a time when voters are increasingly unfamiliar_with short-term incumbents who are turning_over faster than ever because of voter-imposed term limits and the effects of the 1991 reapportionment . Although last-minute special_interest contributions were important , there were other factors as well . Brown has long been considered a master strategist , but his last-minute fund-raising prowess failed to match that of Assembly Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga , and Brulte is now on the verge of unseating Brown as Speaker of what will be a closely divided house . Realizing Democrats ' vulnerability in the final days before the election , Republicans poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into swing districts , leaving the Speaker unable to match the spending . Brown ' s money problems were compounded by the GOP tide that swept the state and country , and his party ' s general opposition to Proposition 187 , the popular anti-illegal immigration measure . Also , in some races , especially in a strong Democratic seat centered around Salinas , Democrats seem to have taken victory for granted . Democrats were also plagued by abysmally low voter_turnouts , particularly among blacks , and top of the ticket candidates Dianne Feinstein and Kathleen Brown attracting money that otherwise would have gone_to Assembly Democratic candidates . With Karnette ' s apparent defeat , four Democratic incumbent Assembly members will have lost . Four other seats previously held by Democrats went_to Republicans . The Republican victory even surprised Brulte . &quot; We thought it was possible to get_to 41 or 42 ( in the Assembly ) if everything broke right , but we didn ' t anticipate it , &quot; he said . Still , he said , &quot; 15 days out , I made the decision that we would go_for broke. &quot; Finally , he said , &quot; it was my gut instinct &quot; change was coming . Brulte ' s gambit earned the respect of Bill Cavala , a top Brown campaign deputy , who said he was surprised by the money that flowed to GOP candidates in the final days . He praised the way Brulte allocated his money to campaigns and &quot; took some gambles , &quot; especially against Karnette . Brulte said he did not solicit Philip Morris ' $ 125 # 000 donation to Kuykendall , but knew it was coming a month before the money arrived . The Philip Morris money allowed Brulte to spend his money elsewhere . Philip Morris executive David Laufer told The Times that the donation was aimed not at deposing Brown but specifically at Karnette , who voted against tobacco repeatedly during her one Assembly term . &quot; We contributed because we opposed the incumbent , &quot; Laufer said . &quot; It was the incumbent we were opposing. &quot; Democrats say Philip Morris was attempting to send a message to any legislator who favors anti-smoking legislation . Kuykendall said Philip Morris officials knew he supported the Rancho Palos Verdes ' resolution opposing Proposition 188 , the tobacco_industry ' s effort to overturn local and state smoking restrictions , and voted for the city ' s ban on smoking in restaurants . Kuykendall , who admitted that his campaign was strapped for money , said : &quot; ( Philip Morris ) wanted Willie Brown gone as Speaker . They have reasons to want a better business environment. &quot; Philip Morris , however , was not alone in underwriting campaigns . Brulte dumped nearly $ 1.5 million into Republican Assembly races -- almost all_of it coming_in the final weeks of the election -- and the Republican_Party spent several hundred_thousand more on direct mail and a strong effort to get_out the vote . In all , Republicans raised $ 3.5 million for the Assembly races . Paralleling this effort , the conservative Allied Business Political Action Committee spent almost $ 300 # 000 in the final month on Republican Assembly candidates . Gale Kaufman , the Assembly Democrat ' s campaign director , said Brown &quot; wasn ' t in ( the campaigns ) with as_many players . He didn ' t have an Allied Business PAC . . . to write a big check. &quot; In past elections , she said , Brown was able to tap the California Teachers Assn . or veteran Democratic Assembly members . But the CTA spent heavily to defeat Proposition 187 , and was strapped because it spent $ 13 million to defeat a school voucher initiative last year . Additionally , many Assembly Democrats who were proven fund-raisers for Brown were retiring or moving_up to the Senate . Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer ( D-Hayward ) also made a strong pitch for money , as he successfully sought to hold Democratic control of the upper house . The net result was that money was siphoned from Brown . Brown said Proposition 187 had as much to do with the Democrat losses as anything on the ballot . He said Brulte told him that GOP polling showed that voters had a favorable impression of Democratic candidates , but when told the Democrats in_question opposed the initiative there would &quot; be a 20-30 point flip. &quot; One major surprise for Democrats was the 28th Assembly District , the so-called Steinbeck seat because stories of novelist John Steinbeck were set around Salinas . Although polls privately showed Democrat Lily Cervantes , a member of the Coastal Commission , in_trouble , legislators failed to provide her with much money or mount a street-level campaign . Another close race was in the 56th Assembly District , a suburban and blue-collar area that for two decades has swung between Democrats and Republicans . Assemblyman Bob Epple ( D-Cerritos ) lost to Republican Phil Hawkins in a rematch of their close 1992 contest . In addition to Brulte ' s $ 345 # 000 , John Stoos of the Gun Owners of California said gun groups gave $ 40 # 000 to Hawkins , adding that Epple was his &quot; No . 1 target. &quot; Epple incurred gun owners ' wrath by voting to limit the size of firearms magazines . &quot; That was pay-back for him , &quot; Stoos said , adding that with the turnover in the Assembly he now counts 46 pro-gun votes , compared to 37 before the election . Times staff writers Carl Ingram in Sacramento and Ted Johnson in Torrance contributed to this story .</TEXT>
