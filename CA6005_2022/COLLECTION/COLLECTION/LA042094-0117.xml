   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; Q &amp; A : STAN HONEY ; NEWS CORP . SETS_OUT TO MAKE DELPHI AN INTERACTIVE FORCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stan Honey Title : Executive_vice_president for technology at News Corp . Age : 38 Education : Bachelor ' s degree in engineering and applied science , Yale_University ; master ' s in electrical_engineering , Stanford_University Computer ( s ) : HP Omnibook 425 , Toshiba 4400 color portable Recreation : Navigating ocean racers Favorite Usenet group : rec.boats * Last September , just when it was becoming hip_to have an Internet address , Rupert Murdoch ' s News Corp . bought Delphi Internet Services , the nation ' s largest provider of access to the globe-spanning web of computer_networks . The challenge for the executives and engineers tinkering away at Delphi ' s Cambridge , Mass.-based headquarters has been to transform the somewhat obscure firm into a user-friendly , entertainment-oriented service capable of competing with better known rivals in the field -- such_as America Online and Prodigy -- without alienating its techie base . One plan is to develop electronic versions of News Corp. ' s media properties , such_as TV Guide , and distribute them on-line . Subscriptions have doubled to 100 # 000 in the last six months , but that ' s still a long way from the 1-million mark News Corp . executives hope to reach by next year . It ' s new territory for the media conglomerate , whose extensive holdings include newspapers , the Fox television network , book publisher HarperCollins , and Star TV , an Asian satellite television service . Stanley Honey , who heads News Corp. ' s technology group , talked recently about the firm ' s plans to capitalize on its on-line acquisition . * Q : Why does News Corp . want to own an on-line computer service ? A : There ' s a_couple_of different reasons . One of them is that News Corp . has been_active in all other forms of advanced media , and this was the one omission . The other reason is that we ' re starting to realize that interactivity really means something a little different than we thought . We ' re not sure that interactivity means people interacting with a computer because , other_than boys playing video_games , not many people find that compelling . News Corp. ' s view of new media is that something very interesting is happening , where it ' s becoming real clear that people are very interested in interacting with one another and yet , due_to the richness of media , as things evolve , people ' s interests are getting narrower and narrower . And the on-line area provides a great environment for people to pursue their narrow interests . * Q : What ' s your vision for Delphi ' s future ? A : Today Delphi is really a service that ' s focusing_on the computer enthusiast , and it has the most , the broadest and most powerful access to the Internet of any of the on-line services . But it ' s still a text-only service . We ' re going to evolve that into an extremely flexible and powerful graphic interface . But the objective is to not lose any of the current subscriber devotion , which is really the computer enthusiasts themselves . * Q : Does the fact that the Internet is still pretty much unintelligible to non-nerds make_it difficult for Delphi to expand its appeal ? A : No . The Internet is just sort of one place on Delphi that holds a lot of interest for people , and today Delphi ' s interface to the Internet actually makes the Internet reasonably accessible to the non-propeller head . * Q : What do people find so compelling about on-line interaction ? A : For me , the thing that ' s most interesting is to find people with closely held opinions that either agree or disagree violently with mine in fairly narrow areas . You know , some years ago people all kind of read the paper and you could sort of characterize your interests as you ' re a Republican or a Democrat , and you could go_to a bar and you could find people to discuss those closely held opinions . Nowadays , the diversity of media is such_that people characterize themselves as environmental activists or feminists , and the issues that people feel strongly about are much more numerous and much narrower . And the on-line environment gives people a way of sort of finding a bar that has those 12 people in it from around the country that are most interested in much narrower fields . Then there ' s another part , which is the interaction with other humans , even though it may be anonymous , trying_out different points_of_view or personality traits and just sort of exploring that interaction . And I ' m really defining interaction as being where you do something and you get a reaction back that has incorporated genuine human intelligence and is unexpected . As opposed to a video_game or something where you ' re interacting with it , or an encyclopedia on CD-ROM , where in principle you ' re interacting with it but , nevertheless , the answer you get_back is mostly what you expected the thing to do . So there ' s no real human intellect involved in the interaction . * Q : OK , but in that case , why would someone go_to an on-line service to do something like read TV Guide ? A : They would n ' t . And nobody really expects you to be sitting on your couch and then you finish a TV_show and you wonder what ' s on next , so you get_up out of the couch , walk into the office , boot up the computer , log_in and see what ' s on next . What we would expect to happen is that if you see an episode of &quot; Star Trek &quot; and you ' re a Trekkie and this is particularly interesting to you and you think that this is an issue where they have violated ( &quot; Star Trek &quot; creator Gene ) Roddenberry ' s ethics on this thing and they ' re undermining the whole concept of the show , you are going_to be able to go_to the TV Guide forum on-line , and there you ' re going to find access to the discussion at_large on this topic . And so the TV Guide on-line will be the place you go_to talk_about and find_out more about TV . Now , there would also be in the TV Guide on-line forum much more in-depth information about TV_shows than the print product would have . You could do things like search for the next Bogart movie or something like that . Q : How are you using Delphi to exploit News Corp. ' s other media assets ? A : I don ' t think it ' s so_much Delphi exploiting other media assets as it is the other media companies using Delphi to allow them to promote a new service to these new customers that own PCs . The TV Guide on-line and the Fox football and HarperCollins assets and reference and education and children ' s and so forth on Delphi -- this isn ' t a matter of Delphi exploiting those content items . It ' s really a matter of Delphi helping those companies to bring their products into additional media forms . * Q : Will Delphi include content that isn ' t owned by News Corp. ? A : Yes , we ' re aggressively recruiting other content providers .</TEXT>
