   <HEADLINE> OPTIMA TO PRESERVE ' NET ' OF DOCTORS KNOWN TO AID POOR ; HEARING : PROVIDERS WILL BE FORCED TO CHANGE UNDER COUNTY ' S NEW MEDI-CAL HEALTH_CARE_DELIVERY SYSTEM , CHAIRMAN WARNS . ACCESS IS STILL THE TOP PRIORITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Preserving the &quot; safety net &quot; of physicians , community clinics and hospitals that long have served the poor should be a high priority , everyone agreed at a hearing Tuesday to discuss a new health_care_delivery system for Orange County Medi-Cal recipients . However , the board of directors of OPTIMA , the agency that will develop a countywide Medi-Cal managed care system , warned that these traditional health_care_providers will have to make changes , such_as forming full-service networks or joining existing health_maintenance_organizations , to survive . &quot; Changes are going_to have to take_place . We are not going_to have the status_quo . I think that is the message , &quot; OPTIMA Chairman John R . Cochran said at the hearing to obtain public reaction to options for designing the new health program . At the start of the three-hour hearing , Westminster Councilman Tony Lam presented a petition signed by 4 # 500 Vietnamese residents asking that they retain the right to choose their physicians , hospitals , pharmacies and other services and &quot; not have to follow a bureaucratic and complex health_care system. &quot; Dr. Hung Ong , speaking_for the Vietnamese Medical Assn . and the Vietnamese Physician Assn . of California , said there are 40 # 000 Vietnamese on Medi-Cal in the county already receiving adequate treatment from Vietnamese physicians who &quot; faithfully cared_for them through years of decreasing reimbursements and increasing bureaucracy and continued to stand_by them even when the state was paying with IOUs that no bank honored. &quot; Ong said such physicians have &quot; earned the right to be preserved as a special provider category , part of the health_care safety net. &quot; Cyndy Johnson , managing director of the Pacific Health_Care Policy Group who is serving as a consultant to the OPTIMA board , said that an astoundingly large_number of people eligible for Medi-Cal in Orange County , many of them children , are not getting medical attention . &quot; Less than half of those eligible for Medi-Cal ( in Orange County ) use the services , &quot; she said . By contrast , she said , 88 % of those eligible for Medicaid in New York get medical_care . The purpose of OPTIMA , she noted , is to improve access to health_care for Orange County residents dependent_on the state program whose low reimbursement rates have historically discouraged physicians from participating . Johnson cautioned that even under a proposed new system in Orange County that would pay primary physicians a monthly fee for each patient , medical services will be limited by Medi-Cal ' s severe budget constraints . &quot; We have a very poorly funded Medicaid system in the county and the state , the_likes_of which I have seen only in the very deep_South , &quot; Johnson said . &quot; There is no pot of gold at the end of this rainbow. &quot; But the dollars can be stretched , she said , through a system that will shift more care away from hospitals and hospital emergency_rooms and toward primary care physicians .</TEXT>
