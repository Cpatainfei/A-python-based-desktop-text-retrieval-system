   <HEADLINE> MAJOR RELIGIOUS GROUPS CONTINUE TO LOSE MEMBERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the high-stakes game of denominational musical chairs , the big winner of the ' 90s may be no church at all . A new study on religious mobility in America has found that many Americans have given_up the religious tradition they grew_up with and not replaced it , or have turned_to another form of religion . Catholics and conservative Protestants are the most loyal , but even large segments of their memberships are showing increasingly marginal ties to their denominations , researchers say in the latest issue of the Review of Religious Research . The social pressure to belong_to an organized religious group , which reached its height in the 1950s , doesn ' t seem to apply . &quot; It ' s become quite acceptable these days to be nothing throughout your life , &quot; said C . Kirk Hadaway of the United Church Board of Homeland Ministries . &quot; It doesn ' t really matter what you are anymore. &quot; In the study &quot; All in the Family : Religious Mobility in America , &quot; Hadaway and sociologist Penny Long Marler of Samford University in Birmingham , Ala. , looked_at religious switching patterns from 1973 to 1990 based on General Social Survey interviews collected by the National Opinion Research_Center in Chicago . In that period , conservative Protestants , such_as Southern Baptists and members of the Assemblies of God , surpassed Catholics as the group most likely to stay in the religious tradition they were raised in . In surveys from 1988 to 1990 , 83 % of adults raised as conservative Protestants said they remained conservative Protestants , compared to 81 % of Roman_Catholics who stayed in the Catholic_Church . The percentages were nearly reversed in surveys taken from 1973 to 1976 . In the most recent survey , liberal Protestants including Episcopalians and Presbyterians were least likely to stay within the denominational family , with only 63 % of individuals surveyed between 1988 and 1990 saying they remained liberal Protestants . The loyalty rate for moderate Protestants was slightly higher at 67 % . When it comes_to the net effect of religious switching , Hadaway found that all_the nation ' s major religious groups lost members . The net loss ranged from 1 % for conservative Protestant groups to 16 % for moderate Protestant groups , which included the United Methodist_Church and other denominations that have endured dramatic membership losses in the last two decades . Liberal Protestant_denominations lost 2 % , and the Catholic_Church experienced a net loss of 10 % . The big gains from religious switching came_in the &quot; other &quot; and &quot; none &quot; categories . There was an 86 % increase in individuals switching to no religious affiliation in the surveys from 1988 to 1990 . Mormons , Jehovah ' s Witnesses and Christian_Scientists had a net gain of 33 % through religious switching . Sociological trends such_as the decline of the traditional family , one of the &quot; bread-and-butter &quot; constituencies most likely to pass_on the faith to future generations , increases the gravity of the challenges faced by the nation ' s largest churches , researchers said . &quot; The current situation poses serious problems and concerns for all denominations , &quot; Marler and Hadaway say . Sociologists Benton Johnson of the University of Oregon and William McKinney of Hartford Seminary said the study findings are consistent with other research indicating the loosening of religious ties_in the newest generations . McKinney said there are signs that mainline Protestant_denominations , such_as the Presbyterian_Church ( U.S.A. ) and the United Methodist_Church , which were hit with the first wave of steep membership declines showing the weakness of &quot; inherited religion , &quot; are starting to address the issues of passing_on the faith to future generations . Work_on updating church hymnals , developing statements of faith and involving congregations in major church policy pronouncements instead of developing them on high from national headquarters indicate &quot; a new kind of realism &quot; among mainline congregations , he said . But Hadaway and Marler appear to be less optimistic . They say mainline churches have tended to rely_on the children of members and the hope that dropouts will return when they marry , but at_the_same_time have neglected church_school &quot; and other aspects of religious socialization that could help translate those hopes into reality. &quot;</TEXT>
