   <HEADLINE> BATTLE TO CONTROL THE SKIES ; GLOBAL SYSTEMS VIE FOR SPACE ON RADIO_SPECTRUM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A gritty battle for dominance may be about to erupt in the rarefied atmosphere where communications satellites orbit the Earth . Monday ' s official announcement that two high-tech moguls want to use low-orbiting satellites to launch a $ 9-billion global communications_system adds a major new player to the increasingly competitive market for global communications services . Bill Gates , co-founder of Microsoft Corp. , the world ' s biggest computer software company , and Craig McCaw , chairman of giant McCaw Cellular Communications , unveiled their plans to form a new company called Teledesic Corp . Teledesic will seek government authority to use radio_waves to deliver wireless calling , video conferencing and other advanced services to people around the world . But Teledesic is not alone . The National Aeronautics and Space Administration , Motorola Inc. , Hughes Aircraft Co . and at least four other companies have already asked the Federal Communications Commission for approval to offer new telecommunications services over parts of the same precious radio_spectrum sought by Teledesic . &quot; The whole issue of licensing has not been resolved , &quot; said Michael D . Kennedy , director of regulatory relations for Motorola , which is a major investor in the Iridium Project , a $ 3.3-billion effort to build a global portable cellular_telephone network using 66 satellites to transmit signals . &quot; One more party now has to be reckoned with , but we ' re confident that there ' s sufficient airspace to accommodate all existing requests , &quot; countered Tom W . Davidson , a Washington communications lawyer who is shepherding Teledesic ' s applications through the FCC . The radio airwaves have emerged as a key battleground amid the rapid development of new technologies such_as high-definition television , digital radio and wireless_telephone services . The new satellite services will compete with cable and fiber-optic phone_lines for markets as the so-called information highway takes_shape . Interest in the radio_spectrum is so high that the federal_government estimates it can raise between $ 7 billion and $ 10 billion by auctioning space on it for the next generation of wireless_telephone services alone . As for the radio_spectrum sought by Teledesic and others , the FCC has asked_for industry comments on negotiating a resolution on how to divide up the limited space . FCC officials have said they are unsure how they would go_about allocating radio_spectrum for new satellite communications services that have global reach . Congress has given the agency authority to auction space on the spectrum for most new telecommunications to the highest bidder , but so far the FCC has only examined rules for new wireless domestic communications services . The Hughes Spaceway venture would utilize two satellites orbiting 23 # 000 miles above the Equator to offer wireless_telephone , data and some video services in North_America . Iridium would offer similar services around the world relying_on airwaves that the FCC has already provisionally authorized it to use . But Iridium may need some of the disputed frequencies for so-called feeder links to its stations on Earth , FCC officials said . In its voluminous application filed late Monday at the FCC , Teledesic proposed a global communications network that would offer phone , video and data services through 840 satellites orbiting just 435 miles above Earth . The network will face relatively high maintenance costs because the Earth ' s gravity would pull Teledesic satellites out of orbit in less than a decade . Higher satellites , such_as those operated by NASA and proposed by Hughes , have 12- to 15-year life spans . But the low orbit would thwart the brief signal delays that plague conventional communications satellites that operate 23 # 000 miles up . FCC commissioners were out of town Monday and could not be reached for comment . But an aide to agency Chairman Reed Hundt said Teledesic ' s plan could represent an important step toward reaching one of the Clinton_Administration ' s most important policy goals : developing a global information superhighway that would link ordinary Americans with government , industry and schools . Citing a speech Monday in Buenos Aires in which Vice_President Al Gore called_on foreign leaders &quot; to help create a global information infrastructure . . . linking all human knowledge , &quot; Blair Levin , Hundt ' s chief_of_staff , said Teledesic ' s global satellite communications_system &quot; absolutely reinforces the type of things the vice_president is calling for. &quot; Nevertheless , the Teledesic venture may present several complications for regulators . Besides needing FCC approval , Teledesic hopes to forge partnerships with telephone_companies around the world that would be willing to lease space on its network to provide service in a region . Davidson said the company has already been in touch with officials from several developing countries and that their reaction was &quot; very favorable. &quot; However , experts warn that foreign telephone_companies and licensing authorities are not set_up to deal with communications enterprises that cross traditional telecommunications boundaries . Moreover , many foreign telecommunications companies are government-owned monopolies that traditionally have been resistant to outside competition . &quot; Europe is just beginning to open its markets , &quot; said Dimitri Ypsilanti , a telecommunications experts with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris . Crowded Skies Various companies around the world are fiercely competing to build satellite-based mobile telcommunications systems . There are three basic types of systems : low earth orbit ( LEO ) , which are cheaper to launch but last a shorter time in orbit ; medium earth orbit ( MEO ) , which are more expensive but last longer in orbit , and high-orbit systems , which have the greatest longevity and expense . Here ' s a brief rundown on some major satellite projects : Teledesic : A $ 9-billion global communications_system sponsored by Teledesic , a new partnership proposed by Craig McCaw of McCaw Cellular Communications and William H . Gates of Microsoft . It would link hundreds of satellites around the globe into a massive digital_communications network . Iridium : A $ 3.-billion LEO system sponsored by Motorola , expected to begin operation in 1996 . Its fleet of 66 satellites would provide a wireless global communications network . Project 21 : Sponsored by London-based Inmarsat with backing by Swedish communications giant Ericsson . This network of satellites in 70 nations will be linked together to provide global phone_service . Odyssey : An MEO system sponsored by TRW . Its $ 1.3-billion network of 12 satellites wouldcreate a cellular_telephone system in the sky . Globalstar : A LEO system sponsored by Loral and Qualcomm for operation in 1997 . It is a $ 1.2-billion series of 48 satellites that would provide digital_communications . Ellipso : A LEO system sponsored by Ellipsat , a unit of Mobile Communications Holdings . It would provide a $ 250-million digital phone network based on about 12 satellites . Aries : A LEO system sponsored by Constellation Communications . It consists_of about 45 satellites linked to provide telecommunication services .
