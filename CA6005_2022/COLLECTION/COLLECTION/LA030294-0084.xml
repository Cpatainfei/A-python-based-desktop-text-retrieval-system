   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : NEWPORT BEACH ; 2 DOGS BOUGHT FOR POLICE CANINE UNIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Police_Department has purchased two police_dogs for more_than $ 15 # 000 to replace Dingo , a veteran dog who died in January , and Hondo , a second police_dog that is near retirement age . The newly purchased dogs were imported from Europe three weeks ago and sent to a monthlong training session in Riverside , said Newport Beach Lt . Paul Henisey . The money for the new German_shepherd_dogs came from public donations following Dingo ' s death from complications after surgery . And the police_department is preparing to retire Hondo in coming months , leaving it with one dog . The City_Council approved the expenditure Monday night when it approved its consent calendar , a list of routine items voted on as a group . &quot; One of the things we have found is that the dogs are very effective tools , &quot; said Newport Beach Lt . Paul Henisey . &quot; So because of that , and . . . the amount of community support for the canine program , &quot; they decided to bring the canine units back_up to three . Police officials say the newly acquired dogs being trained in commands , operations and search techniques will begin work in April . One of the new police_dogs is from Germany , the other from Czechoslovakia . And , for example , the dog born and raised in Germany learned commands from German handlers . Once it reaches Newport Beach , the canine officers will learn German to communicate with it . Some of the public donations left over have been put into a special account to be used to pay_for training the dogs in narcotics sniffing.BOB ELSTONPOLICE DOGS</TEXT>
