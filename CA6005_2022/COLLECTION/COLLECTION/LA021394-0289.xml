   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE ROAD TO RECOVERY ; REINFORCING FOR THE WORST MAY BE TOO COSTLY PREPAREDNESS : STATE SEISMIC PANEL SAYS NEW REGULATIONS SHOULD EMPHASIZE SAVING LIVES BUT NOT NECESSARILY AVOIDING INTERRUPTION OF NORMAL WORKDAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The head of a state commission charged with strengthening earthquake codes said Saturday that it may_not prove financially feasible to protect buildings fully against the strongest earthquakes that could strike the state . Wilfred Iwan , chairman of the Seismic Safety Commission , said he does not believe the commission ' s mandate from Gov . Pete Wilson is to &quot; prepare the codes for the biggest possible earthquake. &quot; Iwan , a professor of mechanical_engineering at Caltech , suggested that this would cost too_much . He indicated that the code improvements that the commission will recommend by Sept . 1 would have to focus_on protecting lives , but not necessarily on retaining normal workday functions in buildings struck by the most powerful earthquakes possible . Iwan ' s remarks , near the close of three days of hearings at a Van Nuys hotel on the Northridge earthquake , were representative of the moderate tone adopted by members of the advisory commission . Generally , they appeared to endorse strengthening the codes , but they often expressed awareness of costs and political considerations . Lloyd S . Cluff , a Pacific Gas &amp; Electric executive who is one of the commission ' s 15 members , said it was essential that the group complete its report by Wilson ' s Sept . 1 deadline because &quot; this is an election year , and the governor may have only a_few months to implement our advice. &quot; &quot; I ' m not predicting Wilson ' s defeat , &quot; Cluff quickly added . Iwan said partisan politics will not affect the commission ' s work . None of the commission ' s three members who are elected officials attended the half-day session Saturday . Among the missing was Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson , who represents part of the San Fernando Valley . Staff_members said Bernson , who had been present during the first two days of hearings , told them he had a schedule conflict . The commission members decided unanimously to back legislation offered by Assemblyman Rusty Areias ( D-San Jose ) to revive a state homeowners insurance fund that was repealed last year for fear it would have insufficient resources to pay_off homeowners ' losses . Areias ' bill would make the coverage mandatory , which it was not after it was adopted in the wake of the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake . The legislation calls_for charging homeowners an annual premium ranging from $ 25 to $ 75 a year , depending_on the seismic risk in their areas . After a $ 2 # 000 deductible , the fund would pay homeowners up_to $ 13 # 000 for quake damage . Some commissioners noted that if the fund had not acquired sufficient resources by the time a big earthquake hit , the payout would have been prorated according to the money available . The commission set two more days of hearings at an as yet undetermined site in the Los Angeles area on March 2 and 3 , and decided to hire an expert to supervise the project of recommending new seismic codes . Some commissioners suggested that their report try to assign responsibility for living_up_to code provisions and quake preparedness rules that exist . They expressed unhappiness with some Los Angeles school and hospital administrators who during the three-day hearing tried to blame others for preparedness failures . The Northridge temblor was a vertical thrust earthquake generated by a deeply buried and as yet unidentified fault . A commission staff_member said this has generated concern at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , the agency charged with tsunami warnings , that if a similar fault slipped_in so dramatic a fashion in Santa Monica Bay , it could have sent a gigantic wave ashore , with deadly consequences . Richard McCarthy , senior engineering geologist with the seismic commission , disclosed Saturday that NOAA plans to send a team to Southern California to assess the potential for such an event . Only small tsunamis have struck Los Angeles-area beaches in history , and up until now the worst potential for large earthquake-generated waves in the state was thought to be along the North Coast in Humboldt and Del Norte counties , where an eventual mammoth earthquake is expected out_to sea in the Cascadia Subduction Zone . McCarthy said it is possible that plans for sea-bottom tsunami alert stations off Alaska , Washington , Oregon and Northern California could be extended_to Southern California , although he cautioned that warning stations are not enough . He said there must also be substantial education about the danger , and development of beach evacuation plans .</TEXT>
