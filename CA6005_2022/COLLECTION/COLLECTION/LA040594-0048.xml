   <HEADLINE> JUDGE THROWS_OUT LAWSUIT OVER TOWER ; OJAI : JURIST RULES THAT THERE IS NO EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT RESIDENTS ' CLAIMS OF HAZARDS FROM THE WEATHER ANTENNA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A federal judge Monday threw_out a lawsuit by Ojai residents aimed at shutting_down a radiation-emitting weather tower until more health studies are completed . U . S . District Judge Terry J . Hatter Jr . said there is no evidence to support residents ' claims that the government intentionally misled local officials when it described the 98-foot tower as an antenna that would blend_in with the scenery . Hatter , who refused in February to grant an injunction stopping the $ 2.5-million project , also ruled that the government took reasonable_care to ensure that levels of radiation emitted by the tower are safe to nearby homeowners . A lawyer for a coalition of Ojai area residents , who fear that cancer and other diseases will result from exposure to the radiation , downplayed the ruling and vowed to appeal . Dale G . Givner , who also lives near the tower , said the judge was not allowed to consider evidence outside the administrative record compiled by the National Weather Service . &quot; What I wanted to get_across was the lack of due_process and how the government deceived local officials , &quot; Givner said . He said that would be an important issue for appeal . &quot; You can ' t lie and cheat to get what you want , &quot; Givner said . &quot; Why should the government be able to lie and cheat to get what it wants ? &quot; But Assistant U . S . Atty . Donna Everett , who argued the government ' s case Monday , said the weather service did everything required before erecting the tower in the fall . &quot; The court looked and saw that the agency took a hard look_at all_the environmental consequences and all_of the health risks and found there was nothing harmful about the radar to the environment or the people , &quot; she said . &quot; I think these people are more concerned with the aesthetics of it rather than the health effects of it , &quot; Everett said of the Ojai residents . &quot; They just don ' t want it in their back yard. &quot; The Sulphur Mountain weather_station , operating for nearly a month , is one of 165 Doppler radar systems being built by the government as part of a decade-long renovation of its forecasting arsenal . Government officials say the Sulphur Mountain station will replace an aging tower atop the federal building in Los Angeles , as well as provide state-of-the-art forecasting data to military , aviation and weather service workers . &quot; Over the last two storms , it has performed very well , &quot; said Todd Morris , area manager of the weather service office in Oxnard . &quot; It showed us things we ' ve never seen before off the Ventura and Santa Barbara coasts , &quot; Morris said . &quot; This radar is showing us information in great detail , well past Point Conception. &quot; But critics of the tower complain that studies on the health effects of long-term exposure to the radiation have not proved that the system is safe . They say the tower should be moved to a less populated area . &quot; There are 750 # 000 watts of microwave radiation coming_out of this thing , and it ' s been put_in a residential_area , &quot; said Dr. Richard Scribner , a researcher at the USC School_of_Medicine who lives near the tower . &quot; There ' s never been a radar in a civilian population with that much power , &quot; Scribner said . &quot; This is a technology that ' s untested as far as the type of exposure these people will be getting. &quot; Everett , however , said the studies that have been completed have identified no adverse effects from the systems . &quot; There ' s no health hazard here , &quot; she said . &quot; The fact is it ' s benefiting many thousands of people . I think their complaints are really unfounded. &quot; Coalition members , including actor Larry Hagman , do not discount the benefits of the system . Hagman said he was not surprised with Hatter ' s ruling . &quot; that ' s the thing with the government , &quot; he said from his Malibu office . &quot; They keep you in court until they grind you down financially . But we ' re rather tenacious up there in Ojai. &quot; NEXT STEP Residents opposed to the Ojai radar tower have two months to appeal the judgment against their lawsuit . Fund-raisers are planned in the Ojai Valley to continue the legal battle in the U . S . 9th Circuit Court of Appeals .</TEXT>
