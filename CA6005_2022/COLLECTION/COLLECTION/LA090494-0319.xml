   <HEADLINE> WITH SOCIAL INSULARITY , A SENSE OF COMMUNITY IS LOST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; I moved here to get_away from all_of them. &quot; So said a man in the wealthy suburb of Potomac Maryland by way of explaining the lawsuit he and his neighbors had filed against the county government . Was the county proposing to build a half-way house for sex offenders ? A new prison ? To bus in minority students ? No , this &quot; social experiment &quot; was a proposal to build townhouses for_sale at $ 162 # 000 apiece to middle-income families , defined as those with incomes of up_to $ 60 # 000 . His objection was straightforward : &quot; I want to be with people at our income level who can appreciate what we appreciate. &quot; A fellow plan opponent insisted , &quot; A person that makes $ 60 # 000 doesn ' t belong in this neighborhood , &quot; while still another pointed to the sacrifices he and his affluent colleagues had already made : &quot; We pay the property_taxes so that the policemen and firemen and all that can live. &quot; But not , apparently , so they can live nearby . It is hard to know which is more extraordinary : that someone would feel that families making $ 60 # 000 are social untouchables , or that they would feel secure enough in this judgment to share it with a reporter . Though lacking the drama of schoolyard violence or the poignancy of children having children , this story also captures something essential -- and alarming -- about the state of public values . We are rapidly losing something precious to any society . It ' s the idea that we have fundamental moral_obligations to one another ; that while some of us may rise a little faster or slower , the ultimate goal is to all rise together . Most simply , that we are connected -- by interests , values and mutual empathy . If this kind of insularity were limited to the rich , one could just write if off to old-fashioned snobbery . But it is not . Increasingly , Americans at all socioeconomic levels strive to kick_out the rungs on the opportunity ladder beneath them , so others cannot follow . Those remaining below are seen as potential threats or , precisely because of their lower_status , as a source of psychic comfort -- or both at_the_same_time . Those a rung or two higher may draw resentment , even as those up in the clouds escape scrutiny . America ' s sickness is not greed . It is misdirected resentments : at struggling welfare recipients , perhaps , or union_members with good_health coverage . As working-class and middle-class people struggle to make_it , they too often attempt to wall off -- usually figuratively , sometimes literally -- those beneath them . But it ' s futile : As the firemen and policemen of Maryland discovered , there is always someone higher up building a wall between you and them . In the end , everyone loses . America ' s culture of possessive individualism is not wholly bad -- it has produced great wealth and personal freedom . For that matter , solidarity -- when taken_to an extreme -- can itself create much ugliness . After all , no one is taking_to the Florida straits this weekend in a southerly direction . The most concrete , measurable consequence of the decline in community -- and also a contributor to it -- is America ' s great and growing economic inequality . The evidence is now unassailable : Whether you compare the well-paid and the poorly paid , the well-educated and the less-well-educated , or the wealthy and those without wealth , the gap is growing . A new report from the Economic Policy Institute brings more bad news : The current economic recovery is not reversing the trends . It is time not only to face the existence of this inequality , but the reality that it constitutes a political and social choice . We have historically preferred the delusion that distributional outcomes are determined by &quot; free-market forces. &quot; If some people make more_than others , that reflects the different economic_value of their work -- which , in turn , reflects their talent , their effort and -- when we ' re feeling honest -- their luck . But , then , why is the United States so_much more unequal than other industrialized societies ? Why is the gap between the top and bottom wage_earners , for example , nearly twice what it is in France or Germany , which are also free-market economies ? Is the distribution of human talent or effort so different here ? Of course not . These outcomes are politically determined , the result of tax_policies , labor_market organization and more . Two nations , Britain and the United States , responded to slowing economic_growth in the late 1970s with policies designed to reward those who owned property . These same two nations are the only ones to have experienced major surges in inequality . Those who would make a moral claim on behalf of such levels of inequality should do so . I don ' t doubt that many Americans will find them compelling -- though I expect most will not . But let us dispense_with the demonstrably false claim that &quot; human nature &quot; requires it to motivate people . How does society advance equality ? Part of the answer certainly lies_in the realm of institutions and social_policy . A good starting_point would be to make work as rewarding as wealth . The distinction between earned and unearned_income is still made in the tax code , but we have lost sight of its moral and economic meanings . We like to talk a lot about the work ethic , yet we don ' t act consistent with that idea . The tax debate today centers_on whether we should continue to rely primarily on income-based taxes , or move toward a tax on consumption , such_as a value-added_tax . This is just a debate over how to get working people -- coming or going . Yet , conservatives call_for a reduction or elimination of the closest thing we have to a wealth tax , that on capital_gains . Another important step is protecting and strengthening workers ' rights to form unions and bargain collectively with their employers . The percentage of the work_force in unions has declined markedly , down to 11 % in the private sector , and is still falling . Even Business Week has concluded this is bad for the health of the nation ' s economy . In addition to building a sense of community among workers , today ' s unions are also developing a new form of solidarity : cooperation between workers and management in pursuit of stronger companies and a better U.S. economy . The Dunlop Commission , appointed by Labor_Secretary Robert B . Reich , has pointed_out that innovative forms of worker-management collaboration are particularly likely to survive in &quot; unionized settings in which the union is involved as a joint partner. &quot; But this crisis of_values cannot be solved solely by economics and policy measures . There is much talk today of the problem of declining moral values , and the need to teach our children better . Yet , a sense of mutual responsibility and obligation is rarely mentioned in this discussion . It has been so devastated that few even think to call_for its resurrection . America was founded as a monument to fundamental human equality . Once we were the most egalitarian nation on the planet ; now we have become ( outside the Third_World ) among the least . As we strive to return to &quot; traditional &quot; values , let ' s make_sure this is one of them . Maybe Michael S . Dukakis was wrong to oppose requiring recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in public_schools . We could do worse these days -- and do -- than having_young people start each day with a reminder that America is supposed to be &quot; one nation , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all. &quot;</TEXT>
