   <HEADLINE> EX-UNIVERSAL STUDIOS WORKER FILES SEX HARASSMENT LAWSUIT ; COURTS : WOMAN ' S ACTION IS THE THIRD SUCH CASE AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THREE YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A former employee at the MCA / Universal Studios has filed a sexual_harassment lawsuit , alleging that her male supervisors had groped and fondled her and sought sexual favors during her 14 years of employment . The $ 2.5-million suit filed Thursday on behalf of Claire E . Ragge in Los Angeles County Superior_Court also alleged that she reported the harassment to officials at Universal but they ignored her . This is the third sex harassment lawsuit filed against the theme park in three years . As part of an estimated $ 600 # 000 settlement of one suit in October , MCA , the parent company of Universal , agreed to hire an independent consultant to review the company ' s harassment policies . Ragge ' s complaint alleges that her harassment continued until December , when she was suspended indefinitely from her bartending job for a complaint by an unidentified customer and for allegedly arguing with an unidentified employee . &quot; I was being harassed while they were negotiating the settlement in their last case , &quot; Ragge , 35 , said in an interview . &quot; It obviously didn ' t change a thing. &quot; Representatives for MCA / Universal Hollywood , which is owned by the Japanese electronics giant Matsushita Electrical Industrial Co . Ltd. , declined comment . Ragge ' s suit alleged the harassment began in 1982 with one of her supervisors , Peter Muendel , fondling her breasts and crotch , embracing her and rubbing his body against her buttocks . It also alleged that another supervisor , Rick R . Storer , regularly grabbed and pinched her buttocks and once told her during a job performance evaluation that she would have received a better rating if her breasts were larger . Muendel , now the director of food and beverages at the Universal Amphitheatre , and Storer could not be reached for comment at Universal . The suit alleged that complaints to company officials in 1982 caused the alleged harassers to retaliate against her by cutting_back her work hours , withholding bartending supplies in an effort to sabotage her job performance and by isolating her from other women who allegedly endured similar treatment . She filed a sexual_harassment and retaliation charge on March 31 , 1993 , with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the Department of Fair Employment and Housing . Ragge was suspended indefinitely on Dec . 29 . &quot; Universal ' s solution to stopping the problem seems to be to be to just get_rid_of the women who complain , &quot; Ragge said . In addition to MCA / Universal Studios , 36-page suit names Muendel and Storer as well as several Universal executives . In February , The Times reported that more_than two_dozen current and former employees said in interviews that they had witnessed sexual_harassment or were subjected_to misconduct ranging from unwanted advances to groping and &quot; sandwiching , &quot; where two or more men forcibly squeeze a woman between their bodies . The article cited union and company sources in reporting that at least 23 employees -- excluding managers and non-union employees -- have been accused of sexual_harassment since 1990 . Seven were fired or suspended . Universal officials said the park , which employs 4 # 000 people each year , had a strong sexual_harassment policy in place . The alleged harassers tended to be low-level employees and supervisors . Ragge ' s suit comes just six months after MCA paid an estimated $ 600 # 000 in September to resolve another sex harassment case involving former employee Wendy-Sue Rosen and two supervisors , who then resigned . MCA also paid former stage show employee Loretta Miller an estimated $ 100 # 000 in October to close her case , sources said .</TEXT>
