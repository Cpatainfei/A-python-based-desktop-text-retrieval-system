   <TEXT> BEVERLY HILLS : Cigarette vending_machines have gone_up in a puff of smoke in Beverly Hills . This week , the city became the second on the Westside to adopt an outright ban on use of the machines for cigarette sales . The Beverly Hills City_Council voted unanimously Tuesday to join Santa Monica and 98 cities nationwide in eliminating cigarette vending_machines from local stores , restaurants , bars and hotels . City officials said they took action out of concern that the coin-operated vending_machines were easily accessible to youths under 18 , who are prohibited by state law from buying cigarettes . Beverly Hills officials cited a recent survey by the Los Angeles Regional Tobacco Control Community Linkage Project that found a majority of tobacco retailers are willing to sell cigarettes over the counter and through vending_machines to underage youths . &quot; Vending_machines are the first places kids actually buy cigarettes , &quot; said Beverly Hills anti-smoking activist Dr. Trisha Roth . &quot; Although they may_not make_up the biggest sales , it ' s where they make their first purchase. &quot; By making_it harder for children to buy cigarettes , a generation of potential smokers will be stopped , said Patrick Reynolds , an anti-smoking activist who is the grandson of tobacco company founder R.J. Reynolds . Sixty percent of all smokers begin smoking by the age of 14 , said Reynolds , and 90 % of all smokers become addicted by the age of 19 . It is unclear how many cigarette vending_machines are in Beverly Hills because business owners are not required to report them . Beverly Hills officials said they sent notices on the pending vending machine ban to about 400 local restaurants and stores , but no one spoke in opposition to the prohibition during Tuesday ' s council meeting . In 1991 , Santa Monica became the second city in the state to ban the vending_machines . But it has not enforced the law since a similar law enacted in Rancho Mirage came under a court challenge , Santa Monica City Councilman Kelly Olsen said . In June , however , a federal judge upheld Rancho Mirage ' s prohibition on cigarette vending_machines , and Santa Monica plans to begin enforcing its own ordinance , Olsen said . Elsewhere on the Westside , West Hollywood does not ban cigarette vending_machines , but only allows them to be placed in bars , a city official said . Los Angeles and Culver City , meanwhile , neither restrict nor ban the machines . SANTA MONICA : Hoping to drive homeless feeding programs indoors , the Santa Monica City_Council voted this week to regulate charitable meals programs by requiring that food preparation and serving meet strict county health_code standards . The action Tuesday was the latest attempt by politically liberal Santa Monica to reconcile the nutritional needs of the city ' s estimated 2 # 000 homeless with residents ' worries about the presence of large_numbers of homeless people in city parks . The new measure , supporters said , does not prohibit serving food on city parkland . But it gives homeless services a strong incentive to conduct feeding programs indoors because the county food preparation and serving standards would otherwise be difficult to meet . Dozens of people spoke out against the measure , however , with many calling it mean-spirited and saying it would undermine aid to the homeless . One longtime volunteer in the feeding programs , Dr. Gary Spivey , said he believed most charitable organization would not be able to meet the health_code standards -- indoors or outdoors -- and would stop their meal programs . &quot; Starvation and malnutrition are bigger problems than food-borne illnesses , &quot; Spivey said . The Los Angeles County Health and Safety codes set standards for food storage , preparation , handling and transport . They also require that food be maintained at certain temperatures and address the dating and packaging of foods for box lunches , according to the city attorney ' s office . A February , 1993 , city ordinance addressing the feeding of homeless people required that groups had to obtain a permit if more_than 35 people gathered_in a city park . A federal judge overturned that law in April , ruling that it was a violation of 1st Amendment rights . On Tuesday , Mayor Judy Abdo cast the sole vote opposing the new food standards ordinance , commenting that some homeless people may be reluctant to eat indoor . The law is expected to take_effect in late November after it receives a second_reading before the council next week . SUSAN STEINBERG</TEXT>
