   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; RATE WORRIES HURT STOCKS FOR 4TH DAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wall_Street stocks fell_for the fourth straight session Tuesday , as traders grew pessimistic about rising interest_rates and the falling dollar . The benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury_bond has continued to trade above 8 % , raising fears that higher interest_rates could lure investors from stocks and also inhibit corporate profits next year . &quot; There ' s just that fear of rates , &quot; said Jack Regan , market_analyst at Josephthal , Lyon and Ross . The Dow Jones average closed_down 4.71 points at 3 # 850.59 -- bringing_to about 85 points the amount the index has lost since it began falling last Thursday . In the broader market , declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 9 to 5 on the New York Stock_Exchange , where a hefty 326.11 million shares changed hands , up from the previous session ' s 287.64 million . The Treasury ' s bellwether long-bond yield remained stuck at its 2 1 / 2-year high of 8.04 % . Its price ended down 1 / 32 point , or 31 cents per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . Shorter-term Treasury securities ranged from unchanged to 1 / 16 point lower , the Telerate Inc. financial information service reported . &quot; The fact that they ' ve broken_through ( 8 % on the long bond yield ) and held through it just worries people a little more , &quot; said Marshall Acuff , portfolio strategist at Smith Barney . &quot; Today was a spillover from yesterday . A continually weak bond market is continuing to put pressure on the equity market , &quot; said Acuff . The falling dollar also added pressure , since it is a sign that foreign investors are leaving U.S.-based assets . The dollar hit a fresh post-World War II low against the Japanese yen and a new two-year low against the German mark . It closed_in New York at 96.83 yen , down from 97.13 late Monday . The dollar also was changing hands in New York at 1.495 German marks , up from 1.494. Dealers said the dollar is likely to continue downward until a change in fundamentals , such_as an increase in U.S. interest_rates or a sustained rally in_stock and bond prices , attracts buyers . Stock and bond markets have been weak for several days amid signs that growth in the U.S. economy isn ' t slowing_down enough to prevent resurgent inflation . Investors are waiting for the Federal_Reserve_Board to make its next move to raise interest_rates , hoping that the central_bank can once-and-for-all get a handle on rising prices . Inflation erodes the value of fixed-income investments like bonds , which pay a fixed interest_rate over months or years . The Fed ' s chief weapon against inflation -- raising rates -- can hurt stocks because rising rates make corporate borrowing more expensive and make shares less attractive compared to safer investments like certificates_of_deposit . Brett Discher of Dain Bosworth said the dollar , bonds and stocks have been moving_in a &quot; chain reaction. &quot; The dollar weakness spills_over and depresses bonds , which then have a negative influence on stocks . Among the market highlights : Economically sensitive stocks were among the weakest , reflecting concern about growth in the economy if interest_rates continue to rise . Among the 30 stocks that make_up the Dow average , Alcoa fell 1 1 / 8 to 85 1 / 8 and International Paper gave_back 1 5 / 8 to 75 1 / 4 . * Mobil surged 3 to 83 1 / 4 on news the company plans to further restructure its operations . Dean Witter upgraded the stock to strong buy from accumulate . The interest_rate uncertainty pushed_down big cyclical stocks , which rise and fall with the economy . Paper companies were down , such_as Georgia Pacific , off 2 1 / 4 to 73 ; along with chemical companies including Dow Chemical , down 1 5 / 8 to 73 1 / 4 . * Mexican telecommunications company Telefonos de Mexico tumbled 3 1 / 8 to 57 3 / 8 in heavy trading after reporting disappointing nine-month earnings late Monday . * Other Mexican stocks sank along with Telmex and the Mexico_City Bolsa plummeted 55.24 points to 2 # 578.38 .</TEXT>
