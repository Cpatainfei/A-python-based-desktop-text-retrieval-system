   <HEADLINE> CLASSIC OF THE WEEK : JOHN CALE &quot; PARIS 1919 &quot; ( 1973 ) REPRISE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of the great benefits of the compact_disc revolution is that hundreds of underappreciated -- indeed , previously deleted -- albums have been given new life . Among them : John Cale ' s &quot; Paris 1919 , &quot; an inspired , sometimes elegant work , arguably the iconoclastic Welshman ' s most accessible effort.Some of the melodies here are so rich and enticing that it ' s hard to understand why this album didn ' t make more of a commercial dent when it was released more_than 20 years ago . The opening &quot; Child ' s Christmas in Wales , &quot; for instance , is an instantly inviting dose of upbeat pop laced with a tad of bluesy rock ' n ' roll courtesy of some members of Little Feat . Still , there is a striking complexity to much of the material here . The elegiac &quot; Endless Plain of Fortune &quot; is flavored by artfully arranged strings , horns and percussion , and the exotic , hypnotically moody title track has a similar classical-pop coloration ( a founding member of the Velvet Underground , Cale is a classically trained musician ) . Lyrically , &quot; Paris 1919 &quot; also is far more sophisticated than the average pop album ; Cale tells poetic , occasionally cryptic tales ( talk_about literary : two of the tracks are called &quot; Macbeth &quot; and &quot; Graham Greene &quot; ) . Yet rather than sounding stuffy , Cale ' s words tend to interlock naturally with his compellingly melancholy ( if technically limited ) baritone . JON MATSUMOTO</TEXT>
