   <HEADLINE> THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON AND JAMES BATES : COMPANY TOWN ; FOR ROY DISNEY , LEGACY IS EVERYTHING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Michael D . Eisner installed the Seven Dwarfs atop Team Disney headquarters in Burbank as enduring symbols of the company ' s heritage , he might just as well have added the image of Roy E . Disney . The painfully shy and enigmatic executive with the uncanny resemblance to his Uncle Walt has a habit of popping_up at critical junctures in the company ' s history to somehow help sway events his way . Roy Disney ' s fingerprints were all_over the management coup that ushered_in the Eisner-Frank G . Wells regime 10 years ago . Now he ' s helped to derail the ambitions of Wells ' would-be successor -- studio Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg . &quot; Roy ' s a very clever , skillful man , &quot; one associate said Thursday . &quot; He ' s not openly aggressive , but he always gets what he wants . Maybe the cardigan sweaters lull people. &quot; Sources close to the company say that from the start , Disney was openly hostile to Katzenberg succeeding Wells as president . As a close friend of Wells , he resented Katzenberg ' s intense lobbying for the corporate post . But even before that , the Disney heir and Katzenberg were_on troubled ground . Sources say the two executives rarely if ever spoke in their 10 years together and that Disney , whose job includes overseeing the animation department , zealously guarded from Katzenberg ' s eyes his work_on the sequel to the animated classic &quot; Fantasia. &quot; Katzenberg loyalists attribute Disney ' s actions to jealousy , saying he was intimidated and overwhelmed by the studio chief ' s gale-force energy and intense interest in the animation business . &quot; Roy Disney doesn ' t run animation , &quot; one Katzenberg friend said . &quot; He ' s on a boat in Ireland half the year. &quot; But Disney told friends that the dispute boiled_down to Katzenberg ' s ego . In conversations in recent years , he repeatedly complained that the studio chief was hogging all_of the credit for the spectacular success of animated features such_as &quot; The Lion King &quot; and &quot; Aladdin. &quot; It may have been to Roy Disney ' s benefit that Katzenberg ' s all-star executive and news media schmoozing skills did not extend_to corporate politics . Sources say the studio chief never bothered to develop close personal ties to the members of the board , which undercut his chances of overcoming Disney ' s opposition . * Despite Katzenberg ' s phenomenal success in managing the Disney studio operations -- annual filmed entertainment operating income alone rose from $ 2.2 million in 1984 to $ 622.2 million in 1993 -- Eisner and the other board_members shared Roy Disney ' s reservations about putting the studio chief in a corporate role . Sources say Disney ' s behind-the-scenes work -- augmented by the vociferous anti-Katzenberg rhetoric of director Stanley P . Gold , who heads the Disney heir ' s Shamrock Holdings -- clearly greased the path for Eisner to push Katzenberg out the door . Board_member Raymond L . Watson said Thursday that Disney &quot; has a legitimacy that comes from both the amount of stock he owns and his heritage , &quot; adding , &quot; When he speaks at the board_meetings or speaks_to animators , they know this is not just a paid executive but someone whose life has been nurturing the company. &quot; At 64 , Disney holds the title of vice_chairman of the board , but his role is much more expansive than that . He demanded and received the job of supervising animation in the 1980s , when Eisner and Katzenberg wanted to scrap the division . He has since become a trusted adviser to Eisner , who sees in him a non-threatening corporate presence who also carries the prized family_name . &quot; Michael has gone_out of his way to give Roy his dignity , &quot; said one source . &quot; He ' s been loyal to Roy for bringing him to the company , and he ' s been a smart politician. &quot; Sources say the pair ' s bond has grown even stronger since the company was shaken by two dramatic recent events : Wells ' death in a helicopter crash in April and Eisner ' s emergency quadruple heart bypass surgery last month . Disney rushed in from his seaside castle in Ireland to be at Eisner ' s side , and a company statement pointedly named him as Eisner ' s stand-in . * It was an unaccustomed moment in the sun . Despite inheriting Walt Disney ' s physical features , Roy has practically none of his late uncle ' s famous charisma , close friends readily concede . Puffing on an ever-present cigarette , he can usually be found holding_up the wall at corporate events . One entertainment analyst says Disney has played no visible role in the company ' s investor gatherings in recent years , though Eisner and Wells may have been throwing him a bone at the annual meeting in Florida earlier this year when they allowed him to make the formal announcement that the company was finally releasing the animated &quot; Snow White &quot; on videocassette . At the same time , sources say Disney has become more vocal at board_meetings and that his opinions are taken seriously by colleagues . Aside from his work_at the family store , he has profited handsomely from Shamrock Holdings , the investment_company led by Gold . The firm made a fortune buying and selling soybean-processing giant Central Soya . * While he has cut_back on his work schedule the last three years , people close to Disney say his passion for protecting the company ' s legacy is what keeps him going long after he could have retired on a nest_egg valued at $ 540 million . His ties to and love of the company ' s animation date_back to before Eisner , Katzenberg and most other Disney executives were even born . Roy ' s mother inked and painted animation cels of Mickey_Mouse while she was pregnant with him . As a boy in the 1930s , he watched &quot; Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs &quot; 20 times while it was moving through the production process . At age 7 , he was too sick in bed one day to attend a &quot; Snow White &quot; screening . So Uncle Walt dropped_by to try_out a story on him about a puppet named Pinocchio that he was thinking_of making into a film . Roy Disney , whose father co-founded the studio while never drawing anywhere near the attention of Walt , later went_to work_on the Burbank lot as a film editor , producer and writer . But he was resented be some colleagues because of his family connection and derided by others as the &quot; idiot nephew &quot; for his diffident and uncommunicative style . Even while serving on the board before the 1984 power shift , he rarely said much in meetings , something friends now attribute to the overall lack of respect he was accorded then . That changed drastically 10 years ago , when Disney and Gold engineered the ouster of the company ' s beleaguered management team in favor of Eisner and Wells , who orchestrated one of the most successful turnarounds in U.S. corporate history . While Disney spends much of his time at his vacation_home in Ireland , sources say he is still involved in the day-to-day operations of the company ' s vaunted animation department , which was supervised by him , Katzenberg and animation chief Peter Schneider before the recent upheaval . * People close to the studio say it was Roy Disney who pushed the company into paying_for the expensive automated equipment that allowed its animators to move_into the modern age . Responsibility for success or failure is always a murky thing in Hollywood . But on the creative side , one executive describes the Disney heir as &quot; a big-picture guy , &quot; whereas Katzenberg focused_on the finer points of character and script development . &quot; No one plays the bully role in animation . It ' s too collaborative for that , &quot; said one source . &quot; But Roy puts_forward ideas . He ' s very creative , he gives great notes and he ' s certainly no idiot . It ' s not just by luck that all this this has happened to him. &quot;</TEXT>
