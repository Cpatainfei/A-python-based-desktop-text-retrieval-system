   <HEADLINE> U.S. TURNS UP THE HEAT ON VIOLATORS OF LABOR LAWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Labor_Department said Wednesday that it had stepped_up efforts to prosecute businesses for violating labor laws and vowed to continue the crackdown as part of a larger effort to improve the lot of the American worker . &quot; The legitimate businesses in this country have an interest in making_sure that the bad actors are vigorously prosecuted , &quot; Labor_Secretary Robert B . Reich said in a press_conference called to outline his department ' s accomplishments in 1993 and goals for 1994 . &quot; No good and responsible business in this country should have to compete with businesses that gain competitive advantages by violating labor law. &quot; Reich said such indictments against businesses had nearly doubled last year -- from 42 to 78 -- and he cited numerous examples of successful prosecutions for a host of infractions , including violation of child-labor laws and safety regulations and failure to pay employees . Chief among the successful enforcement actions for which he claimed credit were : * A first-of-its-kind $ 600 # 000 settlement in a &quot; glass-ceiling &quot; case involving 52 female workers near the top of the pay scale who had sought promotions at Fairfax Hospital in Virginia . * A record $ 16.2-million wage and child-labor law settlement with Food Lion supermarkets . * An increase in indictments from 49 to 102 in connection with violations of health and welfare-benefits laws . Reich also said his department was responsible_for a 12 % increase -- to $ 34.5 million -- in money paid to settle discrimination cases . He said the enforcement efforts go hand-in-hand with other programs to retrain displaced workers , provide more job security and create higher-paying jobs . Reich also listed several initiatives he hoped to begin this year , including creation of a series of job centers that would provide job counseling , job-search assistance and retraining . Plans also are under way for a jobs summit in March , Reich said , in which representatives from the world ' s seven largest industrial nations would gather_in Washington to discuss ways to create new jobs .</TEXT>
