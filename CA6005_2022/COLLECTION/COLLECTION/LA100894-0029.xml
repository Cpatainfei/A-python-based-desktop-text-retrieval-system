   <HEADLINE> NEVER A DULL MOMENT IN ZHIRINOVSKY ' S RUSSIA ; EUROPE : NATIONALIST SEEKS U.S. VISA , PARALYZES PARLIAMENT . NO MATTER WHAT HE SAYS , HIS RATINGS REMAIN JUST HIGH ENOUGH THAT HE can ' t BE IGNORED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He destroys Parliament sessions with a single tantrum ; pays friendly state visits to North_Korea and Iraq ; vows to sire children in every Russian province , and now , he may be coming your way . Vladimir Zhirinovsky , the ultra-nationalist demagogue who shocked the world with his strong showing in December elections , plans to visit the United States next month , he announced Friday -- if , that is , he is granted entry . His visa request is now being considered by the State_Department , but it appears likely that the United States will join France , Germany , Switzerland , Slovenia , Norway and Spain , all_of which have denied the motor-mouthed populist entry in the last year . No matter . Zhirinovsky believes that a visa denial by U.S. authorities would only add_to the personal popularity that brought his party top scores in voting last December and continues to hold steady despite his failure to fulfill any of his wild election promises . &quot; The greater the resistance we meet , the more popularity we will have , &quot; he said . &quot; Without such resistance from authorities , we would n ' t have been able to get as far as we have. &quot; Meanwhile , Zhirinovsky is wreaking enough havoc at_home to make_up for all_the scandals he did not have a chance to create abroad . On Friday , he and his party members walked_out_of the Duma , the lower house of Parliament , and gathered enough support from other factions to paralyze the body indefinitely just two days into its autumn session . He also declared that he and his followers will no longer consider themselves signatories to the Civil Accord , a formal pledge to maintain the peace signed by hundreds of parties , groups and unions last spring . &quot; The cup of patience is overflowing ; we have to react , &quot; Zhirinovsky , his hair cut super-short to reveal a bullet head sweating freely in the stuffy hall , told reporters at the Duma . The 48-year-old lawyer ' s cup apparently overflowed Sunday when he and more_than 20 other deputies from his inaptly named Liberal Democratic Party were trying to fly to North_Korea to visit its new leader , Kim Jong Il . According to Zhirinovsky , his plane was supposed to stop for refueling in the Western Siberian city of Kemerovo , but the local governor rolled fuel trucks across the runway , blocking it . At the last minute , Zhirinovsky said , he called_off the landing and the plane barely made_it to the city of Tomsk , its fuel so low that the deputies faced &quot; mortal danger. &quot; The Russian Transport Ministry is investigating the incident , but Zhirinovsky said a government report will not satisfy him ; he called_for a change of Cabinet , particularly the resignation of Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev , whom he accuses of hampering his travel abroad . Zhirinovsky has been up_to all kinds of shenanigans since he was elected , from fisticuffs with a fellow lawmaker in the Parliament ' s lunchroom and with a traffic_cop on a central Moscow street to wild threats against Japan and Germany . But , seemingly no matter what comes_out of his mouth , Russian polls show that his ratings remain fairly steady , with a core of support that ranges between 5 % and 20 % of the population -- never high enough to give him a shot at the presidency in 1996 but never low enough to laugh_off . The magazine Stolitsa offered a recent analysis of Zhirinovsky ' s appeal , saying his aggressive stance reflects &quot; a sublimated feeling of fear , the kind of fear that gives one a sense of loneliness and defenselessness in a hostile world . And these days , the majority of Russians share this sense. &quot; A survey by the Mneniye polling service in July showed that , if elections were held now , President Boris N . Yeltsin would garner about 11 % of the vote , followed by economist Grigory Yavlinsky with 9 % and former Vice_President Alexander V . Rutskoi with 7 % . Zhirinovsky would come_in fourth with about 6 % , close to his performance in the 1991 presidential elections . Although he may_not be a contender , his corps of angry-young-man followers , his support among the dispossessed and his ability to foment a perpetual brouhaha keep other Russian politicians watching him warily . &quot; Zhirinovsky is a serious phenomenon from any point_of_view , &quot; Communist leader Gennady A . Zyuganov said . &quot; I think he has gained popularity as the situation in the country gets_worse and worse. &quot; &quot; His current position is no less firm than it was_on Dec . 12 , &quot; concurred Lev Ponomaryov , a prominent member of the reformist Russia ' s Choice . &quot; Yes , he is a force . To ignore him would be a mistake. &quot; He is a force , and he may be multiplying . Already the father of one son , Zhirinovsky proposed last month that he sire children in every region of Russia as his contribution to stopping the country ' s negative population growth . In 1995 , according to the Liberal Democratic Party press service , Zhirinovsky wants every region to &quot; witness the birth of at least one baby directly from the chairman of the LDP &quot; in_order to counter the &quot; disastrous demographic situation. &quot; Zhirinovsky has yet to clarify whether he plans to found his own sperm_bank or visit each of the regions in_person .</TEXT>
