   <HEADLINE> GRIM DETERMINATION ; USING CONFRONTATION TO RAISE AWARENESS OF BREAST_CANCER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was a grim sight . Stacked high in a Bel-Air garage were hundreds of plaster torsos cast from breast_cancer survivors . But for Jane Alsobrook , part of a group of breast_cancer activists preparing to display the torsos in Westwood last weekend , aesthetics were never the point . &quot; This was never meant to be an art project , &quot; said Alsobrook , who is a breast_cancer survivor . &quot; This is meant to be a political ( statement ) . It ' s for all women with breast cancer. &quot; Alsobrook is a director of the Los Angeles Breast_Cancer Alliance , the first grass-roots breast_cancer advocacy group in Los Angeles . The 2-year-old alliance , headquartered in West Los Angeles , undertakes a range of projects . But perhaps its most dramatic is its &quot; War Mammorial , &quot; the display of plaster torsos . This year ' s exhibit ( the first was held last year in the San Fernando Valley ) took_place outside the Federal Building in Westwood last weekend -- the start of Breast_Cancer Awareness month . The sight was sobering . The plaster_casts , taken from women who had gathered over the last year in &quot; casting parties &quot; throughout Los Angeles , were lined like tombstones along the Federal Building lawn on Wilshire Boulevard . The display was intended to draw attention to the 1 # 350 breast_cancer deaths expected in Los Angeles this year . The alliance , with a 15-member board of directors and more_than 1 # 000 people on its mailing_list , is nonprofit and decidedly grass roots . Its goals , however , are lofty . The group wants increased funding for breast_cancer research and access for all women to high-quality breast_cancer screening , diagnosis , treatment and care . The alliance also seeks to &quot; create public awareness of the breast_cancer epidemic and make its eradication a national priority , &quot; one of its brochures says . Although it is disputed whether breast_cancer is an epidemic , the American Cancer Society estimates that this year 46 # 300 ( 46 # 000 women and 300 men ) will die of breast_cancer nationwide . There is no known cause , cure or prevention for the disease . Most of the group ' s members are breast_cancer survivors , and although many have full-time jobs , breast_cancer advocacy has consumed their lives . Women and men in the group say they have adopted the head-on tactics of some AIDS activists . The &quot; War Mammorial &quot; is certainly not subtle , with some casts taken from women who have undergone mastectomies and are missing one or both breasts . Although some have voiced their discomfort with the graphic nature of such installations , alliance members are enthusiastic . And unapologetic . &quot; Women were dying of politeness and shame , &quot; Alsobrook said . The plaster casting sessions also allow breast_cancer survivors and their families to talk_about their fears , share information and feel comfortable with their bodies , participants say . Joanne Eacrett said : &quot; The fact that these women are so committed to the cause ( that ) they let their bodies be seen and touched . It is a very moving experience and makes me recommit myself. &quot; Along with other breast_cancer activists , two alliance members , Alsobrook and Michelle Rakoff , met with President and Mrs . Clinton and Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala last October to discuss a comprehensive breast_cancer research plan . The lobbying efforts of the National Breast_Cancer Coalition , formed by activist groups that include the alliance , have paid_off . The amount of federal breast_cancer research funds increased from $ 90 million in 1991 to $ 410 million in 1993 . Currently , the alliance is compiling an anthology of personal stories from breast_cancer survivors . The group plans to send the book , &quot; A Living Legacy , &quot; to policy-makers in Washington . Such efforts , group members say , will continue until the country mobilizes against breast_cancer . &quot; I was afraid of growing old , &quot; said Eileen Brabender , president of the Alliance ' s board of directors , in her opening speech last weekend . &quot; But I have had breast_cancer , and now I am angry that maybe I won ' t grow old . So I want this war to be over for all_of us . I want us just to go_home and grow old -- victorious and in peace. &quot;</TEXT>
