   <HEADLINE> OFFICERS SALUTED FOR RISKING THEIR LIVES ; LAW_ENFORCEMENT : SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE LAPD ARE AWARDED THE MEDAL OF VALOR FOR THEIR HEROIC ACTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They braved flames inside a burning apartment_building to save a boy and his uncle . They dodged gunfire in a shootout to save a 12-year-old hostage . They stopped a man who in a rage held a gun to his own baby ' s head and threatened to pull the trigger . For these brave deeds , seven Los Angeles police_officers Wednesday received the department ' s highest honor -- the Medal of Valor . In a ceremony attended by more_than 600 police_officers and community leaders , Police_Chief Willie L . Williams hailed the men as heroes . He also used the opportunity to counteract some of the criticism that has besieged the department since the Rodney G . King beating and the 1992 riots . &quot; These awards are special , especially with all_the problems and concerns that have been heaped upon . . . this department , &quot; Williams said . &quot; It ' s nice when the larger community can take time_out and say , ' Thank you. ' &quot; Among those honored at the gathering at the Westin Bonaventure hotel were several of the department ' s sharpest shooters , a grizzled veteran who thought he had seen it all and a rookie who had seen very little . Hundreds of Los Angeles police_officers were considered this year for the award , but only the seven officers met the most important criteria : All put their lives in danger to help others . These are their stories : It was_after midnight Aug . 24 , 1992 . Officer Peter Casey had only been with the department about a year when he and his partner , Ernest Jimenez , saw flames shooting out of an apartment complex in South-Central Los Angeles . The two men smashed their way through the building ' s locked doors and windows to give the residents a means of escape . They shined their flashlights down blackened hallways and yelled for victims to &quot; follow the light to safety. &quot; Casey and Jimenez climbed onto the second floor of the burning building after residents told them an 8-year-old boy and his uncle were trapped inside . On his hands and knees , Jimenez , 31 , made his way through thick smoke until he reached the boy , who was passed_out on the floor . &quot; I picked him up and ran , &quot; Jimenez said . Meanwhile , Casey , 31 , found the boy ' s uncle nearby and carried him to safety . &quot; The floor was actually burning beneath us , &quot; Casey said . &quot; You could actually hear the walls breathe . that ' s when it hit me , ' Why am in here ? ' It ' s something I still dream about . I don ' t think it is something that will ever leave my mind. &quot; The next day the Police_Department and the two officers were credited with saving 18 lives . &quot; I don ' t feel_like a hero , &quot; Jimenez said before receiving his medal . &quot; I guess I just feel lucky to have been there to get the people out. &quot; On April 30 , 1993 , award recipients Hilton Henry and Stephen Kehoe found themselves trying to arrest a robber under extraordinary circumstances . Henry , 31 , had seen the suspect walking with a gun on Western Avenue in Hollywood . As Henry drove toward the man , the suspect ran_into a residential_area and grabbed a 12-year-old girl playing in a yard . Placing a pistol to the girl ' s head , the man said he would shoot if Henry did not drop his gun . As the officer retreated , the suspect made a dash for Henry ' s unattended car and drove_off with the girl . While Henry ran after the car , Kehoe , 50 , arrived to provide backup . The officers exchanged more_than 45 rounds of gunfire with the suspect , crashed the car and was arrested . The girl escaped unharmed . The award recipients included three members of the LAPD ' s SWAT team . On the morning of Oct . 20 , 1992 , Officers Robert Bennyworth , 48 , Joe Cordova , 39 , and Ruben Ornelas , 37 , were called_in to assist in a hostage situation . A man who had spent the night using cocaine had stormed into his wife ' s apartment and grabbed his 3-year-old daughter . For several hours , the man fired shots at police_officers and reporters and dared police to take action as he threatened again and again to kill &quot; the baby. &quot; Finally , SWAT officers decided that the man was going_to kill the child if someone didn ' t kill him first . Officers stormed the apartment and found the man in a bathtub , where he was holding the girl in front of his face and screaming , &quot; I kill baby ! I kill baby. &quot; They officers begged him to pause for a moment , pleading with him to put the girl down . The man hesitated and peered around his daughter . From seven feet away , Cordova fired one_shot . The bullet struck the man beneath the eye , killing him instantly . &quot; I know it ' s a cliche , but we were just doing our job , &quot; Ornelas said .</TEXT>
