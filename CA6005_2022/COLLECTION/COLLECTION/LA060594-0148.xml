   <TEXT> I made_good pay as a merchant_marine , transporting freight , grain and ammunition from New York to Scotland or England . I would have never thought_about joining the Navy because the pay was nowhere as good . But after a German submarine_torpedoed our ship in the_English Channel , my parents became worried about me making trips across the Atlantic without any protection . So I joined the Navy to please them . I enlisted on Aug . 11 , 1941 , and helped put the Henrico in_commission in New Jersey that fall . It was a cargo_ship converted into an army transport_ship . At times , we carried as_many as 5 # 500 soldiers . I stayed with the Henrico as a first-class cook throughout the war . We were off the coast of Scotland for six weeks before D-day . We would load_up troops and take them out for training at night . We would put them in small landing boats and teach them how to get_out of the ship , rendezvous and then come_back to the ship . We stayed there until June 4 and then went_to Plymouth , England , and loaded_up a whole_lot more troops and ammunition . Us Navy guys knew we were going_to hit a beachhead in France for a good week in_advance of D-day . But we didn ' t know where until we left for Normandy the night of June 5 . We didn ' t care where the invasion was going_to be or what was going_to happen . We just wanted to go_out and do_it . We sent the first wave out of the ship at 5:30 in the morning . The landing boats , carrying 55 to 65 soldiers each , would rendezvous in a circle with a flag boat . After the red flag went_up , they would head toward the beach . When they got close enough , a green flag would go_up and that would mean hit that beach . They announced over the loudspeakers they wanted volunteers to take the second wave in . I was off_duty at the time , so I said to the first-class butcher , &quot; Let ' s go. &quot; I volunteered to be the coxswain to steer the boat . The butcher was a deckhand and we got another kid to be the engineer . There was no shelling on the first wave and we heard very little activity . Some shooting and firing but nothing serious . So we went_out there and started toward the beach . The Germans must have woke_up and they threw everything at us . It was like salt and pepper raining all around you with bullets flying . You didn ' t stop to look_at them , either . You kept your concentration on going_in and kept your head down . We were only about three miles offshore , but it took about an hour and a half to reach the beach because the waters were so choppy . You just didn ' t drive_in there slowly . You poured the fuel to that engine and gave her full throttle to make that boat go as fast as that thing would fly through the water . When you went_in , you didn ' t go_in a straight_line . You kept weaving , so if the Germans tried to aim on you , they missed . But coming_back , you went_out straight as fast as you could back to your ship . When we got_back , that ' s when all hell broke_loose . I didn ' t volunteer a second time to take boats in . That was enough for me . By the time you got_back to the ship , you were really shook_up . As the day went_on , the fight got heavier on both sides . Shells were always flying and they were getting pretty darn close to us , too . It must have been hell on the beach . I just lucked out we didn ' t get hit . Everybody was shaky and you didn ' t know when a shot would hit you or sink your boat . We cooked six hours on and six hours off and only got three to four hours of sleep . We brought_back a lot of injured troops and put them in sick bay . They would keep them there and transport them to England . But a lot of them only got nicked or shot . They could patch them up and send them back_out . We were off Normandy for four days . By then , the battle was over . We went_back to the United States and stayed here for 15 days and went_out to the Pacific . The Normandy beachhead was the biggest battle Americans figured that the United States had . But to us , it wasn ' t . Guam was . Those Japanese suicide bombers had no mercy on us . Our ship got hit by a suicide plane carrying a 500-pound bomb . The butcher and I were the only two men on that side of the ship to come_out alive . I was bounced around like a rubber ball , but I got_up and started rescuing people from the water . We couldn ' t get them all and lost a lot of them to sharks . I was given the Purple Heart . When I received the award , the Navy captain asked me why I didn ' t smile . I said , &quot; Sir . You don ' t know how close I came_to getting the Black Heart. &quot; When we finally got_to San Francisco . . . doctors discovered I had 25 ulcers from the size of a pin to a nickel . My weight dropped from 180 to 125 pounds . A lot of times the cramps and pain would hit so hard , I wish I could have died . I was rated as 80 % disability and discharged . I wanted to stay in the service for 20 years and tried to re-enlist , but they would n ' t let me . They told me , &quot; You ' re half dead , it ' s time for you to go home. &quot; I was in the Navy for three years , two months and 18 days and don ' t regret any moment of it . If it weren ' t for the invasion on the Normandy beachhead , we ' d be under a dictatorship , walking under Japanese or German flags now . It was something that had to be done to save your loved ones and your country .</TEXT>
