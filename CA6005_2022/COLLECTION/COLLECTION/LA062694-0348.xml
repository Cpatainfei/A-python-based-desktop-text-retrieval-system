   <TEXT> When voters decided in 1988 to slap an extra 25-cents-a-pack tax on cigarettes , they also launched an unprecedented experiment in persuading California smokers to kick the nicotine habit . Funded by the anti-smoking initiative , Proposition 99 , the programs mix public persuasion , including a brass-knuckled ad_campaign , with political action , promoting local laws to banish smoking from work sites and public places . Admirers say that no government anywhere in the world has attacked smoking with such vengeance -- or results . The programs are widely credited with helping reduce cigarette consumption in California by 27 % in the last five years -- a faster drop than anywhere else in the nation . But the state ' s assault on tobacco has raised hackles among smokers rights advocates and some politicians , who say the programs go_far beyond the initiative ' s provisions and the voters ' intentions . The arguments over Proposition 99 have heated_up again because the law that details how the tax money should be spent is expiring Friday . Within the next few days , the Legislature and governor must decide whether to renew the programs as they are , expand the anti-smoking efforts as_many health groups want , or redirect millions of dollars to health_care programs for the poor that are threatened by the state ' s deepening budget crisis . Whatever California decides will be watched closely around the country . As concerns about secondhand smoke have risen , several states have begun to imitate California ' s aggressive anti-smoking programs . The Proposition 99 cigarette tax has collected $ 3.1 billion over the last five years and the initiative broadly specifies how the money should be spent . To date , about two-thirds has gone_for health services to the poor . At least 20 % is designated for health education and 5 % for research . Critics say too_much of the money has gone_to what they regard_as government-paid lobbying to restrict the use of a legal product . Defenders say the growth of health_care programs for the poor threatens to gobble_up cash needed for the nation ' s most effective anti-smoking campaign . At the center of the debate is how the state_Department of Health Services has used the $ 213 million doled_out to communities and health groups for programs that encourage teen-agers to shun smoking and that promote local anti-smoking ordinances -- in_effect , using tax money to generate political action . An additional $ 73 million has been spent on an often witty , sometimes vituperative media campaign that depicts tobacco_industry executives as cynical purveyors of death for a profit . Also on the table for examination is $ 136 million used for research , some of it to examine the tobacco_industry ' s campaign contributions and lobbying activities . These few studies have been used to criticize politicians for caving_in to tobacco interests . It is clear that Proposition 99 ' s aggressive programs exceed anything spelled_out in 1988 by the initiative or by its backers -- a coalition of doctors , hospitals , nonprofit health agencies and environmental groups . In writing the initiative , these groups agreed that portions of the new cigarette tax would be divided among the various causes they supported . The doctors and hospitals wanted health_care for the poor ; the environmentalists wanted to expand wildlife habitats , and the nonprofit agencies wanted programs to reduce tobacco use . The proposition ' s language does not discuss advertising_campaigns or the formation of advocacy groups to mobilize public support for smoking bans . It simply called_for &quot; programs for the prevention and reduction of tobacco use , primarily among children , through school and community health education programs. &quot; The programs ' champions say the media campaign and the political activity are exactly what voters wanted -- finding innovative ways to attack smoking -- and reflect a growing intolerance of a dangerous and addictive substance . Using the Proposition 99 tax in the name of public health , state tobacco control officials say they have set_out not to outlaw tobacco , but to &quot; de-normalize &quot; its use . &quot; Our goal is to put the tobacco_industry out of business , &quot; said Colleen Stevens , who heads the state ' s media campaign . Stevens and other state officials cite statistics to show that their approach has worked . Per capita consumption in California has dropped at a rate almost three times faster than the rest of the nation since 1988 , according to a state-funded study by UC San Diego professor John P . Pierce . Pierce and others suggest that the tax increase , the paid advertising and community programs have all helped to cut smoking , although it ' s unclear which programs are most effective . ( One disappointing finding : overall smoking among teen-agers has remained fairly constant in California . But in the rest of the country , it is rising. ) Critics contend that health officials have overstepped their bounds by funding efforts to initiate local anti-smoking ordinances . Others argue that some expenditures have been just silly -- citing a scientific study of whether smoking causes facial wrinkling and subsidies for tobacco-free ski events for children and teen-agers . The ads that try to deglamorize smoking and alarm people about the dangers of secondhand smoke are especially irritating to smokers rights groups . As might be expected , the spicy mix of programs and in-your-face tactics has angered a lot of people -- not only smokers and tobacco executives but also politicians . UC San Francisco professor Stanton Glantz , who has used a Proposition 99 research grant to assess the impact of tobacco_industry campaign contributions on legislators , has angered Assembly Speaker Willie Brown ( D-San Francisco ) . In a series of reports , Glantz singled_out Brown for taking almost $ 500 # 000 in contributions from tobacco interests since becoming Speaker in 1980 -- more_than any other politician in the country . In an incident reported in Harper ' s magazine earlier this year , Brown was quoted as telling University of California executives : &quot; If this guy gets one more cent of state money , you ' ll be in_trouble with me ! &quot; In a recent interview , Brown denied that he ever sought retaliation against Glantz , but he said that a study of campaign contributions was a misuse of Proposition 99 money intended to investigate tobacco-related disease . &quot; The research done_by these gentlemen ( Glantz and his UC San Francisco colleagues ) doesn ' t deserve to be classified as research , &quot; Brown said . &quot; It ' s what we in politics do to each other when we ' re running for election. &quot; Glantz ' s tobacco tax grant has expired and his proposal for a new one was turned_down by a UC-appointed review committee . In an unsuccessful appeal of that decision , Glantz challenged the qualifications of the reviewers , one of whom questioned whether Glantz could ever show a direct causal link between campaign contributions and legislative tobacco policy . Glantz , who does not believe that politics played a role in the state decision , has won a National Cancer Institute grant to continue his work . Bob Merrell , who heads an organization called Californians for Smokers ' Rights , argues that the state_Department of Health Services-run program is illegally spending tax money to lobby local_governments to pass ordinances that bar smoking in the workplace . &quot; Big Brother is stepping_in and saying , ' No , you can ' t do_it ( smoke ) , ' &quot; said Merrell , a dedicated smoker . Merrell has sent legislators lists of state-funded anti-tobacco programs that sound frivolous or suggest that tax money is being used &quot; by Department of Health , Tobacco Control Section , to build and operate a statewide political organization. &quot; The accusations by Merrell and others have won_over supporters in the Capitol . Assemblyman Curt Pringle ( R-Garden Grove ) has proposed amending state law to bar the use of Proposition 99 tax money to promote &quot; the passage of any smoking law or ordinance. &quot; The number of cities and counties with anti-smoking ordinances has almost doubled since the initiative ' s passage to nearly 300 . Pringle also wants a truth in advertising standard applied to ads paid_for out of the tobacco tax account . But a number of legislators have joined forces with health groups like the American Lung Assn . to defend the state programs . Sen . Tom Hayden ( D-Santa Monica ) , whose Campaign California organization helped pass Proposition 99 , says the initiative has been an unmitigated success : &quot; A million fewer people are smoking and on their way to preventable and premature death as a result of that proposition. &quot; Hayden had high praise for a recent research report by UC San Francisco ' s Glantz , titled &quot; The Twilight of Proposition 99. &quot; The study , like others that infuriate Speaker Brown , shows contributions to individual legislators and then grades them on their anti-tobacco stance . ( Glantz asked &quot; eight individuals knowledgeable_about the Legislature and tobacco policy &quot; to rate the legislators but will not reveal who they are. ) &quot; I ' ve never seen an analysis like that in a state-subsidized document , &quot; Hayden said . &quot; They account_for every penny of every ( industry ) campaign contribution and to whom . Unbelievable. &quot; Anti-smoking groups agree with Glantz and Hayden that the state ' s most effective -- and controversial -- anti-smoking programs are in mortal peril . Americans for Nonsmokers ' Rights complains that education programs have been short-changed by almost $ 170 million , and the group has sued to return the money to programs that directly combat smoking . Even with the alleged shortchanging , more_than $ 300 million has gone_to the state_Department of Health Services ' tobacco control efforts ; $ 146 million has gone_to the state ' s schools . Glantz calls the department ' s tobacco control program &quot; the most effective public health intervention since the invention of sewers. &quot; With unabashed anti-tobacco fervor , a small cadre of public health workers oversees the state ' s war on tobacco . In addition to the advertising_campaign , the weaponry includes grants to nonprofit agencies and funding for the anti-smoking efforts of 61 local public health offices . &quot; The media program is the air cover , and we ' re the ground troops , &quot; said Carol Russell , who oversees local anti-tobacco programs for the state office . Traditional attempts to discourage smoking -- cessation classes that feature lectures on the destructive effect of tobacco on health -- have failed to do the job , Russell says . So the state has turned_to unorthodox attempts to fight tobacco -- often battling the tobacco companies on_their_own turf with advertising and sponsorship of glamorous events . As a result , there have been controversies . The state office , for example , has been blasted for the skiing program it has funded at the Kirkwood Ski Resort in Alpine County . Similarly a $ 200 # 000 grant to the Bay Area Cancer Coalition was used in part to sponsor a Tobacco Free Challenge race_car over three racing seasons . &quot; We ' re going where the ( tobacco ) companies are and they hate us for it , &quot; Russell said . Equally controversial has been the use of state money to form tobacco-fighting coalitions and to support local health departments in the push for local smoking bans . In San Francisco , the local health department last year plastered the city with signs saying &quot; Support Smokefree Legislation . Call the Board of Supervisors Today. &quot; At the bottom of the sign , the printer added the words , &quot; This sign will be removed by the committee after the election , &quot; a phrase added_to political posters . Two weeks later , the supervisors began to consider a citywide ban on smoking in the workplace , which was later enacted . State health officials say there is a distinction between general advocacy of sound public health policy and the lobbying of legislators , supervisors or city_council members on specific proposals . And in a February memo , the state tobacco control office told local health departments that the tax funds &quot; are not and may_not be used to support lobbying activities. &quot; &quot; Public health has always had a responsible role in policy development , &quot; Russell said . &quot; We ' ve seen it in the chlorination of water_supplies and the vaccination of dogs. &quot; And with projects like California Smoke-Free Cities , the state is providing technical assistance to local agencies that are considering anti-smoking ordinances . Today , partly as a result of the state effort , about 44 % of Californians live_in communities that restrict smoking in restaurants or workplaces . &quot; We ' re hurting them , &quot; Russell said , &quot; We ' re hurting these ( tobacco ) companies. &quot; One result : California ' s anti-smoking programs are proving to be contagious . Several states are considering higher tobacco taxes to launch their own programs . In 1992 , Massachusetts approved an initiative similar to Proposition 99 . Candace Pierce-Lavin of the American Cancer Society says : &quot; We saw that trying to tackle tobacco problems in traditional ways was not solving the problem , and we saw tremendous progress out there in reducing smoking rates. &quot; NEXT : How should the Proposition 99 money be spent in the future ? Proposition 99 The 1988 anti-tobacco initiative , Proposition 99 , doubled the state tax on cigarettes , raising it by 25 cents a pack . The initiative required that the money be divided among several broad categories : 20 % for health education , 5 % for research , 5 % for wildlife preservation , 45 % for physician services and hospital_care for the poor , and 25 % in an unallocated account that can be used for any of the other purposes . Here is how the $ 3.1 billion raised by the initiative has been used since the added tax went_into effect on Jan . 1 , 1989 : * Health education ( tobacco control programs ) : $ 447 million ( 15 % ) * Health education ( maternal and child programs ) : $ 166 million ( 5 % ) * Tobacco disease research : $ 148 million ( 5 % ) * Wildlife preservation * : $ 213 million ( 7 % ) * Medical_care ( hospitals , physicians and unallocated ) : $ 2.1 billion ( 68 % ) * In 1990 , voters approved Proposition 117 , the wildlife protection initiative , which required that 2.5 % of the Proposition 99 tobacco tax be taken from the unallocated fund and used for programs to protect mountain_lions and other threatened species .
