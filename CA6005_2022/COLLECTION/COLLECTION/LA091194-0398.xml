   <HEADLINE> IRA JAIL BREAKOUT RATTLES PEACE PROCESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Five members of the_Irish Republican Amy tried to shoot their way_out of a high-security jail , shaking the fragile Northern_Ireland peace process , authorities said Saturday . The British government and the IRA said the foiled escape did not constitute a breach of a 10-day-old cease-fire in Northern_Ireland , but Protestant nationalists insisted that the incident spelled the end of the truce . The prisoners , including a sixth inmate not affiliated with the IRA , used a smuggled pistol in the Friday night jailbreak attempt at Whitemoor Prison in Cambridgeshire , about 110 miles north of London . They shot at pursuing prison_guards , wounding one , then scaled a 35-foot wall using knotted sheets . Guards with attack_dogs chased down four of the inmates ; a police helicopter cornered the others within two hours . Home_Secretary Michael Howard ordered an inquiry into the attempted jailbreak , particularly as_to how weapons were smuggled into the prison . But Prime_Minister John Major ' s office struck a cautious note , declining to comment on the state of the cease-fire but hinting that the incident would not be a major obstacle to peace . In Belfast , Sinn Fein , the IRA ' s political arm , issued a statement saying the escape attempt &quot; in no way &quot; violated the truce that began Aug . 31 , halting a bloody quarter-century campaign against British rule of Northern_Ireland . But Peter Robinson , vice_president of the militant Democratic Unionist Party , said that &quot; the attempt to kill prison officers and guards means the cease-fire has come_to an end. &quot; &quot; This incident shows that the IRA has not abandoned violence , &quot; said Ken Maginnis of the moderate Ulster Unionist Party . &quot; It is a stark reminder that , amidst the euphoria , the IRA remains an active , scheming and dangerous organization and its members are still prepared to use weapons and explosives to achieve their ends. &quot; The IRA inmates are : Paul Patrick Magee , 46 , serving a life sentence for murder and attempted murder ; Liam McCotter , 31 , serving 17 years for conspiracy to cause explosions ; Gilbert MacNamee , 33 , sentenced to 25 years for conspiracy to cause explosions , linked to a 1982 blast that killed four military_band members in a London park ; Peter Sherry , 39 , who was sentenced for life for his part in bombing a Brighton hotel where the Conservative_Party was holding its annual conference in 1984 , and Liam O ' Dwyer , 32 , serving 30 years for making bombs . The sixth prisoner is Andrew Russell , 32 , who was serving 10 years for various offenses including aiding and abetting a 1987 escape . In the earlier escape , Russell hijacked a helicopter and forced it to land inside a prison area allowing two prisoners to jump aboard and flee . He was arrested two months later . On Saturday , British government officials said they were unlikely to oppose Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams ' application for a U.S. visa because American authorities have expressed willingness to grant one . Instead , they said they hope to persuade Washington to impose &quot; sensible &quot; conditions on the visit in_order to prevent Adams doing anything that , in British eyes , would impede the peace process under way to end 25 years of sectarian violence in Northern_Ireland .</TEXT>
