   <HEADLINE> NO CHARGES TO BE FILED IN PASSPORT SEARCH CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The independent counsel who was named to investigate alleged election-year tampering with the passport files of an Oxford_University student named Bill_Clinton said Thursday that he would not file any criminal charges in the case . &quot; The investigation is over and there aren ' t going_to be any indictments , &quot; said Joseph E . diGenova , a former U.S. attorney here who was appointed two years ago to investigate the_matter . His lengthy report on the investigation reportedly will clear several State_Department aides who served under President George_Bush and were accused of searching through passport records for partisan political purposes . But diGenova refused to discuss the details of his findings until a special three-judge panel receives his final report . &quot; I hope to file the report ( on the investigation ) by the end of the year and , once the court releases it , I can discuss it in detail . But I am authorized to say we won ' t be bringing any charges , &quot; he added . Late in the 1992 campaign , rumors surfaced that Clinton , while studying in England , had traveled_to the Soviet_Union with the intent of renouncing his U.S. citizenship to protest the Vietnam_War . Clinton said during the campaign that the rumors were false . According to the State_Department ' s inspector_general , several employees at the State_Department ordered a search of Clinton passport files from the late 1960s to see if damaging information could be found on the Democratic presidential nominee . Other reports said that White_House officials under former Secretary_of_State James A . Baker III , who was then running Bush ' s reelection campaign , also had inquired whether any damaging details could be found in Clinton ' s files . Several of the accused officials admitted that they had indeed ordered a search of the passport files , but that they did so only because reporters had filed a Freedom of Information request seeking travel information . After a 21-day investigation , Inspector_General Sherman M . Funk concluded that several State_Department aides had violated government regulations by ordering the search , but he also said that they did not violate criminal_laws . Funk also dismissed the allegation that there was an organized White_House effort to dig_up damaging information . Funk reported his findings to outgoing Atty . Gen . William P . Barr , who in December , 1992 , appointed diGenova to investigate whether any criminal_laws were violated . Reached by phone , Funk , who is now retired , said that diGenova ' s two-year investigation appears to have confirmed his initial inquiry . &quot; We found there was no organized conspiracy at the White_House , that the controls at the State_Department had broken_down and that people had tried to embarrass the Democratic candidate for political reasons , &quot; Funk said . &quot; But this didn ' t violate any particular law. &quot; He also said he was mystified by reports that diGenova would use his final report to criticize the inspector_general for unfairly damaging the reputation of the State_Department aides . &quot; I find that strange . I did what the law required me to do . I turned the information over to the attorney_general , &quot; he said . &quot; I also can ' t understand why it took him two years to do what we did_in 21 days. &quot;</TEXT>
