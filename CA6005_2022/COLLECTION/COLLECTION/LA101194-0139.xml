   <TEXT> Magma Board Urges Shareholders to Reject Bid : San Diego-based Magma Power Co . said it found California Energy ' s $ 840-million tender_offer inadequate , describing it as an attempt to acquire Magma at a price that is &quot; less attractive to Magma and its stockholders than remaining independent. &quot; Last Thursday , California Energy began offering $ 35 cash per share for the first 51 % of Magma ' s outstanding shares as part of an overall per-share acquisition price of $ 25 cash and $ 10 in California Energy stock.In a release , Magma criticized the tender ' s &quot; coercive &quot; feature of offering all cash only to the first 51 % of shareholders and said the bid is overly conditional and &quot; does not remotely reflect Magma ' s intrinsic value and long-term strategic promise. &quot; Magma operates seven geothermal energy plants in the Imperial Valley . Officials at Omaha-based California Energy , which operates six geothermal plants in the state , were not available for comment .</TEXT>
