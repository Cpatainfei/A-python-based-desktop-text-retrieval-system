   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; RWANDA REFLECTS CHANGES IN AFRICA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For two months , the world has looked_on with horror at the genocidal killing in Rwanda . But , in testimony to the limits of outsiders ' power , no international effort has been able to stop it . &quot; Enough of this blood , &quot; pleaded Pope John Paul II , and from Washington and London to the capitals of Africa , similar calls have echoed across the bloodied Rwandan countryside . But they have stopped not a bullet nor saved a life . Now , with the Rwandan Patriotic Front closing in Friday on Gitarama -- seat of the interim government -- and battling a defiant but crumbling army in the capital , Kigali , a rebel victory seems increasingly likely . Most human_rights groups -- even those with no particular affinity for the rebels -- would welcome such a victory as the fastest way to stop the appalling massacre of civilians . When Kigali falls , it will join Kampala , Uganda , in 1978 , and Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , and Mogadishu , Somalia , in 1991 , as the only African capitals in recent times to succumb to a rebel army . Kigali ' s collapse will be a reminder of how much has changed in Africa since the not-so-distant days when European powers were willing to rush in troops to prop_up their former colonies . Britain always stood ready to guarantee the stability of Kenya and still conducts military exercises here . France used troops at least a dozen times to stave_off coups in its former African colonies ; a decade ago , Paris might well have sent combatants into French-speaking Rwanda , whose military France armed and advised . As often as not , the mere landing of European troops in Africa was sufficient to restore order . But in Rwanda the world has done little more_than shed a tear and shrug helplessly . Rwanda ' s two former colonial masters , Germany and Belgium , have declined a U.N. request for help . Only three African_nations -- Ethiopia , Senegal and Ghana -- have agreed to participate in an African peacekeeping force for Rwanda . But their offer of 2 # 100 troops fell far short of the 5 # 500 soldiers that the United Nations requested , and it was never clear who would pay_for the mission . What is apparent from the world ' s reluctance to enter Rwanda , Western diplomats say , is that governments realize that there is little they can do militarily to pacify dedicated , warring factions unless they are willing to bring_to_bear the full power of their guns . In Somalia , they weren ' t ; the lesson was a painful one . Somalia started as a humanitarian mission , just as any effort in Rwanda would . But when , inch by inch , the peacekeepers ' military resolve was tested -- as it surely would be in Rwanda -- the U.N. response was at first confused and timid . The more undefined the response became , the bolder the belligerents grew , until , in the end , they came_to understand that none of the governments in the peacekeeping force had national interests they were willing to stand and fight for in Somalia . The same scenario could be repeated in Rwanda , the most destitute_of African_countries . Although the world will remain morally haunted by its passivity , the fact is that politically , economically and militarily , Rwanda is a country that holds importance for not a single nation , except perhaps for neighboring Burundi . With peace talks between the rebels and the army having broken_off in Kigali on Thursday and no future sessions planned , that leaves the international community to hope that one side or the other will achieve military dominance , thus ending the slaughter . But even if the predominantly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front defeats the Hutu-controlled army , African observers are less than confident that Rwanda ' s troubles will be over . These observers debate whether 63 years of peaceful colonialism created Rwanda ' s problems or merely contained longstanding animosities . But they agree that , since independence in 1962 , neither group has shown itself willing to accept anything less than domination over the other .</TEXT>
