   <HEADLINE> THE SON NOW SHINES IN FATHER ' S ' PROPAGANDA ROOM ' ; BROADCASTING : UCLA PROFESSOR FOLLOWS IN PARENT ' S FOOTSTEPS AS DIRECTOR OF VOICE OF AMERICA TO BRING U.S. NEWS TO A CHANGED WORLD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Geoffrey Cowan was a child , the library in his home_in Connecticut was called the &quot; propaganda room &quot; because it was stocked with great works about the forces that shape public_opinion . What the books said , his father Louis G . Cowan explained to him , was that there is only one way to influence people : tell the truth . Louis Cowan was able to put that creed into practice . From 1943 to 1945 he was the second director of the Voice of America , the United States ' most famous government-run news arm , which provides radio_broadcasts in native languages and English to countries around the world . Fifty years later it is the younger Cowan ' s turn . A UCLA professor , author and playwright , Cowan , 51 , in_effect took_over the propaganda room earlier this month when he became the 19th director of the Voice of America . He is beginning the job at a time of great change for the U.S. radio voice , which was created to combat the totalitarian thought-control machinery of Nazi Germany and later the communist regimes of the Cold_War . In an interview recently in his office , Cowan outlined his three main tasks as the head of one of the world ' s largest news organizations . One is to take_advantage of new technologies ; the second is to find new ways of distributing the news and information that Voice of America already produces for its 1 # 000 hours a week of broadcasts , and the third is to define the station ' s role in the post-Cold War era . Cowan -- who is_on leave from UCLA -- also will have to help cut about $ 20 million from Voice ' s annual budget to $ 244 million . Voice broadcasts news about the United States and the outside world to 46 countries in English and 45 countries in other languages . But because it is government run , Voice is barred from broadcasting in the United States . The other two U.S._government news organizations , Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe , were created to deliver news to people behind the Iron_Curtain about events in their own countries . Radio Liberty broadcasts to Russia and the former Soviet republics , Radio Free Europe to the rest of Eastern Europe . Cowan argued that events since the end of the Soviet_Union in 1990 demonstrate that the &quot; VOA is at least as important as it was during the Cold War. &quot; First , he said , a number of countries still have repressive regimes that control the news , including Haiti , China , Myanmar ( formerly Burma ) , Tibet and the former Yugoslavia . Beyond that , &quot; we are living_in a period of what one historian calls ' turbulence , ' an unsettled period of ethnic hatred , fierce nationalism and confusion about values. &quot; In some countries , including Russia and even Germany , &quot; the possibilities of democracy and fascism &quot; coexist , competing for power . In such a world , Cowan argued , Voice of America has the potential to be one of the country ' s most eloquent demonstrations of democratic values , providing accurate , balanced and comprehensive information as well as news about American concerns and policy positions . Despite Cowan ' s philosophy about accuracy and honesty , however , most Voice news_reports tend to be different from those of commercial news organizations , if only because they tend to emphasize American policy rather than to point_out conflict or to look_for potential problems . Cowan has a background well-suited to the challenges of new technology . He noted that Voice of America has just moved onto Internet , the free computer_database system , that will make its scripts available in all languages to anyone with a computer . Cowan may represent a return to tradition , compared with some of his recent predecessors , who were more intrigued by television than he is . Cowan thinks there is something about the character of radio that makes_it better for communicating ideas . &quot; Although PBS television is a great service , &quot; he said by way of analogy , &quot; if you wanted to influence minds in America , National Public Radio would probably be more effective. &quot; In his career as an attorney and professor , Cowan has focused_on communications . A graduate of Harvard and of Yale Law_School , Cowan was a public-interest lawyer whose work led to several landmark Federal Communications Commission decisions and to a teaching job at UCLA , where he helped found the school ' s Communication ' s Law Program and more recently became director of the Center for Communications Policy . He is the author of two books , including &quot; See No Evil &quot; about television censorship , and more recently &quot; The People v . Clarence Darrow : The Bribery Trial of America ' s Greatest Lawyer. &quot; He is a playwright , the author of &quot; Top Secret : The Battle for the Pentagon Papers , &quot; and also a television producer , whose &quot; Mark Twain and Me , &quot; a two-hour movie_starring Jason Robards , won an Emmy Award in 1992 . Cowan chaired the commission that wrote Los Angeles ' ethics and campaign finance law .</TEXT>
