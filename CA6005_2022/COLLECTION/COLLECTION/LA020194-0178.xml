   <HEADLINE> WASHINGTON BACKS U.N. PLAN FOR BOSNIA AIR SUPPORT ; BALKANS : SECRETARY OF STATE CHRISTOPHER ' S DECLARATION DRAWS U.S. A STEP CLOSER TO COMBAT OPERATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States supports a proposal by U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to use U.S. and allied air_power to help open an airport in Bosnia for aid flights and to relieve a beleaguered Canadian peacekeeping unit , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said Monday . By offering seemingly unqualified backing for Boutros-Ghali ' s plan , Christopher drew the United States a step closer to combat operations in the Balkans . The secretary_general said last Friday that he was ready to call_for allied air strikes to punish Serbian guerrillas if they interfere with U.N. efforts to rotate the garrison at Srebrenica or to reopen the airport at Tuzla . Both towns are crowded with desperate Muslim refugees who have fled fighting elsewhere in Bosnia-Herzegovina . &quot; We ' ve endorsed that report , &quot; Christopher told reporters . &quot; That could lead to the use of air_power if there ' s not an agreement for the replacement of the Canadian troops at Srebrenica or for the opening of the airport at Tuzla. &quot; President Clinton and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl discussed the Bosnia conflict Monday during a 1 1 / 2-hour working lunch at an Italian restaurant in Washington ' s Georgetown neighborhood . But U.S. officials discouraged speculation that the discussion -- or talks scheduled for later this week with British and European Union leaders -- was aimed at forging a new policy to counter French efforts to pressure the Muslim-led Bosnian government into accepting a peace settlement that would ratify territorial gains registered by Serbian and Croatian militias during the bloody ethnic war . Nevertheless , Christopher and other State_Department officials have made no secret of their distaste for the_French approach of applying pressure on the Bosnian government , which Washington considers to be the victim of Serbian and Croatian aggression . Before meeting with Clinton , in an address to the National Governors ' Assn . in Washington , Kohl urged the United States to continue its leadership role in world affairs and said that there is a need for a strong European defense_policy . &quot; The evil_spirits of nationalism are not only at_large in the Balkans , &quot; Kohl said . The &quot; unfortunate signs that war has not yet been banished &quot; make creation of a European security policy &quot; more important than ever. &quot; Later , Kohl indicated he would support U.N. efforts to stop the flow of Croatian troops across the border into Bosnia . At a news_conference , Kohl said he could not confirm that such movements were taking_place . But if they were , he said , he would disapprove &quot; very severely and find a way to ( put ) my disapproval into practice. &quot; At the same time , Kohl repeated his nation ' s opposition to sending outside ground troops into the conflict . That would create &quot; an incredible blood bath , &quot; he said . Boutros-Ghali ' s plan for Srebrenica and Tuzla is a complex combination of diplomacy and force . It is designed to permit relief flights to the isolated Tuzla enclave and to replace the Canadian unit in Srebrenica with a larger Dutch contingent . Both towns were designated by the United Nations as &quot; safe areas &quot; for Muslim refugees but are targets of steady Serbian bombardment . Under Boutros-Ghali ' s proposal , the United Nations would negotiate with the Serbs in an effort to obtain their agreement on a cease-fire to permit the relief of Tuzla and Srebrenica without opposition . If the Serbs agree , U.N. forces would carry_out the operations , backed by NATO air_power , which would be ready to strike in case the Serbs go_back_on their promise . Even if the Serbs do not agree to a cease-fire , Boutros-Ghali said , the United Nations might attempt the operations anyway , protected by allied air cover . State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the Clinton_Administration agrees with Boutros-Ghali that the United States and its allies have the authority to provide close air support for U.N. troops without further authorization by either the Security_Council or NATO ' s North Atlantic Council . But , McCurry said , air cover_for Srebrenica and Tuzla may take some time to organize .</TEXT>
