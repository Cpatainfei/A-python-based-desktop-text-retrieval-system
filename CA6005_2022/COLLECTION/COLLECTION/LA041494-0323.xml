   <HEADLINE> EARTHWATCH : BUILDERS PUT WELCOME_MAT OUT FOR NEW ECO-HOUSES ; WEST COAST INTEREST IS RISING OVER TOPICS LIKE SUSTAINABLE LANDSCAPES , HEALTHY HOMES AND ENERGY-EFFICIENT CONSTRUCTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> All of a sudden in the building business it ' s fashionable to be environmental . Up and down the West Coast from Vancouver to Ventura County ' s patch of Malibu Hills , there have been sightings -- much more substantial than the Elvis sort -- of environmentally friendly building projects under way and also lots of environmental seminars for major builders and architects . Considering the number of invitations I have received by mail or fax , I could have spent every one of the past 90 days kibitzing at conferences or playing looky-loo at various eco-homes -- and never left the Pacific_time zone . A few situations were irresistible . I don ' t know what has happened recently in towns other_than quake-damaged Los Angeles that might be causing this increased interest in energy-efficient construction and retrofitting , drought-tolerant planting and use of recycled building_materials . But such is the case . Last week , a delegation from our county , including members of Ventura County ' s chapter of the American Institute of Architects , trekked up_to Santa Barbara to share ideas with experts from around the nation on topics such_as eco-villages , sustainable landscapes , adaptive reuse and creating healthy homes . Those are code words for the various approaches to building on the planet without ruining its health and our own . One of the participants , Julie Shular , who is building her own house in our county , attended a seminar she called &quot; The Green Team and the Design Process. &quot; The formal title of the panel , indeed the title of the whole Santa Barbara shebang , was &quot; Designing for Sustainable Communities. &quot; Shular isn ' t an architect , but rather an owner-contractor . She went_to the symposium to discuss the fine points of building what she sees as &quot; a 21st Century environmental home , &quot; which will be constructed on her Houston Road property in Ventura County near Malibu . Her architect is Paul Bierman-Lytle , internationally famous proponent of resource-and-energy-thrifty homebuilding . This involves solar-powered heating and cooling , recycled materials such_as plastic and steel , and landscaping that is both lovely and resource efficient . &quot; I tend to be a realist about what ' s possible , &quot; Shular said of her project , which has passed muster with the Ventura County Planning Department and is about to be submitted to the Building and Safety Department . If you ' re interested in seeing and getting inside a home with these features , and don ' t mind a drive_up the coast , there ' s an opportunity this weekend to satisfy your curiosity . Fifteen &quot; eco-homes &quot; are being opened_to the public as part of an organized architectural study tour in San Luis Obispo , which will give you an idea of what may become mainstream in the 21st Century . And if you can ' t wait 57 months until the millennium arrives , you can buy one of the eco-houses being shown on the tour . Or , if you are planning a move farther north , check_out Davis , where there is an entire eco-friendly subdivision called Village Homes . While in Northern California , I also learned of yet another indicator of the eco-trend . This past Monday , the Pacific Stock_Exchange began trading issues in a Ukiah-based company called Real Goods . &quot; RGT.P , &quot; as it is listed , sells the hardware to make your home eco-perfect . The stock appreciated 50 % in its first day on the market . I mean , is this eco-building stuff a trend , or what ?
