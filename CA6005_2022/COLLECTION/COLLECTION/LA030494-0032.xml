   <HEADLINE> MASSACRE IN MOSQUE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The tragic events in Hebron on Feb . 25 mark a black day in the history of the Middle_East . In the first instance this atrocity is , of course , a tragedy for the Palestinian people , but it is also a tragedy for the Jewish people . While some may attempt to depict the perpetrator as irrational and capricious , it is reasonable to assume that Baruch Goldstein operated with a clear understanding of the human scale and the historical significance of his horrendous deed . First by choosing to act_on the Jewish holiday of Purim , Goldstein was distorting the historical legacy and meaning of that festival . The scroll of Esther relates that on this day the Jews of Persia were empowered to defend themselves from the threat of annihilation . Goldstein exploited this account to justify his wanton destruction of the lives of scores of innocent victims -- worshipers in a sacred place on a sacred day . Moreover , by choosing to undertake this massacre in Hebron , Goldstein was desecrating the memory of the Jewish martyrs of that city , themselves religious men and women who were mercilessly slaughtered in 1929 while preparing_for the onset of the Shabbat . Although he may have thought himself an avenger of the 1929 pogrom , Goldstein in fact was endangering the lives of Jews , Muslims and Christians in the Middle_East , and undermining the prospects for peaceful coexistence in that region . DAVID N . MEYERS Asst . Professor of Jewish History , UCLA RABBI CHAIM SEIDLER-FELLER Director , Hillel Jewish Center , UCLA * The massacre of Arabs at prayer in the mosque at Hebron by an Israeli settler -- and the continuing slaughter of Arabs by Israeli soldiers in the aftermath of the massacre -- may have been triggered by the act of a lone Jewish terrorist . But this horror is unquestionably the direct result of Israel ' s illegal occupation of Arab lands . It is the ugliest of reminders that the true obstacle to peace in the West_Bank and Gaza remains the Israeli occupation and , particularly , Israel ' s policy of expanding its borders by putting increasing numbers of Jewish settlers in occupied Palestine . We remind our fellow Americans that Israel ' s occupation is illegal under international_law , defies the United Nations , and contradicts repeatedly expressed U.S. policy regarding the conflict . For 46 years , we have sometimes watched but most of the time put our support behind the aggressor in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict . What America needs are a President and a Congress who , in the face of potent political pressure , will summon the courage to do what is right . DONALD S . BUSTANY , President American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee , Los Angeles Chapter * The Anti-Defamation League is saddened by the needless killings committed by a fanatic individual at a mosque in Hebron . Extremists should not be allowed to disrupt the path toward peaceful coexistence between Jews and Arabs . We affirm our unwavering support for the peace process and the efforts of the Israeli government to ensure the security of all who live_in Israel and the territories . PAUL FISHBEIN , Chair ADL Regional Board , Santa Ana * The reporting of the events surrounding the mosque massacre exposed a double_standard in journalism . Absent in the articles are the terms &quot; Jewish terrorism &quot; and &quot; Jewish fundamentalism , &quot; the probable sources of this and similar tragedies . The media , on the other hand , do not hesitate to label any violent acts committed by Muslims as terrorist with likely connections to an international conspiracy -- claims that are usually unsubstantiated . Before the dead have been buried and mourned , the international community is reacting by increasing security against presumed fears of retaliation . It is as if they cannot tolerate the image of Muslims as victims but want to perpetuate the stereotype of Muslims as terrorists . We condemn all violent acts committed against innocent civilians in the name of religion . We equally abhor the recent attack on Catholic worshipers in Lebanon . We call_for increased security for the Palestinians who are largely defenseless against the armed settlers and an obviously biased Israeli army . This could be provided by U.N. soldiers who could at least protect worshipers at the mosques , churches and synagogues in the Holy_Land . We support the desire of the Palestinians for self-determination and concur that progress cannot be made without addressing the issue of the settlements in the occupied territories . MAGDY ELETREBY , Chairman Islamic Center of Southern California * The murder of dozens of Arab worshipers in Hebron was an atrocity . The Kach party ' s fascist ideology is a perversion and degradation of Jewish values . Nevertheless , despite our pain and shame , it is worthwhile to bear_in_mind these points : -- Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin immediately , sincerely and without prompting condemned the killings as &quot; a loathsome criminal act of murder. &quot; In contrast , Yasser Arafat still refuses to discipline or condemn Palestinians who attack Israelis , despite his obligation to do so under the Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles . -- In view of the continuing Palestinian violence against Israelis , Palestinian demands that all settlers be disarmed cannot be taken seriously . Similarly , calls_for expulsion of the settlers violate the principle that the final status of the territories remains subject_to negotiation . Israel yearns for peace , and continues to strive for peace . Peace can be achieved only if acts of violence and terror from any side are condemned by all sides . PAUL KUJAWSKY Tarzana * It is Israeli national policy to establish a Palestinian state and to live_in peace with the Palestinians . But when a Jewish extremist commits an atrocity designed to subvert that policy , Paul Conrad responds by defiling the star_of_David ( Drawingboard , March 1 ) . Conrad does not respond by defiling the cross when a Catholic extremist commits an atrocity in Serbia , or by defiling the star and crescent when a Muslim extremist commits an atrocity in Iran , even though extremism is national policy in these nations . Compassion for the victims , not more extremism , is the appropriate response to the tragedy in Hebron . Conrad ' s failure to recognize this is a scar on The Times . ROBERT N .
