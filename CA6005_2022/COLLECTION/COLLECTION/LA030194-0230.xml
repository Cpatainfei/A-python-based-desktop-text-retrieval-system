   <HEADLINE> FROM FITNESS FAN TO SURE SLOTH ; MANY EX-HARD BODIES ARE NO LONGER HOISTING THE BARBELLS , WHICH ARE GATHERING DUST ALONG WITH GYM SHORTS AND DIET BOOKS . THEY ' RE PLUMB TIRED OF THE WORKOUT AND MENU-CONTROL ROUTINE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two years ago , Dr. Mark Aranbasich was the poster guy for healthy living . He worked_out four or five times a week , took aerobics classes , lifted weights and didn ' t let too_much fat creep into his diet . Then &quot; It &quot; happened . He stopped working_out . &quot; I wish I could say that it was because I was injured or I attained my fitness goal , &quot; says the Los Angeles dentist , &quot; but it was just a matter of laziness . Once you ' ve fallen_out , it ' s hard to get_back into the swing of things. &quot; Recent lifestyle surveys suggest that Americans have been slowly backsliding on their health regimens -- eating more junk food , smoking more , exercising less -- despite an almost daily assault of information about the benefits of good nutrition and moderate exercise . A poll of 1 # 250 adults for Prevention magazine found a 5 % rise in the number of smokers from 1991 to 1992 . And in an American Dietetic Assn . survey of 1 # 000 adults last year , 39 % of respondents said they were &quot; doing everything they could &quot; to eat a healthy diet . The year before , 44 % said they were . Even in body-fat-obsessed Los Angeles , where most gyms are packed during the 6 p.m. crunch , we ' ve been slipping . Rich mashed potatoes and artery-clogging goose_liver pate are what diners hunger for , says chef Joachim Splichal of Patina and Pinot Bistro restaurants . Although his lower-fat spa dishes satisfy the lunch crowd , dinner is another story . &quot; People are ordering more mashed potatoes , double orders of mashed potatoes , and it seems as if we ' re selling a little more foie_gras than the year before , &quot; he says . &quot; A few years ago , a five-course menu was impossible to sell . Now , people are really indulging themselves in that. &quot; Splichal hesitates to suggest that this binge has reached trend status : &quot; It ' s too early for me to say that -- we ' ve just started the new year. &quot; Ah yes , the New Year , when resolutions are made and broken . But resolutions are remade all year long and re-broken in a predictable pattern of being good / being bad . We wake_up at 5 a.m. to exercise and eat steamed vegetables until we ' ve had enough personal sacrifice , thank_you , and then it ' s back to sleeping_in and inhaling chocolate chunk cookies . Personal trainer Adrienne Williams knows the mind set behind the healthy-unhealthy roller_coaster . First come the excuses , then the missed appointments . &quot; I sense it when their enthusiasm starts waning and work starts to take precedence , &quot; she says . &quot; Or they ' ll say they ' re not feeling too well , and before they ' d go even if they weren ' t feeling well . They don ' t pull_out for good reasons -- it ' s never because great things are happening , but because money ' s too tight or something bad ' s happened . One client said she ' d been eating and drinking so_much that she wasn ' t fit enough to get_back into the gym , which is kind of ironic. &quot; But Williams won ' t shake a finger at anyone , because she ' s been through slack-off stages , too . &quot; I think it ' s all interconnected with the ebbs and flows of energy , and mental_strain that produces these types of effects , &quot; she says . &quot; At different times in our lives we need more or less exercise. &quot; She also believes that society endorses inactivity via media messages : &quot; Read this , watch this , come_to the movies -- it ' s easy to let yourself slip into that. &quot; * When burnout -- or just plain inertia -- hits , it can produce intense guilt feelings , coupled with rationalizations : My job is so tough I ' m too exhausted to go_to the gym ; I ' ve been working_out a lot lately , I deserve a break . And so on . The mental gymnastics can be as exhausting as an hour of aerobics . &quot; It ' s hard to say exactly what made me stop going , &quot; says Aranbasich , the dentist . &quot; Burnout . . . there were some things going_on in my personal life that were taking my up attention . Between those two , that was enough to do it. &quot; He was an exercise die-hard for six years before getting_off the treadmill two years ago , easing_up on a fairly strict low-fat_diet and gaining 15 pounds . ( &quot; But I haven ' t ballooned out or anything , &quot; Aranbasich says. ) Forays to the gym have been sporadic . &quot; I think having that routine made_it easier to follow_through on other routines , &quot; he says . &quot; My life used to be more regimented -- every Friday I ' d bring my clothes into the cleaners . I still get things done , but thinking_back on it , my life was really together. &quot; But on the flip side , too_much structure began to wear him out . &quot; I ' d go_to the gym , be there for two hours , get home at 8:30 , eat dinner and go_to_bed . I thought , ' I ' m spending so_much time doing this , what other things could I be doing rather than devoting so_much time to this ? ' &quot; * Job pressures , money worries and relationship problems cause enormous stress , which can trigger episodes of self-indulgence . &quot; A lot of people have to fight traffic for two hours a day , ( and ) they may have pressures at_work , people telling them what to do , &quot; says Dr. Gail Frank , spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Assn. , epidemiologist and professor of nutrition at California State University , Long_Beach . &quot; And when it comes_to food , they say , ' Listen , I ' m going_to do what I want to do . I ' m at lunch , this is my break time , and I ' m going_to do what makes me feel good. ' I believe it ' s sort of a sign of the times . This is one way of having control when so many things are under the control of someone else. &quot; It was just plain burnout that finally got_to &quot; Jerry &quot; ( whose name has been changed to protect the guilt-ridden ) when he stopped his intense workouts cold turkey four years ago . But the 39-year-old , who works in TV production , still has to deal with his friends ' shock . &quot; I still run_into people who say , ' I can ' t believe you ' re not going_to the gym ! ' And this was a good one : ' You were our inspiration ! ' Yeah , thanks . And now I ' m going_to be a slug like the rest of you. &quot; Jerry ' s workouts were strenuous : Three hours a day , six days a week of stomach work , stretching and weightlifting . That routine went_on for seven years . The last year he tacked_on 1 1 / 2-hour ballet classes four times a week . &quot; I don ' t know where that energy came from , &quot; he says . Wherever it came from , one day it just went . &quot; I went_to the gym and I had really just had it , &quot; he recalled of the fateful day . &quot; It had been building_up , but basically everybody was annoying , and it was becoming more and more a chore to go , and it was getting more crowded . And then this steroid freak screamed at me , accusing me of leaving my sweat on the bench , and I thought , ' Do I really need this in my life ? ' &quot; But it didn ' t take long for the dreaded guilt monster to strike -- it still does , Jerry admits . &quot; I ' ve got a little midriff bulge and my butt ' s starting to sag , &quot; he says , betraying a hint of sadness . &quot; It was always an effort to do_it . But now I don ' t have the sense of accomplishment that I had. &quot; Will there come a day when he ventures back among the few , the proud , the buffed ? &quot; I know I won ' t , &quot; he says without hesitation . &quot; I just can ' t see myself doing_it . . . . There would be mornings when I ' d do a_couple_of sit-ups and keep that going_for a week or two , but then I ' d forget about it . I don ' t know , maybe I ' ll get a Nordic Track . I don ' t know. &quot; * Trainer Williams has seen gung-ho clients metamorphose into sprouting couch potatoes . &quot; They get_into a workout , they see results , and then pressures come_on . But once they stop , they think it ' s really going_to be hard to get_back into it . So they get depressed , they may eat more , take_up smoking , drinking more often , and they get_into a bad cycle. &quot; But others do manage to work their way_out of slothdom . Georgia ( who requested that her last_name not be used ) recently started back on a three-day-a-week program after knocking_off for six months , during which she battled remorse and a 40-pound weight gain . Her downfall started when she opened an advertising company , which propelled her from manageable 11-hour work_days into killer 15- and 16-hour days . Then she began daily psychotherapy sessions , cutting_out her workouts altogether . &quot; I was sort of feeling almost self-destructive , &quot; she admits . &quot; I knew I wasn ' t doing anything for me , and this was the one healthy thing I did . When I was working_out I had dropped 20 pounds , and when I stopped I put_on 40 . I made food my little comfort zone. &quot; But Georgia ' s trainer didn ' t want to forever lose a client to the black_hole of workaholism and Haagen-Dazs Triple Brownie Overload . &quot; She kept calling me . She was cool about it -- we ' re friends , &quot; Georgia , in her early 40s , explains . &quot; She ' d say , ' How ' s it going ? Finally we went_out for breakfast , and I said , ' If you think I ' m going_to be back working_out with you , you ' re wrong . I don ' t see how I ' m going_to be able to do it. ' She didn ' t press it at all . But then I started thinking , ' Well , how can I fit it in ? ' &quot; Georgia finally managed to squeeze in the appointments . &quot; If I can work it into my life , anybody can. &quot;</TEXT>
