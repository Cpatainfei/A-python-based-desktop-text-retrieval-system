   <HEADLINE> THREE CHEERS -- AND A BOO ; WILSON MAKES THE RIGHT CALL ON TRIO OF BILLS BUT WRONGLY VETOES DOMESTIC-PARTNER LEGISLATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If April , as T . S . Eliot wrote , is the cruelest month , then for the governor of California September is surely the busiest . If you ' re keeping score , more_than 1 # 000 bills remain on Gov . Pete Wilson ' s desk -- and he ' s signing or vetoing as fast as he can . Four measures that Wilson has acted_on are of special note . He was right on three of these . AB 2802 : Obviously recalling last year ' s devastating wildfires , Wilson prudently signed legislation authorizing a test program for the firefighting plane known as the CL-415 , the &quot; Super Scooper. &quot; The Canadian-built aircraft , able to scoop_up 1 # 600 gallons of water at a time to dump on fast-moving fires , could prove to be a key weapon in the state ' s firefighting arsenal , one it should have had long ago . But there still remains the very large matter of funding for the test program . The governor and the Legislature must write that check . AB 3432 : A bill authorizing localities to require attorney / lobbyists to register and disclose lobbying activities is short and to_the_point and will cost little . Earlier this year the Los Angeles City_Council passed a similar disclosure ordinance , backed by the city Ethics Commission . The new law drew jeers from some lawyers who had tried to hide behind the attorney-client_privilege to protect themselves from lobbying disclosure requirements . AB 3432 reinforces the notion that a more open government is a cleaner government . Wilson deserves credit for signing it . SB 1427 : In the face of a high-priced public-relations_campaign by pharmaceutical companies , Wilson did the right thing by vetoing a measure that would have limited a pharmacist ' s ability to substitute lower-cost generic drugs for brand-name pharmaceuticals . Proponents insisted the legislation would have protected patients and consumers . But the real protection would have been extended_to the market for more expensive brand-name drugs . AB 2810 : Last week Wilson vetoed a measure to allow those in long-term relationships ( mainly senior-citizen couples who fear losing Social_Security benefits if they marry , and gay couples ) to visit one another in the hospital and assume conservatorship if one partner is incapacitated . The bill would have also made_it easier for a surviving partner to inherit joint property . In his misconceived veto message , Wilson said the state should not encourage &quot; some substitute &quot; for marriage . However he then ordered the state Health Services_Department to develop regulations allowing adults to designate whomever they choose as hospital visitors . Such rules won ' t have the same teeth as law , nor will they affect those hospitalized after being incapacitated without warning . A bad call .</TEXT>
