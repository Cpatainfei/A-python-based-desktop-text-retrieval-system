   <HEADLINE> TWO ARTISTS BRING U.S. TO 22ND BIENAL IN BRAZIL ; EXHIBITIONS : THE SELECTION OF BETTYE SAAR AND JOHN OUTTERBRIDGE IS UNUSUAL IN TWO RESPECTS -- THEY ARE FROM THE WEST COAST AND THEY ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Exhibitions of two Los Angeles artists -- Bettye Saar of Pasadena and John Outterbridge , former director of the Watts Tower Art Center -- are representing the United States this year in the 22nd Bienal , a biannual exhibition that this year features work by 206 artists from a record 71 countries . Stretched across 275 # 000 square_feet and including 1 # 000 works , the Bienal is expected to draw more_than 2 million artists , curators , collectors and other visitors from throughout the world . Saar , 67 , and Outterbridge , 61 , are recognized for their assemblage work , created mainly of found or discarded material woven into poignant , evocative sculpture . Though both artists are well-known in the United States , their presence here , supported by the U.S. Information Agency and Arts America , the National Endowment for the Arts and private_foundations , represents something of a departure for the U.S. , whose international appearances often are dominated by East Coast artists . Saar and Outterbridge are not the first African American artists to represent America at the Bienal ; Chicago sculptor Martin Puryear exhibited here in 1989 . Still , Lizzetta LeFalle-Collins -- an independent curator who proposed the two artists -- said the selection of Outterbridge and Saar is significant for its recognition of African American work . &quot; There ' s a way that ' internationalism ' has been defined that doesn ' t include the aesthetic judgments of people_of_color , &quot; said LeFalle-Collins , who moved to Oakland two years ago from Los Angeles , where she served for six years as a curator at the California Afro-American Museum , the site of a major solo of Outterbridge ' s work last year . &quot; People follow things that were originated_in Europe and by European Americans , and much of it becomes copy work . They become the ' aesthetic markers. ' What makes Bettye and John different is that they derive their art from these other sources that , over the years , have been deemed not to be that important. &quot; Works by other American artists , notably Robert Rauschenberg , are also on display here under a separate invitation of the Bienal . The two-month Bienal also features artists from throughout Europe , Asia and Latin_America . Saar ' s work incorporates her interest in mysticism and the occult , deepened with studies in phrenology , palmistry , voodoo and shamanism . &quot; Mojotech , &quot; for instance , combines computer chips and wires with candles and hearts , suggestive_of the connection between science and indigenous belief systems . &quot; Sanctuary , &quot; created for the Bienal , includes a life-sized canoe , doll-size chairs , lights , figurines and wax moldings of human_body parts to &quot; talk_about the boat people , the Haitians , the Chinese , the Vietnamese , all_of them. &quot; Outterbridge uses containers , cloth , rags and discarded metal in his works . His room-sized &quot; Lie Lye Soap Conference With Seven Scarecrows &quot; includes rags , sticks , gourds , washtubs and bricks to create scarecrow figures , clotheslines and a laundry setting that recalls the folk heritage of his youth . Both artists ' works will remain on view here until mid-December ; in February , they move to a biannual exhibition in Johannesburg , South_Africa .</TEXT>
