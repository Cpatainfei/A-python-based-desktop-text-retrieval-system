   <HEADLINE> QUOTE ME : OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS &amp; VIEWS ; OC HIGH ASKS : ARE ATTITUDES ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT CHANGING ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; I believe the situation is starting to change for the better . In my opinion , men are starting to take women more seriously in everyday situations such_as school or work . People are starting to get the message that we are all equal in every way , except in anatomy . I also feel that women are starting to become more forward or aggressive when it comes_to asking guys out , and this is definitely a good thing. &quot; Rich Hackett , 17 , senior , Loara &quot; It depends_on your gender . Women still generally think sexual_harassment is a major insult and offense , while men think it ' s nothing. &quot; Norm Mowrer , 14 , freshman , Sonora &quot; People are getting much better about not sexually harassing women , but people need to know that men can be sexually harassed also. &quot; Anne Chadburn , 15 , sophomore , Capistrano Valley &quot; People are becoming more afraid of having a lawsuit brought against them now. &quot; Jennifer Klein , 17 , senior , Huntington Beach &quot; Society in_general is becoming more aware of sexual_harassment , and people -- especially women -- are not being afraid to press charges . The Clarence Thomas / Anita Hill incident has opened the eyes of Americans to the fact that sexual_harassment exists , and there are people who won ' t put_up with it. &quot; Tasnim Gosla , 17 , senior , Rosary &quot; With increased awareness and prosecution of sex offenders , potential violators are slowly beginning to clean_up their act . But , like anything else , sex-related accusations can and have been abused. &quot; Chris Birkheimer , 17 , junior , Sunny Hills &quot; No , it ' s just as bad. &quot; Denise Leuis , 17 , junior , Bolsa Grande &quot; I think the entire situation about sexual_harassment has been completely overemphasized . Sometimes there are serious incidents that deserve our attention , but usually I just read the paper and laugh. &quot; Jay Joyer , 17 , senior , Corona del Mar &quot; I think it ' s still a problem , even though it ' s out_in the open more and people are more aware of it. &quot; Shawnee Stevens , 16 , junior , Irvine &quot; Yes . Women are believed more in sexual_harassment and rape cases , and more cases are now appearing of women harassing men. &quot; Stacey Brownlee , 16 , junior , University &quot; It seems to me that it would be great if harassment of any kind didn ' t exist , but it is often blown_out of proportion . Why must we either make legislation too conservative or too liberal ? We have to compromise so that along with personal freedom we can continue to live_in a prosperous nation. &quot; Nick Dinger , 15 , sophomore , Fountain Valley &quot; There are laws about sexual_harassment , but they give women a lot of power . As long as the law is not abused , it ' s good , but a girl can really slander a guy by making things up . Girls are almost always believed. &quot; Nathan Dunn , 18 , senior , Villa Park &quot; Guys are more afraid to do_it now . It hasn ' t changed for women , though ; they still don ' t like it. &quot; Carol Lee , 16 , junior , Trabuco Hills &quot; Adults these days seem to abuse it , and teen-agers take it as a joke . But overall , we ' re aware of it. &quot; Nancy Bui , 16 , sophomore , Los Amigos &quot; I feel there is less now . . . . People are more realistic and less paranoid about the whole concept. &quot; Damon Mircheff , 18 , senior , Marina &quot; Boys just don ' t know the boundaries anymore , and some girls don ' t even know when they are being harassed . Maybe if people would just open their eyes , they would see what ' s going on. &quot; Kathleen Wood , 16 , sophomore , Corona del Mar &quot; I think attitudes are changing because people are more aware of them and there ' s more of a tolerance. &quot; Anne Catto , 17 , junior , Irvine &quot; It still exists everywhere and always will , but people have become more willing to help those who are harassed. &quot; Alex Huong , 17 , senior , Fountain Valley &quot; People are taking it more seriously now that the consequences are harder. &quot; Erik Castro , 14 , freshman , Sonora &quot; I think people are more aware of the problem ; however , people need to stop the situation before it becomes a problem. &quot; Alicia Ritter , 16 , sophomore , Rosary &quot; I think that this whole sexual_harassment thing is so blown out of proportion . People , guys especially , can ' t make any jokes anymore or say anything because anyone could say it ' s sexual_harassment and sue them . I ' m not saying that there is no sexual_harassment , because there is . When a boy grabs a girl or consistently makes rude comments , that is sexual_harassment . I just think that people need to be themselves . Don ' t be rude and watch what you ' re saying . And girls , guys will be guys , especially in high_school . Just remember that. &quot; Jennifer Flicker , 16 , junior , Loara &quot; People are more aware of the issue , so they think before they act. &quot; Tiffany Blindt , 18 , senior , Marina &quot; No , people are still disgusted by it. &quot; Jackie Jenkins , 14 , freshman , Bolsa Grande &quot; At one time or another , my friends and I have been harassed , but it happens so_much without being noticed you can ' t really count it. &quot; Melissa Moshfegh , 16 , sophomore , Villa Park</TEXT>
