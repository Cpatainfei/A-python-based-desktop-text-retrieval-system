   <HEADLINE> DEATH SENTENCE ORDERED IN ISRAEL SUICIDE BOMBING CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An Israeli military_court Thursday sentenced to death a Palestinian for plotting a suicide bus bombing that killed six people last April . If the sentence is upheld , Said Badarneh , 24 , of the militant Muslim Hamas movement , would become the second_person to be executed in Israel.Nazi mastermind Adolf Eichmann was hanged_in 1962 . Prosecutors had asked_for a life sentence . The court deliberated for five hours before announcing its decision . Hamas warned that if Israel carried_out the sentence , it would be costly . &quot; Israel will pay a high price for that , &quot; Imad Falouji , one of the top Hamas leaders in the Gaza Strip , said when asked about the ruling . &quot; They are committing a big mistake . &quot; They ( Israel ) will encourage our Islamic fighters to make more suicide attacks , &quot; he said . The three-judge court sitting in Janin in the West_Bank said Badarneh , of the West_Bank village of Yabad , sent the suicide bomber to blow_up a bus in the central station of Hadera in northern Israel on April 13 . Thirty people were wounded in the attack . Hamas , which rejects Israel ' s right to exist , said at the time that the attack was to avenge the February massacre of Arab worshipers by a Jewish settler in the West_Bank town of Hebron . The sentence can still be overturned by a military_court of appeals or by the Israeli army commander responsible_for the occupied West_Bank . There have been several cases of death sentences imposed by Israeli military_courts being reversed on appeal . Israel Radio quoted the judges as saying they were aware the world community opposed capital_punishment . But it said the court made_a_point of saying long jail terms had so far failed to deter a wave of suicide attacks by Islamic militants .</TEXT>
