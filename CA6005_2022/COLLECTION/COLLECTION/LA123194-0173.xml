   <HEADLINE> IS IT OVER YET ? ; 1994 BROUGHT PAIN ; INVESTORS ASK IF ' 95 WILL BE BETTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Financial markets ' Year of Misery ended mercifully on Friday , leaving investors worldwide to lick their wounds -- and to hope they can avoid a repeat in 1995 . In the U.S. stock_market , the Dow Jones industrial average inched up 1.01 points Friday to 3 # 834.44 , or 80.35 points above 1993 ' s close , for a 2.1 % gain . But that was where the good news ended on Wall_Street . Every other major U.S. stock index declined in price for the year , with most losing between 1.5 % and 6 % . Most foreign markets performed even worse in local currencies . All in all , stocks posted their worst year -- and first losses -- since 1990 . The nominal culprit , of course , was the surge in interest_rates worldwide : The Federal_Reserve_Board boosted short-term rates by a dramatic 2.5 percentage_points in 1994 , ostensibly to keep the robust U.S. economy from overheating . In the process interest_rates jumped across the board here and abroad , producing some of the worst 12-month paper losses for global bond investors in this century . As the market yield on 30-year U.S. Treasury_bonds soared from 6.35 % at the start of the year to 7.88 % as of Friday , the value of that bond ( if purchased a year ago ) slumped 17 % . But given the magnitude of the rise in interest_rates , some Wall Streeters say the real surprise is that the U.S. stock_market didn ' t collapse outright after hitting record highs early in the year . Indeed , with the blue_chip Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500-stock index off a mere 1.5 % in price for the year , &quot; the damage has been so minor that it doesn ' t really qualify as a bear_market at this point , &quot; admits an otherwise bearish James Stack , publisher of the InvesTech market newsletter in Whitefish , Mont . Even during the depths of the market ' s selloff last spring , major U.S. stock indexes dropped only about 10 % from their all-time highs . That is typical of a market &quot; correction &quot; -- a short-term pause in a bull_market -- as opposed to a bear_market , in which broad indexes usually decline 20 % or more . And in recent weeks , U.S. stocks have rallied sharply as long-term bond yields have begun to show signs of topping out . The Dow industrial index has jumped 4 % since Dec . 8 , and now is just 3.6 % below its record high of 3 # 978.36 set_on Jan . 31 . What ' s more , bullish analysts point_out that it was possible to make money in_stocks in 1994 : Many issues responded well to their companies ' strong underlying earnings growth , despite higher interest_rates . Hot industries included shoe making , technology , aluminum and medical supplies . Still , world stock_markets were buffeted by so many cross currents and contradictions in 1994 that it ' s hardly surprising if the average investor feels worse than the broad market indexes would imply : * Market volatility , as measured by the percentage difference between the S &amp; P 500 index ' s high and low values for the entire year , was just under 10 % -- the second lowest on record , after 1993 . Yet Abby Cohen , investment strategist at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. , calculates that nearly 40 % of all actively traded stocks had declined more_than 30 % from their 1994 highs by Nov . 30 . For those issues , the bear_market was real . * Investors who diversified internationally , believing that stock_market returns worldwide generally didn ' t correlate -- i.e. , that other markets would zig if the U.S. zagged -- found that premise to be mostly false in 1994 . Japanese stocks were the only winners among major markets , as they rallied out of their four-year bear_market . In Europe and most Third_World markets , stocks declined sharply as interest_rates rose , though a weak dollar for much of the year made some foreign markets ' performance appear better to U.S. investors . * Classic &quot; defensive &quot; issues -- stocks that investors normally turn_to for protection in times of turmoil -- were among the year ' s biggest losers . The Dow utility-stock index , for example , plummeted 20.8 % for the year , victim of rising interest_rates and industry-specific problems . And gold mining stocks dove 18.9 % on average , as the price of bullion fell from $ 390.80 an ounce a year ago to $ 383.10 as of Friday , reaping no benefit from worries about higher inflation in the strong economy . With so_much anguish in markets -- and with no end in_sight to high short-term interest_rates that are drawing a tidal_wave of cash away from stocks -- it ' s little wonder that so many Wall_Street pros are bearish , analysts say . Fully 50 % of the market newsletter writers polled regularly by Investors Intelligence of New Rochelle , N.Y. now say they ' re bearish . Only 35 % are bullish . The rest see this market in a short-term correction . The most prevalent forecast is for another slump in_stock prices early in 1995 , as the Fed tightens credit further to restrain the economy . But Arnold Kaufman , investment strategist at Standard &amp; Poor ' s Corp . in New York , argues that the worst has passed for stocks . He believes the Fed will succeed in slowing -- not stopping -- the economy in 1995 , and that continuing growth in corporate earnings will bolster the market as interest_rates begin to stabilize . &quot; We don ' t see this as a bear_market . The difference is that we ' re buying the ' soft landing ' concept ( for the economy ) , while others are not , &quot; Kaufman says . He expects the S &amp; P 500 index to gain 10 % in 1995 , including dividends . Corporate earnings are the key , Kaufman says : They advanced so strongly in 1994 that the S &amp; P 500 index ' s price-to-earnings ratio , based on estimated 1994 operating earnings , is just under 15 now . If earnings advance as expected next year , the S &amp; P ' s price-to-earnings ratio is 13.5 based on estimated 1995 results . Those are not absurdly high &quot; P-E &quot; multiples , Kaufman says . So there ' s no overwhelming reason for stocks to plunge from here , he says . But bears like InvesTech ' s Stack say lower P-E ratios can ' t help a stock_market that ' s being assaulted by short-term interest_rates above 6 % and long-term yields near 8 % . To Stack , U.S. stocks ' relative resilience in 1994 is a bad sign rather than a good one : He thinks the market has just delayed the inevitable -- a much deeper decline that finally shakes out many of the investors who ' ve entered in the record wave of new stock buyers since 1990 . Market Roundup , D3 ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) The Markets ' Year That Was Surging interest_rates , as the Federal_Reserve tightened credit for the first time since 1989 , set a mosotly negative tone fr stocks and bonds virtually worldwide in 1994 . Yet the Dow industrials eked out a gain for the year -- and some stock groups zoomed . ...And Most Stock Indexes Fall...
