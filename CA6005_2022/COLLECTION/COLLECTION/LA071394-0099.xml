   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : SEMIFINALS ; SWEDEN , BULGARIA WILL TACKLE THE PAST ; ROSE BOWL : IN SIX WORLD CUP MEETINGS , INCLUDING A FIRST-ROUND GAME , BRAZIL HAS NEVER LOST TO SWEDES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If it were possible to shove aside history , or to ignore its lurking existence , Sweden ' s World Cup team would do so . But it is all there , always : Brazil and its beautiful game ; Brazil , with Pele , the greatest player ever ; Brazil , three-time winner of the World Cup ; Brazil , whose style is often mimicked but never copied ; Brazil , the permanent holder of the first World Cup trophy , the Jules Rimet Cup . If Brazil ' s international dominance of the sport were something to be viewed from afar , it might not be so threatening . But tiny Sweden already knows much about the soccer colossus , both historically and firsthand . Today ' s World Cup semifinal game at the Rose Bowl is not an introduction , but a continuation of their World Cup relationship . The inevitability of playing Brazil in the World Cup grows as the tournament wears_on -- Brazil is a team that sticks_around . But for Sweden , today ' s game amounts to double_jeopardy , the teams having played to a meaningless 1-1 tie at the end of the first round . So for Sweden , Brazil looms . But then , Brazil always looms . Even as his team was preparing to play Romania last Sunday in what would be one of the closest games yet in the World Cup , Swedish Coach Tommy Svensson used the chance to play Brazil in the next round as motivation in his pregame speech . &quot; I said before the game , ' What we are playing about today is to play Brazil on Wednesday , semifinal in the World Cup , Rose Bowl , Pasadena , Los Angeles , ' &quot; Svensson said . &quot; And that is a great thing for Sweden. &quot; The chance to play soccer ' s icon might be viewed_as a moment to be seized . How better for athletes to measure themselves than against their betters ? Yet , some teams shrink_from the task , fearing unfavorable comparisons . Sweden has taken the former stance . The team relishes the chance to play Brazil again . Their first meeting , two weeks ago , carried no psychic weight . It merely ushered the teams forward to the second round without changing anything . &quot; It was just a friendly , &quot; said Brazilian Coach Carlos Albert Parreira . &quot; This is going_to be a totally different game , because nothing less than the World Cup_final is at stake . There is an advantage -- we know this team . It ' s better to play a team that you know than a team you have never played in competition. &quot; Thoughts fly back to the World Cup championship game of 1958 , in Stockholm . Brazil vs . Sweden . For the first time , Sweden was fielding a team of professional soccer players , and the nation shucked its usual benign indifference to things emotional and fell_in , wildly , behind the home team . Decades of restraint might have caused the Swedes to go overboard . They allowed cheerleaders to take_the_field before the semifinal against Germany . In the final against Brazil , Sweden scored in the first four minutes and the world expected the South_Americans to collapse in despair . Sweden even scored another goal , but Brazil scored five and &quot; the world &quot; got another lesson in judging soccer games by geographic stereotype . In the 1938 World Cup in France , Sweden was dubbed &quot; the team of steel &quot; and Brazil was , as usual , considered a team capable of winning the whole_thing , if it felt_like it . Sweden roared through the second round . During an 8-0 rout of Cuba , French journalist Emmanuel Gambardella stopped writing at 5-0 . &quot; Up to five goals is journalism , &quot; he said . &quot; After that , it becomes statistics. &quot; Brazil advanced with unusual efficiency , too , but then both teams lost in the semifinals . In the third-place game , Brazil won , 4-2 . Today , Sweden is aware of the statistics . No one needs reminding that in the six times the teams have met in the World Cup , Brazil has never lost . Brazil knows , too . It is familiar_with the situation , familiar_with the pressure and the almost surreal expectations of its fans . It knows not to take any opponent lightly , because each opponent would like nothing more_than to beat mighty Brazil . &quot; The Swedish team is the best possible , &quot; Parreira said . &quot; I followed them since the European ( Championships ) competition , two years back . I think they are very consistent , very competitive technically . Good players . And they never give_up , always try to come from behind . It is not by chance they are in the semifinal against Brazil. &quot;</TEXT>
