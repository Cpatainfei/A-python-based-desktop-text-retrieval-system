   <HEADLINE> FAMILY ; SERIOUS THEMES BY ' YOUNG PLAYWRIGHTS '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Child ' s play ? No way . A psychologist mourning the loss of a patient , a teen-ager struggling with his emerging homosexuality , sexually abused sisters : These serious themes can be found in &quot; Young Playwrights L.A. , &quot; theatrical works by playwrights ages 14 to 18 , which opened Wednesday at the Odyssey Theatre Ensemble in West Los Angeles . Presented by theater professionals , the event features &quot; December Pairs , &quot; a fully staged play by 17-year-old Jim Knable of Sacramento about an introverted young_man who practices for marriage with an imaginary wife . Knable ' s play , previously produced at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego , was a winner of this year ' s California Young Playwrights Contest , part of the national , nonprofit Playwrights Project . Also on the bill are rehearsed readings of nine plays , including &quot; The First Note , &quot; a drama by 14-year-old Sepulveda Junior_High student Lissa Levy , exploring a confused teen-ager ' s efforts to suppress his homosexuality after an encounter with an older gay_man . &quot; I don ' t really know how it all got started in my head , &quot; Levy said . &quot; It just seemed like a logical progression for a teen-age boy to go_through this type of confusion because he ' s worried about being normal sexually . The outside pressures , his own fears , his own envisionment of the world in a way , cripple him. &quot; Writing the play has &quot; opened my eyes to a whole new_world , &quot; she said . &quot; I watch people much more carefully now -- their body_language , what they say , their choice in words . . . . I was a people-watcher before this , now I feel I ' m a_people analyzer. &quot; Levy is currently at_work on a play she might enter in the Project ' s statewide contest next year . Levy ' s work and the other readings on the program came_out of the Project ' s Dream Lab , headed by writer-director-actor Doug Kaback , the Music Center Education Division artist-in-residence who coordinates the Project ' s Los Angeles events . Dream Lab participants were chosen from area public_schools and developed their plays during Saturday sessions at the Music Center . &quot; The idea was first to create a safe place , a laboratory feeling where we could experiment and fail , &quot; Kaback said . &quot; A place where we could take writing , just a piece , a scene or a monologue and put it on its feet . . . . &quot; It didn ' t surprise him that the budding playwrights chose to explore some pretty serious issues . &quot; Some plays we ' re producing are very lighthearted and fantastical , but the majority were based on serious issues. &quot; Working with young people is &quot; enormously affirming , &quot; he added . &quot; A good_part of what I do as an artist is to . . . let them find their voice and express the hilarity and the difficulty of their existence. &quot; Past participants in the Young Playwrights Project include Fulbright winner Karen Hartman and stage , TV and film_writer Josefina Lopez , whose comedy &quot; Real Women Have Curves &quot; just finished a run at the San Diego Repertory Theatre . * &quot; Young Playwrights L.A. , &quot; Odyssey Theatre Ensemble , 2055 S .
