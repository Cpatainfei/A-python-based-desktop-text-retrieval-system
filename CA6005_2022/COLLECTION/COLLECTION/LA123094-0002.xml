   <HEADLINE> HITTING A FESTIVE NOTE ; JAZZ_MUSICIANS WILL PLAY OLD HITS AND CONTEMPORARY FAVORITES IN NEW YEAR ' S EVE SHOWS AT SEVERAL VALLEY LOCATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> New Year ' s Eve and music -- they go hand in_hand . For jazz fans , there ' s a variety of entertainment on_tap at San Fernando Valley establishments for this year-end celebration . Drummer Frank Capp is one of these artists . Long known for his playing with his Juggernaut big_band , Capp has been an esteemed small group player since the 1950s and enjoys fronting a quartet . &quot; In a small band , there ' s more freedom than in a big_band , where your playing is dictated by the arrangements , &quot; he says . This New Year ' s Eve , Capp will lead a foursome at Legends of Hollywood in Studio City that features renowned tenor saxophonist Pete Christlieb , pianist Jon Mayer and bassist Richard Reid . The tenor man , who also plays in the Juggernaut , is a personal favorite of the drummer . &quot; He plays with a lot of fire and excitement . He has a lot of technique on the instrument , he has a real solid sound and a great concept for jazz . He has his own identity . You can pick him out of a crowd of tenor players , &quot; Capp says . &quot; What I intend to do Saturday is entertain the people with what they came expecting to hear , which is straight-ahead jazz . Otherwise , they would n ' t be coming there . We ' re not playing for dancing , since it ' s a not a dance gig , &quot; he says . The drummer will offer a variety of material , from such staples as the blues and variations on &quot; I Got Rhythm &quot; to songs &quot; that are out of my era , the ' 50s , like ' Stablemates , ' ' Nica ' s Dream ' and ' Parisian Thoroughfare. ' &quot; At Chadney ' s on New Year ' s Eve , saxophonist-singer Jimmy Maddin also will investigate the ' 50s , but in a more Vegas mode . Leading his Happy Blues Jazz Train , Maddin will do such numbers as &quot; I ' m Confessin , ' &quot; &quot; Old Black_Magic &quot; and &quot; Just a Gigolo , &quot; which were made hits by singer-trumpeter Louis Prima and his wife , singer Keely Smith . &quot; Louis was a good friend of mine , and so was his saxophonist , Sam Butera , so I ' m kind of bringing his songs back , &quot; says Maddin . &quot; They appeal_to young people. &quot; * These days , Maddin does the Prima-Smith numbers with singer Terry Hunter . He originally did the act in the ' 50s with singer Beverly Adlin , who &quot; was Errol Flynn ' s girlfriend then &quot; at the Sundown , a club Maddin owned in Hollywood . ( He also owned The Summit , another Hollywood nightspot that is now the popular rock venue , Club Lingerie. ) Jazz is definitely part of a Maddin performance , which includes songs from the ' 40s associated with Louis Jordan -- &quot; I like him . He did a ' happy-type ' blues &quot; -- and such classics from the ' 50s as &quot; Four , &quot; by Miles Davis . &quot; Mainstream jazz -- that ' s my bag , &quot; Maddin says . But New Year ' s Eve calls_for a more eclectic mix , says Maddin , who at previous year-end event has performed on bills with rock_stars Jerry Lee Lewis and the Beach Boys . &quot; we ' ll play jazz and blues , &quot; says Maddin , whose band at Chadney ' s includes guitarist Bruce Lofgren . &quot; People will be in a festive mood , and I like to work hard to entertain them and put_on a show. &quot; At the Baked Potato in North Hollywood , club owner / pianist Don Randi ' s New Year ' s Eve show will be more contemporary , with many tunes outfitted with a rock-based beat . &quot; And , these days , people seem to be liking Latin music a lot more , so we ' ll play a lot of that , &quot; says the man who opened the Baked Potato in 1969 . ( The room of the same name in Pasadena is a franchise. ) On tap will be Randi ' s band Quest , with Chuck Camper featured on saxophone , and he ' ll have a guest singer . New Year ' s Eve is either &quot; fantastic , or it stinks . There ' s no in-between , &quot; Randi says . But in recent years , he ' s had wonderful New Year ' s Eves , &quot; with great audiences in a great mood , wanting to be entertained , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s been fun. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Where and When What : Frank Capp ' s quartet at Legends of Hollywood , 11720 Ventura Blvd. , Studio City .
