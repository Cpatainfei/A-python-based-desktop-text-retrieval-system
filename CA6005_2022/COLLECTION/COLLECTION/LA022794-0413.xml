   <HEADLINE> THE HEALTHY TRAVELER : BEING A ROAD WORRIER CAN HELP TRIP PLANNING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The number of auto accident fatalities has been declining in recent years , yet statistics are still sobering for travelers making vacation plans . More_than 22 # 000 people died in car and taxi accidents in the United States in 1991 ( the most recent year for which statistics are available ) , according to the National Safety Council . In our travel planning , it helps to know which states and countries pose the greatest risks , which are safest , which cars hold_up best in accidents , and under what circumstances it is statistically safer to fly than to drive . In the United States , it is safer to drive on limited-access highways , such_as interstates , than on other roads , according to Michael Sivak , a research scientist at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute . And driving_in certain states and countries is statistically safer than others . Among the safest U.S. states : Massachusetts , Connecticut , Rhode Island , New Hampshire , New Jersey and Virginia , according to the National Safety Council , which gathers motor_vehicle death statistics from each state and then calculates the rate of fatal_accidents per mile driven for each . California is termed relatively safe , according to NSC statistics , as are Wisconsin , North_Dakota , Minnesota and Washington . Arizona and Nevada are classified as more hazardous for drivers . And deemed least safe by the NSC , because of the higher number of per-capita fatalities , are New Mexico , Arkansas , Alaska and West_Virginia . * In Europe , the United Kingdom and Netherlands are among the countries with the lowest auto fatality rates , according to John M . Allen of the_British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Assn . Allen cited information from the_British Department of Transport ' s International Road Traffic and Accident Database , which tracks road deaths in selected countries , including Europe . Both countries reported 1.9 road deaths per 10 # 000 motor_vehicles in 1991 . In other countries , the deaths per 10 # 000 vehicles were : West Germany , 2.0 ; Italy , 2.2 ; Luxembourg , 3.5 ; France , 3.6 ; Belgium , 3.7 , and the_Irish Republic , 4.0. Less safe are Spain , with 5.0 deaths per 10 # 000 motor_vehicles , and Greece , with 6.8. Whether you are renting or buying , choosing a safe car can also reduce the chance of accident and death . Many organizations test cars for safety , but among the most respected sources are Consumers Union , publishers of Consumer Reports , and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , part of the Department_of_Transportation . Each year , Consumers Union rates cars for safety and publishes those findings in its April car evaluation issue . Cars are rated for both passenger and driver protection , as well as on how well the passenger compartment holds_up in an accident . Among 1993 vehicles , for example , 14 cars and trucks received better than average ratings ( the highest possible ) in all three categories , while only two vehicles ( Chevrolet Astro and GMC Safari minivans ) got the worst possible ratings for driver and passenger protection . The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration also tests domestic and foreign passenger_cars and light trucks . For detailed information on a specific crash test , by model , consumers can call the agency ' s toll-free Auto Safety Hotline , ( 800 ) 424-9393 , and ask that findings be mailed to them . If traveling with_children in a rental car , make_sure the car will contain a child safety seat . If the rental car_company cannot provide one , take one along . Child safety seats reduce minor injury by half , Hoskin said , and trim the death risk by 70 % . * Ask rental personnel for specific directions to your next destination and , when traveling overseas , ask about signs and roadways peculiar to the country you are visiting , suggested Ardis Berghoff , a spokeswoman for Budget Rent a Car . Many accidents that occur to U.S. travelers driving overseas occur because of lack of familiarity with local driving habits and road systems , she said . Sometimes , the safest way to travel isn ' t by car . &quot; You are 32 times more likely to die in a car crash than in a plane crash , given the same amount of miles , &quot; Hoskin said . Add that some of us are less than perfect drivers and that some drivers take the wheel while under the influence of alcohol and drugs , and the open road becomes a little less inviting . If you haven ' t yet decided to fly or drive , calculate your risk , Sivak said . According to his research , risk is affected by the number of airplane stopovers and total trip length . For example : the average driver traveling more_than 37 miles is safer on a non-stop flight than driving . If the flight has two legs , the average driver is safer flying than driving if the trip is more_than 74 miles . If the flight has three legs , we are safer flying if the trip is more_than 111 miles . Yet risk also depends , Sivak said , on the traveler ' s driving habits . The worse the driver , the safer it can be to fly . The Healthy Traveler appears the second and fourth week of every month .</TEXT>
