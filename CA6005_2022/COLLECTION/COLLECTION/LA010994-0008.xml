   <HEADLINE> THEATER ; HOMETOWN BOY MAKES WAVES ; AFTER A THREE-YEAR ABSENCE IN NEW YORK TO HELM TV ' S ' LAW &amp; ORDER , ' PRODUCER JOE STERN HAS RETURNED TO HIS ROOTS AND HIS FIRST LOVE , THE L.A. THEATER SCENE , TO WORK WITH ' THE GREATEST TALENT POOL OF ACTORS IN THE WORLD '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Joseph Stern is back and he ' s mad as hell and not going_to let us take it anymore . &quot; The actor is an endangered species , &quot; producer Stern is saying , standing on the deck of his Pacific Palisades home . &quot; Between the economy , the lack of funding , and its effect on our standards , actors are not practicing their art . They ' re not doing something else . They ' re not directing , or writing their memoirs . They ' re just waiting for the next gig. &quot; Stern lists actors who quit the profession . He mentions stars who live_in Los Angeles , yet never work_on local stages . He speaks rapid-fire , sounding more adolescent than middle-aged , despite his 53 years . After a three-year absence while working as co-executive and executive producer of the New York-based NBC-TV series &quot; Law &amp; Order , &quot; Stern has returned to his hometown and his first love , the theater , specifically , his own theater , the Matrix , at 7657 Melrose Ave. , where he ' s currently producing a critically acclaimed revival of George M . Cohan ' s 1920 melodrama &quot; The Tavern. &quot; ( The show continues through Feb . 13. ) Despite two Emmy and two Golden Globe nominations for &quot; Law &amp; Order , &quot; Stern left the show feeling he had &quot; done all I could , and I didn ' t feel we had the same goals anymore. &quot; Among the very few theater producers who straddle stage and screen , Stern continues to balance both arenas more effectively than any other theater producer in Los Angeles . Last fall , while preparing to mount &quot; The Tavern &quot; at the Matrix , Stern simultaneously produced the controversial &quot; Other Mothers , &quot; the &quot; CBS Schoolbreak Special &quot; about lesbians parenting a high_school boy . A key mover and shaker during the phenomenal 1980s boom in Southern California theater , Stern was at that time both a leader and a rebel . While mounting stage productions under his Actors for Themselves banner that earned 19 Los Angeles Drama_Critics Circle Awards , including the prestigious Margaret Harford Award for lifetime achievement , Stern accused Actors ' Equity of not supporting Southern California theater producers , publicly dueled with Mark Taper Forum artistic director Gordon Davidson ( claiming that the Taper was not , at the time , using enough local talent ) , and demanded better working conditions for actors . Always , if there was a panel_discussion , Stern was_on it ; call a debate , and he led the argument . Ask_for a provocative statement , and he wrote the newspaper a letter . Stern could always be counted_on to name names . He has been missed here . &quot; I ' ve been told there ' s a tightening of the belt ( in L.A. ) because of the economy , &quot; Stern says . &quot; Colleagues date it back to the riots , for whatever reason , and they feel the audience has seen too_much bad theater . The audience is smaller . It ' s not just the economy . It may be trust in the product . They ' ve been burned too many times . &quot; But the greatest talent pool ( of actors ) in the world is right here in Los Angeles , &quot; Stern declares with rising emphasis . &quot; It certainly isn ' t in New York . While living there for the last three years , I saw some 70 shows , and talked to a number of people , and auditioned some 6 # 000 actors . You can ' t tell me the work is better there than in Los Angeles . This is where the talent pool is . . . . How do we get them back on stage ? &quot; Stern ' s solution was to form the Matrix Theatre Company , a repertory_company of industry actors who , thanks to lucrative television and movie salaries , can afford to work in the theater for free . His model for this is Kenneth Branagh ' s Renaissance Theatre Company in London , a core resident company that enlists movie actors for various projects . But the problem , of course , is that in-demand performers frequently leave shows for paying industry jobs . Stern solved this problem by double-casting &quot; The Tavern. &quot; That meant finding not just 15 actors , but 30 . Each role has a minimum of two actors in alternating performances . When one actor ' s agent calls with a job , another actor steps_in . But if you cast actors the level of Marian Mercer ( &quot; It ' s a Living &quot; ) and David Dukes ( &quot; The Mommies &quot; ) , their alternates must be equal in talent . Such casting would be the envy of any theater in the world , let alone a not-for-profit 99-seat house . &quot; I knew double-casting was the only hope if I was going_to get a great company of actors , &quot; Stern remembers . &quot; That way , they ' re not missing a job . During the rehearsal period , some 15 or 20 jobs came_up . Half of ( the actors ) were out at one point . Jim Haynie , Mitch Ryan -- each had one or two jobs where they left for a_few days . Talia Balsam missed the first week of previews . Charles Hallahan is in ' Grace Under Fire. ' &quot; Surprisingly , this unpredictability made the rehearsal process more cooperative and less competitive . Director Tony Giordano , who initially proposed &quot; The Tavern &quot; to Stern while observing a &quot; Law &amp; Order &quot; location shoot , described the experience by phone from his New York apartment : &quot; I viewed it as a big gamble . Though it was frustrating to lose people for days ( to industry jobs ) while I continued to progress through the rehearsal process , I expected that . But when they were in rehearsals , those actors were there a hundred-thousand percent of the time . Many times they came_on their days_off and observed rehearsals. &quot; Penny Fuller , who plays the madwoman in &quot; The Tavern , &quot; agrees with Giordano ' s assessment . &quot; It ' s a wonderful way to have a sense of community without the financial or creative sacrifice , &quot; says the actress who first worked for Stern in 1982 in an award-winning production of Harold Pinter ' s &quot; Betrayal &quot; at the Matrix . &quot; On my off-days , I would watch Lindsay Crouse ( Fuller ' s double ) , and then we ' d talk_about the part and share ideas. &quot; &quot; And there ' s no billing problem , &quot; Stern says of the traditional backstage vanity battles producers generally must endure . &quot; An environment of such generosity has been created . We ' ve proved that if you can eliminate the ego and the competitiveness -- we ' ve done about 80 % of that -- you can achieve the most amazing things . The biggest problem was finding younger actors . . . . The great majority just didn ' t get_it . If they read the play , they didn ' t get the play . There ' s just a lack of skilled young people . It was eye-opening. &quot; This realization saddened Stern . &quot; When I was a young actor , I worked under major actors . That was another purpose ( of the company ) , to pass_on tradition . Basically , there ' s just more and more actors over 40 quitting the business . The quality of television and movies is so awful because it ' s now come_down to producers saying , ' Get me a ( guild minimum ) scale actor. ' They tell great character_actors , ' If you don ' t work for scale , buddy , we ' ll get the next guy. ' &quot; We ' re talking_about artists here ! We ' re talking_about 30 years of skill , of life ! But the television and film_producers don ' t give a ( expletive ) ! I ' ll go_on record ! They just say , ' If you won ' t do_it , someone else will. ' &quot; What always turned me on in the theater was great actors , &quot; Stern says with a sad sigh . &quot; that ' s what got me . Always . That is what changed my life. &quot; * Stern was born in Los Angeles in 1940 and was raised two blocks from the Matrix Theatre . Throughout his education at Fairfax High , Los Angeles City College and UCLA , Stern repeatedly performed in school plays and emceed public events . After being released from the Army reserves in 1964 , he flew to New York and auditioned at Joseph Papp ' s Public Theatre . His ambition was to become a professional Shakespearean actor . Papp obliged . Three weeks after getting his first paid acting job , Stern married his college girlfriend , Peppy . ( This year the Sterns will celebrate their 30th wedding_anniversary with their two sons. ) At the New York Shakespeare Festival , while carrying spears in crowd scenes , Stern became close friends with another unknown actor , William Devane . Soon Stern and Devane formed a nonprofit production company called Actors for Themselves . In the early 1970s , Stern was cast in a network series starring Karen Valentine and moved_back to Los Angeles . He was subsequently fired from the show , and in the process realized that acting wasn ' t his primary calling . &quot; I was just a working actor , &quot; Stern says . &quot; I never wanted it bad enough . I was always very precocious at school , but in the real_world I knew I could never be great at it . I thought I had an instinct for conducting , for putting everybody together , and had a real instinct for behavior . I always felt I knew who had talent . I was never afraid to make decisions . And I was never afraid of failing . I ' d always been a gambler. &quot; In 1975 , actor-writer Allan Miller asked Stern to help produce a play in Los Angeles , &quot; Are You Now or Have You Ever Been . . . ? &quot; Stern brought his friend Devane west to direct , and their production ran_for a record-breaking 14 months before moving to Washington , D.C. In 1976 , Stern discovered the Matrix , and learned that the ensemble that was playing there was struggling to survive . He and Devane borrowed money from Stern ' s salesman father and bought the theater and allowed the company to continue . Meanwhile , Stern was also head of development and production for Dan Curtis Productions , a television production company , from 1977 to 1982 , participating in the making of the hit miniseries &quot; The Winds of War , &quot; and receiving an Emmy nomination for producing the first season of &quot; Cagney &amp; Lacey &quot; for Orion . * In 1980 , Devane traded his half of the Matrix to a dentist for an Arabian racehorse . Stern soon after bought_out the dentist and became sole owner of the Matrix . The ensemble company left and his professional double-life debuted , with Stern juggling pilots for Curtis Productions with plays such_as David Mamet ' s &quot; A Life in the Theatre &quot; for the Matrix . Throughout the ' 80s , his Actors for Themselves productions at the Matrix -- notably the world_premiere of Lyle Kessler ' s &quot; Orphans &quot; and Simon Gray ' s &quot; The Common Pursuit &quot; -- garnered numerous rewards and international attention . He produced the feature_film &quot; Dad &quot; for Steven Spielberg ' s Amblin Productions , and the television movie &quot; Into Thin Air , &quot; starring Ellen Burstyn . The decade ended with Stern ' s ABC special &quot; The Perfect Date &quot; winning two Emmys . Stern , who throughout this time was living_in L.A. , was careful never to allow the Matrix to become an industry showcase . But feedback and cross-pollination often occurred . For example , Stern hired Lee Shallat to direct the West Coast premiere of Larry Shue ' s &quot; Wenceslas Square &quot; at the Matrix ( 1989 ) as well as last year ' s after-school special , &quot; Other Mothers. &quot; Now a director for &quot; Murphy Brown , &quot; Shallat says of Stern : &quot; Joe is really responsible_for getting me my first break_in television . He ' s amazingly generous and almost vociferous in his desire to get people to work together . Joe makes people better by his passion and by his demand for quality and his unrelenting tenacity. &quot; But Stern ' s tenacity has also made him more_than a_few enemies . Some actors and directors he has worked with have claimed that his obsessive perfectionism is destructive . Others say his &quot; hands on &quot; style is manipulative . &quot; I ' m there to force you to be better , &quot; Stern retorts to such accusations , &quot; not to make you better . I ' ve never given anybody their talent . But I try to make you go_to your capacity . I ' m like a coach that way . I don ' t allow you to quit. &quot; In 1994 , while producing his three-play season ( the two works to follow &quot; The Tavern &quot; are still in the process of being confirmed ) , Stern will also pursue his own television series . &quot; If I want to keep this house , &quot; he says , gesturing at his family ' s recently purchased Pacific Palisades home , &quot; then I ' d better work in television . I have enough money to get me through a_couple_of years . I never owned a house before , purposely , because I didn ' t want to have to take that bad job. &quot; Playwright Mayo Simon recalls a party at Stern ' s rented apartment in the 1980s . Simon marveled that a successful television producer would not own a home . &quot; Joe doesn ' t buy homes , &quot; said his wife , Peppy . &quot; Joe buys theaters. &quot; Now Stern is tenaciously pushing_forward his Matrix Theatre Company . His all-star company is currently involved in meetings to decide how to proceed in a quasi-democratic process that fits Stern ' s style . What next ? &quot; In another six months , I ' ll probably shoulder my satchel and hold_out my hand and figure_out how to get some money to run the Matrix , &quot; says Stern , who this time around has relied only on_his_own savings and ticket sales to operate . &quot; I don ' t know what the answer is , but I feel_for the American actor . I really do . And I do believe they ' re an endangered species. &quot;</TEXT>
