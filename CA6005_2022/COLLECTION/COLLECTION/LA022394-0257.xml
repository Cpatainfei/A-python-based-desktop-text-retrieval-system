   <HEADLINE> MCDONNELL MAY SELL STAKE TO ITALIAN FIRM ; AEROSPACE : IF A DEAL IS MADE , IT COULD GIVE STRUGGLING DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT THE CAPITAL IT NEEDS TO DEVELOP NEW AIRLINERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> McDonnell Douglas Corp. , which failed to sell part of its Douglas Aircraft commercial division to Taiwan Aerospace two years ago , is now in talks to sell a minority stake in the operation to an aerospace company owned by the Italian government . If the deal goes_through , it could provide struggling Douglas Aircraft with several hundred million dollars that it needs to develop a new generation of airliners . Douglas is holding the talks with Finmeccanica , which is 90 % -owned by the Italian state holding company , Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale , or IRI . The holding company confirmed Tuesday that it gave Finmeccanica permission to discuss the possible purchase of the stake in Douglas , which employs 11 # 000 people . Italian news_reports indicated that between 10 % and 20 % of Douglas could be sold , but a Finmeccanica official said the size of the stake and its price were yet to be negotiated . * Spokesmen for McDonnell and Douglas Aircraft declined to comment on the talks . However , Douglas spokesman John Thom noted that a Finmeccanica division , Alenia , has been a Douglas subcontractor for three decades and currently builds fuselage panels for Douglas ' MD-11 wide body and MD-80 narrow-body airliners . Italy ' s national airline , Alitalia , which is controlled by IRI , is also a Douglas customer . McDonnell has been scouring the globe for a financial partner since its attempt to sell 40 % of Douglas to Taiwan Aerospace for $ 2 billion fell_apart in 1992 because the parties couldn ' t come_to terms . Douglas and industry_analysts view such a cash infusion as crucial if Douglas is to reverse its steady loss of customers to industry leader Boeing Co . and Europe ' s Airbus Industrie consortium . Douglas ' struggle to generate new sales , and a worldwide recession in the commercial aircraft industry , have forced the firm to lay off nearly 75 % of its work_force , from a peak of about 42 # 000 people in 1990 . Those factors also forced Douglas to virtually stop development of its next-generation airliner , the MD-12 , a 500-seat jumbo jet that the company had once hoped would be ready for service in 1997 . McDonnell Chairman John F . McDonnell said in a speech a year ago that the company was &quot; pushing ahead with serious discussions with potential partners interested in sharing_in the risks and rewards of the commercial aircraft business. &quot; &quot; Given the escalating costs of developing new generations of aircraft , international partnerships in one form or another have become an industry prerequisite , &quot; McDonnell said at the time . Indeed , analyst Paul Nisbet of the aerospace consulting_firm JSA Research Inc. in Newport , R.I. , said Douglas is looking not only for cash but also for technology that would help limit the total cost of a new airplane . Those savings would make Douglas more competitive , he said . &quot; They want technical improvement as well as a financial improvement , &quot; Nisbet said . When the Taiwanese deal was being negotiated , McDonnell was in much worse financial shape than it is today . But due_to the layoffs and other major cost-cutting steps , it is now solidly profitable and has been significantly cutting its debt . Douglas Aircraft had an operating profit of $ 40 million last year . * Nonetheless , 40 % ownership in Douglas today is probably worth between $ 1 billion and $ 1.5 billion -- compared to the $ 2 billion the Taiwanese were considering paying -- because of Douglas ' continued sales problems and the weakness in the airliner market , Nisbet said . After the Italian talks were disclosed , McDonnell ' s stock jumped $ 2 to a record $ 122.125 a share_in New York Stock_Exchange composite trading .
