   <TEXT> Hannes Trinkl of Austria posted the fastest time , 1 minute 45.55 seconds , in the first training run_on the Kvitfjell downhill course . Men ' s Alpine skiing begins Sunday with the downhill . American Tommy Moe was 11th , teammates Kyle Rasmussen and AJ Kitt 16th and 29th , respectively . Kitt and Moe are among the many fans of the course , designed by Bernhard Russi of Switzerland , who won the gold medal in the 1972 Olympic downhill and took the silver medal behind Austrian Franz Klammer in ' 76 . &quot; I think in comparison to the last two ( Olympic courses ) , this one is the best for_sure , &quot; Kitt said . &quot; This course offers the most diversity. &quot; Said Moe : &quot; I think this is the best course Russi has designed yet . It took him three times to get_it right , but this is the best one. &quot; There were concerns that , with so_much snow , the course might be too slow . But Russi does not think that will be the case . &quot; The icy areas will make the course just as difficult as it was during last year ' s World Cup race , &quot; he said . &quot; I would not make changes in the course , even if I could . It is exactly the way I wanted it to be. &quot; * There is some concern among athletes that the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan saga will overshadow other Olympic events . &quot; I think what happened is unfortunate , &quot; Rasmussen said . &quot; But if the skating controversy is what ' s important to the press and they feel the public wants to read about it , then I guess we have to take a back seat . In my opinion , if you want to experience the excitement of the Olympic Games , then come watch the downhill. &quot; CHRIS DUFRESNE</TEXT>
