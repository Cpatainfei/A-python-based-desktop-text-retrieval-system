   <HEADLINE> BRENTWOOD : ON THE WRONG SIDE OF THE STREET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Re : Article on Brentwood in Westside Aug . 14 ( cover story ) . The photo of the San Vicente Strip on page 14 is either reversed or Brentwood has become so tony that only English cars are permitted and the traffic_patterns have been adjusted accordingly.Apparently , I have been driving my Mercury Sable on the wrong side of the street all these many years . Will I now need a visa to enter this enclave from my less upscale neighborhood in Los Angeles ? BILL CROSSON , Los Angeles ( Editor ' s note : The photo was inadvertently reversed. )</TEXT>
