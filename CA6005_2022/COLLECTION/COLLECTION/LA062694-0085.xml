   <HEADLINE> AT THE STRETCH ON HEALTH_CARE -- BUT WHAT ' S THE PLAN ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> And now the really big question about health-care reform : Will the final legislation include Rita ' s phone_number ? As a congressional vote on health- care reform draws_near , it is impor tant to keep Rita ' s phone_number in mind . In 1981 , when the tax-cut plan proposed by Ronald Reagan was approaching its floor vote , the provisions of the bill were changing so frantically that members of Congress never saw a printed version of the bill before the final vote . Instead , they voted yea or nay on a sheaf of handwritten pages scrawled down by White_House lobbyists . One page included the notation &quot; CALL RITA , &quot; with a phone_number . This historic message was then dutifully transcribed into the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations . After all , it had been formally approved by Congress . It turned_out the legislators who voted on the 1981 tax-cut bill not only did not know that it contained Rita ' s number , they barely understood any of the provisions : Chief among them that the law would create the mega-deficits that have plagued the federal_government since . This is the gathering dynamic on health-care reform . Hardly anyone can keep the provisions of the various &quot; managed competition &quot; proposals straight anymore . There exists considerable danger that when the House and Senate act to restructure the $ 900-billion health-care industry that , at about 14.5 % of the gross_national_product , is larger than the auto and petroleum industries combined , many members of Congress will have only the faintest notion of what is in the bill . Let ' s see , there ' s the Clinton plan , the Cooper plan , the Cooper-Breaux version of the Cooper plan , the Kennedy plan , the Moynihan plan , the Chafee plan and the Dole plan -- to cite only the major proposals . These plans call_for some version of voluntary mandated subsidized market-oriented standardized individual trigger-financed seasonally rotated regional alliances ( with subsection D attainment zone waivers ) for universal coverage ( except for those not covered ) beginning in the 1998-23rd Century time frame . The cost will be precisely approximately $ 25.95 to $ 500 billion , though we haven ' t yet figured_out if that is annually , or per person . Not only are the provisions of the plans dimly understood : They are now changing so fast even policy wonks have difficulty remembering what stipulation is in which bill . After all those months of Hillary Rodham Clinton ' s black-cloaked health-care monks coming_to nuanced positions covering minute details , now in the rush to enact something , matters as fundamental as whether employers will be required to pay_for health coverage , or only asked to pay , are being revised on an almost daily basis . New cost estimates are essentially being pulled_out of the air . To a certain extent , this is a predictable result of Clinton ' s proposing a bill that , at 1 # 364 pages , was so complicated there was never a chance people would be able to keep its provisions straight . Then , when the first congressional opposition arose , White_House officials began saying that everything was negotiable except for universal coverage . This meant open season . Now , almost every major chairman of a relevant committee in the House and Senate has a reform bill -- most cobbled-together admixtures of buzzwords and loopholes . An example is the &quot; trigger &quot; provision every bill suddenly seems to contain . Rather than an immediate requirement that employers provide health_insurance , &quot; trigger &quot; provisions specify that if all Americans do not acquire health coverage five or 10 years down the road , employer mandates would be imposed . The &quot; trigger &quot; approach is a classic example of the political gimmick of taking credit for action today but postponing the hard work into the future . Anyone remember the Gramm-Rudman bill ? Enacted in 1985 , it declared with great fanfare that , henceforth , Congress would be compelled to balance the budget -- but postponed enactment of balanced_budgets into future years . Gramm-Rudman allegedly had &quot; trigger &quot; provisions that future sessions of Congress would never be able to dodge . Every one was dodged . Health-care trigger provisions appear to have about as much actuality as Gramm-Rudman . Since there is zero chance that universal coverage will achieve itself spontaneously , either an employer-mandate trigger would be &quot; hard , &quot; written in such a way as_to be automatic , and thus would be a dishonest provision , shifting the accountability to a future Congress and White_House ; or the trigger would be &quot; soft , &quot; a Gramm-Rudman-style provision written so it can be easily circumvented . That prominent Democrats such_as Sen . Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York are now speaking kindly of triggers , and Clinton has said he will consider them , indicates that serious health-care reform is in the process of evaporating . In fact , at this point it ' s not even clear just what reform Clinton ' s bill would achieve , let alone what would be achieved by any of the many watered-down alternatives . Clinton ' s plan , all major Democratic alternatives and the moderate Republican alternative backed by Sen . John H . Chafee of Rhode Island ought to be rechristened &quot; insurance-reform &quot; bills . All would outlaw the practice of health insurers barring coverage for those with pre-existing illnesses ; make_it easy for people who change jobs to change plans ; make_it easy for the self-employed to buy health_insurance ; impose some version of &quot; community rating &quot; where premiums are about the same for all who subscribe_to the same plan , and require standardized insurance packages so that consumers could make meaningful price comparisons when they shop polices . All these are valid reforms whose enactment will benefit consumers . Most are even reforms the health-insurance industry knows are needed , but that will only work if realized through uniform national legislation that keeps competition among individual companies equal . Beyond that , it ' s not clear what , if any , health-care reform will be accomplished . Clinton has repeatedly -- and rightly -- said the fact that the United States is the sole industrial nation without universal health_care is an outrage , and that he would veto any bill that does not create universal health_care . But his is the sole &quot; managed competition &quot; bill facing this issue head-on . Edward M . Kennedy ' s plan waffles . The Cooper bill , authored by Rep . Jim Cooper ( D-Tenn. ) , pointedly dodges universal coverage . Moynihan ' s makes hazy promises about revisiting the issue in a decade or so . Further on the non-reform front , Clinton ' s mandatory regional health alliance requirement ( whatever it means ; no one has ever understood it ) is teetering and may be withdrawn . Some of the plans now call instead for creation of health-purchasing cooperatives , but these sound hauntingly like existing HMOs and PPOs . And the goal of containing health costs -- the goal that most frightened the entrenched hospital , pharmaceutical and physician interests -- has , to the pleasure of these groups , been forgotten in the ruckus . Cooper ' s plan contains some non-binding mumbo-jumbo about how it would be nice if market forces drove down costs . Clinton ' s plan is gradually being stripped of what meaningful cost-control measures it once had . The Kennedy , Moynihan , Chafee and other proposals barely mention cost controls . If what ultimately passes Congress is health-insurance reform plus some vague language about purchasing co-ops , the aftermath for Clinton will be strange . Genuine good would be done_by such a bill , particularly for the self-employed and those in the Kafkaesque position of being unable to obtain health_insurance because they need it . Health-insurance reform is a long overdue objective that neither Ronald Reagan nor George_Bush would have touched with a 10-meter pole . Had the goal going_in been health-insurance reform , Clinton would deserve praise for reaching it . But Clinton set for himself the high moral goal of universal coverage , and now may_not attain it . This will enable pundits and Clinton ' s opponents to portray the bill as a defeat . Voters may end_up thinking_of the bill as a success for Clinton -- because the insurance-reform aspects will be a boon to the middle_class , particularly anyone who changes jobs or falls ill . Today middle-class complaints about health_care turn not on costs or quality but on the problems of obtaining or keeping coverage . These will likely be solved by whatever bill Congress enacts . To the extent that middle-class voters come_to feel their health-care complaints have been resolved by Clinton ' s actions , they will care less about the system ' s two basic faults -- the shameful lack of coverage for 15 % of Americans , and the health-cost spiral that consumes ever more national wealth . Meanwhile , the sole bill that does address both universal coverage and the need to control costs -- the national-health or &quot; single payer &quot; legislation sponsored by Rep . Jim McDermott ( D-Wash. ) -- now has 91 co-sponsors . This means that despite the continuous impression given_in health-care commentary that no sentiment exists in U.S. politics for national health_care , nearly a quarter of the House is now on record as favoring this approach . British-style national health_care would be a disaster . But France and Germany have national-health systems that provide universal coverage at a significantly lower percentage of GNP than the U.S. system , with no rationing , no waiting lines , hi-tech care and handsome incomes for doctors . These systems combine that best of market medicine -- private practice physicians , privately administered insurance pools -- with national cost controls . National health_care can work . It will work someday in the United States : Maybe sooner than you think , especially if what is billed as sweeping health-care reform passes in 1994 , but fails to address the system ' s root problems of cost runaway and the uninsured .</TEXT>
