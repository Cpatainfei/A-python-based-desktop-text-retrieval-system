   <HEADLINE> MEXICO MOVES TO COUNTER REBELS ; CHIAPAS : NO ARMED CLASHES REPORTED AS GOVERNMENT SENDS ARMY TO RETAKE AREAS HELD BY ZAPATISTAS . PRESIDENT , CITING A ' CLIMATE OF INSECURITY , ' DEVALUES THE PESO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With nearly a dozen towns in open revolt and dozens more infiltrated by armed Indian rebels and peasant supporters in Chiapas , the Mexican army on Tuesday sent a convoy of armored vehicles and hundreds of troops and riot police to tear_down roadblocks , retake rebel-held territory and reassert the government ' s tenuous authority in the southern state . In a show of military_force after a day of peaceful insurrection that rocked Mexico ' s investment market and threatened the national economy , hundreds of soldiers and riot police cleared felled trees from highways and pulled_down banners declaring &quot; Welcome to Zapatista Territory. &quot; Citing a &quot; climate of insecurity &quot; that they attributed to the Zapatistas ' latest mobilization , President Ernesto Zedillo ' s economic advisers announced after an all-night meeting that the government was forced to devalue the peso , effective immediately . That extreme move forced the peso down 15 % -- bitter medicine for most Mexicans less than a week before Christmas -- and underscored how Chiapas has become a critical test_case with far-reaching implications for the new president . There were no reports of armed clashes as the convoy moved through mountainous Chiapas . At least 11 of the 38 towns that the rebel Zapatista National Liberation Army claimed to have &quot; liberated &quot; on Monday publicly declared their allegiance to a parallel &quot; government in rebellion , &quot; which was set_up last week by the state ' s opposition leader , Amado Avendano . The populist newspaper_publisher is regarded by the Zapatistas as the state ' s legitimate governor . Witnesses , local officials and news_agencies reported that most of the armed rebels , dressed in the Zapatistas ' trademark ski_masks and bandannas , appeared to have fled to surrounding mountains from positions they had occupied on Monday , including the town of Simojovel de Allende about 30 miles north of the city of San Cristobal de las Casas . The federal forces peacefully retook Simojovel Tuesday night , nearly 24 hours after local officials said the rebels had left . Zedillo insisted in a speech in Mexico_City on Tuesday that the army remained committed to its unilateral cease-fire . But in a clear attempt to turn public_opinion against the Zapatistas and their charismatic leader , the president took the verbal offensive against the rebel group , blaming them for the nation ' s deepening economic woes . &quot; This is a conflict that has caused too_much anguish in all Mexicans , a conflict that has slowed_down the economic recovery and has cast a shadow over the prospects for the country ' s economic development , &quot; Zedillo declared at a cultural engagement . &quot; It is a conflict that has slowed job creation , a conflict that has begun to cut_into the Mexicans ' savings and threatens their fair aspirations for well-being , above all for the men and women of Chiapas. &quot; The president also indicated that his government may arrest and prosecute the Zapatistas , and not only for Monday ' s actions . He said he had ordered the attorney_general to investigate whether the rebels and their leader can be charged with federal crimes for any of their acts since they first rose_up against the government Jan . 1 . But Zedillo reiterated that , after speaking_to &quot; all major political figures in the country , &quot; he was standing by his commitment to negotiation rather than aggressive military_action in Chiapas . &quot; Today , I reiterate my government ' s determination always to search for avenues of dialogue and negotiation to resolve the conflict in Chiapas and any other place , &quot; he said . &quot; In this search , our patience never will be exhausted , even when confronted with the isolated acts of violence that have taken_place in the last hours. &quot; In fact , there had been no reports of violence or clashes on Monday either , although it remained unclear whether the army would encounter opposition as it continued to move through areas the rebels seized the previous day . And so far , the worst impact of the Zapatista mobilization appeared to be in the nation ' s economic markets . The movements drove Mexico ' s stock_market down more_than 4 % on Monday , shocked financial communities in the United States and Europe and left political analysts in Mexico_City increasingly concerned that the revolt could spread . Similar chaos is brewing in several other Mexican states , where post-election opposition protest movements similar to the one that ruptured the Zapatistas ' 11-month truce in Chiapas have shut_down oil_wells in Tabasco and blockaded town_halls in other states this week . Zedillo ' s handling of the Chiapas crisis , political analysts say , will help determine the future stability of Mexico . Bolstering the president ' s strategy to isolate the Zapatistas and turn public_opinion against their leader , who uses only the nom_de_guerre Subcommander Marcos , are recent opinion polls showing Zedillo with strong popular support nationwide . A weekly opinion survey by a Mexican pollster just before the Chiapas crisis erupted indicated that 84 % of Mexicans supported Zedillo ' s Cabinet choices , his proposals for sweeping judicial reforms , increased powers for the elected Parliament and a legislative peace commission for Chiapas ; 58 % -- 10 % more_than voted for Zedillo on Aug . 21 -- said their opinion of Zedillo and his new government was favorable . But in Chiapas , one of Mexico ' s most impoverished states , where a history of favoritism and ruling-party corruption spawned the Zapatista movement a year ago , the rebels still appeared to have widespread popular support . * ECONOMIC MEDICINE : Mexico devalues pero 15 % .
