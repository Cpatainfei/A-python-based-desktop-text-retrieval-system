   <HEADLINE> BANKING ON CHINA AS A TRADE GOLD MINE ; ASIA : THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK HOPES TO BOOST U.S. BUSINESS WITH BEIJING WITH LOW-RATE LOANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Westinghouse Electric Corp . recently took_advantage of the growing Chinese economy by signing a $ 140-million contract to supply power generators in China . As with U.S. companies seeking opportunities in China , the deal was made_possible in part by financing from the U.S. Export-Import Bank . The Ex-Im Bank -- a government lending agency that seeks to boost U.S. exports -- hopes to play a big role in increasing U.S. corporate activity in China , bank Chairman Kenneth Brody said Thursday after returning from a trip to China promoting U.S. business there . China -- already the bank ' s largest lending market in Asia -- will become its biggest lending market in the world over the next few years , he said . &quot; Our purpose is single-minded : Create American jobs by financing U.S. exports , &quot; Brody said . The bank estimates 20 # 000 American export jobs will be created for every $ 1 billion that the bank lends to support U.S. trade with China . Chinese trade analysts say there is immense potential for American companies to tap into the Asian_nation . With a burgeoning infrastructure , China plans to build 60 new airports , buy airplanes , install power facilities and construct phone_lines . Also , because Chinese foreign debt is very low and growth is so strong , there is confidence that China will repay its loans , said Wei Li , assistant_professor of economics at the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University . &quot; For a lot of U.S. companies , it ' s the recognition that now there is a very specific market niche for them , &quot; said Vanessa Whitcomb , associate editor of China Business Review . The Ex-Im Bank promotes trade through loans to foreign companies and countries under the condition that they will buy goods and services from American companies . U.S. companies who need money to begin exporting products are also supported through various loans . The bank supported $ 1.3 billion in exports to China in its fiscal 1994 , a 63 % increase from $ 800 million in fiscal 1993 . Applications are being reviewed for another $ 3.3 billion in support funds for future projects in the country . Expanded Ex-Im Bank financing of exports to China is part of the Clinton_Administration ' s new policy to help U.S. companies compete more effectively in the global marketplace through what is called &quot; Tied Aid , &quot; or government-backed aid . Until recently , U.S. companies received very little support when up against foreign corporations that were supported by low-interest , long-term loans from their respective government lending organizations . But since 1993 , under the new Clinton_Administration policy , the Ex-Im Bank has provided its own long-term , low-rate loans -- called &quot; soft &quot; loans -- to aid U.S. exporters . This will level out the playing_field when American companies bid against foreign competitors for contracts , said Brody . &quot; Ex-Im Bank has decided that getting_in on the ground_floor will create more opportunity for our exporters , &quot; he said . Brody met with industry ministers and heads of several large Chinese banks during his eight-day trip throughout the country . Thanks to China ' s substantial economic and policy reforms , the U.S._government has further expanded economic relations with the country . The bank is considering stationing an Ex-Im representative to China within the U.S. embassy there , Brody said .</TEXT>
