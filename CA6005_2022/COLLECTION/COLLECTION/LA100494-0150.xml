   <HEADLINE> A COLLEGE PAL LEAPS BEYOND ITS EARLY IMAGE ; TECHNOLOGY : KINKO ' S SERVICE CORP . IS EXPANDING BEYOND ITS TRADITIONAL COPYING BUSINESS WITH NEW INFORMATION SERVICES , THE LATEST OF WHICH IS VIDEO CONFERENCING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For years , Kinko ' s Service Corp . has been known as the photocopy place . Legions of college_students have been weaned on the nationwide chain ' s 24-hour service , the salvation of many_a last-minute term paper . But by the late 1980s , to keep_up with new office equipment technology , Kinko ' s decided it had to join the information age . So the Ventura company installed Apple Macintosh computers for customers to use in its stores , alongside its longtime staples -- copying documents , self-service copying and passport photo services . Over the next several years , it added fax machines , IBM personal_computers , large-format document copying , posters and color copiers . And in April , Kinko ' s jumped_on the information superhighway . About 100 of its 725 stores now offer video conferencing rooms , with the ability to link video and voice signals over phone_lines with other locations . The next step Kinko ' s foresees is giving customers the ability to communicate with stores electronically , so they may order copies via their home or office computer in Los Angeles , for instance , to be distributed in New York . Kinko ' s hopes to move away from the image that ' s stuck_with it since it was founded 24 years ago : that of a photocopy store catering primarily to college_students . While Kinko ' s still serves the college market , more_than anything it wants to be known as the &quot; branch office &quot; for entrepreneurs , telecommuters , traveling business people and local representatives of corporations based elsewhere . It also wants to lure more consumers who will use Kinko ' s for personal tasks , such_as creating custom party invitations , enlarging photos and mounting them and mailing and delivery . * With the new services , however , Kinko ' s runs a_couple_of risks . Its strategy requires investing heavily in sometimes expensive technology -- just one color copier , for example , costs about $ 50 # 000 -- and continuing to invest as technology improves . The trick is to avoid relying_on technologies that have become commonplace , like fax machines , but at_the_same_time to avoid rushing ahead with something that consumers might not be ready for . &quot; All technology takes a burn-in period , &quot; said Kinko ' s President Dan Frederickson . Kinko ' s expects to invest $ 20 million in its video conferencing venture and , he said , &quot; The gamble is whether the timing is right or not. &quot; At the same time , Frederickson knows well that Kinko ' s has another problem : Many potential customers just don ' t seem to know about all_the new services . &quot; As long as we hear customers say , ' I didn ' t know you could do that , ' we ' ve got a problem. &quot; Frederickson plans to install video conferencing centers in more -- though not necessarily all -- Kinko ' s outlets . The service is set_up in a conference_room equipped with a large-screen television monitor with a camera on top and a device that resembles an oversized TV remote_control . A video conference doesn ' t come cheap -- $ 150 per site , per hour -- but Frederickson calls it a bargain compared with the cost of air fare , hotel_rooms and other travel expenses . Besides business people , he sees the service appealing_to families for video &quot; reunions &quot; and other special occasions , and the company is offering a half-price holiday promotion . Kinko ' s joint_venture partner on the video conferencing project is U.S. Sprint , which provides the phone_lines and a toll-free number to set_up a conference . Randy Doyle , Kinko ' s product manager , said he ' s now looking_into adding PCs to the system so participants in a conference can share and manipulate data and graphics during the meetings . So far , local Kinko ' s stores that have the equipment installed have found it slow going . The manager at the Kinko ' s store in Ventura reported averaging six or seven video conferences a week ; managers at the Encino and North Hills shops say they see only one or two a week . &quot; The biggest problem is , people just don ' t know about it , &quot; said Kinko ' s Encino manager Robert Crawford . Kinko ' s is the first in its industry to offer video conferencing , and Bob Hall , executive editor of Quick Printing magazine in Port St . Lucie , Fla. , questions whether many customers will want the technology . &quot; Somebody would have to show me where they ' re going to make money at that. &quot; Don Lowe , president of a Kinko ' s rival , Sir Speedy , a chain of 880 quick-printing and copy centers , based in Laguna Hills , said that investing in technology is &quot; a requirement today. &quot; Sir Speedy already offers electronic links to many of its customers , a service that is increasingly in_demand because it ' s convenient and saves customers time , he said . Lowe , however , said he decided to pass_on video teleconferencing . He felt the technology was not yet sophisticated enough , and &quot; by the time it is perfect , AT &amp; T will have those units in every office in the country and most hotels will have it. &quot; Lowe and others suggest that Kinko ' s might do_better to expand into offset_printing -- which rivals such_as PIP Printing and Sir Speedy offer -- because of growing corporate demand for quick-turnaround print jobs . &quot; Ten thousand envelopes and letters can be significant bread-and-butter &quot; business , Hall said . * The entire quick-printing industry , as it ' s called , includes 35 # 000 printing and photocopying stores nationwide , ranging from those of large franchised chains like Agoura Hills-based PIP , to small mom-and-pop shops . But in the past five years the industry has matured to_the_point where it ' s now consolidating ; in 1993 , PIP closed or chose not to renew franchises on 103 shops , according to Quick Printing magazine . But generally the large chains like Kinko ' s are better positioned to survive the ongoing industry shakeout and invest in the new services that customers want , Hall said . Kinko ' s already enjoys some clear advantages because of its size , said Hall , including the ability to cut favorable deals with equipment suppliers like Xerox and Canon . It also helps that about 100 stores are owned solely by Kinko ' s reclusive founder and chairman , Paul Orfalea , and the rest are co-owned in partnerships by Orfalea and other investors . Orfalea , who declined to be interviewed , also owns Kinko ' s Financial Services , an internal financing unit . This common ownership gives the company a strength of management , Hall believes , that franchised networks have difficulty achieving . In addition to the new services , Kinko ' s has an aggressive growth plan calling_for another 150 stores to open in 1995 . It ' s also pushing into foreign markets like Japan , where it is opening its third Kinko ' s in a joint_venture with the huge Japanese concern Sumitomo . Several stores are being planned for Canada . It has one store in Holland and hopes to add more in Europe . Company executives won ' t disclose revenues or profits . But a Dun &amp; Bradstreet report put 1992 sales of the 81 Kinko ' s stores then owned solely by Orfalea at $ 80.9 million . The report said that 95 % of sales came from photocopying and duplicating services , unlike rivals such_as PIP and Sir Speedy , where offset_printing services also make_up a large share of sales . Lloyd Greif , president of Greif &amp; Co. , a Los Angeles investment banking firm , estimated that Kinko ' s sales average about $ 700 # 000 per store and that total revenues for all_the Kinko ' s stores is about $ 500 million . He said Kinko ' s are probably &quot; nicely profitable &quot; and acts quickly to shut_down money-losing stores . Kinko ' s management is &quot; held_in high esteem in the industry . They ' re tight operators . They ' re also more of a competitive threat to a lot of other players in the industry. &quot; Greif said Kinko ' s is entering a more demanding marketplace with its branch office concept and its effort to grab more business customers . It ' s a tough call , Frederickson admitted , to balance the several hundred_thousand dollars needed to open a new store against the expense of keeping existing stores stocked in new equipment . Add_to that the training Kinko ' s 17 # 000 employees must undergo to learn to use the machines and to be more helpful in counseling business clients . &quot; I think this technology is going_to change really fast , and there are costs associated with that , &quot; Frederickson said . Despite the investments needed , Frederickson said that selling stock to the public isn ' t in the company ' s current plans -- as has been rumored -- although he won ' t rule it out for the future . that ' s the kind of decision that might have seemed inconceivable in 1970 , when Orfalea , now 47 , started selling school supplies to UC Santa Barbara students . The first Kinko ' s shop in Isla Vista , named after the wiry texture of Orfalea ' s hair , was so small that the copy machine was wheeled out on the sidewalk to make room inside for customers . The business took_off , however , and Orfalea added more stores . In 1988 , he moved the corporate headquarters to Ventura . Even then , a big part of Kinko ' s business was still copying portions of textbooks for college_students and professors . But a 1989 lawsuit by a group of textbook publishers -- which Kinko ' s lost -- put it out of that line_of_work . Frederickson said that losing the case was more coincidental to Kinko ' s decision to change its focus away from students and that the company was already well along in implementing its broader strategy . Over the years , Kinko ' s has made Orfalea a wealthy_man . In addition to his Kinko ' s holdings , he owns stakes in about two_dozen small retail and apartment_buildings throughout the state and a $ 1.4-million Santa Barbara home . Though Orfalea avoids the spotlight , Frederickson said the Kinko ' s founder is still very much involved_with store operations , new products and strategy . But Orfalea shuns industry gatherings , Hall said , and after several past attempts to elicit his cooperation has only this year agreed to Quick Printing magazine ' s naming him its &quot; man of the year. &quot; Orfalea ' s shyness has reflected itself in Kinko ' s low profile . But if Kinko ' s is to succeed in the information highway age , Hall said , that will have to change . &quot; They ' re going to have to get the word out , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s great to have all these capabilities , but they don ' t do any good unless your customers want them. &quot;</TEXT>
