   <HEADLINE> METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF : LOS ANGELES AIRPORT ; AIRPORT PANEL TO CONSIDER ADDING RESTAURANTS , BARS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Airport commissioners will consider a plan today to allow more restaurants and bars in Los Angeles International Airport terminals , including fast-food chains , upscale eateries and cafes . The move is intended to give travelers more food and beverage choices as they pass_through the nation ' s third-busiest airport , and to improve LAX ' s profitability , Commission President Ted Stein said. &quot; We ' re trying to make Los Angeles into a world-class airport , and the food and beverage concessions ( should ) reflect that , &quot; Stein said . In the future , travelers waiting for flights could sip cappuccino at Starbucks or dine on pasta at a California Pizza Kitchen , he said . If all goes as planned , the change would help drive_up airport revenues , which could be used to pay_for city services . But the city still must win federal approval to divert those LAX profits . The proposal calls_for offering eight more concession contracts-four for fast-food establishments and four for specialty restaurants and bars . Host-Marriott Inc. now runs all airport restaurants and bars . Airport officials could begin the search for new concessions within a month , but the new establishments probably would not open in time for the World Cup soccer tournament this summer , Stein said .</TEXT>
