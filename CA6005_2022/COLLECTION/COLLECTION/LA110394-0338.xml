   <TEXT> In the early hours of July 6 , Jenny , head of a software piracy ring based in the Pacific Northwest , paced impatiently in front of a rack of high-speed personal_computers , waiting for the phone_call that would make her a superstar in the pirate underground . It would come from an employee of LucasArts Entertainment Co . in San Rafael , who for $ 300 would supply Jenny ' s pirate group with one of the most anticipated games of summer : &quot; TIE Fighter , &quot; based on the &quot; Star Wars &quot; movie trilogy and priced at about $ 60 per copy . At LucasArts , the employee attached a small cellular modem to the back of his PC -- a technique that would keep any record of the call_off the company telephone_bill -- and dialed . Within a_few minutes , the program had arrived in Jenny ' s computer , lacking only the code keys that would make_it possible to play the game without an owner ' s manual . Jenny then dialed into the Internet , the global computer_network , and after taking several deliberate electronic detours she connected with a small computer in Moscow . There , a programming whiz who goes_by the name &quot; Skipjack &quot; quickly cracked the codes and sent the program back across the Internet to &quot; Waves of Warez , &quot; a Seattle bulletin_board popular_with software pirates . Within 24 hours , &quot; TIE Fighter &quot; would be available to thousands of software pirates in major cities around the world -- days before its official release date of July 20 . Welcome to the underside of the Internet , where stealing software has become highly sophisticated and hotly competitive -- pursued more for thrills than for money . It ' s a world where pirate groups build alliances , undertake mergers and sometimes launch all-out battles against rivals . And , contrary to common stereotypes , it is populated not only by nerdy teen-age misfits , but by a curious cross-section of computer enthusiasts looking_for some dangerous fun . Jenny , for example , is a woman whose hobbies include motorcycles and collecting rare_birds . The head of a big East Coast-based ring is a commercial airline pilot . Another group leader is a junior studying chemical_engineering at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh , Pa . Yet another is a grandmother , leader of an elite group called Nokturnal Trading Alliance . Their activities are , of course , illegal , potential felonies in many cases . And to most denizens of cyberspace , who use the Internet for scientific_research , legitimate commerce and legal forms of entertainment , the pirates are common vandals at best . Still , a number of pirates agreed to allow a reporter to observe their operations -- both in_person and via computer techniques that make_it possible to monitor computer activities remotely -- on the condition that their real names not be used . The economic impact of the pirates ' activities is difficult to measure . Electronic software theft via the Internet and other on-line services accounts_for about one-third of the $ 2.2 billion lost in the United States last year as a result of piracy , according to the Business Software Alliance , a trade group . Pirates who mass-produce CD-ROM and floppy_disks with stolen software pose a much bigger problem . But Internet software theft is growing rapidly , along with the global network itself . Even major , mainstream software programs -- like the new version of IBM ' s OS / 2 operating system -- are now routinely obtainable for free on the Internet . And the pirates ' activities have other consequences as well . They sometimes invade and effectively disable computers being used for scientific_research , for example . And many in the information technology industries fear that software theft and other illegal activities are giving the Internet a bad name just when it is gaining unprecedented popularity . Yet stopping the pirates turns_out to be a very difficult task . Law_enforcement agencies , software companies and even indignant individuals are stepping_up efforts to hunt_down electronic lawbreakers , but new methods of stealing and distributing stolen software are developed every day . By design , the Internet lacks any central administrative authority , and security procedures aimed at thwarting pirates could interfere with the philosophy of free and open communications that is integral to the network . Some suggest the thievery won ' t be stopped until &quot; bounty hunters &quot; are recruited from the pirates ' ranks and paid to hunt their former cohorts . It may be small comfort to the victims , but most of the pirates interviewed for this story insisted they were not in it for the money . &quot; It was just for the thrill of getting free software or logging onto pirate bulletin_boards that normal people don ' t know about , &quot; said Mike from Seattle , who says he has never earned a dime in his role as a &quot; courier &quot; for a pirate group . During the interview , conducted in a tidy suburban home that he shares with friends , Mike uploaded a new program -- &quot; Lode Runner for Windows &quot; by Sierra Games -- to the Internet from his custom-built computer . He then typed e-mail messages to other couriers notifying them of the new game and instructing them to copy it to various pirate sites around the world . There appear to be about 20 major groups dedicated to software piracy , a lengthy Times investigation has found , with names such_as Razor 1911 , Tristar Red Sector Inc. ( TRSi ) , Pirates With Attitude ( PWA ) , Revolutionizing International Piracy ( RIP ) , Legend , Malice and Anti Lamers Foundation ( ALF ) . The groups vary in size from 20 to 100 members , and most have a similar hierarchy : group leaders , senior staff , regional coordinators , couriers and members . The groups divide into two broad types : releasing groups , which arrange for software to be supplied and transferred to local computer bulletin_board_systems , and courier groups , which have a worldwide network of members who quickly transfer software from local bulletin_boards to the Internet for instantaneous worldwide distribution . Operators generally pay a pirate group_a &quot; donation &quot; of $ 50 to $ 200 per month to carry that group ' s software on their bulletin_boards . The more successful groups boast as_many as several dozen affiliated bulletin_boards . The logistics of coordinating these far-flung networks are daunting , but the pirates are resourceful . One crucial communications method is the Internet Relay Chat ( IRC ) system , a kind of citizens ' band of cyberspace that connects thousands of computer users in 21 countries . A particular series of channels , known as &quot; warez &quot; channels , are used both for conversation between software pirates and the on-line trading of freshly stolen software . But the IRC has its limits , and even computer hackers sometimes need to talk with each other . One method they have developed involves a &quot; beige box , &quot; or custom-built telephone . The pirate travels a distance from his or her home and taps into the exterior wiring of an apartment_building or house to arrange a conference_call , possibly involving 20 people or more in several countries , via an AT &amp; T Alliance Teleconference operator . The pirate controls the conference_call from a pay phone . But at the end of the month , the person whose line was tapped receives the bill -- which can run well into five figures . Several leaders of software pirating groups also described a method to avoid charges that involves a special computer_program , a pay phone and a recordable Hallmark greeting card that contains a small computer memory . The electronic sounds a quarter makes when dropped_in a pay phone are recorded on the memory_chip , then are played_back into the phone in lieu of depositing money . Despite the seeming ease with which many pirates stay one step ahead of law_enforcement , there are plenty of risks -- especially for those who work in the computer_industry . On Aug . 3 , Cupertino-based Symantec Corp. , best known for its line of Norton Utility software backup and security products , discovered an employee in its Baton_Rouge , La. , facility running a pirate site on a company computer . A Symantec source says the company took the unusual step of packing the offending computer inside a chilled and shielded container and flying it to corporate headquarters in Cupertino for laboratory analysis . The employee -- who the source said was motivated by &quot; the thrill of being a part of the pirate scene &quot; -- was fired . Last month , Dr. William L . Sebok , an astronomer at the University of Maryland , announced he had shut_down a large pirate site that contained more_than 500 megabytes of stolen software -- enough to fill half_a_dozen personal_computer hard_disks . The site had been running_on a laboratory computer used for processing images from the recent collision of Jupiter and the Shoemaker-Levy comet . The illegal use was detected three weeks ago when processing on the computer inexplicably slowed to a crawl . Maryland officials tried to trace the thieves back through the Internet , but met with little success : Many of the pirates were found to have used computer accounts belonging_to university_students in Switzerland , Spain and Slovenia who were unaware their accounts were being used for illicit purposes . Still , Sebok says the time he spent tracking the pirates was_well justified . &quot; I figured by shutting their site down , I would create a stir for ( the pirates ) that would be worth it for me . I didn ' t want to see the cockroaches tunneling through our computer_system any more , &quot; he said . Law_enforcement officials have grown more vigilant about computer crime of all types . A group of special FBI_agents now cruises the Internet , and many local and state law_enforcement agencies have been training investigators to root_out computer crime . But software piracy -- especially involving games -- takes a back seat to credit_card theft and other more destructive crimes . Dr. Gene Spafford , an associate_professor at Purdue University and a computer security expert , says software manufacturers and trade groups like the Software Publishers Assn . may have to resort_to frontier justice to stem the tide of illicit software being transferred over the Internet . &quot; Some of these same guys who are out pirating right now could very easily turn_in the rival groups for a buck or more , and they ' ll be very willing to do so , &quot; Spafford said . He expects to see bounty hunters who get paid based on damages recovered or convictions of software pirating groups . &quot; We are already seeing private_detective agencies investigating computer break-ins , because the local law_enforcement agencies aren ' t equipped , &quot; he added . Robert Roden , general counsel at LucasArts , said the growth of the Internet has made_it much easier for people to steal and distribute games around the world . Usually a company sends_out cease and desist letters to pirates if it can find them , but that has become harder , Roden said . &quot; If they ' re stealing ' TIE Fighter ' because they love the game , the irony in all_of it is that they ' re harming the thing they love , &quot; Roden added . &quot; They ' re making it more difficult for software companies to make these products and survive in the market. &quot; But the pirates aren ' t much impressed with that argument . On July 14 , a 20-year-old pirate nicknamed Drizzit took a morning drive from his home_in the San Fernando Valley to the Babbage ' s computer retail_store at the Glendale Galleria . He wanted to check if Lucas-Arts ' &quot; TIE Fighter &quot; game had come_in yet . Glancing inside , Drizzit could see the game had not arrived . On a shelf near the front of the store stood empty &quot; TIE Fighter &quot; boxes , gaily decorated with ribbons that said &quot; coming soon. &quot; Drizzit recalls laughing_at the sight of those empty boxes . &quot; The funny thing was , &quot; he later told a reporter , &quot; I ' d been playing that game for the last seven days . I ' d downloaded it off the Internet , I didn ' t have to pay_for it , I was up_to the sixth mission and it worked great. &quot; Internet Guide * Look_to the TimesLink online service for advice on hardware , software , Internet service providers , &quot; netiquette &quot; and navigating the ' Net .
