   <HEADLINE> DANA PARSONS : LITTLE DID WE KNOW THE TIMES THEY WERE A-CHANGIN ' US</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So I ' m on vacation last week , watching TV around midnight , when an infomercial came_on commemorating this summer ' s 25th anniversary of Woodstock . ( Can there be more compelling proof of our nation ' s spiritual decline than the fact that &quot; Woodstock &quot; and &quot; infomercial &quot; can now appear in the same sentence ? ) Maybe I over-invested in the revolution , but it just seemed a bit bourgeois that &quot; operators are now standing_by &quot; to help me experience Woodstock all_over again . John Sebastian , Woodstock participant and lead singer of the Lovin ' Spoonful , was the info-host . John made_it clear that I could relive the weekend at Yasgur ' s farm that changed our lives forever . . . assuming I had my Visa or Mastercard available . A day or so later , I was driving_around and a radio_station was playing the music of Buddy Holly to mark the 35th anniversary of his death . I don ' t remember if the deejay specifically noted that Holly ' s death changed our lives forever , but Don McLean said as much when he paid homage to it as &quot; the day the music died , &quot; in his 1971 song &quot; American Pie. &quot; Then , a couple days later , I picked_up the Sunday New York Times and read a front-page story on the Beatles . The article pointed_out that this week ( today , in fact ) marks the 30th anniversary of the Fab Four ' s first_appearance on the Ed Sullivan Show . Their performance on American television changed our lives forever , or as the Times put it , &quot; . . . neither ( the Beatles ) nor America emerged from it the same. &quot; I had the same feeling of remembrance last fall while watching a Madison Square Garden gala celebrating the 30th anniversary of the release of Bob Dylan ' s first album . A galaxy of rock and country_music stars -- and even ol ' Bob himself -- spent the evening playing and singing songs from the vast Dylan catalogue . It was a sure-fire reminder to all_of us who heard Dylan for the first time back in the ' 60s that our lives were about to be changed forever . Wait , there ' s more . This year will mark the 40th anniversary of the first time a young_man named Elvis Presley stepped into a recording_studio . I won ' t insult your intelligence by reminding you that was an event that changed our lives forever . History also tells us that 1954 was the year when Bill Haley originally recorded &quot; Rock Around the Clock , &quot; a record that changed the face of popular_music in America and that , yep , changed our lives forever . Stay tuned for details about any 40th anniversary events . Twenty-five years ago , &quot; Sesame Street &quot; premiered . Yes , Captain Kangaroo had been_on the scene long before that , but Bert and Ernie changed our lives forever . As if Woodstock weren ' t enough , 1969 also marked the release of the movie &quot; Easy Rider. &quot; You know what that means -- a 25th anniversary memoriam can ' t be far off . That was the movie that awakened a generation of pot-smoking hippies to the agenda of the Silent Majority , as Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper so graphically discovered at movie ' s end . It also introduced a young Jack Nicholson to many moviegoers . The rest , of course , is history . These anniversaries in 1994 couldn ' t come at a worse time , following on the heels of the anniversaries of 1993 . Topping that list , of course , was the 30th anniversary of President Kennedy ' s assassination , and the 25th anniversaries of Robert Kennedy and Martin_Luther_King ' s murders . This summer promises to be anniversary-heavy . In July , we ' ll celebrate the 25th anniversary of mankind ' s first_steps on the moon . History wasn ' t the same after that . Also , Ted Kennedy drove_off the bridge 25 years ago this July , probably changing American politics in the 1970s . Brace yourself for August . On the 7th , it ' ll be the 30th anniversary of the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution that got the Vietnam_War off and running . Then , just two days later , it ' ll be the 20th anniversary of the day Richard Nixon resigned the presidency . In case you forgot , both events changed our lives forever . Clearly , we ' re all going_to be doing a lot of reflecting this year , given that we ' re going to relive so many events that changed our lives . Speaking only for myself , I hope I have the energy to get_through them . At some point , maybe toward the end of the year , someone could ask the question : Just how often in one lifetime can our lives be changed forever ?</TEXT>
