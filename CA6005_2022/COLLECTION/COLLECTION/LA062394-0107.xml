   <HEADLINE> PERSONAL BEST : A CLOSE-UP LOOK_AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER ; HER PROGRAM HELPS REIN IN DISABILITIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Look_at Nikki ! &quot; Nora Fischbach said excitedly . Nikki , a 2 1 / 2-year-old girl with Down ' s syndrome , was into a full stand on the back of a pony , a feat that lasted only a second or two . But that was enough to make Fischbach happy . &quot; It teaches them ( disabled children and adults ) to trust and overcome their fears , &quot; explained Fischbach , program director for Special Equestrian Riding Therapy in Agoura Hills . Since 1987 , the program has helped children and adults overcome their disabilities , build speech and muscular control and resolve emotional problems , all on horseback . &quot; This has helped Nikki with balance and walking , &quot; said the child ' s mother , Sandi Finch of Calabasas , who has been bringing Nikki to the center since October . Finch said the program has made a world of difference for Nikki , who excitedly gives the sign that means &quot; horse &quot; when the car has turned_off the Ventura Freeway and onto Kanan Road , which leads to the ranch . Nikki ' s training sessions begin with volunteers selecting a helmet for her before sitting her in a special training saddle on Pony_Express , an older , white pony . The gait of a horse is similar to that of a person , and the rider can learn the balance and motion of walking from the horse , Fischbach said . The difference between this and other forms of physical_therapy , which can be grueling for a person with a disability , is that &quot; when you ' re on a horse , it ' s fun , &quot; she said . &quot; Most handicaps are in your mind , and not your body , &quot; said Fischbach , 47 , who has worked with the disabled as a volunteer since she was 13 . But even she has been surprised by the progress made at the ranch . Some of the riders have taken their first_steps &quot; right here at the ranch , &quot; Fischbach said . She also has seen some speak their first words and others receive a big boost in self-esteem . The riding therapy program was created by parents of disabled children . When Fischbach first heard of it shortly after its inception , she assumed it referred to the physically therapeutic benefits horseback riding offers . But Fischbach , who has a background in special_education and behavioral therapy , was battling a case of encephalitis , an inflammation of the brain and spinal_cord that had impaired her ability to walk . She told the program ' s organizers , &quot; If you can wait until I can walk again , I will help. &quot; She kept her word when she recovered from her illness . Fischbach said working_at the ranch keeps her spirits_up . &quot; I come here and everyone is smiling and laughing , &quot; she said . &quot; I can ' t stay sad here. &quot; Riders at the ranch range_in age from 18 months to 57 years old . They learn to help groom the horse and prepare it for riding . Sessions may last from 30 to 90 minutes depending_on the rider ' s ability . The horses are chosen carefully for their demeanor , and must learn not to get startled from the crashing noise of wheelchairs and crutches . When riders fall , horses usually will stop and wait until they climb back on . The animals know that their riders are special and make accommodations for them , Fischbach said . The ranch has 11 mostly older horses . Pony_Express , in his mid-20s , is one of the gentler animals . After a ride , he will put his hoof in a rider ' s lap . &quot; They bond to the horses , &quot; Fischbach said . That helps to reach children with emotional problems , she said . The riders learn to be kind and how to treat animals well , to take_pride in their achievements , to become aware of others -- lessons that can be transferred into their daily lives , she said . The 1 # 000-acre ranch has an assortment of other animals such_as ducks , pigs , peacocks , camels , llamas and ostriches , which also delight the riders . &quot; There was one rider whose first word was ostrich , &quot; Fischbach said .
