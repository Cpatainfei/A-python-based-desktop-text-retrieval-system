   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : WESTMINSTER ; CRITICISMS STALL CITY ' S GENERAL PLAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Approval of the city ' s general plan has been delayed because of objections from property_owners and local church leaders . Some property_owners are objecting to limits on traffic that future developments will be allowed to generate.And church leaders are against a new zoning designation for churches that they say could reduce the value of church_properties . City planners and consultants have been working_on the document for the past 18 months . After two hours of public hearings last week , the City_Council postponed approval of the general plan and directed city staff to try to resolve the problems with the property_owners and church leaders . Michael Bouvier , the city ' s building and planning manager , said the_matter could come_back to the council in April . The general plan would create &quot; planned development areas , &quot; which would allow mixed land uses , such_as residences within commercial zones , to give developers more flexibility , Bouvier said . Twenty-six such sites have been identified , including existing mobile-home parks , which could be converted to other uses in the future , he said . But city planners are placing limits on the amount of traffic that each development could generate to control congestion and comply with state pollution , noise and other requirements .
