   <HEADLINE> COURT DATE OF THE CENTURY ; LAW : SIMPSON AND FLEISS ARE BOTH SCHEDULED TO GO_ON TRIAL SEPT . 19 IN THE SAME BUILDING DOWNTOWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Call it the harmonic convergence of the mid-1990s . Call it a national_holiday -- Court Day , say -- and let everyone stay home and stare at their TV_sets . Call it anything you like . But the fact is , the murder trial of O.J. Simpson and the pandering trial of Heidi Fleiss are both scheduled to begin on the same day , Sept . 19 , in the same place , the Criminal_Courts Building in Downtown Los Angeles . &quot; It ' s tantamount_to hitting Lotto or going_to Vegas and having all_the coins fall_in your lap , &quot; said KCBS Channel 2 cameraman Carl Stein as he viewed Wednesday ' s contentious Simpson pretrial evidence hearing in a news van outside the 19-floor courthouse . The confluence of the two ongoing media &quot; cases of the century &quot; came_about this week when Fleiss ' defense_team was granted a continuance because defense_attorney Anthony Brooklier will be engaged in another trial on the East Coast on the previously scheduled date of Aug . 22 . &quot; It was coincidence , &quot; said district_attorney ' s office spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons . &quot; When ( Deputy Dist . Atty . Alan Carter , who is prosecuting the accused Hollywood madam ) came marching down to tell us , I said , ' Do you realize what day that is ? ' and he said , ' No. ' It didn ' t dawn on him at the time the defense made the motion. &quot; But some courthouse denizens are more_than a little skeptical . They believe Brooklier and Carter agreed on the new date at least in part to deflect media attention from the Fleiss proceedings . &quot; I ' d call it deliberateness , &quot; said defense_attorney Leslie Abramson , whose retrial of the Menendez brothers murder case , the third current Los Angeles &quot; case of the century , &quot; is_due to begin in late October . &quot; Nobody wants publicity on their cases ( and ) I ' m quite sure that they are both intelligent enough to have figured it out. &quot; For their part , TV executives can draw_on their industry ' s history as they weigh the perils of cutting_away to Heidi . In 1968 , after all , NBC drew the undying wrath of football fans when it shifted from the final minutes of a seesaw New York Jets-Oakland Raiders contest to begin airing the movie &quot; Heidi &quot; at its scheduled time . Where the Simpson case is concerned , no Heidi -- neither Alpine waif nor accused Hollywood madam -- is likely to preempt live coverage of the ex-football superstar ' s court proceedings . &quot; I mean , we are talking_about a murder case that ' s national in scope , &quot; said Sheryl Fair , news director for KABC TV Channel 7 . KTTV Channel 11 news director Jose Rios agreed : &quot; O.J. will continue to be the high-profile case. &quot; Of course , that ' s not to say there would not be plenty of cutaways if the Simpson jury selection process continues ad infinitum . &quot; I can imagine editors saying , ' While you ' re waiting , why don ' t you do the ' madam to the stars , ' &quot; KABC TV Channel 7 reporter Mark Coogan said as he stood on the courthouse steps along with nearly two_dozen TV and still photographers , waiting for Simpson attorney Robert L . Shapiro to leave the building . Coogan , like many courthouse observers , said the joint trial date is bound to give new meaning to the term &quot; media event , &quot; particularly at his outdoor perch , where TV and print photographers regularly battle for position to shoot trial participants . &quot; Can you imagine two rugby scrums for the price of one ? &quot; he asked . What ' s more , if both trials are proceeding at full steam in the days before November ' s state election , &quot; Kathleen Brown , Pete Wilson , Dianne Feinstein and Michael Huffington will have to be picketing out_in the street here because that ' s the only way they will be_on TV , &quot; Coogan added . * Inside the courthouse Wednesday , some officials said they were unfazed by the dual trial dates of the case of the brown glove and the case of the black_book . &quot; Sept . 19 is just another day , &quot; said Criminal_Courts coordinator John Iverson . &quot; It ' s a big court system and there are 35 Superior_Court criminal judges in this building alone. &quot; But others conceded that the circumstances are more_than a little amazing . &quot; We ' ve been kidding among ourselves about what would be the ingredients to turn this building into the mass media event of the century , &quot; said district_attorney ' s office spokesman Mike Botula . &quot; We figured it was the convergence of the Heidi Fleiss and O.J. Simpson trials . Then all_of a sudden , the prosecutor tells us the dream may well become a reality . &quot; Change that word dream , &quot; Botula added , catching himself , &quot; to nightmare. &quot; For some at the courthouse , two trials will probably mean more work . &quot; People have suggested they just ought to rent a stage at Paramount -- then you don ' t have to dress it up here every day , &quot; said Stein of KCBS as he packed two milk crates worth of cables , mixers and light stands after the Simpson hearing . Thirteenth-floor snack_bar operator Zohrab Bedikian feared that the double trials could actually cost him business . &quot; The media people don ' t bring_in that much , &quot; he said . &quot; And regular customers in the building don ' t stop in if they know the floor will be jammed. &quot; Moreover , the trial date of either case is subject_to change . &quot; The Fleiss date has been continued many times already and who is to say it won ' t be postponed again ? &quot; said Gibbons of the district_attorney ' s office . That did not stop at least two people from savoring the possibility of the dual trial dates . One was Deputy_Sheriff Keith Brown , the bailiff in the 13th-floor courtroom where the Fleiss case is scheduled . The Simpson case , he said , will draw far more media attention . &quot; Thank you , Lord , &quot; he said , looking_up at the ceiling . &quot; Thank you. &quot; The other was Aziz Muhammed , who was hawking &quot; Cut the Juice Loose &quot; T-shirts outside the courthouse . &quot; I ' m going_to call Heidi , &quot; Muhammed laughed , &quot; and ask her if she wants to think_about T-shirts of her own. &quot;</TEXT>
