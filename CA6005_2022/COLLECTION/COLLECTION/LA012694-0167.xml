   <HEADLINE> MAN BEHIND ' PEROT PHENOMENON ' SEES BIGGER CHANGES AHEAD ; JOHN J . HOOKER , A FLAMBOYANT DEAL-MAKER , ENVISIONS A 1996 CAMPAIGN WITH FIVE CANDIDATES FOR THE WHITE_HOUSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He ' s made and lost several fortunes . He ' s never held public office after a lifetime of lusting to be President . In his hometown , he ' s derided as a flamboyant blowhard and has-been by people who in their next breath praise his visionary brilliance . Now , John J . Hooker , lawyer , deal-maker and world-class eccentric -- the man credited ( or blamed ) for orchestrating Ross Perot ' s entry into the last presidential campaign -- is getting ready for 1996 with an even bigger idea : the end of American politics as we know it . Just remember you heard it from him first . Never mind that the &quot; Perot phenomenon &quot; he helped engineer fizzled like a bad spoof of a Frank Capra movie ; Hooker says that doesn ' t matter . &quot; The Perot phenomenon had nothing to do with Perot ! &quot; he said the other day . ( In Hooker-speak , every sentence ends with an exclamation point. ) &quot; It had to do with the American people wanting to take the government back , wanting one-man , one-vote and wanting to feel_like true participants ! &quot; What does this mean for 1996 ? This is Hooker ' s vision : five candidates , all with their own political_parties , running_for President in the general_election . One would be a Democrat , one a Republican , one would represent the far left , another the far right , and Hooker is betting that one will be Perot . &quot; The time has come_in America when people are going_to have candidates that will speak their point_of_view on a more meaningful basis than is possible under a two-party system ! &quot; he said . Perennial Democratic insider Bert Lance , Hooker ' s co-conspirator in formulating this theory of the American political future , put it another way : &quot; We ' re going to see a ballot that looks_like America. &quot; With five strong candidates , no single person likely could win sufficient votes_in the Electoral College , and selection of the President would be thrown into the House of Representatives . Hooker and Lance argue that this would be the start of coalition government , with various political factions uniting over common interests to pick a President . Critics say this is a recipe for chaos . &quot; I can see serious social and economic problems if the House elected the President , &quot; said George Barrett , a Nashville attorney active in state Democratic politics and a longtime friend of Hooker . &quot; It would open the door to the selection of a demagogue. &quot; There is also a contradiction embedded in the proposition , Barrett contends : While such a system would appear to give various constituencies a stronger voice in government , the actual selection of a President would be made by the 435 Washington insiders who make_up the House of Representatives . He sees this as far less responsive to the people than the current Electoral College system . After two years of running this theory past friends in private , Hooker and Lance took it public recently , spelling it out before an audience of Neiman Fellows at the Freedom Forum First_Amendment Center at Vanderbilt University . Perot proved that a candidate can get_on the ballot and win 19 % of the vote without support from the two major parties , even while running a &quot; bad campaign , &quot; Lance said . Hooker and Lance predict that either Patrick J . Buchanan or Pat Robertson , recognizing that they have no chance of winning the Republican_Party nomination , will launch an independent candidacy in 1996 . Hooker , a liberal who won overwhelming black support in his races for Tennessee governor in 1966 and 1970 , said that he is actively courting the Rev . Jesse Jackson to run in 1996 as the independent leftist candidate . He suggested , however , that the two-time presidential candidate lacks the fire to run . A spokeswoman for Jackson would say only that Hooker is a &quot; friend &quot; and would not comment on a possible candidacy . Sander Vanocur , the former TV political and diplomatic correspondent who is now working_at the Freedom Forum , criticized the plan as a Balkanization of the electoral process that would lead to congressional government . &quot; You all want excitement in politics , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t think you can govern with excitement. &quot; Hooker and Lance insist that they are not advocates . &quot; I ' m not at all happy about what is taking_place , &quot; Lance said . &quot; I ' m just saying change is out there. &quot; But they are not above agitating to help make_it happen . Urging Perot to enter the race , Hooker said , was the first_step to the realization of this vision . And what qualifies these two discredited politicos to advance such a theory ? Bill Kovach , former New York Times Washington bureau chief and now director of the Neiman Fellowship , introduced Lance at the forum as having a keen understanding of American politics -- a man so integral to the Jimmy_Carter White_House that when he resigned as budget director in 1977 , the Administration lost its effectiveness and vision . Lance , now a business consultant in Calhoun , Ga. , resigned because of a congressional investigation into allegations of mishandling funds at his Georgia bank . He was indicted on 33 federal counts of bank fraud , but a jury acquitted him of nine counts in 1980 ; the other counts were dismissed . He resigned as bank chairman in 1986 and agreed to pay a fine after being charged with violating federal security laws and making questionable loans . Despite his troubles , Lance ' s political judgment is respected . Walter F . Mondale nominated him -- unsuccessfully -- as Democratic Party chairman in 1984 , and Lance chaired Mondale ' s 1984 presidential campaign and advised Jackson in his 1988 bid . Hooker also has the ear of the politically powerful , despite being dismissed by many for his flamboyance and much-vaunted lack of personal discipline . &quot; John Jay is erratic , psychotic and brilliant , &quot; said Raymond Thomasson , an aide to Tennessee Gov . Ned McWherter . &quot; John Jay has an uncanny , unnatural ability to read individuals , to read groups of individuals and the winds of change and predict where things may go . . . . He is absolutely a visionary. &quot; John Siegenthaler , the Freedom Forum director and a former aide to Robert F . Kennedy , remembers being_on hand in 1968 when Hooker eloquently and movingly persuaded Hubert H . Humphrey to denounce the Vietnam_War . But this serious side is often hidden by the cartoonish character he created for himself to play four decades ago while still in law_school . The character , who wears a cream-colored homburg , dark vested suit , collar pin and gold watch fob , is in part a homage to his father , a larger-than-life Nashville trial_lawyer . Aside from advancing his new political_theory and planning a book , Hooker , 63 , is launching a new business venture . He describes it as being like the Domino Pizza franchise , only offering home-delivered full-course meals . In the 1960s , Hooker made his first fortune with Minnie Pearl ' s Fried Chicken . He had several hundred outlets when a Securities and Exchange Commission probe led to its collapse during his 1970 gubernatorial campaign . In 1991 , when Hooker helped orchestrate Perot ' s entry into the presidential race , he was widely described in newspaper_articles as a &quot; flamboyant millionaire. &quot; People who know him well say he was dead broke , a condition from which he has yet to extricate himself . Yet , he still keeps_up appearances while plotting his financial and political comeback . Still wearing his trademark uniform , he quickly takes_charge of any room he enters -- flirting_with any woman in_sight -- and he still insists on picking_up the dinner check . &quot; You can ' t be in a room with John J . Hooker and not know who he is ! &quot; he exclaimed . Times researcher Edith Stanley contributed to this story . Vision or Political Folly ? John J . Hooker is described as a brilliant deal-maker whose serious side is often masked by the cartoonish character he ' s created for himself . HOOKER ' S PLAN : Presidential general_elections with five strong candidates vying for the White_House .</TEXT>
