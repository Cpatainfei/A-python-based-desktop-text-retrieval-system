   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY : A COLE CHRISTMAS ; NATALIE ' S GIFTS : SINGING ON PBS AND ACTING IN USA MOVIE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Grammy Award-winning Natalie Cole is celebrating Christmas in a big way this year . She ' s recently released her first Christmas album , &quot; Holly and Ivy , &quot; in which she performs new songs as well as traditional holiday favorites . Of course , one of those Yuletide standards is the unforgettable &quot; The Christmas Song , &quot; which her father , the late , great Nat ( King ) Cole made famous . Cole , 44 , also headlines a &quot; Great Performances &quot; special on PBS -- &quot; Natalie Cole ' s Untraditional Traditional Christmas &quot; -- which premieres this week . Taped at SUNY Performing Arts Center in Purchase , N.Y. , the show features Cole performing holiday songs with the help of the New York Restoration Choir and &quot; Sesame Street ' s &quot; adorable Elmo . She seems most excited , though , about &quot; Lily in Winter , &quot; which premieres Thursday on the USA Network . In the heartwarming holiday drama , Cole plays Lily Covington , a maid and nanny working in New York City , circa 1957 . When she finds herself in a desperate predicament , Lily escapes on a train bound for her Alabama hometown . Unbeknown to her , though , her young charge Michael ( Brian Bonsall ) has come_along for the ride . When Michael ' s parents think Lily has kidnaped their son , the FBI gets_into the act . &quot; Lily in Winter &quot; marks Cole ' s movie debut and is directed by veteran Delbert Mann , who won an Oscar for 1955 ' s &quot; Marty. &quot; Though &quot; Lily in Winter &quot; is set_in New York , the production is being filmed in Los Angeles . Today , a stately old house on Adams Boulevard is doubling for the New York brownstone where Lily lives and works . Cole made her first foray_into acting nearly two years ago on the acclaimed 1991-93 NBC series &quot; I ' ll Fly Away &quot; as an educator who opens an alternative school in the pre-civil rights South . Acting , she says , is something she ' s contemplated for a long_time . &quot; I just wanted to make an impact , &quot; says Cole , who is dressed in black overalls , white blouse and matching black-and-white oxfords . &quot; I didn ' t want to start_up and do little sitcoms or cameo things . I really wanted to play a character. &quot; And she definitely didn ' t want to play a singer . Her father made several movies , including &quot; Cat Ballou &quot; and &quot; Istanbul , &quot; but was rarely cast in a non-singing role . &quot; That was my biggest beef , &quot; she says . &quot; I got offers : ' Do you want to act ? We have got a role for a singer. ' I didn ' t want to do that . It wasn ' t much of a stretch for me. &quot; A fan of &quot; I ' ll Fly Away , &quot; she approached the producers . &quot; I said , ' I would sure like to do your show . Do you think you could find a character for me that doesn ' t require me to sing ? ' It took about a year and they found a story. &quot; Cole says she wasn ' t too nervous her first time in front of a film camera . &quot; It was neat , &quot; she says , smiling . ' I ' m sure I was nervous , but the people I was working with were so professional . Quite a_few of them had thought I had acted before. &quot; Her guest shot on &quot; I ' ll Fly Away &quot; led to &quot; Lily in Winter. &quot; She says she immediately felt a real kinship with Lily . &quot; I just kind of slip into her , &quot; Cole says . &quot; When I first got made_up and they put all_the clothes on and the hat , I didn ' t know if I should laugh or cry . I thought it was the funniest thing I had ever seen . There was a part of me that said , ' I could be her. ' I was Lily for the first week more_than I was Natalie . That took some getting used to for my family . I didn ' t know who I was at the end of the week. &quot; Lily , Cole explains , &quot; is a lady who , somehow or other , wanted to have more for herself than when she was living_down South with her family . She found herself in a situation where she had a child at a very young age . She does end_up in New York and has a good job . It ' s almost like she ' s substituted this family for her family back home . She really does love this little boy , but she also has a little_girl that she has to pay_attention to . She hasn ' t done that for many years . Lily is someone who is very loving , just a little naive . She means well . She doesn ' t always make_good choices , like many of us. &quot; By the drama ' s conclusion , Cole says , Lily grows_up . &quot; She makes some decisions that she wasn ' t ready to make_for whatever reason . Now , she makes some really smart decisions . They are tough decisions because basically she sacrifices a way_of_life . Michael gets a little lesson , and Michael ' s parents get a lesson because if they hadn ' t been so busy , Michael would n ' t have run_away with the maid . It ' s really kind of neat. &quot; Cole considers herself blessed working with a director of the caliber of Delbert Mann . &quot; He is a charm , &quot; she says with enthusiasm . &quot; He knows what he wants , which I really like. &quot; Mann has nothing but praise for his star . &quot; She carries the whole picture , &quot; he says . &quot; She was totally professional , well-prepared , easy to work with , joyous to work with . She certainly doesn ' t have great experience as an actress , but she has been a performer and subjected_to rigid discipline of her profession . That carried_over into her professionalism on the set . Beyond that , she has very good instincts as an actress . It is a lovely star performance. &quot; And Cole can ' t wait to act again . Next time , though , she wants to play someone more contemporary . &quot; I would like to do something with a little action . I would like to play a cop or a tough lawyer and just totally move away from this . I don ' t want to be typecast. &quot; &quot; Great Performances : Natalie Cole ' s Untraditional Traditional Christmas &quot; airs Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. on KCET and KPBS ; 8 p.m. on KOCE and Thursday at 9 p.m. on KVCR . &quot; Lily in Winter &quot; airs Thursday at 9 p.m. on USA ; it repeats Dec . 11 at 8 p.m. and Dec . 17 at 4 p.m .</TEXT>
