   <HEADLINE> RESTAURANT REVIEW ; SENMI IS A TASTY SECRET ; * RESTAURANT IS ACCESSIBLE , AFFORDABLE , AND SATISFYING , BUT LITTLE KNOWN , EVEN TO NEARBY CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE STUDENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here ' s a howdy-do . Around the Cal State Northridge campus , chain restaurants usually fill to capacity , while great little ethnic haunts only a_few building-lengths away may sit two-thirds empty . Who said life ' s fair ? Most of the CSUNies don ' t know what they ' re missing in Senmi , an extraordinary Japanese noodle house along the lines of the one in the Juzo Itami film &quot; Tampopo. &quot; Convenient as it is to the campus ( and cheap : nothing over $ 7 ) , apparently only the Japanese students eat there . Curiously , Senmi ' s owner , Yoshihiro Yokochi , a go-getter with just enough English to take your order , looks_like a student himself . Senmi ' s decor is minimalist in the strict Japanese sense : white chairs , black tables , a_couple_of paper lanterns . It ' s so authentic-looking , the only way you can tell you haven ' t space-warped right into Japan is that there are Kikkoman and Tabasco bottles on all_the tables ; an odd cross-cultural effect . I find this style of Japanese food far more accessible than sushi , and a much more efficient road to quick satisfaction . Noodles are the staff_of_life in Japan , where sushi is really considered either a delicacy or a snack , depending_on the type . The aptly named Senmi ramen is probably the best thing on the menu . It ' s an enormous bowl of long , thin flour noodles in a broth infused with the essences of ginger , bamboo and garlic . You can order it as spicy as you want . Yokochi throws_in a handful of ground pork and sauteed vegetables for good measure , but the dish would be soulful enough without them . With them , it is a virtual epiphany for under $ 5 . One evening I made a meal of the delicious bacon spaghetti . Something looked familiar about it -- something non-Italian , I mean . Suddenly I realized that the topping was shredded nori , a kind of dried seaweed . Underneath , the tastes of mushrooms , Canadian_bacon and butter predominated , making_for a richer supper than you might expect . The plump flour noodles called udon are delicious in a fish-flavored broth ; the sansai , or dried mixed vegetable , is a topping . Gomoku literally means &quot; five flavors &quot; ; here , the soup is flavored with shrimp , carrots , bamboo , corn and mushrooms . Miso tanmen is a broth based on fermented beans , rounded_out by pork and vegetables . Those who prefer that their noodles not come floating in soup should go_for the buckwheat flour noodles called soba , which are cooked on a griddle . The best-known version is called yakisoba , here fried with chicken and vegetables . Yokochi has recently expanded his menu to include some appetizers and Chinese-influenced stir-fries , and even a_few setto -- set dinners including a quirky cabbage salad with Thousand_Island_dressing , miso soup , pickles and rice . My favorite appetizer is the delicious gyoza , which comes six to an order . These tiny , delicate pot-stickers have a meaty filling mixed with a little minced bamboo . Among the stir-fries , mabo tofu consists_of cubes of bean_curd in a spicy meat sauce . In origin , this is a staple of northern China , but the Japanese have improved upon it ( better tofu , more subtly spiced ) . The tasty pork and spicy vegetable stir_fry is , I suspect , the same thing as the topping that is tossed into your bowl of ramen . It goes well with rice , too , and here you get a lot more of it . The setto entrees are rather plain , but fresh and good to eat . The fried chicken -- small chunks wrapped in a light , golden batter -- tastes of fresh cooking_oil . When you order broiled mackerel , you get a whole fish with a firm flesh and strong flavors , the perfect companion for its accompanying mound of fresh ginger . I didn ' t order the Japanese hamburg steak , because it dawned on me that something akin to that would always be available at the Chili ' s across the street . But I couldn ' t help wondering whether at Chili ' s you can get a burger with soy , ginger and miso soup . Somehow , I didn ' t think so . Where and When What : Senmi .
