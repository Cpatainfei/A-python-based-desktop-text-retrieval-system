   <HEADLINE> SOUND &amp; VISION : ANTI-ABUSE TOOL CLIP TAKES NO PRISONERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Child-beating has been dealt with before in pop_music ( Suzanne Vega ' s &quot; Luka &quot; and 10 # 000 Maniacs ' &quot; What ' s the_Matter Here &quot; come_to immediate mind ) , but child sexual abuse is a more bitter pill to swallow musically . The uncompromising hard-rock band Tool has taken it on , though , in its &quot; Prison Sex &quot; video , which takes no prisoners in exploring the darkest of all possible worlds . Tool ' s unnerving clip tops this edition of Sound &amp; Vision , in which recent music videos are reviewed and rated on a 0-100 scale . Incidentally , there ' s more child_abuse -- of a sort -- happening at the bottom of this round-up as well . In Aerosmith ' s &quot; Crazy &quot; clip , the message left for the impressionable target audience seems to be that high_school girls can ( and , perhaps , implicitly , should ) use their nubile young bodies to wield sexual power over older_men . The Tool video condemns child_abuse ; the Aerosmith video virtually practices it . Ironic , or what ? Tool , &quot; Prison Sex. &quot; Absolutely the creepiest music video since Metallica ' s &quot; One , &quot; if not creepier . Tool ' s metallic meditation on the evils of child_abuse , told from the point_of_view of a perpetrator ( &quot; My lamb and martyr , this will be over soon ; you look so precious &quot; ) , is accompanied by spooky stop-motion animation that symbolically but graphically illustrates the torment of a sexually abused child . A small , porcelain-like figure -- cracked , broken_in two , imprisoned -- is fondled at uncomfortable length by the long , sinewy fingers of a tall , black , alien-like figure that could have emerged out of the sinister imagination of H . R . Giger . At times some of the effects -- like a moving , animate eyeball inside an otherwise hard and inanimate figure -- recall the avant-garde film work of the Quay brothers . But this clip ' s director , Tool guitarist Adam Jones -- who was trained in filmic special_effects -- seems to have a style of_his_own . It ' s not a style that most MTV viewers will take_to , but it does have a point_of_view , however disturbing . And those who pay close attention to the hard-to-follow lyrics and harder-to-follow video narrative will discover that &quot; Prison Sex &quot; is actually about a cycle of abuse ( &quot; Do unto others what has been done to you &quot; ) , which makes_it all_the more stomach-turning -- and queasily fascinating . 79 Pavement , &quot; Cut Your Hair. &quot; And now for something completely different . This spring ' s alternative darlings go_in for a collective trim , plopping down in the local barber ' s chair one by one , with successively surreal and unaccountably funny results even as no hair actually gets shorn . One member of the quartet , for example , gets crowned king when he sits in the special chair , but the video cuts_to a close-up of a tear rolling_down from one eye , a la that old public_service announcement with the weeping American_Indian . The gags are never what you expect , and the offbeat visual punch_lines pull their punches ; this is absurdism at its uncut finest . 75 Janet Jackson , &quot; Anytime , Anyplace. &quot; We ' ve heard of navel-gazing , but Jackson ' s preoccupation with documenting her own belly-button is getting beyond the point of curiousness . Her inverse achievements -- the less ample waist , the more ample cleavage -- are once again on proudly rampant display in this nicely shot clip , which takes_place in one of those mythical apartment_buildings that ' s terribly dingy yet lit in the most beautifully aphrodisiacal hues of red and blue . Jackson spies on a fellow apartment dweller through her keyhole , then sneaks over each night for a steamy series of secret trysts that may or may_not be fantasies . Zalman King , eat your soft-core heart out . 57 Green Day , &quot; Longview. &quot; Generation X-ers , arise and attack your couches ! that ' s the message at the finale of this video starring Green Day , a very &quot; new_wave &quot; band currently successfully passing for punk . The clothes , the geeky posture , the sneering into a wide-angle_lens -- these had seemed to go the way of all flesh 15 years ago , but perhaps each new generation of rock youth will get its own reconstitution of disaffection and snideness after all . But is the singer ' s climactic attack on_his_own furniture a symbolic assault on couch potato-dom , or just reflection of the fact that even Green Day knows guitar-smashing has already been done to death ? 56 Pink Floyd , &quot; Take It Back. &quot; Some sweet apocalyptic day , sings Floyd ' s David Gilmour , &quot; she will take it back &quot; -- she being the Earth itself , in this instance . Hot lava , angry geysers and other natural_phenomena have their way with the man-made world ; flowers and fauna rise_up through cracks in the pavement . It ' s &quot; The Revenge of Koyaanisqatsi. &quot; This ironic ecological reclamation might not be such a bad idea for a song and video if ( a ) another David , Byrne , hadn ' t already written a much funnier version of the same scenario with Talking Heads ' &quot; Nothing but Flowers , &quot; and ( b ) the stock nature footage mixed in with the special_effects didn ' t make this video look much cheaper than it undoubtedly was . 51 Sarah McLachlan , &quot; Possession. &quot; McLachlan seems to be this season ' s Pre-Raphaelite sex goddess of choice , a slightly ethereal-looking poetess who promises to throw you down on the floor after winning you over with some light verse . She ' s got a gorgeous voice , but this video is unbecomingly obvious in its come-on , with McLachlan gazing all too seductively into the camera , open-mouthed , less like the artiste she ' s being positioned as than like a posturing , perfume-selling supermodel . Worse yet is the silly filming technique : studio performance footage all scratched_up and artificially faded in post-production . If premature aging of film stock is meant to subliminally signify classic , it doesn ' t work . Ironic , that so many filmmakers would be working to preserve the great old movies from wear_and_tear while artsy music video directors are busy inflicting faux scratches on brand new work . 47 Ice_Cube , &quot; You Know How We Do It. &quot; At last , a video that shows gangsta rappers do have traditional values . Here , Cube and his buds make their money the old-fashioned way -- by motoring to Vegas and , of course , hitting it big in Glitter Gulch , filmed lovingly from in and around the rapper ' s shiny , neon-reflecting convertible . American to the core , Cube is , after all . ( If only the rapper had thought to sample Albert Brooks in &quot; Lost in America &quot; singing his would-be jingle , The Desert Inn has heart , the Desert Inn has heart , this might be a small masterpiece of pathetic consumerism. ) 45 Mariah Carey , &quot; Without You. &quot; It ' s hard to listen to Harry Nilsson ' s 1972 hit version of this wrenching ballad and not think_of the suicide of the songwriter , Badfinger ' s Pete Ham . What might otherwise have read as a typical love-song cliche -- &quot; I can ' t live , if living is without you &quot; -- seemed scarily literal , given the real-life context . Carey , God bless her , turns it back into a cliche . Her reading of this suicide note is all friendly high notes and showy melisma , without even the faint comprehending whiff of desperation . The video , a live concert rendering , even has a big backing gospel-type chorus sympathetically joining in on the key lines -- when the song so clearly demands that its singer be imagined alone and forlorn beyond consolation . Remember the days when the great crooners used to listen to songs before interpreting them ? 27 Aerosmith , &quot; Crazy. &quot; When it comes_to providing the nation ' s youth with beyond-bad role_modeling , Aerosmith and director Marty Callner are crazy like a fox . This is their third successive video in which the leading role has been handed_over to the same rascally teen-girl heroine , with random footage of the band in concert cut_in for good measure . The group and Callner assume -- probably astutely -- that when marketing a group of nearly-50-year-olds chiefly to not-quite-20-year-olds , ' tis better to have any romantic scenarios doled_out to actual thespians closer to the target demographic , and have the band act_as mere Greek_chorus . The theme this time : sluttishness rules . The lass from the last two clips crawls out of her parochial_school window , ditches her white and plaid duds , and joins an equally Lolita-esque pal in a convertible . Thelma &amp; Louise Jr . stop at a gas_station and wiggle so efficiently that the attendants let them shoplift half the store , then go participate in an erotic dancing contest at a bar they ' re presumably several years too young to get_into , then go skinny-dipping with a farm_worker . It ' s the most shameless imaginable video jailbait . 8</TEXT>
