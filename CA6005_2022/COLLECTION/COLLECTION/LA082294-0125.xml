   <HEADLINE> ISRAELIS RUSH TO DUMP SHARES TO BEAT NEW TAX ; STOCKS : A SELLING STAMPEDE ANTICIPATES CAPITAL-GAINS LEVY . LATER , THE PLAN IS MODIFIED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israel ' s stock_market plunged nearly 10 % in trading Sunday , when investors seeking to beat a tax on share profits stampeded to sell . Ninety minutes into what many predicted would be the Tel Aviv Stock_Exchange ' s ( TASE ) &quot; Black Sunday , &quot; the government backtracked . It modified the pending capital-gains tax so profits can be offset against losses . &quot; I hope that within several days we will stabilize at a reasonable level that reflects the operations and quality of the listed companies , &quot; Finance_Minister Avraham Shohat said . Sellers flooded the market , which had been closed since Shohat announced the 10 % tax on Wednesday . TASE officials said record sell orders of $ 660 million were lodged before trading started . The benchmark Mishtanim index fell 18.22 points , or 9.93 % , to 165.18. &quot; I cannot recall a day like this in years , &quot; said Yerah Nissan of United Mizrahi Bank on the tumultuous trading floor of the TASE . For the first time in its 40-year history , TASE lifted a 10 % limit on the fluctuation of share prices within a single day . Losses on individual share prices ranged between 10 % and 20 % . Israel is stock market-mad , even by the standards of industrialized Western countries . Even before Sunday , a bull_market that had risen since the mid-1980s had fallen about 25 % this year . Tens of thousands of small investors dabble_in stocks . The market trades fewer than 100 major shares yet supports hundreds of small portfolio managers , institutional investors and bank operations . Outside the TASE building , disgruntled investors and flag-waving opposition politicians called_for Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin ' s resignation . He had pledged there would be no capital-gains tax on the market this year . But Shohat said he had no regrets about his announcement last week that he would kill the cash_cow by taxing share profits 10 % . &quot; I could have sat quietly in my office without making any fuss and perpetuated a situation where there was a 50 % tax on labor in Israel , but share trading was tax free , &quot; he told Army Radio . In a Tel Aviv bank branch , investors gathered to watch their holdings plummeting on a monitor . &quot; If it goes_on like this for another 15 minutes , Rabin should resign , &quot; said Zvi , an old_man who has played the market for 30 years . Under the revised tax proposal , investors can choose two options when buying stock . They could pay a flat 10 % tax on any profits or take losses as tax_deductions , subjecting any profits they made on the market to a 20 % to 25 % tax .</TEXT>
