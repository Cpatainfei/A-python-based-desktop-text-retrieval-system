   <HEADLINE> FILMMAKER STILL TRYING TO SHED HITLER ' S STIGMA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For at least 50 of her 91 years , through court cases and memoirs and , now , a three-hour documentary , Nazi Germany ' s genius filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl has been struggling to clear her name of its Third_Reich tinge . The director of what many consider to be the world ' s greatest propaganda film , &quot; Triumph of the Will , &quot; portrays herself as an unwitting or unwilling adjunct to evil ' s inner_circle : She never wanted to make her brilliant film on the 1934 National_Socialists Party meeting in Nuremberg , but Hitler would n ' t take no for an answer . Riefenstahl says she was either out of town or out of touch during Nazi book burnings , the &quot; Crystal Night &quot; destruction of synagogues and businesses and the daily persecution of Jews , Gypsies and political opponents . Like most Germans of her time , she says she did not learn of the extermination of 6 million Jews until after World_War_II . American , French and German tribunals exonerated her of Nazi activity . This is why at the end of Ray Mueller ' s documentary &quot; The Wonderful Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl , &quot; which opens today at the Nuart Theatre , Riefenstahl looks earnestly into the camera and asks , &quot; What am I guilty of ? &quot; She really doesn ' t know . During an interview at her home_in southern Germany , Riefenstahl insists that her mistake in life has been to tell the truth . &quot; I would have had it very easy if only I had lied , &quot; she says . She was a prisoner of the_French after the war . &quot; They said if you write here that you knew about Auschwitz , then you are free , you can make films , everything . They wanted that I lie . They didn ' t believe that I didn ' t know this . How can I be guilty if I didn ' t know this ? &quot; That Riefenstahl ignored infinite evil and served the interests of Nazism in pursuit of_her_own film career was clear to just about everyone but herself . After the war she became persona_non_grata and was unable to complete any serious film work again . Riefenstahl ' s life is itself something of a triumph of will . She dropped_out of sight to photograph the Nuba people in Africa in the 1960s and she went underwater at age 72 . The nonagenarian has just returned from nine weeks of scuba diving , five in Tanzania , four in the Seychelles . She has stopped work_on an underwater video to stay_at her house above Starnberger Lake for a_few days , arranging details of a Japanese exhibition of her still photographs . She bounds down the stairs into a sitting room wearing black leggings , an indigo satin blouse and patent_leather shoes . She has the thighs of a 20-year-old , the manicured hands of a woman half her age and tremendous energy . Only a slight curve in her spine hints at the sum of her years . &quot; Many ask me how it is possible that I am able at my age to make this film , &quot; Riefenstahl said . &quot; I think there are several reasons . You know every person who loves their work can do more_than normal people . And from the beginning , I always had to fight -- and the fight , if you are the winner , makes you strong. &quot; She considers herself a winner , dogged as she is by questions she has answered so many times that her words now spill_out as question and answer together . &quot; In the beginning they said that I was the lover of Hitler , or Leni has taken a Gypsy child ( from a concentration_camp ) or Leni was in Poland and has seen how Jews were shot . Nothing , not a little bit was true , &quot; she says . This much , however , she readily admits in her autobiography , &quot; Leni Riefenstahl : A Memoir. &quot; In the 1930s , the beautiful young actress from &quot; The Sacred Mountain &quot; and director of &quot; The Blue Light &quot; had intimate conversations with Hitler , who would call her to the Chancellery and other residences when he needed someone to talk to . She had a power struggle with Hitler ' s Propaganda Minister , Josef Goebbels , who hated her , she says , because she spurned him as a lover . * Riefenstahl wills that the world see things her way : She was never a member of the Nazi_Party . She says she is simply honest for admitting what others deny -- that she was taken_in by Hitler . &quot; If you look_at what Germans said after the war , all were against Hitler . I am the only one who had the courage ( to admit my sympathy ) . . . . There were some people who were against Hitler from the beginning , Thomas Mann , several people . But that was the minority , &quot; she says . Hitler asked her to make a Nazi_Party film after seeing &quot; The Blue Light. &quot; She made &quot; The Victory of Faith &quot; in 1933 and , the following year , the better-financed and more successful &quot; Triumph , &quot; a romantic film about Hitler . The film begins with Hitler ' s plane descending from the clouds , and with the text : &quot; Sixteen years after the beginning of German misery , 19 months after the beginning of Germany ' s renaissance . . . . &quot; The Fuehrer is seen with happy children , with throbbing crowds and goose-stepping troops . Riefenstahl ' s innovative camera work from below makes Hitler appear a giant , benevolent being . Critics have called it a passionate film , technically astounding and a masterpiece of propaganda . It is still shown in film schools around the world . But Riefenstahl is adamant that it was a documentary . She says she knew about making &quot; good pictures , not politics. &quot; &quot; Ach , I didn ' t even know what propaganda was . I couldn ' t even make a television ad . . . . The money did not come from the party , because the party was against me . Goebbels was not my friend . . . . Hitler wanted it . Hitler knew that I was gifted . That was my tragedy , &quot; she says . At home , Riefenstahl has catalogued her life in color-coded binders neatly filed_in white cabinets next to her editing room . The filing is organized by country -- gray for Germany , red for America , orange for England -- and by film . From a yellow file on &quot; Olympia , &quot; her masterpiece on the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin , she has pulled two reviews from 1938 editions of the Los Angeles Times and the Hollywood Citizen . The writers assert that her film was &quot; a triumph for the camera &quot; and &quot; a magnificent film &quot; -- but not propaganda . &quot; Olympia , &quot; for which Riefenstahl received an Olympic gold medal , also has been called the greatest sports film ever made . To get her shots of the strongest and fastest men on Earth , she placed her cameras in pits , on pulleys and poles , setting the standard for sports photography . Talking to Riefenstahl , one senses that she laments her decisions early in life not because she served a devil , but because they made the rest of her life so difficult . She has regrets . &quot; We knew that Hitler was an anti-Semite , but nobody had the idea that he would do such inhuman things , &quot; Riefenstahl says . &quot; I wish that I had never made ' Triumph. ' I think I would have had the chance after the war to work in Hollywood . . . . Even my enemies say that I am very talented. &quot; Regrets , but no guilt . * &quot; The Wonderful , Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl &quot; plays today through April 26 at the Nuart , 11272 Santa Monica Blvd. , West Los Angeles , ( 310 ) 478-6379 . * THE REVIEW : ' The Wonderful Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl ' is an engrossing , potent and well-researched documentary .
