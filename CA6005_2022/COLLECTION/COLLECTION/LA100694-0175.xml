   <TEXT> BODY_COUNT When a majority of Coast Area administrators voted to disband the Pioneer League last year , the league ' s high_schools cried bloody murder . Now they ' re getting killed on the football_field . In their reincarnation as members of eight-team Bay and Ocean leagues , the old Pioneer League schools have come_back as cannon_fodder . All six of the former Pioneer League schools lost league openers last week and were outscored , 190-40 . El Segundo took the worst beating , 49-2 , against Mira Costa , but the Torrance schools didn ' t fare much better . Only Torrance managed to score in double figures in a 28-14 loss to Leuzinger . Naturally , not everyone is happy . &quot; Do the former Pioneer League schools really have any football future in the Bay and Ocean leagues , or will they just become body_bag opponents to fill_out the schedules for the original Bay and Ocean League schools ? &quot; asked an official from a former Pioneer League school who requested anonymity . &quot; How long can the former Pioneer League schools take these poundings before the football programs and athletic morale deteriorate ? &quot; The situation looks especially bleak for West , North and Torrance , which are competing for playoff spots against established football powers Hawthorne , Leuzinger and Peninsula in the Bay League . West and North tied for the Pioneer League title last season , but Friday they were overwhelmed by Peninsula , 35-7 , and Hawthorne , 34-6 , respectively . South should be competitive in the Ocean League , although the Spartans were badly outplayed in a 24-3 loss to talented Culver City . As for El Segundo and Centennial , it ' s apparent they have little chance of ever making the playoffs in the Ocean League ' s current setup . Last year , Pioneer League administrators had hoped to keep three leagues . But their counterparts from the five-team Bay and Ocean leagues , wanting to reduce scheduling hassles , voted unanimously to go_with two expanded leagues . Since the leagues are in place for a four-year cycle , one-sided football_scores could become commonplace . And that ' s not good for anyone . NOT FORGOTTEN Although Mira Costa ' s football_team is 4-0 , it ' s only natural to wonder how much better the Mustangs would be if Phil Fonua and Dino Rossi were playing . They were the only All-Southern Section players back from the 1993 Division VII championship team , but both had their senior seasons wiped_out before the first game . Fonua , a preseason All-American nose tackle , suffered a ruptured cerebral_aneurysm . Rossi , a wide receiver-defensive back who was one of Mira Costa ' s fastest players , had surgery to repair a torn knee ligament . Coach Don Morrow has dealt with the disappointment of losing two of his best players , but occasionally he still asks himself , &quot; What if ? &quot; &quot; It ' s not so_much that I wonder what our record would have been or how we would have stacked_up against other teams with those guys , &quot; Morrow said . &quot; I just wanted to see what they would have done_in their senior years. &quot; Morrow , though , pointed_out that Fonua and Rossi are still contributing in an inspirational sense . They joined Mira Costa ' s captains on the field before Friday ' s game against El Segundo . &quot; Our senior group is very close and they always want both of those guys around , &quot; Morrow said . &quot; The kids who are playing have a good feel_for what has happened . They know what has been taken from these guys . Our attitude has been good , but we still miss them . We ' ve never denied that. &quot; SEEK AND DESTROY With Mira Costa ' s Fonua sidelined , the area ' s most disruptive defensive player clearly has to be Banning lineman John Toavalu . The 5-foot-11 , 280-pound senior was a one-man wrecking crew last week in the Pilots ' 17-0 victory over San Pedro , getting three sacks and forcing a fumble . As a team , Banning had six sacks and forced five turnovers . Pilot assistant Titus Tuiasosopo says there ' s a simple reason why Toavalu is so effective . &quot; No one can block him , &quot; he said . ON THE RUN The South Bay ' s most dominant offensive player has been Mira Costa tailback Mike Fikes , who leads the area with 690 yards rushing and nine touchdowns . The 6-foot-2 , 195-pound senior has rushed for more_than 200 yards in each of the past two games and has rushed for more_than 100 yards in all six of his starts at tailback for Mira Costa since becoming eligible late last season . So , Fikes has to be the best running_back Morrow has coached , right ? &quot; He could end_up being ( the best ) , but I ' ve had some good tailbacks in the last few years , &quot; said Morrow , who took_over the Mira Costa program last year after coaching South Torrance for four seasons . &quot; He doesn ' t have blazing speed , but he can get_to the corner and has real good moves . And he ' s a load ( to bring_down ) . &quot; GAME OF THE WEEK Can the ever-changing Leuzinger defense stop the option ? Can the fast-improving Peninsula offense continue to rack_up yardage ? These and other questions will be answered Friday when Leuzinger ( 3-0-1 , 1-0 in_league play ) visits Peninsula ( 3-1 , 1-0 ) for a 3 p.m. game that will go_a_long_way toward deciding the Bay League title . Leuzinger Coach Fred Boehm promised more defensive changes after the Olympians struggled to defend the option last week against Torrance . He realizes they ' ll have to perform better against Peninsula , which , led by quarterback Peter Krogh , ran the option to perfection against West Torrance . NOTABLE * The Mira Costa girls ' volleyball team , which beat St . Mary ' s of Stockton en route to a second-place finish in a Chicago tournament last weekend , moved_up to second in the CIF coaches state poll . The Mustangs , ranked seventh in the previous poll , lost in the final to Lincoln East of Nebraska . Mira Costa ' s Lori Garber was named all-tournament . Newport Harbor remained in the state ' s No . 1 position , with St . Mary ' s dropping from second to third . * It was a case of good news / bad news for the Cal State Dominguez Hills women ' s soccer team Sunday . The Toros shut_out Metropolitan State of Colorado , 4-0 , but they lost leading scorer Gwen Nakashima ( Torrance High ) for the season because of a knee injury . Dominguez Hills rallied Monday with a 3-1 victory over Cal Lutheran , improving to 6-3 . * Simone Ferrera of South Torrance was the fastest girl at the Kenny Staub cross-country meet last weekend at La Crescenta County Park , covering the three-mile course in 19:20 . * Amanda Basica of Lomita is part of a five-player , under-21 United States women ' s tennis team that will compete against Great Britain in the 22nd annual Maureen Connolly Challenge Trophy starting today at Colorado Springs , Colo . The U.S. team is coached by former U.S. Open winner Tracy Austin . * Centinela Hospital Medical_Center in Inglewood has signed a four-year extension to its agreement to serve as the official hospital and medical research_center of the PGA Tour and Senior PGA Tour .
