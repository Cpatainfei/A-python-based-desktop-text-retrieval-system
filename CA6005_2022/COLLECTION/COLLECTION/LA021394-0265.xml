   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; A NATION WITH PERIL ON ITS MIND ; CRIME HAS BECOME THE TOP CONCERN OF MANY PEOPLE . MUCH OF THE ANXIETY IS FUELED BY A PERCEPTION OF VIOLENCE , NOT THE STATISTICS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After a long , harrowing season of death , Americans are preoccupied more_than ever by violent crime , an obsession as old as the highwayman and as newly minted as a carjacking . Common wisdom holds that the sudden trajectory of anxiety burst , fully formed , from last year ' s rush of high-profile killings -- the Long_Island commuter-train massacre , mass_murders at family restaurants and fatal abductions of suburban children . But high levels of personal fear -- the quickening panic that leads people to bolt doors and glance backward on city streets -- have been inescapable facts of life for three decades . That pervasive alarm has been fueled by the long-term growth of juvenile violence , the emergence of new offenses such_as holdups at automated teller machines , and the decade-long spread of drug and gang deaths . What has changed dramatically is the percentage of Americans who now put crime issues at the top of the country ' s most important problems . The upsurge -- from 21 % last June to 43 % last month in a new Los Angeles Times Poll -- marks a watershed in public concern about crime , said Tom W . Smith , a polling expert with the University of Chicago ' s National Opinion Research_Center . Fear flows with its own infernal logic . The upsurge is not driven by a sudden rising_tide of crime ; the rate of violent episodes , although much higher than three decades ago , is down slightly from peaks in the 1980s . The difference is in the perception of crime ' s pattern . Many Americans appear threatened by examples of mayhem they read and hear about in their own communities , heightening the belief that the world beyond is becoming less safe and that crime requires urgent national attention . Sensing that these new signals come largely from middle-class America , politicians who had for years rarely addressed the horrendous crime levels of poor city neighborhoods now feel compelled to offer solutions . The Times Poll found that while 41 % of those who said they felt safe in their neighborhoods cite crime as a most pressing national issue , the percentage jumps to 51 % among those who said they felt unsafe . The poll , which surveyed 1 # 516 respondents across the country from Jan . 15 to Jan . 19 , had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 points . &quot; What concerns me is what ' s close to home , &quot; said Jerry Westwood , a regional parks supervisor who said he hears gunfire almost every night near his home_in Aurora , Ill. , a city of 100 # 000 people west of Chicago . The numbers are both real and contradictory . Violent crime actually dropped_by 3 % nationally in the first six months of 1993 , according to the FBI , after similar reductions over the last two years . Violence waned slightly in the suburbs , and overall Americans say they don ' t feel any less safe in their homes or neighborhoods than they did_in 1981 . But murder rates ratcheted upward in small_towns , medium-sized cities and urban_centers with populations between 500 # 000 and 1 million . Homicide records were demolished in 22 cities , from Baltimore to Phoenix , Brockton , Mass. , to Jackson , Miss. , even in the two capitals President Clinton calls home : Little_Rock , Ark. , and Washington , D.C. From Trudy Sundberg , who rallied 800 residents of Oak Harbor , Wash. , after a school fistfight , to the President , who was restrained by aides from rushing to a Washington city pool where six children were shot last year , Americans seize upon nearby instances as certain evidence that crime threatens to overwhelm us all . In the midst of a get-acquainted chat with Illinois Gov . Jim Edgar last September , Bob Haisman , the new president of the Illinois Education Assn. , broke_down , weeping , as he recounted the slaying a week earlier of a popular athlete in Hinsdale , a Chicago suburb . &quot; No one feels safe anymore . Parents are just petrified , &quot; Haisman said . &quot; My God ! What a society ! &quot; Hinsdale South High_School , where Haisman has taught social studies for 25 years , is a placid campus where 85 % of the students go_on to college . When 17-year-old Barrett Modisette was slain , allegedly by another student as he walked home from a football game , the school ' s sense of safety was instantly dispelled . Haisman ' s impassioned , awkward display set the governor to thinking . &quot; They might have shootings on the South_Side of Chicago -- it doesn ' t get the attention , &quot; Edgar said later in an interview . &quot; In Hinsdale , they ' re shocked. &quot; Last month , Edgar , a longtime proponent of traditional tough-on-crime strategies , endorsed a ban on assault weapons . This was an unexpected tack for a Republican leader who has depended_on support from the National Rifle Assn . Edgar ' s new approach could also be ascribed to more overt political reasons -- for one , he is up for reelection this fall -- but the grim stories that he and other leaders have heard from citizens in recent months convinced many that a defining moment is at_hand . There is no shortage of explanations for the public ' s mood swing : Times Poll Director John Brennan and other public-opinion experts see the crime issue simply slipping into prominence and into the vacuum left by an improving economy ; some political_leaders say the public ' s mood shifted as suburban America realized city terrors can also afflict them ; a_few criminologists cite &quot; fear fatigue , &quot; the refusal to live_in fear any longer . As late as mid-1991 , only a miniscule number of Americans cited crime as a major national concern . And though that number rose to 17 % by January , 1993 , it was still eclipsed by the economy and unemployment . When 17 police executives sat_down for a two-day crime conference that month , they concluded that violence was sweeping their cities and that policy-makers had to respond . Their 30-page report , issued last April , brimmed with sobering figures : Violent crime in the United States increased 371 % since 1960 , a rate nine times faster than the increase in the nation ' s population . Homicides tripled ; rapes burgeoned by 500 % . The document tumbled into a void . The police officials sent a copy to the White_House , but all they got_in reply was a three-sentence acknowledgment . &quot; We didn ' t exactly take the nation by storm , &quot; said Daniel Rosenblatt , director of the International Assn . of Chiefs of Police , which sponsored the conference . Even though Clinton had been &quot; champing at the bit to speak &quot; on the subject during his campaign against George_Bush , pollster and adviser Stanley B . Greenberg said aides damped down his fervor , worried that too_much crime talk might hand a natural advantage to Republicans , who had exploited the law-and-order issue since Richard Nixon ' s victory in 1968 . After he was elected , Clinton often stressed his support for a national police corps and the omnibus crime bill . But crime remained a secondary issue , submerged by health_care reform and the federal budget_deficit . Then , last June 22 , a gunman raked a southeast Washington municipal swimming_pool with gunfire , wounding six children . The next day , an agitated Clinton told his staff he wanted to go_to the pool to console the youths ' families and make a forceful point about the pervasive damage violence does to American communities . But a crucial budget vote was scheduled the next week . Staffers &quot; convinced him it was more important at the time to keep his focus_on the economic package , &quot; said domestic policy aide Bruce Reed . The Administration ' s reluctance to speak out forcefully on crime in early 1993 , despite Clinton ' s own inclinations , shows how cautious many opinion-makers were in acknowledging its importance . The crime_rate has not changed appreciably since then -- despite their newfound eagerness to attend_to it . According to Ted Gurr , a University of Maryland researcher , Americans ' fears have been most pronounced after turbulent periods of street crime and urban unrest . The 1850s , the 1920s and the 1960s were all decades , Gurr said , when the marked rise of real crime and its perception were closely tied . That is why the public ' s current obsession is unusual . Although overall violent-crime rates rose in the late 1980s , the trends have tailed off during the last few years . &quot; Looking_at the numbers , the general population doesn ' t appear to be more at risk than a_few years ago , &quot; said Michael R . Rand , an analyst taking_part in the Justice_Department ' s annual survey of crime victims . The closest available indicator of random violence , Rand said , is stranger-on-stranger violence , which shows little increase from 1992 to 1993 -- from 3.4 million reported incidents to 3.5 million . Even mass_murders , one of the most inexplicable of crimes , have occurred at a predictable pace in recent years . Northeastern University crime expert James Alan Fox , who has researched recorded mass_murders back to the mid-1960s , says slayings of four or more people in one location are rare , occurring in the United States about twice a month . &quot; We have nothing to go_on that would make us worry that it ' s getting_worse , &quot; Fox said . But all through the fall , television and print reports linked each new crime in the national spotlight with the public ' s growing preoccupation with violence . The week after Colin Ferguson is alleged to have killed six people on a Long_Island commuter_train , Time magazine responded with a cover showing a 9-millimeter semiautomatic Ruger superimposed over Ferguson ' s brooding face . Beside it was the word &quot; Enough ! &quot; The impression that Americans were fed up came from &quot; talk_over the barbecue , &quot; said Time Managing Editor James R . Gaines . &quot; It is a gut thing , a sense that , though maybe it ' s from a middle-class commuter ' s perspective , this craziness has even invaded the sacred precinct of a 5:33 p.m. commuter train. &quot; Despite ample evidence of crime ' s omnipresence for more_than a decade , the press has , for the most part , covered crime &quot; schizophrenically &quot; because it is entwined with &quot; such a web of class and race , &quot; said Jon Katz , media critic for Rolling Stone magazine . The fusing of last year ' s high-profile killings with the growing legislative debate on guns and crime made the overall issue of violence appear as &quot; a sudden crisis , &quot; Katz said . The most intense reactions to press coverage of crime comes from small_towns and suburban Americans . The poll found 72 % of small_town residents and 69 % of suburbanites say their feelings about crime are stirred most by what they see , hear and read in the media . Overall , 65 % cite news coverage as the main influence on their attitudes ; by contrast , 21 % say they are most affected by their own and acquaintances ' experiences . The poll also found that 32 % of respondents said their fear of crime was heightened by specific incidents reported by the press . Of those , 19 % cited instances that received widespread publicity , among them the kidnaping and slaying of 12-year-old Polly Klaas from her Petaluma , Calif. , home , the shooting spree on the Long_Island train and the murders of tourists in Florida . Another 17 % , however , named approximately 150 other crimes that made news in their own communities but drew little notice elsewhere . The list is a national police_blotter : shootings at junior_highs in Wyoming and Jefferson_City , Mo. ; carjackings in New Mexico and Colorado ; a yogurt shop slaying in Austin , Tex . Gunfire , abduction , rape and murders are described in a succession of mundane locales , from malls to automated teller machines to a Connecticut police_station . &quot; People can identify with these victims , &quot; Smith said . &quot; They could have been where these victims were. &quot; For years , Sundberg read stories in Seattle newspapers and national magazines about brutality in the poorest sectors of America ' s cities . Abstract concern percolated in the back of her mind , she said , but she felt comfortably distanced in Oak Harbor , a Navy town of 20 # 000 people on Whidbey Island , 70 miles from Seattle . That began changing last year . As a gang subculture emerged among town youths , police confiscated two handguns and seven toy guns from juveniles . There had been no such incidents in 1992 . In November , a brawl at Oak Harbor High_School left a victim so bloodied that he was airlifted to a Seattle trauma center . Normally , these incidents would be the stuff of anxious gossip for a spell , then shrugged_off as aberrations . Not now . &quot; When you pick_up the paper and you see all_the crime , when the first five programs on the TV news are crime , that ' s the background , &quot; Sundberg said . &quot; When it happens close to home , then you think : ' Oh no . It ' s beginning. ' &quot; Days after the high_school fight , she met in her dining_room with the town ' s police_chief and the county sheriff . She wanted to launch a crusade . The officials pledged their help . Oak Harbor ' s violent crime_rate had decreased by 2.4 % the previous year , and the school incidents had only the faint aroma of urban-style violence . But Sundberg struck a nerve . About 800 residents showed_up last month for the first &quot; Save Our Kids &quot; rally , applauding as a prosecutor , a judge , the high_school pep band and the honor society pledged to keep Oak Harbor safe . In Atlanta , where two carjackings within three days last month left two residents dead , the horror seemed fresh -- even though DeKalb County police had recorded 119 such incidents , two fatal , in 1993 . Police responded with their biggest show of force since the notorious serial murders of children 13 years ago . Squad_cars and helicopters swarmed over the southern part of the county until six men were arrested and charged in the two deaths . No matter that the Justice_Department says the number of carjackings is not rising . The deaths left toughened city people even more jittery . In their wake , sales manager Ronald Witherspoon , 42 , now makes_full use of his license to carry a gun . Hurrying through a downtown parking garage , he explained his strategy . &quot; I ' ll give them my car , &quot; he said , &quot; but then when they drive_away , I ' ll shoot their tires out. &quot; Debbie Stevens ticked_off the ominous events of the last two years around her six-street tract in Florissant , Mo. , near the St . Louis airport : A driver almost coaxed a little boy into his car . Neighborhood kids blithely showed her 13-year-old daughter a gun . Two girls in nearby suburbs were abducted and killed -- local crimes that stirred national interest in the wake of the Polly Klaas case . &quot; I think_about it constantly , &quot; Stevens said . &quot; I keep thinking : ' God , is it just me ? Or is it the average American family ? ' &quot; She suspects she knows the answer . In this climate , the Times Poll found that 41 % of respondents have taken steps to protect themselves from crime . For most , their choice has been the same as Witherspoon ' s -- to carry a concealed weapon , whether it be a gun , knife or Chemical Mace . One of four Americans now arms himself outside the home , nearly double the 13 % of a 1981 Times survey . And almost 20 % of those who moved last year said they did so at least in part to get_away from crime . Only last summer did politicians began picking_up these hints of the nation ' s edgy mood . Gov . Pete Wilson ' s reelection campaign manager , George Gorton , tells of trying in vain to herd 20 San Fernando Valley voters in a focus group back to the topic at_hand : the state budget . But they kept turning the discussion to crime , Gorton said . Even though California hasn ' t shaken its recession , even though the state ' s crime_rate is not rising , &quot; the level of intensity , the frequency of questions have pretty steadily escalated in the past year , &quot; Wilson said recently . There were other indicators . Among them : The Chatsworth , Calif. , founders of Mad About Rising Crime , an activist group , saw a spurt in membership . So did both the National Rifle Assn . and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence . Indiana Gov . Evan Bayh says he saw a new demographic group , with votes and influence , lending voices to the chorus against crime . &quot; For a long_time , citizens in the inner_city have dealt with this problem , &quot; he said . &quot; Now ( concern ) is prevalent ( throughout ) the middle of Middle America. &quot; It didn ' t really matter why the public was so upset ; it was clear the voters wanted something done . By the fall of 1993 , politicians across the spectrum served_up all manner of proposals . Twenty-six governors spotlighted crime in their January State of the State addresses . In California , Minnesota , North Carolina and Oklahoma , governors sponsored crime &quot; summits &quot; -- bringing citizens and officials together to discuss solutions . New York Gov . Mario M . Cuomo and North Carolina Gov . James B . Hunt Jr . called special legislative sessions to consider anti-crime laws , and Wilson called a special crime session running concurrently with the regular legislative session . Officials in 17 states began considering boot camps for nonviolent offenders to clear prison space for the most brutal felons . Lawmakers in more_than 23 states are considering gun-control measures . Officials in 16 states are mulling &quot; three strikes and you ' re out &quot; laws that mandate life in prison on a third felony conviction . Kansas House Speaker Bob Miller stated the obvious theme for the next legislative session in a newsletter sent to his colleagues . &quot; It ' s Crime , Stupid , &quot; the headline read . The crime bill that sat stalled in Congress for five years passed the Senate last November . It is under debate in the House , swollen with amendments that Sen . Joseph R . Biden Jr . ( D-Del. ) , chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , puts_in three categories : helpful , neutral and &quot; just wacky. &quot; One would federalize every gang crime . &quot; We ' d end_up adding 6 # 000 cases to the federal docket , &quot; Biden said . Another would require the death_penalty for killing a federal poultry inspector . By November , the President was speaking out , hammering at crime and its ravages on inner-city families during a speech at a Memphis , Tenn. , church . Greenberg said he had noticed a change in the public ' s mood , a linking of crime with the disintegration of the family . Crime is now one of Clinton ' s three top agenda_items for this year , and has become the show-stopper of his recent speeches , including the State of the Union Address . All of this -- the flood of federal bills , the posturing , the speeches -- is old news to veteran Washington hands like Donald Santarelli , who served in the Richard Nixon Administration as head of the Law_Enforcement Assistance Administration at the height of the &quot; law-and-order &quot; era . &quot; It ' s like a steam_engine , &quot; he said . &quot; A head of steam builds_up until someone opens the valve , then the superheated steam vents out . Any astute pol recognizes that. &quot; The question is what to do with the steam . &quot; You reach a critical mass when people say : ' I ' ve had it , &quot; ' said Sen . Phil Gramm ( R-Tex. ) , a supporter of tough anti-crime measures . &quot; We have an opportunity to do something real. &quot; Scholars of the nation ' s attitudes on crime are skeptical . Much of the work is &quot; pure symbolism , &quot; said Roger Conner , executive_director of the American Alliance for Rights and Responsibilities , a public-interest law_firm . Politicians , he said , are &quot; responding to their white , middle-class constituents &quot; by &quot; providing palliative measures that they hope will defuse their anger by_election time. &quot; The new frenzy of anti-crime activity leaves many minority-group leaders , particularly African Americans , feeling a mixture of bemused appreciation and bitterness . They perceive the quailing of suburbanites , mostly whites , finally seizing the nation ' s attention after city dwellers , mostly blacks , went unheard for so_long . While 64 % of white respondents said they still feel safe walking in their own communities at night , the Times Poll found that only 36 % of blacks and 41 % of Latinos would say the same . In Gary , Ind. , the latest city to earn the despised sobriquet of U.S. &quot; murder capital , &quot; both coats and guns are checked by a glowering bouncer at the roadhouse where George Henley plays tenor sax with his jazz_group , the Groovepacers . At the Nation of Islam mosque where he prays , four guards stand outside where two once sufficed . &quot; Use your head , &quot; Henley advises , &quot; and you ' ll be all right. &quot; But the new surge in concern about crime , urban leaders say , does not reflect concern about the George Henleys who confront violence each day . &quot; I don ' t get the sense that there is a great_deal of altruism , &quot; said Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke . Most Americans , Schmoke said , are &quot; saying they don ' t want to see this spreading beyond the borders of the inner city. &quot; Although Christal Burnett of Hazelwood , Mo. , said she does not consider herself a racist , when she pictures a criminal &quot; in my mind I think ' young black punk. ' I hate that that ' s in my mind because I know there are a lot of bad white people. &quot; The Rev . Otis Moss , an influential African American preacher at Cleveland ' s Olivet Baptist_Church , said the heightened interest in crime is &quot; 30 years late. &quot; Nevertheless , he is glad that attention is finally being paid . &quot; It can no longer be looked_upon as ' those people. ' It can no longer be placed in the ' over there ' category , &quot; he said . According to The Times Poll , most black Americans share his sentiments . Blacks are divided about whether tougher crime laws will increase prejudice , with 43 % of Times Poll respondents agreeing they would and 44 % disputing that contention . ( Whites reject that idea , 71 % to 18 % ; so do Latinos , 60 % to 26 % . ) But even a wide majority of those who say they think that increased bias will result are in favor of the three-strikes approach . And despite the growing focus_on punishment , most of the respondents don ' t see it as the only answer . In the poll , support for the Senate version of the crime bill drops from 64 % to 37 % if it drains money from social programs . Support for three-strikes laws also drops , from 79 % to 58 % , if such money is diverted or if taxes are increased . And 52 % said they still feel that more money should go_into education and job training . Such signs of convergence of liberal and conservative , white and black views on crime leave Moss &quot; not without hope. &quot; He compares the atmosphere to that of Montgomery , Ala. , in December , 1955 , when black housekeeper Rosa Parks refused to give_up her seat on a bus to a white_man . &quot; It is the moment , &quot; Moss said , &quot; when people ' s cup of endurance runs over. &quot; Times librarian Mary Edwards in Los Angeles and researchers Doug Conner in Seattle , Lianne Hart in Houston , Ann Rovin in Denver , Tracy Shryer in Chicago , Edith Stanley in Atlanta and Anna Virtue in Miami contributed to this story . THE TIMES POLL : As Concern Over Economy Drops , Crime Becomes a Top Issue While most poll respondents say they fell safe in their communities , the issue of crime has soared as a national concern . Most say what they read in publications and view on TV has more influence on their feelings than personal experience . CRIME CONCERNS HAVE SURGED . . .
