   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY NEWSWATCH : A SPECIAL REPORT : MULTIMEDIA INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> BEYOND VIDEO : The multimedia industry -- which produces computer_programs for products like games that combine video , sound , graphics and text -- gathers steam in Orange County . A decade ago , there were just a_few one-person firms ; now there are more_than a dozen companies with hundreds of employees . . . . Enter Jon Sidoli , a UC Irvine fine_arts graduate , who started Digital Artists Agency in Irvine to supply multimedia companies with performers . &quot; We ' re the talent_scouts , &quot; Sidoli says . &quot; We provide the actors and actresses that appear in the new digital world. &quot; SUBCONTRACT : People used to smirk when William C . Fisher told them a decade ago that he created computer_games for a living . &quot; Now it ' s so vogue that people get googly-eyed and say it ' s cool , &quot; says Fisher , 35 . His Quicksilver Software Inc. in Costa Mesa , which has 12 employees , helped Interplay Productions Inc. produce its award-winning Castles II : Siege &amp; Conquest multimedia game about life and war in medieval times . &quot; It ' s like a Hollywood job , &quot; Fisher says . &quot; It ' s not always glamorous . . . . It ' s half technical and half artistic. &quot; CULTURAL : Shelia Monique and her husband , Ron May , above , started May CoII Entertainment , a multimedia company in Santa Ana , to produce multicultural children ' s education programs for media , including TV_shows and computer_programs . The firm ' s initial project is &quot; Yesterday , &quot; a set of animated short_stories that will run as a TV_show . Monique is the voice of a 6-year-old character &quot; Little Ms . Monique. &quot; DAY JOB : Michael Salazar , a 28-year-old actor with a fine_arts degree from UC Irvine , never thought he ' d be using his stage voice in computer multimedia productions . But it certainly pays the bills while he ' s looking_for theatrical work . Salazar ' s voice may be heard in an upcoming Shakespeare edition of Irvine-based World Library Inc. ' s electronic books , which run_on personal_computers . Such &quot; books &quot; feature the text of the work_on a computer disk but also supply audio and video clips . Says Salazar : &quot; I ' ve had more calls_in the last year than ever before. &quot;</TEXT>
