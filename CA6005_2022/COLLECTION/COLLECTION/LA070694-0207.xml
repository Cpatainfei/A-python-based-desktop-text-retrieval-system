   <TEXT> If looks were everything , Apple ' s new eWorld on-line service would be a sure winner . But it will take more_than just a pretty interface to compete with established services such_as Prodigy , Compuserve , and America Online . On-line services , like people , need more_than just good looks_to be interesting and compelling . And eWorld -- currently available for the Macintosh , with a Windows version expected next year -- still has a way to go_in making itself a sophisticated and knowledgeable conversationalist . EWorld is the first in a wave of new on-line services to be launched over the next year by some of the biggest names in the computer_industry . Microsoft is expected to make its entry by early next year and may include the access software with its next-generation personal_computer operating system , code-named Chicago . Computer magazine_publisher Ziff-Davis will launch its Interchange service this fall , with content initially focused_on computers . Delphi , now owned by publisher Rupert Murdoch , is in the process of reinventing itself with an easier-to-use graphic interface and a host of new services aimed at non-technical consumers . All this activity is unsurprising in light of how quickly the on-line services market is growing . CompuServe , America Online and Prodigy together serve about 5 million users , with Genie and Delphi lagging significantly behind . About 25 million people worldwide are connected to the Internet , a global network of networks linking many different computer_systems and services . The newer players such_as eWorld can bring some fresh approaches to their services by working with newer equipment , more sophisticated software and novel interface designs . But that ' s not enough . An on-line service ' s interface , like a newspaper ' s design , is just a starting point . The coin de realm is content . And when it comes_to content , eWorld has a lot of room for improvement . that ' s not a surprise , for building content takes time and requires myriad relationships with information providers . EWorld ' s initial start-up screen features a town square metaphor to help you navigate the system . Instead of the usual pull-down menus , buttons or icons , you click on buildings , such_as the &quot; Newsstand &quot; and &quot; Learning Center. &quot; Whimsical sounds , such_as traffic noise on the town ' s main_street , provide a diversion and some comic relief . The town_hall metaphor is cute and the service ' s look and feel is pleasing , but they really don ' t add that much to the service ' s usability . From the standpoint of ease of use , eWorld is_on a par with America Online and Prodigy . Even CompuServe , which was once considered one of the most complex on-line services , has streamlined its interface so that it is also now fairly easy to use . EWorld ' s &quot; Arts and Leisure Pavilion &quot; takes you to the entertainment features , recipes , Fodors travel , TV reviews and other leisurely pursuits . The &quot; Learning Center &quot; is the gateway to Grolier ' s Encyclopedia but ( so far ) nothing else . Other options appear on the menu , but when you try to use them you ' re advised that they ' ll be &quot; added shortly. &quot; The &quot; Computer Center &quot; takes you to Apple ' s customer service center , where you can download software from ZiffNet / Mac and where vendors provide technical support for Mac and Newton users . The &quot; Newsstand &quot; provides access to Reuters and USA Today and commentary from a handful of syndicated columnists . Many of the sections have a chat area where you can participate in a live interactive conversation with other members . * EWorld , like all_the major on-line services , also offers electronic_mail , including the ability to exchange messages via the Internet with users of other services . EWorld costs $ 8.95 a month , which includes two hours of non-prime-time use ; additional hours cost $ 4.95 , plus a surcharge of $ 2.95 for access during prime_time . Macintosh users can order a free start-up kit by calling ( 800 ) 775-4556 . EWorld will have to work diligently on getting content in place if it hopes to be a player in the long term , for the established on-line services are hardly standing still . America Online this year added several new databases , including the full text of Time magazine . It has also become the first major commercial on-line service to offer access to Internet news groups ( forums ) as well as menus ( called gophers ) that provide access to other Internet resources . America Online eventually plans to offer full Internet access . CompuServe , legendary for its depth and its hundreds of highly sophisticated reference sources , has recently issued a newer and more straightforward version of its Windows software . The company last month began distributing an optional CD-ROM that adds sound , video clips and multimedia elements to the service . * Prodigy , where I write a regular computer column , is expanding its editorial offerings and adding some innovative features to its interface . The company has established a relationship with news organizations , including the Atlanta Constitution and Times Mirror Co . ( the publisher of the Los Angeles Times ) to provide local news and community information . Prodigy is the first service to routinely provide photographs with its news_stories and , late last month , began integrating sound clips into some of its editorial offerings . It takes about four minutes , at 14 # 400 bits per second , to download a two-minute sound clip . But Prodigy does_it in background so you can use other parts of the service -- or other Windows programs -- while the sound file is being transferred over the phone_line . Prodigy ' s use of sound and CompuServe ' s CD-ROM provide a glimpse of what is to come . Fiber optics , cable and other technologies will make_it possible for services to offer rich libraries of audio and video material -- including perhaps full-length movies and documentaries . It will also become practical for people to send voice mail and even video mail as we cruise along the gradually widening digital highway .</TEXT>
