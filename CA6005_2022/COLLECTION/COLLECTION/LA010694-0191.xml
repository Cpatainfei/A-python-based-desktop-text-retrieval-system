   <HEADLINE> CHARITY PATIENTS IRRADIATED TO GAUGE EFFECT ON SOLDIERS ; RADIATION : EXPERIMENTS ON 82 PEOPLE WITH CANCER LASTED UNTIL 1972 . SIXTY DAYS AFTER EXPOSURE , 25 HAD DIED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Over a dozen years , ending in 1972 , at least 82 charity patients at the University of Cincinnati Medical_Center were exposed to powerful full- and partial-body radiation in a study designed to gauge exposure levels for soldiers , according to documents being reviewed by the Energy_Department . The experimental subjects -- of whom 61 were low-income black_men and women -- were cancer patients whose illnesses were deemed untreatable , although all still were considered to be in &quot; relatively good health. &quot; Many even continued to work every day . But within 60 days after exposure to radiation 10 times higher than that believed safe at the time , 25 of the patients died . The experiments were conducted by Eugene L . Saenger , an eminent radiological health specialist , and they prompted the University of Cincinnati ' s Junior Faculty Assn . to conclude in 1972 that &quot; many patients paid severely for their participation and often without even knowing that they were part of an experiment. &quot; Saenger himself , in a report to the Defense_Department , acknowledged that &quot; one can identify eight cases in which there is a possibility of the therapy contributing to mortality. &quot; Saenger -- and others who conducted experiments now under review -- continues to testify as an expert witness in suits against the U.S. Energy_Department by nuclear production workers and communities seeking compensation for radiation exposure . The Cincinnati case poses a significant dilemma for the department , which has vowed to &quot; come clean &quot; on such experiments . Much of the technical expertise it has used to fend_off lawsuits is derived from experiments whose methods are now being called into question . The Cincinnati experiments , which were the subject of a Senate hearing in 1972 , also show that human radiation tests were conducted well beyond the 1940s and 1950s , when knowledge about nuclear radiation remained crude . In addition , the Saenger experiments provide dramatic evidence that an interagency task_force formed Monday by the Clinton_Administration to review the human experimentation will have to breach a wall of secrecy at the Pentagon , as well as at organizations like the Energy_Department and its predecessor , the Atomic Energy Commission , which already have been implicated . The Defense_Department spent $ 651 # 000 to support the Cincinnati experiments . Energy_Department officials and a burgeoning army of federal investigators are reviewing the Cincinnati experiments as they comb through thousands of pages of documents on Cold_War experimentation in which humans , often without being told , were exposed to radiation . Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary has said she was &quot; appalled , shocked and deeply saddened &quot; to learn of an earlier experiment , in which 18 individuals were injected with plutonium , and has vowed to lead a review of such Cold_War practices sponsored by the federal_government . It is not known whether any of those who were subjects in the Cincinnati experiments are still living . In 1971 , when details of the experiments first emerged , six of the patients were believed to be alive . Saenger , now professor emeritus of radiology at the University of Cincinnati Medical_Center , did not return numerous telephone_calls from The Times . The government ' s investigation of the Cincinnati experiments is expected to focus_on key issues of medical ethics raised by long-secret radiation experiments involving humans : whether patients were told of their status as experimental subjects and whether they explicitly agreed to participate . A report by the Junior Faculty Assn . noted that for the first five years of Saenger ' s study -- when almost 48 patients were exposed to full-body radiation -- &quot; patients seem to have been told nothing except that the radiation was part of their treatment. &quot; The informed consent of patients was further complicated by the fact that the affected patients had a median IQ of 87 . An IQ of 100 is considered average . A 1972 review of the experiments by the American College of Radiology , which cleared Saenger of any wrongdoing and urged continued government support for his studies , acknowledged that subjects were not asked to sign consent forms until 1965 -- five years into the experiment . The radiology college said that only &quot; in the last few years ( patients ) were told that the information might have military as well as clinical significance. &quot; Commenting on the cross-section of subjects used in the experiment , the college review noted that &quot; in both race and IQ , the group was representative of the patients served at Cincinnati General Hospital &quot; -- the public hospital from which subjects for the experiments were drawn . But the government ' s review is certain to concentrate as well on the propriety of exposing subjects -- even those considered to be terminally ill -- to radiation in a form and at a rate that apparently never had been tried_on humans in experimental settings . Although whole-body radiation was once seen as a potential treatment for leukemia , a textbook on the treatment of the disease that was in wide use at the time of Saenger ' s experiments warned that doses of no more_than 25 rads should be given &quot; to avoid too-great bone-marrow injury or other reactions. &quot; Saenger wrote in a 1970 report of his work that subjects would be exposed to 250 rads in one session at intensive dose_rates of between three and six rads per minute . &quot; During that period , it was pretty well understood by health physicists that doses at that level would give a high risk of being fatal to a patient , &quot; Dr. Karl Z . Morgan , president emeritus of the International Radiation Protection Assn . and former president of the Health Physics Society , told The Times . &quot; At 250 rads , a number of persons would not survive that exposure and it certainly would hurry the death of someone with leukemia or a similar malignancy. &quot; The dose led the Junior Faculty Assn . to suggest that bone_marrow failure caused by excessive radiation exposure -- and not the normal course of their diseases -- may have led prematurely to the deaths of many of Saenger ' s experimental subjects . Saenger ' s work , however , was considered important to the U.S. military , and Saenger frequently cast it as crucial to the study of nuclear defenses . In 1963 , Saenger reported to the Pentagon that &quot; combat effectiveness would be relatively maintained at an exposure up_to 200 rads &quot; -- a dose in some cases lower than he was administering to ill patients . But he warned that &quot; a second exposure would result in significant troop ineffectiveness. &quot; Attorneys active in pursuing radiation compensation cases said experts such_as Saenger frequently serve as key government witnesses in cases brought against the Energy_Department . Saenger is listed as a prospective government witness in six lawsuits being brought_on behalf of 216 contract employees who worked_on the construction of nuclear test sites during the 1950s and ' 60s . Attorneys said the government ' s treatment of the cases will be the first test of the Energy_Department ' s commitment to the new standards it has espoused . &quot; I find it a little hard to believe that Dr. Saenger could be that concerned about radiation effects when he could conduct experiments like these on humans , &quot; said Larry Johns , a Las Vegas attorney handling some of the pending suits . &quot; It raises a question as_to his objectivity . You have to wonder . . . how reliable , how credible are the experts the government brings_in to testify in cases of this type ? &quot; Johns said . Johns said that two other scientists whose work is now under review by the Energy_Department are also on a list of prospective witnesses the government has furnished him . &quot; For the Energy_Department to be able to use any testimony generated by what might be considered illicit experiments is insidious in its nature , &quot; said Stanley Chesley , a Cincinnati attorney active in pursuing nuclear radiation cases . &quot; To use any of these experts to defend any of these cases is very disconcerting. &quot; Chesley declined to comment on the Saenger experiments .</TEXT>
