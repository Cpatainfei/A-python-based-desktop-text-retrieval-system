   <TEXT> * In response to &quot; What We Need Is Real Tort Reform -- Not Snake_Oil , &quot; Commentary , Dec . 28 : In 1992 my daughter was seriously injured in a car accident , and we are now close to settling the claim with the insurance_company . She will need several more specialized surgeries , and will probably be left with residual problems . Because there is a great_deal of insurance money , and because of the nature of her injuries , we are expecting a significant settlement . However , the amazing thing about our case is that the legal_fee ( a 25 % contingency fee ) to settle the insurance will far surpass the total medical costs to date . These medical costs have included major orthopedic surgery on her hip , femur and ankle , two weeks hospitalization , four months of physical_therapy , plastic_surgery , head injury evaluation , over 100 X-rays , CAT scan , numerous laboratory tests and medications , and follow-up care . How can President Clinton even discuss health_care and pharmaceutical cutbacks and cost controls when legal_fees are clearly out of control , and lawyers continue to have the legal clout to demand such huge amounts_of_money out of our nation ' s insurance and medical dollars ? NANCY ALLEN Northridge * An estimated 80 # 000 Americans die in hospitals from medical negligence each year , and hundreds of thousands more are injured . The suggestion that limiting compensation to malpractice victims would help solve the nation ' s health_care crisis is a cruel hoax . The proof is right here in California . In 1975 , the state Legislature capped compensation for pain and suffering , limited attorneys ' fees and enacted a variety of other restrictions on the legal_rights of malpractice victims at the behest of the insurance and medical lobbies . Yet , since 1975 , the cost of health_care in California has been higher and has grown faster than in the nation as_a_whole . The restrictions have had little effect on the overall cost of health_care because all_the compensation paid to victims of medical malpractice in California amounts to about one-half of 1 % of the state ' s total health expenditures each year ( the national figure is 1 / 10th of a point higher ) . Even a complete ban on malpractice suits would have no appreciable impact on the health_care crisis . Proponents contend that &quot; tort reform &quot; will lower the cost of so-called defensive medicine . It hasn ' t in California : The rate of Cesarean_sections -- which physicians claim are often performed out of fear of a malpractice suit -- is about the same here as it is nationwide . Limiting compensation to medical malpractice victims benefits only greedy insurance_companies and dangerous doctors . Insurers were dramatically overcharging for malpractice coverage in the mid-1980s , until Proposition 103 ' s rate controls began forcing premiums down . Still , in 1990 , malpractice insurance_companies paid_out only 36 cents in claims for every premium dollar they took_in . Malpractice insurers ' operating profits in California were a staggering 40 % of premiums that year . HARVEY ROSENFIELD Proposition 103 Enforcement Project Los Angeles</TEXT>
