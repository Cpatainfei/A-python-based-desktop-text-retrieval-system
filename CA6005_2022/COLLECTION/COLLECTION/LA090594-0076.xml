   <HEADLINE> AT 25 , INTERNET READIES MOVE INTO FREE MARKET ; TECHNOLOGY : QUASI-PUBLIC COMPUTER_NETWORK TO BE PRIVATIZED . SOME ARE LEERY , OTHERS SEE OPPORTUNITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For 25 years , from its founding by the Defense_Department as a tool for the scientific elite to its recent astounding growth like some ferocious strain of fiber-optic ivy , the amorphous computer_network known as the Internet has been anchored financially and technologically by the federal_government . Not anymore . As the ' Net celebrates its silver anniversary this month , the National Science Foundation -- which has been spending upward of $ 10 million a year administering the central &quot; backbone &quot; of the Internet -- is preparing to relinquish the world ' s closest thing to an information highway to the vagaries of the free market . Many longtime users believe the move is crucial to the growth of the network . People can still find and exchange an enormous amount of data and chat cheaply over thousands of miles , but the Internet is becoming strained by the influx of the curious and the commercial into what was once the preserve of researchers . But others fear that pieces of the Internet could split apart as profit replaces sharing as the motive linking it all together . As the network of networks becomes central to commerce and begins to touch the lives of ordinary citizens , the stakes in its responsible operation have grown exponentially . &quot; It ' s going_to be like the Copernican revolution , when people suddenly realized the universe did not have a center , &quot; said Bill Washburn , who heads a consortium of smaller networks that is one of many entities hoping to profit from the new Internet order . &quot; The Internet is anarchy , it ' s a form of chaos , and with the disappearance of the NSF network , that chaotic quality will become more immediate and more evident to a lot of people who have been able to ignore it. &quot; Whatever the outcome , the quasi-public network has arrived_at a watershed as it begins the first stages of official privatization . &quot; This is an immense change affecting millions of people and tens of thousands of individual networks , &quot; says National Science Foundation networking chief Stephen Wolff , who has spearheaded the move . &quot; But the marketplace is there now , and there ' s no point in having the federal_government competing with the private sector. &quot; Indeed , the foundation ' s withdrawal is in one sense symbolic , since the network has been de_facto open_to businesses for years . More_than half of the Internet ' s rapid_growth this year is accounted_for by commercial traffic , much of which technically conflicts with the agency ' s rule that it be used for research only . This &quot; acceptable use &quot; policy , as it is known , had become something of a conundrum for the foundation -- essentially unenforceable , it nonetheless impeded the network ' s growth by making some firms leery of joining it . Already , the investment in the network ' s infrastructure by dozens of private companies like Cerfnet and Netcom -- go-betweens that link customers to the Internet for a fee -- far outweighs the government ' s contribution . And as the market for providing business and consumer Internet access expanded , there was pressure on the government to make_way for private enterprise . For example , the members of Washburn ' s group , the Commercial Internet Exchange , have a standard agreement to exchange traffic with one another without using the science foundation backbone . Still , much of what drives the demand for access are the resources and the promise of connection with others around the globe made_possible by the foundation ' s core network . There are 3 million computers and 38 # 000 networks on the Internet . The nerve_center knows the name_and_address of every one of them , and how to route a packet of data between any two . And now it is dissolving away . The government ' s plan , set_in_motion over a year ago , is just beginning to take_effect . By the end of this year , if all goes well , each of the 400 billion bytes of data that flow daily over the foundation ' s high-speed fiber pathway ( each byte is equal_to roughly one letter_of_the_alphabet ) will have found another , privately owned route to its destination . Now telephone_companies and firms that run regional data networks linking customers to the Internet are rushing to capture the business created by the government ' s abdication . It promises to be a competitive free-for-all . But if all 20 million Internet users -- a population that is increasing at a rate of nearly 20 % a month -- are to continue to be able to exchange electronic_mail , then all those private carriers , including direct competitors like Sprint , AT &amp; T and MCI , must forge exchange agreements . And while the National Science Foundation is helping to fund several neutral switching points -- informally referred to as &quot; demilitarized zones &quot; where data are handed off between networks -- no one is compelled to connect to them . &quot; They ' re private businesses -- it ' s up_to them to decide what they want to do . Nothing is guaranteed , &quot; says Jon Postel , a USC professor who participated in the birth of the network in 1969 as a graduate_student and is working with the National Science Foundation to oversee the transition . &quot; Everybody knows they have to do_it , but no one wants to commit yet. &quot; William Schrader , president of Performance Systems International , a large Internet service provider in Reston , Va. , for example , says he may choose not to connect to the government-sponsored switches because of concerns over the security and privacy of his customers ' data . Instead , he might forge his own private links with other carriers . &quot; I ' m glad the government is finally getting_out of our business , &quot; Schrader says . &quot; And I would like there to be no bifurcation of the Internet -- but there is that risk. &quot; Such talk strikes fear in the heart of someone like Bill Emery , a professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Colorado , who relies daily on his Internet connection to send and receive data from weather_satellites . &quot; I can ' t live without my connections , and I ' m afraid during some of the uncertainties when other people are doing the wiring I won ' t be able to get_it , &quot; Emery says . &quot; I don ' t think the Internet is going_to go_away , but we ' re going to live through some pain , and it ' s not going_to be this sort of fundamental right that it ' s been in the past . Things are going_to cost more. &quot; Indeed , for the academic world , long addicted to e-mail and the ability to search faraway databases without leaving campus , the change will probably mean an end to what_for most has been unlimited free on-line access . And that , says Wolff , is part of the point : &quot; The whole idea is to reduce the network to the status of the telephone . The Internet is one of the costs of doing business , and universities will provide_for it the same way they provide_for desks and chairs and roses in front of the president ' s house. &quot; The costs are hard to predict . University connection costs , subsidized by the government , range between $ 20 # 000 and $ 50 # 000 a year , and the National Science Foundation estimates that costs will rise only a_few thousand dollars at a school like UCLA in a heavily populated area . But at Colorado , there have been estimates that the service could cost an additional $ 100 # 000 . Users who have piggybacked on the government ' s backbone service may also see connection costs rise . Rural areas and small businesses that must purchase their own connections would probably be hit the hardest . But perhaps the biggest concern among Internet users is that the telephone_companies and other firms that take_over the networks will find a way to start charging for data by the packet , in much the same way they charge for normal phone_calls by the minute . More_than anything , that would discourage exploration and end cheap access to communication . &quot; All I can say is that we ' re looking_at a multitude of options for the long term , &quot; says Robert Collet , networking director at Sprint , which counts among its data network customers several large corporations and the Philippines . &quot; Right now we ' re in the world of flat monthly rates. &quot; Wolff allows_for the possibility that somewhere down the line , regulation may be necessary . But he says the price pinch , if there is one , will not hit academics immediately . For the next three years , the National Science Foundation will continue to partially subsidize several of the regional networks that connect universities and research institutions . Ultimately , the research community is counting_on a plan to resurrect the past with a smaller , more exclusive network boasting superior high-speed technology . It will initially be reserved for the research elite represented by the nation ' s National Science Foundation-funded supercomputing centers . If , in the end , the whole point of the Internet is how it connects people rather than computers and fiber , then the biggest changes may come as its new underpinnings reshape the network ' s traditionally homogenous sociology . &quot; We ' re evolving past being one organism , &quot; said Jim Pepin , executive_director of computing services at USC . &quot; The Internet has become weighted down by its own weight . Now there ' s a whole set of new social dynamics. &quot;</TEXT>
