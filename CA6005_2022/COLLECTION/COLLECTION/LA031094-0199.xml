   <HEADLINE> WARY GERMAN TROOPS TAKE_LEAVE OF SOMALIA ; AFRICA : NATION ' S FIRST FORAY ABROAD IN HALF A CENTURY SUCCEEDED . BUT VICE_ADMIRAL EXPECTS SKEPTICAL RECEPTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> From the pier of the gritty port here , Vice Adm . Hans-Rudolf Bohmer watched with pride just after dawn Wednesday as 200 of Germany ' s first combat soldiers to be deployed abroad since World_War_II marched aboard the German navy ship Niemburg , bound for home . But , as he stood_in combat helmet and flak vest in this still-lawless land , the commander of the German Naval Fleet was circumspect at the end of a mission , controversial and historic . If , indeed , this was a victory for the German military after half a century of international isolation , it was , he conceded , a bittersweet one . True , in the unprecedented U.N. operation to pacify and rebuild this ruined , well-armed nation , an effort that has claimed the lives of 67 peacekeepers from nine nations in 15 months -- dozens of them brutally slaughtered by a single Somali clan -- the worst the Germans suffered in their eight months here was rat bites . And Bohmer concluded in a ship-side interview that the success of Germany ' s limited mission in Somalia is likely to positively influence the debate in Bonn over lifting constitutional provisions that restricted the powerful German military to a noncombat role in Somalia . &quot; But I don ' t think that they will be welcomed like heroes , &quot; the admiral concluded , as all but a handful of the last German soldiers to leave Somalia prepared to sail into the sunrise . The German public &quot; realizes that this was participation in a military operation with a good aim but that not very much was achieved . The skepticism is there about the future of Somalia. &quot; At the U.N. compound here that the Germans , Americans and others are leaving_behind this month , that skepticism was mixed heavily with concern on Wednesday . As Germany pulled_out its soldiers -- in keeping with moves by other Western nations , which took their cue from President Clinton ' s decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Somalia before the month ' s end -- senior U.N. military sources confirmed that a dozen of the 28 nations that were expected to remain in a less-ambitious U.N. peacekeeping operation here now plan to withdraw too . Even as U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali is urgently appealing for more peacekeepers in the Balkans and elsewhere , U.N. officers in Somalia indicated that four nations -- Pakistan , India , Egypt and Zimbabwe -- will supply about half of the force here . It also could drop far below the 22 # 000 troop level that the United Nations had hoped for after most of the Western forces are gone_by April 1 . &quot; It ' s not a very comfortable feeling , &quot; said Brig . Gen . Saulat Abbas , commander of the 5 # 500-member Pakistani contingent -- the largest single force that will remain after the Americans and Europeans depart . &quot; Every soldier who leaves , it is not very good for us . I ' m just hopeful that things will not deteriorate that badly. &quot; But already the West ' s exit from Somalia has been met with a sharp increase in banditry , armed attacks and firefights on Mogadishu ' s streets . Meantime , the U.N. Security_Council has reduced not only the size of the Somali operation but its mandate as well . Remaining troops have shifted from peacemaking to peacekeeping , and , ever since , armed Somali gangs have been roaming freely in increasing number , sometimes taunting U.N. soldiers who are under new orders to use force only in self-defense . Amid the deepening chaos , none of the departing forces are taking chances . The Italians , who are scheduled to pull the last of their 1 # 500 troops out of their embassy stronghold in north Mogadishu today , mobilized eight armored personnel_carriers armed with heavy_weapons as escorts . They plan to move_out to Mogadishu ' s airport in_force just after sunrise . But none of the departing forces have been as cautious as the Germans . They designed their Wednesday departure to be swifter and safer than even the United States ' high-security naval withdrawal from this land . None of the 200 departing German army troops were_on the pier for more_than a_few minutes ; they left at an hour before most Somalis are awake . The two German ships , which ferried soldiers to flights home from the Kenyan port city of Mombassa , remained in Mogadishu harbor for less than 20 minutes each . And , as during American departures , small tanks , armored cars and sharpshooters flanked the German vessels during boarding . Reflecting the deep sensitivities back home toward the least casualty here , Bohmer said halfway through the German withdrawal that &quot; w are grateful that nothing happened. &quot; But as the last soldiers boarded , the commander of the German contingent -- which numbered 1 # 300 at its peak -- exulted . &quot; It ' s a good feeling because it ' s only a short time now to report that the mission is completed , &quot; said army Col . Holger Kammerhoff , who after an eight-month tour here will soon be back at his usual post as commander of Germany ' s 23rd Mountain Brigade . &quot; But it was_well done . It was a good job . We did_it without casualties , and this is important for the debate back home. &quot; The only casualty during the Germans ' tour_of_duty in the northern town of Belet Huen -- a largely peaceful spot , deliberately selected for deployment of the only U.N. contingent that was constitutionally barred from combat operations -- was a young Somali . He was shot by German sentries on Jan . 21 after he and another Somali cut_through fences around the German camp . The two had refused to heed warning shots . Military lawyers said the shooting was justified . Still , the incident fueled brief yet intense criticism back home of Germany ' s expanding role in U.N. military operations abroad . In their time in Belet Huen , the Germans built 11 schools . They dug seven deep wells . They put_up a clinic , trained doctors and nurses and treated 8 # 000 patients through a mobile ambulance service . They constructed three dams -- one 500 yards long -- that changed the direction of a river so it will irrigate 12 # 000 desert acres . But since the Germans left Belet Huen , 40 Somalis have died from cholera in a nationwide outbreak of the disease . The elders in Belet Huen had rejected the Germans ' offer to rebuild their sewer_system . With the rainy_season just days away -- a time when the town is routinely submerged -- most of the Germans fear that the cholera outbreak will soon become an epidemic in Belet Huen . Meantime , lawlessness has spread there since the Germans left . Grenades thrown into the compound of a Los Angeles-based relief organization , the International Medical Corps , forced the evacuation of all foreign_aid workers last week . Several U.N. officials said they fear that the town may be_on the brink of renewed clan warfare . &quot; Before we came , there was fighting . After we left , there is fighting , &quot; said German Lt . Col . Harald Rettelbach , the contingent ' s chief press officer . &quot; The things we built , I hope they will remain . But it is like big waves threatening a house on shore . We can break the waves at_sea , but we cannot stop the high_water that will come ashore. &quot; With such reality in mind , the admiral paused and reflected when asked whether an exercise that , for Germany , was as political as it was military was more of a success for his country than for any of the others that have participated in the U.N. operation . &quot; We will not say that for Germany this has been a success and for the others it was not , &quot; Bohmer replied . &quot; We are an integral part of the whole action . In the end , I think everyone is sad that it is still such an unstable place. &quot;</TEXT>
