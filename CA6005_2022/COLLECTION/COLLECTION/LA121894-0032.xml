   <HEADLINE> THE AGE OF AMERICAN INVENTIVENESS ; HOW OUR FIRST OPERATIONAL JET FIGHTER WAS BORN ; SKUNK WORKS : A PERSONAL MEMOIR OF MY YEARS AT LOCKHEED , BY BEN R . RICH AND LEO JANOS ( LITTLE , BROWN : $ 24.95 ; 350 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To hear Ben Rich tell it , in his thoroughly engrossing memoir , Libya ' s Moammar Kaddafi is alive today only because Reagan ' s Secretary_of_Defense , Caspar Weinberger , decided , at the last minute , not to use Lockheed ' s Stealth F-117A aircraft on the April , 1986 , bombing raid against Tripoli . The Navy fighter-bombers that did make the attack were picked_up by Libyan radar , and had to evade missiles and flak , so that their bombs , aimed at Kaddafi ' s quarters , missed their target . The F-117A , writes Rich , &quot; would have attacked with surprise and placed that smart bomb right on the guy ' s pillow. &quot; Weinberger is quoted in the book explaining this bit of curiously benign realpolitik , in which the American government decides to assassinate the head of another government , but chooses not to use its best weapon . He &quot; didn ' t want to risk having a plane go_down and having its technology explored. &quot; That is , he didn ' t want the Soviet_Union to figure_out a defense . Fat chance . Rich was running the fabled Skunk Works_at Lockheed , and his engineers had done their job perfectly : They had produced an aircraft that would show_up on radar screens , in the words of the man who created the plane ' s design , &quot; as big as an eagle ' s eyeball . &quot; An air_defense missile can ' t hit what its radar control can ' t see . The proof of the F-117A ' s abilities had to wait five years after the Tripoli raid , when the planes were sent to attack Baghdad as part of Operation_Desert_Storm . On the first night alone , undetected by ground radar , they knocked_out the Iraqi communication and missile centers , air_defense center , and the country ' s operational commands . Iraq ' s fate was sealed . This is not only the story of the creation of one aircraft , as fascinating as that tale is . Rich , with the aid of veteran co-author Leo Janos , tells the history of the Skunk Works , created by Lockheed at the end of World_War_II to come_up with America ' s first operational jet fighter . ( It got its name because it was first housed in a tent on the Lockheed operation in Burbank , near a plastics factory which , in those pre-AQMD days , emitted a noxious odor that had the effect of discouraging curious visitors. ) The man who headed the operation was Clarence &quot; Kelly &quot; Johnson , famous in aviation circles for the design for the Electra and Super Constellation commercial airliners , as well as the P-38 Lightning during WWII . Johnson was crusty , profane , demanding and instinctively brilliant about aviation design . His team gave the country the F-80 , and , over the years , the U-2 spy plane , as well as the SR-71 , which was taken_out of service in 1990 , after 24 years overflying the former Soviet_Union , China , Vietnam , North_Korea and other hostile countries where over a_hundred SAM missiles were fired at it -- and not one plane was lost . Rich was not as distinctive ( or polarizing ) a personality as Johnson , nor was he as intuitively brilliant about aeronautics ( although as a young engineer he did win a patent for a wire that would heat the urine elimination tubes on Navy patrol planes , thereby solving a particularly painful sticking problem ) . Johnson led by sheer force of personality , and coined a slogan for the Skunk Works : &quot; Be quick , be_quiet , be_on time. &quot; Rich was a more adept manager , a function of a low-key personality . Unlike some in aerospace , who took government contracts as an invitation to pad expenses , especially in the 1980s , when the U.S. spent around $ 2 trillion to build weapons , Rich followed Johnson ' s precept to keep the operation lean . Having &quot; achieved phenomenal efficiency &quot; building the Stealth fighters , &quot; I offered to give the government some of the money back &quot; but -- no surprise -- &quot; The Air_Force told me that it had no bookkeeping methods for taking_back money , so I gave them $ 30 million worth of free engineering improvements on the airplane. &quot; Rich retired from Lockheed just as his Stealth planes became the technological and military stars of the Gulf War . He predicts that &quot; the Skunk Works will endure and remain unrivaled for advancing future technology , &quot; defining that future most dramatically in terms of a world abundant with bloody wars , and dictators no less loathsome than those in the Soviet_Union merely because they have fewer resources with which to produce their evil mischief . As almost all_of the aerospace news in Southern California over the past few years has been about layoffs and downsizing , Rich ' s book is a welcome antidote , a reminder of the days when that industry and this region were suffused with optimism . He also has a prescription for at least some of what ails us : &quot; We encouraged our people to work imaginatively , to improvise and try unconventional approaches to problem solving , and then got_out of their way . By applying the most common-sense methods to develop new technologies , we saved tremendous amounts_of_time and money , while operating in an atmosphere of trust and cooperation both with our government customers and between our white-collar and blue-collar employees . In the end , Lockheed ' s Skunk Works demonstrated the awesome capabilities of American inventiveness when free to operate under near ideal working conditions. &quot;</TEXT>
