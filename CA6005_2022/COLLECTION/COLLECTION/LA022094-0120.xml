   <HEADLINE> THE STATE ; THE ' 94 GOVERNOR ' S RACE : THE WILD CARD AND THE SHADOW CANDIDATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Edmund G . ( Jerry ) Brown Jr . did_in the 1992 Democratic presidential primary , state Sen . Tom Hayden is trying to hold Democrats hostage to a political reform agenda . And , as Brown did_in ' 92 , Hayden promises to bow_out if the major Democratic candidates embrace his reforms . No wonder Hayden has been labeled the Jerry Brown of the ' 94 gubernatorial campaign . Two years ago , Brown carefully cultivated a populist , anti-Washington image . Hayden has carefully cultivated a populist , anti-Sacramento image . Both men are consummate &quot; insider-outsiders , &quot; using media savvy gained through years of political maneuvering to rail against a system that has never fully embraced them or their ideas . The ' 92 Democratic National Convention was abuzz with speculation over how Brown ' s guerrilla antics would affect the party ' s nominee , Bill_Clinton . Would they push Clinton to the left in_order to hold his party base ? Or might they allow him to spotlight his move toward a moderate &quot; third way &quot; ? Today ' s conventional wisdom holds that Hayden ' s candidacy will likely hurt Kathleen Brown more_than state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi . At this point , front-runner Brown doesn ' t need California ' s political media to shake_off its boredom and begin paying serious attention to the campaign . But a Hayden candidacy could do that . Reporters like covering Hayden ; they relish a livelier race . that ' s good news for Garamendi , still lagging in fund-raising and name recognition . But better coverage can also help Kathleen Brown . The camera does love her . In the late 1992 primaries , Jerry Brown ' s &quot; scorched earth &quot; tactics forced Clinton to more clearly define his persona . Similarly , Hayden ' s candidacy could help Kathleen Brown define herself -- at a time when she is increasingly accused of &quot; fuzziness. &quot; Of course , if being specific translates into sounding too liberal , Kathleen Brown could be in big trouble come the general_election . But , again , 1992 is instructive . By pressing his reform agenda , Jerry Brown helped Clinton look more moderate . If Hayden remains in the race , Kathleen Brown will have to work harder and risk more in June , because she needs to win as Clinton did -- without veering left or right . But if she survives the primary , that could make her a stronger candidate for November . On the other hand , Kathleen Brown could panic and list to port . Indeed , Hayden , who plays the populist card more convincingly than Garamendi , could force both Brown and Garamendi to the left . The better to capture likely Democratic primary voters , perhaps -- but not a comfortable position for the party ' s nominee in a California general_election . Being Jerry Brown ' s sister might have helped in the primary , if Kathleen could have quietly inherited the remnants of the &quot; Brownies &quot; -- party activists whose enthusiasm helped keep Jerry Brown alive and pumping politically . He appealed_to environmentalists , disaffected Democrats and younger , liberal activists -- a nice primary base to have . Hayden ' s candidacy has precluded any stealth-liberal strategy . To hold supporters of Hayden ' s strong stands on environmental issues and political reform , Kathleen Brown may be tempted to use her brother far more visibly than she would like . And that could prove to be heavy baggage in the fall . The general electorate is more moderate than primary voters , and thus likely to be less tolerant of Jerry Brown . And with crime still a hot_issue , Gov . Pete Wilson gleefully continues to tar Kathleen Brown with her brother ' s liberal state Supreme Court appointments and opposition to the death_penalty . Then there is the_matter of pre-primary debates . Hayden could certainly spice them up , because he ' s scrappy and can give good sound-bite . No front-runner -- particularly one whose momentum appears to have stalled -- wants to face that kind of buzz-saw . But can Kathleen Brown afford to duck out ? Not in this era of &quot; teledemocracy. &quot; Not when her opponents are panting to prove the lady is not tough enough for the rigors of campaigning , let alone governing . So Kathleen Brown will probably have to participate in a_few debates , and she could easily find herself overshadowed as Garamendi and Hayden policy-wonk it out . But that ' s not necessarily harmful . Clinton , the ultimate policy wonk , often loses his audience when he abandons the rhetoric of the bully pulpit for technical jargon . Voters want leaders , not middle-level managers . In 1992 , Jerry Brown finally chose not to be an obstructionist . Hayden says he won ' t be one , either . Indeed , if his candidacy ensures a spirited Democratic primary , it could boost Democratic chances in the nonpartisan race for superintendent of public instruction , the only statewide constitutional office that can be won outright in the primary . Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin ( D-Fremont ) , the front-runner , is supported by the Legislature ' s Democratic leadership , teachers and women ' s groups . Her strongest opponent is likely to be Maureen DiMarco , an apostate Democrat who has served the last three years as Wilson ' s secretary of child development and education . A hotly contested gubernatorial primary on the Democratic side , coupled with what looks_to be a lackluster Republican race , could conceivably produce a lopsided turnout that would give Eastin a June victory . At the very least , Hayden , the wild card , and Brown , the shadow candidate , might bring_to this election year the kind of unpredictability that makes California politics fun to watch . Countering a reporter ' s characterization of his campaign as &quot; whimsical , &quot; Hayden retorted , &quot; We need more whimsy in politics. &quot; On with the show ! *</TEXT>
