   <HEADLINE> FAMALARO HAIR , BLOOD , SALIVA SAMPLES SOUGHT ; INVESTIGATION : ARIZONA PROSECUTORS SAY SUCH EVIDENCE WOULD HELP CASE IF AN AUTOPSY FINDS THAT DENISE HUBER WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Yavapai County prosecutors Wednesday demanded blood , saliva and hair samples from murder_suspect John J . Famalaro -- evidence that could prove critical if a pending autopsy determines that Denise Huber was sexually assaulted . Also included in a flurry of legal motions filed here was a defense request for an emergency hearing to bar Yavapai County sheriff ' s deputies from destroying handwritten notes made during their investigation . Requests for blood , saliva and hair samples are routine in murder cases . But Yavapai County Sheriff ' s spokeswoman Laurie Berra said Wednesday that the evidence could also prove key if Huber was sexually abused by her assailant . &quot; We have not ruled_out the possibility that she was sexually assaulted , &quot; Berra said . The samples are also needed for comparisons with evidence collected at Famalaro ' s Prescott Country_Club home -- where authorities found tools and women ' s clothing that appeared to be stained with blood , and also found pubic_hair , said Yavapai Deputy County Counsel Thomas B . Lindberg . Huber , then a 23-year-old waitress who lived with her parents in Newport Beach , vanished the night of June 3 , 1991 , after attending a rock_concert in Los Angeles County . Her abandoned automobile was discovered on the Corona del Mar Freeway with a flat_tire the next morning . Her distraught parents organized what became a nationwide search , but her whereabouts remained a mystery until a paint manufacturer who had dealings with Famalaro became suspicious of a rental truck in his driveway and passed along those suspicions to Arizona authorities , who discovered Huber ' s body in a freezer that was installed and kept running in the truck . The legal demands were filed_in court by Arizona prosecutors , even though there are increasing indications that Famalaro ' s murder trial could be transferred to Orange County . Defense_attorney Thomas K . Kelly , who is not licensed to practice in California , said Wednesday that he has begun looking_for an attorney who could represent Famalaro in Orange County . Kelly said he would prefer that the case be moved to California , since there are more stringent requirements for proving a death_penalty case . Arizona ' s death_penalty guidelines pose fewer problems for prosecutors , and Orange County deputy district_attorneys have acknowledged that they need additional evidence if they are to pursue the death_penalty against Famalaro under California law . A decision on jurisdiction in the case could come as early as today , officials said . Authorities are awaiting the results of critical DNA testing of blood discovered in a Laguna Hills storage facility Famalaro once rented -- and lived_in -- to help solve the issue . Arizona law presumes a murder took_place where the body was discovered . But even Arizona officials have a &quot; gut &quot; feeling that Huber ' s fatal bludgeoning took_place a short distance from the Orange County freeway where her car had a flat on June 3 , 1991 . The jurisdiction debate is holding_up forensic testing in the case -- and the Hubers recently blamed the debate for complicating the family ' s funeral plans . Citing a lack of jurisdiction , Arizona officials last week refused to allow an Orange County forensic pathologist to view the body . But Orange County prosecutors want a chance to conduct their own autopsy and examine Huber ' s remains to help them prepare_for possible prosecution . Law_enforcement sources say it is likely that the body will be released as early as today , paving the way for a possible examination by Orange County pathologist Richard Fukumoto before Huber is buried . Also awaiting testing are pieces of lumber believed to have been used in the Laguna Hills storage facility to enclose a second , upright refrigerator-freezer that authorities have also seized from Famalaro ' s home . In a recent search of the Laguna Hills warehouse , Costa Mesa police found blood in the area where the refrigerator-freezer had been installed , but tests conducted by Arizona authorities found no traces of blood in the refrigerator , which Famalaro had moved_into the kitchen of the Prescott County Club home where he was living until his arrest two weeks ago . Because of those tests results , Sheriff ' s Department spokeswoman Berra said Wednesday that the refrigerator might not have been used to store Huber ' s body . But other law_enforcement sources say the theory has not been ruled_out . Despite the uncertainty over jurisdiction , authorities are proceeding as if Famalaro ' s trial on charges of killing Huber will be held_in Yavapai County , where her nude , handcuffed body was discovered in Famalaro ' s freezer . The defense also filed court records waiving Famalaro ' s personal appearance at his post-indictment arraignment -- scheduled for Monday -- and entered a written plea of not_guilty to a charge of first-degree murder , and a second charge of grand theft . The Ryder rental truck that Famalaro rented to move his personal belongings -- and the freezer containing Huber ' s body -- from Orange County to Arizona was never returned , and the rental company reported it stolen . It was spotted in the driveway of Famalaro ' s home . An electrical cord had been run from the freezer , out the back of the truck , to an outlet at the home of Famalaro ' s mother , who lives_in the house next door . Also on Wednesday , defense_attorneys informed county officials that a private medical_examiner they hired had completed an independent examination of Denise Huber ' s remains at the Maricopa County Medical_Examiner ' s Office in Phoenix . Defense_attorney Kelly declined to comment on the findings of Dr. H . H . Karnitschnig , the private medical_examiner , saying that his report would be prepared in the next three weeks . Kelly said he wants access to the handwritten notes of the Yavapai sheriff ' s deputies , because he fears that officers might have been improperly influenced in preparing their formal reports by public comments made by Famalaro ' s former defense_attorney , Lawrence W . Katz . Katz last week announced his intention to challenge repeated searches of Famalaro ' s home . Katz was later dismissed from the case in favor of Kelly , but not before Katz told reporters that he would fight to invalidate searches of his client ' s home . &quot; I ' m not saying that the ( deputies ) did anything wrong , &quot; Kelly said Wednesday . &quot; But it is possible that they read articles about Katz ' s statements and considered those when preparing their reports. &quot;</TEXT>
