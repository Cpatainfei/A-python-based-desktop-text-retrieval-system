   <HEADLINE> INDUSTRY SHIVERS AT BAN ON CFC REFRIGERANTS ; ENVIRONMENT : AN END TO PRODUCTION OF THE OZONE-ERODING CHEMICALS NEXT YEAR IS FORCING A COSTLY TRANSFORMATION ON AMERICAN BUSINESSES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As governments around the world intensify their war on chemicals that weaken the Earth ' s vital ozone_layer , people like Ron Ford are becoming part of the collateral damage . Ford owns an automotive air-conditioning business in Granada Hills that depends_on Freon , an ozone-eroding gas widely used as a refrigerant . With the federal_government poised to ban production of Freon next year , its price has skyrocketed -- and that is costing Ford . &quot; Customers can ' t afford it , &quot; he said . &quot; Business is way off . And the average customer gets upset at us first , not the government. &quot; Ford is hardly alone in his complaints . Around the nation , the drive to flush Freon and other ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbons out of American cars , homes and factories is forcing a costly , and historic , transformation on consumers and industry . With CFC prices soaring and government imposing new regulations , consumers face higher costs to service their cars and home air conditioners . Reports of CFC smuggling have surfaced . And some industries are converting to a CFC alternative that does no harm to the ozone_layer but is a potent contributor to global warming . Meanwhile , a small but vocal_band of &quot; anti-environmentalists &quot; has launched a counteroffensive in Op-Ed pages and magazine columns , arguing that the adverse impact of CFCs has been overstated . The objects of all this hubbub were once viewed_as among the most useful and versatile compounds ever made . CFCs were found in thousands of consumer products and industrial processes , from aerosol sprays to sterilizing agents for medical_instruments . They were best-known to consumers as coolants in air conditioners and refrigerators . But by the late 1980s , CFCs had become widely viewed_as environmental villains as more and more scientists concluded that the chemicals were behind an alarming thinning of the stratospheric ozone_layer . * Experts worried that a weakened ozone shield would allow more dangerous ultraviolet_radiation to seep through to the Earth ' s surface , setting the stage for devastating increases in skin_cancer and blindness , crop_failures and disruptions of the marine food_chain . &quot; The ozone loss over Antarctica has been spectacular , &quot; F . Sherwood Rowland , a UC Irvine chemistry professor , said recently . Rowland co-wrote the landmark 1974 study theorizing that CFCs were the culprits behind ozone depletion . &quot; We don ' t want that to happen in the Northern_Hemisphere . To avoid anything like that happening , we have to have a total ban on chlorofluorocarbons. &quot; In an extraordinary show of international cooperation , more_than 20 nations in 1987 signed the Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the Ozone_Layer , which sets deadlines for stopping production of CFCs and similar chemicals . More_than 130 nations have now signed the accord . In the United States , CFC production must stop by Dec . 31 , 1995 . * Prodded by the Montreal treaty and the coming federal ban , U.S. industry is retooling on a large scale . And there have been some striking successes as businesses scramble to rid themselves of CFCs and convert to less environmentally damaging substitutes . Makers of foam boxes for hamburgers and other fast foods now use materials with no ozone-ruining agents . Electronics firms and other high-tech manufacturers eliminated CFC-based solvents , switching to cleaning processes that rely_on water or citrus compounds . Rocketdyne , the Canoga Park-based aerospace and defense_contractor that formerly used CFCs to wash metal parts , now employs a water-vibration technique used for years in ultrasonic denture cleaners . Some manufacturers say they have actually saved money by dumping CFCs , which require more steps_in the cleaning process . As industry has begun to wean itself from the chemicals , domestic CFC production has plummeted . According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , about 126 # 000 tons of CFCs were manufactured last year , a 62 % drop from 1986 . Nonetheless , ridding American industry of CFCs remains a monumental task , especially in the air-conditioning and refrigeration sectors . CFCs still are used in more_than 140 million vehicle air conditioners , 160 million home refrigerators , 5 million commercial refrigerators and 80 # 000 air-conditioning systems in skyscrapers and other large buildings . For owners of that machinery , the impending CFC production ban leaves three painful choices : replace the equipment , retrofit to run_on CFC alternatives or stick_with CFCs and face tightening supplies and rising prices . ( Although manufacturing CFCs will be outlawed , it will remain legal to use them in air conditioners and other products. ) * The EPA has estimated the cost of cleansing the United States of CFCs through the year 2075 at $ 45 billion . But that expense will be offset many times , the agency said , by the $ 32 trillion in savings in the form of reduced rates of skin_cancer , crop damage and other problems . So far , the costs of industrial conversion have been largely absorbed by business . But with the federal ban on retail products such_as Freon less than 18 months away , price jumps and the specter of shortages are beginning to hit_home with consumers . &quot; This is where it ' s coming_down to the pocketbook . And that ' s what people haven ' t had to deal with before , &quot; said Catherine L . Andriadis , spokeswoman for Du Pont Co. , one of the world ' s largest CFC producers . Since the Montreal Protocol , Freon prices have zoomed . Six years ago , the compound sold for less than $ 1 a pound . But with the impending phaseout and talk_of shortages , its price has leaped to $ 20 a pound or more . The hikes include a $ 4.35-per-pound federal excise_tax intended to discourage consumption . Rapid price increases have sparked reports of CFCs being smuggled into the United States from China , Russia and other countries . Also , new batches of CFCs manufactured abroad reportedly are being contaminated so they look recycled , thus avoiding federal import quotas . &quot; We don ' t have any direct_evidence . . . but our sense is that ( smuggled and illegally imported CFCs represent ) a fairly significant amount that may add_up to millions or hundreds of thousands of pounds , &quot; said James Harris , a spokesman for Allied-Signal Inc. , a large CFC manufacturer . &quot; We have customers who get offers from importers for truckloads of this material , &quot; he said . The EPA , Customs Service and Internal Revenue Service are investigating reports of CFC smuggling , an EPA spokesman said . * Anticipating possible shortages , many car_makers and other firms are stockpiling large amounts of CFCs . In an effort to head_off supply problems , the Clinton_Administration last year persuaded Du Pont to keep making CFCs through 1995 , even though the firm had planned to halt production at the end of this year . U.S. consumers are most likely to feel rising refrigerant prices when they get their car or home air conditioners serviced . While most new cars use a CFC substitute , 90 million autos with CFC-filled air conditioners will remain on American roads after the production ban takes_effect , according to the EPA . Ford , who owns Acme Auto Air Conditioning of the West Inc. , in Granada Hills , said that with recent Freon price increases , he is charging more_than $ 100 to refill older air-conditioning units -- a service that not long ago cost $ 40 . If CFC prices climb higher , his rates will have to follow , he said . * Older cars can be retrofitted to accept CFC alternatives , but doing so costs up_to $ 800 , according to the EPA . Car_makers have not yet issued retrofit guidelines for most models , and many service technicians recommend against it , saying older-model air conditioners work better with Freon . The situation may be even more unsettled among owners of high-rises and other big buildings with air-conditioning systems that often require several thousand pounds of CFCs . So far , owners of only about 25 % of the country ' s 80 # 000 large air conditioners have converted or replaced them , said Ed Dooley , spokesman for the Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Institute . Industry officials said property_owners have reacted sluggishly because they think the EPA will back_down on the ban at the last minute or that a &quot; drop-in &quot; replacement for CFC refrigerants will be invented , eliminating the need to convert or replace equipment . Most residential air conditioners run_on HCFC-22 , a compound that is not as damaging to the ozone_layer as CFCs but that is scheduled to be banned in 2010 . Although supplies of that coolant remain adequate , costs of servicing home units are rising , driven by federal rules that require repair technicians to recycle HCFC-22 rather than vent it into the open_air . To pass along the costs of expensive gas-recovery equipment , many service technicians have tacked recycling fees on to their regular maintenance charges . In Los Angeles , such fees often range from $ 95 to $ 175 . Many air-conditioning business owners said that despite the prospect of heavy federal fines for illegal venting of ozone-wrecking gases , fly-by-night repair workers routinely do so . &quot; They can ' t afford to buy that ( recycling ) equipment , nor do they , &quot; said Marvin Hendler , president of Air Comfort of California , a small Van Nuys home air-conditioning firm that has shelled_out $ 40 # 000 for recycling machines . &quot; They get_on top of the building and they cut the lines and all_the ( gases ) go_into the atmosphere. &quot; Even with the federal ban on CFCs and strict requirements for recycling , significant leakage of ozone-damaging chemicals will continue , experts said . * &quot; There ' s still going_to be leaks from different sectors , just because of the nature of the equipment , &quot; said Steve Seidel , acting director of the EPA ' s stratospheric protection division . Moreover , environmentalists complain that U.S. industry , by switching so quickly to a leading CFC substitute known as HFC-134a , is trading one serious environmental problem for another . HFC-134a does not erode the ozone_layer , and manufacturers of autos and air conditioners have rushed to redesign their systems to accept it . Most 1994 car models contain air conditioners that use HFC-134a . But environmentalists said HFC-134a is a potent contributor to the &quot; greenhouse_effect , &quot; a gradual increase in Earth ' s temperature caused when solar heat is trapped by atmospheric gases . Some scientists believe higher_temperatures could result in catastrophic rises in sea_levels , altered rain patterns and other environmental problems . Jacques Rosas , who directs an ozone-protection campaign for the environmental group Greenpeace , said HFC-134a &quot; is 3 # 200 times more potent than carbon_dioxide as a greenhouse gas. &quot; Du Pont ' s Andriadis disputes that , saying new data shows that HFC-134a is only 1 # 200 times as potent . * Chemical makers say that given the urgency of the situation , HFC-134a is an acceptable temporary substitute for CFCs despite its adverse side_effects -- a view shared by some environmentalists . Although the chemical_industry says it has spent tens of millions of research dollars , it has yet to come_up with a &quot; silver bullet &quot; substitute that would require no retrofitting . While environmentalists and manufacturers debate HFC-134a technology , critics argue that the threat to the ozone_layer is largely a myth created by shaky science and environmentalist hysteria -- and that the ban is unnecessary . In a recent article in Business Week , one such activist said measurements show that less , not more , ultraviolet_radiation is reaching the Earth and that in any event , malignant_melanoma is caused by a type of UV radiation that is not blocked by ozone . &quot; Whatever the true story turns_out to be eventually , propaganda has prevailed over scientific fact up until now , and a government policy that is going_to impose undue hardship on us all has run far in_advance of the evidence , &quot; wrote Paul Craig Roberts , chairman of the Institute for Political Economy . Seidel and others dismiss such critics , saying there is little question that ozone levels have dropped and the CFC ban is necessary . An international panel of 150 atmospheric scientists recently reaffirmed the need for a ban , he said . &quot; Because of actions taken under the Montreal Protocol , the worst fears of millions and millions of skin_cancers are never going_to be realized , &quot; he said . &quot; Ozone depletion would be higher if there ' d been no action. &quot; But the economic disruptions caused by laws aimed at controlling CFCs are likely to give critics a platform as the government struggles to enforce the phaseout . &quot; People are really in the process of conversion , and conversion is going_to cost a lot of money , &quot; said Rowland , the UC Irvine professor . &quot; Most of these people aren ' t necessarily all that enthralled with science anyway. &quot; How the Ban on CFCs Affects Consumers VEHICLE AIR CONDITIONERS : If you own a car or truck made before last year , odds are that its air-conditioning system runs_on a CFC refrigerant . That means you will be paying more to refill the coolant , which can leak_out . Although it will still be legal to use CFCs after the 1996 ban on production , their cost is likely to rise steeply as supplies dwindle . While many Los Angeles-area garages charged $ 30 to $ 40 to refill an older air conditioner three or four years ago , some now charge $ 100 or more . If you want to get CFCs out of your system now , you can retrofit your unit to run_on a non-CFC substitute ( a common one is HFC-134a ) . But such conversions cost between $ 100 and $ 800 , according to the EPA ( although many mechanics say the government figures are too high ) . Many service technicians do not recommend retrofits , saying modified systems do not work as well as the original CFC-cooled systems . &quot; The whole_thing is new , &quot; said Sam Adler , owner of A &amp; P Automotive in Van Nuys . &quot; Nobody knows how the 134 is going_to work with the new components. &quot; If you own a 1994 model car or truck , you don ' t have to worry about CFCs . Virtually all new vehicles contain substitutes . HOME AIR CONDITIONERS : If your home has an air-conditioning unit , you will be paying more to have it serviced -- but not because of CFCs . Most residential air conditioners use the refrigerant HCFC-22 , a compound that can damage the ozone_layer but not nearly as badly as CFCs are believed to . Nonetheless , HCFC-22 is considered enough of an environmental threat that its production will be halted in stages , with a complete phaseout by 2030 . So why are your servicing costs higher ? Since 1992 , the EPA has required repair workers to recycle HCFC-22 gas whenever home units are disassembled . Many service_firms pass along the cost of recycling machinery by charging customers a recycling fee , which may range from $ 95 to $ 175 , in addition to regular maintenance charges . You ' ll also have to shell_out more for the HCFC-22 refrigerant . A pound now costs from $ 8 to $ 15 , up from about $ 6 or less a_few years ago . The price rise is mostly driven by a federal storage tax designed to discourage use of the compound . Home air-conditioning units typically require about eight pounds .</TEXT>
