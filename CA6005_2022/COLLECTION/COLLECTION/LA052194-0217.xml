It said the culprits should be tried_for crimes against humanity . The Inter-American Human_Rights Commission said it verified reports of kidnapings , politically motivated rapes , secret torture centers and severely mutilated corpses left in the streets . &quot; The kind of crimes being committed by the de_facto authorities are international crimes which would incur individual responsibility , &quot; Patrick Robinson , a member of the OAS group , said while wrapping_up a five-day fact-finding mission . The five-member delegation reported 133 political executions and 55 abductions linked to politics , mostly of supporters of exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide .
