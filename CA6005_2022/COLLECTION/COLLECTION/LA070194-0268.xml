   <HEADLINE> GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS : BURBANK ; AIRPORT TO CHARGE ADDITIONAL $ 3 FEE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Burbank Airport will charge all outbound passengers an extra $ 3 fee , beginning Sept . 1 , airport officials said . The new fee , approved recently by federal_officials , is expected to raise about $ 35 million over the next seven years to help pay_for runway reconstruction , land acquisition and construction of an aircraft rescue and firefighting station , said Victor Gill , a Burbank Airport spokesman . Airlines traditionally oppose such fees because they are tacked onto ticket prices . But all seven airlines that fly into Burbank Airport supported the fee because of the advantages that would spring from the improved facilities . No public opposition surfaced either , Gill said . Since legislation was approved four years ago , airports around the nation have imposed the passenger facility charge , including Los Angeles International and Ontario Airport . But other Southern California airports , including Long_Beach and San Diego , do not charge the fee . TRACEY KAPLAN</TEXT>
