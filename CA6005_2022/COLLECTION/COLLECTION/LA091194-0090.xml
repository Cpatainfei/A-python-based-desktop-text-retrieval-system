   <HEADLINE> DEATH AND TERRORISM ARE NEVER FUNNY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Regarding Robin Abcarian ' s column on Carlos the Jackal ( &quot; Carlos Takes Tinseltown ? He Could ' ve Been a Terror , &quot; Aug . 24 ) : Your article -- intended to be witty , I am sure -- was in terribly bad taste . Shocking.There can never be anything funny about people bleeding in airports after being machine-gunned or planes being blown_up . There must be a_thousand ways to poke_fun at Hollywood . Terrorism is definitely not one of them . On that day , your pen should have dried_up . MAURICE KORNBERG Los Angeles</TEXT>
