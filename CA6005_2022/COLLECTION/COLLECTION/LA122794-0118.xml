   <TEXT> ITT Corp . will sell a big piece of its far-flung empire to the U.S. arm of a large German bank for about $ 4 billion , the companies said Monday in one of the biggest takeover deals announced this year . The sale of ITT ' s commercial finance unit comes a week after the hotel conglomerate arranged to buy Los Angeles-based Caesars World Inc. for $ 1.7 billion in a major bid to boost its presence in the gambling and entertainment businesses . ITT is selling ITT Commercial Finance to Deutsche Bank North_America , the American subsidiary of one of Germany ' s largest banks . ITT Commercial Finance lends money to distributors of products ranging from personal_computers to motorcycles , a business known as asset-based lending . For Deutsche Bank , the acquisition will quadruple its presence in asset-based loans to about $ 5.1 billion , the company said . &quot; This acquisition will accelerate DBNA ' s strategy to become a leader in the rapidly growing business of asset-based lending , &quot; John Rolls , DBNA president and CEO , said in a statement . &quot; ITT Commercial Finance has established a strong industry presence reflecting its record of product innovation , systems development and strong financial performance. &quot; The purchase will cost about $ 4 billion , said Christian Allaire , a spokeswoman for DBNA , a unit of Germany ' s Deutsche Bank AG . No other financial terms were disclosed . ITT , parent of the Sheraton hotel chain , has been trying to bolster its entertainment and lodging division , which lags behind its two more established core businesses -- insurance and manufacturing . As part of that effort , ITT had said it would seek bids for its consumer and commercial finance business . Earlier this year , ITT and the cable company Cablevision Systems Inc. agreed to pay the entertainment conglomerate Viacom Inc. $ 1.08 billion for Madison Square Garden , which owns the New York arena of the same name , pro basketball ' s Knicks , pro hockey ' s Rangers , and MSG , a sports cable network .
