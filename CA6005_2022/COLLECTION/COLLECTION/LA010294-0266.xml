   <HEADLINE> BUT IS THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY A HIGHWAY ? ; ECONOMY : BUSINESSES ARE BETTING BIG MONEY BY LAYING NEW CABLE -- WHICH COULD BE OBSOLETE BEFORE IT ' S USED . MAYBE IT ' S AN INFORMATION OCEAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There ' s nothing wrong with the Clinton_Administration ' s fascination for building its much-touted &quot; information superhighway &quot; -- except it probably won ' t be a highway and the federal_government can ' t build it and shouldn ' t try . The real challenge is not to get the federal_government into the communication business , but to get_it adroitly out . Both President Bill_Clinton and Vice_President Al Gore are fond of using the analogy of the Eisenhower-era federal highway program for the job of building a modern , end-of-century , information infrastructure . But the highway analogy is decidedly unhelpful as a blueprint for the information age . In the 1950s , people knew how to build highways . Construction technology and road design was a lot better than , say , in 50 BC , but in truth , not that much better . U.S. highways were laid_out and built_in much the same way as the ones the Romans built 20 centuries earlier . And in both the Roman and American cases , only the central government had the resources and the strategic vantage_point to put such a system in place -- hardly the case when it comes_to information technology . The most useful learning from the experience of the federal highway program , aside from its scale and cost , may be that none of its more profound consequences -- like the hollowing out of older cities and proliferation of strip developments -- were anticipated by its planners . Clinton and Gore seemed to hit on the highway analogy from the success of the &quot; Internet , &quot; a set of high-capacity data connections linking universities and federal research_centers , developed mostly with federal money . Internet use has soared , creating an arcane cyberspace party land for wonks , but also speeding the dissemination of new research . After spending months mining campaign contributions from Silicon_Valley executives , Clinton and Gore both became impressed , correctly , that the next wave of computer_technology would involve connecting computers rather than just making them run faster . The country with the lead in communications technology would be_well positioned to take the lead in the global high-tech sweepstakes . America had a good shot at cementing a winning position , and the federal_government should help . Again , correct . The logical , but probably incorrect , conclusion was that the brave new information infrastructure would just be an extended Internet . The conventional wisdom also had it that only the federal_government had the financial capacity to pay_for the thousands of miles of high-capacity fiber-optic cable that most people expect to be the backbone of the system . Confounding expectations , however , business is smelling gold in high-tech &quot; multimedia &quot; entertainment and business products , and is laying_down an information infrastructure faster than anyone imagined just a short time ago . TCI and Time-Warner , which together serve more_than a third of cable households , are spending some $ 7 billion over the next several years on fiber optics . Telephone_companies are spending even more . At this point , it ' s not obvious that the final information &quot; highway &quot; will be a highway . Current broadcast technology uses hardly 1 % of the available electromagnetic_spectrum . New technology -- at microwave frequencies and above -- can rival fiber optics in capacity , clarity and freedom from interference . New cableless &quot; cable &quot; offerings from Hughes and the newest versions of microwave telephone_service under development could , in theory , make much of the frenzied cable laying obsolete before it ' s ever used . An &quot; information ocean &quot; may be closer to the future reality than a highway . Information might be transmitted by launching tiny packets of specially coded information out into space . Your computer would pick_up only those specifically intended for you and assemble them into a coherent message , which could be a personal_letter or a hit movie -- no cables , no central switching system required . Or , instead of being beamed into space , they could be pumped into a &quot; dumb &quot; fiber network , a sort of universal river of information , with the movies , or memos , or data bases , being reassembled by computers sitting on the river bank watching the stream zip_by . With so_much uncertainty , many , probably most , technology and marketing bets will turn_out to be wrong . The driving force may be entertainment -- interactive video , home_movies , video_games distributed by television channel or that holy_grail of home viewing , virtual-reality pornography . Or it may be business -- portable data networks , video conferencing , electronic books and catalogues , home shopping . Or some unexpected combination of the two . The winning technology may be wire , fiber optic , microwave , CD ROM , switched networks or passive information &quot; oceans. &quot; The missing ingredient may simply be Hollywood production values -- much of what now passes as &quot; multimedia &quot; educational or entertainment material is poor . Home viewers may flock to interactive new features or prefer couch-potato passivity . Nobody knows . What is certain is that some companies will make a lot of money -- and a lot more will lose out . It ' s also obvious that it makes no sense for the federal_government to weigh in and start building things . Judging by Gore ' s more recent speeches , the Administration has now come_to that same conclusion . But what should the federal_government do ? The communication industry is now one of the country ' s most regulated . And the regulatory apparatus is a huge , ramshackle structure . One of the system ' s keystones , in fact , is an elderly federal judge who supervised the AT &amp; T antitrust_case more_than a decade ago , and therefore still has the final , sometimes quirky , say on what businesses phone_companies may enter . Since it ' s grown like a coral_reef , the system is honeycombed with special_interests -- some more laudable than others . Local telephone regulators keep local service_charges artificially low -- voters seem to like that -- but sock it to business and callers connecting from out of state . Newspapers are panicked that regulators will let phone_companies provide electronic &quot; Yellow Page &quot; services , cutting_into lucrative advertising revenues ( and , incidentally , preserving forests ) . Powerful congressmen , business_executives and consumer groups stand like so many Horatios , ready to defend their pet interests to the death . Hewing some sort of sensible new regulatory pathway through the current maze -- in particular , trying to decide what to stop regulating -- is the kind of problem politicians shun . All you can do is offend people ; it ' s far more fun to break champagne bottles over a federally subsidized TVA for information technology . But this is the kind of nasty task that we elect governments for , and is a real opportunity for the Clinton-Gore team to make a long-term contribution to the country ' s economic leadership .</TEXT>
