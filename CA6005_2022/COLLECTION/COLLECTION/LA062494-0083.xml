   <HEADLINE> ANOTHER DAY OF SURPRISES CLAIMS MANY ; WIMBLEDON : NO . 3 EDBERG AND NO . 5 COURIER ARE MOST PROMINENT UPSET VICTIMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Swede-turned-Londoner Stefan Edberg arrived_at Wimbledon with a No . 3 seeding and the memories of two Wimbledon championships . He didn ' t figure he ' d be going_home Thursday . . . to stay . But that ' s where Edberg will be , at_home and at_a_loss to explain how he was beaten by 113th-ranked Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark , 6-7 ( 8-6 ) , 6-7 ( 8-6 ) , 6-2 , 6-4 , 6-4 . As it turns_out , he wasn ' t the only seeded player departing the premises prematurely . American Jim Courier , a finalist last year and seeded fifth this time around , dropped his second-round match to France ' s Guy Forget , 3-6 , 6-3 , 3-6 , 6-3 , 6-4 . Forget , a virtual no-show on the tour because of a knee injury , had seen his world ranking drop to 1 # 130 . Had it not been for a ruling that allows an injured player to keep his protected ranking -- in Forget ' s case , 24th -- the Frenchman would have been back home_in Neuchatel , Switzerland , channel surfing . Instead , he bounced Courier , who has never been entirely comfortable playing_on grass . But this ? &quot; I told ( Forget ) , if I have to lose to somebody and give them my bonus point , I ' d just as soon as him have them , &quot; Courier said . &quot; He played well . He deserved to win. &quot; But the daily upset binge didn ' t stop with Edberg and Courier . Eleventh-seeded Petr Korda of the Czech Republic lost to Germany ' s Markus Zoecke , 4-6 , 6-7 ( 7-5 ) , 6-3 , 6-2 , 6-4 . Zoecke was ranked 104th . Meanwhile , Katarina Maleeva of Bulgaria , seeded 16th in the women ' s draw , dropped her match to Indonesia ' s Yayuk Basuki , 5-7 , 7-6 ( 7-3 ) , 6-4 . The defeats sent the Wimbledon seeding committee running_for partial cover , especially since the sport ' s most prestigious tournament has now lost three men seeded among the top five -- Edberg , Courier and No . 2 Michael Stich -- and its No . 1 woman , the supposedly invincible Steffi Graf . It could have been worse . No . 8 Sergi Bruguera of Spain , winner of the last two French Open tournaments , needed nearly 4 1 / 2 hours to beat Australian Patrick Rafter , 7-6 ( 7-4 ) , 3-6 , 4-6 , 7-5 , 13-11 . Rafter , ranked 21st , is no pushover . Then again , no one compares him to Rod Laver , either . This is what Wimbledon has been reduced to : a grassy free-for-all . Edberg , Courier , Maleeva gone_on Thursday . Stich , No . 8 Natalia Zvereva , No . 12 Anke Huber , No . 14 Marc Rosset and No . 16 Arnaud Boetsch on Wednesday . Graf on Tuesday . Cedric Pioline , seeded No . 15 , and , on the women ' s side , No . 15 Sabine Hack , were both ousted on Monday . Suddenly , if you can string a racket and know the difference between ad court and Margaret Court you can win this thing . &quot; Obviously , it has changed this year , &quot; Edberg said of the upsets galore . &quot; Whether it is going_to start a trend , I cannot tell you. &quot; With another day of unlikely losses , the totals stand as follows : among seeded players , seven men and five women are history . It wasn ' t supposed to be this way . For instance , Edberg ' s game -- big on serve and volley -- was considered good_enough to get him to at least the quarterfinals , if not the semifinals . He hadn ' t lost to an unseeded player since 1986 , hadn ' t failed to reach the third round since 1984 . None of that mattered Thursday . For only the third time in his career , Edberg took a two-set lead and somehow lost in five sets . &quot; I don ' t know what to say -- I had my chances , &quot; Edberg said with something of a shrug . It is becoming a common theme during Wimbledon ' s Week 1 . Opportunities lost . Just ask Courier , Graf and the rest of them . Edberg led in the fourth set , 2-0 , but botched the next game and that was that . Carlsen , ranked as low as 1 # 036 three years ago , took_advantage of the opening and never glanced back , except for one brief , late moment . that ' s when the Swedish star fought_off four match_points to hold serve and close the gap to 4-5 in the third set . So_much for valiant comebacks . Edberg couldn ' t win a point in the next game and left the court looking_for his car keys . &quot; I fought for every point_out there , &quot; Edberg said . &quot; I didn ' t take my chances . that ' s the story. &quot; Of course , it didn ' t hurt Carlsen ' s chances that Edberg wasn ' t much of a serving threat . He used to have one , especially a second serve that did all sorts of wonderful things . Not Thursday . Carlsen recorded 14 aces , Edberg two . &quot; Maybe he lost a little bit of his concentration and I got_into the match in the third set and won that very big , &quot; said Carlsen , who was playing in only his sixth Grand_Slam event . &quot; Then in the fourth set he was pretty tired . He had some chances to win that one. &quot; The victory was Carlsen ' s first against a seeded player in a Grand_Slam event , and only his eighth overall . As if it matters these days at Wimbledon . The victory by Forget was another matter altogether . An elite player before his injury , Forget underwent knee surgery last September and played only a_few matches before making his way to Wimbledon under protected status . He beat Doug Flach in the first round and then found himself matched against Courier . By ranking , it was the worst mismatch in history : No . 7 vs . No . 1 # 130 . &quot; I don ' t know what to expect , &quot; Forget said . &quot; When I came_in here , I had a_few wins and I looked_at Wimbledon just trying to win one match . When I saw the draw , I thought , ' It ' s a tough one but you never know . . . just try to play your best. ' I knew I could have lost and I could fly home tomorrow. &quot; Later , Forget admitted what almost everyone in the stands had already figured at match ' s beginning . &quot; I didn ' t think I could win , &quot; he said . &quot; But I knew I had the potential of doing it. &quot; So what else is new at Wimbledon this year ? Seeds be damned . Grab a racket , do the improbable . &quot; It ' s a dangerous surface -- grass , &quot; Courier said . No need for the reminder .</TEXT>
