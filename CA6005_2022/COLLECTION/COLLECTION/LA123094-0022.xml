   <TEXT> For 58 years -- an eternity in this town -- Chasen ' s was the quintessence of Hollywood , as sublime as the expensive caviar that is_on the menu and as low-brow as the world-famous chili that is not . It was the spot where fans could find President Ronald Reagan with his boiled beef in Booth No . 2 . Alfred Hitchcock routinely fell_asleep at his table . Humphrey Bogart and his third wife fought raucously at theirs . Howard Hughes once rose from his and asked to use the house phone for a second . He was still gabbing like a wild_man at 4 a.m. There was a time when everyone who was anyone in Hollywood could have been found in one of the deep , dark banquettes at Chasen ' s , on the dance_floor at the Cocoanut Grove , in the foyer of Cafe Trocadero or tucking into a Cobb salad at the Brown Derby . But those were the days when a star was a star and a restaurant was not just a hangout or a plate of food but an establishment in which to see and be seen . Now , for reasons sociological and otherwise , neither stars nor their backdrops , no matter how dazzling , seem quite what they used to be . And in a city where the bon_mot of the moment is , &quot; That is soooo five-minutes-ago , &quot; there isn ' t much room for institutions anymore , either of the human or the brick and mortar variety . &quot; The idea in Hollywood is to be in the prow , &quot; said Neal Gabler , who has written extensively about Tinseltown history . &quot; The idea is to be at that place that is the center of the center . And Chasen ' s became an anachronism. &quot; Gabler and other historians say the closing this spring of Dave and Maude Chasen ' s sprawling ersatz chateau will mark the latest -- and nearly the last -- nail in the coffin for Old Hollywood . Its owners promise that the West Hollywood eatery will someday return , in a new and &quot; streamlined &quot; incarnation , but restaurateurs and other observers of Los Angeles ' social culture contend that it is more likely that it will join such bygone glamour spots as Perino ' s , Romanoff ' s , Scandia , the Mocambo and the Zebra Room in that big back booth in the sky . * In the time it takes_to read this article , the latest Hollywood in-spot will probably be_on its way_out -- part of the inevitable rhythm of doing business in modern Los Angeles . House of Blues , Viper Room and Tatou are at the cutting edge of a subculture that may be more fickle than any in history . Indeed , in the Los Angeles of the 1990s , today ' s &quot; institution &quot; is tomorrow ' s commercial-space-for-lease . &quot; You have to live with the realization that this town changes a lot , &quot; said Jerry Prendergast , general_manager of Sanctuary , a currently hip restaurant in Beverly Hills that previously housed the once-hip Cafe Morpheus and before that the also-hip Asylum . &quot; Everyone comes here to get_away from tradition , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m surprised that there ' s actually a Brooks Brothers here. &quot; It was not always this way . There was a time , it seemed , when icons had more_than 15 minutes of fame , and a place that could last for 58 years might stand a shot at immortality . Still , as Chasen ' s moved past its prime in the late ' 70s , historian Gabler noted , &quot; the action moved_on to Ma Maison , to Spago . To be at Chasen ' s was to mark yourself as a dinosaur , it was to be in the past with the Brown Derby or Romanoff ' s . They ' re all gone now because Hollywood is a place where the object is to be in_vogue . . . . Sometime it will be Spago ' s turn . They all have built-in obsolescence . They are all dependent_on being_on the very edge. &quot; Gabler , who did research on Chasen ' s for his 1988 book &quot; An Empire of Their Own : How the Jews Invented Hollywood , &quot; said the trend reflects not only the fast-forward nature of ' 90s L.A. , but the evolution of Hollywood stardom . With the collapse of the tightly controlled studio system , glamour was transferred from a_few special settings to a constantly changing cast of individuals , he said . So hot places today do not have to be designed for luxury because the spark comes &quot; from the people who are there , not that notion of the restaurant as stage_setting , &quot; Gabler said . Film archivist and historian Marc Wanamaker can rattle_off the obituary list of restaurants and nightclubs that once were synonymous with traditional Hollywood glitz . With Chasen ' s soon to join them , only Musso &amp; Frank on Hollywood Boulevard will remain , he said . ' It represents the typical lack of interest in supporting the old places , &quot; Wanamaker said &quot; The old people are dying_off or are not going there anymore . The newer people have no cultural roots here , nothing that relates them to Chasen ' s or Musso ' s and they couldn ' t care less . The crux of the problem is that most people have no cultural or emotional ties to any of these landmarks. &quot; Just last year , another beloved institution -- Nickodell Restaurant -- was shuttered . The Melrose Avenue eatery had been a hangout for actors and technicians from Paramount Pictures , its next-door neighbor , since the 1920s . It was a martini and club steak kind of place in a town increasingly hooked on bottled water and tuna tacos . Business fell_into decline and the neighborhood got rougher . Paramount , the landlord for three years , at first insisted that it had no immediate plans for the site after the restaurant closed . But a_few weeks later , Nickodell and its towering blue-and-white sign were gone . In an example of Hollywood wizardry , the Paramount parking_lot fence was extended around the property and mature bushes lined the perimeter as if nothing else had ever been there . Then , after the Northridge earthquake in January further weakened the boarded-up and fire-damaged Brown Derby restaurant building on Vine Street in Hollywood , property_owners opted for demolition of that once-proud establishment . Preservationists insisted that the 1929 building where Clark Gable proposed_marriage to Carole Lombard could have been saved . But a parking_lot emerged and the protesters were reduced to holding a mock funeral . ( The Original Brown Derby on Wilshire Boulevard -- an informal lunch counter that spawned the fancier Derby on Vine -- was ripped down in the mid- ' 80s and its signature hat crowns the mini-mall on the site. ) The Cocoanut Grove Club , once the epicenter of movieland social life and the scene of several Academy Awards ceremonies , closed_in 1988 after 67 years in business . The fate of the building is uncertain . Perino ' s , the elegant eatery that fed the_likes_of Cole Porter , Eleanor Roosevelt and Bugsy Siegel , suffered a lingering death . It opened in 1932 on Wilshire Boulevard and later moved to another spot on the street where it survived until a 1985 bankruptcy ; an attempted revival did not succeed although the structure still stands . &quot; L.A. has never been a place to revere its history or respect its history , &quot; said Greg Williams , a preservation activist with the Hollywood Heritage organization , which tried to save the Brown Derby . &quot; We always like the fresh and new , build it up and tear it down . But I don ' t find a lot of it is an improvement . We tear too_much of it down and wind_up with nothing. &quot; Hollywood old-timers agree . &quot; I ' ve seen the business change and Chasen ' s is a symbol of what once was , &quot; said 69-year-old Danny Arnold , producer of such shows as &quot; Barney Miller , &quot; &quot; My World and Welcome to It , &quot; &quot; Bewitched &quot; and &quot; That Girl. &quot; &quot; In the old days , the industry was interested in the classics , there was a great_deal more charm , &quot; he said . &quot; Today , I think everything appeals_to raw emotions and it ' s a reflection of the times we live in. &quot; That , he said , is apparent even in the movies themselves . &quot; If you don ' t blow_up five buildings and kill 30 people in the first 40 feet of film , you ' re going downhill. &quot; * In its first incarnation , Chasen ' s hardly had the look of a Hollywood glamour palace . The place had six tables , an eight-stool counter and sold chili at 25 cents a bowl . Bar drinks ran about 35 cents . About 15 people attended the restaurant ' s opening_night , Dec . 13 , 1936 , but they were the kind of people who in those days could set a restaurant for life : Frank Capra . Jimmy Cagney . Pat O ' Brien . From then on , Chasen ' s joined the Hollywood pantheon and became the sort of place that would evoke vivid memories decades hence -- of the escapades that occurred there , the famous faces , the deals , the setting , the owners themselves . &quot; I remember Chasen ' s when it was just a barbecue pit , &quot; sighed Lita Grey Chaplin , Charlie Chaplin ' s second wife , who is 86 and living_in West Hollywood . &quot; Through the years it grew and grew until it became one of the most popular restaurants in town , for film luminaries and so forth. &quot; Walter Seltzer , the veteran producer and a former Hollywood public relations man , said he will never forget Dean Martin ' s bachelor_party when another well-known star &quot; got very drunk and managed to shock even the most sophisticated friends of Dean by ( relieving himself ) into the potted plants. &quot; Shenanigans and gimmicks were the order_of_the_day , and restaurateurs who were willing to play_along were part of what made the industry run . Ciro ' s became legendary as the spot where contract players were sent_on fake dates arranged by studio publicists . The people caricatured at the Brown Derby , and the placement of their cartoons , could make or break careers . The eatery also gave 50 % discounts to gossip_columnists simply for showing_up and eavesdropping . In a town that lives on its own P.R. , Chasen ' s ranked with the best of them . When a movie_star -- any movie_star -- got admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center , Chasen ' s would ship some chili over so the celebrity would not have to eat hospital food . When Shirley Temple sobbed one night for a cocktail like the ones her mother and father had , the bartender purportedly invented a concoction of ginger_ale , grenadine and fruit that still bears her name . When a pregnant Dorothy Lamour was uncomfortable at Table 12 , Dave Chasen had a portion of it cut_out to comfortably accommodate her . The place , Seltzer said , &quot; instilled the feeling that you were in a private club , populated by your colleagues and by your peers and by your bosses . It was a social event. &quot; And Sunday night , he added , was the prime_time at the place . &quot; Dress code was strictly observed , a coat and tie , &quot; he said . &quot; And ( they had ) a marvelous conceit even when credit_cards were available , a house account . If you had a Chasen ' s account , that was a badge of belonging , of importance . That was a sociological phenomenon of the time. &quot; The heyday of the restaurant stretched on through the decades , through change upon change in fads , food and philosophy . Through the 1940s , 1950s and 1960s , Chasen ' s flourished , maturing from its humble origins to a sumptuous , gated mansion of a place , with soft lighting and expensive furnishings and solicitous waiters and -- the selling point that would one day contribute to its demise -- an emphasis on old-fashioned class and old-fashioned food and lots and lots of elbowroom . &quot; It represented the era when the studios ran the town . . . when the star system was in its glory , &quot; said Herb Steinberg , former vice_president of MCA Recreation Division and a Chasen ' s regular since 1955 . &quot; You went , you dressed_up , you wore a shirt and tie . It was a great atmosphere. &quot; But what once seemed like great atmosphere came increasingly to resemble stultifying boredom as the old Hollywood haunts gave_way to the new , and tuxedos and cocktail frocks were replaced by Armani jackets and jeans , regardless of gender . &quot; Chasen ' s out-aged the new generation , &quot; Steinberg lamented . &quot; They don ' t have the formality , they like to go_to places where you don ' t have a tie . They like to go_to places where you don ' t have to make a reservation . At Chasen ' s , you always had to make a reservation. &quot; Eventually , economics took_over . Although Chasen ' s made_it through the 1970s to a Reagan-era renaissance in the 1980s , the recession hit all Los Angeles restaurants , especially the big places like Chasen ' s that had high overheads . Time took its toll as well . Dave Chasen , an ex-vaudevillian who had more luck with his chili than with his comedy , died in 1973 and Maude , once an inveterate table-hopper , is in her 90s . She reportedly has scarcely gone_to the restaurant during the past year . And for today ' s trendies -- the GenX-ers who make and break fashion -- old_age made Chasen ' s and places like it irrelevant . Who wanted to spend an evening rubbernecking at , say , ninetysomething George Burns when Johnny Depp might be at the Viper Room five minutes away ? Now the Chasen ' s site is being sold to a developer who plans to put_up a mall with a supermarket , a chain drugstore and perhaps even a scaled-down version of Maude and Dave ' s place . But a comeback restaurant might find it tough going in a world where younger stars scoff at the aura of formality that Old Hollywood adored . &quot; The last few years , it ' s been all grunge and jeans , &quot; said Pamela Anderson , a co-star of the hot TV series &quot; Baywatch &quot; and a restaurant investor herself . Angela Janklow , editor of Mouth2Mouth magazine , which caters to readers in their 20s , said Chasen ' s is in a &quot; rarefied realm of restaurants where you would make a plan to go there , you would have to dress_up , and your dreams the night before would be of a Hobo steak. &quot; She , personally , has not been to Chasen ' s since her last big family gathering , &quot; a grand , ceremonial evening with Gramps. &quot; Times staff writers Tina Daunt , Ralph Frammolino , Laura A . Galloway , Kathie Jenkins , Bob Pool and Jeannine Stein contributed to this story .</TEXT>
