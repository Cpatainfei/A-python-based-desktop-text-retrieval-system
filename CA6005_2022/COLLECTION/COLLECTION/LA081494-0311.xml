   <HEADLINE> QUAKE DOUBLES USE OF COMMUTER_TRAINS , SURVEY FINDS ; TRANSIT : MANY OF THE NEW RIDERS CITE DAMAGED FREEWAYS AS THEIR REASON FOR TAKING METROLINK . BUT WHITE MALE PROFESSIONALS ARE STILL MOST FREQUENT USERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Southern California ' s commuter_trains carry twice as_many passengers now as before the Northridge earthquake , and the average rider is a well-heeled white male professional from the suburbs , according to results of a survey released Friday . The number of women and minority group riders increased only slightly , if at all , in the past year , the survey found . Nearly half the Metrolink system ' s 15 # 500 daily riders began taking the periwinkle and white trains after the January quake . Many of those new customers -- one-sixth of the current passengers -- identified quake damage to the freeways as the reason they ride Metrolink . Metrolink passengers overall -- the majority of whom receive subsidies from their employers to take the train -- continue to report high satisfaction with the 2-year-old train service , although some complain of high fares , delays and poor connections at their destinations . The survey results , based on a Metrolink poll of 4 # 527 riders in June , show little change in the typical passenger profile since a similar study last year . Despite some official attempts to diversify ridership , the trains still attract affluent white-collar workers -- mostly male executives and managers -- from households with an average annual income of $ 64 # 450 . More_than half ( 55 % ) receive subsidies from their employers to ride the trains . The subsidies average $ 58 a month . The socioeconomic status of Metrolink customers continues to stand_in stark contrast to that of the region ' s bus users , who are overwhelmingly members of ethnic minority groups with household incomes of less than $ 30 # 000 a year . That disparity was recently brought into the debate over the decision to raise bus_fares for the first time in six years . Metrolink officials slashed fares for several months as an earthquake-relief measure . The surveyed riders gave Metrolink high marks for service , personal safety and professional courtesy from staff . They said they are under less stress because they no longer have to drive to work . Three out of five passengers surveyed had commuted alone by automobile . Still , 75 % of riders -- even those who live within five miles of their stations -- drive alone to the train_station , which means they &quot; cold start &quot; their cars each workday morning . Cold starts are the single biggest contributor to air_pollution . The survey , which has a margin of error of less than 2 percentage_points , found that : * Nearly half of all passengers began using the system after the January earthquake . About 48 % of these new customers identified the temblor as their reason for turning_to the trains . They account_for one-sixth of the current ridership . On the Santa Clarita line , three out of four passengers traced their ridership to the quake . * 52 % of riders are men -- the same proportion as last year -- while 48 % of passengers are women , up from 45 % . ( In last year ' s survey , 3 % of respondents did not specify whether they were male or female. ) * As was the case last year , whites make_up two-thirds of those who ride the trains . The proportion is even higher along some routes , such_as the Ventura line and the Santa Clarita line ( 74 % ) . * The percentage of African Americans using Metrolink rose to 9.4 % this year from 7 % last year . Latinos registered a tiny rise , from 13 % to 13.1 % . Asian American ridership dropped from 13 % to 9.1 % .</TEXT>
