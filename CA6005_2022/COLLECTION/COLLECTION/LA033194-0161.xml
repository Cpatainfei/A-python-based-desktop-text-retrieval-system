   <HEADLINE> ITALY VICTOR APPARENTLY CLEARS WAY TO GOVERN ; POLITICS : BILLIONAIRE BERLUSCONI SEEMS TO HAVE STRUCK DEAL WITH JUNIOR PARTNER IN RIGHT-WING ALLIANCE . ANALYSTS WELCOME NEWS AS SIGN OF STABILITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Overnight political sensation Silvio Berlusconi apparently overcame objections from a fractious partner in his victorious right-wing electoral alliance Wednesday , clearing the media baron ' s path to become Italian prime_minister . The 57-year-old billionaire , who emerged from weekend elections as leader of the country ' s biggest political_party , told reporters in his hometown of Milan that he expects quick formation of a government with himself at its head . Italian analysts welcomed the news as a tonic for stability . They cautioned , though , that there are still any number of Machiavellian intricacies to be played_out before any new government can take_office in mid-April . Berlusconi made his remarks after meeting in Milan with Umberto Bossi , head of the federalist , sometimes secessionist Northern League , junior partner in the three-party alliance that rewrote Italian political history by toppling corrupt centrist parties from nearly half a century of power . &quot; I guaranteed the possibility of good government to this country . . . . I am personally sure that we will do_it , and do_it soon , &quot; Berlusconi said . &quot; I think that government must be guided by the pole which won , and Berlusconi is the leader of this force , &quot; he added , referring to himself in the third_person . The abrasive Bossi , who sometimes talks_of dividing Italy into three states , ran in the weekend election in tandem with Berlusconi ' s 3-month-old Forza Italia ( Go Italy ) movement and the neo-fascist National Alliance headed by Gianfranco Fini . When the conservatives emerged with a stunning victory , Bossi immediately ruled_out collaborating in a government with Fini , whose southern-based party -- the direct descendant of former dictator Benito Mussolini -- believes_in a strong central government . Bossi also said he would veto Berlusconi for the prime_minister ' s job because he is a leading member of an Italian business_Establishment that needs reform in the wake of its decades of conspiracy with politicians and their parties in institutionalized corruption . Berlusconi , whose Fininvest empire had sales of around $ 7 billion last year , is attacked by critics for his close ties to his corruption-linked friend and former prime_minister , Bettino Craxi . The would-be prime_minister , who jumped into politics two months ago because he feared a leftist victory , has not been named in a scandal that has tarred other leading Italian industrialists . For all his reservations , Bossi was nearly as upbeat as Berlusconi after their first post-election meeting , which he said focused mostly on forging a common government program . &quot; We found partial and reciprocal satisfaction . Next week we hope to tie things up , &quot; Bossi told reporters . Italian analysts said Bossi has apparently agreed to a Northern League representative , but not himself , as deputy prime_minister on the further understanding that Fini would not join the government , although members of his party would get ministerial posts . Asked whether Bossi had dropped his objections , Berlusconi told Italian reporters : &quot; I think that was the conclusion of our meeting. &quot; For his part , Fini , 42 , who has renamed the neo-fascists and moved them away from the extreme right , said he was &quot; trusting and optimistic of an agreement. &quot; Under Fini , the party ' s vote has swelled . It controls nearly one-third of the right ' s 366 seats in the new 630-member Chamber of Deputies .</TEXT>
