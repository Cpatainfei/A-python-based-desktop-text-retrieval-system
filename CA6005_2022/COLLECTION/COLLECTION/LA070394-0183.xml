   <HEADLINE> ART PROCESS A BOOMING SHRINKING BUSINESS ; TORRANCE : A STUDIO USES A PAINSTAKING PROCEDURE CALLED SERIGRAPH TO REPRODUCE DESIGNS IN SMALLER SIZES . IT CAN TAKE_UP TO THREE MONTHS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Painter Leslie Sayour likes to splash color across big canvases when she paints . But Japanese consumers , who pay as much as $ 55 # 000 for her impressionistic oil_paintings , want art that fits into their small homes . So Sayour , who sells most of her work in Japan , takes her paintings to Kolibri Art Studio in Torrance , where Herta Hedrick uses a painstaking printing technique called serigraphy to reproduce the designs in smaller sizes . The prints , valued between $ 2 # 500 and $ 3 # 500 , look so_much like an original painting that it can be hard to tell the two apart . Typically , artists request 200 to 500 copies of each work . Since the studio opened at 2908 Oregon Court 3 1 / 2 years ago , it has reproduced about 55 works . Only about five studios in the Los Angeles area do fine-art serigraph printing . Serigraphers separate and print each color_in a painting . For brightly colored works such_as Sayour ' s , each print passes_through the press more_than 100 times . The layers of ink coat the canvas and combine colors to duplicate the effects created by an oil_painter . Special overlays of web-like black lines imitate the artist ' s brush strokes . Five artists work full time for Hedrick to separate the colors . It takes_up to three months to complete a reproduction . Because of the hour it takes_to set_up the machine and the time it takes_to dry , only about three colors can be put_on each day . Hedrick said the hardest part of her business is finding workers patient enough to endure the handiwork who also have an artistic sense . It takes technical skills and a good eye to do the work well .</TEXT>
