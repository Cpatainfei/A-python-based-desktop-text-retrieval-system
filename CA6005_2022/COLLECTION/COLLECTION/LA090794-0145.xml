   <HEADLINE> SINN FEIN LEADER , IRISH PREMIER IN 1ST MEETING ; ULSTER : HISTORIC TALKS FOCUS_ON IRA CEASE-FIRE . LONDON PARLEY BETWEEN MAJOR , PROTESTANT MILITANT ENDS IN ANGER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gerry Adams , the militant republican leader , had an unprecedented meeting Tuesday with Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds in Dublin to discuss the current cease-fire of the_Irish Republican Army . It was the first time a head of Sinn Fein , the political arm of the IRA , had ever met with an Irish prime_minister , and the contact provoked expressions of outrage among Protestant unionists . After the meeting , which John Hume , a Northern Irish Roman_Catholic moderate , also attended , the participants said they believed the cease-fire announced last Wednesday by the IRA will continue to hold . The three also committed themselves to resolving the 25-year sectarian war in Northern_Ireland by peaceful means . Reynolds defended his meeting with Adams , at which he shook the former revolutionary ' s hand , by declaring that no time should be wasted in maintaining the momentum toward peace . Adams , insisting that the current peace is holding , asked_in the meeting that the_British &quot; demilitarize &quot; Northern_Ireland by removing some or all_of their 17 # 000 troops on_duty in the province . As the two were conferring in the_Irish capital , Protestant militant Ian Paisley saw British Prime_Minister John Major at No . 10 Downing St . in London -- but the meeting broke_up in unusually rancorous terms after only a_few minutes . Paisley , a member of the_British Parliament who leads the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party , insisted on reading to Major a series of questions concerning the cease-fire -- and the_British position on it . Major asked Paisley whether he believed the_British government ' s assertions that it had not made a secret peace deal with the IRA . When Paisley refused to answer , the prime_minister dismissed him , suggesting he was not welcome at No . 10 unless he could accept Major ' s word . Paisley told reporters afterward that Major told him : &quot; I ' ll never talk to you again until you declare your belief that I speak the truth. &quot; Major insisted that he would abide_by the language of the Downing Street Declaration , which he and Reynolds signed_in December , calling_for all-party talks on a settlement in Northern_Ireland after a three-month cease-fire by the IRA . The accord says that the future of Northern_Ireland will be determined by a majority of voters inside the province -- a majority that is currently formed by the 57 % Protestant unionists , who want to remain under British rule . Major ' s treatment of Paisley is sure to unsettle the Protestant militants in Ulster , the Protestants ' favored word for Northern_Ireland . Paisley , like more moderate unionists , has been suspicious of the IRA cease-fire , believing that secret promises have been made to the_Irish republican militants that could compromise the unionists ' hold_on the province . And they are leery of any contacts between Britain , the_Irish government and the IRA before a three-month cease-fire period is completed . On Tuesday , David Trimble , deputy leader of the moderate Ulster Unionist Party , said the Dublin conference was held_in &quot; indecent , obscene haste. &quot; The British government , worried that it does not have a firm enough commitment to a &quot; permanent &quot; cessation of violence by the IRA , has been cautious about contacts with Sinn Fein . Reynolds opened a gap between Dublin and London on this issue by meeting with Adams on Tuesday but defended his act , saying : &quot; Why so soon ? It is never too soon to save a life. &quot; When an opportunity exists , negotiators must take_advantage of it , he said . Adams , for his part , called the Dublin meeting a &quot; historic day , the beginning of a new era. &quot; He said Major needed to &quot; grasp this opportunity &quot; for peace and not stand on ceremony or worry that the word &quot; permanent &quot; was not mentioned in last Wednesday ' s cease-fire statement . The IRA has observed the armistice since the cease-fire was declared , but the Protestant Ulster Volunteer Force , an outlawed paramilitary group , admitted killing one Northern_Ireland Catholic man and exploding a bomb in front of the Sinn Fein press office in West Belfast . Adams has said the IRA would not retaliate and instead hold to its promise of an indefinite cease-fire .</TEXT>
