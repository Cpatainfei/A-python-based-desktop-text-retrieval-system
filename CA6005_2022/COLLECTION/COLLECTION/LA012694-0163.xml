   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; TENT CITY MAY BE DAMP , BUT SENSE OF COMMUNITY PREVAILS ; SHELTER : QUAKE REFUGEES SAY THE NOISE OF RAIN IS COMFORTING -- AND HELPS DROWN OUT THE SNORING AND THE BABIES CRYING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You go_to_bed early when you sleep_in Tent City . It ' s like living_on a farm and turning_in with the chickens . Except this is Los Angeles , and the sound of the sirens and the chop of the copters overhead lull you into an uncomfortable repose . On Monday night at Reseda Park on Victory Boulevard , where a makeshift refugee camp housed about 500 earthquake victims , there was also the rain . It began shortly after dusk and fell_in gray needles throughout the long night , piercing the roofs of green canvas army tents , dripping down onto faces like the cruelest of water tortures . At its hardest , the rain swallowed even the wail of the anonymous sirens , its sledgehammer blows waking you up , making you feel the cold outside like an unwanted bedfellow , as though this were some urban camping trip gone terribly awry . But these were hardy souls , this gathering of working-class men and women -- most from Central_American_countries such_as El_Salvador , Guatemala and Nicaragua -- pious people who stared unflinchingly at the ink-stained skies and gave_thanks for what little they had left . &quot; Actually , I don ' t mind the rain , &quot; said Leticia Lopez , 41 , a nurse ' s assistant from El_Salvador . Under the bright lights of a soccer field , she slept_in an oblong tent with 17 others , most of them relatives who , like her , had been driven by the temblor from their nearby apartments . &quot; It ' s a downpour , but it has a nice rhythm and it helps me go_to_sleep . It drowns_out the sounds of the babies crying and the men snoring . that ' s the worst sound of all , that snoring . You can hear it in your nightmares. &quot; The helpers -- National_Guard soldiers , Red_Cross workers and wide-eyed volunteers who showed_up here offering a hand -- searched for words to describe this collection of 40 tents . Summer_camp in the wintertime , some said . Family boot camp . Or some water-logged Purgatory . But there were brighter images . &quot; It ' s like a community campground you see along the freeway , &quot; said Jim Alexander , a first_lieutenant with the National_Guard -- the unofficial police_chief of some 70 Guard troops who help supply security here . &quot; They don ' t need us here as policemen . These people are taking_care of themselves . I ' ve seen it happen before . When a crisis occurs , instead of causing problems , people pitch_in and help . People do. &quot; This Tent City , like the others , did not exist a_few days ago . People appeared in droves at the Reseda Park Recreation Center the morning the quake hit . They slept under trees , cooked meals in the public grills , set_up pup_tents . But it was not until Saturday , when the National_Guard moved_in , that this bustling city took_form . The soldiers used mallets to drive the wooden stakes into the ground and string_up the tents , many of which had been used during the Korean_War -- tents they said a prayer would hold_up amid the oncoming wind and rain . Some did . Others leaked like jailhouse roofs , turning the grass floors of these temporary living quarters into a mud-and-water cocktail . But few complained . Speaking Spanish in quick bursts , they moved their Red Cross-issue cots to another corner of the tent and went_back to sleep , listening silently to the rain . Still , in the middle of the night , there were patrols to count heads and take_stock of the water damage . Their flashlights darting about the park , the beams capturing the full force of the drizzle , Red_Cross center manager Liz Dewar and Tom Murotake , a National_Guard staff_sergeant out of Long_Beach , walked the squishy grounds on night patrol . She is the wife of a San Bernardino County pastor . He is a family_man . But on this night , they were soldiers of ill-fortune . Their beams moved across the sleeping faces . The cots were lined_up barracks-style in tents that smelled of musty canvas and waterlogged clothing . Other cots were clumped together in family groups , a baby_carriage or child ' s truck here , a wrinkled suit on a hanger there . At times , you could see the mist as their hot breath hit the early morning chill and you knew their noses , hands and feet were cold to the touch . The leakiest tents were abandoned . In the end , the Guard troops shook their heads . &quot; Some of these tents have been around for a long , long_time , &quot; Murotake said , hurrying to get_in out of the rain . &quot; Tomorrow , when the weather turns , we ' ll fix ' em up real good with epoxy. &quot; The coffee and the diapers , like everything else here , were free . After completing a form , new residents were issued a cot , blankets and a Red_Cross comfort kit containing essentials such_as toothpaste and shampoo . But the promise of something for nothing brought opportunists . Scores of cots were lost to people who showed_up at the park , collected their handouts and walked_off . There was the woman who demanded a red cot , not a green one , and then disappeared as quickly as she had come . By Monday night , armed soldiers were stationed inside two tents that held enough supplies to feed an army . &quot; Some guys were coming_in here with camouflage pants , saying they were Guardsmen , &quot; said Valsin Francois , holding an M-16 rifle . &quot; But they didn ' t fool me . They didn ' t have name tags. &quot; Then there was the phone fiasco . On Saturday , two telephone_companies supplied a block of a dozen phones for earthquake victims to call worried relatives back home -- anywhere in the world -- free_of charge . The mistake , volunteers say , was that the phones were at first placed along busy Victory Boulevard . Soon , news of the free calls rumbled through the neighborhoods . &quot; People were coming_in by the busloads , &quot; said volunteer Steve Novak , who flew to the San Fernando Valley from New York City after hearing about the quakes . &quot; People were calling Iran and Pakistan and India. &quot; Murotake said : &quot; I saw a guy with a phone_book where all_the names were in Arabic . There was a woman , some marketing representative , making her calls all around the country . It was , like , out of control. &quot; At one point , a fight broke_out between two men arguing over the length of a call . The police were summoned and the phones were moved near the office and restricted to use by National_Guard troops . But there were selfless acts of charity , too . On Saturday , well before the warehouse of Red_Cross supplies arrived , people appeared with donations . A woman brought 100 homemade sandwiches . Another produced 200 meals purchased at a McDonald ' s . Still another brought food for stranded pets . Indian food arrived from Beverly Hills , clothing from San Diego . &quot; At one point these lawyers and hairdressers from Orange County showed_up with a truckload of hot dogs and the Red_Cross was saying , ' Get_it out of here ' and an LAPD cop on the scene was insisting that they be fed to people . They were really going at it , &quot; said Lorin Ginsberg , a volunteer emergency medical technician . Then there was the mountain of ice -- hundreds of bags piled_up on the grass near the tennis_courts like some mound of melting snow . No volunteer could remember where the ice had come from . Or what they were going_to do with it . Despite the glitches , a family atmosphere has grown in this Tent City and others like it : Volunteers have bummed cigarettes from Guard troops , then bought them small gifts in return . Addresses have been exchanged . And embraces . One day , a rap band showed_up unannounced and performed a free concert . Early Tuesday , a woman and her 8-year-old son offered a bed for the night to a teen-ager shivering in a thin blue blanket . And then there is the goose that playfully chases the children every morning . And the little boy with the bow_and_arrow who walks up_to the soldiers and says , &quot; Hey soldier , where ' s your gun ? &quot; One night , while Sgt . 1st_Class Louis Ortiz played his harmonica for a group of people , a woman approached and said that in her country , people ran in fear from men in uniforms . &quot; She had tears in her eyes , &quot; he said . But the sense of community has its limitations . Not everyone abides by rules against alcohol or public urination . Some husbands complain that other men gawk at their wives . Then there are the crying babies . And sometimes the stench from the nearby public outhouses wafts through the tents like a bad breeze . In the sick bay , several children screamed as they were treated for chickenpox . Their parents complained of headaches , colds or diarrhea . One resident said a cockroach had crawled into his ear while he slept . He screamed in agony as workers struggled to extract the bug , grinding his teeth and praying aloud . Finally , with the bug in_sight , the medical team was forced to give_up and send him to a hospital . At 3 a.m. Tuesday , Tent City ' s command center is like some near-deserted Army outpost . Deserted Jeeps are parked chaotically . With the lights dimmed since 10 p.m. , the generator ' s steady hum is no longer heard , nor are the voices that once chattered inside the tents in the darkness . The dawn would come slowly , almost imperceptibly , with the geese that populate the park honking like drill sergeants . One by one , wrapped in blankets and wool caps , the residents emerged from their shelters . They built fires , made breakfast and stomped their feet to stay warm . The brave ones splashed cold water on their faces , trying to come_alive and face another day . Some would go_off to work . Others would play a waiting game . Waiting for repairs_to their damaged homes . Waiting for better weather , for better times . Waiting for night to come again in Tent City .</TEXT>
