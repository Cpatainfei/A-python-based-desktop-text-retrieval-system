   <HEADLINE> COUNCILMAN TO DONATE $ 11 # 000 TO POLICE ; POLITICS : HAL BERNSON IS WORKING TO ESTABLISH A FUND FOR OFFICERS AFTER BEING ORDERED TO REPAY A LAUNDERED CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson responded to an order by the city ' s Ethics Commission to repay $ 11 # 000 in laundered campaign contributions , saying Thursday he will donate the money to police in his district . Bernson instructed city officials Wednesday to establish a fund for police in the Devonshire Division , and said he also will give police $ 5 # 000 from a 5 % salary increase that he and other local elected officials are scheduled to receive this year . The $ 11 # 000 in contributions came from Evergreen American Corp. , a giant shipping firm that admitted last year to illegally funneling $ 172 # 000 in contributions to state and local officials through employees , relatives and friends . Campaign laws require that the sources of all contributions be disclosed so that the public can determine where the money originated . Bernson ' s donation appears to have satisfied the Ethics Commission ' s request for repayment of the money . Mimi Strauss , chief of enforcement for the commission , said she only received a copy of Bernson ' s letter explaining his donation idea on Thursday but believes it will satisfy the commission . &quot; Our preliminary view is that ( the donation ) complies with the Ethics Commission ' s request , &quot; she said . Several other city and state officials who also received illegal contributions from Evergreen have repaid the money . Only Bernson and former Mayor Tom Bradley rejected the Ethics Commission ' s request . Bernson has argued that he should be allowed to keep the money because he received it not knowing that it had been improperly donated . And he has rejected the commission ' s authority to order him to repay the money . &quot; What it amounts to is punishing someone for something they are innocent_of , &quot; he said . But in an effort to &quot; show good_faith to the people , &quot; Bernson said he will raise $ 11 # 000 and donate it to police in his district to be used however police decide . He said he sent a letter to the commission explaining his idea . &quot; We are just prioritizing that money , &quot; he said . &quot; We think that there is a greater need in police. &quot;</TEXT>
