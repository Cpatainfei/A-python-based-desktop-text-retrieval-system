   <HEADLINE> LANCASTER OWNER FIGHTS TO GET PIG_OUT OF THE PEN , BACK IN THE HOUSE ; ORDINANCES : RESIDENT HAD TO PUT HER POTBELLIED PETS OUT TO PASTURE , BUT THE CITY HAS AGREED TO LOOK INTO ALLOWING THE ANIMALS TO LIVE IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Padding around a livestock pen in rural Kern County , Black Jack , a 2-year-old Vietnamese potbellied pig , is homesick . * He squeals in protest when his owner , Laraine Schubert , steps_out of the pen and heads_home to Lancaster . Schubert says she would like nothing better than to take the black-haired , 110-pound animal back to her house , where Black Jack and a second pig , Bubbles , grew_up . But there ' s a problem : City code enforcement officers ordered Schubert in March to get_rid_of her pets because it is illegal to keep farm_animals in a residential_area . To comply , Schubert moved Black Jack and Bubbles out_to a friend ' s ranch near Rosamond . She gave Bubbles to the family at the ranch , but she has been working in recent weeks to bring Black Jack back . To that end , she has urged city officials to change the law , insisting that potbellied pigs should be recognized as house pets . And she has vowed to keep lobbying until the law is changed -- and Black Jack can come_home . &quot; I ' m not giving_up , &quot; she said . &quot; He ' s like a child to me. &quot; * Last week , at Schubert ' s request , the Lancaster City_Council instructed the city staff to look_into the legalization of potbellied pigs and to review the_matter with the Planning_Commission . The issue then will be returned to the City_Council , possibly as early as July . Although a final vote is months away , council_members said they are leaning toward granting pet status to the small pigs . Mayor Frank Roberts said his niece raises potbellied pigs and boasts that they are brighter than dogs . Councilman George Runner said he sympathizes_with Schubert and other fans of potbellied pigs . &quot; They want to bring_home the bacon , &quot; Runner quipped . Lancaster ' s debate is similar to others that have occurred in many Southern California cities since the small pigs , which originated_in China , became popular in the United States over the last decade . Initially , the animals cost thousands of dollars and were often purchased by people who merely wanted to show_off an exotic pet . More recently , however , the pigs have proliferated ; their value as a status symbol has slipped ; their price has dropped to as little as $ 250 , and they have found their way into the homes of less affluent animal lovers . * These owners argue that their animals are pets , but city laws usually mandate that pigs belong in a barnyard -- not a housing tract . Last year , city officials in Oxnard and Glendale forced owners of potbellied pigs to get_rid_of their animals . Actor Luke Perry of TV ' s &quot; Beverly Hills 90210 &quot; had to get a special permit to keep three of the animals at his Tarzana home . But some cities , including Burbank , Beverly Hills and Monterey Park , allow residents to keep potbellied pigs as pets . In 1992 , Los Angeles County supervisors voted to allow the pigs in unincorporated residential_areas . The county law restricts owners to one pig per household . The animal must be spayed or neutered , wear license tags and obey the same leash law that applies to dogs . The pig can stand no taller than 20 inches at the shoulder and weigh no more_than 120 pounds . It cannot be any longer than 40 inches from the tip of its snout to the end of its buttocks . Lancaster officials may use the county law as a starting point in drafting the city ' s own potbellied-pig rules . Nearby Palmdale also may change its laws to allow the pigs in residential_areas , but the issue is not expected to come_before the City_Council until late this year . Jan Carroll , who breeds potbellied pigs at Society Swine , her farm in Leona Valley , hopes these cities will be even more flexible than the county and allow two pigs per household -- for socializing , not breeding . * &quot; Animals are happier when they have somebody to talk to , &quot; she said . Carroll , who began breeding the pigs more_than three years ago , believes they make ideal pets . &quot; They don ' t bark , they don ' t have fleas , they don ' t shed , &quot; she explained . &quot; They sleep from dusk until dawn . . . . They don ' t attack neighbor children . They don ' t jump fences and indiscriminately breed like dogs and cats . So you don ' t have pound pigs ! &quot; One drawback , she admits , is that pigs do not make_good guard animals . &quot; They ' re absolutely useless for burglar protection . They ' ll show the burglar where the jewels are. &quot; Before she was cited for keeping Black Jack , Schubert says , she often walked him through her neighborhood without causing any kind of uproar . She believes an acquaintance who held a personal grudge -- not one of her neighbors -- reported her pigs to the city . Schubert said she is determined to change the law so that she can walk Black Jack through the neighborhood again . &quot; I ' ve always loved pigs , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' ve always thought that pigs were cute. &quot;</TEXT>
