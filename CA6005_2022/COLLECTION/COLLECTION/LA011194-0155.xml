   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; UKRAINE ACCORD RESTS_ON HOPE , NOT CONFIDENCE ; ARMS : PACT RELIES HEAVILY ON KRAVCHUK ' S ASSURANCE HE CAN DELIVER DESPITE OPPOSITION IN HIS PARLIAMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The agreement announced by President Clinton to peacefully dismantle Ukraine ' s huge nuclear arsenal will be a diplomatic triumph for both Russia and the United States -- if it works . But no one , including the U.S. officials who negotiated it , is sure that it will . The agreement would erase the world ' s third-largest nuclear arsenal , more_than 1 # 800 warheads that posed a long-term threat to Russia , the United States and much of Europe . But whether Ukraine actually carries_out the deal rests_on hope more_than confidence . At this point , the pact includes no timetable that commits Ukraine to giving_up its weapons by a specific final deadline . And it relies heavily on the personal assurance of one man , Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk , that he can deliver it despite determined opposition from the nationalists who form a majority in his Parliament . &quot; The United States has brokered a good_deal in which everybody wins , &quot; said Bruce Blair , a nuclear_weapons expert at Washington ' s Brookings Institution . &quot; It is premature to celebrate , however . Ukraine in particular has signed agreements along these lines before -- and has broken the promises. &quot; U.S. officials acknowledge those problems but argue that this is one case in which an imperfect agreement is better than no agreement at all . &quot; What ' s important is that we get a process going , &quot; said a senior State_Department official who helped negotiate the pact . U.S. officials argue that once Ukraine begins dismantling nuclear_weapons -- and begins collecting more Western economic aid in return -- sentiment in Kiev will swing toward continuing the job . The three-way agreement , which Clinton , Kravchuk and Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin are to sign_in Moscow on Friday , requires Ukraine formally to &quot; eliminate &quot; all nuclear_weapons on its territory . In return , Ukraine will receive nuclear fuel for its civilian power_plants , debt relief from Russia , a promise of new economic aid from the United States and renewed security assurances from both big powers . The nuclear fuel , worth about $ 1 billion , will represent the energy equivalent of the weapons-grade uranium that Kiev is giving_up . Under the pact , Ukraine ' s warheads will be shipped to Siberia , where Russian technicians will extract the highly enriched uranium and turn it into less powerful civilian reactor fuel . The pact could also lead to a doubling of U.S. economic aid to Ukraine , from $ 155 million this year to $ 310 million , the White_House said . The United States has also offered at least $ 175 million to help pay the actual cost of dismantling the nuclear_weapons . If Ukraine fails to keep its promises , officials noted , the Administration could respond by withholding much of that aid . As for security assurances , the United States and Russia will declare their respect for Ukraine ' s existing borders and its right to independence from military or economic coercion . Russia ' s declaration of respect for Ukraine ' s borders is intended in part to meet a longstanding Ukrainian concern : the demand of Russian nationalists for the return of the Crimean Peninsula , which was Russian territory before it was transferred to Ukraine in 1954 . Nevertheless , Ukrainian nationalists in Kiev lost no time in attacking the pact on Monday night . &quot; This is an economic crime , because we ' re giving_away pure gold and getting_back ore , &quot; complained Yuri Kostenko , Ukraine ' s environmental minister and deputy chairman of the Parliament ' s disarmament commission . Kostenko , a member of the majority that largely supports Kravchuk , predicted that the Parliament will demand the right to approve or disapprove the agreement -- a process that could leave the pact in limbo for months . To make life easier for Kravchuk , U.S. negotiators agreed to leave two key parts of the pact ambiguous , according to officials traveling with Clinton to the summit of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization in Brussels . One is the timetable . The pact does not fix a specific final deadline , because Kravchuk warned that it might anger the Parliament , one official said . Instead , it recommits Ukraine to observing the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty , which has a seven-year term -- but even that deadline is not mentioned explicitly . The other is the U.S. demand that Ukraine move quickly to dismantle its most dangerous nuclear_weapons , 46 long-range SS-24 missiles . Some Ukrainian nationalists want to keep the SS-24s as long as possible . So the pact does not mention the SS-24s but includes a less specific commitment to eliminate &quot; the most dangerous weapons &quot; first , an official said . The pact could cause trouble for Yeltsin in Russia ' s new Parliament as well . &quot; The growing voices of nationalism in Russia will resist relinquishing Russian claims on the Crimea , perhaps even on all_of Ukraine , &quot; noted Blair , citing the strength of ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky in Russia ' s parliamentary election last month . U.S. officials have been trying to pin Ukraine down on this kind of deal ever since 1991 , when the Soviet_Union disintegrated and left strategic nuclear_weapons scattered across four new countries -- Russia , Ukraine , Belarus and Kazakhstan . In 1992 , Kravchuk agreed in principle to give_up Ukraine ' s nuclear_weapons . But his Parliament , fearful of Russia and suspicious that Ukraine was being bilked of the weapons ' value , dug_in its heels . By last summer , Ukraine ' s economy was_on its knees , and Kravchuk wanted a deal . Ukrainian and Russian negotiators worked_out a swap of warheads for fuel , but they disagreed over the amount of compensation and the security guarantees that Ukraine wanted -- and called_on the United States for help . U.S. officials , led by special envoy Strobe Talbott and Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis , went_to work_on the issue in September . But each time a deal looked close it fell_apart -- usually because Ukraine ' s Parliament objected . In October , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher went all_the way to Kiev just to get Kravchuk ' s commitment to ratify the START treaty -- but a_few weeks later , Parliament added 13 conditions . By December , however , Kravchuk wanted to try again . Ukraine ' s economy was plummeting ; its inability to pay_for oil and gas from Russia forced households and offices to set their thermostats at 60 degrees . Moreover , the rise of Zhirinovsky raised the specter of a Russia that might use the nuclear issue as an excuse to dominate Ukraine once more . Two U.S. ideas helped bring_about the agreement , officials said . One was to strengthen the security assurances for Ukraine by having the United States and Russia reaffirm their commitment to secure borders under the 1975 Helsinki accord . The other was to bring_in a U.S. agency , the United States Enrichment Corp. , to advance the money for an initial shipment of nuclear fuel rods to Ukraine . Times special correspondent Mary Mycio in Kiev , and staff writers Richard Boudreaux in Moscow and Norman Kempster in Washington , contributed to this report .</TEXT>
