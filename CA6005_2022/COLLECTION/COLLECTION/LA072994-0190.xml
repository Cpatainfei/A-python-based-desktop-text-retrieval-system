   <HEADLINE> UCI SCIENTISTS LOCATE GENE FOR DWARFISM ; RESEARCH : PRENATAL TESTING COULD IDENTIFY BABIES WITH A CONDITION THAT LEADS TO DEATH QUICKLY AFTER BIRTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> UC Irvine researchers announced Thursday that they have identified the gene that causes the most common form of dwarfism , called achondroplasia , the latest discovery in the controversial field of prenatal diagnosis . Molecular biologist John Wasmuth said the discovery will allow physicians to determine whether a fetus has the most severe type of achondroplasia . That form is invariably fatal shortly after birth . With this information , he said , parents will know whether a child will be born healthy . &quot; It should be a relief to parents , &quot; Wasmuth said during his announcement at the Chemical Research_Center at UC Irvine . Achondroplasia , which affects one in every 20 # 000 people , causes alterations in bone growth and development , resulting in an enlarged head , a normal torso and short limbs . A gene test could be conducted after an ultrasound indicated that the child would be a dwarf , Wasmuth said . Although children who inherit only one achondroplasia gene are generally healthy , those who inherit two copies die in infancy . If both parents have a copy of the gene , each of their children has a one-in-four chance of inheriting two copies and dying as a result . The researchers ' discovery of the gene will thus enable doctors to determine whether a fetus has one or two copies . Wasmuth , who was also a member of the teams that discovered the genes for Huntington ' s disease and for colon_cancer , said doctors now will be able to tell within the first 10 to 12 weeks of gestation if a child with achondroplasia will be healthy . * Tina Schafnitz , the 5-foot-11-inch mother of a 4-year-old boy with achondroplasia , said the hardest part of her pregnancy was not knowing whether her child would live past the birth . &quot; What is important is that more parents will choose to keep their children , &quot; she said . &quot; There is a lot of relief involved , especially knowing the child would have normal intelligence and little to no medical problems. &quot; Schafnitz said she remembers doctors giving her a thumbs up sign when her son , Alex , was born healthy . &quot; Every day Alex asks me ( if he ) can get a brother just like him , &quot; she said . Some critics argue that because of such advances in prenatal diagnosis , more parents will choose abortion if told early in the pregnancy that their babies will have some form of birth_defect . &quot; We are severely concerned , since it happened in World_War_II , &quot; said David Brookfield , district director of Little People of America . &quot; Hitler wanted everyone to be blond-haired and blue-eyed. &quot; Brookfield warned that &quot; If it was happening in the 40s with limited testing , &quot; there is an even greater possibility today that society could &quot; eliminate differences we have in the world. &quot; Actor Billy Barty , founder of the Billy Barty Foundation , which serves as an education and advocacy group , said something special would be lost if there were no dwarfs . In fact , some of the world ' s most famous people were dwarfs , he said . &quot; You know who was a dwarf , although we don ' t like to talk_about it ? &quot; Barty asked . &quot; Attila the Hun. &quot;</TEXT>
