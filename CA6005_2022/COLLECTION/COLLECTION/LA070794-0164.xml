   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / QUARTERFINALS ; SPOTLIGHT ; VICTORY , ITALIAN STYLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Italians were dancing in the streets again late Tuesday night after Italy ' s defeat of Nigeria , which put Italy in the quarterfinals . In the front-page commentary of the Milan daily , Corriere della Sera , Gianfranco Teotino said , &quot; On the brink of the precipice , Italy had not been put_down by the modest Nigerian team of excellent athletes , robust kickers , and inexpert footballers , but primarily through its own fault , and then by some demented refereeing . . . . ( It was ) incredible , the expulsion of ( Gianfranco ) Zola , thrown_out 12 minutes after entering the field , for not having committed a foul. &quot; &quot; It ' s an Italy Which Is All Heart &quot; was the headline in the national sports daily , Gazzetta dello Sport , Italy ' s most-read sports daily . The Gazzetta ' s editorial was entitled , &quot; From Prison to Paradise , &quot; and started : &quot; Again in 10 against 11 , refereed by a crazy Mexican , who throws Zola out for a mysterious foul and has to see four goal kick fouls in_order to concede one , the Italian team creates one of the most exciting events of its history. &quot; La Gazzetta also collected comments from soccer enthusiasts and experts . Film director Franco Zeffirelli from Jerusalem , where he is working , said : &quot; Tonight I am really very proud to be Italian . This national team is making us suffer , but in the end it is repaying us for all our sufferings. &quot; &quot; Italian Team to Give You a Heart_Attack , &quot; was the headline of the Rome daily La Repubblica . The front-page comment by Gianni Mura from Boston , said victory came , &quot; Despite ( Coach Arrigo ) Sacchi and that referee . . . &quot; and referred to an &quot; ugly and useful victory , once more in 10 men against 11 , and then that small joy is disrupted by the news that in Italy , to celebrate , someone starts shooting and kills a child. &quot; A boy in Herculaneum , near Naples , took_out his father ' s illegally owned pistol and accidentally shot a 7-year-old cousin .</TEXT>
