   <HEADLINE> CLINTON CALLS D-DAY ' LEAST ORDINARY DAY OF CENTURY '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mr. ( Joseph ) Dawson , ( a highly decorated American D-day veteran ) , you did your men proud today . Gen . ( John M. ) Shalikashvili ( chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff ) , Mr. ( Walter ) Cronkite ( former CBS newsman ) , chaplain , distinguished leaders of our government , members of Congress , members of the armed_services , our hosts from France and most of all , our veterans , their families and their friends : In these last_days of ceremonies , we have heard wonderful words of tribute . Now we come_to this hallowed place that speaks , more_than anything else , in silence . Here on this quiet plateau , on this small piece of American soil , we honor those who gave their lives for us 50 crowded years ago . Today , the beaches of Normandy are calm . If you walk these shores on a summer ' s day , all you might hear is the laughter of children playing_on the sand , or the cry of sea_gulls overhead , or perhaps the ringing of a distant church_bell . The simple sounds of freedom barely breaking the silence . Peaceful sounds . Ordinary sounds . But June 6 , 1944 , was the least ordinary day of the 20th Century . On that chill dawn , these beaches echoed with the sounds of staccato gunfire , the roar of aircraft , the thunder of bombardment . And through the wind and the waves came the soldiers , out of their landing_craft and into the war , away from their youth and toward a savage place many of them would , sadly , never leave . They had come_to free a continent -- the Americans , the_British , the Canadians , the Poles , the_French Resistance , the Norwegians and others . They had all come_to stop one of the greatest forces of evil the world has ever known . As news of the invasion broke , back home_in America , people held their breath . In Boston , commuters stood reading the news on the electric sign at South Station ; in New York , the Statue_of_Liberty , its torch blacked_out since Pearl_Harbor , was lit at sunset for 15 minutes ; and in Newcastle , Pa. , a young mother named Polly Elliot wrote to her husband , Frank , a corporal in the Army , &quot; D-day has arrived . The first thought of all_of us was a prayer. &quot; Below us are the beaches where Cpl . Elliot ' s battalion and so many other Americans landed -- Omaha and Utah , proud names from America ' s heartland , part of the biggest gamble of the war , the greatest crusade , yes , the longest day . During those first hours on bloody Omaha , nothing seemed to go right . Landing_craft were ripped apart by mines and shells ; tanks sent to protect them had sunk , drowning their crews ; enemy fire raked the invaders as they stepped into chest-high water and waded past the floating bodies of their comrades . And as the stunned survivors of the first wave huddled behind the seawall , it seemed the invasion might fail . Hitler and his followers had bet_on it . They were sure the Allied soldiers were soft , weakened by liberty and leisure , by the mingling of races and religion . They were sure their totalitarian youth had more discipline and zeal . But then something happened . Although many of the American troops found themselves without officers , on unfamiliar ground , next to soldiers they didn ' t know , one by one they got_up . They inched forward and together , in groups of threes and fives and tens , the sons of democracy improvised and mounted their own attacks . At that exact moment , on these beaches , the forces of freedom turned the tide of the 20th Century . These soldiers knew that staying_put meant certain death . But they were also driven by the voice of free_will and responsibility nurtured in Sunday_schools , town_halls and sandlot ballgames -- the voice that told them to stand_up and move forward , saying , &quot; You can do_it . And if you don ' t , no one else will. &quot; And as Capt . Joe Dawson led his company up this bluff , and as others followed his lead , they secured a foothold for freedom . Today , many of them are here among us . Oh , they may walk with a little less spring in their step , and their ranks are growing thinner , but let us never forget , when they were young , these men saved the world . And so let us now ask them , all_the veterans of the Normandy campaign , to stand if they can and be recognized . The freedom they fought for was no abstract concept . It was the stuff of their daily lives . Listen to what Frank Elliot had written to his wife from the embarkation point in England : &quot; I miss hamburgers a la Coney_Island , American beer a la Duquesne , American shows a la Penn Theater , and American girls a la you. &quot; Pauline Elliot wrote back on June 6th as she and their 1-year-old daughter listened on the radio : &quot; Little Daronda is the only one not affected by D-day news . I hope and pray she will never remember any of this , but only the happiness of the hours that will follow her daddy ' s homecoming step_on the porch. &quot; Well , millions of our GIs did return home from that war to build_up our nation and enjoy life ' s sweet pleasures , but on this field there are 9 # 386 who did not -- 33 pairs of brothers ; a father and his son ; 11 men from tiny Bedford , Va. , and Cpl . Frank Elliot , killed near these bluffs by a German shell on D-day . They were the fathers we never knew , the uncles we never met , the friends who never returned , the heroes we can never repay . They gave us our world . And those simple sounds of freedom we hear today are their voices speaking_to us across the years . At this place , let us honor all_the Americans who lost their lives in World_War_II . Let us remember as well that over 40 million human_beings from every side perished -- soldiers on the field_of_battle , Jews in the ghettos and death camps , civilians ravaged by shellfire and famine . May God give rest to all their souls . Fifty years later , what a different world we live_in . Germany , Japan and Italy , liberated by our victory , now stand among our closest allies and the staunchest defenders of freedom . Russia , decimated during the war and frozen afterward in communism and Cold_War , has been reborn in democracy . And as freedom rings from Prague to Kiev , the liberation of this continent is nearly complete . Now the question falls to our generation . How will we build_upon the sacrifice of D-day ' s heroes ? Like the soldiers of Omaha Beach , we cannot stand_still . We cannot stay safe by doing so . Avoiding today ' s problems would be our own generation ' s appeasement , for just as freedom has a price , it also has a purpose , and its name is progress . Today our mission is to expand freedom ' s reach farther , to tap the full potential of each of_our_own citizens , to strengthen our families , our faith and our communities , to fight indifference and intolerance , to keep our nation strong and to light the lives of those still dwelling in the darkness of undemocratic rule . Our parents did that , and more . We must do nothing less . They struggled in war so that we might strive in peace . We know that progress is not inevitable , but neither was victory upon these beaches . Now , as then , the inner voice tells us to stand_up and move forward . Now , as then , free_people must choose . Fifty years ago , the first Allied soldiers to land here in Normandy came not from the sea but from the sky . They were called pathfinders , the first paratroopers to make the jump . Deep in the darkness , they descended upon these fields to light beacons for the airborne assault that would soon follow . Now , near the dawn of a new century , the job of lighting those beacons falls to our hands . To you who brought us here , I promise we will be the new pathfinders , for we are the children of your sacrifice . Thank_you , and God bless you all . * TimesLink : 808-8463 TimeLink features historic D-day recordings of British Gen .
