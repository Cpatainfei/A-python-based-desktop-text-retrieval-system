   <TEXT> Northern Yemeni forces bombarded the besieged southern stronghold of Aden , reportedly killing at least 36 people , as 900 foreigners who fled the city by ferry reached safety Friday in Africa . The heavy fighting came despite northern President Ali Abdullah Saleh ' s announced willingness to agree to a cease-fire.But five previous truces declared during the 6-week-old civil_war have failed within hours . The Kuwait News_Agency , which has a correspondent in Aden , said the 36 dead , most of them civilians , were among 170 casualties recorded in the shelling of Aden over the previous 36 hours . It said more deaths were expected . The north , which appeared to be tightening its noose around Aden , warned southern civilians to stay_away_from strategic targets . The civil_war erupted May 4 after the 4-year-old union of north and south collapsed amid feuding between Saleh and his former vice_president , Ali Salim Bidh , the southern leader . Northern forces hold most of the country . The 900 foreign evacuees included Americans , Britons , Tunisians and Palestinians , said Jean Francois Golay of the International Committee of the Red_Cross . The evacuees arrived in Djibouti aboard the 250-foot ferry Canadian Spirit after sailing 155 miles overnight across the Gulf of Aden .</TEXT>
