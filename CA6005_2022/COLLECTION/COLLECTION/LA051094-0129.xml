   <HEADLINE> GEORGE PEPPARD , VERSATILE ACTOR , DIES AT 65</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> George Peppard , the actor who first achieved prominence opposite Audrey Hepburn in the film &quot; Breakfast at Tiffany ' s &quot; and was_better known to modern audiences as the tough , cigar-chomping mercenary Hannibal Smith , leader of television ' s &quot; The A-Team , &quot; has died . He was 65 . Peppard , who underwent successful surgery for lung_cancer two years ago , died Sunday night of pneumonia at UCLA Medical_Center . Publicist Cheryl Kagan said that Peppard ' s cancer had been in_remission since a tumor was removed from his right lung , but that he entered the hospital Thursday with breathing problems that developed_into pneumonia . A longtime heavy drinker and smoker , Peppard abandoned alcohol in 1978 and kicked his two-pack-a-day cigarette habit after the lung surgery in 1992 . Known as difficult in his professional and personal life , the versatile actor suffered long periods of unemployment and four divorces , two from actress Elizabeth Ashley , whom he met while filming &quot; The Carpetbaggers. &quot; &quot; Getting_married and having a bad divorce is just like breaking your leg . The same leg , in the same place , &quot; joked the tall , ruggedly handsome Peppard a_few years ago . &quot; I ' m lucky I don ' t walk with a cane. &quot; Peppard proved as pragmatic as he was outspoken . Although he originally disparaged the small screen in favor of films , he achieved his widest success and perhaps greatest pleasure starring in three NBC television series -- as the Polish American detective &quot; Banacek &quot; from 1972 to 1974 , as a neurosurgeon on &quot; Doctors ' Hospital &quot; from 1975 to 1976 , and as the Vietnam veteran colonel on &quot; The A-Team &quot; from 1983 to 1987 . &quot; I ' m concentrating_on big-screen roles . . . . ( I ) turned_down two television series , &quot; he told The Times in 1961 . &quot; In a series you don ' t have time to develop a character . There ' s no buildup ; in the first segment you ' re already established , with absolutely no background. &quot; Peppard appeared in more_than 25 films after making his debut in &quot; The Strange One &quot; in 1957 . But his first were the best -- &quot; Pork Chop Hill &quot; in 1959 , &quot; Home From the_Hill &quot; in 1960 , his role as the writer supporting Hepburn ' s Holly Golightly in &quot; Tiffany ' s &quot; in 1961 , &quot; How the West Was Won &quot; in 1962 and &quot; The Carpetbaggers &quot; in 1964 . Although he appeared with the superstars -- Gregory Peck , Robert Mitchum , James Stewart , John Wayne -- he never became one himself . &quot; I don ' t know of one good actor who hasn ' t gone_to hell when he got big enough , &quot; he raged to syndicated columnist Hedda Hopper in 1962 , although he later conceded that he admired Stewart , Wayne and others when he got_to know them . &quot; When they start getting the million-dollar salary and the percentage , they start doing everything except what they ' re equipped for -- they start producing and directing. &quot; But a decade later , Peppard ate those words , telling a Santa Monica court he was giving_up acting in favor of directing and producing in_order to make enough money for alimony payments . His greatest effort proved to be the 1979 film &quot; Five Days From Home , &quot; which he wrote , produced , directed and starred in . Peppard employed family members , including his third wife , actress Sherry Boucher , and managed to market the film independently to some critical praise but little financial success . Conceding that television wasn ' t so bad after all , he made the pilot for &quot; Dynasty &quot; in the role of the patriarch -- only to be ousted in favor of John Forsythe . Peppard went_through several years in which he joked that he &quot; couldn ' t get arrested , &quot; much less find work . Then , with the tough-guy stereotype he always attributed to his role as a megalomaniacal tycoon in &quot; Carpetbaggers , &quot; Peppard was tapped for leader of &quot; The A-Team , &quot; which he came_to rate as the best role of his career . &quot; I thought the pilot was terrific , &quot; he told The Times shortly after the series debuted in 1983 . &quot; I realized the role would give me the chance to do the sort of thing I ' ve never been allowed to do_in movies . I mean , I get_to disguise myself as a Chinese person , a Skid_Row drunk , a gay hairdresser -- I wanted to change from leading man to character_actor for years now but have never been given the chance before. &quot; He remained delighted with the series , which spawned a popular live-action show at Universal Studios amusement_park , well after it ended . &quot; It ' s the first time I ever had money in the bank , &quot; he said in 1990 . &quot; It was a giant boost to my career , and made me a viable actor for other roles. &quot; Among those roles was that of a World_War_II British secret_service agent in the 1990 television miniseries &quot; Night of the Fox. &quot; He also returned to the stage , appearing in &quot; Love_Letters &quot; in London and &quot; The Lion in Winter &quot; in West Palm Beach , Fla. , where he met his fifth wife , Laura . Most recently , he appeared in the March 3 episode of the television series &quot; Matlock. &quot; Born in Detroit , Peppard was educated at Purdue University and the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh , then studied at the Actors Studio in New York . In the 1950s , he worked in the Oregon Shakespeare Festival , summer stock in New England , New York-based television dramas and such Broadway plays as &quot; The Pleasure of His Company. &quot; Peppard earned a star on Hollywood ' s Walk of Fame and served as grand marshal for the annual Hollywood Christmas Parade in 1983 . In addition to his wife , he is survived by three children , Brad , Julie and Christian , and three grandchildren . The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the Lord ' s Place , P.O. Box 7117 , West Palm Beach , Fla . 33405 , which aids the homeless .</TEXT>
