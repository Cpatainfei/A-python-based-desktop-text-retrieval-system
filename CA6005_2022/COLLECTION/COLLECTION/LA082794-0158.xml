   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : ORANGE ; AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION URGED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The city has adopted a new plan that offers developers incentives to build affordable housing , part of an attempt to make 20 % of new homes accessible to low- and moderate-income people . The Affordable Housing Plan adopted by the City_Council last week &quot; promotes and encourages &quot; housing for people of modest means , rather than requiring builders to provide it.The plan ' s only compulsory clause requires developers of projects containing more_than 10 units to discuss affordable housing options with the city . In Orange County , a family of four earning less than $ 40 # 000 is considered low income and should spend no more_than $ 10 # 000 annually , or $ 850 per month , on housing . A family of four earning less than $ 29 # 000 per year is considered very low income in Orange County , according to the regulations . Council_members supported the plan but said they wanted the city to monitor income levels of occupants . &quot; Obviously , I strongly favor this plan , &quot; said Councilman Mark A . Murphy , who sat on the steering_committee for the program . &quot; This is a private sector plan for a public sector need. &quot; LESLEY WRIGHT</TEXT>
