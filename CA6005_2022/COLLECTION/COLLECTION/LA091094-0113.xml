   <HEADLINE> FUN COUPLES , RAUNCH ' N ' ROLL ; POP_MUSIC : THE MTV VIDEO MUSIC AWARDS HAS MORE CHEEK AND STAR POWER IN ITS RETURN TO NEW YORK . BUT IT IS STILL PLENTY TACKY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Oh , so now they get_it right . It figures that , after several years ' worth of increasingly dull MTV Video Music Awards ceremonies in Los Angeles -- shows that lived_up_to their hype primarily in the vulgarity department -- the move_back to New York ' s Radio City Music_Hall would produce a telecast Thursday night that was cheeky , cocky , catty and heavyweight-studded enough that you might have actually wished to have been there . Or , as one of the Beastie Boys said , heavily disguised and unexpectedly charging the podium at a moment when R.E.M. was supposed to be accepting an award , &quot; I just want to tell everyone that this is a farce . . . . &quot; Exactly . And , this time , an almost thoroughly absorbing one . Not that it was the slightest bit less tacky than the less watchable telecasts of recent years . Setting the tone and grossly funny almost in spite of her arbitrarily timed gag readings was Roseanne -- finally , a host as legitimately irreverent as they wanna be . But then , who would n ' t be a gas compared to party-pooping MTV Awards hosts of the past like retired perennial Arsenio Hall or especially last year ' s Christian Slater , who gave new meaning to the phrase &quot; money for nothing &quot; ? Squawked Roseanne , talking up the merits of Manhattan in her opening monologue : &quot; It ' s safe to walk the streets -- especially tonight , because a lot of the really dangerous criminals are backstage. &quot; Things kicked_off with this year ' s designated Pee-wee Moment ( and least well-kept secret in show_business ) : a brief , royalty-like appearance by Mr. and Mrs . Michael Jackson . &quot; Just think , nobody thought this would last , &quot; said Jackson . The former Lisa Marie Presley alternately squirmed like a trapped animal and smiled nervously before Michael engaged her in the most torrid clinch to burn_up the television screen since , well , his incendiary video smooch with Iman . After all_the buildup , the Jacksons ' awkward kickoff wasn ' t much to write Neverland about . But it was at least a setup for the show ' s best punch_line , nearly 3 1 / 2 hours later , when final presenter Madonna was escorted out on stage by sometimes-sparring-partner David Letterman and announced , &quot; And just think , nobody thought this would last. &quot; There was more gutter-sniping to go_around here than in a good episode of &quot; Melrose Place. &quot; In a battle of the singularly named Titans , Roseanne used her monologue to make a nasty crack about famously Republican VJ Kennedy providing special sexual services for Rush Limbaugh ; Kennedy generously returned the favor later on , and Roseanne served the vulgar volley back once more . Second-lowest shot : Comic Denis Leary asking his co-presenter , Naomi Campbell , &quot; So Naomi , are U2 up for an award this year ? &quot; -- referring to her ex-fiancee ' s ( bassist Adam Clayton ) band . Her blank expression hardly shifted , but the super-model was clearly super-peeved . It ' s long been commonly held that the performances are infinitely more significant than the trophies at MTV ' s annual blowout . Said truism still applies , but ' 94 may be the year in which it can finally be said that the cutting ad-libs have become more talked_about than the performances . This , despite the fact that the web has never before assembled such a pantheon of rock bigwigs to perform and that , although none of the resulting showcases was stunning , almost all_the live appearances were strong and flavorful . Best was a literally back-to-back presentation of Top 10 punk revivalists Green Day and the Beastie Boys . A short , furiously tight number by the Green party -- replete with head-twitching , eye-bulging , gasket-like strumming and Billy Zoom stances -- ended with the revolving stage_set turning_to reveal the Beasties . The latter hip-hopsters were in their rock ' n ' roll band incarnation , and in suits , skinny ties and sunglasses , with Adam Horovitz goonily howling &quot; Sabotage &quot; like Jerry Lewis fronting the Reservoir Dogs . The Rolling Stones and Bruce Springsteen ranked highest on MTV ' s coup list , but didn ' t provide especially chat-worthy moments . Mick did a mighty job of pretending to still mean it , so perhaps it was having the Stones ' randy two-song set so soon after Aerosmith ' s opening number that made_it seem like deja_vu all_over again . And Bruce ' s &quot; Streets of Philadelphia &quot; isn ' t exactly a showcase for his live wares , nor its AIDS theme and somber tone exactly fitting for a telecast this determinedly classless . The weakest performance spot was Boyz II Men ' s reading of their No . 1 &quot; I ' ll Make_Love to You , &quot; which served to prove once more that unworthy couplets like &quot; Throw your clothes on the floor / I ' m gonna take my clothes off too , yeah &quot; become triply comic belted_out with gospel-style intensity and earnestness . But the little_girls understand . Continents away in every sense was a standout appearance by the ridiculous , bouffant-adorned Russian cover band the Leningrad Cowboys , with the 70-member Red Army Ensemble , doing an incongruous cast-of-thousands version of &quot; Sweet Home Alabama &quot; that was like a bad dream . This had to be nearly as confusing to the audience as Beastie Boy Adam Yauch rushing the stage -- disguised as an errant Swede -- during Michael Stipe ' s acceptance speech and uttering crazed ramblings . Poor Stipe -- whose &quot; Everybody Hurts &quot; video really did deserve the four professional-ballot awards it picked_up , and the three general-ballot ones that Aerosmith ' s &quot; Cryin ' &quot; won too -- didn ' t know what hit him . Neither did we , but in its own absurd and tasteless white-trash-takes-over-Art-Deco way , this year ' s show at least felt_like rock ' n ' roll . * THE WINNERS ARE : A listing of all_of Thursday night ' s MTV winners .
