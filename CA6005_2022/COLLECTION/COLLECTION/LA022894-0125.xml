   <TEXT> The Israeli government , shocked by last week ' s massacre of 48 Palestinians by an Israeli settler , Sunday ordered the detention of extremist Jewish leaders in the occupied West_Bank and the confiscation of their followers ' weapons . In actions unprecedented since Israel captured the West_Bank in 1967 , the Cabinet directed military commanders to apply to &quot; radical elements among Israeli residents &quot; of the region many of the same Draconian security measures that have been used against Palestinians there . &quot; We have taken these decisions knowing our responsibilities under international_law and under our own laws for the well-being of all residents of the territory , &quot; Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin declared , saying the army would arrest and hold_in preventive detention those believed to be a threat to security . Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat dismissed the moves as &quot; hollow and superficial. &quot; &quot; These are empty decisions which have no relation with the seriousness of the crime or with the basis of resolving it , &quot; said Arafat , who was in Tunis , Tunisia , to meet with Palestinian negotiators and determine the conditions under which the PLO would return to the peace table . But the U.S. State_Department praised the Israeli Cabinet ' s actions , calling them &quot; an important step toward assuring the security of Palestinians and in preventing the recurrence of such horrific acts of violence in the future. &quot; The Cabinet ' s decision , made after a heated debate , permits military commanders to bar Israelis from the West_Bank or to restrict their activities there . The ministers also called_for &quot; the disarmament of specific individuals &quot; among the settlers . In addition , the Cabinet ordered a state inquiry into the massacre . And it directed Atty . Gen . Michael Ben Yair to lay the legal groundwork for the outright banning of Kach , an extremist movement that seeks to drive all Arabs from the biblical land of Israel , and similar groups . Baruch Goldstein , the settler who carried_out the massacre at the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron on Friday , was a prominent member of Kach , an Israeli offshoot of the Jewish Defense League founded in the United States by the late Rabbi Meir Kahane . The Cabinet decisions constitute &quot; a fundamental shift , a real turning point &quot; in the government ' s relationship with the settler movement , according to a senior official who was present . &quot; There was a conviction that these people , and not just the most wild-eyed among the settlers , can bring disaster down upon the whole Jewish nation if they go too far , and the government must act decisively , here_and_now , to control things , &quot; the official said . &quot; The detention of the extremists , the restrictions on their supporters , the disarming of some of them and probably the banning of the most radical groups -- all this is very strong symbolism for Israelis . It is the loss of legitimacy for the settlers , and probably the beginning of the end of the settlement movement. &quot; Maj . Gen . Danny Yatom , the military commander of the West_Bank , immediately ordered the detention without trial of five leaders of the Kach movement for three months . The national Itim news_agency said two of the Kach activists were already detained . Two of the three who remained at_large appeared on national television to mock the authorities . About 30 more activists from Kach and its allied groups will be served with restriction orders , officials said . &quot; So far , we know he did_it on_his_own , &quot; Rabin said of Goldstein , who was beaten to death by worshipers who survived his fusillade during early morning_prayers at the Ibrahim Mosque in Hebron on Friday . &quot; But I am ashamed about others who came_up and publicly supported his act . . . . &quot; Goldstein tried not only to kill innocent Palestinians while they were praying in a holy_place , &quot; Rabin added , &quot; but he joined Hamas and Islamic Jihad ( Palestinian radicals ) in their common purpose of killing the peace negotiations. &quot; In an effort to quell the Arab anger over the Hebron massacre , the Cabinet moved_up by 10 days the release of 800 to 1 # 000 Palestinian prisoners who were to be freed in a traditional goodwill gesture marking the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan . Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer , a former general who had called_for tough measures to curb settler violence , said that extremists had to be prevented from using &quot; their own brand of terrorism &quot; to undermine peace talks with the Palestinians . &quot; The government is determined to reinforce and to speed the peace negotiations , and hopefully this will happen this week , &quot; Ben-Eliezer said . The United States has invited Israel and the PLO to Washington this week to resume negotiations on Israeli withdrawal from Jericho in the West_Bank and from the Gaza Strip . But the PLO has indicated the talks may be delayed . The Hebron massacre also had repercussions for the broader Mideast peace process , as negotiators from Syria , Jordan and Lebanon , acting in solidarity with the PLO , on Sunday withdrew their negotiators from separate talks with Israel . Israeli President Ezer Weizman , paying his condolences in Hebron on Sunday , appealed_to Palestinian leaders there not to allow the desire for revenge to overtake efforts to implement a peace agreement . &quot; We should , all Arabs and Israelis , show enough wisdom to control the situation and go_forward to a better life , &quot; Weizman told Hebron ' s elders . Although some ministers from the leftist Meretz Party wanted to go even further in the crackdown on Kach and similar groups , Rabin rejected demands for removing Israeli settlers entirely from Hebron , Kiryat Arba and other Palestinian population centers . &quot; The whole idea was that a series of decisions were taken that will allow . . . the security_forces and the legal authorities to do whatever is needed to achieve security for both Jewish and Arab people in the territories , &quot; Industry Minister Micha Harish said . The Council of Jewish Communities in Judea , Samaria and Gaza , the leading settlers group , criticized the government decisions as &quot; punishing Israeli citizens without a trial &quot; and putting some settlers at greater risk in the West_Bank and Gaza by confiscating their weapons . &quot; The pain and sorrow caused by Friday ' s attack do not warrant the endangering of the lives of all_the Jewish residents due_to the actions of one man , &quot; the group said . &quot; Making people more vulnerable is no way to calm the situation. &quot; Benjamin Netanyahu , leader of the opposition Likud Party , supported the crackdown on the extremists . &quot; They should be dealt with swiftly and very , very harshly , &quot; he said , adding that &quot; the overwhelming majority of settlers have acted very responsibly &quot; in the face of terrorist attacks against them . The Assn . for Civil Rights in Israel , the country ' s leading human_rights group , said the government had a duty to deter terrorism but described preventive detention as &quot; a particularly severe measure &quot; and urged that lesser measures , such_as house_arrest , be used where possible . Violent protests continued Sunday through much of the West_Bank and Gaza Strip and spread further within Israel . Four Palestinians were reported killed in clashes with troops , and an Israeli Arab was shot dead by police during rioting in the town of Rahat . In Hebron , about 2 # 000 Palestinians tried to enter the mosque where the massacre occurred , but were turned_back by troops . The Cabinet ordered the mosque and the synagogue at the Cave of the Patriarchs closed until new security measures are worked_out . Times researchers Dianna M . Cahn and Emily L . Hauser in Jerusalem contributed to this story .</TEXT>
