   <HEADLINE> IRAN BOMBS KURDISH BASE IN IRAQ ; 1 KILLED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Iranian warplanes bombed a Kurdish rebel base in northern Iraq on Wednesday , killing at least one person and wounding three . The opposition Democratic Party of Iranian Kurdistan said a civilian woman was killed and three rebels were wounded . Its statement gave no details of damage . Iran ' s official Islamic Republic News_Agency , monitored in Cyprus , said its pilots had attacked the &quot; command headquarters , munition depot and center of counterrevolutionaries. &quot; It was the second Iranian attack in three days on Iranian opponents in Iraq . The air strike was unlikely to draw Iraqi retaliation because both Iraq and Iran have been fighting Kurdish minorities that have sought autonomy for decades .</TEXT>
