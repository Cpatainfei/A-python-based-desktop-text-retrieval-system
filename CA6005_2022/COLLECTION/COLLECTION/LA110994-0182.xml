   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA SIGNALS IRAQ IS SET TO RECOGNIZE KUWAIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After a month of diplomatic pressure on Iraq , Russia indicated Tuesday that Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein is ready to accept a United Nations demand that Baghdad give formal and legal recognition to Kuwait . Word of the possible breakthrough came_after a two-hour meeting here , arranged at Iraq ' s request , between Tarik Aziz , the Iraqi deputy prime_minister , and Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev . If confirmed by Baghdad , the step could lead to a lifting of U.N. trade sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990 and would ease the tensions caused by sudden Iraqi troop movements toward Kuwait last month . A cautiously worded statement by the Russian Foreign Ministry said Aziz came here with a letter from Hussein to Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin &quot; on Iraq ' s recognition of Kuwait ' s sovereignty and borders under U.N. Security_Council Resolution 833. &quot; That resolution was adopted after Kozyrev ' s premature announcement Oct . 13 that Hussein would drop Iraq ' s claims to Kuwaiti territory . The Security_Council demanded that Hussein ' s decision be ratified into law by his Parliament , and the Iraqis balked . After meeting Tuesday with Aziz , Kozyrev rushed to the Kremlin to brief Yeltsin , who then ordered him to Baghdad today &quot; to take_part in completing the appropriate constitutional procedures &quot; demanded by the Security_Council , the Foreign Ministry said . There was some skepticism in Russia ' s foreign_policy Establishment that a deal is done . &quot; There is no need for Kozyrev to urgently fly to Iraq unless there are reservations and conditions put forth by Iraq , &quot; said Vyacheslav A . Nikonov , chairman of the Russian Parliament ' s international security subcommittee . And even if Iraq finally recognizes Kuwait , the United States has threatened to veto any easing of sanctions unless Hussein ' s regime meets U.N. restrictions on its weaponry and keeps its troops away from the border . &quot; Border recognition would meet only one of a number of requirements with which Iraq has not complied , &quot; State_Department spokesman David Johnson said Tuesday . The United States and Russia are often at_odds over Hussein , with Washington taking a hard line and Moscow urging an end to sanctions . Russia ' s bullish diplomacy is more_than an attempt to recover superpower influence in the Persian_Gulf ; Iraq owes Moscow $ 7 billion , mostly for weapons bought before the 1991 Gulf War . &quot; Our chances to get these dollars back will arise only when Iraq can sell oil , which means lifting the sanctions , &quot; Kozyrev said in a Russian TV interview aired Tuesday . But he also drew a parallel between Hussein and Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat . &quot; Two , three years ago we told our Western colleagues : Recognize Arafat , we need to show him the way_out , &quot; Kozyrev said . &quot; And see , they did move . And now he is not only not a terrorist but a Nobel Peace Prize winner. &quot;</TEXT>
