   <TEXT> Early one morning last December , a fisherman found Capt . Yin Ching-feng ' s body floating in the sea off Taiwan ' s northeastern coastline , a huge wound disfiguring his head . Investigators concluded that Yin had been murdered , and they soon found_out why : As chief of the arms procurement office for Taiwan ' s navy , he had threatened to expose a pattern of bribery in which arms dealers and retired Taiwan military officials , representing European companies , paid active-duty officers for help in winning weapons contracts . In the wake of the homicide , eight Taiwan naval officials have been arrested , and officers as high as former vice commander_in_chief have been implicated . Yin ' s murder underscores the intensity of competition here , and the growing importance of arms sales in the post-Cold War world , as the leading industrial powers battle for exports and contracts . Nowhere is that competition more fierce than in Taiwan , whose $ 87 billion in foreign_exchange reserves make_it one of the world ' s richest nations . Moreover , its government remains transfixed by the need to defend the island from invasion from the Chinese mainland . Selling advanced weaponry to such eager buyers as Taiwan has become an important element of foreign_policy for the United States and other industrial countries . Arms sales make_up a big part of post-Cold War dollar_diplomacy -- and franc , mark , lira , pound and ruble diplomacy too . Freed of the need to join ranks against the Soviet_Union and facing declining defense budgets at_home , U.S. and European defense companies are competing to sell warplanes and frigates , tanks and submarines . And their governments , having overcome whatever reluctance they might have had about spreading deadly conventional weapons around the world , are lending a helping hand . &quot; The Cold_War system ended , and the defense companies in the West faced shrinking defense budgets , &quot; said Ding Shou-chung , a prominent member of Taiwan ' s legislature . &quot; Their markets at_home were shrinking . Before , there were limits on selling weapons to Taiwan . But the companies pressured their governments to reduce the limits. &quot; While Yin ' s murder may be unique , the broader procurement scandal is not . South_Korea ' s armed forces , for example , have been in the midst of similar upheavals , beset by allegations of corruption and waste in contracts for foreign weapons_systems . The competition to sell arms has raised questions about whether governments such_as Taiwan ' s are being persuaded to buy more_than they need . &quot; I went_to France , and they received me royally , &quot; said Wei Yung , chairman of the Taiwanese legislature ' s foreign affairs committee . &quot; The Mirage is a beautiful aircraft . But it ' s too expensive . They cost $ 50 million apiece . . . . For every aircraft , you could start a new university on Taiwan. &quot; Taiwan is even being urged to buy new tanks , although it is an island whose only potential threat comes from the air or water . Taiwan ' s armed forces would probably either repel an invasion at the outset or lose the war . For decades , Taiwan relied almost entirely upon the United States for its arms . Military officials received U.S. supplies and training and even many perks that American officers enjoy . But in 1979 , the United States severed diplomatic ties and broke its mutual defense treaty with Taiwan . Throughout the 1980s , Taiwan coped and tried to diversify , but other countries were willing to sell it only a limited amount of military hardware . No one , including the United States , wanted to offend the People ' s Republic_of_China . In 1982 , President Ronald Reagan , whom Taiwan had considered its strongest friend in U.S. politics , signed a communique with Beijing in which the United States pledged to phase_out its arms sales to Taiwan , which had reached a high of $ 830 million in 1980 . Taiwan ' s star rose again as China ' s fell_in 1989 . After the deadly crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations at Tian An Men Square , Beijing ' s ties to Western countries became frosty , and governments in Europe and the United States imposed restrictions on military sales to China . &quot; Tian An Men gave Western countries the excuse to have a freer hand &quot; in selling arms to Taiwan , one Taiwan defense source said . And , he noted , Taiwan ' s ability to buy arms overseas was given an even bigger boost by the breakup of the Warsaw Pact and the disintegration of the Soviet_Union , which reduced the market for advanced weaponry in the West . In Taiwan , which spent about $ 8 billion , or 5 % of its gross_domestic_product , on defense in 1989 , top military_leaders hurriedly switched the focus of their strategy -- de-emphasizing research and development of Taiwan ' s own weapons_systems and stressing instead the procurement of advanced hardware from overseas . France became the pioneer in launching the new era . By 1991 , French officials were making frequent visits to Taipei . They broke the ice with a multibillion-dollar contract to sell six Lafayette-class light frigates to the Taiwan navy . And France offered other advanced weapons_systems up_to and including the Mirage jet fighter , a plane far more sophisticated than any being used at the time by Taiwan ' s air_force . A French source said the change in France ' s arms policy was approved by top-level officials in Paris , with Dassault , the company that makes the Mirage , actively lobbying for permission to sell to Taiwan . Other Europeans followed_suit . The Germans offered minesweepers , and the Belgians hawked rocket guidance and propulsion_systems . British , Italian and even Russian military officials and contractors began prospecting in Taipei . Taiwan was flattered by the attention . &quot; For decades , the United States was the only supplier of weapons to our country , &quot; said Huang Huang-hsiung , an opposition legislator on the legislature ' s defense committee . &quot; Sometimes , I felt the United States ' attitude was very harsh , very tough . With the European_countries , we felt more respected and friendly. &quot; The Europeans were a bit more cynical about it . Defense_contractors began to offer &quot; commissions &quot; for weapons sales . This was particularly the case , one European businessman confided , in instances where the military need for a company ' s wares was not so obvious and where Taiwan military officials could help get the required defense budget allocations . The European arms dealer said he believed that Taiwan was becoming as corrupt as &quot; Shanghai in the 1940s . . . . It ' s so easy ( to sell arms ) now . And sometimes it doesn ' t even take money . All it takes is some girls in Paris. &quot; Europeans are not constrained by the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act , which makes_it illegal for U.S. companies to pay commissions or other fees to land contracts . In Taiwan , some defenders of this system of cash payments insist that it is the normal way of doing business on the island . &quot; If you ' re in the military and I win a contract , I may give you something as a gift -- some money , &quot; explained a Taiwan employee of a Western defense_contractor , who spoke on the condition that he not be identified . &quot; It ' s not a bribe . that ' s just the way it is here. &quot; Taiwan ' s Nationalist government would not permit anyone in its National Defense Ministry to be interviewed for the record on the procurement scandal . Because officials in Taiwan had relied for so_long on the United States as their sole arms supplier , they had little experience in handling competition for arms sales . And because most Western governments do not recognize Taiwan , it would have had a difficult time setting_up a formal , government-to-government military procurement system even if it had tried . So a shadowy subculture emerged in Taipei of foreign defense companies and retired Taiwan military officials , all working on arms deals . &quot; The value of ( arms ) procurement became higher and higher , and so did the profits , &quot; one retired Taiwan general explained . &quot; that ' s why people retired &quot; from the military . Taiwan ' s legislature was in no position to serve as a restraint on this procurement system . Only recently has it had any power . Until three years ago , many of its legislators were elderly retainers holding permanent seats that -- in a weird fiction Taiwan has since abandoned -- claimed to represent districts on the Chinese mainland , which they had not seen since the 1940s . Even after the legislature was strengthened and made democratic , Taiwan ' s elected legislators found it impossible to scrutinize arms procurement . &quot; What we saw on the budget books was a name ( of an arms deal ) and a number , &quot; Ding said . &quot; Anything more_than that , the Defense Ministry said was secret. &quot; From 1990 until today , Taiwan spent about $ 10 billion on weapons procurement , Ding estimated . &quot; We have been getting quite a lot of defense items , &quot; Taiwan Foreign Minister Frederick Chien said in a recent interview . &quot; When everything is in place , our defense position will be one that is quite adequate. &quot; The purpose , Chien said , is to assure investors that Taiwan has the capacity to defend itself . Taiwan ' s burst of spending for arms had a significant impact on the behavior of foreign governments . In 1992 , about half of all French arms sales overseas went_to Taiwan . And by that year , the pressure from France and other European competitors helped to bring_about a major change in U.S. policy . In the midst of his reelection campaign , President George_Bush announced that his White_House was opening the way for the sale of 150 American F-16 warplanes to Taiwan , a transaction worth about $ 6 billion for General Dynamics ( now Lockheed ) . Over the previous decade , Taiwan had repeatedly sought permission to buy those planes , only to be turned_down on grounds that the sale might violate Reagan ' s 1982 agreement with China . Bush_Administration officials argued that the sale did not violate the agreement because the F-16s merely replaced Taiwan ' s increasingly outmoded airplanes . But later that year , Taiwan bought 60 French Mirages , thus reducing its reliance upon the United States . U.S. companies , spurred on by the F-16 sale , have been urging Congress to adopt a new provision sponsored by Sen . Frank H . Murkowski ( R-Alaska ) that would guarantee that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan would not be restricted by the agreement between the Reagan_Administration and China . The provision , which has already been adopted by the Senate , would open the way for unlimited U.S. arms sales to Taiwan . &quot; The Soviet_Union is no longer a threat , and the defense industry doesn ' t have what it used to , &quot; said David Laux , head of the U.S. trade group that promotes business links with Taiwan . &quot; Here ' s this one rich customer , Taiwan , and we can ' t sell them what we want because we have to please this pariah , the People ' s Republic_of_China . . . . It just doesn ' t make sense. &quot; The widely publicized sales of the F-16s and Mirages attracted still more arms dealers to Taipei , offering more commissions and putting more retired generals and admirals on their payrolls . &quot; This corruption problem is universal , &quot; one retired Taiwan general said , sighing . &quot; Everyone wants to buy something for themselves. &quot; He added hastily , &quot; Of course , I hate corruption. &quot; So did Yin , the Taiwan navy captain , who last fall had apparently decided to do something about it . He was , by all accounts , a sincere , dedicated officer , high-ranking enough to be chosen last fall to testify at a legislative hearing about changing the way Taiwan buys its weapons . His murder is still under investigation , but prosecutors here believe that he was killed as he was preparing to expose a system of covert payments for arms sales . In January , prosecutors found an audiocassette made by Yin discussing the payments and showing that he was not involved . Taiwan ' s Defense Ministry announced last month that it had uncovered a series of bribes paid to navy officers in the purchase of weapons_systems from French and German companies . One navy captain who was a colleague of Yin ' s has admitted taking a bribe of about $ 360 # 000 from a Taiwan arms dealer who was the agent for the_French defense_contractor Thomson , the Defense Ministry said . Seven other navy officers and four Taiwan arms dealers , three of them former navy officials , have also been arrested in what is by far the most serious scandal to hit Taiwan ' s national security apparatus since 1985 , when top-ranking intelligence officials were implicated in the California murder of writer Henry Liu . In the wake of the arrests , Taiwan is scrutinizing all its arms purchases , and legislators such_as Ding and Huang are pressing for a complete overhaul of the country ' s arms procurement . Yin ' s murder &quot; is not a single case . This case is the tip of the iceberg , &quot; Ding said . &quot; The procurement procedures are the same for the navy , army and air force. &quot; A_few weeks ago , seven Taiwan generals appeared at a news_conference to apologize to the people for the procurement scandal . Asserted Gen . Shih Tsuo-ching : &quot; The corrupt deals have not only dealt a serious blow to the image of the military , but have also hurt our national interests. &quot; Mann was recently on assignment in Taiwan .
