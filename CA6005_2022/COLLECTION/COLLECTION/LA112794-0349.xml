   <HEADLINE> LEFTIST GROUP STANDS GOOD CHANCE IN URUGUAY VOTE ; POLITICS : PRESIDENT TO BE ELECTED TODAY . NATION ' S TWO TRADITIONAL PARTIES CHALLENGED FOR FIRST TIME BY SOCIALIST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Uruguayans elect a new president today , and the chance that a socialist could win has injected extra excitement into the race . This is the first time in Uruguayan history that a leftist coalition has seriously challenged the country ' s two traditional parties for national power . Pollsters and commentators say the three-way presidential contest is too close to call . The socialist candidate is Tabare Vazquez , a physician and former mayor of Montevideo whose Broad Front coalition includes Communists and former guerrillas . Other leading candidates are lawyer Alberto Volonte of the governing Blanco ( White ) Party and former President Julio Sanguinetti of the Colorado ( Red ) Party . Recent political polls put all three parties within a_few percentage_points of one another . A survey published last week by the Vox polling firm , for example , gave the Blancos 28 % of the voter preference , the Colorados 27.9 % and Vazquez ' s coalition 25.9 % . A total of 20 presidential candidates are running . Uruguayan law allows more_than one presidential candidate from each party or coalition ; the top-placing candidate of the party or coalition that draws the most votes wins the presidency . Volonte is a former president of the national electric_company . Another Blanco candidate is Sen . Juan Ramirez , who was interior minister under President Luis Alberto Lacalle . Lacalle is constitutionally barred from immediate reelection . Sanguinetti , who was president from 1985-1990 , is the overwhelming favorite among Colorado candidates . Far behind him , according to polls , is another former Colorado president , Jorge Pacheco Areco . Uruguay , a country of 3.2 million people , was known as Latin_America ' s most advanced welfare_state for much of this century . But beginning in the 1960s , the national economy declined as government deficits and inflation soared . The country ' s traditional democracy was shaken by guerrilla violence in the early 1970s , then interrupted by a decade of harsh military dictatorship . Although Sanguinetti and Lacalle have presided over moderate economic_growth and some progress in taming unruly inflation , they have failed to bring_back what nostalgic Uruguayans remember as the golden years of the 1940s and 1950s . Many voters see Lacalle ' s market reform policies as a threat to the traditional welfare_state . In a 1992 plebiscite , for example , voters overwhelmingly rejected a government-backed proposal to privatize the state telephone_company . Sanguinetti , who opposed the privatization , was leading in the polls by a wide margin early this year . Then Volonte -- who had never run_for office before -- began gaining popularity , propelled by his congenial campaign style and his reputation as an efficient administrator . Vazquez ' s appeal is based on disappointment in Colorado and Blanco administrations and on the popularity of the welfare-state tradition , analysts say . But they also say radical Marxist influence in the leftist coalition is a handicap for Vazquez . &quot; A lot of people don ' t trust the radicals , &quot; a foreign diplomat said .</TEXT>
