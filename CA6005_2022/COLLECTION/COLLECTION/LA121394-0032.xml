   <TEXT> On the day he was fired after more_than a decade as editor of Barricada , the newspaper of Nicaragua ' s Sandinista movement , Carlos Fernando Chamorro packed up a portrait of his crusading-newsman father and a statue of the revolution ' s hero and namesake , Augusto Cesar Sandino . Ousted by hard-line Sandinistas in October , the 38-year-old scion of one of Nicaragua ' s most storied families stood_in the newsroom and said an emotional goodby to friends , colleagues and a political vision . In the days that followed , most of Barricada ' s veteran reporters were purged , and the paper , which had evolved into Nicaragua ' s most professional , was thrown into journalistic anarchy . &quot; It was an act of extreme political intolerance , &quot; Chamorro said afterward . Chamorro and Barricada are the latest casualties in a divisive Sandinista identity_crisis . Fifteen years after they came_to power in an armed revolution , and as they begin to plot their return to power , Nicaragua ' s Sandinistas -- arguably the single most powerful political and social influence in recent national history -- are locked_in a bitter struggle that threatens to split the movement forever . The Sandinista crisis mirrors the internal battles of the left throughout Latin_America , where onetime guerrilla armies have moved_into civilian politics but must redefine their roles , direction and goals in the post-Cold War world . On one side of the Sandinista rupture are moderate party reformers such_as Chamorro and Sergio Ramirez , vice_president during the 1979-90 Sandinista rule . They want to modernize the party and move it closer to the center to attract a wider following . On the other side is the traditional core leadership , including stalwarts such_as former President Daniel Ortega . They speak_of defending the achievements of the Sandinista revolution , but their real commitment to democracy and nonviolent protest has been called into question . The leftist Sandinista National Liberation Front , or FSLN , which maintained formidable unity during its war with U.S.-backed Contra rebels throughout the 1980s , has been torn by internal debate ever since its stunning loss to a center-right coalition in 1990 elections that delivered the presidency to Violeta Barrios de Chamorro , mother of Barricada ' s ousted editor . But never before have the disputes been so public and so acrimonious as now , with the Barricada episode as evidence . At the heart of the debate : What does_it mean to be a Sandinista today ? Critics of the Ortega faction -- which by all accounts still commands most of the party apparatus and grass-roots following -- say the leadership is charting a path of self-destruction . Many of the party ' s best-known intellectuals are being driven_out or have opted to leave as the quarrels feed widespread disillusionment with politics in_general in a country still recovering from a decade of civil_war . Reflecting what critics see as their authoritarian tendencies , Ortega and the rest of the hard-liners have sought to stifle moderate voices in recent weeks : taking Barricada from Chamorro ; ousting Ramirez from his seat in the National Assembly , where he led the Sandinista legislative delegation , and stacking internal leadership posts with their own supporters . Ernesto Cardenal , the famous poet and priest who served as culture minister in the Sandinista government , accused Ortega of hijacking the FSLN and , in a dramatic gesture , renounced his party membership . &quot; This , &quot; he said , &quot; is not the Sandinista front that we fought for , that so many martyrs died for. &quot; The Sandinistas started_out as a motley army of young rebels who fought and , in 1979 , finally toppled the 43-year Somoza family dictatorship . The victorious , Soviet-backed Sandinista government drew fire from Ronald Reagan_Administration officials , who launched an insurgency by supplying arms to former members of ousted President Anastasio Somoza Debayle ' s National_Guard and thousands of disaffected peasants . The Contra war of the 1980s claimed about 30 # 000 lives and ended with Ortega ' s electoral loss to Violeta Chamorro in 1990 . Support for the Sandinistas eroded further in the waning days of their government as officials and militants made off with the titles to hundreds of properties , houses , businesses and goods . The pinata , as the seizures became known , was followed by reports of other ways in which the Sandinista commandantes had become rich while in office . Now , while Ramirez and his moderates portray themselves as true proponents of a democratic system based on law and justice , Ortega and his faction claim to be the protectors of the poor from the current government ' s free-market policies . The hard-line faction maintains that it is the authentic nucleus of Sandinista ideology . Many of the diverse groups that joined the FSLN to oust Somoza were not committed to social revolution , this faction argues , and it is natural that they gradually leave . Ortega and others accuse the moderates of trying to dilute the socialist legacy left by the Sandinista regime . Specifically , the hard-liners mention the moderates ' enactment of laws that would return most confiscated property to original owners . Meanwhile , the moderates also insist on the disavowal of violence as a political tool . &quot; They ( the moderates ) think that , to be a viable political ( force ) , you have to ' de-Sandinistacize ' the party as quickly as possible , &quot; said Rene Vivas , the former Sandinista police_chief who was recently elected to the National Directorate , which oversees the FSLN . &quot; They can call themselves whatever they want , &quot; he said , &quot; but if we see ( them ) dismantling the social gains of the revolution . . . then that is a new type of Sandinismo that has nothing to do with our Sandinismo. &quot; But others argue that the hard-left Ortega approach is outdated and will only further isolate the FSLN , reducing it to a hard-core , faithful -- but small -- number of Sandinistas . In a recent sign-up campaign , the FSLN registered almost 340 # 000 members , making_it the largest party in the country . But the number represents only 16 % of Nicaragua ' s voters . &quot; The front could become a ghost ship , with the same loyal crew but without any passengers , &quot; said Silvio Prado , a Sandinista political analyst and dissident who is critical of both sides . &quot; People are beginning to understand the difference between the Sandinista front and Sandinismo . . . . What could die is the front , not Sandinismo , which is a tradition , a way of seeing the world and of organizing. &quot; The Sandinista crisis is intensified by presidential politics as the jockeying begins for the 1996 national elections . It is no secret that both Ortega and Ramirez have designs on the presidency , which under a new set of constitutional reforms requires a candidate to receive more_than 45 % of the vote to avoid a runoff . Ortega and Ramirez are men of completely different styles . Even as they governed as president and vice_president through most of the past decade , Ortega was the fiery revolutionary , Ramirez the learned novelist lending international credibility to a movement . Nowhere has the conflict that engulfs Sandinismo been more visible than at Barricada . Ousted editor Chamorro and other leading Sandinistas founded the newspaper in 1979 as the official party mouthpiece , a role that it fulfilled throughout the Contra war . But after the 1990 Sandinista loss at the polls , Chamorro changed the paper into a more professional , pluralistic publication . Chamorro ' s family has been at the center of the political intrigue that has marked modern Nicaraguan history . His mother is the country ' s president , and the 1978 murder of his father , publisher Pedro Joaquin Chamorro , who ran the newspaper La Prensa , helped galvanize the forces opposed to dictator Somoza . The family was divided during the 1980s into pro- and anti-Sandinista camps . Carlos ' sister Cristina runs La Prensa , now a conservative paper and often shut_down by the Sandinistas when they were in power . His uncle Xavier Chamorro publishes the vaguely pro-Sandinista Nuevo Diario . In a country where most newspapers and radio and television_stations follow a strident political line , Barricada , remarkably , evolved into a balanced journalistic outlet . Even U.S. diplomats , once sharp opponents of the Sandinistas , said Barricada gave them the fairest treatment . But Ortega and the hard-liners decided they wanted back a vehicle for the party_line , and they knew Carlos Chamorro would not go_along with that . &quot; The party did not need an impartial newspaper , &quot; said Victor_Hugo Tinoco of the National Directorate . &quot; It needed a newspaper that reflected its point of view. &quot; Tomas Borge , the former Interior minister and lone surviving founder of the FSLN , appeared at Chamorro ' s office one morning in October and read out the letter of dismissal . By the end of October , 17 reporters -- almost the entire staff -- had quit or been fired . But that came only after the reporters and Borge argued day and night over headlines and stories . Despite longstanding personal animosities between them , Borge and Ortega became allies in this fight . The new Barricada suddenly began to publish harsh editorials -- on its front page -- against the moderate Ramirez , and coverage of the National Assembly ' s debate of constitutional reforms , most of which Ortega opposes , was decidedly one-sided . Chamorro and the others , who had guided Barricada from the clandestine underground to a respected paper , felt betrayed by the men they once revered . &quot; We began work_at this paper , many as young people , with a project in mind . We designed it , carried it forward , defended it , &quot; said Sofia Montenegro , who quit as editor of Barricada ' s weekly supplement , Gente . &quot; Everything we achieved in the last four years fell_apart in a week. &quot; Montenegro and the other journalists have begun legal_proceedings against Borge . When he appeared in court early last month to respond , the scene that unfolded would have been unimaginable just a short time ago . &quot; Liar ! Liar ! &quot; several of the out-of-work Sandinista reporters shouted at Borge as he left the courtroom . One challenged him on the wealth he has allegedly secreted over the years . &quot; How dare you make such accusations ! &quot; a tense , grim-faced Borge retorted . The man who had once been as feared in some quarters as he was worshiped in others left quickly . Montenegro said the goal that she and other dissident Sandinistas now share is to demystify the legendary Sandinista figures like Borge . &quot; It is the best favor we can do for Sandinismo , &quot; she said , &quot; and for the country. &quot; FOR PIC SLUGGED CARLOS</TEXT>
