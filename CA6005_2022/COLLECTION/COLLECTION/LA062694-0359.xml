   <HEADLINE> JAPANESE PRIME_MINISTER HATA ' S STATUS GETS BOOST AFTER RESIGNATION ; ASIA : HE IS SEEN AS LEADER WILLING TO SACRIFICE HIMSELF . ADDED STATURE MAY HELP HIM REGAIN JOB .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japan ' s outgoing Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata , the &quot; nice guy &quot; who coalition leaders hoped could end bickering in their ranks by the sheer force of his cheerful personality , emerged from his resignation Saturday with heightened status as a leader willing to sacrifice himself for a greater goal . The new stature might even help him win his job back when maneuvering to patch together a new coalition begins in_earnest this week . Facing a parliamentary no-confidence motion he could not defeat , Hata could have fought_back by calling a general_election in which his own Renewal Party stood to score the biggest gain . Instead , Hata gave_up the premiership and even risked allowing the Liberal Democratic Party to regain a slice of the power it lost last summer after ruling Japan for 38 years . Unless the rebellious Socialists return to the coalition , no government can be formed without the Liberal Democrats . Meanwhile , other nations kept a watchful eye on events in Tokyo . Hata ' s resignation adds another element of uncertainty to world financial markets , which were riled last week as the dollar plunged to a post-World War II low against the Japanese yen -- sparking a global selloff in_stocks and bonds . The dollar ' s weakness has been blamed in part on the stalled negotiations between the United States and Japan to reduce Japan ' s huge trade surplus . With Japan again leaderless , global investors fear that there is no prospect for progress in the trade talks , and thus the dollar may be forced lower . Two days before Hata resigned , Minoru Morita , a respected political commentator , predicted that if the prime_minister called a general_election for July , Hata ' s party would increase its strength in Parliament by at least 50 % . His major adversaries , the Liberal Democrats and the Socialists , by contrast , would suffer setbacks , Morita predicted . Hata confessed to Japanese reporters that he had thought of allowing a vote on the Liberal Democrats ' no-confidence motion and ordering a general_election after its expected passage . But more important , he said , was preserving electoral reform won only after a five-year struggle , avoiding more_than a month of political vacuum and not sending another leader with shaky credentials to an economic summit of advanced industrial democracies . The Group of Seven is to meet next month in Naples , Italy . Hata ' s resignation Saturday wiped_out the no-confidence motion and the possibility of an election that would have been held under the old system of multi-seat districts that , critics say , promote pork-barrel politics . Redistricting into single-seat constituencies has not yet been carried_out . &quot; Look_at the record of my 25 years in politics , &quot; he said at his resignation news_conference . &quot; I have never acted for individual benefit . I have always thought of the country. &quot; No one contradicted him . Significantly , Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama , whose help the coalition needs to regain a majority , praised him . No criticism at all was made of anything he had done during his brief two months in office . Indeed , in submitting their no-confidence motion , the Liberal Democrats complained only about the meager 37 % of lower-house seats left to the coalition after its biggest member , the Socialists , walked_out April 12 , hours after helping elect Hata prime_minister . On Thursday , when Hata offered to quit to meet a Socialist demand for a face-saving reason for their rejoining the coalition , he presumed that he had the Socialists ' support in a new election for prime_minister . But Friday , the Socialists reneged_on earlier promises and declared that they would not support Hata again . New names started appearing on the dartboard of possibilities for Japan ' s seventh prime_minister in five years . Among them were Socialist Chairman Murayama and Masayoshi Takemura , head of the splinter New Party Harbinger who served as chief Cabinet secretary in the eight-month Cabinet of former Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa . Hata , who said he would &quot; entrust my future to Parliament , &quot; remained near the center of the board . Near the edge was Yohei Kono , the Liberal Democrats ' president . Takemura suggested that Socialist leader Murayama become prime_minister and that a new Cabinet be built around the Socialists , instead of Hata ' s Renewal Party whose deputy , Ichiro Ozawa , is an archenemy of Takemura . Koichi Kato , a rising star in the Liberal Democratic Party , said Kono , his party ' s chief , &quot; would be best &quot; but named both Murayama and Takemura as leaders whom the Liberal Democrats could support in an LDP-Socialist-Harbinger coalition . Murayama rejected any attempt to form a coalition &quot; at this time &quot; with the Socialists ' traditional enemy , the LDP , saying his party would first try to work_out terms of a new alliance with the coalition . When Kono handed him a copy of a Liberal Democrat coalition platform Saturday afternoon , the Socialist leader replied only , &quot; I ' ll read it carefully. &quot; Hata said he was resigning in hopes that a new Cabinet , united on policy and fortified with a strong base , could be formed . But there was no guarantee of such a government emerging . Although the new single-seat electoral_system is expected to force an amalgamation of Japan ' s myriad parties , so far the old political structure has been splintering , not regrouping . There are now 15 different parties and groups in Parliament , and unity is reported badly frayed within the Liberal Democrats and the Socialists . More splits could occur in the effort to build a new coalition . Commentators have compared the idea of blending the Socialists and the conservative Liberal Democrats into a coalition with trying to mix oil and water . And if the Socialists rejoin the coalition , they would remain at_odds with its other parties over tax reform . A return of international tensions over how to deal with suspected North_Korean development of nuclear_weapons almost certainly would stir a fight between the Socialists , who oppose sanctions and insist on dialogue , and the rest of the alliance . So far , the turmoil that has forced_out two prime_ministers in the last three months appears to have taken its biggest toll on U.S.-Japan economic relations .
