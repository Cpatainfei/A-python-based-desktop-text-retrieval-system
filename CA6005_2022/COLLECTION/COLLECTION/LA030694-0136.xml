   <HEADLINE> POLICE SUICIDES RISE AS HIDDEN EPIDEMIC SWEEPS THE COUNTRY ; LAW_ENFORCEMENT : SPECIALISTS SAY THAT OFFICERS TAKE THEIR OWN LIVES AT A RATE AT LEAST DOUBLE THAT OF THE GENERAL POPULATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The man didn ' t show_up for work so Cindy Goss phoned his home . No answer . She jumped in her car and rushed to his house . He was there , a bottle and a glass at his side . &quot; Trust me , &quot; she said to him . &quot; You must trust me now. &quot; Her heart pounding , she slid her finger between the trigger and the trigger guard and eased the muzzle of the gun from his mouth . Cindy Goss is one of America ' s more successful battlers against what one forensic psychologist calls a hidden epidemic : police suicides . It is hidden because suicides tend to be hushed_up , in part out of reluctance by police authorities to admit they may be work-related . And , although &quot; epidemic &quot; may_not be quite apt -- there is nothing contagious about suicide -- there does appear to police psychologists to be an undeniable increase lately across the country . In America , about 16 of every 100 # 000 adults commit suicide annually . At least that is the figure generally accepted among psychologists studying the problem . In the New York City police_force of 30 # 000 , the nation ' s largest , at least 63 officers have committed suicide in the last 10 years . that ' s 31 % higher than the average . Last year ' s eight suicides were nearly double the average . In the Jacksonville , Fla. , force of 1 # 200 , tiny by comparison , four suicides in the last two years is 10 times the general rate . &quot; I don ' t see any tie directly to the job , &quot; said Jacksonville ' s director , W . C . Brown . Neither did New York Police_Commissioner Raymond Kelly . All eight suicides on his force , he said , stemmed from &quot; domestic problems , &quot; not police work . There are no government statistics on the suicide rate of police_officers , but the Occupational Safety and Health Administration reports that police_officers have a life span eight to 11 years shorter than the average . Specialists who study police suicide say the rate on a national scale is at least double that of the general population and possibly higher . You could not persuade Cindy Goss that the reason has nothing to do with the emotionally draining work . Police , incidentally , refer to their work as The Job , as if no other fits the definition . Goss is a certified counselor for drug and alcohol_abuse . She went_to work with the employee assistance program for New York ' s Erie County and met with success in every county office except one . &quot; In the Sheriff ' s Department , &quot; she said , &quot; nothing seemed to work. &quot; She set_about discovering why . What she discovered about The Job others in the field have discovered as well . To oversimplify , the progression from idealistic police_academy graduate to depressed cop with his gun in his mouth goes like this : Graduate frequently exposed to blood , gore and danger . Does not unburden these horrors on spouse . Spouse would n ' t understand . A few drinks with the guys after work helps to unwind . Fellow cops understand . can ' t trust civilians . can ' t admit troubles even to fellow cops ; would be considered a wimp . can ' t trust fellow cops . Drinking increases . Spouse takes_off . Gun is handy . The gun Cindy Goss removed from that officer ' s mouth was only one of five similar rescues she has made in as_many years . All five men are back at_work . There ' s no telling , of course , how many lives the program she devised five years ago might have saved . But the decrease in absenteeism , sick_leave , turnover , tardiness and other measures of departmental performance are so marked that the program has become mandatory in every police agency in Erie and some_other New York counties and has leaped the border into Canada . No agency to adopt it has recorded a suicide since . More obvious , say colleagues , are the hundreds of careers , even marriages , saved long before the progression reaches the gun-in-mouth stage . &quot; Cops are_well screened before they sign_on , &quot; said Harley Stock . &quot; Most have a mentality more like a social_worker than a soldier . Over time and in increments , they don ' t recognize their personality gets chipped_away and changes. &quot; Stock , among other specialties , is a screener . He knows the progression well , both from textbooks and experience . He has earned a handful of degrees , including a doctorate in police psychology , a narrow but expanding specialty . He ' s a certified SWAT team member and hostage negotiator . He worked with two_dozen police agencies in Michigan and was police psychologist in Broward County ( Ft . Lauderdale ) , Fla . He now has his own treatment center , &quot; Interphase 911 &quot; in Boca Raton , exclusively for police_officers and entirely confidential . &quot; Typically , &quot; he said , &quot; the cop who commits suicide is a male , white , 35 , working patrol , abusing alcohol , separated or seeking a divorce , experiencing a recent loss or disappointment . Typically , a domestic dispute is involved . &quot; Cops are controlling individuals . When a cop loses_control in his own home he can ' t handle it . For 24 to 36 hours he is acutely suicidal . He barricades himself in his house and makes all kinds of threats . If he can get beyond that point he gets himself back together very quickly . You don ' t see that in the general population. &quot; &quot; Also , &quot; said Stock , &quot; about 90 % of the time the cop is drinking heavily when he shoots himself. &quot; ( That was the case in all five of the men Cindy Goss took the guns from. ) &quot; Here ' s a statistic with lots of supporting data to back it up , &quot; Stock continued . &quot; About 10 % of the general population who drink become alcoholics . Among cops the figure is 23 % . Cops also abuse drugs . &quot; And here ' s another solid statistic : The suicide rate among alcoholics in the general population is 270 per 100 # 000 &quot; -- far above the 16 per 100 # 000 in the general population . Among cops , after-shift drinking_bouts are so endemic to The Job that they have a universal euphemism for it : choir practice . If the pitfalls of choir practice aren ' t obvious , Stock explains : &quot; Alcohol at first releases tension , but if you drink enough it becomes a depressant . So if you have an underlying depression , it makes_it worse . The suicide rate among people suffering from depression is 230 per 100 # 000 . &quot; What you have , then , is a psychologically panicking cop full of alcohol , depressed , with access to a weapon . Bad combination . Bad combination. &quot; In a recent study of 20 suicides in one large Midwest police_department , 13 of the victims were alcohol abusers . Joseph Wambaugh , the writer , has long studied the progression from idealism to despair . Wambaugh was a Los Angeles police_officer for 17 years . His books , fiction and nonfiction , are as much about how police do their jobs as what The Job does to them . &quot; Cops , of course , see the worst of people , but they expect that when they sign_on , &quot; he said . &quot; What they don ' t expect -- and nothing can prepare them for it -- is to see ordinary people at their worst . This works_on their sense of belief , I would say , and they tend to become prematurely cynical . &quot; Even people who come from war can rationalize it by telling themselves that that was war and in war people become savage barbarians . But this is not war and people are normal and good . And here he is in the middle of the night in a normal person ' s home seeing normal people at their absolute worst . He begins believing that all people are barbarians and savages . &quot; I ' ve had_young cops confess to me in a patrol_car at night that when they go_to the grocery_store they wonder who the grocer is ripping_off , whether he will try to cheat them . When they go_to church , they wonder what the preacher does when nobody ' s around . that ' s pretty cynical . &quot; An old saying among cops is that everybody is garbage except my partner and me and I ' m not sure about him . When he begins to include himself , the erosion of self-esteem is complete , the cynicism is complete. &quot; Wambaugh , Stock , Goss and others all seem to recognize these same steps toward depression and use the same phrases to describe other traits of The Job . The John Wayne syndrome , for example . This is the cultivated swagger of authority -- and its corollary , the macho refusal to admit a weakness or ask_for help . &quot; Eventually , &quot; Wambaugh said , &quot; the badge becomes almost heavier than he can carry. &quot; There ' s also the Minority Group syndrome : The embattled minority in blue refusing to associate with outsiders ( who can ' t be trusted ) but only with fellow cops . And another phenomenon of recent years : &quot; There used to be limits , &quot; said Stock . &quot; Even the worst criminal , unless pushed to the wall , would not shoot a cop because he knew it would be all_over for him . &quot; Now they ambush cops . The cop has to wonder whether a man-with-a-gun call is real or a setup . We had a case in Florida recently of two teen-agers shooting a cop in the head and riding_away on bicycles . When a cop stops a car with an expired license , he has to wonder whether a guy with an Uzi is sitting behind the tinted glass. &quot; Recently in Buffalo , N.Y. , someone drove by a precinct house and sprayed the building and the cruisers out front with automatic_rifle fire . The cops assumed it was someone &quot; sending them a message. &quot; Police work is not the most dangerous occupation . Statistically , firefighters , roofers , miners and others have more hazardous jobs . &quot; But with police_officers it is the anticipation of danger that causes the stress , &quot; said Lt . Timothy Tate . &quot; The stress never ends and it is overwhelming . Every cop in this area knows about the Buffalo shooting . A cop may_not get a call his entire shift , but he drives_around for eight hours with that knowledge. &quot; Tate is a 15-year police veteran in East Aurora , a suburb of Buffalo . Before that , he was a cop in Tampa , Fla . Like countless others , his career was interrupted by the way he chose to deal with that overwhelming stress . &quot; I came_to a point where alcohol was destroying my life. &quot; Now Tate , who is completing a doctoral dissertation at Syracuse University on police stress , supervises the Law_Enforcement Peer Support Group in Erie County . Stress . Peer counseling -- cops helping cops -- is a key element in the Cindy Goss program and every_other successful rescue and rehabilitation effort . &quot; As a supervisor , &quot; said the lieutenant , &quot; I also recognize a very practical reason apart from the obvious humane ones to keep a cop from falling by the wayside . It ' s cost-effective . &quot; It costs $ 50 # 000 and up and about five years ' experience to put a productive cop on_the_road . Full-blown treatment costs $ 10 # 000 or less . Doesn ' t it make_sense to save the trained cop rather than replace him with another $ 50 # 000 rookie ? &quot; The new federal proposal to combat the increase in crime and violence would provide money to put more cops on the street . that ' s great . But would n ' t it be more productive to address the stress problems of cops already on the street and keep them on_the_job ? Otherwise , I ' m not sure hiring new guys and training them will even keep_up with our current attrition rate. &quot; that ' s what Tate and the other peer counselors , all volunteers , are doing , and with commendable success . They are trained to catch the signals from their fellow cops that , being cops themselves , they recognize all too well . They are as aware as novelist Wambaugh , former cop , of what could happen if the telltale signals are missed : &quot; When you put that blue steel crucifix against the roof of your mouth and squeeze , nobody walks away. &quot;</TEXT>
