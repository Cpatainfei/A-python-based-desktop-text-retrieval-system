   <HEADLINE> UCI TAKES SCIENTIFIC APPROACH TO FUTURE ; EDUCATION : CHANCELLOR HOPES TO ATTRACT RESEARCH DOLLARS WITH BIOMEDICINE AND OTHER RISING DISCIPLINES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> UC Irvine believes_in better living through science . At least that ' s what some faculty_members say , as UCI officials increasingly devote their efforts to attracting research grants to campus . Want to identify the gene defect that causes dwarfism , or look_for the roots of Alzheimer ' s disease ? UCI researchers are already seeking those answers , but UCI Chancellor Laurel L . Wilkening wants more . Friday , Wilkening issued a report declaring her mission to propel UCI into the top 50 research institutions in the nation by 2000 , and a longer-range vision -- suggested by some students , faculty and staff_members -- to eventually crack the top 30 . It ' s a tough proposition when top California universities such_as UCLA , UC San Diego and Stanford are older , more established and competing for the same research dollars . But Wilkening will encourage UCI to grow by playing to Orange County ' s strengths and interests in the post-Cold War age : biomedicine and medical devices , environmental issues , computers and information_science and education . &quot; We do have advantages , &quot; Wilkening said in a meeting with Times reporters and editors Friday . &quot; Other universities have professional schools of agriculture , forestry , fisheries . . . . Those are from an era at the beginning of the century . We have to look_at how we serve important industry , but not do things that were good to do 30 years ago. &quot; UCI researchers will be looking_around Southern California and beyond for companies that can use the technology they are developing -- and pay them for it . The university ' s Technology Showcase , a first-ever conference held_on campus Friday morning , was a first_step . * More_than 100 executives and owners of biomedical companies visited UCI for the conference , organized by the Life_Science Industry Council , a partnership between UCI and Southern California biomedical and medical device companies . Eight UCI professors and researchers gave presentations on research at the university , which included new cancer therapies , the use of bacteria or fungi to change harmful chemicals into harmless materials and techniques for preserving human organs . &quot; We hope to nourish and expand UCI ' s relationship with your industry , &quot; Wilkening told conference attendees . Michael W . Berns , surgery professor and director of the Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic , showed_business people how lasers can be used to cut chromosomes in half and manipulate them under a microscope . &quot; We ' re looking_for partners to commercialize our technology , &quot; Berns told them . He clicked through slides showing medical_center patients whose huge tattoos were removed by lasers , and how lasers can drill tiny holes in animal cells to extract genetic material . Outside UCI ' s Engineering Quad , business people exchanged cards with UCI scientists and checked_out UC-ACCESS , a computer_system in which companies can dial up a University of California database to find_out which professors are doing research in areas they can apply to their own businesses . &quot; Our success to some degree is going_to be linked to a changing of the culture at UCI , &quot; said Dr. Michael E . Selsted , associate vice_chancellor for research . &quot; The expectation the campus has of its researchers needs to be raised. &quot; In the post-Cold War era , with government shying_away_from military projects , researchers are increasingly exploring health , the environment and family issues . As funding from state and federal_governments evaporates , researchers are seeking additional support from the private sector . &quot; As we look toward the year 2000 , it is clear that many of the old models of university research development will have to be discarded . There is simply not enough federal investment to support the potential for discovery and new technology in American universities , &quot; Selsted said . * Wilkening said she expects greater results from information and computer_science , engineering and particularly the College of Medicine . Officials are going_ahead with plans for a health center_on campus . Construction of the first building -- which will house neuroscience research -- is scheduled for 1995 . UCI officials are banking on cancer research as well , anticipating UCI will be named a special cancer center by the National Cancer Institute . But Wilkening has pointed to other areas of excellence she hopes to foster at UCI besides sciences . Concern about primary and secondary_education has become so deep that funding from both government and private grants has skyrocketed , she has said . UCI has received about $ 6.5 million in federal funds for education since 1992 , much of it from the National Science Foundation . Some science specialists caution against losing the basic disciplines that make_up a well-rounded university education , such_as humanities , because of a stress on research . &quot; We have a writing program that is world famous at UCI , &quot; Selsted said . &quot; It is not evaluated on its ability to generate funds , it ' s based on its intellectual product . That should be the case for every academic unit. &quot;</TEXT>
