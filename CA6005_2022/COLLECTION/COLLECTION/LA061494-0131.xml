   <HEADLINE> LOCAPALOOZA , SOCCER FEST WILL ROLL INTO TOWN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As always , grass-roots rock promoters looking_for an angle are taking_note of doings in the wider world and are jumping_on the bandwagon . Hence the Rock ' n ' Roll Soccer Fest , an evening of alternative bands at Old_World in Huntington Beach in honor of the upcoming World Cup tournament , and Locapalooza , a daylong alternative rock fest in Riverside modeled after the Lollapalooza touring package coming_to Cal State Dominguez Hills in September . Voodoo Glow Skulls , the Nuckle Brothers , Gameface , Endswell and Outspoken will play_at Soccer Fest on June 24 starting at 7:30 p.m. In keeping with the international flavor of the World Cup , promoter John Pantle is offering half off the $ 8 admission_price to anyone who presents a foreign passport . And slam-dancers will be penalized for using their hands . Old_World is at 7561 Center Ave . in Huntington Beach . ( 714 ) 323-8683 . Locapalooza takes_place Sunday from noon to midnight at the Riverside Armory in Fairmount Park ( the California 60 freeway and Market Street ) . The lineup includes the Skeletones , Boom Shaka , Engines of Aggression , Stanford Prison Experiment , Sublime , Naked Soul , Sages of Memphis , Vitamin L , Kiss the Clown , Brother Vibe and Killing Tree . There ' ll also be food and craft vendors , information booths for nonprofit groups , and body-piercers and tattoo artists . Admission : $ 12 in_advance , $ 15 at the door . ( 909 ) 793-9795 or ( 714 ) 740-2000 ( Ticketmaster ) . * Speaking of festivals . . . The WOMAD festival coming_to Irvine Meadows on July 10 is the big acronymic concert of the summer with Primus , Midnight Oil , Arrested Development and Live topping a bill that stretches to encompass acts from Africa , China , Turkmenistan and Mexico . But FESTAC ( Festival of African and Caribbean Arts &amp; Culture ) is another set of initials for music fans with broad tastes to consider . FESTAC Explosion ' 94 takes_place June 26 at the Rainbow Lagoon in Long_Beach . Set to appear are the Salsa Legends with Ray Baretto , Larry Harlow and Yomo Toro , Soca performer David Rudder , reggae singers Mutabaruka , U-Roy and Wendy Shaw , and African pop star Tabu Ley Rochereau and his 16-piece band from Zaire . The festival will run from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Tickets are $ 18 in_advance . ( 310 ) 839-9846 ( English speaking ) and ( 310 ) 677-5540 ( in Spanish ) . * Is it too early to start scouting the rock ' n ' roll rookie class of 1995 ? One fledgling contender worth watching is Wiskey Biscuit , a band from Huntington Beach that recently signed a deal with Geffen Records . Playing a hometown gig at Old_World a_few weeks back , the six-man band ' s bluesy rock sound called to mind the gutsy music that Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones were cranking_out circa 1965-66 . Singer Jason Mason ( his real name , we ' re told ) is a scrawny fellow with an obvious Dylan fixation . While he was a bit too introverted in performance , he showed magnetism and the ability to communicate both humor and wounded feeling . The band played with a loose assurance as lead guitarist Jeff Cairns , a commanding , tasteful player , served as a strong second focal_point to go_with Mason ( who contributed some strong harmonica playing ) . The group has a well-placed mentor in Scott Weiland , the singer with Stone Temple Pilots ; his younger brother , Michael , is Wiskey Biscuit ' s drummer . ( The band will open for STP , the Meat Puppets and Redd Kross at Irvine Meadows July 17. ) Scott Weiland produced a demo tape for the Biscuits , and STP ' s manager , former Orange County musician Steve Stewart , took them on as a client . Stewart says he played the tape for Geffen executive John David Kalodner , who offered them a deal on the spot . &quot; I sat there with my mouth open , &quot; Stewart said . &quot; He was so moved and affected by it . I knew he was committed to them , &quot; which led the band to choose Geffen over Atlantic ( STP ' s label ) -- which also had offered a contract . After signing the deal , the band members , all_in their early 20s , moved to Los Angeles where they share a house . Stewart says plans call_for July recording sessions in Austin with producer Paul Leary , the Butthole Surfers guitarist who produced the Meat Puppets ' latest album . An early 1995 release is expected .</TEXT>
