   <HEADLINE> CENTRAL_AMERICA ; OLD FOES FORM NEW ALLIANCES IN EL_SALVADOR ; PRESIDENT-ELECT ARMANDO CALDERON SOL STRIKES A CONCILIATORY NOTE . BUT MANY IN HIS RIGHT-WING PARTY ARE RESISTANT TO SWEEPING REFORMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For years , the two men wanted nothing more_than to kill each other . Yet there they sat on a television studio set , arguing over election results and El_Salvador ' s journey from war to peace . Schafik Handal , the Communist head of El_Salvador ' s former guerrillas , and Gen . Mauricio Vargas , a senior army commander until his retirement last year , became increasingly animated and heated as the moderator looked_on helplessly . Vargas scolded Handal , repeatedly slapping him on the knee , and Handal shouted back , jabbing his finger in the air inches short of Vargas ' face . Then , just as things seemed ready to escalate out of control , it was over , and the two men laughed and shook hands . The El_Salvador that right-wing politician Armando Calderon Sol was elected to govern this week is a country where old hatreds often seem close to the surface . At the same time , it is a society where old enemies often form new alliances and where the two sides may be forced to make concessions to hold the country together . &quot; Unless the most minimum agreement is struck between the left and the right , this country will not be governable , &quot; said Rodolfo Cardenal , a Jesuit priest and analyst with the liberal University of Central_America . Calderon Sol has been careful to strike a conciliatory note since scoring a landslide victory in elections Sunday . He immediately sought to allay fears about his administration by pledging to respect U.N.-brokered peace accords that ended El_Salvador ' s civil_war two years ago . And , addressing opponents he had called &quot; terrorists &quot; throughout the bitter and divisive campaign , Calderon Sol said he recognized that rival Ruben Zamora and the former guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front , or FMLN , had earned &quot; undeniable political space &quot; in the elections . Calderon Sol ' s ties to hard-line members of his Nationalist Republican Alliance , or Arena , and the party ' s history of extremist violence raise questions about his commitment to the sweeping political and judicial reforms required by the accords . Many in Arena are resisting changes that include the formation of a nonpolitical civilian police_force . Indeed , despite Calderon Sol ' s moderate tone , Arena continued to send mixed signals . Even as Calderon Sol spoke_of dialogue and unity , outgoing President Alfredo Cristiani took a more belligerent stance during a Sunday night victory rally . He led chants of &quot; D ' Aubuisson , &quot; in homage to the late Roberto D ' Aubuisson , the reputed death squad leader who founded Arena , and he defended continued use of the party ' s war-era anthem , which pledges to make the nation &quot; the tomb where the reds end up. &quot; &quot; We will continue singing the hymn just as it was written , because here in El_Salvador international communism died , &quot; he told a roaring crowd . Leftist politicians have greeted Calderon Sol ' s comments with caution and skepticism , saying it is still too early to know the true designs of the new government . The left , bitter at its losses , also faces its own crisis . Riven by divisions , the FMLN may split into at least two factions , undermining its ability to serve as an effective opposition force to balance Arena ' s power . Zamora and the FMLN won 22 seats in the 84-member National Assembly , while Arena won 39 seats and will have control thanks to support from four congressmen who belong_to a pro-military party . It may be the depth of his country ' s profound economic and political crisis that will force Calderon Sol to work with the opposition . He cannot afford strikes and other unrest at a time when he will be struggling to rebuild this devastated country with dwindling foreign_aid . &quot; Even if he has the numbers to run the country without considering the left or the center-left , it is not in his interest to do so , &quot; U.S. Ambassador Alan Flanigan said . &quot; I am persuaded he understands the importance to his administration of being able to work with other parts of the political spectrum. &quot; Final Tally Vote totals for president of El_Salvador in two rounds of balloting : Candidate : Armando Calderon Sol Party : Arena Total votes ( March 20 ) : 641 # 108 Percentage : 49 Total votes ( April 24 ) : 813 # 264 Percentage : 68 * Candidate : Ruben Zamora Party : Coalition Total votes ( March 20 ) : 325 # 582 Percentage : 25 Total votes ( April 24 ) : 378 # 980 Percentage : 32</TEXT>
