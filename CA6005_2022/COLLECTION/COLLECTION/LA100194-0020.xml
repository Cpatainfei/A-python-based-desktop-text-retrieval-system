   <HEADLINE> U.S. GETS TOKEN PAYOFF ON BOSNIA GAMBLE ; NATO : ALLIES GIVE VAGUE ASSURANCES ON TOUGHER MILITARY RESPONSES TO REBELS . WASHINGTON HAD HOPED FOR PRESSURE ON SERBS TO MAKE_PEACE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration appeared Friday to have won only a token payoff on a gamble in which peace in the Balkans and the credibility of NATO were at stake . Washington had hoped that by delaying moves to arm Bosnia-Herzegovina ' s outgunned government it might compel NATO allies to seriously pressure Bosnian Serb renegades to make_peace . But U.S. Defense_Secretary William J . Perry left a two-day NATO strategy session here with little more_than vague assurances from European defense ministers that &quot; pinprick &quot; air strikes would be replaced by more forceful action to induce the rebels to settle for two-thirds of the Bosnian territory they have overrun . The alliance will press the U.N. bureaucracy to allow NATO pilots to carry_out air strikes &quot; with greater speed , with surprise and with more force than in the past , &quot; Perry said . While accepting that decisions on when to use force rest with U.N. commanders , the defense ministers said NATO pilots summoned to carry_out air strikes should have an array of targets to choose from to avoid cat-and-mouse searches for individual weapons that can endanger the air crews . But grave doubts persisted about whether the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization is prepared to risk the wrath of the heavily armed Serbs by punishing them for attacks on U.N. &quot; safe havens &quot; and for violating weapons exclusion zones . It also remained unclear whether the defense chiefs ' promise to pursue broader use of air_power would satisfy Congress that NATO will act more decisively to protect Bosnian civilians . President Clinton is obliged by Congress to ask the U.N. Security_Council by Nov . 1 to lift an arms embargo hampering the Bosnian government if the Serb rebels continue to reject a peace plan drafted by the United States , Russia , Britain , France and Germany . But the four European members of that mediation team -- known as the Contact Group -- oppose lifting the embargo , fearing it will provoke rebel retaliation against British , French and Russian soldiers serving in the U.N. Protection Force . ( Germany has no troops on the ground. ) The United States has refused to take_part in the dubious U.N. ground force in Bosnia , where more_than 20 # 000 peacekeepers are deployed on humanitarian missions in active war zones with neither the means nor the mandate to deter fighting . And as the mission has bogged down and troops have become vulnerable to hostage-taking , pressure has been building_in Congress for unilateral U.S. action to counteract the Serbs ' huge advantage in weapons . &quot; Congress ' underlying concern is that they wanted to put more pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to accept the peace plan , and I think any plan we present to them does that , &quot; Perry said of the proposed fine-tuning of alliance policy on air strikes . Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic on Tuesday gave his support to a U.S. proposal to delay any delivery of arms to his forces for six months , as long as the Security_Council would agree now to nullify the embargo . France , Britain and Russia oppose lifting the embargo , even six months from now , yet the defense ministers exuded an attitude of having overcome disaster . &quot; The ministers were guided by the intention of presenting the American Administration a helping hand in_order to defuse the menace of an early decision by the Congress , &quot; acting NATO Secretary_General Sergio Balanzino said in an interview . He insisted that the &quot; political and psychological environment has changed &quot; enough with Izetbegovic ' s statement to persuade Congress that there is no urgency for moves that could divide NATO . Instead of threatening to confront the defiant Bosnian Serbs with a better-equipped government army , NATO appears to be depending_on Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to cut_off the rebels and force them to accept the peace plan . Perry conceded , however , that initial assessments from foreign monitors indicate that Serbia is still sending some contraband to Bosnian Serbs .</TEXT>
