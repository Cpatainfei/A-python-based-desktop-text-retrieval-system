   <TEXT> If you have access to the Internet , or even if you have an e-mail account somewhere else , you can get Securities and Exchange Commission filings electronically . Unfortunately , finding what you need isn ' t easy and in some cases won ' t be possible at all.Only about 1 # 000 major corporations make their filings electronically , and you can only get filings made in this way . ( All companies are expected to file electronically within a_couple_of years. ) Also , all_the filings are at least 24 hours old . The filings go first from the SEC to Mead Data , which is the government ' s designated wholesaler of SEC filings . The good news is that getting SEC filings via the Internet is becoming easier . Internet users lucky enough to be using the spiffy Mosaic interface can easily get what they want . And very soon others will be able to gopher to town.hall.org , the nonprofit group running the Internet project , to get filings using an easy menu system . Also available at the same place : Federal_Reserve_Board data . For more information , send e-mail to mail.town.hall.org. The body of the message should consist_of one word : help .</TEXT>
