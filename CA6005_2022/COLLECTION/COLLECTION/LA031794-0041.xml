   <HEADLINE> INK / PAUL D . COLFORD : J . P . DONLEAVY REVISITS WORLD OF ' GINGER MAN '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ah , to have been in Dublin when the second war was over . &quot; It was tremendous from the point_of_view that Ireland was the only place in Europe that wasn ' t damaged and blown_up , &quot; says writer J . P . Donleavy , an ex-Navy man who was attending Trinity College on the GI Bill of Rights during that euphoric time . &quot; There were eggs and butter . This sounds crazy now , but to have a piece of butter or a steak was a miraculous thing , &quot; he recalls . &quot; Almost every evening , when the pub would get jammed , it was a kind of celebration . I think it was a romanticized time in a way . There could have been an unconscious feeling that this was the beginning of world peace. &quot; Donleavy , author of &quot; The Ginger Man , &quot; the comic classic and perennial seller set_in that colorful time and place , takes us back again in &quot; The History of The Ginger Man &quot; ( Houghton Mifflin ) . The fitting publication date is today , St . Patrick ' s Day . The new book is an autobiographical howler that traces the Brooklyn-born transplant ' s Irish romps with the mischievous writer Brendan Behan , Gainor Stephen Crist and Maurice Girodias , whose Paris-based Olympia Press first published &quot; The Ginger Man &quot; in 1955 , after it was turned_down by American publishers . Behan was the first to read the book and encourage Donleavy as a novelist , Crist the model for Sebastian Dangerfield , the Ginger Man himself . Crist was a slothful Midwestern charmer who believed_in &quot; vegetative nirvana &quot; -- that is , &quot; the possibility of energy emanating from the inertia of absolute indolence. &quot; One day he had to run_for his bus from a restaurant , but did so while holding his plate and beer_bottle . He then took a seat and continued eating . As Behan described the episode , Donleavy writes : &quot; Now , I ' ll you one thing . . . whatever else we may say or think_about him , one thing is a certainty that he has as a human_being demonstrated his great practicality. &quot; Donleavy , 67 , an Irish citizen since 1967 , lives like a reclusive squire in an 18th-Century mansion on 200 acres in the Westmeath countryside . Resplendent this day in a corduroy suit , his tweed cap on the table , the white-haired Irish countryman and Bernard Shaw look-alike sits by a fire during a visit to New York and appears ages removed from the brawling Yank who lived his book ' s saucy tales . He says he reads hardly any literary fiction -- he prefers newspapers -- and he looks with mournful disdain at the commercial imperative that he considers the curse of the writing life in this country . &quot; When I failed to get ' The Ginger Man ' published here , I realized that this wasn ' t any place I was ever going_to survive , &quot; he says . &quot; I became very conscious of the writer ' s role . You know , it ' s like a baseball_game . You get_up , it ' s three strikes , you ' re out , or you hit a home_run , whereas in Europe I was conscious of the fact that you ' re a writer and you stay that way . You begin that way , you end that way. &quot; In more recent years , Donleavy says , a feminist backlash in American publishing circles has come_to impede him . Although he offers no specifics to support his suspicion , he says he cannot find a publisher for a third volume of his &quot; Schultz &quot; series of novels , in which his main character is arranging to have a hit_man kill his wife . Donleavy has always been his own literary_agent and is known as a tenacious negotiator . &quot; I ' m an unbelievable fan of his , &quot; says Carl Navarre , who in the mid-1980s obtained the lucrative paperback rights to &quot; The Ginger Man &quot; for Atlantic Monthly Press after cutting the deal with Donleavy himself . &quot; He is an incredible negotiator. &quot; &quot; An agent knows when you ' re washed_up and you ' re finished , and is likely to circulate that , when all writers are always on the verge of being washed_up and finished , &quot; Donleavy explains . &quot; I mean , they need that to live . You have to be washed_up and finished , mentally , just to go_on to do the next thing , to keep the battle going. &quot; * B Matter : A sobering tidbit reported by Media Industry Newsletter : Time and Newsweek did mid-May cover stories on Bosnia that ended_up being their worst-selling covers of 1993 . For Newsweek , the biggest newsstand hit of the year was a June 21 cover on lesbians ; for Time , it was the January profile of Bill_Clinton , the 1992 Man of the Year . . . &quot; Obsession : The Lives and Times of Calvin Klein , &quot; a hot_potato of an unauthorized biography that was dropped last year by G . P . Putnam ' s Sons , is nearing publication under the Carol Publishing Group ' s flag . No galley copies are being circulated before the late-April release of the book , written by Steven Gaines and Sharon Churcher .</TEXT>
