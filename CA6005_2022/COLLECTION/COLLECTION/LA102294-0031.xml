   <TEXT> The embattled dollar edged upward on financial markets Friday , following comments by top Treasury_Department officials that the United States will buy greenbacks if necessary to safeguard the currency ' s value . &quot; We ' re in the last legs of this downward move_in the dollar , &quot; said Robert A . White , senior_vice_president at Standard Chartered Bank in New York . &quot; The fundamentals dictate that the dollar should be higher. &quot; But uncertainty continued to surround the U.S. currency , unsettling the stock_market for the second straight day with fears of inflation and rising interest_rates . The Dow Jones industrial average closed_down 19.85 points at 3 # 891.30. The bond market stabilized , with the 30-year Treasury_bond yield slipping to 7.98 % from 7.996 % at Thursday ' s close . The dollar , meanwhile , flirted_with record lows before ending higher . It regained some ground against the German mark to end at 1.4995 marks in New York , up from 1.4923 on Thursday , the lowest level in two years . It was valued at 97.19 Japanese yen , compared to 97.10 yen the day before . Early Friday , it closed_in Tokyo at 96.98 yen , the lowest finish in Japan since the modern exchange_rate system was set_up in the late 1940s . &quot; When the dollar depreciates , the ( stock and bond ) markets assume that it ' s another reason for ( the Federal_Reserve_Board ) to raise interest_rates , &quot; said Sung Won Sohn , chief economist at Norwest Corp . in Minneapolis . &quot; It scares the heck out of them. &quot; Bewildered currency traders Friday had to scramble to follow an unusual series of policy statements on the dollar that emanated from the highest levels of the Treasury_Department . That mini-drama began Thursday , when Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said U.S. officials had no plans to prop_up the currency ' s value through intervention -- massive dollar purchases by the United States and other nations . Currency speculators took Bentsen ' s remark as a green_light to bid down the dollar , which plunged against the German mark , Japanese yen and British_pound . But Treasury officials were apparently uncomfortable with that spectacle . The dollar has fallen almost 2 % against the mark and 1.4 % against the yen this month alone . So Treasury Undersecretary Lawrence Summers , Bentsen ' s lieutenant , switched signals by declaring Friday that &quot; there are times when intervention is appropriate. &quot; Finally , Bentsen released his own statement that intervention could be &quot; effective , &quot; adding that &quot; we are concerned about recent movements in the dollar . As we have said , we prefer a stronger dollar. &quot; The dollar stabilized following the remarks , bringing a pause to the weeklong gyrations . Private investors began moving against the dollar Monday , interpreting the election victory of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s coalition as a sign of stability in the mark . Those sentiments were reinforced by upcoming U.S. elections and skepticism about President Clinton ' s policies , which make the dollar less attractive to foreign investors , analysts said . Experts also said basic economic forces have undermined the dollar . The ongoing U.S. trade_deficit means that billions and billions of dollars continue to flow_out of the country , creating a surplus in the world and cheapening their value . Investors seemed to respond to this phenomenon earlier this week , when the dollar tumbled against the yen on news of an expanding U.S. trade_gap with Japan . Norwest ' s Sohn estimated that the 1994 and ' 95 overall deficits in the nation ' s current_account -- the broadest measure of the trade_balance -- could total $ 250 billion . &quot; It ' s one of the reasons the dollar is doing especially poorly , &quot; he said . In a seeming paradox , however , the dollar ' s exceptionally low level could prove self-correcting , economists said . That is because a weak dollar provides U.S. exporters a price advantage against their foreign rivals , paving the way for progress in the trade_deficit . &quot; You gotta like the dollar , &quot; wrote Stephen Roach , an economist at Morgan Stanley , in a recent analysis that forecast steady improvements in the trade_deficit , propelled by efficient U.S. industry and growing purchases of American goods by recovering nations overseas . In the short run , however , many analysts are scratching their heads over Bentsen ' s initial hands-off comment and the subsequent clarifications that ensued . Said one observer : &quot; I was at the Fed yesterday , and they were shocked that he ( Bentsen ) would say that. &quot; Still others maintain there was logic behind the secretary ' s comment , however inflammatory the words may have sounded to financial speculators . Many experts believe that in the long term it has become a futile exercise for national governments to challenge the will of the huge private market in currencies . &quot; It was one of the first sensible comments on foreign_exchange that I ' ve heard coming_out of the Treasury , &quot; said Cynthia Latta , an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill in Lexington , Mass . Among Friday ' s highlights : Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 3 to 2 on the New York Stock_Exchange , where volume was a heavy 309.35 million shares . Like the Dow , broad market indexes closed lower . * GM fell 1 3 / 4 to 41 3 / 8 in very heavy trading after tumbling 3 3 / 4 on Thursday . * Silicon Graphics jumped 2 3 / 4 to 29 after posting earnings that beat analysts ' forecasts . * Community Psychiatric Centers lost 3 to 9 1 / 2 after saying its fourth-quarter results will not meet analysts ' expectations . * Summit Technology rose 2 3 / 8 to 34 7 / 8 on news that an advisory panel to the FDA had recommended approval of the company ' s excimer laser for treatment of nearsightedness . Dollar Takes a Plunge The dollar has plunged against the German mark for most of the year . The dollar in marks , weekly closes since June : Friday : 1.4995 Source : TradeLine</TEXT>
