   <HEADLINE> SLOVAK VOTERS REJECT WESTERN CAPITALISM ; EUROPE : PRELIMINARY RESULTS SHOW FORMER PRIME_MINISTER VLADIMIR MECIAR RETURNING TO POWER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Voters here issued a clear rebuke of Western-style capitalism Saturday , handing the party of former Prime_Minister Vladimir Meciar a strong election victory , according to preliminary results and exit polls after two days of voting . Meciar , who was ousted from power in March amid allegations of corruption and obstructing Slovakia ' s economic reforms , was expected to fall_short_of winning an absolute_majority . But his likely coalition partners were doing_well enough to ensure a Meciar-led government control of the 150-seat Slovak Parliament . &quot; These results are in total opposition to the principles of a market_economy , &quot; said Iveta Radicova of the Institute for Central European Studies . &quot; The majority of voters are saying what they really want is state paternalism -- a continued strong role of the state. &quot; Unofficial results showed Meciar ' s Movement for a Democratic Slovakia collecting nearly 34 % of the vote , more_than triple the tally of second-place Common Choice , one of several parties that have been governing since Meciar ' s 2-year-old government was toppled in the spring . Meciar , a former amateur boxer and two-time prime_minister , had been plotting his comeback almost since the moment he lost his job . In appeals heavy on patriotism and personal charisma , he has visited villages and workplaces across the economically depressed country promising everything from higher retirement_benefits to tougher policies against Slovakia ' s ethnic Hungarians . &quot; Above all , we showed voters that we wanted to continue the path we started in 1992 , &quot; Augustin Marian Huska of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia told Slovak television Saturday night . The outgoing caretaker government had won praise from Western governments and economic organizations for putting Slovakia back on a path of economic transformation . But voters , apparently frustrated by the hardship of moving from communism to capitalism , turned once again to Meciar , who has pledged to soften the blow by cutting taxes and keeping government control of many state-owned enterprises . &quot; What we expected is being confirmed , &quot; said Prime_Minister Jozef Moravcik , who defected from the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia in March after becoming disillusioned with Meciar . &quot; Six months is too short a time to change political conditions. &quot; Milan Ftacnik , an official with the Party of the Democratic Left , accused Meciar of winning_over Slovaks with &quot; cheap promises &quot; and populist rhetoric that promises only to further isolate Slovakia from its European neighbors . Ftacnik , a former Communist , warned that Meciar and the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia have yet to demonstrate that they can provide the political stability sorely lacking in Slovakia since the breakup of Czechoslovakia almost two years ago . &quot; They have shown that they can win elections but cannot govern on a basis of coalition , &quot; he said . Moravcik and other political_leaders , appearing Saturday evening on televised round-table discussions , said it was still possible for a broad-based coalition of Meciar ' s opponents to form a government . Meciar ' s critics had warned during the campaign that his return would spell economic and political disaster for Slovakia , a fear that had been real enough to bring_together former Communists and the religious right in the caretaker government . But the likelihood of another anti-Meciar coalition grew increasingly unlikely as results were tallied . Early projections showed that one potential coalition partner was not even garnering the 5 % of votes needed for parties to enter Parliament , while the other parties were all faring worse than pre-election surveys had predicted . &quot; It is a disappointment for us , &quot; said Frantisek Miklosko , deputy chairman of the Christian Democratic Movement , one of the governing coalition partners . Official results will not be available until today , but in the meantime Meciar is expected to begin pulling_together a possible coalition , which will likely include the Slovak National Party and the Assn . of Workers of Slovakia , a splinter_group of former Communists . Together , projections show , the parties would control more_than 80 seats in the Parliament .</TEXT>
