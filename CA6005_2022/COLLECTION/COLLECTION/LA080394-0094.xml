   <HEADLINE> PROBLEMS UNDERCUT DEBUT OF CLAS TESTS , PANEL SAYS ; EDUCATION : EXPERTS SAY OUTSIDE FIRM SHOULD ADMINISTER THE EXAMS . BUT THEY PRAISE THE PROGRAM FOR INNOVATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Budget constraints , scoring glitches and the difficulties inherent in such a complex new testing system have undercut the pioneering California Learning Assessment System exams , a panel reviewing the CLAS tests ' first rocky year has concluded . Most individual school results for the 1993 exams were less reliable than promised , and some 250 schools statewide received scores that may be woefully inaccurate because of severe processing problems , the panel found in its 62-page report , to be released today . The three-member panel of statistical experts recommended that the state_Department of Education hire an outside firm to administer the tests . The group also called_for the department to turn_over responsibility for scoring and interpretation of the results to a statistics expert and to hire a full-time technical coordinator to oversee the effort . The panel also cautioned against releasing individual student scores , scheduled to begin this year , until the bugs are worked_out and parents and teachers are thoroughly briefed on how to interpret the results . The governor ' s office has been pushing for individual results so parents and teachers can gauge students ' progress . The exams , intended to pinpoint a school ' s academic strengths and weaknesses by assessing how well students can think and write_about what they have learned , were given for the first time last year to about 1 million public_school students in fourth , eighth and 10th grades . To save money , the department decided to score only some of the exams in reading , writing and mathematics before releasing results for each school . Almost immediately , questions surfaced about the accuracy of the scores , which were widely published and used by parents and others to evaluate schools . A Times computer analysis published in April showed that thousands of schools received shaky results , and that at least 150 schools had statistically invalid samples of student scores . At one San Bernardino County middle_school , for example , only 1 % of the math tests were ever counted . Two schools -- Vicentia Elementary in Corona and Columbia Elementary in Tuolumne County -- received results based on exactly one student ' s work . Dozens of others across the state had only a handful of tests scored though scores , or even hundreds , of students participated in the exam . The panel of three statistical experts , appointed by the department in April to review its scoring procedures , found that there were serious shortfalls in the numbers of 1993 exams graded in about 250 , or 3 % , of schools . In those cases , additional exams were scored and results adjusted , the Department_of_Education said . But the experts , headed by Lee J . Cronbach of Stanford_University , concluded that &quot; few school-level reports in 1993 had adequate reliability. &quot; Problems inherent in the sampling procedures were compounded by lost test booklets , errors matching student identification sheets to the booklets , mistakes by the contractors helping administer and score the tests , and the rush to get scoring done and results released before the 1994 round of testing began in the spring . &quot; Inadequate review under time pressure led to the release of some reports that were manifestly untrustworthy , &quot; Cronbach added . To make matters worse , many parents and school staffs had expected all_the tests to be graded , the report noted . Although the panel was assigned to look primarily at the sampling procedures , it also noted difficulties in scoring the open-ended , or &quot; performance-based &quot; questions that are the hallmark of CLAS and other pioneering testing systems around the country . Instead of merely selecting the correct answer from a list of possibilities , students are being asked to solve math problems and explain their methods or read a passage from literature and write_about their responses . But the panel commended CLAS officials for some of their work . &quot; CLAS and its contractors have embarked_on an unprecedented and imaginative project . . . and they have done many things well , &quot; Cronbach wrote , adding the 1993 efforts were &quot; highly successful as a trial &quot; and shed valuable light on many aspects of the just-emerging field of performance-based assessment . &quot; All the shortcomings of CLAS 1993 can be remedied , &quot; Cronbach added . Acting state Supt . of Public Instruction William D . Dawson said he welcomed the report and has already acted_on some of its recommendations . Scoring of this year ' s tests , done_by specially trained teachers at sites around the state , already is underway and reflects the panel ' s suggestions , Dawson said . The report comes as CLAS , which is also under_attack from religious conservatives for the contents of its reading and writing tests , faces an uncertain future . Next week , legislators will work_on a compromise bill that would continue the system -- renamed the California Comprehensive Testing Program in state budget sessions this summer -- while addressing many of the criticisms . Gov . Pete Wilson ' s education adviser , Maureen DiMarco , who has been critical of how the testing has been developed and carried_out , said the report &quot; not only validates our concerns and the concerns of others but also gives us even greater impetus to continue to work to revise the assessment system. &quot; The governor ' s insistence on individual scores could be met by adding more traditional , skills-measuring methods , such_as multiple-choice questions , she added , noting some of the revisions sought by her boss and other CLAS critics already have been added_to the proposed legislation .
