   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL-SYRIA PACT LOOKS LIKELY , CHRISTOPHER SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Using some of the most upbeat language he has ever applied to the knotty negotiations between Syria and Israel , U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said Tuesday that he is increasingly hopeful that the bitter enemies are closing_in on a comprehensive peace agreement . &quot; We are moving_in the right direction , &quot; Christopher told reporters after meeting for almost four hours with Syrian President Hafez Assad to relay negotiating points he picked_up the day before from Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin . &quot; I think the parties are determined to try to achieve a comprehensive peace and there is hope that can be achieved , &quot; he said . &quot; I am more convinced than ever of the seriousness of both President Assad . . . and Prime_Minister Rabin. &quot; After a detour to Kuwait today to assure the emirate ' s leaders and officials of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council of U.S. determination to prevent Iraq from renewing aggression against Kuwait , Christopher will return to Jerusalem tonight to report to Rabin and will meet again with Assad on Thursday before heading_home Friday . Despite Christopher ' s optimistic account , Israel and Syria have not begun the sort of face-to-face negotiations that U.S. officials believe will be needed to nail_down a peace_treaty ending almost half a century of icy hostility , intermittent armed skirmishes and two major wars . All of the bargaining is being done through American go-betweens . A senior State_Department official , who attended the Christopher-Assad talks , said none of the troublesome issues dividing the parties has yet been completely resolved and &quot; in the end , if it doesn ' t fit together , it doesn ' t amount to anything. &quot; But he made_it clear that the gap has been narrowed on at least some of the points of disagreement . Neither the official nor Christopher would discuss any of the details . The senior official said both Rabin and Assad are now asking detailed questions about the position of the other , a sharp change from an earlier stage of the talks in which each side stated and restated its own position . &quot; They have begun to look_at issues to find where there might be a basis for common_ground , &quot; the official said . &quot; We brought some things here . . . and we are going_to take some things back. &quot; Israel and Syria have agreed in principle that any pact will involve a &quot; land for peace &quot; swap in which Israel will return to Syria some or all_of the Golan Heights in exchange for peaceful relations . But there are still wide gaps between the two countries on such issues as the speed and extent of Israeli withdrawal , the nature of the peace and new arrangements to guarantee the security of both countries . The senior official said the negotiating pace is slow and deliberate because Rabin and Assad &quot; are the kind of people that , if they are going_to do a deal , they want everything very clearly understood. &quot; Christopher also said Assad assured him that Syria strongly supports U.S military measures intended to prevent Iraq from repeating its 1990 invasion of Kuwait . Syria sent troops to the U.S-led international force that thwarted the earlier Iraqi aggression . Following his talks with Assad , Christopher flew to Amman , where he won a ringing endorsement from King Hussein of Jordan for U.S. efforts to head_off an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait . After the news_conference , Christopher aides said the king ' s reaction was much stronger than they had anticipated before the secretary_of_state and the monarch met over dinner at the royal palace . Hussein expressed &quot; very deep sadness , disappointment and anger &quot; at the Iraqi troop movements , which he said will undermine any chance Iraq may have had to obtain relief from the United Nations ' economic sanctions . He said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein ' s maneuver was &quot; totally irresponsible. &quot; Although the king insisted that his nation never supported Iraq ' s 1990 invasion of Kuwait , Amman was widely regarded_as sympathetic to Baghdad . Iraq was then able to circumvent a U.N.-imposed embargo , largely with Jordanian complicity . This time , however , the king said his country would &quot; stand_in the face of &quot; Iraqi aggression .</TEXT>
