   <TEXT> More_than a_million visitors a year are drawn to this tiny , tranquil island off Florida ' s southwest coast , and rarely do any of them leave without a_few souvenir seashells . Indeed , this barrier island jutting into the Gulf_of_Mexico has a reputation as one of the world ' s shelling hot spots , where even a novice beachcomber might find a calico scallop or a fighting conch . But take it from Rita Groh , the shelling on Sanibel is not what it once was . &quot; I haven ' t seen anything rare on the beach for the last five years , &quot; says Groh , who with her husband moved here from Greenwich , Conn. , in 1972 . &quot; The shells made us famous . But I wonder : If there aren ' t any shells here , will the tourists still come ? &quot; Alarmed by an apparent decline in the number of shells that wash_up on the beaches here -- and haunted by questions like Groh ' s -- city officials have taken action . A law that bans the collecting of any live shells from Sanibel ' s nine-mile beachfront has been approved by the Florida Marine Fisheries Commission , and is expected to be signed into law by Gov . Lawton Chiles , effective Jan . 1 . The ban on taking live shells is believed to be the first such law in the United States , and tightens a county-wide restriction that limits collectors to two live shells per species per day . No one has ever been prosecuted under that 1987 statute , however , and in fact the law is considered unenforceable . But Sanibel ' s proposed ban isn ' t . &quot; We ' re not going_to be walking the beaches and inspecting kids ' buckets , &quot; said Rob Loflin , the city ' s natural_resources director . &quot; But we see some real wasteful practices out there , people taking massive quantities of shells . So our police would enforce this rule. &quot; On a laid-back island known for its broad , sugar-sand beaches and a sea so calm that only a hurricane can make_it roar , the live-shelling law has stirred a storm of emotion . R . Tucker Abbott , a former Smithsonian Institution conchologist and expert on the 275 varieties of mollusks found in the waters near here , ridicules the law as &quot; screwy , extreme. &quot; He says the ban is being promoted by &quot; people who are fanatical modern ecologists , the kind for whom conservation becomes a religion . They make their decisions on emotion. &quot; Abbott , director of a shell museum scheduled to open next year here , says the Gulf waters are rich with mollusks , which thrive along an 80-mile-wide band of continental_shelf paralleling the Florida coast . &quot; There is an impression that there are fewer shells today , &quot; Abbott said . &quot; That may be true for the first 100 yards out. &quot; Commercial shellers , who dredge the ocean for whelks , cockle shells and sand_dollars for_sale to gift_shops , also oppose the law . Supporters of the live shelling ban concede that the law is as much symbolic as it is efficacious . &quot; There is not a lot of biological information , &quot; says Lee Schlesinger , a spokesman for the Marine Fisheries Commission . &quot; But we are erring on the side of conservation . We have a valuable resource that is still healthy and abundant , and we want to keep it that way. &quot; Conservationist Bob Slayton of the local Audubon Society says he hopes the law will instill a respect for marine wildlife among those who haul_away trash bags full of shells that end_up as borders around flower beds , in the base of a table_lamp , or in the attic . &quot; I think people who pick_up live shells and take them home are no different from those who shoot wild animals and hang their heads on the wall , &quot; said Slayton , a physician . &quot; They ' re trophy hunters. &quot; The beaches of Sanibel , the neighboring island of Captiva or anywhere along Florida ' s west coast are not short of shells . Millions of dead mollusks wash_up daily , and the sight of scores of people performing what here is called the &quot; Sanibel stoop &quot; -- a beachcomber bent at the waist and reaching for a colorful treasure in the sand -- is familiar testament to the allure of one of nature ' s most fascinating animals . But despite an abundance of empty shells , collectors often prefer live mollusks , with shells richer_in color and less likely to be damaged . Many resorts here , in fact , seem to encourage live shelling by providing guests with facilities to boil mollusks to kill the animal inside . Loflin says the ban on live shelling should have no effect on tourism here . &quot; Surveys indicate that 85 % of residents and tourists support the law , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
