   <TEXT> In a move that could score critical_points with the_French government , Walt Disney Co . said Friday that it is creating a company within its Miramax Films unit to promote the distribution of French films in the United States . Disney , which will also increase cartoon production in Paris , is providing about $ 6 million in start-up funds for the company . It will invest $ 20 to $ 30 million more each year in European co-productions . Disney denied that the announcement was linked to recent U.S.-French cultural tensions or designed as a public relations move to help its ailing Euro Disney theme park outside Paris . Nonetheless , Hollywood executives said the move could help blunt French hostility toward Hollywood and curb efforts to limit the number of American movies and TV_shows available in France . The announcement comes less than a year after the U.S. entertainment_industry was excluded from the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . Saying that American products overwhelm the_French market , French officials have called_for limiting American audiovisual imports . The French film_industry , which ranks fourth in the world , is declining in almost every market abroad , according to a July report by France ' s National Cinematography Center . In addition to financing about five movies a year , the new Miramax subsidiary -- headed Miramax Vice_President Agnes Mentre -- will dub some movies into English and release classic French films in the United States . &quot; French cinema has entertained and enlightened filmgoers for 100 years now . Our impulse is to broaden that in America , &quot; Vice_Chairman Roy E . Disney said . The new company , tentatively called Miramax Zoe , will provide support to money-strapped French directors and allow U.S. side to provide advice early in the filmmaking process , Miramax co-President Harvey Weinstein said . &quot; With Disney financing , Miramax will acquire films at the script stage , &quot; he said . &quot; In past investments there has never been any input or suggestions on casting. &quot; Immediate plans are to release a subtitled version of Patrice Chereau ' s &quot; La Reine Margot &quot; ( Queen Margot ) starring Isabelle Adjani .</TEXT>
