   <TEXT> President Clinton , Queen Elizabeth_II and a shipload of Allied leaders sailed in a massive flotilla late Sunday from this historic English_Channel port for France to observe the 50th anniversary of D-day . En route , the fleet dropped wreaths in the Channel . Two million red poppies , symbolizing remembrance , fluttered down from a low-flying Lancaster bomber . The armada planned to anchor offshore before going_on to the five D-day beaches -- two American , two British and one Canadian -- where the great northern European assault against Nazi forces to end World_War_II was launched . In a commemorative message that had overtones of Gen . Dwight D . Eisenhower ' s message to the troops on D-day , Clinton declared : &quot; The heroic men who fought and died during those difficult days helped to give_rise to a new era of hope and progress , starting a trend toward democracy and human dignity that continues to this day . &quot; The peoples of nations around the world persist_in throwing_off the shackles of tyranny and in seeking the blessings of liberty . On this historic occasion , we , the benefactors of the freedom won by our courageous armed forces , rededicate ourselves to embracing these epic changes . &quot; In memory of all those who lost their lives on Normandy ' s shore , we reaffirm our commitment to building a safer , more peaceful world for the generations to come. &quot; The fleet of ships steamed Sunday afternoon from this main invasion supply port after daylong ceremonies . The seaside was lined with tens of thousands of Britons and Americans , young and old , who turned_out to see off the armada heading for Normandy . They waved farewell to the ships , watching as they moved past concrete forts in the harbor , just as previous generations had done at this ancient navy town . Many with binoculars could spot the national_flags of the warships and call_out the identifications to their children . A vendor moved among the crowd chanting , &quot; Cockles , mussels , prawns. &quot; Many families picnicked on the green lawns of the seafront in a festive Sunday outing , listening to radios describing the events . Clinton boarded the nuclear-powered carrier George_Washington -- at 97 # 000 tons , the world ' s largest -- whose crew he addressed after he was piped aboard in the afternoon . Earlier , Queen Elizabeth , with many visiting heads_of_state and government , boarded the royal yacht Britannia to review warships of the Allied nations that participated in the D-day landings June 6 , 1944 . Among those present were British Prime_Minister John Major , Canadian Prime_Minister Jean Chretien , Polish President Lech Walesa , Czech President Vaclav Havel , Slovakian President Michal Kovac , Australian Prime_Minister Paul Keating , New Zealand Prime_Minister Jim Bolger , King Harald of Norway , King Albert II of Belgium and Prince Bernhard of the_Netherlands . They were joined by members of the_British Royal_Family , including Princess Diana . The yacht arrived in France later to the cheers of thousands of well-wishers . In contrast to the drenching , cold_weather that dampened the spirits of Saturday ' s ceremonies , the weather in Portsmouth on Sunday was crisp and clear , though changeable . The morning began here with a Drumhead Ceremony , which was once the traditional religious observance to bless the colors and uplift the hearts of the soldiers and sailors -- &quot; at the point at which troops cannot be pulled_back from the battle. &quot; The Archbishop of Canterbury , assisted by a dozen other clergymen , blessed the fleet that was preparing to leave for Normandy and large-scale , daylong observances and events today . Senior U.S. military_officers , including members of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , attended the ceremony -- which was also watched by thousands of visitors . Afterward , the dignitaries boarded the Britannia , a royal-blue vessel with tan funnels and masts . The ship ' s crew of 276 includes the band of the Royal Marines , which played to welcome Clinton and his fellow leaders and their spouses . As an estimated 4 # 000 small craft , from yachts to dinghies to motor launches , bobbed_around the bigger warships , 40 ships participated in the naval review -- including the Canberra , a luxury_liner that ferried British fighting battalions to the Falkland Islands , and the Fearless , which carried Royal Marine commandos in that action . The fleet review was preceded with a flyover by World_War_II aircraft : an old biplane Swordfish torpedo bomber , British Spitfire and Hawker Hurricane fighters , a U.S. B-17 Flying Fortress bomber , a P-51 Mustang fighter and a C-47 Dakota transport -- followed by low-flying modern jet fighters from Allied nations , some forming the number &quot; 50. &quot; Clinton boarded the Jeremiah O ' Brien , a World_War_II Liberty_ship that made 11 Channel crossings during the invasion . Taken_out of mothballs , it had sailed from San Francisco last month with a volunteer crew of veteran merchant seamen on board . About 20 minutes before Clinton boarded the George_Washington , Capt . Robert Sprigg told the crew over the loudspeaker that listening to the President was &quot; a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and I hope to see you there . I encourage everybody , I mean everybody , to go and hear his own ideas and what he ' d like to say to you. &quot; On board , the President , apparently seeking to show his support for the armed forces , told the crew : &quot; You are , beyond question , the best-trained , the best-equipped fighting force the world has ever known . And I want you to know that I am committed unequivocally , absolutely , to ensuring that you continue to have what you need to do your job . You deserve it . Our security demands it. &quot; Clinton added : &quot; The strength of our military is not really in our ships , our tanks or our aircraft , it is in you -- the dedicated professionalism of the men and women of the United States armed forces. &quot; That remark was greeted by applause , as was the President ' s statement to the sailors that the downsizing of the military was now halfway finished and would be completed in two years . &quot; If we learned any lesson from the magnificent , heroic , almost unbelievable endeavor of D-day , &quot; Clinton said , &quot; it was that if the Allies would stay_together and stay strong , we would never need another D-day . That is what you are guaranteeing . And your country is deeply in your debt. &quot; As for his own feelings about D-day during his trip so far , the President added : &quot; You know what encapsulates this all for me ? Eisenhower ' s words , in which he said that D-day was ' the fury of an aroused democracy. ' Those words say it all. &quot;</TEXT>
