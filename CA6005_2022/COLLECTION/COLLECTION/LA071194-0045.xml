   <HEADLINE> YELTSIN BALKS AT TROOP PULLOUT FROM ESTONIA ; SUMMIT : HE STEALS THE G-7 SHOW , DEMANDING BETTER ECONOMIC TREATMENT . GROUP URGES BOSNIA ACCORD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the world ' s great_powers embraced him as a near-equal at their summit Sunday , Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin demanded better economic treatment from abroad and bluntly denied that he plans to withdraw his last troops from the Baltics . In a scene-stealing performance near the close of the industrial nations ' three-day gathering , Yeltsin declared at a news_conference with President Clinton that he cannot commit to withdrawing the last 2 # 500 Russian troops from Estonia until that nation pledges better treatment for its large Russian minority . And he complained that the peers who are now accepting Russia into their institutions have been tardy in taking_down Cold War-era trade_barriers . &quot; Let ' s give us equal rights . Get rid , once and for all , of that red jacket ! &quot; Yeltsin declared , referring to the Soviet-era curbs . &quot; Take that red jacket from the president of Russia ! &quot; Yeltsin left dour Soviet-style presentation in the dust , teasing his questioners and stealing the limelight with a series of one-liners and lighthearted banter . Asked whether he plans to finally withdraw his Baltic troops , Yeltsin answered wryly : &quot; Nyet ! I like that question -- because I can answer no. &quot; While he does plan to remove remaining Russian troops from Latvia by Aug . 31 , following a signed agreement , he said that &quot; the situation is different in Estonia because there are very crude violations of human rights. &quot; Russian and Baltic officials have been wrangling since the Baltic_republics gained independence three years ago over the treatment of thousands of former Soviet troops and their families , whom other residents of Latvia , Lithuania and Estonia long viewed_as the agents of an occupying foreign power . For example , Estonians have been debating proposals that would effectively deprive many ethnic Russians of citizenship by requiring knowledge of the highly complex Estonian language as a precondition . Yeltsin ' s peppery comments came amid declarations of the growing harmony between the Russians and the leaders of the Group of Seven -- the United States , Germany , Italy , Britain , France , Canada and Japan . Once their adversary , Yeltsin met with them Sunday for political discussions as a full partner in what is now referred to as the &quot; political Group of Eight. &quot; In a final communique , the group called_on the parties in the 27-month-old Bosnian war to accept by July 18 a partition plan that would give the Bosnian Muslims and Croats 51 % of the country and the Bosnian Serbs the remaining 49 % . The communique -- along with a variety of personal statements by the leaders -- was designed to increase pressure on the Bosnian Serbs , who have long balked at a settlement that would require them to surrender hard-fought territorial gains . The leaders also called_on North_Korea to resume suspended negotiations with the United States over its nuclear program , and to go_ahead with a scheduled summit with South_Korean officials . The negotiations were broken_off Saturday after the death of President Kim Il Sung , but U.S. officials said in Geneva that they might restart soon after Kim ' s funeral next Sunday . Yeltsin ' s comments served notice that despite a much-proclaimed new sweetness in Russia ' s relations with the industrial powers , he intends to keep speaking freely -- particularly because it will help him counter recurring criticism at_home that he has made too many concessions to foreigners . Yeltsin ' s words left his aides glowing with satisfaction but seemed to contradict declarations from Clinton minutes earlier that Russia and Estonia had &quot; narrowed their differences &quot; and might agree on the troops ' departure in the &quot; near future. &quot; Clinton announced that he had helped arrange a meeting between Yeltsin and Estonian President Lennart Meri , which he said he hoped will open the way for final troop departures by the end of August . The Russian president ' s pronouncement was also likely to set_off new alarms in the Baltics , where government leaders and the non-Russian public have been determined to see a final withdrawal of the Russians by Aug . 31 . One U.S. official , smiling ruefully , acknowledged that Yeltsin ' s pungent commentary &quot; was not part of any pre-scripted &quot; presentation that was to follow the two leaders ' afternoon talks . &quot; That was a freewheeling press_conference , &quot; the official said with a sigh . But U.S. aides said they considered the comments a negotiating tactic and that they also understood Yeltsin ' s need to display his independence in_order to put_off criticism at_home , including from his ultranationalist rivals . &quot; This is a vintage performance from a guy who ' s having a good_day , &quot; one U.S. official said . &quot; This is also for domestic consumption. &quot; Another said Clinton himself found the episode amusing proof of Yeltsin ' s political skills . And U.S. officials insisted that despite Yeltsin ' s bravado , they expect the Russians to withdraw fully by the end of August . The United States has tried to ensure that withdrawal by providing 2 # 500 grants worth $ 25 # 000 each for former Soviet troops . Referring to Clinton repeatedly as &quot; Bill , &quot; Yeltsin asserted that Russia is no longer the supplicant that has approached the advanced nations repeatedly since the fall of communism to ask financial assistance . Even so , he got_in a jab at the Group of Seven nations for failing to deliver fully on the $ 4.34 billion they pledged at last year ' s summit in Tokyo . &quot; It hurts a little bit &quot; that Russia hadn ' t so far received even half the money it was promised a year ago , Yeltsin lamented . This year , Yeltsin came_away from the summit with promises of only about $ 3.5 billion in new loans , and even that is dependent_on modification of some rules of the International Monetary Fund and the World_Bank . Yeltsin ' s specific economic grievance was that the United States has so far not dismantled Cold War-era laws intended to keep Communist countries from obtaining computer and aerospace technology that could be used to make weapons . &quot; This has to do with a certain discrimination toward Russia in trade , &quot; Yeltsin said . U.S. officials said the government intends to eliminate those Cold War-era export controls but has not gotten_around_to doing so . Officials intend to replace them with a new international rubric for controlling militarily valuable exports to pariah nations . Russia would be a member of the international group . For Clinton , the summit was marred by the rejection of an Administration proposal intended to lead to a further lowering of trade_barriers -- an initiative most other Group of Seven leaders feared would complicate passage in their parliaments of the latest round of the global treaty called the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . The final day of the summit displayed the mixed views Clinton ' s peers hold of his leadership . While Yeltsin spoke warmly of Clinton , French President Francois Mitterrand offered a milder assessment . Mitterrand , who Saturday led the hasty rebuff of Clinton ' s trade initiative , said in a briefing that Clinton is &quot; young , and not unintelligent. &quot; U.S. aides , meanwhile , said the downbeat assessments of Clinton ' s performance overlooked his behind-the-scenes efforts , including his successful effort to make other leaders commit to what turned_out to be a $ 4-billion package of benefits for Ukraine . Other European officials acknowledged that Clinton had , in fact , pressed for the commitment , which is expected to give Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk an important boost . The Group of Seven leaders spoke loudest on Bosnia-Herzegovina . Yeltsin said the group will act with &quot; as much character as we have in our bodies. &quot; In the negotiations , Yeltsin was also emphatic on the need to stop a war that has claimed an estimated 200 # 000 lives . At one point , he clasped his hands in front of himself and said , &quot; We ' re together on this ; we ' re going to get_it done. &quot; British Prime_Minister John Major warned that &quot; the risk of this war spreading is very real. &quot; The final statement carried an implicit threat that the group will lift the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims if the Serbian fighters do not go_along . Officials said the group discussed North_Korea , including the murky question of who will succeed Kim Il Sung . The communique called_on the country to &quot; remove , once and for all , the suspicions surrounding its nuclear activities. &quot; But the G-7 leaders did not agree on what they will do if North_Korea ' s new leadership ignores pressure on the country to end its nuclear program .</TEXT>
