   <TEXT> MOVIES Stonewall , the Movie : The Stonewall riot of 1969 will be re-created complete with crowds , cops and drag queens beginning tonight in New York City as part of the filming of &quot; Stonewall , &quot; a BBC movie about the incident at the Greenwich_Village bar that was linked to the beginning of the gay rights movement . Production began two weeks ago on the film that tells the story of six gay_men in New York in the days leading_up to the riots . In addition to exploring the men ' s relationships , the film will recount the bloody rioting that occurred between gay_men and police at the Stonewall Inn during the weekend Judy Garland was buried . But because the owner of the Stonewall would not allow film crews to shoot in front of the original bar in the Village ' s Sheridan Square , the pivotal riot scenes will be filmed nearby in a re-created square .

I ought to care more about what ' s right than I do about what ' s popular . . . .

They ought to care more about what ' s right than what ' s popular . . . . Because if they don ' t , then maybe they don ' t belong in elected office in the first place. &quot; Rival candidate Larry Furlong called the use &quot; borrowing at best , plagiarism at worst. &quot; Said Adams : &quot; I saw something in a movie that made_sense to me , so I used it .
