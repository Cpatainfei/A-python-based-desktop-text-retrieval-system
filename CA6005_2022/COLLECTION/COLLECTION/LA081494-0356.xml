   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : MID-CITY : KOREATOWN ; FORUM SEEKS PEACEFUL END TO KOREA CONFLICT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A peaceful solution to the nuclear arms tensions between the United States and North_Korea was the primary focus of a recent education forum at the Korean Youth and Student_Union . About 40 students , peace activists and other concerned Korean Americans gathered to discuss the situation , questioning the veracity of recent reports that point to the existence of nuclear_weapons in North_Korea and trying to determine whether there is a threat of war . Participants in the July 28 forum also discussed the need felt by many Korean Americans to replace the Korean_War Armistice -- approved as a cease-fire treaty on July 27 , 1953 -- with a binding peace_treaty among the United States , North_Korea and South_Korea . &quot; It ' s been almost half a century since the Korean_peninsula was divided , &quot; said Yong Un Yuk , of the Korean Youth and Student_Union . &quot; Now even in the Middle_East , there is talk_of peace. &quot; In light of the current weapons scare , Yuk said , a Korean peace_treaty is especially necessary . &quot; According to the U.S. , the war can resume at any moment , &quot; he said , adding that Korean Americans all_over the country have begun to fear the worst . Following presentations by a number of speakers , organizers introduced a petition they plan to circulate calling_for support of negotiation efforts to lessen tensions between the United States and North_Korea , as well as for normalization of relations and reunification of the Korean_peninsula . Addressed to the U.S. , North_Korean and South_Korean governments , the petitions will be circulated by Korean peace activists nationwide , forum leaders said . Minsu Lee , a Korean immigrant , said reunification would spur a morale boost in Korean communities nationwide . &quot; If any of my children ask me , ' Where are you from , Papa , ' I have to point to the south , &quot; he said . &quot; I want to be able to show them the whole country. &quot; LESLIE BERESTEIN</TEXT>
