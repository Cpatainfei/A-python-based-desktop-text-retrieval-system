   <TEXT> Norway ' s Harald Christian Strand-Nilsen may have the longest name of any Olympic medal_winner . But it doesn ' t end there for the bronze-medal winner in Alpine combined skiing . &quot; My family calls me Christian , &quot; he says . &quot; At school they call me Harald . The team calls me Harry or Boris . New friends call me Brother , because that ' s what my sister calls me . Choose from that what you want. &quot; Anything else ? &quot; My family calls me Harald Christian when they ' re mad at me. &quot; * After Norway had received the Olympic bid in 1988 , the government underwrote $ 100 million to the country ' s sports program , hoping to increase its medal chances . The plan afforded Norway the chance to hire former Austrian coach Dieter Bartsch to run the Alpine program . It paid_off . Norway won its third , fourth and fifth Alpine medals Friday . Now , there is talk that the Alpine budget will be cut after the Olympics . &quot; I think the training will not be so good anymore , &quot; Strand-Nilsen said . &quot; There are not so many people ( Alpine ) skiing in Norway . We need the racers we have. &quot; * You won ' t hear any complaints from the Norwegians about the new rules_in scoring the combined , weighing the slalom more heavily than the downhill . &quot; It makes_it easier for the public to understand what ' s going_on , &quot; Lasse Kjus , the combined gold-medal winner , said . &quot; And to make_it exciting to look at. &quot; * After posting the second-fastest time in the combined downhill , Kyle Rasmussen gave it his best shot in the slalom , but missed a gate on the first run , hiked back_up to re-ski it and finished in 1 minute 8.24 seconds , 17 seconds off the pace . He finished 31st . &quot; You can ' t be conservative to win a medal , &quot; said Rasmussen , from Angels Camp , Calif . &quot; In the Olympics , the only thing that counts is the top three . that ' s what I was going for. &quot; Rasmussen , who had not raced a slalom this season , admitted he was ready to return to downhill . &quot; After five days on slalom skis , I ' m ready to go straight again , &quot; he said .
