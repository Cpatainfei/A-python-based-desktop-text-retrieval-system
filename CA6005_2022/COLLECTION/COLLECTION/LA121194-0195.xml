   <HEADLINE> LINDSAY DAVENPORT MAY NOT BE COMFORTABLE WITH FAME , BUT AMERICA ' S TOP-RANKED WOMEN ' S TENNIS_PLAYER CONTINUES TO . . . ; SHINE IN THE SPOTLIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This won ' t do at all . The top-ranked American woman tennis_player is not behaving in a manner equal_to her station . She is_on the court hitting , but shagging her own balls . A photographer is seeking to place the No . 6-ranked player in the world in all manner of awkward positions and she ' s complying with good_humor . A reporter has been hanging_around the Newport Beach tennis_club for hours and the player doesn ' t mind . It ' s enough to give tennis a good name . There are no entourage , no smarmy agents and no bejeweled small dogs . Just Lindsay Davenport and her 18-year-old self , full of an athlete ' s killer confidence and a teen-ager ' s self-doubt . This is the new_wave , America ' s no-problem champion . BRIGHT LIGHTS , BIG CITY The setting : Madison Square Garden , New York City . The finals of the Virginia Slims Championships . Television . Across the net is the tour ' s pouty heart-throb , Gabriela Sabatini , who even while sweating -- maybe especially while sweating -- exudes a healthy glamour . Gabby , with her perky nickname and a smile that blinds , is clearly the crowd favorite . And here you are . Your hair does not cascade , it meekly agrees to be ponytailed . Your sweat does not make you glow , it only makes you damp . You are acutely aware that you are 6 feet 3 and scrunch down . Your white tennis skirt feels too short and you absently tug on it . You wish everyone would stop looking_at you . Lindsay Davenport loves the part where you play tennis and get_to smack the ball but she doesn ' t care_for the time between points . She has adopted a stony stoicism on court , giving the impression that she has the nervous_system of a clam . Not true . She ' s roiling with emotion . But Davenport believes that if she pumps her fist after a winner , she ' ll somehow embarrass her opponent . Her father would scold her if she yelled at a linesman . The idea of doing a racket-flung-to-the-roof celebratory dance after winning a match is humiliating even to think_about . After she lost to Sabatini in New York , Davenport was happy to meet the press . She thinks that players who don ' t meet their obligations are spoiled . She chatted on about her great_year , her second as a pro , and how nice it was to end the season on a high note . Davenport , who grew_up in Palos Verdes , talked_about high_school and her impending vacation to Hawaii and smiled and laughed with ease . When the public can see Davenport like this , as an engaging , intelligent young_woman who is relentlessly normal , it might take_to her . But so far in her brief career , few can get past Lindsay the Tall or Lindsay the Big . It was like that at the U.S. Open in September . With Martina Navratilova skipping the final Grand_Slam tournament of the year , Davenport suddenly was thrust into the spotlight as the highest ranked American woman at her country ' s national championships . She had just graduated from high_school , had just turned 18 . Much was expected of Davenport and when she lost in the third round to Mana Endo of Japan , it was not because of her inexperience . It became an issue of her fitness -- the code word for weight . &quot; A lot of awful things were written_about me , &quot; Davenport said , still not comprehending . &quot; Like , I ' m too fat . I ' m too slow . I didn ' t understand why they wrote that . It ' s not like I ' m eating cheeseburgers all_the time . I had a hard_time right after the Open . I had a hard_time dealing with it . &quot; I freaked_out . I hated it . I didn ' t want to play . I kept thinking , ' I ' m not even one of the top players and I hate this . What must it be like for Steffi ( Graf ) ? ' I stopped reading anything. &quot; Davenport lists her weight at 165 . There is a fullness in her face but she appears trim . For the last few months , she has been working with a fitness coach , as much to develop speed as_to lose_weight . Lynne Rolley , the U.S. Tennis Assn. ' s director of women ' s coaching , began working with Davenport when the player was 12 . Conditioning has always been a priority . &quot; She ' s got constant work to do on that , &quot; Rolley said . &quot; It ' s something she has to address . It ' s difficult for her with her size . It ' s important to be mobile and strong. &quot; So_much attention has been paid to her weight , however , that it ' s often forgotten that Davenport is still young and her body , whatever it may become , is still forming . &quot; I would say that she needs to lose 10 pounds , at most , &quot; Billie Jean King said . &quot; She ' s 100 % slow twitch ( muscle_fiber ) , so her weight has nothing to do with her speed . that ' s genetics . Who cares ? The good thing is that she doesn ' t have an eating disorder . Be thankful for that . I say , leave her alone . Let her be happy. &quot; SHE WHO STOOPS TO CONQUER If U.S. tennis officials had watched Davenport hit golf_balls at a driving range for the first time last week , they would have wanted to throw a sheet over her and spirit her off the course , lest the club pro see her . The kid can hit a golf_ball . She also can hit a tennis_ball . You might say Davenport is a natural hitter . On the court , she hits the ball cleanly and hard . Her ground_strokes are solid and she shows signs of developing the power in her ever-improving serve to go_along with the rest of her game . Davenport got her early tennis training from Robert Lansdorp and when her family moved to Murietta while she was in high_school , she began to work with Robert Van ' t Hof at the Palisades Tennis_Club in Newport Beach , as well as Rolley , who often traveled with her . Beginning this week , Davenport will work with Craig Kardon , who along with King , coached Navratilova . Kardon will be able to spend more time on_tour with Davenport . The American tennis Establishment is watching Davenport with unmasked excitement . In Davenport they have a star with her feet on the ground who appears to be able to withstand the physical and emotional rigors of the tour . Davenport , who earned more_than $ 600 # 000 in prize_money this year , does not think_of herself as being rich and lives a modest lifestyle with few extravagances . &quot; Money doesn ' t blow me away , I make enough , &quot; Davenport said . &quot; It ' s so abnormal . This is the only sport where a 14-year-old is making all_the money for her parents and grandparents . It ' s gonna mess them up , if not now , then in 10 years. &quot; Her parents , Ann and Wink Davenport , say they have made a conscious effort not to raise a &quot; tennis brat. &quot; When she travels with her daughter , rather than delivering a pep speech before the match , Ann Davenport will ask Lindsay what movie she wants to see afterward . Lindsay gets her height from her parents . Ann is 5-10 and Wink 6-8 . Davenport does that shrinkage thing that some woman athletes do -- she fibs about her height , listing it as 6-2 in the WTA media guide . And she slouches to make herself seem smaller . Pam Shriver , one of the tallest players on the tour at 6-1 , said she sees some of herself in Davenport and knows the pain . &quot; I see her stooping and I want to tell her to straighten_up , &quot; Shriver said . &quot; I remember when I was 17-18 , I wasn ' t comfortable with my height . I stood_out and I was miserable . In public life , you need a thick_skin . No way anyone should be anything but nice to her . She ' s one of the nicest kids on the tour . She ' s very popular . But you know what ? No one ' s safe . People will pick. &quot; If she is left alone , Davenport ' s potential may shine through . Navratilova said she thinks Davenport will win a Grand_Slam tournament . If Davenport is allowed to be herself , a funny and outgoing person among her friends , then she might be spared tennis ' trash_heap reserved for teen phenoms . If no one else gets_it , at least she does . &quot; I ' m uncomfortable with the attention , &quot; Davenport said . &quot; I ' m not really adjusted to the whole scene . I can walk the street and hear people whispering , ' that ' s Lindsay Davenport. ' It makes me so uncomfortable . I don ' t handle it well . Some people think that ' s snobby , but it ' s really because I ' m uncomfortable . &quot; You have to have someone helping you keep a_level head . Otherwise , you ' d go_around thinking , ' Oh yeah , I ' m the greatest . I won a tennis match. ' The reality is that it doesn ' t mean anything to 99 % of the people in the world. &quot;</TEXT>
