   <HEADLINE> MAGAZINE CALLS IRVINE SAFEST LARGE CITY IN U.S. ; CRIME : MONEY AWARDS NO . 1 RANKING IN OVER-100 # 000 POPULATION CATEGORY . THE FBI EARLIER THIS MONTH DESIGNATED IT AS SEVENTH-SAFEST , USING A DIFFERENT FORMULA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Local realtor Dale Cheema hasn ' t had too_much trouble selling houses lately , and he ' s pretty sure he knows why . * On Tuesday , he learned that the June issue of Money magazine had named Irvine the safest large city in the country in terms of violent crime . That designation came_after FBI released statistics earlier this month which showed Irvine to be the seventh-safest in the United States with a population over 100 # 000 . &quot; People want to be in a safe neighborhood and enjoy a better standard_of_living , &quot; said Cheema , president of the Irvine Board of Realtors . &quot; After news of ( the FBI ranking ) spread , I had a lot of people from the L.A. area coming_in who want to raise their kids in a safer area. &quot; The magazine combined population data with the FBI ' s statistics on violent crimes -- including murder , rape , robbery and aggravated assault -- to come_up with the rankings , which place Irvine first among 187 cities with populations over 100 # 000 . The magazine ' s rankings are based only on violent crimes while the FBI ' s rankings also included crimes such_as robbery , burglary , larceny and auto theft . &quot; It ' s an overall plus to the city , &quot; said Mayor Michael Ward . &quot; Everyone is pretty happy about it . I think it says an awful lot about Irvine . Crime is the No . 1 concern among people nowadays , and we are dedicated to keeping it a safe community. &quot; Ward and other city officials attributed the city ' s nationwide reputation for safety to a variety of factors including a highly educated , well-trained police_force ; urban_planning that separates residential enclaves from high-traffic streets ; a strong school_system and active participation from residents . &quot; It ' s a combined effort , &quot; Ward said . &quot; It ' s a great town and everyone has to take_part to keep it that way. &quot; Police_Chief Charles S . Brobeck said part of the low crime_rate in this city of 110 # 000 residents can be attributed to a strong Neighborhood Watch program that he said reflects a citywide intolerance of criminal activity . &quot; We make a lot of apprehensions and arrests based on what people report to us , &quot; Brobeck said . &quot; It helps a lot . I think the overall attitude among residents is that they ' re not going_to tolerate that kind of thing . There is not a sense of apathy. &quot; The magazine ' s rankings are based on 1993 statistics , a year in which Irvine had one homicide victim . That was Turtle Rock resident Patricia Lea Pratt , who apparently surprised a burglar in her home . Pratt ' s slaying , which has not been solved , was the fourth homicide in the city since 1990 , police said . Ward said the magazine ' s top ranking will help attract new residents and also help attract more businesses to the 43.6-square-mile , pre-planned city incorporated in 1971 . &quot; Businesses want to locate their office in a safe community , &quot; the mayor said . &quot; I also think recognition in a national , respected business magazine will help us keep the businesses that are here. &quot; For Cheema , who said he has sold eight houses in the past month , this latest accolade is a real_estate_agent ' s dream come true . &quot; When I have an open_house , I plan to bring the magazine_article with me , &quot; he said . &quot; I think it will help immensely. &quot;</TEXT>
