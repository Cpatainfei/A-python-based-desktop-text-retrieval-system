   <HEADLINE> PATIENT , HEAL THYSELF ? ; PRESCRIPTION_DRUG ADS HAVE SOME DOCS WINCING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> From Sports Illustrated to the subway , Americans are being bombarded with ads for powerful prescription medicines -- a commercial boom that has drug_companies smiling but doctors worried . &quot; Pretty soon they ' ll be_on milk cartons and hot-air_balloons , &quot; said Dr. William Jacott , whose patients have demanded prescriptions by name even before he diagnosed a disease . Suffering epileptic_seizures ? Fighting high cholesterol ? Afraid your prostate is enlarged ? The questions jump_off the pages of newspapers and magazines . The allergy reliever Claritin even advertises in New York subway cars , and hair grower Rogaine is all_over TV . Drug_companies say their multimillion-dollar ads make Americans better advocates for their health . &quot; The decision to prescribe a particular medication is a shared decision between doctor and patient , &quot; said John Montgomery of Parke Davis , which last week advertised its new epilepsy drug , Neurontin , in several major newspapers . The ads do advise seeing a doctor -- after all , the drugs are available only by prescription . But the American Medical Assn . says there ' s a fine line between educating and misleading vulnerable patients . &quot; The ones I ' ve seen are clearly quite commercial and don ' t necessarily give the whole story , &quot; said Jacott , an AMA trustee and family physician at the University of Minnesota . Patients &quot; come_in and put the pressure on their physicians to prescribe that product. &quot; Drug_companies have always advertised over-the-counter medicines aggressively . But until recently , they marketed more powerful prescription_drugs only to physicians . Salespeople dropped_off free samples , and ads full of complicated medical data dominated scholarly journals . &quot; That era is slowly fading , &quot; said Jack Trout , a marketing consultant in Greenwich , Conn . &quot; They ' re beginning to feel the docs . . . don ' t have time to schmooze . So they feel a need to build an equity with the ultimate user. &quot; Take Proscar , which shrinks enlarged prostates . Every year 4.5 million men over age 60 are diagnosed with prostate enlargement , which causes urinary problems . Although many never need treatment , they ' re reluctant to discuss symptoms . So Merck is blanketing magazines with ads aimed at men who wonder why they &quot; go_to the bathroom more_than ever now. &quot; Like other companies , Merck won ' t say what it spends advertising Proscar , which earns more_than $ 100 million a year . But a full-page ad in a national magazine can cost $ 115 # 000 , so campaigns add_up fast , said advertising expert Patricia Stout of the University of Texas at Austin . Proscar ' s success prompted Merck to advertise Mevacor , the world ' s leading cholesterol-lowering drug at $ 1 billion in sales . The ads target 6.5 million Americans who rely_on diet and exercise alone to fight high cholesterol , said Merck ' s Gary Bruell . Parke Davis followed Merck ' s lead last week , launching trial Neurontin ads in New York , Atlanta , Los Angeles , Chicago and Houston . If sales increase in those cities , the ads will spread . Neurontin may be an alternative for some of the thousands of epileptics who last month abandoned its competitor Felbatol , which can cause liver damage and fatal anemia . In fact , Parke Davis hired a publicist to push Neurontin when the Felbatol fiasco emerged . The Neurontin campaign carefully emphasizes that the drug has only a_few , minor side_effects . But the ads , which went_into production before Felbatol ' s problems appeared , don ' t specifically mention the competitor , Montgomery said . The AMA ' s Jacott said many drug ads , picturing smiling , healthy models , ignore side_effects and the fact that drugs are appropriate for only certain patients -- or they relegate it to medical jargon in the fine print . When patients miss the warnings and demand a drug , doctors have to spend a lot of time explaining why they disagree , said Dr. Jehan El-Bayoumi of George_Washington University ' s medical_center . &quot; It ' s very positive if people are more involved in their health_care , &quot; she warned , &quot; but there can be a negative consequence to the more commercial packaging of drugs. &quot;</TEXT>
