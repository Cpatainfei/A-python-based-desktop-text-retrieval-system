   <TEXT> If state environmental regulators have their way , Southern California -- the great heartland of the automobile -- will soon be home to the reborn electric_car . So it came as something of a surprise that among the stars of the 12th International Electric Vehicle Symposium , held here this year , were a massive contingent of experts from . . . France . A test under way in the small city of La Rochelle , 300 miles southwest of Paris , has yielded spectacular results . Jean-Yves Helmer , executive managing director of the automotive division of PSA Peugeot Citroen , said that French drivers have been profoundly touched by the small battery-driven cars known , in all languages , as EVs . &quot; The EV changed my life , &quot; one French driver told researchers , according to the elegantly straight-faced Helmer . Even the less-emotional apparently appreciate benefits such_as home charging , dependable starting no matter what the weather , and the calm of le silence on_the_road . The cars also help with the congenital national problem of aggressive driving , making city streets safer . The French have discovered &quot; a different kind of driving pleasure , &quot; Helmer averred . Economics help , too . France is fertile country for electric vehicles because most of its electricity is derived from cheap nuclear_power , while gasoline costs more_than three times the U.S. price . The French also live mostly in dense cities , with short commutes . La Rochelle ' s success has prompted 80 other French cities to sign_up for the experience , and the_French government has announced that it will spur EV production by subsidizing the higher cost of the electric_cars ( they now cost about $ 12 # 000 , up_to $ 4 # 000 more_than an equivalent gasoline car ) . Helmer says that EVs could be part of a strategy Peugeot is pondering for a possible re-entry of the U.S. market , from which French car_makers retreated in 1991 . * Japanese car_makers , who don ' t need to worry about U.S. market re-entry but do need to worry -- and soon -- about California clean-air mandates , were also out_in force at the show . All four of the Japanese auto_makers that must offer emission-free cars as 2 % of their showroom fleets by 1998 -- the same standard U.S. auto_companies must meet -- showed prototypes , some for the first time in the U.S. The cars -- mostly small station_wagons that are used for deliveries in Tokyo -- perform flawlessly around a parking-lot test course . But despite widespread rumors that the Japanese car_makers would announce provocative strategies to meet the California mandate , they used a joint press_conference to recount the history of electric_car research in their island nation . * The 1998 mandate is looming like a specter for all_the major auto_makers , who for all practical purposes must decide what to do_in the next several months . If they are going_to manufacture their own vehicles -- instead of meeting the California requirement by , say , purchasing and marketing cars built by a handful of small electric_car makers -- the big companies have only 2 1 / 2 years before electric_cars must be rolling_off the assembly_line -- an extremely tight schedule for the automotive world . John Wallace , Ford Motor Co . director of electric vehicle programs and chairman of the symposium , lamented the state of electric_car technology -- particularly the batteries . Though he praises the electric_car as &quot; an industry being born , &quot; for him and all_the other big car_makers , it is being born too soon . To meet the 1998 deadline , Ford should be going_to &quot; primary prototype . . . in a very few months , &quot; Wallace said . But he hasn ' t yet found an &quot; acceptable &quot; battery maker , vital to building the prototype . &quot; I ' m more conservative than many people , &quot; Wallace said wearily . &quot; It has to do with actually having to make the automobile. &quot; * Still , there were optimists aplenty at the show , and lots of evidence that electric_car technology is moving ahead rapidly : * An electric school_bus from the Antelope Valley was the oversized star of the show . Built by Blue Bird Corp . and Westinghouse Electronic Systems , and paid_for by the South Coast Air Quality Management District , it has been hauling school kids around the Southern California desert for almost six months . Antelope Valley Schools chief_executive Ken McCoy reports lower maintenance , improved safety and low fuel costs . * Solectria Corp. , an ambitious Massachusetts car converter , unveiled the Sunrise , designed to be built_in the automotive version of a micro-brewery . One of the small plants is planned for California , and Solectria hopes to sell the car for under $ 20 # 000 . * AC Propulsion , the small Southern California company run_by engineer Alan Cocconi , an electric_car wizard , is showing_off a 200-horsepower EV -- easily the muscle car of the show . It can do zero-to-60 in 6.2 seconds , which would be impressive even for a gasoline-powered car . When an engineer with one of the Big Three hit the accelerator during a test-drive , her startled_response was a well-known expletive .</TEXT>
