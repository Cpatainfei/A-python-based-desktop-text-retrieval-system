   <HEADLINE> TAVERNIER ' S GRITTY ' L.627 ' IS ONE OF HIS BEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With &quot; L.627 , &quot; a classic police procedural , France ' s formidable Bertrand Tavernier puts his mastery of storytelling to a severe test , yet succeeds triumphantly in involving us completely in a story with virtually no exposition or plot and that takes 145 minutes to tell . He straightaway plunges us into the grinding everyday existence of a veteran Parisian narcotics cop nicknamed Lulu ( Didier Bezace ) , a quietly dedicated man who becomes part of a small , ill-equipped drug squad headquartered in a cramped prefab structure , a site that speaks volumes about the status of their operation . On the surface Lulu is like his colleagues , who are good-humored , ordinary-looking , conscientious blue-collar guys . There ' s also a feisty woman ( Charlotte Kady ) . Their camaraderie is warm and solid in the face of their hotheaded , lazy and cynical boss ( Jean-Paul Comart ) . As we follow them on_the_job , enduring stakeouts in a stuffy van , collaring suspects -- sometimes brutally -- interviewing countless citizens , we gradually learn that Lulu has a beautiful , devoted wife ( Cecile Garcia-Fogel ) and small daughter who see little of him -- and a tender , loving concern for a waif-like young prostitute / junkie ( Lara Guirao ) . Lulu , in short , is a wonderful guy , and his life unfolds rigorously with Tavernier ' s typically acute powers of observation and attention to nuances and details . &quot; L.627 &quot; exudes the vitality and humor so characteristic of the director ' s work and glows with its ensemble portrayals . Tavernier ' s inspired cinematographer , Alain Choquart , takes us on a distinctly non-tourist trip through Paris ' seamiest , most dangerous areas with their ancient narrow streets . In fact , &quot; L.627 , &quot; which takes its name from the_French drug law , could be transferred intact to New York City . Always one to speak his mind in his films , Tavernier is here modestly saluting a decent cop -- and thereby such men everywhere -- intent upon doing his job despite a demoralizing police bureaucracy and widespread public indifference to the war against drugs . Tavernier , reportedly inspired by a brief brush with drugs experienced by his son Nils ( who plays one of the cops ) , has made one of his best films . * MPAA rating : Unrated .
