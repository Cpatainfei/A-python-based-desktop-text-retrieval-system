   <HEADLINE> THE SUNDAY PROFILE ; THE DALY AGENDA ; SURE SHE LIKES THE PERKS OF DATING THE MAYOR , BUT that ' s NOT WHAT SHE LIVES FOR . NANCY DALY SAVES HER REAL PASSION FOR KIDS IN DIRE STRAITS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What a curious license_plate , the mayor was thinking . &quot; What ' s beshert ? &quot; Richard Riordan asked press aide David Novak as they headed into a radio_station recently . &quot; You and Nancy are beshert , &quot; Novak said , defining the Hebrew word . &quot; When two souls are brought into the world , you ' re fated eventually to be together . And when you come_together , it ' s meant to be -- strong people and similar interests , from biking to children to taking_care of people . It ' s beshert . &quot; A week later , Nancy Daly , the mayor ' s beshert , arrives_at the Children ' s Museum . Her presence is as muted as the kid-packed building is raucous . She slips_in wearing a taupe pantsuit and pearls , her dark blond hair curling slightly beneath her chin . At first glance , Daly seems rather like the incarnation of two Southern Californias -- the fresh , pert looks of Gidget polished by the tasteful imperatives of Rodeo Drive . She ' s petite -- and remarkably trim , thanks in part to thrice-weekly visits from a personal trainer she met while helping at MacLaren Children ' s Center , the county ' s emergency foster_home in El Monte for abused and neglected kids . MacLaren might seem an odd place to find a fitness guru , but it ' s one of the capitals on Daly ' s map . The facility has been one of the most notable stops on her journey since her first visit 15 years ago . The ripples from that visit have been profound . Daly , 52 , went_on to become one of L.A. ' s most prominent children ' s activists , partly by harnessing substantial Hollywood contacts stemming from her 30-year marriage to Warner Bros . CEO Robert A . Daly . Nancy Daly helped start the United Friends of the Children , a charitable foundation that channels volunteers ' time and money to MacLaren ; she helped establish the county Department of Children ' s Services , and she served on the nonpartisan National Commission on Children , which recommended government policy reforms . Dr. Donald Cohen , director of the Yale Child Studies Center , served with Daly on the commission from 1989 to 1992 . &quot; She was the central , most important_person on the commission for adolescence and foster care and the transition from foster care to adulthood , &quot; he says . &quot; She brought this real personal engagement to thinking_about these children because she didn ' t relate to them in a professional capacity , but as a mentor and advocate and friend of children in foster care. &quot; In the course of helping children find some semblance of family life , and a little peace , Daly found more_than a personal trainer -- she found Riordan . He had lost two of his five children a decade ago -- his only son drowned and a daughter died of bulimia -- and Riordan was known for funneling his money and his drive into children ' s charities . ( They receive most of the $ 3 million he donates yearly. ) Daly and Riordan met about five years ago , when she asked him to fund a $ 20 # 000 computer reading lab at MacLaren . ( He did. ) Riordan was impressed : &quot; I thought she was somebody who obviously cared . I was very struck with her practical ability , that she knew how to implement things , which is rare among people , whether in government or charity. &quot; A couple years later , Daly and friends hit up Riordan for another donation , this time to help bankroll an immunization program for underprivileged children . He gave $ 25 # 000 . &quot; He got_on the speaker phone and rounded_up other people immediately who then gave us money , &quot; Daly says . &quot; It just happened when we sat there . It was very obvious that he does things immediately . He ' s a doer and doesn ' t put things off . I had never seen anybody operate that way before. &quot; Daly filed for divorce in November , 1991 , and her first date with Riordan was a Christmas holiday party at Union Station . &quot; When I found_out she was separated , &quot; Riordan says , &quot; I thought , ' This brilliant , beautiful caring human_being , I ought to do something about that. ' &quot; Says Daly : &quot; I think both of us have lived full lives . We ' ve had a lot of experiences , and sometimes I think we ' ve been in training for each other. &quot; He had been footloose since his separation five years ago from his second wife , Jill . But Daly has been the official First Significant Other from the start of his Administration , appearing by his side at the July , 1993 , inauguration . They live apart -- Daly in an airy , 15-room home_in Bel-Air , and Riordan , 64 today , in a $ 6-million French Colonial house in Brentwood -- and see each other , she says , &quot; as often as possible. &quot; That often translates to five days a week , for city and charity functions or that scarce resource , leisure : biking , reading , or spending time with family or friends . Making the date is no easy feat . &quot; It ' s a complicated procedure , &quot; Daly says . &quot; It takes his office and my secretary a lot of planning . They talk to each other a_couple_of times a day to coordinate. &quot; Both Daly and Riordan are Catholics , and the mayor ' s personal life has caused ripples in the Catholic community . The Los Angeles archdiocesan newspaper , the Tidings , recently published this query from an &quot; ordinary divorced Catholic &quot; : &quot; Given that the mayor has been married twice , is separated from his wife , has been keeping_company with a married_woman , and is ' pro-choice ' regarding abortion , how can he receive Communion ? &quot; Father Gregory Coiro responded that separated and divorced Catholics may still receive the sacraments . The couple declines to discuss Catholic reaction to their relationship . Even if theirs is not a marriage , it ' s a union of sentiment and city life . Riordan has charged Daly with heading a committee to propose changes in the way Los Angeles serves children . &quot; I didn ' t need another responsibility , &quot; Daly says , legs crossed on a floral sofa in her home . &quot; But I knew it was an opportunity to create some change and bring_in these fabulously talented people that I knew . There ' s never really been a place in the city to go ( on behalf of ) children . You could go_to an individual city councilperson on an issue , but there was never the place to go . More_than anything , we ' d like to see that happen. &quot; Daly is also taking_on the major renovation of Getty House , the mayor ' s official but vacant Windsor Square residence , near Hancock Park . She has recruited friends to raise funds , and the committee has persuaded professionals ( architect Grant Taylor and attorney Jeff Glassman , among them ) to donate services . David Hockney is honorary chairman of the art committee . Their mission is to restore the 1921 English Tudor home for an April , 1995 , opening . The mayor has no plans to live there . &quot; But there is no really official place ( here ) to properly entertain foreign dignitaries and conduct the business of the city in a way that would entice people to do business ( in Los Angeles ) , &quot; Daly says . She is mindful of the importance of meshing work and pleasure , bringing_to the city years of experience as a CEO ' s wife in Hollywood , where business is often done outside studio walls . &quot; It ' s one thing to sit in an office and it ' s another to sit at dinner and interact in a more informal way , &quot; she says . &quot; I think there ' s tremendous benefit to that . New York City has Gracie Mansion , and it ' s a privilege and an honor to go there , and I think we need a similar setting in this city. &quot; Daly knows the art of entertaining . In court papers stemming from her divorce , she argued that her skills as a hostess enhanced Bob Daly ' s professional reputation , creating &quot; executive goodwill &quot; that helped him reach the top of his field . She said the warm family atmosphere she cultivated despite his long work hours and her charity deeds also contributed to his image and earning power . &quot; Bob always supported my work in charities and I believe that this work enhanced his reputation and standing in the entertainment_industry , &quot; Nancy Daly said in court papers . &quot; Shortly after Bob became CEO of Warner ' s , at my instigation he dispensed_with the customary Christmas practice of sending expensive gifts to industry notables and instead made a contribution to MacLaren Hall on their behalf . . . . We were one of the first studio executive families to do this . . . . &quot; Daly maintained that she was entitled not only to her share of the couple ' s tangible assets -- estimated by Bob Daly in court papers at $ 45 million -- but also to millions in future earnings because of the so-called executive goodwill . The case resulted in a mountain of documents as Nancy Daly sought to wrest closely held financial information from parent company Time Warner Inc. and court depositions from its top officials . She attempted to learn the contents of Bob Daly ' s new five-year contract and , failing that , of Warner Bros . President Terry Semel ' s recently negotiated deal . As the battle intensified , Bob Daly ' s attorneys threatened in court papers to seek a deposition from Riordan . Her side countered that it in turn might seek a statement from singer-songwriter Carole Bayer Sager , described in court documents as Bob Daly ' s &quot; current co-habitant. &quot; The Dalys recently settled the case and agreed to keep secret its details , thus avoiding a monthlong trial and the prospect of their divorce becoming enshrined in California law . The heady issues of the case demonstrate how American Dream-like Daly ' s life has been . She was born in northern New Jersey to middle-class parents ; her father was an accountant , and her mother , a homemaker . Her older brother , Gregory MacNeil , is a New Jersey businessman . She capped a reasonably happy childhood with secretarial_school . During her first permanent job as a secretary at CBS , she met Bob Daly , who started his career in the mail room there . They married in 1961 , when she was 20 and he was 24 , and embarked_on traditional married life in a Brooklyn , N.Y. , apartment . She quit work a_couple_of years later , and in 1966 they started a family . Daughter Linda , 28 , teaches learning-disabled children at the HELP Group in Sherman Oaks ; Bobby , 26 , works as a producer and interactive-computer entrepreneur in New York , and Brian , 23 , recently graduated from New York University Tisch School of the Arts . Daly says she enjoyed being a mother . &quot; I loved being home with my kids , &quot; she says . &quot; I organized play_groups for my children when they were very little . I was always finding ways to network and bring mothers together . And I don ' t get crazy over things . I loved having them around . So I was a Cub_Scout leader , a Girl_Scout leader , a soccer coach . I just loved the world of children. &quot; Particularly children who might have annoyed less patient adults . &quot; Kids always have a_couple_of friends ( who ) are off the wall and you are going , ' Oh my God , what kind of trouble are they going_to get_into ? ' As much as I may have worried occasionally , those were the friends I was most interested in . I like kids who are maybe supercharged , who have a lot of dimensions . I find them challenging and exciting. &quot; After living_in New Jersey for 10 years , the Dalys came_to California in 1978 for Bob ' s new position as president of CBS ' entertainment division . Shortly after the move , Nancy discovered MacLaren . &quot; Going_to MacLaren changed my life , &quot; she says simply . It happened one Christmas . She had heard through industry friends of plans to hold a holiday party for MacLaren kids . The partyers included Bob Newhart ' s wife , Ginnie ; Barbara Rickles , and Henry and Stacey Winkler . &quot; I had never seen a place like this , &quot; Daly says . &quot; It had been a probation facility , and it was turned_into a protection facility several years earlier . . . . They changed the population , but they didn ' t change the environment for the children . The kids looked sad , and I found it almost unbearable. &quot; Daly expected the children to be afraid of outsiders but was encouraged by their response to the volunteers ' visits . She returned with Henry Winkler after the Christmas party . &quot; I never saw anybody with such an ability to relate to these children , &quot; Daly says . &quot; He went_into one of the toddler cottages , and there was a little boy on his bed , and he was hitting himself , and Henry said , ' Why are you doing that ? ' &quot; And he said , ' I ' m bad . I ' m bad. ' &quot; And Henry sat_down on the bed with him and cuddled him and told him he wasn ' t bad . And I guess probably more_than anything , his sensitivity and this child ' s feeling that he was somehow to blame for his being there -- he was maybe 3 or 4 -- that was the most poignant time. &quot; That was the beginning of United Friends of the Children . The handful of friends has quadrupled over the years to 80 hands-on volunteers . They make monthly treks to MacLaren for barbecues and grooming days , on which Vidal Sassoon hairdressers bolster the kids ' self-esteem with new dos . &quot; Many of my members did manicures , so we could do massaging and touching and caring and demonstrating to the children that they are cared about by people who aren ' t getting paid and who aren ' t trying to abuse them in some way , &quot; Daly says . United Friends also sponsors a tutoring program for learning disabled residents , a theater program and a store where the kids can exchange good-behavior points for new jeans , stuffed toys and Cross Colours T-shirts . &quot; I must say it was something ( Nancy ) had a vision for , and it ' s grown now , &quot; says longtime friend Joanne Agoglia , who has worked with United Friends and on other projects . &quot; Nancy always has new ideas , and she ' s able to make_it all come_together . She has good instincts for the people that can work together and enjoy being together and because of that , we accomplish a lot. &quot; Daly ' s organizational talent also involves tapping her industry contacts on MacLaren ' s behalf : Jon Peters and Barbra Streisand paid_for MacLaren ' s swimming_pool . Warner Bros . donated a bus emblazoned with Bugs Bunny . Movie studios lend first-run prints for special MacLaren showings at the El Monte Theater . &quot; So we ' ve touched every part of the community as_a_whole to pull them in in some way or other and help us , and we ' ve never been turned_down for anything , &quot; Daly says . The beginning was rough , however . County officials resisted United Friends ' efforts until the county Department of Children ' s Services was established a decade ago . &quot; They used to try to fight us from coming_to MacLaren and doing what we could do , &quot; Daly recalls . &quot; Because it brought attention to what was really a negative , the open wound of the county . Because it was sort of hidden_out in El Monte , nobody quite knew until we came_along what was going_on and we brought attention to that and made_it known. &quot; Daly , Stacey Winkler and United Friends lobbied heavily for the creation of the children ' s department . At the time , money targeted for children &quot; was buried in the welfare system , and we felt the money wasn ' t going_to the children , &quot; Daly says . &quot; It was going elsewhere . Nobody could find it. &quot; Working with county Supervisor Ed Edelman , the group enlisted celebrities Daniel J . Travanti , Carol Burnett , Sally Struthers , Henry Winkler and Lyle Alzado to testify for the new department . And it helped TV_reporters expose problems in the foster-care system . Edelman , who appointed Daly to the advisory Children ' s Services Commission , says her efforts were critical . &quot; I think without her help , it may_not have been established , &quot; he says . &quot; She was very , very helpful ( because of ) her enthusiasm , her dedication and obviously her ability to organize and get people to follow her lead. &quot; And as Daly talked to kids in foster care , she heard the constant refrain : &quot; I want to go home. &quot; Her campaign for family preservation began five years ago . &quot; The ideal is to work with families and return children , &quot; she says . &quot; Here you ' ve created a population of children that can ' t go_home . There ' s no one who ' s saved their pictures that they drew all_the way through school . There ' s not a continuity , someone who remembers their first_steps . We have kids who don ' t have anybody with those cherished memories . They ' re sort of isolated in the world. &quot; Daly worked with the Department of Children ' s Services to change the way the county deals with troubled homes . Rather than put kids in foster care , the idea is to work with families to create healthier environments for children , enabling them to stay_at home . And she helped lobby for state legislation a_couple_of years ago that permits counties to shift some foster-care money to family preservation . This is one organized woman . A month after the Northridge earthquake , her skills are evident in a nearly pristine collection of Rookwood pottery , made in turn-of-the-century Cincinnati , surrounding her first-floor fireplace . Only one piece had not been waxed into place , a museum technique for preserving fragile objects . Only one piece broke_in the quake . Daly ' s three dogs -- sibling labs Bud and Goldie and Yorkshire_terrier Molly -- prowl about . Family members dot the living room in spirit and in photos . Daly is particularly fond of one photograph of her Republican boyfriend jogging with the Democratic President . She ' s a liberal Democrat , and the picture could be a metaphor for the couple ' s political alliance . Daly calls their respective party_lines insignificant . &quot; I consider them at this point labels , and I think many people do . So many of my friends who are strong liberal Democrats , some of whom voted for the mayor and some didn ' t . One thing I ' ve learned in these months is , the people who voted for him are thrilled with him , and those who didn ' t think he ' s doing a great job. &quot; She likes some of the perks of dating the mayor -- the dinner with Rosa Parks , the evening at her home with Transportation_Secretary Federico Pena . But the sudden transformation into public figure is something else for Daly , who values her privacy . &quot; I guess I have to say it surprises me , but yesterday I went_to a restaurant Downtown , a hotel , and I was parking my car and the man who took my car recognized me , &quot; she says . &quot; that ' s still very surprising to me . I ' m used to being an anonymous person . But it isn ' t something I ' m uncomfortable with. &quot; The consummate organizer recognizes the value of the public_eye in getting things done . So although she ' s hesitant to do interviews , mindful that requests have come since she and the mayor went public , she consents . And on this clear morning of spring , with the brash sounds of kids ricocheting off the Children ' s Museum walls , Daly tours a photo exhibit , trailed by cameras herself . The exhibit features pictures shot by kids from MacLaren and from Ann Theisen ' s home -- the former nun has taken_in 10 adoptive and foster_children , some of them drug babies -- under a United Friends program . The young photographers are there . They ' re proud and they ' re pulling Daly this way and that to see their work . Maggie , an 8-year-old with long brown braids , takes Daly to see her photo of a baby in bed pondering the onlooker , a hand tugging at her right ear . There ' s a quote with the picture : &quot; I like to sleep_in my bed but then I go_into my mother ' s bed when she ' s sleeping. &quot; Beneath those words the quote is translated into sign_language , because Maggie cannot speak . As Maggie looks_at Daly in triumph and expectation , Daly responds in the language all children understand . She bends down and plants a kiss on Maggie ' s head . Nancy MacNeil Daly Age : 52 .

It takes his office and my secretary a lot of planning . They talk to each other a_couple_of times a day to coordinate. &quot; On becoming a public figure : &quot; I guess I have to say it surprises me , but yesterday I went_to a restaurant Downtown , a hotel , and I was parking my car and the man who took my car recognized me . that ' s still very surprising to me. &quot; * Staff writer Terry Pristin contributed to this story .</TEXT>
