   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP SOCCER ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; TODAY ' S GAMES AT A GLANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> GROUP E at Giants Stadium , E . Rutherford , N.J. IRELAND vs . NORWAY * TIME : 1 p.m. PDT * TV : ESPN ( delayed , 9:30 p.m. ) , Univision ( delayed , 9 p.m. ) * KEY MATCHUPS : This will be a lot like an English Premier League game . All but two players on the_Irish roster play club soccer in England , as do nine of the Norwegians , so look_for a lot of hard work , a lot of running , a lot of close defense , a lot of high passes into the penalty area and a lot of aerial challenges . Erik Thorstvedt , the Norwegian goalkeeper , is familiar_with the_Irish players and has the sense , the hands and the courage to deny them . The same is true for Pat Bonner at the other end . Norway has a slight advantage in_height , forward Jan Age Fjortoft and midfielder Jostein Flo being particularly effective in the air . Ireland counters with the experience of defender Paul McGrath . Norway has a nonstop midfielder in Erik Mykland , but Ireland counters with a tough midfielder of its own in Roy Keane . * OUTLOOK : Irish Coach Jack Charlton has been banished for this game by FIFA because of behavior in Ireland ' s game against Mexico , but the_Irish know what they have to do , which is tie at minimum . John Aldridge , the_Irish striker who scored a late and possibly crucial goal against Mexico , said Ireland will have to play as it did_in its first game , a 1-0 victory over Italy , to stand a chance . If Ireland plays to its strength , which is in harrying opponents , Norway could be thrown_off stride . * OUTCOME : This game has tie written all_over it because that would give each team four points in the group and a probable place in the next round , especially if Italy defeats Mexico today in Washington , D.C. Prediction : 1-1 , but if there ' s a winner , it will be Norway by a goal . GRAHAME L . JONES</TEXT>
