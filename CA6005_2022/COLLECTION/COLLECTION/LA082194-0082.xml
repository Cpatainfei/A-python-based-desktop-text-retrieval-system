   <HEADLINE> SCHOOL LUNCH MENU BOOSTS COMMODITIES ; HEALTH : AGRICULTURE_DEPARTMENT TELLS SCHOOLS TO LOWER FAT , CHOLESTEROL AND SODIUM , BUT CRITICS SAY PROGRAM IS DRIVEN BY AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS FIRST AND NUTRITION SECOND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pat Holstein runs the school meals program for a rural school district near Columbia , S.C. , and , thanks to a special program , can spend 15 % of her federal food dollars on fresh fruits and vegetables . Fifteen percent is a lot higher than the roughly 4 % that the U.S. Department_of_Agriculture allocates to fresh produce when the department buys_food for the nation ' s 15 # 000 school districts . Still , the department opposes the special program that gives people like Holstein money to shop locally for the best buys on produce , meat and other foods . The department says that it should do the shopping . Opposition to the Commodity Letters_of_Credit program sounds strange from a department trying to improve the $ 650 million or so worth of food it buys each year for distribution to schools . It sounded no stranger than the deference paid to the department ' s commodity programs when Agriculture_Secretary Mike Espy and Assistant Secretary Ellen Haas on June 8 announced their regulations to improve school lunches . Rather than set new nutritional guidelines for the kind of foods that the department purchases , the department told schools to lower the amount of fat , saturated fat , cholesterol and sodium in lunches . The department also announced an agreement between the agency in_charge of nutrition and those in_charge of marketing commodities to work_on the quality of USDA purchases . &quot; Their approach to improving the commodities looks_like a pretty soft approach , that they ' re making a bureaucratic commitment to improve the commodities , but it ' s unclear exactly how improved they will be , &quot; said Michael Jacobson , director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest . The department , even before Espy and former consumer advocate Haas came_on board , had been working to lower the amount of fat in its meat and dairy_products , and the levels of salt and sugar in canned produce . And although 4 % doesn ' t sound like a lot of fresh produce , it ' s double what the department was purchasing before Espy took_over in 1993 . Nevertheless , critics maintain that the commodity program is driven by agricultural interests first and nutrition second . In fact , the 1946 law that created the school lunch program also specified that it try to promote U.S. farm goods . So if a drought drives_up feed prices , forcing more hogs and cattle to early slaughter , the Agricultural Marketing Service will buy more beef and pork for school lunches . Haas , in recent testimony before a House Agriculture subcommittee , noted that the &quot; positive market effect of these commodity programs is most important to retain. &quot; Haas nearly echoed testimony from groups like the American Meat Institute when she noted that commodity purchases account_for no more_than 20 % of the nearly $ 5 billion that schools spend on food . And the setting of general nutritional goals , leaving it up_to schools to meet them how they see fit , and the refusal to single_out any kind of food as bad , pleased the industry . &quot; We were very concerned that there was going_to be a huge amount of effort to replace processed foods with fresh , &quot; said Juanita Duggan , lobbyist for the National Food_Processors Assn . Despite complaints about the nutritional quality of the kinds of foods they receive from the department , school food service administrators need the commodity programs and the agriculture groups that support them . Without such an ally , schools are more vulnerable to cuts_in their federal budget_for commodities , the American School Food Service indicated in recent testimony .</TEXT>
