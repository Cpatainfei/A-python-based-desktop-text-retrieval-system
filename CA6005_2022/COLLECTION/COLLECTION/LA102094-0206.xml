   <HEADLINE> EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : SIMI VALLEY ; SEX EDUCATION CURRICULUM REJECTED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Simi Valley school_board has sent a proposed sex education curriculum back to the drawing board because parts of it were deemed inappropriate , Supt . Mary Beth Wolford said . Wolford , who declined to give specifics on what the panel found inappropriate , made the announcement late Tuesday after a group of conservative parents told the board that the new curriculum should not include references_to homosexuality or any sexual acts . Parents criticized the board , saying it allowed a committee of nurses and teachers to stray from guidelines developed earlier this year . The committee was formed to select materials for use in seventh- and 10th-grade courses on sex education . Parent Kathy Burke singled_out sections in the recommended literature that mention homosexuality , masturbation and oral_sex , which she said were not supposed to be included in the curriculum . Coleen Ary , chairwoman of the conservative Citizens for Truth in Education , also criticized the materials for not being abstinence-based . &quot; Children will be left to their own designs to determine right and wrong for themselves , &quot; she said .
