   <TEXT> &quot; Nightclubbing on the Edge &quot; ( June 23 ) , about the new clubs in Los Angeles , was very interesting . Re the Lava Lounge -- &quot; a paradise in the middle of hell , &quot; &quot; a Hungarian bar , &quot; a &quot; prostitute hangout &quot; and &quot; like watching ' Cops ' &quot; : Plaza Cocktails , as it used to be known , was a small neighborhood bar -- my nearest local bar when I lived_in Hollywood.One of my best_friends ( whom I met in there ) was a bartender there in the late 1980s . True , it was frequented by a number of Hungarians , mainly because the owner was Hungarian , and the Eastern European people knew they had somewhere to go_to mingle with their own countrymen . Also a lot of other people , who had businesses in the neighborhood , frequented the bar . I also remember meeting a very famous household-name rock_star who had been visiting a record company in the neighborhood . He had gone_in for a drink and exclaimed to me that &quot; he would n ' t be bothered in a little working-class neighborhood bar. &quot; As for prostitutes , I am not myself one , so possibly would not know what to look_for either upscale or downscale . I certainly do not remember anyone haggling a price . I have some good memories of Plaza Cocktails , as I met a lot of people way back then and made some good friends . I only hope the new Lava Lounge lives_up_to L.A. ' s expectations . G . WALKER-SAMPLES , Los Angeles</TEXT>
