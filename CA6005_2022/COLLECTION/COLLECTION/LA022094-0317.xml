   <TEXT> Night falls on the City of Angels . The suits have gone_home but lights still shine from the high-rise office windows . Inside the towers a nocturnal army is_on the move . Time for the Big Sweep . Mixing the intrigue of a detective mystery with a realistic portrayal of the working lives of the city ' s janitors , a new book offers a glimpse into the world of those who sweep while the city sleeps . In &quot; The Big Sweep &quot; ( &quot; La Gran Limpieza &quot; ) , a Mexican journalist comes_to Los Angeles to search for her missing boyfriend , a janitor and union activist , who disappeared after learning of a union-busting conspiracy . The story unfolds through 250 photographs featuring actors and union_members with dialogue in Spanish and English . The photonovela is the fruit of the efforts of four photographers and artists and their interviews with members and organizers of the Justice for Janitors campaign . &quot; We tried to weave a story that would address the issues that had come_out in our interviews in a way that was more fun than a documentary , &quot; said Stephen Callis , one of the collaborators and a faculty_member at the Otis College of Art and Design . Callis and artist Leslie Ernst launched the project after participating in the victorious 1990 campaign to win union recognition , better pay and benefits for janitors in Century City . They teamed_up with Sandra Ramirez and Ruben Ortiz Torres , also artists and photographers , and had the cooperation of the Service Employees International Union , Local 399 , based in Westlake . A $ 14 # 600 grant from the Los Angeles City Cultural Affairs Department provided funding . Various scenes depict the tensions between overworked janitors and the supervisors who hound them , conflicts between the union and the cleaning companies and the energy of union rallies . &quot; It ' s a good_story about workers and it ' s good for people who aren ' t part of the union already , &quot; said Leonidas Velasquez , a union_member and the lead man in a janitorial team that cleans a Downtown office tower . &quot; At least with a union you have someone to back you up. &quot; Velasquez said the book ' s easy-to-read format could be duplicated to assist union workers . &quot; A lot of workers make the mistake of not reading their contracts and even some union_members don ' t know their rights , &quot; he said . Gilberto Velasquez ( no relation ) , who lives near MacArthur Park and works as a janitor in Westwood , said the story gives readers a taste of how janitors are treated by supervisors working for the cleaning companies . But while the book focuses_on the union ' s victories , he said he is disappointed that the real-life union has yet to gain health benefits for its members working in Westwood or resolve many complaints against supervisors . &quot; It ' s nice that the union gets the recognition and it ' s great to see a book that deals with real-life issues , &quot; said Jono Shaffer , a union organizer . &quot; To use it as an organizing tool , we would have wanted it to have a heavier focus_on how to organize , how to fight and get_out and raise_hell . But from the standpoint that it shows that we can win , it ' s good. &quot; A publication party is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Midnight Special Bookstore , 1350 3rd St. , Santa Monica .
