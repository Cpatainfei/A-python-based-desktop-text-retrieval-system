   <HEADLINE> WARPLANES SET , CLINTON WARNS ; BOSNIA : BUT HE IS HOPEFUL AS NATO DEADLINE NEARS . U.N. OFFICIALS UPBEAT , ALTHOUGH QUESTIONS REMAIN WHETHER THE SERBS ARE FULLY COMPLYING ON ARMS PULLBACK OR TURNOVER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton warned Saturday that U.S. warplanes are set to launch air strikes if all heavy_weapons surrounding the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo are not pulled_out or placed under U.N. control by the time a NATO-set deadline expires tonight . But U.N. officials insisted the withdrawal of Serbian artillery is_well under way . Calling signs of a Bosnian Serb pullback encouraging , Clinton said in his weekly radio address that he remains hopeful that there &quot; will be no need to use force against anyone. &quot; But he stressed that &quot; American pilots and planes stand ready to do our part &quot; by helping NATO to carry_out its threat to launch air strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina if Serbian forces do not meet the deadline at 1 a.m. Monday Sarajevo time ( 4 p.m. Pacific_time today ) . While Clinton used his address to prepare Americans for the possibility of U.S. military intervention in Bosnia , there were conflicting signals from Sarajevo about whether the Serbs will satisfy the NATO ultimatum . &quot; We share the confidence that this can be concluded , &quot; U.N. special envoy Yasushi Akashi said , and Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , the_British officer commanding the 13 # 000-member U.N. force in Bosnia , also expressed optimism that the deadline would be met . However , Bosnian government officials sharply criticized the U.N.-supervised effort to clear big guns from around Sarajevo , claiming that many of the Bosnian Serb weapons were still in the area . The Muslim-led government appealed_to the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization to make an independent assessment of Serbian compliance with the ultimatum , which was set after a mortar shell killed 68 people in a Sarajevo marketplace Feb . 5 . Bosnian Vice_President Ejup Ganic accused U.N. officials of capitulating to Serbian demands that most of the weapons remain in place and dismissed the fact that they were being turned_over to teams of U.N. observers , arguing that surrounding the Serbs ' artillery with U.N. forces only served to protect them from the threatened NATO air strikes . &quot; We see the U.N. soldiers being used as a shelter , creating an umbrella &quot; to deflect any possible NATO reprisal , Ganic charged . &quot; In the case that the international community decides to take air strikes , these conditions will make_it impossible , &quot; he added . Other Bosnian officials complained that , on the eve of the NATO deadline , hundreds of Serbian artillery pieces were still positioned in the_hills above Sarajevo . Mustafa Hajrulahovic , a member of the supreme command of the Bosnian army , told reporters in Sarajevo that the Serbs still had more_than 100 antiaircraft_guns , 70 tanks and 95 howitzers deployed inside the exclusion zone . &quot; One can conclude the NATO Pact resolution has not been observed , &quot; he said . The NATO ultimatum originally ordered that all guns within a 12-mile radius of Sarajevo be withdrawn or surrendered by tonight . But at U.N. urging , the ultimatum was amended to allow the Serbs to keep some of their 500 heavy artillery pieces within the safety_zone as long as they are rendered inoperable or deemed to be under U.N. control . Akashi said Saturday that 100 weapons had been turned_over -- 70 by the Serbs and 30 by the Bosnian government . It was unclear how many had been removed from the area . The Muslim-led government has considerably less firepower . Rose rejected Ganic ' s assertion that the Serbs were using the United Nations to circumvent the NATO ultimatum . &quot; To say that the weapons will be fired on the city is to ignore the fact that they are now under our control , and it ' s irrelevant where they happen to be located , &quot; Rose said . In Washington , a senior State_Department official said Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev assured Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher that the Bosnian Serbs would comply with the ultimatum . Russia had offered on Thursday to send 400 U.N. peacekeeping troops to Sarajevo if the Serb rebels would accede_to NATO ' s demands . The Russian peacekeepers , redeployed from Croatia , arrived in Bosnia on Saturday , wire reports said . Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic had earlier pledged to comply by midnight Saturday , a day early . However , senior Administration officials remained guarded in their assessments of Serbian compliance , saying only that the evidence is still ambiguous and that poor visibility due_to dense snowfalls was making_it difficult both to move heavy weaponry and to confirm its removal . Kozyrev , who spoke with Christopher for 30 minutes by phone on Saturday from Prague , said the Serbs &quot; did not make any suggestion that the West should extend the deadline , &quot; the State_Department official said . Clinton , in his radio address , said American and other NATO military planners still &quot; do not yet know whether air strikes will be necessary. &quot; There is &quot; some evidence that heavy_weapons are being pulled_back from around Sarajevo , but others remain , &quot; he added . Clinton ' s caution on the status of Serbian compliance was echoed throughout the day by other senior officials , including National Security Adviser Anthony Lake , who said there were &quot; hopeful signs &quot; that the Serbs were pulling_back but that &quot; the evidence is still mixed. &quot; A senior White_House official , briefing reporters Saturday evening on the situation in Sarajevo , said Serbian columns were moving_out of the exclusion zone but that there was &quot; evidence that some weapons_systems still remain in place in Sarajevo. &quot; Meanwhile , military preparations for any NATO air strikes were proceeding apace . Defense_Secretary William J . Perry and Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , left for Aviano , Italy , after the President ' s address to review the strike plan . They were being joined there by the defense ministers of Britain , France and the_Netherlands for a final round of consultations before the deadline expires . White_House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Clinton spoke by phone with French President Francois Mitterrand , who renewed his commitment to tonight ' s deadline . A senior Administration source , citing the heavy snows and poor visibility , cautioned against expectations that air strikes might be launched &quot; the minute the deadline expires. &quot; But he added that &quot; there will be no backing off. &quot; At NATO ' s southern European command in Naples , Italy , a senior official said that NATO commanders had endorsed a &quot; phased approach &quot; in which limited air strikes might be launched against selected targets to see what the reaction would be . If limited air strikes did not force compliance with the NATO ultimatum , then wider and more intense attacks would be launched in a subsequent phase , the official added . The advantage of this phased approach , the official said , was that it would demonstrate that NATO is serious about enforcing the ultimatum while at_the_same_time minimizing the risk that the air strikes would spark a wider war in Bosnia or trigger retaliation against U.N. peacekeepers . Acknowledging the possibility of American losses , Clinton again pledged that no American ground forces would be sent to Bosnia to &quot; impose a settlement that the parties to the conflict do not accept. &quot; But saying that the Bosnian Serbs &quot; bear primary responsibility &quot; for the violence that has left 250 # 000 people missing or dead over the past two years in the former Yugoslav republic , Clinton said that the air strikes were needed to force the Serbs to &quot; seek a solution through negotiation. &quot; Looking beyond tonight ' s deadline , Clinton said he had ordered American negotiators to intensify efforts to help the warring parties reach &quot; a fair and enforceable settlement , &quot; and he insisted that the Bosnian quagmire was still primarily a problem for the Europeans to handle . But he also told the nation that the world still &quot; looks_to America for leadership &quot; and that it is vital to U.S. interests to prevent a broader European conflict .
