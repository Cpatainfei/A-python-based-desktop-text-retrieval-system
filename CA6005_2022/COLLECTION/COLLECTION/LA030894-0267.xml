   <HEADLINE> RECORDS OF 18 PLUTONIUM TESTS RELEASED ; MEDICINE : ALL INDIVIDUALS RECEIVED INJECTIONS UNKNOWINGLY . THE DOCUMENTS ARE THE FIRST OF THE SECRET U.S.-SPONSORED EXPERIMENTS TO BE DISCLOSED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Department_of_Energy on Monday released the medical_records of 18 patients unknowingly injected with plutonium between 1945 and 1947 in one of the secret radiation experiments sponsored by the government during and after World_War_II . The documents were the first to be released in the department ' s effort to open its files on the series of experiments that were part of the government ' s clandestine Cold_War activities to gain nuclear superiority over the Soviet_Union . Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary announced in December that the government had not publicly disclosed nuclear research tests on more_than 600 people . Government_agencies are now digging_into records to determine the purpose of the research , the level of consent and how the subjects were chosen . The 18 people whose records were released Monday were all hospital patients who have since died . They were part of a study designed to determine how long plutonium stayed in the body and how it was distributed . The research was conducted by the Manhattan District Corps of Engineers Project -- a code name for the government ' s effort to develop the atomic_bomb . The study was to have been conducted on individuals with limited life_expectancy but the documents show that this was not always the case . One subject , for example , a 53-year-old man , was the victim of a car accident and was hospitalized on March 25 , 1945 , at the U.S. Army Medical Corps ' Oak Ridge Hospital for treatment of multiple fractures . He received a plutonium injection on April 15 of that year . Another subject was a 4-year-old Australian boy who had been brought_to the United States for cancer treatment . His parents apparently thought that the injection was part of his cancer therapy . The child died soon after his return home to Australia . Other patients included a man suffering from hemophilia , another with amyotrophic_lateral_sclerosis -- Lou Gehrig ' s disease -- and several teen-agers , among them a 16-year-old boy and an 18-year-old girl , both of whom had serious illnesses . Many documents show that Argonne National Laboratory , a Department_of_Energy facility that is part of the University of Chicago , attempted to trace many of the patients for a follow-up evaluation during the 1970s and 1980s and was not often successful . In a series of letters to the parents of the Australian boy , for example , the lab urged them to provide additional information about the fate of their son and asked_for details about his treatment . &quot; I must apologize for writing to you about your son . . . after so many years , &quot; said one letter sent_in 1987 , more_than 40 years after the child had been treated . &quot; You or your family members may be the only persons alive , however , who remember certain things that happened immediately after the war and those events have become rather important in some official circles here. &quot; It went_on : &quot; Which family members accompanied the child ? Was a family member in the room with ( him ) most of the time ? Were you aware of any special treatments , injections or special tests ? If so , what information was given to you and did you give approval verbally or in writing . . . ? Were you given any details as_to precisely what substances were involved , or what was done ? &quot; Several responses from officials in Australia stated that the child had subsequently died and that no autopsy was performed . Some records indicated that many of the patients were not told of the nature of the injections until nearly three decades after they had taken_place . The documents include statements , signed by some of the patients in 1974 , acknowledging that they were the subjects of a biological experiment . The statements included the date each patient was injected and the hospital location .</TEXT>
