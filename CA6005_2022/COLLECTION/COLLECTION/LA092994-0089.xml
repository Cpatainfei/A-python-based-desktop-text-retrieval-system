   <HEADLINE> NEW LAW BANS AREA OFFSHORE DRILLING ; ENVIRONMENT : IT EXTENDS STATE PROTECTIONS AGAINST THE PRACTICE TO WATERS OFF THE COUNTY THAT WERE LEFT UNPROTECTED BY PREVIOUS STATUTES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gov . Pete Wilson on Wednesday signed into law a bill that for the first time extends state protections against offshore oil drilling to waters off Ventura County . The new law , called the California Coastal Sanctuary Act of 1994 , permanently bans offshore drilling along California ' s 1 # 100-mile coastline and replaces a hodgepodge of prohibitions already in_effect for most of the state ' s shoreline . The bill ' s author , Assemblyman Jack O ' Connell ( D-Carpinteria ) , said he and others had fought for eight years for legislation to permanently protect the state ' s fragile shoreline . While noting that the uniform ban will protect the entire coastline , O ' Connell singled_out Ventura County as a main beneficiary because it was the only one left unprotected by the patchwork of previously adopted coastal sanctuary laws . &quot; This will have a positive impact on Ventura County ' s tourism and fishing industries , and will further enhance the quality_of_life -- with less air_pollution , fewer spills and less blight on the coastline , &quot; O ' Connell said . &quot; I ' m pleased that Gov . Wilson signed this legislation . It sends a signal that our coastline is not for sale. &quot; * State waters stretch_out to sea for three miles until federal jurisdiction takes_over . In Ventura County , O ' Connell said , most oil drilling takes_place on dry_land . The drilling that does take_place is in federal waters more_than three miles from the coastline , he said , where other prohibitions against new drilling are in_effect . O ' Connell put the blame for Ventura County ' s exclusion from previous bans on former Assemblyman Tom McClintock , a conservative who routinely battles government regulation . &quot; Tom McClintock had always managed to craft an exemption for Ventura County , &quot; he said . &quot; He was protecting the oil_companies -- to the detriment of tourism and commercial fishing. &quot; Rob Stutzman , a spokesman for McClintock in his campaign for state controller , confirmed that his boss blocked inclusion of Ventura County in previous coastal sanctuary measures . In addition to its impact on Ventura County , the new law is particularly timely in three other Southern California coastal counties -- Los Angeles , Orange and Santa Barbara -- where current drilling bans were set to expire Jan . 1 . In 11 other counties ranging from Del Norte at the Oregon border to San Mateo , drilling could have resumed when existing pacts ran_out in less than 10 years . Wilson trumpeted the measure ' s benefits to the tourism and recreation industries , which depend_upon unspoiled beaches to draw millions of visitors each year . &quot; California ' s coast is a treasure that attracts people from around the globe , &quot; Wilson said in a statement . &quot; Its beauty . . . deserves protection from possible damage associated with future offshore oil and gas activities. &quot; Under the measure , existing oil and gas drilling may continue . But new ventures are banned permanently -- barring future changes in the law . * Wilson ' s announcement came as a coalition of environmental groups blasted the governor for a record it said favored oil_companies , campaign contributors and developers over the interests of the public . &quot; He is trying to do some damage_control here , &quot; said Michael Paparian , state director of the Sierra Club . &quot; His environmental record for the past four years has been horrible. &quot; In particular , the coalition -- called Californians for Environmental Common_Sense -- cited the Wilson Administration ' s response in cleaning_up the massive Guadalupe oil spill by Unocal in San Luis Obispo County . Local officials complain the cleanup is inadequate and in itself harmful to the environment . Opposing the offshore drilling ban was the Western States Petroleum Assn. , whose spokesman , Bill Duke , warned that the new law will have a chilling effect on the oil_industry . &quot; We ' re unhappy to see the bill get signed , &quot; Duke said . &quot; We think it ' s bad legislation to lock_up any natural_resource in perpetuity . Because nobody can say whether there will be a future shortage. &quot;</TEXT>
