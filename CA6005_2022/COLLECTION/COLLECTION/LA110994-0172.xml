   <HEADLINE> CRIME , IMMIGRATION ISSUES HELPED WILSON , POLL FINDS ; ELECTION : PROPOSITION 187 WINS AMONG WHITES , BUT LOSES AMONG ALL OTHER ETHNIC GROUPS , EXIT SURVEY SHOWS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California voters concerned about illegal immigration and crime reelected Republican Gov . Pete Wilson over Democrat Kathleen Brown on Tuesday despite an overwhelming belief among the electorate that under Wilson ' s leadership the state is_on the wrong track , the Los Angeles Times Poll found . Democratic U.S. Sen . Dianne Feinstein , locked_in a tight battle with Republican Rep . Mike Huffington , was holding_on to her Democratic base , winning a good number of GOP votes and besting the wealthy former Texas oilman among independent voters , according to the results of a survey of voters as they left the polls . Proposition 187 , the anti-illegal immigration initiative , polarized the electorate along racial lines , winning big among white voters while losing in every_other ethnic_group . The measure ' s opponents apparently failed to significantly increase the turnout of Latinos -- or other minorities -- beyond the number who voted_in the last gubernatorial election four years ago . Seventy-seven percent of those who voted for the measure said they wanted to send a protest message , and half who supported it said they hoped to force the federal_government to respond to the problem of illegal immigration . Of those who opposed Proposition 187 , 58 % said it was poorly written and 41 % described it as racist . The controversial measure also split Californians according to age , educational level and religious affiliation , and played a role in both of the top races for statewide office . Nearly one in five of those who voted Tuesday said Proposition 187 had a major influence on their choice for governor , and most of those people voted for Wilson . The governor clearly was a vulnerable incumbent , with barely half of those who voted Tuesday saying they approved of his performance and nearly two-thirds -- 63 % -- saying they believed the state has gone astray . But Brown simply was not an acceptable alternative for most voters . Even among those who said that the state is heading in the wrong direction and that their own personal finances are worse today than they were four years ago , as_many voted for Wilson as for Brown . Wilson ' s campaign team accomplished its goal of making the race a contest about illegal immigration , crime and taxes . Those three issues ranked highest among voters ' concerns as they went_to the polls Tuesday , and the voters , by a big margin , said they trusted Wilson more_than Brown on each of those matters . The Times Poll , directed by John Brennan , interviewed 5 # 336 voters at 85 precincts representing a cross-section of California . The margin of sampling error was 3 percentage_points in either direction . Wilson , the poll found , defeated Brown by winning the votes of more_than nine out of 10 Republicans and beating Brown among independents while also making deep inroads into what should have been Democratic strongholds for the one-term state_treasurer . Wilson won 91 % of Republican votes , 54 % of independents and 18 % of Democrats , according to the poll . Immigration , the top issue on the minds of voters Tuesday , was cited by 38 % as an important concern . Of these voters , 63 % chose Wilson while 34 % sided with Brown . Crime , despite Brown ' s summerlong effort to &quot; neutralize &quot; it as an issue , was cited by 32 % of voters as an important concern , compared to just 3 % in a Times exit poll two years ago . These voters went overwhelmingly for Wilson -- 65 % to 33 % . Taxes were a top issue to 27 % of the voters , and Wilson -- even though he signed a record $ 7-billion tax increase his first year in office -- still won this group by a margin of 67 % to 29 % . Among the top four issues , only education helped Brown . About one-fourth of voters cited the schools as an important issue , and Brown won this group , 61 % to 36 % , the poll found . There was a gender gap in the governor ' s race , and it broke Wilson ' s way : He split the female vote with Brown but won the men by a large margin . Brown beat Wilson among younger voters , poorer voters and those who were less educated . She also won among blacks and Latinos and split the Asian American vote . But Wilson easily erased that deficit by winning big among groups that dominated the voting : older people , whites , the more affluent and the well educated . Wilson did worse among Latinos Tuesday than he did four years ago , presumably because of his outspoken stand against illegal immigration . But Latinos voted_in such small numbers that he was not hurt by the erosion . Just 8 % of the electorate was Latino , virtually the same as in 1990 , while 80 % of those who voted Tuesday were white . Wilson won the white vote 58 % to 38 % . Brown won the Latino vote , 74 % to 22 % . Four years ago , about 35 % of Latinos sided with Wilson . Brown ' s family ties also hurt her . Of those who said the Brown legacy was a major influence on their vote for governor , 67 % went_with Wilson while just 32 % voted for Brown , the poll found . The Senate_race was markedly different , and it seemed clear that voters perceived Feinstein as more of a centrist Democrat than Brown . More_than 20 % of those who voted for Wilson skipped across party_lines to vote for Feinstein over Huffington . The most striking difference between the race for governor and the one for the Senate was among independent women . Brown lost this group to Wilson , 53 % to 41 % . But Feinstein won among these voters by a margin of 55 % to 36 % . Feinstein and Huffington were even among whites , but she had an advantage among all other ethnic_groups , according to the poll . She won 85 % of the Democratic vote , while Huffington won 80 % of the Republican vote . Independents went_with Feinstein by a margin of 48 % to 40 % . On the issues on which Republicans held an advantage -- immigration , crime and taxes -- Huffington ' s lead over Feinstein was smaller than Wilson ' s over Brown . Feinstein held a big edge on almost all_the lesser issues -- education , ethics , health_care and the economy . Of those voting_in the Senate_race , 29 % cited Feinstein ' s record as the most important factor influencing their decision , and among those people , the senator won , 75 % to 23 % . The next largest group -- 20 % -- cited Feinstein ' s ties to Clinton as an important factor . Feinstein suffered modestly because of the voters ' attitudes about the president -- narrowly losing this group to Huffington . About 15 % of voters said their concern about Huffington trying to &quot; buy the election &quot; was a major factor_in their decision . Feinstein was the choice of 94 % of these voters . The challenger did best among voters who saw Feinstein as a &quot; tax and spend liberal , &quot; but only 15 % of the electorate said the senator ' s spending record was a major influence on their decision . The campaign over Proposition 187 , which will deny most public_services to illegal immigrants , divided the state ' s ethnic_groups . Democrats voted 2-to-1 against 187 , but Republicans voted greater than 3-to-1 in favor of it , and independents also approved the ballot measure , by a nearly 3-to-2 margin . Proposition 187 won among whites by 59 % to 41 % . It failed 78 % to 22 % among Latinos , 54 % to 46 % among Asian Americans and 56 % to 44 % among blacks . The measure was winning handily in Southern California , the Central Valley and in rural Northern California . It was losing only in the Bay Area . The initiative also played a role in the races for governor and the U.S. Senate . Seventeen percent of those who voted Tuesday said Proposition 187 had a major influence over whom they chose for governor . Of those , 73 % voted for Wilson and 26 % voted for Brown . In the Senate_race , among those who cited Proposition 187 as a major influence , 38 % voted for Feinstein and 57 % for Huffington . In both races , the negative campaigning that marked the 1994 election seemed to take its toll . Half of Wilson ' s voters said they chose him not because they liked him but because he was the lesser of two evils . Thirty-eight percent of Feinstein ' s voters said the same thing . How the Poll Was Conducted The Times Poll interviewed 5 # 336 voters as they exited 85 polling_places across the state . Precincts were chosen based on the pattern of turnout in past primary_elections . The survey was by confidential questionnaire . The margin of sampling error for percentages based on the entire sample is plus or minus 3 percentage_points . For some subgroups the error margin may be somewhat higher . Because the survey does not include absentee voters or those who declined to participate when approached , actual returns and demographic estimates by the interviewers were used to slightly adjust the sample . Assisting The Times in this poll was Davis Market Research Services Inc. of Calabasas .
