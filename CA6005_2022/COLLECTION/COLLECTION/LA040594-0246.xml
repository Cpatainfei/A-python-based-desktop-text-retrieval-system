   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : COUNTYWIDE ; AIDS GROUP OFFERS NEW EDUCATION PLAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Youth educators at the AIDS Response Program have developed &quot; rubberwear &quot; parties for college-aged students where safer-sex techniques and products will be demonstrated . The programs will be offered by the AIDS Response Program , run_by the Garden Grove-based Gay and Lesbian Community Services Center . Leigh Richards , coordinator of youth programs , said the &quot; rubberwear &quot; concept , which involves games and prizes , like a Tupperware party , was created to make_it more comfortable for young people to learn about safer_sex . People attending &quot; rubberwear &quot; parties will get free condoms . The center developed special programs in September for people between the ages of 18 and 24 , Richards said . More_than 5 # 000 people have attended the classes at college campuses and community service events , Richards said . Not everyone agrees that frank demonstration of safer-sex products is the way to protect people from AIDS and other diseases . A group called Choices / Teen Awareness Inc. in Anaheim teaches about AIDS at public_schools but advocates abstinence , not safer_sex . Choices director Priscilla Hurley has said she does not teach about condoms because she believes it weakens the abstinence message . Because condoms are not 100 % effective , it ' s not a good idea to teach young people to use them , she said . Richards also talked_about abstinence at a recent demonstration of the &quot; rubberwear &quot; program . &quot; It ' s obviously the best way not to get a sexually transmitted disease , &quot; she said , but she noted that studies show that some young people call themselves abstinent although they engage in sexual behavior -- including oral_sex -- that could transmit disease . She also said that people who do not prepare themselves for safer_sex may end_up having very risky sex under the influences of drugs or alcohol . WILLSON CUMMER</TEXT>
