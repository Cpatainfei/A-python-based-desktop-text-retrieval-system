   <TEXT> Like many losing bets , it seemed a sure thing at the outset . President Clinton ' s welfare reform experts reckoned that a 4 % tax on gambling revenue would be a good source of financing for expanded job training and other new programs for welfare recipients . Tax increases are always politically touchy , but Clinton ' s aides were confident that the public would accept a new &quot; sin tax &quot; on casinos . The potential payoff : $ 3.1 billion over five years . But only days after the tax proposal was floated , a group of Democratic lawmakers whose districts include gambling operations trooped to the White_House to raise objections . Casino owners launched a fierce lobbying effort of_their_own . The Administration quickly folded , with the President promising to find other funding sources for welfare reform . From slot_machine super-plexes to riverboat casinos , America ' s gaming industry has literally hit the jackpot . Legal gambling is now a $ 30-billion-a-year business , and Wall_Street analysts estimate it will double in size in just three years . Once limited to Las Vegas , Reno and Atlantic_City , the industry is breaking ground on projects from coast to coast . Casino gambling , on land or riverboats , is authorized or running in half the states ; parimutuel betting is legal in 42 . Along with gambling ' s explosive economic and geographic growth has come a corresponding increase in political influence . Nevada casinos have long been important lobbyists in Washington . But now the industry is operating at a new level , filling campaign war_chests with contributions , hiring well-connected lobbyists and mounting savvy public relations campaigns to overcome or neutralize the opposition . &quot; The emerging trend in the gaming industry is to pay more attention to federal issues , &quot; said Alan Feldman , a vice_president of Mirage Resorts Inc. , which operates casino-hotels in Las Vegas and Laughlin , Nev . &quot; We have , as an industry , national interests , and we should be participating in those. &quot; * Besides battling proposals to enact a federal gambling tax -- an idea that may resurface as lawmakers look_for ways to offset lost tariff revenues under a new global trade agreement -- casino operators say they are concerned with more mundane legislative issues . As a major service-sector employer , the industry wanted its two cents ' worth to be considered in the debate over health_care reform . And it is a vigorous advocate of federal , state and local programs that promote tourism and travel . In addition , gaming executives say they want to improve the industry ' s image . They point_out that in the 48 years since gangster Bugsy Siegel opened Las Vegas ' first resort casino , the Flamingo , gambling has evolved into a legitimate big-business enterprise , with some casino chains making the lists of the nation ' s largest public companies . * In terms of lobbying clout , the gambling industry still trails such traditional heavyweights as the National Rifle Assn . and the American Assn . of Retired Persons . But it appears intent_on rapidly muscling its way into the ring . &quot; We ' re a big industry , &quot; said Charles N . Mathewson , chairman of International Game Technology , a Reno-based slot_machine maker . &quot; But we ' ve never been properly represented in Washington. &quot; According to an analysis of 1993-94 Federal Election_Commission records by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics , three of the top 10 contributors of &quot; soft money &quot; political donations are closely tied to the gaming industry . ( Soft money is a term used to describe contributions to national political_party organizations for election-related activities . Unlike donations to individual candidates , soft money is exempt from contribution limits. ) Among the big contributors : * The Mashantucket Pequot tribe , which runs the highly profitable Foxwoods casino in Connecticut . It has given the Democratic National Committee $ 215 # 000 . * Frank J . Fertitta Jr. , former owner of the Palace Station Hotel-Casino in Las Vegas . He gave the Republican National Committee $ 230 # 000 in soft money last fall , followed by $ 24 # 000 in restricted donations , according to the CRP analysis . * Mirage Resorts ' Golden Nugget casino in Las Vegas , which chipped_in $ 230 # 000 to the GOP , and the company ' s chairman , Steve Wynn , who gave $ 20 # 000 . Some of the largest contributions to the GOP came_after Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour solicited financial_support last October at a meeting with casino executives at Mirage ' s Shadow Creek resort in Las Vegas . Besides these big donations , an independent computer analysis of FEC records by The Times reveals many smaller contributions , both restricted and unrestricted , during the 1993-94 election cycle : * $ 105 # 000 to the Republicans from Marnell Corrao Associates , a construction company headed by the chairman of the Rio Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas . * A $ 60 # 000 gift to the Democratic Party from Bally ' s Casino Holdings . * $ 37 # 750 to the two national parties from Mike Sloan , general counsel for Circus Circus Enterprises Inc. , and his wife . * $ 19 # 000 to the parties and their subsidiaries from William G . Bennett , former chairman of Circus Circus , and his wife . * $ 24 # 000 to Democratic Party committees from John E . Connelly , chairman of President Riverboat Casinos , and his wife . They donated another $ 20 # 000 to the victory fund of House Majority_Leader Richard A . Gephardt ( D-Mo. ) . * $ 24 # 000 to the GOP from Las Vegas ' Lady Luck casino . The industry is also a rich source of funds for individual campaigns . Circus Circus , which has its own political_action_committee , has spread $ 49 # 500 among Democratic and Republican office-seekers in 10 states . Caesars World Inc. has given $ 22 # 071 to candidates in four states . &quot; The industry is trying to be more politically savvy , &quot; one lobbyist said . &quot; They are giving_in the areas where they can be the most help. &quot; Some of the money finds its way back to the states . The Republican National Committee sent $ 50 # 000 to the Nevada GOP after receiving the Shadow Creek contributions , according to FEC records . In New York , a Republican state_senator called_for a federal investigation into allegations that a $ 100 # 000 donation from the Mashantucket Pequots to the state Democratic Party was intended to persuade Democrats to block a GOP bid to legalize gambling in the state . Casino executives say the industry does not favor one party over another , but some acknowledge that the Clinton_Administration jeopardized its relations with them by proposing a gambling tax . One Democratic Party official said the large contributions generated by the Shadow Creek meeting suggest that the industry leans toward the right . Executives who attended the session , many of whom are Democrats , scoff at the idea -- though they concede that their drive for greater influence in Washington is a broad-based effort . * Indeed , more_than mere dollars figure in the gaming companies ' growing political presence . Many are signing_up some of the nation ' s most sophisticated lobbyists -- a sign of an interest_group ' s coming of_age in Washington . GTech , a Rhode Island-based lottery company , has hired Akin , Gump , Strauss , Hauer &amp; Feld , one of Washington ' s premier law and lobbying firms . ( The company also contributed $ 109 # 543 in soft money to the two parties during the 1991-92 election cycle. ) MGM Grand is represented by Black , Manafort , Stone &amp; Kelly , another high-powered lobbying firm . * Several Native_American groups that operate casinos have retained representatives in Washington . The Mashantucket Pequots have hired Patton , Boggs &amp; Blow . The Seminole tribe of Florida is represented by the Jefferson Group . California ' s Morongo Band of Mission Indians has hired Winston &amp; Strawn . The 120-plus groups that operate gambling establishments have their own Washington trade organization , the Indian Gaming Assn . Las Vegas interests , led by Promus Cos . and International Game Technology , plan to launch their own trade group , the American Gaming Assn. , early next year . But industry sources say its development has been slowed by the traditional rivalries of gambling proprietors . Gaming executives have agreed that they want a big name to head_up the Washington trade group . Among the possibilities mentioned so far : Fay Vincent , the former baseball commissioner , and Tony Hope , chairman of the Interior_Department ' s Indian Gaming Commission during the George_Bush Administration . One industry lobbyist , who requested anonymity , said the person chosen to lead the new trade group will need a thick_skin , because &quot; we could become a sin tax target here. &quot; The organization &quot; is going_to be well-funded , &quot; said another lobbyist , who compared its potential influence to that of the tobacco lobby . &quot; They want to be a big force . They want to be very visible . And they want to be able to protect their interests. &quot; Although they are relative newcomers in Washington , casino operators already have plenty of political battle scars . Many have waged fierce state-level fights with church groups determined to keep gambling illegal . They are likely to face heavy opposition at the national level as well . &quot; You ' re seeing a snow_job on the part of state and national representatives who are trying to promote this industry , &quot; said Mike Russell , a spokesman for the Christian Coalition , religious broadcaster Pat Robertson ' s political organization . Arguing that gambling contributes to a variety of social ills , Russell said the Christian Coalition plans to track gaming industry political donations and include information about gambling in its voter guides . Industry officials are_well aware of what -- and whom -- they ' re up against , but they are confident that they have simple economics on their side . &quot; The moral question is fairly easily diluted by the message of revenue and job creation , &quot; one executive said . &quot; If you talk to representatives who come from states that now have gambling , if they ever had a problem ( with opposition on moral grounds ) , they don ' t now. &quot; The foray_into national politics comes at a key point in the industry ' s development . Las Vegas is adding several new multimillion-dollar casinos . Native_American tribes are scrambling to build casinos on their lands . For the first time , casinos , racetracks , riverboat operators and tribal councils that traditionally viewed each other with suspicion are joining forces . * But even as gaming proliferates across the country , some states and localities that have already opened their doors to the industry are having second_thoughts . Part of the problem appears to reflect the industry ' s explosive growth . Casinos and riverboats have saturated some areas of the country , leaving profits and revenues lower than expected . Casino operators in some Southern and Midwestern states complain that they have become stuck_in regulatory quagmires . To industry executives , the image-building exercise in Washington means they must abandon their traditional low profile . Relative to its wealth , the gaming industry has been among the nation ' s least visible corporate entities . Sen . Harry Reid ( D-Nev. ) , who served as head of the Nevada Gaming Commission for five years , said the industry has been &quot; behind the times &quot; in establishing its political credentials . &quot; There was a sense that we kind of kept things to ourselves , &quot; Reid said . &quot; We didn ' t bother anyone and they didn ' t bother us. &quot; From this point on , those bets are off . Full House Desperate for new sources of revenue and anxious to compete with their neighbors , the states have rushed to embrace gambling in its varied forms . Of the 50 states , 48 allow some form of wagering , if only bingo or charity casino nights . And 26 either have -- or have authorized -- casino gambling , at least in a limited form .
