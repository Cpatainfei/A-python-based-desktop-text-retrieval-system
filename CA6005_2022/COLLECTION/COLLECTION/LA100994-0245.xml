   <HEADLINE> HIKING : CALIFORNIA : A TOP-10 LIST OF PLACES WHERE PATHS LEAD TO CENTURY-OLD BUILDINGS , AND THE PAST COMES ALIVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Californians think_of state parks , most picture the natural treasures those parks preserve : ancient redwoods , dramatic mountains , warm sandy beaches from San Clemente to Refugio . Fewer travelers know that some parks also interpret California history . These State Historic Parks , as they ' re called officially , offer great walks , as well as learning experiences for young and old . They beckon us from our state ' s well-traveled highways to the remote byways where many are located . Some historic parks consist_of a single building in a remote locale ; others include blocks of significant structures surrounded by cities such_as Sonoma , Sacramento , Santa Barbara . The best way to see them is_on foot . From Old Town San Diego to the Old Custom House in Monterey , from the Santa Barbara Presidio to the Shasta County_Courthouse , the walking is easy -- a_few blocks , a half-mile , a mile at most . And all are fascinating hikes into history . Admission_charges vary from park to park . Like their nature park cousins , some of our state ' s 40 historic parks charge a $ 5 per vehicle entry fee . Others let you park your car free but charge a_couple_of dollars per person to visit a historic building or museum . Some parks charge for guided tours , some do not . Here is my top-10 list of walks , from south to north . It ' s admittedly subjective and , uncharacteristically for me , with history celebrated first and the walks themselves taking second place . Old Town San Diego State Historic Park , built around a central plaza , offers a six-block stroll through California history during the latter part of Mexican control , and later , during our early American days . Walkers can view La Casa de Bandini , built_in 1829 as a hotel and stagecoach station and now a restaurant ; La Casa de Estudillo , a mansion with a lovely courtyard -- among the finest of the original adobe buildings ; Casa de Altamirano , Old Town ' s first frame building , restored as it was in 1868 , when it housed the San Diego Union newspaper . Other historic buildings include a schoolhouse and a stable with a carriage collection . Shoppers can explore specialty shops , while diners can select from several Mexican restaurants or an Italian or Greek eatery . Old Town San Diego is located near the junction of Interstate 5 and Interstate 8 ; 4002 Wallace St. , San Diego , 92110 ; tel . ( 619 ) 220-5422 . El Presidio de Santa Barbara State Historic Park , located in downtown Santa Barbara on Canon Perdido Street a block east of the chief thoroughfare , State Street , preserves a part of the old military fortress built by the Spanish in 1782 to guard the central coast . A walking tour ( pamphlet available from Santa Barbara Trust for Historic Preservation ) can visit El Cuartel , the old guardhouse and Santa Barbara ' s oldest adobe . A must-see is the recently restored Presidio Chapel , a re-creation of the city ' s first church . The Spanish artifacts on the altar and colorful wall_paintings provide an interesting contrast to the building ' s simple exterior . Park headquarters , located in a historic adobe on Canon Perdido Street , displays artifacts found on the presidio . Several nearby adobes and historical buildings , as well as the beautiful Santa Barbara Courthouse and the Santa Barbara Historical Museum , entice the walker to further explore what is one of the West Coast ' s most walkable cities ; Santa Barbara Trust for Historic Preservation , P.O. Box 388 , Santa Barbara , 93102 ; tel . ( 805 ) 965-0093 . Hearst San Simeon State Historical Monument ( Hearst Castle ) offers four fabulous walking tours of the palatial estate of the late newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst . More_than 1 million visitors a year view the collection of world treasures on display in the 130-room home . Tour No . 1 , recommended for first-time visitors , includes the major rooms of the mansion , swimming_pools and gardens . Other tours , restricted to much smaller groups ( 12 to 15 people ) cover the upper levels of the castle , the castle ' s guest wing , gardens , pools , wine_cellar and guest house . Tour tickets are $ 14 for adults ; $ 8 for children 6 through 12 . After the tour , enjoy a picnic at William R . Hearst Memorial State Beach on San Simeon Road , east of California 1 . Nearby Sebastian General_Store , established in 1873 , sells food and snacks ; P.O. Box 8 , San Simeon , 94352 , tel . for recorded information ( 805 ) 927-2000 ; tel . MISTIX for tour reservations ( 800 ) 444-4445 . Monterey State Historic Park beckons California history enthusiasts , architects and city strollers to spend a day walking Monterey ' s &quot; Path of History. &quot; Guide maps and pamphlets are available at park headquarters next to the Old Custom House , the oldest government building on the Pacific Coast . The building now houses a collection of clothing , leather goods and china -- items typical of what was imported through the port of Old Monterey . After Mexico obtained its independence from Spain in 1821 , the Mexican flag flew over Monterey . It is this era and the early American era that followed that is emphasized by the park . The Robert Louis Stevenson House , Pacific House ( where there ' s a museum of California history ) , California ' s first theater ( which is still in_use ) , plus other old adobes are part of the park . A walking path leads a_few blocks south to Fisherman ' s Wharf and a_few blocks north to Cannery Row and the Monterey Bay Aquarium . Family hint : Most kids are lots more interested in watching barking sea_lions near the wharf than , say , tracing the origins of Monterey-style architecture . Tour the historic park before visiting Monterey ' s livelier attractions ; Monterey State Historic Park , 20 Custom House Plaza , Monterey , 93940 ; tel . ( 408 ) 649-7118 . San Juan Bautista State Historic Park in central California preserves the original town plaza , the old Plaza Hotel and the Mexican-era home of leading citizen Jose Castro . The park is located in San Juan Bautista , a_few miles off U.S. 101 between Salinas and Gilroy . During the last century , the town was an important stop on the stage route between Northern and Southern California . Drowsy but intriguing San Juan Bautista is_well worth the short detour today -- a nice rest stop for the Bay-bound traveler . Visit the well-preserved carriage and coach collection on display at the old stable . Further beckoning the walker is the modest Mission San Juan Bautista , founded in 1797 and now a parish church where Mass is still celebrated . Next to the church is a small history museum . Inviting shops and restaurants adjacent to the park suggest further exploration . Those who really want to get_off the beaten track will drive 11 miles out of town on San Juan Canyon Road and Fremont Peak State Park . A half-mile hike to the top of 3 # 169-foot Fremont Peak rewards the walker with a tremendous panorama of San Benito Valley , Monterey Bay and the rugged Santa Lucia Mountains of Big Sur ; P.O. Box 1110 , San Juan Bautista , 95045 ; tel . ( 408 ) 623-4881 . Sonoma State Historic Parks in downtown Sonoma , preserves Mission San Francisco Solano , last of the Franciscan missions built . The mission , founded in 1823 , is now a museum . A self-guided walking tour ( pick_up a map at visitor ' s center at the mission or at the barracks ) winds through the streets surrounding the town ' s central plaza and visits more_than a dozen buildings constructed between 1823 and 1855 . The parks include the home of Mexican Gen . Mariano Vallejo on Third Street , the mission , the soldier ' s barracks and the Casa Grande area ( servants quarters for Vallejo ) . In 1834 , Vallejo arrived in Sonoma with instructions to secularize the mission and lay out a town . On the north_side of the town plaza is the site of the general ' s first home , Casa Grande . Vallejo ' s home , his 1852 residence , is a half-mile from the plaza on Third Street . After admiring all that adobe architecture around Sonoma Plaza , you ' re surprised to find that Vallejo ' s home is built_in New England-style . Vallejo ' s storehouse is now a museum on the general , who after California became American territory , served as mayor of Sonoma and later as a state_senator . Sonoma ' s shady , open , Mediterranean-style plaza is a good spot for picnics or relaxation . Near the plaza are numerous shops and restaurants ; 20 E . Spain St. , Sonoma , 95476 ; tel . ( 707 ) 938-1519 . Bodie State Historic Park , between Nevada and Yosemite_National_Park , preserves a one-time gold mining boom_town during the 1870s- ' 80s . A park brochure details a lengthy 69-stop walking tour of Bodie , which has a remarkably diverse collection of buildings in various states of decrepitude . Bodie is a step back in time ; a curious , isolated world that at first glance appears to be far removed from the present . But there is also a perceptible sense of peace ; a comfortable familiarity about a place that was once home to nearly 10 # 000 people . Access to the abandoned town , southeast of the small_town of Bridgeport , can be tricky . Only one of the roads leading in is paved and even that ends_up as three miles of dirt and rock . But the rugged , time-consuming drive is quite fitting , considering the town ' s rough-and-rowdy heritage . Although the park is open year-round , once the winter snows hit , the roads are not plowed , leaving Bodie virtually inaccessible during the notoriously long and brutal winters . Intrepid souls still manage to get_through -- on mountain_bikes , cross-country skis and four-wheel drives . Yet the vast majority of visitors to Bodie arrive during the summer . The remote location , the ramshackle buildings , the cemetery at the edge of town -- the entire place gives the appearance of a Hollywood film set . But there ' s no fakery here . Part of Bodie ' s appeal is the dignity with which it ' s been allowed to age without insensitive restoration or commercialism . The old Miners ' Union Hall is today the park museum for Bodie , which is considered by many to be the best ghost_town in the West ; P.O. Box 515 , Bridgeport , 93517 ; tel . ( 619 ) 647-6445 . Columbia State Historic Park , on California 49 north of Sonora , southeast of Sacramento , offers an excellent self-guided walk through one of the best preserved of California ' s gold_rush towns . When gold was discovered here in 1850 , the hamlet of Hildreth ' s Diggins mushroomed into the metropolis of Columbia ( population 6 # 000 ) , making_it , for a short time , the second-largest city in California . Columbia boomed for 20 years as more_than a_billion dollars in gold was mined from the surrounding Sierra foothills . A 12-block , self-guided tour explores what is now a booming tourist town , complete with blacksmith shop , hotel , bakery , theater , shops , restaurants and saloons . Visitors can ride a stagecoach or pan for gold . A mile-long nature trail introduces visitors to Western Sierra flora ; P.O. Box 151 , Columbia , 95310 ; tel . ( 209 ) 532-0150 . Old Sacramento State Historic Park offers a wonderful self-guided walking tour , which begins at the visitor center_on Front Street ( pick_up a map there ) . Stroll along the balcony-covered boardwalk and relive the early days of California ' s state_capital while simultaneously enjoying the shops and restaurants in the historic buildings . The Big Four Building ( an operating replica of the 1880s hardware_store that once stood there ) , the building that was the western terminus of the Pony_Express in 1860 and the first meeting_place of the California Supreme Court are among the landmarks along the tour . Another highlight is the California State Railroad Museum , the largest interpreted railroad museum in North_America . You ' ll view some lovingly restored steam_engines , including the 1863 C.P. Huntington , as well as a variety of other rolling_stock in impressive settings . More cars and locomotives are_on display at a restored 1867 freight depot a block from the museum . Old Sacramento State Historic Park is easy to find via an Interstate 5 exit and a well-signed route along the city ' s one-way_streets ; 101 J St. , Sacramento , 95814 ; tel . ( 916 ) 445-7387 . Shasta State Historic Park , in the Klamath Mountains of northwest California , preserves the business_district of Shasta , known in the 1850s as the capital of our state ' s northern gold mines . Many of the buildings are in ruins , but the park preserves two major structures : the Shasta County_Courthouse and Litsch General_Store , now both museums . A self-guided walk ( brochure available from the park visitor center ) takes_in the historic business_district and the ruins of &quot; Brick Row &quot; which , during the prosperous 1850s , was once one of California ' s largest communities . Footpaths lead to a pioneer cemetery and to various ruins scattered about the park ; P.O. Box 2430 , Shasta , 96087 ; tel . ( 916 ) 243-8194 .
