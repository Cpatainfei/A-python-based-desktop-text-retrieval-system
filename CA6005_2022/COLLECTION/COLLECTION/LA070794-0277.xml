   <HEADLINE> VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : AIR IS GETTING CLEANER , AQMD SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you ' re breathing a little easier this summer , it ' s no surprise to the folks at the South Coast Air Quality Management District . Although the Southland ' s smog problems have not entirely blown_over , the number of Stage One smog alerts -- when ozone reaches . 20 parts per million and people are advised to avoid vigorous outdoor activity -- has steadily decreased during the last 10 to 15 years , said Joe Cassmassi , an AQMD senior meteorologist . Stage Two alerts , when ozone reaches . 35 p.p.m. and everyone is advised to avoid outdoor activity , have been virtually eliminated . The last Los Angeles Stage Two alert was in 1988 . The last San Fernando Valley Stage Two alert was in 1980 . Basinwide , Cassmassi said , Stage One episodes have decreased by about four a year . If that trend continues , he said , Angelenos could witness the end of the Stage One alert by the turn_of_the_century . &quot; We ' ve had an ongoing program of controls that has been in place for several decades now , &quot; Cassmassi said . &quot; That combined with the turnover in the auto fleet toward cleaner cars has been responsible_for the improvement we ' ve seen to date. &quot; Last year , which saw no Stage One alerts in Reseda , Burbank , Lancaster and Downtown , was the cleanest year on record , Cassmassi said . The improvements were probably a result of trends in air quality combined with the El Nino weather pattern , which favors cleaner air . This year , without the help of El Nino , AQMD expects anywhere from 30 to 34 Stage One episodes over the course of the smog season , which runs from late May to mid-October . Stage One Smog Episodes Stage On smog alerts are steadily decreasing in the Los Angeles Basin . There has not been a Stage Two alert sinice 1980 . The AQMD predicts an end to the Stage On alert by the end of the century if the trend continues . Note : Several communities had no alerts in 1990 , 1991 , 1992 and 1993 .
