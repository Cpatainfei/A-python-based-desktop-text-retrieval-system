   <TEXT> Police foiled an attempt to hijack an airliner carrying 164 passengers at a Moscow airport Thursday , hours after a man in southern Russia blew himself up when commandos stormed the airliner he had seized . Police at Moscow ' s southeastern Vnukovo airport quickly arrested a man who tried to commandeer a Tu-154 airliner early in the evening , the Ministry for Emergency Situations said . &quot; One terrorist has been seized without risk to passengers , &quot; ministry spokesman Karl Smolikov said . Security sources said earlier that the hijacker took_over the airliner and demanded a ransom of $ 2 million as well as a pistol , a radio , cigarettes , an English translator and a map of Iran and Iraq . The airliner had been_due to fly to the town of Mineralniye Vody in Russia ' s increasingly lawless southern frontier region , site of a rash of unsuccessful and sometimes bloody kidnapings this year .
