   <HEADLINE> POLICE ARE REAL WINNER IN GRAFFITI TAG CONTEST ; CRIME : THE GAME BETWEEN RIVAL CREWS WAS TO SPRAY-PAINT THE MOST INITIALS ALONG A STRETCH OF FREEWAY . BUT OFFICERS RESPONDED BY ARRESTING EIGHT AND SAY UP TO 60 YOUTHS MAY EVENTUALLY BE CHARGED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It began as a dangerous contest between two groups of teen-age taggers . The participants had to spray-paint their crew ' s initials as_many times as possible along a stretch of freeway -- dashing across busy freeway lanes , scaling billboard poles , slipping around barbed-wire barriers , hanging from freeway signs . The winners of the graffiti war would have bragging rights . The losers would have to disband their crew and never spray-paint the group ' s name again . For five nights last month , the tagging crews splattered a seven-mile stretch of the Long_Beach ( 710 ) Freeway between the Artesia ( 91 ) Freeway and downtown Long_Beach . They sprayed sound walls , overpasses , on-ramps and off-ramps . Some commercial buildings were covered from the ground up_to 10 feet -- apparently as high as the taggers could reach . A few business owners found graffiti on their roofs . When all_of the aerosol paint canisters were dropped , police said , the freeway stretch had been hit with about 25 # 000 &quot; tags &quot; ( crew initials ) . Damages approached $ 100 # 000 . &quot; This is definitely the worst case of damage from graffiti we ' ve seen , &quot; said Long_Beach Police_Officer Barry Fowks . Fowks and his brother , Officer Bob Fowks , led an investigation into the torrent of vandalism , which occurred from May 14 to May 19 from the Broadway exit in Long_Beach to the Artesia Freeway . Sheriff ' s deputies and California Highway Patrol officers also participated in the investigation . Six youths and two adults have been arrested , but police say as_many as 60 suspects may be charged before the investigation is wrapped_up . More important , the Fowks brothers say , they hope to break_up two of the most aggressive tagging crews in the area -- rivals that have long spread graffiti throughout several cities along the Los Angeles-Orange county_line , including La Mirada , Whittier , Buena Park , Fullerton and La Habra . * According to the Fowkses ' investigation , leaders of the two groups met sometime before May 14 and challenged each other to a battle . The rules were simple : Taggers would swarm into an area and paint their crew ' s three-letter initials over every available surface during a specified time_period . Then crew_members would take video or still pictures and count the total number of initials ( tags ) . The crew with the most tags would win . The two crews chose the Long_Beach Freeway because it offered a cleaner canvas for the battle , Bob Fowks said . &quot; They found some large , pretty virgin territory and went_to make a name for themselves. &quot; The taggers also believed their initials would not be recognized so easily outside their home turf , he said . But before members of the two crews could finish their game , the Fowks brothers were_on the case . They noticed a proliferation of new graffiti as they cruised the Long_Beach Freeway May 16 , but the initials were unfamiliar . &quot; If these kids had been local , it would n ' t have been a mystery to us , &quot; Barry Fowks said . &quot; We would ' ve known who they were by the names they used . But we didn ' t recognize the tags , so it took a lot of investigating. &quot; On May 17 , a witness saw at least two teen-agers spraying paint on the loading-dock doors of an industrial_park business near the Artesia Freeway , off Susana Road . The witness reported the taggers ' license_plate number to sheriff ' s deputies . That night and the next , sheriff ' s deputies , California Highway Patrol officers and the Long_Beach police_officers independently made vehicle stops that helped fill_in the pieces . One car with four juveniles had 26 cans of spray paint . Authorities also stopped a truck with two teen-agers who had fresh paint on their fingers . Eventually , the three agencies began comparing notes . Highway Patrol Officer Randy Campbell , who recently had been named the region ' s graffiti abatement coordinator , contacted the Fowkses , who had been in touch with sheriff ' s deputies . The Fowkses called city graffiti abatement workers while Campbell contacted Caltrans crews . They began to paint out the markings by the end of the week , before taggers could count up all_of their initials and declare a winner . On June 21 , Long_Beach police_cars filled with police , CHP officers and sheriff ' s deputies descended on 12 households in Los Angeles and Orange counties . They arrested two adults and five juveniles . Each was charged with felony vandalism and conspiracy . Another boy was arrested later in the week . The juveniles ' names have not been released because of their ages . The two adults , Michael J . Ross of Whittier and John Ehredt of La Mirada , both 18 , pleaded not_guilty June 23 to five counts of felony vandalism and one count of conspiracy . They are each being held_in lieu of $ 160 # 000 bail . If convicted , each faces a year in prison and fines of up_to $ 50 # 000 . The juveniles , if convicted , could be fined and lose their driving privileges until age 21 . They could also be put_on an 8 p.m. curfew seven nights a week for the next year and be required to maintain at least a C average in school and attend classes every day . Alternately , violators could find themselves spending six months in a youth camp . Authorities are planning another sweep of taggers ' homes and expect to make more arrests .</TEXT>
