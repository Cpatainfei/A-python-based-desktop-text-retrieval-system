   <HEADLINE> THE SCIENTIST AND THE CRUSADER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If Linus C . Pauling had never existed , it is possible that it would have been inconceivable that there could ever be anyone like him . He was a unique and controversial figure , not only to colleagues in whom he inspired the greatest respect and to professional rivals in whom he triggered complex emotions , but also to America ' s serious and dedicated chemistry students , who understood him as a great chemist , a great political crusader and inspiration . If America itself is sometimes thought of as a nation and society that is larger than life and unique to history , then perhaps this extraordinary scientist in some respects was a quintessential American legend . As a chemist he made staggering contributions . His 1939 book &quot; The Nature of the Chemical_Bond &quot; was regarded_as a landmark in the history of science and his work_on the molecular structure eventually led to his receiving the Nobel Prize for chemistry , in 1954 . As a citizen of the world concerned about the terrible power of nuclear_weapons , he was no less the towering figure . An outspoken critic of the spread of nuclear_weapons , by the 1950s he was a most prominent proponent of the view that nuclear_weapons should never even be tested . He crusaded tirelessly for that view and was rewarded , not only in 1962 , when he won his second Nobel Prize ( this one not for his contributions to chemistry but to world peace ) , but also in 1963 , when the world ' s major nuclear nations inked the international test ban treaty . Pauling ' s passionate and at times extreme views were filled with a surpassing certitude that sometimes inspired emotions considerably the opposite of love and affection . In the politically tendentious atmosphere of the McCarthy era his anti-nuclear crusade made him a convenient figure for attack by anti-communists ; and his highly original advocacy of massive dosages of Vitamin_C for an astonishing variety of ailments and diseases struck many scientific colleagues as speculative at the most charitable . Even so , whether tilting at nuclear arsenals or the common_cold , Pauling was undoubtedly a national treasure . His years at Caltech were the most thrilling and productive of his long and brilliant career . On Friday Pauling , 93 , died . He spent his last years at his beloved ranch near Big Sur in Central California , but for his many admirers here he will alway be thought of as a Southern Californian treasure .</TEXT>
