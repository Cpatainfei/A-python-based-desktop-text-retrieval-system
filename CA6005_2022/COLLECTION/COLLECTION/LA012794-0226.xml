   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; 77 FAMILIES GET LOANS IN 1ST WAVE OF FEDERAL AID ; RELIEF : SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION IS PRAISED FOR SWIFT DISBURSEMENT OF $ 2.5 MILLION TO THOSE WHOSE HOMES WERE DAMAGED IN THE QUAKE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Seventy seven families whose homes were damaged by last week ' s massive earthquake received one the first infusions of federal cash Wednesday in Van Nuys when the Small Business Administration handed_out $ 2.5 million in disaster relief loans . The first check went_to Eli Landaverde of Arleta , a 24-year-old stock clerk , who picked_up the initial $ 10 # 000 installment of his $ 25 # 700 loan at the Mid San Fernando Valley Chamber_of_Commerce on Wednesday afternoon . &quot; It took four days , &quot; said Landaverde , whose family applied for federal aid Saturday to fix wall cracks , repair a toppled fence and replace possessions destroyed in the Jan . 17 temblor . &quot; It was great. &quot; Despite widespread complaints that government aid agencies have been slow to respond to people in need , the 27 families who picked_up their loan checks Wednesday praised SBA officials for working quickly to process their applications . Fifty other families will have their checks mailed . &quot; It was fast , fast , fast , &quot; said Betty Widener , 71 , whose Granada Hills home was heavily damaged in the 6.6 quake . She and her husband , Carl , have been sleeping_in their motor_home parked in the driveway for the past week . The SBA disaster loans are available to anyone who suffered losses in the quake and are intended to pay_for losses not covered by private insurance . Because the loans are administered by the government , repayment terms are generally longer and interest_rates are lower than those offered by private lenders . By Wednesday , SBA officials had sent_out 86 # 000 disaster relief loan_applications to families and merchants whose homes or businesses were damaged in the quake . Of that number , about 2 # 200 had been returned and will be processed over the next several days . &quot; This represents the beginning of long-term assistance in Southern California , &quot; said Mike Howland , the SBA ' s acting regional administrator . SBA spokesman Tom MacKenzie said about 70 % of loan_applications are approved and about 90 % of loan recipients qualify for a low-interest rate -- 3.625 % -- because they would likely be unable to obtain private credit to cover their losses . Personal_loans , which can be repaid over 30 years , are capped at $ 200 # 000 for home improvements and $ 40 # 000 to replace possessions . Merchants whose businesses were affected by the quake can also apply for loans of up_to $ 1.5 million . Default rates vary from region to region , but MacKenzie said the national rate is 2 % to 3 % . &quot; It ' s very low -- in the low single-digit range , &quot; he said . Robert Belloni , area director of the SBA ' s disaster relief programs , said the loans disbursed Wednesday ranged from $ 2 # 700 to $ 215 # 000 , but averaged between $ 45 # 000 and $ 50 # 000 . Bob and Pat Hopkins , whose Simi Valley home was declared uninhabitable by building inspectors , said demolition teams have already begun clearing their lot . Their loan will help rebuild their house and their lives . &quot; This helps a lot , &quot; said Pat Hopkins , 56 , a retired police_sergeant who applied for her loan the day after the quake . It was approved two days later . &quot; You ' re so used_to government being slow , but this was fast. &quot; To protect against fraud , SBA officials said loan applicants must have their property inspected to ensure that it was indeed damaged by the quake . MacKenzie also said the loans are disbursed in installments so the SBA can monitor how the money is spent . &quot; We urge people to keep their receipts , &quot; MacKenzie said . &quot; This is designed not only to protect the taxpayers , but also to protect people from getting ripped_off by contractors. &quot;</TEXT>
