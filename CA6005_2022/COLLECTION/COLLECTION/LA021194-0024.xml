   <HEADLINE> REELS FROM THE RIM ; THE FILMS IN FESTIVAL HONG KONG , AT GLENDALE ' S REGENCY ONE , DELIVER A KARATE CHOP TO THE STEREOTYPICAL KUNG FU FLICK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What a way to toast a new year . A Chinese New Year accompanied with Chinese films representing some of the best in classic and modern Hong Kong action-comedy thrillers . It starts today -- this second day of the Chinese lunar_calendar ' s Year of the Dog -- as the Pacific Regency One Theatre in Glendale embarks on a two-week run of the Second Annual Festival Hong Kong . The festival , which received positive reviews and netted nearly $ 50 # 000 in ticket sales last year at the Santa Monica 4-Plex and Burbank Media Center ' s AMC Theatres , features 14 films dating as far back as 1978 and as recent as 1993 . No longer just stereotypical kung_fu flicks , these Hong Kong imports have attracted a growing non-Asian audience in various cities across the country , said Tom Gray , festival brainchild and president of Rim Film Distributors Inc. Gray has made a one-year commitment to show only Asian films in Glendale ' s Regency One . The appeal of the Hong Kong films stems not only from the upgrade in story lines -- action mixed with drama , romance , sex and humor -- but also from some of the talented actors themselves , considered throwbacks to such handsome and dashing Hollywood characters as Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. , Gray and critics have said . Most of the films ' original Chinese titles have been changed for Western distribution , some of them spiced_up with allusions to American movies ( &quot; Robotrix , &quot; an erotic movie , for instance , from &quot; RoboCop &quot; ) . English subtitles also have been added , for audiences that may_not understand the mainly Cantonese-speaking characters . &quot; All of these films are now getting a wider acceptance that would not exist 10 years ago , &quot; Gray said . &quot; Really , the Hong Kong films are covering every single genre . . . . We ' ve become an alternative to the basic bland Hollywood movie. &quot; Nick Browne , professor of critical studies at UCLA ' s film and television department , has become an Asian film buff himself , and he agrees . &quot; The Hong Kong cinema , seems to me , has crossed over and has found a general American audience , &quot; Browne said . &quot; It ' s gone way beyond a kung_fu movie . This is very sophisticated action drama. &quot; Browne , one of the authors in a recently published book on &quot; New Chinese Cinemas , &quot; particularly lauds the directing of John Woo , whose 1991 hit &quot; Once a Thief &quot; plays Feb . 21-22 and epitomizes the enhanced Hong Kong style of filmmaking . &quot; Once a Thief &quot; is actually about a trio of international art thieves -- Joe ( Chow Yun-Fat ) , Cherie ( Cherie Chung ) and Jim ( Leslie Cheung ) -- trained to steal valuable paintings for their cruel , selfish master-teacher ( Kenneth Tsang Kong ) . For an hour and 46 minutes , they laugh , smile , cry and grit their teeth through a series of cunning heists , shootouts and slapstick and romantic interludes , including a hilarious scene in which Joe maneuvers a wheelchair along the ballroom_dance floor with the grace of Fred Astaire . All the while , he ' s smiling as if he ' s disco dancing a la John Travolta . The film , also surprisingly , opens in Paris , with French dialogue , in the first couple of minutes before the action moves_on to the Riviera , Hong Kong and the United States . &quot; ( It ' s ) cleverly constructed and entertainingly told , &quot; Browne said . &quot; There ' s humor and action that goes beyond any Chinese context . It ' s something that an American audience can recognize and appreciate right away. &quot; &quot; Chow Yun-Fat seems to me a kind of a Hong Kong Cary Grant , &quot; he added . &quot; He ' s suave , romantic and has a good_sense of humor. &quot; One half of today ' s double_feature is Kirk Wong ' s &quot; Crime Story , &quot; starring Jackie Chan as a Hong Kong police inspector who tries to solve the kidnaping of a businessman , a story based on a real case . Gray likens Chan , who does his own stunts , to Douglas Fairbanks Jr . &quot; Jackie Chan is a combination of all_the great action stars of America , &quot; he said . &quot; He ' s been the No . 1 action star in Japan , for example , in the last seven years. &quot; Standing outside the Pacific Regency last week , the tall , gray-haired film distributor and producer embodies the spirit of a Chan character , who usually defies the odds and comes_out a winner in the end . Gray first did_it when he formed Rim Film in September , 1992 , and three months later experimented with the first two-week Festival Hong Kong at Santa Monica ' s Nuart , taking_in $ 30 # 000 in ticket grosses , which he considered successful . He has since moved the film showings to the Santa Monica 4-Plex , where he leases a movie screen that attracts an 85 % non-Asian audience . &quot; We had a lot of skepticism , even in Hong Kong , &quot; he said . &quot; They said it would never play. &quot; Indeed , the producer who played a role in bringing the &quot; Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &quot; to the big screen hopes to see Santa Monica ' s success duplicated in Glendale -- a city of 180 # 000 that is trying to strengthen its arts and entertainment offerings , as seen in the recent reopening of the Alex Theatre . Indeed , the Regency One , faced with slumping ticket sales , had shut_down at the end of July , 1993 . Between August and December , the 600-seat movie_house featured commercial hits for the hearing impaired , shown with subtitles , said Bob Baron , theater manager . ( That service has since moved to another site , the Pacific Roxy Theatre , 417 1 / 2 N . Brand Blvd. , Baron said. ) Gray saw an opportunity . &quot; We looked_at the demographics of Glendale and surrounding areas , &quot; Gray said . &quot; We thought it was a nice place . . . for us to build a circuit . * &quot; We ' re not catering to an Asian audience . We ' re catering to wide masses -- people who want to see the best in Asian cinema. &quot; Said Glendale Mayor Larry Zarian : &quot; I think it would be a plus for the city . Any time that you bring_in arts to the city , it ' s a plus . Art is something that you don ' t ( always ) need to understand in words. &quot; &quot; I ' m thrilled by it , &quot; said Browne , of UCLA . &quot; It means that it ' s not confined to the Chinatown cinemas . It ' s going mainstream. &quot; After the Hong Kong festival ends Feb . 24 , Gray plans to continue showing films from various parts of Asia , including Japan , Korea and the Philippines , at the Regency One . He said he is also looking_into stretching the Asian film circuit to theaters in Pasadena , Gardena and possibly the San Fernando Valley . And he insists that American interest in Asian films will not fade like yesterday ' s fad . &quot; We see it as an ongoing venture . . . . We ' re going to do a lot of experimenting with films , festivals , retrospectives of some of the great ( Asian ) directors . &quot; Our whole goal is to keep it fresh. &quot; Festival Hong Kong in Glendale The Second Annual Festival Hong Kong will play_at the Pacific Regency One Theatre , 210 S .
