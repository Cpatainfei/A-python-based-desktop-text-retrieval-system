   <HEADLINE> WHAT PRICE POLLUTION ? OIL SPILL ECONOMICS OF EXXON VALDEZ TRIAL ; ENVIRONMENT : ALASKANS MEASURE LOSSES IN DIVERSE WAYS -- MISSING DUCKS , DEAD SEALS , WORM-INFESTED SALMON , A WAY OF LIFE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For Eddie Lavshakoff , it ' s the bleak silence of a bay once clamoring with ducks . For John Totemoff , it ' s the empty ledge where he used to hunt seals . For Gail Evanoff , it ' s the ominous oddities -- herring with lesions , a worm-infested salmon -- that make her suspicious of the waters she once trusted to sustain her . The residents of this Aleut village say they don ' t need scientific studies or economic models to know that Prince William Sound still suffers from the Exxon Valdez oil spill . They keep their own watch , and for them the greatest losses are impossible to measure . &quot; Everything ' s just wrong since the oil spill , &quot; villager Mary Kompkoff said . &quot; I was brought_up eating food off the land and water , and we never thought_twice about things when we ate them . Now , I ' m thinking. &quot; Chenega Bay ' s 70 residents are among 14 # 000 Alaska Natives , commercial fishermen and others suing Exxon Corp . for up_to $ 16.5 billion in the wake of the Exxon Valdez . It ' s been five years since the biggest oil spill in U.S. history smeared 11 million gallons of North Slope crude across Alaska ' s wild southern coast . Now , the biggest environmental lawsuit in U.S. history is taking_stock of the disaster ' s economic and ecological impacts . The trial is in its third month and far from done . But already it is clear to Chenega Bay residents that some costs can never be tallied . &quot; This is our lifestyle , our culture , &quot; John Totemoff said , standing on his small fishing_boat , just in from an early morning trip that netted 16 salmon for his family ' s use next winter . &quot; How could I put a price_tag on this ? &quot; He ' s not the first to ask . Lawsuits started piling_up against Exxon just four days after the Exxon Valdez tanker struck Bligh Reef on March 24 , 1989 . Two weeks later , Exxon took_out full-page newspaper_ads , promising to &quot; meet our obligations to all those who have suffered damage from the spill. &quot; That broad promise soon required qualification . As the oil spread , ultimately fouling 1 # 500 miles of coastline , the spill ' s economic repercussions reached even farther across Alaska . There were some winners , such_as the fishermen &quot; spillionaires &quot; who chartered out their boats to Exxon during the $ 2-billion cleanup . But there also were many victims -- from the coastal fishermen who claimed they were ruined by lost fishing_seasons , to the homesteader far inland who grumbled that his moose-hunting suffered because of cleanup-related traffic on the Glenn Highway . The homesteader was among the few who didn ' t sue Exxon . By last winter , the roster of plaintiffs included tour-boat operators and fishing guides , sea-otter researchers whose oiled subjects had died by the thousands , and thousands of net menders , boat builders , cannery workers and seafood wholesalers dependent_on the fishing fleet . Many plaintiffs were dismissed in March , when U.S. District Judge H . Russel Holland in Anchorage ruled that onshore businesses had no legal claims if they hadn ' t suffered direct physical damage from the oil . &quot; There is no question but that the Exxon Valdez grounding impacted , in one fashion or another , far more people than will ever recover anything in these proceedings , &quot; Holland wrote . The claims remaining are complex enough . Attorneys for 10 # 000 commercial fishermen and 4 # 000 Alaska Natives have been arguing their case before a federal jury in Anchorage since May 9 , seeking more_than $ 1 billion in actual damages and up_to $ 15 billion in punitive damages from Exxon and tanker Capt . Joseph Hazelwood . A few blocks away in a state courtroom , attorneys for six coastal towns and six Alaska Native corporations are seeking $ 100 million in a trial that began July 5 . Exxon lost the first phase of the federal trial in June , when jurors decided that recklessness on the part of Exxon and Hazelwood led to the spill . The plaintiffs had argued that Hazelwood was drunk the night of the spill and that Exxon had known about his drinking for years . Next , the jury considered claims by commercial fishermen that not only did the spill ruin salmon and herring harvests by disrupting Prince William Sound ' s ecological balance , it depressed prices for fish caught by tainting the reputation of Alaska salmon . Exxon argued that the ecological damage was not as severe as the plaintiffs claimed , and that world market conditions and competition from farmed salmon were to blame for falling fish prices . For three weeks , dueling scientists , economists and other expert witnesses debated the spill ' s biological and economic fallout . The plaintiffs ' attorneys drew upon state and federal studies to portray a marine environment torn_apart by oil . Government scientists estimate 300 # 000 to 645 # 000 birds were killed outright by the oil , and some devastated bird populations , including common_murres and harlequin ducks , are failing to reproduce in areas that were oiled . Young sea_otters are dying in unusual numbers in western Prince William Sound , possibly from feeding_on mussel beds where oil remains trapped . Most important to fishermen , runs of pink salmon returning to Prince William Sound have plummeted for the last two summers , after strong showings in 1990 and 1991 . Likewise , springtime herring harvests , strong in 1991 and 1992 , were cut_short this year and last year when too few fish showed_up . Many herring had organ damage and lesions . But Exxon ' s experts say blaming all_the sound ' s problems on a spill that happened five years ago is overly simplistic . Herring and salmon populations fluctuate naturally because of changes in ocean temperature and food supply , they say . They also contend that Exxon ' s cleanup efforts , combined with winter storms , have scoured nearly all_the oil from Prince William Sound beaches . Even in 1989 , one scientist testified , the dissolved oil in most areas did not reach levels toxic to fish . In the stale air of the windowless courtroom , attorneys have struggled to keep the working-class jury ' s attention . &quot; Let me bring_up another chart that will help explain this , &quot; an Exxon lawyer said during one tedious session on fish forecasting . Two jurors traded tight smiles . Another tilted her head back and yawned . The judge rubbed his eyes . It was 9:30 a.m. The jury started deliberating the fishermen ' s claims July 12 with a verdict form that looked_like a Chinese menu . Year by year , species by species , area by area , they had to decide whether the oil spill caused poor_fish runs or reduced the prices paid to fishermen . Then , they had to calculate a dollar amount for damages . The fishermen sought $ 895 million in compensation . Exxon suggested about $ 100 million . For all_the imponderables involved , the commercial fishermen ' s claims at least dealt with a market commodity . The trial ' s next phase , dealing with claims by Alaska Natives that the oil spill kept them from their subsistence hunting and fishing , plunges the jury into more nebulous territory . Natives do not sell the wild foods they harvest , so how does one calculate their value ? What price the loss of seagull eggs or seal livers , of herring roe on kelp ? Judge Holland ruled the Natives could not sue for losses to their cultural heritage . He limited their damage claims to the economic_value of their lost harvests , using equivalent store-bought foods as a guide . He did not mention what those equivalents might be . Soon , the jury will face the greatest imponderable yet : How do you punish , if you punish at all , one of the world ' s largest corporations , a company with sales of $ 111 billion and profits of $ 5.3 billion last year ? Exxon points to its efforts after the spill -- the $ 2 billion it spent on cleanup , the $ 900-million settlement it reached with state and federal agencies to compensate for damage to natural_resources , the $ 300 million in damages it paid voluntarily to fishermen and others . &quot; We don ' t need any punishment , &quot; said Exxon attorney James Neal . &quot; I think we ' ve been punished enough. &quot; In Chenega Bay , Mary Kompkoff had another view . &quot; No money in the world will change what Exxon did to us , &quot; she said . &quot; No money in the world will ever make_it the same. &quot;</TEXT>
