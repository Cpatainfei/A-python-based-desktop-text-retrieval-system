   <HEADLINE> THE ROMANCE OF COVERED BRIDGES ; YOU DON ' T HAVE TO GO EAST TO FIND THESE ANTIQUE TREASURES . OREGON HAS 53 OF THE SHELTERED SPANS , MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE IN THE WEST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For a while , it seemed everyone was talking_about bridges . . . in particular the covered bridges Robert Waller described in &quot; The Bridges of Madison County , &quot; his best-selling novel set_in Iowa . The book has lured thousands of tourists from all_over the world to Madison County . But you don ' t have to go_to the Midwest to see covered bridges . Oregon has more . More , in fact , than any other state west of the Mississippi . It ranks sixth in the nation , behind Pennsylvania , Ohio , Vermont , Indiana and New Hampshire , Eastern destinations most people more readily associate with these antiques . From my home_in Ashland -- home of the Oregon Shakespeare Festival that each year draws Southern Californians in droves -- there is a lovely day trip to be made_out into the countryside , through the covered bridges and back into history . Those of us who live here , in the southwestern corner of Oregon , sometimes feel we ' re far from the action . Portland is a six-hour drive_away , Los Angeles 12 or so . Most people who leave Interstate 5 -- the north-south freeway that bisects our Rogue Valley -- come_to Ashland only to attend the Shakespeare Festival , which this year began Feb . 18 and runs_through Oct . 30 . But visitors soon discover that our sunny valley is bordered by tiers of gently rolling mountains to the east , and that they can drive winding roads through those hills to a cluster of pretty lakes , then turn north at the cobalt depths of Crater Lake , which caps beautiful Crater Lake National_Park . To the southwest , the roads wind through Redwood National_Park , a virgin redwood forest , and lead to the rocky , wind-swept Pacific coast . And then there are the bridges . Like most romantics , I spend a good_deal of time mentally ambling down lanes and byways of the past . I am particularly drawn to covered bridges , whose wooden floors once rattled under the weight of horse-drawn wagons and buggies . They are colorful pieces of Americana that also constitute a romantic chapter in Oregon ' s past . Under their protective roofs , early pioneers held dances and church socials . Little children dropped small stones through the cracks into rushing streams below . Politicians used their shelter as sites for voter rallies . Lovers ducked into welcome shadows for fleeting trysts , earning the structures the nickname &quot; kissing bridges. &quot; But social , political and amorous pursuits aside , Oregon ' s covered bridges are a testament to the spirit of men and women who first forded -- and then tamed -- its wild waterways . The state is blessed with 27 # 000 miles of rivers and streams and plentiful rain . In Oregon , an uncovered bridge , constantly exposed to wet and sometimes freezing weather , would last only five to seven years before starting to rot , according to historians who have studied the bridges . Settlers soon learned that adding a roof to a bridge increased its life span immensely , perhaps up_to 35 years . Construction of these practical and economical structures particularly thrived during the 19th and early 20th centuries , before weatherproofed lumber became readily available in the area . Some 53 ( others count 54 , depending_on how the term &quot; covered bridge &quot; is defined ) of these charming relics of a gentler time survive in Oregon today . Most of them are clustered in five western counties and are easily accessible on , or near , good roads . While modern thoroughfares still pass_through some of the bridges , many cannot handle the weight of heavy trucks and automobiles . Those have been made into pedestrian_bridges , open only to foot and bicycle_traffic . Most of Oregon ' s covered bridges were built of the sturdy Douglas fir that grows so abundantly here . Some were community projects , financed by benefit dances and socials . Others were strictly commercial affairs , belonging_to entrepreneurs who exacted a toll from travelers . Some bridge builders were professional carpenters , other just local residents who needed a way to transport logs or farm produce across rivers . At one time during the late 1800s , as_many as 450 covered bridges spanned the creeks and gullies in Oregon . But time , floods and the ever-increasing size and weight of automobiles and trucks rendered most of them obsolete . Many of those still standing have been preserved by counties , civic clubs or individuals . Their sites range from near Portland , in the north , to as far south as Ruch ; from Yachats , on the coast , to Bend , in the state ' s center . The longest is the Office Bridge , at 180 feet ; it spans the north fork of the Willamette River at Westfir , near Eugene . The oldest is probably 80-year-old Drift Creek Bridge , south of Lincoln City near the coast ( although historians argue that others may have been built earlier and that records of their construction are lost to time ) . In between , are a rainbow of bridges , interesting as much for their histories , as for their styles and settings . With a map from the Covered Bridge Society of Oregon in_hand , a friend and I laid_out a daylong driving tour that would take us to the five southernmost bridges in an easy circle from Ashland . The morning of our trip last October dawned bright and sunny . We knew we wanted to picnic somewhere along the way , so our first stop was Cantwell ' s Market in Ashland . Once the young_woman at the deli counter had filled our picnic basket , we were_on our way . Our journey took us north from Ashland on Interstate 5 to Medford , where we turned north on Oregon 62 . This road , usually called Crater Lake Highway , scrolls through low rolling terrain and several rural communities and small_towns , and within 40 minutes , leads to Eagle Point , the first stop on our journey . What we found there was a beautiful little bridge , spanning Little Butte Creek and linking one side of tree-shaded Royal Avenue with the other in the center of a quiet , rural town . Still sometimes called Antelope Creek Bridge , this structure is unique for its bucolic setting in the middle of Eagle Point . It was constructed in 1922 by Wesley and Lyal Hartman to span Antelope Creek , a_few miles from the village , and to connect it with the rural countryside filled with farms . In the late 1800s , Eagle Point was a shipping port for the Pacific and Eastern Railroad , and it was from there that flour_milled at the Butte Creek Mill was shipped to nearby towns . By the early 1970s , the bridge had deteriorated so badly that traffic was forbidden and its future looked bleak indeed . But the local citizens pitched_in to repair the 58-foot-long bridge , which in 1987 was moved to its present site over Little Butte Creek and dedicated to pedestrian_traffic . On the bright morning of our arrival , the only person crossing the bridge was a youngster on his bike , happily savoring the freedom of childhood in a small_town . Tiny Lost Creek Bridge was second on our tour -- a good choice for us since it was only about 15 miles from Eagle Point through a lush , fertile valley . To get there we continued east on Royal Avenue , which became Brownsboro Highway and soon joined Oregon 140 . We followed it east and made a right turn ( south ) at the exit onto South Fork Little Butte Creek Road , toward the town of Lake Creek . We drove through Lake Creek four miles to Lost Creek Road and turned right . We found the bridge at the road ' s dead-end . At just 39 feet , Lost Creek Bridge is the shortest in the state and another pedestrian-only span . The sign_on it says it was built_in 1881 , even though county records list its construction date as 1919 . What we do know for_sure is that it served the little logging and farming community , which was also a stagecoach stop , by linking it to sawmills across Lost Creek . Much of the local economy depended_on trees -- the nearby forests providing early loggers with what at the time seemed an inexhaustible supply of timber -- and all_of it had to be hauled by wagon to the sawmills . This was made easier by construction of the bridge_over Lost Creek . After several lifetimes of service , a highway was constructed that bypassed the bridge and a 1964 flood nearly washed it away . The bridge fell_into more disrepair and was nearly hidden behind an overgrowth of trees and brush . But the people of Lake Creek ( not to be mistaken for the bridge by the same name in a different part of the state ) organized in 1985 after a nearby covered bridge was torn_down , virtually without warning ; they raised money and started a &quot; save our bridge &quot; campaign . Working together in the tradition of old-time barn raisings , they rebuilt and reinforced the structure . As we approached the weathered little bridge , we were delighted to find that it stands just steps from Walch Memorial Wayside Park . Bright red roses rambled over the park ' s rustic fence , and a wooden arch welcomed guests to a quiet retreat of green lawns and flowering_gardens . The little oasis is watered by an underground irrigation system , making_it a stark contrast to the surrounding dry fields . By this time the sun was high overhead . My traveling companion , Bob Baures , and I were hot and hungry , so we ducked into one of the park ' s open-sided shelters . Bob spread the red-checked cloth on the table while I dug_into the basket : Buffalo_wings , carrot and raisin salad , Cheddar_cheese , whole wheat rolls , apples and a bottle of Chardonnay . We lingered long over that lovely lunch in the quiet garden . Finally , refreshed and ready for more bridges , we climbed back into my Toyota and headed out for Wimer Bridge in the town of the same name . To get there we backtracked to Eagle Point and turned right ( north ) on Oregon 62 , driving about four miles north to its intersection with County 234 . We turned left and headed west for 13 miles through beautiful Sam ' s Valley , the little hamlet of Gold Hill and into the town of Rogue River . Pine Street , the main_street there , becomes East Evans Creek Road just outside the city_limits , and we followed it north . The turnoff to Wimer is about eight miles from Rogue River , but the sign was practically hidden by roadside brush . We had both become distracted watching the passing fields , where cattle and horses grazed contentedly , and nearly missed the little sign indicating our turn . But eventually we found the road , and the imposing Wimer Bridge and its waterway , Evans Creek , came_into view . According to local history , this area was the site of fierce Indian wars in the mid-1800s . A scant 30 years later it was a thriving farming community boasting its own post_office . The original Wimer Bridge was built_in 1892 ; it lasted 35 years and was rebuilt in 1927 . By the 1960s , the old bridge was again shaking and shimmying enough to give cautious folks real pause about crossing . It had to be closed , finally , in the 1970s , but local efforts in 1985 restored it to its former beauty . It ' s one of only a_few remaining Oregon bridges that actually is a working bridge , serving a community . Today , you can drive vehicles under eight tons over the sturdy Wimer bridge and right into town . We had to retrace our steps back to Rogue River and get_on busy I-5 to reach Grave Creek Bridge , the fourth on our list . After driving on those pleasant , rolling , quiet back roads , the interstate was less than pleasant , but there was no other quick way to Sunny Valley . Fifteen miles north of Grants Pass , we turned right onto old Oregon 99 , a short , half-circle remnant of the road that was bypassed when I-5 came roaring through . The road still serves people lucky enough to live_in pretty Sunny Valley . Crossing Grave Creek less than a mile from the exit , we soon found the 105-foot bridge . It was in excellent condition , freshly painted and well-maintained for all_of its 73 years . Perhaps because of its pristine appearance , Grave Creek bridge is among the most frequently photographed of all covered bridges in the state . Unlike many covered bridges , which have little inside illumination other_than the daylight that streams through cracks between the boards , A few have small , quite ordinary holes for windows . In contrast , Grave Creek Bridge boasts 12 large , well-designed Gothic-style windows . The bridge ' s name has an interesting background too . About 150 years ago , during a Native_American uprising , a young_girl named Martha Leland Crowley died and was buried along the local creek . It was unnamed at the time , so residents christened it Grave Creek in her honor . Years later , the Oregon state legislature decided the name was , perhaps , a bit too morbid , and renamed it Leland Creek . No way , said the locals , who continue to call the pretty waterway Grave Creek , and to this day , it ' s listed as such on some maps . We saved little McKee Bridge for last so we could stop off in historic Jacksonville for dinner on the way home . Jacksonville is a National Historic Landmark filled with pretty Victorian homes . To reach the bridge , we returned to Interstate 5 and drove to Gold Hill , where we took Old Stage Road into Jacksonville and through the Applegate Valley to the town of Ruch . In Ruch , we turned left on Upper Applegate Road and continued seven miles further to the bridge . Farthest south of all_of Oregon ' s covered bridges , the McKee stands 45 feet above the Applegate River , eight miles north of the California border . Prospectors worked this area for many years , and the bridge , built_in 1917 , served as a rest stop for miners traveling between the town of Jacksonville to the north and copper_mines to the south . As the area attracted residents , logging trucks , laden with Douglas fir , used the bridge to haul timber to local sawmills . The bridge proved equal_to the task for approximately 40 years before a modern concrete-and-steel span replaced it . Then , like many others before it , the old McKee Bridge seemed doomed . For generations , though , it had been a focal_point for the community , and the people there couldn ' t stand_by to see their most prized possession disappear . A grass-roots plan to re-roof and strengthen the old structure took_over the town . As the local newspaper described it : &quot; Hundreds of man_hours of labor and several thousands of dollars worth of materials have been donated in the project of saving the McKee covered bridge. &quot; Once rebuilt , it reopened for pedestrian_traffic in the late 1950s . A lovely little state park stands beside the bridge today . We heard children laughing as we walked under its trees and followed the sound to find a whole bevy of youngsters playing in a nearby swimming_hole . One brave fellow had climbed the river ' s opposite bank and was swinging across on a rope , just as Huck Finn might have done on some_other river at some_other time . The afternoon sun was slanting low through the trees by then , and it was time to go_home . We were a little tired , but couldn ' t help feeling closer to the men and women who ' d pioneered this beautiful state and built these charming old bridges . It had been a good_day .
