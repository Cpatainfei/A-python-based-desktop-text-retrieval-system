   <HEADLINE> MAN IS CONVICTED IN JAPAN OF L.A. MURDER ; COURTS : OUTCRY OVER SLAYING OF JAPANESE STUDENTS IS REMINISCENT OF 1981 HOMICIDE . IN THAT CASE , A TOKYO BUSINESSMAN CLAIMED STREET CRIMINALS SHOT HIM AND HIS WIFE . AS IT TURNED_OUT , HE HAD STAGED THE SLAYING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In 1981 , Kazuyoshi Miura parlayed the Japanese stereotype of Los Angeles into an alibi for murder . He told police that his wife was shot dead and he was wounded as they snapped photos in the streets of a metropolis the Japanese regard_as one of most violent cities on earth . As was the case this week in the murders of two students in a San Pedro carjacking , the Japanese outcry was tremendous and the U.S. response was abject . Except that Miura had staged his wife ' s murder for his own financial_gain , believing he could never get_away with it in Japan -- but might be able to in Downtown Los Angeles On Wednesday , in a verdict that capped one of the most sensational international whodunits in Japanese history , the Tokyo fashion importer was convicted of murdering his wife . At a different moment in time , the Tokyo court ' s decision might simply have marked the final chapter in a 13-year saga of murder , money and sex . But on the heels of this week ' s international uproar over the carjacking murders of a Japanese-American student and his Japanese friend , the verdict also offered a dark and ironic echo of the long-held Japanese perception of Los Angeles as violent and dangerous . One commentator on Japan Television , which covered the Miura verdict live , speculated that Miura chose the United States as the scene of his crime &quot; precisely because America is a society of guns. &quot; The recent deaths of Marymount College_students Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura , the commentator added , only underscored that point . Meanwhile , at a news_conference called_in Los Angeles to announce the Miura verdicts , Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti could not help but note the similarities in the outrage sparked by the two cases , 13 years apart . But -- like so many public officials in Los Angeles and Washington , D.C. , this week -- he stressed that the deaths of Ito and Matsuura on Friday night were the result of a random and &quot; uncommon &quot; act of violence . &quot; I would not have my children living here , &quot; he said , if that was not the case. &quot; The slaying of Kazumi Miura , on the other hand , was something else entirely . The case that the Japanese press would eventually dub the &quot; L.A. Shooting Affair &quot; began to unfold on Nov . 18 , 1981 , on Fremont Avenue two blocks from the Downtown Music Center and nine blocks from police_headquarters . Initial news accounts were that Kazumi Miura , 28 , of Tokyo , a tourist visiting with her businessman husband , had been taken_to County-USC Medical_Center in extremely critical condition with a bullet in her head . Her husband , Kazuyoshi Miura , then 34 , had been shot in the leg , in broad daylight on a busy street . Miura told police his wife was cut_down before his eyes as he focused_on her in his camera viewfinder . The businessman , an importer who had been coming_to Los Angeles on business nearly every month for nine years , told police that the couple had parked their car at 11:45 a.m. and were taking pictures of the Downtown skyline when two young_men pulled_up in an old , dark green American car and demanded money . When the Miuras hesitated , one of the men pointed a handgun out the car_window , shot the Miuras , then hopped_out and stole $ 1 # 200 from the wife ' s purse and the husband ' s pockets , Miura said . Indeed , police noted , several pieces of currency lay fluttering on the sidewalk where the fallen couple lay bleeding . Miura wasted no time in placing blame on the hateful plague of urban violence , American-style . From his hospital_bed , he told reporters that he was writing to then-President Reagan , then-Gov . Edmund G . ( Jerry ) Brown Jr . and then-Mayor Tom Bradley &quot; to protest this incident and ask proper care and protection against this sort of incident happening again. &quot; &quot; Many young Japanese will be coming_to the U.S. with their dreams on their hearts , &quot; Miura said then . &quot; I strongly hope this accident will never occur again. &quot; A month later , Miura returned to Japan , leaving his wife in an L.A. hospital . As she had been since the attack , Kazumi Miura , the mother of a 13-month-old child , was blind , paralyzed , unconscious and subsisting on life-support machinery . At one point , Miura lashed_out at the state of California because he had tried and failed to get a crime victims program to subsidize his hospital bills . He did , however , persuade the U.S._government to fly his wife back to Japan in a special U.S. Air_Force military_hospital jet . Kazumi Miura died in a Japanese hospital almost a year to the day after the attack , and the furor over the still-unsolved crime died_down . Then a series of news_articles surfaced in Tokyo in 1984 . Among other things , the accounts noted that Miura had collected 155 million yen ( about $ 655 # 000 ) on life_insurance policies he had taken_out on his wife in the United States and Japan . There was also a bizarre confession to a Japanese newspaper by a onetime Japanese porn actress who told reporters that three months before the shooting , Miura had hired her to kill his wife in their room at the New Otani hotel . Michiko Yazawa , who said she was Miura ' s lover at the time , said Miura had told her that if she eliminated his wife , he would marry her and split $ 200 # 000 in insurance benefits . So , she said , she posed as a dressmaker and visited Kazumi Miura at her hotel_room , ostensibly to take her measurements . But after smacking the woman several times with a two-pound , hammer-like tool , Yazawa said , she lost her nerve and fled . Miura told authorities his wife had been injured in a bathroom fall . And then there were questions about the disappearance of another Japanese visitor to Los Angeles -- a woman who had earlier been Miura ' s accountant and lover . Two years before the shooting , Chizuko Shiraishi , 34 , had filed for divorce and hopped a plane to Los Angeles on a 30-day tourist visa , listing a Hollywood Holiday Inn as her destination . The hotel_manager told reporters at the time that he had no record of a guest by her name , but that a Mr. and Mrs . Miura had checked_in the day she arrived . The sighting by the hotel_manager was the last report that the woman had been seen alive . But her bank records showed that , shortly after her departure , Miura withdrew about $ 21 # 000 from her account in Tokyo . And when a Japanese reporter finally gave her dental charts to a Los Angeles detective in 1984 , they were traced to a corpse that had been found in a vacant field in Lake View Terrace two months after Shiraishi disappeared . Jane Doe No . 88 had languished , unidentified , in the county morgue for five years . The disclosures spawned a media frenzy , as reporters from TV to tabloid magazines raced to dish details of Miura ' s life -- from his past criminal_record to his string of lovers and even half-nude photos of him surrounded by naked women in S &amp; M garb at a sex swap party . The media overkill actually stirred some public sympathy for Miura , with calls_for media responsibility and respect for his rights , and the businessman eventually wrote two books detailing his persecution by the media . In fact , he was just wrapping_up a televised denial of any role in his wife ' s death when police arrested him at the posh Ginza Tokyo Hotel . Four TV networks broadcast Miura ' s arrest . Initially , Miura was tried only on attempted murder_charges , based on the New Otani incident . But after his 1987 conviction on those charges , the investigation of the fatal shooting picked_up steam , and authorities from Los Angeles -- who had been conducting a parallel probe all along -- traveled_to Japan to complete their work_on the deaths of Miura ' s wife and lover . In 1988 , with Miura already serving a six-year sentence for attempted murder , he was finally charged with murder , under a Japanese law that allows its citizens to be prosecuted in Japan for crimes committed in other countries . Also charged was a man who had been a buyer for his company and who police said had acted_as his accomplice . Yoshikuni Matsumoto , an Osaka native who had graduated from USC and had gone_on to become Miura ' s agent in Los Angeles , was accused of conspiring with Miura to murder his wife . On Wednesday , Matsumoto was exonerated on that charge , but convicted of smuggling a rifle and 100 pounds of ammunition from the United States to Japan . He was sentenced to one year and six months in prison . Both men are expected to appeal , and Japanese legal_experts noted that the split verdict leaves one crucial question unanswered : Who fired the fatal shot ? But for the Japanese media this week , that question was secondary to_the_point raised by a Japan Television network correspondent : &quot; The murder of two Japanese exchange students just occurred in Los Angeles , &quot; the correspondent said , &quot; and showed how crime is increasing because of the guns in American society. &quot; Times staff writer Andrea Ford contributed to this story .</TEXT>
