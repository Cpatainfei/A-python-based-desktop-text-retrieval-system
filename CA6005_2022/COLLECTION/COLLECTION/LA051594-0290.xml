   <HEADLINE> THEFT OF CREDIT A PERVASIVE PROBLEM ; FRAUD : DOWNEY CASE REFLECTS SCAMS THAT RIP OFF AN ESTIMATED $ 1 BILLION YEARLY NATIONWIDE IN GOODS , CASH . IT ' S BECOMING KNOWN AS CRIME OF ' 90S .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Each time , the news came as a surprise . One woman received a note from a department_store thanking her for buying $ 600 worth of cosmetics she knew_nothing about . Another discovered $ 3 # 200 in_charges for jewelry she had never seen . A third learned that someone used an automated teller machine to withdraw $ 1 # 000 from her credit_account . Authorities say one person , Debra LaGrone of Downey , carried_out each transaction . According to court documents , LaGrone allegedly stole credit_card numbers and other personal information while working_at various mortgage companies , then purchased thousands of dollars worth of goods in the names of people she had never met . When Downey investigators searched LaGrone ' s townhouse in January , they found credit_cards with other people ' s names and account numbers , jewelry that had been fraudulently purchased , and a spiral notebook filled with names , home addresses and credit information of people who had recently refinanced their homes . Authorities identified at least 15 individuals across Southern California as victims , in addition to numerous small merchants , department_stores , credit_card companies and banks that incurred thousands of dollars in losses . LaGrone , 39 , who has held a variety of jobs in the loan business in the past 20 years , faces 16 felony charges , including commercial burglary and receiving stolen property . She is in jail in lieu of $ 55 # 000 bail and awaits a June 9 pretrial hearing in Norwalk Superior_Court . LaGrone has pleaded not_guilty and contends that a friend who was recently convicted of a similar crime left the questionable credit_cards at LaGrone ' s house and gave her some of the merchandise . Investigators say the case is a brazen example of what they call the crime of the ' 90s -- credit_card fraud perpetrated by individuals and organized rings who rip_off an estimated $ 1 billion a year in goods and cash nationwide . Thieves have been known to steal credit information from mailboxes and garbage bins , during home burglaries or after purse-snatchings . But authorities are increasingly concerned about insiders -- bank tellers , real_estate_agents , automobile salespeople , loan processors and others -- who have access to confidential_information that can open_doors to lines_of_credit and bank_accounts . People with credit_cards rarely lose huge sums_of_money when their cards are used to make unauthorized purchases . Their liability is limited to $ 50 per card . But it often takes months to purge their credit reports -- a process some have called a bureaucratic nightmare . Even worse , some victims say , is the anguish of knowing that someone has tapped into their personal lives and has access to their Social_Security_numbers , home addresses , dates of birth and other family history . &quot; I feel violated , &quot; said Orange resident Debbie Gallegos , an alleged victim of LaGrone . &quot; Someone ( has ) assumed your identity . that ' s what is terrifying . You don ' t know who ' s doing_it or why. &quot; Last year , LaGrone allegedly obtained Gallegos ' credit_card account numbers , a secret password on one account and new credit_cards . Authorities say LaGrone made $ 1 # 000 in withdrawals on Gallegos ' account at an automated teller machine in Downey and received $ 2 # 500 in cash_advances that were charged to Gallegos ' account at various Sears stores , court documents show . Downey investigators suspect that LaGrone gained access to Gallegos ' credit information while working_at a Newport Beach mortgage company last summer . Gallegos refinanced her home through the company early last year . When company officials checked recently , they found that information was missing from Gallegos ' file , according to court records . LaGrone is accused of obtaining confidential_information on numerous other people from files at companies in Los Angeles and Orange counties . She allegedly contacted credit_card companies , reported_cards missing and then requested replacements as well as address changes , according to court records . Posing as the cardholders , LaGrone allegedly applied for loans and obtained cash_advances in other people ' s names , made cash withdrawals and ordered merchandise through department_stores , jewelry boutiques and clothing catalogues , records show . In one instance , one of the victims had nearly the same name , Dorothy LaGrone . Over a several-month period last year , Debra LaGrone allegedly used Dorothy LaGrone ' s name and credit history to obtain a $ 2 # 500 loan and purchase thousands of dollars in goods , including $ 9 # 300 in jewelry from a Costa Mesa store , court records show . Even an attorney hired to represent Debra LaGrone early in the case was apparently caught in the web , police say . LaGrone allegedly used someone else ' s credit_card number to pay $ 1 # 000 to attorney John McDonald , court records show . In all , authorities documented more_than $ 50 # 000 worth of purchases , many of them allegedly delivered to Debra LaGrone ' s Downey residence and to her mother ' s former home_in Bellflower . Her mother , Kathleen Montgomery , said no goods were delivered to the Bellflower home . Downey fraud detectives , who spent 2 1 / 2 months on the case , say the actual amount of purchases and number of victims may never be known . &quot; I think we uncovered the tip of the iceberg , &quot; said Sgt . Greg Griffin , who led the Downey police_investigation . &quot; There were so many credit_card numbers in ( LaGrone ' s ) day planners that we didn ' t have time to check them all. &quot; Sheriff ' s fraud detectives began an investigation last July after a security officer from the Broadway department_store in Cerritos complained that someone had made several unauthorized purchases on a customer ' s credit_card . Downey detectives later began their own investigation after receiving a fraud complaint from a credit_card company . LaGrone was arrested Oct . 4 and released on bail two days later . She was arrested again Jan . 14 after police searched her Downey residence . She told police that the goods found in her house had been given to her or sold to her by a friend who had also worked_at some of the same mortgage companies . LaGrone also said credit_cards in other people ' s names and account information had been left_behind by the friend . LaGrone said the friend was having mail in other people ' s names delivered to the Downey address . Authorities said the friend , who was recently convicted of fraudulently using a bank_card in an unrelated case in Orange County , is not a suspect . LaGrone ' s attorney , Charles Mullis , scoffed at police contentions that LaGrone masterminded a clever scheme . He said authorities have no proof that LaGrone was the person who purchased fraudulent goods over the phone through companies such_as the Home Shopping Network , which sell merchandise on television . &quot; If Debra LaGrone is such a sophisticated criminal , why was she dumb enough to have all_the stuff mailed to her address ? &quot; Mullis asked . &quot; Police assume it was Debra LaGrone because the merchandise was shipped to her house , but it ' s not an open-shut case. &quot; LaGrone ' s daughter , Sheri , said her mother , a 1972 graduate of Lynwood High_School , would not jeopardize a career of more_than 20 years in the loan business in which she rose from a secretary to loan processor jobs earning more_than $ 40 # 000 a year . Sheri LaGrone , 18 , also was arrested but was not charged . She said she frequently turned_away goods delivered to the condominium in other people ' s names . She insisted , however that her mother , who is divorced , is innocent . &quot; I know my mom would n ' t do this , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' m watching my mother go_through this trouble for something she didn ' t do . It seems like the police can send her to jail , innocent or not innocent. &quot; Police say they have identified Debra LaGrone in surveillance photographs at an automated teller machine in Downey withdrawing funds on the credit_account of one of the alleged fraud victims , Debbie Gallegos . LaGrone told police the card belonged_to the friend , who had asked LaGrone to withdraw money . Two eyewitnesses also have identified LaGrone in court as the person who purchased jewelry and applied for a loan using other people ' s credit or identification , court records show . Also , Downey investigators found a credit report in LaGrone ' s townhouse belonging_to a client of one company where she had worked . LaGrone told police she had taken the file home to work_on it , records indicate . Details of the search and the victims ' accounts are documented in a stack of police reports nearly an inch thick . Consumer advocates say cardholders have good reason to be concerned about whether their credit information is secure . Many companies don ' t do an adequate job of screening employees who have access to personal information on customers , critics say . Two of LaGrone ' s previous employers , for instance , said they ere unaware that she had been convicted in 1988 on charges of check forgery and sentenced to 60 days in jail and three years ' probation . They said they would not have hired her had they known of the conviction . Critics also say there are so many credit_cards in_use that offenders can go undetected for months or years . Credit_card companies say they have tightened security during the past decade . They use computers to detect unusual spending activity on clients ' accounts , such_as numerous expensive purchases in a short period . Some credit_card companies place clients ' pictures on cards and use three-dimensional images to make alterations more difficult . But critics say those safeguards have limited value because so many credit purchases are now made_over the telephone . Investigators also say that as the technology to fight the problem improves , so will the crooks ' ingenuity . &quot; If we come_up with the most foolproof system to beat credit_card fraud , somebody is going_to find a way to beat the system , &quot; said Sgt . John Garcia of the Los Angeles County sheriff ' s forgery and fraud detail .</TEXT>
