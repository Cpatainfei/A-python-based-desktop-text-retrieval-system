   <HEADLINE> CBS HAS WON U.S. BROADCAST RIGHTS TO 1998 WINTER GAMES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> CBS will announce today that it has won the U.S. broadcast rights for the 1998 Winter_Olympics in Nagano , Japan , industry sources said Tuesday . CBS emerged the winner after Fox Broadcasting Co. , the other contender for the TV rights , declined to bid , a source said . Fox had been seriously weighing a bid for the 1998 Winter_Olympics in the wake of its surprise $ 1.58-billion winning bid for a new NFL contract . One observer said Fox ' s commitment to the NFL , where analysts expect it to lose between $ 600 million and $ 700 million over the course of the four-year contract , probably played a role in Fox backing_away from the Olympics . A considerable amount of prestige was at stake for CBS . With the NFL headed to the upstart fourth network , CBS faced the unwelcome prospect of seeing its sports franchise erode even further if it did not have a big-ticket item such_as the Olympics . ABC and NBC had already dropped_out of the bidding , saying it had become too costly . Sources said CBS will pay about $ 350 million for the broadcast rights , signaling that TV fees for the now biannual event continue to escalate . During the 1980s , the networks lost hundreds of millions of dollars on the NFL , Major_League Baseball and the Olympics . CBS Chief_Executive Laurence Tisch will reportedly make the announcement in New York along with officials from the International Olympic Committee , which awards the TV rights . A spokesperson for CBS declined to comment . The Olympics in recent years have turned_into a financial quagmire for the networks , and each time the networks vow to hold_the_line on TV rights fees . CBS said it broke_even on the 1992 Winter_Olympics in Albertville , France , for which it paid $ 243 million . The network has also paid $ 300 million for the 1994 Winter_Olympics scheduled for next month in Lillehammer , Norway . And NBC is paying $ 456 million for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta . For the 16 days and nights of the 1994 Winter_Olympics in Lillehammer , CBS reportedly has already sold more_than 85 % of its advertising time . The network has said it is about $ 50 million ahead of where it was five months before the 1992 Albertville Games . On top of the rights fees , the network must field an army of producers and technicians halfway around the globe to cover the event . The production tab can exceed $ 70 million .</TEXT>
