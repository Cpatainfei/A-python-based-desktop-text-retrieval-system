   <HEADLINE> INSANITY RULED_OUT IN KILLING OF ABORTIONIST ; TRIAL : JUDGE DISALLOWS DEFENSE STRATEGY . BUT STATE WON ' T SEEK DEATH_PENALTY IN PROSECUTION OF ACTIVIST CHARGED WITH SLAYING DOCTOR IN FLORIDA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An activist accused of killing an abortion doctor will not be allowed to use an insanity defense , a judge ruled Monday during the first day of jury selection . Michael F . Griffin , an anti-abortion activist and Christian fundamentalist , is charged with first-degree murder in the March 10 , 1993 , shooting of Dr. David Gunn . Circuit Judge John Parnham approved a deal in which the state will not seek the death_penalty in exchange for testimony from a jail official who overheard a conversation between Griffin and his wife . Parnham also warned that he would tolerate no outbursts , showboating or politics in his courtroom . After a defense_attorney complained about spectators wearing lapel pins , Parnham said he was banning any items stating a point_of_view from his courtroom during the trial . &quot; This trial itself is not an opportunity for a demonstration , &quot; Parnham said . &quot; The trial is not an opportunity for a protest . And this trial is not an opportunity for the lawyers to obtain exposure. &quot; Gunn , 47 , was shot three times in the back when he arrived_at Pensacola Women ' s Medical Services to perform abortions while a protest was being held_on the opposite side of the clinic . Griffin , 32 , had wanted to use an insanity defense . Prosecutors argued that such a defense should not be allowed because Griffin , on his lawyers ' advice , refused to be examined by a state mental_health expert . Of the 146 prospective jurors who were called_in Monday , 36 were excused for health , employment or other personal reasons . The others filled_out a questionnaire , and 35 were asked to return today for questioning by lawyers . Others were to be called_back later in the week . Parnham has ordered that prospective jurors be identified only by number and that they be questioned in private on abortion-related matters_to protect their privacy . He feared they could be embarrassed or endangered by their responses to such questions . The judge said he expects jury selection to take about five days and the rest of the trial at least seven days . He has ordered that the jury be sequestered . Crowd-control barricades were in place around the courthouse . About 10 abortion rights activists demonstrated on one side of the building , and half_a_dozen anti-abortion activists were_on the other . Later , a passerby confronted four Griffin supporters as they held a news_conference a block away . When the Rev . David Trosch , a Roman_Catholic priest , said abortion was tyranny , Laura Cobham shouted : &quot; Tyranny is when men like you try to take_over the bodies of women. &quot; Trosch was removed from his Magnolia Springs , Ala. , parish last year after he tried to place a newspaper_advertisement condoning the killing of abortion doctors . Trosch and other members of Pensacola-based Defensive Action said they do not encourage such slayings but believe they are justified . Eight abortion opponents held a prayer vigil Monday at the clinic where Gunn was killed .</TEXT>
