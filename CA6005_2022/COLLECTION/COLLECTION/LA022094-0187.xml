   <HEADLINE> TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS : ' MAINFRAME RENAISSANCE ' IS REALLY THE REVENGE OF THE NON-TECHIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Is the mainframe_computer back in_style ? It seems a ridiculous question to ask_in this day and age . IBM , the leader in mainframe computing forever , has seen its sales of mainframes cut nearly in half over the past five years . Sales of its minicomputers , in which it is also the market leader , declined for the first time last year by about 10 % . Other mainframe or minicomputer companies are either dying or stagnant . Nonetheless , the corporate keepers of computing argue that mainframes are roaring back . My colleague at Computerworld , Editor-in-Chief Bill Laberis , wrote an editorial a_few weeks ago titled &quot; Big Box Redux. &quot; &quot; It seems that after suffering through the dark ages of hyperbole , overselling , misrepresentation and outright fraud , &quot; he wrote , &quot; users are now being sung a different tune by vendors , analysts and others about client-server computing and the real world. &quot; Indeed , you can observe -- at gatherings of people who manage corporate computer_systems -- a kind of growing ebullience , a sense that the world has come_to its senses and will let the computer managers once again do their jobs as they should . The fortunes of the mainframe_computer are a kind of analog for the balance_of_power between the keepers of computing inside large companies and the users of computing -- executives , owners , managers and workers . For years , between about 1965 and 1985 , the non-technical people in corporations were held hostage by the technical people . Mainframes and minicomputers were so expensive , so difficult to comprehend , so unrelated to the skills of managing the functional areas of a company , that the people who knew how to run them could affect the most basic fortunes of the company . And the functional managers weren ' t able to tell how they did_it . The classic case of this occurred when American Airlines ' computer people figured_out how to make all_the reservations on their computers , thereby taking_control of an entire industry ' s ability to record its transactions with customers . American ' s &quot; Sabre &quot; system has been cited repeatedly as an example of how information was becoming a functional area itself , rather than just a service for the other functions in the company . It was enough to make the non-computer people feel_like the computer people were taking_over the business . So this question of the status of the mainframe can be pretty important . The power of computing officials has been declining along with their big , centralized computers . In job surveys , &quot; chief information officer &quot; ranks as the most unstable position in executive ranks . It ' s no wonder then that after more_than a decade of being roughed_up by the chaos of millions of personal_computers , computer managers want to believe they are getting_back in control . The change that lets them believe this is the arrival of &quot; client-server computing , &quot; which has transmogrified from a description of a particular kind of computing into a kind of clarion call_for what Computerworld ' s Laberis calls &quot; a more structured mainframe mentality. &quot; Others might describe it as a call_for returning to Soviet-style , centralized control of information processing . In the old days , mainframe_computers were controlled by terminals attached_to the central processing unit by wires . The rise of personal_computers represented a real problem for corporate computing managers , because PCs weren ' t attached_to anything and could be controlled by individuals . Then groups in corporate departments started linking PCs together to keep track of small pieces of information that hadn ' t been important enough to manage on mainframes or minicomputers . The groups started to link each other together into loose networks of networks , often for the purpose of using electronic_mail . By last year , most big companies had launched some kind of formal effort to begin to integrate all_of these networks and all_of their mainframe systems into a single integrated system . Enter client-server computing . The original idea of client-server computing was to describe the notion that , in a larger system , you would have large and small computers cooperating with each other , as &quot; clients &quot; requesting services and &quot; servers &quot; providing services . The idea was to differentiate this kind of computing from the old kind of computing -- described as &quot; host-terminal &quot; or , more appropriately , master-slave . Servers and clients are supposed to cooperate and spread the computing around the system in a perfect digital representation of a kind of free-enterprise economy . In their attempt to regain some semblance of control over the fortunes of the company at_large , the corporate computing officials are now looking_at client-server computing as their salvation . They see a vast sea of wires connecting together all those obstreperous personal_computers -- and they believe they can once again gain control of the computing resources of the company . What they fail to recognize is that client-server computing is actually the ultimate revenge of the non-technical managers . All the economic pressures are for vendors to build small , inexpensive components that can be plugged into these vast information_systems by anybody -- even those without serious technical training . The portion of the system that will be managed by the computing officials will inevitably become a smaller piece of the whole pie . And the functional managers of the company will gain increasing control over the resources they need -- whether to design and manufacture products , to market and distribute them or to manage the operations of the company . The mainframe may look_like it ' s back in_style . But it won ' t be long before it becomes clear that 1994 was just the last gasp of a dying technology .</TEXT>
