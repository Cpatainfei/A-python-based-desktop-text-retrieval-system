   <TEXT> Covered in rose petals , their faces painted funereal black , hundreds of thousands of Brazilians bade farewell last week to Ayrton Senna , the Formula One driver who crashed and died on the racetrack at the Grand Prix at Imola , Italy . Senna was buried in tomb No . 11 at Sao Paulo ' s Morumbi Cemetery to a 21-gun salute and honors normally reserved for a head_of_state . And no wonder . In life , he was Brazil ' s , and probably the world ' s , ablest race_car driver , who took the sport to new limits . In death , he seems destined for even grander things -- for the Brazil that mourned his passing and poured into the streets to get a last look_at his coffin lost not only a champion , but a part of its soul . It was as though Senna , who was 34 , had left_behind not only a grief-stricken family , a desolate girlfriend and an armoire full of trophies , but 150 million orphans . Papers bellowed his passing . A three-day period of mourning was declared . Perhaps half a_million mourners watched his coffin pass_by in the largest funeral procession Sao Paulo had ever seen . Senna is now a postage_stamp , a logo , a cartoon . Several avenues and racetracks have been renamed for him . Dozens of newborn Ayrtons were baptized . The loss of an idol , especially by sudden_death , can stagger any nation , but the way each people mourns also tells much about the national character . The emotion that washed over Brazil at Senna ' s death showed a society at once fractured and galvanized by grief . Men of industry stood shoulder to shoulder with domestic workers to wave goodby as his coffin passed . University_students wept alongside bricklayers . It was not simply passion that bonded Brazilians at this moment but something deeper . In a country of brutal contrasts , where the poor see opulence every day but may_not share_in it , the belief in idols can be a balm for the bruises of misery and want . Achievers like soccer immortal Pele , or the Olympic gold medal volleyball team , or the TV_star Xuxa , are worshiped not merely for their individual triumphs but because their achievements are public goods , annexed by the entire nation . After all , Brazil , says anthropologist Roberto DaMatta , is &quot; an enchanted nation. &quot; In this way , Senna was not just a champion but a medium . He and his racing machine transported Brazil to some higher , richer plane . All last week in Brazil was a time of anguish , puzzlement and tears . But there were more violent passions raging as well . If countries can be said to have self-esteem , the death of Senna shattered Brazil ' s . Many fell_into depression or shock . One woman in Curitiba committed suicide and left a note that she was &quot; going_to join Senna. &quot; Others lashed_out in fury , throwing invective at the wind . &quot; You ! Indecent people , &quot; bellowed Edgar de Mello Filho , director of the Interlagos racetrack in Sao Paulo , speaking on nationwide television of Formula One officials . The veins in his temples bulged . &quot; Until when are you going_to keep_on killing drivers ? &quot; Such outrage , though compelling , misses the point . Formula One is a sport cherished not only for speed and precision but also for danger . The risk , the peril are part of the attraction , maybe the centerpiece of Grand Prix . Defying death is what spectators want to see , and why sponsors sponsor it . If Formula One were risk-free , would anyone bother to watch ? What would be left of boxing without bodies crashing to the canvas ? Yet Brazil was nursing injury to its soul last week , and to suggest a more dispassionate explanation was to whisper in a gale . &quot; Murderers ! &quot; Mello Filho howled . &quot; See if you can sleep at night. &quot; Some commentators went even further . &quot; We are now being expelled from Formula One , a sport for the rich of the First World , &quot; wrote Villas-Boas Correa , the normally understated columnist for the Jornal do Brasil . Senna , by Correa ' s logic , had been Brazil ' s and the Third_World ' s great dark hope , Caliban ' s revenge . &quot; Senna spoiled the party for the rich. &quot; Not only was Senna murdered , he died at the hands of venal capitalists , &quot; a sacrifice on the altar of modernity , &quot; who got mere &quot; scraps of profits &quot; for running dire risks , said another newspaper_columnist . And it was not just any capitalists who did Senna in , it was the imperialists . &quot; A field hand for a multinational , &quot; anthropologist Regina Abreu called him . Never mind that Senna , the son of a wealthy Sao Paulo landed family , was one of the richest athletes in the world , who got that way by skillfully negotiating with the sponsors . He plastered his pilot ' s suit , helmet and car with that collage of logos and brand names because of a deal , not servitude . Part of the rage was understandable . What else but crime or conspiracy could account_for such a cosmic injustice ? But some deeper malady was mobilizing Brazil , one that renders the nation as the imagined victim of the designs of others . Even President Itamar Franco showed some of the symptoms . &quot; Since the beginning of ( Portuguese ) occupation , we have had to live with injustice , &quot; he wrote in an op-ed piece . * Many , perhaps most , of the mourners were not even Formula One fans . Many probably had no special feelings for Ayrton Senna before he died . More_than a_few , Senna ' s former rival , Nelson Piquet , told Veja magazine , looked_on precisely to gawk at the &quot; spectacular accidents &quot; that claimed his life . In fact , for years Senna was best remembered for his feuds with the press , his moodiness and the barbs he traded with rivals . Hardly_a man of the people , Senna was private , introspective and something of a mystic , who closed his eyes and put both palms on his car before each race . But time endeared Senna to his fans -- time and trophies . He was a winner , and Brazil has precious few winners these days . There are plenty of leaders , but they are hardly_a reliable category . When they are remembered at all , it is for their misdeeds , mainly helping themselves to taxpayers ' money . The last time Brazilians rallied by the hundreds of thousands , it was to be rid_of a president , Fernando Collor de Mello , found by Congress to have commanded his own kickback and influence-peddling scheme . Then they learned that some of those same righteous congressmen had had their own hands in the till . Senna , by contrast , was an honest journeyman hero . &quot; He was the right kind of hero . He worked for what he won , &quot; said anthropologist DaMatta , a longtime student of the national psyche . &quot; He was the Brazilian miracle. &quot; Ah , the miracle . There it is again . It is as if Brazil ' s morass -- inflation , crime , corruption -- is an ordained infliction . Such conditions require a miracle , and miracles are the ouevre of heroes , not humans . Life can make champions , but only death , tragic death , can manufacture a mythic hero . Senna , the man , the driver , was admired . The late Senna , the martyr , is adulated . But there was something disturbing in the outpouring of tears and rage . Does_it take death ( or an impeachment , or a corruption scandal ) to fill the streets and bring_out the bonds of solidarity and national pride ? Anthropologist DaMatta says no , that the desire for victory is there , dormant , and that even a tiny miracle -- an honest pol ? a World Cup ? -- could awaken it . Yet a quarter-century has gone_by since Brazil ' s last World Cup title , the last time the whole country hoisted flags and wept for a victory , not defeat . * Lately , Brazil seems alloyed more by frustration and loss . &quot; We live a nationalism of tragedy more_than of triumph , &quot; writes Marcelo Coelho in the Folha de Sao Paulo . &quot; Everyone comes_together in the sense of a tragic Brazil. &quot; Listen to Marcelo Pontes , a senior political observer : &quot; A tragedy was necessary to show that loving ( Senna ) , Brazilians love even more strongly themselves. &quot; All of this necromancy is moving , but it may ultimately do disservice to Brazil ' s latest champion-turned-legend . In most societies , anthropologist Claude Levi-Strauss once wrote , the living strike a pact with the dead . They pay homage to the deceased in certain predictable rituals , say a wake or a funeral , and in turn the dead agree to stay where they are and not to cause the rest of us grief or nightmare . In other societies , we living will not let_go . Rather , we &quot; conscript the dead , &quot; to appropriate their powers , sometimes by eating them , or else more symbolically , in politer societies &quot; where the people must continually summon the dead to their rescue. &quot; In Brazil , as always , things are not so simple . It is as if they want to have Senna rest in peace and eat him too . His coffin was lowered in the Morumbi Cemetery last Thursday , and the nation said a heart-rending goodby . But Senna ' s mission -- as hero , example and healer -- had just begun .</TEXT>
