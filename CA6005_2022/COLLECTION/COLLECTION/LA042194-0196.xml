   <HEADLINE> COACH RELENTS AND LIFTS HIS BAN ON SEX FOR SWISS WORLD CUP TEAM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Coach Roy Hodgson has relaxed a ban on sex during this summer ' s World Cup soccer tournament after a strong protest from Switzerland ' s players and their partners . Wives now will be allowed to visit the players twice during the monthlong tournament , including after Switzerland ' s June 18 match against the United States . Hodgson , an affable Englishman , has become a national hero since coaching Switzerland to its first World Cup appearance in 28 years .
