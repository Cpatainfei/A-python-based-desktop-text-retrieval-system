   <HEADLINE> KIA VOLUNTARILY RECALLS HALF OF ITS U.S. IMPORTS ; MANUFACTURING : KOREAN AUTO_MAKER IS REPLACING DEFECTIVE SENSORS IN 6 # 945 CARS SIX MONTHS AFTER DEBUT IN THIS COUNTRY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Less than six months after beginning sales in the United States , Kia Motors America has announced a voluntary recall of more_than half of the 13 # 000 cars it has imported from Korea to replace sensors that control speedometers and cruise_controls . Only about half of the 6 # 945 cars subject_to the recall have actually been sold to private buyers , the company indicated . The others are still are_on dealers ' lots or waiting to be shipped to dealers . Industry_analysts say the recall isn ' t likely to hurt Irvine-based Kia -- which advertises its vehicles , which start at $ 8 # 995 , as &quot; well-built &quot; cars for everyone . &quot; Recalls don ' t have the negative connotations they used to have &quot; when most repairs were forced on reluctant auto_makers by federal regulators , said Christopher Cedargren , an analyst with AutoPacific Group in Santa Ana . &quot; Most recalls these days are voluntary , and they tell people that the car_companies care about quality. &quot; Luxury auto lines such_as Lexus and Infiniti , as well as General Motors Corp. ' s Saturn -- the domestic leader in recent quality surveys -- have had a number of voluntary recalls . &quot; If anything , they have helped the images of those companies , &quot; Cedargren said . Kia owner Jeannine Sainz bought her turquoise Sephia at an El Cajon dealership in April . She has not yet been notified of the recall , she said , but isn ' t concerned about it . &quot; You hear about them all_the time now , they ' re no big deal . At least they show that the company is keeping_an_eye_on things , &quot; Sainz said . The 22-year-old San Diego bank teller said she is very happy with her car and has had no problems . Kia Motors America , the importer and distributor of Korean-made Kia automobiles , said that the cars subject_to its recall were equipped with an electronic speed sensor that has developed an &quot; unacceptable &quot; malfunction rate . The problems have been identified over time in the Sephias that have been used by rental fleets since last fall . Kia began a &quot; rolling &quot; retail introduction of its cars in Washington in February . The first dealerships in Southern California did not open until May . Only 3 # 600 of the 13 # 000 Sephia compact sedans now in the United States have been sold by dealers , said Kia spokesman Geno Effler . An additional 2 # 000 cars are owned by rental car fleets and the remaining vehicles are at showrooms or in storage . The cars all were made between Nov . 5 , 1993 , and March 30 , 1994 . Of the total , 1 # 555 are Sephia GS models with cruise_control .</TEXT>
