   <HEADLINE> COLD AND WET WEATHER ON THE WAY AS STORM SWEEPS IN FROM NORTHWEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County may be in_for a preview of winter weather for the next few days , with rain and much cooler temperatures . &quot; It looks_like a fairly cold storm system coming_in , &quot; said Curtis Brack , a meteorologist with WeatherData , which provides forecasts for The Times . Brack said the rain , which was expected to start early this morning , could linger into midday Friday , dumping more_than an inch of precipitation on the county . The showers , the product of a trough of low_pressure from the Pacific Northwest following on the heels of a cold_front from Central California , should be fairly steady through this afternoon , tapering_off to intermittent showers , Brack said . In coastal areas , anywhere from one-quarter inch to an inch of rain may fall , with more accumulation in the mountains and canyons , he said . High_temperatures today should remain in the lower and middle 60s , with nighttime lows in the mid-40s to lower 50s . Friday could be even cooler , Brack said , with highs in the upper 50s and low 60s .</TEXT>
