   <TEXT> Unfortunately , Ron Galperin ' s article , &quot; Filing for Bankruptcy Won ' t Always Save Your House &quot; ( April 12 ) , will result in more individuals filing bankruptcy cases for themselves and unnecessarily losing their properties . Although Mr. Galperin ' s article begins strongly by warning consumers not to believe the inflated claims of advertisers , and even quotes the assistant U . S . trustee , the article sadly concludes by suggesting that individuals can save money by doing their own paperwork or &quot; perhaps hiring a paralegal service instead of a law firm. &quot; The point that should have been stressed is that for anyone who has assets , representing yourself in a bankruptcy case is likely to prove the old adage &quot; he who represents himself has a fool for a client. &quot; A bankruptcy case is not a simple process and , especially for an individual with assets , pre-bankruptcy planning is essential to ensure the best result . Further , only an attorney should give such advice . The Office of the United States Trustee has made a strong effort recently to rid the bankruptcy system of unscrupulous paralegal services that are practicing law without a license . Mr. Galperin ' s article directs individuals to exactly the wrong source for competent legal advice . &quot; You get what you pay_for &quot; can often mean the difference between saving one ' s home from foreclosure and losing those assets . Especially for individuals who own real_property , a professional should be consulted prior to filing a bankruptcy case . HOWARD M . EHRENBERG Attorney at law , Toluca Lake</TEXT>
