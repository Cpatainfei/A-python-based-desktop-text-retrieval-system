   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; COMPROMISE WAS CLINTON ' S BEST OPTION ; DIPLOMACY : PRESIDENT ACCEPTS LOWERING U.S. GOALS TO AVOID UNPOPULAR WAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton faced two unpalatable alternatives in his showdown with Haiti ' s military rulers Sunday : launch an unpopular war that he wanted desperately to avoid , or accept a potentially messy compromise with men he has denounced as tyrants and thugs . As he has before in his career , Clinton chose compromise . His pragmatic choice spared 20 # 000 U.S. troops the risk of fighting their way into Haiti , and spared the President the burden of explaining a war that almost no one wanted . &quot; This agreement . . . minimizes the risks for American forces , &quot; Clinton emphasized , bowing to the nation ' s post-Cold War resistance to military hazards . But , like most compromises , it came_with risks of its own : the risk that the deal will break_down , that Haiti ' s wily generals will use the next four weeks to find a way to stay , or that U.S. troops will find themselves patrolling battle zones in an underground guerrilla war . Clinton and his aides want Haiti to be another Grenada , where the 1983 landing of U.S. troops produced calm within days . But they fear it could be another Somalia , where U.S. troops sought to bring peace but instead became targets . That is why there were no broad smiles of triumph among the President and his advisers Sunday night . Instead , officials seemed relieved but wary -- relieved that they were not sending young Americans into battle but worried about the tricky steps to come . They were nervous , too , about how the deal would look , asking reporters whether it would look_like a waffle for the President -- who last week told the Haitians , &quot; Your time is up &quot; -- to grant them , on Sunday , four more weeks of grace . In effect , Clinton and his aides are counting_on the American public ' s welcoming any solution that avoids war while appearing to meet the United States ' main policy objectives . At the same time , they have quietly redefined those goals downward -- dropping their earlier insistence that the recalcitrant Haitian military_leader , Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , should move &quot; as far away ( from Haiti ) as possible. &quot; Now Cedras , who wants to stay in Haiti and run_for president in 1995 , can at least test the idea , even if it proves impractical , as U.S. officials predict . Indeed , the U.S. forces that begin landing on the island today will depend explicitly on Cedras ' cooperation for their success . One of the first tasks of the commander of the U.S. expeditionary force , Lt . Gen . Henry Hugh Shelton , will be an official call_on Cedras . In recent weeks , as the showdown neared , U.S. officials focused increasingly on making_sure that the American troops ' entry is orderly , not chaotic . And that , officials say , meant working with the generals to bring_about an orderly transition . &quot; The goals of our Haiti policy were to achieve democracy and restore President Aristide , &quot; Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said , adding , perhaps prematurely , &quot; We achieved the goals of our policy. &quot; But , as Christopher acknowledged , there are several steps yet to go before Haiti sees either democracy or Aristide , who will remain in exile in Washington until Cedras steps_down . The U.S. forces must land . The Haitian armed forces must quietly submit to their tutelage . The paramilitary thugs who have terrorized the poor of Port-au-Prince , the Haitian_capital , and other towns must melt away . The fractious Haitian Parliament must pass an amnesty for Cedras and his chief_of_staff , Brig . Gen . Philippe Biamby , and Cedras and Biamby must keep their promise to step_down by Oct . 15 . The relationship between U.S. forces and Haitian authorities during the four-week transition could prove nettlesome . The agreement negotiated by former President Jimmy_Carter states only , &quot; The military activities of the U.S. Military_Mission will be coordinated with the Haitian military high command. &quot; Defense_Secretary William J . Perry acknowledged some of the potential problems . &quot; The risk of paramilitary or guerrilla activity has always been there , &quot; he said . &quot; We believe that risk is minimized by the agreement of the leaders of the Haitian military to cooperate. &quot; &quot; Our entry plans are not based on trust , &quot; he added . &quot; Our protection will be our arms. &quot; But Perry also noted that U.S. troops will not actually police the streets of Port-au-Prince ; that job will remain in the hands of Cedras ' forces . &quot; As long as the de_facto government is still in_charge , they will be in_charge of the police , &quot; he said . That arrangement could well put U.S. forces in the odd position of exercising suzerainty over a country in which the remnants of a dictatorship still have enough guns -- and enough leeway -- to continue murdering their opponents and dumping bodies in the street . Administration officials insisted Sunday that the leaders of the Haitian junta had accepted that their time is over , and were willing to cooperate fully in exchange for the exit with dignity that Carter ' s agreement offered . But in any case , they put such concerns firmly in second place -- after the primary objective of avoiding an ugly little war . &quot; The best news of the day is that we ' re going to do this in a permissive environment , &quot; Christopher said , &quot; . . . less risk to American lives , less risk to our troops than would be achieved otherwise. &quot;</TEXT>
