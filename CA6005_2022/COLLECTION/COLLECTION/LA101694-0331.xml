   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; MIDEAST VIOLENCE LEAVES PEACE QUEST AT CROSSROADS ; TERROR : ISRAELIS , IN SHOCK , WONDER IF IT ' S SAFE TO PROCEED . PLO FEARS A CRACKDOWN ON RADICALS COULD TRIP CIVIL WAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With two devastating attacks in the heart of Israel last week , Islamic militants have thrown into serious doubt the course of Middle_East peace negotiations , forcing Israel and its Arab partners into a hard reassessment . Israelis -- horrified by the abduction and killing of a young soldier and by the murderous attack earlier on a popular cafe district in Jerusalem -- are asking themselves whether it is safe to proceed if this is the result of the tentative peace with the Palestinians . Even supporters of peace with the Palestinians find it difficult to argue that the pace should be faster , not slower , to deny the radicals time and space to strike again . The Palestine Liberation Organization , held accountable by Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin for the terrorist upsurge by the Islamists , is confronted with a need to crack_down on the radicals -- but not at the cost of a civil conflict that could quickly engulf all_of the Palestinian territories . PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat , who has carefully encouraged the moderation of Hamas , the largest Islamic group , now sees it pulled_back toward radicalism . Neighboring Arab states , notably Syria , must worry about a sharp diminution in Israel ' s will to make_peace , about an understandable preference among many here for the security they have known through the strength of arms . What price must the Arabs then pay to engage and reassure Israel ? And the Islamic militants themselves , while exulting in the success of their two latest attacks , must consider whether to attempt to frustrate the peacemaking process totally , as they have wanted , and risk being crushed by Israel and the PLO , or to settle for a place within a future Palestinian government . &quot; We are very much in danger of losing our bearings through events like those of the past week , &quot; said Ziad abu Zayyad , a PLO activist in Jerusalem . &quot; Emotions take_over . Worst-case scenarios somehow become real . When they kidnaped that soldier , they tried to kidnap the peace process and hold it hostage . Let us hope peace did not die when he was killed . . . . &quot; All of us -- Palestinians , Israelis , Syrians , Jordanians , Lebanese -- are at the mercy of the radicals , those who are willing to offer their lives and to take the lives of others to make_up for their lack of popular support , &quot; he added . &quot; This is no less true of Israelis than it is of Palestinians . None of us has escaped_from the extremists. &quot; Although two bus_station bombings by Hamas in the spring and a massacre by an Israeli settler at a West_Bank mosque caused many_more Israeli and Palestinian casualties , the two attacks last week by the Islamic Resistance Movement , as Hamas is formally known , dramatized for both Israelis and Palestinians the dangers they face in pursuing peaceful coexistence . &quot; Upon reflection , I doubt that our people will want to reverse course , &quot; a senior Israeli official said Saturday , &quot; nor even to slow the process . But we all want reassurance because , frankly , we are nervous because of what has happened. &quot; Last Sunday evening , Hamas gunmen attacked Jerusalem ' s popular cafe district , opening fire with automatic_rifles and hurling grenades . Two people were fatally wounded before police and soldiers killed the attackers . The same evening , other Hamas guerrillas abducted Cpl . Nachshon Waxman , 19 , near Tel Aviv and demanded that Israeli authorities release 200 prisoners from radical Palestinian groups and meet other demands in return for his freedom . On Friday , Waxman , three of his captors and an Israeli commando died in an abortive rescue attempt in an Arab village just outside Jerusalem . &quot; They have hit us hard and they have hurt us badly , &quot; another Israeli official said . &quot; Any attack , particularly any death , resonates through the whole country . That these attacks occurred when and where they did , and despite all_of our security , just deepens the sorrow and the anger. &quot; This is what has put the joint Israeli and Palestinian search for peace at a crossroads : Each side expected much more of the other_than it has delivered , possibly more_than it can deliver ; each consequently faces the hard decision of whether , how and at what pace to proceed . For the Israelis , the goal of peacemaking has been to enhance long-term security ; for the Palestinians , self-rule and the hope of independence . The aims of both now appear to be further away . As Rabin and other Israeli leaders made clear this weekend , they expected that the PLO would deal with Palestinian radicals -- the main threat to the peace process -- as part of the agreement on self-government . That Hamas ' latest attacks occurred inside Israel did not matter , Rabin argued , for the radicals ' headquarters was in the Gaza Strip , which the PLO controls . So certain was Rabin that Waxman had been taken_to &quot; a Hamas dungeon in Gaza &quot; that he held Arafat &quot; personally responsible &quot; for the soldier ' s fate , closed the Gaza Strip and applied further pressure through the United States and Egypt . When Waxman was found in the Israeli-occupied West_Bank , less than two miles from his parents ' home_in northern Jerusalem , Rabin still asserted that Hamas was a Palestinian responsibility , declaring that the operation had been ordered and planned in the Gaza Strip . But Arafat ' s initial moves against Hamas -- massive police sweeps of the Gaza Strip , the roundup of more_than 300 Hamas members and on Saturday an order to disarm its military wing -- brought threats from the group to &quot; set Gaza ablaze &quot; with protests against the PLO and the Palestinian Authority . At the same time , the Palestinian Authority has won few gains in the continuing negotiations with Israel -- little to show its many critics that the year-old accord on self-government was worth the compromises involved . Palestinian officials quickly tick_off the outstanding issues : the release of almost 5 # 000 prisoners still held by Israel , national elections envisioned in the agreement on self-government , redeployment of Israeli forces_out of West_Bank towns and villages , expansion of the Palestinian Authority in the West_Bank . &quot; The peace process is based essentially on trust , and that trust has been lost to_the_point where each side expects the worst of all_the others , &quot; said Dr. Ahmed Tibi , a Jerusalem physician who advises Arafat on relations with Israel and who attempted to mediate the kidnaping crisis last week . &quot; An effort will have to be made to get beyond all this and to rebuild that trust. &quot; The first moves , Palestinian officials said , should be the lifting of the closure of the Gaza Strip that Rabin imposed after Waxman ' s abduction and immediate resumption of negotiations on Palestinian elections . &quot; The negotiations should not be used as a weapon whenever an incident occurs -- it will jeopardize the relations between both sides , &quot; Palestinian Information Minister Yasser Abed-Rabbo said in Gaza City . &quot; It ' s important to regain the momentum we lost in the past weeks , to get_down the road. &quot; Rabin , while acknowledging that his harsh demands upon Arafat were &quot; not valid &quot; because Waxman was not in Gaza , said it is &quot; not so simple &quot; to return to the negotiations . Israel , he implied , would want to reach an understanding with the PLO on control of Hamas . &quot; Gaza has become a fertile ground for the activities of Hamas , not only within the Gaza Strip but beyond , &quot; Rabin said , demanding that the Palestinian Authority succeed where the Israeli occupation failed . Arafat , he added , &quot; cannot have peace with Israel and peace with Hamas. &quot;</TEXT>
