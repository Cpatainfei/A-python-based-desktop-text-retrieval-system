   <TEXT> After Cameroon ' s extraordinarily entertaining and successful adventure at the 1990 World Cup in Italy , where it became the first African team to advance to the quarterfinals , the Indomitable Lions went_through four coaches in the next three years . That should have served as a warning to Coach No . 5 . But Henri Michel decided to find_out for himself if the environment was as toxic as had been reported for a coach in the economically and politically unstable West_African nation . No , he soon discovered . It was worse . When he arrived for his first training session in April , there was no bottled water for the players . Although that might be considered a luxury for the U.S. players ensconced in Mission Viejo , it is not in Cameroon , where tap_water is undrinkable . If that had been Michel ' s low point as Cameroon ' s coach , then perhaps the 48-year-old Frenchman would not feel as if he has aged three decades in the last three months . Instead , reaching_into his own wallet to pay_for mineral_water and other necessities has been the least of his problems , because he and his team have had to overcome infighting among national soccer federation officials , governmental interference and a dearth of resources -- especially money . Here is a brief summary of one day in Michel ' s life : In late April , Cameroon was scheduled to play against Zambia , the first match since qualifying for the 1994 World Cup . Because the 80 # 000-seat stadium in the capital city , Yaounde , has deteriorated to the extent that the international soccer federation , FIFA , condemned it , the game was supposed to be played in Douala . The stadium there is in no better condition , but it has not undergone a FIFA inspection . Moments before Michel and the team were to board a bus for the three-hour drive to Douala , however , they were informed that the game had been canceled . Zambia decided not to play after receiving mixed messages from Cameroon ' s multi-headed federation about the details of the contract for the game . So Michel decided that the team would remain in Yaounde for an evening practice that would be open_to the public . But , upon arriving_at the stadium at the appointed hour , he could find no one available to turn_on the lights . He could not have called ahead to ask soccer officials to make someone available because the federation ' s phones had been cut_off because of unpaid bills . Indomitable Lions ? Try Impossible . Although this might seem like an unusual approach to the soccer business for Michel , who coached France to the gold medal in the 1984 Olympics and to third place in the 1986 World Cup , it is business as usual for most of Cameroon ' s players . Their most persistent complaint is that the federation is invariably behind in fulfilling its commitments to pay them salaries and bonuses and compensate them for expenses , which was their same complaint before the 1990 World Cup . When their captain , goalkeeper Joseph-Antoine Bell , took their case to the federation shortly before the team left for Italy , he was ordered to the bench for the entire tournament . The conflict apparently did not negatively impact the play of his teammates . Nor did the fact that they were playing for a Russian coach who spoke neither of Cameroon ' s official languages , French and English . The Lions stunned defending champion Argentina , 1-0 , in the tournament opener and advanced through Colombia , 2-1 , in the second round before falling , 3-2 , in a quarterfinal loss to England that was the tournament ' s most engaging game . They were such a positive force in the tournament that FIFA , hoping there were more teams back home like them , increased African representation in the World Cup from two countries to three . &quot; We Cameroonians are not incredibly talented , &quot; former national team defender Ayakan Yombi told the New York Times . &quot; Our force is our strength and our faith . We can have all_the problems in the world , but every time we put_on the colors and play , we know that , if it goes well , the whole country will be happy . That pushes us to go_to the wall , beyond our limits. &quot; It is the Lions ' capacity to lift the country ' s spirit that has caused controversial President Paul Biya to adopt them . The lion even became the symbol of his 1992 candidacy . When political opponents called_for a general strike on the one-year anniversary of his election , he responded by calling_for a national_holiday to celebrate the previous day ' s victory over Zimbabwe that clinched Cameroon ' s third_World Cup berth since 1982 . The strike never materialized . When Michel goes_to federation officials to seek money , they often respond by sending him to the government . On May 31 , Biya announced that he had contributed $ 185 # 000 . Because Michel accepts Biya ' s money , he also must accept his counsel . That is why Roger Milla , 42 , will become the oldest_man to play in the World Cup . Milla left the field in 1991 to become a federation official , but he decided to come_out of retirement earlier this year in hopes that he would be selected for the team . Michel really had no choice . But , in Biya ' s defense , it must be pointed_out that he also insisted that Milla , who already was known as &quot; The Old Lion , &quot; be selected for the team in 1990 . All he did was score four goals in the World Cup . If the team has no success this year under Michel , perhaps Biya can coach . Perhaps he is the only one who would take the job .</TEXT>
