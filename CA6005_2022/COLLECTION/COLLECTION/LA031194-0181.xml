   <HEADLINE> CLINTON CALLS_ON YOUTHS TO HELP CURB VIOLENCE ; CRIME : HE PROMOTES HIS NATIONAL SERVICE_PROGRAM AT BROOKLYN COLLEGE . HE URGES POLITICIANS TO LOWER THEIR OWN LEVEL OF HOSTILITIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton urged young people Thursday to join in neighborhood efforts to reduce violence -- and pointedly called_on his neighbors in Washington ' s political precincts to tone_down their own level of hostilities . In a speech pitching his Americorps national service plan to students at Brooklyn College , Clinton likened the social impact of Washington ' s political combat to that created by &quot; the cumulative , instantaneous , reactive , macho violence you see in media entertainment programs. &quot; &quot; When people turn_on television and they see their national government , what do you inevitably see ? &quot; Clinton said . &quot; People with words , using extreme words to characterize conduct or activity or positions . The other politicians do_it , the media do_it ; always trying to twist it like taffy to the nth degree. &quot; The President included his own behavior in his criticism , adding : &quot; I think all_of us in positions of public responsibility need to think_about that , need to think_about what kind of message we are sending to young people when they see that kind of conduct. &quot; Clinton never mentioned the ongoing controversy over his financial dealings in the Whitewater real_estate partnership in Arkansas . But the flap has turned the last several weeks into some of the most bruising of his presidency . Although a federal prosecutor already is investigating allegations that Clinton may have benefited improperly from his investment in the Whitewater Development Corp . and his relationship with the former owner of a failed savings and loan , Republicans have intensified their efforts to force congressional hearings on the_matter . &quot; I don ' t know how many people -- I ' ve had older members of the Congress tell me just in the last week how much meaner and partisan and negative the national arena is , &quot; Clinton said . Throughout the speech , Clinton wove together three of his favorite themes -- crime reduction , national service and spiritual renewal -- in a call_for Americans to help &quot; reclaim our streets , our schools , our communities and our lives. &quot; Evoking the memory of Kitty Genovese -- a young_woman murdered 30 years ago in the neighboring New York borough of Queens while dozens of neighbors ignored her cries_for help -- Clinton portrayed his national service plan as a way for Americans to both combat crime and rebuild lapsed bonds of community . &quot; It is not enough for any of us to ever say again what was said here 30 years ago : ' I don ' t want to get involved , ' &quot; he said . The President ' s national service_program , which allows young people to earn college scholarship money by working in neighborhood organizations , will begin this summer . In a so-called &quot; summer of safety , &quot; Americorps intends to place about 6 # 000 volunteers in anti-crime initiatives , ranging from support positions in police_departments to youth counseling programs . The full program , which will begin this fall , is expected to place as_many as 20 # 000 volunteers in an array of service groups . Later in the day , Clinton toured a Brooklyn police_precinct and met privately with Rudolph W . Giuliani , New York ' s Republican mayor . Giuliani had refused to attend the Brooklyn College forum .</TEXT>
