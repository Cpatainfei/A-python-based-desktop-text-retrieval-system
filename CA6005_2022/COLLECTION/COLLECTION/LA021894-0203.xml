   <HEADLINE> O.C. RIDES_OUT HEAVY RAINS WITH RELATIVE EASE ; WEATHER : MINOR FLOODING MOVES THROUGH LAGUNA AREA , ALTHOUGH BARREN HILLSIDES HOLD . WIND RIPS AWAY PART OF COSTA MESA HOME ' S ROOF .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The rains came and the winds blew -- snarling commuter_traffic , setting_off mudslides and unleashing a boulder that slammed into a woman ' s car -- but the damage from Thursday ' s storm was less than had been feared . Most of Orange County easily rode_out the storm that dumped two inches of rain in several locations , although there was some snarled freeway traffic and minor wind damage , including a gust that lifted the roof off a Costa Mesa home . But by early afternoon the storm had swept_through the county and given_way to sunshine and patchy clouds . Fire-ravaged Laguna Beach once again escaped serious mudslides , despite 1.05 inches of rainfall that saturated the hillsides from midnight to 4 p.m. The rain closed Laguna Canyon Road briefly and caused a momentary flash_flood on Canyon Acres Drive , said Patrick Brennan , a Laguna Beach Fire_Department spokesman . &quot; Once again , we were lucky , &quot; Brennan said . Westminster , Huntington Beach and upper Silverado Canyon received the most county rainfall , reporting 1.73 , 1.69 and 1.61 inches respectively . Pacific Coast Highway , between Golden West Street and Warner Avenue , was closed most of the day because of flooding , finally opening at 4 p.m. Other rainfall totals included 1.18 inches in Costa Mesa , . 91 of an inch in Brea , . 87 in Corona del Mar , . 83 in San Juan Capistrano , . 79 in El Toro and . 67 of an inch in Garden Grove , according to the county ' s Environmental Management Agency . In Costa Mesa , the sudden gust of wind about 10:30 a.m. peeled_off a huge chunk of roofing_material from a four-bedroom bluff-top home on Gleneagles Terrace . The home ' s owner , Gale Bouk , said he was watching the Olympics on television when the wind gust struck his home , sounding &quot; just like a bomb. &quot; The Newport Beach Fire_Department arrived about five minutes later and nailed plastic over the home to protect its interior from the rainfall . Unlike last week , when mud from hillsides -- which were laid bare in last fall ' s devastating fires -- surged through homes_in Malibu and buried streets in Altadena , the barriers built of sandbags , plywood , bales of straw and sheets of plastic did their job this time . More_than an inch of wind-driven rain hammered the fragile slopes above Malibu early Thursday morning , but most of the runoff was manageable . By late morning , the rain had begun to slacken , the sun was beginning to peek through and residents who had fled were returning to their homes . The grounds of Cal State Northridge -- furrowed during the earthquake and then churned to dust by heavy equipment during reconstruction work -- were reduced to a muddy bog by the drenching rains that struck before daybreak . Students slogged gamely through the muck to the trailers serving as temporary classrooms . Flooded intersections and vehicles skidding out of control on slippery pavement turned the morning commute into a tangle of stalled cars and short_tempers . Police said a 23-year-old Woodland Hills man was killed when his car skidded on a curve on Topanga Canyon Road and slammed head-on into another vehicle . His identity was not immediately released . Clogged drains backed_up water 2 feet deep on La Cienega Boulevard in Baldwin Hills , and the California Highway Patrol said at 8:45 a.m. that traffic on most Los Angeles-area freeways was moving at a crawl -- if at all . Rockslides closed a number of streets . On Malibu Canyon Road , a rock the size of a stove plummeted onto the top of a small car driven by Michelle Faircloth , 21 , collapsing the roof to the top of the steering_wheel and fracturing her right collarbone . Faircloth , who was pulled from the wreckage by a friend who happened to be driving by , was treated at Westlake Hospital and released . She said she was_on her way to work_at Pepperdine University about 7:30 a.m. when the accident occurred . Heavy snow fell_in the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountains above 6 # 000 feet on Thursday , to the delight of skiers and the dismay of Caltrans crews attempting to keep mountain roads open . Officials said about a foot of new snow accumulated at higher elevations . In Malibu , where Pacific Coast Highway was blocked and 25 homes below the charred hillsides were invaded by mud last week , residents were_better prepared Thursday , their houses protected with sturdy , makeshift barriers that diverted the cascading muck into runoff channels . Caltrans crews used skip-loaders to scoop water and mud from a pond that grew but never overflowed above PCH at the base of Big Rock Drive . Some of the homeowners stood_watch during the morning for the torrent that never came . Barry McManus , wearing a plastic trash bag for a raincoat , waited in front of his four-unit apartment_building damaged by mud Feb . 7 . &quot; we ' ll stop it this time , &quot; McManus said . &quot; We ' re doing more sandbagging and we ' re going to keep the flow moving with a fire hose. &quot; Kent Knudsen , armed with a broom , watched and waited in front of the house on PCH that he had barricaded with a wall of sandbags three feet high . &quot; We got hit pretty hard last time , &quot; Knudsen said before ducking out_of_sight to avoid a television cameraman heading his way . &quot; I ' m tired_of being filmed in pestilence , &quot; said Knudsen , who was shown being carried to safety on a skip-loader during last week ' s floods . By 10 a.m. the rain tapered_off and the sun began peeking through the clouds . At Cal State Northridge , the combination of heavy rain and a patchwork of temporary and outdoor classrooms proved chaotic , yet manageable . &quot; Everybody is trying to be patient , &quot; said senior Janet Toma , 22 , as she waited inside to find_out if a sociology class that had been meeting outside would be canceled . Across the campus , the dirt around the trailers had become giant pools of mud , which proved too_much for a_few . &quot; How am I supposed to get_to class ? &quot; asked senior Dolores Evans , 27 , surveying the mire that separated her from her engineering class . But most of the students decided to make the best of it . &quot; After an earthquake destroys literally your campus , who cares about a_few inches of rain and a little mud ? &quot; said Michael Lee , a 19-year-old freshman . Forecasters said the forecast today called_for partly cloudy skies with a chance of showers through tonight and a renewed chance of showers late Sunday and early Monday . By 5 p.m. Thursday , 0.77 of an inch of rain had fallen at the Los Angeles Civic Center , raising the season ' s total there to 4.14 inches , less than half the normal total for Feb . 17 of 9.71 inches . The rainfall season is measured from July 1 through June 30 . Times staff writers John Chandler and Len Hall and correspondent Willson Cummer contributed to this story . Rain Returns Nearly an inch and a half of rain fell_in Orange County Thursday , increasing the season total to within an inch of the normal level . Thursday ' s rain , from midnight to 4 p.m. : City : Inches Santa Ana : 1.49 Irvine : 1.16 Anaheim : 1.20 Newport Beach : 1.20 Lake Forest : 1.07 Dana Point : . 50 Laguna Beach : 1.05 * YEAR-TO-DATE RAIN Santa Ana readings , as of 4 p.m. Thursday , for rain season beginning July 1 .
