   <HEADLINE> BODY WATCH ; OLD_AGE ELIXIR ; MORE THEN EVER , DOCTORS -- BOLSTERED BY NEW STUDIES -- SAY HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY IS THE BEST WAY FOR POST-MENOPAUSAL WOMEN TO PREVENT OSTEOPOROSIS AND HEART_DISEASE . SO WHY AREN ' T WOMEN BUYING IT ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dr. Michael Kleerekoper thinks hormone replace therapy is terrific for post-menopausal women -- a view widely shared by his colleagues in orthopedics , gynecology , cardiology and internal_medicine . But it is not , he notes wryly , a position widely shared by U.S. women . The good doctor was reminded of that last spring when he and several other experts faced 1 # 000 well-informed Los Angeles women for a $ 75-a-plate luncheon at the Beverly Hilton called &quot; Women and Doctors. &quot; Repeatedly , the physicians touted the value of taking hormone replacement therapy -- estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progestin -- beginning at menopause . Then a questioner wanted to know if taking calcium supplements was a good way to prevent osteoporosis . &quot; It ' s not nearly as_good_as estrogen , &quot; said Kleerekoper , bluntly . A groan rose from the audience . &quot; Everything is estrogen , estrogen , estrogen ! &quot; one woman complained loudly . Unbowed , Kleerekoper , a Wayne State University doctor , leaned closer to his microphone and boomed his bottom_line : &quot; There is nothing , globally , that takes_care of the problems ( associated with menopause ) like estrogen does. &quot; Is hormone replacement therapy the great elixir of old_age for women ? More_than ever , doctors -- backed by a groundswell of new evidence -- say yes . Several prestigious medical groups , including the American College of Physicians and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , have released position papers saying post-menopausal women should seriously consider preventive hormone therapy for its benefits in reducing osteoporosis and heart_disease -- the two major scourges of old_age in women . The balance of evidence has tipped so far that a group of oncologists writing in the Aug . 17 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Assn . called_for studies on hormone therapy in breast_cancer survivors -- long considered prohibitive because of a possible association between estrogen and breast_cancer risk . But in a steely display of consumer independence and -- possibly -- distrust in medicine , many American women are still saying no to hormone therapy . &quot; There is no free lunch , &quot; UCLA breast_cancer surgeon Dr. Susan Love told the Women and Doctors group . &quot; You ' re not going_to be able to take something and not pay the price. &quot; * &quot; There is an enormous amount of resistance , &quot; says Janine O ' Leary Cobb , the director of a Champlain , N.Y.-based consumer group for post-menopausal women called A Friend Indeed . Various surveys estimate that 15 % to 25 % of the nation ' s 40 million menopausal or post-menopausal women are_on hormones . &quot; In the last two years , &quot; Cobb says , &quot; physicians around the country have come_to recognize that many women have dug_in their heels about this . Doctors are wondering what they can do differently to get women to take it. &quot; To be sure , hormone therapy is not a benign treatment . Users commonly experience such annoying side_effects as irregular menstrual bleeding , breast tenderness , bloating and headaches , although doctors say dose adjustments can often alleviate these problems . Hormone therapy is not safe for women with certain conditions , such_as liver and gallbladder disease . Finally , there is still a question of whether hormones promote breast_cancer . This rare instance in which consumers have , en masse , spurned scientifically based medical advice perplexes health officials who are increasingly sensitive to the dual goals of promoting women ' s health objectives and encouraging cost-saving preventive care . &quot; When you consider that American women live considerably longer than they used to . . . more_than one-third of their lives post-menopausally , that heart_disease is the leading cause of death , and that one in five or six of them will fracture a hip from osteoporosis and 25 % of them will never walk again , that is really important stuff , &quot; says Dr. Diana Dell , a Duke University professor and president of the American Medical Women ' s Assn . Women are thought to be naturally protected from heart_disease by hormones produced by the ovaries until menopause . After menopause , however , heart_disease skyrockets , surpassing even that of men . Heart_disease is the leading cause of death in older_women with a half a_million U.S. deaths a year -- more_than twice as_many as all cancer deaths combined . But in a major study -- Postmenopausal Estrogen / Progestin Interventions ( PEPI ) -- researchers last month announced that hormones clearly improve a number of key risk factors for heart_disease . Osteoporosis prevention has been another big winner with studies showing that hormones can lower the risk of hip fracture -- the most disastrous consequence of osteoporosis -- by 60 % . So overwhelming is hormone therapy for osteoporosis prevention that the Food and Drug Administration now allows manufacturers to market it for that purpose . &quot; Estrogen therapy is almost like women immunizing themselves for two of the most prevalent diseases that can affect menopausal women : heart_disease and osteoporosis , &quot; says Dr. Morris Notelovitz , president of the National Menopause Foundation in Gainesville , Fla . &quot; When we look_back in time_to_come , the intelligent use of hormone therapy will be one of the greatest boons ever to women ' s health. &quot; According to other research , hormones also look promising for preventing Alzheimer ' s disease and cataracts , and improving mood , skin tone , hair texture and sexual functioning . And , according to an English study , women on hormones sleep deeper and think better when awake . &quot; ( The therapy ) can have a tremendous effect on the quality and quantity of a woman ' s life , &quot; Notelovitz says . So if the benefits so clearly outweigh the risks , why aren ' t more women taking hormones ? * The negative column bears one of the primary reasons women hesitate to sign_up for hormone therapy : It may increase the risk of breast_cancer . While a_few long observational studies found that estrogen users had a 20 % to 30 % higher risk of breast_cancers , similar studies found no risk ; the issue is far from settled . The association between hormone therapy and uterine cancer is much better understood . The PEPI study and others have demonstrated that estrogen therapy causes tissue growth in the uterus that can lead to cancer . But when estrogen is combined with the hormone progestin -- the most popular regimen used today -- the increased risk of uterine cancer is eliminated . Still , when women hear estrogen , they often think cancer , doctors say . &quot; The risk of breast_cancer is minute compared to the benefits they get from prevention of heart_disease and osteoporosis . But the bottom_line is the word cancer , &quot; Notelovitz says . &quot; And that is unfortunate . Estrogen does not cause breast_cancer . It may promote breast cancer. &quot; But it will take time to undo the myths and misconceptions of the past , says Dr. Lila Nachtigall , a New York University professor and author of a consumer book on menopause . She blames some of her colleagues for dissuading patients from taking hormones in the ' 70s and ' 80s -- even though many of those same doctors today are writing prescriptions by the fistfuls . &quot; Cardiologists and internists have done the biggest turnaround . Ten years ago , I would put a woman on estrogen and the internist would take her off . They would n ' t even call , they would just take her off . Now , they call me and say ' She just had a heart_attack . She needs estrogen , ' &quot; Nachtigall says . Doctors have tended to emphasize the traditional use of hormone therapy -- as a short-term drug to alleviate hot_flashes , vaginal dryness and night sweats . As such , too few women understand that hormones are a much weightier tool when used for long-term prevention of disease , Dell says . In a recent survey of 1 # 000 women by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories , the makers of the hormone product Premarin , only 5 % of women identified heart_disease and osteoporosis as long-term post-menopausal risks . &quot; We have too often improperly characterized hormone therapy in a way that infantilizes women ; that once their hot_flashes go_away , they won ' t need hormones , &quot; she says . &quot; If women got clear-cut messages instead , many will begin and continue therapy . But a lot of this has to do with the amount_of_time a doctor spends with a patient in discussing whether or not to take hormones. &quot; Cobb , of the consumer group A Friend Indeed , agrees that doctors take too_little time to educate women . &quot; It takes a lot of time and care to prescribe hormones . What doctors should do is delegate this task ; turn it over to nurse-practitioners who can take more time , &quot; she says . She also blames doctors for not helping women adjust to hormones in a more sensitive manner . In the 1991 meeting of the North_American Menopause Society in Montreal , Cobb hung a poster in an exhibition_hall displaying letters from women complaining of how their doctors handled their hormone therapy . &quot; I had a lot of doctors hanging_around my board , &quot; she says wryly . The marketplace is packed with numerous hormone formulations including pills , skin patches and vaginal creams ; products to prevent osteoporosis and others for various menopausal symptoms . Finding the right product for an individual woman can involve time and experimentation . But , Cobb says , two-thirds of women who start hormone therapy quit within a year because of bothersome side_effects -- far too short a time to gain any disease-prevention benefits . &quot; I don ' t think any of us are very good at prevention , &quot; Dell says . &quot; All of us live for today and don ' t live for what will happen in the future . You only have to look_at the number of American women who smoke to see how true that is. &quot; Moreover , Dell says she often sees patients who believe that since menopause is nature ' s way , she must live with nature ' s consequences rather than take hormones . &quot; But that same patient will think nothing of taking anti-hypertensive drugs to prevent stroke , &quot; Dell notes . &quot; I don ' t see the difference . Hormones are a medicine used for prevention purposes just like other medicines are. &quot; Notelovitz says he likes to remind his patients that they do have a choice if they want to try to live_out their final third of life in vigorous health but don ' t want to take hormones . Osteoporosis can often be prevented in mid-life with hefty calcium supplements and regular weight-bearing exercise . Heart_disease can be prevented with a regimen consisting_of a low-fat_diet , no smoking , exercise , stress reduction , antioxidant supplements and low-dose aspirin . &quot; We have to give women an option : Do you want to take hormone therapy or do you feel more comfortable with diet , exercise , antioxidants and aspirin ? The problem with the later is compliance . Once you stop , you lose the protective effect , &quot; he says .
