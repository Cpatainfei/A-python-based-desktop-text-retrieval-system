   <HEADLINE> PROPOSITION 187 AND THE LAW OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES ; ANTI-IMMIGRANT INITIATIVE WOULD DENY MEDICAL_CARE , ROIL SCHOOLS AND MAKE SNOOPS OUT OF TEACHERS ; IS THIS WHAT CALIFORNIA WANTS ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Illegal immigration to America is obviously a significant problem , especially in California . But how Californians react to it can either produce thoughtful policy that can be a model for the nation or a half-baked approach that could actually have dangerous consequences . What will it be ? THE CONTEXT : The issue of illegal immigration has reached a fever pitch here for three reasons . One is simply that the number of illegal immigrants is large . The second is that the gubernatorial campaign has dwelt on the issue . And the third is the looming presence of statewide ballot Proposition 187 , to be voted on Nov . 8 . We strongly recommend a &quot; no &quot; vote . This measure proposes to prohibit state and local_governments from providing education , health_care or other social_services to illegal immigrants . Proponents claim that state and local_governments ' services and benefits aggravate the problem by enticing many people into entering the country illegally and that social tensions resulting from immigration will only worsen unless California does a dramatic about-face . Proposition 187 supporters admit that some of the measures are Draconian -- for instance , state and local agencies would be required to report &quot; apparent illegal aliens &quot; to immigration authorities . But they argue that more moderate , intermediate measures -- minor congressional reforms and local patch jobs -- are not enough . Proposition 187 has a parallel to Proposition 13 , the controversial 1978 statewide ballot measure limiting property taxation , in that it is one of those thunderbolt , send- ' em-a-message ballot measures . But , also like Proposition 13 , it would surely produce many unintended bad results . Proposition 187 ' s understandable appeal is based on the assumption that we have to do something about illegal immigration . We certainly do . And this proposition would certainly Do Something . But what it would do is not something California should want to happen . DECIMATE THIS STATE ' S LOW-WAGE LABOR_POOL ? Is illegal immigration only a negative force ? Of course not . What about the economic benefits that accrue from all recent immigrants , even those who are here illegally , such_as low-wage but highly productive labor ? Think_of all_the work -- from home repair_to garment manufacturing -- that keeps marginal businesses profitable and allows new small firms to open . Think what the world-famous California economy would be like without the many thousands of tiny businesses and service_firms that depend_on low-cost labor . Guess who ' s picking the crops for the California agribusiness that is the envy of the world ? Remember : There are powerful economic factors at_work here . Reputable experts disagree over how many new immigrants this state can absorb without severe consequence and over whether they are a net plus or a negative for the economy . But the experts are virtually unanimous on what draws most immigrants here : The lure is jobs , however ill-paid , not welfare . The United States and Mexico should work_out a sensible arrangement that recognizes the reality of this powerful job magnet and minimizes the exploitation of these workers while also discouraging illegal resettlement in the United States . DENY PEOPLE BASIC MEDICAL_CARE ? To refuse to provide fundamental health_care is downright dangerous to the public interest . If Proposition 187 passes , and is upheld in the courts , people here illegally would be denied basic health_care even if their medical problems were serious , even if they had communicable_diseases , even if a low-cost dose of preventive_medicine could nip a potentially costly problem in the bud . A major and vital goal of public health_care is to keep the problems of even the sickest and most destitute individuals from becoming a danger to the rest of the population . Say an illegal immigrant with an infectious_disease like tuberculosis is turned_away from a public clinic . Health_professionals worry that he is less likely to return to his homeland than to become a potential health threat to those he comes_in contact with in this country . Is the public interest better served by treating the disease or turning the carrier away ? THROW KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL ? Though based on a longer-term definition of the public good , the argument for educating the children of illegal immigrants is similar . First , studies have shown that even children born abroad who are raised here by immigrant parents are more likely to remain in the United States than go_home , even if their parents eventually return to their countries_of_origin . So it is in the public interest to make_sure they become well-educated and acculturated to American life . At least then they will be likely to be productive members of society as adults . It ' s no wonder so many law-enforcement officials are vigorously campaigning against Proposition 187 . By tossing kids out of school it ' s virtually an unintended but effective gang-recruitment tool . TURN TEACHERS INTO SPIES ? The immigrant education issue is extremely complicated . Many , perhaps most , of the children born to illegal immigrants are born in the United States and thus are U.S. citizens entitled to a public education . Yet Proposition 187 would literally force a school district to question young Americans about their parents ' immigration status and report to authorities any parents suspected of being here illegally . that ' s the Immigration and Naturalization Service ' s job , not the schools ' job . Imagine requiring a teacher to quiz a pupil about whether her parents are illegal -- what an ugly outrage . Teachers are stressed out enough without having this added_to their list of duties . The &quot; Big Brother &quot; aspects of this approach to immigration law_enforcement are obvious . Less obvious are the unintended consequences such_as illegal immigrants pulling their children out of public_schools in huge numbers . State education officials estimate that school enrollment could drop_by 300 # 000 if every illegal-immigrant parent did so , and that could cost California up_to $ 2.8 billion in federal education aid . Some shortfall would have to be made_up by state taxpayers because the exodus would n ' t yield $ 2.8 billion in savings . SEND A MESSAGE THAT IS COUNTERPRODUCTIVE ? Another fundamental flaw of Proposition 187 is the facile assumption that a single state can actually do something about an international phenomenon like the migration of people from countries as close as Mexico or as far away as China . That assumption is legally tenuous , for the courts have traditionally held that immigration is a federal , not state , responsibility . On that basis alone , any sections of Proposition 187 that contradict federal laws or procedures may wind_up being nullified by the courts . Despite that possibility , some supporters of 187 urge a vote for the initiative to &quot; send a message &quot; to a federal_government that has ignored its responsibility to deal with the immigration issue . But while there may once have been value in sending even a very crude message such_as 187 , Washington is certainly not ignoring the immigration issue these days . Under pressure from California Democrats like Sen . Dianne Feinstein and Republicans like Gov . Pete Wilson , both Congress and the Clinton_Administration have been made acutely aware that illegal immigration is a major issue in California and other states with large immigrant populations . And President Clinton has made regaining control of the nation ' s borders a priority for the Justice_Department , designating money in the recently passed federal crime bill for hiring 1 # 000 new Border_Patrol agents and reimbursing California and other states for the cost of imprisoning illegal immigrants who commit crimes . And a recent study commissioned by White_House chief_of_staff Leon E . Panetta , himself a Californian , verified that California pays far more in educating and helping immigrants than it gets_back in federal immigration aid . That will provide ample ammunition in pressing Congress for more immigration-related funds . RISK LOSING FEDERAL AID ? Perhaps no single argument against Proposition 187 makes its proponents so uneasy as what their initiative could wind_up costing California taxpayers . According to the state legislative analyst , lost federal aid to schools , public hospitals and clinics could add_up to $ 15 billion . How can Proposition 187 proponents sell it as a tax-saving initiative in the tradition of Proposition 13 ? They really can ' t , and when pressed_on 187 ' s costs , the initiative ' s authors change strategy and confess that they don ' t really expect 187 to go_into effect right away , even if it wins . They then acknowledge their real goal : pushing the state into what is sure to be a long , costly lawsuit against the federal_government -- a suit that the state could well lose . The legal question here centers_on the Supreme Court ' s Plyler vs . Doe decision of 1982 , which held that immigrant children are entitled to public education . In effect , Proposition 187 ' s authors would gamble with your tax money in the hope of winning a dubious legal fight they should pay_for on_their_own . So while Proposition 187 purports to offer a simple answer to a complex phenomenon , it really is no answer at all . If state voters enact this measure they will not only not end illegal immigration , they will drag California into bitter lawsuits and political battles that could hurt the state far more_than illegal immigration does . One need only ponder the divisive campaign waged over 187 , with its overtones of hostility against Latinos , Asians and other state residents who look or sound like &quot; apparent illegal aliens , &quot; to get a sense of how difficult ethnic relations could become in the aftermath of the initiative ' s approval . In an era when California businesses increasingly look_to Asia and Latin_America for new markets , this state doesn ' t need such ethnic division . Vote &quot; no &quot; on Proposition 187 .</TEXT>
