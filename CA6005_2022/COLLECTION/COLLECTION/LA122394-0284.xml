   <HEADLINE> NOTEBOOK ; IRVINE ' S IMAGE IS SUFFERING BUT NOT GARDEN GROVE ' S</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> New respect : The financial crisis has gone_a_long_way to change the images of some Orange County cities . Irvine -- long considered a model municipality with safe streets and outstanding schools -- now faces huge losses because of its investments in the county pool . The Irvine Unified School District is also suffering from the crisis . Conceded one top Irvine official this week : &quot; People are wondering if Irvine is still No . 1. &quot; None of that soul-searching exists in Garden Grove , one of the few cities that did not invest in the pool . Now , the city is getting new-found respect . &quot; I ' m not going_to make any Garden Grove jokes for a long , long_time , &quot; said Fullerton Councilman Chris Norby . * Slow-news days : City and school district officials say that one of the most difficult parts of the financial crisis is the lack of solid information about the latest developments in the bankruptcy . Lee Risner , La Habra ' s city_manager , has a case_in_point . On Wednesday at 2:20 p.m. , he received a faxed news release from Supervisor Roger R . Stanton ' s office . The release , written by a public relations firm , was dated Dec . 16 -- five days earlier . &quot; And that ' s fax , &quot; he mused . &quot; Let ' s not talk_about the inefficiencies of the U.S. Postal Service . They probably could have done_it faster by Pony_Express ! &quot; Added Risner : &quot; The press_releases we ' re receiving from ( the county ' s ) public relations firm usually contain data that we read in the newspapers one to three days before. &quot; * Pleasing procrastination : People who dumped their tax payments in the mail at the last minute have become heroes to some cash-strapped city officials . that ' s because all property_tax payments received by the county before the Dec . 6 bankruptcy filing were frozen in the pool and won ' t be distributed to cities . The tax deadline was Dec . 12 . &quot; I ' m sure all_the people in Tustin were prudent and didn ' t pay until &quot; the last minute , quipped Tustin Councilman Michael J . Doyle . * Parks feel the pinch : As a cost-savings measure forced by the bond crisis , most county regional park facilities will be closed the next two Mondays for the Christmas and New Year ' s holidays . User permits and group reservations have been canceled for those two dates . Organizations hosting day-camp activities , sporting events or other activities should contact park offices about rescheduling . Both of the county ' s camping parks , Ronald W . Caspers and O ' Neill regional parks , will remain open Dec . 26 and Jan . 2 . Additional information is available from county parks officials at ( 714 ) 834-6667 or ( 714 ) 771-6731 . * They ' ll be back : In Sacramento , state Auditor General Kurt R . Sjoberg announced Thursday that a preliminary report on the Orange County situation -- expected to be released today -- will be delayed until after the holidays . Sjoberg said his team of five auditors , who met in Sacramento on Thursday after two weeks in Orange County surveying the fiscal landscape , determined there were &quot; too many loose_ends &quot; left to be tied_up before a report could be produced . The team is expected to return to Orange County after New Year ' s Day and produce a report by the second week in January , Sjoberg said . The analysis will provide a &quot; second opinion or some comfort &quot; on cash flow and other issues as the county liquidates its failed investment portfolio , he said . Sjoberg added that he doesn ' t feel the delay will hold_up the county ' s efforts as it attempts to recover from the investment crisis . &quot; I don ' t think that their own numbers are yet complete , &quot; he said . &quot; Obviously if that ' s not complete , they ' re not going_to be able to go forward. &quot; * Bowing_out : San Clemente City Treasurer Kenneth E . Carr sent_out a news release Thursday announcing he would not seek reelection when his term expires in November , 1996 . But he said the decision had nothing to do with the county financial crisis or San Clemente ' s $ 34-million investment in the troubled pool . Carr said he made the decision shortly before the county ' s $ 2-billion losses were announced this month . &quot; While recognizing and accepting my responsibilities for city participation in the . . . ( pool ) , I plan to devote my immediate energies and experiences to ensure that the financial interests of all San Clemente residents are enhanced in the future. &quot; * Take my treasurer , please : Waving his latest canceled property_tax check made_out to former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron , Laguna Niguel City Councilman Eddie Rose half-jokingly told the council this week : &quot; We used to call Citron ' Sweet Old Bob. ' Now we just use the initials. &quot; The remark brought some wry smiles to the faces of council_members and city staff , but no one laughed aloud .</TEXT>
