   <HEADLINE> HEBRON KILLER ACTED ALONE , PANEL DECIDES ; MIDEAST : ISRAELI COMMISSION CRITICIZES LAX SECURITY IN DEATHS OF MUSLIMS SHOT BY JEWISH SETTLER IN A MOSQUE . PALESTINIANS DENOUNCE REPORT FOR NOT ASSESSING INDIVIDUAL BLAME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Israeli commission investigating the massacre of at least 29 Palestinians in a mosque in the occupied West_Bank four months ago concluded Sunday that a Jewish settler had acted alone in carrying_out the &quot; base and murderous act. &quot; The commission , headed by Supreme Court President Meir Shamgar , strongly criticized the lax discipline among the Israeli soldiers and police_officers assigned to guard the Cave of the Patriarchs in Hebron and their confused orders as contributing to the Feb . 25 blood bath . But the five-member commission refused to extend that criticism to Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , who also serves as defense minister , or to any of his senior commanders , and it did not attempt to assess the broader issue of attacks by radical Israeli settlers on West_Bank Palestinians . &quot; We do not believe that anyone can be blamed for not having foreseen the fact that a Jew would plan and carry_out a massacre of Muslims in the Cave of the Patriarchs , &quot; the report said . The commission found that Dr. Baruch Goldstein , the Brooklyn-born gunman , might have been stopped had the full guard detail shown_up at the tomb on the morning of the massacre . Five of 10 guards were absent , including three who overslept . Goldstein , a physician from the nearby settlement of Kiryat Arba , a hotbed of radical settlers for two decades , walked into the tomb dressed in his army reserve uniform and opened_fire with a Glilon assault_rifle behind rows of kneeling worshipers . He was bludgeoned to death by worshipers . &quot; The evidence presented to us indicates that he acted alone , &quot; the commission said , dismissing as confused and unproven Palestinian charges of a conspiracy and testimony from both Muslim worshipers and Israeli guards that suggested another settler might have been involved . &quot; We were not presented with credible proof that he was helped , while carrying_out the killing or prior to that time , by another individual acting as an accomplice , nor was it proven to us that he had secret partners , &quot; the commission added . The report said 29 Palestinians were killed and 125 wounded . Independent checks with hospitals and family members after the massacre indicated that 30 -- and perhaps several more -- had died . But there was confusion over names from the beginning , and some victims were taken from the mosque to the cemetery . After hearing 106 witnesses and reviewing the physical evidence , the Shamgar commission essentially accepted the argument of Lt . Gen . Ehud Barak , the army chief_of_staff , who testified that the massacre &quot; hit us like lightning from a clear blue sky. &quot; In its 338-page report , the commission said the army could not have predicted an attack by a Jewish extremist on Palestinians because intelligence reports focused_on possible violence by Muslim militants against Jewish settlers . Rabin , who had reluctantly agreed to demands from liberals in his Cabinet for the commission , accepted its findings and pledged to carry_out its recommendations for improved security at the Hebron shrine , which is sacred to both Jews and Muslims as the burial place of the Patriarch Abraham . Palestinians , however , rejected the report for failing to assign responsibility , moral if not legal , within the Israeli political and military Establishment for the crime . &quot; The report was not enough because it concentrated_on general faults in the Israeli army ( and ) about protection of the Muslim prayers at the mosque , &quot; Hebron Mayor Mustafa Natshe said . &quot; It does not ( place ) responsibility on individuals responsible_for these faults , and it does not speak about the climate of threats and violence that allowed ( the gunman ) to kill. &quot; Palestinians had hoped that the inquiry report would focus_on the need to remove the 450 Jewish settlers living downtown among Hebron ' s 80 # 000 Arabs in_order to preserve peace . Saeb Erekat , minister for local_government in the new Palestinian Authority , commented : &quot; The Israeli government and its policy of ( Jewish ) settlement are completely responsible_for this ugly crime . &quot; The Israelis must understand that their settlements and settlers are a time_bomb that could explode in our face at any moment , &quot; Erekat said . &quot; that ' s why we want to put this issue on the negotiating table now. &quot; Amnon Rubinstein , the Israeli education minister and one of the country ' s most respected law professors , praised the commission for the work it had done , but expressed regret that it had not gone much further . &quot; What was not examined was the overall situation , the impossible situation of placing a primed explosive_charge inside a barrel of gunpowder , &quot; he said , referring to the militant Jewish settlers in and around Hebron , one of the largest Palestinian cities . &quot; What happened is the result of a whole Israeli policy , &quot; Rubinstein said . &quot; Its policy created that situation and led to great risks , and those risks are not about to disappear. &quot; Yossi Sarid , Israel ' s environment minister , who had pressed for the special commission , acknowledged : &quot; The commission doesn ' t cut_off any heads , but it does require that action be taken_to examine the operational and disciplinary lapses and to take all_the necessary steps. &quot; Under the commission ' s recommendations , adopted Sunday evening at a special Cabinet meeting , Jews will be barred from carrying weapons into the shrine , and Jewish and Muslim worshipers will be strictly separated to prevent friction . A special unit will be established to guard the shrine when it reopens , and special security equipment is being installed . But Rabin said there are no guarantees that security_forces could stop another massacre by a &quot; Jewish madman who decides to open_fire in one of a_thousand mosques where prayers are held_in the West Bank. &quot; &quot; We have to fight the terrorist activities of those who kill Jews , and at_the_same_time we have to enforce the law on those radical Israelis , those extremist settlers , &quot; Rabin commented . The commission cited lapses by Israeli police and troops in enforcing the law among Jewish settlers on the West_Bank , including police refusal to investigate vigilante attacks by settlers unless a Palestinian victim filed a complaint . Most Palestinians are intimidated by the heavily armed settlers or believe that their complaint will lead to nothing . The panel also urged the army to clarify its orders on when troops may open_fire to specify that soldiers may stop settlers from committing serious crimes . Soldiers had testified that even if they had seen Goldstein shooting , their orders barred them from firing at other Jews . After the massacre , Israel detained the leadership of the anti-Arab Kach movement without trial and seized the arms of a_few Jewish settlers . Goldstein was a longtime Kach activist . Settler leaders praised the report for determining that Goldstein acted alone but criticized the recommendation that Jews no longer be allowed to enter the tomb armed , saying they need to carry weapons for self-defense . &quot; We will never accept any more limitations with_regard_to our prayers , &quot; said Rabbi Eliezer Waldman , who heads a Jewish studies school in Kiryat Arba . &quot; Jews should not be punished because of what has happened. &quot; Hebron today is a tense city , ready to explode in new violence . A cordon remains around the Cave of the Patriarchs , which has been closed indefinitely pending new security arrangements . The center of the city is a maze of checkpoints . At intersections where Jews and Arabs might meet , Israeli paratroopers keep their weapons poised , ready to shoot .</TEXT>
