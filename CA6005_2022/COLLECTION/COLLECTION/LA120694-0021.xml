   <HEADLINE> SERB ADVANCE ON BIHAC</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Do I understand correctly that the Serb armies are being allowed to overrun Bihac , the other U.N. &quot; safe areas &quot; and eventually all_of Bosnia ? Do I understand correctly that this murderous aggression will be allowed because the Europeans don ' t want to get &quot; involved &quot; ? Is this the same Europe that gave us the Kaiser ' s and Hitler ' s Germany ? Is this the same Europe that gave us communism and the Cold_War ? Is this the Europe that gave us colonial wars of independence all_over the globe , including our own ? When &quot; Greater Serbia &quot; eventually invades her neighbors , when Serbia aims nuclear_warheads at Paris , London and Berlin , will these same reticent Europeans once again beat a path to our door ? Will the United States , as a member in good standing of NATO and the U.N. , be called_upon to defeat the &quot; monster &quot; ? It is time for the U.S. to either take action , unilaterally , against the Serbs , or to withdraw completely and permanently from the U.N. and NATO . JANE KNOX Capistrano Beach * Send peacekeepers into troubled regions , then claim that no further actions can be taken_to remedy the situation because the peacekeepers will get hurt . Logic which only hurts in places like Bosnia , Somalia and all future international efforts . ARAM ORDUBEGIAN Glendale * The custodians of the U.N. Security_Council have timidly surrendered to the might of the militant Serbs , first by cutting arms to Muslims to defend their lives and then allowing Serbs to do everything to punish , torture and rape hopeless and hungry Bosnian Muslims . The European and American leaders like House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Lee Hamilton must be congratulated for their great human_rights achievement . We should give gold medals to the great Michael Rose , U.N. commander in Bosnia , Yasushi Akashi and Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and all permanent members of the Security_Council for ending the war in Bosnia by doing everything to allow butchering of more_than 300 # 000 Muslims of Bosnia . What a new_world order ! Millions of Christians enjoy holidays while Muslims in Bosnia mourn for their loss of children , husbands , wives , mothers and fathers . It is time for 1.8 billion Muslims of this world to wake_up and first stand_up to their own corrupt and powerless leadership in their own nations , and thereafter unite together to raise their voice against their unknown enemies who not only control the U.N. Security_Council but the economy and the civilization of this world . ASGHAR FAROOKHI Ontario * Clearly the time has come_to re-evaluate the NATO organization , its usefulness , and the need to reorganize in light of its powerlessness in the Bosnian war crisis . Its ineptness , indecision and dependency upon the U.S. to resolve every crisis can no longer be tolerated . GARY TRAXLER Oxnard * We , the West , have lost the first phase of World_War III -- the struggle against all types of terrorist governments in the world . Today we lost Bosnia , tomorrow it will be Croatia , Slovenia , Macedonia , Albania and , with the resurgence of communist leaders in Eastern Europe , the entire East-European bloc will revert to its creed . Soon will follow the reconquest by Russia of the former territories of the Soviet_Union . We must stop the aggressors while we still have time and power . This stop must be made not in terms of &quot; principles &quot; ( which we don ' t have or at least are not defending ) , but for very concrete reasons : One day it will be our turn . We must risk and take preemptive actions and history will be_on our side . ANTHONY M . MLIKOTIN Los Angeles * After tuning_in on the morning news regarding the Serbs ' move to take_over Bihac , I opened the morning issue of your paper to the front page of more of the same ( Nov . 28 ) . On to page A17 and Bob Dole ' s comment that we should &quot; get the United Nations Protection Force_out of there . . . and let the Bosnians defend themselves. &quot; What a cop-out ! I am appalled at his suggestion ! I cannot believe that we are going_to , once again , let the Serbs massacre yet another group of innocent people . How many towns and cities of Yugoslavia are going_to have to fall before we intervene ? Of course , if Yugoslavia was oil-rich our troops would be there in a heartbeat ! The TV picture of the faces of those men , women and children of the town of Bihac waiting like lambs for the slaughter will forever remain imprinted in my mind and heart , as will the verbal plea from their spokesperson to a world of deaf people . I am only thankful that my father , as a first-generation Yugoslavian who was the best American citizen I will ever know , is not alive to witness the disgraceful apathy and &quot; buck passing &quot; of our politicians in the cruel and inhuman destruction of his beautiful homeland .
