   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS : SADDLEBACK / SOUTH BEACH ; LAGUNA BEACH ; WATER DISTRICTS FOCUS_ON CREEK POLLUTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Putting aside their differences , seven of South County ' s largest water districts Tuesday joined an informal task_force to help keep Aliso Creek clean . The districts and county environmental and health officials were invited by Orange County Supervisor Thomas F . Riley and state Sen . Marian Bergeson ( R-Newport Beach ) to discuss solutions to the pollution problem that has caused popular Aliso Beach to be closed frequently over the decades . Recently , conflicts have erupted among water districts that belong_to the Aliso Water Management Agency , a powerful umbrella agency for the seven water districts serving more than200 # 000 south Orange County residents . &quot; Despite all_the controversy and conflict over all these years , &quot; Bergeson said , &quot; it ' s very heartening that they ' re not tossing bricks at each other but sitting_down and talking_over their differences. &quot; The 12-mile creek , which starts near Cook ' s Corner in Trabuco Canyon and meanders southwest to Aliso Beach , has carried an increasing number of harmful sewage spills and urban runoff that reach the sea and force beach closures . &quot; This is an ongoing , long-term problem , &quot; said Laguna Beach Mayor Ann Christoph , who attended Tuesday ' s meeting , &quot; that has gotten incrementally more troublesome. &quot; &quot; The fact that all these water districts and county officials are here is an indication there is a crisis , &quot; she said . The most recent spill occurred June 20 , when 16 # 000 gallons of partially treated sewage dumped into the creek reached the ocean and caused county health officials to bar public use of the beach for three days . In 1994 , the beach has been closed for 16 days because of creek pollution . Christian M . Smith , a co-founder of Surfrider Foundation ' s Laguna Beach chapter , had insisted on a formal task_force for Aliso Creek , saying that water-borne illnesses are plaguing swimmers and surfers . He also took_exception with the county ' s method for counting illnesses , which showed no illnesses were reported by swimmers in a 2 1 / 2-year period from January , 1992 , to September , 1994 .
