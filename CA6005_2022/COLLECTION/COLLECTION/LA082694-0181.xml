   <HEADLINE> PARENTING ; GEARING_UP ; MOST TEEN-AGERS ARE EAGER TO DRIVE , BUT PARENTS ARE CAUGHT BETWEEN WELCOMING THE HELP AND WORRYING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Danielle Minsky , 16 , of Northridge couldn ' t wait to get her driver ' s license -- it was her ticket to freedom . Her mother , Michele , on the other hand , saw it as an indefinite sentence to a life of stress . When children start to drive , she says , &quot; parents lose a lot of peace_of_mind . Before , you knew exactly where they were . Now , you have more to worry about. &quot; Nevertheless , most parents want their 16-year-olds to be able to drive , according to Tom Richards , who has been teaching driver ' s education on and off since 1969 at Birmingham High_School in Van Nuys . Among other benefits , having another driver in the house relieves mom and dad from being a slave to a teen-ager ' s schedule . It also gives teen-agers an added measure of responsibility . &quot; I think most parents know their kids and know if they ' re responsible enough to drive , &quot; said Jean McCalla of Northridge , who is training her third child , Kevin , 15 , behind the wheel . With each of her children , before lessons began , she assessed their reliability , attention_span and maturity . She said Kevin , who recently got his learner ' s permit , pays_attention , is trustworthy in other areas of his life and is very aware on_the_road , so she is calm now as she lets him drive her on errands . Another mom , who lives_in North Hills but asked that her name not be used , would n ' t let her daughter , now 28 , drive until she was 17 because &quot; she didn ' t seem to know where the dangers were . She thought that everyone else would take_care of things . Just because it ' s a green_light , you can ' t automatically go. &quot; * Whatever a parent ' s timetable may be , a teen-ager approaching driving age is often impatient to hit the road . Eileen Shuster , co-owner of Bob ' s Driving_School in Northridge , joked , &quot; You know he ' s ready when he doesn ' t quit nagging you. &quot; She added : &quot; When most of their friends are driving , when they show an interest in the driving process , pay_attention when you drive and ask why you are doing this or that , &quot; these may be signs that it ' s time to investigate driver ' s ed . Richard S . Ortega , who works full time as an RTD bus_driver and has been teaching at Bob ' s part time for about 12 years , said teen-agers are actually quicker_studies in driving than older adults , who tire faster and have slower reflexes . Because teen-agers are &quot; very motivated , &quot; they take direction well and handle correction better . Adults like to see demonstrations before they get_behind the wheel , he said , but teen-agers &quot; learn by doing it. &quot; But if a student approaches driving &quot; as if it were a game , &quot; Ortega said , he knows they haven ' t realized the full potential -- or danger -- of driving . * Lack of concentration and lack of experience are what make teen-agers &quot; slam into each other , &quot; Richards said . Ortega agrees that behind-the-wheel practice time is vital . &quot; We can teach them the basics in six hours , but they need to drive a little bit each day , &quot; he said . Teen-agers report that the scariest tasks they face as new drivers involve making left-hand turns -- especially across oncoming traffic -- and lane changes . The prospect of navigating through a sea of speeding cars is , in fact , so intimidating to some teen-agers that they resist learning to drive at all . One Granada Hills youth explained that he just didn ' t want the responsibility . &quot; You always hear about accidents , &quot; he said . &quot; And there are some really bad drivers out there. &quot; His mother finally convinced him to take his driving test when he was 16 1 / 2 , and now , a year later , he finally feels comfortable driving . Parents can be most helpful to their children by serving as model drivers , said West Valley CHP traffic Officer Dave King . &quot; Parents must be as responsible as they want their children to be , &quot; which means staying within the speed_limit and obeying all traffic rules , said King , who often lectures to driver ' s education classes . The three biggest dangers of driving , he emphasized , are speeding , speeding and speeding . To set the tone for sensible driving , King advised , parents should tell youngsters &quot; right off the bat that driving is not only a privilege from the state but from the parent. &quot; Rules of the Road Although establishing driving rules for a teen-ager is an individual matter , here are some tips from parents , driving instructors and other experts : * Draw_up a contract that lists driving rules , a teen-ager ' s responsibilities , and the consequences should any rule be broken . Rules might cover common-sense taboos -- no drinking and driving -- as well as guidelines for car_care : keeping it clean , filling the gas_tank , etc . Consequences might include paying_for all traffic fines and any damages incurred during an accident . * Discuss car rules before handing_over the keys . * Have teen-agers post all driving plans and destinations in a prominent place . * Ask them to phone home if plans change and they are going_to be late . * Extend driving privileges in increments , initially limiting trips to school and back or allowing only daytime driving before granting after-dark privileges . * Limit passengers to the number of seat_belts a car has and stipulate that everyone buckles up before the engine starts . * Link driving privileges to school work . If grades drop , confiscate the keys . * Stress road courtesy , warning teen-agers not to get_into altercations with other drivers . * Encourage new drivers to be security conscious , locking car_doors , for example , especially at night . * Discourage them from driving when they are angry , frustrated or crying . * Make_sure their friends know your driving rules . Getting Started In California , minors may get a learner ' s permit at age 15 if they are taking driver ' s education . Indeed , they must have a permit before they get_behind the wheel of an auto . To qualify for a permit , applicants are required to take an eye exam and a written test . This is the same 46-question test on traffic laws and signs that all new drivers must pass with a score of 39 or better . In order to drive with a learner ' s permit , teen-agers must be accompanied by a California-licensed driver age 25 or older . At 16 , provided they have had a permit for at least 30 days , completed driver ' s education and six hours of driver ' s training , and paid a $ 12 application fee , minors may take the driver ' s test . They must repeat the written exam ( if a year has passed since they first took it ) and undergo a road_test , which , in L.A. County , includes freeway driving . To those who pass , the Department of Motor_Vehicles issues a provisional , under-18 license , which can be taken_away more easily than an over-18 license . Sufficient cause for revocation includes a range of offenses , from driving under the influence to habitual school truancy . To get either a learner ' s permit or a driver ' s license , a minor must have the signature of a parent or guardian , who must assume full financial responsibility . Any adult 18 or older may apply independently for a license . Most public and private high_schools still offer driver ' s education ( although funding is constantly in doubt ) . They no longer provide in-the-car driver ' s training , which used to be paid_for out of the state ' s traffic penalty assessment fund . Now , students must take a private driver ' s training course , available through state-licensed schools and costing about $ 120 or more . A free driver ' s handbook may be requested from the DMV by phone . Appointments for all exams , which are given at DMV offices , may also be made by phone .</TEXT>
