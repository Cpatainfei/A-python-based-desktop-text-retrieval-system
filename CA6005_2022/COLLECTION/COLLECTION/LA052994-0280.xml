   <HEADLINE> MOST REWARDS FOR CRIMES GO UNCLAIMED ; INVESTIGATIONS : ABOUT 80 % EXPIRE WITHOUT BEING PAID OUT . DESPITE THE LOW SUCCESS RATE , MOST LAW_ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS STILL BELIEVE THEY PROVIDE A VALUABLE INCENTIVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The brutal slayings of Hee Wan Yoo , his wife and two children in their Granada Hills home more_than two years ago left investigators struggling to solve a crime without suspects , witnesses or motives . Hoping to generate leads , the Los Angeles City_Council offered a $ 25 # 000 reward for information that would help solve the slayings . Although the reward was doubled by Yoo family relatives and renewed last month after it expired , it has remained unclaimed . Concrete leads have yet to come_in . But unclaimed rewards are not unique . About 80 % of the rewards offered by Los Angeles city and county officials over the past two years expired without being claimed , according to city and county records , begging the question : Why don ' t rewards work more often ? Despite the low success rate , most law_enforcement officials still believe_in the concept , saying rewards provide a valuable incentive . &quot; We often have someone who is wavering about whether they want to share their information , and ( rewards ) are just an added incentive , &quot; said Los Angeles Police Lt . Al Moen , head of the department ' s major crimes division . But some police and government officials say privately that rewards are not a reliable crime-fighting tool . Instead , they are seen as a tool of the politicians and a way for the grieving families to feel they are helping to solve the crime . &quot; Many times it means something to the family , &quot; said one homicide investigator . &quot; They feel more is being done if a reward is being offered. &quot; Rewards have been a staple of the American justice system as far back as the 1800s , when posters pinned to saloon doors offered rewards for the capture of train robbers and cattle rustlers -- dead or alive . Today , most rewards are offered by government_agencies or relatives of the victims for particularly heinous crimes . Television has gotten_into the act with a slew of programs that re-enact crimes and offer rewards for callers with information . Some reward programs , such_as the city of Los Angeles ' graffiti reward program , are highly successful . Since 1991 , the city ' s program has paid_out $ 85 # 500 in rewards to more_than 100 people who have helped capture graffiti vandals . But because such rewards are offered on an ongoing basis , it is difficult to compare their success rate with programs that offer rewards for a particular crime and for a limited time . In the past 24 months , the Los Angeles City_Council paid_out 10 rewards , totaling $ 190 # 000 , according to city records . But during the same period , 63 rewards , totaling $ 1.5 million , expired without being claimed , records show . Rewards offered by the County Board of Supervisors do not fare much better . Five rewards , totaling $ 55 # 000 , have been paid_out in the past two years , while 20 rewards , totaling about $ 206 # 000 , expired without being collected , according to county records . &quot; For the most part , they are never claimed , &quot; said Georgette Dame , a supervisor of the county reward program . Rewards offered by the city usually expire 60 days after they are offered ; county rewards expire after 90 days . But the rewards can be extended or renewed at the request of a county supervisor or City_Council member . Law_enforcement officials say there are many explanations for the low collection rate of such rewards . The main reason , they say , may be that witnesses or other sources of information are afraid of reprisals if they call police . Police say the best sources of information are often accomplices in a crime or friends and family of the criminals -- people who have much to lose by providing police with information . Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Lt . Frank Merriman said rewards often do not work because &quot; you are trying to entice the shady person , the associate of the criminal. &quot; Another reason may be that rewards are often only offered for the crimes that are the most difficult to solve , such_as murders . According to the most recent FBI statistics , the percentage of homicides solved nationwide dropped from 90 % in 1960 to 65 % in 1992 . Gary Auer , head of the FBI ' s office in Ventura County , said no amount of reward will help if no one has information about the crime except for the criminals themselves . &quot; It can be that a crime is committed by one or two people and they have kept their mouths shut , &quot; he said . Most often , Auer said , law-abiding citizens with information do call police , regardless of whether a reward is offered . He said the FBI gets dozens of tips daily on bank robberies , but &quot; not more_than one in 20 asks if there is a reward. &quot; &quot; Generally , we have not seen that rewards have been a significant motivating concern , &quot; he said . Another reason for the low success rate , law_enforcement officials say , is that the news of the rewards may never get_to the people most likely to have information . Often , the people with information on crimes seldom read newspapers or watch television_news to learn about the rewards , said Hubert Williams , president of the Police Foundation , a research and support agency for law_enforcement officials based in Washington . &quot; If you were to go from bar to bar , for example , and passed_around information , you would get better results , &quot; he said . When the Board of Supervisors or the City_Council offers a reward , a small , standardized ad is placed in at least one local newspaper , but usually for only one day . One county official described the ads as &quot; tiny . . . very small. &quot; On occasion , an elected official will issue a news release about a reward or will hold a news_conference to generate more interest . Recent rewards that were successful include $ 10 # 000 given last month by the Board of Supervisors to a teen-age boy who helped authorities identify a woman who set a blaze during the 1992 riots . In January , the supervisors paid_out $ 12 # 500 each to two men who helped police identify the man who shot and killed Deputy_Sheriff Nelson Yamamoto during a gun battle in Walnut Park . And in recent weeks police cracked a 2-year-old murder case of a Woodland Hills high_school student who was attacked by a group of youths as he waited for a bus . A suspect was arrested after he began bragging that he committed the crime and that he had a $ 25 # 000 price on his head . The $ 25 # 000 was a reward posted by the Los Angeles City_Council shortly after the slaying . In April , the Los Angeles City_Council handed_out a $ 25 # 000 reward to a person who provided information that resulted in a successful prosecution in the murder of 7-year-old Kanita Haily , who was gunned_down in a drive-by_shooting while playing baseball in the Imperial Courts housing project in Watts in 1989 . But for the most part , rewards go unclaimed . The list of crimes for which rewards are offered reads like an obituary listing for mothers , fathers , children , police_officers and civic_leaders whose lives ended in violence and mystery . County supervisors voted three times to renew a $ 10 # 000 reward for information on the slaying of Sheriff ' s Sgt . George Arthur , who was shot and killed in 1985 as he left work_at the Men ' s Central Jail . The crime is still unsolved . This month , City Councilman Hal Bernson asked the council to renew a $ 25 # 000 reward for information to help identify the killer of Laurie Myles , who was slain in September , 1993 , as she headed to a Bible study class in Northridge to pick_up her teen-age daughter . Despite extensive publicity and an additional $ 7 # 500 in private contributions to the reward offer , Myles ' killer has yet to be found . The murders of the Yoo family -- Hee Wan Yoo , his wife , Gyung Jin , and their children Pauline , 6 , and Kenneth , 4 -- generated fear and puzzlement in the residential community of Granada Hills . As recently as this month , investigators held a news_conference to urge the public for information to help solve the crime .</TEXT>
