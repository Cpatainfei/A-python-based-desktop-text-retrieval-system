   <HEADLINE> THE MICROSOFT AGREEMENT ; RIVAL FIRMS LOOK TO MAKE GAINS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For Novell Inc. , Lotus Development Corp. , Borland International and many small computer software companies that have complained long and loud about Microsoft Corp. , Saturday ' s announcement of a settlement in the government ' s antitrust_case against the industry leader is at least a moral victory . But the agreement stops far short of the sweeping measures -- such_as outright breakup of the company -- that some people had hoped to see . And it also is unlikely to alter substantially the balance_of_power in the computer_industry -- at least for the moment . Microsoft has agreed to end three of the allegedly monopolistic practices that infuriated its competitors the most . And that was good_enough for Novell , which offers a version of DOS ( disk operating system ) in competition with Microsoft . Novell also makes the Word Perfect word_processing program and popular computer networking software . Microsoft agreed to change its volume licensing of the MS-DOS and Windows operating systems , which had the effect of locking_out competitors . It will also stop requiring other software firms to sign highly restrictive confidentiality agreements . And it will stop using certain long-term licensing contracts . &quot; Clearly , we see this as a victory , &quot; said David Bradford , general counsel for Novell , the chief rival of Microsoft . &quot; This has been a long effort by many companies for many years , and this decision today will provide consumers with increased choices and more innovative products. &quot; In principle , the settlement will benefit consumers by assuring robust competition in the software business , which in turn will assure interesting and high-quality products . Many software companies , even large ones such_as Novell and Lotus , which makes the popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet program , have been struggling to sustain market share_in the face of relentless pressure from Microsoft . And for smaller firms , many of whom are dependent upon one innovative product , Microsoft can be a terrifying specter . Companies such_as Intuit , which makes Quicken personal finance programs , and Broderbund Software , known for its Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego ? educational_program , have watched while Microsoft invested tens of millions of dollars in trying to displace them from their niches . And investors have been reluctant to fund some start-up software companies out of fear that their original ideas could quickly be mimicked by Microsoft , which is rapidly expanding its product_line to include everything from word_processors to games . The settlement , however , will likely do little to inhibit Microsoft ' s competitive posture outside of the operating system area . Consumers could benefit if true competition develops in the market for DOS , the software that controls basic computer functions . The agreement requires Microsoft to change the way it licenses MS-DOS and Windows , thus opening the way for competing products , notably DR-DOS from Novell . That provision could be even more important for the next generation of more high-powered operating systems , where Microsoft ' s dominance is not so clearly established . IBM , with its OS / 2 program , as well as Novell with its Unix_system , and eventually Apple and IBM with Taligent , hope to prevail over Microsoft in that coming battle . &quot; We still have to assess what the implications will be for OS / 2 , but if this opens_up more choices for consumers , we are very pleased , &quot; said IBM spokesman John Iwata .</TEXT>
