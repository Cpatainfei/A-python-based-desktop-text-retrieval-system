   <TEXT> Ezra Taft Benson , the U.S. secretary_of_agriculture under President Dwight D . Eisenhower who put aside his advocacy of ultraconservative politics late in life when he became the president-prophet of the Mormon_Church , died Monday . He was 94 and died at his Salt_Lake_City home . He had been in failing health for some time , had undergone surgery four years ago to relieve a fluid buildup on his brain , and died of congestive_heart_failure . Unable to speak , Benson spent his last years under the 24-hour care of a nurse in his apartment across the street from church headquarters . In contrast to his once outspoken support of the controversial John Birch Society and his ardent anti-communism , Benson ' s messages to the nearly 9 million members of the church during his tenure as church president were spiritual ones . Benson typically endorsed traditional morality and faith in the_Book_of_Mormon , the church ' s principal scriptures , and reasserted long-held Mormon beliefs about the sacred nature of the U.S. Constitution . He was 86 when he was named 13th president of the Mormon_Church , formally known as the Church of Jesus_Christ of Latter-day_Saints , on Nov . 10 , 1985 . As such , he was the second oldest_man ever to be installed in the powerful position , one in which Mormons believe the holder receives revelations from God . He succeeded Spencer W . Kimball , who died at age 90 . Presidents of the Mormon_church serve for life . Benson ' s tenure was not marked by major pronouncements or new directions . He kept a low public profile by declining all interview and news_conference requests , maintaining that church business took first place . Next in seniority on the Council of 12 Apostles and Benson ' s likely successor is onetime Los Angeles lawyer Howard W . Hunter , who would be the first Mormon president born in the 20th Century . He is 86 . When Benson ' s predecessor , Kimball , was installed as Mormon president in late 1973 , it was widely thought that it would not be long before the second in_line , the politically vocal Benson , would accede_to the high_church office . The ailing Kimball had undergone heart_surgery only a year earlier . Some church_members , especially a liberal minority , openly speculated on whether Benson , if he survived Kimball , would use the church presidency for right-wing political ends . Benson encouraged that speculation early in 1974 , saying that it was &quot; entirely possible &quot; that the president of the Mormon_Church might someday endorse political candidates , despite the church ' s carefully nurtured political neutrality in this century . He had lauded the principles of the American_Party , the successor to the American Independent Party , which had nominated Alabama Gov . George Wallace for President in 1968 . Many at that time felt he would be Wallace ' s running mate , but Wallace instead chose retired Gen . Curtis Le May . In 1979 , speaking_to the fall church conference , Benson lamented that America was never so vulnerable to communism as it was then because the government , in his words , had allowed Cuba to become a Soviet military base and had permitted the Marxist takeover in Nicaragua , &quot; the surrender of the Panama_Canal ( and ) the infiltration by enemy agents within our American borders. &quot; But by the time Kimball died in 1985 , Benson was rarely heard on political subjects . Church officials said upon Kimball ' s death that Benson had moderated his political views and that politics was &quot; not really his agenda anymore. &quot; The Mormon_Church experienced steady growth during Benson ' s presidency . Founded in 1830 by Joseph_Smith in Upstate New York , the church underwent vilification and persecution wherever it tried to establish itself in the Midwest , mainly because of polygamy , a practice rescinded in 1890 . By World_War_II , Mormons were beginning to gain grudging respect from Americans for their clean living , hard work and the popular Mormon Tabernacle Choir . Like many Mormons of the first_half of the 20th Century , Benson had his roots in the Far West . Born Aug . 4 , 1899 , in Whitney , Ida. , he was descended from Mormon pioneers who accompanied Brigham Young on the westward trek to Utah in 1847 . The oldest of 11 children , Benson left the family farm in 1919 to study agriculture in college , interrupted his studies for two years of missionary service in England , then graduated from the church-run Brigham Young University in 1926 . That same year he married Flora Amussen -- who died in 1992 -- and left for Iowa State University , where he earned a master ' s degree in 1927 . Benson returned to Idaho where , besides becoming a church leader in Boise , he was a county agricultural_agent and secretary of the Idaho Cooperative Council from 1933 to 1939 . In 1939 he moved to Washington to become executive_secretary of the National Council of Farmers Cooperatives . Called by the church in 1943 to join the high-ranking Council of the 12 Apostles , Benson and his family returned to Utah . He was installed on the council on the same day as Spencer Kimball , but a_few minutes after Kimball -- a difference which placed Benson after Kimball in seniority on the council , and thus behind him for the church presidency . He performed high-level volunteer work with the Boy_Scouts and went_on a post-war mission to Europe to aid the recovery of Mormon_churches there . From 1946 to 1950 he served as director of the Farm Foundation , receiving national exposure with zealous attacks on &quot; paternalistic government &quot; and his calls_for farm groups to endorse the free_enterprise system . In 1952 , President-elect Eisenhower named him to head the Department_of_Agriculture , an appointment interpreted at the time as a concession to the conservative wing of the Republican_Party . Farm problems mounted in the 1950s . Despite a steady decline in farm population , improved technology at ever-larger farms produced crops in excess of the market demand . Previous administrations had bought the farmers ' surplus and sought to bolster farm income with subsidies , or price_supports . Benson , who served during both of Eisenhower ' s terms , believed that the best long-term solution was for the farm economy to return to the free market of supply and demand . But a variety of proposed approaches , including flexible price_supports , met repeated opposition from Congress and many farmers . South_Dakota farmers once pelted Benson with eggs when he spoke in favor of flexibility in farm programs . In his book &quot; Farmers at the Crossroads , &quot; Benson wrote that 21 Midwestern congressmen stormed into his office demanding rigid price_supports for hogs . He refused , and wrote that the price of hogs soon rose on its own . Benson ' s name had surfaced in conservative circles as a possible candidate as early as the 1964 and 1968 presidential elections but his fervent anti-communist rhetoric and close identification with the John Birch Society was thought to limit his appeal_to Republicans in_general . The mini-movements also became of some concern to Mormon leaders who wished the public to see the church as loyally American but politically neutral . In 1963 , David O . McKay , then church president , issued a statement criticizing the John Birch Society for questioning the loyalty of elected officials and for seeking &quot; to align the church or its leadership with ( the society ' s ) partisan views. &quot; Yet , that same year , Benson extolled Birch Society founder Robert Welch &quot; as one of the great patriots in American history &quot; at a testimonial dinner for Welch at the Hollywood Palladium . The church then asked Benson to spend the next two years directing the Mormon mission in Europe -- not an unusual assignment for a church leader , but one widely interpreted at the time as a way to remove him from political controversy . But when it was announced that he had been chosen to lead the church , Benson said only that he intended to continue the church ' s missions &quot; to preach the Gospel , perfect the saints ( faithful Mormons ) and redeem the dead ( a temple ceremony in which deceased ancestors are offered baptism by proxy into the church ) . We shall continue every effort to carry_out this mission , &quot; he added . Benson authored nine books and numerous pamphlets , &quot; all dealing with the topic of freedom as man ' s God-given heritage. &quot; He also was awarded four George_Washington Honor medals by the Freedoms Foundation at Valley Forge , Pa . Benson and his wife had six children , all_of whom survive , as do 34 grandchildren and 55 great-grandchildren .</TEXT>
