   <HEADLINE> BRIGHTER OUTLOOK FOR CALIFORNIA ; SMALLER FIRMS SPELL EXITING AGING GIANTS ; TRANSITION : FOR FIRST TIME EVER , WITH A TOTAL OF 48 , STATE IS HOME TO MORE FORTUNE 500 COMPANIES THAN ANY OTHER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lockheed Corp. ' s plans to shift its corporate headquarters to the East Coast as it blends into a newly merged company may sound like the latest proof that California has lost its luster for major employers . Yet for all_the fears of a corporate exodus , the truth may be surprising : Even as aging corporate citizens like Lockheed trim their ties to the region , a striking number of fast-growing enterprises are thriving . By key measures , from the Fortune 500 ranking of industrial giants -- more are now based in California than anywhere else -- to surveys of swift-growing , adolescent companies , the Golden State jumps_out as a popular home base for business . The community of employers is changing dramatically , however -- a transformation that is cause for hope as well as worry , according to experts . The growing presence of firms in international trade , information and other non-defense technologies bodes well for job creation . But at_the_same_time , the reduced role of established corporate players such_as Security Pacific Bank ( swallowed_up by Bank of America in 1992 ) , aerospace giant Lockheed ( set to merge with Maryland-based Martin Marietta ) and others is taking a toll . The state ' s corporations are becoming more anonymous and less likely to participate in the community as fully as the fading elite of corporate movers and shakers . While some anti-elitists may choose not to mourn their passing , the shift has made_it harder to raise money for charity , cultural programs and other social_activities . &quot; It is not a simple equation , and it doesn ' t have a simple answer , &quot; declares Ray Remy , president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber_of_Commerce . Many different economic forces are at_work -- and the pressures are not unique to California . Mergers and buyouts in the 1980s removed such household names as Crocker Bank , PSA and Western Airlines from the Southern California corporate scene . The savings and loan debacle meant the demise of such established thrifts as Columbia and HomeFed , also large presences in the region . Corporate survivors , meanwhile , often have scaled back their spending and other community involvements , reflecting cost-cutting pressures that have spread throughout private industry in the 1990s . This reality applies to some of the state ' s most familiar corporations . In July , for example , Arco disclosed that it was eliminating the entire staff of its company foundation , a vehicle that had been used to promote education reform , job training and other social objectives . And long before last week ' s announcement , some observers had noticed that Lockheed was edging away from its once active role in community activities as it turned inward amid the aerospace decline . Once upon a time , all you had to do was name the problem , &quot; and Lockheed would be there , &quot; Remy said . * Nor was Lockheed alone . When business_leaders needed to convene for a local matter , &quot; you could call Security Pacific Bank and they would hold the event for you in the corporate dining_room on the top floor . It was wonderful , &quot; said Jack Kyser , chief economist at the Economic Development Corp . of Los Angeles County . &quot; You just don ' t replace a Security Pacific or a Lockheed , &quot; Kyser said . &quot; These are major voids that are going_to take years to fill in. &quot; Despite such laments , many big-name corporations remain in California , and other less-famous ones are joining the club . For the first time ever , California this year was the most popular home for companies in the Fortune 500 , with a total of 48 , compared to Illinois ' s 44 and New York ' s 43 . The Big Apple has its own cause for concern ; this was the first time New York slipped out of its traditional No . 1 ranking . Such established California firms as Chevron , Hewlett-Packard , Arco and Rockwell were_on the list . But there were newer names , as well : Solectron , a circuit_board maker in Milpitas ; SynOptics Communications , a supplier of computer_network equipment in Santa Clara ; Cisco Systems , a computer networking equipment maker in Menlo Park , and 3Com of Santa Clara , also in the networking business . Southern California ' s contingent included Mattel , AST Research , Western Digital and others . A separate list compiled by Forbes , which includes service companies along with industrial firms , dramatizes California ' s ongoing appeal_to business : In 1985 , the Golden State was home to 82 of the nation ' s largest public companies . By last year , that number had risen to 89 ( although the share_in Los Angeles dipped slightly ) . * Most dramatic , however , is California ' s allure for smaller , fast-growing companies . In Inc. magazine ' s annual rankings of the fast-track crowd , California typically lands about 12 companies in the top 100 -- more_than New York , Texas or Florida . In addition , San Diego , San Francisco , Los Angeles and Sacramento are among the nation ' s most popular magnets for fast-growing &quot; gazelle &quot; firms , according to studies by Cognetics , a research group in Cambridge , Mass . Often , however , these smaller , surging enterprises are a very different animal from their older and larger corporate cousins . They may trod a a quiet path , garnering little public recognition ; and typically , they focus their efforts on competitive demands . Little energy is left over for community activities , such_as funding a new museum or back-slapping with the traditional elite . &quot; They don ' t have PR departments . They don ' t have a vice_president in_charge of going_to meetings , &quot; notes Joel Kotkin , a frequent writer on the California economy . &quot; And they don ' t have a guy who sits_down every year to decide , ' How do I spend the $ 3 million I have for charity ? ' &quot; The corporate society that is emerging also may have more fragile community ties than in the past . Jules Tygiel , a California historian and author of a recent book on the 1920s oil boom in Los Angeles , points_out that an indigenous capitalist elite once had powerful roots in Los Angeles , through its interests in real_estate , finance , media and other areas . Their &quot; livelihood and well-being really were tied to the livelihood and well-being of the Los Angeles community , &quot; said Tygiel , a professor at San Francisco State University . * Today , by contrast , he wonders if enterprises in such fields as technology and information -- where the market is global -- feel the same intense links to the local scene . Clearly , some of the emerging magnates of industry are demonstrating a community conscience . Irvine-based AST Research , one of the world ' s largest makers of personal_computers , has donated hundreds of computers to schools in Southern California . On top of that , its executives have made large donations to local colleges -- including $ 1 million to UC Irvine by Chief_Executive Safi Qureshey . Remy hopes that such involvements will become more common as the new corporate titans mature , that &quot; they ' ll become more visible and more ingrained in the corporate community. &quot; The process is far from complete . In the late 1980s , Los Angeles corporations would lend some 4 # 000 individuals to help the United Way raise money , recalls John S . Moawad , senior_vice_president at the United Way of Greater Los Angeles . Today , the number is closer to 2 # 800 . Similarly , a range of economic pressures -- including corporate relocations -- have cost the charity up_to $ 10 million a year since the easier fund-raising days of the late 1980s . In the new corporate world , the United Way has to rely much less heavily on an identifiable corporate elite and plunge into the more anonymous , less-understood world of mid-sized business . &quot; I have to go_out and try to find smaller customers , &quot; Moawad said . &quot; I have to make more calls to get the same gross . We ' ve got_to get_in pace with that -- and we know it. &quot;</TEXT>
