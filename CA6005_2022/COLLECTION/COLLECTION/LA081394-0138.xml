   <HEADLINE> USE OF METROLINK HAS DOUBLED SINCE QUAKE ; COMMUTE : SURVEY FINDS THAT TYPICAL RIDER REMAINS WHITE MALE PROFESSIONAL . WOMEN AND MINORITIES SHOW ONLY SLIGHT GAINS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Southern California ' s commuter_trains carry twice as_many passengers now as before the Northridge earthquake , and the average rider is a well-heeled white male professional from the suburbs , according to results of a survey released Friday . The number of female and minority group riders climbed only slightly , if at all , in the past year , the survey found . Nearly half of the Metrolink system ' s 15 # 500 daily riders began taking the periwinkle-and-white trains after the January quake . Many of those new customers -- one-sixth of the current passengers -- identified quake damage to the freeways as the reason why they now ride Metrolink . Metrolink passengers overall -- the majority of whom receive subsidies from their employers to take the train -- continue to report high satisfaction with the 2-year-old train service , although some complain of high prices , delays and poor connections at their destinations . The survey results , based on a Metrolink poll of 4 # 527 riders in June , show little change in the typical passenger profile from a similar study last year . Despite some official attempts to diversify ridership , the trains still attract affluent white-collar workers , mostly male executives and managers , from households with an average annual income of $ 64 # 450 . More_than half ( 55 % ) receive subsidies from their employers to ride the trains , on average $ 58 a month . The socioeconomic status of Metrolink customers continues to stand_in stark contrast to that of the region ' s bus users , who are overwhelmingly members of ethnic minority groups and from households that earn less than $ 30 # 000 a year . That disparity was brought into the debate recently over the decision to raise bus_fares for the first time in six years , even as Metrolink officials slashed fares for several months as an earthquake-relief measure . Riders gave Metrolink high marks in the survey for service , personal safety and professional courtesy from staff , and say their stress levels are lower because they do not have to drive to work . Three out of five passengers surveyed used to be solo drivers . But 75 % of riders -- even those who live within five miles of their stations -- drive alone to the train_station , which means they &quot; cold start &quot; their cars each workday morning anyway , and cold starts are the single biggest contributor to air_pollution . The survey , which Metrolink officials said has a margin of error of less than 2 % , found : * Nearly half of all passengers began using the system after the January earthquake . About 48 % of these new customers identified the temblor as the reason for turning_to the trains , accounting_for one-sixth of the current total ridership . On the Santa Clarita line alone , three out of every four passengers trace their ridership to the quake . * Fifty-two percent of riders are men , the same proportion as last year . However , 48 % of passengers are women , up from 45 % . ( Three percent of respondents in last year ' s survey did not answer the question. ) * As with last year , whites make_up two-thirds of those who board the trains . The proportion is even higher along some routes , such_as the Ventura line and the recently opened Orange County_line ( 80 % for both ) and the Santa Clarita line ( 74 % ) . * The percentage of African Americans who use Metrolink increased from 7 % last year to 9.4 % this year . Latinos registered a tiny rise , from 13 % to 13.1 % . Asian American ridership dropped from 13 % to 9.1 % . * The average household income of $ 64 # 450 exceeds last year ' s figure by more_than $ 1 # 000 . * Three out of five riders formerly drove alone to work every day . * The average rider is 41 years old . * The most frequent complaint is that schedules are too inflexible or infrequent . Riders also complain of delays , seating problems and cost . * Still , 61 % believe the Metrolink to be a better overall value than their former commute mode . Metrolink officials acknowledge that the high approval rating is to be expected for their survey , since most respondents are people already sold on Metrolink . &quot; You ' re preaching to the choir , that ' s true , &quot; said Ray Shea , Metrolink marketing manager . &quot; They ' re on board because they like it. &quot; But he said his staff would examine ways to attract new riders and to find_out whether trial users in recent promotional programs stayed with the trains . Metrolink will also continue to advertise in Spanish media . Metolink Profile A survey of 4 # 527 Metrolink passengers in June shows that the average rider remains a white male professional with a household income of $ 64 # 450 . However , the number of female passengers has climbed slightly from last year , as has the number of minorities riding the trains . Employers subsidize the trip for 55 % of all riders , offering an average of $ 57.59 monthly .
