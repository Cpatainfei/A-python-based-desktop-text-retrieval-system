   <HEADLINE> SUICIDE OF YOUNG SUPERSTAR WEIGHS ON PORN INDUSTRY ; TRAGEDY : PAMPERED , WILD SHANNON WILSEY , KNOWN AS SAVANNAH , WAS THE THIRD ACTRESS TO TAKE HER LIFE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After crashing her white Corvette and injuring her much-glorified face on the way home from another night of hard partying , Shannon Wilsey sent a friend out_to walk her Rottweiler , Daisy , and then shot herself in the head . For the 23-year-old sex video superstar known as Savannah , it was the most outrageous act in a short but outrage-filled public life . It was also the third major suicide in the adult video industry , whose most valuable and pampered commodity is beautiful but often troubled young_women . A decade ago , Shauna Grant shot herself with a . 22-caliber rifle . Then Megan Leigh shot herself in the mouth after buying her mother a $ 500 # 000 dream house . Now Wilsey , the &quot; adult industry ' s most celebrated star , &quot; according to the monthly Adult Video News , has snuffed_out her life apparently to end romantic and financial problems that only seemed to escalate as her fame and income expanded . Is there a trend here ? Her family thinks so . They gave strict orders to limit the number of Wilsey ' s porn-industry colleagues attending the funeral . Asked whether his daughter ' s problems were worsened by her involvement in the sex industry , Mike Wilsey replied : &quot; Of course . People ask me if pornography is wrong . I say you can judge a tree by its fruit. &quot; The X-rated industry has begun to respond to the implications of the violent_deaths of some of its top stars . Plans are under way to establish a phone help line that performers confronting personal crises can access 24 hours a day . &quot; We recognize the need for this , so it ' s going_to happen in the name of Savannah and Shauna and the others , &quot; said William Margold , a member of the board of directors of the Free Speech Coalition , an industry umbrella group . As to whether pornography helped destroy Wilsey , the people who knew her best since she burst on the scene five years ago as a cool Elke Sommer look-alike , talk_about a young_woman who reveled in her outlaw lifestyle , bragged of dating rock_stars and was seriously troubled before she shot her first X-rated video . At the end of her life , she was depressed , in debt and slept_with a gun under her pillow for protection . If the sex industry contributed to Wilsey ' s demise , they say , it was by turning her into a pampered , highly paid star whose whims were indulged and tantrums endured . In an industry that shoots on a shoestring , she was known for pulling Hollywood-style stunts such_as walking_out in the middle of a production when a rock_star paramour came_to town . If the Hollywood lifestyle is a fantasy , the sex-video business is even more unreal because it gives its female stars celebrity and wealth but , unlike Hollywood , it can never give them approval in the larger society . &quot; I don ' t blame the industry for mistreating her , &quot; said a 26-year-old X-rated star known as Danyel Cheeks . &quot; If anything , they spoiled her rotten . They put us on such a high pedestal . The limos are sent_out . Anything I want is pretty much done for me . Sometimes it makes the real_world hard to deal with. &quot; that ' s especially true because the audience for sex videos is more fickle and has a far shorter attention_span than the mainstream film audience . Most careers are over in a_couple_of years . Then the re-entry into the ordinary world can be bumpy . Like others in her world , Wilsey hoped to make the transition from sex star to legitimate actress . Like others in her world , she did not succeed . Over the years , many of Wilsey ' s wounds were self-inflicted . Shannon Wilsey ' s parents divorced in 1972 when she was just 2 . She grew_up in Texas with her mother and then , after a brief stay with her father in Oxnard , lived with her grandparents in Mission Viejo , where she became a high_school cheerleader . Wilsey told her manager , Nancy Pera , that her childhood was unhappy and that she had been molested . That is not uncommon for women who work in the sex industry , studies show . Many were abused as children . But Mike Wilsey said his daughter never told him about any such abuse . Mike Wilsey said she began dating rock_star Gregg Allman while still in high_school , eventually going_on the road with him for a_couple_of years . After returning to California and deciding on a career in Hollywood , Wilsey drifted into adult entertainment . She rose to fame in the world of screen sex as fast as anyone had . Her symmetrical good looks , enhanced by two breast enlargements , and her curtains of blond hair brought her to the attention of Vivid Video in Van Nuys . The company signed her to a contract and starred her in a four-part &quot; On Trial &quot; series that revolved_around a porn star ' s obscenity trial . Her growing celebrity and wealth enabled her to indulge her instinct for excess . Her fascination with rock_stars endured , according to Adult Video News . &quot; I love sex and I love sex with rockers more_than anything else , &quot; she said in an interview . While some of that was probably propaganda for the consumption of naive fans who think , or hope , that porn actresses have insatiable sexual appetites , her exploits eventually filtered beyond the insular world of pornography . People magazine columnist Mitchell Fink reported two years ago that she and one rock_star engaged in what Fink called &quot; full hit whoopie &quot; in a crowded New York bar , after which she jumped into a waiting limousine . It was then that the whispers began : Here was a woman headed for destruction . Wilsey had the temerity to diss Axl Rose as a lousy sex partner in a supermarket tabloid . Bryn Bridenthal , a spokeswoman for Geffen Records , said Rose may_not even have known Wilsey . While mocking conventional mores , she also began isolating herself from the people who could have been her natural allies : other porn actors . In 1992 , Wilsey was named the industry ' s Best New Starlet . At the awards show , she became an anti-Sally Field , reportedly saying in her acceptance speech : &quot; I know a lot of you don ' t like me , but that ' s tough . I got my award. &quot; She also developed a reputation for hard drinking and drug use . Her father said she used heroin for a time . But Pera said this hard , wild veneer was constructed to cover a very vulnerable and lonely young_woman who never felt pretty . Wilsey believed she had no friends and had trouble trusting anyone . &quot; She was very discriminated against because she was so big and didn ' t take any shit from anyone , &quot; Pera said . &quot; She made big money . She knew her value. &quot; Yet her lavish tastes outstripped even her six-figure income . She bought designer clothes and decorated her leased hillside home overlooking Universal City with thousands of dollars worth of art . Her spending on friends was just as mercurial . She spent $ 3 # 000 on a birthday_present . Pera said her idea of economizing was buying a pair of designer shorts on sale for $ 173 . There was no apparent single event that precipitated the suicide , although some said her career had started to slide . More likely , she had been frustrated with her inability to break_away from the work , as she told Pera she would , or break_into legitimate acting . Even though Wilsey dated Hollywood celebrities , she could never be a part of that world . Wilsey ' s famous pals routinely trashed the sex industry to her , &quot; but the whole reason they were with her was because she was a porn star , &quot; said Jeanna Fine , a former sex star and friend of Wilsey ' s . Pera , 46 , who considered herself as much a second mother as a manager , said Wilsey had been depressed for months over her breakup with rock guitarist Slash , like Rose of the band Guns ' N Roses . Bridenthal of Geffen Records denied that Slash had a romantic relationship with Wilsey . &quot; If she was ( carrying a torch ) , it was completely one-sided , &quot; she said . Of late , Wilsey ' s problems had been intensifying . &quot; Maybe I should kill myself , &quot; she told friends on more_than one occasion . Police said she owed money to the Internal Revenue Service and her savings account was so depleted that she had arranged to send Pera money to cover checks from Nyack , N.Y. , where she was booked for a nude_dancing engagement at a club called Lace . While videos launch careers in the adult entertainment business , dancing is where real money can be made . As a featured performer , Wilsey would earn as much as $ 5 # 000 a night . The engagement was_due to start Monday of this week , but Pera said Wilsey was out late Sunday night partying and riding around in a limo with a young_man who was house-sitting for the band House of Pain . Pera said Wilsey had been dating one of the band members . Wilsey drove_up the winding road to her home just after 2 a.m. so erratically that her passenger complained . &quot; I ' m fine , &quot; she replied . Then she crashed her Corvette into a picket_fence , taking_out part of it . Pera was awakened a short time later by Wilsey ' s hysterical call . &quot; I ' ve just had a horrible car accident , &quot; the woman wailed . &quot; I broke my nose . It ' s bleeding really bad and I ' ve hit my head . You have to take me to the hospital. &quot; Pera dressed and drove to Wilsey ' s house , not too hurriedly because she was used to late-night calls from the sex star . When she arrived , she found Wilsey ' s body lying_in a pool of blood in the garage . Pera saw the exit wound from the bullet . &quot; It looked_like she had a big flower on the side of her head , &quot; she said . When emergency personnel carried Wilsey out , Pera grabbed her foot and screamed : &quot; Savannah , stay with us ! &quot; Pera said Wilsey got the gun from a friend for protection against prowlers , and slept_with it under her pillow . Police ruled the death a suicide . &quot; She was not happy with her life as_a_whole , everything in her life , &quot; said Los Angeles Police Detective Mike Coffey . &quot; I think her whole life caused her suicide. &quot; Pera speculated that the injury to her face from the car wreck could have seemed like the last straw , because it would have prevented her from making the nude_dancing engagement . Underscoring the need for counseling in the industry , Pera said Wilsey was in great conflict over her lifestyle , despite her public bravado . She bragged about doing crazy things , yet she told Pera she wished her mother had tried to stop her from performing . &quot; She felt bad because her mother didn ' t say anything about her being in the business , &quot; Pera said . Mike Wilsey had tried to mend fences with his daughter recently . After her death , he found an unmailed letter she had written to him . &quot; Where was I when she was dating Gregg Allman when he was 25 years older than she was ? Where was I when she was_on heroin ? Where was I when she started doing porno movies ? &quot; was how Mike Wilsey paraphrased it . He said he would have been there had she only asked . Like many in the business , Paul Fishbein , the publisher of Adult Video News , resents any implication that the sex industry could have played a role in Wilsey ' s death . &quot; Porn didn ' t do this , &quot; he said . Still , Fishbein said he recognizes that it is time for the industry to face the problems young actresses bring with them . He said the help line is &quot; still in the formative stages , &quot; but insisted &quot; it ' s happening. &quot; Weighing_on Margold ' s mind these days are not the deaths that have already occurred , but those waiting to happen . &quot; Six weeks ago at 3 a.m. I got a call from an actress who said the business has no soul . She said four years ago , somebody told her that and then that woman killed herself. &quot;</TEXT>
