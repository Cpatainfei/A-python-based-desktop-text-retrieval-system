   <HEADLINE> SPOKESPERSON GOT YOU NERVOUS ? THERE ' S HELP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Death before dishonor ! &quot; goes the ancient battle_cry . But where a company ' s celebrity spokesperson is concerned , either result is to be feared . that ' s why a unit of American International Group Inc. has begun offering &quot; Death , Disablement and Disgrace &quot; insurance . The policies -- with coverage limits up_to $ 5 million -- protect corporations &quot; against losses associated with the cancellation of celebrity promotions or endorsements due_to events that are beyond the insured ' s control , &quot; Robert R . Brace , president of AIG ' s American International Entertainment subsidiary , said Wednesday . The insurance compensates companies for the loss of irrecoverable production_costs or the expense of revising a promotional campaign for the same product . AI Entertainment has long been writing entertainment performance coverage -- insuring that the Rolling Stones will show_up for a concert , for example -- and Brace described the new product as &quot; an extension of what we ' ve done. &quot; &quot; Heightened scrutiny by the media has increased the need for this type of coverage , &quot; he added , though he declined to cite specific cases . Some obvious examples leap to mind , however . O.J. Simpson was a spokesman for Hertz before he became a murder defendant . Actor James Garner promoted the beef industry before encountering well-publicized heart problems . Besides using medical tests and other documentation to help gauge the risk posed by a particular spokesperson , the insurers might also take_into_account a celebrity ' s media image , Brace said .</TEXT>
