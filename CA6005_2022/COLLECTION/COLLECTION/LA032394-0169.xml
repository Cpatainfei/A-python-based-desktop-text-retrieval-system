   <HEADLINE> HOWARD ROSENBERG : THE EBERTS : THE NEW AWARDS FOR FAWNING ; TELEVISION : THE FILM CRITIC THUMBS HIS NOSE AT OBJECTIVITY BY HOSTING KABC ' S PRE-OSCAR SCHMOOZEFEST -- A JOB HE SEEMS BORN FOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Roger and me . . . . &quot; Enjoy yourself. &quot; You rubbed your eyes , blinked repeatedly and tried to focus . It was a Regis Philbin . It was a Tawny Little . It was a Chuck Henry . No , none of those . Incredibly , amazingly , supersonically , it was a Roger Ebert , planted like a palm beside a microphone by the red_carpet at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion with his partner for the evening , Pam Thomson , fawning over preening celebrities as if joined at the brain with &quot; Eyewitness News. &quot; As if his entire career as a movie critic had been building toward this wondrous moment when he could shed all pretenses of professionalism and be affable and avuncular with everybody who was anybody . As if he ' d been born for it . And just beyond , in the throng of onlookers , you could see the Hollywood wanna-bes side-by-side with the has-beens , those ghostly apparitions who might have earned a live shot in front of the camera in past years , but now were reduced to watching from the wings and hoping somehow to be noticed and summoned to appear before Ebert and the others . Whoopi , shmoopi . Monday night ' s Academy Awards telecast on ABC was three sleepy hours of anti-climactic yawn compared with the dueling team coverages that preceded it . Local news -- that ' s where the action was . that ' s where the short , roundish , gray-topped , bespectacled half of Siskel &amp; Ebert was . In his emerging role as emcee for the stars , Ebert was more entertaining even than Monday night ' s Revlon commercials in which Nancy Kerrigan performed like a cursor controlled by a joystick . Once the exclusive stage of KABC-TV Channel 7 , the grandly vacant , annual Oscar pre-show has evolved into an electrifying free-for-all among network stations in Los Angeles , with KNBC-TV Channel 4 and KCBS-TV Channel 2 pushing their way into the circle to make this an electrifying threesome . And what team coverage it was . Channel 2 had David Sheehan ( who used to do this for Channel 4 ) and hyper-kinetic Pat Lalama , who must have set a record for close-ups while trying to meld her face to the camera_lens . Channel 4 put its own unique stamp on the event , including having a chopper hover over milling celebrities at the Pavilion . It was a smart move , because you never know when a police chase can break_out . Behind the anchor desk were Colleen Williams and Chuck Henry ( an alumnus of Channel 7 ' s pre-Oscar show ) . While his colleagues were fawning in_general , specialist Henry at one point expertly fawned ( from afar ) over female breasts . On the scene for Channel 4 was Garrett Glaser , who broke the rumor that Macaulay Culkin was absent from the Oscars . As Channel 4 viewers gasped , Glaser reported that the excuse offered by little Macaulay ' s camp was that &quot; another commitment &quot; had prevailed , but Glaser skeptically noted the scuttlebutt that Macaulay was held_out by his father , who was &quot; displeased because of some copy written for him. &quot; But it would take more_than this shocking disclosure by Glaser to upstage his more seasoned colleague in the field , Kelly Lange . As adept at self-promotion as at fawning , it was Lange who commanded Janet Jackson : &quot; You are live_on the 5 o ' clock news . Say hello to our viewers out there . There are millions of them. &quot; And it was Channel 4 newcomer Kathy Vara who managed to corner &quot; Entertainment Tonight &quot; co-host Mary Hart and press her to reveal exclusively to Channel 4 ( the station on which Hart ' s program airs ) just how &quot; Entertainment Tonight &quot; would be covering the Oscars . After pausing a millisecond , Hart quickly capitulated . But quickly , back to the studio for this self-fawning update from Henry : &quot; We have cameras all_over the place , &quot; he told viewers , &quot; so you will not miss a thing by keeping it here. &quot; Wrong . They would have missed Ebert . He and Gene Siskel are such an institution , are in such demand , that they ' ve become their own hot-ticket cottage industry , doing everything short of opening shopping_centers . The gigs just pour in . But it ' s Ebert who has demonstrated that he ' s the new , unsurpassed meister of criticshtick . His work for Channel 7 Monday night , as a self-proclaimed arbiter for all seasons and reasons , affirmed that he has acquired a kind of celestial omniscience in the universe of moviedom , someone to be followed like a Bethlehem star . Or to put it more crassly , the words self-parody come_to_mind . Proving he knew how to play the game , Ebert was a natural , taking_to vapid pre-Oscar schmooze like a critic to the plaudits &quot; magical &quot; or &quot; fully realized &quot; or &quot; triumph of the human spirit &quot; or &quot; one of the year ' s 10 best. &quot; When he interviewed Christian Slater while treating the woman at the actor ' s side as if she were invisible or a leper , you knew his future was in the stars . Ebert to a star : &quot; Enjoy yourself tonight , yeah , goodby. &quot; To another star : &quot; You ' re more relaxed this year than last year. &quot; To another star : &quot; A billion people will be listening to you tonight . Is that OK ? &quot; And all_of this without cue cards . Of course , some of the interviews had greater depth . Ebert to supporting actor nominee Pete Postlethwaite : &quot; It must seem strange that the whole world knows your name. &quot; Postlethwaite : &quot; Well , it ' s a good name. &quot; Ebert : &quot; Have fun tonight. &quot; Speaking of fun , when the conveyor_belt of celebrities delivered Kerrigan -- who managed to mention her cosmetics employer in each of her TV interviews -- Ebert grilled her but good . Ebert ( with a stone face ) : &quot; Do you think you might want to move_into the direction of acting instead of skating ? &quot; Apparently , he hadn ' t seen her on &quot; Saturday Night Live. &quot; Once upon a time you yearned for those pre-Oscar shows with Tawny Little , now a sedate KCAL-TV Channel 9 anchor , who would get so worked_up in the presence of stars that she would almost leap_out of her dress . In his own way , though , Ebert has eclipsed even Little . Here he was shouting at supporting actress nominee Rosie Perez : &quot; ROSIE ! ROSIE ! Hi , how are ya ? . . . I ' m predicting you ' re going to win. &quot; As if Ebert ' s command would be the movie academy ' s wish , Perez replied , &quot; Thank you , thank you. &quot; It was when Ebert began quoting his own reviews to stars that you wanted to stand_up and applaud . After quoting himself to soon-to-be best actress winner Holly Hunter : &quot; Were you mad at me ? &quot; Hunter : &quot; I didn ' t hear you say that. &quot; Ebert : &quot; Oh . . . . &quot; Later in the evening , Ebert co-hosted Channel 7 ' s post-Academy Awards show with Thomson , spinning on his tall swivel stool as reporters checked_in from various Oscar parties . If Channel 7 doesn ' t bring him back in 1995 , it will be a crime equal_to the Academy Awards ignoring an Oscar-deserving performance . As an evening , it was one of the year ' s 10 best . All thumbs .</TEXT>
