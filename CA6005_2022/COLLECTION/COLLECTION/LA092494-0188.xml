   <TEXT> Exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , apparently holding_out an olive_branch to his political foes , agreed Friday to call a special_session of the island nation ' s Parliament to vote on amnesty for the leaders of the bloody coup that deposed him three years ago . With about 15 # 000 U.S. troops poised to referee , Aristide and Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , the chief coup plotter , jockeyed for position in_advance of Oct . 15 , the date the military regime is scheduled to give_up power so Aristide can regain the presidency . The outcome of the high-stakes political contest could shape Haiti ' s future and determine whether the U.S. occupation ends as peacefully as it began . Going_against the advice of some of his closest aides , Aristide agreed to allow Parliament to consider a pardon for Cedras , Lt . Gen . Philippe Biamby , Lt . Col . Joseph-Michel Francois and other coup leaders for crimes committed during and after the insurrection that drove Aristide from power Sept . 30 , 1991 . Michael Barnes , Aristide ' s Washington attorney , confirmed that the exiled president will soon summon Parliament to consider an amnesty bill . That would allow the lawmakers to decide if Cedras and his followers will be able to remain in Haiti without fear of arrest . Aristide would issue the call from Washington , where he is living pending his return to Haiti , and is not expected to attend the parliamentary session in Port-au-Prince . The disclosure came as President Clinton declared the first five days of the U.S. operation in Haiti a success . He said conditions have improved enough to permit the first contingent of refugees to return home from the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . &quot; In short , our mission is going well , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; I am very proud_of the competence and the discipline our troops and their commanders have demonstrated. &quot; Also Friday , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said he plans to fly to former President Jimmy_Carter ' s home_in Plains , Ga. , today for a private meeting to patch_up misunderstandings over Carter ' s negotiations with Cedras and Biamby last weekend . Carter was critical of U.S. policy on Haiti and of Christopher personally in a series of interviews after his return from Haiti . For his part , Christopher is known to believe that the former President exceeded his authority in negotiating a deal that made far more concessions to the military_leaders than the Administration had wanted to give . It was Carter ' s seven-point agreement that raised the amnesty issue , which may hold the key to Haiti ' s immediate political future . Cedras has vowed to stay in the country and remain part of its political life . Aristide wants to force the military_leaders into exile . Cedras wants a broad amnesty covering acts by him and by all other members of the military during or after the coup . Aristide has offered amnesty for &quot; political &quot; crimes such_as treason and insurrection , but not for &quot; common &quot; crimes such_as murder , rape and embezzlement . Cedras and his followers could remain in Haiti without fear of arrest under the broad plan he favors but probably would have to go_into exile under Aristide ' s narrow proposal . U.S. officials are hoping that the Parliament can come_up with a middle ground that would be generous enough to help reconcile Haiti ' s hostile factions but still would make_it so uncomfortable for Cedras that he would leave the country . Aristide probably will ask_for the narrow interpretation when he calls Parliament into session . But the lawmakers are not required to follow his lead . Aristide had difficulty getting legislation through Parliament even before the coup . Further complicating matters are questions about the current makeup of Parliament . Most members were elected in 1990 , before the coup . But the military government conducted elections in 1993 that are not recognized internationally . For the vote to have any validity in the rest of the world , the legislators elected in 1993 would have to be excluded . In addition , several dozen lawmakers fled Haiti after the coup and now live_in the United States . The Administration has offered to help these representatives , not all_of them backers of Aristide but all critical of the military , return to vote , but they have not yet indicated if they will go . Aristide ' s key advisers recommended against any sort of amnesty . Jean-Claude Martineau , Aristide ' s official spokesman , said : &quot; President Aristide has to establish in Haiti the rule_of_law and it will make_it difficult for him to do this if the military steps_down but can stay in the country with their assets . These three guys are richer than the whole nation . What are they going_to do ? They can disrupt everything . They can finance terrorism . They have killed so_much in the past. &quot; On Thursday , when the Administration first argued that Parliament could only be called into session by Aristide , it was widely believed that he would block amnesty by refusing to summon the lawmakers . But Sen . Sam Nunn ( D-Ga. ) and other members of Congress pressured Aristide to seek amnesty . During an hourlong meeting on Capitol_Hill , Nunn , who was a member of Carter ' s negotiating team , told Aristide that the House and the Senate will be influenced by Aristide ' s decision on amnesty when they vote , probably next week , on legislation setting a time_limit for the U.S. occupation of Haiti . &quot; The next 72 hours are crucial , &quot; Nunn told reporters after the meeting . &quot; President Aristide ' s leadership over these 72 hours will have a real effect on the flexibility that the Senate and the House of Representatives give to President Clinton. &quot; Aristide and his backers fear that Cedras will try to hold power through some sort of ruse . Burton Wides , an Aristide lawyer , predicted that a_few days before the Oct . 15 deadline , Cedras and his supporters will begin to charge violations of some of the terms of the transfer of power agreement and will claim that gives them a right to retain their positions . If that happens , he said , Clinton will again be faced with the choice of using military_force in Haiti or backing_down . White_House officials say there is no possibility that the U.S._government will allow Cedras and his backers to thwart Aristide ' s return to power . U.S. forces have overwhelming military superiority , should the Administration decide to use it . Aristide and his camp do not question Washington ' s military might . But after three years of exile in which the George_Bush Administration and the Clinton_Administration talked_of restoring him without taking decisive action until recently , Aristide is afraid that the United States will shy away at the last minute from using force if the military_leaders try to retain power . An Administration official said there is no doubt that the United States will use as much military_force as is necessary to make_sure Aristide regains the presidency . But he admitted that , in light of recent events , Aristide ' s fear of a sellout was &quot; not entirely paranoia. &quot; Times staff writers Elizabeth Shogren and Michael Ross contributed to this report</TEXT>
