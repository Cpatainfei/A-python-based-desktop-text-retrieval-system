   <HEADLINE> COMEDY ; JUGGLING WORDS ; AFTER YEARS OF TOSSING INDIAN_CLUBS , CHRIS BLISS DECIDED TO GET VERBAL -- AND TOPICAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Orange County ' s reputation as a conservative audience tough on comedians with a viewpoint doesn ' t faze social observer Chris Bliss . He has a simple credo : Smart comedy transcends politics and narrow-mindedness . &quot; I look_for what ' s funny to me and then try to make_it as funny as possible for other people , &quot; said Bliss , who is the middle act at the Irvine Improv through Sunday , then returns Jan . 10 as the headliner . &quot; The idea is to communicate some ideas without being preachy . I don ' t believe_in comedy that is accessible only to the comics at the back of the room , unless it ' s one of those nights when the audience is_on life support . Then it ' s OK to be hipper than thou. &quot; He sees his task as not unlike the court jester of yore , pointing_out that the emperor is naked . His goal is not to take cheap shots , but to open a dialogue , make a connection . &quot; I don ' t want to be a comedy vulture feeding off the corpse , &quot; said Bliss , who grew_up in Washington , the son of a corporate lawyer . &quot; The reason I ' m on stage is I have a strong desire to communicate . What good is intelligence if you can ' t communicate ? And it has to be funny. &quot; Irony and absurdity count , too , and Bliss need go no further than a bankrupt Orange County to underscore that point . &quot; It ' s not funny , but is it ironic ? You bet . They got taken by their own people , the brokers. &quot; But for perhaps the ultimate irony , the veteran cable-TV performer turns_to fallout from the Vietnam_War . &quot; For 19 years the Vietnamese were living_off shrapnel . It was the second leading export . They sold the shrapnel to Japan for cars , which ( the Japanese ) sold to us . That is unbelievable , as sweet an irony as you can find . The emotion is out of the cycle at that point . They ' re just selling us back our bombs . Something in there shows how we ' re all tied together . I ' m always looking_for some symbol of unity. &quot; Bliss wasn ' t always so verbal and keenly aware of life around him . Many people still remember him as a world-class juggler who set his act to music -- with black lights and strobes , but no words . His sister taught him the basics when he was in his teens , and it became a way to kill time for the self-described ( back then ) egghead and acerbic guy before he entered college and studied comparative_literature in the early ' 70s . By the early ' 80s , he was tossing Indian_clubs around the globe , and in 1984 he opened for Michael Jackson ' s Victory Tour . But a_couple_of years later , while touring with Julian Lennon , he tired_of being a variety act and decided to try his hand at stand-up . &quot; The hardest part of doing stand-up was to walk away from something I was excellent at , &quot; the Van Nuys resident said earlier his week after returning from Cleveland to a pile of junk mail . ( &quot; It ' s the gift of the information age . There ' s a reprocessed redwood on my table. &quot; ) &quot; I was doing 15 minutes of bad stand-up and 15 minutes of great juggling . It finally hit me that I was really , really bad. &quot; But with constant work , the comedy soon overtook the juggling portion of the show , and Bliss was headlining on comedy alone . For a while he abandoned juggling altogether , but has restored some of it to the routine as he gained confidence in his humor . &quot; In the last two years , I ' ve found a voice as a comic , &quot; said Bliss , who is_on the road 30 to 35 weeks a year , flying about 50 # 000 miles . &quot; I wound_up back in the verbal world . And I like it here. &quot; More recently , he has found something else to like : his first &quot; Tonight Show &quot; gig . He appeared in the middle of September , after being bumped a_few weeks earlier by Max the Sea_Lion , who played Andre the Seal_in the movie &quot; Andre. &quot; &quot; He had a picture , and I didn ' t , &quot; Bliss said . &quot; I understand it . There ' s a pecking order. &quot; Besides , he still got paid and had a fine time -- such a fine time that Bliss expects to do his second &quot; Tonight Show &quot; set within six weeks of completing his Irvine shows . &quot; It was completely professional . They make_sure you are completely comfortable , completely welcome . Basically , your questions are answered before you can ask them . There ' s nothing to think_about except your performance. &quot; Part of Bliss ' motivation comes from his frustration at watching society function in an Us-vs.-Them manner . He rails against the powerful who perpetrate that structure . He ' s afraid they don ' t understand the divisions such an adversarial approach opens in society . He brought_up a show he did after last month ' s elections , when a man in the audience yelled out , &quot; We ' re the taking the country back ! &quot; &quot; From whom ! ? ! ? &quot; Bliss asks , incredulous . &quot; He was just some dittohead in the Us-vs.-Them mentality . I don ' t think it ' s a very good way to run a society . What works in business doesn ' t necessarily work in society . It ' s more like a family-run business . Nobody understands where the other person is coming from . &quot; It disturbs me in this country we have people living separate realities ( who ) can ' t relate to anyone different . They have views , not facts. &quot; Not knowing the facts and blindly accepting the status_quo worries Bliss . That tells him no one is thinking . And that ' s not helping the democracy run . &quot; When the Gulf war was happening , it was very inspiring . Who wants to toe the party_line ? The propaganda machine ? I mean , tie a yellow ribbon around the Exxon pump . There was nothing funny , but a lot was absurd . I can smell a falsehood in Denmark or Limbaugh Land . These things make you have a point of point_of_view . The L.A. riots give you a point_of_view . &quot; ( Comedians ) are not curing cancer , but we can put a_few dents in ignorance. &quot; * Who : Chris Bliss . * When : Tonight , Dec . 15 , at 8:30 p.m. ; Friday , Dec . 16 , at 8:30 and 10:30 p.m. ; Saturday , Dec . 17 , at 8 and 10:30 p.m. , and Sunday , Dec . 18 , at 8 p.m. * Where : The Improv , 4255 Campus Drive , Irvine . * Whereabouts : Take the San Diego ( 405 ) Freeway to the Jamboree Road exit and head south .
