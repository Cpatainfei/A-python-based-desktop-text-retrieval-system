   <HEADLINE> FORMER MCNALL ACCOUNTANT WILL PLEAD GUILTY ; JURISPRUDENCE : HOUSTON ADMITS TO HAVING ROLE IN PREPARING FALSE TAX_RETURNS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO HELP OBTAIN MILLIONS IN BANK LOANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Robert J . Houston , a former accountant for King president Bruce McNall , has agreed to plead guilty to three criminal counts for his role in preparing false tax_returns and financial_statements so that McNall could get more_than $ 150 million in loans to shore_up his deteriorating business and financial situation , sources said Tuesday . The plea is expected to be entered within two weeks . Federal_officials on Tuesday charged Houston with bank fraud , wire fraud and conspiracy . Houston was accused in court papers of being part of a group of McNall officials who for the last eight years fraudulently obtained loans by inflating McNall ' s income , overstating his assets and understating or omitting previous loans . Houston ' s lawyer could not be reached for comment . Federal_officials allege that the fraudulent documents , as well as a group of &quot; sham companies , &quot; enabled McNall officials to get money for horse and coin operations as well as a $ 60-million business loan and a $ 20-million personal_loan from Bank of America . Among the financial_institutions prosecutors named as victims were Bank of America , Bank of California , First Los Angeles Bank , Union Bank and Credit Lyonnais , a French bank . Houston , whom sources said has been cooperating with the government investigation , is the second McNall executive to agree to plead guilty within the last month and one of about a dozen former McNall business associates known to have been negotiating pleas . Previously , Joanna Orehek , former vice_president and controller , pleaded guilty . Sources have confirmed that McNall , who was sole owner of the Kings before selling 72 % of the team this year to pay_off a bank loan , has agreed to plead guilty to four criminal counts in connection with the bank-fraud investigation . He is expected to enter the plea in October . McNall ' s lawyer , Tom Pollack , said Houston ' s plea was expected . Among the allegations made in the complaint is that Houston and other McNall officials participated in a scheme to allow an officer with New York-based European American Bank to wipe clean a loan to McNall ' s troubled movie production operation so the officer could get a substantial bonus . Federal_officials did not identify the official , but sources confirmed it is former Chairman Raymond J . Dempsey , who left the bank in 1990 . He could not be reached for comment . It also describes how McNall officials orchestrated a phony $ 20-million &quot; circular loan &quot; to two sham companies to get McNall off_the_hook in personally guaranteeing film production loans . Prosecutors allege the $ 20-million loan was represented as an investment by a European consortium in Gladden Entertainment , a film production company McNall owned with longtime Hollywood executive David Begelman . They further allege McNall officials said the phony investors refused to allow McNall to continue to personally guarantee the film loans made by Credit Lyonnais , resulting in his release from that obligation . McNall ' s legal problems extend beyond his banking practices . The government ' s case has expanded into an investigation of 399 ancient coins worth $ 3.3 million that had been reported missing from securities giant Merrill Lynch ' s World Coin Fund . Sources said McNall was paying installments of $ 100 # 000 a month to Zurich coin dealer Hans Schram , who reclaimed them when McNall ' s payment stopped . Investigators are looking_at whether McNall charged the fund $ 4 million for the coins and wired the money to a Swiss company he owned .</TEXT>
