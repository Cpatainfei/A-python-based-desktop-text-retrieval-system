   <HEADLINE> HOME COOK : DIPS AND DUNKS , DITS AND DOOTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As much as I enjoy cooking , I find myself uninspired when it comes_to making appetizers or hors d ' oeuvres . In fact , I ' m slightly impatient with the whole custom of eating just before sitting_down at the table ( though I always eat whatever is passed_around ) . Perhaps the ' 40s-era custom of accompanying the pre-meal drinks with a swath of cream_cheese in the form of dips and dunks ( James Beard use to call these dits and doots ) just became too_much . But if you ' re going to serve appetizers , at least skip those that are more trouble to make than they are worth . And don ' t serve dinner so late that everyone is sated before being seated at the table . Appetizers are only intended to stave_off acute hunger pangs and temper drinking on an empty stomach . * Most people seem to like deviled eggs . They are best when you don ' t get too creative with them , such_as adding tarragon and other alien flavors . Make_sure the yolk filling is blended smoothly . DEVILED EGGS 4 hard-cooked eggs 3 tablespoons mayonnaise 1 teaspoon Dijon mustard Salt Freshly ground pepper Parsley Shell eggs and slice in half lengthwise . Remove yolks . In bowl mash yolks with mayonnaise , mustard , salt and pepper to taste until smoothly blended and creamy . Divide into 8 equal portions and stuff into hollow of each egg_white . Sprinkle tops with parsley to taste . Makes 4 servings . Each serving contains about : 151 calories ; 227 mg sodium ; 218 mg cholesterol ; 13 grams fat ; 1 gram carbohydrates ; 6 grams protein ; trace fiber . * At the moment , this is my favorite appetizer . It ' s a &quot; two for the price of one &quot; recipe . After you serve the zucchini you will have enough garlic olive_oil to dress several salads or spike up some sauces . You can substitute broccoli or tiny artichokes for zucchini . ZUCCHINI , OLIVE_OIL AND GARLIC APPETIZER 1 1 / 2 pounds shiny , firm zucchini Kosher salt 1 cup olive_oil 4 large cloves garlic , each chopped into 4 or 5 pieces 1 / 4 teaspoon hot_pepper sauce Trim stem and root end of zucchini and cut_into pieces about 3 / 4 inch long . In pot cook zucchini in boiling salted water until firm but slightly tender , about 1 1 / 2 minutes . Drain and set_aside . Pour olive_oil into bowl large enough to hold zucchini . Add garlic and hot_pepper sauce . Stir to mix . Season hot zucchini generously with salt to taste . Add_to olive_oil marinade and toss to coat . Cover and set_aside at room_temperature ( in refrigerator if making day ahead ) . Stir every few hours until serving time . Remove zucchini from marinade . Adjust seasonings to taste . Serve at room_temperature with napkins . Makes 5 servings . Each serving contains about : 118 calories ; 200 mg sodium ; trace cholesterol ; 11 grams fat ; 5 grams carbohydrates ; 2 grams protein ; 0.65 gram fiber . * This tastes far better than it reads . GARLIC SWISS_CHEESE SPREAD 1 / 2 cup mayonnaise 2 cloves garlic , peeled and finely chopped or put_through garlic_press 2 cups grated Swiss_cheese 2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley Crackers In bowl mix mayonnaise and garlic thoroughly with Swiss_cheese , using enough mayonnaise to make spreadable . Put mixture into bowl just large enough to contain ingredients , cover with plastic_wrap and refrigerate . When ready to serve , turn_out onto platter and form into mound using hands . Sprinkle with parsley and surround with crackers . Makes 2 1 / 2 cups . Each tablespoon contains about : 27 calories ; 32 mg sodium ; 5 mg cholesterol ; 2 grams fat ; 1 gram carbohydrates ; 1 gram protein ; trace fiber .</TEXT>
