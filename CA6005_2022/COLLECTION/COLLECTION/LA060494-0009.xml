   <HEADLINE> U.S. CONSULTS KEY ALLIES ON NORTH_KOREA SANCTIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration began consultations Friday with key U.S. allies on imposing punitive sanctions against North_Korea , but officials said the plan initially calls_for only mild restrictions to avoid pushing Pyongyang into further isolation . Robert L . Gallucci , assistant secretary_of_state for political-military affairs , met separately in Washington with South_Korean and Japanese officials in preparation for a broader conference involving all three allies early this morning . At the same time , senior Administration policy-makers traveling with President Clinton in Europe conferred privately with British , French and German counterparts . They also telephoned Chinese officials , whose support is considered crucial for approval of a sanctions resolution . Clinton himself called South_Korean President Kim Young Sam , who agreed on the broad U.S. strategy . The President also phoned Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin , rejecting a new Russian proposal to convene an international conference to discuss the standoff over North_Korea ' s nuclear program . The flurry of activity marked the start of what is expected to be a complex effort to build a coalition in favor of some sort of sanctions -- by the middle of next week , officials hope , when the U.N. Security_Council is scheduled to take_up the issue . Hans Blix , director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency , briefed Security_Council members on his agency ' s conclusion that Pyongyang has made_it all but impossible for inspectors to determine whether it has diverted spent fuel to make nuclear_weapons . Meanwhile , North_Korea appealed for a new round of talks with the United States . But it was rebuffed by the Administration , which repeated its intention to pursue imposition of sanctions instead . Pyongyang also test-fired another anti-ship missile . There were some initial signs that China might be easing its longstanding opposition to U.N. sanctions against North_Korea -- possibly a result of Clinton ' s decision last week to continue special trade preferences for Beijing . Diplomats said China has seemed more cooperative in recent negotiations . Wire_services said a government-controlled newspaper reported Friday that if an embargo were ordered , Beijing would halt food and oil supplies to North_Korea . Both U.S. and foreign officials indicated that the discussions involving the Japanese and South_Koreans were preliminary and did not result in decisions . &quot; It ' s really too early at this point , &quot; one insider said . But Washington-based diplomats said the Administration is considering the possibility of pushing for relatively modest sanctions at first to avoid provoking Pyongyang into withdrawing from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , which governs reactor inspections . If Pyongyang still does not yield , the allies would then press for a freeze on North_Korea ' s financial transactions and , finally , for a cutoff of oil and food supplies -- the most drastic step_in the proposed sanctions arsenal . One concession that Washington wants Pyongyang to make immediately is to allow international inspectors to take samplings and measurements at its two major radioactive waste sites -- an alternative to analyzing spent fuel rods in its reactor , which already has been emptied . All sides conceded that pushing a sanctions resolution through the Security_Council is likely to be difficult . Even Japan , which opposes North_Korea ' s nuclear program , said it wants the United Nations to issue another warning before invoking sanctions . Han Seung Soo , South_Korea ' s ambassador to the United States , said in a telephone_interview that the contents of the allies ' proposed sanctions resolution could vary widely , &quot; depending_upon the reactions from China and Russia. &quot; &quot; China has repeatedly said they prefer dialogue , &quot; he said . &quot; Unless we are assured that they will abstain_from a Security_Council resolution , it would be very difficult &quot; to pass a formal proposal , even for gradual imposition of sanctions .</TEXT>
