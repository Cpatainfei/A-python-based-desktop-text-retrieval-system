   <HEADLINE> SILENT KILLERS ; SEX , DRUGS , WAR AND TRAVEL ARE HELPING TO SPREAD DISEASES RAPIDLY WORLDWIDE ; THE COMING PLAGUE : NEWLY EMERGING DISEASES IN A WORLD OUT OF BALANCE , BY LAURIE GARRETT ( FARRAR , STRAUS &amp; GIROUX : $ 25 ; 750 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As medical_students in the mid-1960s , we paid little heed to public health . Our one public class was a half-credit , half-term sleeper late in the second year when all we cared about was starting the third year when we would begin &quot; real &quot; doctoring . Neither did we accord much respect_to the monumental public health achievements of the past , cleaning_up the human condition , virtually doubling the American life span in the course of the previous century , nor did we have any inkling of the vulnerability of those victories . We were focused_on the curvature care of individuals -- individuals with heart_disease , cancer and stroke , diseased of_aging in a society that , to the extent we even thought about it , believed it had conquered infectious_disease . The students of the 1960s , schooled in a culture that accorded little importance to infectious_disease and population medicine , are today ' s leaders in a world whose biology and epidemiology are worrisomely different from what was expected . Historic killers such_as TB and measles are_on the rise , cholera and plague remain much with us , and new lethal pathogens are erupting regularly . These ugly realities are both symbolized and , for practical purposes , trumped by the global pandemic of AIDS that , according to some estimates , promises to infect 100 million people by the early years of the 21st Century , leaving incalculable devastation in its wake . This microbiological resurgence in a world grown complacent is the topic of Laurie Garrett ' s &quot; The Coming Plague : Newly Emerging Diseases in World Out of Balance. &quot; Her treatise is encyclopedic in detail , missionary in zeal and disturbing in its message . By the mid-20th Century , many scientists and policy_makers assumed that vaccines and antibiotics would soon tame the world of infectious_disease . This confidence was not limited to the West . In 1963 , Chairman Mao confidently joined the struggle against &quot; pests , &quot; declaring war on schistosomiasis in China . The Four seas are rising , clouds and waters raging , The Five Continents are rocking , wind and thunder roaring . Away with all pests ! Our force is irresistible . But Garrett ' s chronicle of these pests does not play_out so simply . While &quot; Smallpox Zero &quot; ( the global eradication of small pox ) was achieved in 1977 , that triumph stands as mankind ' s only definitive victory over infectious_disease . Malaria , once targeted for extinction , remains very much at_bay , as are polio and measles , diseases for which excellent vaccines exist . More disturbing has been the appearance of an array of disease that are either new or newly prominent due_to changing ecology . Lyme disease is identified as a tick-borne infection on the coast of Connecticut and 15 years later has been diagnosed in all 50 states . The Marburg virus is established as the cause of a deadly hemorrhagic_fever killing scientists working with primates in Germany and Yugoslavia but its origin is in the jungles of East Africa . Similar viruses dubbed Ebola and Lassa cause lethal epidemics in African communities and recede again . Legionnaires ' disease and Toxic Shock Syndrome are newly virulent manifestations of known bacteria , and the Hanta virus that suddenly kills people in the rural Southwest is a new genetic variation of an old virus carried by an unusually robust population of deer_mice . &quot; The Coming Plague &quot; details varieties of human behavior that , perhaps even more_than the resilience of microorganisms , have promoted the spread of disease . Sex , drugs , war and travel have_on their own and together created circumstances where venereal and blood-borne diseases have been effectively seeded and spread . Increased heterosexual and homosexual promiscuity and prostitution have brought syphilis and gonorrhea back from virtual extinction . Hepatitis and AIDS have followed the same routes , amplified by needle sharing , attacking knowing participants and unknowing spouses and offspring . War and civil strife have given us back cholera in Rwanda , created a seedbed for AIDS in Uganda and Tanzania , and launched drug-resistant gonorrhea in Vietnam . Air_travel provides the means to send a microbe anywhere in the world with staggering efficiency . Indeed it is the globalization and , most particularly , the &quot; thirdworldization &quot; of life on much of the planet that is the essence of Garrett ' s diagnosis . An outbreak on one continent is now a potential outbreak on all continents . The march of poverty , drugs , war and tribalism has vastly expanded the &quot; petri_dishes &quot; in which old diseases thrive and new ones erupt . She estimates that 21 million people were living as refugees or in war zones at the end of 1993 . The world ' s exploding population -- 1.5 billion at the end of the last century , almost 6 billion today and an estimated 12 billion by the middle of the next century -- is , by itself , a driver of poverty and a spectacular amplifier of disease . One has to read carefully and at some length to find signs of hope amid Garrett ' s disturbing annals of bad microbes , venal behavior and dissolute politics . Technologies are improving and genetic_engineering , in particular , now provides magnificent tools to diagnose and trace the origin and spread of bacteria and viruses . The worldwide vigilance and competence of the U.S. Centers_for_Disease_Control ( CDC ) get good marks and Garrett ' s endorsement as the lead planetary watchdog , given her definitive dismissal of the World_Health_Organization ' s capabilities in these arenas . In the end she argues for a brand of global communitarianism as the only possible counteroffensive to devastating diseases . &quot; Rapid globalization of human niches requires that human_beings everywhere on the planet go beyond viewing their neighborhoods , provinces , countries , or hemispheres as the sum_total of their personal ecospheres. &quot; Population_control , environmental preservation and human development are absolute requirements if we are to have a chance against the certain arrival of new plagues . Laurie Garrett ' s warning echoes John_Donne ' s 400-year-old wisdom , &quot; No man is an island , entire of itself ; every man is a piece of the continent , a part of the main. &quot; &quot; The Coming Plague &quot; makes fascinating if troubling reading . It is an important contribution to our awareness of human_ecology and the fragility of the relative biological well-being that many of us enjoy . Garrett is a journalist , formerly a science correspondent for National Public Radio and now a science writer for New York Newsday . She has mastered an extraordinary amount of detail about the pathology , epidemiology and human events surrounding dozens of complex diseases . She writes engagingly , carrying her themes as well as the reader ' s interest from outbreak to outbreak . At times , though , her details get sloppy . Measles does not produce &quot; a roseola rash &quot; ; roseola infantum is a disease of its own . Reagan ' s first HHS Secretary was Sen . -- not Dr. -- Richard Scweiker . Such small flaws raise unsettling questions in the mind of the reader about which of the thousands of other facts that punctuate her text might be inaccurate . Garrett ' s editors failed to reign in the length and unnecessary detail of the text and to help her maintain a consistent writing_style . At times the book reads like a doctoral thesis with more_than 100 pages of end notes ( but no index ) while at others it sounds more like a classic comic -- &quot; Don Francis was burned_out before he even got_to Harvard. &quot; &quot; The Coming Plague , &quot; though , is the kind of book that might have grabbed the attention of those drowsy , self-absorbed medical_students in that public health class and taught them a thing or two about the world . It is certainly likely to capture the attention of readers today and raise their level of knowledge and concern about the condition of the human world and its microbial fellow_travelers . Or do I have that backward ? It will , perhaps , educate us about the world of microbes . . . and their human fellow_travelers .</TEXT>
