   <HEADLINE> CRACKING_DOWN ON THE RIGHT TARGETS ; REFORM BEGINS TO TOUCH MINDLESS ROBOCOP SENTENCING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It didn ' t get the attention it should have . Section 80001 of the Violent Crime Control and Law_Enforcement Act of 1994 , signed by President Clinton this month , attracted far less notice than , say , the act ' s grants for new police_officers . Yet Section 80001 represents at least a glimmer of hope that the increasingly counterproductive rules governing federal felony sentences might begin to ease . Section 80001 gives federal judges the authority , in limited circumstances , to waive the severe mandatory-minimum sentences for low-level , first-time drug offenders that have been required by law . Long terms in federal prison for such offenders almost certainly do not make_for the best use of that expensive space . Under 80001 , first-time felons in low-level drug cases are eligible for lesser sentences if their offenses do not involve the use or threat of violence and if they cooperate fully with prosecutors by providing evidence . FEAR OF BEING ' SOFT ' : Yet even these few permissible deviations from the indisputably harsh mandatory terms are less than what was originally proposed . Earlier versions of the mammoth crime control act would have made those changes retroactive , affecting perhaps 5 # 000 federal prisoners , already doing five to 10 years for relatively minor drug crimes . More violent criminals should occupy this prison space ; at the least , retroactivity would have served to reduce dangerous overcrowding . Alas , retroactivity was abandoned by members of Congress who , despite the legislation ' s overriding focus_on longer sentences , new offenses and more police_officers , still feared being labeled as soft_on crime . But the issue isn ' t about being soft_on crime , it ' s about smart law_enforcement . Our view is that even relatively minor movement toward greater flexibility represents a welcome retrenchment from Congress ' decade-long push for increasingly long , rigid terms , regardless of the specifics of the case . In the 1980s , Congress enacted a series of laws that set stratospherically high mandatory-minimum prison_terms for people convicted of selling or possessing narcotics , even if the amounts were small and the circumstances mitigating . ( Most states , copy-catting , enacted similar provisions. ) In general , these anti-drug laws do not allow even nonviolent , low-level convicts to be paroled . A first-time offender with no history of violence can be -- and some have been -- sentenced to life for_sale or possession of controlled substances including marijuana . Judges have had no discretion under the federal guidelines ; they simply look_up the crime in the sentence tables , add time to the minimum term where required for &quot; enhancements &quot; to the crime , such_as the use of a firearm , and then move_on to the next case . Understandably , an increasing number of federal judges resent and resist this brainless sentencing scheme : Indeed , about 100 senior judges now refuse even to hear low-level drug cases . PRISONS ' NEW LOOK : Cumulatively , this component of the war on drugs has radically changed the federal prison population . In 1970 drug offenders made_up 16 % of all federal prisoners ; now they are 62 % of the total . By 1997 , the U.S. Bureau of Prisons estimates , 70 % of federal inmates will be serving time for drug crimes . Some federal prisons now house three times the number of people they were designed to hold . Nationwide , the system is operating at a combustible 40 % above capacity . Section 80001 is only the barest nod toward re-infusing our federal criminal justice system with a sense of proportion . For that reason , it should not be the last word from Congress or the U.S. Sentencing Commission ( established by Congress to set the guidelines that judges must apply ) on the Hydra-headed sentencing monster that has been created . The commission will soon be fully staffed for the first time in years . The time for further reform is at_hand .</TEXT>
