   <HEADLINE> LATIN_AMERICAN ECONOMIES FLOURISHING , ACCORDING TO U.N. REPORT ; ECONOMICS : FOR FOURTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR , GROWTH REACHES 3 % IN THE REGION AND IMPORTS SURGE BY 15 % .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With steady economic_growth and reduced inflation in 1994 , Latin_America enhanced its significance as a flourishing market for foreign goods and capital . An annual report issued here this week by the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin_America and the Caribbean said the region ' s economies grew by an average of 3.7 % in 1994 , while its imports surged by 15 % . William R . Cline , a senior fellow at the Washington-based Institute for International Economics , said the report reinforces upbeat assessments of Latin_America ' s increasing economic importance . &quot; This should be a dynamic region in the next decade and beyond , so it ' s an interesting region to ensure that the U.S. has_the_best possible terms of trade , &quot; Cline said by telephone . At the recent Summit of the Americas in Miami , President Clinton and 33 other leaders agreed to complete negotiations for a hemispheric free_trade area by the year 2005 . This was the fourth consecutive year that Latin_American economic_growth reached 3 % and the 1994 rate was the highest of the four . Total growth in the four years was 14 % , more_than in the previous 10 years . The countries with the highest 1994 growth_rates were Peru with 11 % , Guyana with 8 % and Argentina with 6 % , according to preliminary estimates by the U.N. agency . It estimated growth of 3 % for Mexico and 4.5 % for Brazil , the region ' s two biggest countries . The economies of three countries contracted : Haiti by 11 % , Venezuela by 4 % and Honduras by 1.5 % . No 1994 figure was available for Cuba ' s economy , which shrank by 10 % in 1993 . Latin_America ' s 1994 inflation_rate -- excluding Brazil -- was an estimated 16 % , down from 19 % in 1993 and 49 % in 1991 . And though Brazilian inflation exploded at 30 % to 50 % a month in the first_half of 1994 , it subsided to monthly rates of 2 % to 3 % after a new stabilization plan took_effect in July . Latin_American exports grew by 14 % in 1994 , partly because world prices for major export commodities rose but also because the region ' s exporters have learned to compete more efficiently on world markets , the report said . &quot; In the last eight to 10 years , Latin_America has made a great effort to become more competitive internationally , &quot; said Gert Rosenthal , executive_secretary of the U.N. agency . The region ' s exports in 1994 were worth an estimated $ 152.8 billion , nearly double the 1986 value . Imports grew to $ 171 billion this year from $ 59.7 billion in 1986 . About 60 % of Latin_America ' s imports come from the United States ; U.S. exports to the region grew by 63 % between 1989 and 1993 . Rosenthal said an important part of Latin_American imports were capital goods , a sign of increased investment to improve production capacity . Foreign investment capital , loans and revenue from bond sales continued to flow into Latin_America in 1994 . The net increase in foreign capital of $ 57 billion was below the 1993 net of $ 65 billion -- but 10 times more_than in 1988 . Although the Latin_American foreign debt increased in 1994 by almost 6 % to $ 534 billion , due largely to bond sales , Rosenthal observed that export growth makes the debt level manageable for most countries . Exports were the main motor of economic_growth &quot; in a context characterized by increasing price stability , a firm grip on economic_policy , and abundant foreign capital , &quot; the U.N. agency said . Despite the growth , unemployment has increased in many countries . In rapidly growing Argentina , for example , urban unemployment has grown to 11.2 % from 9.6 % in 1993 and 5.6 % in 1986 . &quot; It is evident that , in_general , growth_rates under 4 % in Latin_America and the Caribbean are not high enough to allow major inroads in the battle against poverty or to prevent unemployment and underemployment from remaining unacceptably high , &quot; the U.N. report said .</TEXT>
