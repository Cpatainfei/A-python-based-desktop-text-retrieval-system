   <TEXT> The Simi Valley Unified School District is making copies of the new sex education texts available to the public before the course materials are reviewed by the school_board on Oct . 18 . The school_board adopted the district ' s family life and birth_control curriculum in February in the middle of a community debate over whether schools should only teach abstinence . A committee of teachers and nurses worked during the summer to develop the course materials , which would be used by seventh- and 10th-grade teachers for their sex education classes . &quot; We made a commitment that we would be very open every step of the way with this new curriculum , &quot; said Assistant Supt . Susan C . Parks . &quot; We are previewing it in the office and allowing people to check it out for a short period of time. &quot; Ten copies of the each of the texts , &quot; Human Sexuality : Values and Choices &quot; and &quot; Teen Sexual Behavior : A Leader ' s Resource of Practical Strategies with Youth , &quot; will be available at the district office , 875 E .
