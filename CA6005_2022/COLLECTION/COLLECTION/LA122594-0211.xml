   <HEADLINE> WORLD POPULATION : WILL THIS RUNAWAY TRAIN CRUSH US ALL ? ; ONLY FAR-SEEING POLITICAL LEADERSHIP CAN FRAME A DEFENSE AGAINST A GROWTH THAT THREATENS NATIONS RICH AND POOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The human species may be more_than 100 # 000 years old but the bulk of its numerical growth has come_in just the last few decades : 2.6 billion of today ' s 5.6 billion people have been born since 1960 . Demographer and writer Paul Ehrlich has long called this growth the &quot; population bomb &quot; ; speaking_of its political effects , fellow demographer Michael S . Teitelbaum has rightly called it a revolution . The ultimate question posed by runaway population growth is : Can planet Earth sustain a human population that is growing this fast or will growth destroy the very conditions that support human existence ? If unchecked growth indeed promises doomsday , then the human_race will survive only by framing , in time , a political defense against itself . ANSWERS CANNOT BE FOUND IN THE U.S. ALONE The habitat question becomes more concrete amid the warnings raised by many scientists about global damage caused by industrialization . They say industrialization is depleting the Earth ' s protective ozone_layer and fostering a warming that could bring devastating climate change . In an interview conducted for The Times , Ehrlich noted that even if China over the years only doubles its fossil_fuel consumption ( a grossly optimistic estimate ) , it will pump more carbon_dioxide ( which causes global warming ) into the air than could be compensated for if the United States cut its own consumption by 25 % . If India at its present size ( leaving further growth aside ) matches even China ' s current energy use , then an amount of carbon_dioxide will be added_to the environment that could not be compensated for even by a total halt to U.S. coal use . Changing U.S. consumption habits alone , however desirable , evidently cannot be the political answer . More important , Ehrlich suggests , could be a dramatic U.S. shift away from fossil_fuels , proving to China , India and the rest of the world that there are environment-preserving energy alternatives . En route to the ultimate , survivability question , a number of more immediate problems like these -- precursor problems , if you will -- present themselves . TRYING TO GET AHEAD CAN LEAVE YOU FAR BEHIND One of them might be called anti-development , or the often documented collapse of prosperity built_on non-renewable ( or unrenewed ) natural_resources . Lester Brown , president of the MIT-based Worldwatch Institute , notes that the Ivory_Coast was briefly a model for Third_World development , earning huge sums from the sale of tropical hardwoods . Unfortunately , when the last trees were gone from the West_African nation -- in a dizzying and ultimately self-defeating process of wood export encouraged by none other_than the World_Bank -- the economy collapsed : Per capita income is now half what it was in 1980 . Obviously , if fewer people had been making a living from the sale of the wood , this resource would have lasted longer . Almost anywhere , production can be overwhelmed by consumption . In high-fertility countries , children often constitute nearly half the population . Although the Islamic Revolution deserves blame for failing to bring wise economic stewardship to Iran , in good_part that country ' s collapsing prosperity must be attributed to the fact that its population has doubled since the shah was overthrown in the 1970s . Worldwatch ' s Brown blames some of the recent violence in Rwanda on poverty induced by a tripling of the population since 1950 . Haiti , to name a third example , already grossly overpopulated , is expected to double in population in the next 18 years . In more prosperous countries , the growth of the world ' s population tends to manifest itself in the relatively bearable form of rising prices . In the poorest , most crowded countries , the same phenomenon can mean starvation . In interviews conducted for this series of editorials with many experts around the United States , global food shortages were repeatedly mentioned as future crisis points . Sometimes even the successes of industrialization contribute to those shortages . Thus , China ' s galloping industrialization is steadily shrinking its stock of arable land . But China ' s industrialization is also increasing its supply of hard currency . &quot; The bottom_line , &quot; Brown wrote earlier this year in The Times , &quot; is that when China turns_to world markets on an ongoing basis , its food scarcity will become the world ' s scarcity ; its shortages of cropland and water will become the world ' s shortages. &quot; The interconnectedness of various population-driven problems is coming_into steadily sharper focus . Rural population growth combined with the industrialization of agriculture sends the rural population streaming toward the cities , creating in high-fertility countries megalopolises like Mexico_City , which has grown from 1.6 million in 1940 to 18 million today . Secondary displacement then often sends these internal refugees across international borders . Just as China ' s food shortages become the world ' s shortages , so the Third_World ' s population surplus threatens to become , by migration , the world ' s population surplus . Most major industrialized countries , their own populations now stable , have sought by strict immigration laws to prevent Third_World overpopulation from becoming their overpopulation . &quot; Must It Be the West Against the Rest ? &quot; asks a headline for Matthew Connelly and Paul Kennedy ' s cover story in the December issue of Atlantic Monthly . Yes , these countries unapologetically reply , correlating immigration with labor needs and social stability . The United States is the great exception in this regard , with extremely high levels of legal immigration , virtually all_of it from the Third_World , and with a unique family reunification policy that makes immigration quotas virtually unenforceable . Reversing the trend of the other developed countries , U.S. population is expected to grow 22 % by 2025 , with immigration accounting_for most of the increase . U.S. immigration law makes the world population crisis , to a unique extent , a factor_in Washington ' s national as well as its international population policy . In the 1960s and 1970s , the United States tried hard to place the problem of runaway population growth on the world agenda . Perhaps the most important vehicle for this effort was the U.N. Fund for Population Activities , begun at the instigation of President Richard Nixon and for years largely U.S.-funded. The Reagan_Administration , however , brought U.S. participation in the fund to a halt and otherwise terminated U.S. support for world population_control in deference to domestic reproductive politics . The Bush_Administration continued this disengagement . CHALLENGES TO AMERICAN LEADERSHIP ON POPULATION The Clinton_Administration , in its first two years , returned the United States to a semblance of its earlier leadership role . Former Sen . Tim Wirth , in the newly created State_Department post of undersecretary for global affairs , played a leading role at last September ' s U.N. Conference on Population and Development . During the next two years , however , the Clinton_Administration will find its return to leadership challenged in two important regards . First , it will face -- in the form of the suddenly explosive immigration question -- a national population question matching the world population question . As U.S. voters gradually recognize that the two are linked , the Immigration Act of 1965 , America ' s basic law on the_matter , will come_into sharp question ; and it may fall to President Clinton to propose a revision . Second , the new Republican majorities in Congress may take their cue from Ronald Reagan rather than from Nixon . In that case , they may force the Clinton_Administration to withdraw from the forums where the world population crisis is addressed . But overpopulation cannot be addressed without discussing birth_control , family size , women ' s reproductive rights and kindred domestically sensitive &quot; family values &quot; matters . U.S. abortion politics and other reproductive politics did not deter Nixon -- they did deter Reagan -- from seeking a leadership role for the United States . So far , the new Republican majorities seem more Reaganite than Nixonian , but essentially they have yet to weigh in on either population question . A DREADFUL CORRECTION MAY STAND ON THE HORIZON There is a brutal simplicity about population growth . Birthrates are accelerating , death rates decelerating . With political leadership that takes the long view , there is a chance that a recent , slight but historically significant slowing of the world birthrate may be fostered and intensified . Without such leadership , alas , the correction surely will come_in another form : mass death . To a point , we have been there before . Famine reduced the_Irish population from 8.5 million to 4.5 million between 1840 and 1900 . The Black_Death reduced Europe ' s by 25 % during the 14th Century . If AIDS is not the Black_Death of our era , environmentally induced devastation may be . The choice , in the end , is all too clear . We can only hope that our political_leaders and those of the rest of the world will recognize in time that they must make a choice . Next Sunday : Final thoughts in this series about new departures for U.S. foreign_policy .</TEXT>
