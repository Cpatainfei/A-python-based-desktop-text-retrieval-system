   <HEADLINE> IN THE KITCHEN ; GREEN LASAGNA : YOU HAD TO BE THERE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Right up front , I ' ll be honest about this dish : When we ran it through The Times Test Kitchen , no one liked it . It ' s not that they hated it , it ' s just that they weren ' t crazy about it . So why should you waste your time trying it ? Because I ' m digging in my heels on this one . I ' m right and they ' re wrong . It ' s good . That settles it . It ' s not that I don ' t understand what everyone else was talking_about . I can see how tasting this dish , eating_in a rush , standing by the sink , waiting for the next thing to come_out , you might not appreciate its full worth . In this setting , the food that wins is the kind that jumps up and down and waves its arms at you , not the one that quietly charms you . I ' m firmly convinced that some dishes , like some buildings , are site-specific . Within their proper context they are absolutely wonderful . Take them out of that situation , though , and you think what-the-heck ? Or worse . There is something monumental about pueblo-style architecture , the sinuous way the building ' s curves fit the stark , sere surrounding mountains . But one of the silliest buildings I ever saw was an adobe in Malibu . * So let ' s talk_about where this dish comes from . I served it one night after a good strong spring rain . It was the turn of the season , those days when Southern California changes from roasted golden brown to a rich and shimmering shade of green . Sometimes there seems to be so_much chlorophyll in the air you can taste it . But , of course , you can ' t . So I figure , if you can ' t eat green , you can eat greens . I am a big fan of greens . Mustard , chard , kale or collard -- I like them sauteed with olive_oil ; I like them boiled with fatback . I like greens stirred in risotto and cooked in vegetable_soup . Serve them with cornbread or crostini and I ' m happy . When I finally came_in out of the rain after spending the morning working in the yard , I was thinking green thoughts . Which led , inevitably , to dinner . What I settled_on was this lasagna . Lasagna has a reputation for being a bruiser of a dish with heavy layers of noodles , thick tomato_sauce , browned meat and lots of melted cheese . But this version is a kind of springtime compromise . It has some of my favorite things about heavy lasagna -- the warm goosh of ricotta and the molten pull of mozzarella -- but it ' s different . * In this case , the mozzarella and ricotta are shot through_with garlicky greens and earthy mushrooms instead of beef . And to keep it even lighter ( or maybe just because I ' d just been out trimming the tree and had plenty of fruit available ) , I flavored the ricotta fairly strongly with lemon . The lemon , garlic and greens worked very well together , in a quiet kind of way . Because this is not a big brass_band of a lasagna , the fresh pasta is essential here . Normally , I ' m a dried-noodle kind of guy -- after a_couple_of years of making all my pasta fresh , I long ago came_to embrace the convenience ( and taste ) of good-quality dried . Granted , dried pasta has a flavor and texture different from fresh , but I find it works especially well with the kind of quick-cooked sauces I normally make . It ' s difficult for me to figure aglio e olio on fresh pasta . By the same token , in the case of an understated filling like this one , nothing but fresh will do . In the end , this lasagna is about textures and shadings of flavors . The soft architecture of fresh pasta seems the only thing that is appropriate to support this filling . So go_ahead and try it -- all_the better if you can make_it on some cool spring night when it has just rained and green is the only color you taste . LASAGNA OF GREENS AND LEMON 1 bunch Swiss_chard , rinsed , trimmed and chopped 1 bunch mustard greens , rinsed , thick stems trimmed and chopped 1 bunch kale , rinsed , trimmed and chopped 2 cloves garlic , minced Juice 1 lemon Salt Freshly ground pepper 1 / 2 pound brown mushrooms , rinsed , trimmed and quartered 1 pound ricotta cheese 1 / 2 cup fresh goat_cheese Zest 1 lemon Fresh Pasta 1 1 / 2 cups tomato puree 1 / 2 pound mozzarella , shredded In large saute pan or wok , stir-fry chard , mustard greens and kale just with water clinging_to leaves after rinsing . After greens have cooked 3 to 5 minutes , add garlic and cook until all greens are tender , about 10 minutes , stirring frequently to keep_from scorching . Add 1 / 2 of lemon_juice and stir until all moisture is re-absorbed . Season to taste with salt and pepper . Heat non-stick saute pan over high heat . When very hot , add mushrooms and cook , tossing and stirring constantly , until browned . Add_to greens and allow to cool completely . Mixture should be completely dry . In large mixing_bowl , combine ricotta , goat_cheese and lemon_zest . Add remaining 1 / 2 of lemon_juice and stir to combine . When greens are completely cool , add_to cheese mixture and stir well . Season to taste with salt . After Fresh Pasta has been made , assemble lasagna . Spread bottom and sides of glass baking pan with 3 / 4 cup of tomato puree . Cook pasta in pot of boiling water . Drain . Then lay 1 sheet of pasta in bottom of pan . It should cover bottom completely . Spread 1 / 2 of cheese mixture over pasta sheet . Sprinkle 1 / 3 of mozzarella over top . Repeat layering once more , finishing with third sheet of pasta . Spread remaining tomato puree over top and sprinkle with remaining mozzarella . Bake at 300 degrees 30 to 45 minutes , until heated through . Makes 6 servings . Each serving contains about : 364 calories ; 294 mg sodium ; 110 mg cholesterol ; 15 grams fat ; 41 grams carbohydrates ; 21 grams protein ; 2.18 grams fiber . Fresh Pasta 1 1 / 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 eggs Place flour in work bowl of food_processor fitted with steel blade . Add eggs and process until dough comes_together and forms ball that rides around on top of blade . If mixture is too dry and fails to form ball , slowly add just enough water to bring ball together , no more_than 1 tablespoon . Dough ball should be slightly sticky . If too sticky and soft , add flour 1 teaspoon at time until texture is correct . Knead dough by running processor . Ball will ride around on top of blade , becoming more and more smooth . When smooth enough , remove from processor . Wrap in plastic_wrap . Let stand at least 45 minutes . Roll dough out_in pasta machine . Divide in quarters and work with 1 portion at time , keeping remainder wrapped in plastic_wrap . Flatten dough , then run_through machine on widest setting . Fold double and run_through again , folded edge first . Repeat 2 or 3 times . Fold double again , and run_through sideways . Repeat 2 or 3 more times . Dough will change from fairly sticky and possibly slightly dimpled on 1 side to satiny and smooth . Sheet should be as wide as baking dish ( if not , layer dish with 2 sheets rather than 1 ) . Change pasta machine to next narrower setting . Run dough through machine once . Repeat until next-to-last setting . Before rolling_out at next-to-last setting , cut pasta sheet in half . After rolling_out at next-to-last setting , lay pasta sheet on lightly floured dish_towel and cover with another dish_towel . Repeat until all dough has been rolled_out .</TEXT>
