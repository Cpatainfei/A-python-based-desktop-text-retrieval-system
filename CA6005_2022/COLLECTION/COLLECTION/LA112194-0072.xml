   <TEXT> YEAH , BUT YOU CAN GET A REALLY GOOD SLURPEE THERE The Cowboys were sending_out an SOS after they lost quarterbacks Troy Aikman ( knee ) and Rodney Peete ( thumb ) and finished their 31-7 victory over Washington with third-stringer Jason Garrett . &quot; We ' ve got_to find us a quarterback , &quot; said Coach Barry Switzer . &quot; There ' s none at the 7-11 . But we have to find somebody . &quot; We can ' t rack the table and quit . We still have to play the last five balls. &quot; Owner Jerry Jones said the Cowboys will &quot; go_with what we got &quot; in their next game , on Thursday , and start searching next week . But they can ' t be extravagant . They ' re only $ 40 # 000 under the salary cap . The Redskins also used three quarterbacks in the game -- Gus Frerotte , John Friesz and Heath Shuler . &quot; All I know , six quarterbacks in one game has to be an NFL first , &quot; Switzer said . &quot; It at least ties a record. &quot; TELL US WHAT YOU REALLY THINK After being sacked twice and throwing an incomplete , fourth-down pass with time running_out in a 12-6 loss to the Arizona Cardinals , Philadelphia Eagle quarterback Randall Cunningham was thoroughly disgusted with the day ' s events . &quot; The way we played , we can ' t beat anybody , &quot; Cunningham said . &quot; We couldn ' t beat a Pop Warner squad. &quot; MISSING : VIKING PASS DEFENSE Last week , the Minnesota Vikings allowed New England ' s Drew Bledsoe to set NFL records with 45 completions and 70 attempts . On Sunday , the New York Jets ' Boomer Esiason picked_apart the Vikings for 22 completions in 29 attempts . He threw three touchdowns , and was not intercepted . That was the second consecutive week the Vikings couldn ' t intercept a pass , and they were unhappy . &quot; It ' s not what we ' re doing different now , it ' s what teams are doing differently against us , &quot; cornerback Anthony Parker said . &quot; We have to have our leadership step_up and we need to make some big plays. &quot; IT COULD HAVE BEEN A DISASTER Seattle defeated Tampa Bay on a seven-yard touchdown run_by Mack Strong with 42 seconds left . Seahawk offensive coordinator Larry Kennan , with no timeouts remaining , caught the Buccaneers sleeping . They were expecting a pass . Said Coach Tom Flores : &quot; Larry called the play and I said , ' Wait a minute. ' But then I thought if we got outside the pass rush , only defensive backs would be left. &quot; AN EXPENSIVE LESSON We know they do things big in Texas . But sometimes , they go a bit overboard . The Cowboys , who were fined $ 10 # 000 by the league for failing to report Troy Aikman ' s thumb injury prior to last week ' s game against San Francisco , complied with the letter of the law this week . They issued a post-game injury report that included 15 names : Aikman ( sprained medial collateral ligament in his left knee ) , Peete ( sprained right thumb ) , cornerback Larry Brown ( left elbow contusion ) , linebacker Dixon Edwards ( sprained right foot ) , defensive end Charles Haley ( sprained right big_toe ) , wide receiver Alvin Harper ( bruised lower back ) , defensive tackle Chad Hennings ( sprained right ankle ) , wide receiver Michael Irvin ( sprained right quad ) , guard Derek Kennard ( reaggravated sprained right big_toe ) , guard Nate Newton ( reaggravated sprained ankle ) , linebacker Godfrey Myles ( sprained right knee ) , linebacker Darrin Smith ( left calf contusion ) , running back Emmitt Smith ( reaggravated left shoulder sprain ) , cornerback Kevin Smith ( reaggravated sprained right Achilles_tendon ) and guard Ron Stone ( sprained right elbow ) . TONIGHT ' S GAME : N.Y. Giants at Houston 6 p.m. , Channel 7 The Giants ( 3-7 ) have lost seven consecutive games and the Oilers have lost six . The Oilers are 1-9 , but with the exception of last week , the losses have rarely been the fault of the defense . That is why defensive coordinator Jeff Fisher was elevated to head coach to replace the fired Jack Pardee . Offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride was also fired , so the run-and-shoot offense will be scrapped except for when the team is way behind . Chances are you ' ll still see a lot of it . Billy Joe Tolliver has been named the starting quarterback after directing the Oilers to their best offensive showing this season last week . He completed 20 of 34 passes for 142 yards and the Oilers scored a season-high 31 points . The problem was that the Bengals -- a team nickname usually preceded by the word hapless -- scored 33 points against the Oilers . Quarterback Dave Brown returns to the starting lineup for the Giants after Kent Graham ' s dismal debut , He completed nine of 26 passes for 92 yards and an interception in a 10-9 loss to the Arizona Cardinals . The Giants need to establish the running game to help their young quarterback , but everyone knows that , so opposing defenses stack the line to stop the run and dare the Giants to throw . So far that strategy has worked . NOTEWORTHY Block party : Green_Bay kicker Chris Jacke had an extra-point blocked for the first time in his six-year career . . . . Buffalo wide receiver Billy Brooks made the 500th reception of his career , moving_into 39th place on the NFL list . . . . He coaches better on a full stomach : In his six seasons , Detroit Coach Wayne Fontes is 24-32 in games played before Thanksgiving and 18-12 from Thanksgiving on . . . . Catchy leader : With 55 points , Herman Moore leads the Lions in scoring ; the last Detroit receiver to pace the team in scoring for a season was Bill Gabrell in 1968 . . . . There ' s no place like , uh , never mind : The Indianapolis Colts are having remarkable success at Cincinnati ' s Riverfront Stadium , where they haven ' t lost since 1980 . Their only recent year without a victory at Riverfront was 1991 , when the teams didn ' t play each other . . . . Kevin Williams ' 83-yard punt return for a touchdown was the fourth-longest in Cowboy history . . . . Brian Mitchell established a Redskin single-season record with 1 # 192 yards in kickoff returns . Mitchell also had 229 all-purpose yards , giving him a club-record 1 # 873 for the season . . . . The Cowboys have won 13 consecutive against the NFC East . The last time they lost to a division rival was the 1993 season opener to the Redskins , 35-16 . . . . Dallas has met Washington 70 times in the Cowboys ' 35-year history , the most games the Cowboys have played against any team . Dallas improved its overall record against Washington to 39-29-2 . . . . Mike Tomczak ' s 343 passing yards were a Steeler high since Neil O ' Donnell ' s 355 yards at Cleveland on Oct . 24 , 1993 . . . . Running in place : The 37 rushing yards were a season-low for Miami . . . . The four sacks by Pittsburgh were the most by a Miami opponent since the New York Jets also had four on Sept . 12 , 1993 . . . . Dan Marino , sacked only 10 times previously in 10 games , has never been sacked more_than five times . He has been sacked 174 times in 165 career starts . Marino has 21 touchdown passes , but only four with six interceptions in his last four games . . . . The Steeler defense has allowed a league-low 13 touchdowns . . . . Miami has scored only 12 points in the first_quarter all season . . . . Passing grade : Drew Bledsoe set Patriot records of 285 completions and 507 pass attempts in one season . The previous marks were 276 completions by Tony Eason in 1986 and 473 attempts by Babe Parilli in 1964 . . . . New York Jet receiver Art Monk extended his streak of consecutive games with a catch to 174 . Monk is chasing Steve Largent ' s record of 177 games . . . . Moon rise : Minnesota quarterback Warren Moon ' s two touchdown passes gave him 210 , moving him into 14th place on the all-time list , one ahead of Jim Hart . Moon ' s 400 yards also made him the first Minnesota quarterback to have two 400-yard games in a season . UPON FURTHER REVIEW . . . NBC commentator Paul Maguire was irate about the officiating down the stretch of Denver ' s 20-13 victory over Cleveland . A fumble by the Browns kept two questionable fourth-down pass-interference calls against Kansas City from affecting the outcome . Maguire was also incensed by an intentional-grounding call against Cleveland quarterback Mark Rypien on a play_on which he was hit before letting the ball go . The referees made 24 calls_in that game , 15 against the Browns . Probably the day ' s most critical mistake by officials was made in Miami ' s 16-13 overtime loss to Pittsburgh . During the overtime , the Dolphins faced a third and 19 at the Steeler 47 , when an apparent completion to O.J. McDuffie inside the 20 squirted loose after he hit the ground . The Steelers recovered and argued it was a fumble ; the Dolphins said McDuffie was down on contact . The officials called it incomplete , although TV replays showed McDuffie taking several steps before striking the turf . &quot; It was definitely a completed pass , &quot; McDuffie said . &quot; Even if the ball came_out , it wasn ' t a fumble . That was a completed pass. &quot; The Dolphins ended_up punting , and the Steelers drove downfield and kicked the winning field_goal . . . . . WE LOVED INSTANT REPLAY The San Diego Chargers trailed the New Patriots , 10-3 , when they apparently were victimized by the officials . The Chargers ' Dennis Gibson intercepted a pass_by Drew Bledsoe at the New England 35 . But linebacker Junior Seau was called_for roughing the passer , although replays indicated he swatted his right arm at Bledsoe ' s helmet but never touched him . &quot; He swung a roundhouse with an open hand , in my judgment , and hit the side of the quarterback ' s head , &quot; referee Gordon McCarter said . A HEAD COACH WITHOUT A BIG HEAD New Oiler Coach Jeff Fisher , who makes his debut tonight , has been called &quot; Buddy Ryan without the ego. &quot; His friends and colleagues agree . &quot; I think that describes Jeff pretty well . He has his ego in check , &quot; San Francisco General_Manager Carmen Policy said of Fisher , who was the 49ers ' defensive backs coach before going_to Houston to become the defensive coordinator . He was promoted to head coach last week when Jack Pardee was fired . Said USC Coach John Robinson : &quot; I knew Jeff as a player , and I ' ve known him as a coach . He has always had that sparkle in his eyes . Even back in college , Jeff had the look of a guy who was going_to be a leader of men . He knew what he wanted to do . I think giving this job to Jeff is a great call by the Oilers. &quot; INJURY REPORT The Arizona Cardinals lost two offensive starters in three plays against the Philadelphia Eagles . On the second play of the second quarter , Cardinal left tackle Luis Sharpe injured ligaments in his right knee when an Eagle player rolled_over it as Sharpe was blocking for running back Ronald Moore . Two snaps later , wide receiver Randal Hill pulled a muscle . The Bills ' Thurman Thomas bruised his left knee and offensive lineman Corbin Lacina injured his left foot . . . . The Packers ' Reggie White sprained his left elbow making a tackle . Also injured were Tim Hauck , who sprained a knee , defensive lineman John Jurkovic , who injured his right leg in the fourth quarter , and wide receiver Anthony Morgan , who suffered a concussion . Dolphin linebacker Chris Singleton injured his ankle . . . . Steeler defensive end Gerald Williams tore a tricep and guard Todd Kalis left in the fourth quarter with a sprained ankle . . . . Seahawk tailback Chris Warren injured his right hip after gaining 116 yards on 16 carries . The Seahawks also lost starting cornerback Carlton Gray , who broke his right forearm .</TEXT>
