   <HEADLINE> ENVIRONMENT ; APPLIANCES THAT WORK BETTER , CLEANER , CHEAPER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Advancing technology has produced a whole range of improved products that save energy in your home . If you take_advantage of them , your family can live better , cleaner and cheaper . Consider these options : Appliances Because they run 24 hours a day , refrigerators use_up to 20 % of household electricity . Also , manufacturers have long relied_on ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) for both coolants and in the making of insulation for refrigerator doors and walls . But help is_on the way . Another appliance with a major environmental impact is the washing machine . Consider purchasing a top-loader model , which requires about a third less water than the average front loader . If you wash eight loads a week , it will save_up to 500 gallons of water a month . Windows If your home had simple double-pane windows 20 years ago , you were among the vanguard of the environmentally conscious . But today , even untreated triple panes aren ' t the best . Look_for low-emissivity windows with a special coating that blocks heat from escaping . Or try new super windows , which use thin HeatMirror films as heat_barriers . They are three times more effective than triple-pane glass alone . Toilets About half of the water washing_down household drains annually in this country passes_through toilets . These thirsty fixtures average about five gallons per flush . Do streams and rivers a favor by switching to 1.6-gallon-per-flush models , which are becoming the mandated standard for new housing . Lights Fluorescents require much less electricity to operate than the typical incandescent bulbs . For instance , a 75-watt incandescent can be replaced by an 18-watt compact fluorescent . Not only will fluorescents save energy , they last seven times longer . Heating Today , many furnaces achieve 90 % efficiency or better . Other recent advances include improved heat-recovery ventilation_systems to keep heat in the house , better insulation techniques and refined passive solar designs .</TEXT>
