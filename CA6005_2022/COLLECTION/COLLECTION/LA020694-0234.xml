   <HEADLINE> WINTER OLYMPIC WONDERLAND ; SNOW , READINESS AND PRICES ARE HIGH IN LILLEHAMMER LESS THAN A WEEK FROM OPENING CEREMONY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As members of Lillehammer ' s bid committee waited in the garden of a Seoul hotel in the summer of 1988 for International Olympic Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch to read the name of the city that would organize the 1994 Winter Games , their leader , Petter Roenningen , was nine time_zones away . The banker thought little more of Lillehammer ' s chances than he had when he first suggested the idea to other town leaders in 1977 . &quot; It was just a joke , &quot; he said . Even Crown_Prince Harald , who is now Norway ' s king , called it a &quot; wild idea. &quot; Roenningen and his colleagues , however , made enough of an impression during their first bid , for the 1992 Winter_Olympics that were awarded to Albertville , France , that the IOC encouraged them to return . In Korea , they again expected to win the prize for congeniality and nothing more . On the night before the IOC ' s vote , in a party for the bid committees from Oestersund , Sweden ; Sofia , Bulgaria ; Anchorage , Alaska , and Lillehammer , the Norwegians were easy to pick_out of the crowd because they were the most carefree , sporting red noses to match their red blazers after numerous toasts to their Swedish neighbors . Oestersund was the favorite , so_much so that Samaranch was overheard the next afternoon , before receiving the sealed envelope with the results of the voting , practicing the pronunciation of the name . By then , Roenningen was back home . He figured it would be considerably more fruitful to be in Lillehammer for the opening of the hunting_season than to be in Seoul to commiserate with the other losers . Other members of the bid committee were no more optimistic , which is why they sat for several moments in stunned silence when Samaranch , without practice , mispronounced the name of the winner as &quot; Lilly-hammer , &quot; instead of the correct Lill-uh-hammer . Listening on his car radio , Roenningen was so shocked he almost drove_off the street , which minutes later was filled with virtually all_of the 23 # 000 citizens of Lillehammer , the smallest city other_than Lake Placid , N.Y. , to become an official Olympic host . The national drink , aquavit , flowed for 48 hours before the people sobered_up to the challenge ahead of them . The Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee ( LOOC ) sought to inspire confidence , adopting the slogan , &quot; They Said It Couldn ' t Be Done , but we ' ll Do It. &quot; When some Norwegians complained that all that did was advertise their insecurities to the rest of the world , the slogan was abbreviated , &quot; we ' ll Do It. &quot; Today , as the digital calendar in LOOC headquarters counting_down the days until next Saturday ' s opening ceremony reaches 6 , it appears as if they were right . Storefronts on the picturesque main_street , Storgata , are made_up like a debutante at her coming-out party . State-of-the-art venues have seals_of_approval , not only from athletes but also from architects and environmentalists . Sewers have been upgraded , roads widened and trains and buses added_to accommodate the estimated 100 # 000 persons who will visit here during each of the 16 days of the Olympics . Most of them will stay 110 miles to the south , in Oslo , because there are only 3 # 100 hotel beds in the region . Even the weather has gotten_into the spirit . For five years , no self-respecting snowman would be found in Lillehammer , a condition so worrisome to organizers of the ski competitions that they enlisted the aid of snow-making cannons . But so_much snow has fallen this winter that 7 # 000 truckloads are being carted out each day . Enough is still standing -- more_than nine feet in places -- that fences built to separate spectators from competitors at some outdoor venues have been buried . As evidenced by the 3 # 000 miles of cross-country_skiing courses in the region , and the fact that Lillehammer is the world ' s only known city with a skier in its coat of arms , those who live here enjoy snow . But this is too_much of a good thing . Like a scene out of the television_show &quot; Northern Exposure , &quot; a moose in search of food was spotted two weeks ago on Storgata , and elk have abandoned the pine forests for more open spaces . People have had to forage through their basements for standing sleds , called spark s , that enable them to travel through the snow quickly and safely . But despite the inconvenience , they understand that they are helping to create a favorable ambience . The Lillehammer that will be seen on television throughout the world is a winter wonderland , and that was the image the town leaders had hoped to sell when they bid for the Winter_Olympics . A stopover on the King ' s Road between Oslo and Trondheim during the Middle_Ages , Lillehammer was a commercial crossroads for centuries , then a market_town that attracted the region ' s farmers , who were immortalized in Henrik Ibsen ' s &quot; Peer Gynt. &quot; The road to prosperity in the modern ages , however , is lined with tourist dollars , and Lillehammer found itself losing to Norway ' s fiords . Located at the north end of Lake Mjosa , Norway ' s largest body of fresh_water , Lillehammer became popular among Scandinavians for summer vacations . But the city also aspired to be recognized for its winter beauty , which has been captured for years by native artists , whose landscapes show_off snow-covered rolling hillsides and an ethereal , pastel-shaded light . To become a winter resort today , though , requires not rolling hillsides but mountains , and although there are a couple near here , they were not developed , even after Norwegians caught Alpine skiing fever in the 1970s . Before then , only cross-country was considered true skiing . To catch_up , town leaders knew they needed the impetus of the Olympics . But to get the Olympics , they needed slopes . To their credit , they were able to convince the IOC that they could create mountains out of molehills . That , however , was not the decisive_factor in Lillehammer ' s favor . Numerous reasons for the IOC ' s vote have been advanced , including an outrageous one involving Eastern Bloc pique over Swedish treatment of Soviet submarines , but it was probably tradition that carried the day . Although 4 # 000-year-old rock carvings depicting men on skis have been discovered north of here , allowing Norway to proclaim itself &quot; the cradle of skiing , &quot; and its athletes have dominated competition in Nordic sports for decades , the IOC was sensitive to the fact that the only time the country has served as host of the Winter Games was in 1952 at Oslo . The IOC also was impressed by Lillehammer ' s plan for an Olympics that would be inexpensive and compact , neither of which materialized . &quot; When we got the Games , all_the cities that hadn ' t offered a single Norwegian_kroner for the bid wanted a piece of the cake , &quot; Roenningen said . As a result , the federal_government decreed that Lillehammer would share venues with the entire valley , which covers 72 miles and includes two larger cities , Hamar and Gjovik , each of which has a population of about 26 # 000 . On the region ' s primary highway , a two-lane farm-to-market road that is often icy and always congested with trucks , travel is tedious . The federal_government also responded to pressure from environmentalists , insisting that organizers stage the greenest Games ever . The site of the speedskating venue in Hamar was altered to leave a bird_sanctuary undisturbed ; a hockey rink in Gjovik was constructed inside a mountain , and fines of up_to $ 10 # 000 were assessed for cutting_down trees unnecessarily . Suspecting that ski resorts in other parts of Norway were siding with environmentalists in an attempt to prevent one from being built_in his city , the mayor of Ringebu , site of much of the Alpine skiing , pulled the cord on the chain saw that brought_down the first tree there . In the subsequent election , his opponent labeled him &quot; the Chopper of Ringebu. &quot; The mayor kept his job , but other politicians in the region who fought the environmentalists did not . A poll in Norway revealed that 67 % of the people considered protecting the environment the number_one aim of the Olympics . In return for its interference , the federal_government picked_up most of the tab for the $ 1.05-billion budget , which is four times higher than originally projected . The people here have not complained about the expense , perhaps because they expect to get rich . Tourists complain about the high prices , such_as $ 8 glasses of beer , $ 3 cups of coffee and $ 600 hotel_rooms . Government officials , pointing_out that Norway is one of the world ' s most expensive countries , report that they have found few instances of price-gouging , but LOOC ' s president , Gerhard Heiberg , warned : &quot; Prices are too high . These people are cutting_off the branch they are sitting on. &quot; Heiberg , however , predicted that these Olympics will be remembered as the best ever &quot; just out of the sheer joy of our people. &quot; That might not be apparent to visitors because of the stereotypical Norwegian stoicism . A local businessman donated $ 70 # 000 to send merchants from the region to a charm school , which included a course in smiling . Only six enrolled .
