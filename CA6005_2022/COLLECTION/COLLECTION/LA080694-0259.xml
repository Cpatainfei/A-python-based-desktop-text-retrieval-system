   <HEADLINE> IRVINE CO.-EL TORO SWAP GAINS ; CONVERSION : SUPPORT SWELLS FOR PROPOSED LAND DEAL THAT WOULD GIVE DEVELOPER CONTROL OF BASE -- AND OPENING TO BUILD AN AIRPORT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With stunning consensus , environmental and political support swelled Friday for an enormous land swap that would give the Irvine Co . control of El Toro Marines Corp Air_Station , amid growing speculation that the developer wants to build a commercial airport there . Irvine Co . officials pledged , however , that the real_estate giant is &quot; absolutely neutral &quot; on whether the base would become a commercial airport under the proposed land exchange that would give the federal_government thousands of acres of environmentally sensitive land near the Cleveland National Forest , including the areas of Weir and Gypsum canyons . The land-exchange idea , first proposed by local environmental groups to the U.S. Department_of_the_Interior months ago as a way to preserve sensitive open space , is rapidly winning favor countywide as a way to spur a planning and development process mired in political controversy . &quot; I ' d always hoped that we could do the best for the county ; maybe now I ' ll get my wish , &quot; said Thomas F . Riley , chairman of the Orange County Board of Supervisors . Although there seemed to be widespread support Friday for pursuing the land-exchange concept , some cautioned local leaders against moving too fast . Some South County officials , for instance , said they will insist on a voice in any El Toro development -- no matter who owns it . In addition , Interior officials -- and the Irvine Co . itself -- stressed that they are a long way from an agreement and pointed_out that such a pact might take years to clear a series of legal and governmental hurdles . For more_than a year , the Marine base has been at the center of a raging debate over how the 4 # 700-acre property should be converted to civilian use when it closes by 1999 . And until now , the Irvine Co . has remained silent in the controversy which has literally divided the county , pitting airport proponents in the north against those in South County who are seeking an alternate development plan . But by Friday , there was general_agreement within the business and government communities that a successful land swap with the Interior_Department would almost certainly favor the creation of a new commercial airport . Local developer Buck Johns , who is leading a November ballot measure to win approval for a future airport at the base , said the influential Irvine Co. ' s joining the fray could only help his cause . &quot; You have to stand_back and ask what would enhance the value of the property already owned by the Irvine Co . around the airport , &quot; Johns said . &quot; The answer to that is an airport. &quot; While acknowledging their interest in the land-exchange idea , Irvine Co . executives said Friday they were &quot; absolutely neutral &quot; on the question of airport development should they gain control of the base . However , one federal_official familiar_with the discussions said he believed the Irvine Co . was interested in_using the property as a commercial airport . &quot; I believe that ' s what they had_in_mind , &quot; the official said . &quot; Every time we started going_down that route ( talks_about a possible airport site ) , I said , ' Stop . No . that ' s for somebody else to decide. ' &quot; The Irvine Co . has continued to describe its discussions with the Interior_Department as &quot; conceptual , &quot; but federal_officials confirmed Friday that similar deals have been reached in other parts of the nation where military bases have been scheduled for closure . &quot; What ' s gained is long-term conservation for the county and open space for residents in exchange for the development of an area that is already developed , &quot; said Jay Ziegler , the spokesman for the Interior_Department and one of several federal_officials who visited Orange County to look over the base . If such a deal could be worked_out , officials said , all three entities would gain : the Marines could get_out of El Toro more quickly ; the Irvine Co . would get some valuable Orange County property and the Interior_Department would secure another parcel_of_land it considers crucial to the endangered gnatcatcher ' s survival near the Cleveland National Forest . Gary Hunt , Irvine Co . executive_vice_president of corporate and legal affairs , said the talks have not yet determined how much of the base could be obtained or exactly what parcels the Interior_Department would like in exchange . &quot; All of this has been promoted by the environmental community , &quot; he said . Hunt estimated that such a deal could take two years to complete but cautioned that the company had not made any commitment to a proposal . &quot; Obviously , there are a lot of environmentally sensitive lands in the north , and if those can be preserved by the government that would be a positive thing , &quot; he said . Connie Spenger , president of Friends of Tecate Cypress , said the environmental group has been working with the Sierra Club , the Tri-County Conservation League , Wilderness Society and other organizations to push the land swap . Last month , Spenger said , her group sent a letter to the Irvine Co . proposing the swap and spelling_out the benefits . In subsequent discussions , the group suggested trading a 10 # 000-acre swath of terrain in the Santa Ana Mountains , next to the Cleveland National Forest , for a portion of the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station . The Santa Ana Mountains terrain features a mix of rare Tecate cypress , oak woodlands and coastal sage . It is also home to numerous species of wildlife , including prairie falcons . There is also a rare golden_eagle nesting site within the area . In return for the wilderness property , the group proposed that the Irvine Co . acquire 3 # 500 acres of the 4 # 700-acre base . The remaining 1 # 200 acres is sensitive bird habitat that environmentalists hope will remain open space . &quot; I think this trade is a good possibility , &quot; Spenger said . &quot; I think it ' s something many people in Orange County want . They ' d rather have an environmental benefit come_out of the base closure. &quot; While local environmentalists are being credited with pushing the land-swap arrangement , the idea stems from a concept Interior officials have been working_on for about six months : the trading of bases that are destined to be closed for environmentally sensitive land that would otherwise be developed . The bases -- scores of which are now being abandoned -- would be turned_over to private companies for development in exchange for land that Interior believes would be_better preserved . One example of such an arrangement in process is at March Air_Force Base in Riverside , where Interior officials are working to swap 2 # 000 acres on the base that is low-grade habitat for the Stephens kangaroo_rat in exchange for a higher-grade habitat off base that would be preserved . Ziegler said federal and state_government officials have begun to identify areas in Orange and San Diego counties for preservation that are gnatcatcher habitats . Those reserves are still under design , but the Irvine Co . has substantial holdings in some gnatcatcher territory , including the area bordering the Cleveland National Forest . The El Toro base closure office first received official word of the Interior_Department ' s interest in a letter signed by Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt dated June 1 . In the letter to Defense_Secretary William J . Perry , Babbitt said his agency had identified numerous military bases it would like to acquire . Both the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station and the neighboring Tustin Marine Corps Air_Station were included on the list of bases that could be swapped for parklands . The Tustin base conversion committee -- separate from the agency set_up to plan El Toro ' s future -- already has proposed that the Interior_Department set_aside one of its historic blimp hangars and 85 acres for parkland . Pete Ciesla , base coordinator at El Toro , said the air_station might have been added_to that list based on an early inquiry from a regional Native_American group that has not followed up with any specific proposal . Ciesla also said the Interior_Department has not submitted a specific application for the proposed land swap , but the agency has until Dec . 1 to make its bid . The official notification of the agency ' s interest in the base was described by Ciesla as a &quot; get your foot in the door &quot; letter . &quot; They said they are interested , based on local community requests they received. &quot; An official close to the Irvine Co . said that the land-exchange plan was not given a high priority until company officials recognized the opportunity to control a master_plan of the entire area . Under the Defense_Department ' s base closure law , federal agencies get the first chance to claim military base property scheduled for closure . A Washington-based attorney who specializes in this area of federal law , but who did not want to be identified , said that land swaps like the one now under_consideration in Orange County have occurred in the past . But federal_officials said it is unlikely that the plan would go_through unless the community is in_agreement . The secretary_of_the_Navy also would have to sign_off on such a land exchange before it could be implemented . Defense_Department officials left open the possibility that special legislation might be required in_order to turn the base over to a private landowner . In Orange County , former Irvine Mayor Larry Agran may have been the first to publicly float the idea of a land exchange involving El Toro . In a commentary published by The Times Orange County Edition in early February , Agran suggested that the Irvine Co . deed &quot; thousands of acres of its agricultural land &quot; to the federal_government which would then be placed in trust , &quot; ensuring that much of Orange County ' s remaining agricultural open space would be permanently preserved , forever free_of development. &quot; Under Agran ' s plan , the government would then give the developer control of El Toro , on the condition that there be no commercial airport development . But Friday , as news of the possible land swap spread throughout the business_community , prospects for a second Orange County airport seemed to gain momentum . Local developers and real_estate experts hailed the possibility as a &quot; win-win &quot; situation for the Irvine Co. , which could exchange hard-to-develop properties for valuable land adjacent to its flagship investment , the Irvine Spectrum . An expansive business park , the Spectrum has grown from 250 companies with 2 # 500 employees in 1984 to nearly 2 # 000 companies with more_than 32 # 000 employees today . &quot; I think an airport , although they won ' t admit it , is what they want to see there , &quot; said Jeffrey W . Cole , president of the National Assn . of Office and Industrial Properties local chapter . Possibilities for an airport become even more attractive when considering how difficult residential development would be in light of the toxic contamination of the base , said Jeff Meyers , head of a Newport Beach real_estate consulting_firm . &quot; With the toxic cleanup they would need to do , we would n ' t see any housing_development there in our lifetime , &quot; he said . &quot; This site is no cake-walk , but if anyone can develop it , it ' s the Irvine Co. &quot; In recent months , the task of planning for the civilian conversion of El Toro has been left up_to a specially created intergovernmental agency called the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority . But from the start , the planning process has been fraught with political controversy , mostly pitting South County interests against North County ' s . It took months for officials to even settle_on the geographic configuration of the agency ' s nine-member governing board . Despite the trouble , those involved in planning the agency seemed hesitant to abandon its mission to present an acceptable conversion plan to the federal_government . But should the land swap be approved , Riley said , it was possible that there might be no further use for the agency . At that point , he said , land planning authority should be handled by the county Board of Supervisors , since it already regulates development of all unincorporated property in the area . Dan Miller , director of the consulting_firm working for the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority , was disappointed that the authority -- the agency responsible_for producing an acceptable development plan for the Marine base -- had been &quot; left_out of the loop &quot; in the land-swap discussions . One federal_official called the idea the makings of &quot; a scam , &quot; suggesting that the Irvine Co . was giving_away virtually worthless gnatcatcher habitat that would be difficult to develop in exchange for prime land in the heart of Orange County . Lake Forest Mayor Marcia Rudolph , who opposes a civilian airport at El Toro , said she did not think Irvine Co . ownership of El Toro would derail the intergovernmental planning process . The authority &quot; is going_to be integrally involved in the whole_thing . The Department_of_Defense has recognized it as the official reuse planning agency , &quot; said Rudolph . &quot; Remember , it ' s just ownership that ' s changing , not use. &quot; There is also disagreement over how a land exchange would affect the November election to determine whether an airport should be built_on the property . Some believe that a ballot initiative would not govern private_property . But James E . Erickson , a local land use authority attorney who previously worked_on the issue , said the ballot measure would have an impact . The initiative , if approved , would require the county to zone 2 # 000 acres for commercial airport use . That zoning requirement would apply to whoever owns the land , Erickson said . That could become important since both federal and local officials believe a land swap could not be completed by_Election Day . &quot; It ' s a very intriguing scenario , &quot; County Supervisor Gaddi H . Vasquez said Friday . &quot; This thing ( land-swap proposal ) has come_over the_hill rather quickly . I don ' t how fast this train is going_down the track. &quot; Let ' s Make a Deal The future of El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station is one of the most hotly debated issues in Orange County . Environmentalists propose that the Irvine Co . swap 10 # 000 acres of undeveloped land bordering Cleveland National Forest to the U.S._government for 3 # 500 acres of the El Toro base . Who Benefits * Interior_Department : Undeveloped land is preserved for public use ; expands half-million acre Cleveland National Forest * Irvine Co. : Would have major influence over El Toro reuse plans after its closure Top Three Scenarios Since the base closure was announced in 1993 , several reuse ideas have emerged . * Airport : John Wayne Airport has two problems . It moves no air cargo and is approaching its limit of 8.4 million passengers a year . An El Toro airport would provide-much needed relief to businesses , including Federal Express and United Parcel Service . * Mass transit center : Buses , van-pools , taxis and commuter_trains would be linked through Orange County Transit Authority . Plan calls_for only 100 acres . Could be implemented with or without airport . * Prison : Two security facilities would house more_than 2 # 000 low- and minimum-level security prisoners . Plan calls_for only 155 acres . Proposed by U.S. Bureau of Prisons .
