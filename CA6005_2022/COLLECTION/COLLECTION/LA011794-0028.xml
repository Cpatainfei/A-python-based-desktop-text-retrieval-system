   <HEADLINE> DIVERSION OF WHITEWATER FUNDS DISPUTED ; INQUIRY : LAWYER FOR HEAD OF DEFUNCT S &amp; L SAYS THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOURCE OF CASH WOULD HAVE BEEN AN ACCOUNT SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY BANK_EXAMINERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The attorney for a key figure in the controversial Whitewater land deal on Sunday insisted that funds from a failed Arkansas savings and loan could not have been diverted into Bill_Clinton ' s gubernatorial campaign coffers without being noticed by a host of federal_agents . Sam Heuer , attorney for James B . McDougal , the president of the defunct Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan , said the only possible source of diverted funds would be Madison Guaranty ' s &quot; cash_account &quot; -- a pot of money that Heuer said &quot; is the first thing the ( bank ) examiners look at. &quot; Bank_examiners , FBI_agents and Justice_Department attorneys &quot; pored over &quot; the account ' s records and McDougal &quot; would have been very quickly charged at that point_in_time with criminal activity had any money been diverted , &quot; Heuer said on ABC-TV ' s &quot; This Week With David Brinkley. &quot; * Heuer was commenting on one of the central questions surrounding the tangled land deal in which President Clinton , his wife and McDougal were investors : whether Clinton ' s 1984 gubernatorial campaign benefited financially from his relationship with McDougal . But the remarks left unanswered some of the Whitewater deal ' s other mysteries , including whether then-Gov . Clinton may have acted to shore_up the failing thrift , which was seized by regulators in 1989 , to help his business partner . In another development , the Administration stepped_up efforts to put the Whitewater affair behind it following a decision last week to ask Atty . Gen . Janet Reno to name a special counsel to investigate the Clintons ' role . Speaking on NBC-TV ' s &quot; Meet the Press , &quot; presidential counselor David Gergen , reviewing the White_House ' s handling of the Whitewater affair , acknowledged that &quot; there are some things we would have done differently , &quot; but he said that &quot; we ' ve dealt with it , we ' re moving on. &quot; He added : &quot; We really don ' t plan to be talking_about it very much from the White_House . We don ' t see the need for it. &quot; * Two key Republicans suggested that there will be limits to the GOP effort to probe the politically charged affair . Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) , who has called_for a congressional investigation into the_matter , said that &quot; we need to wait and see &quot; who is appointed as special counsel . &quot; That may change the attitude some. &quot; At the same time , Dole made clear that Republicans pressing for a congressional inquiry are seeking to turn the tables on congressional Democrats , who conducted a total of 18 investigations into alleged presidential wrongdoing during the Ronald Reagan and George_Bush administrations . &quot; I think the bottom_line here is the Democrats will investigate Republicans , as they did 18 times in 12 years . . . but Democrats in Congress aren ' t going_to investigate Democratic administrations , &quot; he said . Rep . Jim Leach ( R-Iowa ) , who has been one of the key GOP figures raising questions about the Whitewater affair , pledged to proceed on_his_own if the Democrats refuse to create a bipartisan panel to investigate Whitewater . But he said he will not seek testimony from First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton , who was Madison Guaranty ' s attorney at the time . &quot; Nothing would be more inappropriate than a congressional effort to embarrass Mrs . Clinton , &quot; he said . &quot; We are looking_at a prior elected official , a current elected official , &quot; he said , referring to the President . In pressing his case for a congressional probe , Leach , the ranking Republican on the House Banking Committee , noted that while a special counsel would focus_on potentially criminal activity , Congress would be the appropriate body in which to air issues of &quot; public trust. &quot; &quot; This isn ' t the largest issue . It ' s somewhere between much ado about nothing and something might be a little rotten in part of the Ozarks , &quot; he told CBS-TV ' s &quot; Face the Nation. &quot; &quot; There are possible breaches of law , but more importantly , there ' s a public ethic here that ' s at issue. &quot; However , Heuer disputed the suggestion that investigators will find breaches of law in documents turned_over to investigators by McDougal and others involved in the Whitewater deal . * Madison Guaranty ' s books were examined by the Federal Home_Loan_Bank Board twice , once in 1984 and again in 1986 , Heuer said . The institution was also investigated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp . and two independent accounting_firms , as well as by attorneys of the Justice_Department and the FBI , he said . &quot; I don ' t know of any real major secrets in any of the Whitewater materials , and I would suspect , were there some secrets , we would have known about them long before now , &quot; Heuer said . He likened public concern over the Clintons ' relationship with McDougal to anti-Communist hysteria , and he chided journalists , who he said are making mountains out of &quot; molehill issues. &quot; &quot; The linchpin of this whole_thing seems to be the fact that Jim McDougal was a savings and loan executive , which is akin to being a Communist in the McCarthy era or a witch in the Salem era , and that ' s ludicrous , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
