   <HEADLINE> NEW ERA BETWEEN HOLY_CITY , ETERNAL CITY ; DIPLOMACY : ESTABLISHMENT OF FORMAL RELATIONS BRINGS TOGETHER THE SHARED HISTORY OF TWO ANCIENT FAITHS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The establishment of diplomatic relations between the Vatican and the state of Israel is a momentous event because it normalizes relations between the Roman_Catholic_Church and the Jewish people after 2 # 000 years . It brings_together the spiritual children of Rome , the Eternal City , and the spiritual children of Jerusalem , the Holy_City , in an extraordinary way . In AD 70 , the Roman_Empire ended Jewish sovereignty in the land of Israel by destroying Jerusalem ' s Holy Temple . After that catastrophe , many Jews were expelled from their homeland . But some Jews , few in number , remained in the Holy_Land during the centuries of invasions and wars that followed . Their constant hope was that an independent Jewish state would someday be reborn . It was a long and painful wait that finally ended with the birth of modern Israel in 1948 . During those centuries , Christianity , deeply rooted in Judaism , grew in size and influence . But the new religion ' s relationship with its parent was strained and sometimes bloody . And because Jesus was a Jew from the land of Israel , and because Christianity had made the Hebrew Bible and much of Jewish teaching and liturgy its own , Jews and Christians shared a unique but deeply troubled relationship . Jews became victims of Christian fury that included the Crusades , the Inquisition , expulsions , bigotry and persistent persecution . Because of this shameful reality , many Jews viewed Christians , and especially Roman_Catholics , with deep suspicion and fear . But , in some lands and during some centuries , the Christian-Jewish relationship was filled with light , though mostly it was a history of dark , ominous shadows . For nearly 20 centuries Christians and Jews lived an uneasy coexistence . The Nazi Holocaust , the mass_murder of 6 million Jews in the heart of Christian Europe between 1933 and 1945 , shattered that fragile relationship . Systemic , radical evil and genocidal anti-Semitism required a new relationship between Christian and Jew . For the Jewish people , the state of Israel became the symbol and reality of survival after Auschwitz . The Jewish state was the answer to homelessness and powerlessness , but it remained officially unrecognized by the Roman_Catholic_Church . The 1965 Second Vatican Council declaration , &quot; Nostra Aetate , &quot; ushered_in a positive era for Catholics and Jews , but it made no mention of the state of Israel . Indeed , Vatican leaders have long had conflicting views about a reborn Jewish state . In 1904 , Theodor Herzl , modern Zionism ' s founder , was hopeful he could obtain the Holy_See ' s support , but his hopes were dashed when Pope Pius X responded negatively to Herzl ' s request : &quot; We cannot approve of the Zionist movement . . . . We could never sanction it . The Hebrews have not recognized our Lord , therefore we cannot recognize the Hebrew people. &quot; But when Herzl met with the Vatican secretary_of_state two weeks later , the tone was different : &quot; If the Jews believe they might greatly ease their lot by being admitted to the land of their ancestors , then we would regard it as a humanitarian question . We shall never forget that without Jerusalem ( Judaism ) , we ( Catholics ) would have been nothing. &quot; At last the ambivalence has ended , and diplomatic relations mean that the Vatican , led by Pope John Paul II , now joins 133 other nation-states in fully recognizing the legitimacy and permanence of the Jewish state within the family of nations . Vatican-Israel diplomatic relations could not have been established without nearly 30 years of dynamic and constructive Catholic-Jewish relations , much of it in the United States . Nor could it have happened without the leadership of many Catholic clergy and lay people . One of the chief advocates for formal ties is Cardinal John O ' Connor of New York . Wherever he traveled throughout the world , the cardinal consistently called_for full diplomatic relations , and I strongly believe he reflected the beliefs of millions of Catholics . * Will Vatican-Israel relations mean the end of anti-Semitism ? No . But they will aid in the eternal struggle against that deadly social pathology . Will Vatican-Israel relations mean the end of theological differences between Catholics and Jews ? Of course not . But relations will release fresh energy in both communities , and the dialogue will move_into new areas and with increased confidence . Will Vatican-Israel relations mean the end of flash_points between Catholics and Jews ? No . But relations will provide a firm foundation to face future crises in a spirit of cooperation and not confrontation . The establishment of diplomatic relations between the Vatican and Israel is not a once-in-a-generation event , nor is it even a once-in-a-lifetime happening . Rather , it is a once-and-for-all moment in the shared history of two ancient faith communities .
