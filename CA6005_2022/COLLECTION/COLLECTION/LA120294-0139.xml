   <HEADLINE> THOROUGHBRED RACING ; OLD , GRAY MARE GETS A HARD SELL FOR ECLIPSE AWARD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The danger for owners who campaign for their horses at Eclipse Awards voting time is the potential backlash . Hype can turn_off voters , just as it might influence them . Leonard Lavin has been living dangerously for years . Even though he ' s chairman of a company that makes hair_spray , Lavin doesn ' t use the stuff . His wife , Bernice , has reminded him of this from time to time , most recently last month when Lavin ' s fast gray 6-year-old , One Dreamer , scored the biggest upset of the day in the Breeders ' Cup at Churchill Downs . There might have been a fall breeze in the winner ' s circle , but it was the mare -- not the hair -- that was foremost in Lavin ' s mind . Since an 8-year-old Leonard Lavin and his father saw Reigh Count win the Kentucky_Derby in 1928 , he has been close to horses . Few have been closer than One Dreamer , a daughter of Relaunch , another gray who gave Lavin a victory in the Del Mar Derby in 1979 . So Lavin doesn ' t care if his zeal hurts at the Eclipse ballot_box . He has never won a title , and he can ' t let this election go_by without going_to bat for his horse . &quot; Sky Beauty ' s a great mare , &quot; Lavin said the other day , calling from his car phone from in suburban Chicago . &quot; But I think I ' ve got_the_best mare in the business. &quot; The voters must decide whether Sky Beauty ' s pre-Churchill Downs record means more_than the Breeders ' Cup Distaff , in which One Dreamer outran a formidable field at 47-1 . Lavin ' s candidate for the best filly or older mare title finished more_than 12 lengths ahead of Sky Beauty , who ran last in the nine-horse field . Before the Breeders ' Cup , Sky Beauty was favored to win the Eclipse Award . She was undefeated for the year , having rolled_up five victories from May to September on her home New York tracks . But her campaign turned_into a reflection of last year when she was also dominant early before finishing fifth in the Distaff at Santa Anita and blowing the Eclipse for best 3-year-old filly . Sky Beauty ' s record is a strange one . In 18 starts , she has lost only four -- three on tracks outside New York and the other on a foul after she had finished first at Saratoga . &quot; I wonder whether the horses Sky Beauty was beating in New York this year had the class that the horses had in the Distaff , &quot; Lavin said . &quot; My horse didn ' t need her ( home ) track with her to win . She won on an off track early in the year at Churchill . She won on both firm turf and soft turf at Arlington . Then she won on a fast dirt_track in the Breeders ' Cup . Hollywood Wildcat ( winner of the 1993 Distaff ) was lapped on One Dreamer early and couldn ' t keep_up . And Heavenly Prize , who ran second ( by a neck ) at Churchill , is probably the best 3-year-old filly in the country , but she wasn ' t going_to pass us if we went_around again. &quot; Hollywood Wildcat , struggling with the cuppy Churchill Downs surface , ran sixth in the Distaff . One Dreamer finished the year with four victories , a second and a third in eight starts . Her best losing race was a fourth-place finish on grass in the Beverly D at Arlington International in late August . She lost by only 1 1 / 2 lengths and the 1-2 finishers were Hatoof , the probable female grass champion after a second-place finish in the Breeders ' Cup Turf ; and Flawlessly , champion distaffer on turf in 1992-93 . &quot; A Chicago handicapper wrote us off in the Distaff and said , ' Must be dreaming , ' &quot; Lavin said . &quot; But we thought we had a real shot , because the mare had never run a bad race. &quot; Relaunch , bought by Lavin at a yearling auction for $ 73 # 000 , has sired about one-third of Lavin ' s more_than 40 stakes winners . Not an automatic horse to vote for by any means , One Dreamer was an easy horse to root for because of her struggling beginnings . &quot; She ran only once at 3 and really didn ' t get started until she was a 4-year-old , &quot; Lavin said . &quot; She had that cyst on a lung and almost died before we got_it taken_care of. &quot; Lavin and his trainer , Tom Proctor , wanted to run One Dreamer once more this year , to give the voters something else to think_about and finally settled_on the one-mile Top Flight Handicap at Aqueduct last Friday . New York is where many of the Eclipse voters go racing . &quot; She got some heat in one of her knees , &quot; Lavin said . &quot; So we decided to retire her. &quot; Horse_Racing Notes Best Pal worked a half-mile Thursday in : 49 4 / 5 and trainer Richard Mandella said that the 6-year-old gelding will run Sunday in the $ 100 # 000 Native Diver Handicap . . . . Nine distaffers are entered for Saturday ' s $ 100 # 000 Bayakoa Handicap , including Miss Dominique , who ran third at 77-1 in the Breeders ' Cup Distaff . Others entered in the 1 1 / 16-mile race are Magical Maiden , Borodislew , Dancing Mirage , Glass Ceiling , Thirst for Peace , Fondly Remembered , Enchanted Spot and Klassy Kim . The high weights are Miss Dominique and Magical Maiden , at 120 pounds . . . . Randy Romero , trying to make a comeback after a short-lived retirement earlier this year , won Thursday with Sabreen , a filly who dropped from stakes company to $ 50 # 000 claimers after losing by 34 1 / 2 lengths in two previous starts .</TEXT>
