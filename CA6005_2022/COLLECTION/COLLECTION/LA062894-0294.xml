   <HEADLINE> HUGHES ADDS TO INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY GLUT ; . . . BUT MARKET ' S NEW BURDEN MAY SELL QUICKLY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One unsettling side_effect of the wrenching cutbacks in the manufacturing , aerospace and defense industries has been the dumping of large commercial and industrial properties on an already depressed real_estate market . In the past few years , the huge Van Nuys General Motors auto assembly_plant , Stroh Brewery in Van Nuys , 380 acres in Burbank owned by Lockheed Corp. , two Redken Laboratories buildings in Canoga Park and bankrupt weapons maker Marquardt Manufacturing ' s Van Nuys headquarters have all come_on the market . Now the latest in this string of abandoned giant-sized properties is Hughes Aircraft Co. ' s missile systems division , currently in the last stages of closing its 35-year-old West Hills complex . The once-bustling facility is where Hughes designed various missile systems , including the TOW missile -- most memorable for demolishing Iraqi tanks during the Persian_Gulf_War . Now the 85-acre , 13-building office and industrial center is becoming a ghost_town as Hughes relocates its engineering group to Tucson , where the missiles are manufactured . The remaining 1 # 000 workers will be gone_by August and the property will be put_up for_sale . But there are early indications that the Hughes site won ' t turn_into just another white_elephant . Many observers believe that Hughes might find a buyer for the property far more quickly than others -- including Hughes ' parent company , General Motors , which was trying to sell the Van Nuys auto plant even before it closed two years ago . In fact , an aide to Councilman Hal Bernson said that a &quot; major company &quot; is already negotiating to buy the Hughes site . Greg Smith , Bernson ' s chief deputy , would not identify the prospective buyer . Hughes spokesman Rand Christensen declined to comment on a possible deal . &quot; When a sale is finalized , we ' ll announce that , &quot; he said . Sell It Off in Pieces ? The company ' s real_estate department is &quot; in the final stages of evaluating the site and firming_up their strategy &quot; to market the property , and expects to list it for_sale later this year , Christensen said . &quot; we ' ll talk to any interested parties before we list it formally. &quot; The market_value of the Hughes property is probably about $ 10 per square_foot , or $ 37 million , said Bill Pentz , vice_president at Daum Commercial &amp; Industrial Real_Estate in Woodland Hills . that ' s a little more_than half the property ' s 1993 assessed value of $ 69 million , but Pentz said the lower figure represents what the land is worth without the buildings -- and is probably closer to what a buyer would be willing to pay . &quot; If the price is right , &quot; Pentz said , &quot; they can get_it sold in six months. &quot; The Hughes property is generating interest from an eclectic group of potential buyers . Pat Hall , president of TOLD Partners Inc. , a real_estate_broker in Woodland Hills , said that his firm is &quot; having discussions &quot; with an unidentified private_school that might want to use a portion of the Hughes site . Unlike the GM facility , which is dominated by the 71 # 000-square-foot plant , the multi-building Hughes site could be easily divided into &quot; pieces &quot; that could be sold or redeveloped separately , Hall said . Another organization is considering the Hughes property and other large sites in the Valley -- including the GM plant -- for the design and manufacture of planes , electric vehicles and rail cars . The San Jose-based Manufacturing Technology Initiative , a nonprofit consortium , has been helping companies form joint_ventures that it hopes to locate at the chosen site . One venture , led by Anaheim electric-car maker Taylor-Dunn Manufacturing Co. , is seeking 500 # 000 square_feet of industrial space in the Valley to build electric_cars . A decision on where to locate will be &quot; based upon dollars , &quot; said coalition President Gloria Rose Ott . Many real_estate specialists say the Hughes site has many advantages over the still-empty GM plant that could make_it more attractive to a potential buyer . The Hughes property , although zoned for heavy industrial use , is a hilltop , campus-style office and industrial complex that is surrounded by upscale homes . The facility could appeal_to health-care , high-tech , telecommunications or insurance_companies , real_estate_brokers say . Although some possible buyers might be deterred by the site ' s isolation from other commercial development , others might consider that a plus . &quot; This is a better location than GM and it ' s in better condition , &quot; said Seth Dudley , senior_vice_president at commercial real_estate brokerage Julien J . Studley Inc. in Los Angeles . Stumbling Blocks Any sale could be complicated by certain factors , however . If significant environmental contamination is discovered , Hughes would probably have to mount a major cleanup program as a condition of a sale , which can be expensive and time consuming . Lockheed has spent $ 55 million so far cleaning_up toxic substances at its Burbank properties and expects the total remediation effort to cost $ 175 million over the next several years . So far that doesn ' t seem to be a problem for Hughes . The Hughes property was inspected within the past month and no soil contamination was found , said Richard Varenchik , spokesman for the state Environmental Protection Agency ' s Department of Toxic Substances Control . There is contaminated ground_water at the site from underground storage_tanks that leaked gasoline and diesel_fuel , said Elijah Hill , an engineer at the state Water Quality_Control Board . But the tanks have been removed and the contamination is &quot; pretty limited , something on the order of size of a gasoline service_station , &quot; Hill said . An ongoing cleanup is being done on the property , he said . Hughes ' spokesman Christensen said there is a plant at the facility to treat the ground_water . &quot; Nothing would prohibit us from selling the property , &quot; he said . Also , one of the Hughes buildings was yellow-tagged for limited use after the January earthquake . Christensen said the building was not repaired because of the move to Tucson , but he does not expect it to hinder the sale of the property . A bigger concern is California ' s still-laggard economy and the state ' s anti-business reputation , said Mike Howard , senior_vice_president at commercial and industrial real_estate_broker Grubb &amp; Ellis in Sherman Oaks . &quot; Unless there ' s some community incentive . . . I don ' t know if in the near-term we ' re going to attract someone to the site , &quot; he said . Luring out-of-state businesses to the Hughes site would be difficult , even though many Eastern firms have been seeking manufacturing , distribution and back-office locations in the West to avoid weather-related shipping delays , said James Schriner , a partner at PHH Fantus , a New York consulting firm that advises manufacturers on selecting sites . Those companies have confined their searches to states such_as New Mexico and Arizona , which are perceived to be business-friendly . &quot; California costs are still too scary , &quot; Schriner said . Even local companies that real_estate_agents cite as likely to need more space for expansion aren ' t good prospects . Fast-growing Blue Cross of California in Woodland Hills , for instance , said it has no expansion plans . Woodland Hills insurer 20th Century Industries , which had been courted by every major developer in the West Valley , has put its headquarters move_on hold while it tries to recover from the devastating impact of earthquake damage claims on its financial_condition . And Cal State Northridge , which four years ago considered using part of the Hughes facility has &quot; no need or interest in it &quot; now , said CSUN spokesman Bruce Erickson . In 1990 , the school ' s enrollment reached 31 # 000 and was expected to grow further . Then the recession hit , along with fee increases . Enrollment is now down to about 26 # 000 , the school is still recovering from severe earthquake damage and expansion plans are &quot; dead and cold , &quot; Erickson said . Converting the property to a residential development is also considered unlikely because it would be difficult for a developer to raise the financing for such a project in today ' s sluggish housing market . Many local officials , including Mayor Richard Riordan , Councilman Bernson , Rep . Howard Berman ( D-Panorama City ) and Assemblyman Richard Katz ( D-Sylmar ) , have promised to join efforts to lure buyers to the large abandoned Valley properties . But community efforts to help sell big properties such_as the GM plant so far have been fragmented and largely unsuccessful . that ' s one reason the Valley Economic Development Center , the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn . and local chambers_of_commerce are constructing a business plan for the Valley to help attract and retain businesses . One idea being studied is to allow sellers of large properties to donate their empty facilities to a nonprofit agency and receive substantial tax write-offs , said VEDC President John Rooney . The agency would then offer the properties for_sale at prices well below their market_values . What ' s needed , Rooney said , is &quot; a thought-out effort to help market these sites more effectively. &quot;</TEXT>
