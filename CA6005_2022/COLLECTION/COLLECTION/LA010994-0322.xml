   <HEADLINE> SOME INDIAN TOWNS REJECT MEXICO REBELS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Mexican troops marched into Chanal , the last rebel-held town , last week after overcoming a token defense by Indian guerrillas on the outskirts , villagers proudly handed them 14 rebels . The soldiers were not surprised . Residents of San Juan Chamula had also turned_over a captured guerrilla to the government , and in Oxchuc citizens had pleaded with the army to come get 14 rebels they had captured -- and allegedly stoned . All three Indian towns came_down firmly on the side of the government and against the guerrillas , whose avowed purpose is to fight for the rights of indigenous people . The government claims that their actions showed the lack of Indian support for the armed movement . But researchers and human_rights activists who know the area say reasons could range from fear of reprisals to a traditional conflict between the residents of county_seats and the more impoverished rebels living_in the_hills surrounding them . &quot; The rebels are not all_of the Indians , or even a majority , &quot; said Richard Nye , an anthropologist who has lived_in the area for 24 years . &quot; Those participating in the movement are the most radical line of one position taken by the Indians : The only way to force political change is revolution , &quot; he said . &quot; This has not been accepted by a majority , although all are sympathetic to their demands. &quot; Although other Indian groups may be sympathetic , they are not willing to risk their own communities for a group of strangers , said Susanna Paisley , development coordinator at Casa Na Bolom , a research_center here for Indian cultures . &quot; The Chamula asked_for federal troops to come guard their city so there would n ' t be any question about what side they are_on , &quot; said Will Hoffman , cultural projects coordinator at Na Bolom . &quot; They know what could happen if they get caught in the middle. &quot; An Interior Ministry report released Friday repeats the government ' s insistence that peasants were pressured into participating and that the rebels have little grass-roots support . And President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has said he will consider pardons for peasants who were tricked into joining the rebels . &quot; Peasant recruits have told us that there have been cases where children were taken hostage to gain their parents ' participation , &quot; the report stated . Others were said to have been threatened with expulsion from their communities if they did not participate . The strongest rejection of the guerrillas was in Oxchuc , where captured rebels told reporters that they were stoned and beaten . &quot; They burned our buildings , &quot; one villager , a heavyset man who would not reveal his name , explained as he gestured toward the gutted frames of modest concrete-block buildings that were once municipal offices . Oxchuc residents were shocked that international media had portrayed them as savages for their treatment of the prisoners . The day after the incident , Oxchuc leaders were_on the second floor of the village gazebo , watching for reporters and telling residents over the public_address_system not to talk with them . Officials from half_a_dozen Indian communities attended a news_conference apparently staged by the government to express their opposition to the guerrillas . And many villagers did not blame the Salinas administration for failing to send immediate help when they were under siege . &quot; We understand that our government has limited resources , &quot; one Oxchuc leader said . &quot; The problem is you foreigners who come here bringing trouble. &quot; So it came as little surprise that local leaders decided to turn_in the guerrillas , who are mainly from the hillsides , one rights activist said . &quot; People in the county_seats are more or less contented and accepting of their lot , &quot; he said . &quot; It is in the outlying areas that conditions are most extreme. &quot; Bases are in remote areas that can be reached only after three- or four-hour journeys over hidden trails through dense vegetation . It is in these remote areas that the guerrillas have actively recruited , according to government reports . And that is where their support runs deep . In the guerrilla strongholds , women , old people and children provide support_systems from food and money to transporting arms and providing lookouts . &quot; The group gradually transforms the dynamics of communities under their control , &quot; the government report stated . &quot; All productive activity is practically paralyzed , and municipal activities , including education , are neglected. &quot;</TEXT>
