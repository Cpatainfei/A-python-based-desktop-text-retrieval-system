   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ; U.S. SENATE ; FEINSTEIN PROTESTS NEWEST HUFFINGTON ADS ; INCUMBENT SAYS SHE AGAIN IS FALSELY ACCUSED OF BEING SOFT ON CRIME . THE CHALLENGER INSISTS THE SENATOR ' S RECORD SPEAKS FOR ITSELF , WHILE A POLL CALLS THE RACE A DEAD_HEAT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In chilling new political ads that graphically report details of a brutal Florida murder , Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington on Thursday accused Sen . Dianne Feinstein of being soft_on crime by supporting lenient judges . Feinstein countered that the latest ads are further proof that Huffington ' s campaign has been based &quot; on character_assassination and name-calling from the very beginning. &quot; She also said her record as a tough crime fighter is backed by endorsements from most of the state ' s major law_enforcement groups . Rep . Huffington ( R-Santa Barbara ) prompted the latest exchange by launching newspaper and radio ads throughout California on Thursday criticizing Feinstein ' s votes last year to name former Florida Chief_Justice Rosemary Barkett to the federal appellate_court . Huffington complained that Barkett voted against the death_penalty in several Florida cases , including a 1974 murder in which one of the men convicted of killing a teen-age boy later boasted of his role in a tape-recording sent to the victim ' s family . Huffington ' s ads include a chilling excerpt from the killer ' s tape that said : &quot; He was stabbed in the back , in the chest , and the stomach -- it was beautiful . I enjoyed every minute of it . I loved watching blood gush from his eyes. &quot; The Florida Supreme Court in 1992 upheld Jacob Dougan ' s death sentence for killing Jacksonville teen-ager Steven Orlando . Barkett , Florida ' s first woman chief_justice , joined a dissenting_opinion that opposed the sentence because of Dougan ' s troubled past . Huffington ' s attack came as tension in the U.S. Senate_race increased again Thursday with the release of a new independent statewide poll showing the candidates locked_in a dead_heat . Both Feinstein and Huffington were supported by 42 % of the state ' s registered voters in the Field Poll . Among those voters most likely to cast a ballot in November , the survey found both candidates favored by 43 % . The results reflect a sharp drop_in Feinstein ' s support and an increase in Huffington ' s since last spring . A frustrated Feinstein complained Thursday that the poll finding is_due to Huffington ' s enormous campaign spending on television commercials attacking her record . Feinstein charged that Thursday ' s ads are another example of the name-calling that has dominated her opponent ' srace . The senator argued that she has tried to run_on her accomplishments in Washington . As evidence , she noted recent endorsements from Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and about a dozen police groups representing most of California law_enforcement . &quot; His campaign has really been based on character_assassination and name calling from the very beginning , &quot; she said . &quot; . . . I ' ve been endorsed by virtually all , if not the dominant majority of law_enforcement in the state , and I ' ve been there and I ' ve performed . He has done nothing except what his script writers write for him to say . This is what is so frustrating about this campaign. &quot; Huffington , in his attack Thursday , sought to counter Feinstein ' s claim that she has been effective at opposing crime . He also dismissed her support from police groups and individuals as political pay-backs that don ' t represent the opinions of rank-and-file members . &quot; The reason I brought_up the judge is because one of the most important things a Senator can do -- perhaps the most important thing -- is the appointment and the vote for a judge , &quot; Huffington said in an interview . &quot; They sit there long after the senator retires . I think ( Barkett ) is a travesty . And that ' s where she and I differ so dramatically. &quot; Feinstein voted to approve President Clinton ' s nomination of Barkett twice -- once in her role on the Senate Judiciary Committee and again when the appointment passed_on the Senate floor last year , 61 to 37 . Conservative opponents of Barkett , who complain that the judge has a reputation for sympathy toward criminal defendants with troubled backgrounds , raised the Orlando murder case as an example during a six-hour debate on the Senate floor . Feinstein declined to comment on Barkett ' s decision in the_matter since she has not reviewed details . She noted , however , that Barkett voted to uphold the death_penalty in more_than 200 Florida cases she handled . The senator also said Barkett won election to the Florida court in 1992 and she was recommended for the federal bench by the state ' s two death_penalty supporting senators -- Democrat Bob Graham and Republican Connie Mack . Huffington ' s campaign responded with a report listing 17 death_penalty cases opposed by Barkett since 1987 . Huffington also reached back in Feinstein ' s past , as other Republican challengers have , to question her commitment to the death_penalty because of her relationship with former California Chief_Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird . Huffington , who was living_in Texas when voters rejected Bird because of her decisions against the death_penalty , said in newspaper_ads Thursday that the former justice presided at Feinstein ' s swearing in three times . &quot; I think this is an old albatross , &quot; Feinstein said . &quot; Rose Bird is not on the Supreme Court . . . . This woman has retired . She is entitled to her retirement . My views on the death_penalty and Rose Bird ' s are very different. &quot; Political Scorecard 46 days to go before Californians go_to the polls . THE GOVERNOR ' S RACE * What Happened Thursday : Gov . Pete Wilson and state_Treasurer Kathleen Brown continued to spar on debates , with Wilson accepting one invitation and Brown challenging him to respond to another .

Huffington is scheduled to return from Washington in the evening . NOTABLE QUOTE &quot; When it was economically advantageous , many in California supported an open-door_policy to immigration -- to assure a plentiful supply of agricultural and industrial workers . . . . At the time , few in public office were even concerned about this problem. &quot; -- Atty . Gen . Janet Reno , responding to Gov . Pete Wilson ' s request that President Clinton declare an &quot; immigration emergency &quot;</TEXT>
