   <TEXT> As a boy , Joe Arpaio lived for &quot; oaters , &quot; those Saturday matinees starring Hollywood ' s singing cowboys who knew good from evil , and whose righteousness made local folks eager to ride with them on the dusty trail of outlaws . Now , as sheriff of Arizona ' s Maricopa County , Arpaio has mobilized his own 2 # 200-member volunteer posse , 800 of whom strap on side_arms and Stetsons to join deputies in crime-fighting blitzkriegs across the Phoenix valley . To some critics , the mostly white , middle- and upper-middle-class posse is profoundly amateurish , an armed and zealous band of lawyers , doctors , politicians , corporate_executives and pot-bellied retirees out_to savor the excitement of ridding their city of hell-raisers and criminals . The sheriff says they are a tightly regulated group of men and women who -- at minimal cost to taxpayers -- help his understaffed and poorly funded office guard a citizenship longing for law and order . While armed , his posse members cannot draw their weapons unless their lives are threatened , or make an arrest without the supervision of a deputy . The posse is but one example of the Wild_West feel Arpaio has brought_to the nation ' s fifth largest sheriff ' s department since he was elected in 1992 . Making_good on a vow to &quot; get_tough on criminals , &quot; the 62-year-old former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent has launched high-profile programs that have made him a hero to residents eager for iron-fisted crime fighting and an object of horrified fascination to civil_rights advocates . Even some law_enforcement officials question the effectiveness of Arpaio ' s strategies , which are high on public relations appeal but may do little to reduce crime in a region where the homicide rate is rising . Besides creating the posse , Arpaio has solved a jail overcrowding problem by erecting canvas_tents in a field surrounded by a concertina-wire fence . So what if 1 # 000 inmates bake in 120-degree heat because the swamp coolers in the tents do not always work . And so what if they are not allowed to smoke , read pin-up magazines or watch movies . The way Arpaio figures it , jails are supposed to be hellholes . And besides , his $ 100 # 000 tent facility has saved the county $ 41 million in construction costs . But critics , who include some former admirers , warn that Arpaio ' s zealous approach would backfire should an inmate die of heat_prostration or a bystander get shot by a posse member . They also say that his confrontational tactics counter the trend in law_enforcement across the nation known as community-based policing . That strategy , which encourages cooperation and friendly relations with residents , has been embraced by the Los Angeles Police_Department , among others . Dewey Stokes , national president of the Fraternal Order of Police , which represents 250 # 000 peace_officers nationwide , derided the notion that a volunteer posse can do police work_at no risk to the people they aim to protect . &quot; I have a concern about the professionalism of the posse , their training in arrest , search and seizure , &quot; he said . &quot; The thing he ' s got_to be concerned about is liability . Mistakes result in lawsuits. &quot; Louis Rhodes , head of the Phoenix chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union , was more direct . &quot; Arpaio thinks he ' s Teddy Roosevelt running to the top of San Juan Hill , and his posse are a bunch of junior G-men who want to be Batman , &quot; Rhodes said . &quot; It ' s a comic-book version of crime fighting , and I ' m worried that something bad will eventually happen -- all_the ingredients are there. &quot; Moreover , in one of the fastest-growing regions in the country -- thanks to an influx of post-riot Southern Californians -- critics say such simplistic approaches , however catchy for campaign slogans and media coverage , are not permanent solutions . Others speculate that Arpaio , who has broken a campaign promise to be a one-term sheriff by announcing plans to seek reelection in 1997 , is orchestrating a future bid for higher office . Tossing the gauntlet in his own version of &quot; High_Noon , &quot; Arpaio says his critics are just &quot; jealous . . . that I ' m getting all_the publicity. &quot; &quot; But I ' ve got a method to my madness of publicity : I want to send a message to the bad_guys , &quot; said Arpaio , who has appeared on more_than two_dozen radio and TV_programs in the past month . &quot; I want them to know that it is so bad in my jail that they won ' t want to commit crimes here. &quot; That is a potent and popular message at a time when crime is the No . 1 concern here and across the nation . While some peg Arpaio , and his high-profile programs , as opportunistic pandering to the fears of the crowd , it is precisely what many merchants , politicians and residents want in this Western boom_town . &quot; The sheriff is trying to throw a scare into criminals and there are some people here that could use a little bit of a scare , &quot; said Gilbert Hernandez , 68 , who lives_in an unincorporated southwest section of the city the sheriff says is rife_with crime . &quot; I think he ' s doing a good job. &quot; Phoenix lawyer Gary Klahr disagrees , saying that inmates in Arpaio ' s cramped , brown tents are treated as &quot; subhuman &quot; even though &quot; a lot of them are only beginning felons in work-furlough programs. &quot; &quot; There is a potential for people dying_out there , &quot; Klahr said . Under the county jail system ' s work-furlough program , inmates assigned to tents are allowed to go_to their jobs during the day but must return at night . Gripes about heat and harsh living conditions in the tent facility are music to Arpaio ' s ears . &quot; I want my jails to be a deterrent to crime and that ' s why we went from R-rated movies to Donald Duck . Nobody liked Donald Duck , so I wiped all movies out , &quot; Arpaio said with a self-satisfied smile during a tour of the facility . Two dozen inmates mopped their steamy brows and tried to look alert when the man with a shiny six-point star on his chest suddenly marched into their sweltering tent and bellowed , &quot; Why ' s it so hot in here ? You got a cooler , don ' t you ? &quot; &quot; The cooler don ' t work ! &quot; several inmates said in unison . &quot; How ' s the bologna sandwiches ? &quot; Arpaio asked . &quot; Green ! &quot; they shouted . In fact , the bologna can be green , red or blue on any given day . that ' s because jail cold cuts are bought from a distributor who gives hefty discounts on discolored meat that , while safe to eat , is unsuitable for_sale elsewhere . Arpaio laughed aloud when another inmate chortled , &quot; Hey , Sheriff , when you gonna be_on television again ? &quot; He told the inmate to watch TV the following night . &quot; Eight p.m. NBC . Tom Brokaw , &quot; he said . None of Arpaio ' s programs better displays his true character -- his commitment to fighting crime , his loyalty to supporters , or his flamboyant style -- than the posse , which counts Gov . Fife Symington among its members . Arpaio contends it has saved the county millions of dollars . It costs taxpayers $ 240 to train a posse member to use a gun -- a bargain when compared to the hours of free_time the members devote to helping his 453 full-time deputies , Arpaio said . So far , about 800 posse members have had the training to win permission to carry weapons on_duty . Bill Glenn , 61 , a retired utility company worker , has undergone more_than 150 hours of police training and spent $ 1 # 200 of_his_own money on leather utility belts , a pistol , uniforms and other items . &quot; My main reason for doing this is to take the load off a department that is short-handed in sworn deputies , &quot; Glenn said after helping deputies handle a man caught with a half a pound of marijuana in his car . &quot; Yep , I ' m making my valley a little safer tonight. &quot; No one here doubts the commitment or courage of posse members such_as Glenn , who once used pepper spray to prevent a suspect from slashing him with a broken bottle . Problem is , so many prospective volunteers are applying that background checks have been delayed , and admission standards have dropped , according to an internal memorandum written by Sheriff ' s Lt . Roy Reyer in March -- a_few days before Arpaio first unleashed his posse on prostitutes trolling downtown Phoenix ' s scruffy Van Buren Street . Reyer , who was transferred from a community relations position in Phoenix to a substation about 20 miles west of town shortly after his memo hit Arpaio ' s desk , wrote that posse recruitment standards had fallen so low that members included &quot; Rambos , Otis the town drunk , and a lot of washed-out cop wanna-bes. &quot; &quot; In one instance , a new posse man was given the assignment of treasurer of the Operations Posse , &quot; the memo said . &quot; Over $ 5 # 000 of this posse ' s funds were in his control . A background check of this individual later showed that he had an outstanding out-of-state warrant for fraud. &quot; Arpaio acknowledged that &quot; as in any organization , there are a_few bad apples in the posse. &quot; But they are quickly identified and rejected , the sheriff said , dismissing most of Reyer ' s accusations as &quot; garbage. &quot; Never mind that several volunteers have been kicked_off the posse for showing_up intoxicated or packing concealed weapons at training sessions . Or that some deputies worry that overly zealous volunteers jeopardize bystanders and pose liability problems for the county . For Arpaio , whose office is short 30 deputies and 130 detention officers , the posse is a practical response to rising crime in a county facing a severe budget_deficit . &quot; Let ' s say the county Board of Supervisors says , ' Sorry , Sheriff , we just went bankrupt , ' &quot; said Arpaio , who earns $ 65 # 000 a year . &quot; What do I have waiting in the weeds ? A posse . I can still protect the public. &quot; The posse got a chance to sharpen its law_enforcement skills during an intensive crackdown against shopping_mall crime last Christmas , and in April during the sweep against prostitution on Van Buren Street . The mall effort was a success . But the assault on prostitution was at best a stop-gap measure . While the deputies and posse members were patrolling the street , crime dropped_by 91 % . Van Buren merchants say it ' s been climbing ever since they left . Similar grumblings are being heard in southwest Phoenix , which Arpaio flooded_in late June with 700 armed posse members , special tactics teams , canine units , helicopters , armored cars and support units . The invasion , dubbed Operation Summer Heat , was aimed at clearing drug dealers and gang members from a largely low-income region dominated by cotton farms and auto wreckage firms . Arpaio said the effort was justified because there have been seven murders in the region in the past five months . During the monthlong operation , he said , deputies and posse members interrogated 5 # 577 people and arrested 605 of them on charges ranging from drug possession to outstanding warrants . Many of those suspects were originally stopped for vehicle code violations . That approach doesn ' t wash with many residents who live and work in the targeted area . Among the dissenters is CeCe Maxwell , owner of a bar around the corner from Operation Summer Heat ' s mobile command_post . &quot; I think it ' s stupid . Dumb . A total joke . Hogwash , &quot; she said . &quot; All they ' re doing is stopping people for traffic violations . There are people out here without much money and who happen to have car problems , but that doesn ' t mean they ' re bad. &quot; Arpaio ' s response : &quot; Even if there was no crime , what ' s wrong with going_out there to deter crime before it happens ? &quot; Such remarks have some people wondering whether Arpaio is just one more in a line of top cops who have raised questions about the office ' s professionalism over the past decade . Arpaio ' s predecessor , Tom Agnos , lost his bid for reelection over accusations of flawed interrogation and evidence gathering in the massacre of six Buddhist monks , two young initiates and an elderly nun here in 1991 . In that case , the sheriff ' s office extracted four false confessions to the murders . The so-called Tucson four were cleared of murder_charges in late 1991 when two teen-agers told investigators they acted alone in killing the Buddhists during a botched robbery at the temple . Agnos followed Dick Godbehere , who was criticized by federal authorities for &quot; staging &quot; a drug bust for the media in 1985 . Godbehere entered office on the heels of Jerry Hill , who lost a reelection bid in 1984 amid allegations of using his county car and filing travel expenses for a trip to New Mexico to marry his ninth wife . &quot; Most of our sheriffs lose reelection under a cloud , &quot; Klahr said . &quot; It ' s all part of the strange history of Maricopa County sheriffs. &quot; Arpaio began his law_enforcement career when he joined the Washington , D.C. , Police_Department in 1954 . Four years later , he signed_on with the DEA , where he spent 30 years as an agent and director of offices here and abroad . Arpaio retired from federal law_enforcement in 1982 as head of the DEA in Arizona , and he and his wife of 37 years , Ava , opened a travel_agency in Phoenix . They have two grown children . &quot; With that background I became sheriff , &quot; Arpaio said . &quot; I ' m the first Italian ever elected sheriff &quot; ( in the county ) . I ' m the first ex-federal agent ever elected sheriff . I ' m the oldest guy ever elected sheriff . And I ' m probably the first East Coast guy ever elected sheriff in Arizona. &quot; Arpaio ' s greatest challenge , critics say , will be to emerge from his first term unscathed and restore credibility to an office that has been dogged by controversy for years . &quot; Maybe I ' ve been lucky , maybe the roof will cave_in , &quot; Arpaio said . &quot; But I want to make a difference . If I fail , at least I gave it a shot. &quot;</TEXT>
