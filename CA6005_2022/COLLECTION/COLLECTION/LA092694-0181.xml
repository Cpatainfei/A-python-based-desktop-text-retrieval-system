   <TEXT> Watch Boris Yeltsin ' s barrel chest as the Russian leader meets President Clinton for their fifth summit Tuesday . If it is thrust especially proudly , if his labored imitation of an American smile is especially wide , if his performance in the now-familiar Bill-and-Boris Show looks more relaxed than ever , there will be reason . For the first time in his three years as president of Russia , Yeltsin can face his American counterpart buoyed by the best kind of success at_home : not just his slaying of the Communist dragon , not the bitter victory that came of turning tanks on_his_own Parliament last October , but the most Herculean achievement of all -- taking Russia from turmoil to stability . &quot; We can see now that Yeltsin is in full control , &quot; Sergei Chugayev , political commentator for the Izvestia newspaper , wrote last week . &quot; Full control &quot; is going a bit far . After all , Russia is still being bled by gangsters and corrupt bureaucrats , and the best that can be said of its economy is that the long slump appears to have bottomed_out . Still , as this summit rolls_around , Yeltsin comes_to Washington able to sell American investors on Russia with a straight_face . Russian officials have even begun to boast of an imminent investment boom . &quot; The era of aid is over , &quot; said Alexander Livshitz , Yeltsin ' s top economic adviser . Russia no longer needs handouts , he said , now that it can offer &quot; what it couldn ' t in past years -- I mean political stability and a half-year of moderate inflation. &quot; The Clinton-Yeltsin summit agenda includes talks on Bosnia-Herzegovina , the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization and global peacekeeping . Yeltsin will warm_up to those themes in a speech to the U.N. General_Assembly today , spelling out Russia ' s evolving post-Cold War foreign_policy . But his prime objective this trip is to court American capitalists . He will meet this morning with business_leaders in New York , and for the first time , four captains of American industry have been invited to join part of a summit in the Oval Office . Accompanying Yeltsin are dozens of hopeful suitors for American_capital , from the head of the beleaguered ZIL auto_maker to the creators of the world ' s largest cargo plane . After he meets with Clinton on Tuesday and Wednesday , Yeltsin will spend his summit &quot; free day &quot; in Seattle , where he will bestow his presence on Boeing Co. , which has been actively developing ventures in Russia . Yeltsin ' s pitch to American business includes : inflation chopped from double_digits to 5 % or so per month ; a crop of privatized factories willing to sell large chunks of themselves to foreign owners , and new or planned decrees offering tax_breaks and investment guarantees . And just in case stability doesn ' t work as a sales pitch , Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev reverted last week to an old scare tactic . He reminded readers of the Kommersant Daily newspaper that if Russia ' s economic development is stymied , the government could be taken_over by extremists -- and &quot; after that , we could simply forget any discussion about partnership with the West. &quot; Economics aside , the long-touted Russian-American partnership in politics is likely to be tested gently this week as the two countries work_out their post-Cold War strategies . The Americans , for example , hope to air their deep concerns about Russia ' s control of its nuclear arsenal -- from its highly publicized leaks of black-market plutonium to its inability to meet treaty schedules for destroying its missiles . On Sunday , Sen . Sam Nunn , the Georgia Democrat and chairman of the Armed Services Committee , said on NBC ' s &quot; Meet the Press &quot; that Russian control over nuclear_weapons remains &quot; the most important challenge we have in national security for the next 10 or 12 years. &quot; The two presidents are expected to sign a technical agreement that will include unprecedented U.S.-Russian exchanges of information on the nuclear materials they have in their stockpiles . U.S. officials say they will also push plans for a $ 75-million nuclear warehouse and a $ 30-million computerized system to track Russian nuclear stockpiles . Nuclear smuggling , however , is a ticklish issue for the Russians ; many in Moscow suspect that the United States is blowing the danger out of proportion to gain access to Moscow ' s nuclear secrets and direct control of its arsenal . But there appears to be little controversy over the proposed agreement , and Clinton ' s reported plan to offer more American money for Russian missile-dismantling is sure to go_over well with the needy Kremlin . No new arms control initiatives are expected . Both countries say they are content for now to coordinate unilateral moves without nailing them down with treaties , as they did_in January when they stopped aiming their missiles at each other . If any discussion is likely to grow heated , it could be the talks on Bosnia . Yeltsin , like his French and British counterparts , opposes Clinton ' s plan to seek a lifting of the arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims if Bosnian Serbs do not accept an international peace plan by Oct . 15 . The two presidents could also find the going rocky as they discuss their countries ' overall missions in the world . Moscow is seeking recognition that it retains a &quot; sphere_of_influence &quot; in most of the former Soviet empire , where it wants to be the policeman-of-record and enjoy some latitude in protecting the 25 million Russians who ended_up living &quot; abroad &quot; when the Soviet_Union collapsed . U.S. officials say they do not recognize such a Russian &quot; sphere of influence. &quot; In turn , they assert that Moscow must accept an inevitable eastward expansion of NATO to embrace Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic as full members . Yeltsin , with a wave of born-again ultranationalists at his back , cannot give_in easily to the spread of the Kremlin ' s old adversary . But overall , the trust and friendship that have grown between the new Russia and the United States are looking solid enough that even such clashes come_with a clink and not a crash . Clinton and Yeltsin have become such comfortable buddies that Yeltsin will even stay in Blair House , the official U.S. guest house , rather than at the Russian Embassy -- a first for a Kremlin leader . Andrei Kortunov , a top Russian foreign_policy analyst who helped prepare Yeltsin ' s U.N. address , may have summed_up the feel-good , easygoing atmosphere of this summit best when he allowed his description of foreign_policy differences to drift_off into open boredom . Yeltsin wants to show , he said , that &quot; Russia will have its own foreign and defense_policy independent of the West and . . . but at_the_same_time that does not necessarily mean that Russia is turning its back on the West and , you know , blah , blah , blah . . . . &quot; The Russian media have written almost nothing on this upcoming summit -- in contrast to the pre-Yeltsin era , when the meeting would have dominated every front page and broadcast for a week . &quot; There is a giant positive change behind this indifference , &quot; a commentary in Izvestia said recently . &quot; The summits no longer decide matters of peace and war , life and death. &quot; Goldberg reported from Washington and Boudreaux from Moscow . Times staff writer Doyle McManus also contributed to this report .</TEXT>
