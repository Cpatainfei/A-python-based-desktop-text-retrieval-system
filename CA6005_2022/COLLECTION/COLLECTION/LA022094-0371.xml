   <HEADLINE> ALLIED COMMANDERS FACE DAUNTING TASK ; MILITARY : AN AMERICAN OFFICER AND A BRITON WILL COORDINATE ANY AIR STRIKES . THEY CONFRONT EACH OTHER , THEIR SUPERIORS -- AND SERBS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If the United States and its NATO allies launch air strikes against the Bosnian Serbs , U.S. Adm . Jeremy Boorda and British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose are likely to end_up as the men in the middle . Should the Serbs fail to comply with today ' s 4 p.m. Pacific_time deadline to remove their artillery from within a 12-mile radius of Sarajevo or turn it over to U.N. peacekeeping troops , Rose , a British special forces commander in_charge of U.N. troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina , will make the initial recommendations on whether to begin the attacks . The blunt-spoken Boorda commands the NATO air armada that would carry them out . Both are widely recognized as competent , decisive officers with proven combat records . Rose secured the orderly surrender of the Falkland Islands by the invading Argentines in the 1982 war . Boorda has run the NATO operation enforcing a U.N.-imposed &quot; no-fly &quot; zone over Bosnia . But military experts say their biggest frustrations are likely to come when they attempt to get their respective organizations to agree clearly on what the allied forces should do_in Bosnia . &quot; Their biggest challenge will be in dealing with the NATO command structure and the U.N. command structure -- particularly with those who are making the political and diplomatic decisions , &quot; said retired U.S. Marine Lt . Gen . Bernard E . Trainor . &quot; The military_action will be fairly straightforward. &quot; Indeed , bureaucratic entanglements already have clouded the allied operation in Bosnia . In a major embarrassment , the two organizations split sharply last week over what it would take_for the Serbs to meet the NATO deadline . The North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization said the Serbs must move their artillery 12 miles from Sarajevo , while U.N. commanders insisted that they could keep their guns in place . Rose and Boorda have since worked_out a compromise , but they were forced to negotiate amid a raft of second-guessing -- and conflicting signals -- by political officials , which some analysts said could give the Serbs just the opening they needed to equivocate . Compounding the difficulty of coordinating any military_action , insiders say , are the two leaders ' decidedly different operating styles . They diverge markedly in their views on the use of force , a factor that could heighten tensions even further . The 54-year-old Rose , a tall , lean , smooth-talking , Oxford-educated infantry officer with an old-school charm and a penchant for the unusual , is known as a risk-taker who often comes_up with creative solutions . At the peak of the Falklands War , for example , after leading a series of commando raids against enemy troops , he used psychological_warfare to help bring_about a settlement , once breaking_into a radio program to deliver a message to Argentine military_leaders . A few years before , he had won a reputation for derring-do in a rescue of 19 hostages who were being held during a siege at the Iranian Embassy in London . The dramatic gun battle , waged by Rose ' s black-hooded Special Air Service soldiers , was carried live_on TV . By contrast , Boorda , 55 , a short , stocky , pipe-smoking , high_school dropout who joined the Navy -- illegally -- at age 16 and rose to destroyer captain , is a quintessential policy-maker and planner . Although both have made the obligatory assertions that the West will launch air strikes if the Serbs do not obey allied orders , Rose -- in a move that appears to be out of character -- seems to have sought to avoid armed confrontation , even at the risk of undercutting the NATO ultimatum . Early this week , he initially dismissed NATO demands that the Serbs obey the NATO ultimatum to the letter , then blithely reversed himself after the United States -- and other key NATO governments -- reacted in horror . U.S. officials are convinced that once the deadline has passed , Rose will do everything possible to avert ordering air strikes , as long as the Serbs provide him with even the slightest excuse to say that they are cooperating . Boorda , on the other hand , is a disciple of the hard-line U.S. doctrine that says once the allies have threatened to employ military_force , they should not hesitate to do_it with sufficient power to uphold their credibility . And he has said so several times in public . Besides their significant policy differences , the two men also must contend with the continuing split between NATO and the United Nations over how to handle the situation in Bosnia . U.N. policy-makers , more reluctant to use force on general principle , are especially wary in this case because the United Nations has about 13 # 000 peacekeeping troops on the ground -- British , French , Canadian , Spanish and Dutch -- who would be vulnerable to retaliation if the Serbs became angered . Since these same countries are key powers in NATO , the alliance is split internally -- a factor that has influenced both bodies ' deliberations for months . While some NATO countries are loath to launch air strikes , others support them , if only to bolster NATO ' s credibility . Complicating the overall situation is the fact that the Serbs and Muslims -- much like the Iraqis -- are masters at testing allied resolve . They move to within inches of a Western-set line in the sand and then pull_back before NATO can muster the will to act . Analysts say that , in turn , is likely to make clear-cut decisions even more difficult . To be sure , Boorda and Rose are not the first military_officers to experience problems with their political_bosses . French Gen . Jean Cot , commander of U.N. forces in the former Yugoslav federation , has been cut_out of the decision-making in Bosnia . Although not yet relieved by his successor , he has been fired for criticizing U.N. control . &quot; I have spent a good_part of my energy preserving my freedom of action ( from the constraints of the U.N. bureaucracy ) to the detriment of my essential mission , &quot; he wrote in a still-unreleased departure letter to U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali . The Rose-Boorda relationship may_not have to weather more_than a_couple_of weeks . The admiral has been tapped to succeed Adm . Frank B . Kelso II as U.S. chief of naval operations and will be leaving his NATO post in mid-March . Rose will stay_on indefinitely . Times staff writers Carol J . Williams in Sarajevo and William Tuohy in London contributed to this report .</TEXT>
