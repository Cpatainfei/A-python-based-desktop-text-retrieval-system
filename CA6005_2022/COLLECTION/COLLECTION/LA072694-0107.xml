   <HEADLINE> A JOB STILL TO BE DONE ; FOR MANY , DISABILITIES ACT HASN ' T LIVED UP TO PROMISE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Many foresaw a social revolution two years ago when the sweeping civil_rights law called the Americans With Disabilities Act took_effect in the nation ' s larger workplaces . But for people such_as Linda Sturgeon , 41 , who suffers from disabling muscular_dystrophy , freedom from job discrimination remains elusive . Sturgeon says she could not get her old job back last year when -- after having worked for her local telephone_company in Rochester , N.Y. , for 21 years -- she took a five-month leave to recover from injuries suffered in an auto accident . Her attorney , Lonny H . Dolin , contends that the company , which calls the situation &quot; complicated , &quot; rebuffed Sturgeon because it wanted to eliminate the supposed extra costs of employing a disabled worker . Dolin said the pending legal dispute exemplifies the &quot; truest reason &quot; why the ADA , as the anti-discrimination statute is known , has been needed . Yet the law , which expands today to cover workplaces with as few as 15 employees , is far from fulfilling one of its central promises : to bring disabled adults into the mainstream of American life by removing barriers to getting jobs . In California -- where state law has long protected people with disabilities at firms with as few as five employees -- the ADA has mainly heightened awareness of workers ' rights . Nationwide , the ADA has so far benefited only &quot; a small group of people , &quot; said Guy Wallace , an employment discrimination specialist with Disability Rights Advocates , a nonprofit group in Oakland . With discrimination so deep-seated , he said , &quot; it ' s going_to take a while to make any headway. &quot; Figures are scarce on how extensive joblessness is among the disabled , a group the federal_government broadly defines to include nearly 49 million people . But according to a poll released last week by Louis Harris &amp; Associates and the National Organization on Disability , two-thirds of working-age Americans with disabilities are jobless -- roughly the same level a similar survey found eight years ago . Disability rights activists hope the pace of change will soon pick_up . With the ADA ' s expansion today , 86 % of the work_force will be covered . Under the previous cutoff level -- firms with at least 25 employees -- the law covered 77 % of U.S. workers . Among major employers , including many that two years ago feared lawsuits and high expenses from making required &quot; reasonable accommodations &quot; for disabled workers , the reviews on the ADA are mixed . &quot; Have there been screams of pain ? No , &quot; said Susan Meisinger , a lawyer with the Society for Human Resource Management , a national association of personnel specialists . She quickly added , however , that there have been &quot; pockets of abuse. &quot; And although some employers complain about the sheer number of ADA cases , disability-related claims filed with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission are still far less frequent than those alleging race and sex discrimination . Over the long_run , advocates for the disabled say , the ADA ' s benefits to society will far outweigh any burden on employers . &quot; What ' s burdensome is paying $ 100 billion a year in welfare to people who should be working , &quot; Wallace said . Yet ADA critics contend that the law has both failed to help the disabled and led to unjustified lawsuits against employers . &quot; It ' s just another law that people use when they are unhappy about being terminated , &quot; Los Angeles management lawyer Frank Cronin said , citing government figures showing that the largest_number of ADA suits are filed by people who claim they were fired illegally . Some experts contend that the broadening of the ADA ' s reach will open_up nasty new legal battlefields . Big companies , the argument goes , typically have human-resources specialists and lawyers to coach them on how to adapt to the ADA . But small firms , they say , often lack the sophistication to stay_on top of changes in employment law , making them potential targets for lawsuits . Advocates for the disabled counter that , in most cases , wrongful-termination cases and other employment claims stem from genuine abuses by employers unwilling to accommodate disabled workers . Dolin said her client , Sturgeon , found herself in just such circumstances when she tried to return to work as a repair service clerk at Rochester Telephone in April , 1993 . Sturgeon , as someone who occasionally needs help entering the office and getting_in and out of her wheelchair , &quot; is seen as a problem &quot; by the company , Dolin said . &quot; My life has been taken_away from me , &quot; Sturgeon said . A Rochester Telephone spokeswoman declined to comment in detail . She said Sturgeon technically remains an employee and that , as a matter of policy , the company does not discuss legal claims by employees . Dolin , a prominent disability plaintiffs lawyer , contends that enlightened employers can avoid such disputes . She cited another Rochester-based employer , Paychex Inc. , and the way it has worked with John Hoyle , a quadriplegic who is a computer analyst with the company . Hoyle , a onetime competitive swimmer who was disabled when he broke his neck in a diving accident , said the company ' s job interviewers were &quot; very gracious &quot; when he applied for work -- they did such things as remove a chair from the interview room so he would not have a problem entering in a wheelchair . After Hoyle landed the job , Paychex supplied him with a wireless_telephone headset and equipped the employee entrance so he could open the door by remote_control . All in all , Hoyle said , at the company he is &quot; on an equal footing with co-workers . . . . To me , that ' s the greatest reward. &quot; Boom in Disability Discrimination Cases In the two years since the Americans With Disabilities Act took_effect in the workplace , disability-related claims have mounted . Here are employment discrimination charges received by the federal_government during the first_half of its current fiscal_year .
