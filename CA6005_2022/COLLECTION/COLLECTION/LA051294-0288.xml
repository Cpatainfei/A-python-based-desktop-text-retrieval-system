   <HEADLINE> INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ; BUNDESBANK LOWERS TWO KEY LENDING RATES HALF A POINT ; ECONOMY : GERMAN CENTRAL_BANK ' S MOVE TRIGGERS OTHER CUTS IN EUROPE . ANALYSTS HAD EXPECTED A SMALLER REDUCTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Bundesbank cut two key German lending rates by half a percentage_point Wednesday , setting_off a round of interest_rate cutting elsewhere in Europe and triggering speculation that Germany ' s all-important strategy of gradual monetary easing may soon come_to an end . Many analysts were surprised by the size of the reductions . Smaller cuts had been expected , in_line with international central_bank efforts to stabilize the U.S. dollar . &quot; The cut_in rates is a help for the U.S. dollar , even without the activities of the Federal_Reserve , &quot; said Norbert Walter , chief economist for Deutsche Bank , referring to last week ' s massive round of central_bank intervention to support the dollar , led by the Federal_Reserve_Bank of New York and the Bundesbank . &quot; I am pretty sure that the Americans will follow ( with a corresponding interest_rate increase ) on May 17. &quot; The dollar started at 1.6641 to the mark , rose to 1.6810 during the day and closed at 1.6750. The Bundesbank cut the German discount_rate -- the lowest rate on loans to commercial_banks -- to 4.5 % from 5 % , while the Lombard rate , which is the rate on emergency loans to banks unable to find money elsewhere , was cut_to 6 % from 6.5 % . Gradual reductions in German interest_rates are widely seen as essential to overall economic recovery in Europe . But after Wednesday ' s cuts , some Bundesbank watchers were saying that Germany ' s central bankers have taken their rate-cutting policy as far as they can , until they have proof that German inflation is really under_control . &quot; Further lowering of the discount_rate likely will follow only after solid evidence that the Bundesbank ' s strategy of slowing M3 growth by cutting interest_rates has worked , and after inflation has declined further , &quot; a group of economic analysts at Salomon Bros . International Ltd . predicted in a statement . M3 is a measure of liquidity in a nation ' s economy and is closely watched by German monetary analysts as an early indicator of inflationary pressure . Germany ' s M3 money_supply grew substantially faster than expected in the first months of this year -- by more_than 15 % in March , compared to a Bundesbank target growth_rate of 6 % . Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said Wednesday that he hoped the generous interest_rate reduction would encourage investors to take their money out of bank_deposits -- a component of M3 -- and put it into long-term paper assets . Such assets are not included in the M3 calculation and therefore do not put pressure on that particular measurement of the money_supply . &quot; Today ' s decision will help make investments in long-term securities more attractive , &quot; Tietmeyer said , adding that the Bundesbank continues to view money_supply control as &quot; decisive. &quot; Tietmeyer said the Bundesbank believes that inflation is indeed under_control and that the economy in Germany is improving . Inflation in Germany was running at 3.1 % in April , down from 3.2 % in March , and Bundesbank officials have predicted it will drop below 3 % soon . &quot; The outlook for ( economic ) stability has continued to improve , and the deutsche_mark is strong , &quot; Tietmeyer said . Italy , Austria , Belgium , Denmark and the_Netherlands all reduced key interest_rates after the Bundesbank ' s move . The Bank of France reduced rates by cutting its key intervention rate , or the floor to French money_market rates , to 5.5 % from 5.6 % .</TEXT>
