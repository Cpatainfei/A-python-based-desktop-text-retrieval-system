   <HEADLINE> DUCKS LOOK FOR SOLUTIONS TO SCORING DROUGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Troy Loney stood_in the center of the Mighty Duck dressing room , rubbing his chin while pondering a question . It took a moment to search the memory banks of his 11 NHL seasons , but he had the answer . &quot; I don ' t think three , &quot; he said . &quot; Two a_couple_of times , but not three. &quot; Loney wasn ' t the only one searching for answers Wednesday . The Ducks established a dubious first , extending_to 188 minutes 23 seconds -- more_than three full games -- their scoreless streak . This time the Buffalo Sabres and goaltender Dominik Hasek pinned a shutout on the Ducks . For the record , the 3-0 score means the Ducks have been outscored , 12-0 , in losses to San Jose on Sunday , Chicago on Tuesday and Buffalo on Wednesday . To be sure , Arturs Irbe , Ed Belfour and Hasek are tough goalies to beat , but the Ducks would n ' t pin their offensive woes on anyone but themselves . &quot; We can ' t just flick a switch and change things , &quot; said Todd Ewen , who probably wishes he could . The Ducks haven ' t scored since the third_period of a 6-3 victory over the last-place Edmonton Oilers Friday . The honor went_to Joe Sacco , whose power-play goal proved to be the the game clincher . Since Friday , the Ducks have fired 80 shots at opposing goalies and come_away empty . &quot; It ' s very frustrating right now , &quot; Sacco said . &quot; We ' re in a little bit of a drought right now . We ' ve played well , but not quite good_enough . We ' ve got_to stay positive . It ' s easy to get_down . When you lose three in a row , you start shaking your head. &quot; No one cracked a stick over the boards at the final buzzer . No one chucked equipment around the dressing room . On the ice , the Ducks might simply be trying too hard , according to Ewen . &quot; We ' re definitely pressing in the corners , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re getting caught with three guys behind the net . We ' ve got_to change that , get guys back where they ' re supposed to be and stick_to defensive hockey . &quot; The first goal we get isn ' t going_to be a pretty goal . It won ' t be tic-tac-toe top shelf . It ' ll probably be ugly , off somebody ' s butt and into the net . &quot; The only way ( to score ) is to shoot as often as possible. &quot; The Ducks ' playoff aspirations are probably history now , but there remains much to be accomplished . For starters , they need to take each part of their next game and master it , hoping all_the little things lead to something good . At least that ' s Ewen ' s theory . &quot; We need to go_out and win the next game , work hard on the next shift , &quot; he said . &quot; Our defensive game is very important . It ' s baby steps all_the way. &quot; Loney , the team ' s captain , has noticed only one change and it ' s not a good one . &quot; We ' re all frustrated , &quot; he said . &quot; It wears_on you . We have to stay in the positive frame_of_mind . We can ' t just let it knock us out of the playoffs. &quot;</TEXT>
