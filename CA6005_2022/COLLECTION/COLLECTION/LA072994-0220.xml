   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS : DOLLAR RALLIES AGAINST YEN ; STOCKS RISE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The dollar jumped above the psychologically important level of 100 Japanese yen on Thursday , on growing expectations of a breakthrough in trade negotiations between the United States and Japan . Stocks , meanwhile , got a small boost from falling bond yields , and both markets were helped by the dollar ' s strength . The Dow Jones industrials inched up 10.36 points to 3 # 730.83. In New York , the dollar surged to 100.10 yen , up from 98.55 on Wednesday . It was the dollar ' s first close above the 100-yen mark since June 27 . The dollar also finished stronger against the German mark , rising to 1.591 marks from 1.574. Buoying the U.S. currency : American and Japanese trade negotiators were scheduled to meet today for talks , ahead of the Sunday deadline Washington had previously set for deciding whether to take steps toward trade sanctions against Japan . &quot; There is a suspicion in the market that there will potentially be an agreement before the deadline , &quot; said Peter Gloyne , a currency trader at First National_Bank of Chicago . Without an accord to cut Japan ' s huge surplus with the United States , currency markets may figure that a weaker dollar is the Clinton_Administration ' s only potential weapon in the battle . With an accord , however , markets may assume that the dollar will begin to strengthen again , and that the Administration may abet that . Talk_of the potential for a trade accord took_hold in the market even as American officials played_down the possibility . Late in the day , Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky , who was to participate in today ' s talks , said there had been &quot; minimum progress &quot; in earlier discussions in Hong Kong . In Tokyo today , the dollar dropped_back to 99.75 yen in mid-morning trading . In the U.S. bond market Thursday , yields pulled_back after jumping_on Wednesday . The yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury_bond finished at 7.55 % , down from 7.61 % Wednesday . Traders said the dollar ' s sudden strength was a positive for bonds because a stronger U.S. currency would tend to attract more foreign investment to U.S. securities . Also lending a degree of support to the bond market was a report by the Conference Board that help-wanted advertising fell_in June , suggesting a slower economy . Markets will get another key look_at the economy ' s fundamentals today , when the government reports on second-quarter gross_domestic_product ( GDP ) growth . Many economists estimate that GDP expanded at about a 3.8 % pace in the quarter . A significantly higher number could spark renewed expectations that the Federal_Reserve_Board will tighten credit for a fifth time this year . The stock_market , despite a minor rally Thursday , was in a cautious mood ahead of the GDP news . The Dow had been up as much as 21 points early in the day . In the broad market , advancing issues edged out decliners by just 1 # 073 to 1 # 003 on the New York Stock_Exchange . Trading volume remained moderate . Among the market highlights : * Industrial stocks attracted some renewed buying . 3M Co . gained 1 1 / 8 to 52 1 / 2 after reporting record quarterly earnings . Other industrial issues rising on earnings news included Dow Chemical , up 1 / 2 to 68 1 / 8 ; Hercules , up 3 / 4 to 106 , and Duracell , up 7 / 8 to 41 5 / 8 . * GM shares inched up 3 / 8 to 50 1 / 4 after its earnings beat forecasts . But the stock remains just above its 1994 low of 49 1 / 2 , and well below the high of 65 3 / 8 . Ford gained 5 / 8 to 31 and Chrysler edged_up 1 / 4 to 47 3 / 8 . * Among technology issues , Irvine-based computer maker AST Research lost 1 1 / 4 to 13 3 / 4 after reporting quarterly earnings of 43 cents a share , one penny below expectations . * In the health-care sector , Southland managed-care company Wellpoint Health tumbled 5 1 / 2 to 25 after its second quarter results fell below analysts ' forecasts . Wellpoint said it was forced to make higher payments to some of its health-care providers under new California laws and regulatory interpretations that expanded the scope of health benefits offered to small groups and individuals . * Weakness also persisted_in some health-maintenance organization stocks Thursday . U.S. Healthcare fell 1 to 36 1 / 2 , United Healthcare dropped 1 3 / 8 to 42 3 / 4 and Foundation Health lost 1 1 / 8 to 35 . * LDDS Communications gained 1 / 4 to 19 on a report that it is close to acquiring the Williams Cos. ' WilTel long-distance telephone business for $ 2.5 billion . Williams shares jumped 1 5 / 8 to 32 7 / 8 . But renewed rumors that LDDS will bid for Culver City-based IDB Communications failed to help IDB ' s shares . The stock fell 3 / 8 to 10 . LDDS is said to be waiting for a review of IDB ' s finances by its new auditors , who were brought_in last spring after IDB ' s original auditors quit in a dispute with the firm . * Biogen , which surged 15 1 / 4 Wednesday on news of promising results in a trial of its drug for treating multiple_sclerosis , eased 1 1 / 8 to 43 5 / 8 .
