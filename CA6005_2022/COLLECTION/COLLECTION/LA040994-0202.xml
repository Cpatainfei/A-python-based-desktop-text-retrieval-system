   <HEADLINE> ' THE PROPER SPIRITS ' ; FIRST BOTTLES OF JAPANESE BEER ROLL OFF VALLEY LINE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the ceremonial tossing of rice by a Shinto priest , the first Japanese beer ever manufactured in the United States for large-scale sale in Japan rolled_off the assembly_lines at the Van Nuys Anheuser-Busch plant , opening the door to expanding trade . The new product , Kirin Ice Beer , came_off the line at a rate of 2 # 000 cans per minute after being blessed by the Rev . Alfred Y . Tsuyuki , Shinto priest of the Konko Church of Los Angeles . &quot; It ' s a ceremony filled with the proper spirits , &quot; said Tsuyuki , who said the practice of blessing beer at the start of manufacturing is regularly done_in Japan to purify the product . Anheuser-Busch officials , who said it was the first time their beer had been blessed , were more excited about being the first United States brewery to manufacture a Japanese beer for export to Japan . &quot; This is the big win -- trade and jobs for people who make the beer , &quot; said Stephen J . Burrows , president and chief operating officer of Anheuser-Busch International Inc. , which is manufacturing Kirin Ice Beer for Kirin Brewery Co . Ltd . in Tokyo . &quot; This is the first trial in the history of the Japanese beer industry to ask an American brewer to produce a Japanese brand and export it to Japan on a big scale , &quot; said Kazuhisa Tani , director of international planning for Kirin . &quot; We can quickly introduce the beer into the Japanese market without having to construct a new brewery. &quot; Although Kirin is the largest beer manufacturer in Japan , Tani said the company wanted to avail itself of Anheuser-Busch ' s exclusive ice-brewing technique to manufacture the beer . Last year , the two companies established a joint_venture in Japan called Budweiser Japan Company Ltd. , which markets and sells Budweiser in Japan . According to Burrows , 99 # 360 , 000 cans of beer will be sent to Japan by May . Anheuser-Busch officials said no new jobs will be created to produce the initial batch , but industry experts were optimistic that it could mean more job security and more hiring if the venture is successful . Currently , imported beer only represents 2 % of market sales in Japan . Tani said he believes this project will triple that amount . &quot; For the brewing industry , this is quite a remarkable transaction , &quot; said Robert S . Weinberg , president of R . S . Weinberg and Associates in St . Louis , an independent analyst for the beer industry . &quot; In the long_run , it could create significantly more jobs if it is the first of many ventures. &quot; If Friday ' s beer blessing was any indication , the beer could do very well . Even Shinto priest Tsuyuki could not wait to get his robe off and grab a cold one . &quot; I ' m one of the biggest patrons , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
