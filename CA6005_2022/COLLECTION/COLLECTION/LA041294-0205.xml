   <HEADLINE> THE NO . 1 NUMBER : 911 ; CPR BUYS_TIME FOR VICTIMS OF CARDIAC ARREST , BUT BY ITSELF MAY NOT SAVE THEM , EXPERTS SAY . DIALING FOR HELP -- QUICKLY -- CAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Seahawks were about to kick_off at the Kingdome in Seattle when a fan clutched his chest and fell to the ground . As the football tumbled through the air , a group of fans turned their backs on the play and rushed to the stricken man . As one rescuer began pumping his chest , others lined_up to take_over . &quot; They were standing around , saying , ' It ' s my turn now , it ' s my turn , ' &quot; recalls Dr. Michael Copass , medical director of paramedic service for Seattle , where one out of every three citizens -- including all cab drivers and Kingdome beer vendors -- is trained in cardiopulmonary_resuscitation . But that wasn ' t what saved the fallen fan ' s life . It was the call someone made to 911 . According to new guidelines from the American Heart Assn . and the American Red_Cross , if you want to save a life , the first_step is to pick_up the phone . Although chest compressions and mouth-to-mouth breathing may prevent immediate brain damage , medical experts now agree that CPR alone does not save the lives of most adults whose hearts have stopped . What they need is defibrillation -- the application of 8 # 000 volts of electricity to jump-start quivering heart_muscle -- and for that , only an equipped ambulance or fire_truck will do . Throughout Los Angeles County , that means knowing 9-1-1 and it means dialing those numbers first -- even if it requires leaving the victim unattended to do so . &quot; Unless this is an infant or a child , the first thing you should do if you come_across an unconscious person is to pick_up the phone , &quot; says Dr. Samuel Stratton , medical director of Los Angeles County ' s emergency programs . &quot; CPR buys_time . But by itself , it is not going_to save the lives of most adults who go down. &quot; If the victim is a child , the first_step should always be to clear the airway and start CPR , including the Heimlich maneuver of repeated abdominal thrusts . &quot; Children don ' t stop breathing because they ' ve had a heart_attack . They stop breathing because they are in respiratory failure from pneumonia or trauma or drowning or something stuck_in the throat , &quot; Stratton says . But for adults who collapse , summoning professional medical help is more urgent than beginning CPR , say Stratton and others who helped prepare the new guidelines , which resulted from research that showed CPR alone was not saving many adult lives . For a cardiac_arrest victim to survive , CPR has to be started within four minutes and medical rescuers must jolt the heart with a defibrillator within eight minutes , experts say . When basketball star Hank Gathers collapsed in 1990 on a Loyola Marymount University court , two physicians rushed to his aid . But it was not until a trainer arrived with a defibrillator -- a disputed number of minutes later -- that an effort was made to shock his heart back into normal rhythm . Gathers ' family charged that the athlete might have been saved had he been defibrillated sooner . When CPR is combined with timely use of a defibrillator , Stratton says , the results can be near-miraculous . &quot; A few years ago , a man in his 40s -- a surfer and a businessman in the San Pedro area -- walked_out_of the bank and just collapsed . A friend immediately started CPR in the parking_lot while another witness rushed to call 911 . By the time he got_to the hospital , ( his friend ) had trouble convincing him he ' d nearly died , &quot; Stratton says . &quot; In fact , he ' d been dead for nearly a minute. &quot; * The key to survival for cardiac_arrest victims is how quickly a defibrillator reaches their sides . In Los Angeles County , the survival rate is 4.9 % -- about half the national average , but well above that for other major U.S. cities . In New York City , only 30 out of 2 # 329 of cardiac_arrest victims who were resuscitated survived and left the hospital , researchers reported last month in the Journal of the American Medical Assn . That study found that it took an average of 11.4 minutes for the city ' s emergency medical personnel to arrive and that the first electric_shock from a defibrillator was administered on average in 12.4 minutes -- generally too late to do any good . In Los Angeles County , it generally takes eight minutes or less -- &quot; a very respectable time for a huge urban system like ours , &quot; Stratton says . &quot; Here in the city . . . our average response_time is about 5 1 / 2 minutes , &quot; says Chief Alan Cowen of the fire_department ' s bureau of emergency medical services . &quot; But we can ' t help anybody until they let us know they need help , until they call 911. &quot; And , sometimes there are personal , even cultural roadblocks to emergency care . &quot; Some people are afraid of catching a disease if they help a stranger who is down , &quot; Stratton says . &quot; For them , we suggest first calling 911 and then if they don ' t want to do mouth to mouth , just do the chest compressions . Or use a sock or a shirt between your mouth and theirs. &quot; Milton Urquilla , community relations officer for the Los Angeles Fire_Department , says some immigrants may be reluctant to call authorities for fear they will be questioned about whether they are in this country legally . &quot; This is not something we do here . If you call us at 911 for help , we only want to help . We are not there looking_for anything or anyone else , only to provide emergency care. &quot; But the overriding reason many witnesses to cardiac_arrests or accidents don ' t help is their fear of doing something wrong or of hurting the victim . &quot; I can tell you from personal experience that fear strikes us all , &quot; says Stratton , who rescued his 5-year-old son from the family swimming_pool . &quot; I am an emergency physician who uses CPR almost every shift , but when I had to use it on my own child , I couldn ' t remember how to begin . . . . So I just started pumping and blowing , pumping and blowing in no particular order at first and it worked . That boy is a healthy 19-year-old today . &quot; The message is , just do something , &quot; Stratton says . &quot; The victim is essentially dead as it is . Pretty much anything you do will help . It ' s great if you can learn CPR and use it . But you can still save a life . The first and best thing to do is call 911 . And do_it fast. &quot; 6 Steps to Saving a Life Although CPR alone is not enough to save lives in most cardiac_arrest cases , it can buy_time until emergency medical help arrives . According to the &quot; American Heart Assn . Basic Life Support Heartsaver Guide , &quot; you should take the following six steps . Shake and shout : Shake victim and shout &quot; Are you OK ? &quot; Call victim ' s name if you know it . If no response , call 911 or local emergency number . Head tilt , chin lift : To clear victim ' s airway , tilt head back and lift chin_up . Two slow breaths : If victim is not breathing , blow two long ( two-second ) breaths into mouth . If chest does not rise , do Heimlich anti-choke maneuver to clear airway . Check pulse : If there is carotid ( neck ) pulse but no breathing , continue giving mouth-to-mouth , one breath every five seconds . Pump chest : If no pulse , pump chest 80 to 100 compressions per minute , followed by two slow breaths . Don ' t stop : Repeat until emergency rescue squad arrives or victim regains consciousness .</TEXT>
