   <HEADLINE> BEHIND THE WHEEL / PAUL DEAN : A FORD WITH A CORD ; READY TO UNPLUG FROM THE GAS_PUMP AND PLUG IN TO THE FUTURE ? THE ELECTRIC ECOSTAR WON ' T SHOCK YOU WITH SPECTACULAR PERFORMANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ford Motor Co. , working with hastened technology and a hesitant commitment , is introducing new_world electric motoring to the real_world -- worldwide . More_than 30 Ford Ecostars from an eventual test fleet of 100 -- the infant electric vehicle industry ' s largest assembly of rolling laboratories -- have already been delivered from Canada to Spain , from UPS in Sacramento to Commonwealth Edison in Chicago . By July , most of these electric buzzers -- based on two-seat , British-built mini-panel trucks -- will be reassigned by utilities leasing them to delivery services and a_few suburban families . Ford suggests , even insists , that test drivers use the vehicles as they would a gasoline-powered car . With only a 1-800 hot_line as a safety net should a driver ' s eyebrows start arcing during a rainstorm . &quot; That won ' t happen , &quot; says Ford spokesman John Clinard as he delivers a blue Ecostar , a 30-minute briefing , one field service electrician , several operating manuals and an additional piece of damp-driving advice : &quot; Feel free to take Ecostar through a car wash . &quot; The vehicle also has a range of 100 miles , will run at freeway speeds_up to 70 miles per hour , and you certainly will not have to stop at any service stations. &quot; Throughout seven days with Sparky , we stopped for nothing except daily destinations . The little van not only ran at freeway speeds , but actually passed many among the snorting , polluting , environmentally incorrect . It accelerated almost as well as the breeziest subcompacts and regularly chirped its tires -- experimental rubber inflated to 50 psi for reduced rolling resistance -- on ribald starts . And it held that crisp performance whether the battery was 100 % charged or dribbling flat . Sparky survived night trips , with headlights burning and the radio explaining why we were locked_in the four-lane metal ingot that is the San Diego Freeway these days . The 1-800 hot_line was not called ; gasoline-powered vehicles parked in reserve at both ends of the day ' s business were not needed ; fuses remained unblown and_circuits unbroken in the vehicle and at_home . At the end of 600 miles -- and recalling EVs driven since ecologists , futurists and governments began sentencing modern motoring to the electric_chair -- one conclusion is clear : Although short on performance extremes and expensive to purchase , Ford ' s Ecostar fits the crowded , sluggish mainstream of everyday commuting as well as any gasoline-powered counterpart . Will it impress Porsche purists and souls that surge to engine noise , hot energy and the challenge of fast , precise passage ? Nah . Can Ford bring it to market by the end of the century for under $ 50 # 000 ? Unlikely . But could Ecostar succeed as a local runabout where short-haul delivery capability , not spiritual self-indulgence , is the issue ? Absolutely . Throughout our no-quarter wring-out , each turn of Ecostar ' s wheels and every spin of its 300-volt motor were recorded by on-board black_boxes . So it is with the international test fleet . At the end of the 30-month evaluation , the 100 cars will be collected , data collated and Ford will be that much wiser in meeting The Mandate -- a 1990 order by the California Air Resources Board dictating that 2 % of all new vehicles sold in the state in 1998 will be emission-free , i.e. electric vehicles . Or manufacturers will lose their certification to sell in California . Detroit ' s Big Three -- pleading high costs , low performance , weak public interest in electric vehicles and retarded battery technology -- want the deadline rolled back . The ruling will be reviewed in May ; so far , the California board hasn ' t budged . &quot; We have a mandate to sell electric vehicles , &quot; says Pam Kueber , an environmental communications manager for Ford . &quot; Unfortunately , there is no mandate to buy. &quot; Meanwhile , domestic car builders have maintained reluctant electrical progress -- Chrysler with some experimental vans ; GM with its Impact , a two-place commuter car that will be shipped out for public testing later this year , and the Ecostar . Ford ' s brighter idea cost $ 100 million . That makes each test vehicle worth $ 1 million , a smug satisfaction when pulling alongside a Rolls-Royce on the Santa Ana Freeway . About $ 5 million was spent custom-developing a unique sodium-sulfur battery , hermetically sealed_in a stainless_steel thermos . It produces five times the driving range of a more conventional lead-acid battery weighing the same 770 pounds . Full resuscitation takes seven hours when plugged into a 220-volt system via a charging station no bigger than a one-suiter on wheels . Or 27 hours if hooked to a 110-volt household outlet . Partial recharging takes less time . There ' s 12 feet of on-board charging cord that reels through a small trap_door in the grille and into a housing beneath the hood where the engine used to be . The engine bay is now filled by the electronics center -- battery charging systems , inverters and a converter to charge a 12-volt battery for auxiliary accessories . Fuel costs , according to Ford ' s calculations , with all variables considered , should be about 2 cents a mile . That compares favorably to 6 cents a mile for an average gasoline-powered vehicle . Ford claims that the battery cannot leak , is virtually indestructible and no more volatile than 1.5 gallons of unleaded . The impact to release that energy , of course , would make guacamole out of car and all who rode in it . * Temperament and cost are downsides . To achieve maximum life and efficiency , the battery -- flat and invisible beneath the rear floor of the van -- maintains an optimum operating temperature of about 600 degrees Fahrenheit by eating its own power . Parked unplugged for 12 hours , the battery chills below critical levels and might not respond to recharge . And a replacement battery , even with the car in production , could cost about $ 15 # 000 . Under normal circumstances , says program manager Robert Kiessel , the life of an Ecostar battery would be &quot; guessing . . . at three to five years . It is almost entirely recyclable . &quot; We have done a terrific job of moving EV technology forward , yet we are criticized for a lack of commitment . We ' re not opposing the mandate because of knee-jerk negativism . We are concerned that rushing this technology into the marketplace is not going_to produce happy Ford customers. &quot; Ecostar is front-driven by a three-phase , 75-horsepower , AC electric_motor coupled to a single-speed transaxle . It ' s likely the only vehicle where freeway stops actually become something of a blessing -- because braking converts the motor into a generator . Regenerative braking restores as much as 15 % of the battery power . Despite broad use of magnesium , aluminum and composite_materials for wheels , transaxle casing , rear springs , load floor and bulkheads , the Ecostar weighs in at 3 # 100 pounds -- heavier than a Saturn and about equal_to a Ford Taurus . Carrying capacity is less than a half-ton , which is pretty good for an EV but rather sparse for other forms of wheeled delivery . Piloting an Ecostar requires few changes from internal-combustion techniques . It ' s odd to key-start an engine that bursts into life in total silence . There is air conditioning aboard , but only a diesel heater . Do not expect the options list to include power_steering , power brakes , power windows or other high-energy accessories that could drain travels_to around seven blocks . And no fuel_gauges . Just one dial reporting miles remaining to full discharge and another telling the percentage of power left in the battery . Ecostar runs hills as effortlessly and speedily as it travels freeway flats . We used a 110-volt charge at_home and a 220-volt jolt at the office . Yet daily commuting from Woodland Hills to Downtown -- with side trips for pastrami at Canter ' s and to visit a sick buddy at Cedars-Sinai -- never saw available energy fall below 50 % at day ' s end . The real surprise is realizing how few days one actually travels more_than 100 miles . Ecostar blends perfectly with traffic and draws no curious stares because it doesn ' t have the golf_cart look and doesn ' t limp along like a transportation experiment . One motorist , in fact , presumed Sparky ' s door decals to be a promotion and the car a gasoline-powered wolf in EV clothing . Sadly , Ecostar failed its ultimate test . We teased and taunted and stretched Sparky ' s mettle on several freeways beneath the Ray-Bans of motoring ' s ultimate arbitrators . Nobody seemed hungry for a place in the Guinness Book of World_Records as the first police_officer to give a speeding ticket to an electric vehicle . Paul Dean ' s Behind the Wheel column is published every_other Friday . 1994 Ford Ecostar EV Cost * Base , and as tested : $ 1 million ( includes manual steering , crank windows , horn , diesel-oil heater , sodium sulfur battery producing 330 volts , but no air bags. ) Engine * Three-phase AC electric_motor developing 75 horsepower .
