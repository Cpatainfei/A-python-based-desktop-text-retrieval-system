   <HEADLINE> HOWARD ROSENBERG : CBS IN LILLEHAMMER : LET THE SELF-PROMOTION BEGIN ! ; TELEVISION : AND that ' s NOT THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH THE NETWORK ' S OLYMPIC COVERAGE . WHATEVER HAPPENED TO CONTINUITY AND FOCUS ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The banner headline emerging from the Winter_Olympics this week is not about Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan or even the surprise gold medal of U.S. Alpine skier Tommy Moe . It ' s that Connie Chung is nice . Really , sincerely , honest-to-goodness , syrupy-sweet nice . that ' s the word from her co-anchor , Dan Rather , who reports with a straight_face , in one of those gaudily pretentious &quot; CBS Evening News &quot; promo spots that the network has been slipping into its daily coverage from Lillehammer , Norway , that a man in a pickup asked him the following question : &quot; Is Connie Chung really as nice as she seems ? &quot; Rather ' s reply : &quot; Yup. &quot; During a separate spot , Rather announces that , yup , Chung is also a pretty terrific reporter : &quot; Good instinct for a story . . . real journalistic credentials . . . smiles easily . . . a real tough competitor. &quot; When it comes_to Olympics commercials , however , these spots are a mere drop_in the fiord . Granted , CBS has never advertised itself as the Sisters of Mercy . Understandably , its mission in Lillehammer is to help its stockholders , its purpose in acquiring telecast rights for the Winter Games being to earn an Olympian profit . Fair enough . But c ' mon , this is becoming ridiculous . Nice production values , nice photography , nice music , nice people , nice snow , nice Norway . Yet during its three hours of prime-time coverage Monday night , CBS aired only 25 minutes of actual competition , compared to 47 minutes of commercials . In other words , the commercials-to-medal-event ratio was nearly 2-to-1 . The tone was set when CBS began its men ' s luge coverage that evening by going_to a break after the first sledder . No wonder David Letterman got a big laugh when he quipped Monday night : &quot; I guess if I had one complaint about the CBS coverage -- not enough commercials. &quot; The rest of that night ' s bloc was bloated with chatter and features -- a minute of luge , 4 1 / 2 minutes of human interest , and so on and so on . All right , your heart may_not beat wildly for the luge . Plus , it ' s obvious that CBS has the burden of freshening events that are hours old , while also seeking to broaden its audience by offering sports coverage for viewers who may_not care all that much for sports . But as long as you ' re watching all_of these events , you ' d enjoy some continuity , seeing things from start to finish , instead of the jumping-bean tactics that CBS has been employing . There on the screen Monday was U.S. Alpine skier Donna Weinbrecht , not competing in Lillehammer -- she would n ' t ski until Tuesday -- but in a feature about her battle back ( &quot; The weather worsens and the day grows darker . . . . &quot; ) from serious injury . A 10-minute feature . CBS has also been guilty of TV ' s old bait and switch . Before a commercial break late in its first hour Monday , it advertised ( &quot; coming_up . . . &quot; ) another down-hill run_by the newly crowned hero Moe . Yet after the break , it was not Moe but two Canadian skiers who viewers saw . They were followed by another commercial . Moe did not show_up until the start of the second hour . Soon it was also time for some tricky moves regarding another designated poster Olympian , U.S. speedskater Dan Jansen . So halfway through the hour , bring_on the five-minute feature , replete with oozy , sentimental music -- an apparent prelude to CBS showing his taped 500-meter race at Hamar . Except . . . . &quot; we ' ll see Dan Jansen skate here just a little later , &quot; said studio host Greg Gumbel . But first hockey results , a Tonya Harding update , a commercial break , a return to the luge . More yadda yadda yadda . Then finally , after CBS has stretched this out like a marathon taffy pull , Jansen skated . By now , surely everyone who cares even a whit knows that Jansen -- the 500-meter world record-holder who had failed to capture a medal in three previous Olympics -- suffered a slip_on Monday that dropped him to eighth , costing him a medal . That was a shame . Yet talk_about your overreaction . From that night ' s coverage -- CBS adding groaning funereal music to the replays and hounding Jansen , his coach and family for explanations -- you ' d have thought he let_down the entire United States by briefly slipping_on the ice . Prior to Lillehammer , relatively few Americans knew of Jansen . Now the nation was being implored to wear a black armband and begin a period of national mourning . With so many things in the United States and around the world to get depressed about , however , it ' s hard to find room for a skater who didn ' t get his medal . So get a life here . that ' s what Charles Kuralt seemed to be saying in a sweet feature that evening celebrating Olympians who hadn ' t lived_up_to expectations . &quot; Don ' t feel so bad , &quot; he said . In the advice category , David Letterman had some later that evening for his white-haired mom , who was_on &quot; assignment &quot; in Lillehammer for his show . &quot; Don ' t let those CBS goons push you around , &quot; he said . In an incredible coup , Letterman ' s mom even scored an interview in Lillehammer with First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton . She followed the script by asking the First_Lady if she or the President could do something about the speed_limit in Connecticut , where Letterman lives . Earlier , Letterman got his own scoop when breaking the news that &quot; the U.S. Olympic Committee worked_out a deal so the Menendez brothers can compete in the bobsled. &quot; If it were true , CBS would spritz the event with commercials and drag it out for hours . Is the coverage really that frustrating ? Yup .</TEXT>
