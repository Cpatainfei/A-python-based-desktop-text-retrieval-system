   <HEADLINE> SPIELBERG LEADS HUGE HOLOCAUST ON-LINE PROJECT ; MULTIMEDIA : ' SCHINDLER ' S LIST ' DIRECTOR ' S FOUNDATION WILL CONDUCT INTERVIEWS WITH THOUSANDS OF JEWISH SURVIVORS . THEIR REMARKS WILL BECOME PART OF A COMPUTERIZED DATABASE AND EDUCATIONAL SOFTWARE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It has the epic proportions of &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; and employs state-of-the-art technology like &quot; Jurassic Park , &quot; but Steven Spielberg ' s newest multimillion-dollar project will never make a dime at the box_office . that ' s because the three-time Academy Award winner ' s latest enterprise is strictly a labor_of_love : He intends to capture the eyewitness testimony of thousands of survivors of the Nazi Holocaust on videotape and create the first major archival database using multiple media . Then he plans to create educational software based on the interviews and make them accessible enough so that any seventh-grader who knows how to go on-line will be able to see and hear these vivid accounts of survival in the face of genocide . The filmmaker calls the ambitious effort &quot; a race against time &quot; because most of the survivors are 62 to 100 years old . &quot; My whole dream is to take as_many testimonies as is humanly possible and make their stories available for no fee for those who want it , &quot; Spielberg said . With $ 16 million in seed money from his own funds and contributions from movie studios , he has founded the nonprofit Survivors of the Shoah ( Hebrew for &quot; Holocaust &quot; ) Visual History Foundation . In June the foundation launched a pilot_program in the Los Angeles area , where it has collected more_than 100 interviews . Next month , interviewers -- who include filmmakers , rabbis , therapists , professors and adult children of Holocaust survivors -- will begin 20 hours of training in New York , Toronto and South Florida . The project is expected to cover the globe and cost $ 50 million to $ 60 million over several years . Although he hopes to expand the project to include non-Jewish survivors , the first thrust , Spielberg said , will be to tape Jewish survivors &quot; because the Holocaust was really about what happened to European Jewry -- the destruction of Jewish culture on that continent. &quot; &quot; You should know , &quot; he said , &quot; that some people would not talk to us . There are a lot of Jewish survivors that would like this to die with them because the memories are too horrible to confront. &quot; The interviews will make_up what he believes will be the largest multimedia database in Holocaust studies , incorporating visual , aural and written material . Spielberg emphasized that his interdisciplinary team of filmmakers , computer_hardware manufacturers , software developers , historians , archivists and educators is &quot; not reinventing the wheel . We ' re committed to sharing resources and joining forces with important organizations engaged in Holocaust survivor documentation , &quot; he said . Some of the institutions that are training the foundation ' s interviewers are the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies at Yale_University ; the Museum of Jewish Heritage in New York ; the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington , D.C. ; Yad Vashem , the Holocaust Martyrs ' and Heroes ' Remembrance Authority in Jerusalem , and the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles . They will also serve as the initial repositories for the collection . The interviews , each two to three hours long , include accounts not only of pain and loss , but also details of how , after losing so_much , survivors managed to rebuild their lives . Photographs and documents are preserved on tape . When possible , spouses and children appear on camera during the final moments . Each survivor receives a copy . Thanks to Spielberg ' s near-obsession with cutting-edge technology , researchers using computers will be able to call_up the interviews or portions of them using keywords . They will be able to select interviews by a subject ' s surname , gender or hometown , or a topic mentioned in the interview , such_as the name of a concentration_camp . James Moll , one of two hands-on producers overseeing the project , said the team is using the latest digital technology that will allow the interviews to be stored for long periods_of_time and copied without any loss of quality . Besides the database , which will be used mainly by scholars , the foundation is developing educational software programs for different age and grade levels , Moll said . A student might &quot; walk through &quot; the barracks of a concentration_camp and see different faces . He or she could then click on a face to hear that person ' s story . The program could also include documentary_film footage . If the programs are sold , he said , all profits would be channeled back to the foundation . * Moll and fellow producer June Beallor , who had teamed_up to make documentary educational and promotional films before being tapped by Spielberg for the foundation , see their work as &quot; a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity &quot; and acknowledge that it has a highly emotional aspect . &quot; James and I have always worked_on projects that we consider meaningful , &quot; Beallor said , &quot; but this one has changed our lives . We put our whole heart into it . &quot; I grew_up Jewish , &quot; she said . &quot; But it ' s one thing to read or hear about the Holocaust and another to watch an eyewitness account. &quot; She was deeply affected , she said , by the story of a man who was forced by the Nazis to hang his own father . She received a moving letter of thanks from another man whose father had never been able to talk to him directly about his experiences in the death camps . But the father volunteered to be interviewed by the foundation and then gave the taped interview to his son . Only then , the son wrote , did they begin to talk openly about the Holocaust . Moll , who is not Jewish , said : &quot; I don ' t know how to respond when people ask me how I can be so dedicated to documenting the stories of Jewish survivors . I don ' t understand how they don ' t understand , &quot; he said softly . &quot; The other non-Jewish people on our staff feel the same way. &quot; Spielberg said the idea came_to him in the middle of making &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; the 1993 film based on the Thomas Keneally book about Nazi industrialist Oskar Schindler , who saved more_than 1 # 000 Jews during World_War_II . &quot; I felt that a much more important contribution to remembering the Shoah would be an aural-visual history , &quot; he said . The 46-year-old director ' s own interest in the Holocaust goes_back to early_childhood . &quot; My grandparents were a major presence in my life . . . . Because of them , &quot; he said , &quot; I had a bar_mitzvah in an Orthodox synagogue and kept kosher for most of my formative life . &quot; They were not survivors , &quot; he added , &quot; but many of their friends were , and my awareness ( of the Holocaust ) came from them . &quot; Also , because of my mom ' s interest in classical_music , a lot of survivors who were musicians would come_to our house in Cincinnati , &quot; he said . &quot; There were people playing cellos and violas with Auschwitz-Birkenau tattoos on their arms . I remember when I was 3 years old learning to count by touching the numbers on the forearm of one of them . &quot; Long before ' Schindler ' s List ' was even written , I would read everything I could and see documentaries on the subject. &quot; One of his main reasons for undertaking the foundation project , he said , was to give young people a more vivid sense of history , help them &quot; wake_up to the fact that we are all part of every episode that has happened. &quot; The Survivors of the Shoah Visual History Foundation is trying to contact Holocaust survivors and recruit interviewers around the world . Inquiries can be made in writing to P.O. Box 8940 , Universal City , CA 91608-0940 , or by telephone from within the United States and Canada at ( 800 ) 661-2092 .</TEXT>
