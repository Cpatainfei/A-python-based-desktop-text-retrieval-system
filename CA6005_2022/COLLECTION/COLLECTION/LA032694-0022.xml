   <HEADLINE> FACTS ON LIFE OF JESUS ARE ELUSIVE , BUT DEBATE REMAINS USEFUL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Your article on the Jesus Seminar ( &quot; Claims About 2 ' Unofficial ' Gospels Stir Controversy , &quot; Feb . 26 ) certainly elicited some virulent responses . As a professional archeologist specializing in the ancient Near East and especially Israel for almost 30 years , I would like to respond . We can never know what actually happened . We have data from the Gospels , which do not always agree . We have other documents which were not accepted into the canon and were eliminated when the founders of Christianity were putting the New Testament together . Scholars have been studying these other sources for many years and they teach us much about the life and times of Jesus . No archeological find has as yet proven any event in the life of Jesus , or for that matter Moses , or David , as much as we would like it . Archeology does , however , &quot; put clothes &quot; on them by showing us the material context of their lives , the events described in the Scriptures . It also enables us , sometimes , to connect events in the Bible with something happening elsewhere , so that we can put it into a particular time frame . Why are people so afraid of having their views challenged ? They would do_better to use the opportunity to study their own view and either change them or reinforce them . These are exciting times for the study of biblical history , and we should be taking_advantage of opportunities to put science and scholarship to work to our benefit . JAY A .
