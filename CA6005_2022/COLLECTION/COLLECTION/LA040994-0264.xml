   <HEADLINE> TENORS STEP_OUT TO BE SEEN , NOT HEARD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Through a miracle of modern-day opera-star logistics , it proved possible to assemble Jose Carreras , Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti ( in alphabetical order ) , along with conductor , Zubin Mehta , to meet the press and the paparazzi Friday in Manhattan ' s most glamorous meeting_place , the Rainbow Room at Rockefeller Center . The Three Tenors are back . They startled the classical_music world with untold riches in unprecedented worldwide sales of audio and video documents with their first meeting in Rome , in conjunction with the World Cup in soccer four years ago . Now they hope to repeat that success with an encore in Los Angeles at Dodger Stadium on July 16 . &quot; Encore : The Three Tenors , &quot; which will be given the day before this year ' s World Cup_final at the Rose Bowl , has already been advertised ; and the less expensive seats , those ranging from $ 15 to $ 150 , are sold_out . But tickets for $ 300 , $ 500 and $ 1 # 000 are still available , so now it was time to announce the details of the upcoming concert . In fact , the details of the event are the glamour , which was in strong supply , as still and video photographers jockeyed for position . Actual facts , less so . No program yet , and the concluding medley -- which , in Rome , included everything from &quot; Maria &quot; to &quot; Memory &quot; to &quot; O Sole Mio &quot; -- will remain a secret until the performance . &quot; I think most of the people will enjoy being surprised , &quot; Domingo suggested Friday . What is known is that there will be two medleys this time , and Lalo Schifrin will arrange them , as he did the one in Rome . There will be no intermission , but rather a 15- minute , mid-point tribute to Gene Kelly , with the dancer , himself , overseeing a re-creation of his famous routine to Gershwin ' s &quot; An American in Paris. &quot; The Los Angeles Philharmonic will be_on hand , as will the Music Center Opera Chorus . The concert will , of course , be recorded live for distribution on home audio and video formats ; and it will be broadcast to every corner of the known world . &quot; We were considering putting the video in a space_capsule and shooting it to outer space , &quot; joked Mehta , &quot; but we were ruled out. &quot; There will also be a &quot; Making of . . . &quot; documentary . A new record label , Atlantic , will the release the album and video in the United States . This is a pop and jazz label , unlike , the classical London Records , which put_out the first concert . But from that point on things start to get vague . Tibor Rudas , the flamboyant presenter , boasts a state-of-the-art sound_system , which will supposedly operate without amplification . The press_release promises that every member of the 56 # 000-seat stadium will experience the event as if it were held_in an intimate concert_hall . When asked exactly what that meant , Rudas replied that a bevy of engineers were already at_work on the system , noting that Dodger Stadium is the best possible arena for the concert and &quot; a heck of a lot better than a football stadium. &quot; No one , however , suggested that Dodger Stadium could compete with the historic splendor of the Baths of Caracalla , where the Rome concert was held . Why an encore , beyond the expectation of making buckets of money ? All three tenors seemed to indicate that soccer had something to do with it . &quot; During these four years , we have had unbelievable offers around the world , &quot; Domingo said . &quot; Anybody would be tempted by the amounts . But we kept the possibility for the right moment . We love soccer , love it deeply from our childhood. &quot; Charity , on the part of the tenors , does not , this time , seem to play the role it had in the first concert , where all three tenors made sizable humanitarian contributions ( Carreras , who made a recovery from leukemia a_few years ago , gave to his leukemia fund ; Pavarotti , to a hospital in his hometown of Modena , Italy ; and Domingo , to earthquake relief in Mexico_City ) . &quot; We are performing as professionals , &quot; is how Carreras puts it now , saying how the money will be spent is a personal decision for each one . The following are other tidbits learned about the lives of the three tenors from a press_conference that drew little music press ( too low-brow for the classical_music side , too classical for pop ) but rather celebrity journalists and foreign correspondents . When the three tenors get_together ( which is clearly seldom ) what do they talk_about ? Music , a little ; politics ; society ; sport ; the ladies . Would Pavarotti like to sing with Barbra Streisand ? You bet . What soccer teams are they rooting for ? The obvious ones . Domingo is from Spain , but he is loyal , too , to Mexico , since he grew_up in Mexico_City . Carreras is from Barcelona , but could support Brazil if it were in the championship . Pavarotti is for Italy all_the way . That leaves the Bombay-born Mehta . &quot; In my country they play cricket , &quot; he said . And then there are the two towering waterfalls with bountiful greenery that will be part of the elaborate neoclassical stage setup ( along with 20 columns ) . Won ' t the waterfalls make_noise ? &quot; A good question , &quot; said Pavarotti , confident that the engineers know what they are doing . &quot; You will see water fall without water , &quot; Rudas explained , calling a halt to the proceeding -- and generating another rush of photographers -- before he would have to get any deeper into that . * Tickets to the Three Tenors concert : ( 213 ) 224-1448 .</TEXT>
