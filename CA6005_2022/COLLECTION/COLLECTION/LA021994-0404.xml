   <HEADLINE> EXPORTS TO JAPAN IN JEOPARDY , SAY STATE ' S FARMERS ; TRADE : SOME LEADERS FEAR MEDFLY INFESTATION WILL TIP JAPANESE TOWARD BOYCOTT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With trade tensions intensifying between the United States and Japan , farmers in California -- growers of the produce favored by the dreaded Mediterranean_fruit_fly -- are afraid of becoming an easy target in what may become a bruising struggle . And a new University of California study says if Japan follows_through on a threat to boycott California produce , it would cost the state ' s export-dependent farm economy dearly . Even before the recent collapse of trade talks between the two countries , Japan was threatening a boycott of the state ' s produce because of the return of the Medfly to parts of California . Just last month , the American Embassy in Tokyo was warning Washington of &quot; a very critical situation. &quot; Since then , aerial spraying has finally begun in Riverside County to kill the Medfly , a step Japan had urged . But the general trade climate has worsened dramatically , and the state ' s farm lobby fears a boycott would be seen by the Japanese as an effective way to respond to President Clinton ' s recent trade complaint over Japan ' s treatment of U.S. cellular-phone makers . Agriculture trade officials in Washington say they consider retaliation unlikely , but California farm leaders -- having just won a hard-fought battle to ship the state ' s rice to Japan -- are deeply concerned . &quot; The threat is very real , &quot; says Bob Vice , president of the California Farm Bureau . &quot; Frankly , we ' ve always known that ' s the way the Japanese would retaliate : in agriculture. &quot; Such a boycott would quickly spread to other Far East nations and trim overall farm revenues by $ 564 million while cutting deeply into the plum and citrus business , slashing revenues for Valencia_oranges alone by 55 % , the UC Berkeley study says . The short-term result would be sharply lower profits or operating losses for growers , shippers and packers , while an embargo of more_than two years would cause &quot; a significant loss in acres , jobs and assets &quot; for about 20 crops , said the report by economist Jerome B . Siebert at UC Berkeley . If the Medfly became established in the state , the total losses could reach some $ 1.4 billion a year because of the Far East boycott and other continuing costs of fighting the infestation , the study said . California farmers take_in about $ 18 billion a year . Siebert said a boycott by Japan is especially worrisome because Korea , Taiwan and Hong Kong normally follow Japan ' s lead in these matters . That could spread alarm to other regions and to other parts of the United States , he said . The Pacific Rim has swollen in importance to California agriculture , especially citrus . Fully 60 % of the products sold by Sunkist , the state ' s giant citrus cooperative , are exported to Asia . Japan is Sunkist ' s biggest single export market , a spokesman said . After repeated efforts to block the aerial spraying of the insecticide malathion , the spraying began Tuesday over an 18-square-mile area of Corona and Norco in Riverside County . American Embassy officials in Japan had been urging such action . A top official in the U.S. Department_of_Agriculture on Friday downplayed the likelihood of retaliation as a motive for a Japanese boycott , and said he expects no action unless the Medfly spreads . &quot; As long as the trappings ( of the pest ) are confined to that region , our concerns are lessened , &quot; said Richard Schroeter , acting administrator of the USDA ' s Foreign Agricultural Service . &quot; The action taken by the state of California , the aerial spraying , give us optimism here. &quot; The specific products that would be affected by an embargo are fresh apples , apricots , avocados , bell_peppers , sweet_cherries , dates , figs , table grapes , grapefruit , kiwis , lemons , limes , tangerines , oranges , nectarines , peaches , pears , persimmons , plums and tomatoes . Nearly a third of those California crops were exported in 1992 , bringing_in $ 605 million , the UC Berkeley study said . More_than half that total came from Japan , Korea , Taiwan and Hong Kong . Impact on California Should Japan and other East Asian_nations boycott California produce , the impact would be devasting for certain crops . Total revenue and expected losses , in millions of dollars : Valencia_oranges : Lost revenue under boycott : $ 166.2 Total revenue : 299.8 Lemons : Lost revenue under boycott : 128.6 Total revenue : 334.4 Grapefruit : Lost revenue under boycott : 82.5 Total revenue : 160.2 Naval oranges : Lost revenue under boycott : 73.5 Total revenue : 482.5 Plums and prunes : Lost revenue under boycott : 43.6 Total revenue : 118.4 Table Grapes : Lost revenue under boycott : 39.3 Total revenue : 578.5 Kiwi : Lost revenue under boycott : 6.4 Total revenue : 45.0 Avocados : Lost revenue under boycott : 5.2 Total revenue : 177.1 Source : UC Berkeley</TEXT>
