   <TEXT> Summoned to Rome by Pope John Paul II for a special congress , Roman_Catholic bishops from Africa are seeking to match the demands of their faith with the social , political and economic needs of a hungry and often violent continent . For about 300 bishops from the 53 nations of Africa attending a monthlong synod here , &quot; inculturation &quot; -- melding Catholicism with African traditions -- emerged as an overriding concern . &quot; It is the marriage of faith and life , &quot; said the group ' s interim document . Relentless inter-ethnic violence in Rwanda , the most Christian country in Africa , is a tragic counterpoint to the synod ' s exaltation of a continent where Catholicism is growing quickly and the Vatican counts 80 million believers among 610 million people . A practical advantage of holding the synod in Rome is that it exposes the stay-at-home Vatican curia directly to the African church . And such meetings provide a valuable chance for participants to compare notes . &quot; Exploration of common problems by bishops who didn ' t necessarily know one another should result in a stronger African church , &quot; said Rev . Tom Reese , a California Jesuit who is following the synod as a specialist in church organization . The secular context for a church transported to Africa in the last century by European missionaries emerges with painful clarity as the bishops -- 90 % of them Africans -- recite a litany of continental needs . &quot; In almost all our nations , there is abject poverty , tragic mismanagement of available resources , political instability and social disorientation , &quot; noted Cardinal Hyacinthe Thiandoum of Senegal . Part of the blame rests with Europe and North_America , which contribute material assistance to Africa but are also responsible_for &quot; bombs and weapons to destroy our people , and to create insoluble debts , &quot; observed Mozambique Cardinal Alexandre Jose Maria dos Santos . The burden of responsibility for African trauma , however , rests heaviest not on outsiders but on African political_leaders , the bishops warned . Bishop Julius Babatunde Adelakun of Nigeria assailed leaders who &quot; are power hungry , greedy , corrupt , having enriched themselves at the expense of the people they are supposed to serve. &quot; The bishops said that Catholic teaching must be presented &quot; as a message of liberation and salvation . Justice and peace is at the heart of the mission in Africa . There is a need for a new cultural politics which accepts pluralism , diversity and democracy. &quot; A 34-point working agenda notes the great religious enthusiasm of Africa but also worries about a &quot; shallow faith &quot; among some African Christians -- what one bishop called &quot; rosary beads in the morning , witchcraft in the afternoon. &quot; Bishops have been stunned by missionaries ' reports that both catechists and regular worshipers in Catholic communities in some cases participated in the Rwanda slaughter of minority Tutsi by majority Hutus . The bishops ' agenda observes that since the history of the church on their continent is short , among Africans there is &quot; a strong feeling of having received a faith not yet fully at_home in our life and culture. &quot; It is in everyday practicalities such_as liturgy , marriage and reverence for ancestors that Catholicism must most directly adapt to African realities , bishops say . They encourage a meeting ground with traditional rites representing &quot; the reservoir of African religions and cultural values. &quot; &quot; Christ walks too_much among the people in a European garment , &quot; said Bishop Bonifatius Haushiku of Namibia . One result , said Bishop Francis Mugadzi of Zimbabwe , is that Christians lead &quot; double lives , one foot in African tradition , another one in the church. &quot;</TEXT>
