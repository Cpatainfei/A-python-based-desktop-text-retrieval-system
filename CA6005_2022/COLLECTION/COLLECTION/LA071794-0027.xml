   <HEADLINE> FOCUS ; THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH ? ; HBO FILM ABOUT THE ASSASSINATION OF THE MAN WHO MADE A ' SUPER GUN ' POSES QUESTIONS OF REAL INTRIGUE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Who shot Gerald Bull twice in the head outside his Brussels apartment on the morning of March 22 , 1990 ? Why was the portly 62-year-old Canadian arms designer assassinated ? Were the governments of the United States , Great Britain , Iraq , Iran , Israel or South_Africa responsible ? Bull was in the process of building a &quot; super gun &quot; for Saddam Hussein on the eve of the Iraqi dictator ' s invasion of Kuwait . The murder precipitated the biggest political scandal Britain has seen in years . The extent of U.S. involvement , if any , in Bull ' s operation has not yet been disclosed . HBO ' s thriller &quot; Doomsday Gun , &quot; which airs Saturday , addresses this labyrinth of questions . Frank Langella stars as the mysterious weapons innovator ; Alan Arkin , James Fox and Kevin Spacey co-star . Based on information in the public record , the script is outrageous enough for Langella to say , &quot; ' Doomsday Gun ' reaffirms what a pawn I am in my government . ... Americans are amazingly unsophisticated about this . ... I think this movie will shock a lot of people. &quot; Sitting in his suite at the Athenaeum Hotel following a day of filming at Twickenham Studios , Langella talks with grim fascination about the man he plays . In 1972 , Gerald Bull was granted American citizenship by a special_act of Congress because of his work for NASA . He later designed weapons_systems for China , Israel and South_Africa . But Bull ' s real interest was in developing the world ' s biggest weapon -- a super gun with a barrel the length of two football_fields , capable of firing a shell the size of a telephone_booth 500 miles . At the height of the Iran-Iraq War , he found a patron in Hussein . Bull was so consumed by the scientific challenge that he ignored the international arms embargo against Iraq . &quot; To other people , Bull was a devil , &quot; Langella says . &quot; To me , he was a compulsive , megalomaniacal , blinkered genius . When you ' re playing someone , you can ' t step outside and morally judge them . Bull ' s drive was to create the greatest weapon , and he paid_for it with his life. &quot; To prepare_for the role , Langella met with Bull ' s second-in-command , Christopher Cowley , a consultant on the film . &quot; Chris and I talked for five hours . I pumped him about what Bull was like , how he felt about things . I had to find a way not to judge the man . I have little kids , and this gun will kill kids. &quot; On another production day , Fox stands alone , feeding the ducks , at the edge of the Serpentine , a lake in the middle of Hyde Park . An innocent Sunday outing , except that Fox ' s character , a British intelligence_agent , was about to rendezvous with a CIA contact ( Spacey ) . The topic of conversation : what Bull has been up_to lately . To subvert the arms embargo , Bull had arranged to have different components of the super gun made throughout Europe . They would then be assembled on-site in Iraq . He ordered the gun_barrel from a British manufacturer , describing it as an oil pipe . After Bull ' s death , British customs impounded the huge metal cylinders , identifying them as gun_barrels en route to Iraq . The resulting brouhaha , which became part of a government investigation known as the Scott Inquiry in Britain , is just now concluding . British producer Michael Deakin says , &quot; Publicly , Britain ' s policy was not to provide arms to Iraq . But we were doing_it , as indeed were the Americans . Bull knew it was illegal , and the_British knew it was illegal , but we could keep_an_eye_on it . &quot; However , customs was uninfluenced by the government . When they seized those great , huge tubes and said they were gun_barrels , the prime_minister ' s press secretary had an off-the-record briefing saying customs have gone mad . Customs got enraged and said the government was lying and waved around copies of Bull ' s book . Some very senior customs person blew the whistle , but who told customs ? In the film , Kevin Spacey does , but in reality nobody knows . Maybe it was the Mossad , &quot; Israel ' s foreign intelligence agency . So who shot Bull ? &quot; We could make five different movies with five different reasons , &quot; director Robert Young adds . &quot; Bull knew a lot about a lot of people , and he had reason to be worried . He was constantly going_to MI6 ( Britain ' s intelligence service ) , the CIA and Mossad , telling them what he was doing . He was helping Iraq with their Scud missiles -- a dangerous pastime . &quot; To pursue his dream , he was feeding the jackals . Who was providing and using end-user certificates ? Bull could blow the whistle . The easiest thing to do was to kill him . I don ' t know who did_it . I change my opinion from day to day. &quot; &quot; Bull was killed because he was naive , &quot; Fox says . ' He didn ' t realize he knew too much. &quot; &quot; When we began , mine was the standard view -- the Mossad , &quot; producer Deakin says about who killed Bull . &quot; Now , everybody thinks it was the_British . Bull knew so_much about what the Scott Inquiry was inquiring into. ' The Scott Inquiry actually borrowed HBO ' s super gun model for one of its hearings , and was aware of the full-scale replica that HBO built_in the Spanish desert out of fiberglass , cardboard and sewage pipes . &quot; I had this fantasy that Israel would see it on their satellite and take it out , &quot; Deakin says . That didn ' t happen . &quot; Doomsday Gun &quot; airs Saturday at 8 p.m. on HBO .</TEXT>
