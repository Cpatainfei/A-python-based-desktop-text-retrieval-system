   <HEADLINE> WELCOME TO CYBERVILLE ; RESIDENTS OF REMOTE NORTH COAST COUNTIES USE COMPUTER_NETWORK TO KEEP IN TOUCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Larry Goldberg ' s town has a grocery_store , a theater , a library , an art_gallery and , of course , a teen-agers ' hangout . But you won ' t find it on any map . It ' s called Northcoast Electronic Town , or N.E.T. , a cybernetic linkup of five of the state ' s northernmost counties that Goldberg launched last year . Humboldt , Del Norte , Mendocino , Trinity and Lake are rural counties with more redwoods than people , where people go_to escape the cold efficiency of computers and other trappings of high-stress urban life . But Goldberg -- a former New Yorker who came west to attend Humboldt State University -- thought that with all_the remote towns that make_up the North Coast , why not use high_technology to help close the miles separating them all ? So with $ 20 # 000 of_his_own money , the Eureka business consultant created N.E.T. , a cybertown where people can order blackberry jam from a food store , browse through an art_gallery , find_out what ' s playing_at the local theater , read the complete works of Shakespeare , or debate President Clinton ' s timber policies , all without leaving home . &quot; This is the community of the future , &quot; Goldberg , 41 , said of the fledgling computer_network . &quot; The same reason I stayed here is why I created this system -- to maintain my quality_of_life , &quot; he said . &quot; You can live_in the country and have this quality_of_life and still be connected to big-city services. &quot; Goldberg ' s company , Sequoia Technical Services , is headquartered in Eureka , about 250 miles north of San Francisco . Thus far he has enticed about 200 subscribers , with about half of those paying the monthly $ 10 fee . To get the system going , he has offered free access to schools , local_governments , libraries and hospitals . He hopes to someday have 1 # 000 subscribers . &quot; We just have to train people , &quot; said Goldberg , who lives_in the tiny fishing village of Trinidad about 20 miles up the coast from Eureka . &quot; We ' re always a little behind the times up here. &quot; Clicking on the &quot; calendar &quot; button , a subscriber can find the title of this month ' s play_at Humboldt County ' s Ferndale Repertory Theatre , as well as a schedule of sailboat races on Humboldt Bay . Teen-agers click on the &quot; coffeehouse &quot; and tap into the on-line forum &quot; Northcoast Teen Topics. &quot; Business_leaders use the &quot; professional building &quot; section , looking_for grants and ways to build coalitions to attract business to the economically depressed region . Goldberg sees N.E.T. as a new tool for economic development of the five-county area , which has been battered over the last decade by federal regulations that limited timber harvests and hurt the salmon fishing industry . &quot; The biggest area of concern for businesses here is people are very remote from each other , &quot; he said . &quot; We began electronic networking as a means of talking to our colleagues and seeking funding . Nobody was providing a regionwide service. &quot; Subscribers receive some services from the global network Internet . These include Associated Press wire_service , electronic_mail service to other Internet subscribers and 200 of the 8 # 000 USEnet &quot; conferences &quot; news groups . But N.E.T. subscribers also receive local news provided by two area magazines and Arcata ' s Humboldt State University newspaper . There are N.E.T. discussion groups about Northern California politics and other issues of interest to those living behind the &quot; redwood curtain. &quot; N.E.T. is different from most other networks because it ties together a region and its people . Having similar lifestyles , the people of Northern California can talk to one another about fishing , timber harvesting , watershed work , social_service programs , economic development and other local issues . Mitch Patenaude , a computer_expert who lives_in Blue Lake , about 20 miles northeast of Eureka , subscribes_to several national computer_networks . &quot; After a while I found I had little in common with most people &quot; on discussion groups on the Internet , Patenaude said . &quot; But the N.E.T. is community-based . You might have something to talk about. &quot; Subscriber Jim Moorehead , owner of the Joshua Grindle Inn on the Mendocino coast , is using N.E.T. to meet with members of the Mendocino County Visitors Bureau Board . Using electronic_mail , he can send the same message to all board_members with a_few clicks of the mouse . No copying , no stamps , no fax machine and no &quot; snail mail &quot; ( a computer term used to describe the U.S. Postal Service ) . &quot; It takes me two hours to get_to a meeting , &quot; Moorehead said . Using N.E.T. and its 800 number , he can talk longer for less . Other board_members can listen and make comments . Another subscriber relies_on the network to communicate with his researcher in Eureka , a two-hour drive from his office in Crescent City , near the Oregon border . A group of subscribers from three counties -- Humboldt , Mendocino and Trinity -- is using N.E.T. for &quot; bio-regional marketing &quot; to sell herbs , mushrooms and other products harvested locally . Others are using the service to find economic support . &quot; I use it to track Option 9 , &quot; said Tim Cochrane , president of Six Rivers National_Bank , headquartered in Eureka . Option 9 is Clinton ' s new forest policy . It includes grant money that could spur Northern California ' s economy as employment in the timber industry drops . There have been complaints about the price on N.E.T. For $ 10 a month you get two hours of on-line time . After that the rate is $ 5 an hour . That is slightly higher than other , larger networks . But , Goldberg said , &quot; we ' ve created the feeling of living in a small_town . . . an electronic village with access to the world. &quot;</TEXT>
