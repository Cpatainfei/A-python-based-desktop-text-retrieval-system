   <HEADLINE> WANNA DANCE ? : 2 BENEFIT SHOWS FOR A ROCKIN ' CAUSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The quake that rocked_and_rolled Southlanders out of their beds two weeks ago could be written_off as a memory for most Orange County residents , whose only inconvenience was losing a little sleep or having to straighten a picture or replace knickknacks on a shelf . While it ' s easy to avoid the incessant TV coverage on the disaster by escaping to a nightclub or bar , some folks in the local music scene aren ' t letting patrons off so easy . Nightclub owners , promoters and bands are trying to shake_off the apathy with a pair of concerts next week to benefit the American Red_Cross .

All proceeds from both shows will go_to the Red_Cross . First up , on Sunday , the Electric Circus in Anaheim will hold Richter Relief , a marathon charity benefit featuring 21 bands in 11 hours . Club owner Allen Ornstein organized the event in part because of relatives living_in Northridge , the quake ' s epicenter , who suffered from the Jan . 17 temblor . Just $ 4 gets patrons of all ages a wristband with in-and-out privileges during the 1 p.m. to 2 a.m. concert . Additional money and donations of clothes and canned_food will also be accepted .
