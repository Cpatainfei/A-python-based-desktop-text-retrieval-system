   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEWS ; FRANK MAJORE ' S LESS LURID PHOTOGRAPHS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Advertisements are designed to trigger a psychodrama . The goal is to shame , seduce and / or deceive the target audience ; proclaiming the virtues of a particular brand of soap or car is secondary . Of this , Frank Majore is well-aware . His photographs luxuriate in the sheen of the advertising image in_order to crack the code from within -- not with the zeal of a consumer advocate , but the cunning of a practiced post-modernist . In the ' 80s , Majore was known for hyper-saturated color prints in which martini glasses , lipsticked demi-mondaines and silk sheets floated through implied mini-narratives like Madison Avenue-sanctioned apparitions . His new photographs at Thomas Solomon ' s Garage are black_and_white , and considerably less lurid , less va-va-voom . Still , a series called &quot; The Birth of Venus &quot; resembles a Vogue spread on the wonders of bubble_bath , and a chrysanthemum with a string of pearls wrapped around its stalk reads like an ad for Mikimoto ' s top-of-the-line gems . Majore ' s juxtaposition of deep blacks and translucent whites recalls the graphic contrasts of Irving Penn , while his minimalist compositions conjure those of Paul Outerbridge Jr . Both photographers have been quietly transferred from the marketplace to the pantheon . Majore ' s images suggest that such transitions are redundant , for the art historical canon is nothing if not a genteel form of advertising . Majore ' s cloud photos , which take_on Alfred Stieglitz ' s &quot; Equivalents , &quot; play with this idea . Vaporous dissolves of white , the images are as complex and exquisite as any Symbolist reverie . These are , then , self-conscious exercises in one-upsmanship ; they proselytize vigorously on behalf of Majore ' s &quot; genius. &quot; Here , Majore masquerades as a newer and avowedly &quot; improved &quot; model -- the linchpin of many_an advertising_campaign , as well as the ironic jab of this sophisticated project . * Frank Majore , Thomas Solomon ' s Garage , 928 N . Fairfax Ave. , ( 213 ) 654-4731 . Ends Saturday . * Sounds Like Art : Phyllis Baldino ' s mechanized playthings at TRI are polite -- at least initially . They wait patiently for you to enter the room before they begin to perform . Then , spurred into action by motion detectors , they go slightly mad , taking you along with them . Neon-colored tubes spin , 120 r.p.m. motors whir , and an ungodly sound not unlike a chorus of sick whales fills the space . Any 11-year-old would be thrilled . Baldino begins with the plastic tubes children buy_at novelty_shops , which produce a range of sounds when spun in circles . She mounts them to the wall , and powers them with motors so that they operate themselves . The ones in the front_room move with deliberate grace -- a kiddie version of Rebecca Horn ' s mechanized balletics . The ones in the back rotate with manic glee -- and generate enough noise to prove it . Where Baldino wants to go_with all this , however , remains muddled . On the one hand , she seems to be thinking_about the inevitably accelerating pace of childhood amusements . On the other , she is concerned with the way kinetic art plays upon juvenile desires . Disappointingly , the two thrusts of the work don ' t come_together -- or perhaps they come_together so obviously one craves something more . A video installation called &quot; Venice in Berlin in Venice &quot; provides an oblique addendum to the exhibition . While visiting Berlin , Baldino discovered that footage of people frolicking on the beach in Venice , Calif. , often runs_on late-night German television . Baldino recorded the footage , brought it back to the States , played it on a portable monitor set_up on Venice Beach , and then filmed the purloined footage , returned to its original site . More interesting here than the visual conceit is the notion of sound as an arbiter of experience -- aesthetic and otherwise . It is the overwhelming din of static that cues you to the successive levels of alienation from the real , and to the inevitably mediated nature of both fantasy and distraction . If Baldino were to focus more directly on sound and the mechanisms of hearing , the work might well resonate on more complex -- if less ear-splitting -- levels . * Phyllis Baldino , TRI , 1140 S . Hayworth , ( 213 ) 936-8255 . Open Fridays-Sundays , through Feb . 28 . * Entrancing Revelations : Like the pages of a book of poetry , Merion Estes ' diminutive paintings line the Jan Baum Gallery walls , each one precisely the same size , each one offering a minor revelation . Estes infuses her abstractions with a lyric beauty that seems -- at least when you are in the thrall of the best of them -- infinitely various . Even when you become aware of her habitual tropes , it ' s difficult not to be entranced . Estes ' technique , like that of Adam Ross , involves building_up layers of pigment on panel and then sanding selectively , so as_to reveal buried patterns , networks and meshes of color . Some of the works are marked with highly gestural overpainting ; others feature sweeping vertical forms on either side which , like curtains , heighten the built-in drama . The less successful paintings are those in which Estes attempts to conjure a female sensibility . These images are pint-sized Helen Frankenthalers -- all sunny yellows , luscious corals and tangled skeins of baby pink and blue . The problem is that Estes is already working in what amounts to a stereotypically &quot; feminine &quot; mode : She makes small , jewel-like objects that are staggeringly pretty . Her mandate , it would seem , is to counter such reductionist , gender-specific readings , not to reinforce them . To do anything less is naive -- and places a limit upon work that has the potential to be far more expansive . * Merion Estes , Jan Baum Gallery , 170 S . La Brea Ave. , ( 213 ) 932-0170 . Closed Sundays and Mondays , through Feb . 26 . * Smaller Doses Needed : &quot; Dance of the Melissae , &quot; Nancy Macko ' s large-scale installation at the Brand Library , literally overwhelms . The sounds include tap_dancing , Tibetan chants and the swarming of bees ; smells include sniffing vases filled with coriander and lavender ; and visuals -- wooden panels incorporating beeswax , votives filled with pussy_willows , cave-style wall drawings celebrating early honey gatherers , and the &quot; Stations of the Goddess , &quot; featuring ritualistic items like dial-an-herb wheels , accouterments for inhaling pollen , and antique bee smokers . This kind of bombardment is Macko ' s way of initiating us into a cult -- indeed , a cosmology -- in which the sensual , rather than the rational or the punitive , prevails . This is a world infused with a feminine spirit ; and bees , which Macko refers to at various points in the installation as &quot; souls of nymphs , &quot; &quot; priestesses of the goddess &quot; and &quot; symbols of regeneration , &quot; are its reigning metaphor . Macko is a fine artist , yet in many ways , she sets herself up . She hits the viewer with everything she ' s got -- with sledgehammer-like intensity . One finds_oneself edging away , and latching onto the less didactic elements -- the cocktail_dress , hat and gloves of a &quot; modern-day bee-priestess &quot; ; a gold razor blade for cutting lines of powdered pollen ; a Pepsi-stamped baby bottle filled with honey . Like honey itself , Macko ' s work is highly concentrated and most effective -- and affecting -- in small doses . Perhaps at this point , an operation as rational and punitive as editing is what is called_for . * Nancy Macko , Brand Library and Art_Galleries , 1601 W . Mountain St. , Glendale , ( 818 ) 548-2050 . Closed Sundays , through Feb . 19 .</TEXT>
