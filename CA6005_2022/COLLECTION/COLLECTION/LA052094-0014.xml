   <HEADLINE> ...WHILE IN CALIFORNIA , A COURT AFFIRMS THE HUMANITY OF A FETUS ; ABORTION : THE FETAL-MURDER DECISION WILL TOPPLE THE ILLOGIC OF THE PRO-CHOICE MOVEMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Monday ' s California Supreme Court decision allowing the prosecution of a defendant who causes the death of an unborn child as early as seven weeks into the pregnancy is an overwhelming victory for anti-abortionists and may prove to be a legal and moral setback for pro-abortionists . The 6-1 decision gives California the distinction of being the most contradictory state : Long known as the late-term abortion capital , we have now ironically upheld the most protective fetal-murder law . Though the decision does nothing to interfere with the 1973 Roe vs . Wade abortion decision , it does make a powerful statement regarding the humanity of fetal life . In Roe , abortion was protected under a fictional right_to_privacy . That decision effectively gave every woman the right to obtain an abortion throughout the entire nine months of her pregnancy . Since federal laws supersede state laws , all laws regulating abortion were immediately struck_down ; unborn babies were declared non-persons . Women were given sole discretion to decide whether their unborn children would live or die . Since medicine in the 1970s was not as sophisticated and advanced as it is today , the fetus was thought to be merely a glob of tissue , an unviable parasite or a potential human who was not yet human . This sounds ridiculous in light of today ' s knowledge regarding fetal development and the advancement in early fetal viability , yet a pro-abortion ethic must continue to maintain these views . Since the courts would never rule that one life could supersede another life , a large dose of intellectual dishonesty was called_for , and the courts declared that the unborn were non-persons in the legal sense , therefore abortion was not the taking of a human life . During the 1980s , however , Roe began to collapse from its own weight , and Monday ' s decision declaring that the death of an unborn child caused through malice could result in the charge of murder turns the logic of Roe vs . Wade upside down . The law has twisted itself into a pretzel : One decision declares that the fetus is not a human_being and hence can be legally destroyed ; another holds that when a person other_than the mother kills that same fetus , then that person can be charged with murder . If it ' s murder , then the fetus must be human , and if it ' s human , how can the courts allow its destruction through abortion ? This illogical legal mumbo-jumbo is what you get when a society seeks to justify laws that violate the sanctity of human life . Not only has the fetal-murder decision struck a blow for personhood , but this case also will be used to sensitize the American public to the desperate need to protect all human life . We need this sensitivity training , for one look_at our cities makes_it painfully clear that the respect for human life has greatly eroded over the last 20 years . It is obvious that much of today ' s violence and despair can be traced back to the legalization of abortion , for when one segment of our society loses its rights , then it ' s only logical that the rest of society will follow . Today , immorality runs rampant , and if we don ' t find a solid foundation on which to rebuild our beliefs and standards , then we will soon become a nation devoid_of values . What foundation is greater than that which guarantees the protection of all human life , regardless of color , religion , condition , disability or gender ? California ' s decision may result in the beginning of a new beginning . If we can legally declare that the fetus is human under one circumstance , then how long before we will legally redeclare that the fetus is human under all circumstances ?</TEXT>
