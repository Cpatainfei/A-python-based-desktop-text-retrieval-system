   <HEADLINE> POLICE , DOGS SEARCH HOME WHERE BODY WAS DISCOVERED IN FREEZER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dogs trained to find cadavers searched a basement Monday in the home of a man charged with murdering a Newport Beach woman missing since 1991 . Authorities also checked on the safety of women whose names turned_up in the files of John Joseph Famalaro , who was arrested Wednesday in connection with the death of Denise Huber . But there was no immediate sign of new victims . Sheriff ' s deputies found a battered body , later identified as Huber ' s , in a freezer inside a long-overdue rental truck parked outside a home_in an affluent neighborhood . &quot; We would be premature to . . . try to speculate if we have any additional victims , &quot; said Yavapai County Sheriff G.C. ( Buck ) Buchanan . &quot; We have not seen anything to indicate ( that ) so far . We ' re trying to keep a very open mind on this at this time. &quot; The naked body in the freezer was identified Saturday as that of Huber . She disappeared June 3 , 1991 , on the way home from a concert , leaving no clues beyond a car sitting with a flat_tire beside a Southern California freeway . Famalaro , 37 , a home remodeler and real_estate salesman , was arrested after the body was found Wednesday . He was held for investigation of murder and felony theft in the Yavapai County jail on $ 250 # 000 bail . The theft charge involved the Ryder truck , which was never returned after it was rented in El Toro in January . Buchanan , clad in cowboy_boots and hat , directed about 40 deputies and volunteers searching Famalaro ' s home_in Prescott Country_Club , a development outside this hamlet 75 miles northwest of Phoenix . They spent much of the day hauling out 3 # 000 to 4 # 000 cans of paint stored in the basement and in a 14-by-35-foot area dug_out of the hillside in which the home is set . In addition to the cache of full and partly full paint cans , the home was cluttered with boxes , magazines and other odds and ends , said sheriff ' s spokeswoman Laurie Berra . &quot; It looks_like he saved every magazine he ever got , &quot; Berra said . Two dogs and handlers from the Rocky Mountain Rescue volunteer organization in Salt_Lake_City took_part in the search . Buchanan said the dogs_showed interest in two spots in the dug-out area Sunday , and they were taken_back in at least twice Monday . Searchers in Arizona and other states worked to track_down about 10 women whose names appeared in records in the house and found at least five of them unharmed , Buchanan said . He refused to describe the documents but said at least some of the women apparently were in contact with Famalaro through his business . Sheriff ' s deputies said Famalaro ran a home remodeling and painting business , and his lawyer said he had most recently worked as a real_estate salesman . Prescott defense_attorney Lawrence William Katz said he had advised his client against public comment and refused to discuss the case other_than to say Famalaro is innocent . He refused to say whether Famalaro knew Huber or if he was aware of the body in the truck .</TEXT>
