   <HEADLINE> COALITION URGES DELAY OF GATT CONSIDERATION ; TRADE : IN A LETTER TO CLINTON , AN INCONGRUOUS GROUP OF MORE THAN 130 LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES URGE THAT CONGRESS AVOID ' A RUSH TO JUDGMENT ' ON THE NEW WORLD TREATY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An eclectic , incongruous coalition of liberals and conservatives urged President Clinton on Monday to put_off until next year final congressional consideration of the new_world trade treaty negotiated by more_than 100 nations last December . In a letter to Clinton , critics ranging from consumer advocate Ralph Nader and California state Sen . Tom Hayden on the left to Pat Buchanan and direct-mail fund-raiser Richard Viguerie on the right say Congress should avoid &quot; a rush to judgment &quot; on the &quot; vast trade agreement and its complex implementing legislation. &quot; In its more_than 130 signatories , the letter reassembles many veterans of the unusual left-right coalition that opposed the North_American Free_Trade Agreement last fall . But the plea for delay reflects that coalition ' s frustration with its inability to focus the same kind of public controversy on the massive trade treaty that developed around the free-trade agreement with Mexico and Canada . As it stands , Congress is likely to approve the world agreement later this fall . The Administration said it had no comment on the letter . But officials indicated that the President has no interest in putting_off the vote until next year . On Sunday , White_House Chief_of_Staff Leon E . Panetta identified the trade pact , along with health_care reform and a pending crime bill , as the Administration ' s top three legislative priorities this year . At a news_conference , Nader described the letter ' s signatories as &quot; probably the broadest political spectrum that has ever jointly petitioned a President. &quot; That is not much of an exaggeration : Those signing the letter included left-of-liberal writers Gloria Steinem and Noam Chomsky as well as conservative activists Phyllis Schlafly , Paul Weyrich and R . Emmett Tyrell Jr. , editor of the American Spectator . Also included are former California Gov . Edmund G . ( Jerry ) Brown Jr. ; Pat Choate , an adviser to Ross Perot ; Ben Cohen , chairman of the company that makes Ben &amp; Jerry ' s ice_cream , and singer Lou Reed . The letter does not specify the group ' s objections to the trade agreement . But most of the signatories have already made_it clear that they think the agreement could infringe on U.S. sovereignty by making_it possible for other nations to challenge domestic health , environmental and food safety rules as unfair barriers to trade . U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and other officials have repeatedly declared such concerns alarmist ; in any instance , they argue , the proposed new mandatory sanctions would benefit the United States because this nation is more often a plaintiff than a defendant in international trade disputes . The agreement will establish a new_World Trade Organization , which could impose binding trade sanctions on nations whose domestic laws it deems discriminatory to foreign firms . Under rules of the existing agreement , the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , there are no binding sanctions , because any country can block an adverse decision against its laws .</TEXT>
