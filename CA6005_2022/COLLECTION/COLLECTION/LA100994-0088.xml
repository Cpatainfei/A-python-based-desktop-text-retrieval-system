   <HEADLINE> TEAM DOCTORS FIND IT ' S NOT EASY TO JUST SAY NO TO PLAYERS ; SPORTS : IF THEY BAR AN ATHLETE ON MEDICAL GROUNDS , THEY CAN BE SUED . BUT IF THEY ALLOW THE ATHLETE TO PARTICIPATE AND AN INJURY RESULTS , THEY CAN BE SUED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Teams and physicians face a legal dilemma when someone who has a potentially disabling physical problem still wants to play . If the person is denied the chance to play_on a team in a federally funded organization such_as a public_school , the athlete could file suit , according to an article in a medical journal , The Physician and Sportsmedicine . On the other hand , if the player is allowed on the team and gets hurt , the player also could sue , the article said . At the heart of the quandary are federal laws and court interpretations of them . The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 bars excluding otherwise qualified individuals from participating in federally funded programs , said the report , written by two doctors and a lawyer . Athletes with medical problems or disabilities also can use the Americans with Disabilities Act in suing to make the team , the article ' s authors said . Another expert supports this . &quot; If an athlete has a chronic injury defined as a disability , he has full right to participate at his own risk , &quot; said Dr. Mark R . Hutchinson , a team physician , director of sports medicine services and assistant_professor of orthopedics at the University of Illinois at Chicago . The only conditions under which an athlete can be barred from play occur when his physical problems would place other athletes at risk of injury or illness , Hutchinson said . When the athlete ' s own problems do not affect others , things get murky , he said . &quot; If the question becomes that the athlete is solely at increased risk of injuring himself , even if the risk is death , we enter the ' gray zone ' of ethics and the courtroom , &quot; Hutchinson said . The results of those court actions have varied , but judges have held that Congress wanted people to be able to take risks , if they choose -- even if doctors think the choice is unwise , the journal report said . One line_of_defense is a system of screening based on standards for participation . Courts have held that , if a player or the player ' s parent signs an informed consent form that spells_out the risks involved in_playing , then responsibility for those risks can shift away from the team , the article said . In a typical system , a doctor screens the potential player and recommend whether the athlete is fit for the game . The athletic administrator , who sets the qualification standards , then decides if the player has met them . The informed consent system has to look_at &quot; all predictable risks to each individual -- not just to athletes with medical problems or disabilities , &quot; the report said . But it must point_out how problems resulting from injury to a disabled or ill player would exceed the team ' s ability to handle them , the review_article said . And it must note the potential consequences of ignoring medical advice . This doesn ' t mean a signed consent form solves the problem . The team must show that the athlete or his or her parent has read and understands the form . And even that may_not be enough . &quot; Even with an informed consent , the athlete retains the right to suit , &quot; Hutchinson said . &quot; Unfortunately , I believe that there are no crisp and clean rules to this issue until the courts define the terms better. &quot; The journal article suggests using forms with blanks that the would-be participants , or their guardians or parents , must fill_in . Another possible technique : a videotape record of the meeting in which the problems mentioned in the informed consent were discussed . The review was written by two California doctors , Robert L . Kronisch of Santa Cruz and Frank M . Flowers Jr . of Riverside , and a specialist in sports-injury law , Richard T . Ball of Northern Arizona University , Flagstaff .</TEXT>
