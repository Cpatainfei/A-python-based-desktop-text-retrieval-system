   <TEXT> Hugh Grant , peering from beneath a wide-brimmed hat , assumes his brilliant signature grin . &quot; On balance , &quot; he says , in that terribly English drawl of his , &quot; I have to say I ' m loving all this . Hugely. &quot; &quot; All this ? &quot; Celebrity , of course -- sudden celebrity of a sort no British actor has experienced in decades . At the beginning of this year , lest we forget , Grant was &quot; Hugh who ? &quot; -- one of several , almost interchangeable young Britains , winsome , well-spoken chaps who tended to pop_up in various films by Merchant Ivory or Merchant Ivory wanna-bes . But this all changed when Grant starred in one film , &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral , &quot; a respectable hit in the United States and , proportionately , an even bigger hit in Britain . As a result of that film , Grant is sought after by le tout Hollywood , has become about as well-known in his own country as Prince Charles , and is certainly more popular . Her association with Grant has made his girlfriend , actress Elizabeth Hurley , a household name , though few people could name a movie she has actually appeared in . One London newspaper_columnist , tongue only slightly embedded in cheek , has described Grant as the Most Famous Living Englishman . &quot; After years and years of obscurity , &quot; says Grant , &quot; it would be nonsense to pretend a little bit of glamour and attention wasn ' t quite nice. &quot; And yet , as he concedes , there are downsides to fame -- hard work being one . &quot; Quite apart from the acting , I seem to have to spend most of my life on the telephone talking to agents and lawyers . The stakes seem so_much higher now . I can ' t afford to make mistakes -- I have to do the right interviews , make the right films , do all_the things that never bothered me before . Well , not so_much . &quot; In some ways I miss my unemployment . I miss those long periods when I could sit at_home and watch cricket on TV all day. &quot; He tells you all this with the same insouciant charm that marked his role as the chronic bachelor in &quot; Four Weddings. &quot; Grant punctuates the serious parts of his conversations with jokes , politically incorrect or impolite observations about life and people , and shockingly funny pronouncements delivered in a mock-solemn manner . He often resorts_to English schoolboy slang ; someone he likes is referred to as &quot; a good egg. &quot; All this has the dual effect of making him both entertaining company and someone who keeps his true feelings , in best British fashion , well in reserve . One imagines Grant will have even less time to watch cricket in forthcoming years . A glittering Hollywood future clearly beckons -- but in the meantime he is still fulfilling his obligation to contracts struck before &quot; Four Weddings &quot; catapulted his career into the stratosphere . He has come_to this tiny picturesque border village to make a film with the unwieldy , charming title &quot; The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill but Came Down a Mountain. &quot; Grant plays one of two English map_makers who in 1916 arrive in a small , remote Welsh village with a single claim to fame -- it is overshadowed by the first mountain inside the Welsh border . The English cartographers make some calculations , then announce to the dismayed village that their mountain is 15 feet too short to qualify as a mountain ; it must be reclassified as a hill , and will not appear on the new , redrawn maps they are completing . Their pride stung , the villagers unite ( burying some old differences in the process ) and decide to attack the problem in the most practical way -- by physically hauling loads of earth in carts and barrows up the_hill , and piling it up at the summit to increase its height . The film , which has a budget of less than $ 8 million , also stars Colm Meaney ( &quot; The Snapper , &quot; &quot; Star Trek : The Next Generation &quot; ) ; Tara Fitzgerald , who co-starred with Grant in &quot; Sirens , &quot; and Ian Hart ( &quot; Backbeat &quot; ) . It is written and directed by Christopher Monger ( &quot; Just Like a Woman &quot; ) , who was born in Taff ' s Well , a Welsh village where these events actually occurred at the turn_of_the_century . Monger says that he was told the story by his father , David , who in turn was told it by his father , Ivor ; Monger credits them both at the end of his screenplay . &quot; The Englishman &quot; has been kicking_around for more_than three years . Its producer , Sarah Curtis , first commissioned it for the BBC , where she was then working . &quot; But it really needs a bigger shooting budget than the BBC could afford , and it needs a big screen to do_justice to the Welsh landscape , &quot; Curtis noted . &quot; Hugh was the first actor to be attached . He read the script in April last year , and responded very positively , instantly . But I can ' t say there was overwhelming interest initially . It took a while to get the ball rolling. &quot; Eventually Miramax financed the film . All this was before &quot; Four Weddings &quot; gave Grant his big break . &quot; The Englishman &quot; was to have been shot last summer , but various cast commitments prevented it . &quot; Colm Meaney keeps going_off into space , &quot; grumbles Grant in deadpan mode about Meaney ' s &quot; Star Trek &quot; role . &quot; Every time it happens we get put_off again . We ' ve just had a two-week break while he goes_off to the furthest reaches of the galaxy . But he ' s landing again shortly . I ' m a bit jealous , actually . I ' ve always wanted to do one of those space movies. &quot; Still , Grant wanted to be in &quot; The Englishman &quot; as soon as he read it . &quot; They ' re so few and far between , good scripts , &quot; he said , sprawled across two seats on the crew bus during a break_in shooting . &quot; When you find one , it ' s like a gem . You want to cradle it like a child . This was one of those . &quot; Good material is really hard to come_by . I ' ve just signed_up for one in the autumn in America , but that ' s after reading 50 , 60 , 70 scripts . that ' s all I do now -- I ' m more or less a professional script reader. &quot; Is that boring ? &quot; Quite tedious , yes . Everyone in America seems to have to read scripts from dawn till dusk . It ' s wearying . I ' m dying to read a book again . Just for pleasure . I ' m not one of those people who when they read a book they enjoy immediately want to make_it into a film . Quite the reverse . I want to protect it from filmmakers. &quot; G rant has settled next on a major studio movie , called &quot; Nine Months , &quot; which Christopher Columbus ( &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire &quot; ) will direct for Fox . &quot; I liked that script too , &quot; Grant says . &quot; It ' s a remake of a French film about a guy who ' s been in a longstanding relationship for about five years and he ' s perfectly happy . Then one day , to his horror , his girlfriend announces she ' s pregnant . And he can ' t hack it , can ' t cope , can ' t get_it together . One thing leads to another , she leaves him , and you track them through the pregnancy , month by month. &quot; Considering the heat currently surrounding Grant , his participation in any film would give it a boost . Since emerging in &quot; Four Weddings &quot; earlier this year , he has completed work in two other films -- a lead role in &quot; An Awfully Big Adventure , &quot; which continued his collaboration with director Mike Newell from &quot; Four Weddings , &quot; and a small part in &quot; Restoration , &quot; a period epic shot in England and Wales , starring Robert Downey Jr . and Meg Ryan . Competition for his services is understandably hot at present , and Grant has not endeared himself to director Allison Anders ( &quot; Mi Vida Loca &quot; ) , who believed she had an understanding that Grant would star as Paul McCartney in her film &quot; Paul Is Dead. &quot; Once &quot; Four Weddings &quot; made Grant a hit earlier this year , however , she says Grant changed his mind ; for his part , Grant has refused to comment on the situation . Grant is also highly selective about scripts , which , as he tells it , must clear three hurdles before he can consider them : &quot; Firstly , they have to be good , and secondly there has to be a ( role ) for me . And then we have to see if the part for me can be made English , because I don ' t want to play American . &quot; For me , American is a deadening accent . I did_it once , in a CBS TV movie about AIDS called ' Our Sons , ' with Julie Andrews and Ann-Margret. &quot; And how was that movie ? &quot; It was beautiful , &quot; says Grant , perfectly stony-faced before dissolving into giggles . &quot; No , it was quite good , actually . Seriously. &quot; Still , he has a dilemma here , since most of the scripts that come his way are American in origin . Grant is meeting the problem head-on ; he has a first-look deal with Castle Rock and is setting_up an office in London to look_for British scripts . &quot; I ' m a big fan of Rob Reiner , and the people at Castle Rock , it seems to me , are the company which puts the greatest emphasis on script rather than star , director or producer . They ' re all good eggs over there . &quot; My idea is to weed out our best ( British ) TV writers and novelists , and get them to write feature_films . Writing for film isn ' t the first thing that occurs to the best people in this country . I ' d better not say who I have_in_mind , because they ' ll probably spurn me as soon as I call them up . But that ' s my plan. &quot; N ot that Grant is anti-American in his approach to films , though he can be howlingly funny about &quot; taking meetings &quot; and &quot; doing breakfast &quot; with studio executives in Hollywood . &quot; It ' s easy to get snobbish about European films , but if I had to say which side of the Atlantic produced more good movies , it would always be America . They ' re really good at it . &quot; There ' s a thoroughness about Hollywood . Often if a script isn ' t good_enough they ' ll say , rewrite it and rewrite it again . In Britain , there ' s a whole culture of ' The text is sacred , darling. ' You don ' t rewrite Shakespeare , certainly , but some screenplays you see in Britain now , people are just too quick to start shooting them . Often they should get more writers in. &quot; This was what he liked about &quot; The Englishman. &quot; &quot; It was perfect . I go_through these ( scripts ) with a fine-tooth comb . If there ' s anything I don ' t like , I ' ll worry the writer about it for hours and suggest rewrites . But there was very little I could find to complain about on this one . It just works , it clicks. &quot; Colleagues on the set insist that Grant has responded well to his newfound stardom . English character_actor Ian McNeice ( &quot; No Escape &quot; ) , who plays the second map_maker , concedes : &quot; I was rather nervous , because Hugh had got_to be such a big star just before this , and one ' s always interested to see how that ' s going_to work out. &quot; Christopher Monger concurs that fame hasn ' t gone_to Grant ' s head . &quot; Oh , I have to thrash him each morning to get him started , &quot; he says in a droll manner reminiscent_of Grant himself . &quot; No , really , he works very hard . He can ' t get too above himself because the crew tease him all_the time . &quot; One day in a newspaper there was a story that he ' d been voted the No . 7 hunk in the world , or something . He got total hell from the crew , with every one of them claiming they were in the Top 6 . He ' s been great about it all. &quot; Monger first saw Grant alongside Judy Davis and Emma Thompson in James Lapine ' s 1991 film &quot; Impromptu. &quot; &quot; I thought he was fabulous , so I offered him this part . He was gracious enough to accept and he came_in with a lot of good ideas . &quot; I first met him when he was in the middle of shooting ' Four Weddings ' ; I had lunch with him on the set . And of course at that point no one had any idea the film would be so big. &quot; Monger casts an approving glance around the hilly terrain : &quot; It ' s been a fantastic bonus for us. &quot; Back on the crew bus , Grant is growing increasingly uneasy with my questions . &quot; I don ' t want this to be a major profile , &quot; he frets . &quot; I ' m happy to talk_about this film , but , ummm . . . . &quot; One particular inquiry about the dangers of media overexposure has clearly sounded a warning system in his brain . &quot; Look , sorry to be such a queen about this , &quot; he says , rather winningly , &quot; but I think I ' d better talk to my press_agent . I didn ' t know this interview was going_to be so . . . far-reaching. &quot; And he descends from the crew bus and strides off to the one pay phone in Pen-y-bont-fawr , from where he will place a call to New York . He returns 10 minutes later . &quot; Yes , look , let ' s just talk_about this film , OK ? &quot; His whole body seems contorted with apologetic embarrassment . He goes_on to say that he doesn ' t like to talk_about the characters he plays ( &quot; It ' s bad karma , somehow &quot; ) , that he dreads it when directors want to talk_about character motivation , that he ' s a believer in the adage &quot; shut_up and act. &quot; And that ' s about all there is left to say under the ground_rules he has imposed , and we stare at each other helplessly for a full minute before agreeing to end the discussion . Grant shuffles off , brows knitted in worry : &quot; Sorry about this . Umm , sorry. &quot; Yet another downside to overnight fame. *</TEXT>
