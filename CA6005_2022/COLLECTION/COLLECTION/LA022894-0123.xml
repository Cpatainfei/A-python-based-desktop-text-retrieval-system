   <TEXT> The man who discovered the secret of life is having his makeup done . He tolerates it with good_humor , like the proper British gentleman that he is . Francis Harry Compton Crick smoothes his wispy white locks as the television makeup artist brushes his face with peach-colored powder , evening the tone of his perpetually ruddy cheeks . &quot; The thing that I have to watch , &quot; he says , recalling an earlier admonition from his wife , Odile , &quot; is that my tie is straight , and that this side of my hair doesn ' t stick_out . My wife cuts my hair. &quot; This is a rare step into the spotlight for Crick , one of the world ' s most renowned , most publicity-shy -- and most free-spirited -- scientists . The secret of life , by the way , is DNA . Forty-one years ago , Crick and James Watson cracked the code for this mysterious molecule of heredity . Their story is a scientific legend : Two young_men -- Crick , then 36 , and Watson , a mere 24 -- made the most significant contribution to biology since Darwin ' s theory_of_evolution and earned a Nobel Prize . All with an article just 900 words long . The discovery that DNA is built like a double helix was nothing short of revolutionary . It has filtered into every aspect of modern life , spawning an entire industry ( biotechnology ) and prompting raging ethical debates about the perils of genetic tinkering . DNA is ubiquitous . It is in the courts , where DNA &quot; fingerprints &quot; can set the innocent free . It is in the supermarket , where designer tomatoes are for_sale . It is in the operating room , where doctors insert healthy genes into sick people . It is in the bedroom , where couples scrutinize their genetic histories in deciding whether to have a baby . And now , at age 77 , the adventuresome scientist who helped bring_about this revolution is off on another jaunt . This time , Crick ' s journey takes him to the realm of neuroscience , where he is attempting to piece together a puzzle far more complicated than DNA : the workings of the human brain . ( He has already tried to tackle the origin of life on Earth and the meaning of dreams. ) In a field where most scientists are knee-deep in the minutiae of this receptor or that neuron , Crick is the big-picture guy , seeking to answer the unanswerable : What is the root of human consciousness ? And so what if he wanders off into philosophy and religion , or if some of his ideas are a bit wacky ? He ' s Crick . He can say what he wants . These days , Crick is doing more talking than usual , which accounts_for the rare TV appearance . After four decades of refusing to grant interviews , he is reluctantly on a media tour -- a handful of 90-minute chats with America ' s top publications and a_few public television interviews ( hardly Oprah or Geraldo ) to promote his new book . In it , he attempts to do for the study of the brain what the double helix did for DNA -- lay out a basic theory that those who come_after him may prove . It has not escaped his notice that , at his age , he may_not live long enough to find_out whether he is correct . &quot; Well , of course I have asked myself that question , &quot; he confesses in his impeccable accent , over a room service lunch at the Century Plaza Hotel . &quot; It may turn_out that one is looking_at it quite from the wrong point_of_view , and everybody will say , ' Poor chap , when he went_into a new field , he couldn ' t do_it again. ' &quot; A Full-Time Thinker As a research professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla , Crick is not a typical scientist in that he does not maintain a &quot; wet lab &quot; -- meaning he does not do experiments . Nor has he ever been a full-time university professor , with the exception of a short stint at Harvard . Rather , Crick is a theoretician . What he does is think . &quot; He invites people to stay with him a week , a month or sometimes several months , &quot; said Christof Koch , a Caltech neuroscientist and Crick ' s collaborator for seven years . &quot; And then there ' s this very intensive period where you talk with him all day and evening and then you go_out and socialize and talk_about science . It ' s a very unique working style. &quot; It is also a style that only someone of Crick ' s stature could get_away with . And whether his theories prove correct seems to matter less to him than that they are thought-provoking , and that he has fun dreaming them up . Once , a colleague of Crick ' s asked his wife whether he works a lot . &quot; No , &quot; she replied . &quot; I don ' t think he works a lot . But he thinks a lot. &quot; Crick does not see anything extraordinary in what he does . &quot; I don ' t think it ' s anything particularly virtuous on my part , it ' s just that I have reached an age where I can do what I like . Not all scientists can. &quot; Besides , he added , doing experiments is &quot; more expensive than just sitting and thinking. &quot; Such self-deprecating repartee is a hallmark of any conversation with Crick . His blue eyes , shielded by unruly white eyebrows , dance as he speaks , revealing more_than a hint of mischief . He seems to enjoy amusing himself , both at_work and at_home . He drives a white Mercedes with the license_plate ATCG -- the initials of the four chemical base pairs that compose the structure of DNA . It tickles him when the garage mechanics get the joke . &quot; He has a real charm . . . He ' s sexy , &quot; said his longtime secretary , Maria Lang . &quot; I mean , he has this energy , a magnetism. &quot; It is this energy that prompts often reticent scientists to share their thoughts and findings with Crick , which serves him well as he cruises the cerebral landscape . Crick performs an unusual function in neuroscience . David Hubel , a Harvard_University neurobiologist who has his own Nobel Prize , describes him as &quot; kind of a clearinghouse for ideas. &quot; He picks the brains of the nation ' s top minds and , in his own brilliant way , synthesizes their ideas into novel theories of_his_own . &quot; He has very good taste in the people that he picks_out to talk to , &quot; Hubel said . &quot; People are always delighted to talk to Francis. &quot; In the ordinarily cautious world of science , where nothing is accepted as true until experiments have proved it so , Crick does not hesitate to go_out on a limb . &quot; He ' s got a very free-ranging mind , &quot; said neuroscientist Bill Newsome of Stanford_University , &quot; and he ' s not afraid to talk_about what ' s on his mind. &quot; Said Hubel , a bit more bluntly : &quot; Sometimes his ideas seem to be off the wall , and other times his ideas are terrific. &quot; Astonishing Hypotheses Off the wall or not , people listen . About a decade ago , Crick joined those trying to debunk the classic Freudian theory that dreams have a deep psychological meaning . Dreams , he suggested , have little significance at all . Rather , he argued , they play the role of mental housecleaner , reorganizing the brain in the middle of the night so that the memory can store information more efficiently . The theory has not been proved , but nonetheless it made news -- if only because Crick proposed it . In 1981 , Crick weighed in with his version of the origin of life . He and a colleague at the Salk Institute wrote a book proposing that life began when microorganisms from another planet were dropped here from a spaceship sent to Earth by a higher civilization . They called this theory &quot; directed panspermia &quot; ; panspermia means &quot; seeds everywhere. &quot; &quot; I decided I would like to write a book about the origin of life , &quot; Crick said . &quot; Most people think it ' s something spiritual . No ! It ' s much worse than that ! It ' s chemical ! Most people , you must have noticed , hate chemistry . So you have to find some way of discussing what is basically a chemical problem without burdening them with the chemistry. &quot; The result was directed panspermia -- a far-out notion Crick says he is not wedded to . But the book , &quot; Life Itself , &quot; was a kick to write , a fun adventure with just enough scientific footing -- and Crick as its author -- to get_it taken seriously . &quot; It ' s just a theory , &quot; he said . &quot; People seemed to think that I was a fanatical believer . . . . There was a lot of reaction to the idea from people who didn ' t actually read the book who think that I must have gone a bit soft in the head. &quot; Crick ' s current book is a tad less far-fetched , though it is creating ripples just the same . It is called &quot; The Astonishing Hypothesis : The Scientific Search for the Soul. &quot; ( He picked the name ; it ' s kind of catchy , if he does say so himself. ) If the cover is any indication of the relative importance of topic and author , Crick ' s name is at the top , in much bigger print than the title . &quot; The Astonishing Hypothesis , &quot; Crick writes , &quot; is that ' You , ' your joys and your sorrows , your memories and your ambitions , your sense of personal identity and free_will , are in fact no more_than the behavior of a vast assembly of nerve_cells and their associated molecules . As Lewis Carroll ' s Alice might have phrased it : ' You ' re nothing but a pack of neurons. ' &quot; Critics have suggested that the hypothesis is not really all that astonishing -- at least not to neuroscientists , who generally accept it as true . Crick agrees , but says he wants to convince the public that brain chemistry -- as opposed to some intangible divine spark from God -- is responsible_for human thought , character and free_will . So he uses the book to take potshots at two of his favorite targets . &quot; Philosophers have had such a poor record over the last 2 # 000 years that they would do_better to show a certain modesty rather than the lofty superiority that they usually display , &quot; Crick writes . &quot; The record of religious_beliefs in explaining scientific phenomena has been so poor in the past that there is little reason to believe that the conventional religions will do much better in the future. &quot; Skewering philosophy and religion in a book that is supposed to be about the study of the brain might be awkward for other scientists . But Crick pulls it off , and incorporates the nitty-gritty of science to boot . Crick and Koch -- to whom the book is dedicated -- believe that vision is a logical starting_point for studying the brain . The latter part of the book is devoted to experiments that Crick says might help researchers learn more about the way neurons interact to create sight . Although most colleagues give Crick high marks for doing his homework , some see him as sort of an odd duck outsider whose work is of little relevance to what goes_on in the lab . In the tight-knit fraternity of science , of course , this is not openly admitted -- not , at least , for publication . &quot; Hard-core laboratory people have a tendency to think , ' Here ' s an old_man who was bored with molecular_biology and tried to do another big stunt in neuroscience and it really didn ' t work_out , ' &quot; said Franz Hefti , a USC professor who is also director of neuroscience at Genentech , a biotechnology firm . &quot; But , &quot; Hefti added quickly , &quot; that would not be my opinion . I think neuroscience has a need for strong thinkers . Is running to the lab each morning and working_on some tiny protein in the brain really making a contribution to our understanding of human consciousness ? &quot; The Road Less Traveled In a sense , Crick faces the dilemma that every Nobel laureate must face : What do you do after you ' ve done_it all ? It is a problem made all_the more burdensome by the fame , at least within scientific circles , that the Nobel brings . As Andre Lwoff , who won the 1965 Nobel Prize for medicine , once lamented : &quot; We have gone from zero to the condition of movie stars. &quot; Different people respond in different ways . The names Watson and Crick are as intertwined in molecular_biology as Laurel and Hardy are in comedy . But the two could not have chosen more different post-Nobel paths . Watson wrote a book , &quot; The Double Helix &quot; -- a breezy , insider ' s account of the race to beat_out famed chemist Linus Pauling in decoding DNA . It was an instant bestseller , but it was published over Crick ' s protestations ; he thought it a tad unseemly , and not scholarly enough to be published by the Harvard_University Press . The book was as much about scientific pursuits as it was about the personal adventures of this odd couple -- Watson , an American with an appetite for tennis , champagne and ogling young_women , and Crick , a charming ( and married ) conversationalist who spent World_War_II doing the mundane work of developing torpedoes for the Royal Navy . And few could forget Watson ' s famous opening_line : &quot; I have never seen Francis Crick in a modest mood. &quot; ( Says Crick now : &quot; I think , apart from this curious opening sentence , I come_out rather well in the book . I think he had the wrong word . I think he wanted to say ' in a lively mood. ' &quot; ) Watson remained in molecular_biology , although he is no longer a working scientist . For more_than a quarter-century , he has directed the respected Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long_Island . And as the first director of the Human Genome project , an ambitious effort to map the entire genetic blueprint of the human_body , he was smack in the center of the DNA revolution . He is now on sabbatical in England , writing his autobiography . Crick , meanwhile , has watched from the sidelines as genetic research exploded . As a result of his and Watson ' s work , scientists are pinpointing genes for new diseases with such alacrity that they joke about the &quot; gene of the week. &quot; Yet the man who some have called &quot; the grandfather of molecular_biology &quot; says he does not regret leaving it all behind -- even as others capitalized on his discovery , striking it rich_in biotechnology . Although he does not consider himself wealthy , Crick and his wife of 44 years travel often , and have two homes -- one in La Jolla and another in Borrego Springs . It is a long way from Crick ' s starving student days , when they shared a tiny flat next door to a pawnbroker . &quot; When things got_tough financially , &quot; he said , &quot; we used to go and pawn the typewriter. &quot; The one thing Crick never wanted to be was a celebrity . He is not . For many , his name is but a fuzzy memory from some high_school biology_class . Some might say this is a function of American society , of a culture that puts actors and sports stars -- not scientists -- on the covers of its magazines . But it is also a function of Crick himself . For 41 years he has gone_to extraordinary lengths to keep himself out of the public_eye . Thus , requests for Crick ' s time and attention have been uniformly declined with polite note cards . &quot; Dr. Crick thanks you for your letter but regrets that he is unable to accept your kind invitation to . . . , &quot; the cards announce , followed by a checklist with the appropriate item marked_off : send an autograph , provide a photograph , cure your disease , be interviewed , talk on the radio , appear on TV , etc . Crick ' s secretary says keeping reporters away has been her most important job in the 17 years she has worked for him . He does not accept honorary_degrees -- not even from Cambridge , which had hoped to fete Crick and Watson last year , upon the 40th anniversary of their famous discovery . Watson went . Crick stayed home . He did make one exception to his no-awards rule , when the Queen of England bestowed on him the Order of Merit -- an accolade one notch above knighthood and one below lordship . But that , he said , was only because his wife and his secretary insisted he not pass_up a chance to meet the Queen . Thus those who are close to Crick were , to borrow a word from the scientist himself , astonished that he agreed to do the book tour . The publicist says it has been a bit of a disaster : ice and snow cutting interviews short on the East Coast , an earthquake in California commanding reporters ' attention . No matter_to Crick . He is having a grand time . Today ' s science journalists , he said , are smarter and far more interesting to talk to than those of the 1950s . And the East Coast was so cold he mostly stayed in his hotel , reading and writing instead of rushing about . Wonderfully restful . As to whether he is selling any books , he has not the foggiest idea . He is looking_forward to a bit of peace and quiet back in La Jolla , to a return to his garden and his daily swim . But 41 years after he earned a page in the history books , Francis Crick says he is finally getting used to the idea that people recognize his name . Whether they will recognize it 41 years from now , for his contributions to neuroscience , is another matter . It is the one big question that does not seem to weigh_on the mind of the man who discovered the secret of life .
