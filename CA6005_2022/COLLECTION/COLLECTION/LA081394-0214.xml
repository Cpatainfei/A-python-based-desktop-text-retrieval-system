   <HEADLINE> AQMD DELAYS DECISION ON 20-YEAR SMOG PLAN ; ENVIRONMENT : PANEL AGREES TO ANALYZE RIORDAN ' S LESS STRINGENT PROPOSAL , HOPING TO REACH A CONCLUSION BY SEPT . 9 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Under fire from all directions , Southern California ' s air quality board unanimously postponed a decision Friday on a new 20-year smog plan so that a last-minute proposal by Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan can be analyzed by a team of experts . To accommodate Riordan ' s concerns , the South Coast Air Quality Management District board created a team of atmospheric chemists and pollution analysts and regulators to analyze the city ' s proposal . The board ' s goal -- although considered unlikely -- is to reach a conclusion on the plan ' s viability by the time the panel convenes again Sept . 9 to adopt a clean-air plan . The delay came_after several months of public_debate over the AQMD ' s updated strategy for achieving clean air and only three months before a federal deadline faced by the agency and the state Air Resources Board for a completed and approved plan . Riordan ' s appearance at Friday ' s session was believed to be the first time a Los Angeles mayor has commented on smog issues before the regional board . The mayor called air quality planning the single most important factor affecting Southern California ' s economy , but emphasized that he is not trying to avoid clean air mandates . Instead , he said , he wants to spend more time looking_for more economical ways of achieving them . &quot; Put most simply , Los Angeles wants clean air and good jobs , &quot; Riordan said . &quot; I have heard it said that I am asking_for a delay in cleaning_up our air . I am not . I repeat , I am not . . . . I believe the plan advanced by the city of Los Angeles will clean_up our air faster than any of the other plans under consideration. &quot; Because the cost of cleaning the nation ' s most polluted air is steep and the impact on society is dramatic , the AQMD has struggled for years to find ways of spreading the economic burden fairly among all industries , motorists and consumers . But the latest effort drew intense criticism Friday from virtually every sector of the economy as well as from environmentalists . The plan , designed to meet federal and state health standards in Los Angeles , Orange , Riverside and San Bernardino counties by 2010 , features more_than 100 proposed transportation and industrial measures . State law requires an updated plan every three years . With Riordan ' s alternative proposal -- which emerged in detail this week -- the AQMD would move less aggressively in reducing nitrogen_oxides , which contribute to ozone and particulates , the two most severe types of pollution that dirty the Southland ' s air . Under the mayor ' s plan , an array of long-term measures using advanced technology to reduce emissions from cars , trucks and other mobile sources would be scrapped . His plan also proposes alternatives for cleaning_up particulates that include more stringent controls on dairy_farm manure in San Bernardino County and on &quot; fugitive dust &quot; that blows_off rural fields and lots . Those proposals immediately triggered negative reactions from officials in the Inland Empire , who believe Los Angeles is trying to shift much of the burden for a cleanup to their region . AQMD staff_members say Riordan ' s proposal would violate state law and endanger public health by delaying for several years a viable plan for cleaning_up particulates , which are the tiny pieces of soot and dust that can lodge_in lungs and cause respiratory_disease . Riordan ' s aides say the AQMD does not yet have a workable plan for particulates , so public health would not be jeopardized by eliminating many long-term measures and searching for less costly and more effective ones . Even though they agreed to review it , many board_members view the mayor ' s plan with skepticism because the AQMD and National Academy of Sciences rejected similar ideas in the late 1980s . But Riordan ' s plan got a boost Friday when James Boyd , executive_officer of the state Air Resources Board , said he would recommend that his panel reject the AQMD plan because it too optimistically assumes that 84 % of nitrogen_oxides from cars , trucks , trains and other mobile sources can be eliminated by 2010 . Boyd said the AQMD plan sets an unnecessary and unfeasible target , echoing one of the major criticisms made by the mayor ' s office . Boyd ' s comments are considered crucial to the success of the plan , because the Air Resources Board has veto power over it . Because the AQMD board faces logistic problems in resolving the lingering issues in a month , many officials believe the deadline will be missed by at least several months . Riordan said developing an economically reasonable plan is so vital to California that it is worth the risk of violating the deadline set by Congress . Under the federal Clean Air Act , the AQMD and state air board have until Nov . 15 to submit a final plan to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that outlines how the region will meet health standards for ozone , the main ingredient of smog . If the deadline is missed , the EPA could impose sanctions next year , including a freeze on federal highway funds and restrictions on new businesses that pollute . The AQMD also is under pressure to adopt an aggressive plan by February or face the prospect of the EPA stepping_in under a court_order to clean_up the Southland ' s air with its own proposals . But on Friday , environmentalists also opposed the AQMD version , saying the measures are so vague and unrealistic that they eventually would be rejected by the federal_government . They also rejected the mayor ' s plan as being too weak . Much of the controversy is over AQMD and EPA proposals that would force airlines , ships , trains and interstate diesel trucks to reduce emissions . Riordan and local business_leaders say the measures would devastate the economy by making the region unable to compete in interstate commerce with other major cities . AQMD board Chairman Henry Wedaa indicated Friday , however , that he would be unwilling to go easy on those sources of pollution . &quot; Let me make myself clear : It ' s time for planes , trains , ships and interstate trucking to do what our local businesses have been doing for years -- clean_up their emissions , &quot; Wedaa said . Implementing the AQMD ' s plan would cost businesses and consumers in the four counties $ 5.4 billion per year through 2010 , according to an agency economic report . The mayor ' s office says its strategy could cut the costs by $ 3.2 billion per year .</TEXT>
