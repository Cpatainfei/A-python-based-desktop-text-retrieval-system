   <HEADLINE> FASHION ; THE ALLURE OF ALLURE ; WHY IS THE YOUNG MAGAZINE A WINNER ? IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH EDITOR LINDA WELLS ' BEAUTY-BIZ-NOT-AS-USUAL STYLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If we were talking girlfriend to girlfriend about Linda Wells , there might be some downright dirty dishing going_on . She ' s smart , funny , pretty , petite , seven months pregnant and still looks fabulous . She isn ' t swollen or bloated . Nor does she have any of those nasty side_effects of pregnancy , nor thank God , does she want to talk_about them . Plus , she ' s the editor of 3-year-old Allure magazine , which has become a smashing success . We could let envy get_the_best of us and trump_up some reason to hate her , but we can ' t . She ' s too nice . Wells was in town last week on a farewell tour of her advertisers before maternity leave lays her low . &quot; It ' s just a friendly hello before I can ' t travel anymore , &quot; she said . She often comes_to California . It ' s home to her largest audience and she likes to check_out the fitness centers . &quot; I can ' t do all_the things I usually do here , like go the gyms and the treatment places . It ' s just not the same being pregnant , &quot; she said . &quot; What are you going_to do ? You can ' t take a really hard exercise class. &quot; ( OK , maybe a little bit of loathing will be allowed. ) Between breakfast and lunch dates , she arrived for tea at Shutters Hotel in Santa Monica wearing barely a lick of makeup and a navy_blue maternity suit , looking_like CEO material . No wonder Si Newhouse put her in_charge of a beauty magazine . Wells weathered the first tumultuous years of her magazine ' s launch and came_out smelling like $ 100-an-ounce perfume . Allure was named one of the best magazines by Advertising Age two years running . Adweek ranked it No . 1 in its list of the 10 Hottest Magazines of 1993 and the publication just landed a National Magazine Award for design . In the past year , advertising pages are up 54 % and the circulation is more_than 700 # 000 . ( Californians scoop_up 111 # 086 issues a month. ) Wells put her publication at the top of subscription lists by not doing beauty business as usual . &quot; We took_away the pretensions of beauty writing . The old_style of beauty reporting was to be pretentious , florid and kind of patronizing . The magazines treated the readers like imbeciles who didn ' t know how to wash their faces . We wanted to be the voice of a friend who is really well-informed , who can talk to doctors and get the scoop. &quot; Readers , though , are conditioned to the old_school . A story about juice fasting in the December issue has solicited angry calls from readers , especially since the same issue contains a story about Christy Henrich , a world-class gymnast who died in July of multiple organ failure as a result of anorexia . Readers thought that if juice fasting was in the magazine it must be recommended and were troubled that it might promote anorexic behavior . They hadn ' t bothered to read the story , Wells said . &quot; If they had , they would have seen we were quite critical of it . We presented what we found -- that it ' s not smart . If you try juice fasting , you ' re going be in a cranky mood and really hungry. &quot; While Wells takes great pains to run criticisms of dangerous health fads and articles that promote self-acceptance , the fashion section of the magazine is filled with the beautiful , young , long-legged models who foster feelings of inadequacy in anyone who is not young , thin and flawless . This does not cause her any loss of sleep . &quot; I don ' t think these two things are in opposition . Our message would be lost if we used average-looking women wearing the clothes average women wear . It may sound cynical , but the reality is , beauty is appealing . You are more likely to pick_up a magazine with Cindy Crawford on the cover than me or my cousin. &quot; Once again Wells blames our conditioning for any conflict we might find between page 76 of the November issue , where author Alice Thomas Ellis admits to living her life presuming she was a tall blonde , only to realize she wasn ' t , and page 164 , where a tall blonde stalks the boardwalk in organza hot pants and sequined knee-high boots . &quot; In the past , the stories that went_with the pictures of models told how to look_like her . Here ' s how she exercises , here ' s what she eats and if you were to follow these routines you ' d look_like her . But we don ' t do that because it won ' t happen . &quot; We don ' t print diets , step-by-step exercise programs , what to do to get_in shape for bikini season or any of those horrible compulsive stories that made those pictures more potent . Those stories said you should try and achieve that and we don ' t even imply it. &quot; Over a year ago , Wells ran a story by James Dern arguing that society still thinks it ' s acceptable to discriminate against fat people . Six months later she followed it with a story by Fay Weldon stating that it was better to be thin and receive all_the good things and privileges accorded the svelte . &quot; It was the most politically incorrect story you ' ve ever read in your life , &quot; Wells admitted . But she insisted : &quot; This is not a one-note , one-message magazine . I want a forum for a lot of voices. &quot; Her voices come_with clout . &quot; We got_off the block with good writers , &quot; Wells said . &quot; Edna O ' Brien was in the first issue , Fay Weldon , if not in the first was in the third issue . And good writers are clannish . If one has a good experience , they tell their friends and it spreads. &quot; She ' s found spas to be a big carrot enticing writers into her stable . &quot; I bet I could probably , almost , get John Updike to write for Allure if I sent him to a spa , &quot; she said . While her writers want to loll in the hot tub at Canyon Ranch spa , her readers want advice about their hair . Everyone , Wells said , wants different hair . &quot; We ' re never happy with what we have , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s women ' s biggest insecurity . I think sometimes people who get their hair colored have the truer stereotype personality than the ones born that way . I have a friend who is blond to her bones and she has to have that realized through a bottle of chemicals. &quot; Even Wells is not immune to hair-dissatisfaction syndrome . &quot; I don ' t think_of myself as a blonde . Even though I have this white-blond hair , I don ' t have a blond personality . I ' m a brunette. &quot; But not all perceived personality defects can be treated by chemicals , and Wells said this is one of the problems in the beauty industry . It preys upon women ' s insecurities . &quot; Women suffer from the desire to completely remake themselves through frizzed-out perms and bleach jobs and then wonder why it doesn ' t look good . It makes me crazy. &quot; Her mix of big-name writers , controversy and blasting the beauty biz has enhanced her reputation to such a degree that earlier this year a rumor made the rounds that Wells would soon replace Vogue Editor Anna Wintour . Wells attributes the rumor to a competitor of Vogue ' s who was trying to erode the power of the venerable fashion magazine . Most people in the fashion world read it as a testament to Wells ' success rather than a slam at Wintour . At the time Wells was vacationing in Europe , lending more credence to the rumor . Even her own assistant and publisher suspected it might be true and tracked her down to verify or discount the rumblings . If Wells aspires to another office under a different masthead , she ' s keeping it to herself . &quot; I don ' t think_about my job , or my career . I think_about how are we going_to make the magazine better , what are we going_to do next month . In terms of my fate , if the magazine does_well , things are good -- and if it doesn ' t , it ' s bad . It ' s not magic , &quot; she said with a pragmatic shrug .</TEXT>
