   <HEADLINE> MANY PROTESTANTS SKEPTICAL ABOUT ULSTER PEACE ; NORTHERN_IRELAND : THE WIDESPREAD FEAR AMONG NON-CATHOLICS IS OF BEING DOMINATED BY A RIVAL FAITH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In his office on Dublin Road , George Patton , head of the 80 # 000-member Orange Lodge , sounded a theme often heard within Northern_Ireland ' s Protestant community . &quot; We Protestants have been in Northern_Ireland for close to 400 years , and we remain very much British in our hearts and minds , &quot; he said . &quot; How long do you have to live_in your place until you can call it home ? &quot; &quot; An American from West_Virginia , &quot; he added , &quot; may consider himself a West_Virginian , but he is first an American . It ' s the same with the Protestant unionists in Northern Ireland. &quot; While Friday ' s announcement that Britain is ready to pursue talks with a wing of the_Irish Republican Army drew widespread applause and raised hopes that peace is possible in Northern_Ireland , many Protestants here remain wary . Fearing domination by the Republic_of_Ireland , which is predominantly Catholic , they still cite the Protestant Reformation as their lodestar and in some ways react much as American Protestants did_in 1960 when considering the possibility of a Roman_Catholic President . Without a doubt , the 900 # 000-strong Protestant population here is central to ending the sectarian violence that has racked Northern_Ireland for 25 years . &quot; The republicans argue that we are some kind of planters -- here temporarily -- and not entitled to our self-determination , &quot; David Ervine , leader of the Progressive Unionist Party , said . &quot; I think it is pathetic that the republicans can ' t cope_with the idea that we are British . . . . For all its ills , the United Kingdom is a liberal democracy and Northern_Ireland is part of the U.K. &quot; Protestant unionists insist on their constitutional right to self-determination , which , because they still hold a 57 % majority in the six counties of Northern_Ireland , means they would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom . In contrast , Catholic nationalists here -- and particularly the IRA and its political wing , Sinn Fein -- insist that any referendum on Northern_Ireland ' s future include voters in the Republic_of_Ireland . That impasse has worried Protestants , who believe the IRA would not have announced its Aug . 31 cease-fire unless it had received some secret assurances from the government of Prime_Minister John Major . The government denies this . But Protestant leaders like the Rev . Ian Paisley , head of the hard-line Democratic Unionist Party , and his deputy , Peter Robinson , won ' t accept Major ' s word that no secret deals have been made . However , James Molyneaux , the moderate head of the Ulster Unionist Party , maintains that the_British haven ' t made undercover agreements with the IRA . &quot; There is a deep sense of distrust that has split the unionist leadership , &quot; a diplomatic observer here said . &quot; There ' s a sense of being abandoned by the_British , which leads to a siege mentality . It ' s doubly frustrating because they want to be British but feel the_British don ' t want them . They are unionists not because of Britain but in spite of Britain. &quot; The Protestant community in Northern_Ireland has a long history of feeling betrayed by the_British government . Unionists point_out that English and Scottish settlers were forcibly implanted in Northern_Ireland in the early 17th Century . Most were strict Protestants , many Scottish Presbyterians , as opposed to the native Catholic inhabitants of Ireland . The Protestants set_up churches that continue to operate today . Moderate Protestants admit that Catholics in Northern_Ireland were treated as inferiors for centuries , while unionists controlled the provincial government and economy . In that period , sharp divisions arose between the communities , with militant Protestants contending that union with Ireland would mean religious rule by the Catholic_Church . This led Protestants to view Catholics as political subversives , which led to discrimination in jobs and housing . &quot; There ' s no doubt about it , &quot; Ervine said , &quot; the Catholics were second-class citizens . But those inequalities have been ended , from about 20 years ago . I would like to see a Northern_Ireland society based on equality. &quot; Ervine , like Patton , has been trying to reduce violence among Protestant paramilitary units , which operate under the Combined Loyalist Military Command . The units include the Ulster Defense Assn . and the offshoot Ulster Volunteer Fighters as well as the Ulster Volunteer Force . They all recruit among Belfast ' s poor , youths with loyalist slogans tattooed on their arms and parents who buy infants ' bibs inscribed &quot; Proud to be a Baby Prod. &quot; Besides the persistent threat to peace posed by this martial tradition , many here think that the moderate Protestant cause is constantly undermined by extremist outbursts from Paisley , now 68 , who calls Molyneaux , a fellow member_of_Parliament , a &quot; Judas Iscariot , &quot; Major &quot; a dictator &quot; and the Pope &quot; John Paul Antichrist. &quot; Robinson , Paisley ' s even more radical deputy , calls not so_much for &quot; no surrender &quot; as for &quot; on to victory. &quot; Of any settlement that would put Northern_Ireland under southern control , Robinson says : &quot; No politician will be able to keep the lid on the situation . It will be not the paramilitaries but the whole community which will rise_up and defeat the pan-nationalists. &quot; As one official here put it : &quot; Paisley has led his followers up and down the_hill many times . But Robinson is capable of taking them into the abyss. &quot; However , some unionists believe the Paisley-Robinson star may be waning unless the IRA renounces its cease-fire and violence erupts again . Protestants have also been somewhat reassured by recent visits by Major , during which he repeated British support of Northern_Ireland ' s self-determination . Major also agreed that inhabitants of Northern_Ireland could hold a referendum on any agreements made in future all-Irish negotiations among the political_parties and officials in London and Dublin . But Protestant skeptics wonder what the IRA position will be if there is no all-Ireland referendum to determine the province ' s future . One British official said , &quot; Most Protestants view the situation as a zero-sum game : What is good for the Catholics is bad for the Protestants and vice versa. &quot; But Molyneaux said : &quot; We ought to have confidence in ourselves . Our best guarantee for our future is in the greater number of people making_up their minds ( at ) a ballot box. &quot; Some observers suggest that demographics in Northern_Ireland , where Catholics have the higher birthrate , will eventually favor republicans in any free election to determine future rule . But Ervine disagrees . &quot; Many middle-class Catholics , the lawyers , doctors , businessmen , prefer to remain connected to the United Kingdom , &quot; he said . &quot; They have a good life here , and in a united Ireland their taxes would go_up sharply and their incomes would drop . It is incorrect to assume that all Catholics are republicans . &quot; We might see the beginnings of trust developing between our communities , &quot; Ervine said . &quot; I hope our peoples will face the necessity for change . We have too often relied_on dreams . The unionists dream of returning to majority-ism , absolute rule . The republicans dream of a united Ireland . Somewhere between these two dreams lies reality. &quot;</TEXT>
