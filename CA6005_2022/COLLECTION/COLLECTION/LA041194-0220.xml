   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE ; WITH ' SHAREWARE , ' TRY BEFORE YOU BUY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you ' re looking_for good buys on software , consider &quot; shareware , &quot; software that you can try before you pay_for it . Retail software is so cheap nowadays that nobody is writing shareware word_processors or spreadsheets anymore . But shareware remains a great source for utilities such_as file managers , calendars , anti-virus programs , games and niche products such_as wedding planning software . Where do you get shareware ? Three main places : on-line , from disk vendors , and on CD-ROMs , which come stuffed with thousands of programs . Among on-line services , your best bet is CompuServe . One way or another , just about every piece of shareware ends_up there . The best way to find it is to use the IBM File Finder ( GO IBMFF , in CompuServe parlance ) , which will search the service for the programs you want . Prodigy doesn ' t have shareware collections like CompuServe . If you want a wide-rangingcollection of shareware , you ' ll have to go_to ZiffNet for Prodigy , and you ' ll have to pay an extra fee for it . America Online isn ' t as comprehensive as CompuServe , but has lots of shareware too . Just GO SOFTWARE . On the Internet , there ' s shareware in many places ; to reach the great trove of Windows programs , ftp ftp.cica.indiana.edu ( you netsters know how ) . Disk vendors have large collections of shareware , which they sell for $ 2 to $ 5 per disk . Two of the best-known vendors are Public Software Library ( ( 800 ) 242-4775 ) and Public Brand Software ( ( 800 ) 426-3475 ) . The newest shareware source is CD-ROMs . They usually sell for less than $ 40 , which gets you a CD stuffed with thousands of shareware titles . There are many sources ; two are Public Software Library and the Assn . of Shareware Professionals ( ( 616 ) 788-5131 ) . Remember , wherever you get your shareware -- even if you buy_it on disk -- you ' re morally and legally obligated to register any programs you keep . That means paying the author . To get started in shareware , make_sure you get : * Pkzip . This package of programs lets you uncompress downloaded shareware files , or compress files to be stored or sent to another user ; * McAfee ' s VirusScan virus protection software , so you can scan whatever you get later ; * The Visual Basic Runtime modules . Many Windows programs are written in VisualBasic , which means you ' ll need these generics to make them run . They ' re vbrun100.dll , vbrun200.dll and vbrun300.dll. Some others worth trying : * Time and Chaos . If you ' re looking_to take_control of your life , this excellent &quot; personal information manager &quot; is the place to start . * ClipMate . This Windows utility lets you save all_the information you put onto the Clipboard , not just the last clip . It also lets you combine several clips into one large one . * Drag and File . This excellent replacement for the Windows File Manager includes file viewers for just about every major program -- something Windows doesn ' t have . * METZ Task Manager . Do_away_with Windows ' anemic Task Manager . * WinPost . Get_rid_of the little yellow stickies all_over your desk and computer . Use this electronic equivalent of Post-Its . * Wolfenstein 3-D . Great game : Kill Nazis and their running dogs . Escape_from the fortress . * AM-TAX . You have filed your taxes , haven ' t you ? No ? Then get this tax-prep program . * QModem . The best DOS shareware telecommunications program . * Top Fonts Sampler . Windows users can never have enough fonts , so try_out this excellent TrueType collection . * WinPaks . More fonts , icons and screen_savers . * 4DOS . For command-line junkies , a better DOS than DOS . * Envision Publisher . DOS desktop-publishing program . * WOPR ( WinWord Office Power_Pack ) . Macros and add-ins for Word for Windows , the popular word_processor .</TEXT>
