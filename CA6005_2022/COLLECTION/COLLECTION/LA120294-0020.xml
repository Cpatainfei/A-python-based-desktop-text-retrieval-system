   <HEADLINE> BERLUSCONI SOFTENS ITALIAN AUSTERITY PLAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Italian Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi backed_away from the brink Thursday , tempering economic austerity with billion-dollar concessions and persuading labor_unions to scrap a nationwide general strike scheduled for today . The agreement reached in a marathon 21-hour negotiating session with the three main unions gives breathing space to the beleaguered Berlusconi , whose right-wing coalition government now looks safe in the short term after a precarious week . The accord , reached in a marathon 21-hour negotiating session with the three main unions , followed a decision by Berlusconi ' s Forza Italia movement and its coalition partners to stay_together at least through the end of the year . Berlusconi has also lowered political temperatures with conciliatory gestures to Milan magistrates investigating him for alleged bribes to tax police by his $ 7-billion-a-year business and media empire , Fininvest . &quot; I would n ' t dream of resigning , &quot; he told a news_conference Thursday , saying he will go_to Milan to meet the judges but is setting no date . &quot; I have sworn my innocence because I am convinced of it. &quot; Labor_leaders , who had mounted a general strike and a million-strong rally in Rome against Berlusconi in recent weeks , expressed satisfaction with the compromise reached Thursday over the controversial 1995 government budget . Seeking to reduce Italy ' s sapping public deficit by $ 30 billion , the 58-year-old billionaire had proposed sharp cuts_in Italy ' s generous pension system . Thursday ' s agreement softened the blows , restoring full benefits to salaried workers who have completed 35 years of service , increasing social_security for large and poor families and boosting aid to the lesser-developed Italian south . With labor_unions now on board , left-wing parties will likely mute their opposition to the budget , which has passed the lower house of Parliament , but appeared to be in_trouble in the Senate . Now , Berlusconi ' s aides said , budget will go_to the Senate for ratification Dec . 12 , with good prospects of approval because of a constitutional Dec . 31 deadline .</TEXT>
