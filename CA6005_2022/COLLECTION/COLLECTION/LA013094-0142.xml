   <HEADLINE> VALLEY COMMENTARY ; POST-TRAUMATIC SALES DISORDER ; AFTER A SHORT-TERM DIP , SAN FERNANDO VALLEY PROPERTY VALUES AND REAL_ESTATE TRANSACTIONS SHOULD REBOUND FROM IMPACT OF THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The short-term effect of the Northridge earthquake on resales of homes_in the San Fernando Valley is likely to be profound . A temporarily stall will later give_way to a phantom mini-boom as disaster-aid dollars appear . Over time , however , the terrible temblor ' s impact will probably diminish . Prices might rise if the quake weeded_out excess or antiquated housing inventory , thus making room for new , expensive homes , but that ' s highly unlikely . Not to diminish the personal tragedy , but the destruction and damaging of an estimated 10 # 000 homes will have a relatively small impact on the county ' s housing stock of 1.7 million residential units or the San Fernando Valley ' s more_than 500 # 000 . The damaged properties represent 0.6 % countywide and 2 % in the Valley . That suggests the earthquake ' s impact will be greatest in areas most directly affected , those nearest the epicenter and in localized zones of devastation . * Unfortunately , it occurred just as the region ' s economy showed signs of emerging from its three-year recession . The sales of most of nearly 1 # 000 homes that were waiting for escrow to close were stopped cold . Yet within days of the tragedy the transactions involving those 853 single-family homes and 144 condominium sales showed signs of continuing their march forward . The same was true for households caught in the midst of a refinancing . The process stopped with the earthquake , but one week later most refinances were back on track . The quake devastated some people and rattled everyone , but it did not demolish the economic engine that propels Los Angeles and makes the city the hub of the Pacific Rim economy . Before a sale or refinance could proceed , buyers and lenders needed to be convinced that the properties had no major structural problems -- such_as a shift in the foundation , noticeable settlement , broken windows , damage to the chimney or roof , or cracks of greater than a quarter-inch in diameter in the foundation . * Members of the San Fernando Valley Assn . of Realtors reported that lenders and buyers involved in those pending transactions generally insisted on a post-quake inspection . If the property survived intact , the sale or refinance was allowed to continue . Some people believe that the infusion of hundreds of millions of federal disaster-aid dollars will provide a shot in the arm to the local economy . That may be . Yet there also is a school of thought that suggests today ' s fast fixes ultimately translate into higher taxes and diminished public_services , which , in turn , work against a vibrant local economy . In other words , disaster dollars don ' t get us ahead of where we were prior to the quake , but merely let us make_up for some of what we lost -- which doesn ' t sound like real progress . If that ' s true , no amount of disaster aid can ever make us totally whole , although time does heal most wounds . The destruction from the 1971 Sylmar quake was almost as severe as this year ' s , but real_estate values eventually returned to their pre-quake levels . Outside Sylmar , where damage was most severe , most of the earthquake ' s effect was relatively short-term . Like this year ' s quake , the Sylmar quake also came during a recession , which was_due to defense and aerospace cutbacks caused by the end of the Vietnam_War . * Will the 1994 Northridge quake drive people out of the area , thus forcing resale values even lower than the already low recessionary levels ? That seems unlikely . No significant exodus of population occurred after the 1989 Loma Prieta quake in San Francisco , which registered 7.1 on the Richter Scale , killed 67 people and ran_up a road repair bill alone of more_than $ 1.6 billion . Some areas of San Francisco prospered more_than others , and businesses reported a mixed bag of successes and failures . No doubt some people will leave . But many will decide to rebuild . Others may decide to move_into the San Fernando Valley from outlying regions -- Lancaster , the Antelope Valley -- to be closer to work and avoid the terrible traffic_jams caused by the quake . Will a new resident of equal buying power and equal skills replace each resident we may lose ? Only time will tell , but I believe that the residential market will soon resume its recovery from recession , that new industry will replace what we have lost , and that life will return to normal even before all_the visual reminders of the quake have vanished . * Hurricanes buffet the seaboard states . The East Coast suffers sub-zero winters . The Midwest cowers before terrible tornadoes . And California rocks ' n ' rolls to earthquakes . Every place extracts its price . Still the people keep coming , homes are bought and sold , and a new generation is born .</TEXT>
