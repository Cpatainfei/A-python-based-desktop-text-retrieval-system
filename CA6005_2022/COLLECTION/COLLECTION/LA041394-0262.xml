   <HEADLINE> ROBERTI RECALL EFFORT FAILING IN EARLY TALLIES ; POLITICS : THE STATE_SENATOR CLAIMS THE DRIVE IS AN ACT OF REVENGE BY THE GUN LOBBY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In early election returns Tuesday , State Sen . David Roberti ( D-Van Nuys ) was leading by a 2 to 1 margin in his effort to survive a recall drive that has been closely watched nationally as a referendum on gun_control . Roberti , the first_state politician in 80 years to face a recall , has claimed that the effort to oust him is the work of the gun lobby seeking revenge because of his support for a 1989 law banning military-style semiautomatic rifles , known as assault weapons . All five of the candidates seeking to replace Roberti if the recall succeeded avidly championed the 2nd Amendment , the section of the U.S. Constitution that guarantees citizens the right to bear arms , and gun-control foes pumped thousands of dollars into the race . At his election night party at an Italian restaurant in Sun Valley , Roberti , 54 , said he was optimistic he would win a victory big enough to persuade elected officials nationwide that they need not be intimidated by the gun lobby . &quot; I feel very , very good about it , &quot; Roberti said . &quot; They ' re going to know you can ' t shoot at us without getting fire back. &quot; Among his opponents were Randy Linkmeyer , a Canoga Park gun store owner ; and Al Dib , a retired green grocer who advocated the repeal of statutes that outlaw machine_guns and make_it illegal to carry concealed weapons . Led by the Coalition to Restore Government Integrity , proponents of the recall acknowledged that they owed a huge debt of gratitude to gun owners . But they also insisted that their movement was not a captive of gun interests and that their gripe with Roberti stemmed from a critique of the senator ' s 27 years in office . &quot; This recall is about taking government away from the politicians and the political_machines who abuse the electoral_system , &quot; said Bill Dominguez , a Van Nuys systems analyst and a leader of the recall movement at an election party at the Airtel Plaza Hotel in Van Nuys . But Dominguez inadvertently handed Roberti a public relations coup during the campaign when he had 15 guns stolen from his home -- this as the recall supporters were insisting that the recall election was not about guns but about good government . The recall measure qualified for the ballot after more_than 20 # 000 registered voters from Roberti ' s district signed petitions accusing Roberti of malfeasance in office and demanding that a recall election be held . Roberti initially planned to retire from politics , but declaring that he would not be forced_out , decided to run_for state_treasurer . Besides demonizing his foes as &quot; assault weapons extremists , &quot; Roberti ' s other favorite campaign tactic was to charge that the recall was a waste of taxpayer money . According to the Los Angeles County registrar-recorder , the cost of the special election will run at least $ 800 # 000 . With local_government reeling from the impact of the recession and the Jan . 17 earthquake , Roberti charged that the extra cost of the election was exorbitant , especially because term limits were going_to force him to leave_office anyway in December . A primary_election to pick Roberti ' s successor in December will be held June 7 . All the candidates who ran in Tuesday ' s recall election to unseat Roberti are running in the primary , as well as other candidates . State Sen . Herschel Rosenthal is among those seeking the Democratic nomination . Rosenthal , 75 , lost his West_Side seat due_to reapportionment and has moved_into Studio City as part of his bid to shift his political base to the San Fernando Valley . In its final hours , the recall campaign turned_into a battle between the National Rifle Assn . and Handgun Control Inc. , the leading adversaries in the nation ' s ongoing gun_control debate . The NRA pumped nearly $ 50 # 000 into the race to pay_for a five-day-long phone-bank operation while HCI poured money of its own into the race to pay_for last-minute radio advertising . But perhaps more importantly , HCI loaned Roberti the support of its leader Sarah Brady , the celebrated gun_control advocate . Brady , the wife of former White_House press secretary James Brady , who was severely injured in the 1981 assassination attempt against President Reagan , was the key draw at a fund-raiser for Roberti . A Times poll taken_in late March found that two-thirds of the voters in Roberti ' s district supported stronger gun_control laws . When Roberti showed_up to vote at 1 p.m. in Van Nuys , he was confronted by Tanya Metaksa , executive_director of the NRA ' s Washington , D.C.-based legislative arm . Metaksa intended to berate Roberti as a soft-on-crime liberal . Instead , she found the senator prepared to deal with her with a public relations gambit of_his_own . Accompanying the senator was Michelle Scully , who was wounded less than a year ago when Gian Luigi Ferri opened_fire on office workers in a San Francisco high-rise with . 45-caliber semiautomatic_pistol that was a copycat of one of the assault weapons banned by Roberti in 1989 . Scully ' s husband , John , was killed in the same attack . After Metaksa squeezed in close enough to identify herself , Roberti pointed to Scully and said , &quot; Here , talk to Michelle ! Her husband was killed and somehow she survived . Talk to victims of your kind of weapons ! &quot; Roberti then shoved his way through the camera crews to vote . During the campaign , Roberti was able to defuse charges that he was soft_on crime by winning the support of Los Angeles Police_Chief Willie Williams , two other former city police_chiefs , including Ed Davis , and the endorsements of numerous law_enforcement organizations . The power of Roberti ' s incumbency was evident Tuesday as Sacramento lawmakers , led by Roberti ' s successor as president pro_tempore of the Senate , Sen . Bill Lockyer ( D-Hayward ) , converged on Van Nuys to help their embattled colleague with his get-out-the-vote drive . Joining this elite crowd of precinct workers were labor_union and church activists who have had long relationships with the liberal Democrat . Recall supporters alleged that Roberti had during his 27 years in the state Legislature at the very least tolerated a culture of political corruption that resulted in criminal charges and prison_terms for three Sacramento legislators , including former state_senator Alan Robbins of Van Nuys . &quot; If he didn ' t know about the corruption he was incompetent , if he did he was corrupt himself , &quot; said real_estate_broker Dolores White , one of five candidates who ran to replace Roberti . Moreover , the recall proponents argued , Roberti was a carpetbagger ( in fact , Roberti lives in Los Feliz , well outside the 20th District ) who has championed ineffective gun_control laws instead of laws to get_tough on criminals . Here , they pointed to the fact that Roberti is philosophically opposed to the death_penalty and had praised former California Supreme Court chief_justice Rose Bird . The recall movement was able to score the endorsement of the California Republican_Party . But even this fizzled when the party ' s leading figures , including Pete Wilson , shied_away_from recall . The embattled senator also benefited from the political gaffes of his foes . Within days of the start-up of the election , Roberti ' s opponents fell_into a credibility gap after the gun theft from Dominguez ' s home . Later , recall proponents tumbled into another public relations fiasco after it was disclosed that one of their constituent groups , Californians Against Corruption , was holding a raffle to raise money for the recall -- with guns , including a semiautomatic rifle , among the prizes . Russ Howard , leader of the group , even admitted later that the raffle was poorly timed . The other candidates in the race included Dolores White , 59 , a real_estate_broker who is making her second bid to knock_out Roberti and win his seat . In 1991 , when Roberti first ran_for the Valley-based 20th District seat , White was one of nine who challenged him . The other candidate in Tuesday ' s race was Larry Martz , 51 , chairman of the American Pistol and Rifle Assn .
