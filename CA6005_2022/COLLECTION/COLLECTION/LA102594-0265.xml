   <TEXT> Of constitutions some are_well or ill adapted to summer , others are_well or ill adapted to winter . -- Hippocrates Several years ago when Army psychiatrist Dr. Matthew E . Levine was transferred to the northern Alaska outpost at Ft . Wainwright , he noticed a common complaint among his patients . During the long nights of winter , many of those who sought his help were suffering from severe depression . And when winter finally gave_way to summer , with more_than 20 hours of sunlight , the depression disappeared . His patients all had similar complaints : They ate too_much , had little energy , were irritable and had almost no interest in sex . In many cases , they had one other common symptom : a growing dependence on alcohol . Levine teamed_up with scientists at the University of Alaska ' s Institute of Arctic Biology and carried_out key research into a phenomenon that has been recognized only in recent years as a serious medical problem . Seasonal affective_disorder -- SAD , for short -- is an extreme case of the winter blues , and it strikes people of all age_groups , especially women . SAD is different from other forms of depression in that it strikes only in the winter , or late fall , and it clears_up in the spring . And it affects people who have no previous record of depression . What makes Levine ' s work particularly significant is that it was carried_out in the extreme north , near the tip of the North_American continent . SAD is a far more serious problem at more northern latitudes than it is farther south , although it can strike even in Southern California . University of Alaska chemist Lawrence K . Duffy , who headed the university ' s part of the research , studied soldiers and their dependents at Ft . Wainwright , as well as native Alaskan residents of northern villages . The results reveal that melatonin , a chemical produced by the body ' s pineal_gland and known as the &quot; hormone of darkness , &quot; probably plays a key role in bringing_about winter depression . The findings may also have important implications for another malady plaguing Alaska : alcoholism . &quot; We feel that melatonin levels are intimately involved &quot; in SAD , and possibly alcoholism , Duffy said . &quot; What we see up here is a broadening of the melatonin level because of the reduced amount of light . You just have higher levels &quot; at more northern latitudes , apparently because of the deprivation of light . Whether it is the melatonin -- or simply the lack of light -- that causes the depression remains to be proved , Duffy said . Levine and Duffy believe that their results confirm the earlier pioneering research of Dr. Norman E . Rosenthal , a psychiatrist with the National Institute of Mental Health , which suggested that simply exposing patients to bright light each day for about a week is the best treatment . Light lowers the level of melatonin . Many psychiatrists favor mood-elevating drugs , but Levine said his work showed that light worked_at least as well , and it was a lot cheaper . &quot; Many psychiatrists are more comfortable using medication , &quot; Levine said . &quot; They use it for everything else. &quot; Having a patient sit_down in front of a fluorescent light box for an hour or two each day is &quot; just too simple of a solution. &quot; Yet he found an even simpler treatment . &quot; All you really have to do is get_out for a half hour to an hour in the middle of the day , even if it ' s not a sunny day , &quot; he said . That will provide ample light to clear the winter blues . But in places like the far north , people are less inclined to do that because daylight lasts only about three hours in the winter , and it is very cold . &quot; But if you go_out and take a walk for half an hour you won ' t freeze to death if you bundle_up , &quot; he said . In addition to its now widespread use to treat SAD , light-box therapy is now increasingly used to help shift workers change their circadian_rhythms so they can sleep_in the daytime ; it is also used to assist travelers in overcoming jet_lag . * Statistics suggest that SAD affects women more_than men by a ratio of about 3 to 1 , a fact that has puzzled some researchers . It could be that more women are inclined to stay inside during the winter months , particularly in the tradition-bound villages of the north , but Levine sees another reason as well . &quot; Women are more sensitive to biorhythms than men , &quot; and the production of melatonin , which occurs when the body adjusts to the nighttime , is part of that biorhythm process , he said . &quot; Women ' s bodily rhythms are very pronounced over a month ' s time . . . . The light seems to disrupt the female reproductive rhythms more_than it does_in men. &quot; That is known to be the case among females of one species , but Levine said he hesitated to bring it up because some women might find it offensive . &quot; Poultry farmers put the lights on in the chicken_coop , &quot; he said . The light &quot; increases the number of eggs that the hen lays . So it ' s well known that light has a very strong effect on female physiology , at least for hens. &quot; The team ' s research also suggests that melatonin might play a significant role in alcoholism . The hormone reduces sleep , leading to fatigue , two factors that seem to contribute to alcohol_abuse . Studies involving the homeless in Fairbanks , Alaska , for example , showed that more_than two-thirds drank at &quot; either a highly intoxicated level or at a severely intoxicated level , &quot; and many suffered from symptoms consistent with SAD . The problem is especially serious for the Alaskan natives who live_in remote villages of the far north . Researchers from Pennsylvania State University and the Hershey Medical_Center found last year that the suicide rate for Alaskan natives was twice the national average . The most common psychiatric disorder among the victims was alcohol_abuse , leading the researchers to conclude that alcoholism was &quot; the most important antecedent of suicide &quot; among those studied . Duffy is planning other research projects into the reduction of melatonin -- and possibly light treatment -- as an aide in treating alcoholics . * Oddly enough , the Alaskan natives who live_on the northern edge of the state have developed no immunity to SAD , despite the fact that they have had to deal with the long nights for many , many generations . Yet research carried_out by scientists from the National University Hospital in Reykjavik , Iceland , shows that Icelanders appear to have developed such immunity -- recent generations are far less likely to suffer from the affliction than others living at similar latitudes in North_America . Research in other northern-latitude settings has further expanded the understanding of SAD . Scientists in The Netherlands found that giving light treatment at the first signs of the winter blues appears to prevent it from developing_into a full-blown depression . The researchers reported last year that &quot; not a single patient from a group of 16 treated this way became severely depressed during the remaining part of the winter season , &quot; whereas five of 11 who were not treated came_down with SAD . Those same researchers tried to nail_down the time_of_day when the treatment works best , and they came_up with another surprise : It made no difference if the light treatment was given_in the morning or in the evening . Other researchers have found similar results . A team from Switzerland concluded that &quot; time_of_day is not crucial &quot; for the light treatment to be effective . Most researchers , including the Alaskan team , favor the use of bright lights consisting_of several fluorescent tubes , but researchers at the University of Toronto found no significant difference &quot; in antidepressant efficacy &quot; of lights ranging from mild to intense . The color of the light does seem to make a difference , however . Researchers at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia found that green_light did not work as well as white light , leading them to conclude that &quot; broad band white light ( sometimes called full spectrum ) may be optimal for maximizing therapeutic response. &quot; There seems to be no debate over whether that light treatment does_in fact work for SAD . A survey of 159 research papers from around the world found not a single challenge to that finding . But there is no evidence it works for any other form of depression . What remains to be determined is why it works for SAD . If it is because the absence of light increases the level of melatonin , as Duffy believes , and melatonin causes the depression , then researchers may have found a tool that could be helpful in the treatment of afflictions ranging from SAD to alcoholism .</TEXT>
