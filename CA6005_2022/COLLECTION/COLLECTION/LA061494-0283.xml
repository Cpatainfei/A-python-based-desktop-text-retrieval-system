   <HEADLINE> TOBACCO PITCHMAN AGREES STARS DID NOT RECEIVE GIFTS ; CIGARETTES : BROWN &amp; WILLIAMSON DOCUMENTS OUTLINED PAYMENTS . MIDDLEMAN SAYS INFORMATION IS BOGUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Paul Newman did not get a Mercedes . Bob Kovoloff did . Kovoloff , of Encino , ran a nearly $ 1-million campaign in the early 1980s to place Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Co . brands in feature_films . His Associated Film Promotions , then among Hollywood ' s most prominent product-placement firms , often eschewed written deals with studios , claiming to rely instead on lavish gifts to members of movie casts and crews . Drawing_on internal documents leaked from B &amp; W to members of Congress and news organizations , The Times reported last month that Newman , Clint Eastwood , Sean Connery and Sylvester Stallone , among others , supposedly got expensive jewelry , cars and other items , purchased by Associated with B &amp; W ' s money . But those reports prompted indignant denials by some of the celebrities . And now , challenged on the details , Kovoloff -- a pioneer product pitchman who has faced dozens of lawsuits over his business dealings -- says that many of the goods never reached the stars . Sean Connery &quot; never got any jewelry , &quot; he said in a telephone_interview last week . &quot; Paul Newman never got a car . Sylvester Stallone never got a car . Clint Eastwood never got a car . They never got a thing from me. &quot; Although a B &amp; W audit in 1983 listing the gifts said it relied exclusively on records provided by Kovoloff ' s firm , Kovoloff last week called the listing bogus , denied furnishing the information and said he did not know where it came from . Confusion over how the money was spent was not his doing , Kovoloff insisted . &quot; A lot of ( stuff ) could have been made_up , &quot; he said . Kovoloff declined further comment , and did not return additional phone_calls from The Times . There is no doubt that Brown &amp; Williamson set_out -- years after Congress barred tobacco firms from advertising on television and radio -- to buy display for its products in motion_pictures . But in selecting Kovoloff as its Hollywood pitchman , B &amp; W got fewer results than it hoped for . The product-placement effort &quot; in our view was a failure , &quot; acknowledged B &amp; W spokesman Tom Fitzgerald . &quot; It was not an effective use of our marketing dollars. &quot; Fitzgerald declined to comment on the audit -- conducted by B &amp; W to ascertain how its money was being spent by Kovoloff ' s firm -- or on Associated ' s use of the tobacco firm ' s money . * Kovoloff , 57 , is no stranger to disputes over property and money . During the 1980s and early ' 90s , he and his companies faced a torrent of lawsuits from angry clients , landlords and employees -- a legal onslaught checked only by his bankruptcy filing in 1992 . For example : * Former clients Nikon and Panasonic won court judgments of $ 70 # 000 and $ 349 # 000 , respectively , over expensive photographic and electronic_equipment loaned to Associated as movie props but never returned . In its defense , Associated claimed it was understood &quot; that many of the products would not in fact be returned as that is the custom and practice in the motion_picture industry. &quot; * After Pizza Inn Inc. , paid a promotional fee of $ 100 # 000 , the firm &quot; instantly began to be unable to ever locate &quot; Kovoloff , said Jeff Rogers , president of the Dallas-based chain , which was listed as a creditor in Kovoloff ' s bankruptcy filing . * Florida Smoked Fish Co . filed suit against an ad_agency over what it termed an unfulfilled promise of a movie scene in which famished patrons held hostage in a supermarket were to eat bagels and the company ' s fish products . The ad_agency contracted for the placement with a Kovoloff firm . * The Trumbull County Convention and Visitors Bureau in northeastern Ohio won a lawsuit over $ 35 # 000 it paid Associated to promote the area as a film location . &quot; Nothing ever came of it . . . . We would write letters to him , place telephone_calls , and there was no response , &quot; said Darlene Russo , administrative assistant for the visitors bureau . * Kovoloff and his companies also were sued repeatedly by landlords for unpaid rent on office space and luxury homes . &quot; He ' s a deadbeat extraordinaire , &quot; said Ryan Martin , a leasing agent for a Van Nuys commercial landlord who repeatedly sued a Kovoloff firm for unpaid rent . But it is the odd tale of Brown &amp; Williamson ' s campaign to promote its brands in films that has brought Kovoloff ' s bumpy career into focus . In its 1983 audit , B &amp; W said canceled checks and other records showed that Associated had used the tobacco company ' s funds to buy , among other things , a $ 42 # 307 automobile for Newman , a $ 22 # 047 car for Clint Eastwood and $ 12 # 715 in jewelry for Sean Connery . To support the claimed gift to Newman , Associated apparently showed B &amp; W ' s auditors a canceled check for $ 42 # 307 written to Auto Stiegler Inc. , an Encino car dealership . But John Stiegler Jr. , a spokesman for the dealership , said last week that a Mercedes convertible at that price was delivered to Kovoloff , not Newman . Kovoloff subsequently acknowledged he got the car . As Kovoloff also acknowledged , Associated did not buy Clint Eastwood a car from Auto Stiegler , either , despite the audit record . Selling &quot; a car to a celebrity . . . is a big thing to us , &quot; Stiegler said . &quot; I would have known if there was any car going_to Clint Eastwood. &quot; As for Connery , his attorney stated that the actor did not receive any kind of payment for the placement of tobacco products in movies in which he performed . Another audit entry listed a payment of $ 13 # 000 to David Levy , described as &quot; assistant producer &quot; of the movie &quot; Tank. &quot; But according to the filmmakers and credits , &quot; Tank &quot; did not have an assistant producer -- nor any involvement by a David Levy . At the time of the purported payment , however , Associated did pay $ 13 # 000 to a David L . Levy -- a real_estate man who had nothing to do with the film . The money was for a security_deposit and two months rent of a West Los Angeles office and warehouse building owned by Levy . The payment was cited in court papers in a lawsuit against Associated -- one of several Levy wound_up filing for unpaid rent . * The lW documents also included an April 28 , 1983 , letter to Kovoloff from Sylvester Stallone , in which Stallone agreed for a fee of $ 500 # 000 to &quot; use Brown &amp; Williamson tobacco products in no less than five feature films. &quot; The B &amp; W audit , prepared several months later , said Associated had received $ 300 # 000 of the funds for disbursement to Stallone . Stallone ' s representatives have declined to discuss the_matter , and it is unclear where the money wound_up . B &amp; W canceled its contract with Associated Film in 1984 . Internal memos show the firm was disturbed by Associated ' s record-keeping practices and didn ' t think it was getting its money ' s worth . Moreover , the cigarette maker had just been hammered by bad publicity over the showing of a Kool cigarette commercial in a Massachusetts theater featuring the G-rated movie &quot; Snow White. &quot; A memo said Kovoloff and Associated Film Senior_Vice_President James F . Ripslinger were told the deal &quot; was being terminated because of a corporate policy decision. &quot; B &amp; W ' s parting was more amicable than that of some Kovoloff clients , who sued but were unable to collect their judgments . Collection was stymied by Kovoloff ' s 1992 bankruptcy , which wiped_out debts of more_than than $ 1.5 million to nearly 100 creditors . Despite his seemingly dire financial straits , though , Kovoloff maintained some trappings of the high life . At a court hearing in November , 1990 , involving an unpaid legal judgment , Kovoloff said he and his wife &quot; have nothing . . . . We are as broke as two people can be. &quot; He acknowledged , however , that his wife was driving a Range Rover . His car ? A Jaguar .</TEXT>
