   <HEADLINE> THEATER REVIEW ; AN OVERLONG ' PENGUIN ' TAKES_FLIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Steve Apostolina ' s first full-length play , &quot; Flight of the Penguin , &quot; at the Limelight Playhouse in North Hollywood , features a workmanlike plot and considerable promise . Unfortunately , at its present running_time of two hours and 40 minutes , Apostolina ' s inaugural effort is too_much of a good thing . Apostolina , who also performs in the play , has committed the cardinal sin of falling too rapturously in_love with his own work . Under the tutelage of director Steven Ingrassia , the love fest becomes an orgy . Ingrassia directs his talented cast to linger so lovingly over every bit of business that the show ' s emotional peaks flatten vertiginously into valleys . Still , despite pregnant pauses to shame Pinter , there ' s a sweet , rigorously authentic quality to the acting that goes_a_long_way toward ameliorating the evening ' s dramatic and directorial faults . Tony Maggio plays Rudy , a white stock boy at a huge New York bookstore who falls_in_love with black co-worker Donna ( Karen Dyer ) . Rudy has some unresolved conflicts about Karen ' s race because of a traumatic incident in his past . Maggio is typically a gifted performer , but here he seems to be straining for effect . Apostolina , who plays Rudy ' s racist pal Spot , has a nicely offhand manner that counterbalances Maggio ' s self-conscious weightiness . As playwright , however , Apostolina displays no such light hand . Streamlined pacing and ruthless editing could work wonders for this attenuated drama . At present , &quot; The Flight of the Penguin &quot; is a classic example of a play grounded by untrammeled sincerity of intention . * &quot; The Flight of the Penguin , &quot; Limelight Playhouse , 10634 Magnolia Blvd. , North Hollywood . Fridays-Saturdays , 8 p.m. ; Sundays , 7 p.m. Sunday matinees May 15 and 22 , 2 p.m. Ends June 12 . $ 15 . ( 818 ) 753-7726 . Running time : 2 hours , 40 minutes .</TEXT>
