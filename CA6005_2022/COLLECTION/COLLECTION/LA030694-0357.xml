   <TEXT> Joshua Swindell notched his first speeding_ticket at age 14 , clocking 47 m.p.h. down a hill in Diamond Bar -- on a skateboard . Fear was not in his blood . He liked to live_on the edge , to push the limit . By his late teens , the gangly , towheaded youth was a rising star in the hard-edged world of professional skateboarding , traveling and hauling down $ 50 # 000 a year , plus royalties on_his_own line of custom boards . In a world that pays homage to narcissism and nerve , Swindell found his niche . He liked to drink , party , chase women . He was brash , charming , funny and , when necessary , a fighter . Swindell ' s life was far removed from the thousands of youngsters who simply cruise their driveways after dinner or ride their boards to school . Instead , he moved among the hard-core vanguards of the sport , a rebel element hellbent on maximum risk and ultimate thrills , an assortment of taggers , rap singers , entrepreneurs and highly paid pros with back-yard ramps . Barreling through that culture , Swindell was just another free-wheeling skateboard star -- until he crashed . His fall from grace has raised troubling questions within a sport whose most avid followers tend to teeter on society ' s fringe . Swindell was one of many revelers at a private rap_music party in Azusa last July . Late in the night , he was seen escorting a disoriented young_man away from the event . The man was later found bloody and dying in a clump of bushes . Arrested on suspicion of murder , Swindell , 21 , pleaded not_guilty and is in jail awaiting trial next month . The incident has echoed through California ' s skate shops , streets and beachside skateboarding hangouts with an unsettling sense of deja_vu . Just 18 months earlier , in a sensational scandal involving one of skateboarding ' s biggest stars , Mark Anthony ( Gator ) Rogowski pleaded guilty to raping and murdering a woman at his condominium in Carlsbad . The two cases have deepened the concern of critics -- including some of the stars who lifted the sport to prominence . They fear that skateboarding ' s antisocial elements are already too strong , and that the worst impulses of wayward youth are being fed by the sport ' s multimillion-dollar marketing machinery . Ads , magazines and videos produced by current and former stars are often directed toward dysfunctional teen-agers and do little but encourage reckless behavior , they say . &quot; What ' s happened is that the sport ' s now run primarily by a bunch of young kids who don ' t have . . . ( much ) perspective , &quot; said Stacy Peralta , 35 , one of skateboarding ' s top stars and entrepreneurs throughout the 1970s before becoming a television director . &quot; It just seems like nobody gives_a_damn anymore . . . about the kid on the street. &quot; Skaters see it differently . To many of them , society is the enemy -- a rigid , nameless grid of rules and attitudes . Those rules include bans against skateboarding in city after city . To them , being a skater means being a rugged survivor , a target of bias and police harassment , a refugee of skate parks closed because of liability lawsuits . Skaters are not out_to hurt anyone , said Christian Hosoi , 26 , a superstar since turning pro at the age of 14 . But they are angry . Hosoi says they have a fire burning inside them to set their own rules , to skate where they please , to grab for all they can -- and that becomes their reason for living . &quot; Skateboarders are headstrong . . . radical and extreme people , &quot; said Hosoi , who once appeared in one of the sport ' s leading magazines smoking a marijuana_cigarette . &quot; They want to let_out their aggression through their art_form , and not through their fists , or guns , or destruction or self-destruction. &quot; Throughout its cyclic evolution , skateboarding has soared and plunged through booms and busts and periods of inner turmoil . When the pastime first emerged in the late 1950s and early ' 60s , it was the province of generally clean-cut youngsters in California beach towns , where metal wheels were nailed onto 2-by-4s and kids called it &quot; sidewalk surfing. &quot; No one took it seriously . It died_out , then flourished again , with a harder edge , in the mid-1970s . Metal wheels gave_way to smoother polyurethane , and top riders discovered the rapture of contoured swimming_pools . A revolutionary move -- &quot; the Ollie , &quot; a hard down-kick on the tail of the board combined with a jump -- enabled skaters to become airborne . So , like primordial creatures , they ascended from the sidewalks onto curbs , handrails , picnic tables and other improbable venues . &quot; In the ' 70s , you had people bribing helicopter pilots with ( drugs ) to spot empty pools , &quot; said writer Neil Feineman , who is completing a history of the sport . &quot; You were talking_about a group of particularly dysfunctional kids . They didn ' t get their emotional security from home ; they got_it from their skate friends. &quot; The best-known pros hung_out in Santa Monica and called themselves &quot; Dog Town , &quot; which &quot; became slang for an aggressive , radical kind of skater , &quot; Feineman said . &quot; They influenced all_of skating , as we know it. &quot; Former Dog Town skateboarder Jay Adams , now 33 , recalled &quot; sneaking_in people ' s back yards and draining out their pools . . . destroying hotel_rooms . . . drinking and ( using ) a little drugs. &quot; Eventually , Adams drifted into the punk_rock scene and one night , in a melee outside a Hollywood club , a gay_man was beaten to death . &quot; I got arrested for murder , convicted of assault , &quot; Adams said , expressing regret over the incident . &quot; ( But ) I never even touched the guy who ended_up dying. &quot; By the time he finished serving two months in Los Angeles County Jail , Adams was out of skateboarding . The sport was changing . Dog Town died_out . Another down cycle was followed by a new talent explosion -- and a cleaner direction -- in the mid-1980s . Lanky young Tony Hawk of Carlsbad burst onto the scene as the Michael Jordan of four-wheeled aerials , prompting a feature in Sports Illustrated . Peralta , the first pro to become a major entrepreneur , popularized skateboarding videos and assembled a sort of &quot; Dream Team &quot; of touring stars who earned $ 100 # 000 to $ 250 # 000 a year . He took pains to keep his athletes off drugs and to develop new talent slowly , Peralta said . Young skaters spent two years , on average , competing as amateurs before being considered for lucrative pro contracts . &quot; If you take a kid that ' s 13 years old , or 16 years old , and start paying him $ 10 # 000 ( a month ) , that can blow his mind , &quot; Peralta said . But after hitting a peak in the late 1980s , skateboarding started to retrench . Faced with a money squeeze , the industry began to abandon much of the mainstream to pursue mostly hard-core followers : teen-agers willing to plunk_down $ 70 to $ 100 for the latest board , or willing to bloody themselves on the street emulating the miraculous moves of the hottest talents . &quot; Right now we ' re really talking_about . . . the ones for whom skateboarding is a lifestyle , &quot; said youth marketing consultant Irma Zandl of the Zandl Group in New York . &quot; There ' s a lot of pride in getting hurt , in living ( hard ) and really taking it to the edge. &quot; For evidence of that attitude , one need only peruse the pages of Big Brother magazine , the brash , uncensored voice of skateboarding ' s young iconoclasts . Among its fare : an account of the night that its publisher hired strippers for several of his pro skaters ; a &quot; how-to &quot; guide_on committing suicide , and a feature suggesting &quot; 18 Ways to Be an Ass----. &quot; ( No . 18 : &quot; Run_around town dressed as a clown and kick pregnant women in the stomach. &quot; ) The magazine ' s most jarring and controversial image surfaced in December : an ad for a new company , Bitch Skateboards . In the ad , a figure of a man stands next to a figure of a woman ; he raises a handgun to her head . The ad has touched_off a firestorm of protest among parents , particularly in El Segundo where the magazine is published . Bitch founder Sal Rocco Jr . says the ad was merely a joke aimed at a rival company called_Girl . He said he has no regrets . Violence , Rocco said , is everywhere -- in movies , even cartoons . And that is why some of the best-selling skateboards picture Charles Manson sporting a swastika or women in lingerie , bound and gagged . &quot; The kids today are punks . . . . They tag and smoke weed and drink and most of them get prostitutes , &quot; the 26-year-old Rocco said . &quot; that ' s the big thing now -- when they turn pro they get a whore . It ' s like a college initiation. &quot; No one can say which came first : the bad behavior or the culture that promotes it . Either way , experts say , they feed off each other and can be damaging . &quot; I know one thing . . . we need to do a better job of teaching our young people to reject offensive , violent and disrespectful messages , &quot; said Michael S . Josephson , founder of the Joseph and Edna Josephson Institute of Ethics in Marina del Rey . &quot; These messages go_to abnormal people as well as_to normal people . And abnormal people , fed the right diet and right dose , can be extraordinarily dangerous. &quot; In the wilder corners of the sport , skaters say the magazines are just harmless humor and they offer no apologies for their hedonistic philosophies . &quot; With skateboarding comes the drugs and sex . . . but that ' s second , &quot; said Eddie Reategui , 26 , who turned pro at the age of 16 and still skates in a $ 40 # 000 , peanut-shaped pool in his back yard in Huntington Beach . &quot; Skateboarding is the most important thing in our lives. &quot; Hosoi , Reategui ' s partner in a shop called Focus Skateboards , grew_up in Los Angeles ' Mid-Wilshire district , smoking marijuana as naturally as others smoke tobacco . Deploring the lack of public skateboarding facilities , he spoke defiantly : &quot; What we ' ve got_to do is what we ' ve got_to do -- go skateboarding . ( Teen-agers ) are not going_to stop skating because they ' re going to ruin some marble bench . If it comes_to scraping_up a handrail in front of some million-dollar corporate building , I don ' t think we ' re going to think_twice about it. &quot; Kareem Campbell , a 20-year-old pro from South-Central , said he has been in &quot; 20 or 30 &quot; fights in the last five years because non-skaters taunt him . They call him &quot; an Oreo &quot; or an &quot; Uncle_Tom &quot; for skating and being black , he said . He sets them straight . Since turning pro two years ago , however , he has begun savoring the best of what skateboarding has to offer -- travel , women and good times . &quot; You can party , like , 24 hours a day , &quot; he said . Wild times and brazen ads are one thing ; murder is another . Even in a sport where petty trespassing and vandalism are often celebrated as youthful high_jinks , there were lines that were not crossed -- until Gator Rogowski . High-flying Rogowski was one of the brightest stars skateboarding had produced when he raped , then suffocated , a 21-year-old friend of his ex-girlfriend in his Carlsbad condo . The crime , three years ago this month , was skateboarding ' s greatest scandal , making national headlines . Rogowski was only 25 . The girlfriend had dumped him for another man . Unable to find her , he took revenge on her close friend . He buried the body in the desert . Eventually , he broke_down and apologized in a written statement to the court , blaming his actions in part on pornography : &quot; Smut becomes food for thought , then fuel for action , equivalent_to the most entrapping of drugs. &quot; But there were deeper factors . &quot; Gator . . . had something in him that would make him snap , &quot; one former friend said . A psychiatric report prepared during his trial seemed to support that opinion . Rogowski had been an abused child , a psychiatrist noted . A drug_user at 17 , then an alcoholic , Rogowski was rigid , oversensitive and manic-depressive . He also showed some psychotic symptoms , the psychiatrist concluded . If the Rogowski case sent a tremor through the skateboard world , Joshua Swindell has triggered the aftershock that raises questions about the direction in which the sport is heading and what role , if any , it played in the troubles of its stars . Swindell had driven_up from Carlsbad with Danny Way , another top star , to attend a rap party at a rented bar . A scrawny man named Keith Ogden crashed the event , according to court records . Witnesses would later testify at a preliminary hearing that Ogden , 31 , approached Way outside the bar and flashed some bills in an apparent bid to buy sexual favors . When Ogden persisted , according to Way ' s testimony , Way knocked him out with one punch -- after which a club bouncer did the same to Way . Both men were dragged inside . Later in the night , several attempts were made to send Ogden away ; the last involved Swindell and a 17-year-old skateboarding friend . They were seen dragging and kicking Ogden across a street , one witness testified at the preliminary hearing late last year . Ogden ' s body was found in the bushes a short while later . He was dead before paramedics could save him . &quot; His face was beaten beyond recognition , &quot; said Deputy Dist . Atty . Patricia Ryan . Although no one reported seeing the attack , police arrested Swindell and his friend on murder_charges . Each has pleaded not_guilty , contending that Ogden -- who had sneaked_out of a hospital only days earlier -- was dying from a blow to the head he had received before his encounter with them . Despite Swindell ' s reputation as a loudmouth and attention-seeker , he was not regarded_as having as troubled a personality as Gator ' s . &quot; He ' s not like a Jeffrey Dahmer . . . . He ' s just a punk kid , &quot; former top pro skateboarder Rodney Mullen said of Swindell . &quot; He ' s a little tough , yeah , but there were so many people so_much tougher. &quot; Raised in Diamond Bar by parents who were bitterly divorced when he was in his early teens , Swindell grew_up rebellious , outspoken but honest , said his father , Joe . The young Swindell liked to look_out for the underdog ; more_than once , he fought to defend a neighbor boy born clubfooted , the father said . Still , there were brushes with authority . The most serious made Swindell something of an outlaw hero in January of last year , when he and a friend left a skating show in San Diego , started drinking and were arrested in Mexico after firearms were found hidden in a team van . Thrasher , another skateboarding magazine , ran a headline -- &quot; Jailed . . . first Gator , now Swindell , you ' re next ! ! ! &quot; -- along with an interview with Swindell in a Tijuana holding cell . The skater complained about a cellmate &quot; singing Menudo songs all night long &quot; and boasted of bloodying the mouth of a man who wanted his shoes . Annie Swindell worked three months to free her son , by which time Swindell seemed &quot; hardened , &quot; according to one friend . The skater designed two new boards illustrating life behind bars ; in one , his own face appeared in the cross-hairs of a guard ' s rifle . &quot; Angry at the world , &quot; said one friend , who asked not to be identified , in describing Swindell ' s attitude . &quot; I ( thought ) , ' This guy ' s going_to jail sometime , or this guy ' s going_to be dead. ' &quot; Annie Swindell has a much different opinion . At the time of the Azusa party , her son was getting his life together , learning to face responsibility . He was probably trying to send Ogden away for his own good , she said . The arrest was just another act of bias against skateboarders . &quot; When Josh fought with the guy , the guy ran , literally stumbling across the street to get_away from him , &quot; Annie Swindell said . &quot; ( That was ) the last moment Josh saw him -- alive. &quot; In a visitor ' s booth at Los Angeles County Jail , where he talked on condition that the case not be discussed , the young skateboarder seemed in good_spirits , glad for company . Boyish and glib , he chatted about &quot; the nightmare &quot; of Mexican jail , about allegedly bribing authorities there and about the enormous dedication that professional skateboarding requires . A story came_to_mind -- an incident that he said shows what a bad rap skateboarders get : Swindell remembered when a friend came_out with a board design , a step-by-step graphic illustrating how to make a pipe_bomb . One of the boards and some apparent bomb-making materials were confiscated from some teen-ager ' s locker , in New York or someplace . &quot; They were trying to blame ( the skater ) for it , &quot; Swindell said , incredulously , grinning as a guard arrived to reapply the handcuffs and lead him back to his isolation cell .</TEXT>
