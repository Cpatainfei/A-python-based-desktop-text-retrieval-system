   <HEADLINE> PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M . KRISTOF : SAVINGS BONDS : SOMETIMES CONSERVATISM PAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The dowager of the investment world -- the U.S. Savings Bond -- has become more attractive to long-term savers since the Treasury_Department announced that the bond ' s variable rate soared 1.22 percentage_points -- the second-biggest jump in history . With yields approaching 6 % and rising , it may be time to take a new look_at these conservative investments . Indeed , because Savings Bond yields are adjusted every six months , the bonds offer unique opportunities in times of rising rates , assuming investors don ' t mind locking_up their money for a_few years . that ' s because investors who hold Savings Bonds for five years or more get the higher of either a guaranteed 4 % return or a market-based rate . The market-based rate is 85 % of the five-year Treasury_note average , currently 5.92 % . Why not just buy a five-year Treasury_note ? Because in times of rising interest_rates , there ' s no upside on the notes . You get the contracted interest_rate -- no more , no less . Assuming you hold the bond to maturity , you also get your principal back . But if interest_rates continue to rise , you may miss opportunities to earn more in the meantime . Also , unless you buy directly from the Federal_Reserve_System , you pay brokerage commissions when trading Treasury_bills , notes and bonds . Savings Bonds are sold without fees through banks , thrifts and some credit_unions . Some large employers also sell the bonds through employee thrift plans . And for bonds purchased after 1982 , the interest_rate is adjusted every six months . The result : Even though you ' re investing for a relatively long period , the interest_rate is calculated to give you the same return as if you had purchased a six-month certificate_of_deposit and rolled the money into a new CD each six months for five years . In other words , if you hold the bond for five years or longer , you don ' t miss out on interest_rate upswings . After five years , you can cash_in the bond or hang_on to it for as long as 30 years . After 30 years , it stops earning interest . The catch ? For one thing , the market-based rate calculation that can help you in times of rising rates can hurt you when rates are falling . People who bought Savings Bonds in November , 1982 , for example , were told that the market-based rate was 11.09 % , which was true for the next six months . After that , however , interest_rates began to fall fast , and the new market-based rates began to eat_away at the total interest the bonds would pay . The end result : The actual interest_rate on these 1982 bonds , if cashed_in today , would amount to just 7.5 % annually . Also , Savings Bonds are rotten investments for short-term savers or for anyone who needs regular income from investments . Unless you ' re facing a dire emergency , you ' re barred from cashing them in_for at least six months . If you cash_in a bond purchased after 1993 within five years , you get the pallid 4 % guaranteed rate instead of the market-based rate . The market-based rate is only for those who hold their bonds five years or longer . A Savings Bond continues to pay interest for 30 years from the date of purchase , regardless of the maturity_date , says Peter Hollenbach of the Treasury_Department ' s bureau of public_debt . And because they ' re obligations of the U.S. Treasury , the bonds are secure and the interest earned on them is free from state and local taxes . You do have to pay federal tax on the earnings , but not until the bonds are cashed_in . * Still , these bonds are more complicated than they appear , so investors need to be cautious , says Daniel J . Pederson , president of Savings Bond Informer , a Detroit-based consulting_firm , and author of a new book , &quot; U.S. Savings Bonds. &quot; While it ' s easy to buy and redeem the bonds , the way interest is calculated can be deceiving . For instance , on bonds purchased after 1993 , interest accrues each month for the first five years , or 60 months . After that , it ' s paid just twice annually . If you cash_in a bond the day before the interest is paid , you miss out on nearly six months of earnings . In dollars and cents , that means somebody holding a $ 1 # 000 bond at 6 % would lose $ 30 . There is nothing on the face of the bonds to indicate the interest_rate you ' re entitled to or when the bonds are guaranteed to mature . And because guaranteed interest_rates have changed numerous times and market rates change often , neither question is easy to answer . You are charged with knowing the rules -- or learning them by asking a banker or the Treasury_Department for a &quot; Table of Redemption Values , &quot; otherwise known as a PD-3600 . To find_out what a particular Savings Bond is worth , go_to any bank that sells the bonds and ask to see the redemption tables . By looking_at these , you should be able to determine the current value of each bond you hold . If you can ' t find a helpful local banker , you can get a table of redemption values directly from the Treasury . Just send a postcard with your name_and_address , requesting a PD-3600 . This is a table that shows the value of $ 50 and $ 25 notes and bonds . ( If you own $ 100 bonds , double the value of the appropriate $ 50 bond. ) Send requests to Savings Bond Marketing Office , 800 K St . NW , Suite 800 , Washington , D.C. 20226 . * Kathy M .
