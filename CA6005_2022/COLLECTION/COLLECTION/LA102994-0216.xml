   <HEADLINE> RELIGION JOHN DART ; REFORM JEWISH HIGH_SCHOOL CARVES NICHE IN CITY ON A HILL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The nation ' s only Reform Jewish high_school next month will move to temporary classrooms on what eventually will be a $ 25-million campus hugging a hillside in the Sepulveda Pass amid a cluster of Jewish institutions . The school was launched three years ago by the 3 # 000-family Stephen S . Wise Temple of Bel-Air , the second-largest synagogue in the country . But the impending move is a big step upward for the temple ' s ambitious effort to demonstrate that a relatively liberal , non-Orthodox high_school can fill the Judaic education gap for teen-agers who might otherwise drift away from Jewish culture and faith . &quot; Teen-age education is critical to the future of Jewish life in America , &quot; said the temple ' s senior rabbi , Isaiah Zeldin . Many Reform and Conservative synagogues &quot; have day_schools up_to the age of 13 , but we do very poorly beyond the bar and bat_mitzvahs , &quot; Zeldin said , referring to the Jewish coming-of-age ceremonies for adolescents . &quot; Orthodox synagogues have had high_schools for 50 years , but with our elementary , middle_school and now high_school classes , &quot; Zeldin said , &quot; we have the only non-Orthodox K-through-12 school west of Chicago. &quot; The Stephen Wise Community Middle / High_School has not only a well-to-do congregation behind it but a culturally rich location -- &quot; a little piece of Jewish heaven , &quot; in the words of Headmaster Bruce Powell . The elongated 9.7-acre campus runs_along Mulholland Drive just west of the San Diego Freeway and up from the Skirball Cultural Center under construction on Sepulveda Boulevard . The cultural center is being built by Hebrew Union College , another Reform Jewish institution . Slated for opening by next fall , the center will feature a museum and an academic conference_center devoted to the theme of &quot; exploring the American Jewish experience , &quot; said Executive_Director Cindy Miscikowski . Across from the center_on the eastern side of the freeway , also off Mulholland Drive , is the Conservative-aligned University of Judaism , and further up the_hill , the Stephen S . Wise Temple . The high schoolers , who now take classes in rooms at the temple , have library privileges and access to a science laboratory at the University of Judaism , and that will continue , Zeldin said . The Los Angeles City_Council approved the building project in February , after modifications were made in the plans last year to meet objections by some neighbors worried about school-related traffic . The school will be limited to 165 students for several years while classes are held_in temporary modular buildings on the site . Although current enrollment is 195 students in grades 9 through 12 , Powell said that at any given time about three dozen students will be at the old site in science or physical-education classes . The second phase of construction , due_to be completed by 1997 , will permit an enrollment up_to 650 students , including seventh- and eighth-grade students who now meet in temporary buildings further west on Mulholland Drive . Permanent facilities at the east end of the campus closest to the freeway will include a three-story building for classes and offices as well as library , gymnasium and multipurpose facilities . &quot; The ( roof of the ) building can ' t be more_than 15 feet above Mulholland Drive , so the main building will only be three stories at the base of the hillside , &quot; the rabbi explained . Also , as stipulated by the city , the school will plant bushes and trees along a narrow , 2 # 000-foot stretch between Mulholland and the school property . To alleviate traffic , the school will continue to shuttle many students by bus from parking_lots in the San Fernando Valley and the Westside . Powell said that the temple ' s schools draw equal numbers of students from north and south of the Santa Monica Mountains . &quot; We ' ve had a middle_school for close to 15 years now , &quot; Zeldin said . Some of the graduates went_on &quot; to a community high_school in the Valley run_by the Conservative movement , the Einstein Academy , &quot; the rabbi said , but that school never enrolled more_than 100 students and eventually closed . Tuition is about $ 11 # 000 a year at Stephen Wise Community Middle / High_School , but Zeldin said the school has a liberal scholarship policy . &quot; If a family can pay only half , then they pay half , &quot; he said . The student body has a degree of cultural diversity . &quot; We have a sprinkling of Asian , black and other non-Jewish students as well as Iranian and Russian Jews , &quot; Zeldin said . However , even non-Jewish students are required to take classes in Hebrew and Jewish studies , he added . Although the high_school functions under the aegis of a Reform temple , the educational aim is broadly Jewish -- albeit without adhering to some of the traditionalist Jewish law_practiced in Orthodox Judaism . Food served at the high_school will be kosher , but the rabbi said that lunches brought by students won ' t be examined to see if they meet dietary rules . * &quot; The philosophical shift is one that values both traditional and modern interpretations of Jewish life , &quot; said Powell , the headmaster , who previously served as principal for secular courses at Yeshiva University High_Schools , an Orthodox organization in Los Angeles . &quot; Half of our faculty for Jewish studies at our new high_school is affiliated with Reform and half with Conservative synagogues , &quot; Powell said . For Zeldin , 74 , the synagogue ' s schools have been a major accomplishment for Jewish education during his 31 years as the congregation ' s spiritual_leader . But he also demonstrated the more mundane enthusiasms associated with high_school spirit . Only minutes into an initial interview , Zeldin marveled over the 14-7 water-polo victory by the Stephen Wise Wildcats over Calabasas High . An upset , he boasted .</TEXT>
