   <HEADLINE> TENNIS / AUSTRALIAN OPEN ; MARTIN , SAMPRAS WILL PLAY ALL-AMERICAN FINAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Todd Martin undermined Stefan Edberg ' s serve-and-volley game today , winning three tiebreakers to set_up an all-American final at the Australian Open . Martin , seeded ninth and playing in his first Grand_Slam semifinal , defeated the fourth-seeded Swede , 3-6 , 7-6 ( 9-7 ) , 7-6 ( 9-7 ) , 7-6 ( 7-4 ) in 3 hours 50 minutes . In the All-American championship match , Martin will face top-seeded Pete Sampras , who defeated third-seeded and two-time defending champion Jim Courier , 6-3 , 6-4 , 6-4 . Edberg , whose right knee was treated early in the match , was overwhelmed at times by the power of Martin ' s backhand returns . &quot; Today I think I believed_in myself a little bit more and I did what I had to do , &quot; said Martin , whose best previous Grand_Slam performance was the quarterfinals at last summer ' s Wimbledon . Martin missed several passing_shots by inches in the first set , when Edberg used lobs to strand the American at the net . But those passing shots began hitting during the second set . Martin led the second set , 5-3 , but lost three consecutive games before capturing the 12th game and the tiebreaker . Edberg saved three set_points in the third-set tiebreaker , including one easy putaway at the net that Martin slammed way long . But Martin prevailed on his fourth set_point , passing Edberg with a forehand_shot and punching the air in triumph . Martin also won the fourth set_in a tiebreaker , though it took four match_points to finish_off Edberg . On the final point , he slammed an ace down the middle , then hit a ball high into the stands and raised his arms in triumph . Until then , the 23-year-old from Lansing , Mich. , never varied from his mild-mannered ways . He apologized after almost hitting a ballboy with a shot , and lifted his finger to his mouth to quiet a spectator who yelled happily after an Edberg double-fault . On Thursday , Gabriela Sabatini stood helplessly at the back of the court as drop_shots landed just on her side of the net . She lunged in vain for angled cross-court shots that skipped by her for winners . But the final indignity for Sabatini in her semifinal loss to Aranxta Sanchez Vicario came late in the match when she turned her back to the net after hitting a ball out . Sanchez Vicario , not sure if the ball was going_to be out , reached for it and lifted a lob that hit the frustrated Sabatini in the back . It took slightly more_than a total of two hours for second-seeded Sanchez Vicario and top-seeded Steffi Graf to win semifinals . Graf , seeking her fourth Australian Open title in seven years , overpowered Kimiko Date , 6-3 , 6-3 , then Sanchez Vicario defeated Sabatini , 6-1 , 6-2 .</TEXT>
