   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA , CHECHNYA TRADE CHARGES AS GROZNY OIL_REFINERY BLAZES ; CAUCASUS : SOME FEAR NEARBY AMMONIA TANKS COULD BLOW ; NO EVACUATIONS ORDERED . MOSCOW DENIES BOMBING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chechnya ' s biggest oil_refinery complex burned_out of control Friday after reportedly being struck by Russian bombers , and Chechen officials warned that the blaze could spread to a nearby tank containing 5 # 000 tons of explosive ammonia . &quot; If it catches_fire , an ecological disaster will hit the entire North Caucasus , &quot; a Chechen Foreign Ministry official told Interfax news_agency . The &quot; Vremya &quot; television_program reported that rivers of oil were_on fire , raising the possibility of damage to a critical pipeline built to pump Caspian Sea oil from Azerbaijan to the complex of three oil_refineries in the Chechen capital of Grozny . &quot; The whole refinery complex is_on fire , but the situation with the pipeline is unclear , &quot; said Marina V . Rodionova , press chief for the Russian Ministry of Emergencies . She said only 10 to 20 tons of ammonia remain in the storage_tank , and no evacuation is needed . Later , the Russian Defense Ministry said an explosion could endanger human life within a radius of 1.2 miles , depending_on wind and weather . Reports from Grozny said the ammonia tank is 800 yards from the burning refineries , but no evacuation plans were announced . Russian officials insisted that they had not bombed the oil complex . &quot; All oil_refineries have been mined on orders of the Chechen leadership and can be blown_up at any moment , &quot; a government press service statement said . &quot; The refineries are protected by reinforced detachments of Chechen militants . Russian units that attempt to reach them will suffer heavy losses . &quot; Not a single refinery came under bombing or artillery attack , &quot; it added . Whatever the cause of the refinery fire , Chechen officials said it has deprived nearby residents of one of their only sources of clean drinking_water -- melted snow . City water_supplies have been turned_off for days , and people had been surviving by heating snow that is now covered with a black film of oil . * President Dzhokar M . Dudayev of Chechnya , reportedly holed_up in a bunker under his presidential palace , appealed_to Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin for a New Year ' s cease-fire starting at 8 tonight Moscow time . For a second day , Dudayev announced that he is ready for peace talks with the Kremlin , but he told &quot; Vremya &quot; that he has one condition : no disarmament of the Chechen people . Moscow insists on disarming the separatist fighters it refers to as &quot; criminal gangs &quot; and &quot; illegal armed formations. &quot; For a second day , Russian officials said they had received no communications from Dudayev . Yeltsin ' s chief_of_staff , Sergei A . Filatov , made_it clear that Moscow would negotiate only the terms of surrender . Filatov said the quantity of weaponry in Chechnya also poses a security threat to other North Caucasus regions . While acknowledging that the war to crush Chechnya ' s 3-year-old declaration_of_independence has become &quot; protracted and ugly &quot; and that &quot; we have made a series of mistakes , &quot; Filatov said the time when the conflict could be resolved without force has passed . The Kremlin ' s horrendous image problem worsened Friday as lawmaker Leonid N . Petrovsky returned from Grozny to report that Russian airplanes were shelling and bombing villages packed with terrified refugees . Petrovsky said Russian troops had told him that they did not want to fight ; Russian POWs told him they believe that their government doesn ' t want them back because they were captured after refusing to shoot civilians , and Chechen farmers who had never fought before told him that they were taking_up weapons to exact revenge on the Russians who had slain their families . &quot; Air_raids on Grozny have been partially stopped , but at_the_same_time they have intensified in villages packed with refugees , &quot; he said . &quot; Civilians and children are there , and there is no place for them to hide. &quot; In fighting Friday , two Russian soldiers were killed while foiling two nighttime attempts by Chechen commandos to break_out of the encircled Grozny . That brought the official Russian casualty count to 52 dead and 132 wounded . However , fueling already widespread rumors that the Russian military is hiding the true number of its dead , officers of the elite 34th Regiment Airborne Division in Pskov told reporters that losses were greater than had been announced . They said 17 paratroopers were killed in fighting in Oktyabrskaya , a Grozny suburb . The Chechens claim about 1 # 500 Russian soldiers have been killed and 3 # 000 injured since the conflict began . The number of Chechen casualties is even less clear : By tradition the dead must be buried quickly , and the refugee flight into neighboring republics makes an accurate accounting impossible . * Bombing and shelling continued throughout the day as Russian forces attacked the Chechen &quot; bandit formations &quot; that continued to strike at the vastly superior Russian military machine . Chechen sources said the refinery was first bombed Thursday , then struck repeatedly Friday . Officials in neighboring Ingushetia said sooty smoke from the fire has now blanketed them . Dudayev appealed_to the United States , Europe and oil-producing Arab countries for help fighting the fire , Interfax reported . The message , signed by Dudayev , said oil and gas pipelines have been seriously damaged but the continuing hostilities have made_it impossible to tackle the flames . One analyst suggested that , despite Russian statements that Chechnya has no strategic importance , Moscow is in fact concerned that a rebel Chechnya would marginalize its piece of what Azerbaijanis call &quot; the deal of the century , &quot; a huge multinational agreement signed earlier this year to develop the Caspian Sea ' s vast oil reserves . If the oil is piped out through Iran or Turkey instead of Chechnya , Russia will lose its economic leverage over Azerbaijan , an oil-rich republic that has been building uncomfortably close ties with its Muslim neighbors , wrote Yuri A . Afanasyev , director of the Russian Humanitarian University . In other developments Friday : * The Helsinki-based Human_Rights Watch sent Yeltsin a letter denouncing the bombing of a Grozny orphanage as &quot; part of a demonstrated pattern of Russian forces ' flagrant violation of their obligations under the Geneva_Conventions , &quot; which prohibit indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets . * The prominent Izvestia newspaper named Yeltsin ' s estranged human_rights commissioner , Sergei A . Kovalev , who has remained in Grozny to describe conditions there , its Man of the Year . Kovalev , a close friend of Nobel Peace Prize-winning physicist Andrei D . Sakharov , spent 10 years in Soviet gulags and exile for his human_rights activities . Last year , he took_to the hustings to defend Yeltsin during the election campaign . Now he has become Russia ' s leading anti-war activist . * There was a fresh batch of bad economic news that raised questions about how Moscow could sustain the war without sending inflation_rates into orbit . Finance_Minister Vladimir Panskov estimated that the Chechnya war will cost 1 trillion rubles , or $ 282 million , by year ' s end . The bank savings deposits of the Russian people total 11 trillion rubles . And the State Statistics Committee announced Friday that inflation in December had jumped to 16.4 % from 14.1 % in November , the worst rate this year .</TEXT>
