   <HEADLINE> RUBLE ' S FALL FUELS A RUN ON BANKS ; RUSSIA : CITIZENS SCRAMBLE FOR DOLLARS AS DOUBT OVER REFORMS COLLAPSES CURRENCY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the biggest blow to the ruble since it stabilized last year , Russians in search of dollars mobbed banks and exchange houses for a third straight day Wednesday , bringing urgency to a crisis over leadership of the country ' s economic reforms . The ruble , relatively steady since July , plunged to a low of 1 # 607 to the dollar on the Moscow Inter-Bank Currency Exchange . It had closed at 1 # 354 per dollar last Friday but dropped to 1 # 402 Monday after the government ' s leading reformer , Economics Minister Yegor T . Gaidar , resigned . Since then , it has slid another 100 points per day as President Boris N . Yeltsin and his prime_minister struggle to form a new Cabinet and as Muscovites scramble through snowstorms to dump the ruble , fearing the demise of anti-inflation policies that had sustained its value . &quot; I ' m afraid my savings will evaporate tomorrow , &quot; said Ludmila S . Pashkova , 67 , a retired schoolteacher who has never owned a dollar_bill , as she lined_up at Moscow ' s Inkombank . Shivering in a worn cloth coat and no gloves , she waited more_than an hour to buy $ 50 . &quot; We ' re feeling panic here , an enormous influx of people -- businessmen , babushkas , students , everybody , &quot; said an exchange house cashier on Neglinka Street after selling all $ 40 # 000 on_hand and closing early . The ruble ' s stability has been an important cornerstone of Russia ' s agreements with the International Monetary Fund and other leading creditors , and its collapse could threaten the delivery of billions of dollars in promised assistance . Seeking to restore calm , Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin announced a partial restructuring of the Cabinet on Wednesday night , without settling the most important dispute : Who will control Russia ' s finances ? Economists said they expected the ruble to keep falling until that question is resolved and the rest of the Cabinet named -- a process that Yeltsin ' s office said could take several more days . The Interfax news service reported that Russia ' s Central_Bank had abandoned its efforts to prop_up the ruble after pumping more_than $ 1 billion into the banking system -- nearly one-fourth of its hard currency reserves . Two years after the collapse of communism , Russia developed a true currency market only last summer , when Finance_Minister Boris G . Fyodorov achieved a stable exchange_rate of 1 # 000 to 1 # 200 rubles to one dollar , in part by limiting subsidies to money-losing enterprises . The credit squeeze has thrown many people out_of_work and delayed paychecks for others , adding_to the hardships and uncertainties of Russia ' s transition to a free market . A backlash came last month when voters gave surprisingly strong support to Communists , nationalists and other advocates of a return to a planned economy . Gaidar , a 37-year-old economist and the leading symbol of reform , resigned Sunday after failing to win Yeltsin ' s backing to continue his radical assault on subsidies . And the political crisis deepened as Fyodorov , Gaidar ' s even younger ally , fought to keep his influence . He refused to stay in the Cabinet unless two of his foes -- Central_Bank President Viktor V . Gerashchenko and Alexander K . Zaveryukha , who oversees agriculture policy -- were subordinated to him or fired . Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin met for more_than six hours Tuesday and failed to resolve the crisis , adding_to a sense of political paralysis . It was anticipation of Fyodorov ' s ouster and a subsequent burst of inflation that sent Russians fleeing from the ruble this week . &quot; I don ' t believe the old apparatchiks like Chernomyrdin can fix the situation , &quot; said Sergei Tishkin , a 23-year-old businessman who used_up a tank of gasoline Wednesday shopping for the best exchange_rate . &quot; He ' s part of the old_guard that ruled this country for 70 years and led it to catastrophe . Now they ' re telling us they know how to achieve ' stabilization. ' Ha ! We ' re no idiots. &quot; Anders Aslund , a Swedish economist who advises the government , said the ruble ' s collapse has put Fyodorov in a strong position to keep bargaining for control of financial policy . &quot; For the first time , the market is playing a role in a Russian political crisis , &quot; Aslund said . &quot; Chernomyrdin simply cannot accept a devaluation like this every day . He has to find a credible finance_minister , or he looks quite weak . Right now , there ' s nobody but Fyodorov. &quot; In an interview with Interfax late Wednesday , Fyodorov said the devaluation was a direct result of politics and could be reversed . The embattled minister added that he was willing to bet 100 # 000 rubles that if he were to resign , the ruble would crash to 2 # 000 per dollar within a week -- a wager worth $ 62 now but $ 50 or less if he wins .
