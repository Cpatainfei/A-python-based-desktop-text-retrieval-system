   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : WESTMINSTER ; MOBILE_HOME PLAN GOING TO CITY_COUNCIL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After nearly a year of delay , a proposed ordinance designed to regulate the conversion of mobile_home parks to other uses finally will go before the City_Council today . The proposal has the support of mobile_home park residents , but mobile_home park owners have described it as unfair and have indicated they may challenge it in court if adopted by the council . &quot; It borders_on taking property without just compensation , &quot; said Norm McAdoo , part owner of Villa Magnolia and Kensington Garden mobile_home parks . &quot; It may_not stand a legal test. &quot; But residents of the city ' s 18 mobile_home parks said the ordinance would provide them with better protection if the park closed . The ordinance , for example , would require the owner to find space in a &quot; comparable park &quot; within 35 miles . In addition , the park owner would have to pay_for all relocation costs , including a daily allowance of $ 145 per adult and $ 40 per child for each day a family must stay in a hotel . If the mobile_home can ' t be relocated , the park owner is required to buy the mobile unit , including accessories , at a negotiated price . Vicky Talley , who works for an association of county mobile_home park owners , said under the ordinance park owners may have to pay_up to $ 30 # 000 for every mobile_home that would be relocated . The average relocation cost is about $ 5 # 000 under state law , she said . But Ethel Hirsch , one of the leaders of a group of mobile_home park residents , said that without assistance many of the residents would end_up homeless . She said that elderly people , who make_up a majority of the 5 # 000 residents of the city ' s 18 mobile_home parks , are particularly vulnerable . The Planning_Commission voted early this month to recommend the adoption of the ordinance.BERT ELJERA</TEXT>
