   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL , PLO CLOSER TO RESUMING TALKS ; MIDEAST : PERES SAYS TROOPS COULD BE OUT OF OCCUPIED LANDS SIX WEEKS AFTER SIDES RETURN TO BARGAINING TABLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israel and the PLO moved closer to resuming autonomy talks Saturday , and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Israeli troops could be out of the occupied Gaza Strip and Jericho within six weeks of a return to the negotiating table . A senior Israeli delegation , reportedly including chief autonomy negotiator Gen . Amnon Shahak , was to leave Sunday for meetings with Palestine Liberation Organization leaders in Tunis , Tunisia . The two sides are to discuss ways to improve Palestinian security in the occupied territories and the resumption of peace talks . One Israeli proposal is to deploy a Palestinian police_force in Hebron , site of the Feb . 25 massacre that led to the suspension of talks . If the meetings go well , Peres and PLO chief Yasser Arafat will meet Thursday in Paris , and negotiations could resume by March 28 , Israel TV said . Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin said he called Arafat early Saturday , immediately after the U.N. Security_Council condemned the massacre . The resolution had been one of the PLO ' s conditions for returning to negotiations . Rabin said he did not offer Arafat concrete proposals but made a general pledge to &quot; give protection to the Palestinians against terrible murderers. &quot; The PLO suspended talks after a Jewish settler gunned_down about 30 worshipers in a Hebron mosque last month . The PLO has demanded that Israel remove Jewish settlers from Hebron and deploy an international force in the occupied lands before negotiations resume . A PLO Executive Committee_member in Tunis said the leadership would not make any decision on resuming talks until the Israeli delegation arrives . Peres said Israel was proposing that a special Palestinian police_force be deployed in Hebron . Peres also hinted that Israel might decide unilaterally , though not immediately , to dismantle some settlements . Such a decision would be made &quot; based on Israeli logic and security needs , &quot; not under the pressure of negotiations with the PLO , he said . Once the Israel-PLO talks resume , there could be quick results , he said .</TEXT>
