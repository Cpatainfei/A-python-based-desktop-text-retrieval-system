   <TEXT> When Harvard professors Charles Nesson and Peter Murray were asked to overhaul &quot; Introduction to Lawyering &quot; for incoming students , their first decision was to put the 540 newcomers on-line , so they could punch up Supreme Court opinions and communicate by E-mail . The class thus got its first subtitle : &quot; Cyberlaw : A Course of Skills in Mind and Practice. &quot; But that still left the professors with case material that had been used by Harvard ' s first-year , or &quot; 1L , &quot; law_students for ages to learn such basics as how to write a legal_brief : A woman stumbles in front of a drunk driver -- can her heirs sue the bar that tanked him up ? That sort of thing . The canned cases had Nesson shaking his head . &quot; All I can think_of , &quot; he confided to Murray , &quot; is O.J. &quot; Bingo . Harvard ' s introductory class got a second subtitle : &quot; The Law and O.J. Simpson. &quot; From the start of the fall semester , the 1Ls have been taught the fundamentals through the legal machinations taking_place 3 # 000 miles away in Los Angeles Superior_Court . They were given a reading list that included &quot; Juice : The O.J. Simpson Tragedy &quot; by the Globe supermarket tabloid . And they are tapped into &quot; O.J. Info-bases &quot; as well as Supreme Court rulings . It was hardly what the lawyers-to-be expected in the ivy-covered halls of Harvard . But as computer bulletin_boards put them in touch with students elsewhere , they found that their professors were not the only ones who had decided that a case often derided for its sensationalism might be a godsend for the serious study of law . Indeed , it has become an instant ingredient in the curriculum from Yale to UCLA . The trial is being offered_up as Exhibit A to spur discussions of relevance , hearsay , weight of evidence , search-and-seizure , expert testimony , impeachment of witnesses , media access . . . the list goes_on . As Robert L . Shapiro and Marcia Clark quizzed prospective jurors on the ninth floor of the Los Angeles Criminal_Courts Building , students at the University of San Francisco were conducting their own voir dire in a moot_court . Some took the roles of defense_lawyers and prosecutors while others were potential jurors being probed on their attitudes toward DNA evidence . Nowhere has the case played such a central role , however , as at Harvard , alma_mater of four of the nine Supreme Court justices . Last month the trial became more_than an academic exercise here when Judge Lance A . Ito got_word of the 1L course and had a clerk call Nesson . The next day , Oct . 12 , the professor rushed_out a notice reporting that Ito &quot; would like to receive copies of our best student memoranda on the questions the judge now faces in determining whether to ban cameras from the courtroom. &quot; With Ito having already scheduled a hearing on the issue for today , 150 students were mobilized , in 59 small groups , to write memos . &quot; When we started , &quot; says Murray , &quot; no one would have guessed that we would not only study the case , but become part of the case. &quot; * A videotape plays_on a screen in front of the Austin North lecture hall as 135 students filter into the amphitheater that has hosted Harvard law classes for a century . The video shows law_school alumni at a reunion seminar . &quot; What were they talking_about ? &quot; Murray asks . &quot; O.J. ! &quot; The old graduates ' interest is reassuring to Nesson and Murray . They had felt some trepidation about using a sexy , media-darling case of the moment in a school known for its stern traditionalism -- exemplified by the mythical Prof . Kingsfield of &quot; The Paper Chase. &quot; Nesson , 55 , has been a professor here for nearly three decades , though hardly in the Kingsfield mold -- he eschews coats and ties for turtlenecks and uses the computer sign-on &quot; Eon. &quot; He tells the students that one 79-year-old alumnus , Harold Brown , had written a memo to provoke debate at his 55th reunion -- and picked the very &quot; Ito issue &quot; they were tackling . Brown reviewed sensational trials in the past 100 years ( Scopes and Lizzie Borden , among others ) and concluded that the Simpson case highlighted a disturbing new development , &quot; the entertainment defense , &quot; marked by &quot; dramatic manipulation of the public. &quot; But today ' s class hardly centers_on such a broad question . Facing the students is the nitty-gritty of law : the writing of a brief . A &quot; Power_Points &quot; slide pops on the screen , and Murray tells how even the smallest feature of a brief -- section headings , say -- must advance the &quot; core theory. &quot; So what pops on the screen next ? An actual heading from the district_attorney ' s brief defending the search of Simpson ' s home after the slayings of his ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ronald Goldman . The heading begins , &quot; Exigent Circumstances Justified the Warrantless Search Onto the Premises at 360 Rockingham . . . . &quot; The professors become legal sharpshooters . Murray praises how the language &quot; depersonalized &quot; Simpson ' s home into a &quot; premises. &quot; But , as he sees it , the prosecutors otherwise blew a chance to underscore the need to immediately get_into the estate because of &quot; concern over the safety of the occupants. &quot; And the defense ? Talk_of wasted opportunities ! The same section of its brief was headed : &quot; Exigent Circumstances. &quot; that ' s it . Two words . &quot; An argument without an argument ! &quot; Murray laments -- when the defense could have pointed_out how there was &quot; no emergency &quot; compelling police to leap into Simpson ' s home ( not an anonymous premises ) and how it was &quot; a whole_lot of detectives going_in to get the goods on somebody. &quot; Soon the class is examining other headings in the briefs and asking , &quot; How can we try to rewrite it ? &quot; The bottom_line is a process more brutal than any media grilling . Virtually every word written by the legal teams in L.A. , in the heat of battle , is going_to be torn_apart and second-guessed by two Harvard professors and 540 students -- many of whom next semester will themselves face the critical eye of one of Simpson ' s attorneys , criminal_law professor Alan Dershowitz . * For decades , American law_schools have used a top-down approach , one that focuses_on the cases that generated key Supreme Court rulings over the years . But the era of Court TV has provided raw_material hard to ignore . What better way is there to illustrate how two sides in a case portray the same facts differently than showing the Rodney G . King videotape ? To the prosecution , it ' s clear brutality . To the defense , &quot; textbook &quot; police work . USC professor Charles Whitebread , who is using the Simpson case in a criminal procedure class , sees trade-offs in de-emphasizing the &quot; canned cases in the textbook. &quot; Textbook cases &quot; are useful for clearing away facts &quot; and focusing_on legal_principles , he says . Live cases , though , remind students how &quot; factual issues may often be muddy in a real case &quot; -- and how results turn_on quirks of the facts as often as on abstract principles . &quot; It makes the class more relevant , &quot; says USC law_student Tara Kelly . &quot; It ' s not like something that happened 100 years ago. &quot; Yale professor Kate Stith starts her criminal_law course by writing well-known defendants ' names on a blackboard . Last year , they included Lorena Bobbitt , the Menendez brothers and Bernard Goetz . Stith reminds her students that none were convicted of the worst charges they faced -- and asks why . Though the students inevitably &quot; have some notions that are too facile , &quot; Stith says , &quot; the truth is ( they ) already know a lot about criminal_law when they walk in the classroom . Discussing these cases . . . makes them feel they belong there from the first day. &quot; Her students will find a new name on the blackboard this year . UCLA ' s Peter Arenella has used Simpson proceedings to illustrate &quot; the importance of strategic decisions by a lawyer , &quot; such_as whether to contest the search of Simpson ' s home at the preliminary hearing or wait to do_it in Superior_Court , when the defense has more evidence to challenge police_actions . Arenella , who has served as a TV legal analyst on the Simpson trial , is nevertheless wary of overusing a case that , because of the resources , &quot; does not provide an accurate window into how our criminal justice system usually operates . Students need to be reminded that , in the typical criminal prosecution , there is far less litigation in the pretrial process and ( it ) does not end with a trial -- but with a plea bargain in 90 % of the cases. &quot; Of course , the fact that Simpson lawyers can afford battles on every constitutional and evidentiary issue is exactly what generates fodder for the classroom . At the University of San Francisco , Robert E . Talbot has used the case in an orientation program for minority students -- to introduce concepts such_as mens rea , mental_state -- and in the moot_court for his &quot; Science and Litigation &quot; seminar . &quot; Let ' s face it , murder is interesting , &quot; Talbot says . &quot; They don ' t have a TV_show called , ' Civil Procedure , She Wrote. ' &quot; But most legal issues have dissenters , and Loyola Law_School ' s Sam Pillsbury remains skeptical of the pedagogical value of the Simpson case ; he ' s not convinced it has captured students ' imagination . Why not ? Pillsbury says his students generally look_forward to careers in civil_law , meaning &quot; it ' s not the kind of law most of them see themselves practicing . Most law_students , especially with the loans they have now , are expecting to go_out and make more money than you do as a criminal lawyer. &quot; * Harvard student_teacher Greg Duhl , a 3L , is planning a career in &quot; exciting tax law , &quot; but that hasn ' t kept him from getting swept_up in O.J. mania . When he was a 1L , his class was given the drunk driving material based on a settled New York case . He envies the current 1Ls who have material so fresh &quot; it ' s like they ' re the lawyers in the case. &quot; On this afternoon , Duhl , in blue_jeans and a baseball_cap , leads a workshop for a dozen 1Ls . He begins with a rumor -- that the professors are &quot; sending all 59 Ito memos to Ito. &quot; A week earlier , the 1Ls had been asked to research issues such_as : What are the limits of a judge ' s power to ban TV coverage in court ? Can he control media activity outside court ? Is there a constitutional &quot; right to know &quot; that affects his rulings ? Now , one 1L seems nervous that all_the memos , including hers , may be read by Ito . &quot; Did someone , like , look over them ? &quot; she asks . Duhl nods . &quot; Some were really good , &quot; he says . &quot; And some . . . . &quot; Well , one memo had a footnote that went a page and a half , listing every case affirming judges ' discretion to ban cameras . Another had a novel idea , Duhl says : that rather than have TV crews tape the trial , Ito &quot; puts his own camera in the court , then he sells the tape. &quot; The students laugh , until he cuts them off with , &quot; Let ' s start ! &quot; The seminar is designed to help the 1Ls while they write briefs on issues such_as the admissibility of 911 tapes that apparently capture Simpson yelling at his ex-wife . The 1Ls are told they must learn to present facts &quot; from a particular point of view. &quot; To show that some Harvard traditions refuse to die , they try it first not with O.J. material , but &quot; mythological cases. &quot; They will argue the facts of Goldilocks vs . The Three Bears . The bears are suing for trespass . The future legal leaders break_into groups , then begin the argument : &quot; We the bears came_home to find that our house had been broken into , that our porridge had been eaten , our beds had been slept_in , our prized baby chair had been broken , &quot; says Nalini Pande of McLean , Va. , speaking_for the plaintiffs . She also claims that Mama Bear had suffered emotional distress . But Rachel Blum of Philadelphia dismisses the incident as &quot; simple error &quot; by Goldilocks , a poor housekeeper who accidentally wandered into the wrong home and only fell_asleep in the bears ' bed because &quot; she has narcolepsy. &quot; &quot; I assume you have medical proof ? &quot; the other side calls_out . &quot; Oh sure . If you have proof of trauma. &quot; Both sides laugh and go_back into groups -- to hash out competing portrayals of the 911 tape . * A week later , the 1Ls are back in the lecture hall . In the rear are boxes of reprints of the memos just sent to Ito . And the rumor was wrong -- the professors shipped only a dozen to the judge . They also included -- in the prized top spot -- the memo by the 79-year-old alumnus . The memo with the big footnote didn ' t make the cut . Nor the one urging Ito to film the trial himself . Nesson doesn ' t make_it easier for those whose memos were not sent . He explains , &quot; This is a kind of grade , a first event , where people were distinguished . . . . I selected strictly because of . . . which ideas stayed with me. &quot; Soon afterward , the screen is alive_with a &quot; Nightline &quot; debate . It features Leslie Abramson , the in-your-face Menendez lawyer , and the Harvard faculty ' s star , Laurence Tribe . Abramson is defending Ito ' s decision -- later eased a bit -- to bar reporters from jury selection because of a &quot; runaway circus-performing media. &quot; But Tribe lambastes the judge , suggesting that he went_against a 1984 ruling in another California case , in which &quot; the Supreme Court made absolutely clear , 9-0 , that judges can ' t just intuit these things. &quot; The class is off and running . Because Tribe has not named the case he used to &quot; deck Judge Ito , &quot; Nesson tells the students , &quot; We ' ve got_to find Larry ' s case. &quot; A legal computer is activated in the lecture hall , and a search launched -- projected on the screen . Key_words are punched_in : 1984 . California . Jury . Media . &quot; This looks_like the one ! &quot; someone says as a Supreme Court opinion pops_up , Press Enterprise vs . Riverside County , stemming from a murder trial in which a judge not only barred the media from court during jury selection , but refused to release a transcript of most of the proceedings . To the surprise of the class , Nesson declares the facts &quot; very different &quot; than those in Los Angeles , because Ito was not calling_for such a complete blackout . In other words , Nesson is siding with Abramson over his distinguished Harvard colleague ! So go the twists in &quot; Cyberlaw meets O.J. Simpson , &quot; a course where no one asks any longer how the classroom relates to the real_world . By now , they have been intertwined beyond distinction . If that wasn ' t clear before , it certainly was when word of the Harvard course spread and TV crews began knocking_on the classroom door . The professors said the students should vote on it , and so they did , those fledgling Judge Itos -- and banned the cameras . * KEY HEARING TODAY : Judge Lance A . Ito hears arguments on possible TV ban . B1</TEXT>
