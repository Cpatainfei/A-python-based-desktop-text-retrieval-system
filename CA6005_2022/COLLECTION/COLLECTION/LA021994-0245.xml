   <HEADLINE> RELIGION / JOHN DART ; MILITARY BROADCASTS CHANGE TUNE ; AIRWAVES : TO KEEP PACE WITH MODERN AUDIENCES , ARMED FORCES RADIO AND TELEVISION RELIGIOUS PROGRAMS ARE LIVELIER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Armed Forces Radio and Television broadcasts religious programs for the 1.3 million servicemen and women overseas , but for many years the military airwaves typically carried worship services , Bible studies and music by the_likes_of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir . Little wonder then that surveys of the predominantly young military_personnel ranked religious shows at the bottom , almost as expendable in their minds as big_band and classical_music . Today , however , Christian rock_music -- including the metal variety -- black gospel singing , and Top 10 contemporary Christian music dominate the five weekly hours of religious radio offered to military stations . And the religious television package is livelier too , with magazine-format shows and religious video shows done_in the MTV style . The transformation was largely the effort of two chaplains who have acted_as religious program coordinators at a little-known military facility in the San Fernando Valley -- the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service Broadcast Center in Sun Valley . &quot; For the first time , both radio and television religious programming . . . will be compatible with our audience ' s lifestyles and tastes , &quot; Army Maj . David Smith , the current religious program coordinator , wrote to fellow chaplains after the revamped schedules were introduced last April . &quot; The feedback was extremely positive from programmers at a meeting here last December , because 70 % of our audience is between the ages of 18 and 28 , &quot; Smith said in an interview . Gerald Fry , a civilian who directs programming and news at the Sun Valley center , confirmed that the changes have had a good response . &quot; If it were my choice , I ' d put the Mormon Tabernacle Choir on every week , &quot; said Fry , who has been in broadcasting since 1952 . &quot; But the more contemporary the program , the more popular they are compared to the old-style religion programs. &quot; Fry credited Smith ' s predecessor , Air_Force Maj . Richard Davenport , with launching the innovations . One well-received change , Fry said , was the introduction of religious-themed children ' s television_programs for military families with small children . The Armed Forces Radio and Television Network , received by U . S . military bases in 128 countries and on ships at_sea , selects news , sports , sitcoms , movies , specials and a variety of programming from the broadcast and cable networks . Extra news coverage of disasters such_as the Northridge earthquake are picked_up from the major broadcast networks and CNN and transmitted by satellite . With a limited budget , which is diminishing with military cutbacks , the broadcast center relies_on the patriotism of networks and producers to donate their products . Some religious broadcasters go even further to accommodate Armed Forces Network needs . For instance , Pat Robertson ' s &quot; 700 Club &quot; is pared_down to a half-hour by his Family Channel editors and the Rev . Robert Schuller ' s &quot; Hour of Power , &quot; the top-rated syndicated religious program in this country , is edited down to 30 minutes by technicians at the Crystal Cathedral , Smith said . &quot; White_Heat , &quot; the Christian metal program produced by broadcaster Ken Roberts of Torrance , is done free_of charge solely for the military network . So is &quot; Love on a Rock &quot; ( top hits ) and &quot; Amen Corner &quot; ( black gospel ) . &quot; You can ' t hear these programs anywhere else , &quot; said Smith , 38 , a United Methodist minister who is halfway through his three-year assignment at the broadcast center . &quot; As a chaplain , I don ' t want to play the ratings game , but if the servicemen and women are not listening or watching , then we are not reaching them , &quot; he said . &quot; The programmers overseas usually ran worship services and Bible study programs on Sunday morning -- when the people who might listen or watch were in chapel . We want to reach more_than them. &quot; Smith said that he changed the radio schedule to run some music programs for 52 consecutive weeks -- instead of changing them every 13 weeks as before -- in_order to build_up a following . Some of the biggest concerns , however , are to balance programs for different religious faiths and ethnic_groups and to assure that the spiritual exhortations do not include pleas for money . On radio , &quot; East of Eden , &quot; a Jewish program of music and talk , is offered at eight holiday times during the year . &quot; Passages , &quot; an award-winning program with interviews of people whose faith helped them overcome traumatic experiences , is produced by the Presbyterian Media Mission in Pittsburgh . On television , &quot; The Jesuit Journal &quot; and &quot; Catch the Spirit &quot; offer interviews on current religious issues , from the Catholic and Methodist perspectives , respectively . When &quot; Hour of Power &quot; is not showing , the military network offers the upbeat &quot; Outreach of Love &quot; Sunday service from an African Methodist Episcopal church in Baltimore led by Pastor Frank Reid , formerly of Los Angeles . Network documentaries or specials on religious themes -- such_as how churches and synagogues responded to Hurricane Andrew -- are picked_up by the network . Final approval of the program selections rests with a three-chaplain committee called the Audiovisual Advisory Group , but it is the religious program coordinator who searches program listings and monitors network feeds for new material . Smith picked_up two television productions that focused_on last September ' s Parliament of World Religions in Chicago -- a documentary from CBS and a series of interviews produced by the Faith &amp; Values Cable Network featuring Hindu , Buddhist , Muslim , Bahai and other religious_leaders . &quot; This will really be beneficial because we have a very diverse audience , &quot; Smith said . That very diversity means that the chaplain-coordinators have to review each program to make_sure that no religious group is criticized or demeaned . The military programmers do not censor or edit programs , so the entire show has to be free_of abusive references_to meet government guidelines on fairness . &quot; We got one complaint when I first came here that a program was unfair to a faith group , and when I looked_at it , I had to agree , &quot; Smith said . &quot; It turned_out that was a program that went_through the approval process in the three months between Maj . Davenport ' s assignment here and when I started. &quot;</TEXT>
