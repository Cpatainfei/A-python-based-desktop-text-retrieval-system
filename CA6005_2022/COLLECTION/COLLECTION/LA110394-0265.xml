   <HEADLINE> INFOTEC LANDS HIGH-TECH RUSSIAN DEAL ; PROJECT : THE SANTA ANA FIRM WILL HELP SET UP A COMPUTERIZED PROPERTY INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM LINKING ALL REPUBLICS AND REGIONS IN THE FEDERATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Waxing philosophical about a property information_system might seem unlikely , but Daniel Abraham maintains that the future of the Russian Federation might depend_on having one . Abraham is vice_president of Infotec Development Inc. , the Santa Ana high-tech computer_systems developer that has just won a contract to help the Russian government set_up a private land management system , along with the record-keeping required to make_it work . Infotec heads a team of U.S. companies conducting a $ 610 # 000 feasibility study for the Russian Federation . If the preliminary results are promising , the federation -- which encompasses nine time_zones , 150 million people and an eighth of the world ' s land -- would spend almost $ 2 billion to develop a comprehensive record-keeping system incorporating computers for a region where the terms &quot; private &quot; and &quot; property &quot; haven ' t been linked for more_than seven decades . For Infotec , which has about 500 employees and $ 100 million a year in sales , landing the lead role in developing the Russian Land Cadastre Program would nearly double its revenue and create several hundred jobs in the United States and Russia . &quot; It would redefine what this company is , &quot; Abraham said . It also would help the Russian Federation define what it will become . The Russian officials heading the project &quot; firmly believe it is essential for overall reform , &quot; Abraham said . &quot; If the people can have private home and property ownership , then they have a reason to make the country work &quot; without reverting to communism , he said . Setting_up the system would be a huge undertaking . The program is a complicated linking of the financial , legal and physical aspects of property ownership , and never before has there been an attempt to create a unified system for an area as large as the Russian Federation . ( The 89 republics and regions that make_up the federation cover nearly 6.6 million square_miles -- more_than 8 # 000 times the size of Orange County and just under twice the size of the United States. ) The Russians want a system that would enable a citizen in a central registry in Moscow , for example , to pull_up records for a single-family home 4 # 000 miles away on the Kamchatka peninsula . The impetus for the program , Abraham said , came from the Russian Federation . &quot; They were looking_for ways to apply some of their former military technology to ( federation President Boris N. ) Yeltsin ' s land_reforms &quot; and asked a U.S. businessman with ties to Eastern and Central Europe for advice , he said . The businessman was Larry Nelson , a principal of Dallas-based Texas International Trade . &quot; He started looking in the U.S. for companies that could do this type of thing , &quot; Abraham said , &quot; and through contacts in Washington he heard of us. &quot; Infotec , founded in Santa Ana in 1979 by computer_systems specialists Fernando Niebla and Joseph Soulia , specializes in design and installation of sophisticated information management networks . The company also does data collection and management work for private and government_agencies , including the FBI , U.S. Bureau of Land Management , the Air_Force and the White_House . Texas International and Infotec joined forces in 1992 to market their services to the Russians and earlier this year won the feasibility study contract , Abraham said . Infotec heads the team , which also includes Keith Cos. , a Costa Mesa engineering and land mapping firm ; Geonex , a Florida mapping company , and Jenkins &amp; Gilchrist , a Dallas law_firm that is advising the Russians on real estate-related laws that would have to be enacted to create a basis for the land record system . Texas International , Abraham said , is responsible_for securing financing for the program . The first phase is being funded by the U.S. Trade and Development Agency , which sees the feasibility study as a foot in the door for other U.S. businesses . The World_Bank , Abraham said , has committed $ 80 million for an initial phase of the program if the federation decides to move ahead . As part of the feasibility study , the Infotec team is staging a monthlong exhibit in Moscow next month . More_than 40 U.S. companies involved in computer_hardware and software development , computer-assisted drafting and mapping , surveying and other related fields will be able to display their products and services , Abraham said . Several European companies also have said they will attend in the hope of landing part of the project . The Russian Federation has also issued an open invitation for companies to build prototypes for individual &quot; counties &quot; within the 89 republics and regions . &quot; The Canadians are spending about $ 3 million to do one , &quot; Abraham said . &quot; And there are others being done_by companies backed by Sweden , Denmark , Germany and Australia . But there are no U.S. pilot_projects , and that makes_it difficult for us as the American leaders of the feasibility study to push for American technology . The other governments are outspending the U.S._government &quot; to promote their own corporations . To help counter that , Infotec is hosting a delegation of Russian land program officials on an eight-day trip to Southern California in mid-November . In addition to visiting Infotec , the delegates will review land record systems in Los Angeles and Orange counties . &quot; They also want to see how all stages of the program work , so they will see how we sell land and do escrows and make mortgages and issue title insurance and development plans -- all things that are new_to them , &quot; said Boris Gurevich , Infotec ' s marketing director for the Russian program . &quot; We believe that seeing U.S. equipment and systems in action will help show them the advantages of using U.S. companies , &quot; Gurevich said .</TEXT>
