   <HEADLINE> JAZZ REVIEWS ; HERSCH ' S ARTISTRY SHINES THROUGH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fred Hersch owns that rare artistic commodity : a unique creative style . The pianist ' s personal jazz stance was displayed on Friday at the Jazz Bakery , where he performed with bassist Drew Gress and drummer Tom Rainey.His distinctive touch made his notes sound like gentle bells -- or like walls shaking from a gust of wind . &quot; All the Things You Are &quot; began with an unaccompanied piano intro that mimicked a baroque classical piece ; the usually somber ballad &quot; You Don ' t Know What Love Is &quot; was taken at a snappy medium up-tempo , and &quot; As Long as There ' s Music &quot; came outfitted with a loping , rumba-ish beat . Hersch , long called a man who works in the substantial afterglow of the great Bill Evans , is anything but a clone . His solos were uncommon : a pleasing amalgam of brief fragments that seemed bitten_off , sweeping melodies that curved majestically and choppy , chattering block chords . The New York-based trio ' s take_on group interplay was also personal , as Gress and Rainey alternated between accompanying Hersch and offering ideas that made the unit seem to be involved in a serious but fun give-and-take discussion . Lately receiving a lot of attention from his recent disclosure that he is both gay and HIV-positive ( albeit AIDS asymptomatic ) , now is the time for Hersch to get some recognition for his artistry .
