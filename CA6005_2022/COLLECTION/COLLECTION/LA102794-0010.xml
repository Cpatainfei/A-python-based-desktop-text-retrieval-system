   <HEADLINE> FLOWER BLOOMS IN MIDEAST DESERT ; ISRAEL AND JORDAN SIGN PEACE_TREATY ENDING ALMOST FIVE DECADES OF HOSTILITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Amid prayers , with homage to the dead of past wars and with eloquent expressions of hope for the future , Israel and Jordan have signed a peace_treaty ending almost five decades of hostility . It was a moving ceremony in the stark southern desert landscape the two countries share , a mood heightened by the personal_memories of the leaders whose vision and determination made the accomplishment possible . Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and King Hussein both remember the bitter beginning of the conflict they have now finally concluded . Rabin was a soldier in Israel ' s 1948 war of independence , Hussein the grandson of the king who led Jordan into that war and who just three years later would be murdered by a political extremist , an act that would bring the young prince to the throne . Both have seen more_than enough of war and suffering . Both now hope to see the peace they have agreed upon take firm hold . Agreements pointing toward broad bilateral cooperation seek to anchor the new treaty in common national interests . But opponents of peace remain unmollified . Muslim fundamentalists in Jordan , like their counterparts in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon , scorn any peace with Israel . A majority of Jordan ' s 4 million people -- between 60 % and 80 % -- are of Palestinian origin . Many have voiced reservations about the peace agreement . So it will take committed effort and time and above all a continued climate of political moderation to make this peace work . Syria , which President Clinton visits today , can play a major role either to promote or to try to undercut regional political moderation . King Hussein showed great courage when he chose to proceed independently of his radical neighbor . Will President Hafez Assad now decide that the time has come_to show the same vision in putting Syria firmly on_the_road to peace ?</TEXT>
