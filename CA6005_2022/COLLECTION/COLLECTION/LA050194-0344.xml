   <HEADLINE> QUESTIONS CLOUD LOAN DEFAULT IN STATE PROGRAM ; FINANCES : CAL-MORTGAGE LOST NEARLY $ 5 MILLION . OFFICIALS ALLEGE FRAUD , BUT KEY PLAYERS DENY WRONGDOING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When a new Beverly Hills company sought a loan guarantee from the state , its goal seemed laudable : to expand residential care services in poor neighborhoods of Los Angeles County . The company , though , did not meet the state ' s financial requirements , and one of its facilities had a history of serious health and safety violations . Still , the state ' s Cal-Mortgage program granted $ 17 million in loan guarantees to Community Adult Care Centers of America Inc. four years ago . None of that money has benefited the poor , and nothing has been built . The company defaulted_on nearly $ 5 million in loans and , the state alleges in a lawsuit , misappropriated more_than $ 1 million of that sum in a kickback scheme . A separate state investigation into activities at CACCOA ' s two facilities led to the indictments of two of the company ' s business associates on Medi-Cal fraud , forgery and tax_evasion charges . Key players in the loan deal have denied wrongdoing and blamed each other for the project ' s collapse . How did Cal-Mortgage , a respected financial_aid program for nonprofit health_care_providers , get drawn into this tangle -- the first losing transaction in its 25-year history ? A three-month Times examination found that the program was loosely run , leaving it vulnerable to manipulation by private business interests , despite obvious financial risks for the state . Also coloring the deal were procedural irregularities , some of which have spawned allegations of political influence-peddling and attempted bribery , as well as a lawsuit and an investigation by the state_attorney general ' s office . &quot; It was such a bad deal , &quot; said former Cal-Mortgage official Richard A . McManus . The CACCOA troubles emerge as Cal-Mortgage is struggling to recover from a $ 167-million loan default by Triad Healthcare Inc. of Encino . Cal-Mortgage has played a pivotal role in health_facility construction in California , enabling health_care companies to qualify for low-interest loans that they could not obtain without the backing of the state treasury . But the program has been temporarily shut_down by the Triad default last summer . A legislative inquiry into Triad is focusing_on possible conflicts_of_interest as well as departures from customary procedures that helped the company obtain a Cal-Mortgage guarantee . Similar procedural irregularities show_up in the CACCOA transaction , records show . Both deals were accelerated by Larry G . Meeks in his final months as director of Cal-Mortgage ' s parent agency , the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development . Meeks also approved them over the objections of staff analysts who considered them unsound investments , according to records and interviews . Meeks -- an appointee of former Gov . George Deukmejian who was replaced in the $ 97 # 428-a-year job in 1991 -- said in an interview that he gave special treatment to CACCOA because its chairman , Howard L . Winkler of Los Angeles , was a Deukmejian appointee in another arm of Meeks ' agency . &quot; Knowing this person was close to the governor ' s office because he was an appointee and so forth , I was always very attentive . . . to make_sure his complaints were responded to , &quot; Meeks said . Winkler tried to bribe Meeks with about $ 2 # 000 and a prostitute while the loan guarantee application was under review , state investigators alleged in an affidavit filed_in Los Angeles Superior_Court last year . No criminal charges have resulted because the attorney_general ' s office was unable to find corroborating evidence . Winkler declined to comment , but through his attorney , he denied the bribery allegations . The affidavit alleged that CACCOA obtained the loan guarantee because of those bribe offers and &quot; the influence of CACCOA ' s board chairman , Howard Winkler , who was_on the board of a governmental unit within that same ( state ) agency. &quot; Meeks also told The Times about the alleged bribery attempts , one of which occurred during a visit to Winkler ' s Los Angeles office . Meeks said the CACCOA chairman put an undetermined amount of folded bills in the breast_pocket of his suit . &quot; I was freaked_out , &quot; Meeks said . &quot; I took it out and flung it on his desk and said : ' Don ' t you ever do that again. ' &quot; He said Winkler apologized . On another trip to Los Angeles , Meeks said , he was staying in a hotel when Winkler telephoned to say he was sending over a &quot; high-class call_girl &quot; to keep him company . Meeks said he angrily told Winkler to &quot; call her off. &quot; The former state official said he reported the alleged bribery attempts to the agency ' s counsel and was not influenced by them . The agency ' s counsel , John Rosskopf , said in an interview that Meeks never told him about the prostitute but did say that Winkler had offered him $ 2 # 000 cash . Meeks said he approved the CACCOA application solely because he believed that the project would benefit the needy . &quot; I thought it was a good project , &quot; said Meeks , 50 , who is now retired on a medical disability . &quot; I was intrigued by the concept of it : adult day_care . The people behind it , I personally did not care_for them. &quot; Winkler ' s attorney , Harold Greenberg of Los Angeles , said his client did not try to bribe Meeks . Greenberg said Winkler did offer Meeks a gift of collector ' s coins -- valued at about $ 100 -- but that it occurred after CACCOA ' s application was approved . Greenberg said Meeks refused the coins , which Meeks confirmed . State investigators searched the homes of Meeks and Winkler a year ago and seized bank records and other documents . Deputy Atty . Gen . Mark Geiger said they failed to find corroborating evidence . Meeks ' successor , Dr. David Werdegar , said the transaction should have been killed immediately if a bribe was offered . &quot; It defies imagination , &quot; he said . &quot; If I were offered a bribe . . . everything would come_to a screeching halt. &quot; * CACCOA sought a Cal-Mortgage-insured loan in 1990 to finance improvements and additions to the former Walnut Convalescent Hospital , a skilled nursing_home in Long_Beach , and to Hope House , a board and care home for recovering substance_abusers , mentally_ill homeless people and ex-felons in Los Angeles ' Koreatown . The facilities were owned by Los Angeles businessmen Michael Rosenberg and James Salamon , who under CACCOA ' s proposal would run the facilities . At the time , Salamon was banned from managing Hope House or any other board and care home_in California . He agreed to the ban -- until 1996 -- after the state_Department of Social_Services moved to revoke his license . State inspectors found the facility filthy , vermin-infested and unsafe with &quot; numerous exposed electrical wires. &quot; They also found that residents were poorly supervised . Records show that two residents hung themselves in their bedrooms in the late 1980s and one of the deaths was not discovered for two days . &quot; This had been a problem facility for a long_time , &quot; said Lisa K . Hightower , senior staff attorney for the Department of Social_Services . Meeks said he was unaware of Hope House ' s citations . He said Cal-Mortgage did not routinely check with other state agencies for disciplinary actions against applicants . &quot; We never had this problem before , &quot; he said . There were other reasons to deny CACCOA ' s application , according to Cal-Mortgage staff and members of the program ' s advisory loan committee . The application was incomplete , and financial documentation was so inadequate that the loan committee twice refused to vote on the CACCOA proposal . After what officials said was an unprecedented third review , it was approved with stringent conditions . &quot; There were just too many unanswered questions , &quot; said Dale Flournoy , the staff analyst assigned to CACCOA . &quot; I ' d say : ' Show me the plans. ' . . . I never saw final approved architectural_plans with specifications. &quot; The seven-member committee voted to recommend approval , but attached 10 conditions to remedy the application ' s deficiencies . Four committee_members interviewed by The Times said they expected that CACCOA would be unable to meet the conditions and that the project would die . &quot; The conditions should have killed it , &quot; said McManus , the former loan committee chairman . But Meeks did not enforce the conditions , although he had endorsed them in writing . Records show that he signed final closing documents for the loan guarantee in December , even though six conditions were unmet and the company had not met a separate requirement to put_up 10 % of the project cost . Meeks said in an interview that he was unaware that the conditions had not been met because his staff had not informed him . Cal-Mortgage records , however , show that Flournoy , the project officer , wrote several memos to Meeks alerting him to CACCOA ' s noncompliance ; the last one was three days before the closing . &quot; I told ( Meeks ) what was wrong with it over and over , &quot; Flournoy said . &quot; It made no difference. &quot; Meeks said his approval was based solely on the merit of the project , although he acknowledged that CACCOA ' s application got special handling . Before the application was filed , Meeks met privately with Winkler to tell him what was required to obtain a state loan guarantee . He said he extended the help largely because of Winkler ' s claims of political pull and his ties to the agency as a member of its minority educational foundation . Meeks later scheduled a special meeting of the loan committee solely to hear CACCOA ' s application , records show . Meeks said he also made an unusual number of inquiries about the progress of CACCOA ' s application . The reason , he said , was that Winkler had complained that the application was being held_up because of anti-Semitism . &quot; The nature of the charges was intimidating , &quot; said Meeks , who is African American . &quot; Here I am black , and I am having these charges made . . . . and I am supposed to be very sensitive to this sort of discrimination. &quot; Winkler , through his attorney , denied making allegations of anti-Semitism . His attorney , Greenberg , said his client sometimes does drop names of political officeholders . Winkler ' s resume lists memberships in several Republican organizations , and records show he contributed more_than $ 5 # 000 to Republican candidates in 1990 . While CACCOA ' s application was wending its way through Cal-Mortgage ' s review process , Department of Social_Services investigators were assembling evidence of financial irregularities at Hope House that they turned_over to the attorney_general ' s office . Last August , Salamon and Rosenberg were indicted on 15 criminal charges , including Medi-Cal fraud , grand theft , lying to state licensing authorities , workers ' compensation insurance fraud , and failure to pay unemployment insurance taxes . They have pleaded not_guilty , according to the attorney_general ' s office . Rosenberg and Salamon declined through their attorneys to comment on the charges . None of the criminal charges deals directly with CACCOA or with the participation of Salamon and Rosenberg in CACCOA ' s Cal-Mortgage transaction . But Cal-Mortgage officials now assert in a civil suit against CACCOA , Winkler , Rosenberg , Salamon and others that CACCOA was a &quot; mere shell and sham &quot; created to defraud the state and obtain money for &quot; personal use. &quot; Although some site preparation was done , the state ' s lawsuit asserts that CACCOA officials did not improve the two facilities , nor did they construct the promised additions . Hope House in Koreatown has since gone_into receivership and has been shut_down because of fire-safety problems . The Long_Beach nursing_home is under new management . The suit alleges that more_than $ 1 million in loan proceeds paid to architects , consultants and contractors hired by CACCOA were kicked_back to Rosenberg , Salamon , Winkler and other officers of CACCOA . For example , Cal-Mortgage officials authorized a $ 336 # 400 payment for services rendered by a firm called Comprehensive Consulting Services . The suit alleges that the owner and CACCOA board_member Robert Armstrong kept $ 21 # 400 and then wrote checks to several other people , including one to Winkler for $ 238 # 000 , according to court documents . The remaining money was distributed to four religious organizations , including , the suit alleges , $ 50 # 000 to Congregation Mogen Abraham in Los Angeles , whose leader , Rabbi Abraham Low , was convicted last month in U.S. District Court of conspiracy to launder drug money . Low declined through his attorney to be interviewed . Armstrong and his attorney could not be reached for comment . Armstrong formally denied the allegations in court documents filed_in 1992 . He has since turned_over a memo that he wrote in 1990 , detailing the distribution of the money , according to the state ' s attorney , Jeffrey Belote . The memo , which The Times has obtained , also alleged that Winkler had directed him to write the checks . Salamon , Rosenberg and Winkler , through their attorneys , declined interview requests . But , in answers filed with the court , they denied the allegations of civil fraud and blamed each other for any misrepresentations or misappropriations of loan proceeds . Rosenberg said he relied_on the opinion of experts in consenting to the deal and denied that he knowingly submitted false invoices to Cal-Mortgage . He alleged that Winkler was &quot; the main power to arrange the loan &quot; because of a &quot; special relationship &quot; with Meeks . He also said he was unaware that Salamon had been barred by the state from managing residential-care facilities . Salamon acknowledged the state ' s claim that CACCOA was a &quot; sham , &quot; but alleged that Winkler , Rosenberg and several others created it . He also alleged that these associates took money from CACCOA ' s bank_accounts for their &quot; personal use. &quot; In court papers , Winkler said the project could have succeeded if the state had not halted it and seized the loan proceeds . Therefore , he said , the state is responsible_for the losses . State officials declared CACCOA in default of its Cal-Mortgage-guaranteed loan in March , 1992 . The company had failed to make timely payments on the loan , and Cal-Mortgage officials had uncovered evidence that some work paid with the loan proceeds had not been performed , according to court documents . By declaring a default , the state was able to hold_back $ 12 million in authorized loan proceeds . But nearly $ 5 million was already spent . To pay_back the lender , state officials were forced to make_up the deficit out of Cal-Mortgage reserve_funds . The program took another hit a year later when Triad Healthcare defaulted_on a $ 167-million loan it used to buy two San Fernando Valley hospitals -- Sherman Oaks Hospital and Health Center in Sherman Oaks and West Valley Hospital and Health Center in Canoga Park . The size of that default exceeds Cal-Mortgage ' s reserves , leaving California taxpayers potentially liable for the debt . The loans to Triad and CACCOA were brokered by a member of Cal-Mortgage ' s advisory loan committee , Vincent F . Forte , a vice_president of the investment banking firm of Goldman Sachs &amp; Co . The firm earned $ 2.4 million in_commissions from the Triad deal and $ 350 # 000 from CACCOA ' s . At the time , Cal-Mortgage policy did not prohibit loan committee_members from representing applicants , and Forte abstained_from both votes . He and his firm maintain that his actions were legal and ethical . But state Assemblyman Burt Margolin ( D-Los Angeles ) , who held hearings after a Times report on Triad ' s Cal-Mortgage transaction , has introduced legislation that would bar state employees and appointees from representing clients before their agencies . The law would also bar them from holding positions in applicant companies . Cal-Mortgage has taken steps of its own to safeguard the program from deals such_as Triad and CACCOA . Applicants cannot get hearings before the loan committee unless Cal-Mortgage staff analysts recommend their projects and certify that the applications are complete . In the Triad and CACCOA cases , staff analysts recommended against approval . Also , the director no longer has the power to make unilateral decisions that run counter to recommendations of staff and the loan committee . And Cal-Mortgage now requires the staff to run background checks on license holders and facilities applying for loan guarantees to ensure that disciplinary actions by other state agencies are not overlooked , according to Werdegar .</TEXT>
