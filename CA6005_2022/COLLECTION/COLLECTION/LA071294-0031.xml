   <HEADLINE> MORNING BRIEFING : IS HONESTY STILL THE BEST POLICY ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Jimmy Spencer won his first Winston Cup stock_car race at Daytona Beach recently , he asked his 8-year-old son , also named Jimmy , to come_with him to the press_box for a post-race winner ' s interview . Son : Dad , where are we going ? Father : We ' re going_up there . You ' ve never been up there before . Son : Neither have you , Dad . * Trivia time : For which famous American was Pele named ? * Ol ' Lefty : In Larry King ' s column in USA Today , King referred to the late tennis star , Lew Hoad : &quot; The left-handed Hoad was always a crowd-pleaser. &quot; Yes , but he was always right-handed when he pleased those crowds . * Uh , never mind : The Newark Star-Ledger confirmed in its Monday morning editions that George Raveling was leaving USC for Seton Hall . Raveling said Monday afternoon that he was staying_at USC . * Jordan update : Last week , with the bases loaded , the count full and his Birmingham Barons trailing Huntsville , 5-3 , Michael Jordan grounded to third . When the third_baseman threw the ball away , three runs scored and the Barons won , 6-5 . Said Jordan , &quot; I was calm in that situation and just let my abilities come_out -- what little abilities I have. &quot; * He ' s a Player : Beginning Thursday at Turnberry , Scotland , Gary Player will play in his 40th consecutive British Open , a tournament record . He is the only golfer to win the event in three decades -- 1959 , 1968 , 1974 . His 1974 victory over Peter Oosterhuis at Royal Lytham in England was his biggest British Open payday -- $ 13 # 200 . For the record , Greg Norman won $ 154 # 000 for his victory last year at Sandwich , England . * Good company : When Pete Sampras repeated as Wimbledon champion , he became only the third U.S. man to win consecutive Wimbledon titles in 70 years . The others are Don Budge and John McEnroe . * Dodger bullpen OK : Cathy McAuley , who co-starred in the TV series &quot; Night_Court &quot; as Bull ' s wife , pitches for the show_business celebrity Don MacBeth Memorial Jockey Fund team , which also includes Tim Conway , Alan Thicke and Vince Van Patten . McAuley has an ERA of 15.00 , but it ' s all part of her plan . &quot; People like to see high-scoring games , &quot; she said . &quot; I don ' t want to be Nolan Ryan. &quot; * Adviser redux : The agent for No . 1 NBA draft pick Glenn Robinson is Charles Tucker . Remember him ? He is the Lansing , Mich. , educator who once helped influence the early careers of Magic Johnson , Isiah Thomas and Mark Aguirre and was billed as &quot; adviser to the stars. &quot; Tucker said he thinks Robinson can be the first player to make $ 100 million . Clearly , the stars are getting expensive . * Big job : Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is in Philadelphia this week giving two-a-day private lessons to 7-foot-6 76er Shawn Bradley . * Cover_up ! World Cup viewers in Teheran probably were puzzled when they watched spectators clad in winter gear at games played in 100-degree temperatures . According to Reuters , authorities overseeing rebroadcasts ruled that female fans wearing halter tops and shorts were un-Islamic , so winter clothes were superimposed over the offending spectators . * Trivia answer : Thomas_Edison . Pele ' s actual name is Edson Arantes do Nascimento . * Quotebook : Tony Kornheiser in the Washington Post , after Brazil had defeated the United States , 1-0 , in the World Cup : &quot; Oh yeah ? Save your own damn rain forest. &quot; THOMAS BONK</TEXT>
