   <HEADLINE> HIKING : WOODLAND HILLS : VIEW OF THE VALLEY AT NATURE ' S EDGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Not much open space remains on the south rim of the San Fernando Valley . True , there are the Santa Monica Mountains , but they sometimes seem a world apart , more connected to the ocean side than to the valley side of Los Angeles . So it ' s with some relief that the eye travels over the San Fernando Valley ' s south rim and finds a little green space that isn ' t a golf_course . That green space is Serrania Ridge , a pocket of parkland on the suburban edge . Serrania Ridge , which is part of the_hills of Woodland Hills , is also called Woodland Ridge . ( Woodland Hills itself was formerly known as Girard , named after its subdivider , Victor Girard. ) The Santa Monica Mountains rise directly behind Serrania Ridge . Hikers can contemplate these and other facts of geography as they climb the ridge in search of far-reaching valley views . At the hiker ' s feet is almost endless suburbia , 275 square_miles of green lawns , swimming_pools , lush trees and shrubs , office_buildings and shopping_malls -- a strange combination of tidiness and unseemliness . On clear days , more mountains loom large and dramatic on the far side of the valley : the San Gabriel Mountains , the Simi Hills and the majestic Los Padres National Forest peaks behind Ojai . On days when visibility is less than superb , this hike makes a nice , freeway-close , after-work workout . The hike begins at Serrania Avenue Park , a city park that ' s circled by a long , paved walkway popular_with local dog-walkers and fitness walkers . Directions to trail head : From the Ventura Freeway ( U.S. 101 ) in Woodland Hills , exit on De Soto Avenue and head south . After crossing Ventura Boulevard , the avenue continues as Serrania . Proceed one mile to Serrania Avenue Park . The hike : Join the unsigned path along the far eastern edge of the park and begin climbing south . The steep trail roller-coasters up and down -- mostly up -- offering one rise and then another from which to partake of the view . West of the path are Woodland Hills Country_Club and the hillside suburbs of Calabasas and Hidden Hills . Just east are -- or once were -- the Chalk Hills ; the_hills have been so graded , contoured , terraced and engineered for haciendas that it ' s difficult to discern what was once there . Your path climbs some more and eventually finds Mulholland Drive . Mulholland , a dirt thoroughfare at this point , leads a_couple_of miles west to Topanga Canyon Boulevard and a_couple_of miles east to the back side of Topanga State Park . To reach the very top of Serrania Ridge , cross Mulholland and follow a steep , unsigned trail that begins on the other side . Serrania Ridge Trail Where : Serrania Avenue Park , Woodland Hills Distance : 2 1 / 2 miles round_trip , with 500-foot elevation gain . Terrain : Brushy hills on rim of San Fernando Valley . Highlights : Views of the San Fernando Valley . Degree of Difficulty : Easy-moderate . For More Information : Call Mountain Parks Information , ( 800 ) 533-PARK .</TEXT>
