   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / CONGRESS ; DORNAN CHALLENGES FOE ' S CLAIMS OF SPOUSAL ABUSE ; THE CONGRESSMAN AND HIS WIFE ARE SUING DEMOCRAT MIKE FARBER OVER ALLEGATIONS MADE IN CAMPAIGN MAILERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For years , Rep . Robert K . Dornan has eagerly attacked the moral character of various political adversaries , from his weakest election rivals to the President of the United States . But now , it is the pugnacious Republican ' s reputation that is being assailed , and he doesn ' t like it . Mike Farber , Dornan ' s Democratic opponent in central Orange County ' s 46th Congressional District , has used excerpts from old court records in campaign mailers that accuse the conservative incumbent of having physically attacked his wife , Sallie Dornan , on numerous occasions over 16 years beginning in 1960 . Both Dornans say Farber ' s allegations are lies . On Tuesday they filed a libel lawsuit against Farber and said they will seek a court_order to prevent him from speaking about them or including them in campaign material . &quot; They are basically false allegations , &quot; said the Dornans ' attorney , Kelly Woolsey . As a result of the Farber campaign mailers , &quot; Bob Dornan is getting death threats . . . . It ' s causing a lot of embarrassment and humiliation to the children , &quot; she added . The spousal abuse charges are not new . They were long the topic of whispers in political circles until last year , when the Dornan family , in a series of interviews with The Times , offered its own explanation of the court records . In a story published in June , 1993 , Dornan , wife Sallie and their children all said there was no spousal abuse by the congressman and insisted that the allegations were a result of drug_abuse by Sallie Dornan . Even so , for the first time in Dornan ' s 16-year congressional career , the domestic violence allegations have become a campaign issue as the Nov . 8 election approaches . Beginning with a lilac-colored card that landed Oct . 15 in the mailboxes of Republican and independent voters in central Orange County , and continuing with another campaign mailer arriving in the district today , Farber has delivered a one-two punch that attempts to make Dornan ' s moral character the issue of the campaign . &quot; Congressman Bob Dornan was jailed for beating his wife , &quot; the first mailer claimed . &quot; Would you vote for a man who beats his wife ? &quot; The second campaign piece alleges there were others who also were_on the receiving end of Dornan ' s temper , including an unnamed &quot; gentleman &quot; whom Farber , quoting court documents , alleges suffered &quot; severe , permanent and disabling injuries &quot; after an assault by Dornan . The mailer also alleges that &quot; in at least two separate incidents , an irate Congressman Dornan physically attacked and verbally assaulted two other members on the floor of the House of Representatives. &quot; One widely reported incident involved Dornan grabbing the shirt and tie of then-Rep . Tom Downey ( D-N.Y. ) during a 1985 confrontation between the two , after Dornan called Downey &quot; a draft-dodging wimp. &quot; The other incident involved a 1992 shouting match between Dornan and Rep . W.G. ( Bill ) Hefner ( D-N.C. ) . * Dornan has decided not to comment further on the issue , choosing to respond with the lawsuit and a campaign mailer sent to voters late last week , which consists_of a letter signed by his wife . Dornan ' s lawsuit claims Farber took the spousal abuse charges -- which have since been recanted by Sallie Dornan -- and &quot; intentionally and maliciously &quot; reprinted and distributed them in his campaign mailers . Dornan ' s lawyer said she will ask a judge today for a restraining order to keep Farber from using the information in his campaign . Farber ' s campaign said the lawsuit is an attempt by Dornan to hide from his past . &quot; It ' s remarkable to me that Bob Dornan , the champion of sleaze , could be so thin-skinned , &quot; said Farber campaign spokesman Scott Moxley . &quot; He does not want anybody to see the court records . You can ' t blame him , because it ' s a pretty ugly picture of his past. &quot; Farber ' s attacks pose political peril for his own campaign because the statement about Dornan ' s alleged jailing may have gone beyond what is contained in court and police documents . A Times review last year of court records showed that in June , 1966 , a judge found Dornan guilty of a &quot; violent attack &quot; on his wife and ordered him to jail . But police records showed no evidence that the sentence was carried_out . &quot; The record is quite clear : The judge issued multiple restraining orders and removed ( child ) custody from him and sentenced him to jail , &quot; Moxley said . &quot; If he didn ' t serve ( the jail sentence ) , why didn ' t he ? that ' s something for him to explain. &quot; The impetus for all_the speculation stems from the Dornan case files , which contain four aborted divorce suits between 1960 and 1976 . Among the records are detailed allegations by the Garden Grove congressman ' s wife that he beat her , &quot; dragged her about the home . . . by her hair . . . ( and ) exhibited a revolver. &quot; Last year , Sallie Dornan admitted in an interview with The Times that she perjured herself in court , saying she fabricated the charges against her husband because she was severely addicted to Darvon and Valium , prescription medications . With the backing of their children , the Dornans granted The Times access to private medical and police records to confirm their version of events . After the story appeared , Dornan attacked it , saying he cooperated only after feeling &quot; threatened &quot; by The Times ' decision to do the story . When the article focused_on his wife , rather than him , he said , it &quot; ceased to be a legitimate story , certainly not front-page news. &quot; Now , ironically , Dornan is using the story to attack Farber and is offering copies of the Times article to voters . Farber , a San Diego businessman who moved to Santa Ana to run_for the congressional seat , said he does not believe the Dornans ' story . During a news_conference Oct . 15 to unveil his first campaign &quot; hit &quot; piece , Farber emphasized he was attacking the character of the congressman , not of his wife , whom he described as a domestic violence victim trying to help save her husband ' s political career . &quot; I think Sallie Dornan is a fine person , a good mother , and in this case , an excellent spouse , &quot; Farber said . That statement was repeated in the follow-up campaign piece mailed this week to all district voters . * But Sallie Dornan , who has been married to the congressman for 39 years , doesn ' t see it that way . &quot; He used me to get Bob . That is a coward . That is a man of no integrity and no honor , &quot; she said during an interview Tuesday . &quot; I am tired_of turning my guts out and my kids ' guts out. &quot; Asked why he is employing the same aggressive campaign tactics he has criticized Dornan for using , the Democratic candidate replied : &quot; This is the type of approach you have to have with Bob Dornan : head to head , man to man. &quot; In his campaign mailings , Farber is offering voters copies of records from Los Angeles Superior_Court , where the cases were filed . In the Dornan campaign mailer , Sallie Dornan offers a brief description of events that occurred more_than three decades ago , which began , she said , when she underwent three major_surgeries that led to the development of the drug_addiction . &quot; In poor health , my judgment impaired , I made terrible decisions and false accusations against my husband , &quot; the campaign mailer states . The letter also explains her husband ' s loud outbursts . &quot; My husband makes some people angry because he fights passionately and forcefully for our beliefs , but everything his opponent says is a lie . He has never harmed me , &quot; the letter by Sallie Dornan claims . In an interview , Sallie Dornan said that &quot; every woman should be so lucky &quot; to have a husband who stands_by his family . &quot; There ' s all kinds of abuse , and I abused him &quot; by making false allegations , she said .</TEXT>
