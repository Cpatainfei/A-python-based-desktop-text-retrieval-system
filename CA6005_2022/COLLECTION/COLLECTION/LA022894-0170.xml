   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : IRVINE ; CITY RELEASES REPORT ON QUAKE READINESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The vast majority of city structures were built with seismic safety in mind and probably would fare well during a major temblor , city officials said in a report on earthquake readiness . The report was prepared in the wake of the Northridge earthquake and was presented to the City_Council last week . City building inspectors did express concerns about the more_than 200 &quot; concrete tilt-up &quot; warehouse structures that could experience substantial damage during a large quake . Most of the &quot; tilt-up &quot; warehouses are in the Irvine Business Complex , a district of office towers , commercial buildings and industrial sites at the western edge of the city . The concrete buildings can be retrofitted to resist a quake by bolting the walls , floors and ceilings together . Such retrofitting is required for warehouses that are converted into meeting rooms for churches and other groups . Retrofitting is voluntary for all other businesses . About 13 of the tilt-up structures have been retrofitted so far . Irvine probably would sustain decidedly less damage during a major quake than did the San Fernando Valley because most of the city ' s structures were built after 1974 and had to comply with strict quake building standards , City_Manager Paul O . Brady Jr . said . There are no non-reinforced masonry buildings in the city and very few older single-family homes that are not bolted to their foundations . Most residential parts of Irvine have little susceptibility to liquefaction , according to data from the California Division of Mining and Geology . Some parts of the Irvine Business Complex have a slightly higher susceptibility , according to the data.SHELBY GRAD</TEXT>
