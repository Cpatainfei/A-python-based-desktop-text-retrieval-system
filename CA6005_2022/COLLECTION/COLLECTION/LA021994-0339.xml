   <TEXT> What does_it mean to live a spiritual life in modern times ? Naoshwerwan Anzar , a writer , publisher and follower of Meher Baba , will ponder the question in a keynote_address next Saturday at Occidental College ' s Herrick Chapel . His speech is part of a two-day celebration at Occidental of the 100th anniversary of the birth of the Indian spiritual master . Sponsored by the Avatar Meher Baba Center of Southern California and Occidental ' s HerrickChapel and Interfaith Center , the festivities -- to be held from noon to 10 p.m. Friday and from 1 to 10 p.m. next Saturday -- will include music , films and skits . Anzar will speak at 4 p.m. next Saturday . Michael Kerze , who teaches religion and science at Occidental and directs Herrick Chapel , said Baba devotees &quot; are a part of the wonderful religious variety here in Southern California . I thought it would be good for our students to be exposed to one of the significant religious figures of our time. &quot; Born Merwan S . Irani on Feb . 25 , 1894 in Poona , India , the Avatar , or Divine Incarnation , said his identity as God in human form was unveiled to him through a meeting with an old Muslim holy woman . The appellation Meher Baba , which means &quot; compassionate father , &quot; was given him by his mandali , or &quot; close ones , &quot; who were of many different castes and creeds . Anzar , who has published Glow International , a magazine devoted to Baba , since 1966 , knew the leader when he lived_in Anzar ' s hometown of Dehra Dun , India . &quot; Several of his close ones , including my father , were sent to bring lepers and other suffering people to him , &quot; Anzar said . &quot; He would wash their feet , clothe them and send them on their way &quot; transformed by the love they experienced in his presence , he recalled . Anzar said he has felt Baba ' s powerful presence on a number of occasions . Baba said that God takes human form every 700 to 1 # 400 years to spread the word of love , and that he had come_to earth to awaken mankind to the universal spiritual messages given by such previous avatars as Buddha , Rama , Krishna , Mohammed and Jesus . The spiritualist , who &quot; dropped his body , &quot; as his followers say , on Jan . 31 , 1969 , wanted no religion created in his name but rather to emphasize the oneness of all religions . According to Linda Zavala , chairwoman of the centennial event , &quot; He came_to awaken the love and divine intuition within each person through intimate contact , rather than teaching , as gurus do. &quot; A celebratory dinner will be held at 5:30 p.m. next Saturday .
