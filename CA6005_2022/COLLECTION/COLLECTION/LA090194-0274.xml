   <HEADLINE> THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY : PROPOSED GAG ORDER POSES THREAT FAR BEYOND SIMPSON CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If my only connection to the newspaper was as a reader , I ' d applaud Judge Lance A . Ito for trying to dam the flow of news leaks that have helped make the O.J. Simpson case such a circus . After watching the private lives of victims and the accused splashed in a lurid and often erroneous manner and reading and watching stories attributed only to various unnamed sources , I ' d cheer his proposed order restricting cops , defense_attorneys , prosecutors and others from talking_about the case , and limiting access to legal_documents . It would n ' t simply be the bad taste many of the bad stories have left in my mouth , although that would be a factor . Most important , I would wonder , as Judge Ito did_in court Wednesday , how a fair trial is possible , how 12 impartial jurors could be selected , amid this unprecedented torrent of news . But my perspective as a journalist is different . I see judicial gags as real threats that go_far beyond the Simpson case . They interfere with political debate , investigations into government corruption and even with the rights of the defendants the orders are supposed to protect . * Everyone I ' ve talked to says Ito is a terrific judge . He ' s a clear-thinking , intelligent jurist who proved his ability to handle tough cases when he presided over Charles Keating ' s fraud trial . He also has a sense_of_humor . So it was easy to sympathize_with him Tuesday as he wrestled with an old conflict in American law , trying to reconcile the demands of the 1st Amendment , guaranteeing freedom_of_speech , and the 6th Amendment , which assures defendants a fair trial . He felt the 1st Amendment side -- the reporters and the prosecution and defense leakers who have been feeding them -- was overwhelming the 6th Amendment forces , burying them with stories that will prejudice the minds of potential jurors . The overflow of information , he said , has been heightened because of the proliferation of news coverage and the enhanced ability and desire of television to cover big crime trials . Ito was especially bothered by the leaks . I don ' t blame him . Whatever ethics lessons are taught in law_school , they don ' t include a warning against leaking . Give a lawyer a piece of the Simpson case and he or she becomes a sieve . Even Ito ' s proposed gag order , which he would n ' t give to news organizations , leaked into print . Sounding annoyed , he told how he ' d picked_up The Times Tuesday morning , and read what he had wanted to keep confidential . But let ' s take the issue beyond Judge Ito and his particular frustrations . What he sought in his proposed order was total control over what anyone involved in the case said or wrote -- over all documents , evidence , lawyers ' remarks , just about everything . As I said , Ito seems to be a fine judge . But some of his colleagues don ' t measure_up to that standard . Some are political_hacks who got their jobs by raising money for the governor that appointed them . Some , while qualified , are part of the fairly small layer of business people , politicians and powerful lawyers who shape events around here . If a reporter reveals government corruption , resulting in an indictment , a judge hostile to the press could impose a gag order , sharply limiting the press ' s ability to poke deeper into the case and find_out if more people were involved . Gag orders have been used to muzzle criticism of public prosecutors and limit debate on public policy . In the federal trial of the police_officers accused of beating Rodney King , Judge John G . Davies ordered defense_attorney Harland W . Braun to stop &quot; publicly impugning the motives &quot; of federal prosecutors in the case . The order was overturned by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals . The trouble with such orders , Braun told me , was that &quot; in this country , we decide fundamental issues of public policy in the courts . The King case involved a huge public issue. &quot; By attempting to silence him , Judge Davies was cutting_off Braun ' s right to speak out on public policy , and to criticize the government . Finally , gag orders , although supposedly designed to protect defendants , often end_up harming them . Simpson ' s attorney , Robert L . Shapiro , made that point in court Tuesday . Shapiro said that in the next four weeks , &quot; we understand that numerous media are going_to be airing various shows , docudramas , interviews with family members. &quot; A gag order , he said , would prevent the defense &quot; from giving any kind of response at all , &quot; even though &quot; the majority of people who appear on television &quot; are prosecution witnesses or associated in some way with the victims of the crime . &quot; If false information is disseminated and we don ' t have any opportunity to reply , &quot; Shapiro said , Simpson is prevented from getting a fair trial . * Ito ' s motive obviously is to protect potential jurors from news manipulation by both sides . But they have already been inundated , and so what . Kelli L . Sager , an attorney representing The Times and other news organizations , noted that widespread publicity didn ' t prevent acquittals of auto executive John DeLorean on charges of smuggling cocaine or William Kennedy Smith , who was tried_for rape . Secrecy is the real danger in government . It breeds inaccuracy and rumor , and promotes illegality and injustice . As Sager told Judge Ito , &quot; More speech is the answer , not less speech. &quot;</TEXT>
