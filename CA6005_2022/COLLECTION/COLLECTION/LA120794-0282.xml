   <HEADLINE> POSTCARD FROM CYBERSPACE / DANIEL AKST : THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; ENCRYPTION PROTECTS VIRTUAL CASH FOR ON-LINE SHOPPING ON NET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Internet is good for a lot of things , but one thing it ' s not much good for -- at least not yet -- is commerce . Plenty of businesses are using the Internet , mostly as a promotional vehicle to disseminate information about their products , but there ' s no really good way to buy anything . Security is the biggest problem . Large commercial services like CompuServe and Prodigy make_it possible to buy from a merchant securely , but transactions over the Internet are just too public : If you send your MasterCard number via e-mail , the message might pass_through many sites en route , giving the unscrupulous plenty of opportunities to steal your credit_card number . The lack of cyber-money may have prolonged the Net ' s communal flavor and pleased some purists . But the absence of a way to pay , say , 25 cents for an investment column or a recipe for reindeer chili means that really good investment columns and reindeer chili recipes are scarce in cyberspace -- and everybody is poorer for it . An Internet-wide system for secure transactions has been the Holy_Grail of cyberspace for some time , but only this year has a solution been in_sight . During 1994 , a whole series of plans for secure credit_card transactions and digital cash have been announced , some of them with backing from players big enough that they have to be taken seriously . One big thrust comes from CyberCash Inc. of Vienna , Va. , whose founders and partners include William Melton , the founder of Verifone Inc. , which makes machines used by retailers to authorize credit_card purchases , and James Bidzos , a major player in software encryption . Bidzos says the goal of CyberCash is &quot; extending the credit_card network into the Internet. &quot; Another nascent competitor is First Virtual Holdings Inc. , based in San Diego . Headed by Lee Stein , a well-known attorney and financial adviser , First Virtual plans to use a relatively simple e-mail system in which consumers would be asked to confirm every purchase they make . First USA , a Texas bank , would provide credit_card authorization and clearing , while giant Electronic Data Systems would handle data processing . Microsoft Corp . and Visa International also have plans for a system of secure electronic credit_card transactions , using encryption technology from RSA Data Security Inc. of Redwood City , Calif. , a company headed by Bidzos . Visa and Microsoft have even said they will make their technical specifications public , presumably in hopes of establishing their system as the standard . And just this week , Netscape Communications , a leading purveyor of the Mosaic software for navigating the Internet , and BankAmerica said they would join forces to develop a secure system for Internet credit_card transactions . But just as most people use plastic for some purchases and cash for others , some entrepreneurs insist that consumers in cyberspace will want virtual cash as well as virtual plastic . And to me , the rise of true digital cash is one of the most interesting developments in cyberspace today . Digital cash may sound futuristic , but an Amsterdam-based company called DigiCash is working_on bringing what it calls e-cash to the Internet . You have to take DigiCash seriously ( e-mail info.digicash.nl for information ) because it ' s owned by David Chaum , a bearded Los Angeles native and Ph.D cryptographer who is a leading light in this field . Chaumian digital cash relies_on a clever dual-key encryption system that simultaneously protects the spender ' s privacy , provides the user with a transaction record , and assures that the cash is legitimate . Transaction costs are so low that even purchases costing just pennies won ' t break the bank . The whole_thing is based on the concept of the digital signature , familiar to Internet privacy hounds from the PGP , or Pretty Good Privacy , software freely available in cyberspace . PGP relies_on a set of &quot; keys , &quot; or codes that the program uses to encrypt and unencrypt messages . A user has a public key , available to everyone , and a private key , which no one else gets . Messages &quot; signed &quot; using the private key can be verified by recipients using the signer ' s public key . Now imagine that Alice wants to buy something from Bob ( Alice and Bob are cryptography ' s favorite hypotheticals ) . Alice presents the First Digital Bank with what amounts to a digital check -- a 100-digit number randomly generated by her computer , mathematically &quot; blinded , &quot; and &quot; signed &quot; with her private key . The bank verifies her signature ( using her public key ) , replaces it with its own signature , and returns the &quot; money. &quot; Alice then spends the money at Bob ' s on-line store , and receives a record of the transaction . Bob gets the money . And the bank cannot link the specific electronic currency to Alice , which prevents the bank from tracking her activities and preferences . CyberCash has reportedly been discussing licensing Chaum ' s technology , which is showing signs of catching_on elsewhere as well . In Germantown , Md. , for instance , entrepreneur Bob Houston has created what he calls NetCash , which is already in_use here and there ( for information , e-mail netbank-info.agents.com ) . Chaum ' s system could have big implications . It would vastly expand the marketplace for information by permitting sellers to charge as little as pennies at a time . But on a big enough scale , the private and instantaneous nature of Chaumian payments conceivably could erode the power of governments to monitor and tax spending , implement monetary policy and monopolize the issuing of currency . Kevin Kelly , in his book &quot; Out of Control : The Rise of Neo-Biological Civilization &quot; ( Addison-Wesley ) , suggests that digital cash is the perfect vehicle for the privatization of currency , since &quot; the law of the Net is : He who owns a computer not only owns a printing_press , but also a mint. &quot; He welcomes messages at akstd.news.latimes.com but regrets that he cannot reply to each and every one .</TEXT>
