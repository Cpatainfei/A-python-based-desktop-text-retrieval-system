   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : SECOND OPINION ; COMMENTARY FROM OTHER MEDIA ; TIME FOR IRA TO TAKE ITS SEAT AT_PEACE TABLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is now over two months since the joint declaration of a charter for peace and reconciliation in Ireland was announced . Among the most important aspects was the statement that all parties committed to the peace process would be able to take_part in the negotiations . This was an appeal , in particular , to the IRA to declare peace and for their political arm , namely , Sinn Fein , to take their place at the negotiating table . We can only hope and pray that they heed the wishes of the vast majority of the people of Ireland and help establish a United Ireland .</TEXT>
