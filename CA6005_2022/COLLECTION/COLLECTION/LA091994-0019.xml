   <HEADLINE> JOB SECURITY ? IT ' S JUST AN ILLUSION ; EMPLOYMENT : IF YOUR BOSS DISLIKES WHAT YOU READ , YOU COULD BE SACKED . THE RIGHT TO FIRE WITHOUT VALID REASON FLOURISHES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Under a 19th-Century judge-made common-law doctrine formally described as &quot; employment at will , &quot; workers in the United States could be fired for any reason or no reason at all . Many scholars now believe that employment at will is a dead legal doctrine . They accurately point to 20th-Century state and federal laws limiting employer discretion to terminate employees , large jury awards for some terminated employees and growing numbers of court filings under state and federal laws prohibiting arbitrary discrimination . It is also true that courts have made exceptions to judge-made employment-at-will doctrine . Outrageously arbitrary discharges that affect public policy -- like the discharge of an employee for refusing to provide perjured testimony in the employer ' s interests , are now illegal under California common_law , for example . A few statutes ban similarly arbitrary discharges , but only when the public has an interest in the outcome . Thus , a California statute makes_it unlawful to fire an employee for serving on a jury , because the public has an interest in making jury service minimally disruptive for jurors . Yet , despite these statutory and judge-made exceptions , the law of employment at will still dominates the American work place . Its statutory and common_law exceptions create no more_than a contrary illusion . The true measure of employer discretion to terminate employees at will is not the number of statutes and common-law decisions making exceptions to employment at will . It is what those statutes and exceptions cover . Add_up all_the state and federal statutes banning discrimination on grounds of race , sex , religion , age , national origin and handicap . Include the federal law prohibiting discrimination because of union activity . Mix all_of these statutes with judge-made exceptions to employment at will on public-policy grounds . Combined , they still ban no more_than a tiny fraction of arbitrary reasons for which an employer may lawfully discharge employees . For every private-sector employee fired for reasons made unlawful by a discrimination statute or a narrow exception to common-law employment at will , thousands may be discharged for arbitrary reasons not covered by statute or the common_law . John_Doe and Mary Poe , for example , could not be discharged for reasons of race or sex , but both could be lawfully fired by their corporate employers for reading a newspaper the employer did not like . They could collect no more_than a_few weeks of unemployment_compensation . Poe and Doe could both be fired for theft of company property -- even though they stole nothing . Except in Montana -- the only state with a law making discharges &quot; without just cause &quot; illegal -- no statute would cover their cases , nor would any exception to employment at will . So outside of Montana , no legal forum would be open for them to prove their innocence and recover their jobs . If Poe and Doe were covered by collective-bargaining agreements , their union could take their cases to arbitration and probably win . But that possibility would govern today for only 11 % of the private-sector work_force , and that figure will shrink to around 6 % by the year 2000 if many prominent economists are right . Employment at will , long dead and buried in the world ' s other industrial democracies , is alive and well in the United States . Its viability is enhanced by the illusion of its death .</TEXT>
