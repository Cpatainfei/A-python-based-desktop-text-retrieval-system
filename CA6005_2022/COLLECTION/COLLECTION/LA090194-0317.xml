   <HEADLINE> GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS : GLENDALE ; CITY MAY ESTABLISH DISTRICT FOR CINEMAS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Inspired by the active night life in Pasadena , Santa Monica and other communities that &quot; cluster &quot; movie_theaters in a central location , Glendale is drafting an ordinance that would permit new cinemas to be built only along Brand Boulevard . Glendale already has two multiplex cinemas in the downtown area -- the Mann 8 Theaters and the Glendale Central Cinemas -- but both are_on side streets , off the beaten path . City officials say Glendale has room for at least two more theaters , and they want to ensure that , unlike the existing two , they face or adjoin the thoroughfare . Jeanne Armstrong , the city ' s redevelopment director , said the idea fits the long-term goal of making Brand a more pedestrian-oriented , lively retail area . &quot; We are borrowing this idea from other cities that have successfully implemented similar restrictions , &quot; said Armstrong . &quot; Santa Monica has an ordinance that says all cinemas should be_on the ( Third Street ) Promenade , and that was the catalyst for them . They had cinemas trying to locate all_over town , and so they zoned them into one location. &quot; The &quot; cinema zone &quot; ordinance , which could be adopted by the City_Council before the end of the year , also fits the city ' s ambition of becoming a theater district with a mix of live stage and movie entertainment . The city has already given financial_aid to two theater groups , A Noise Within and the Colony Theater , to help them find homes_in downtown Glendale . They will join the existing Alex Theater and Glendale Center Theatre performing houses , Armstrong said . But it would not preclude the owners of the Fashion Center mall east of downtown Glendale from building a planned multiscreen theater . Although the mall recently changed ownership , plans for a theater there were approved before the cinema zone was conceived , officials said . Possible locations for new multiplexes on Brand include the Glendale Marketplace , a proposed two-block retail project south of Broadway ; an expansion of the Glendale Galleria onto Brand , south of the existing Mervyn ' s department_store , and the second phase of the Glendale City_Center , an 18-story office tower fronted by a Super Crown bookstore and several restaurants . Of those three projects , only the City_Center has announced any concrete plans for construction . Homart Development plans to break ground early next year on a four-story office and retail building at Brand and Wilson Avenue . But Alan Pyenson , the firm ' s marketing director , said it has not decided yet whether a movie_house will be included . &quot; There is the possibility of ( cinemas ) happening , but right now we ' re pursuing several tenants , just trying to put_together the center , &quot; Pyenson said . He said he thinks the city is &quot; going_in the right direction &quot; to restrict new theaters to a single area . &quot; You ' re going to get the ambience that other cities have succeeded in getting . You ' ll be able to park your car once and walk to a choice of screens , &quot; Pyenson said . &quot; It ' s going_to give Brand a cohesive front. &quot; STEVE RYFLE</TEXT>
