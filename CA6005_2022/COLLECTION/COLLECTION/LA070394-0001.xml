   <TEXT> Remember when man went_to the moon ? You may have missed it . Lots of us did . The summer of 1969 was tipped steeply toward the future , and for those of us who were certain that the U.S. empire was in its final days , who were making sandwiches for the radical underground or packing our bags for the back-country communes , and for millions of the less alienated as well , Neil Armstrong ' s first_step onto another world seemed , already , ancient history . A couple of white guys on the moon ? A flag held_out with wire ? It was more artifact than harbinger , and to prove it , there was the voice of the trickster himself , Richard Nixon , looping back through space , congratulating himself on behalf of all humanity . I thought then that the Moon deserved better . I think today that Apollo deserved better . As Andrew Chaikin points_out in &quot; A Man on the Moon , &quot; &quot; Apollo was the last great act this country played_out of optimism , if looking_forward to the future. &quot; But the America that Kennedy pointed toward the moon in 1961 was not the America that arrived there in 1969 . It had been shattered and transformed by youth revolt and racial conflict . The irony of Apollo was that its achievement spanned one of the century ' s pivotal decades and was overshadowed by another of humanity ' s watershed triumphs : Vietnam , the first decisive military victory of a Third_World people over a neocolonial superpower . None of this was the fault of Apollo , which was one of the great voyages in human history , and we are nothing if not a voyaging species . Together with the Russians ( for the cosmonauts provided the stimulus of competition , even if they turned_out to have been only shadowboxing with the Moon ) , Apollo yanked the world from suborbital to off-planet flight , recapitulating aviation ' s dizzying half-century of progress in less than a decade . And did_it , let it be said , with grace and style and even a certain uncharacteristic ( for America , and for science ) humility . It didn ' t have to turn_out that way . Apollo was a compromise from the start , a hybrid of Nazi rocketry , Cold_War competition , L.B.J. pork-barrel politics and Kennedy glamour ( with the astronauts as runway models ) . Yet it succeeded so magnificently because it had unique strengths . The Russians failed organizationally , not scientifically , with competing agencies fighting behind a wall of secrecy . NASA , by contrast not only with the Russians but with our own growing secretiveness , operated in the daylight with an extraordinary clarity of purpose and willingness to experiment . Perhaps most fortunate , NASA was independent of the military . By the time NASA become a proper , calcified , hypocritical , full-blown bureaucracy , Apollo was history and the footprints were_on the moon . Mercury / Gemini / Apollo is one story , and a story that has been told many times , by journalists and historians and hacks , by astronauts such_as Frank Borman , Michael Collins and Buzz Aldrin , and by belles-lettres luminaries such_as Norman Mailer , Tom Wolfe and even James Michener , who made of space a sort of sub-subzero South Pacific . It was to be expected that the 25th anniversary of Apollo 11 this summer would produce a fresh new spate of books . And I am pleased to note that one of them , Andrew Chaikin ' s &quot; A Man on the Moon , &quot; is more_than worthy of its grand subject . Chaikin ' s eight years of labor and hundreds of hours of interviews have yielded what will surely be considered the authoritative history of Apollo . A second newcomer , &quot; Deke ! , &quot; ranks with Michael Collins ' earlier &quot; Carrying the Fire &quot; as one of the most vivid personal accounts . And a third , &quot; Moon_Shot , &quot; falls_back and burns in the atmosphere , so to speak . All three books claim to tell the inside , the untold , the secret story of Apollo . But the real secret of Apollo is that there were no secrets . ( Indeed , one wonders if we would have made_it to the moon_on Kennedy ' s schedule -- &quot; before this decade is out &quot; -- if the Russians had been as open , and we had known how far behind they were. ) There are details , trivia , personal glimpses ( such_as astronaut Pete Conrad ' s bet with Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci as_to what his first words on the moon would be ) , but there are no shocking revelations . Perhaps that is appropriate , for unlike the poles or the upper Amazon , the Moon was an explorers ' goal everyone had already seen . Chaikin ' s book belongs_to that new breed of personalized history perhaps best exemplified by the late Randy Shilts ( &quot; And the Band Played On &quot; ) or James Gleick ( &quot; Chaos : Making a New Science &quot; ) in which the scientific or political adventure is seen_through the lens of personality . Chaikin lets the astronauts &quot; take us &quot; through the program and to the moon , but he doesn ' t slight the less-known characters ( some with peculiarly American names such_as Chuck Berry , Tom Paine and Christopher Columbus Kraft ) who built and ran NASA . Especially memorable here are the geologists : Lee Silver , who took the astronauts on field trips to the Orocopia Mountains and taught them to collect rocks , and Farouk el-Baz ( &quot; Have we run_out of geologists in this country ? &quot; asked Alan Shepard ) , who taught the command_module pilots to not only look_at but see the lunar terrain . While authoritative , Chaikin ' s book is anything but dry . Through the astronauts ' own eyes we see the luminous plains and dark escarpments ; we feel the thrill , and the letdown as well ( &quot; It ' s kind of like the song : Is that all there is ? &quot; astronaut Al Bean mused ) . And we never lose touch with the fear that is a pilot ' s most trusted companion , especially so far from home . Every time a ship gets ready to lift_off the moon , or even just to change orbits , the unspoken question rises , unbidden : &quot; Is it going_to light ? &quot; And as we already know , it lights , every time . Apollo was blessed with that essential of the explorer , luck . Even the bad_luck turned good . The fatal Apollo I fire forced a redesign of the capsule that couldn ' t have happened if the fire had occurred off the pad . The explosion ( another electrical fire ) on Apollo 13 happened at the right time , and with the right commander , Jim Lovell , a veteran who had already been once around the Moon . Chaikin ' s &quot; A Man on the Moon &quot; starts with the Apollo I fire that claimed Roger Chaffee , Ed White and the man who might have been the first to walk on the moon , Gus Grissom , and ends with the Apollo 17 astronauts ' disgust at Nixon ' s on-the-air dismissal of further space_travel ( &quot; . . . this may be the last time in this century that men will walk on the moon &quot; ) . &quot; Moon_Shot &quot; covers more ground , from the Mercury and Gemini_programs through the Apollo-Soyuz linkups , and it looks promising , as it ' s ( ostensibly , at least ) written by two of the top astronauts , Deke Slayton and Alan Shepard . Shepard , who was the only one of the original &quot; Mercury Seven &quot; to make_it to the moon , combines in one person the high and low points of the program . Landing on the moon with Apollo 14 , he steps_out , looks_up at the earth and , surprising himself , weeps like a child ; or rather , like a man . The next day he trivializes the whole experience by swatting a golf_ball out_of_sight . Shepard and Slayton , who was chief astronaut and also one of the Mercury Seven , were genuine &quot; right-stuff &quot; guys . Just cautious enough , they knew how far you could push hardware ; they knew teamwork ; and they knew how to fly . They have a story to tell , but unfortunately their book reads as if it had been cobbled_together out of first drafts of press_releases . Here ' s Armstrong during the Moon landing : &quot; ( He ) gripped the hand controller in his fist , firm and strong , with a touch honed by years of flight in jets and rockets. &quot; A description of air combat : &quot; The sword play of flashing wings and howling engines in the thin , cold air of a high-altitude struggle where man met man. &quot; And then : &quot; The year 1967 rolled in like a political garbage_truck with its wheels on fire. &quot; Only those who have seen a political garbage_truck with burning wheels , rolling , can appreciate just how precise that image is . It ' s a pity , but when all_the books are telling essentially the same story , the telling is all . The hype , the hysteria and the sentimentality studiously avoided in the Chaikin book seems to have all ended_up in &quot; Moon_Shot , &quot; which spins_out of control on almost every page . Even though Apollo was the quintessential team enterprise , there were a_few individuals who seem irreplaceable : James Webb , who ran interference with Congress ; Wernher von Braun , who hit London with the V-2 and was convinced that his Saturn could do the same for the moon ; George Low , who rushed the schedule to make Apollo Eight the first manned circumlunar flight ( the Russians had done_it , but the astronaut was a turtle ) . The thing about astronauts is that they all can fly . The only one of them who seems essential to the success of Apollo is the one who never made_it to the moon . It was one of the great fortunes of Apollo that Deke Slayton was grounded with a heart irregularity , for in &quot; Father Slayton &quot; NASA had a man who could set the rotations , pick the terms and make the decisions the astronauts would n ' t have accepted from a bureaucrat or a scientist . If &quot; A Man on the Moon &quot; is the authoritative masterpiece , &quot; Deke ! &quot; is the book I read in one gulp . Slayton , who knew he was dying of cancer when he started writing , was fortunate to find as a collaborator Michael Cassutt , a respected science-fiction author good_enough to make himself transparent . &quot; Deke ! &quot; reaches back the farthest of any of the books -- into Slayton ' s days as a 19-year-old flying B-25s over Monte Cassino . If Slayton sometimes scants the personal , he ' s intimate about the hardware in every area of his life . He discusses with affection and loathing not only the Saturn and the lunar landing module , but the F-100 , the C-47 , a creaky military transport and the Studebaker Light Six ( which didn ' t have the V-8 ' s weak valves ) . Slayton was with NASA for 20 years , and finally made_it into orbit as part of a Russian-American team . He is generous but candid about what happened to our space_program after Apollo . When the shuttle blew_up , he understood immediately : &quot; The solid rocket motors simply weren ' t designed to be launched with ice hanging off them. &quot; He rates Jim Webb , the first administrator , as the best , and he left when the Reagan_Administration replaced him . Slayton never retired . Instead of going_for one of the corporate board positions routinely tendered to astronauts , he characteristically ended his days playing with rockets , as head of a private company trying to launch ( among other things ) human remains into orbit . He died a year ago , the most down-to-earth man who ever went_into space . One closes these books with regret . Humankind may yet have a future in space , but the earth-tethered shuttle program isn ' t it . Mars calls , but no one is answering . It ' s as if Columbus , instead of returning to the &quot; new_world , &quot; had settled for harbor cruises . As astronaut Stuart Roosa puts it , &quot; Apollo was our unfinished obelisk . It ' s like we started building this beautiful thing and then we quit. &quot; Neither America nor Russia could do_it today . The blueprints for the F-1 engines are lost , and if you want to see the business end of a Saturn rocket , you have to look_into a mirror at the Air and Space Museum , for even that giant hall can only hold half . If you want to watch a Saturn V lift_off , and hear the roar as the heavens split open , and feel the earth shake as it slings a man toward the moon -- well , it ' s too late . You missed it . * Times Link : 808-8463 To hear Andrew Chaikin reading from his &quot; A Man on the Moon : The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts , &quot; call TimesLink and press * 7812 Call TimesLink from area_codes 213 , 310 , 714 , 818 or 909 .
