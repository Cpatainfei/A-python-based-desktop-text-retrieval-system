   <TEXT> David Kurtz , an attorney and assistant U.S. bobsled coach , said the U.S. Skeleton and Bobsled Federation is likely to countersue driver Bruce Rosselli if he persists_in &quot; criminal allegatations &quot; against driver Brian Shimer . Shimer and driver Randy Will did not attend a news_conference with the U.S. team Sunday.It was announced that they were working_on their sleds , but Shimer might also have chosen to avoid questions about a federal suit Rosselli filed at Indianapolis last week , charging him with theft of equipment as part of an alleged conspiracy by the federation to favor driver Jim Herberich during the Olympic trials . Rosselli , who failed to qualify for the third time , is also seeking an injunction that would prevent the U.S. team from participating in the Olympics , but Kurtz said he had heard unofficially that the injunction request will be dropped . In noting that the conspiracy charge has been rejected in arbitration , a ruling upheld in Illinois state court , Kurtz said , &quot; We ' re tired in the spirit of good sportsmanship of turning the other cheek with each allegation , &quot; he said . &quot; These very unfair accusations by a very frustrated athlete are tarnishing the reputation of a very fine driver . &quot; We don ' t want to disrupt our focus here , but if the allegations persist , we will certainly countersue. &quot; ROSS NEWHAN</TEXT>
