   <HEADLINE> SOCIALISTS WILL TRY TO REJOIN JAPAN COALITION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite a renewed offer from the opposition Liberal Democratic Party to name their leader as prime_minister , Japan ' s Socialists agreed to try again today to rejoin the coalition of outgoing Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata . Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama met Hata and six other leaders of parties in the coalition Tuesday and said he will participate in an eleventh-hour attempt to patch together a new ruling alliance . Negotiations on policies for the coalition began this morning . If they are successful , a decision on whom to name as prime_minister will follow , the eight leaders agreed . Although Yohei Kono , the Liberal Democrats ' president , has courted the Socialists fervently , Hata ' s coalition has adopted a studied coolness toward the left-leaning party whose April walkout deprived it of a majority . The Socialists hold a swing vote between the coalition and the Liberal Democrats , whose 38-year rule came_to an end last summer . Facing an LDP no-confidence motion he could not defeat , Hata resigned Saturday after talks with the Socialists collapsed . In a meeting with Murayama on Tuesday night , held after he agreed to make a final effort to reach an accord with the coalition , Kono reiterated an earlier offer of the premiership . The Socialist leader replied that he will contact Kono after negotiations with the coalition . &quot; Either way , we must make a decision by tomorrow , &quot; Murayama said Tuesday . Kono and Murayama agreed that the lower house should vote for a new prime_minister today , the last_day of its current session , to give Japan ' s new leader time to prepare to attend the Group of Seven economic summit and meet President Clinton in Naples , Italy , from July 8-10 . Murayama also agreed with the seven coalition leaders to &quot; make supreme efforts &quot; to hold the vote today . Failure to reach agreement would force an extension of the session .</TEXT>
