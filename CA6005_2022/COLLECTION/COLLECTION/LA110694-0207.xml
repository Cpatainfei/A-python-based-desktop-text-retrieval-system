   <TEXT> Jorge Esquivel should have been an international superstar . Balletomanes everywhere should have thought of him when they thought_of Rudolf Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov . Extraordinarily lithe , eminently Latin and macho-muscular , he exuded what the hypesters like to call animal_magnetism . He was a firebrand , in the best sense . But he also was a cavalier , a disciplined stylist and the most self-effacing , most considerate , most reliable partner a ballerina could dream of . He had the touch of a poet . Even better , he had the touch of a tall poet . Like Nureyev and Baryshnikov , Esquivel came from a Communist country . Unfortunately for him , perhaps , it wasn ' t the country of the glamorous Kirov and Bolshoi . Esquivel was , in more_than one sense , a product of Fidel Castro ' s Cuba . As such , he also was the protege and , for most impractical purposes , the property of Alicia Alonso , the legendary dancer who created a world-class company in her own image with the total support of the Castro regime . Born in 1950 , Esquivel was chosen for glory while still a boy . Carefully trained , studiously nurtured and painstakingly groomed , he rose from a modest background to become the premier danseur of the Ballet Nacional de Cuba and , as such , the primary partner of its aging , nearly blind , eternally compelling prima_ballerina assoluta . He was , from 1972 to 1986 , the leading male dancer in Cuba . That virtually made him the leading male dancer in Latin_America . He earned spectacular triumphs wherever the Cuban ballet was allowed to tour , even , as the iron_curtains eventually began to open , in America . Still , his repertory was confined to the Havana repertory , and his opportunities for professional expansion remained slim . A Cuban dancer -- by political , social and artistic definition -- could not be an independent dancer . In 1986 , after 18 years with the National Ballet , he decided to abandon both his alma_maters -- partner and company . After a brief sojourn with a lesser Cuban ensemble ( this one run_by Fernando Alonso , Alicia ' s former husband ) , he made the big break . While visiting Italy , he went_to the U.S. consulate to request asylum . The erstwhile role_model for Cuban youth opted for a precarious new life and a difficult new occupation in the dangerous world of capitalism . Now 44 , he resides in San Francisco and works quietly for the San Francisco Ballet , which he first joined in January , 1993 . When he isn ' t teaching classes , he performs character roles . The noble Siegfried has become the evil Rothbart . When Helgi Tomasson ' s San Franciscans bring &quot; Romeo and Juliet &quot; south to the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion from Nov . 30 to Dec . 4 , Esquivel will appear as the menacing Tybalt . In his prime , he could have been an ideal Romeo . Sadly , those days are over . Esquivel may harbor regrets about the limitations and detours of his career , but he refuses to admit them . During a conversation in the lavish offices of the San Francisco Ballet , he remains steadfastly philosophical about the past and bravely optimistic about the future . He answers questions with humor and self-deprecating candor , sometimes in halting English and sometimes in the rapidly tumbling sentences of Cuban-flavored Spanish . Antonio Castilla , a principal dancer from Madrid and fellow teacher , generously volunteers to serve as interpreter . Somehow Esquivel isn ' t prepared_for the inevitable first question : Why did he leave the National Ballet of Cuba ? &quot; Bueno , &quot; he pauses . &quot; Why ? I don ' t know. &quot; Of course , he does know . &quot; I had been there so many years . I needed to be free , and I was tired . For seven months I didn ' t dance at all . Then I wanted to do more , to do different things . I knew that I didn ' t have much time. &quot; He made a lot of guest appearances -- in Buenos Aires , in Perm , in Brazil , in Italy . He danced with diverse divas -- Ghislaine Thesmar , Eva Evdokimova , Cynthia Gregory and Carla Fracci ( all , incidentally , older_women , but none as old as Alicia Alonso , who was born in 1921 ) . Significantly , he had turned_down an offer from Lucia Chase to join American Ballet Theatre years earlier . &quot; I was not ready then , &quot; he explains . &quot; I had a wife and young daughter . I felt I could not leave the country and the company that had given me everything . It would have caused too_much pain. &quot; He acknowledges basic , ultimately fragile loyalties . &quot; I would not have been anybody without Alicia and without the revolution . I knew that , and I knew what ballet meant to everyone in my country . It was not the time to think_of leaving. &quot; In the interim , the declining political and economic fortunes of Cuba have taken a drastic toll on the National Ballet . Esquivel ' s marriage has been dissolved , and his daughter is virtually an adult . &quot; Now everything is different , &quot; he says . &quot; My daughter is 18 . I haven ' t seen her for two years , but it isn ' t so bad . We can talk on the phone , and I know the situation in Cuba will change. &quot; Obviously , he is not here with his country ' s blessings , or with those of Alicia Alonso . &quot; I still have many relatives in Cuba -- brothers , sisters , uncles . . . I ' d love to see them , &quot; he adds . &quot; But if I were to go_back , the people in_charge would cut my head off. &quot; He laughs . Nervously . &quot; I have decorations from Castro and from the ministry of culture . They must regard me as a traitor . My decision to leave was motivated by artistic , not political , reasons , but that would n ' t make any difference. &quot; And Alicia Alonso ? &quot; that ' s even worse . She would not speak_to me . In her eyes , I now am a dead_person . She thinks I have betrayed a trust , betrayed her , betrayed the company and the country too . There ' s no way she can understand . It makes me sad . &quot; She is like a sick mother . She gave me life , in a sense , and she thinks I belong_to her . &quot; It is the same with Castro . The revolution was great , but the world is changing . Some people cannot comprehend the change. &quot; It could not have been easy to dance with a partner who was 29 years older and afflicted with severe vision problems . &quot; It was difficult in the beginning , &quot; Esquivel admits , &quot; but I got used to it . I danced with Alicia for 14 years . That is longer than any other partner she had . ( Igor ) Youskevich danced with her for only 10 years . She was a genius . There is no question of that . I knew the difference when I danced with other ballerinas in the company. &quot; He becomes agitated when asked about current conditions in Cuba . &quot; The Ballet Nacional was one of the best companies in the world , and it can still produce wonderful dancers . The men are especially good . Castro wanted the men to symbolize everything proud and noble in Cuba . When boys were chosen for the school , they could not be weak . They had to represent the country , Castro , the revolution . &quot; But these are bad times . The government needs money . Many have left. &quot; He claims that he feels no disappointment regarding his new career . &quot; I did not come here with great expectations , &quot; he says . &quot; It was too late for that. &quot; Was it difficult to give_up his heroic roles ? &quot; No , &quot; he declares , almost defiantly . Doesn ' t he miss Siegfried and Albrecht and all those lofty princes ? &quot; Yes . But one has to know oneself . One has to know what one can do . Destiny has made me Tebaldo ( Tybalt ) now , and I will be the best Tebaldo I can be . &quot; I must give 100 % . For me there never has been another way. &quot; Esquivel doesn ' t pretend that the downward switch in repertory poses no problems . &quot; If one doesn ' t understand the situation , &quot; he admits in matter-of-fact tones , &quot; the pain can be great. &quot; He says he finds comfort in San Francisco . &quot; In Cuba I didn ' t just dance in wonderful theaters . I also danced in rice fields , in bull rings and on floating stages . Now I am here . It is a new life . &quot; The city is so beautiful . The company is one of the best . Helgi has been very generous . I love teaching . I cannot complain about anything. &quot; Complaining , in any case , would not seem to be Esquivel ' s forte . Modesty is his forte . He brushes_aside any suggestion that he didn ' t fulfill his potential as a universal celebrity . &quot; What is fame ? &quot; he shrugs . &quot; I had more fame than I deserved. &quot; One hopes he doesn ' t protest too much. *</TEXT>
