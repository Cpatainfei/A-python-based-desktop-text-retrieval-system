   <HEADLINE> UNION ANGRILY BREAKS OFF CONTRACT TALKS WITH MTA ; STRIKE : LABOR OFFICIALS DENOUNCE AGENCY CHIEF ' S LETTER TO MECHANICS . EMERGENCY BUS_SERVICE IS EXTENDED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The nagging transit strike that has snarled life for more_than half a_million mostly low-income Los Angeles County commuters seemed poised Friday to drag_on indefinitely after secret talks aimed at resolving the walkout collapsed in acrimony . Emergency service was extended into the weekend on six critical bus and rail_lines , the only good news for frustrated riders and transit-dependent shopping districts . But with no new negotiations scheduled , representatives for the striking mechanics abruptly broke_off talks with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , accusing the top brass of poisoning the process by going behind the union ' s back . &quot; It ' s really a tragedy , &quot; said Jim Wood , secretary-treasurer of the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor , AFL-CIO , which is participating in the negotiations . &quot; They do not want to settle this . They do not want the buses to roll. &quot; The union ' s anger was sparked by a conciliatory letter sent by MTA chief Franklin White to each of 1 # 900 striking mechanics -- part of the agency ' s campaign to bypass the unions and take its case directly to the rank_and_file . In the letter , dated July 27 , White promised employees that the agency ' s cost-cutting plans would not jeopardize their jobs . Union leaders , however , did not learn of the letter ' s contents until striking employees began calling the union office Friday morning . Finally , about 2 p.m. , the letter was faxed to union_representatives at the Burbank Airport Hilton Hotel , where negotiations with MTA representatives had been under way for five hours . Michael Bujosa , president of the Amalgamated Transit Union , said the letter was handed to him while he was eating . &quot; That was the end of lunch , &quot; he said . &quot; We were stunned. &quot; Wood , who had been told about the letter Thursday , said he assumed it was an innocuous appeal for a quick settlement . Instead , he said , he was surprised to learn that it contained &quot; specific items that were discussed in confidence &quot; at the parties ' last bargaining session -- a six-hour marathon Tuesday night . &quot; If Franklin White wants to represent mechanics , then goddammit he ought to learn how to become a diesel mechanic , give_up his $ 175 # 000-a-year job and stand_for election , &quot; said Wood , who described the letter as a breach of negotiating protocol . In a news_conference Friday evening , White said he had cleared the letter beforehand with the MTA board and its legal advisers , who told him there was nothing inappropriate about directly contacting his own employees . &quot; This is customary , &quot; said White , who took_over as MTA chief last year . &quot; The issue is not Frank White . The issue is what are we going_to do for the . . . riders in Los Angeles every day. &quot; In the two-page document , White had sought to allay striking mechanics ' fears about layoffs from subcontracting , saying that anticipated savings would make the agency financially healthier and better able to offer job security . The MTA ' s proposed contract , he wrote , &quot; provides two years of job protection , with no reduction in pay , &quot; for all union_members whose work has been subcontracted . &quot; Despite what you may have been told , I want you to know that no current ATU employee will lose his or her job , &quot; White wrote . County Supervisor Mike Antonovich , an MTA board_member , said he had read a copy of White ' s letter before it was mailed and saw no breach of confidentiality . &quot; The ATU needs to have a large dose of reality and live_in the real_world , &quot; Antonovich said . &quot; The letter was reasonable and allowed members of the union to understand the board ' s position . It took_away the rhetoric. &quot; Nick Patsaouras , an alternate MTA board_member , added : &quot; The letter is an excuse -- it ' s not a reason to walk away from the table. &quot; With the walkout now entering its sixth day , the financial impact of the strike -- both the hardships and some unexpected benefits -- is also becoming a central issue of the dispute . While strikers brace for lost wages , the walkout has bestowed a windfall on the MTA , which estimates it has saved about $ 500 # 000 each day the bus fleet has been grounded . The financially pinched agency has been forced to spend about $ 200 # 000 a day , most of it on private rental buses , but it continues to take_in about $ 700 # 000 a day in tax_revenues . Even with the large sum that MTA officials have spent on newspaper and radio ads attacking the unions , the transit agency still has reaped benefits totaling more_than $ 2 million since workers walked_off the job Monday . &quot; They ' re sitting Downtown and laughing_at us , &quot; said Darin Bailey , a striking driver , outside the MTA bus yard in South-Central Los Angeles . White , in an earlier interview , acknowledged that his agency was &quot; in the curious position of actually saving money , &quot; although he was quick to add : &quot; I hope everybody understands that we ' re not failing to agree because we want to save money. &quot; Ironically , those savings are almost as much as the MTA hopes to recoup through subcontracting and other salary cuts -- the key issues behind Los Angeles ' first transit strike in more_than a decade . Larry Zarian , MTA vice_chairman , said Friday that the agency hopes to save an estimated $ 2 million to $ 3 million a year through subcontracting , the practice of hiring less expensive private companies to perform certain tasks . The agency wants to save an additional $ 1 million , he said , by lowering the pay_for newly hired service attendants from $ 15 an hour to $ 10 . Although those cutbacks are at the core of the labor dispute , they represent only a fraction of the MTA ' s nearly $ 3-billion budget . &quot; They ' re doing this on the backs of the people -- the people who need transit , and on us , &quot; said Cecil Bard , 47 , a mechanic-machinist for the last 19 years . As he picketed outside the Highland Park bus yard , the 47-year-old father of five said his wife had already begun eliminating expensive cuts_of_meat from her supermarket trips . &quot; Yep , we ' re looking_for real deal meals , &quot; Bard said . The mechanics , who earn an average of $ 44 # 000 a year , are receiving no strike_pay from their union , whose coffers were depleted during the 1990 Greyhound strike . The MTA ' s bus and train drivers , who generally earn a bit less than the mechanics , are getting $ 8.50 a day in strike_pay from their international union . Clerks , who have joined them on the picket_line , will begin receiving $ 20 a day next week if the strike continues . &quot; I ' m calling all my bill collectors and telling them that I ' m on strike and I ' m hurting , &quot; Tim Shephard , a striking driver , said outside the South-Central bus yard on 54th Street . &quot; They don ' t care. &quot; Renee Navarre , a 40-year-old mechanic from West Covina , tried to comfort him . &quot; we ' ll just have to bunk it at each other ' s homes , &quot; said Navarre , who is considering moving_back in with her mother if the strike drags_on . Union leaders are eager to resolve the dispute before next Friday , when checks will be handed_out -- minus last week ' s wages . Charles Mosby , the assistant business manager for ATU Local 1277 , said workers are not too worried now , because they got their last paycheck July 21 . But if next Friday ' s checks come and workers are still on strike , he said , he feared their resolve might begin to slip . &quot; Our big concern is trying to get paychecks into the pockets of these individuals , &quot; Mosby said . Los Angeles ' first transit strike since 1982 began at 12:01 a.m. Monday , when the MTA ' s 1 # 900 mechanics walked_off the job . Their picket_lines have been honored by 5 # 000 drivers and clerks , crippling the nation ' s second-largest public transportation_system . By retraining veteran supervisors and contracting with private_school bus_companies , the MTA has managed to put about 20 % of its 1 # 900-bus fleet on_the_road . The result has been snarled traffic for freeway commuters and major disruptions for the legions of commuters who do not have cars . Although the MTA originally had planned to suspend service this weekend , the agency announced late Friday that it would offer limited service on several key routes in response to the concerns of Downtown merchants , especially along the Broadway corridor . Added were : Bus_Lines No . 30 on Pico Boulevard , No . 45 on Broadway , No . 21 on Wilshire Boulevard and No . 204 on Vermont Avenue , as well as rail service on the Red_Line subway and Blue Line trolley . Service will be from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. today and Sunday . Officials expect to return Monday to their weekday strike service , which includes about 30 of the MTA ' s 200 routes .
