   <HEADLINE> CAN PUBLISHING GO GLOBAL ? ; WHEN INTERNATIONAL MEDIA CONGLOMERATES BUY BOOK COMPANIES , IT IS NEITHER GOOD CULTURE NOR GOOD BUSINESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The beginning of the 1980s was a time of unprecedented book sales and extravagant talk in the publishing world . The business press and financial analysts burbled about the synergies that would result from combining books , book clubs , magazines , music , video and films all under a single corporate roof . The &quot; information revolution &quot; had arrived , and communication , so Wall_Street promoters promised , was becoming the principal human_activity . Any enterprise without a powerful communications capability would not make_it in &quot; postindustrial society. &quot; Billion of dollars were raised for the merger of Warner Communications and Time Inc. , which also owns Book-of-the-Month Club and Little , Brown , much of it by luring investors with the magic of synergy . By the end of the 1980s the production of general books of fiction and nonfiction in the United States had been substantially taken_over by the global entertainment and mass-media conglomerates . But putting books , movies , magazines and clubs under one corporate roof has produced few miracles . By and large , books have to make_it on_their_own . An order from conglomerate headquarters to its film company to make a movie of one of its literary properties that would not otherwise be selected is obviously not good business . It is not a good way to keep talented people who are employed for their intuition about what will and will not sell . In the book business , synergies have been most successful in the children ' s market . Disney ' s trade-marked characters can serve equally well in books , films , T-shirts and theme parks . Of the 10 best-selling children ' s paperbacks of 1990 , eight had &quot; Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &quot; in the title . Owning publishing properties in several countries is no different from owning other commercial operations in a variety of places , except that it encourages dreams of turning books into global products . Despite the difficulties , the need for translation being only one of them , a_few books such_as Alex Haley ' s &quot; Roots , &quot; Umberto Eco ' s &quot; The Name of the Rose , &quot; and books by John le Carre and Gabriel Garcia Marquez have sold in large quantities all_over the world . The same could have been said for &quot; Anna Karenina &quot; over a century ago , but the difference now is that global distribution is greatly speeded by co-publishing arrangements and near-simultaneous launchings in a number of countries . Danielle Steele is a prolific and successful Bertelsmann author , along with two or three other authors the closest thing to a global bestseller machine there is . But Dell , the Bertelsmann subsidiary in the United States that is her primary publisher , does not have the power to require this producer of yearly blockbusters to publish with Bertelsmann-owned presses in other countries nor to turn_over the foreign rights . She herself is a global industry , and there are many agents and publishers waiting in_line for a share . The number of manuscripts that turn_into global books is exceedingly small . Film and music can be easily marketed as global products because their chief attractions are action , sound and beat . A Pakistani audience can watch an action-packed Arnold Schwarzenegger film with Urdu subtitles and come_away with just about everything the film has to offer . The essence of a book , on the other hand , is language . A translation is a reflection of a literary_work as perceived by a translator who is usually not the author . Inevitably , a book displaying literary artistry or complex thought will be read by foreign readers as if reflected in a glass darkly . Even a brilliant translation is a different book . This reality sets limits to global marketing . Books do not travel well in their original language , unless it happens to be English , and even then only a tiny fraction of the world ' s Coke-guzzlers or Madonna fans is likely to pick it up . ( Madonna ' s &quot; Sex &quot; was launched simultaneously in five languages , but what sold the book needed no translation. ) A few books are now conceived from the start as global products . Mostly they are slices of American life written for a huge mass audience around the world , modeled on earlier blockbusters and marketed like any Hollywood fairy tale . Indeed , such books are either inspired by a film or designed to whet appetites for the major motion_picture that is soon to be . &quot; Scarlett , &quot; the sequel to Margaret Mitchell ' s &quot; Gone With the Wind , &quot; published by Time Warner ' s Warner Books , was released simultaneously in 40 countries in the fall of 1991 , but this unprecedented global launching , which resulted in phenomenal sales , was possible only because 100 million readers had already read the original and hundreds of millions more had seen the movie . Even books from Britain encounter problems in the American market , despite the common language . Occasionally , the story lines of British novels are altered to accommodate American readers . In Jeffrey Archer ' s novel &quot; First Among Equals , &quot; a tale of British politics , the book was &quot; recast &quot; for the American audience . As Joni Evans , the editor of the American edition , explained , &quot; The person who ended_up being elected prime_minister was not the same man who won in the_British version . It was all with Jeffrey ' s approval . . . . &quot; As the publishing business became more international , more and more foreign media companies considered it essential to acquire major publishing properties in the United States . It is the largest national book market in the world , college-educated , middle-class , affluent . But the U.S. market has a built-in limitation . Most Americans are not avid book readers . In 1988 , according to Jason Epstein , editorial director of Random House , Americans spent about $ 3 billion on &quot; consumer &quot; books -- about as much as they spent that year &quot; on turkeys and apples. &quot; ( According to the Economist , it was more like $ 6 billion , a discrepancy attributable to wildly different understanding of what a &quot; general fiction and non-fiction book &quot; is and to the notorious state of record-keeping in the industry. ) The Assn . of American Publishers reports that only 13 % of Americans buy books . However , what Americans read still sets fashions all_over the world . A book that is popular in the United States is likely to sell well in Europe and Japan . It rarely works the other way around . The American market is not only huge but it is , as Alberto Vitale , the head of Random House , puts it , &quot; homogeneous. &quot; Popular attitudes are more &quot; monolithic , &quot; he argues , because lifestyles are shared across class lines . The millionaire with 45 acres and the clerk with a patch of green behind his tract house both care about their gardens in the same way . This makes_it easier , he says , to sell books to a wide public . The dreams of the global media conglomerates have changed the culture of bookmaking , broadening , and frequently cheapening , the understanding of what a book is . Trade-book divisions are at the mercy of customers ' whims , changing fashions and the competition from a variety of entertainment enterprises skilled in luring prospective readers to easy listening or mindless viewing . Publishers know that Samuel Butler , the great English novelist who was not hugely popular in his day , had it right : &quot; God will not have any human_being know what will sell . Good_books in ever greater quantities are being published by the conglomerates , but they are overwhelmed by much greater quantities of ever trashier books . The danger is that because trade publishers &quot; are in the fashion_business , &quot; as Simon &amp; Schuster chairman Richard Snyder puts it , they are using their market power , whether or not they intend to do so , to reinforce orthodoxy of ideas , styles and forms at a moment in human history when new ideas and unconventional approaches are desperately needed . There is a certain irony in all this . Just as state control over the printed word appears finally to be weakening around the world , market forces are establishing their own orthodoxies , not by suppressing thought but by drowning it out . This piece is excerpted from the recently published book , &quot; Global Dreams : Imperial Corporations and the New World Order &quot; ( Simon &amp; Schuster ) , which examines the cultural impact of an increasingly global economy .</TEXT>
