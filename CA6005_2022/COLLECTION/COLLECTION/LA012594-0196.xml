   <HEADLINE> TEMBLOR IS A DOUBLE HIT FOR MANY INSURERS ; RECOVERY : BESIDES SCRAMBLING TO HANDLE CLAIMS , A NUMBER OF COMPANIES SUFFERED DAMAGE TO THEIR FACILITIES . REINSURANCE WILL CUSHION THE PAYOUT BLOW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just three months ago , 20th Century Insurance Co . was counting its blessings as it escaped the Southland wildfires with relatively few claims . But this time , the company got whacked -- and in more ways than one . On the Monday morning of the earthquake , it looked_like a bomb had exploded inside 20th Century ' s 11-story headquarters building in Woodland Hills . Roughly 100 panes_of_glass were blown_out , beige drapes hung_out windows like unmade bed_sheets , and the building was closed . By the morning after the earthquake , 20th Century ' s parking_lot had been converted into a makeshift claims center . Anxious homeowners who drove_in saw a cardboard sign that read &quot; Customers &quot; directing them to a dozen claims adjusters who sat at tables filling_in by hand claims_forms and passing_out bottled water . As soon as a form was done , it was handed to another worker who promptly faxed it to 20th Century ' s catastrophe claims office in Monrovia . The company ' s building has since reopened and as of Monday it had received more_than 15 # 000 homeowner claims , plus another 2 # 500 damage reports from car owners . 20th Century has 200 # 000 homeowner policies , with about 40 % of them carrying earthquake coverage . But the financial damage for 20th Century figures to be relatively light because its earthquake policies typically have a deductible of 10 % of a home ' s value -- excluding land costs . So payments won ' t kick_in unless damage to a home exceeds that amount . &quot; The bear didn ' t eat us on this one , but it got a good piece of our leg , &quot; said Rick Dinon , 20th Century ' s senior_vice_president . Dinon said 20th Century ' s damage claims on the 6.6-magnitude temblor will run between $ 10 million and $ 100 million , well more_than the $ 6.5 million in claims it paid_out from the 1987 Whittier quake , which measured magnitude 5.9. 20th Century wasn ' t the only insurer hit hard by the quake . Structural cracks and falling ceiling panels made Allstate ' s regional office in Woodland Hills unusable ; the company improvised by using mobile_homes as claim centers . State Farm , the state ' s largest insurer , flew agents in from out of state after 40 of its agents ' offices in the San Fernando Valley were damaged . And Farmers Insurance ' s five-story regional facility in Simi Valley had yellow tape around it all last week . &quot; We ' re still not sure of the level of damage to that building , &quot; said Farmers ' spokesman Jeff Beyer . But the building has been cleared by safety inspectors , he said , and most of the 1 # 000-plus employees returned to their jobs Monday . Last week the company established a 24-hour claims center in Pasadena . Farmers and other insurers wanted to be seen as providing rapid service , especially to people such_as state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi , who has been very critical of the industry . Financially , insurers face proportionately larger losses than they did_in the Bay Area ' s Loma Prieta quake in 1989 , because about 40 % of Southern California homeowners have earthquake insurance , contrasted with about 25 % for the rest of the state , said Steve Goldstein , a spokesman for the Insurance Information Institute , a trade group in New York . Goldstein estimated that total insured losses from the Northridge quake will be about $ 1.5 billion -- 50 % more_than the Loma Prieta quake . Few homeowners buy earthquake coverage because it generally doubles their insurance_premium and carries that hefty 10 % deductible . Also , some homeowner policies have smaller , but separate deductibles , for content losses . ( Comprehensive auto insurance includes quake damage. ) For homeowners in Southern California , quake insurance costs $ 2 per $ 1 # 000 of coverage , Goldstein said . With the average price of a house in the San Fernando Valley at about $ 253 # 000 , the typical homeowner who has full quake coverage would have to pay out-of-pocket the first $ 25 # 300 of damages before the earthquake insurance kicked_in . More_than 70 # 000 loss reports have been filed so far , and the destruction of insurance_company offices and the lingering aftershocks have made_it hard for claims adjusters and engineers to enter homes . That means a potentially long wait for those filing claims . On the morning after the earthquake , 20th Century ' s chief_executive , Neil H . Ashley , dressed in jeans , a plaid shirt and a baseball_cap , hiked_up to the seventh floor of his scarred building . The place was still closed , save for a_few workers inside . The elevators , computers and electricity were out , plaster dusted the floors , cracks marred the walls , and notes were taped to doors telling repair crews where other people were . &quot; We ' ve been giving_out additional living-expense checks right out there in the parking_lot &quot; for the worst claims , Ashley said , as aftershocks kept wobbling the building . One of those waiting in 20th Century ' s parking_lot claims line was Greg Maksimenko of Chatsworth . He had earthquake insurance . He also used to have a block wall running_around his property , but the wall had caved_in . &quot; There are six neighbors who are sharing a common yard now , &quot; he said , wondering aloud : &quot; Is that wall part of the structural policy or not ? Guess I ' ll find out. &quot; But many who filed claims a week ago are still waiting for a visit from a 20th Century appraiser , because the insurer is handling claims in the usual triage-like manner , with the worst cases getting first attention . &quot; We ' re prioritizing the claims . On the worst cases , we ' re responding if possible on the same day , &quot; Dinon said . For some insurance_companies , the financial blow from the earthquake will be softened by catastrophe reinsurance , which insurers buy to spread their own risk . But those big earthquake insurance deductibles are tough on both homeowners and on insurance_companies . Consider that 20th Century ' s Lloyd ' s of London earthquake reinsurance policy costs it $ 13 million in annual premiums , and before Lloyd ' s pays_out its first farthing , 20th Century has to pay_out $ 10 million in claims -- in_effect a deductible . Only then does Lloyd ' s pay 75 % of additional claims -- up_to a maximum of $ 75 million -- with 20th Century paying the rest . Which means that if 20th Century reaches the maximum of its earthquake policy it must first pay $ 48 million in premiums , deductibles and co-payments just to get $ 75 million in coverage from Lloyd ' s -- or roughly $ 1.50 back for every $ 1 spent for earthquake reinsurance . &quot; That isn ' t particularly generous , &quot; Dinon said , &quot; But earthquake reinsurance premiums are kind of supply and demand. &quot; His company ' s tab for earthquake reinsurance almost doubled in its latest policy , Dinon said , because of &quot; storms in Europe , Hurricane Andrew and worldwide catastrophe losses. &quot; Certainly the bad news from Northridge made its way to London in a hurry . Lloyd ' s of London is already struggling with years of heavy claims : In the most recent report available , Lloyd ' s in 1990 posted a record loss of 2.9 million British_pounds , or about $ 4.3 billion . For most companies , however , reinsurance won ' t help nearly as much in the past because the spate of major disasters in recent years , including the Los Angeles riots and the recent wildfires , has caused the cost of reinsurance to skyrocket . Big firms such_as State Farm don ' t even buy reinsurance , and for them the financial effect of the Northridge earthquake will be relatively modest . But the quake will have a big impact on small insurers such_as Associated International Insurance Co . The tiny Woodland Hills-based company specializes in selling quake coverage to business owners , who , because of the cost , are even less likely to buy catastrophe insurance than homeowners . ( Unlike homeowner ' s insurance , earthquake coverage for businesses must be sold as a separate policy. ) Formed in 1972 , a year after the devastating Sylmar quake , Associated has 50 employees and about 3 # 000 policyholders . In its latest report filed with the state , Associated earned a handsome profit of $ 6.3 million in 1992 on premium revenue of $ 43 million . It currently has an &quot; A &quot; or excellent rating from A . M . Best . But that rating is in jeopardy . Matthew Peller , a senior_vice_president , said he expects the Northridge quake to hit his company with about $ 30 million in claims . Two of Associated ' s customers are Rocketdyne in Canoga Park , and Northridge Fashion Center . Both facilities sustained heavy damage from the quake . At the Northridge mall , the parking garage caved_in and the Bullock ' s department_store has been condemned . &quot; The phone has been ringing constantly , &quot; Peller said . A bit frantically , he added last week : &quot; We ' re working with a short staff , we ' re having aftershocks , things are falling_out of the ceiling. &quot; Reinsurance through Lloyd ' s and other firms in Europe and Bermuda will significantly cut Associated ' s losses , just as it did after the Loma Prieta quake in 1989 , when Associated reported a gross loss of $ 32 million but a net loss of only $ 2.2 million after reinsurance payments . But Peller suggested that last week ' s quake will probably be more costly to Associated because of the dramatic increase in reinsurance rates since then . Jack Graham , executive_vice_president at E . W . Blanch Co. , a reinsurance broker in San Francisco , said the onslaught of disasters in recent years has basically doubled catastrophe reinsurance premiums in 1993 from 1990 . Insurance_firms now pay about 30 cents in reinsurance premiums to get_back $ 1 , Graham said . But premiums are not expected to increase because of the latest quake , he said , because eight new reinsurance companies were formed last year in Bermuda , where tax_rates are favorable , thus greatly adding_to the supply of reinsurance . Despite the magnitude of last week ' s earthquake , 20th Century figures to have plenty of money to cover its claims . The company has a $ 600-million capital surplus , Dinon said , and it posted an $ 89.8-million profit on revenues of $ 817.3 million for the nine months that ended Sept . 30 . Among insurers that escaped with relatively few claims was TIG Insurance in Woodland Hills , formerly known as Transamerica Insurance Group . Its latest tally was just 700 quake claims , said spokeswoman Cheryl Friedling . But the company ' s parking_lot is unusable , and one of TIG ' s buildings in Woodland Hills sustained &quot; significant structural damage , &quot; forcing the company to transfer dozens of workers elsewhere , Friedling said . Another insurer that escaped with few claims was Unico American in Woodland Hills . Through its Crusader Insurance subsidiary , Unico insures about 2 # 200 mom-and-pop businesses in the Valley area , but it does not offer earthquake insurance . Unico also has about 200 homeowner policies , but only 16 of them included earthquake coverage . As such , Unico says it expects just a handful of claims and minimal losses . But Unico ' s headquarters ' building wasn ' t so fortunate . Cary Cheldin , Unico ' s executive_vice_president and son of the company ' s founder , Erwin Cheldin , arrived_at 6 a.m. on the morning of the quake , carrying a flashlight . The building ' s air conditioning and heating equipment was knocked loose , he said . Fallen ceiling tiles were everywhere . File_cabinets were overturned by the jolt , and about 100 computer terminals and 100 typewriters had fallen from desks . Cheldin spent most of last week cleaning_up and , until the plumbing was fixed , he and other Unico executives made frequent trips to a creek behind the building for pails of water so the toilets could be manually flushed . Cheldin said there was no structural damage to the building , but Unico still expects to have big repair bills . Cheldin said Unico has a $ 9-million earthquake policy for the building through Associated International , for which Unico pays $ 20 # 000 annually . But that policy came_with a 5 % deductible , so Unico must pay the first $ 450 # 000 in damage . &quot; We put Associated on notice , &quot; Cheldin said . &quot; But odds are whatever losses we have are under that deductible. &quot;</TEXT>
