   <HEADLINE> LIFE WILL GO_ON , BUT MAYBE NOT AT BIG A ; BASEBALL : FANS , PLAYERS AND STADIUM WORKERS ARE ALL MAKING STRIKE PLANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fishing reels were oiled , hunting rifles cleaned , jet skis tuned and airline tickets for home nestled in the pockets of shirts hung next to neat , white uniforms in the clubhouse . Major_league baseball_players are set to go_on strike Friday , so Wednesday night ' s meeting between the Angels and the Kansas City Royals might end_up being the last big_league baseball_game of the summer at Anaheim Stadium . If it ' s spitting , scratching and cussing you crave , you ' ll probably have to settle for &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; for a while . There were few outward signs that this game -- won by the Angels , 2-1 -- was different from any other . The announced crowd of 19 # 605 was typical for midweek . A few disgruntled fans displayed signs -- &quot; Mom , Send Money to the Pension_Fund . . . DON ' T STRIKE ! &quot; read one -- but most in_attendance were anything but morose . &quot; It ' s a bummer , &quot; said Lanette Larson of Brea , her Angel cap worn backward , either as a fashion statement or a form of protest . &quot; But we ' ll get_by . There are lots of other things to do . Dude , this is Southern California , and it ' s summertime. &quot; But there are still baseball purists , those who hang onto nostalgic notions of the game , who are revived by the smell of hot dogs , peanuts , even stale beer , who have only hostile feelings for the millionaires ' club deciding the future of their beloved national pastime . &quot; I have only one word to say about both sides of this strike , &quot; a professorial looking man interjected into a discussion in front of the stadium . &quot; Selfish . . . &quot; Actually , there were two words . One unprintable . The 1994 season , born so full of potential and promise , might indeed be going_up in the smoke of an unlucky strike . Clearly , it would be an unfortunate work_stoppage for a number of big swingers such_as San Francisco ' s Matt Williams , who is in hot pursuit of New York Yankee Roger Maris ' most-coveted record for home_runs in a season , 61 in 1961 . Williams is_on a pace to hit 61 , and the only strike he wants to see is belt high and over the middle of the plate . While it might go_down in baseball lore as the Season That Might Have Been , 1994 has already lost much of its luster for the Angels . Owners of the worst record in the American League , they have lost 14 of their last 19 games . In the past week alone , they have lost three times in extra innings . Futility seems to stalk them at every turn . So maybe it ' s no surprise that talk in the Angel clubhouse has turned_to which personal watercraft have the most power and which lures are sure to attract the biggest largemouth_bass . Not everyone is consumed only by visions of unexpected vacations , though . &quot; When I think_about the fans , I feel the kind of heartache you feel when your first girlfriend dumps you , &quot; said utility player Rex Hudler , who played professional_baseball in Japan last year , signed with the Angels during spring_training and has been a source of bubbling optimism ever since . &quot; They ' re the innocent victims in this . &quot; I certainly don ' t feel sorry_for me . I feel sorry_for the vendor who ' s working a second job to earn the money for his little summer vacation . But it ' s something I can ' t control . Now , if I could get the owners to name me the commissioner of baseball , I ' d have this thing settled in a heartbeat. &quot; A players union strike in 1981 lasted 50 days , although it ended in time for the season to resume in August . In 1985 , a strike lasted just one day . Most feel this one won ' t be settled quickly . Union head Donald Fehr said after Wednesday ' s negotiating session broke_up early that &quot; there ' s no sense in having a meeting just to have a meeting. &quot; &quot; If there ' s nothing substantive , &quot; he said , &quot; we all have better things to do. &quot; That sentiment was clearly the most popular theme Wednesday night around the Big A . While some worried about the financial hardships that loomed , many were busy making plans for the time_off . Keith Tarter , a 21-year-old clubhouse attendant from Anaheim who attends Fullerton College in the off-season , isn ' t fretting about the loss of his sole source of income . &quot; I ' ve got a little money saved , and as long as I don ' t get_in any car wrecks and my insurance_premiums don ' t go_up , I ' ll be all_right , &quot; he said , smiling . &quot; If it lasts too_much longer than that , I ' ll get another job . No big deal . &quot; But I think it might last awhile . There ' s a weird feeling around here . It ' s like the last_day of school . I keep waiting for the cupcakes and the class party to start. &quot; Debbie Engel , lobby director at Anaheim Stadium , says she is actually looking_forward to a short strike . &quot; I ' ve got a whole list of things to do , &quot; she said . &quot; Two or three weeks would be perfect . I also have a full-time job , so the only thing it really affects with me is how many concerts I go_to . And I need a break . I need the rest. &quot; There will be little rest for those so weary of losing , however . Said Tim Mead , Angel assistant general_manager : &quot; Don ' t laugh , but we need to look_at what didn ' t go right and why . There ' s a reason for everything that ' s happened on the field this year. &quot; Manager Marcel Lachemann will also be using his time in the strike zone to search for clues . Answers might be too_much to ask_for . &quot; For the first couple of days , I ' m going_to try and get more organized , &quot; said Lachemann , who took_over after Buck Rodgers was fired in May . &quot; I want to break_down the roster , see where everyone is and what we can do to help them improve . Then I ' ll have the coaches do the same sort of evaluation on each player in their area . &quot; It ' s easy to say we need this and we need that , but it isn ' t that easy to get those players . So you ' d better figure_out the best you can do with what you have . There are a lot of things that can be done , but as much as the time can be used effectively , I think playing games would be much more valuable. &quot; So does Hudler , who loves to play so_much he ' s starting to envy those he left_behind in Japan . &quot; I ' ve got_to call my buddy ( former Angel ) Jack Howell and tip my hat to him . He decided to stay another year over there because of the possibility of the strike . Looks_like a good call now. &quot; Shortstop Gary DiSarcina , who is convinced that a strike is the only way to get the owners to negotiate in good_faith , acknowledged that he was suffering from a bout of melancholy before taking_the_field for what could be the final time of the year . &quot; When you know the issues , when you know what ' s really going_on , it makes_it easier to make_peace with yourself , &quot; he said . &quot; But it is too early for the season to end . This isn ' t October , it ' s August , when kids like to come_to the park . &quot; This strike will cost me money . It will cost the fans games . It ' s going_to make a lot of people angry , and ( the players ) aren ' t going_to get a lot of sympathy . But it ' s something we have to stand_up for , even if a lot of people lose. &quot; Not taking into consideration the money they ' d save from unpaid player salaries , club officials figure the Angels will lose about $ 160 # 000 for each of the 21 home_games that could be wiped_out , beginning Aug . 23 when the Angels are scheduled to play host to Milwaukee . The city of Anaheim will lose an estimated $ 61 # 000 in stadium revenue per game . Workers in the concession stands said they will lose about $ 1 # 500 if the strike wipes_out the rest of the season . Elaine Hayes , who has worked in a souvenir stand near Gate 3 for 15 years , says she will be out between $ 67 and $ 100 in salary and commission every game , although &quot; $ 100 is a high , and we haven ' t had too many highs around here lately. &quot; &quot; I use the money to buy books , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' m studying respiratory therapy at Orange Coast College . Pretty soon I ' ll be working_at a hospital and won ' t have to put_up with this stuff . But , you know , I ' ll probably keep working here because there ' s no stress , and I like meeting the people. &quot; Someone asked Hayes the price of a custom-size Angel cap . &quot; Only the players can afford this kind , they ' re $ 25 , &quot; she said . &quot; Well , they ' re $ 25 now . Who knows what they ' ll be_after the strike . The fans always pay in the end. &quot; RELATED STORY : A27</TEXT>
