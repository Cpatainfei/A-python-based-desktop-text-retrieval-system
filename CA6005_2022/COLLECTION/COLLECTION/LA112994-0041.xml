   <HEADLINE> THE ASIA BOOM ; CHINA SETS THE PACE AS CASH , CONCRETE POUR INTO WORLD ' S HOTTEST ECONOMIC REGION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In times past , Asian business people could judge the outlook for their own companies by watching the economy of the United States , their biggest export market . More recently , they watched Japan . Now , a third locomotive of growth has burst_forth on the Asian scene . &quot; China has become an engine , and the principal one for the Pacific region , &quot; Lawrence Krause , a professor at the University of California , San Diego , wrote in the annual prospectus of the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council . Exports to China now play &quot; a large part in forecasts for continued growth &quot; of many Asian_countries , the professor explained . Although Western economists are just beginning to take_notice , Asian businesses , even countries , are finding their fortunes increasingly linked with the soaring growth of the mainland giant , now in its third straight year of double-digit expansion . For instance , Charoen Pokphand , Thailand ' s biggest conglomerate , popularly known as the CP Group , already does half its business in China and expects that from now on more_than 50 % of its revenues and the bulk of its growth will come from China . &quot; New opportunities are available in China that are not available in Thailand , &quot; Boonmee Chongpison , assistant senior_vice_president of CP Petrochemical Co. , explained in his Bangkok office . In Japan , Mabuchi Motors , one of the world ' s largest manufacturers of miniature motors used in electronic_devices in automobiles , appliances , cameras and toys , is about to become one of the first Japanese manufacturing firms to dismantle all_of its factories at_home . It has tied its future , indeed its survival , to China , where 80 % of its production is now being carried_out . After the firm closes its last machinery factory in Japan early next year , only 1 # 000 of Mabuchi ' s 39 # 000 employees will remain in Japan -- in headquarters and research and development jobs . The Daewoo Group of South_Korea has set_up 11 joint_ventures in China in the past two years . By the year 2000 , it expects to operate as_many as 50 firms there , doing about $ 3 billion worth of business , about half in automobiles , according to Sah Jae Chul , a managing director of Daewoo Corp . Lee Kuan Yew , Singapore ' s senior minister , says some Asian_nations will find their annual gross_national_products increased by up_to 1 % because of China ' s growth . The U.S. market still takes between one-fifth and one-third of each Asian_country ' s global exports . In the 1970s , a 1 % increase in the U.S. economy raised Asian GNPs by the same percentage . But now a 1 % American increase produces only one-fifth of that level in Asian growth , a reflection of relative decline in economic influence , says Kwan Chi-hung of Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo . Neither a U.S. recession , nor a setback in Japan , nor a two-year plunge in Japanese foreign investment -- Asia ' s second engine of growth -- thwarted robust growth in Asia in the early 1990s . Economists failed to predict or even explain the phenomenon , Kwan pointed_out . &quot; The majority view persists that , when the United States sneezes , Asia catches a cold . . . . Economists still focus_on the U.S. growth_rate when projecting growth in Asia , &quot; Kwan explained . What they overlook include these developments : * China not only has become a &quot; giant industrial_park &quot; in which other Asians produce for export to third countries , it also is emerging as a new market itself , increasing intra-Asia trade . * The peripheries of &quot; Greater China &quot; -- Taiwan , Hong Kong and Chinese living in Southeast Asian_countries -- have led the boom in investing in China but are now being joined by other Asian_nations . * Foreign construction companies are playing a major role in developing China ' s infrastructure . Meanwhile , Southeast Asian_nations , fearing that China ' s boom might lure investors away from them , have begun to work_on bottlenecks in their own infrastructures , triggering an Asia-wide spree of spending on telephones , roads , bridges , ports , airports , power_plants , waterworks and sewers . * Despite a decline in foreign investment in Southeast_Asia , all Asian_countries this year are revising upward their initial estimates for growth . Over the horizon , as China moves from economic_growth to economic clout , the potential for new problems is immense . Nomura ' s Kwan mentioned some of them : Will China ' s demands strain the global supply of capital ? Will its coal-burning power_plants destroy the environment ? What about the global supply of raw_materials , especially oil ? Can intense trade friction with the United States and other developed nations be avoided ? Will the future economic giant turn_into a military superpower ? But for the moment the focus is_on the present , and superlatives abound everywhere in Asia . &quot; China is going_to be the biggest trading nation in the world , &quot; said a U.S. diplomat in Bangkok . &quot; The course ( China ) is taking will make_it one of the greatest nations on Earth within the next two decades , &quot; said Robert Kuok Hock Nien , a Malaysian Chinese tycoon based in Hong Kong , who himself is one of the leading investors in China . &quot; China is like a plane taking_off . We have the wind under our wings . Let ' s fly ! &quot; Zhu Xiao Hua , a deputy governor of China ' s central_bank , said in an interview with the German newspaper Handelsblatt . Lee ' s prediction about GNPs has already come true in Hong Kong and Taiwan . Hong Kong ' s manufacturing-on-license in China accounts_for about 2 % of the_British colony ' s 7 % annual growth in estimated GNP , according to Kwan . Taiwan , he added , obtains about 1 % of its 6 % yearly growth from its factories in China . Even countries that now have little trade with China expect to feel China ' s impact in the future . Thailand , which fueled its emergence as an industrializing nation by selling cheap-labor products in markets that China is now penetrating , expects an incremental addition from China ' s boom to appear in its GNP in about 10 years , Vasim Teeravcchyan , deputy director of the East Asia Department of the Thai Foreign Ministry , said in Bangkok . Syed Jaafar Aznan , deputy secretary_general of Malaysia ' s International Trade and Industry Ministry , agreed that &quot; China will complement growth &quot; for members of the Assn . of Southeast Asian_Nations ( ASEAN ) -- and will be an engine of a different color than Japan . &quot; Japanese just buy Japanese products . But China is different . We can sell there , &quot; Aznan said . South_Korea , which lacked even diplomatic relations with Beijing until two years ago , expects China to surpass Japan and replace the United States as the nation ' s No . 1 export market . Kim Do Kyoung of Lucky-Goldstar Economic Research Institute foresees that epochal event -- for Korea -- within 10 years . Kim Dong Yong of the government ' s Ministry of Trade , Industry and Energy sees it coming_by 2010 . The same shift could even occur in Japan . &quot; The United States absorbs about 30 % of Japanese exports , China only 5 % . But by 2000 , the United States will be down to 20 % , China maybe 12 % to 13 % , &quot; Nomura analyst Kwan said . Kenji Miyahara , senior managing director of Sumitomo Corp. , dismissed as &quot; excessive &quot; a Chinese forecast for a tenfold increase in Japan-China trade , to $ 390 billion , by 2004 . &quot; But trade probably will increase by five times in 10 years , &quot; to about $ 200 billion , exceeding the 1993 two-way Japan-U.S. trade , he predicted . Eventually , Japan-China trade will surpass Japan-U.S. trade , he added . Trade between Taiwan and the mainland topped $ 10 billion in 1993 , up from $ 7.5 billion in 1992 . In 1992 alone , Taiwan businesses contracted to invest $ 5.5 billion in China , according to the Nomura Research Institute . Engineering and construction firms from Singapore , which established diplomatic relations with China just four years ago , have found a new boom market in China building about a dozen &quot; industrial parks. &quot; One of them will be a 27-square-mile city designed to attract $ 20 billion in investment and create a &quot; mini-Singapore &quot; in Suzhou , west of Shanghai . The development spree has sent Singapore soaring_up the list of China investors to fifth place , with $ 6.5 billion in commitments . China has eaten_into export market shares of nearly every country in Asia in textile garments and cheap electronics products . Shoes once made in South_Korea and Taiwan are now practically all made in China . More_than 60 % of all toys in the world , accounting_for $ 9 billion in trade , are made in China . Yet no Asian_nation has suffered any loss in GNP growth this year . South_Korea , which grew 5.5 % in 1993 , is heading toward 8 % . Thailand and Malaysia both expect to continue about 8 % growth at least for the next five years . Even the Philippines is moving_up . So far , negatives produced by China ' s emergence have been matched , or exceeded , by positives . What South_Korea has lost in apparel exports it has gained in overseas sales , especially to China , of textile raw_materials and polyester fabrics . Meanwhile , China has become a new Korean market for exports of heavy industry goods , including whole plants , machinery and cars . Worries about China grabbing away foreign investment have had a boomerang effect , inducing such countries as Indonesia and the Philippines to adopt more favorable terms for foreign investment . The result in Indonesia was a 2.8-fold jump in Japanese investment in the first_half of this year ; in the Philippines , a 5.6-fold spurt . And according to the U.S. diplomat in Bangkok , ASEAN is finally getting serious about lowering tariffs and trade_barriers among its six members -- raising hopes for the emergence of yet another engine of growth for the region . Despite the boom , optimism is restrained in some quarters , even toward business in China . Although growth there is being spurred by foreign investment , Asians say that China does not offer a first-rate environment . &quot; We don ' t see much of an advantage in China ' s low wages . Productivity is very low . Infrastructure is a big problem . Inflation is rising in the coastal areas . Management , engineers and skilled labor all will have to be sent_in at the beginning of operations , &quot; said Koo Ja Il , director of the China division of Daewoo Corp. , echoing Asia-wide complaints . Then , too , there are defects in China ' s legal and financial systems , worries about exchange_rates and bureaucratic red_tape . Beyond the pan-Asia boom it is stirring , China could serve as an even more powerful engine for growth if it eliminated high tariffs and other import_barriers and allowed private ownership of its own enterprises , says Staporn Kavitanon , who heads Thailand ' s Board of Investment . China , he said , &quot; is a gold mine for those who can penetrate the domestic market and for those who can tap its natural_resources . But for others trying to export their products , it ' s still a closed market. &quot; Still , for the droves rushing in , the lure of the market of 1.2 billion people , and the fact that since 1992 China has extended its &quot; open_door &quot; policy beyond its special economic zones and beyond export-only production , overpowers the drawbacks . &quot; Indeed , China is already the largest market for certain industries , such_as telecommunications and aerospace , &quot; the International Monetary Fund noted in September in its semiannual report . Mabuchi won the right to sell only 10 % of its production in China when it started building its first factory in Dalian in 1987 , but it was permitted to sell 50 % of production in China at a plant it opened near Shanghai in July . Distribution and retailing sectors were opened just two years ago , and the Japanese leaped at the opportunity . Yaohan , a small regional supermarket chain that moved its corporate headquarters to Hong Kong in 1989 , already has started building a chain of stores in China and declares that its goal is to open 1 # 000 outlets . One leading Japanese department_store operating in Shanghai , where the per capita annual income has reached $ 1 # 500 , sells its goods at prices higher than in Japan , according to Shinichi Sakakibara , China manager for Sumitomo Corp. , a giant trading company . Wacoal , a high-fashion women ' s undergarment manufacturer , also is doing_well in China , he added . &quot; Women start wearing brassieres when per capita income exceeds $ 1 # 000 , &quot; Sakakibara said . China ' s announcement that it would allow new foreign entrants into automobile manufacturing in 1996 sent a stampede of auto executives from Japan , South_Korea and Malaysia -- not to mention the United States and Europe -- rushing to Beijing . Permission for foreign investment in infrastructure -- on which the U.S. Commerce_Department estimates China will spend up_to $ 200 billion in the next five years -- has produced so many proposals that there is a gridlock in approving them . Even so , China emerged this year as the No . 1 market for overseas construction by firms from South_Korea , which used to do most of their overseas business in the Middle_East . Contract signings have been running at an annual rate of $ 1 billion . Although it started doing business in China in late 1992 , the Berjaya Group of Malaysia won bidding to build a $ 443-million bridge across the Yangtze_River at Nanjing and will soon sign a contract for the job , said Judy Tan , director of the conglomerate ' s investor relations . &quot; It is one of the largest infrastructure projects in China , &quot; she said . CP Group , which entered China in 1979 with its modern animal-feed mills and automated chicken farms , is now engaged in business in China that it never ventured into in Thailand : producing motorcycles , brewing beer , developing a $ 2-billion satellite town across the river from the Shanghai Bund and , most recently , joining Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in a joint_venture to enter the &quot; warehouse store &quot; business popular in the United States . Mabuchi also is charting astronomical leaps for its new plant : production of 3 million miniature motors this year , 40 million next year and 75 million in 1996 . And &quot; we already are planning to expand production beyond that level , &quot; Tsutomu Takahashi , the company ' s planning manager , said in Matsudo , Japan . Nimit Nontapunthawat , executive_vice_president of Bangkok Bank , said Thai companies have invested $ 4.5 billion in China -- the bulk of it in the past two years . Somkiat Osotsapa , a professor and director of the Indochina and Southwest China Program at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok , predicted that , by the turn_of_the_century , Thai firms will have invested about $ 10 billion more in China , bringing the total to about $ 15 billion . Moreover , countless newcomers are joining the wave . Half of the 400 firms listed on the Bangkok Stock_Exchange now operate joint_ventures in China , Somkiat said . About 50 Malaysian firms now operate in China or plan to invest there soon , Zainal Azam Yusof , adviser to the Malaysian central_bank , said in Kuala Lumpur . &quot; From traditionally labor-intensive to relatively high-tech industries -- in all cases -- Japanese companies have voted China as the most popular destination for investment , &quot; Nomura ' s Kwan said . The Samsung Group in South_Korea this month announced plans to invest $ 3 billion over the next 20 years to build an electronics complex in China -- an amount twice as large as all_of the investment South_Korea had made in China through last year . For nearly everyone , the boom in China is beginning to look_like a gold_rush . Chinese are sending city and provincial missions all_over Asia . More_than 200 have visited Thailand in the past few years , said Staporn , the Board of Investment chief . &quot; To this office alone , 150 delegations have come seeking advice and know-how in promoting foreign investment , &quot; he added . Just this month , Li Peng , on the first visit to South_Korea by a Chinese prime_minister , signed agreements for the two nations to cooperate in research and development of aircraft , automobiles , high-definition TV , digital telephone_exchanges and nuclear_power -- giving Seoul a foot in the door in joining construction of as_many as 30 nuclear plants that China plans by 2010 . CP Group is expanding so fast that its executives insist they don ' t know the current number of projects that the Thai conglomerate operates in China . &quot; I think I can say that we have somewhere between 130 and 170 projects , &quot; Eam Ngamdamronk , president of CP Standard Resources Co. , said with a straight_face . Phiraboon Phaiboontham , his executive assistant , tried to explain by telling of a river cruise that CP Group ' s chairman , Dhanin Chearavanont , took at the invitation of Chinese authorities during a recent visit there . The cruise lasted 10 days , and by the time it ended , &quot; our chairman had signed 50 memoranda of understanding , &quot; or MOUs , in business parlance . &quot; An MOU is not an IOU , &quot; added Phornsin Phacharintanakul , president of CP Intertrade Co . But an MOU does lock_in a project until a feasibility study can be done . In Kuala Lumpur , Tan of the Berjaya Group noted that &quot; the important thing is to grab the project first. &quot; Times staff writer Rone Tempest in Beijing contributed to this report .
