   <HEADLINE> TOT ' S KILLER GETS LONG PRISON_TERM ; COURT : WAYNE YOSHISATO WILL NOT BE ELIGIBLE FOR PAROLE FOR AT LEAST 30 YEARS . HE MURDERED HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND ' S DAUGHTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Huntington Beach laborer was sentenced to 53 years to life in prison Friday for sexually assaulting and beating to death his former girlfriend ' s 14-month-old daughter . Orange County Superior_Court Judge William Froeberg handed_down the sentence during an emotional hearing packed with relatives and friends of the girl and the man convicted of killing her , 31-year-old Wayne Yoshisato . The toddler ' s uncle tearfully asked the judge for the maximum sentence for the death of Felicia Lynn Grunbaum . &quot; My brother and our family will never be able to cherish those special occasions or moments that would have occurred during Felicia ' s life , &quot; said Richard Grunbaum , a captain with the Huntington Beach Fire_Department . &quot; Her first day in kindergarten , her first school play . . . her high_school prom , her graduation , her wedding day. &quot; The speech caused Felicia ' s mother , Pepper Purvis , to run from the courtroom sobbing . Felicia ' s father , 29-year-old Steven Grunbaum who is divorced from Purvis , said afterward that his daughter ' s death is a warning to all parents to be constantly vigilant . &quot; If I had been , we would n ' t be here today , and I would n ' t have gone_to my first funeral , &quot; Steven Grunbaum said . &quot; I tell parents now to hold onto their children and to hold onto them forever. &quot; The judge said Yoshisato ' s actions showed a &quot; high degree of cruelty , viciousness , and callousness. &quot; Froeberg said medical evidence showed that Felicia was beaten and sexually assaulted at least twice before she died on July 10 , 1990 , and that the assaults would have caused her &quot; extreme pain , and to cry out. &quot; Throughout the hearing , Yoshisato sat doubled_over , with his head nearly touching the counsel table and turned_away from a news camera . His sentence was 10 years shy of the maximum . Deputy Dist . Atty . Carolyn Kirkwood said she was pleased that Yoshisato will spend much of his adult life behind bars , especially because he has never expressed remorse for his crimes . He will be eligible for his first parole hearing when he is 61 , she said . But defense_attorney William Kopeny maintained his client ' s innocence . He called the sentence &quot; harsh &quot; and said he plans to appeal . * Yoshisato was convicted on July 28 of first-degree murder , four counts of sexual_assault and felony child endangerment for beating Felicia to death during a rape with a foreign object . The unemployed laborer who raised dogs had been living for a short time with Purvis after a &quot; whirlwind relationship. &quot; During the trial , Kirkwood told jurors that Yoshisato disliked the toddler ' s crying and became increasingly impatient and abusive during the few weeks she and her mother lived with him . According to a probation department report , Yoshisato said he found a child ' s crying &quot; very irritating , &quot; and admitted that he had occasionally spanked Felicia . But he accused Purvis of assaulting and killing the girl . Police investigators , however , concluded that Yoshisato had attacked the girl when her mother left her alone with him . Yoshisato ' s roommates told police they heard him hitting the girl , asking her if she &quot; wanted more &quot; the night before she died , court records show . A witness told police he overheard Yoshisato say he hated the girl and was going_to kill her . According to a county probation report , Yoshisato had a reputation for being quick-tempered and physically abusive toward women and small animals , once throwing his pregnant wife out of a car , kicking a pregnant dog , and throwing small animals against a wall at a pet_shop where he once worked . Yoshisato ' s case gained some publicity when it was used as a basis for a state Supreme Court decision in June , 1992 , to allow_for the death_penalty for people convicted of killing while raping with a foreign object . Prosecutors said they did not pursue the death_penalty in Yoshisato ' s case partly because Yoshisato had no prior record of convictions for violent crimes .</TEXT>
