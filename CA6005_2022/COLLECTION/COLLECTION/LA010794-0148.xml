   <HEADLINE> MAN ' S PLEA FOR ASYLUM TO BE RECONSIDERED ; REFUGEES : ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ENDS HUNGER_STRIKE AFTER DEPORTATION ORDER IS STAYED . DRAFT-EVADER SAYS HE FLED SERBIA TO AVOID MILITARY_SERVICE THAT COULD HAVE ENTAILED ACTION AGAINST FELLOW MUSLIMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A U.S. immigration judge has stayed a deportation order and agreed to reconsider granting political asylum to a 24-year-old Muslim illegal immigrant from Serbia who has been held_in the Immigration and Naturalization Service detention facility in San Pedro for nine months . The decision by Judge Lauren R . Mathon prompted the immigrant to cease a hunger_strike of several days and express hope that he will be paroled from jail while legal deliberations in his case continue . He asked that only his first_name , Redjep , be used publicly , in_order to protect members of his family in Serbia from possible government reprisals . Mathon ' s ruling was hailed by Salam Al-Marayati , director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Los Angeles , as &quot; helping establish ( the ) responsibility of the Free_World to shelter victims of ethnic cleansing. &quot; The council has championed the immigrant ' s cause with demonstrations , petitions and the retention of an attorney . Redjep is from the heavily Muslim Sandzak province in Serbia . He said he fled to avoid military_service that could have entailed action against fellow Muslims . He made his way across Turkey , Russia and the Pacific on a forged Canadian visa , only to be taken by a Russian freighter on to Southern California when the Canadians rejected him . Since his case was publicized last month , two State_Department advisories to Mathon were disclosed , suggesting that some compromise might be found between granting Redjep asylum and deporting him . &quot; An applicant ( for asylum ) who is a draft-evader or deserter may be considered a refugee , provided it can be shown that he would suffer disproportionately severe punishment for his evasion or desertion on account of his race , religion , nationality , membership in a particular social_group or political opinion , &quot; wrote Roger Dankert , director of the State_Department ' s Office of Asylum Affairs . Dankert added , in his second advisory : &quot; The judge might wish to consider , given the increasingly unsettled conditions in the applicant ' s region of his country_of_origin , such administrative remedies as may be available. &quot; Although Mathon gave no reason in writing for ordering reconsideration of the case , her decision reversed her ruling last summer in which she rejected asylum and ordered deportation as soon as practical . In Washington , the chief INS spokesman , Duke Austin , said there are several common alternatives to granting asylum to or deporting such an individual . One of the most frequently used is to grant parole to the individual , releasing him to live freely until his case is reconsidered , Austin said . He added that in such cases the release can last a long_time , and in some instances the case is never reconsidered . &quot; Some stay in the parole status for four or five years without further proceedings , &quot; he said . Other alternatives are a formal suspension of the individual ' s case , or , if deportation is still considered advisable , a search for a third country to deport the immigrant to , a place where the individual would not be subject_to persecution . &quot; Asylum is never a pure science , &quot; Austin said . The INS spokesman added that State_Department advisories are not particularly popular_with the INS . &quot; It ' s like telling us what we can do , when we are already aware what we can do , &quot; Austin said . &quot; We realize we have discretion. &quot; Mathon said she cannot comment further on the case .</TEXT>
