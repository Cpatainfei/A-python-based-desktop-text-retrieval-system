   <HEADLINE> A NUCLEAR WORRIER ; BRENTWOOD : HAROLD WILLENS , WHO LAUNCHED THE NUCLEAR FREEZE INITIATIVE IN CALIFORNIA IN 1981 , HAS WORKED EVER SINCE TO HALT THE SPREAD OF WEAPONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Harold Willens is no nuclear warrior -- he ' s a nuclear worrier . Over the years , this writer , retired businessman and former Marine , now approaching his 80th birthday , has done more_than most to boost the public ' s awareness of the dangers of nuclear_weapons . In 1981 , when the United States and Soviet_Union were in the thick of the nuclear arms race , Willens launched the nuclear freeze initiative in California . His goal was not only to educate people about nuclear arms , but also to call attention to the spread of such weapons to unstable countries . The measure was Proposition 12 , a non-binding initiative of fewer than two_dozen words that called_for an end to the manufacture , research and proliferation of nuclear_weapons . It was passed in November , 1982 , with 51 % of the vote , and helped move the nuclear arms issue higher on the national agenda . &quot; Friends criticized me for raising and spending $ 4 million for something that would not become law , but something much more important happened : breaking_through the iron_curtain of misinformation and misunderstanding and the remarkable opportunity to educate about the spread of this cancer on the international body_politic we call the world , &quot; Willens said from his home_in Brentwood . Willens saw firsthand what one bomb can do when he was a Marine intelligence_officer during World_War_II . Trained to read , write and speak Japanese , he arrived in Hiroshima weeks after the bomb was dropped . At the time , he said , he did not object to the use of the bomb because he considered the alternative -- the invasion of Japan -- unacceptable . &quot; There was no epiphany at that ime . I was stunned by the destruction of one bomb , but I was also awed and felt great relief because I was aware of the plan to invade Japan . I felt a general pride of being part of the military effort and today still think I did the right thing in that war , &quot; he said . The epiphany came 15 years later , when he was a guest at a think_tank discussing nuclear_weapons . &quot; A match lit_up inside of me . Something intellectual and visceral came_together that said to me that ( a ) Soviet-American arms race was a time_bomb which would destroy the whole world , &quot; he said . &quot; Rational people , like Eisenhower , opposed the use of nuclear_weapons and recognized that we couldn ' t survive a nuclear war , but there were those who thought we could. &quot; Willens did not rest after the nuclear freeze initiative won passage . After the measure ' s approval , Gov . Jerry Brown planned to present it to President Ronald Reagan . But the White_House turned Brown down . Then , Sen . Alan Cranston tried and he was refused . Willens found the way . &quot; Helping us in that campaign was Reagan ' s daughter , Patti . We became friends . I visited her and explained how if I couldn ' t deliver the initiative personally , a lot of media attention would be focused_on it , &quot; Willens said . &quot; She reached for the phone , dialed and said , ' I want to speak_to Daddy. ' She said , ' Hi , Daddy , I ' m sitting here with Harold Willens , ' and she explains to him the responsibility he has to millions of people . Reagan referred me to Michael Deaver , who tried to talk me out of it . I told him I already have plans to stage a major march around the White_House and he agreed to set_up the meeting. &quot; Willens remembers staying_up all night before the meeting , carefully preparing his presentation . Then he met with Reagan . &quot; We were all alone except for the photographer . I said our daughters were friends , that I was a Marine , a businessman . . . . He responded with cliches , political catechisms , and when the 15 minutes was over I left totally dejected , feeling my grandchildren didn ' t have a prayer , &quot; Willens said . &quot; It was unforgettable and also depressing that I had just spoken_to the man who didn ' t see the Russians as human_beings and who had his finger on the button. &quot; Harold Willens was born in Russia in a small_town near Kiev and came_to the United States when he was 8 years old . He lived_in Boyle Heights with other immigrant families -- all struggling to survive the Depression . But despite the economic deprivations , Willens found hope to be the dominant feeling among fellow immigrants . It was during those years , he says , that he developed the kind of fearlessness he would later need to take unpopular stands . Working a 60-hour , $ 10-a-week job , he still managed to graduate from high_school . He went_on to become a wealthy_man , making real_estate investments and starting a machine parts and equipment supply company . Today , Willens thinks the danger from a nuclear catastrophe is greater than in the most frigid days of the Cold_War . The reason , he says , is that during the half-century of the nuclear age , the United States has been guilty of a demeaning double_standard : preaching nuclear abstention while practicing precisely the opposite . &quot; What ' s it going_to take ? &quot; he asked , &quot; Pakistan attacking India with nuclear_weapons ? &quot; The United States , Willens says , would be the logical leader of worldwide non-proliferation efforts . To critics , he says the United States does not need a large arsenal of nuclear_weapons to be secure . To the press , he says don ' t lump chemical , biological and nuclear_weapons together , because nuclear arms pose by far the greatest threat . And to young people , he says be a citizen -- not a resident -- and don ' t wait until you ' re a senior_citizen to do_it .</TEXT>
