   <HEADLINE> GERMAN LEGISLATURE OKS TROOP ROLE ; MILITARY : PARLIAMENT BACKS HIGH_COURT RULING ON PEACEKEEPING MISSIONS AND BALKAN PATROLS FROM THE SKITTISH NATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a specially convened summer session , Parliament on Friday endorsed a supreme_court decision allowing the German military to take_part in international peace missions and approved the deployment of troops on NATO air and sea patrols in the Balkans . The nationally televised vote marked the first time since World_War_II that Parliament has approved use of German troops in combat abroad , although it was largely symbolic because Germany joined the missions two years ago . Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel cautioned that the government does not intend to militarize its foreign_policy . &quot; Even after the ruling , we will stick_with our established culture of restraint , &quot; he told legislators . &quot; Normality in foreign and security policy does not mean playing world policeman. &quot; Defense Minister Volker Ruehe added_on television that the high_court decision &quot; is not a marching order for worldwide deployments. &quot; Two weeks ago , Germany ' s highest_court ruled that the constitution allowed federal troops to participate in international military_missions with the consent of Parliament . The ruling was in response to actions brought by the opposition Social Democratic Party over Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s decisions to deploy German ships in the Adriatic_Sea to help enforce an embargo against the rump Yugoslavia , send soldiers on radar surveillance flights over Bosnia-Herzegovina and order peacekeepers on the ground in Somalia . The United States , United Nations and North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization have been urging Germany to play a greater role in international peacekeeping . Kohl , who is seeking a seat for Germany on the U.N. Security_Council , has agreed that the reunified country must take_on more responsibilities in keeping with its size and economy . Germans , recalling the country ' s Nazi history , are nervous about giving a higher profile and more power to the military . But Kinkel argued that Germany is morally and ethically obligated to participate in peace missions &quot; precisely because Germany has broken the peace in the past. &quot; Parliament agreed to the government ' s request to lift restraints it put_on the troops monitoring the former Yugoslav federation , giving them the same power as their allies to fire on ships in the Adriatic_Sea that are suspected of breaking the embargo against Serbia and Montenegro . German troops on NATO ' s AWACS aircraft will also be allowed to fly over non-NATO member countries such_as Austria and Hungary . Kinkel said that for Germany to participate in future military_missions , the operations must comply with international_law and have a clear mandate . &quot; The military_mission must be fulfillable , and the military components must be part of a convincing concept for a political solution , &quot; Kinkel said . Despite their court challenge , the Social Democrats voted for approval of the troop deployment . They said they only opposed the government ' s unilateral decision to deploy troops and wanted a consultation with the legislature from the beginning . &quot; My party takes the view that . . . aggressive states are blocked economically and that this blockade should not rest only on resolutions but should be supervised and , if necessary , enforced militarily , &quot; said Social Democratic leader Rudolf Scharping . &quot; Therefore , we vote for the deployment of troops in the Adriatic_Sea , &quot; he said . &quot; The same is true for the supervision of the protective zones and for the enforcement of the ' no-fly ' zone in Bosnia-Herzegovina. &quot; Scharping is challenging Kohl in the Oct . 16 federal election , and the daylong discussion of foreign_policy often seemed like a campaign debate .</TEXT>
