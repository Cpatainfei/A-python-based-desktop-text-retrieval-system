   <HEADLINE> DOW DROPS 42 , BUT THERE ' S NO PANIC SELLING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Following the perverse logic of Wall_Street , where good news for the economy is often bad news for the market , stock and bond prices continued to tumble Monday , with the bellwether Dow Jones industrial average falling 42 points to its lowest close since last November . But the panic selling some observers -- including top White_House officials -- had feared would follow the long holiday weekend did not materialize . The Dow industrials plunged more_than 80 points in early trading Monday , but prices recovered as some investors and brokers saw buying opportunities . Typical of them was San Clemente resident Doug Candler , who described himself as a medium-size investor . Candler said he is standing_pat on his current stocks and taking_advantage of the drop_in prices to convert some bonds into stocks . He said he sees no intrinsic weakness in the economy or the nation -- and therefore no reason to dump his stock portfolio . &quot; I think we ' re OK , &quot; he said . &quot; We have been through this many times before , even ( during the market ' s drop_in ) 1987 , and we all came_out fine. &quot; Newport Beach investment_banker Russell Diehl said his phone always rings off_the_hook during a falling market &quot; with calls from friends and clients wanting to know if this is the time to bolt . that ' s the question of the day. &quot; His advice ? &quot; If you are trading &quot; on speculative stocks &quot; there is probably no reason to be in the market these days , but if you are investing ( for the long_run ) , then bolting will only rack_up transaction costs &quot; paid to brokers for each buy or sell order . Orange County-based companies fared no worse than any others in Monday ' s market , as 66 of the 100 largest publicly traded companies in the county saw their stock values drop while 18 saw stock prices rise -- generally on word of pending mergers or other deals beneficial to the specific company . &quot; I ' ve seen no great panic , &quot; said Costa Mesa broker Jeffrey Kilpatrick . &quot; I ' ve had more people calling to ask about opportunities for buying than trying to sell. &quot; Stocks have been falling_for several weeks on concerns that strong economic_growth will rekindle inflation , and a glowing employment report on Friday , when the stock_market was closed , sent shivers down the spines of many on Wall_Street . Inflation is the bugaboo of Federal_Reserve policy-makers , who want to extend the recovery by keeping wages and prices under tight control . Indeed , the Fed is widely expected to raise interest_rates further to head_off inflation . At the same time , high interest_rates are traditionally the enemy of the stock_market , which competes with interest-bearing instruments for investors ' dollars . Clinton_Administration officials , led by National Economic Council Chairman Robert E . Rubin , spent the weekend trying to calm investors . That may have helped temper the decline in the stock_market , which analysts said held_up well under the circumstances , although declining issues beat_out advances 2 # 108 to 371 . The Dow closed at 3 # 593.35 amid heavy trading of 342 million shares on the New York Stock_Exchange . The same could not be said for the bond market , however . Prices for 30-year U.S. Treasury_bonds plummeted $ 18.13 per $ 1 # 000 , sending the yield , or effective interest_rate , up_to 7.40 % from 7.25 % -- the highest rate since January , 1993 . President Clinton on Monday said interest_rates -- nudged up twice by the Fed in the last two months , in part_with the intention of bursting the stock_market ' s bubble -- already were too high and had provoked an &quot; overreaction &quot; in financial markets . But Clinton has no direct control over the independent governors of the Federal_Reserve_Board , let alone investors , and many market watchers expect continued declines in both stocks and bonds , albeit nothing as drastic as the October , 1987 , market crash . &quot; It has been such a severe three-day decline that we ' ll probably get a rally sometime this week , &quot; said Eric Miller , chief investment officer at Donaldson , Lufkin &amp; Jenrette , a New York brokerage . &quot; But it ' s not at all assured that this is the low. &quot; In many respects , the recent market declines are a logical reaction to a long run-up in share prices -- a &quot; correction &quot; in the parlance of Wall_Street . Over the last several years , investors large and small have poured into the stock and bond markets , searching for higher returns at a time of low interest_rates . Now , however , many of those investors have found themselves overextended just when interest_rates are going_up . The current market troubles began in February when the Federal_Reserve nudged interest_rates up slightly -- a move that now appears mainly to have produced expectations of a further hike . Large investment funds for wealthy investors , known as hedge_funds , in many cases sustained big losses by betting against rising rates -- bets largely placed with borrowed funds -- and they ' re now being forced to sell , driving prices down further . Meanwhile , many other investors -- including small investors in mutual_funds and individual stocks and bonds -- are sitting_tight ; they are not necessarily getting_out of stocks and bonds , but they are not getting_in any deeper . Thus there are few buyers of any description , a situation traders referred to as a lack of &quot; liquidity &quot; in the market . &quot; From the small guys to the big guys , the investment community has too_much exposure to risk , &quot; said Kevin Logan , chief U.S. economist for Swiss Bank Corp . &quot; Everyone looks_at the situation and says , ' I shouldn ' t buy any more at this level ; I don ' t know how high the Fed is going_to lift rates. ' &quot; At the same , recent innovations in financial services -- notably the emergence of financial instruments known as derivatives , which allow professionals to pursue complex , computer-aided trading strategies across many markets at once -- have rendered markets far more volatile . Price changes that might once have taken weeks to happen now occur in minutes . Even with these uncertainties , there is little evidence that mutual_fund investors , many of whom have grown accustomed to fat returns , are abandoning the market . Wall_Street is hoping that remains the case , because wholesale redemptions of mutual_fund assets could drive the market much lower . But uncertainty and volatility are likely to reign for some time , and analysts will have to struggle to explain seemingly dramatic market activity . On Monday , for example , many market participants were shocked by the steep decline in bonds , which were traded on Friday and had already fallen dramatically in response to the strong employment data . Some attributed the fall-off to comments from the widely followed economist Henry Kaufman , who predicted that long-term bond yields could hit 9 % to 10 % before reaching the peak of the current cycle , though he said he expects a rally in bond prices in the near term . Kaufman also said stock prices should not fall far in the near term because of strong underlying fundamentals , but that stocks remain vulnerable in the long term . Still , &quot; It is highly unlikely that the setback in_stock and bond prices in the United States will truncate the current economic expansion , &quot; Kaufman said . &quot; This is because financial rehabilitation has gone_a_long_way in improving the financial health of all key sectors of the U.S. economy. &quot; Times staff writers John O ' Dell and Chris Woodyard in Costa Mesa contributed to this report . * BONDS HIT HARD : Owners of bonds and bond funds took huge losses .
