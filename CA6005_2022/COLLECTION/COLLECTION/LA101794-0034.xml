   <HEADLINE> IF ' THE END IS NEAR , ' SO IS VIOLENCE ; SOLAR TEMPLE : THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN APOCALYPTIC GROUPS ; THE CHALLENGE IS HOW WE DEAL WITH THEM TO PREVENT TRAGEDY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Are tragic and grotesque happenings in religious sects becoming commonplace ? When 53 Solar Temple members were found dead in Switzerland and Canada this month , everyone remembered the fires that consumed more_than 80 people in Waco and the 913 suicides in Jonestown . In all three , the leaders died too , and the groups shared a dominant theological conviction : the world was collapsing to make_way for a perfect new one . The events stimulate many questions . Why does this belief lead some to stockpile arms and suicide ? Were the climaxes inevitable ? Do many share the conviction ? Where does the belief come from ? When God is seen as all-powerful and wholly benevolent , some ask why the good suffer . A conventional response is that when each person dies , justice will be meted_out in heaven and hell . An apocalyptic answer , derived too from the Bible and Koran , is that God has promised the end will be a collective one , an awful day of carnage and retribution here , and the signs are that the process is beginning soon . The earliest apocalyptic groups , the Essenes and Zealots-Sicarri appear in the 1st Century AD and ever since , apocalyptic groups have multiplied . Usually leaders are believed to have divine powers because scripture promises that a messiah will appear , or Christ will return . Ambiguous and unchangeable sacred_texts of established religions constantly stimulate new apocalyptic groups . There may be 30 # 000 groups in the world today , 800 in America . The overwhelming majority are pacifist , seeking a sanctuary or base to separate themselves and prepare_for the new_world . Sometimes their behavior reflects the times ; when society expects great tribulations , more people arm themselves . The late medieval era was such a period , and so is ours , perpetually buffeted by new secular predictions of world collapse . Religious ages produce larger apocalyptic groups able to expand ; our secular era stimulates tiny ones that may stockpile arms for defense , always knowing that their effort is inadequate . Apocalyptic pacifists see all wars that states wage as serving evil interests , but violence to end the world is altogether different . Sacred texts teach that divine force is essential then , and the righteous may be called to participate . A group believing that the end is near and the day is knowable can be dangerous because so_much anxiety is aroused about who will be saved and why . Violence is an option , but one rarely taken first . The group aims to be saved and knows the righteous will be persecuted . When the apocalypse seems imminent , the group ' s lifestyle , always organized to challenge existing social conventions , makes more demands . Sometimes the demands become provocative and bizarre , especially when sex , property and clothing are affected . The Skoptsi , a 19th-Century Russian group of about 10 # 000 , convinced that the new_world would be sexless , demonstrated their faith by castrating all males and cutting_off all female breasts . Canadian Dukhobors regularly burn their possessions and make long nudist marches . Public outrage in response makes believers feel that persecution is increasing , bringing the end and salvation nearer . The ultimate form of persecution is martyrdom . In some theologies martyrdom creates a new life for the martyr and a new_world for others . Jesus called his dying a baptism , and the Gospel according to John describes martyrdom as the seed that must die so that the wheat will grow -- a theme found in Solar Temple documents . Preaching used to be the road to martyrdom . A world that protects speech closes that path , which may help explain why the ancient Zealot-Sicarri practices of collective suicide appeal when all else fails . The aim is to blackmail God to fulfill his promise . The whole group must participate because that is the condition of the promise . It is too easy to demonize apocalyptic groups . But only a small proportion becomes violent and many find scriptural reasons to turn_back . The Quakers had violent origins and the peaceful , productive Pennsylvania_Dutch were once Anabaptists , the most feared religious terror group of 16th-Century Europe . Adequate policies recognize that apocalyptic doctrines always provide choices , and our inability to acknowledge that contributed to the Waco tragedy , or so a Texas jury and many academic authorities believe . Canadian officials fearful of another Waco tried to convict Solar Temple leaders on a variety of charges . Their evidence was not convincing . Did their efforts encourage the group perception that the end was near , as its documents suggest ? There will be other confrontations ; do we know enough to cope ?</TEXT>
