   <HEADLINE> LEO KUPER ; SOCIOLOGIST WROTE ABOUT WORLDWIDE GENOCIDE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Leo Kuper , an internationally recognized sociologist and scholar whose research on genocide set benchmark guidelines in that field , has died . Representatives for his family and the Institute on the Holocaust and Genocide , based in Jerusalem , said he died in Los Angeles on Monday . He was 85 . A native of South_Africa , Kuper taught at universities throughout the world , including a 15-year tenure at UCLA , where he was a professor of sociology and director of the African Studies Center . In 1981 , Kuper wrote what is considered his landmark work : &quot; Genocide : Its Political Use in the Twentieth Century. &quot; In it he created a theme of &quot; the odious scourge &quot; that has carried_over into other works_on the subject . The Times Literary Supplement of London said that &quot; if there were a peace prize for sociologists , it should be awarded to ( Kuper ) . &quot; In 1985 , Kuper was part of a select group of British and American officials who formed International Alert . Based in Los Angeles and London , it worked closely with human_rights groups ( particularly Amnesty International ) to keep ethnic developments firmly in the glare of international publicity , unlike the secrecy of the Holocaust , which resulted in the deaths of 6 million Jews . Kuper said at that time that he estimated that genocide had claimed more lives since World_War_II than had the Nazi death camps . That same year , Kuper wrote &quot; The Prevention of Genocide , &quot; in which he analyzed the major obstacles to United Nations action in Cambodia , Bangladesh , Timor , Indonesia and other African and Asian_nations where human_rights abuses occur . Born in Johannesburg , Kuper practiced law in South_Africa until World_War_II . After military_service he taught at the University of Natal , South_Africa , and the University of Birmingham in England , where he also did neighborhood planning for the city of Coventry . His main books on South_Africa , &quot; Passive_Resistance in South_Africa &quot; and &quot; An African Bourgeoisie , &quot; were banned in that country . Kuper also was a founding member of the International Council of the Institute on the Holocaust and Genocide and a contributing editor to its publications . He is survived by two daughters and three grandchildren .</TEXT>
