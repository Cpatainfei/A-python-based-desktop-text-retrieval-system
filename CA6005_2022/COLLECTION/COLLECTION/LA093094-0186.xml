   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE ; HUFFINGTON ATTACKS RIVAL ON JUDGES ; CHALLENGER SAYS IN NEW ADS THAT SEN . FEINSTEIN HAS VOTED FOR TWO LENIENT FEDERAL JURISTS . BUT HER CAMPAIGN COUNTERS THAT THE JUDGES ' RECORDS HAVE BEEN DISTORTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington stepped_up his attack on Sen . Dianne Feinstein ' s anti-crime record Thursday , broadcasting a new television commercial that says she has voted for lenient federal judges . Huffington ' s ad criticizes two judges Feinstein supported for the federal bench , saying they have been soft_on crime . But in both cases , the commercial omits information that contrasts with the ad ' s claims . In one example , the commercial charges that a Feinstein-supported judge opposed capital_punishment more_than 100 times -- &quot; even more_than Rose Bird , &quot; California ' s controversial former chief_justice . But proponents of the Florida judge , Rosemary Barkett , said that she has also upheld death sentences more_than 200 times . Legal analysts defending the commercial for the Huffington campaign disputed that figure , but they acknowledged that Barkett may have upheld more death sentences than she opposed . In a second example , Huffington ' s ad complains that Feinstein supported New Jersey Judge Lee Sarokin even though he once freed a &quot; cop killer. &quot; But the defendant ' s conviction for killing a police_officer was overturned because the prosecution withheld pertinent evidence . A retrial is pending . &quot; Feinstein judges let killers live after victims died , &quot; the ad says . Feinstein supporters said Huffington distorted the judges ' records to paint an inaccurate picture of the senator ' s crime record . &quot; I think congressman Michael Huffington underestimates the sophistication of the people of California , &quot; said the Rev . Cecil Murray of the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles . &quot; They have a very good b.s. meter , and the meter is registering pretty high with Mr. Michael Huffington . . . . He takes a little bit of something to ( make ) the mass media create mass hysteria. &quot; Feinstein supporters contended that Huffington was attempting to counter the endorsements given to the senator recently by a dozen prominent California police groups . And they said the Republican candidate was attacking Feinstein ' s crime record because he does not have one of_his_own . &quot; It ' s always easy to attack someone who has a record , &quot; Los Angeles City Atty . James Hahn said . &quot; Huffington has never been there to support law enforcement. &quot; Feinstein serves on the Senate Judiciary Committee , where she is required to vote on President Clinton ' s nomination of judges to the federal bench . House members , including Rep . Huffington ( R-Santa Barbara ) , do not vote on judicial appointments . Huffington ' s new television commercial expands an advertising_campaign about Barkett that he began this week in newspapers and on radio commercials . In doing so , he brings_to California a highly partisan debate over the two judges that has been raging in Washington . Barkett ' s approval by the Senate followed a six-hour debate in which conservatives attacked the judge ' s record on capital_punishment . Still , she was approved by the Senate in April , 61 to 37 , for a seat on the U.S. 11th Circuit Court of Appeals . Barkett won the votes of eight Republican senators including the only GOP member from her home state of Florida , Connie Mack . Sarokin ' s nomination has not reached the floor of the Senate . But he was favored by Feinstein last month in a 12-5 vote of the Senate Judiciary Committee . Sarokin ' s support on the committee was also bipartisan , including former Philadelphia Dist . Atty . Arlen Specter ( R-Pa. ) , Alan K . Simpson ( R-Wyo. ) and William S . Cohen ( R-Me. ) . In other Senate_campaign developments Thursday : * Feinstein released a list of 75 Republican supporters , including some prominent business , law_enforcement and agricultural leaders . Some names on the list have been disclosed previously . The new additions include Orange County developer Kathryn Thompson , a former member of President George_Bush ' s elite Team 100 , and actor Clint Eastwood . * Feinstein ' s campaign confirmed that the senator has contributed $ 400 # 000 of_her_own money to her campaign . Feinstein said last week she was talking to banks about leveraging her home and a beach_house to help pay_for the campaign . * Both campaigns confirmed that their first debate will be held Thursday on the &quot; LarryKing Live &quot; television_program . The one-hour broadcast will be_on CNN beginning at 6 p.m. in California . Political Scorecard 39 days to go before Californians go_to the polls . THE GOVERNOR ' S RACE * What Happened Wednesday : Democrat Kathleen Brown told students at San Jose State that Gov . Pete Wilson has devastated the state ' s educational system by raising tuition , curtailing proposed college loan programs and failing to promote a vision for the future . She also announced plans for a new offering of California savings bonds to help future students pay_for college . Wilson remained in his Sacramento office in the midst of a marathon bill-signing session . * What ' s Ahead : Brown ' s campaign declined to release its schedule . Wilson ' s campaign said he will spend the day in Sacramento , where a deadline for signing or vetoing legislative bills looms at midnight tonight . THE SENATE_RACE * What Happened Wednesday : Rep . Mike Huffington began airing a new television commercial that criticizes incumbent Democrat Dianne Feinstein for supporting what he termed lenient judges . Feinstein replied by releasing endorsements that made her day , from movie tough_guy Clint Eastwood and 74 other prominent Republicans . * What ' s Ahead : Today both candidates will remain in Washington , where Congress is in session . NOTABLE QUOTES &quot; We are almost out of voter registration cards . There are , at least , a lot of people out there attempting to register voters. &quot; -- Melissa Warren of the secretary_of_state ' s office , which has printed extra cards and sent_out 750 # 000 . Those who want to vote_in November must register by Oct . 11 .</TEXT>
