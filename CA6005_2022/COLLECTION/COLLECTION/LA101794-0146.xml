   <HEADLINE> A COSTLY BURDEN FOR STATE ; SICK , DISABLED INMATES ARE MOST EXPENSIVE TO HOUSE ; SOME SAY THEY SHOULD BERELEASED IF NO LONGER A THREAT , BUT JUDGES USUALLY FREE ONLY THE TERMINALLY ILL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In his wheelchair , he looks benign , almost pitiful -- this man who was convicted of methodically shooting to death four people in a dispute over drugs five years ago in San Diego . Carlos Fonseca was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole , and was dispatched as a strapping 28-year-old to Pelican Bay_State Prison , the place reserved for the worst of the worst . His incarceration was supposed to be a custodial no-brainer : Keep him fed , clothed and locked_up . But two years ago his Pelican Bay cellmate gouged_out Fonseca ' s right eye and bashed his head against a concrete floor , causing severe brain damage . Today Fonseca languishes in a hospital cell at the California Institution for Men . He is unable to stand_up on_his_own and is incontinent . He is in therapy to learn how to manipulate his arms and legs after three surgeries released the contractures in his limbs . Fonseca is one of about 200 state prisoners who receive acute hospital level care in California prisons or at nearby community hospitals . More_than 1 # 000 others receive long-term nursing_care behind bars . Another 3 # 000 inmates are being treated for acute mental_illnesses . The disabled inmates include amputees , paraplegics , the blind . Some are debilitated by strokes or by AIDS , heart_disease or old_age . They are the most expensive and burdensome of California ' s 126 # 000 state prisoners , and under the &quot; three strikes &quot; sentencing law , their numbers are expected to increase as the prison population mushrooms and grows older . Despite the deepening prison crisis , debilitated inmates such_as Fonseca are kept behind bars at considerable taxpayer expense . &quot; It is neither humane nor productive for our society to keep people in prison when their physical condition has deteriorated to_the_point that they are no longer a threat , &quot; said Alison Hardy , an attorney with the reform-oriented Prison Law Office . Legislation to release such prisoners is under study by the Assembly Judiciary Committee staff , but it is doubtful that such a measure could survive the tough-on-crime political climate . Prison officials say that judges , who must approve early releases , are not likely to let_out debilitated inmates who are not terminally ill . The Department of Corrections recommended only four such releases during the past 3 1 / 2 years and , in three cases , the judges refused . &quot; I think the limited track record we have with these kinds of inmates shows that the courts are not inclined to grant these releases , &quot; said corrections spokeswoman Christine May . Inmates who are expected to die of their illnesses sometimes do get_out of prison through a &quot; compassionate release &quot; procedure that excludes prisoners sentenced to death and those serving life without parole . But corrections officials are cautious about approving compassionate releases for fear that an inmate will unexpectedly recover and commit a new crime or that the public will protest . The procedure requires that prison doctors determine that an inmate has less than six months to live . The director of corrections may then ask the sentencing judge to free the prisoner . Sometimes the procedure is so slow that the candidate for release never gets_out alive . During the last 3 1 / 2 years , prison physicians recommended compassionate releases for 208 inmates , most of them dying of AIDS or cancer . The director of corrections approved 113 of the recommendations and , of those , judges released 69 . But prisoners suffering from non-terminal illnesses almost never receive such releases , no matter how debilitating the disease . In a first-floor locked medical wing at Vacaville prison , nurses and doctors tend to men who can barely get_out of bed -- let alone escape . One man suffers from dementia and another from a chronic heart problem . One is paralyzed from a gunshot wound , another from a stab wound . A stroke victim appears oblivious to the glowing television screen on the wall above him . Sometimes sentencing judges are approached by attorneys or politicians seeking the release of such inmates . Sen . Robert Presley ( D-Riverside ) , the outgoing chairman of the Joint Committee on Prisons , has tried without success to persuade a judge to release a 28-year-old multiple_sclerosis patient who is serving 25 years to life for robbery and murder . Since entering prison , Craig Lundy has gone virtually blind and his body is twisted into a fetal ball . &quot; The system is making_sure he won ' t hurt anybody , &quot; said Susan Wallace , Presley ' s chief counsel . &quot; He won ' t fall_out of bed on you and hurt you. &quot; The only inmate suffering from a non-terminal affliction to be granted an early release from prison was Troy Christian Davey . Now 26 , Davey was involved in the stabbing death of a friend in Yolo County five years ago . An acquaintance of Davey ' s wielded the knife and pleaded guilty to manslaughter ; he was sentenced to seven years . But Davey refused to plea-bargain and was convicted of second-degree murder . He was sentenced to 15 years to life . Davey later attempted to kill himself by drinking cleaning fluid in the Yolo County Jail . He was sent to the California Medical Facility at Vacaville where , in January , 1990 , he again tried suicide with an overdose of medication . Shortly afterward , he was placed in a small cellblock where prisoners are evaluated for possible placement in the prison psychiatric_hospital . Some prisoners in these special units receive group therapy , others are considered too psychotic to interact with anyone . In one unit visited by a Times reporter , inmates were so mentally_ill that they lay on the floor and one had crawled under his bunk . Outside , others paced in one-man , kennel-like exercise cages . * Corrections officials are under court_order to improve care_for mentally disturbed inmates at Vacaville , but continually fail to meet the standards set . Earlier this month in Sacramento , U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton threatened to jail corrections officials if they do not make the improvements agreed to in a legal settlement with prison reform attorneys . Charging that corrections officials apparently are &quot; not serious &quot; about improving mental_health care , Karlton urged that they consider the volume of criticism and ask themselves , &quot; Can everybody be wrong but us ? &quot; Health_care reformers say conditions will grow even worse as a result of &quot; three strikes. &quot; &quot; I expect it ' s going_to deteriorate even further , &quot; said Meena V . Meenakshi , who quit her post as chief psychiatrist at Vacaville in protest of conditions . &quot; They ' re not geared to taking_care of the people who are there already. &quot; Take the case of Davey , who was locked_in a unit reserved for the most deranged inmates . In bare concrete cells behind a double set of steel doors , they are guarded by correctional officers who wear armored vests and goggles as protection against attacks and hurled feces and urine . Four days after overdosing , Davey tried to hang himself with a sheet . The suicide attempt left him a quadriplegic with the mind of a child . Davey ' s mother , Alice Harris , said that during the next three years she wrote to prison officials and politicians attempting to get her son released as his limbs contracted from atrophy . State records indicate that prison medical personnel stopped giving him physical_therapy . Finally , Yolo County Superior_Court Judge James Stevens , the jurist who sentenced Davey to prison , intervened . &quot; Prison wasn ' t having any effect on him , &quot; the judge recalled , &quot; because he didn ' t know where he was. &quot; Stevens also believed that releasing Davey was a &quot; question of common decency. &quot; After an inquiry from the judge , a state investigator found Davey barely able to speak . In response to a question , he managed to say , &quot; I ' ve been a good , good boy. &quot; Sent home to Sacramento in March , 1993 , Davey is now on probation for life and under the care of his mother . A lawsuit filed by attorney Christopher T . Cody of Oakland accuses prison officials of failure to take steps to prevent Davey ' s suicide attempt , failure to provide proper medical_care , and operation of substandard medical facilities at Vacaville . The Corrections Department denies the charges and says Davey was under close supervision before the hanging . In Chino , 400 miles to the south , the once-ferocious killer Carlos Fonseca is kept_in a locked prison hospital cell , where he is diapered like an infant . His wife , Janice , clings_to the hope that someday she will be able to take him home and care_for him . She says he is no longer physically or mentally capable of crime and has no idea why he is in prison . &quot; He continually asks me why , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
