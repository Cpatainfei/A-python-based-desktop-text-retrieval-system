   <HEADLINE> PLAN PROMOTES HUNTING IN COAL CANYON ; LAND USE : STATE CITES RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES . LOCAL ENVIRONMENTALISTS FEAR ECOLOGICAL DAMAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A state Fish and Game Commission_plan to promote hunting in Coal Canyon has sparked bitter debate between environmentalists and sportsmen over the wildlife living_in the dry , rugged hills here . The proposal to designate the area an ecological reserve and allow hunting with bows and shotguns is supported by local hunters and Fish and Game officials , who say it would provide recreational opportunities without significantly reducing the wildlife population . The plan is scheduled to come_before the commission Oct . 7 at its meeting in Palm Springs . &quot; One of the department ' s mandates is to provide recreational hunting use of its lands wherever that activity does not impact the biological resources we are protecting , &quot; said Bonnie Turner , land acquisition and management coordinator for the state Fish and Game Department . &quot; The department has always tried to promote hunting and fishing on its lands because there is so little opportunity to do that on private lands. &quot; On the other side are local environmentalists and the Orange County Harbors , Beaches and Parks Commission , which this week adopted a resolution urging the state to disallow hunting . &quot; We see the need to keep the area open for hikers and nature_study groups , &quot; said Gordon Ruser , a spokesman for the Angeles chapter of the Sierra Club , which worked for the county resolution . &quot; Hunting would deter people from going there just to look_at the plants and the animals. &quot; Hunting is not specifically prohibited in Coal Canyon now , state officials note . But few hunters ever go there because it is relatively unknown and difficult to enter . Opponents argue that designating the area an ecological reserve open for hunting would bring_in a swarm of hunters , attracted by its listing as a hunting area in Fish and Game publications . &quot; If it ' s advertised in state publications , we would expect the hunting to increase , &quot; Ruser said . &quot; There are some species there that we feel would be jeopardized by the influx of hunting. &quot; The controversy is partially rooted in the way the land was acquired . Owned previously by private developers , the 952 acres near the Riverside Freeway in the northeast portion of the county was purchased by the state in 1991 with $ 4 million in bond money from Prop . 70 , the California Wildlife , Coastal and Park Land Conservation Act . The initiative , which was approved in 1988 , allowed the acquisition of open lands . Those opposed to hunting point_out that none of the money came from hunting_license fees . Fish and Game officials , however , argue that hunting in the reserve is consistent with the traditional use of the areas next to it . &quot; Hunting is a historical activity in this area , &quot; said John Anderson , a senior biologist with the department . &quot; The reserve is directly adjacent to the Cleveland National Forest where hunting is allowed . &quot; We ' ve had our biologists and plant ecologists on the site and their recommendation is that hunting will not have an adverse effect on the wildlife ( populations ) there , &quot; he said . But Bob Hamilton , executive_officer of the county Harbors , Beaches and Parks Commission , said , &quot; There is concern that in the absence of any evidence of an overpopulation of animals , that there is no justification for encouraging or allowing hunting. &quot; The department ' s original proposal was to allow hunting in the reserve . After several anti-hunting comments during a public hearing last month , however , Anderson revised the recommendation to allow hunters to kill only smaller animals such_as rabbits and birds . The recommendation now under_consideration would also prohibit the use of pistols and most rifles , limiting hunters to bows and shotguns , which have a much shorter range . Fish and Game commissioners will take public comment and could make a decision Oct . 7 .</TEXT>
