   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES / LILLEHAMMER ; NOTEBOOK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> CBS ' first-night coverage of the Winter_Olympics drew the largest audience ever to watch the opening ceremony of a Winter Games . An average of 19.6 million television homes were tuned_in to all or part of the tape-delayed broadcast . The next most-watched opening ceremony was at Lake Placid in 1980 , when it was watched in 17.3 million television homes . Saturday ' s three-hour prime-time show drew a 20.8 national Nielsen rating and a 34 audience share even though there were viewer complaints that the network spent too long -- about an hour -- on features and interviews before going_to the opening ceremony . The rating for the opening ceremoney at Albertville , France , two years ago was a 14.5 and a 24 share . Each ratings point represents 942 # 000 households . The share refers to the percentage of televisions in_use that are tuned to a program . * There were complaints Sunday that CBS , on its daytime shows , was giving results of events that were to be shown later . Lou D ' Ermilio , a CBS spokesman in Lillehammer , said next weekend the anchors , Jim Nantz and Andrea Joyce , will be more consistent in warning viewers to look_away if they don ' t want to know results . Also , Joyce said the United States ' 4-4 tie_in hockey with France was shown on &quot; a little bit of a delay. &quot; In the East , it was a half-hour delay . But in the West , the delay was 3 1 / 2 hours , meaning the game was over before the start was shown by CBS . Missing from the hockey telecast was CBS ' much-balleyhooed goalie-cam because U.S. goalie Mike Dunham told the network Saturday he had decided he would n ' t feel comfortable with a tiny camera mounted on his helmet . On tonight ' s late-night wrap , host Pat O ' Brien celebrates his 46th birthday and Norwegian super-model Vendela guests . LARRY STEWART</TEXT>
