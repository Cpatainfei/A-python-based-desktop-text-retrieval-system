   <HEADLINE> NO APPETITE FOR TV NEWS HYPE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Howard Rosenberg ' s column &quot; ' News- Hour ' Chases the News , Not Simpson &quot; ( Oct . 26 ) was right on . As a former news freak , I used to watch several hours of local news a day -- but no more ! To get the small amount of news dispensed between the mountains of idiotic , ridiculous hype on the Rodney King beating , the Menendez trial and now the Simpson trial is simply not worth the aggravation.Give me &quot; MacNeil / Lehrer &quot; or CNN any time . JAMES R . GALLAGHER Huntington Beach * I congratulate Howard Rosenberg for recognizing &quot; The MacNeil / Lehrer NewsHour. &quot; Within a_few months of my 1978 migration to the United States , I began feeling nauseated by the news &quot; shows &quot; of network television . They seemed to lack truthfulness , objectivity and courtesy -- the staples of true journalism . They were nothing but a forum for silky-tongued , well-dressed and glamorous folks to drum_up business for their sponsors and to increase their personal popularity . Eventually I discovered &quot; The MacNeil / Lehrer NewsHour. &quot; Now I have made_it my primary source of news , along with a_few newspapers . &quot; NewsHour &quot; strives to probe and clarify the viewpoint of its guests . And it does so with dignity and courtesy . Sixteen years ago , I was amazed by the extent of freedom accorded to the press in the United States . But , having watched the network and cable news , I realized that the freedom does not necessarily guarantee quality . Network and cable journalism , with divided loyalties and dubious ethics , is no better than a policed newspaper in a totalitarian society . But I am glad that we do have &quot; MacNeil / Lehrer &quot; as a choice on television . I strongly urge your readers to give the &quot; NewsHour &quot; a try . ARUN IVENGAR Buena Park</TEXT>
