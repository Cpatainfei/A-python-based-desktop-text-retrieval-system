   <HEADLINE> EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : THOUSAND OAKS ; MOBILE CRIME WATCH TO BEGIN NEXT MONTH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ventura County sheriff ' s deputies and community leaders will team_up next month for a new Thousand Oaks Neighborhood Watch program that asks employees of mobile businesses to be_on the lookout for crime . The program , which was approved by the City_Council earlier this year , will rely_on cellular-phone-toting workers to call sheriff ' s officials if they spot suspicious behavior . Recognizing suspicious behavior will be the topic of a Sept . 14 training session at the East Valley Sheriff ' s Station for participants in the program . Employees of mobile businesses that operate routinely around Thousand Oaks are eligible to participate , if they have their own cellular_phones or a two-way radio system . Sheriff ' s officials said they will schedule private training sessions for businesses unable to release employees to attend the 6 p.m. meeting . For more information or to sign_up for training , call the Conejo Valley Chamber_of_Commerce at 499-1993 or Senior Deputy Patti Dreyer at 494-8267 . MATTHEW MOSK</TEXT>
