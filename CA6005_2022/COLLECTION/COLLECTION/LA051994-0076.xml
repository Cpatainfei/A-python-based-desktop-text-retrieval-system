   <HEADLINE> PARKER ' S PLACE : GETTING SPRUNG : IT ' S THE SEASON FOR ESCAPE ; INSTINCTS KEEP THE LIFE FORCE GOING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Spring seems to induce in us human_beings a strong desire to escape . Over the past month , friends and acquaintances have lit out for Mexico , the Caymans , Belize , Baltimore , Berlin , Hawaii and London , to name a_few . Here in Orange County I ' ve run_across plenty of Mexicans , Caymanians , Belizeans , etc. , doing the same . It seems like everybody ' s either packing for a trip , asking directions to the beach or trying to cajole you into giving them a lift to LAX . For the non-human inhabitants of Earth , things are just the opposite . Reproduction is the call of the current season , and just about everything that can -- and some things that can ' t -- is intent upon the act of mating . Male sparrows livid with red feathers whiz through the sky after their desired counterparts . The lizards are literally crawling over each other , enraptured by hormones . Stinkbugs lose their balance and roll_around , connected , legs waving in an orgy of amour and odor . Even my two retrievers , long neutered and reproductively challenged , have taken_to acting_out comic love scenes at all hours of day and night . It is possible that the desire to escape and the desire to mate are actually complementary . The animals can ' t know that they ' re heading for parenthood , so you might assume that they are in it either for the pleasure -- hard to believe_in the stinkbug ' s case -- or at the behest of deep instincts against which they are helpless . At any rate , they are much closer now than they will ever be again during the year . Maybe they ' re programmed by nature to enjoy each others ' company for a finite amount_of_time , in their case all spring , before they escape into the liberties of summer without so_much as a parting glance_over their scaled , feathered or plated shoulders . But human_beings pick and choose their hours together -- in some cases , at least -- over the length of a lifetime . Maybe the primary reason people want to escape their daily lives each spring is precisely so they can mate unencumbered by routine and all_the handy reminders -- so visible around home and hearth -- that mating makes offspring and offspring make future escape difficult . This might account_for the large_number of June weddings , and it also might not . By far the best example of human escape I ' ve seen this spring was that of a young_man at a local fair who was fitted snugly into a canvas straitjacket , then wrapped tightly -- very tightly -- in maybe 30 feet of chain . The chain was snugged several times around his neck , arms and waist , then yanked up hard into his groin , around the small of his back , then over his shoulders . I watched as his tormentors cinched this chain hard , then padlocked it at various junctures to keep it chokingly taut . If they were covertly making_it easy on him , I sure couldn ' t tell . By the time they were finished securing him , a crowd had gathered to watch him try to get_out . He was a young_man , maybe 20 , and slightly built . His hair was pulled_back in a bun . He briefly addressed the gathering audience about this not being a trick , and it was easy to see the genuine duress he was under . Sweat beaded his face . His jugular_vein stood_out , as did the large blood_vessel running_up his forehead . His overall color quickly went from normal to an inflamed red as the sweat began running_off his nose in a rivulet . He was breathing hard . His voice was hoarse . He coughed . And he hadn ' t even started his escape yet . With maybe 80 people gathered close , he got_down to business . First , he stood and bent at the waist , working the muscles in his arms and torso . It was hard to tell exactly what he was doing under there , but the material of the straitjacket rose and fell like a gentle ocean swell . He dipped one shoulder , then the other . He stood straight again , face growing purple , breathed steadily for a moment , then repeated the whole process . The chain didn ' t give an inch . At this point a woman behind me noted that he hadn ' t dislocated his shoulders properly . I thought to myself that the kid was definitely heading for trouble . The canvas of his jacket was soaked in sweat , forming a large V from his clavicles to the bottom of his sternum . His hair had popped loose and was now tangled painfully with the chain . The people directly in front of the escape artist -- no more_than six feet away from him -- began to get worried looks_on their formerly festive , curious faces . Things got quiet . The escape artist fell to the ground and went_into a series of contortions . He convulsed as if his tongue was caught in an electrical outlet . You could hear the deep hiss of his breathing ; and you could hear the gasps of wonder from the crowd . The people in the front row had to look_away as he writhed before them , sweat and dried grass and agony turning his face into a mask of desperation . He jerked himself to his knees , then labored upright again . By standing on his left foot and raising his right knee as high as he could against the unforgiving chains , he managed to work one small loop of chain loose from his butt . For the next 10 minutes he tried to get his right foot through that loop and into freedom . He shook . He fell to his back . He raised his ankle to his ear . Finally , the foot slipped through and the crowd exploded into the applause of blessed relief . Of course , this only freed him from the right knee down , so he had to do all_of that again in_order to get his right knee though the loop . He did . Then , the whole process began again as he worked free his left ankle , then knee . He stood upright again , breathing very hard , the color_in his face even worse from the exertion . &quot; This is just to show you , &quot; he wheezed , &quot; that you can escape anything in life if you can stay calm and keep breathing . Just so you know , if a person stays tied_up like this for very long -- he dies . There , that ' s my positive-thinking message for the day. &quot; Someone near the back of the crowd turned_to go . &quot; Do not leave now , &quot; the escape artist ordered . &quot; You cannot leave. &quot; The reluctant witness stopped and obeyed . With his crotch unleashed and his legs fully liberated , the escape artist could arch his back and jackknife himself forward at the waist . Through several repetitions of this movement -- all done against the strictures of the straitjacket -- he managed finally to twist himself into such an angle that , when he let_out what seemed to be all_of his precious breath and leaned over , the layers of chains simply slid up his back , over his shoulders and to the ground , untouched padlocks and all . The crowd went crazy . There stood the hero , breathing heavily , eyes bulging , hair matted to his face , announcing that the straitjacket , in the opinion of experts , is much harder to escape than proletarian chains . It took him 10 minutes , a contortive eternity , to prove this . When he finally flung his canvas prison -- still fastened -- to the ground , the audience surged around him , clapping , smiling , breathing its own collective sigh of wonder . When you see someone bound , it ' s impossible not to feel that way yourself . Someone put a $ 100 bill in the escape artist ' s hat , shook his head without saying a word and walked_off . The escape artist bowed once more to the departing crowd , then collected his chains and straitjacket , the tools of his odd trade . He shook back his hair , posed for some pictures with fans , signed a_few autographs . Then he slung the gear over his shoulder and disappeared into the throng , completing his escape . He was spring itself .</TEXT>
