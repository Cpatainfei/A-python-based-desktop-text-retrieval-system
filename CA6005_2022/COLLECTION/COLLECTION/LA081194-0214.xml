   <HEADLINE> CELEBRATE THE SEA ON A JET-SKI</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He ' s known as &quot; Rad Brad &quot; on the Jet-Ski racing circuit . &quot; Freestyle is my favorite event ; there ' s jumping , tailspin and submarining , where you submerge the Jet-Ski completely under water , &quot; says Brad , nearly breathless at just the thought of it . The Jet-Ski Nationals will take_place Sunday at Long_Beach Marine Stadium as part of the monthlong 62nd annual International Sea Festival . Anyone can enter the racing competition up until 9 a.m. race morning . There are beginner , novice , expert and pro divisions . The nonstop action goes from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. , with closed-course racing held simultaneously with the slalom time trials and obstacle course . When those events take a break at 1:30 p.m. , the freestylers get two minutes each on the water to dazzle the judges . ( And don ' t worry about having to go ski-to-ski with Rad Brad : He won ' t be competing because he ' s promoting the event , and he says he can ' t do both . The first five places will get trophies in the amateur divisions ; the pros will take_home the entry purse . About 200 entries are expected . Spectator admission is $ 6 for bleacher seating ; children under 10 get_in free . For information , call ( 714 ) 493-4669 . For information on other Sea Festival events this weekend , including the Oar and Paddle Regatta , women ' s volleyball and the Catalina Ski_Race ( 8 a.m. Sunday ) , call the festival hot_line at ( 310 ) 421-9431 , Ext . 4103 .
