   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA AGREES TO CLOSE REACTORS , END PRODUCTION OF PLUTONIUM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russia has agreed to shut_down three nuclear_reactors still producing weapons-grade plutonium , Russian and U.S. officials announced Wednesday , making Russia the last of the world ' s five declared nuclear nations to stop producing fissile material for warheads . When the last plutonium is extracted from the irradiated uranium fuel rods at the Russian plants , in Tomsk and Krasnoyarsk , it will mark the first time since the beginning of the atomic age 50 years ago that none of the five major nuclear_powers will be producing the basic building_block of nuclear arms . While full implementation of the agreement is several years away , &quot; Both our governments recognize that ongoing production of these reactors makes little sense in this day and age , &quot; said U.S. Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary . &quot; Eight years ago in my most fantastic dreams I would never have imagined &quot; that Russia would stop producing plutonium for its nuclear arsenal , said Russian Atomic Energy Minister Viktor Mikhailov , appearing at a news_conference with O ' Leary . Russia , like the United States , has a surplus of plutonium recovered from dismantled warheads . Its continued production of the material has been a source of concern to the Clinton_Administration and the arms control community . In three days of talks , Mikhailov and O ' Leary concluded a deal under which Russia will shut_down the reactors as soon as alternative sources of heat for their communities are available , and the United States will help Russia find the money to pay_for the new heating_plants . In a related accord announced Tuesday night , the two countries have also agreed to permit inspections of each other ' s plutonium storage facilities . Plutonium is a byproduct of the irradiation of uranium fuel rods in nuclear_reactors .</TEXT>
