   <HEADLINE> BOOK_REVIEW / NOVEL ; MURDER-THRILLER PUTS HISTORY TO GOOD USE ; THE ALIENIST BY CALEB CARR / RANDOM HOUSE $ 22 , 496 PAGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Caleb Carr is , among other things , a historian and biographer capable of writing a monograph that reads like an adventure_story . And so it ' s no surprise that his latest book , &quot; The Alienist , &quot; is a novel that makes_good use of history in telling the tale of a 19th-Century serial_killer . &quot; The Alienist &quot; is set_in New York in 1896 , when the raw and roiling metropolis is panicked by a murderer who preys on &quot; boy-whores , &quot; luring his victims out of the brothels and leaving_behind their cruelly dismembered bodies . Beneath its rich historical trappings , however , Carr ' s novel is a breathless and sometimes brutal detective_story that carries us through mean streets and glittering mansions in pursuit of a bloodthirsty sex fiend . &quot; All the while , a voice was whispering in the back of my head , &quot; observes John Schuyler Moore , the crime reporter who serves as the narrator , &quot; ' Hurry up or a child will die ! ' &quot; An alienist , according to 19th-Century usage , is what we would now call a psychiatrist or psychologist -- and the alienist in Carr ' s book is the unforgettable Laszlo Kreizler , a gifted but troubled doctor whose use of psychological theory in the pursuit of the killer becomes a grand obsession . Kreizler , a psychiatric Sherlock_Holmes , assembles an antique ( but quite politically correct ) version of the A-team to assist him in identifying and tracking_down the killer . There ' s Moore , of course , but also an African American man named Cyrus , a former whorehouse piano man and reformed cop-killer ; a pair of comical Jewish cops who are presented as the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern of the NYPD but turn_out to be masters at everything from gross_anatomy to handwriting analysis ; and a derringer-toting secretary named Sara who invents herself as a police_detective -- and always seems to show_up when her brains and her pistol are in urgent demand . Then , too , Carr manages to decorate his story with cameo appearances by various historical personages , including Theodore Roosevelt ( &quot; Bully ! This is what I like -- a scientific approach ! &quot; ) , J.P. Morgan , William James , Lincoln Steffens and Anthony Comstock , all_of whom are given roles in an elaborate subplot that makes the murder investigation a focal_point of ward politics , mob rivalries and social turmoil in New York on the verge of the 20th Century . &quot; Let this man keep killing , &quot; cries Kreizler at one point , when archbishops , moguls and mobsters combine to suppress his investigation because they all fear the unsettling social and political implications of his psychological theories . &quot; It ' s what they want . He ' s part of their precious social order -- without such creatures they ' ve no scapegoats for their own wretched brutality ! &quot; Even more crucial to &quot; The Alienist , &quot; however , is Carr ' s marvelous use of the streets of New York as a stage on which to play_out his story of crime and punishment . Turn-of-the-century New York is rendered in glorious and intriguing detail -- Carr gives us not only the flash and glitter of a night at the opera or a 12-course midnight dinner at Delmonico ' s , but also the hellish poverty of tenement life and the medieval horrors of the lunatic asylums . Indeed , much of the story unfolds in the brothels , where 10-year-old boys are dressed_up as girls and offered_up as playthings for men with especially twisted sexual yearnings . And the particulars of how these boys live -- and , especially , how they die at the hands of the mysterious killer -- are so graphic , so bizarre , that certain passages are horrific and sometimes downright repulsive . Still , Carr manages to enlist our wholehearted sympathies for the young victims of the serial_killer and the intrepid team of self-styled detectives who pursue him , and we can hardly put aside the book until we find_out whether it is the killer or the alienist who prevails . Even if Carr ' s book sometimes resembles , say , &quot; The Seven Percent Solution , &quot; it ' s entirely successful on its own terms -- a high-spirited , charged-up and unfailingly smart thriller that puts Carr ' s scholarship to good use .</TEXT>
