   <HEADLINE> SIGHTS ; SHOW BLENDS KITSCH WITH SERIOUS WORKS ; FROM SIMPLE TO COMPLEX , ROUGH TO GENTLE , THE BUENAVENTURA COMPETITION PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF LOCAL ART , IN ALL ITS BEAUTY AND VARIETY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a reliable field report on the state of regional art , the Buenaventura Art Assn. ' s annual juried competition may take the prize -- at least in terms of democracy in action . The exhibition , filling the Buenaventura Gallery with all manner of aesthetics , attitudes and aptitudes , is nothing if not every which way . Pretty pictures and pleasant artistic visions -- often a specialty of this space -- are peaceful cohabitants with sterner stuff , art of a more probing , rougher-hewed nature . Culled through the discriminating eye of juror Ron Robertson , an assemblage artist based at Santa Barbara City College , what we get is a solid , nonpartisan overview of what makes_up art in Ventura County . Needless to say , the depths vary , but the findings are encouraging . Ventura College instructor Gerd Koch , one of the best artists in the area , displays his poetic command of the fertile ground between -- and overlapping -- abstract and landscape traditions . &quot; Spring Is Searching for Someone &quot; is , in the best sense , a painting searching for resolution . Visual beauty and compositional balance are offset by dripping rivulets of paint , creating an intriguing tension . A similar tension , though achieved with different means and having different intentions , marks Chloe Murdock ' s &quot; Nude With Wolf , &quot; one of the strongest works in the show . A narrative residue wafts in the red-suffused interior of this large painting , in which the smudged , &quot; incomplete &quot; painterly process and the presence of the subjects contribute to an aura of sinister sensuousness . Resolution and simplicity are at the heart of the first-place winner in the two-dimensional division of the competition , Sherry Loehr ' s &quot; Blue Fortune. &quot; This neatly crafted portrait of a box of fortune_cookies doubles as a study in light and color . In the same room , Donald Fay ' s &quot; Running With Old Blue &quot; is another impressive watercolor , in which the tapestry-like field is as visually striking as the dog and woman who traverse it . Plant_life and landscapes get their day in the sun in this exhibition , with diverse results . Robert Wassell depicts Santa Cruz Island with a good feel_for both the idyllic and also the mythical qualities of the island , via his crisp , stylized definitions of forms within the composition . Linda R . Wigen explores the human-like personae of drooping sunflowers with the aptly entitled &quot; Bowed Heads. &quot; Norma Robbins ' essentially abstract piece , &quot; The River Is a Strong Brown , &quot; asserts its naturalistic metaphor with undulating layers of bark-like paper . In what can seem , inevitably , like a helter-skelter collision of artworks in a group show such_as this , sometimes the more memorable pieces are those that tread lightly and speak softly . A gentle , peculiar charmer in this group , for instance , is Sally Miller ' s &quot; Pit Stop , &quot; whose subject is a rowboat amid a thicket of murky blue-green brush and water . Nostalgia and desolation are the twin emotions here . It is a humble , even homely , little painting that sits in a corner crowded out by its more extroverted peers , basking in its own muted , considerable charisma . And , quiet though it is , Jane McKinney ' s still-life &quot; Two Lemons &quot; exerts a poetic , vital appreciation of objects in space . In a rare case of sociopolitical awareness in the show , Roxie Ray shows &quot; The Harvester , &quot; one of her affectionate portraits of farm laborers -- that significant and often ignored demographic in Ventura County . Here we see a large , close-up view of a faceless picker trying to ward_off the heat with a bandanna and cap . Photography is represented , although scantly . Jurgen Kuschnik shows a wry craftiness in his work , especially in the Polaroid &quot; Peppermania , &quot; manipulated to look_like a still-life painting , and &quot; Ode to Ruth Bernhard ( Life_Savers ) , &quot; with hole-y candies casting ominous shadows . &quot; Datura Mandala , &quot; Michael Apuliese ' s photograph , transforms rolled-up textile into an animalistic presence through clever use of tight focus . In the 3-D category , the first-place ribbon went_to Shirley Ransom ' s assemblage &quot; Afterglow , &quot; in which a fire vignette is conveyed through found objects . Matches , scorched metal and fabric , and a ghostly image of resilient cockroaches tell the story in a roundabout_way . Christine Hanson ' s wily &quot; The Occupant &quot; plays_up contrasting forms and textures with a leathery serpent slithering through a solid block of wood . For the most part , this show ' s theme -- if there is one to be gleaned -- is about innocent pursuits of beauty and the good life . That sentimental strain is epitomized in Patricia Robinson ' s oil_painting , &quot; Feeling Fall , &quot; a pumpkin-patch scene with a harmless allure . And what ' s wrong with a show in which kitsch is liberally stirred in with stronger cultural ingredients ? All in all , it ' s a big , happy , messy family of art from our midst , worth looking_at . ART BY DEFAULT One of the more oddly fascinating exhibitions in a local museum of late relates to art only tangentially . The show at the Ventura County Museum of History and Art is called , with canny accuracy , &quot; Making Life Easier : Tools , Household Technology and Office Equipment , 1870-1930. &quot; What ' s really on display here is a provocative slice from the evolution of convenience and better-mousetrap building . Who would have thought that a gallery full of antique typewriters , washing_machines ( the 1927 Maytag is an immaculate beaut ) , vintage planes and other artifacts geared toward the easier life would have such appeal ? These functional , quotidian objects of yesteryear -- divided by curators Tim Schiffer and Barbara Schwartzberg into tools and appliances for the home , office and farm -- have , by now , taken_on a more refined aesthetic character . We view them now as highly physical , surprisingly elegant and amusingly improbable implements with a strange resemblance to art , by default . Blame it on the residual beauty of obsolescence . This show handsomely underscores the point that everyday objects eventually transform into either junk , art -- or both .
