   <HEADLINE> MALAYSIAN CENSORS MOVE TO BAN ' LIST ' ; MOVIES : GOVERNMENT BODY IN MUSLIM NATION CALLS SPIELBERG ' S HOLOCAUST FILM ' PROPAGANDA. ' JEWISH GROUPS ARE OUTRAGED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Steven Spielberg ' s movie &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; may have won seven Academy Awards , but the film has been banned from being shown in the Muslim nation of Malaysia , provoking outrage among Jewish groups around the world . United International Pictures , the film ' s distributor overseas , Wednesday released a letter from the Malaysian board of film censors that said the film reflects &quot; the privilege and the virtues of a certain race only. &quot; The letter , which was written in the Malay language and translated by the company , called the movie &quot; propaganda with the purpose of asking_for sympathy as well as_to tarnish the other race. &quot; Spielberg ' s film , which was named best picture at Monday ' s Academy Awards , is the World_War_II story of a Gentile businessman who saves more_than 1 # 000 Jews from being sent to Nazi extermination camps . * The government ' s film censor , Zainun Bin Saleh , said that Malaysian regulations required 25 deletions involving &quot; scenes of sex , cruelty , horror and obscene dialogue. &quot; Michael Williams-Jones , the president of United International , said in a telephone_interview from London that he found the Malaysian decision shocking . &quot; The reasons given were very , very troubling , &quot; he said . Tom Pollock , chairman of the MCA Motion_Picture Group , said of the Malaysian ban that &quot; we don ' t believe_in censorship in any territory. &quot; Pollock said that films &quot; get banned all_the time &quot; but rarely on the kind of grounds cited by the Malaysians . Malaysia , a nation of 18 million people , is about 60 % Muslim . The government of Prime_Minister Mahathir Mohammed has been an especially outspoken critic of Israel and Zionism . The ban provoked an immediate outcry from Jewish groups stretching from Los Angeles to Australia . The American Jewish Committee described the decision as a &quot; shock and an outrage. &quot; &quot; We are saddened but not surprised by this deplorable decision , which is in keeping with the longstanding anti-Semitism expressed by the prime_minister of the country , &quot; said Rabbi Abraham Cooper , associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles . Cooper said that Mahathir served as an example of &quot; anti-Semitism without Jews &quot; because only a handful of Jews live_in Malaysia . &quot; For years now , the Jewish people and Judaism have been vilified by his bigotry , &quot; Cooper said . Asked Wednesday about whether he approved the banning of the film , Mahathir said he wasn ' t familiar_with the specific details of the case . But he added , &quot; It is our right to ban any film in this country. &quot; Asked to comment on allegations that he is an anti-Semite , Mahathir replied , &quot; I am not anti-Semitic . I am anti-Zionist expansionism and conquest of Arab territories by the Zionists , &quot; he said . Deputy Prime_Minister Anwar Ibrahim said later Wednesday the ban would be reviewed . &quot; It was the view of the censorship board and I think some of us will have to take it up . I don ' t think that is the final_decision , &quot; he told reporters . Most of the nations of Southeast_Asia , even including such free-wheeling countries as Thailand , impose film censorship in some form . Explicit sex and extreme violence are either chopped out , or films are banned outright . In fact , the Philippines initially refused to allow &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; to be shown without deletions of bare breasts and a scene showing a couple making_love . Spielberg refused to permit deletions in the film , and it was going_to be withdrawn until President Fidel Ramos overruled the censorship board and ordered it released . It is showing to capacity audiences . Indonesia , the world ' s largest Muslim country , has yet to decide whether to allow the film to be shown . Singapore , which also imposes strict censorship , is showing the film uncut , though it has an adults-only rating because of the sex scenes . Singaporeans appealed in the press Wednesday for the age to be lowered . A Malaysian newspaper , Utusan Malaysia , published a column under a pseudonym in which the author urged the government to reverse its decision and permit the film to be shown . The columnist argued that what happened to the Jews under the Nazis is &quot; currently happening to Muslims in Bosnia , &quot; and therefore the Malaysian people should have a chance to see what &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; is all about . United International said the company has appealed the ban and a hearing will be held_on April 12 . Company officials said that a number of films had been banned in Malaysia in the past for sexual content or graphic violence , and that the company had withdrawn others rather than submit them to extensive editing . The company added that &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; is currently drawing capacity audiences in Turkey , another Muslim country , but said it has not submitted the movie to Persian_Gulf countries such_as Saudi_Arabia and Kuwait .</TEXT>
