   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : TV NETWORKS EVOLVE FROM DINOSAURS TO DARLINGS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Has the future been postponed ? It may seem like old times with television networks pulling_in massive advertising dollars -- along with takeover feelers from Time Warner , Disney , Turner Broadcasting and ITT Corp. , all_of which are looking_at a price_tag of $ 5 billion and more for NBC . The new movie , &quot; Quiz Show , &quot; looks_back to the golden 1950s , when folks gathered round the family TV_set . And many analysts today are looking in the same direction , saying there ' s nothing like a network -- NBC , CBS , ABC or Fox -- for delivering advertising to a mass market . Only yesterday , the same networks were regarded_as dinosaurs in the age of new media . Now , the new age itself is not so sure . At a digital media conference organized by Technologic Computer Letter last week , the talk was that interactive , 500-channel , do-it-yourself cyberspace will take longer to arrive . Meanwhile , advertisers this summer put_up $ 4.4 billion in_advance to buy_time on network TV in the new season . A 30-second spot on &quot; Home Improvement &quot; -- if you could buy a spot on that sold-out show -- would cost you $ 225 # 000 . The numbers are so attractive that Paramount and Warner Bros . are trying to organize networks of_their_own . Has the future been delayed ? No . Technology is moving forward as fast as ever . But what has not been recognized is that it may favor TV networks . You have to know what to watch for and how to interpret it . Think , for example , about the implications of personal_computers hooking into television_sets , as a new Compaq model and IBM ' s forthcoming Activa home computers can . No great technical advance yet ; you can watch CNN while working_on your spreadsheet . But in the future , you ' ll be able to store programs and manipulate televised information in your home computer . What about advertising ? Everybody is speculating about the future of television , but a far more immediate question is the future of advertising , a $ 300-billion worldwide industry . Computerized TV may favor direct marketing , which is now a mail and phone-call business , or an adaptation of newspaper classified advertising . Most surprising , the networks may be technology ' s darling . Signal compression , a feature of digital television which is coming_in the next four years , could allow networks to broadcast three or four separate channels on the frequency range that now contains just a single channel . Thus , ABC might offer all-sports and all-news channels along with a conventional entertainment service . Broadcast networks could offer as much variety in one package as several cable channels do now . &quot; Networks , after all , are essentially packagers of information , &quot; notes William Ebeling Jr . of Braxton Associates , a division of the accounting_firm Deloitte &amp; Touche , which has published a study on the multimedia age . Are the bidders for NBC and other networks aware of the technological possibilities ? Probably . Smart people have been going_for networks : Rupert Murdoch , who has built the Fox network ; cable pioneer Ted Turner ; Gerald Levin of Time Warner ; Disney Studios ' Michael Eisner . On the other hand , smart people also seem ready to sell . General Electric ' s Jack Welch is shopping NBC , and CBS ' Laurence Tisch and ABC ' s principal owner , investor Warren Buffett , have shown themselves amenable to deals , too . Buffett expressed disenchantment with media investments four years ago , writing that , because of increased cable channels and direct mail , &quot; advertising dollars are more widely dispersed and the pricing power of ad vendors has diminished. &quot; And so had the value of media investments , he added . Still , Buffett ' s holding company , Berkshire Hathaway , has made gains of more_than $ 2 billion in Cap Cities / ABC stock and retains 20 million shares . But his point about advertising is borne_out by the fact that this year ' s advertiser surge into network TV does not signal a return to the days when soap and toothpaste makers Procter &amp; Gamble and Colgate dominated programming with massive ad budgets . Such companies have cut_back TV advertising , explains analyst James Dougherty of Dean Witter , and now use much of their budgets_for promotion deals with supermarkets to display their products and coupons and cents-off sales to attract customers . The world has changed . Consumers today are very price conscious and less impressed with brand names and fancy ads than with costs on the shelf . Thus the business of &quot; delivering eyeballs to the advertiser , &quot; as television was once defined , is in transition -- and will evolve further , as &quot; viewers &quot; gain even more control through computers over what they watch and when . Advertising will have to reach such customers one at a time , because they ' re the opposite of a mass market . And that could spell trouble for public companies that now lead the advertising industry -- WPP Group , Interpublic , Omnicom , Foote Cone &amp; Belding -- if they can ' t reinvent their business . But if ad budgets aren ' t growing , why the enthusiasm for TV networks ? Short term , it ' s based on the fact that the future isn ' t here yet , and that the old model still works occasionally , notes analyst Alan Gottesman of PaineWebber . Networks remain the only medium that can reach 61 % of America ' s 94.2-million homes_in a single broadcast . Longer term , however , the networks , which are unique in their ability to produce and distribute programs through local stations all_over the country -- and increasingly the world -- are turning_into updated versions of traditional movie studios . And that ' s why it ' s those very Hollywood studios that are bidding for and organizing networks in the new age , where in the 1950s it was the mass advertisers along New York ' s Madison Avenue that engineered the development of the TV business . As ever , times change .</TEXT>
