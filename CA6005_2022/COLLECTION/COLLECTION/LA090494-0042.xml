   <HEADLINE> BREAKING THE SILENCE ; THE SILENT ANGEL , BY HEINRICH BO LL . TRANSLATED FROM THE GERMAN BY BREON MITCHELL ( ST . MARTIN ' S PRESS : $ 19.95 ; 182 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When I was growing_up as a girl in the silence of postwar Germany , Heinrich Boll wrote_about what other adults would n ' t speak about . From him -- not from my family or teachers -- I began to learn about German soldiers , about war_widows and war orphans , about the impact of the war on the survivors . It was a time when most Germans were using their energies to forget the war , to push_forward into a clean and tidy future by rebuilding bombed_out buildings , by creating a history for their children that would make_it impossible for them to ask questions about the war . I took Boll ' s books with me to Catholic boarding school as an adolescent , packed them into my suitcase when I immigrated to America as an 18-year-old . When Boll died in 1985 -- a Nobel laureate and internationally acclaimed author -- the manuscript of his first novel , &quot; Der Engel Schwieg &quot; ( &quot; The Silent Angel &quot; ) had lain unpublished for 34 years . It would remain unpublished for another seven years , before it would be presented to German readers and become a major success . This stark and brilliant novel of a German soldier ' s return from the war , came_to publishers in 1950 , when it simply did not fit into the German practice of silence . Boll , who had only published one novella so far , promised in his letter of submission : &quot; Nothing is told about the war itself , and hardly anything is said about the postwar period . . . . The novel simply portrays the people of the time and their hunger . . . a generation that knows that there is no home for them on this earth. &quot; Boll ' s protagonist , the soldier Hans Schnitzler , never reveals what he did_in the war . Hans simply does not think_about the war . And yet , he is surrounded by the evidence of war , by the untold horrors that manifest themselves in the destroyed landscape , in the gray-faced survivors who move through their days like shadow phantoms , in the heavy and sour and cold air , and in the desperate drive of hunger . The first bread Hans eats upon his return from the war is given to him in a hospital by a nun . It is stale ; yet , to him it tastes sweet . &quot; While he ate with his right_hand he held the loaf fast in his left , as if someone might come and try to take it from him , and he saw his hand lying on the bread , thin and dirty , with a deep scratch that was soiled and scabbed. &quot; The day of receiving his orders for military_training is far more vivid in Hans ' mind than the war . &quot; That first tormented afternoon seemed to him worse than the entire war. &quot; Boll ' s portrayal of Hans Schnitzler ' s mother evokes the sorrow of every woman who has ever lost a child to war . Hans remembers his mother ' s sob when he received the registered postcard with his orders that summon him to Adenbruck , a &quot; long , dry sob . . . a sob that contained everything , all_the horror not one of them could have known about then. &quot; Though his body tries to survive in a country that has suddenly been thrown into peace , his soul mourns his survival . He envies the dead , because to go_on living is so_much worse . &quot; Your husband stole my death , &quot; he tells a woman whose husband saved him by trading uniforms with him before Hans could be shot as a deserted by the Germans . &quot; I couldn ' t have that quick , clean death ; he had to take it for himself . . . . He ' d made a good bargain. &quot; Hans is not the only one who would have chosen death over life . He meets Regina Unger , a war_widow , who too was left_behind in life when her infant son was killed by a German machine_gun . In their encounter , Boll creates a brittle , intense love between two people who are bewildered that they still are capable of love . Love is not part of wanting for them because their wanting has been focused_on death and food and warmth . Breon Mitchell ' s translation from German into English is strong and accurate . Mitchell , who also translated Kafka ' s &quot; The Trial , &quot; stays as close as possible to the pattern of Boll ' s language , preserving the original austerity of the novel . Though &quot; The Silent Angel &quot; was initially rejected for publication , the material stayed alive for Boll , who worked themes and details from the manuscript into some of his future works . Given Boll ' s letter to his publisher , it might be intriguing to speculate if indeed it is his character , Hans Schnitzler , who has blocked his memories of the war , or if this became an authorial decision in_order to find a readership . After all , Boll was desperately poor and worried because he could not support his family with his writing . &quot; My wife can ' t take any more , I can ' t take any more , &quot; he wrote to his friend , Paul Schaaf . &quot; I ' ve simply undertaken something impossible. &quot; And yet , considering the impressive body of Boll ' s later work and his unwavering commitment to explore the consequences of the war , it seems to me that despite his letter to his publisher , Boll knew that &quot; The Silent Angel &quot; was about the war , that he intended it to be about the war . Because the war is there . In every description . In every gesture . In every silence .</TEXT>
