   <HEADLINE> POSTCARD FROM CYBERSPACE / DANIEL AKST : THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; WORLD WIDE WEB BROWSING FOR THE HAVES AND HAVE-NOTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you really want to understand what all_the hubbub is about when people talk_about the information superhighway , find someone whose computer is connected directly to the Internet -- at a university or corporate site , perhaps -- and ask to see Mosaic . This is the software that makes_it possible to browse the wonders of the Internet ' s World Wide Web , complete with text , pictures and sound . Mosaic means virtually instant access to an ever-expanding world of information , including even video , whenever you want it . It ' s awesome . The trouble is , most of us can ' t use Mosaic . We access the Internet by dialing it via modem , without the high-powered connection needed for Mosaic , and must content ourselves with browsing the Web via a text-based system known as Lynx . Indeed , the Internet is fast becoming a land of haves and have-nots in this department , a Calvinistic universe in which the elect flit from site to site all_over the world , tasting the sights and sounds in full color and casually following information links wherever they might lead . The unlucky rest are left to make_do with text and arcane commands . ( The really unlucky , who don ' t know how to use the Internet at all , are forced instead to spend time with their families , read books and do God knows what else with their time. ) Sooner or later there ' ll be enough bandwidth to bring something like Mosaic to everybody ' s screen , but frankly , I can ' t wait . Thus , from time to time in this space we ' ll test some of the ways Internet access vendors , software makers and others are trying to make the Internet easier to use via something like Mosaic . Consider , for example , NetCruiser , the new Internet access software supplied by Netcom to work with its special NetCruiser dial-up accounts . Netcom is the Internet access service that many on the ' net love to hate . The company has grown fast by offering complete Internet access with no time charges for the rock-bottom price of $ 17.50 a month . But there are whole newsgroups practically filled with complaints about Netcom -- busy signals , overburdened servers , poor technical support and so forth . These problems are real , but I think Netcom has improved a good_deal in the past year , and if you don ' t need a lot of hand-holding it offers full Internet access at a bargain . NetCruiser is a Windows package intended to make the Net accessible to users who can ' t handle the command_line_interface from which the Internet is typically accessed . It puts a pretty face on gopher , Pine , telnet , ftp and all_the other stuff familiar to Internet users . Perhaps most important , it is a full World Wide Web_browser , sort of like Mosaic . So far , unfortunately , NetCruiser leaves a lot to be desired . In handling mail , for example , it doesn ' t let you read or write messages off line -- a valuable feature of the Windows interfaces offered by CompuServe and America Online . I didn ' t like the way it handles Internet newsgroups , either . The reader it uses is unthreaded , meaning a series of messages on the same topic are not automatically pulled_together . Furthermore , it ' s slow . It ' s greased lightning next to the Web_browser , though . I mean , I could practically hear my beard growing as I waited for some of those screens to come_in . Netcom says this is_due to NetCruiser itself , which it hopes to speed_up ; the bottleneck posed by 14 # 400 bps modems and regular phone_lines and the tendency of various computers on the Internet to be busy . As a hopeful user , I found these reasons cold comfort , especially since a NetCruiser account costs more . NetCruiser was just too slow for me at 14 # 400 bps . Netcom promises 28 # 800 bps in the New Year and if Santa does his part , I ' ll have the hardware to try it out at that speed . Meanwhile , I ' m keeping my conventional Netcom account . Windows users who have dial-up accounts should try a share ware package called SlipKnot , which functions as a rudimentary terminal program with a built-in Web_browser . It ' s rather amazing that it works_at all , and in fact it works pretty well . I used it to take a World Wide Web tour of the Kremlin , starting with a map and following up with a visit to Red Square . SlipKnot wisely avoids taking_over the functions of gopher , Pine , etc. , all_of which are easy-to-use , text-based applications that work beautifully just as they are . Nor does_it require you to get some_other kind of Internet account . Be forewarned , though : SlipKnot too is agonizingly slow , too slow for everyday use at 14 # 400 bps . But it ' s a nice way to see what you ' re missing out there on the Internet -- and to sample what inevitably lies ahead . BTW : On the subject of digital cash , covered in a recent column , USC ' s Information_Sciences Institute has released for testing its own NetCheque payment system . Developed by ISI scientist Clifford Neuman , it is designed to bring the equivalent of secure &quot; bank_checks &quot; to the Internet . ISI also has its own version of NetCash in the works . For information , e-mail netcheque.isi.edu. ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Getting the Programs NetCruiser can be obtained by mailing crz4me.ix.netcom.com. A NetCruiser account is $ 19.95 for 40 &quot; prime &quot; hours per month plus unlimited access from midnight to 9 a.m. Monday through Friday , and all day Saturday and Sunday . Prime hours after the first 40 are $ 2.00 each . For more information about SlipKnot , by MicroMind Inc. , e-mail slipknot.micromind.com. The program is available by anonymous_ftp from ftp.netcom.com ( get slnot100.zip in pub / pbrooks / slipknot subdirectory ) .</TEXT>
