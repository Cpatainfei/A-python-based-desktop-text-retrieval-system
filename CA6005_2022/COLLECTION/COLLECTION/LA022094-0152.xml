   <HEADLINE> EYES ON A COSMIC PRIZE ; ARIANNA HUFFINGTON WANTS TO DO MORE THAN HELP HER HUSBAND WIN A SEAT IN THE SENATE . SHE IS ALSO TRYING TO RAISE POLITICS TO A HIGHER PLANE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Arianna Stassinopolous Huffington was framed_in American flags . To her right drooped Old_Glory . To her left , the California bear . Before her was splayed a veritable cornucopia of Orange County Young Republicans . Summoning all_the wit and finesse she had earned long ago as head of the Cambridge_University debating society , the elegant author , socialite and congressional spouse set to work_on her unsuspecting audience . Her mission : to nudge the Grand Old Party into examining its collective soul . And , oh yes , help her husband , Michael , win Democrat Dianne Feinstein ' s Senate seat in November . &quot; It is not enough for ( President ) Clinton to fail for us to succeed , &quot; she said to the hushed hotel function room in Costa Mesa , the heart of California Republican-land and home to Michael Huffington for Senate headquarters . &quot; Ultimately , we need to provide the American people with an alternate vision. &quot; Huffington , 43 , statuesque in a Carolina Herrera pleated brown suit and auburn coif , laid_out her case . Cribbing from her startling speech -- &quot; Can Conservatives Have a Social Conscience ? &quot; -- that gently chastened a National Review magazine conference in Washington a year ago , Huffington reminded her fellow social_policy critics that if government were to drop the welfare ball , they would all do_well to pick it up . In Huffington ' s ideal future , a &quot; critical mass &quot; of spiritually inclined citizens would succeed where government had failed , volunteering time and money en masse to care_for the tired and poor . &quot; I see it as a scientific equivalent of grace , &quot; she said in velvet tones laced with hints of her native Greece . &quot; We do our part and God meets us halfway . that ' s why I ' m a conservative . Because conservatives believe_in the individual. &quot; The wife of the Santa Barbara Republican opened the floor to questions . Despite her inch-by-inch , speech-by-speech campaign aimed at nothing less than a spiritual overhaul of the Republican_Party and eventually the country , her speech whizzed by the kempt heads of her audience . Instead of marching toward the millennium as spiritual soldiers defending a shrinking government , they seemed like holdouts from the Me Generation . What was Michael ' s position on federal taxes ? And the National Endowment for the Arts ? And , from a young Republican in a tight blond bun , what does he plan to do about illegal immigration -- &quot; since you ' re an immigrant &quot; ? &quot; Obviously , people are preoccupied with the obvious political issues , &quot; Huffington said later . &quot; I think when you expand the political debate to areas which are not the traditional issues of crime , economy and jobs , they ' re more likely to ask questions about what they ' re familiar_with . &quot; But I don ' t see it as an indication that they ' re not listening . I intend to spend the next months drumming that message up and down the state. &quot; Some observers believe the Huffingtons ' sights include far more_than California . Noting Michael ' s quick bid for the Senate after less than two years in the House , they speculate that the couple has its eyes on the ultimate political prize -- the presidency . &quot; What is interesting is the way people think that you want to be in the White_House , &quot; Huffington said in an interview , perched on a pastel couch in their L.A. pied a terre . &quot; To me , that is a very small ambition . There are many people who have been in the White_House and have achieved nothing dramatic . What we are talking_about is a crusade , which is so_much bigger than being in the White_House . . . to achieve this critical mass that can change our country . &quot; In that sense , my quote unquote ambitions are a lot larger than the ones people are assigning to me , and larger in the sense that they ' re not personal. &quot; If Huffington fails to enlist a country ' s worth of eager recruits , it won ' t be for want of trying . In May , Simon &amp; Schuster will publish her manifesto , &quot; The Fourth Instinct : The Call of the Soul. &quot; Huffington ' s sixth book argues that big government cheats people out of the spiritual rewards of giving to the needy . The book , a cable-TV show , as well as the recruitment soirees she calls &quot; critical mass &quot; dinners and the Senate_race are the latest salvos in Huffington ' s longstanding and sometimes controversial campaign to mesh ostensible opposites -- spirituality and the halls of power . Her latest bout is winning praise from fellow conservatives and spiritual_leaders . Film critic Michael Medved , who appeared on National Empowerment Television ' s &quot; Critical Mass &quot; to discuss Hollywood as an enemy of traditional values , applauded her efforts to be &quot; inclusive in assembling this critical mass. &quot; &quot; She ' s being inclusive in the political spectrum and within the religious world . I think she ' s going_out of her way to work together with people from every kind of faith and community rather than rooting it firmly in one aspect of that community or another , &quot; he said . But Huffington raised eyebrows in an earlier campaign she waged on behalf of New Age leader John-Roger , the former Rosemead schoolteacher and founder of Insight and the Movement of Spiritual Inner Awareness ( MSIA ) . Huffington , herself an MSIA minister , tapped her social contacts in the mid- ' 80s to woo high_society proponents to John-Roger ' s cause , holding recruitment dinners that sandwiched socialites between acolytes . &quot; I had him thrust upon me by her , &quot; nationally syndicated columnist Liz Smith said . &quot; He really sort of gave me the creeps . He wanted to lay hands on me because I had a headache and it was very dismaying and embarrassing to me . And also I thought he was a fake. &quot; In those days , Huffington publicly reveled in her connection to John-Roger . In a 1985 article for Interview magazine , she wrote : &quot; He dealt in the only thing that I was really interested in : helping people wake_up to the spirit inside themselves , to their natural knowing and inner wisdom . I bought his books ( ranging from ' The Inner Worlds of Meditation ' to ' Sex , Spirit and You ' ) ; I subscribed_to his monthly discourses ; I went_to meditation retreats. &quot; John-Roger , whose foundation is based in Santa Monica , declared himself the embodiment of a Christlike entity called &quot; Mystical Traveler Consciousness. &quot; But in the late ' 80s , he came under_fire in the press for allegedly sexually seducing followers with spiritual promises , being hypocritical about the vow of poverty that kept him from paying taxes and being cavalier with church funds . He denied the charges . Both Huffingtons now soft-pedal Arianna ' s connection to John-Roger , whom she met in London in 1973 . She says that they see each other socially and that she last took a seminar a year ago , &quot; although I would be glad to take one if I had the time. &quot; &quot; John-Roger is a friend , &quot; said Huffington , a member of the Greek Orthodox Church . &quot; And I get a lot of_value from his seminars and his books . Why he ' s so attacked and why people are trying to present him as some kind of guru figure , I really don ' t know. &quot; Michael Huffington , 46 , an Episcopalian who doesn ' t share her interest in John-Roger , said : &quot; It was before I met her , so I wasn ' t knowledgeable . I think John-Roger is a friend of hers . that ' s about all I really know about it. &quot; In fact , while &quot; The Fourth Instinct &quot; quotes myriad sources , nowhere does John-Roger ' s name appear . Huffington says he influenced her book &quot; no more_than hundreds of people , ranging from Jung and the Bible to friends who have been_on some kind of spiritual path. &quot; In addition to John-Roger , she has befriended Werner Erhard and sampled est . Republicans perceive her critical mass campaign as compatible with mainstream conservative views . Linking spirituality with politics &quot; is a two-edged sword , &quot; said Howard Hull , former president of the Orange County Young Republicans . &quot; It can be linked to extremism and linked to moderation . Moderation is , ' I may be very religious , I may be Christian , but I have Muslim friends and friends of the Jewish faith. ' that ' s no problem . Extremism is , ' It ' s my way or the highway. ' But I don ' t see that at all . Her views are right along party lines. &quot; Nonetheless , questions about Huffington ' s connection to John-Roger linger in the press as the couple raises its political sights and stakes . Bob Colacello , who investigated their relationship for Vanity_Fair in 1986 , said : &quot; If she ' s sincere in her New Age beliefs , then she ' s not very bright , and if she is very bright , then I don ' t see how she could be sincere in believing some of the things that she claims to believe . To me , that ' s the paradox of Arianna Stassinopolous Huffington . &quot; My real issue with her as a political figure , as someone who is married to a man with great political ambitions -- and they both have admitted they influence each other tremendously , as do every husband and wife -- is I don ' t understand what her spiritualism is about , and it frightens me to think that this kind of fuzzy but all-encompassing spiritualism could have an influence on our politics , on our government. &quot; * Huffington ' s spiritual yearnings go way back to her childhood in Greece . She says she remembers praying to the_Virgin Mary unbidden at the age of 3 . Thus began a spiritual journey that took 16-year-old Arianna to Shantaniketan University , outside Calcutta , where she studied comparative religions . The next year , she moved with her mother -- divorced from her journalist father -- to England to prepare_for university entrance exams . At Cambridge , Arianna Stassinopolous was a star , making media waves as the first foreigner and third woman to head the Cambridge Union -- the same year another female foreigner , Benazir Bhutto , headed the rival Oxford debate team . For her farewell debate , she skewered late- ' 70s feminism for ignoring &quot; a woman ' s special needs &quot; for children and family . Her televised address prompted English publisher Reg Davis-Poynter to offer her a book deal . Considered an answer to &quot; The Female Eunuch , &quot; her 1973 book was called &quot; The Female Woman. &quot; She was attacked for being anti-feminist , even though she supported equal rights and work opportunities for women . The first book also made her a celebrity author fresh out of school . And she says she was_on book tour in Detroit when she was struck by the emptiness of her early success . &quot; Everything went_wrong . I was_on my own . I got_to the hotel , and there was a line of 200 GIs checking in , so I had to wait . Then I got_into my room , and it was the tiniest little room , a postage_stamp that smelled of cigarette smoke , and there I was . I had nothing to do that night and I had to leave at 5 in the morning to go_on an early morning talk_show , and I suddenly felt this total , utter depression and despair . What am I doing here ? &quot; She returned from her tour , drew the drapes of her London apartment and embarked_on a long water fast -- &quot; mostly because I so wanted to touch the spirit , to be filled by it , that anything that was not spirit or about spirit was an encumbrance , &quot; she writes in &quot; The Fourth Instinct. &quot; She ultimately realized that starvation was no solution , &quot; although not before I could , blindfolded , tell the difference between sipsful of the various brands of bottled water I had in my flat. &quot; In 1979 , she published her second and least successful book , the scholarly &quot; After Reason. &quot; Although the difficult book was little read , it held the seeds of her current campaign . In it , she argued that 20th-Century prosperity failed to satisfy mankind ' s deepest needs for meaning , and that a spiritual revolution was in the offing . &quot; I saw myself more as a polemicist , &quot; she said . But her career reputation was soon sealed as a biographer . Already a fixture of English society , her connections led to the book contract that changed her as a writer . Her friend , publisher George Weidenfeld , suggested that she write a biography of Maria Callas soon after the singer ' s death , partly because the two Greek women bore a certain resemblance . The 1981 book , &quot; Maria Callas : The Woman Behind the Legend , &quot; was an international bestseller , displaying her talent for unearthing the stormy personal details of her subjects ' lives . Her Callas biography stated that the singer ' s longtime lover , Aristotle Onassis , was planning to divorce Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis , whom he called &quot; cold-hearted and shallow , &quot; shortly before his death . * She went_to New York to promote &quot; Maria Callas &quot; and immediately felt as though she had arrived home . She settled there in the early ' 80s and took the town by social storm . &quot; I definitely had a very social 3 1 / 2 years . They gave me the sobriquet of socialite and I earned it ! &quot; she said with a laugh . Barbara Walters served as her bridesmaid and is godmother to her oldest daughter . &quot; The word special is extremely overused , but she ' s a very special person , &quot; Walters said of Huffington . &quot; She is very brilliant , very sensitive . She ' s wonderful looking . I feel she has a conscience and a caring. &quot; One person ' s special person is another one ' s social_climber , and Huffington has been criticized for being socially ambitious . Still , even her critics say they like her . &quot; I think Arianna became very famous very young , &quot; said John O ' Sullivan , editor of the National Review and a friend dating_back to her London days . &quot; She conquered London in the ' 70s , New York in the ' 80s and is now doing the same on the West Coast in the ' 90s . People with this kind of drive and success are always going_to incite envy , but she ' s basically good-natured and level-headed . She ' s never been deceived by success and put_off by envy. &quot; Said journalist Colacello : &quot; I think she ' s a highly desirable dinner-party guest . She ' s intelligent . She ' s articulate . She ' s beautiful . She knows how to really focus in on what the other person is saying . She ' s a great , great flatterer and we ' ve all been seduced by it . &quot; I think she ' s a fascinating character and I would n ' t be surprised if she does reach the top or get pretty damn near to it . Because she is relentless . Because she does have the discipline of a religious zealot . Because she has a very rich husband . Because she ' s smart. &quot; In 1984 , Huffington moved to Beverly Hills . An important California friend was Francoise Gilot , wife of Jonas Salk and Pablo Picasso ' s former longtime mistress and the mother of two of his children . Huffington had sought her out for her new biography of Picasso , and her scathing memories of abuse helped fuel the fire that swirled around the author ' s 1988 book , &quot; Picasso : Creator and Destroyer. &quot; The critics ' reaction was ferocious . Newsweek called it &quot; one-sided and hate-filled &quot; and the New York Times sniffed : &quot; Mrs . Huffington writes_about Picasso ' s life as though she were breathlessly narrating a trashy novel. &quot; Huffington seems to relish the furor . &quot; I think the reaction went much deeper than just challenging an idol like Picasso , &quot; she said . &quot; I sum_up what I believe about art , and why I don ' t believe Picasso was as great an artist as Shakespeare and Mozart and Rembrandt . &quot; For me , really great art transcends the darkness , but if you look_at a lot of Picasso ' s late art or if you look_at Francis Bacon , it ' s like the crucifixion without the resurrection . Everything is dark. &quot; * The most influential friend from that period may have the socially prominent Ann Getty , another Weidenfeld contact . She took_on the project of getting the thirtysomething Stassinopolous married , and during a 1985 flight drew_up a list of prospects for her friend , among them conductor Claudio Abbado . A week later , Getty met Michael Huffington in Tokyo at a board_meeting of the Aspen Institute , a nonpartisan think_tank . &quot; Michael thought his idea of who he was going_to marry was somebody blond and in her early 20s and willing to have five children . He said to her , ' You ' re so wonderful . Do you have any daughters ? ' &quot; And Ann said , ' I don ' t have any daughters , but I have a great friend . She ' s not blond and she ' s not in her 20s. ' And she called me and told me she had met the man I was going_to marry. &quot; Getty orchestrated a three-day blind_date -- with other people , including Huffington ' s friend , Dole Chairman David Murdock . They attended the San Francisco Opera , threading the days with lunches and dinners . &quot; I immediately saw her as my soul_mate , &quot; Huffington said . &quot; When we met , I said , ' What ' s the most important thing in your life ? ' She said , ' God. ' &quot; They married seven months later -- in April , 1986 -- and Vanity_Fair called their Park_Avenue wedding &quot; the one people are still talking_about &quot; in a banner wedding year that included Prince Andrew ' s and Caroline Kennedy ' s . The 400-person guest list consisted_of a melange of high_society and John-Roger followers . Huffington wore a Galanos dress variously reported as costing $ 18 # 000 to $ 35 # 000 , and she was flanked by bridesmaids who included Walters and Lucky Roosevelt , President Reagan ' s White_House chief of protocol . The reception was testimony to the bride ' s talent for friendship -- Getty paid_for it . Henry Kissinger has been widely quoted as saying the wedding had &quot; everything except an Aztec sacrificial fire dance , &quot; although Huffington says that was apocryphal . * Michael Huffington ' s family had been prominent in Houston , where his father , Roy , made the family fortune by founding an oil_company , Roy M . Huffington Inc. , a.k.a. Huffco . The Huffington coffers have been estimated at $ 350 million . Huffington says she sees no contradiction between living a life that ' s both luxurious and spiritual : &quot; I don ' t think having a beautiful home or having beautiful things is a problem in itself . Far from it . It ' s the difference between being in the background of your life or being in the foreground. &quot; The couple settled in a $ 4-million Italian villa in Montecito . They ' ve stopped giving interviews there in the wake of accusations that the freshman congressman bought his seat by outspending his opponent , nine-term Republican Rep . Bob Lagomarsino . Huffington spent $ 3 million on the primary , more_than any other congressional candidate in the country ' s history . Huffington denies that the home has become a political liability . &quot; Look_at Ross Perot , &quot; she said . &quot; He does all his interviews in his home or his private plane . I think Perot used his wealth to show he ' s independent , to show he can ' t be bought , that he ' s not in politics for reasons of personal gain . So it ' s not a campaign consideration. &quot; Indeed , the Huffingtons don ' t at all mind Michael ' s sobriquet , &quot; Perot-by-the-Sea. &quot; With their voluntarism spin on it , they ' ve founded the Partnership for the Children of Santa Barbara , which provides medical_care , partly with the help of Michael ' s first-year congressional salary -- $ 133 # 600 . Huffington says her concern for children stems in part from her love for her own -- Christina , 4 1 / 2 , and Isabella , 2 1 / 2 . She says motherhood has been a profoundly transforming experience . And in &quot; The Fourth Instinct , &quot; she reveals that she had an out-of-body experience a_few hours after Christina ' s birth : &quot; We put her in a crib next to my bed . A few moments later , after everyone had left the room , I began trembling convulsively . . . . And then my body was no longer shaking . I had left it . I was looking down at myself , at Christina , at the tuberoses on the night stand , at the entire room . &quot; I had no fear at all . . . . I knew I would return . And I was being washed in a sense of enormous well-being and strength . It was as if the curtain of heaven had been pulled_back to give me a glimpse of wholeness : birth , life and death -- and seeing them all at once , I could accept them all. &quot; Although Huffington largely disappeared from public view_as a new mother , some people have tagged her as the engine for Michael ' s political ambitions . Michael denies the scuttlebutt . &quot; I chuckle , &quot; he said . &quot; First of all , if one looks_back at the record , which people don ' t do , the first time I walked precincts in politics was in ' 68 , when Reagan was running_for President . I was a student senator at Stanford and co-president of the senior_class . &quot; It ' s a naive statement or an uninformed statement that Arianna got me to run_for office . I ' ve been doing that since I was 20 years old. &quot; Now their respective campaigns have become one . &quot; Michael is helping me , &quot; Huffington said , by introducing legislation this month to make volunteering more attractive , by eliminating the tax rule that says the first 3 % of income donated to charity is not deductible and by giving people minimum-wage-equivalent tax_breaks for donating their time . Although they both talk the spirituality-in-politics talk , Huffington says she would carry_on her crusade with or without her husband ' s political_platform . &quot; If you had to convince everybody , it would not be doable , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s not an intellectual convincing . It ' s more like a catching . Catch the spirit of it . Then if enough people are doing this , it will spread like a positive infection . &quot; If you ' re doing your part , and I do my part , and So-and-So does his little part , the whole_thing mysteriously -- that ' s the thing -- beyond logic , will change everything. &quot;</TEXT>
