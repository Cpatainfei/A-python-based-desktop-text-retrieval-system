   <HEADLINE> EAST VALLEY FOCUS : PACOIMA ; FOOD PROGRAMS OPEN AT 2 CHARTER SCHOOLS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the latest giant step away from the mammoth Los Angeles Unified School District , the San Fernando Valley ' s two charter schools will begin running their own breakfast and lunch programs today . After nearly a year of unresolved bargaining with the school district , the Vaughn Next Century Learning Center in Pacoima and Fenton Avenue Charter School in Lake View Terrace announced last week that they would take_over fiscal control and legal liability of their cafeterias . To begin the program , both year-round schools decorated their newly remodeled lunchrooms with balloons and posters and printed expanded menus . But district officials said the plan still hinges_on clarification from the federal_government . &quot; It is new for us , new for the state and new for the feds , &quot; said district business manager David Koch . &quot; We are trying to be as accommodating as possible , but there is a certain amount of prudence and precaution that is mandated in this situation. &quot; District officials want assurance from the federal_government that the district will not be held responsible_for the charter schools ' actions . Charter schools receive public funding , but are free from state and local education regulations to write their own rules . Most of the approximately three dozen charter schools operating in the state pay their districts for food services . But officials at Vaughn and Fenton say they are entitled to run their own lunch and breakfast programs . Fenton Principal Joseph Lucente estimates the cost of running the program will be about $ 300 # 000 a year . With their independence , both schools hope to reduce waste , increase eating time and boost student enthusiasm for meals . In the past , students who were eligible for free lunches -- more_than 90 % at each school -- were given tickets at the beginning of the year that had to be presented at each meal . Hundreds of tickets were lost every week , slowing_down food lines while administrators verified names . Now , both schools will serve free breakfast and lunch to every child , using a bar_code system instead of tickets . Also , instead of having just two choices for entrees at lunch , children will have five . Breakfast used to be cold_cereal . Now , it includes sausage biscuits , muffins and breakfast burritos . Administrators kept pizza , chicken nuggets and hamburgers as menu mainstays , but changed the layout of the lunchroom to encourage students to eat a variety of fruits and vegetables .
