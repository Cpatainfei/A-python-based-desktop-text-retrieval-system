   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA LIVID OVER ALLEGED SPYING BY U.S.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The former KGB is mad as hell about aggressive Western spying on Russia and its patience is running_out , says an article in the official Russian government newspaper . The unusual article , which was published in Saturday ' s editions of Rossiskaya Gazeta and was written by a senior Russian counterintelligence official , names three U.S. diplomats whom Russia accuses of spying . It alleges that Malibu-based Pepperdine University collected Russian defense industry secrets under cover of a U.S. government-funded program to encourage defense conversion . And it charges that the CIA has stepped_up recruitment of Russian citizens with the goal of penetrating and undermining Russia ' s military-industrial complex . The author , Col . Sergei G . Gorlenko of the Federal Counterintelligence Service , hinted Tuesday that expulsions of U.S. diplomats from Russia may be forthcoming . In an interview in his office in the KGB successor agency ' s Lubyanka headquarters , under a portrait of the founder of the Soviet secret_police , Gorlenko said the counterintelligence service has extensive information &quot; about not-quite-diplomatic activities of the U.S. diplomats I mentioned in my story and some others too. &quot; &quot; We are working hard and we have a lot of facts , believe me , &quot; he said . Gorlenko , 45 , said he joined the KGB in 1971 , and was a longtime operative before joining the public relations department of the KGB successor agency . He said he and his superiors decided to publish the article now because the hemorrhage of defense secrets has become &quot; intolerable. &quot; The CIA and other U.S. agencies , as well as private American companies , &quot; will use any means to obtain the last remaining secrets of the Russian military-industrial complex , &quot; Gorlenko said . &quot; We are losing everything . We are losing our economic and military potential. &quot; The attack took U.S. officials by surprise . Relations with Russia seemed to have stabilized in the wake of the Aldrich H . Ames spying case , which led to tit-for-tat expulsions of diplomats in February . On Sunday , U.S. and Russian troops began their first joint peacekeeping exercises in the Russian heartland , at the Totsk military base in the Ural Mountains . Nevertheless , Russian officials have never stopped grumbling about Western spying . In July , the director of the Federal Counterintelligence Service , Sergei V . Stepashin , said that Russia was especially concerned about spying by North_Korea and the United States and that he had raised the issue with U.S. Ambassador to Russia Thomas Pickering . U.S. Embassy spokespersons refused to comment on the article , or on any complaints made to Pickering , in keeping with their policy never to discuss intelligence matters . In Washington , the State_Department said it had no comment on the allegations . Two of the three U.S. diplomats named have already left Moscow . Gorlenko charges that Donald Gibson Plants , who worked in the embassy ' s environment , science and technology section before leaving sometime this summer , was a &quot; career intelligence_officer &quot; who tried to ferret_out Russian military secrets under the cover of working_on defense conversion . The article also names Kelly Ann Hamilton , a former third secretary at the embassy , who departed Moscow at least a year ago . Hamilton has been accused in other Russian press articles of encouraging Russian informants who offered to provide details of the latest , top-secret Russian T-82 tank manufactured in the city of Nizhny Tagil . Also named is a &quot; vice consul of the U.S. General Consulate in St . Petersburg Geoffrey Giles , &quot; but no such person is included on the U.S. diplomatic list in Moscow or St . Petersburg . &quot; The article sounds like a combination of some possible truths mixed with a big dose of paranoia , &quot; said Washington-based espionage expert Jeffrey T . Richelson . &quot; I ' m sure the CIA office in Moscow is still operating , but I ' d be suspicious of calling Pepperdine University questionnaires a cover_for espionage , &quot; Richelson said . Thomas P . Kemp , who heads the Pepperdine University Russian Conversion Program , called the spying charges &quot; nonsense &quot; and &quot; outrageous. &quot; The program , funded by $ 1.7 million in grants from the U.S. Agency for International Development , has brought_about 80 Russian defense plant executives to America over the past two years , Kemp said . It offers management training , helps develop a peacetime business plan for converting defense industries , introduces Russian executives to potential American business partners , and even tries to help them get start-up capital , he said . &quot; We think it ' s a great program and are absolutely dumbfounded by the notion that it is some secret plot , &quot; Kemp said . &quot; I thought the Cold_War was over. &quot; The end of the Cold_War has not diminished the West ' s desire for reliable information about the status of Russia ' s still-giant nuclear arsenal and its troubled nuclear research facilities . Given the recent plutonium-smuggling cases , and the potential for nuclear materials from the former Soviet_Union to fall_into the hands of terrorists , the United States has every motive for trying to plumb Russia ' s nuclear secrets , Richelson said . &quot; If you could recruit an agent in MinAtom ( the Russian atomic_energy ministry ) , no government in its right mind would say no , &quot; Richelson said . &quot; It ' s too_much of a threat. &quot; Gorlenko said that last year , the counterintelligence agency nabbed about 20 Russian citizens who were spying for the West , and has exposed five more agents so far this year . However , the surveillance continues to cut both ways . Earlier this month , Sweden filed a formal protest after learning that Russia had harbored and employed an escaped Swedish spy as recently as one year ago . Sergei L . Loiko of The Times ' Moscow Bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
