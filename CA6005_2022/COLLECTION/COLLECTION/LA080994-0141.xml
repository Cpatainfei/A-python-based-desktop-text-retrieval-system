   <HEADLINE> ISRAEL , JORDAN OPEN ROAD LINK ; MIDEAST : RABIN , CHRISTOPHER AND CROWN_PRINCE ATTEND CEREMONY . CROSSING WILL BE LIMITED TO FOREIGNERS INITIALLY , BUT MOVE DEEPENS GOODWILL BETWEEN FORMER ENEMIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israel and Jordan opened a new border crossing Monday through a desolate desert field that just days ago bristled with deadly land_mines -- a move that accelerated good feeling two weeks after the former enemies ended almost half a century of hostility . &quot; We have waited 46 years ( for peace with Jordan ) . . . . We cannot wait even one day more , &quot; Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin said in an emotional ceremony during which grizzled veterans of Middle_East warfare exchanged handshakes and gifts and King Hussein ' s brother capped his speech by quoting from the Old_Testament in Hebrew . Rabin , Jordanian Crown_Prince Hassan and U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher presided over the opening of border terminals between the twin southern port cities of Aqaba , Jordan , and Eilat , Israel . Then they joined Hussein for a celebratory lunch and talks at the monarch ' s vacation palace beside the Gulf_of_Aqaba . For now , the border is open only to tourists and business people from other countries -- Israelis and Jordanians are not allowed to cross . But officials and journalists from Israel were permitted to attend the ceremony and a subsequent news_conference . &quot; It is a tonic to see that some seemingly insoluble problems have their solutions , &quot; Christopher said at the news_conference with Rabin and Hussein . There was a plaintive tone to Christopher ' s comment , coming as it did_in the midst of his often-frustrating attempt to mediate the region ' s last remaining intractable conflict , between Israel and Syria . After the festive day in Aqaba , he flew to Jerusalem on Monday night to report to Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres on his five-hour meeting Sunday in Damascus with Syrian President Hafez Assad . Christopher plans to return to Washington today but is expected to head back to the region by the middle of next month . In an eloquent address during the border ceremony , Rabin said the hastily built customs sheds and other facilities straddling the frontier provide &quot; the ideal backdrop for the new relationships being formed between Israel and Jordan. &quot; &quot; We are sitting on an old minefield , which was cleared only three days ago , &quot; he said . &quot; This is a field in which death and destruction were sowed . . . . Three days ago , this was a wilderness -- only sand and more sand . Today , this place teems with new life . Three weeks ago , the dream of peace was far away . Today , it is materializing -- telephone_lines , tourism . Soon it will seem as though this is the way it has always been. &quot; Direct phone_service between the two countries began Sunday with a call between Hussein and Israeli President Ezer Weizman . On Monday , the Israeli and Jordanian chambers_of_commerce pledged cross-border cooperation in a call of_their_own . For Israelis , the emotional high point of the ceremony was Hassan ' s surprise use of Hebrew to quote the biblical prophet Hosea ' s vision of &quot; turning the valley of trouble into a gate of hope. &quot; Israeli television anchorman Ehud Yaari , who was broadcasting the ceremony live , commented &quot; Beautiful , beautiful &quot; when Hassan broke_into Hebrew . Later , he told viewers : &quot; The crown_prince has surprised us . This was the first time we hear him speak in Hebrew . . . . No Arab leader that I can recall has done such a thing. &quot; The Aqaba-Eilat border crossing stands on a newly poured asphalt plaza with Israeli customs on one side and Jordanian customs on the other . Blacktop roads from the towns to the crossing were put_in over the weekend , along with new road signs pointing toward Eilat and Aqaba . For most of Israel ' s existence as a modern state , the towns have faced each other across a blue expanse of water . It is called the Gulf_of_Aqaba in Jordan and most of the rest of the world but in Israel is referred to as the Gulf of Eilat . Swimmers and wind-surfers were kept_on their own side of the border by gunboats stationed just off the beach . Christopher described the area as &quot; a place of longing , where Israelis and Jordanians could stand on the beaches of Eilat and Aqaba and see each other but not know each other. &quot; Asked by an Israeli journalist when Jordan will admit Israeli tourists , Hussein said , &quot; I hope before long. &quot; But he declined to say how long . Later , Hussein took Rabin and Christopher on a brief cruise on the royal yacht , heading immediately into Israeli waters . A flotilla of small Israeli boats , waving Israeli and Jordanian flags , saluted the leaders . The monarch , whose 41 years on the throne have all been dominated by Jordanian-Israeli animosity , said the normalizing relations between the countries provide &quot; the sort of peace that I have never experienced over the very many years. &quot; More tangible payoffs for Jordan also came quickly . Christopher said legislation forgiving Jordan ' s $ 700-million debt to the United States &quot; is proceeding through our Congress at an unusual pace. &quot; And President Clinton wrote to the heads of the governments of Switzerland , Germany , Belgium , Denmark , Spain , Finland , Canada , France , Italy , Sweden , Austria and Japan urging them to give debt relief to the Hashemite kingdom . Clinton also thanked Britain for debt relief already undertaken . &quot; It is essential that the people of Jordan feel the benefits of peace in tangible ways , &quot; the President wrote . &quot; Jordan ' s debt . . . is a major impediment to economic growth. &quot; Meanwhile , the slow , indirect negotiations continued between Israel and Syria . American , Syrian and Israeli officials all said Christopher ' s Sunday meeting with Assad &quot; laid the base for future progress , &quot; using virtually identical language . But Peres , who hitched a ride from Aqaba to Israel aboard Christopher ' s U.S. Air_Force transport , told reporters on the plane that he is convinced Assad wants peace , although it may take a long_time to hammer_out details . The Israeli foreign_minister also said Syria appears to have persuaded Hezbollah militias in southern Lebanon to stop attacking civilian targets in Israel , ending a week of border skirmishes . &quot; I think it is an important gesture for continuing the peace negotiations , &quot; Peres said . He said Christopher relayed Israel ' s request for Syrian help in reining_in Hezbollah and that Assad apparently complied , probably more to please the Americans than to help the Israelis . Times staff writer Mary Curtius contributed to this report . Opening the Border Israel and Jordan on Monday opened the first road link between the two once-warring countries , connecting the resorts of Eilat and Aqaba . The border opening is one byproduct of the war-no-more agreement Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and King Hussein signed two weeks ago .
