   <HEADLINE> CONFLICTING VIEWS ON ORDINATION OF WOMEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Re &quot; Church_of_England to Ordain Women , &quot; March 12 : The response of the Roman_Catholic_Church to the recent ordination of 32 women by the Church_of_England was , sadly , predictable . With its feet firmly implanted in its own traditional stance against the ordination of women , the Catholic_Church saw this action on the part of the Church_of_England as a new barrier toward an eventual reunion of the two Churches . If the future of ecumenical dialogue is to be placed in grave peril due_to the gender of the presbyters , then one may deduce that its future is grim . Rather than focusing_on gender issues , ecumenical dialogue must focus_on the religious denomination ' s ability to aid the individual in becoming truly human , as Jesus was truly human and its ability to build_up , not tear_down the Kingdom_of_God in our midst . The Roman_Catholic_Church must shift its focus to the major doctrinal similarities between itself and the Anglican community rather than the customs that still , shamefully , separate us .
