   <HEADLINE> INVESTIGATORS SEEK CLUES IN FATAL N . CAROLINA JET CRASH ; ACCIDENT : EXPERTS LOOK FOR EVIDENCE THAT WIND SHEARS CAUSED DC-9 TO SINK , KILLING 37 . CREW ' S ACTION IN ABORTED LANDING QUESTIONED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A powerful thunderstorm -- and the violent , shearing wind that it may have spawned -- were prime suspects Monday as several investigators probed the charred wreckage for clues on why a USAir jetliner crashed Saturday night , killing 37 of the 57 people aboard . It was typically hot , muggy weather here on the Fourth_of_July , and the going was slow and tedious for the two_dozen specialists brought_in by the National Transportation Safety Board to study the crash . Their work required patience and precision -- noting the exact position and condition of each of the thousands of pieces of twisted , shattered debris that once made_up a massive DC-9 jetliner . Officials say co-pilot James Hayes , 41 , apparently was at the controls Saturday night as USAir ' s Flight 1016 from Columbia , S.C. , prepared to land at the Charlotte-Douglas International Airport . Encountering the heavy rain and dwindling visibility of a rapidly intensifying thunderstorm , the cockpit crew decided to abort the landing attempt and climb to the right , according to transcripts of conversations between the airport tower and the crew . But after climbing briefly , the plane suddenly sank , slamming into the ground . About a minute before the crash , the tower had warned that there might be wind shears . Wind shears are sudden shifts in the direction and velocity of localized gusts , which occur at dangerously low levels and can deprive a plane of the airspeed needed to keep it aloft . Investigators are studying data from cockpit recording devices and from wind-shear monitoring systems on the ground , but there has been no definitive word yet on whether there were wind shears . There has been no mention of engine_failure , and the plane ' s abrupt drop could be explained by wind shear . In addition , two witnesses on the ground said Monday that gusts at the time of the crash had been strong enough to shake their truck . On the other hand , preliminary readings from monitoring systems on the ground show none of the wind-direction shifts normally associated with wind shear . And John Hammerschmidt , the NTSB member heading the accident probe , said other pilots landing about the time of the crash reported heavy rain but none said he encountered wind shear . Another issue is whether Hayes and his pilot , Capt . Michael Greenlee , handled the plane properly after they made the decision to abort the landing and told the tower they were &quot; on_the_go &quot; and circling to the right for another landing attempt . So-called go-arounds are not uncommon , and USAir officials said Hayes and Greenlee were thoroughly trained on handling a DC-9 in wind-shear conditions . Hayes and Greenlee survived in relatively good_condition . The NTSB positioned investigators the length of the straight , 1 # 100-foot swath the plane carved after first striking the ground about 2 # 200 feet west of the north-south runway . The landing_gear on the right side of the plane hit first , followed by the left landing_gear about 18 feet later . The right wingtip struck the ground a_few feet after that , literally mowing the grass as the plane continued to hurtle forward . The DC-9 sawed through a grove of small trees , scattering tree limbs and debris before colliding into two large oaks . The impact with the oaks tore the fuselage into three pieces . All that was left of the mid-section of the fuselage , which burned furiously after the crash , was a five-foot pile of charred debris wrapped around one of the oaks . Still scattered around it Monday were personal possessions of the living and dead -- torn magazines , a baby ' s clothing , videocassettes and a stained T-shirt . The mutilated aft section of the fuselage had hacked its way into a house like an ax into a soft log . The occupants of the house , Walter and Martha Dunn , were in South Carolina when the accident occurred . The smashed remains of two of the Dunns ' cars were still in their driveway Monday , a_few yards from a blue plastic tarp on which rescuers had placed human remains .</TEXT>
