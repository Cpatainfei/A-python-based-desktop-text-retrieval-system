   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; CRANKING_UP THE VOLUME ; ROBERT RODRIGUEZ MADE ' EL MARIACHI ' WITH A BORROWED CAMERA ON A WHEELCHAIR DOUBLING AS A DOLLY . NOW HIS SECOND FILM HAS BIG STARS , A BIG BUDGET -- AND LOTS OF REALLY EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Get a load of this : Antonio Banderas , all decked_out in bandit black , scampering across the bar in a dingy cantina , a blazing pistol in either hand , mowing_down bad_guys as he twirls his arms this way , that way , any way , like a flamboyant bullfighter facing death in the afternoon . Filmmaker Robert Rodriguez can ' t help grinning at his own handiwork as the action explodes across the twin video monitors . &quot; Awwww riiiight ! &quot; he exclaims , turning_up the volume on the Lightworks editing unit . &quot; You know , we can ' t get a stunt double for Banderas . Nobody can move like this guy. &quot; Rodriguez ' s voice is drowned_out by another volley of gunfire . On the video screens , Banderas is allowing the bad_guys to take their best shots . &quot; You missed me ! &quot; he jeers at a particularly poor marksman . &quot; Of course , the Mariachi never misses , &quot; Rodriguez notes . &quot; He just keeps coming_up with these new shooting techniques . This movement here -- we call this ' The Whip. ' And it works , see . The bullets go_around corners and hit people. &quot; Rodriguez pushes another button on the console ; another image appears on the twin monitors . Would you look_at that : It ' s Quentin Tarantino , the exuberant auteur of &quot; Reservoir Dogs &quot; and &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; trying to talk his way_out of a dangerous situation . He ' s in the back_room of the bar , trying to score a drug deal with a_couple_of thugs , when Banderas begins to blast away bad_guys . The thugs in the back_room think Tarantino has set them up . &quot; Look , man , &quot; Tarantino desperately explains , &quot; I had nothing to do with . . . &quot; Blam ! A single gunshot to the forehead ends his conversation . Tarantino appears to die as messily as a character in one of_his_own movies . &quot; See that ? &quot; Rodriguez asks , beaming with pride . &quot; Let me show you again . This is a real cool editing system . They made this stuff real easy so , like , you learn to work it in a half-hour. &quot; But isn ' t it ironic that this Lightworks system , this network of monitors and disc_drives and whatnot that takes_up most of a motel_room , costs more_than the entire budget of Rodriguez ' s first movie ? &quot; Are you kidding ? &quot; Rodriguez replies . He picks_up , seemingly at random , a small black rectangular box that looks_like a CD_player you would connect to your living room stereo . &quot; Man , this alone cost more_than ' El Mariachi. ' &quot; Well , yes . Three years ago , Rodriguez filmed &quot; El Mariachi , &quot; his debut feature , in the hard-scrabble border town of Acuna , Mexico , just down the road and across the Rio Grande , on a frayed-shoestring budget of $ 7 # 225 . Now he has returned to the scene of the crime with nearly 1 # 000 times that amount , to film a new adventure for Columbia Pictures . Now he can afford the star power , the production values and the post-production hardware he couldn ' t afford last time . In fact , just about the only thing he ' s lacking -- so far , at least -- is a title for his latest effort . Depending_on what day this is or who you ask , the new movie Rodriguez recently wrapped in Acuna , due out early next summer , is titled either &quot; Pistolero &quot; or &quot; The Return of the Mariachi. &quot; Or maybe &quot; Desperado , &quot; even though only the Hollywood Reporter and Exhibitor Relations have ever referred to it as such . &quot; Actually , &quot; producer Bill Borden joked one morning during breakfast at an Acuna location , &quot; I think that when it comes_out next summer , we should have_on the poster ' Pistolero : The Return of the Mariachi Desperado. ' Just go_ahead and call it everything it ' s ever been called. &quot; By any name , it will have a tough act to follow . * For the benefit of those who tuned_in late : Two years ago , Rodriguez astonished film festival-goers at Toronto and Telluride with &quot; El Mariachi , &quot; the stripped-to-essentials yarn that he filmed with a borrowed camera , a minimum of props and a handful of friends . For all its rough edges , the movie -- a fast-paced , no-frills adventure about a mariachi musician who ' s mistaken for a vengeful hit_man -- was immediately recognized as a work of considerable accomplishment and exceptional promise . Just as important , the story behind the movie ' s production was the stuff of Hollywood legend and film-school fantasy . At the time he made_it , Rodriguez was a University of Texas film student with an audacious plan for extracurricular_activities . According to the original scenario , Rodriguez , a San Antonio native , and Carlos Gallardo , a friend and UT classmate , would film three micro-budget action flicks about a mariachi-turned-vigilante . They would make the movies back-to-back -- selling the first to pay_for the second , then the second to pay_for the third -- for the Spanish video market . That way , they could gain all_the benefits of hands-on experience without risking the embarrassment of having a potential employer actually see the mistakes they made . &quot; I figured no one ( in Hollywood ) would ever rent it , &quot; Rodriguez , who is now 26 , says . &quot; I mean , do you ever go_to the Spanish video market and rent a movie ? And even if you did , would you ever rent an action movie called ' The Guitar_Player ' ? &quot; I never even intended to make a print of ( &quot; El Mariachi &quot; ) . I just wanted something that looked_like a real film , that I edited on video , so I could sell it. &quot; But in December , 1991 , while in Los Angeles to negotiate with video distributors , Rodriguez figured , what the heck , while he was in the neighborhood , he might as well leave a calling card or two . So he dropped_off one of his award-winning student short films and a makeshift trailer for &quot; El Mariachi &quot; with International Creative Management . The tape greatly impressed ICM ' s Robert Newman , who signed Rodriguez to an agency contract , then sent cassettes of &quot; El Mariachi &quot; to every major studio in town . Much to Rodriguez ' s surprise , Columbia Pictures signed the young filmmaker to a two-year development deal . And much to his astonishment , the studio also made an offer to buy and distribute &quot; El Mariachi. &quot; &quot; At first , &quot; Rodriguez admits , &quot; I didn ' t want that to happen . What I did , I didn ' t think it was a movie . I thought it was just fooling_around with the camera . I told the Columbia people , ' Look , it ' s just a home movie. ' &quot; * But the Columbia brass disagreed . The studio successfully tested a technically enhanced version of Rodriguez ' s movie at the 1992 Toronto and Telluride festivals -- where Rodriguez became friendly with Tarantino and actor Steve Buscemi , who were then busy publicizing &quot; Reservoir Dogs , &quot; and who agreed to appear in Rodriguez ' s next film . By the time &quot; El Mariachi &quot; won the Audience Award for favorite film at the Sundance Film Festival in January , 1993 , Rodriguez was willing to admit that his extracurricular project might attract ticket buyers . The unlikely rise of Rodriguez and his no-budget movie became a much-hyped Cinderella story . But a key detail somehow got overlooked in most of the press coverage after &quot; El Mariachi &quot; hit theaters in early 1993 : The ending of this fairy tale wasn ' t nearly so happy as most people assumed . &quot; El Mariachi &quot; wound_up grossing &quot; only about $ 1.8 million , &quot; producer Borden says . &quot; Now , if you look_at it in terms of percentages -- the movie only cost $ 7 # 000 , and then Columbia put a_couple_of hundred_thousand into finishing it , bringing it up_to 35mm and re-dubbing it so you could release it in big theaters . Well , you know , to invest a_couple_of hundred_thousand dollars into a movie that returned $ 1.8 million was not such a bad investment . &quot; But the reality of that investment is , it didn ' t make them any money . Because by the time you put_in the cost of ( prints and advertising ) , and flying Robert around for all_the publicity trips and all that stuff , it was a break-even proposition. &quot; All of which goes_a_long_way toward explaining why the folks involved with Rodriguez ' s latest effort -- including Rodriguez himself -- are more_than a little ambivalent about what to call the new film , and how closely to associate it with its predecessor . &quot; Certainly , &quot; Borden says , &quot; the first film has a name value that ' s sort of seeped into the moviegoing community . . . . And it seemed to have done a lot better than it really did , because of the stories that followed it . &quot; So the decision to invest substantially more money in this sequel was actually a fairly easy choice . Because you had a new , young , talented director . And you had ' El Mariachi , ' which has definitely made its mark on the public , and has been very successful as a videocassette , as a rental item. &quot; * ' Pistolero &quot; -- the title that appeared on the scripts that circulated throughout fall shooting in Acuna -- is intended as a sequel that can stand on its own . Or as Rodriguez puts it : &quot; This is what ' The Road Warrior ' was to ' Mad Max. ' It ' s like , the same character in a different movie . If you didn ' t see the first movie , it doesn ' t matter . You can still have a good time with this one. &quot; The second movie has a hot property in_the_lead role : Antonio Banderas , the Spanish-born hunk who has managed the tricky transition from imported art-house fare ( &quot; Matador , &quot; &quot; Tie Me Up ! Tie Me Down ! &quot; ) to mainstream American movies ( &quot; Philadelphia , &quot; &quot; Interview With the Vampire &quot; ) . Banderas takes_over the job from Rodriguez ' s partner , Carlos Gallardo , who is content this time to remain on the other side of the cameras as associate producer with Elizabeth Avellan , Rodriguez ' s wife . &quot; I wanted to make another movie with a Latin hero , &quot; says Rodriguez , the third of 10 children of a close-knit Mexican American family . &quot; A movie that was bigger ( than &quot; El Mariachi &quot; ) , that would go_around the world and be seen . And it just seemed easier to me , because there were no other scripts around like this , to just use this character again to accomplish that. &quot; For all his jocularity , Rodriguez fully realizes that there ' s more riding_on his second feature than merely the question of whether he can survive the sophomore jinx . With all due respect_to Edward James Olmos , &quot; who has always been an inspiration to me , &quot; and Luis Valdez , who made &quot; La Bamba &quot; with producer Bill Borden , &quot; You see hardly any Mexican American filmmakers , &quot; Rodriguez said . &quot; And their movies come_out only once in a while . &quot; But I think if ( ' Mariachi 2 ' ) would be successful enough , if it made enough money , other Latino movies would be made . It ' s like with African American films . As soon as Spike Lee made his movies , everyone was giving checks for other black filmmakers to come_up . And they started making great films . And that opened_up a whole new market . &quot; It comes_to a point where you realize , ' I ' m going_to have to step_forward and try and be a role_model , because nobody else seems to be wanting to . Or if they are , they ' re pretty well hidden. ' &quot; At the end of the first &quot; El Mariachi , &quot; the hero was seriously wounded by the bad_guys , and left unable to play his beloved guitar . Even so , the wound wasn ' t so serious that he couldn ' t transform himself into a heavily armed avenger . Which is exactly what he has become as &quot; The Sequel With No Title &quot; begins . &quot; Yeah , &quot; Banderas jokes in his heavily accented English , &quot; the audience may say , ' Hey , this guy , he can ' t play the guitar anymore , but he can shoot people like hell. ' &quot; I am not killing just one guy once in a while . I go_into a bar , and I kill 20 guys at once . So it ' s over the top . The movie starts , and in 20 minutes , I kill about 40 guys in two different bars. &quot; Banderas ' Mariachi is a one-man army who wages war on Mexican drug dealers , who travels everywhere with a lethal array of weapons in his seemingly innocuous guitar case . His only allies : Buscemi ( played , appropriately enough , by Steve Buscemi ) , El Mariachi ' s advance scout , and Carolina ( Mexican television_star Salma Hayek ) , a bookstore owner . Number One on El Mariachi ' s want-to-hit list : Bucho , a suave but sinister crime lord who has more in common with El Mariachi than either man suspects . Originally , Raul Julia was cast as Bucho , and the entire shooting schedule had been plotted around his availability . But shortly after he suffered the stroke that preceded his death Oct . 24 , Julia was replaced with Argentine actor Joaquim de Almeida ( &quot; Clear_and_Present_Danger , &quot; &quot; Only You &quot; ) . On the day Julia ' s death was announced on the Acuna location , producer Borden led the cast and crew in a moment of respectful silence . After that brief reminder of mortality , it was back to the world of blood squibs and fake deaths . &quot; This movie will be as wild as anything Sam Peckinpah ever dreamed of , &quot; promises Bob Shelley , a veteran special-effects coordinator working_on the sequel . More important , from Columbia ' s point_of_view , the mayhem is being accomplished at cut-rate prices . Rodriguez , who often placed his camera on a wheelchair for dolly shots in &quot; El Mariachi , &quot; has remained true_to his low-budget roots here . &quot; We ' ve got an item that Robert ' s nicknamed the Guacamole Gun , &quot; Shelley says . &quot; We couldn ' t afford a lot of prosthetics on this show . So what he ' s done is , since we shoot a lot of people in the forehead , he ' s rigged this gun that will shoot out a tremendous amount of blood . We can hit the guy in the forehead , or in the back of the head , and it looks_like we blow their brains out . But if you look real close , you can see the blood flying toward them . So what Robert does is , he edits_out one or two frames , and the flying blood is gone. &quot; And what remains , Rodriguez insists , really isn ' t all that graphic . At least , not so graphic that he ' s worried about an NC-17 rating . &quot; It was such a goof while I was shooting this stuff , I never took any of it seriously , &quot; he says . * On and off the set , Rodriguez dresses like a grunge rocker -- bandanna , baggy shorts , wrinkled shirt , scuffed sneakers -- and moves with the sleepy ease of a bear recently awakened from hibernation . But while directing his movie by day on location in Acuna , or editing a rough cut by night in his Del Rio motel_room , he often sounds like a 33 1 / 3-r.p.m. record that some prankster has revved_up to 78 . &quot; When the movie comes_out , &quot; he mock-seriously promises , slipping into the voice of a TV pitchman , &quot; we ' ll have our very own action figures ! You ' ll see the commercials , and it ' ll be , ' El Mariachi and his missile-firing guitar case ! Batteries not included ! ' &quot; Judging from the mood of his cast and crew , Rodriguez ' s enthusiasm is highly contagious . &quot; The way Robert understands action , he ' s like a kid , &quot; Banderas says . &quot; And in a way , he ' s an actor ' s dream . An actor is someone who probably stopped growing_up , and decided to be a kid forever , playing games . And that ' s what I ' m doing here : things that I saw on TV when I was a kid -- that I wanted to do when I was a kid. &quot; When Banderas and his wife , Ana Leza , saw the first &quot; El Mariachi &quot; in a Hollywood screening room , &quot; I thought , ' This guy has incredible energy , ' &quot; the actor says . &quot; It reminds me of the first films I did with ( Pedro ) Almodovar . Not in his style , of course . But it ' s like , you know , the same thing , when you don ' t have any money and you ' re working outside the studio , with no trailer , no nothing , just waiting_on the corner to do your shot . And I thought , ' Wow ! that ' s the kind of cinema I would like to do again. ' &quot; Rodriguez insists that success hasn ' t spoiled him so far , and isn ' t likely to in the future . He and his wife still live_in Austin , far away from L.A. , in a conspicuously unglamorous apartment . And while he ' s enjoying the relative ease of directing a film bankrolled by a Hollywood studio , he claims that if his second &quot; Mariachi &quot; is a financial dud , he can always go_back to making movies with borrowed cameras mounted on wheelchairs . Still , Rodriguez admits there is something to be said for having a bigger budget . &quot; When we were making ' El Mariachi , ' we didn ' t have any money , &quot; Rodriguez says . &quot; So , in_order to have something to drink between takes , we wound_up buying this Gatorade powder . And since we didn ' t have very much , we had to mix it with a lot of water . A lot of water. &quot; Rodriguez smiles at the memory . Then he grabs a plastic bottle of the sports drink -- full-strength , premixed stuff , purchased in a Del Rio convenience_store -- and takes a healthy swig . &quot; Now , &quot; he says , &quot; we can get real Gatorade . that ' s how far we ' ve come. &quot;</TEXT>
