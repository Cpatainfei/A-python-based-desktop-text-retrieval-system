The ski company had Snowmass Village police , carrying guns in their fanny packs , patrol the resort four times a week . Patrols began after Thanksgiving . &quot; Unfortunately , the perception has been extremely negative and , the new program has led people to believe that there is a crime problem at Snowmass Ski Area , which simply is not the case , &quot; Police_Chief Art Smythe said Thursday .</TEXT>
