   <HEADLINE> POLITICS ; BERLUSCONI FINDS FEW ALLIES , MANY TROUBLES AS ITALY LEADER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s easy to explain how Silvio Berlusconi went from being the tycoon who has everything to the man who seems to have nothing but trouble : He became prime_minister of Italy . A year ago , he presided in growing alarm over his Fininvest media- ' n ' -things empire that employs about 40 # 000 people and has annual receipts of about $ 7 billion . As he watched , corrupt political_parties that ran Italy for nearly half a century toppled in disgrace , one after another . Their most likely successor was the former Italian Communist_Party , now social democratic but still millionaire-chary and red-faced against Berlusconi holdings that include the three main private television channels . So he founded a political_party named Forza Italia and based it on the system of fan clubs boosting his European-best AC Milan soccer team . He led it to resounding electoral victory in just three months . But there have been few government goals and a lot of beleaguered defense since Berlusconi , 58 , took_office in May . He grouses that he ' s working harder than ever for less than $ 1 # 000 a week -- and , worse , gets no respect . This morning , millions of Italians are to walk_off their jobs in a nationwide strike to protest a government austerity budget that endangers hallowed social benefits , particularly pensions . Today ' s protest is just one twist in a skein of troubles entangling a self-made political rookie thoroughly buffeted by political enemies . And friends . One ambitious ally in Berlusconi ' s right-wing coalition is rebellious ; the other is positioning himself as a potential successor . Umberto Bossi , the loose-cannon populist leader of the Northern League , for one , demurs loudly against government initiatives . Slick neo-fascist chief Gianfranco Fini , for another , is pressing to dissolve the party forged by fans of former dictator Benito Mussolini . Fini , 42 , wants to replace the Italian Social Movement , his springboard to prominence , with the broader , less extreme , more electable National Alliance , a rightist movement he formed last year . Fini gets higher poll ratings than Berlusconi , who ' s fighting angrily with anti-corruption judges and with Parliament over ways to guard against conflicts-of-interest between his business empire and his government post . Berlusconi initially profited from judicial investigations documenting corruption between businesses and political_parties in previous governments . But now , he has joined critics who argue that the judges have become politically motivated and are abusing their authority in the ever-widening corruption inquiry . One particular issue is the use of preventive detention as a means of making suspects talk : Senior industrialists have routinely been imprisoned at a judge ' s pleasure without charge or recourse to bail , sometimes without even having been interrogated . The tactic has loosened many tongues . Last week , chief Milan Judge Francesco Saverio Borrelli hinted that Berlusconi himself might become a target in investigations of a pay TV_station partially owned by Fininvest . Appearing at a raucous Senate session Wednesday , Berlusconi said Borrelli , whom the government is formally accusing of malfeasance , is guilty of &quot; political intimidation. &quot; Parliamentary opponents say the government is undermining magistrates ' work , and the judges say they are doing their job , which has made them some of the most popular people in Italy . Berlusconi is richer and has greater_power to influence public_opinion than any American President . Now , after prolonged study , a panel has recommended a law that would separate him from Fininvest without forcing him to sell . The empire has been run_by an aide since Berlusconi took_office , but the prime_minister has held strategy sessions with leading managers . Berlusconi promises quick legislation to establish an Italian version of a blind trust . But opponents say there is no assurance of independent monitoring . Ominously for Berlusconi , one bill demanding the sale of his TV interests is being advanced by Bossi , his erstwhile coalition partner .</TEXT>
