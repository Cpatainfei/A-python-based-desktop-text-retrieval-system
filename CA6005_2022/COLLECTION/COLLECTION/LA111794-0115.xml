   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : OJAI ; DETAILS REQUESTED ON CHARTER SCHOOL PLAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Urged by parents to offer a public_school alternative for local students , the Ojai school_board has agreed to keep alive a proposal for what would be Ventura County ' s first charter school . Trustees gave former teacher Deanna Nakosteen up_to six weeks to give them more details about her proposed Discovery Charter School -- which would be publicly funded but free from the constraints of state education code . The decision came at a Tuesday meeting packed with about 45 of Nakosteen ' s supporters , many of them parents whose children attended a now-defunct private_school run_by Nakosteen . Although parents praised Nakosteen ' s teaching ability , Ojai school officials said they are concerned the proposed school fails to meet the requirements of the 1992 charter school law . The law , drawn_up in response to parent demands for more choice in the public_schools , gives charter schools control over their own finances by allowing them to receive funding directly from the state . But the law says only existing public_schools or new , start-up schools may become charter schools : Private_schools may_not convert to charter status . Ojai Supt . Andrew Smidt said Nakosteen ' s proposed school may be just a conversion of her former private_school -- called Discovery Place -- to charter status . The school folded in 1991 . Smidt also raised concerns about how Nakosteen ' s school would serve disabled students . But David Patterson , a state_Department of Education consultant , said other charter schools are based on the educational methods used at private_schools . The state would not consider Nakosteen ' s proposal to violate the charter school law , he said . Patterson said some charter schools pay the local district to allow disabled students to take_part in the district ' s special_education programs . MAIA DAVIS</TEXT>
