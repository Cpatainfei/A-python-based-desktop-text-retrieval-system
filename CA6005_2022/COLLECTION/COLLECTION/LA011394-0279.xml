   <HEADLINE> STRUCTURES ; SERENE PRECURSOR TO MAYAN AUDACITY OF ROBERT STACY-JUDD ; KROTONA INSTITUTE SHOWS ANOTHER SIDE OF THE ARCHITECT KNOWN AS AN ICONOCLAST AND AN EXPONENT OF THE OUTLANDISH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Krotona Hill is a peaceable property , detached from the township of Ojai proper , occupying a sprawling space all its own . Nestling into the Krotona Institute of Theosophy ' s library , housing more_than 10 # 000 books mostly on spiritual and metaphysical topics , the visitor peers out of the tall , arched window to the lawn and rose garden out front . Vistas of the Ojai Valley beckon below . Squirrels scamper on the spacious grounds , where deer and coyote have also been known to roam . Apart from the drone of traffic drifting up from California 33 , it ' s feasible to imagine the_hill as a rural retreat . All is right with this world . But , for architectural observers in the area , a question persists : Can the 70-year-old structures that are the heart of the place really be the work of the same man who flung quasi-Mayan and Art Deco motifs together for such edifices as the First Baptist_Church in Ventura ? British-born Robert Stacy-Judd , who died in 1975 at the age of 90 , had an odd reputation in the annals of Southern California architecture -- somewhere between genius and self-styled iconoclast . The architect ' s work and legend has recently been revived and re-examined in David Gebhard ' s new book &quot; Maya Architecture : the Creation of a New Style &quot; ( Capra , $ 30 ) . What we see in the First Baptist_Church , at the corner of Santa Clara and Laurel streets , is one of the more audacious edifices in the county . Built between 1928 and 1932 , the church represents the fruits of Stacy-Judd ' s abiding interest in Mayan architecture and design . He championed the Maya style , although he saw few of his Mayan-oriented buildings go_up , and went_on to write archeological volumes on the Maya and Atlantis . These books can be found , aptly , at the Krotona library . It ' s hard to believe , in a sense , that , during the same year that Stacy-Judd worked_on the Mission-style Krotona Institute , he was devising his attention-grabbing Aztec Hotel in Monrovia . With the Aztec , what had begun in a Pueblo style took a radical turn as Stacy-Judd doused both its exterior and interior in Mayan relief . National attention , both positive and negative , followed . In Ojai , it ' s a different story . What we see in the architect ' s several buildings at the Krotona Institute of Theosophy -- primarily the library and the Esoteric School building -- is calm , restrained and respectful of the general lay of the neighborhood . This wasn ' t the Krotona ' s first landing spot . Named after Crotona , a Pythagorean school in Italy , the Krotona Institute of Theosophy was settled in Hollywood in 1912 . As congestion and the Babylonian boom-town mentality of the movie_industry grew in the ' 20s , the Krotona Institute migrated to the more idyllic locale of Ojai in 1924 . The 118-acre Krotona property , purchased with funds from Theosophy founder Annie Besant , was originally an almond orchard . The ongoing legacy of the late religious_leader Krishnamurti and , by association , the Krotona Institute , represents an important piece of the cultural puzzle of what has made Ojai Ojai . And the structures comprising the Krotona Institute , especially the cornerstone of the library ( open_to the public ) , survive as a graceful home to resident arcana . The library is a multifaceted structure , finished in pieces in 1924 with additional work by Santa Paula architect Roy C . Wilson . Especially effective are the meeting room , graced by a picture_window , and the central library , with its reading_room surrounded by overhead balconies . True_to Stacy-Judd ' s culture-bending tendency -- even back in his relatively sedate pre-Mayan period -- the library itself isn ' t quite as staid or stylistically homogeneous as it seems . First impressions upon entering the library are deceiving . Contrasting with the earthy warmth of the Mission style elements , the lobby , lined by cold marble walls , conveys a curious , tomb-like ambience . Enigmas lurk here . Once , a fountain , now removed and covered over with an ornate rug , trickled in the center of the room . One arched door leads to nowhere , providing only symmetry with another door across the lobby . A regular , geometric grid of tiles in the lobby make_for a stark contrast with the jagged piecework of the sidewalk outside . The architect has explained the difference as symbolizing the tranquillity of spiritual life versus the chaotic nature of worldly reality . The building is a composite , run-on affair inviting exploration . Rear-projecting wings flank a courtyard out back , with ascending paths on either side of long , cascading fountains . Flowing water greets the ears and calms the nerves . Across the road from the library , Stacy-Judd ' s E.S. ( Esoteric School ) structure is eerily reminiscent_of another well-known Ojai building , albeit of a secular nature : Wallace Neff ' s original Ojai Country_Club . Like Neff ' s 1928 clubhouse , if with less organic beauty , thickly stuccoed walls sit beneath red-tiled roofs . The composition is deceptively simple . The rambling building shows a sculptural integration of rectilinear volumes capped_off by a scrolling , curving staircase at one end . Stacy-Judd couldn ' t help but sneak_in a subtle touch of Mayan decor , in a relief design over the west-facing doorway . For the most part , despite the eccentric touches , Stacy-Judd was_on his best vernacular behavior here . In focusing_on the familiar Southern California Spanish / Pueblo vocabulary of gentle , rippling arcades , red tile_roofs and lathered stucco walls , Stacy-Judd kept with a common architectural theme in the area . While the architect ultimately became known for more outlandish creations , the serenity of this early work shows a more sensitive aspect of his talent . One can only speculate what he might have created on this hill a_few years later , after his Mayan obsession and subsequent notoriety had flowered . As it stands now , Stacy-Judd ' s Krotona work is interesting both on its own terms and as a gentle shard in the strange mosaic of the architect ' s saga . Details * FYI : The Krotona Library is open_to the public weekdays from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m .</TEXT>
