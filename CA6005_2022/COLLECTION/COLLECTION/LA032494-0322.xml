   <TEXT> Jarrett Seals says he can ' t begin to enumerate all he learned during a summer trip to Brazil . &quot; For one thing , I became fluent in Portuguese and learned how Brazilians see the world . I began to think globally and started to question things in my own life that I had never thought_about before. &quot; Seals , a freshman at Wesleyan University in Middletown , Conn. , went_to Brazil as a 16-year-old as part of World Learning ' s Experiment in International Living Program . He spent three weeks in Brazil , sharing experiences with a dozen peers of various ethnic backgrounds from around the country . Students lived apart , each with an assigned family , but met daily for classes , discussion groups and sightseeing . &quot; That summer really broadened my horizons and changed me totally as a person , &quot; Seals says . &quot; I got_to know about another culture , but I also got_to know about being American. &quot; World Learning Inc. ' s Summer Abroad Program organizes supervised programs both at_home and abroad -- with language study , community service and ecological adventure components . Students age 14 to 20 are eligible , but most are high schoolers . &quot; The program gives young Americans from various socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds a chance to meet each other while they ' re learning about , are saturated in , another culture , &quot; says Mike Koonce , director of the Summer Abroad Program . &quot; It ' s the sort of experience that elevates one ' s sense of identity and promotes self-confidence , &quot; he says . &quot; It makes goals clearer and motivates one to work harder to achieve them. &quot; Founded in 1932 as the Experiment in International Living , the World Learning Inc. , a nonprofit group in Brattleboro , Vt. , claims 45 # 000 Summer Abroad alumni , including singer Tracy Chapman , Peace Corps founder Sargent Shriver , actor Larry Hagman and Newsweek columnist Jonathan Alter .
