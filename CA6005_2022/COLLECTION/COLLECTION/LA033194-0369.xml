   <HEADLINE> TOPICS ; EDUCATION : PARENTS FIGHT UNIFORM POLICY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Parents on Catalina Island are fighting a Long_Beach Unified School District policy that will require elementary and middle_school students to wear uniforms next year . On the mainland , administrators hope the policy will help curb gang problems by limiting gang attire.But the 610-student Avalon schools , isolated from the rest of the district , do not have the same difficulties . &quot; We don ' t have a lot of the problems that the mainland schools have , &quot; said travel_agency owner Mike Lavelle , who has three children in school . He and other parents have launched a petition drive expressing dismay at the districtwide policy , which on Avalon will also include high_school students because its campus is combined with other grades . &quot; I object to the dictatorial way in which Long_Beach Unified decided to administer this thing , &quot; Lavelle said . Uniforms &quot; are a decision that should be left to the parents. &quot; School safety , however , is not the only intent of the policy , said Avalon Principal Mark Ur . With uniforms , students &quot; are not teased or forced into competing buying stylish brands , &quot; he said . &quot; It gives students more self-esteem. &quot; He also said that uniforms might instill more of a work ethic because &quot; it gives ( students ) the feeling that they are putting_on their work clothes. &quot; A school committee will establish guidelines for the new uniforms , which might include an iron-on patch with the school ' s emblem , Ur said . A town_hall meeting is planned on April 19 to discuss the policy . TED JOHNSON</TEXT>
