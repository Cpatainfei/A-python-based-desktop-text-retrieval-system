   <TEXT> Let health groups call them drug pushers ; let members of Congress hand them their heads . U.S. cigarette makers are riding high , now that the world is Marlboro Country . Americans keep smoking less , but tobacco companies are finding more_than enough foreigners to take their places . From the smoke-filled cafes of Eastern Europe to the billboard jungles of Asia , the firms are out there pitching -- often using TV and other strategies they cannot use at_home : * In China , the world ' s biggest tobacco market , Philip Morris has become the financial angel of professional soccer , underwriting the Marlboro Soccer League , named for the company ' s flagship brand . * In Prague , capital of the Czech Republic , R.J. Reynolds has marched couples down the aisle in &quot; Camel &quot; weddings , complete with Camel-insignia taxis to shuttle the guests . * In the Philippines , Asia ' s most Roman_Catholic nation , promotional calendars display U.S. and local cigarette brands under a picture of the_Virgin Mary . * In chain-smoking Eastern Europe , the U.S. companies are becoming a huge force in cigarette manufacturing , with Philip Morris and Reynolds between them having entered into 14 joint_ventures with state tobacco companies . Here at_home , tobacco companies are circling the wagons , fighting to save what they can of a shrinking market . But the industry ' s big three -- Philip Morris , R.J. Reynolds and Brown &amp; Williamson -- are seizing new turf in the developing world , where smoking is_on the rise and American cigarettes still symbolize elegance and style . With billions of dollars at stake , tobacco firms have turned_to political heavyweights for help in penetrating foreign markets . Former British Prime_Minister Margaret Thatcher is an adviser to Philip Morris -- although neither she nor the firm will discuss her work or consulting fee , a reported $ 1 million . The overseas push began years ago , as rising health concerns caused U.S. sales to fall . But recent events in Eastern Europe and Asia have quickened the pace . In the newly independent states of the former Soviet Bloc , the collapse of communism has opened the floodgates to investment by tobacco firms . Eastern Europe has the world ' s highest rates of smoking-related deaths , but it is also starved for capital . U.S.- and Europe-based tobacco multinationals have committed more_than $ 1.5 billion to build or retool cigarette plants throughout the region -- often in joint_ventures with state tobacco monopolies that once had the business to themselves . Across economically booming Asia -- the only region where cigarette consumption , per capita , is clearly growing -- the U.S._government has smashed trade_barriers that kept_out U.S. smokes . From 1986 to 1990 , Japan , Taiwan , South_Korea and Thailand each caved_in to threats of trade sanctions , allowing American cigarettes to compete with monopoly brands . The full-court press is paying big dividends . Although U.S. consumption has fallen_in each of the last 10 years -- and by 20 % over the decade -- cigarette exports have more_than tripled and sales from U.S. tobacco plants abroad have surged . Philip Morris alone sold 460 billion cigarettes abroad in 1993 -- nearly as_many as Americans bought from the company and all its rivals combined . &quot; Our worldwide tobacco business has never been in better shape , &quot; the firm recently told shareholders . &quot; As large as we have grown , however , our brands only account_for approximately 12 % of the worldwide cigarette market -- leaving plenty of room for profitable growth. &quot; Cigarette exports have also been one of the few bright spots in the U.S. trade picture , shaving the trade_deficit by $ 23.5 billion over the last five years . Not that the cigarette makers are turning their backs on America . Profit_margins remain higher in the United States than abroad . Indeed , the companies will keep fighting smoking restrictions here -- as Philip Morris did_in its failed campaign on behalf of California ' s Proposition 188 -- to preserve domestic sales and because other countries tend to copy U.S. smoking curbs . But as time passes and the industry extends its global reach , its problems at_home seem to matter less and less . &quot; For every smoker who quits in the U.S. , two teen-agers start smoking in China , &quot; said Dr. Judith Mackay , a Hong Kong-based physician and consultant who has advised Asian_countries on tobacco control . Twenty years ago , the wealthy , industrialized West led the world in smoking , according to tobacco consumption data compiled by the World_Health_Organization . Today , the situation essentially is reversed , with three poorer nations -- Poland , Greece and Hungary -- atop the list . The trend has raised deep concern among health authorities who fear that poor nations , struggling to eliminate malnutrition and lift standards of public health , face a looming , American-style epidemic of lung_cancer . One particular concern is that aggressive advertising will boost smoking among women , who now smoke in low numbers in many of the countries receiving the cigarette makers ' attention . &quot; The developing countries are sitting on a time_bomb , &quot; said Richard Peto , a noted epidemiologist at the University of Oxford in England . Worldwide , about 3 million people each year die of smoking-related causes -- about 2 million of them in the developed world , according to estimates by the World_Health_Organization . If smoking patterns continue , the annual toll will reach 10 million by the 2020s -- with about 7 million of the victims from the developing world . According to the estimates , about half the victims will die in middle_age , losing on average 20 to 25 years of life_expectancy . Industry critics say that efforts to reduce the death toll are being undermined by the aggressive marketing of tobacco multinationals . &quot; We are not afraid of foreign cigarettes , but we are afraid of their marketing prowess , &quot; said Dr. Hatai Chitanondh , a Thai physician who is president of the Asia and Pacific Assn . for Control of Tobacco . &quot; They have_the_best brains in marketing. &quot; Developing nations are often &quot; attracted to anything American , and promoting the Western lifestyle and linking these cigarettes to the United States makes them particularly attractive , &quot; said Michael Eriksen , director of the U.S. Office on Smoking and Health , who termed the tobacco_industry ' s conduct &quot; abysmal. &quot; The industry and its supporters reject the morbid arithmetic and logic of their critics . They say tobacco companies are merely competing for the loyalties of existing smokers , who in many cases had no choice until now of whose cigarettes to buy . Moreover , they argue , since U.S. brands invariably cost more in foreign markets than local brands , they do not make smoking more affordable to the poor . &quot; Smoking is not something like rock_music , which America has just exported , &quot; said Owen C . Smith , a vice_president with Philip Morris International and president of the U.S. Cigarette Export Assn . &quot; There are hundreds of millions of smokers outside the United States , &quot; he said , &quot; and the . . . issue is whether those smokers will have the liberty to choose an American product or be restricted to smoking only those made by a protected . . . local industry. &quot; But few outside the industry believe its claim that advertising simply steals smokers from rival brands rather than triggering demand . &quot; Every marketing plan . . . involves both an element of market share and market expansion , &quot; said Michael Pertschuk , former head of the Federal Trade Commission and co-director of the Advocacy Institute , a public interest_group . The marketing blitz has hit many countries where smoking was common but cigarette advertising was almost unknown . In the newly independent states of Eastern Europe and in several Asian_nations , state monopolies that supplied smokers did little or nothing to promote their brands . The Western invasion , for instance , was a wake-up call_in Japan , the world ' s fourth-largest cigarette market . Japan Tobacco , the national monopoly , has become a big advertiser at_home and is also hawking its brands abroad . Beyond advertising ' s immediate effects on smoking habits , critics fear that big media spending in target countries will induce a wave of self-censorship -- such_as the one that once chilled U.S. media coverage of smoking and health issues . Cigarette advertising &quot; will prevent the story from being told straight , &quot; Peto said . &quot; The more they ( the tobacco companies ) become established politically , the more difficult it ' s going_to be to get the information across to people. &quot; Anticipating the onslaught , some countries established restrictions or bans on tobacco advertising . But in many cases , the laws proved toothless or left loopholes that companies have been happy to exploit . Consider Russia , whose Parliament last year banned tobacco ads from radio , TV and billboards -- but without obvious effect . Russian media will not willingly sacrifice the revenue , and tobacco companies will not stop advertising as long as rivals continue to do so . In Moscow , revolutionary statues and posters have given_way to the logos and hues of Western cigarette brands , which appear on billboards , bus shelters and illuminated signs . Cigarette ads are an imposing feature of the cityscape -- not only because there are lots of them , but because in many places there is little advertising of any other kind . Indeed , wide-open Russia is a place where dedicated marketers can work off their wintertime blues . As cold and gloom descended on St . Petersburg last year , the R.J. Reynolds sales staff painted the town with the yellow and blue of the Camel brand . The troops brightened shops and kiosks with Camel stickers , posters and window_frames , and within two weeks &quot; 725 locations were Camelized , &quot; according to an account in a company newsletter . As in the United States , the cigarette makers sponsor sporting and cultural events in Russia . Philip Morris underwrote a tour by the Bolshoi Ballet . R.J. Reynolds sponsored a rock festival last spring in St . Petersburg . According to a company spokeswoman , such sponsorships &quot; play a crucial role in making sporting , cultural and entertainment events more affordable and more professional. &quot; There is little outward opposition to the smoke that seems to hang everywhere , with park_benches as likely to be smoky as nightclubs and cafes . &quot; We ' re not teaching them to smoke , &quot; Constantin Ohanian , an R.J. Reynolds vice_president , said in his St . Petersburg office last May as he used a lighter shaped like a hand_grenade to fire_up a cigarette . &quot; People here want to smoke , and we are providing them with what they want. &quot; Every autumn , Polish health authorities stage a national stop-smoking day to coincide with today ' s Great American Smokeout . But this year , tobacco companies have tried to upstage it with a simultaneous contest offering prizes for smokers , according to Dr. Witold Zatonski , a Polish physician and chairman of the International Union Against Cancer ' s tobacco and health program in Eastern Europe . The effort was especially &quot; cynical &quot; in Poland , &quot; a country in which premature death in adult men . . . is rising , &quot; Zatonski complained . Weaning Poles from the smoking habit &quot; is not very easy , &quot; he said , because &quot; the tobacco_industry is having ( a ) quite different goal. &quot; In Hungary , as in Russia , companies have found ways around the ban on cigarette advertising . Dressed in the stripes and colors of Western brands , young_women distribute free samples in cafes and bars . In the capital , Budapest , brand names such_as Marlboro and Lucky Strike , sold by British-based BAT Industries , have been incorporated in the names of pubs and coffeehouses . &quot; Camel Boots &quot; footwear stores project the brand ' s image of rugged , outdoor adventure . A German-based subsidiary runs Camel Boots , according to an R.J. Reynolds official in Hungary . But the stores are &quot; not a cigarette promotion tool , &quot; the official insisted . Hungary has seen the stirrings of anti-smoking activism . In Budapest last year , protesters pasted skulls and painted the Hungarian word for &quot; cancer &quot; on cigarette posters . Meanwhile , though , the industry is seeking more freedom to promote its brands . The head of corporate relations for Philip Morris in Hungary wrote the local heads of rival firms in December , 1992 , suggesting that an industry delegation &quot; should try to test the limits of the flexibility of the government and have a better understanding about the relation of power among ministries. &quot; &quot; The industry should continue to talk to high-level politicians to maintain pressure on the bureaucracy , &quot; said the letter , whose contents were confirmed by company officials . Although less visible than advertising , the industry ' s investment in cigarette plants in Eastern Europe is even more dramatic . Leading the way is Philip Morris , which has committed more_than $ 800 million to eight joint_ventures in Russia , Lithuania , Kazakhstan , Ukraine , Poland , Hungary , the former East_Germany and the Czech Republic -- where the company says it is the largest U.S. investor . Critics say the tobacco_industry ' s growing hold_on Eastern Europe will interfere with smoking control efforts . &quot; They ' re buying political influence by going_into these countries and saying , ' We want to help you with your economy , ' &quot; said Scott Ballin , chairman of the Coalition on Smoking OR Health , a U.S. anti-smoking group . &quot; You don ' t bite the hand that feeds you. &quot; Asia , with 54 % of the world ' s people , holds even more promise in the long_run . In many Asian_countries , smoking rates are high among men but low among women -- leaving room for market expansion . Asian anti-smoking efforts are gathering strength , but cigarette sales still are forecast to rise 13 % during the 1990s , according to Euromonitor International , a market research organization . Economic growth and rising disposable_incomes , along with less awareness of health risks than in the West , all favor the industry . In the Philippines , where nearly two-thirds of men and one-fifth of women smoke , a 1990 survey found that 57 % of respondents were unaware that cigarettes cause cancer , according to the_British journal Tobacco Control . In China , which consumes one-third of all_the cigarettes in the world , the government has signed joint manufacturing agreements with three Western tobacco giants and has agreed to begin opening its market to import brands by the end of this year . Asian_countries hold &quot; vast potential &quot; and are being &quot; heavily targeted by the tobacco multinationals , &quot; a recent Euromonitor report said . &quot; Apart from their great financial strength and worldwide marketing experience , the multinationals are in a good position to exploit the emerging markets . . . because of their global reputation and the inherent cosmopolitan nature of their brand images , &quot; the report said . American firms have already increased Asian tobacco sales by billions of dollars , thanks to help from the U.S._government . U.S. trade negotiators pressured Japan , South_Korea , Taiwan and Thailand -- which all had tobacco monopolies -- to open their markets to American cigarettes . At the industry ' s insistence , trade officials further demanded that U.S. firms be free to advertise their brands , even though cigarette advertising in the four countries had been virtually nonexistent . Japan agreed to permit a wide range of advertising , including TV commercials . Taiwan and South_Korea also accepted some forms of cigarette advertising . Exports to the four countries last year reached about 65 billion cigarettes . In Japan , U.S. brands have captured about 18 % of the market . What skilled marketers can do_in Asia is reflected in Marlboro ' s conquest of Hong Kong -- an accomplishment detailed in an oral history exhibit at the Smithsonian Institution ' s Center for Advertising History . Marlboro was a nothing brand in Hong Kong , with less than 1 % of the market , when Philip Morris began its campaign in 1976 . The company discovered that Marlboro ' s cowboy symbol was an ambiguous figure to the Chinese -- rugged and tough , but also an itinerant who slept outdoors and could be perceived as a coolie . So Philip Morris produced new TV spots for Hong Kong in which the cowboy was presented as a boss -- a clean-cut man of property who lived_in a big ranch_house and rode a white_horse , a symbol of luck . When Marlboro dislodged Reynolds ' Winston cigarettes as America ' s most popular brand in rankings compiled by a U.S. analyst , Philip Morris made_it a big event in Hong Kong . A well-known TV personality was flown to New York and stationed outside Philip Morris ' Park_Avenue headquarters to make the announcement by live satellite link . Another time , Philip Morris bought the front pages of all_of Hong Kong ' s major newspapers for an &quot; advertorial &quot; on the success of Marlboro , recalled William I . Campbell , former vice_president of Philip Morris Asia and now president of Philip Morris USA . &quot; So on the given day , Jan . 10 or something like that , you go_past . . . the street newsstand , and . . . all_of the 10 newspapers , they all have the same front page , &quot; Campbell told a Smithsonian interviewer . &quot; That was great fun. &quot; Marlboro soon became Hong Kong ' s leading brand and now holds a market share of more_than 40 % . Tobacco firms in Asia cannot always use the weapons that Marlboro employed in Hong Kong . Hong Kong itself has placed limits on tobacco ads ; in Thailand , direct cigarette advertising is banned . But Philip Morris , the world ' s biggest tobacco company , still does what it can . Last year in Bangkok , the company staged a pair of concerts in its &quot; Superband &quot; series with Tony Bennett and the McCoy Tyner Trio . It announced that it would donate proceeds to a charity founded by Thailand ' s most revered figure , its king . In Asia , as in the United States , Philip Morris has sought to win friends and quiet critics through lavish support of the arts . This fall , it underwrote a gala international arts competition for the six countries of the Assn . of Southeast Asian_Nations . The cigarette makers have shown real ingenuity in Malaysia . The country banned direct TV advertising of cigarette brands , so the U.S. and European tobacco firms have attached their brand names and logos to a host of unrelated products and services for which no ad restrictions exist . Malaysia , for example , has Salem Power_Stations -- youth-oriented music stores named for R.J. Reynolds ' popular menthol brand . There also have been lavish TV ads for &quot; Salem Holidays. &quot; Attractive young couples stroll through alpine scenery as music plays and a narrator intones : &quot; Salem High Country -- a world of refreshment ! &quot; But there is no information on destinations , travel dates or prices , and a travel_agency ' s name appears only in the fine print . When a documentary_film crew from Yorkshire Television of England sent a representative to book a Salem Holiday , the travel_agent told him : &quot; No , no , no . We only advertise the name. &quot; &quot; Salem Power_Station and Salem Holidays . . . are real businesses , &quot; R.J. Reynolds said in a written response to questions from The Times . &quot; Neither sell cigarettes , &quot; the statement said . Use of the Salem name &quot; is consistent with practices around the world to extend valuable trademarks to unrelated products. &quot; Correspondent Sam Loewenberg in Budapest and Emily Harris of The Times ' Moscow Bureau contributed to this report . NEXT : The opening of the world ' s most prized cigarette market -- China . Tobacco ' s Long Road Americans are smoking less -- much less -- than in years past , dropping from the ranks of the world ' s biggest smokers per capita . But U.S. tobacco companies are making_up for declining domestic consumption by dramatically boosting cigarette exports and sales fromm factories abroad .

Reynolds 141 174.7 315.7 Source : Company annual reports * includes sales from factories abroad Powerhouse Lobbyists Seeking to penetrate foreign markets , tobacco companies have sought the help of some powerhouse lobbyists and advisers . Among them : Margaret Thatcher : A critic of smoking while Britain ' s prime_minister , Thatcher has since become a consultant to the world ' s biggest tobacco company , Philip Morris . Thatcher declined to be interviewed , and spokeswoman Miranda Granger would not discuss her work for Philip Morris , reportedly a three-year deal worth $ 1 million . The company was tight-lipped , too . &quot; She ' s a consultant on geopolitical affairs . End of statement , &quot; said Elizabeth Cho of Philip Morris International . In a March , 1992 , memo , Geoffrey C . Bible , then executive_vice_president and now president and chief_executive of Philip Morris , outlined issues facing the firm ' s tobacco and food businesses where Thatcher &quot; may be able to offer guidance and assistance. &quot; They included : &quot; China Entry Strategy , &quot; &quot; Vietnam Entry Strategy , &quot; &quot; Singapore Anti-tobacco Programs &quot; , and privatization of tobacco monopolies in Japan , Taiwan , Korea and Thailand . Clayton Yeutter : U.S. trade representative and then secretary_of_agriculture in the Reagan and Bush_administrations , Yeutter has since joined the board of British-based BAT Industries , the world ' s second-largest tobacco company . As trade representative from 1985-89 , Yeutter forced the governments of Taiwan , South_Korea , and Japan to let_in American tobacco products . Export sales by U.S. tobacco firms rose more_than $ 1 billion per year . During at least part of his tenure as trade representative , the Yeutter family had stock in RJR Nabisco and Philip Morris -- some in his name , some held_in trust for a daughter , according to disclosure statements Yeutter filed . He sold the stock when he became agriculture_secretary . Carla A . Hills : Yeutter ' s successor as U.S. trade representative from 1989- ' 93 , Hills helped U.S. cigarette makers crack Thailand ' s tobacco monopoly . Earlier this year , RJR and Philip Morris retained Hills ' law and consulting firms to help fight a Canadian proposal to require plain packaging of cigarettes sold in that country . In an opinion submitted to Canadian authorities , Hills concluded that the packaging rules would violate international trademark laws . Richard V . Allen and Michael K . Deaver : In the mid-1980s , Allen , former national security advisor to President Reagan , was hired as a lobbyist by R.J. Reynolds in its battle to enter the South_Korean tobacco market . As a countermeasure , Philip Morris hired Deaver , a former Reagan White_House aide . Deaver was retained for $ 250 # 000 in response to rumors that Allen was telling the South_Koreans that Philip Morris was aligned with Democrats and lacked influence in the Reagan White_House . To shore_up its Republican credentials , Philip Morris also engaged lobbyist Michelle Laxalt , daughter of former senator and Reagan confidante Paul Laxalt . When Deaver was tried in 1987 on charges of lying to Congress and a federal grand_jury about his lobbying activities , a Philip Morris memo was introduced as evidence . The memo boasted that Deaver &quot; was given a welcome ordinarily reserved for the highest foreign dignitaries &quot; when he visited South_Korea on Philip Morris ' behalf . However , South_Korea did not open its doors to American cigarettes until 1988 , in response to the threat of trade sanctions . Deaver was convicted and sentenced to probation , community service and a $ 100 # 000 fine .</TEXT>
