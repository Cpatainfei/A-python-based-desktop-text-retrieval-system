   <HEADLINE> AREA ' S SMOG YEAR ALMOST AS CLEAN AS RECORD 1993</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In Glendora , the nation ' s smog capital , the quality of the air depends_on your perspective . An average of once every 18 days since May , the town at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains has been smothered by air deemed so unsafe to breathe that even healthy people were warned to stay indoors . But as bleak as that seems , 1994 has been a breath of fresh air for Glendora and other Southland cities compared to the foul 1970s and much of the 1980s , when smog alerts and summer afternoons went hand in_hand . Embracing the good news / bad news philosophy of a longtime sufferer , the four-county Southland ended its May-through-October smog season Monday closely mirroring 1993 , which was the cleanest year in more_than 40 years of record-keeping . By a slim margin , this year set a record low for ozone-based smog alerts in the basin that comprises Los Angeles , Orange , San Bernardino and Riverside counties , according to measurements by the South Coast Air Quality Management District . Stage 1 alerts occurred on 23 days compared to 24 days in 1993 , 41 in 1992 and 121 days in 1977 . On the other hand , health advisories , which mean the pollution poses a serious threat but not enough for a full-scale alert , were recorded on 96 days , up slightly from 92 days in 1993 and much better than 1992 ' s 109 . The trend toward milder smog seasons is promising to local and state air quality officials , who believe their regulations have set the Los Angeles Basin on a permanent path toward meeting the elusive goal of blue_skies . The peak concentration of ozone -- a colorless , lung-scarring oxidizing gas that is the Southland ' s most pervasive pollutant -- has dropped 33 % in 15 years , largely because of emissions controls on cars and industrial_plants , according to AQMD data . AQMD senior meteorologist Joseph Cassmassi said even with stagnant air and other weather_conditions that foster ozone , he does not expect the Southland to return to the severe levels of the past . Annual smog alerts for ozone , he said , will probably never top 35 days -- as they did_in 1992 -- and could soon dip below 20 . &quot; We expect with pretty adverse weather_conditions we would see 30 to 35 episodes . Keep_in mind , 10 years ago , it would have been 100 episodes under those same conditions , &quot; he said . Much of the time , however , the air remains unhealthful . An average of once every two to three days , or 118 days this year , the national health standard for ozone was violated in at least one part of the basin . This year ' s worst ozone concentration -- 0.3 parts per million recorded in Glendora on Aug . 5 -- exceeded the standard 2 1 / 2 times . Even more distressing , AQMD officials say the Southland will keep violating the health limit at least through 2010 -- even if every element of its controversial anti-smog plan , which will cost at least $ 5 billion a year , is enacted . Next week , the California Air Resources Board meets in Sacramento to decide whether to adopt a far-reaching 20-year clean air plan for the state . Dr. Henry Gong , a USC medical professor who has performed numerous studies on urban air_pollution , said 1994 ' s concentrations of ozone remained severe enough to gradually deplete the lung function of even healthy adults . &quot; The bad news is we still have the nation ' s worst ozone concentrations and the concern is not so_much acute health effects , but chronic health effects , &quot; he said . Medical research shows lungs seem to age prematurely from the ozone in the Los Angeles Basin ' s air . Glendora residents suffered twice as much loss of lung function every year than residents of Tucson , which does not have an ozone pollution problem , according to studies by UCLA scientists . &quot; It ' s an insidious type of thing . You don ' t have to be symptomatic . When you breathe ozone it causes changes in your airways that you don ' t realize , &quot; Gong said . &quot; It ' s like hypertension , sort of a silent killer . Ozone decreases your breathing reserve , and perhaps other reserves in your body . It also makes you more susceptible to lung infections. &quot; During smog alerts , the air is deemed unsafe for everyone within the affected area , and even healthy people are advised to avoid the outdoors or risk symptoms of acute smog sickness , such_as chest_pain , shortness of breath and stinging eyes , as well as long-term lung damage . Even highly trained , healthy athletes can suffer . In Gong ' s 1984 studies , Olympic cyclists exposed to Stage 1 levels of ozone in a smog chamber had substantially worsened lung function and exercise performance and symptoms such_as shortness of breath . Their cycling performance also worsened at a much lower concentration , one that frequently occurs throughout the Los Angeles Basin . Asthmatics and people with other lung diseases also say they can notice the difference between a good smog year and a bad one . &quot; Anecdotally , my clinical impression is the cleaner the air the better the lung health of my patients , &quot; said Gong , who treats respiratory patients as chief of environmental health service at Rancho Los Amigos Medical_School in Downey . Although anti-smog rules deserve credit for the long-term decline in ozone , when it comes_to year-to-year fluctuations , weather is the key factor . Ozone , or photochemical smog , is formed when hydrocarbons and nitrogen_oxides released by motor_vehicles , industries and other sources react with strong sunlight and are trapped near the ground by inversion layers . Cloudy skies and ocean breezes prevent its formation . Cassmassi said 1994 turned_out much milder than expected because of strong sea_breezes in late August and September , which usually is one of the smoggiest periods . No alerts have been recorded for almost three months . A low-pressure area hovered off the coast , drawing southerly winds through the atmosphere and weakening the inversion layer . &quot; It has been an extraordinarily clean two-month period , &quot; Cassmassi said . An early hot , smoggy streak in June and cool late-summer breezes canceled each other out , bringing average weather_conditions for the year that neither fostered nor deterred heavy ozone buildup . Because the pollutants that create ozone are emitted mostly near the coast but move toward the mountains before reacting , ozone is most severe in the San Gabriel , Santa Clarita and San Bernardino valleys . Glendora , Crestline , Fontana , San Bernardino , Redlands , Upland and Santa Clarita suffered the worst smog in the four counties this year . While maintaining its stigma as the U.S. smog capital , Glendora , in the eastern San Gabriel Valley , suffered dramatically fewer days of severe smog this year than last . Glendora ' s 10 smog alerts compared to 19 in 1993 , and Azusa , with two alert days this year and 11 last year , vastly improved . Pasadena and Pomona also had good years . Downtown Los Angeles -- which many people wrongly perceive as a symbol of smog -- has experienced no alerts for two years in a row , compared to eight a decade ago . Riverside fared almost as well , with two alert days , better than 1993 ' s five . On the other hand , Orange County ' s air worsened a bit , with two alert days in La Habra and one in Anaheim , while there were none in 1993 . Air quality also declined in San Bernardino ( eight alert days ) , Santa Clarita ( six alert days ) , Crestline ( nine alert days ) and Fontana ( nine alert days ) . Cassmassi said those areas probably worsened because of temporary , local wind patterns , not increases in emissions there . Ventura County has a much less severe ozone problem than the Los Angeles Basin , but the county still violated the federal health standard 15 days this year , an increase of two days from last year but much fewer than in the 1980s . The county had no smog alerts . Although the ozone season has ended , the Southland ' s other pollution problems have just begun . Carbon_monoxide , which can endanger heart patients , and nitrogen-based pollution that causes a whiskey-brown haze , peak in winter weather_conditions . Although those pollutants can reach levels severe enough to trigger health alerts , they too , have been steadily declining .</TEXT>
