   <HEADLINE> MIKE DOWNEY : THOMAS NOW BECOMES A JURASSIC BOSS OF HIS DREAM TEAM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> His brothers became pimps . Two of them . They also dealt drugs . His family lived_on a very mean street . When some gang members came toward him with join-or-else in their eyes , his mother stepped_out onto the porch with a shotgun . They scattered . Another day , when he was 12 , he was playing basketball . One guy claimed : &quot; I got next game. &quot; A second guy came_along and said no , he had the winners next . The first guy went_home and got his gun . He came_back and began shooting . The 12-year-old boy hid under a car . He saw the body of the second guy drop . On special occasions , his mother came_home from Our Lady of Sorrows church with baskets of food . The minister had passed them out . His mother had nine mouths to feed . He still remembers , &quot; Turkey and all_the trimmings . Two days a year , Christmas and Thanksgiving , we always ate good. &quot; Other days , he had little to eat . He went_into a corner grocery and stole some plums . Stuffed them into his pockets . Two of the plums slipped through a hole in his pants , fell to the floor . A cop came and dragged him off to the station_house , acting tough , talking raw , terrifying the kid , saying : &quot; Goin ' to Cook County ( jail ) , boy . Gonna throw you inside till you ' re old . Gonna be somebody ' s girlfriend. &quot; He cried and cried until his mother came . Then he cried harder , because he was more afraid of her than of jail . His could have been a less-than-wonderful life . Last month , however , upon turning 33 , he took early retirement from his job . He went_into a business partnership with another firm . A multi-millionaire now , a solid citizen , a local legend , a civic-minded individual who once proposed something called &quot; No Crime Day &quot; once a year , he has gone from being captain of a basketball_team to a captain of industry . Isiah Thomas is no longer a player . He ' s an owner . Upon investing in Toronto ' s new NBA franchise and beating out his longtime friend Magic Johnson in the process , Thomas understands how far he has come . In celebration of his new status , he recalls , chuckling , &quot; It wasn ' t that long ago when I didn ' t have a nickel in my pocket . When I didn ' t have a pocket. &quot; Long ago and far away . He was this chipmunk-cheeked , precocious pee-wee who led the older_boys out onto the creaky floor at Our Lady of Sorrows and then at halftime put_on fancy-dribbling exhibitions , so deft at it that he even got featured in Reader ' s Digest . In his teens , to stay_away_from the temptations and turmoil of the neighborhood , he rose before dawn and took public transportation to a far Chicago suburb , to play basketball at a parochial_school . Both he and his childhood buddy Mark Aguirre dropped_out of college and went_for the money . At a dinner for three , December 1981 , atop a Dallas hotel before their first professional game against one another , Thomas , already thinking big , asked : &quot; So , what should we do next ? &quot; Aguirre , thinking bigger , said : &quot; Co-MVPs in the NBA ? &quot; Thomas , laughing , slapping the table , said : &quot; Maybe we could just buy a team. &quot; He was 20 . After retiring from the Detroit Pistons with two diamond rings , more_than 19 # 000 points , a five-bedroom home with an indoor basketball_court in Bloomfield Hills and a promise of a company position for life , Thomas connected with an investment group that was bidding for the NBA ' s first expansion venture to Canada . Putting opportunity before old loyalties , he says , &quot; I always imagined that I ' d be a Detroit Piston for life . But this was too good a chance to pass_up . How many times in a man ' s life does something like this come_along ? &quot; Last week , when a tin-and-tissue hoop with the Toronto Raptors ' comical dinosaur logo was unveiled , it was Isiah Thomas who came crashing through it . It was Raptor rapture . He did everything but yell , &quot; Yabba-dabba-doo ! &quot; Reports say he owns a nice piece , maybe 10 % . Doesn ' t matter . Thomas is doing what so many others -- Magic , Walter Payton , Reggie Jackson -- have dreamed about . He is labor becoming management . He is not only busting through hoops ; he is breaking_down barriers that have limited ownership opportunities to his people and to his colleagues . Shooting hoops wasn ' t indentured servitude , obviously , yet it had occurred to Thomas early on , &quot; You always wonder if anybody ' s going_to be willing to treat you with respect , treat you as a businessman , same way they would someone else . Even if you ' ve got the money and you come knocking_on the door , you wonder , are they going_to let you in ? &quot; With self-made wealth , he learned how rich people lived . One day , early in his pro career , Thomas swears that teammate Bill Laimbeer on an airport runway pointed to a smaller craft and said , &quot; There , that ' s just like the one my father just got. &quot; &quot; Yeah , right . Mine , too , &quot; Isiah remembers saying . Thomas fought for everything he got . Sometimes literally . He got caught showing an interest in someone ' s girlfriend at Indiana University and got punched_in the face . He once slapped Rick Mahorn , a foot taller , in the face . Scuffled with Laimbeer , too . Even got_into it once with Johnson , who tried to slap Thomas ' face . Of course , before their one NBA championship series together , Isiah also kissed Magic ' s face . After retiring , he said : &quot; It ' s hard to believe all that ' s over . Him and me , both out of the game . Larry Bird , Laimbeer , ( Kevin ) McHale . Maybe Charles ( Barkley ) , too . We ' re all young men. &quot; What does he do now ? Find new young_men . Somewhere some_other kid is out there , surviving the rough stuff , dreaming the dream . He will never play with Isiah Thomas . But maybe he can play for Isiah Thomas .</TEXT>
