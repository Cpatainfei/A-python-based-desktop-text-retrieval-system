   <HEADLINE> MUSIC REVIEWS ; SPIRITUAL OUTING BY JUBILEE SINGERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Was it a concert or a three-hour , high-energy revival meeting ? Sometimes the boundaries blurred at the 30th anniversary celebration of the Albert McNeil Jubilee Singers , but one thing remained clear -- impressive voices continue to abound_in this fine group . Though dedicated to disseminating a broad body of African American music to international audiences , Sunday night , as guests of the Los Angeles Master Chorale , the singers appeared most moved by spirituals -- the genre that first incited their assemblage under McNeil . Here , working mostly a cappella at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion , fervor and improvisatory talent shone -- particularly through Muriel Bennett ' s soulful and immaculate soprano for &quot; I Wanna Be Ready &quot; and the gutsy and fluid , admirably controlled voice of another soprano -- Victoria Burnett , in &quot; I Been in the Storm So Long. &quot; Among the men , the clear tenor of Thomas Young , a former member returning as guest soloist , soared over an enthusiastic choral backdrop in &quot; Sinner Man , &quot; and Carver Cossey ' s baritone emerged rich and evocative during &quot; John the Revelator. &quot; Other styles did not always receive convincing treatment . Soprano Lisa Gray-Ashley could not meet the vocal demands of excerpts from &quot; Carmen Jones &quot; -- Oscar Hammerstein ' s re-texting of Bizet ' s &quot; Carmen &quot; -- though she vamped her way through Yvonne Farrow ' s alternately steamy and humorous choreography well enough . Many of the lively arrangements came from within the chorus ; Larry Farrow claimed the most , but Dianne and Michael Wright , Richard Jackson , Byron Smith -- the rousing , foot-stomping piano accompanist -- and McNeil himself all contributed . The founder and his assistant Paul Smith took time to pay tribute to all who had aided and inspired during the ensemble ' s three decades , most notably in a guest-conducting spot for 92-year-old Jester Hairston , who directed his adaptation of &quot; In That Great Gettin ' Up Mornin. &quot; The Rev . John Nix-McReynolds -- minister of the Second Baptist_Church in Santa Ana -- belted_out the tenor solo . SUSAN BLISS</TEXT>
