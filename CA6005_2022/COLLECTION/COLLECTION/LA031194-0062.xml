   <HEADLINE> A SCRAMBLE TO SCRUTINIZE ' 3 STRIKES ' LAW ; COURTS : PROSECUTORS AND DEFENSE_ATTORNEYS LOOK FOR WAYS NEW MEASURE COULD BE CIRCUMVENTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Uncertainty about California ' s new &quot; three strikes and you ' re out &quot; law pervaded court deliberations in Los Angeles County on Thursday , with judges , prosecutors and defense_attorneys in the country ' s busiest judicial_system scurrying to make_sense of its strict -- and sometimes confusing -- sentencing requirements . Judge Cecil Mills , supervisor for Los Angeles Superior_Court , called_on several top judges to determine if the already crowded court system can handle an expected surge in jury trials . Court officials are anticipating a flood of requests for such trials from convicted felons who previously might have accepted plea bargains but now face stiff mandatory sentences if found guilty under the new law . &quot; The courts are already on the edge of collapse , &quot; said Acting Public_Defender David Meyer , who added that the deluge of jury trials could force criminal cases into civil courtrooms or the hiring of additional judges . &quot; Major systemic problems of this nature are only going_to make_it more serious. &quot; At the same time , the district_attorney ' s office summoned a team of nine top prosecutors to analyze the new statute word by word and begin anticipating arguments that defense_attorneys will make in efforts to circumvent its harsh sentencing requirements . Under the law that took_effect Monday , anyone who has two prior convictions for serious or violent felonies and commits any felony on a third offense must be sentenced to a minimum of 25 years to life . The law also prescribes mandatory sentences for criminals who commit a second felony after having committed a prior serious or violent felony , as well as felons who had committed certain crimes as juveniles . &quot; We need to stay ahead of the curve on this one , &quot; Assistant Dist . Atty . Dan Murphy said . &quot; We expect that the longer defense_lawyers have to look_at this statute the more creative they will become in finding ways to attack it. &quot; At least three new cases were filed by Los Angeles County prosecutors Thursday under the new law , including charges against a man who allegedly hit his mother in the head with a hammer , a 36-year-old man accused of stealing a car and trying to run_over a pursuing officer , and a convicted robber who allegedly burglarized cars . Public_defenders and defense_lawyers also began devising strategies for their clients , with most saying the statute ' s harsh penalties will force them to recommend against plea bargains . The overwhelming majority of cases in Los Angeles and around the country are resolved through plea arrangements . &quot; Why would anyone plead guilty knowing they ' re facing 25 years to life ? &quot; asked Vincent James Oliver , a defense_attorney . &quot; At least you have a shot if you can get one juror on your side. &quot; Questions also focused_on confusion surrounding the new law ' s effect on death_penalty and juvenile cases . Los Angeles County Deputy Public_Defender Charles Gessler , who coordinates death_penalty defenses , said ambiguous language in the new law can be interpreted as doing_away_with the death_penalty . In juvenile cases , some attorneys worry that the new law will deny youngsters due-process rights because juveniles are not tried before a jury , but an offense may count as a &quot; strike. &quot; Also , prosecutors said the law subjects juveniles to a harsher standard than adults because certain crimes committed by 16- and 17-year-olds count as &quot; strikes , &quot; but comparable offenses committed by adults do not .
