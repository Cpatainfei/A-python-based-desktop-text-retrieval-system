   <TEXT> The dollar rose broadly Monday , posting one of biggest single-day gains against the Japanese yen this month , on optimism for a trade deal that will help cut the nagging U.S. deficit with Japan . Stocks closed mixed and yields were unchanged or nudged upward . Across-the-board weakness in the German mark amid uncertainty about next month ' s federal elections in Germany and the possibility of another U.S. interest_rate hike today also helped advance the dollar , market participants said . In the near term , a rate increase would boost the U.S. currency by making dollar-denominated deposits more attractive . The dollar surged nearly a full yen in Europe on news that Japanese Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto would meet in Washington with top Clinton_Administration officials , seeking to head_off U.S. sanctions in_advance of a Friday deadline . In London , the dollar rose almost a full yen to 98.63 yen from 97.65 , ending the day even higher in New York at 98.85. The mark was at 1.5537 marks , up from 1.5480.

The Nasdaq index ended down 1.83 at 755.63. &quot; Certainly the broad market direction is still down . Frankly , this could be a pretty wild week , &quot; said John H . Shaughnessy , director_of_research for Advest Inc. Many market_strategists believed the central_bank would postpone any action until at least next month , but several investment banks , including Goldman Sachs &amp; Co . and Bear , Stearns &amp; Co. , predicted a rate hike . &quot; Once that ' s out of the way one way or another , I think there ' s a good chance the market may have a little bit of a bounce here , &quot; said Walter Revis , market_analyst at Principal Financial Securities .
