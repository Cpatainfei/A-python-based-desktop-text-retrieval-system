   <HEADLINE> EXOTIC BANGKOK GROANS UNDER TRAFFIC GRIDLOCK ; THAILAND : MOST OF THE CITY ' S CANALS HAVE BEEN PAVED OVER TO MAKE ROOM FOR MORE THAN 3 MILLION CARS AND ALMOST AS MANY MOTORCYCLES -- QUADRUPLE THE NUMBER 10 YEARS AGO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This noisy Southeast Asian capital used to be known as the &quot; Venice of the East. &quot; Its graceful canals were so colorful and exotic that foreign visitors called them an opium smoker ' s vision of Asia . But these days people spend so_much time in their cars caught in gridlock traffic that one of the hottest-selling items in Bangkok department_stores and automobile service_stations is a portable urinal for the car . Marketed as the &quot; Ezee-Pee &quot; and &quot; Comfort 100 , &quot; the devices come_with female attachments and are becoming standard in taxis and many family cars . &quot; Our society is going mad , &quot; said Thongchai Panswad , an engineering professor at Bangkok ' s Chulalongkorn University . &quot; Bangkok traffic reached a critical stage some five years ago , but no one took the problems seriously until recently. &quot; Most of Bangkok ' s the canals , or &quot; klongs , &quot; have been paved over to make room for more_than 3 millions cars and almost as_many motorcycles -- quadruple the number of vehicles on city streets only 10 years ago . A just-concluded United Nations conference confirms what most of the 8 million residents of this Southeast Asian capital have known for a long_time : Two decades of skyrocketing economic_growth have turned Bangkok into the gridlock capital of the world . Today 12-minute waits for red_lights are common , and so is traffic that snakes along at an average pace of 5 m.p.h. So_much lead is dumped in the air from vehicle exhaust fumes that babies are routinely born with blood levels that exceed 20 micrograms of lead per deciliter -- a threshold figure the United States and other Western governments label a &quot; serious public health risk &quot; because that much lead destroys nerve and brain_cells . And lead is only one of 18 toxic substances in Bangkok ' s foul-smelling air that exceed maximum levels considered safe by international standards . Restaurant owners say business is bad because traffic_jams that continue past midnight keep Thais at_home and foreign visitors in their hotels fearing for their health . So severe are Bangkok ' s problems that the United Nations has dubbed it the &quot; most polluted megacity on Earth. &quot; Thailand ' s economy is expected to grow 7.7 % this year , a figure that would otherwise be the envy of most industrial countries , but traffic_jams will shave 1 % off the country ' s surging economic expansion . According to official estimates , in the last six months , 93 # 000 new cars have joined the vehicular fray . About 450 new motorcycles per day also appeared on streets . Experts say not much can be done about traffic congestion anytime soon , besides tallying up the human and environmental costs . According to the United Nations , Bangkok ' s growing pains are part of an unprecedented demographic upheaval shared by a dozen other Asian cities with populations approaching 10 million . While only one-third of all Asians live_in cities today , U.N. forecasters say 55 % of the region ' s people will be urban dwellers by the year 2025 -- a population_shift of about 1.5 billion persons , or more_than the entire population of China . Bangkok authorities have tried changing school and office hours , set_up one-way bus lanes on major streets , and built scores of overpasses atop major intersections -- all with no apparent effect on the gridlock . Trips to and from the office now eat_up an average of 40 working_days a year . The 15-mile trip from the city_center to Don Muang Airport can take as long as three or four hours , prompting at least one luxury hotel to start a helicopter service . Hundreds of less well-heeled tourists check_out of their Bangkok hotels a day ahead of their departure_time and into lodgings closer to the airport , thus ensuring they will not miss early morning flights . City planners say laying more asphalt is not the answer to Bangkok ' s traffic_jams -- or those of other Asian capitals . Only a system of satellite cities and mass-transit railways can save Bangkok from the congestion and pollution that officials say they are powerless to stop , according to one authoritative report issued last year . But several mass-transit schemes have been left in doubt by bureaucratic snarls and skeptical investors . A recently opened $ 1.1-billion &quot; second-stage expressway &quot; has turned_into a fiasco , in part because contractors and Thai bureaucrats could not agree on how to divide revenues from a hefty $ 1.20 toll charge that has outraged motorists using the new 12.5-mile-long road . Proposed solutions to Bangkok ' s problems include providing more buses and reducing the number of cars through higher taxes or production quotas . The state-owned Bangkok Mass Transit Authority runs 10 # 000 regular buses , but the operation loses $ 80 # 000 a day due_to low fares . A current plan calls_for building two routes for extra-long buses in the downtown area that would include tracks , so other vehicles couldn ' t use the lanes . Some politicians want to adopt a system similar to neighboring Singapore , where motorists buy special permits to enter heavily traveled downtown streets . But it seems hard to separate Thais from their automobiles at any price . A new study says that car sales are accelerating , especially luxury models . As if Bangkok didn ' t have enough problems , elephants are descending on the city in search of food , adding_to the congestion . Thailand banned commercial logging five years ago after a landslide buried two villages in the northwest , putting thousands of elephants out of their jobs hauling freshly cut timber from tropical hardwood forests . Their natural habitat now in shambles , some elephants have begun infiltrating large cities . &quot; Life is more_than just money , &quot; said Pisit Patalung , secretary_general of the Wildlife Fund of Thailand . &quot; We have got_to protect our forgotten friends like the elephants , who end_up going berserk in the Bangkok traffic because of the noise and fumes. &quot;</TEXT>
