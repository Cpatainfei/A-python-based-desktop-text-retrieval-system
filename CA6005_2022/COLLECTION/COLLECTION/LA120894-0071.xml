   <HEADLINE> SURFING : THE KING OF THE WAVES GETS A WAKEUP CALL FROM DANA HILLS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We ' ve got frigid waters off Orange County beaches , Rockin ' Fig is back from the national amateur championships in Florida , and the big shootout between the Dana Hills and Huntington Beach high_school surf teams is now history . First , let ' s talk school contest . Dana Hills won , a major blow to Huntington Coach Andy Verdone . The defeat , at Huntington ' s pier on Nov . 21 , stunned Verdone , who praised Dana Hills Coach Junji Nakamura . &quot; ( Nakamura ) came_down with a well-organized team , &quot; Verdone said . &quot; He outcoached me . He ' s a genius . He came better prepared. &quot; Yo , Figgy , did you hear that ? Verdone called another coach a genius ! Fig was a member of Huntington ' s 1974 championship team . For Verdone to take a step back and say the guy outcoached him , that ' s pretty heavy . Actually , the defeat comes when Huntington Beach thought it had the team of teams . There were two recent transfers , Justin Harcharic from Seal Beach and Mikey Reilly from Los Alamitos , and HB thought it would have_the_best team ever . And here they go and are upset . The victory marks the first time that Dana Hills has beaten Huntington Beach since 1980 . In Nakamura ' s press_release ( yup , he sent one ) , he humbly called it &quot; the best high_school surf team contest of the CENTURY ! &quot; Verdone said the showdown was the last heat . Huntington needed a sweep but came_up short . &quot; They ended_up winning by 5 points . How many points in all ? Oh , don ' t make me look it up . I ' ve been trying to forget this. &quot; Wait until Jan . 24 for the rematch at Salt Creek . Both teams have been demolishing their opponents by 15 to 25 points . Huntington is unbeaten in the Sunset League , and Dana Hills remains undefeated in the South Coast league . Fig , you think Dana Hills is going_to win the national championship this year ? Naw . I ' ll say this : Dana Hills better watch_out . Because from everything I ' ve heard , Huntington still has a pretty killer team , and it ' s ready for revenge , despite the defeat . Watch HB take ' em at the nationals ! I don ' t know , Fig . They got a coach named Junji . That should be worth a_few points . Speaking of contests , Fig , how did you do at the U.S. Surfing Federation Amateur Championships ? ( Fig , a former national title holder , surfed in the senior men ' s championships two weeks ago at Sebastian Inlet in Florida. ) Uhhh , I got sixth place . Eeeeek ! What happened ? Well , I was in the semifinals late in the day , and the wind was blowing 35 mph . Major whitecaps . I tried to get a_few waves , but they just , like , crumbled . Congratulations , however , are in_order for Kim Hamrock , 34 , of Huntington Beach , who successfully defended her women ' s championship . Debbie Bradbury of Huntington Beach won first place in women ' s bodyboard ; Geoff Moysa of San Clemente won the individual paddle race and was a member of the winning paddle-race team . Switching gears to the world title races : Graham Cassidy , the Assn . of Surfing Professionals ' executive_director , said pro Lisa Andersen of Florida , who has been the points leader for women all year , will not compete in Hawaii this month . Cassidy said Andersen suffered a herniated_disc in her lower back and will try to salvage a world title at the final contest of the season in Australia early next year . &quot; This means the women ' s title race is now back on in_earnest , &quot; Cassidy said . Fig ' s bummed by the news . She ' s been tearing it up all year . I know her back went_out in Brazil and that she could barely surf down there . Before she got injured and pulled_out , it was looking_like a U.S. sweep for men ' s and women ' s pros with Kelly Slater and Lia . As for Slater , the men ' s event is the Pipeline Classic , going_on through Friday . Slater won this event last year and has amassed so many contest points this season that if he makes the semifinals , Cassidy said , &quot; it ' s in the bag. &quot; Tell you the truth , the way Kelly ' s been surfing this year , he ' s got no problem . He ' s more focused . Last year , he had plenty of distractions , like a knee injury , breaking_up with his girlfriend , and his starring role in &quot; Baywatch. &quot; This year , he ' s quit the TV_program and he ' s focused . Really a new character . As for the cold : Water temperatures have been around an icy 55 to 56 degrees . I asked Fig how has he kept warm . I ' ve been wearing my fur-lined Speedos out there . * Best Quote : &quot; Nostalgia is nostalgia . But three fins hold you in. &quot; -- state parks ranger Doug ( Doheny Doug ) Harding , 43 , who prefers longboards with three fins rather than one . * Protest : The Long_Beach / North Orange County Surfrider Foundation chapter is urging friends of the coastline to bring surfboards and join in Saturday at a protest against development of the Bolsa Chica wetlands . Meet at Warner Avenue and Pacific Coast Highway from 9 to 11 a.m. The plan is to line the shoulder of the highway with people and surfers holding_on to their boards .
