   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY ; OFFICIALS SAY CITRON RESISTED PLANS FOR OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE ; INVESTMENTS : EX-TREASURER THOUGHT COUNTY PANEL COULD NOT PROPERLY REPRESENT THE VARIED INVESTORS , AND THE GROUP WOULD SLOW HIS WORK IN THE FAST-PACED MARKET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An oversight committee that was supposed to scrutinize the practices of now-departed county Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron never held an official meeting because Citron did not like the concept and refused to participate , county officials say . Orange County Auditor-Controller Steve E . Lewis proposed in a 1987 county audit that a broad-based panel -- including the county ' s top administrator and a member of the Board of Supervisors -- should monitor Citron ' s operations on a regular basis . But a member of the auditor ' s office who was close to the situation said Citron opposed having a committee and repeatedly frustrated efforts by Lewis and others to convene the group on an informal basis with him to try the idea out . &quot; Citron said no , &quot; said the official , who requested anonymity . &quot; They went_ahead informally to show Citron that they would not usurp him . But you could tell it would not work . There was no interaction , and it just died a quiet death. &quot; The fate of the committee is similar to what happened to a string of Orange County Grand_Jury reports and other county audits that formed a crescendo of warnings about Citron ' s operation during the past 13 years . Whether the oversight committee could have avoided the disastrous investment strategy that led to the nation ' s largest municipal bankruptcy , no one will ever know . But county sources said it might have added a valuable check_in an office that has traditionally operated with little oversight . &quot; There was the potential for more scrutiny , &quot; said the auditor ' s official . &quot; It is hard to say what might have happened . It could have been an active committee and gotten involved in the operation . Things might have been different. &quot; Neither Citron nor his attorney could be reached for comment . He has maintained in the past that oversight was unnecessary and would hamper the treasurer ' s ability to make investment decisions in a fast-paced market . County auditors recommended the oversight committee in an Oct . 20 , 1987 , report , which disclosed their findings from an examination of the treasurer ' s procedures and accounting practices for the entire year of 1986 . The audit detailed a list of management problems , including a lack of written procedures , incomplete record-keeping , and the continual failure of Citron to report the office ' s investment policies to the auditor-controller as required by the Board of Supervisors . The 1987 audit by Lewis ' office took_note of a 1985 Orange County Grand_Jury report that stated that there was little or no review of Citron ' s investment activity by the County Board of Supervisors , the county administrative officer or the auditor-controller . Although the audit stated that the treasurer had obtained good yields on his investments , auditors stated it would be prudent for the county administrative officer and the Board of Supervisors to become more involved in the county ' s investment program . &quot; The investment function has a tremendous impact on the funding of the county ' s entire operation and added participation of the board , and the CAO should help ensure that the investment strategies and policies best serve the county , &quot; the audit stated . When the investment portfolio collapsed , the county of Orange had close to $ 3 billion in the $ 7.8-billion treasurer ' s pool -- the largest single contributor of the 187 governmental entities with money in the fund . Lewis ' auditors envisioned a panel that would assure a long-term consistent investment strategy by setting policy and analyzing investment returns . It was to consist_of the treasurer , assistant treasurer , auditor-controller , the county administrative officer , a member of the Board of Supervisors as well as a county department_head or a knowledgeable member of the public . In his official response dated Nov . 20 , 1987 , Citron argued against the audit ' s recommendation . He said the majority of investment funds came from districts and agencies unassociated with county government , hence county officials could not properly represent those interests on the committee . Citron maintained that the panel would be burdensome because investment decisions must be made on a daily basis in response to ever-changing markets and opportunities . &quot; Establishing a committee to perform the investment function not only removes the investing of public funds from those most capable to perform this important task , it would also make the county unable to react quickly to investment opportunities , which could materially affect interest earnings , &quot; Citron said . He concluded by saying that no other county in California , including Los Angeles County , which had a $ 4-billion treasury at the time , uses an oversight committee . Despite Citron ' s reluctance , county officials said , the auditor-controller tried to convene the panel along with a representative of the county administrative office , but the treasurer was not enthusiastic about these informal attempts to get something started . Little could be done after that , the source said , and the Board of Supervisors paid no attention to the audit and its recommendations . Supervisor Gaddi H . Vasquez said the board is now looking_at ways to make county department_heads more accountable in the wake of the financial debacle . Specifically , he said , supervisors will review whether department_heads should have the power , as they now do , to outright reject recommendations in county audits . In another audit of the treasurer ' s practices , this one for the year 1991 , the auditor-controller ' s office found similar problems with an existing internal review panel . It reported Citron might have broken the law with some of his investments and was dodging an internal investment committee consisting_of himself , then-assistant treasurer Ray Wells and Matthew Raabe , then-chief of treasury operations . Times staff writer Matt Lait contributed to this report .</TEXT>
