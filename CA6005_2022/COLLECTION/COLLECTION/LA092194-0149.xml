   <HEADLINE> EASTERN STORMS FORCE SHUTTLE TO LAND AT EDWARDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Diverted across the continent because of Florida thunderstorms , space shuttle Discovery touched_down safely at its alternative landing site here Tuesday afternoon beneath clear blue_skies . The landing ended an 11-day voyage highlighted by the first untethered space_walk by U.S. astronauts in a decade . NASA officials said that no significant technical problems marred the flight or the landing of the space vessel that carried five men and one woman . &quot; Discovery turned_in an almost flawless performance , &quot; said Loren Shriver , NASA launch integration manager during a post-mission briefing in Houston that was seen by closed-circuit_television at Edwards . The shuttle stayed aloft two days longer than planned because of stormy weather near the orbiter ' s primary landing site at Cape Canaveral . Shriver said NASA opted to keep the shuttle in space past its scheduled landing in hopes that the Florida weather would clear . The Edwards landing boosted the cost of this mission by about $ 1 million , NASA officials said , because of additional personnel expenses and the cost of ferrying the spacecraft back to its Florida launching site atop a modified Boeing 747 jet . A California landing also means the spacecraft won ' t get_back to its home base for at least five or six days . After two opportunities for a Florida landing went_by Tuesday morning , Shriver said , NASA officials decided it &quot; just wasn ' t in the cards this time , &quot; and they opted for California . By about 2 p.m. , about 1 # 000 NASA workers and 500 visitors were gathered on the ground and on rooftops at the base to listen for the descending shuttle ' s distinctive double sonic_booms ( which were clearly heard in the San Fernando Valley ) and to scan the skies for a glimpse of the craft . As Discovery touched_down at 2:14 p.m. , a recording of the &quot; Star Spangled Banner &quot; burst_out of loudspeakers at the NASA complex . The Discovery astronauts were whisked inside to undergo medical tests . They are scheduled to fly back to Houston early today . The untethered space_walk on Friday , 150 miles above Earth , was to test a new type of personal jet pack . The device , tested in turns by astronauts Mark Lee and Carl Meade , was designed to propel the wearer through space during an emergency . Crews working outside future space_stations might be equipped with them . Another scientific highlight of the mission was the firing of laser pulses toward Earth . NASA officials said data gathered from this test will lead to a better understanding of Earth ' s climate and help scientists learn how human_activity is affecting the atmosphere . During the mission , the astronauts also turned loose a $ 14-million satellite that studied the sun ' s corona for two days . Then the crew retrieved the satellite so that it could be returned to Earth . The mission was Discovery ' s 19th trip into space and NASA ' s 64th shuttle mission , including the tragic Challenger launch in 1986 .</TEXT>
