   <HEADLINE> NATO BLASTS REBEL SERB TARGETS NEAR SARAJEVO ; BOSNIA : AIR STRIKE COMES IN RETALIATION FOR DEFIANT WEAPONS RAID . ALLIED ATTACK DESTROYS A ' TANK-BUSTER ' GUN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> NATO warplanes attacked Bosnian Serb military_positions near Sarajevo on Friday after the rebels crowned a desperate round of provocations by seizing weapons from U.N. peacekeepers and forcing down a French helicopter with machine-gun fire . Sixteen North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization planes , including four U.S. A-10s , scrambled from alliance air_bases across Italy for a sundown sweep_over the Serbian-encircled Bosnian capital , blasting at preset targets and destroying at least one 76-millimeter &quot; tank-buster &quot; gun . The first use of Western air_power near Sarajevo spurred an immediate bleat of contrition from one rebel leader , who apologized for the pre-dawn raid on the weapons depot and promised to give_back the captured hardware , said Michael Williams from U.N. Protection Force headquarters in Zagreb , Croatia . But Williams , the senior spokesman for the beleaguered peacekeeping mission , voiced skepticism that the rebel military_leaders have been so quickly cowed . &quot; There remains a question in our minds that the reassurances this evening are from the Bosnian Serb political_leaders , and one would hope those reassurances would also apply to the military_leaders , &quot; Williams said , adding that the mission has learned &quot; all too often ( the Bosnian Serbs ) fall_back into a pattern of provocations and difficulties. &quot; Assurances that the stolen T-55 tank , two armored personnel_carriers and an antiaircraft_gun would be returned were offered by Momcilo Krajisnik , the self-styled parliamentary leader who often strikes a moderate pose while the Bosnian Serb military_presses on with offensives . There were reports that some of the equipment had been returned . But British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , the U.N. commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina , gave the Serbs until today to surrender all_the weapons taken from Ukrainian troops guarding a containment site in Serbian-held Ilidza . Rose warned that he is ready to renew his call_for air strikes if the Bosnian Serbs persist_in violating a weapons exclusion zone proclaimed around Sarajevo in February and backed by NATO threats to bomb heavy_weapons menacing the city . U.N. mission commanders moved swiftly to avoid the kind of retaliation inflicted by Bosnian Serbs after two token NATO air strikes in April against rebel artillery attacking the U.N. &quot; safe area &quot; of Gorazde . All air activities in and around Sarajevo were suspended , including a food airlift on hold since July 20 . U.N. troops in Bosnian Serbian-held areas were earlier redeployed out of the rebels ' reach . &quot; We learned some lessons from the April experience , &quot; Williams conceded , alluding to instances of hostage-taking and harassment of U.N. forces after the earlier air strikes . At NATO ' s Southern European Command in Naples , Italy , U.S. Adm . Leighton Smith said a desire to avoid civilian casualties was the determining factor_in selecting the air strike targets . U.N. and NATO military_leaders ordered the pilots to strike only if they could be certain of &quot; zero collateral damage , &quot; Smith said , using the military euphemism for civilian fatalities . Forward air controllers reported at least one sighting of ground-to-air retaliatory fire during the NATO attack , a senior Pentagon official in Washington said . But no damage or injuries were sustained , and all aircraft returned safely to their Italian bases , Smith said . The antitank weapon destroyed in the air strike was nine miles southwest of central Sarajevo , &quot; well within the 20-kilometer exclusion zone , &quot; Smith told reporters , referring to the 12.5-mile radius delineated around the Bosnian capital in February . The attack force consisted_of four French Mirage F-1 CTs , four British Jaguar fighters , four Dutch F-16s and the U.S. A-10s ; there was also a handful of support aircraft . Only two A-10 &quot; Warthogs &quot; actually fired at the Bosnian Serb positions , said Capt . Rich Eich , a spokesman at the Naples headquarters . No bombs were dropped , but the two aircraft fired about 600 rounds between them from their 30-millimeter guns , Eich said . At least the one M-18 antitank gun was destroyed , and NATO and U.N. forces were still assessing the results of the action , he said . The White_House and State_Department welcomed the NATO action , which was called_for by Rose , who has previously shown reluctance to use force against the Bosnian Serb belligerents for fear of exposing his peacekeeping troops to retaliation . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher called the NATO attack a way of keeping additional pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to accept an international peace plan for Bosnia . &quot; I think it was a good step_forward today , &quot; he said . Rose insisted that the attack in no way compromised the neutrality of his forces , saying the air strikes were &quot; a proportionate response. &quot; But by repeatedly stressing at a briefing in Sarajevo after the bombing that his mission is &quot; not going_to_war with the Serbs , &quot; Rose may have encouraged the rebel leadership to continue probing the limits of Western resolve to force an end to the worst bloodshed in Europe since World_War_II . At NATO headquarters in Brussels , the sense of relief was almost tangible that the U.N. mission had actually called_for alliance air strikes . Tension between the two organizations has been more or less constant since NATO issued its first ultimatum Feb . 9 that led to an end of 22 months of artillery bombardment of Sarajevo . The alliance , eager to preserve its credibility as a potent military_force , has often been frustrated by the United Nations ' reluctance to act . But in the more_than two years of fighting in Bosnia , the Bosnian Serbs have never been more isolated diplomatically . Abandoned -- at least for the moment -- by their only allies of any significance in Moscow and Belgrade , diplomatic pressure against air strikes was virtually zero . Forces loyal to Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic provoked the NATO attack with a series of aggressive moves against Sarajevo and U.N. forces over the past weeks punctuating their refusal to accept a U.S.- and European-mediated peace plan . The last straw appeared to be the barrage of small-arms fire that forced down a French Puma helicopter that was trying to track the four heavy-artillery pieces stolen from the U.N. containment site around 4 a.m. Rose appealed_to the U.N. Protection Force commander , French Gen . Bertrand de Lapresle , for air_power to punish the blatant violation of NATO ' s edict against heavy artillery being deployed within the exclusion zone . Most Bosnian Serb tanks , guns and howitzers had been withdrawn to avoid air strikes ahead of the February NATO deadline . But recent reluctance to punish violations with force had encouraged the rebels to gradually reposition dozens of guns and mortars around Sarajevo . U.N. peacekeeping officials had been treading lightly in the face of Bosnian Serb violations , probably in the expectation that they would accept a negotiated settlement of the conflict . Instead , Karadzic and the ultranationalists who dominate his rogue government rejected the take-it-or-leave-it peace plan and moved to close_in on Sarajevo by cutting_off its sole supply_route , grounding a humanitarian airlift and dramatically stepping_up sniper and mortar_fire against civilians . Bosnian Serb fighters had put the peacekeeping mission on notice earlier this week that they intended to retrieve weapons surrendered to the United Nations in February , claiming that they were needed for battles raging elsewhere in Bosnia . That prompted Rose to warn he would use any means available to him to prevent the weapons ' recapture , including air strikes . But the U.N. hierarchy ' s earlier reluctance to use force against the rebels , coupled with a timid response by the mediating countries at a meeting in Geneva last weekend , probably led the Bosnian Serbs to believe the latest threats were also empty . Diplomats from the United States , Russia , Britain , France and Germany have drafted a settlement proposal that aims to bring peace to Bosnia by dividing it , granting the Bosnian Serb rebels rule over 49 % and a Muslim-Croatian federation the rest . The Muslim-backed Sarajevo government reluctantly approved the plan , but the Serbs have repeatedly rejected it , demanding control over all conquered territory and the right to annex it to the neighboring state of Serbia . The Retaliation To protect Sarajevo , NATO imposed a weapons exclusion zone around the city on Feb . 21 . NATO had been reluctant to use air strikes . But the seizure of weapons by Bosnian Serbs threatened an increasingly shaky truce . THE PROVOCATION 1 ) An undetermined number of Bosnian Serbs raid U.N. weapons depot , seizing a tank , armored personnel_carriers and other weapons . 2 ) U.N. commanders send a French Puma helicopter to track the tank , but the helicopter is forced down by several rounds of small-arms fire . THE RESPONSE 3 ) U.S. A-10 jets blast apart a &quot; tank-buster &quot; gun in one of four NATO responses . The Pentagon would not reveal the three other targets . NATO Involvement The North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ' s air strikes against Bosnian Serb targets in Bosnia-Herzegovina on Friday marked the fourth time that the Western alliance has used force in the civil_war . Every attack has been_on Bosnian Serb targets . Following is a chronology of NATO ' s growing involvement in Bosnia : * July , 1992 : NATO agrees to use naval force in Adriatic to review compliance with U.N. sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro , which make_up the rump Yugoslavia . * October , 1992 : NATO agrees to use surveillance aircraft to monitor U.N. ban on military flights over Bosnia . * April , 1993 : NATO begins combat patrols with fighters over Bosnia to enforce compliance with U.N. ban on flights . * June , 1993 : NATO offers close air support to U.N. troops and other personnel in Bosnia if they are attacked and request air strikes . * August , 1993 : NATO threatens air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces attacking Sarajevo . * January , 1994 : NATO summit_meeting in Brussels confirms all previous decisions and says it is ready to use air strikes to help reopen Tuzla ' s airport for aid flights if necessary . * February , 1994 : NATO gives Bosnian Serbs 10 days to withdraw heavy_weapons from around Sarajevo or hand them over to U.N. control ; otherwise , they will face air strikes . The Serbs comply . * U.S. fighters , part of the NATO force , shoot_down four Bosnian Serb jets that violate the U.N. ban on flights over Bosnia . It is NATO ' s first combat action since it was founded in 1949 to counter Soviet military power in Europe . * April , 1994 : NATO launches two air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces around Gorazde to protect U.N. personnel , the first allied attacks on ground targets . * April 22 , 1994 : NATO says it will use air strikes to protect all six U.N.-designated &quot; safe areas &quot; in Bosnia and gives the Bosnian Serbs a deadline to withdraw from Gorazde . They comply and there are no strikes . * Aug . 5 , 1994 : NATO planes hit Bosnian Serb heavy_weapons that are violating the exclusion zone around Sarajevo after the rebel Serbs remove arms from a U.N. weapons depot .
