   <HEADLINE> SOUTH YEMEN LEADERS DECLARE SEPARATE STATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Southern Yemeni leaders said they were seceding from Yemen and declared a separate state today , four years after northern and southern Yemen united . The announcement was made in a statement read on Aden television and radio by Yemeni Vice_President Ali Salim Bidh , the country ' s southern leader . Bidh said the new separate state would be called the Democratic Republic of Yemen and that general_elections would be held a year from now . Hundreds of Aden ' s 350 # 000 residents went_out into the streets to celebrate , some of them firing Kalashnikov rifles into the air in jubilation . Bidh also appealed_to Arab and foreign governments to recognize the new state , which he said would adhere to Arab League and U.N. conventions . The southern decision was made more_than two weeks after a civil_war broke_out in the southern Arabian_peninsula because of differences between Bidh and President Ali Abdullah Saleh , a northerner , over the balance_of_power in the country they merged May 22 , 1990 . Bidh had ruled the People ' s Democratic Republic of Yemen in the south and Saleh the Yemen Arab Republic in the north until they created the Republic of Yemen , the united state of 13 million people , about 2.4 million of them in the south . Shortly before the southern decision was announced today , northern Yemen declared a unilateral cease-fire in the civil_war starting at midnight , and officials in Sana , the capital , repeated a demand for the surrender of Bidh and officials in his Yemen Socialist_Party . The southerners have largely been_on the defensive , but the northerners still face stiff resistance as they close_in on Aden , the old southern capital . Diplomats in Aden said the secession option had been under discussion in Aden since Monday in meetings of the Yemen Socialist_Party and five small opposition political_parties from north and south . They said southern envoys and officials had been discussing possible secession with several Arab states that they suspected might be willing to recognize a new South Yemen . Bidh said that the decision followed &quot; continuous efforts to make unity work &quot; and accused northerners of political sabotage , suppression , supporting Muslim fundamentalist movements and exporting terrorism . He said the new state would continue to aim for unity .</TEXT>
