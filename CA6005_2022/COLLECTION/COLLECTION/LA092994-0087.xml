   <TEXT> Rep . David A . Levy lost the Republican congressional primary by 54 votes to maverick candidate Dan Frisa in the country ' s first upset of a GOP incumbent this year . Soon after the official count was announced Wednesday , the first-term congressman asked the state Supreme Court to invalidate the election and order a new one , based on reports of voter irregularities . County Elections Commissioner Richard Blum said Frisa captured 12 # 487 votes to Levy ' s 12 # 433 . Unofficial results from the Sept . 13 primary had showed Levy trailing Frisa by 276 votes . Levy is the first Republican and fourth incumbent to lose in a primary this year . Frisa , a former Republican assemblyman , ran independent of the GOP machine . He had been denied the nomination in 1992 and lost to Levy in that year ' s primary .</TEXT>
