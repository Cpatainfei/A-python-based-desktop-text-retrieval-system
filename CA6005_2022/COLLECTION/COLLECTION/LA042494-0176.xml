   <HEADLINE> HANS BURKHARDT ; LEADING PROTEST ARTIST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hans Burkhardt , the much-honored Swiss-born artist whose protest paintings grew from the Dickensian squalor of his youth , died Friday . Burkhardt , whose subjects ranged from the divisiveness of the Spanish Civil War , the millions of dead in World_War_II and the horror of My Lai in Vietnam to the recent campaigns of Desert Storm , died at his home_in Los Angeles , said Jack Rutberg , his agent and biographer . He was 89 . Described by Times art critic William Wilson &quot; a classic American-immigrant success story , &quot; Burkhardt spent his boyhood hungry and cold in a Basel city orphanage . In 1924 , he wearied of the poverty and took his innate artistic talent to New York , where he came under the influence of abstract expressionist Arshile Gorky . Besides the opportunity to express himself as he wished , Burkhardt told The Times in 1992 -- just before being honored with a lifetime achievement award from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters -- he was amazed that &quot; in the U.S. , you have a decent meal every day. &quot; He studied and lived with Gorky and associated with Willem de Kooning . Gorky committed suicide in 1948 , a decade after Burkhardt had moved to Los Angeles , where he lost what little he had in a divorce settlement . &quot; Afterward , I hung the clerk of the Domestic Relations Court in a painting . It was my first protest painting. &quot; That set him on a path that was to make him a leader in socially conscious art . Conversely , however , his other works portrayed optimism and hope in a dichotomy that Burkhardt said reflected his own divisive feelings . His oils and pastels were featured in Art News and Artspace magazines . He had his work shown at prestigious exhibits in Mexico and was included in the 1955 U.S. presentation at the 3rd Biennial of Sao Paulo . But he also had such controversial works as &quot; Red Christ &quot; barred from jury consideration at the Los Angeles County Museum ; a protester used a cane to strike Burkhardt ' s &quot; War , Agony and Death , &quot; which was also slashed twice . Wilson noted that in the same year Burkhardt won the county museum ' s annual juried show prize for his painting &quot; One Way Out , &quot; the museum &quot; inexplicably refused to show &quot; the work . His protest art first came_to_light with such works as &quot; Concentration_Camp &quot; and &quot; The Death of Hitler. &quot; In 1945 , he joined a widespread film studio strike and from that painted &quot; Studio Scab -- Ronald Reagan. &quot; Shortly afterward he moved to Mexico for several years , and later said although &quot; I love this country , &quot; ( the United States ) Mexico is &quot; where life and death live close_together and people aren ' t afraid of it. &quot; Returning to this country in the late 1950s , Burkhardt taught at Cal State Long_Beach , UCLA , USC and the Otis and Chouinard institutes and others . He painted tributes to such fallen leaders as John and Robert Kennedy , Martin_Luther_King Jr . and the students at Kent State University who died protesting the Vietnam_War . A retrospective of his work is_on exhibit at the Jack Rutberg gallery on North La Brea Avenue . Burkhardt is survived by a daughter .</TEXT>
