   <TEXT> * &quot; Fraud by County Quake Aid Workers Probed &quot; ( Feb . 5 ) gives the impression that welfare_workers are conspiring to pocket food_stamps and other emergency funds meant for earthquake victims . As general_manager of the union representing more_than 40 # 000 county workers , I feel obligated to set the record straight . The largest relief effort ever administered within the United States would n ' t have stood a chance of success if not for the dedication of more_than 5 # 000 employees of the Department of Public Social_Services . More_than 1 # 600 DPSS workers have processed about 175 # 000 &quot; emergency &quot; applications for food_stamps by working 12-hour shifts , outdoors , on weekends , through darkness , aftershocks and rain . Meanwhile , thousands of other eligibility workers continue to serve the &quot; normal &quot; victims of the recession , coping_with their own caseloads and picking_up the slack for absent volunteers . Within days of the anonymous fraud charges , half of the 40 accused workers were cleared of any wrongdoing . Most likely , the others will also be cleared . But even if all 20 were eventually found guilty , they would represent fewer than half a percent of all DPSS employees . That is squeaky clean compared to bankers , lawyers , stockbrokers and others accused of white-collar crime . Hundreds of DPSS employees were also victims of the Jan . 17 quake . Many are single parents subsisting just above the poverty_line . They deserve emergency assistance as much as any other county resident , yet management has blocked their claims . As a result , many dubious &quot; victims &quot; were given immediate relief , while families of the people who distribute the food_stamps are going hungry . GILBERT CEDILLO , General_Manager Local 660 , Service Employees International Union , Los Angeles * Regarding your article of Feb . 7 on the abuse of the food_stamp program : I found it interesting that the state of Maryland is using a &quot; food debit card , &quot; called the Independence card . Shouldn ' t it rather be titled the &quot; Dependence &quot; card ? Since when does living_on welfare and receiving food_stamps from the government give anyone independence ? I also found it interesting that &quot; in response to public outcry &quot; action is now being taken_to catch the food_stamp abusers and assure the public that their tax dollars will no longer be wasted on food_stamps . Shouldn ' t the article have read , &quot; and government officials responsible_for this mess are now covering their rear_ends &quot; ? Further , if it hadn ' t been for the big , bad earthquake , none of these &quot; officials &quot; would be in the hot_seat in the first place .
