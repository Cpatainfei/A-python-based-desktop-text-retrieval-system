   <HEADLINE> BOOST FROM GIULIANI LIFTS CUOMO BACK INTO TIGHT CONTEST ; POLITICS : POLLS SHOW NEW YORK GOVERNOR AND GOP CHALLENGER ARE NOW IN A DEAD_HEAT . NUMBER OF UNDECIDED VOTERS HAS GROWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three days after Mayor Rudolph W . Giuliani broke party ranks to endorse Gov . Mario M . Cuomo for reelection , the race in New York state has narrowed dramatically . Two polls show a statistical dead_heat between Cuomo and his Republican challenger , state Sen . George Pataki . Significantly , the number of undecided voters in both surveys has grown . Giuliani ' s endorsement , plus the growing strength of B . Thomas Golisano , a Rochester , N.Y. , businessman who is seeking the governorship as an Independence Fusion Party candidate , appear to have caught Pataki -- the front-runner for months -- in a political pincers . Golisano , 52 , the chairman of a national payroll company , has pledged to spend up_to $ 10 million of_his_own money on his campaign . The polls show Golisano , who supported independent presidential candidate Ross Perot in 1992 , siphoning votes from Pataki . &quot; With Giuliani chipping_away_at Pataki downstate and Golisano chipping_away upstate , the whole election becomes less well-defined and more uncertain than it was , &quot; said Lee M . Miringoff , director of the Marist College Public_Opinion_Poll , which now shows Pataki ahead of Cuomo by 1 percentage_point , 37 % to 36 % , with Golisano at 8 % and 17 % undecided . A month ago , the group found Pataki leading Cuomo , 44 % to 38 % . A New York Post / Fox 5 poll showed Pataki leading Cuomo 39.5 % to 35.4 % , with Golisano at 6.5 % and the rest undecided . The margin of error in both polls put the race effectively even . &quot; You have an unpopular incumbent and an unknown challenger , &quot; Miringoff said . &quot; Neither has closed the sale. &quot; Giuliani ' s backing of Cuomo gave the 62-year-old governor ' s reelection effort a psychological lift . But it is unclear how that will translate into votes , especially because the mayor subsequently has announced $ 800 million in new spending_cuts , further reducing services , in_order to balance New York City ' s budget . Cuomo needs a strong turnout in New York City to offset pervasive weakness upstate . Polls show only that a third of voters statewide approve of his performance in office . &quot; On Election_Day , they ( Cuomo ' s advisers ) will pray for rain north of the_Bronx , &quot; said a political consultant who has run campaigns for both Democrats and Republicans . &quot; It ' s a wild contest all_over the place. &quot; Wild may be an understatement . With plots and dark promises of revenge , the race could be scripted from the pages of a Gothic novel . Sen . Alfonse M . D ' Amato ( R-N.Y. ) , who recruited Pataki , and other Republicans have threatened to field a candidate against Giuliani if the mayor runs again . Sen . Daniel Patrick Moynihan ( D-N.Y. ) , who polls show to be in an easy race for reelection against Republican Bernadette Castro , so far has refused to endorse Cuomo . Moynihan is mad because the governor met during the Democratic State Convention with the Rev . Al Sharpton , a preacher and political activist who was then opposing Moynihan for the Democratic nomination . Moynihan crushed Sharpton in the Democratic primary in September . Adding_to the intrigue , real_estate developer Abraham Hirschfeld is seeking retribution against Cuomo , who blocked Hirschfeld when he tried to run_for lieutenant_governor four years ago . Cuomo also opposed his bid to buy the New York Post . Hirschfeld is underwriting an ad_campaign portraying a hellish version of New York -- including a body_bag , a chalk drawing of a corpse , rubble-strewn lots and &quot; going_out of business &quot; signs . &quot; This is Mario Cuomo ' s New York , &quot; Hirschfeld ' s ads charge . In an effort to portray Pataki as D ' Amato ' s pawn , some Cuomo commercials show a newspaper photograph of the senator leading Pataki by the hand , with the tag_line : &quot; George Pataki ? Maybe we should just call him Al. &quot; Other Cuomo ads take the theme further , alleging that D ' Amato has &quot; treated government like his private preserve , dolling out contracts and favors to his cronies , fending off ethics charges and criminal probes. &quot; &quot; Now , D ' Amato has tapped his pal George Pataki to be our governor . . . . Imagine what they ' d do to us in Albany , &quot; these commercials conclude . Seeking to capitalize on Cuomo ' s longstanding opposition to the death_penalty , a Pataki commercial features a weeping mother whose son was murdered . &quot; I blame it on Cuomo and his liberal policies , &quot; she says . &quot; Cuomo does not care about the victims of crime . He cares about the criminal. &quot; Another Pataki advertisement , resembling a video_game , shows a seemingly endless list of taxes and fees that the Republican candidate charges Cuomo supported during his 12 years in office . The list almost spills off the screen . &quot; Mario Cuomo . . . Too liberal for too long , &quot; is the tag_line . The differences between the two campaigns are stark . Recently , dueling fund-raising dinners were held within a block of each other in Manhattan . New Jersey Gov . Christine Todd Whitman -- who has become a star this fall helping fill Republican coffers after winning office with a platform stressing a 30 % tax cut over three years -- appeared with Pataki . &quot; This race , you see , is not about who can give the best speeches or collect the most endorsements from the political Establishment , &quot; she told party faithful as they dined on veal . &quot; Democrats cannot resist spending other people ' s money . They ' re determined to try the taxpayer ' s patience . We know that the only way to control spending is to give government less to spend in the first place. &quot; &quot; We have largely missed out on the national recovery , &quot; said Pataki , a 49-year-old former mayor of Peekskill , N.Y. Just a block away , in another ballroom with President Clinton present , Democrats dined on chicken . &quot; The magnificent heritage and achievement of progressive change is being threatened , &quot; Cuomo said . &quot; There are forces that are threatening to drag us down into a ditch of diminished expectations . . . . What they would settle for is a puny , shriveled place , an America of naysayers and negativists. &quot; &quot; It is wrong for us to deny that heritage , &quot; the governor added . &quot; that ' s why I ' m running. &quot;</TEXT>
