   <HEADLINE> RICHARD EDER : THE LAW OF THE LAND ; WHITE_MAN ' S GRAVE , BY RICHARD DOOLING ( FARRAR , STRAUS &amp; GIROUX : $ 22 ; 386 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Richard Dooling is a traveler in two drastically different territories : the law he practices today in Nebraska , and the folkways of the Mende people in the backlands of Sierra_Leone , where he once stayed . In his sardonic and decidedly untidy novel , &quot; White_Man ' s Grave , &quot; he pits the tribal magic of each against the other . There is no question who wins . Dooling has something of the beady , comical glitter of Evelyn Waugh -- though not his formal perfection -- but only in one eye . Waugh traveled in Sierra_Leone and wrote nastily about both whites and blacks . Dooling ' s parody wickedly impales his Americans ; his ingenious sympathies lie_with the Mende villagers , giving his book an aspect beyond parody . The story goes roughly like this : Randall Killigan , a maniacally hard-charging lawyer in Indianapolis , has a straying son , Michael , who went_to Africa with the Peace Corps for two years , stayed for four and has disappeared . While Randall fulminates , mobilizes his senator and the State_Department and offers large rewards , a second effort goes_on . Boone , an artist friend of Michael ' s and a fugitive from an equivalent bull-elephant of a father , treks into the Sierra_Leone bush . Eventually Michael turns_up along with an explanation for his disappearance . Most of the African part of the story , which is most of the book , concerns Boone ' s painful and illuminating encounters with a primitive village civilization . Painful for him , illuminating for us . The young_man ' s artistic veneer quickly burns_off , disclosing a hereditary , stiff-necked American prig . The priggishness , though , allows the author to show us what Boone refuses to see : how supremely and winningly , in the notion of primitive civilization , the noun demolishes the adjective . Dooling gives us a bravura display of satire with Randall Killigan , in war_paint and tribal regalia , as a legal chieftain whose ambition is to be &quot; the synonym for bankruptcy in the Seventh Circuit. &quot; He demolishes the lawyers for bankrupt firms . He lays the reeking carcasses of his victims upon his conference-room table , apportioning bits to the rival creditors ' lawyers . He is the most virile tiger in the jungle : the electronic notebook he carries into negotiating battle has twice as_many bytes as anyone else ' s . It contains for instant reference the entire Federal Bankruptcy Code , annotated . The imagery , of course , is purposeful as well as comic . As the search for his son goes_on , with Boone encountering witches , shape-changers , juju medicine , the dumbstruck regard of young villagers and the cryptic though essentially benevolent maneuvering of the elders , Africa leaks into Indianapolis . Randall mysteriously receives a hideous , skin-wrapped package that drips blood ; now and then it turns_into a bat . For a while he wonders if he has a brain_tumor ; gradually he realizes that it is witchcraft . It will turn_out to be self-inflicted : he , we will learn by the end , is possessed by a witch-spirit and has , in_effect , become one . As one character points_out , the American counterpart of voodoo is lawsuits : Both are used to kill , sicken or otherwise ruin ones neighbors . The Mende hire witches , we hire lawyers . Dooling brings_off his satiric parallel , which might otherwise seem forced , with a wit and outrageousness that make_it work . His success has large holes in it , though . He can satirize his countrymen but he is plain awful when he attempts anything more inward with them . When Randall goes_to Mass and Confession to try to stave_off the witchery , his mental flailing is written in flamboyant cliche and interlarded with more cliche : lengthy quotations from the liturgy . Satire has sunk out of its depth to become the mawkish thing it satirizes . In the African chapters , the author ' s sympathy and responsiveness produce writing whose humor is carried_on a current of discovery and astonishment . Only the Americans are flat . Michael , when discovered , is simply an American over-achiever gone native . Boone ' s cultural obtuseness has a narrative usefulness -- it allows the delicate complexities of the villagers to emerge more clearly -- but it turns him into a null character . An anthropologist who has lived with the Mende for years and has , in_effect , become one of them , is considerably less interesting than what he has to say . He is a good explainer but not much else . Oddly , the only American with any roundness or allure is a thoroughly reprehensible Peace Corps veteran , infinitely cynical about the villagers and mainly in it for the adventure and the beer . He is alive , though , and authentic . And it is in evoking the life of Africa and in suggesting the wisdom and forbearance that underlay the &quot; superstitions &quot; of the Mende villagers that Dooling is at his best . There is , first of all , a vivid presentation not just of what his Africa looks , feels and smells like , but of the emotions of unease and beguilement they can produce . The vast landscape seen from the descending airplane looks_like &quot; an empire of solid broccoli tops stretching inland to the horizon. &quot; Boone rides a rickety truck into the interior ; people , animals and cargo are so jammed together that the passengers practice a kind of metabolism-lowering trance state . The villagers live_in a fearful world of uncontrollable events : hunger , disease , the depredations of white settlers and diamond seekers , and the arbitrary incursions of warring political factions whose maneuvering in the capital is felt 200 miles down-country . Dooling portrays the rich culture that can evolve from powerlessness to command ones environment ; as opposed to Western culture , which has evolved from just the opposite . From command , that is , or a sense of command or -- look_at our cities -- an illusion of command . The suggestion is there without being explicit . It is fleshed_out in countless scenes in which Dooling gives life to a village that manages dignity and a subversive humor in the teeth of what seem to us like invincible odds . The witchcraft , the magical secret_societies , the shamanism , the taboos are ways of coping_with unmanageable dangers both outside and within . In his portraits -- a visiting witch-cleaner who runs a cotton thread around the village so nobody shall leave or enter until the place is cleaned ; the poignantly striving third wife of a local political thug ; and above all , the elder who adopts Boone as his son so that the villagers can see him as a real person , albeit an odd and misbehaving one -- Dooling evokes the humane checks and balances of a deep world ; the logic , you might say , of its magic .</TEXT>
