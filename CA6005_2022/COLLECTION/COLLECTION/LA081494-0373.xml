   <HEADLINE> SCILLY SEASON ; NOTHING MUCH HAPPENS ON THE ISLES OF SCILLY . BUT that ' s EXACTLY THE POINT OF VISITING A SPOT REMINISCENT OF RURAL ENGLAND GENERATIONS AGO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For a yuppie couple from Britain ' s Midlands , a high point of their week ' s stay_on the Isles of Scilly , 30 miles off the southwest tip of England , was the whistling concert they heard one night from the parking_lot below their hotel window when the Mermaid , the islands ' most popular pub , closed . &quot; It was really rather interesting , &quot; the woman related in the breakfast room the next morning . &quot; It wasn ' t just little tunes they whistled , it was whole songs , all_the way through . They started with &quot; Rule Britannia &quot; of course , and then somebody whistled something else . Then people would call_for more and someone else would whistle something . I don ' t know how they have the muscles to whistle for so_long , but it beats fighting -- and it sent me right off to sleep , I ' ll tell you. &quot; For a boy on a rented bicycle , it was pumping his way to the top of the road to the 16th-Century Garrison overlooking Hugh Town on St . Mary ' s Island . &quot; My whole family is down there , cheering me on , &quot; he volunteered proudly to a passerby , as he gulped for air . For Petra , a dental nurse in her 20s , the Scillies provided a place to let the stress of a frantically paced London melt away . &quot; In London , people measure time by the second , &quot; she said . &quot; Here they hardly measure it at all . I ' m sure the people who live here can see the tension in Londoners ' eyes when they first arrive -- before they ' ve realized they can relax. &quot; The Scillies -- a compact cluster of dozens of islands , only five of them inhabited , and each of those small enough to be walked easily from one end to the other -- look_like a chunk of rural England of a couple generations ago , maybe lifted from coastal Cornwall or Devon and flung out into the Atlantic . Burial artifacts give evidence of prehistoric settlement 1 # 000 or more years BC , and skimpily recorded history puts Christian monks on the Scillies in the 5th or 6th Centuries AD , when , according to maps they left_behind , the islands were a single land mass , not yet eroded by the ocean into their present fragments . Arthurian legend places the idyllic land of Lyonnesse on portions of a Greater Scilly now submerged beneath the sea . What still remains above water ( the highest point is just 160 feet above sea_level and geologists give the islands only another 49 # 500 years before they vanish ) constitutes , today , the Isles of Scilly , with patchwork fields covering the leeward_sides and moors of tougher vegetation braving those exposed to the ocean winds . Between them are shoals , and waters shallow enough that at some seasons one can walk between the islands at low_tide . Standing on a hill on one of the islands one afternoon , a Scillies resident looked_at a neighboring island , across two miles of ocean whipped by a breeze into frothy whitecaps . &quot; I walked over to that island once at low_tide , &quot; he reminisced . &quot; It was hardly more_than thigh deep . But bear_in_mind , it was March then. &quot; To understand the Scillies -- and to avoid disappointment if you ' re put_together differently than the people who flock there yearly -- it ' s important to know what they are not . They ' re not hot , although the people who live there think they are . &quot; Yesterday was a scorcher , &quot; one told me by way of warning the August morning I arrived . It had gotten_up to 69 , she said with a grimace . Since it ' s not hot , there ' s no ocean swimming or sunbathing to speak_of . Most of the few people in the water on an August day are hardy children wading , or adults , with nets , shrimping . A woman who complained that she had fallen_asleep on the beach and &quot; got sunburned &quot; acknowledged , under questioning , that what had gotten burned was her left ankle -- the only part of her otherwise fully dressed body left uncovered against the chill breeze . Except for a_couple_of pubs and some hotel bars , there ' s virtually no night life . One evening a community theater presented J.B. Priestley ' s &quot; An Inspector Calls , &quot; and other nights there were slide lectures on local birds , flowers and shipwrecks . On a Sunday night , I walked the six-block length of the main_street of Hugh Town , the Scillies ' only commercial center , without seeing or hearing a moving vehicle . And it ' s definitely not a jet-set destination . Access to the Scillies from London is by train or car to Penzance , the closest city on the_English mainland , and then a 20-minute helicopter ride or three-hour ferry trip . The biggest of the islands ' 10 hotels has only 40 rooms , and most are much smaller . When former Prime_Minister Harold Wilson , who has a modest house on St . Mary ' s , and Prince Charles , who , with his family , stays_on privately owned Tresco Island , come_to the Scillies , it ' s to escape clamor , not to cause it . What does a visitor do then on the Scillies ? Well , the chief pastime , it seems , is simply moving about and coming_to a stop when necessary , to rest , eat lunch or refuel at a pub and , later , to indulge in calorie-laden pastries with clotted cream at a tea_garden . This moving about can be walking or biking the miles of paths -- up and down hills covered with gorse and heather , through fields of flowers , along rocky coasts and sandy beaches . Or it could be taking a 15-minute boat ride to one of the other islands and then walking or biking it , exploring its coves and fields and examining its ruins . And on Friday nights there ' s the big social_event of the week : gathering on the quay or in boats to watch Scillies ' boatmen race six-oared gigs , some of them more_than a century old , between the islands . This low-key formula packs them in on the Scillies , it turns_out . Most of the hotels and guest houses are booked_up well before summer ( many people reserve for the following year at_the_same_time they check_out ) and the islands , which have a resident population of only 2 # 000 , are at their carefully controlled tourist capacity for much of the spring and summer . &quot; What brings you all_the way_out here ? &quot; Tony , the headwaiter at Tregarthen ' s Hotel , asked me at breakfast my first morning . &quot; You ' re an American , aren ' t you ? &quot; Unmasked at the start . So_much for trying to blend_in . &quot; Do many Americans come here ? &quot; I asked . I hadn ' t seen any , nor , it turned_out , did I in the remainder of my stay . &quot; Not many , &quot; he said , &quot; but a_few have recently . One of your big newspapers did an article on us and that might have started it. &quot; Was it a good article ? &quot; Oh , mostly , there was nothing really wrong -- but they do have to be a bit artistic , don ' t they ? &quot; I wasn ' t artistic enough to come_up with a good reason for being there , other_than that I ' d wanted someplace pleasant that I ' d never visited , to relax for a_few days and look_at English birds . The Scillies are famed in British birding circles as a place to see rarities , but the time for seeing them is October and the rarities are usually North_American birds that have been blown_off course and wind_up in the Scillies as their first landfall . In October , the placid pace of life in the Scillies is ruptured by the presence of 200 or more &quot; twitchers , &quot; as the_British call birders who maniacally chase rarities , darting from island to island . When I wrote birding friends in England to ask recommendations for staying in the Scillies in August , I received anguished pleas that I change my plans . I ' d see nothing then but English birds , they warned . There ' s nothing happening in the Scillies in August , it would be dead quiet , they implored . It sounded ideal . Resigned to my going in the wrong season , the friends gave me some helpful advice : Allow time in my travel connections for possible delays due_to fog or wind ; stay_at Tregarthen ' s Hotel ( and make contact with Will Wagstaff , a top-notch birder and botanist who is field_officer for the Isles of Scilly Environmental Trust , which administers the public lands of the islands and promotes conservation . I treated myself to the overnight sleeper from London ' s Paddington Station to Penzance , although there also are several daytime trains that make the trip in about five hours . In Penzance , hungry from my trip , I spotted the Baker Boy ' s Oven Door and promptly was overwhelmed by my first brush with Cornish pastry . There , in two big show_windows , were 52 ( I counted them ) different kinds of pastries , with such baffling names as &quot; tiger baps , &quot; &quot; granary bloomers , &quot; &quot; white twinnies &quot; and &quot; long white unders. &quot; I grabbed a meat-stuffed &quot; Cornish_pasty &quot; ( pronounced PASS-tee ) , took a shuttle_bus to the heliport a mile away and boarded the 32-passenger Sikorsky S61 helicopter that makes the quick flight to the Scillies several times a day , weather permitting , for a fare of $ 60 . From an altitude of 1 # 000 feet , I had stunning views of Cornwall ' s jigsaw-patterned fields , then the promontory of Land ' s End , and , after a brief expanse of ocean in which I was close enough to see gannets and shearwaters crisscrossing at water_level , I was over the rocky southeast coast of St . Mary ' s , the largest of the Scillies , and dropping softly onto the grassy landing_field . Minutes later , I was at Tregarthen ' s , surveying the quiet garden where , a discreet plaque said , Alfred Lord Tennyson , a regular guest in the hotel ' s early days , spent long hours writing &quot; Enoch Arden. &quot; The view -- the long stone quay and the harbor , crowded with dinghies and small sailboats -- probably hadn ' t changed much in the intervening century , but since I had only five days , I didn ' t let it inspire me to write an epic_poem and instead headed out_to tramp the island . I walked through Hugh Town , situated at a point where the island is squeezed together like an hourglass , with beaches facing the sea on either side , just three blocks apart . Sooner than I expected , I was out of town , past a pottery shop and a stately house named Nowhere and onto the Lower Moor . Everywhere I looked , I could see people in motion -- walking or biking , singly or in family groups , silently plodding with canes and butterfly nets , or chatting -- or , in the case of many of the children , polishing their debating skills . &quot; Pick it up , Tobin , pick it up like a nice little_girl , &quot; I heard a mother implore from somewhere on the other side of a hedgerow . &quot; I shan ' t , &quot; came the small-voiced but firm answer . &quot; Colin , &quot; I heard from a father-voice behind me , &quot; you mustn ' t keep doing that . You really mustn ' t keep sitting down. &quot; &quot; And you really mustn ' t keep kicking me , &quot; in measured response . I turned onto a rocky nature trail and met an elderly woman leaning_on a walking stick . &quot; Bit rough going here , isn ' t it , &quot; she observed . &quot; Yes , but at least there ' s a nice cool breeze , &quot; I said , having just rolled_down my shirt-sleeves . &quot; Not here , &quot; she said , looking_at me as though uncertain whether I ' d tried to make a joke . &quot; It ' s really rather hot. &quot; By nightfall , I was back in my room , resting my aching feet and savoring the memory of the first of five sumptuous four-course meals I was to enjoy at the hotel , as well as an entertaining slide lecture by Wagstaff on the natural attractions of the Scillies . Then I began boning_up on the &quot; off-islands &quot; ( the catch-all term for those that aren ' t St . Mary ' s ) in preparation for the one daily ritual that produces crowds on the Scillies : the morning gathering on the quay to board the boats that transport visitors to Tresco , St . Martin ' s , St . Agnes , Bryher or Samson . Tresco is the jewel of the Scillies . It contains , on its 1-by-2-mile expanse of wooded hills and rolling moors , the islands ' most interesting ruins -- a 12th-Century Benedictine abbey and castles and fortifications from the 16th and 17th Centuries -- and the Abbey Gardens , which contain native plants and flowers as well as hundreds of subtropical varieties gathered over the past two centuries from around the world . Tresco is the only island in private hands , the descendants of Augustus Smith , who was given a lease to the island by the Duchy of Cornwall in 1834 . As I walked a roadway on Tresco , a resident pointed_out an aristocratic-looking gentleman driving by in a three-wheeled cart , the only kind of motor_vehicle allowed on Tresco . It was Robert Dorrien Smith , the island ' s current lease-holder and resident of Tresco Abbey , not really an abbey but an imposing manor_house built_in 1843 near the original abbey ' s ruins . To get_to Tresco , I joined the crowd on the quay at St . Mary ' s about 9 a.m. and scanned a blackboard that lists the boats and their destinations for the day . I joined 85 people and two dogs , squeezed onto every bit of horizontal space on a broad , open motorized boat called the Britannia . The docking sites on all_the islands vary according to tides and , after a placid 15-minute voyage across a couple miles of flat sea , we landed at Cairn Near , on the southern tip of Tresco , the dock used at low_tide . With Wagstaff pointing_out plants and birds and guiding us through a meandering network of trails , our group of a dozen walked the island . We studied the birds at two wooded ponds and found , in addition to the expected swans , herons and ducks , two very unexpected visitors from far away that would have excited even those British birding friends who shun the islands until October . They were a citrine wagtail , a pipit-like bird of Siberia and a semipalmated sandpiper , a shorebird common in the United States but rarely seen in Europe . We climbed a hill to see the gutted exterior of the Blockhouse , a stone fortification built_in the 1500s and destroyed in the civil_war in 1651 by supporters of Oliver Cromwell . To the north were the ruins of Cromwell ' s Castle , built_in 1651 , and King Charles ' Castle , a century older . Lunch at Tresco ' s only pub was Cornish_pasties and ploughman ' s platters ( salad of lettuce , cucumbers , beets and onions ; two huge wedges of white Cheddar_cheese , size depending_on the cook ' s generosity ; two generous slabs of coarse , fresh bread ; dollops of mayonnaise and sour_cream and a mound of pickle_relish in a piquant brown_sauce ) . For some of us , it was all washed_down by a pint of aleand , for a hardy few , dessert followed . &quot; You should have been there one day last year , &quot; a woman at the next table said to me at supper back in the hotel that night when she heard me say I ' d spent a quiet day on Tresco . &quot; Police everywhere . They were dropping_in by helicopter . A man had dug_up some human bones and they thought somebody had been murdered . What a commotion . Then I heard on the telly later that it turned_out the bones were more_than a_thousand years old . But I suppose it still could have been a murder. &quot; Friday night -- gig race night -- I sat with a group in Tregarthen ' s lounge , peering through the big picture_window that usually provides a panoramic view of the harbor and the quay , the finish_line for the St . Martin ' s-to-St . Mary ' s race that was supposed to be underway . But what we were looking_at was an impenetrable fog that had rolled in while we ate , swallowing_up the harbor , the spectator boats lined_up at the finish_line , the quay where hundreds more had gathered to watch , and most of the 200 yards of hillside between us and whatever action there was down below . This prompted a round of storms- from- hell- that- really- screwed- things- up- for- visitors- to- the- Scillies stories from the regulars , amusing to them but enough to raise the consternation level of at least this visitor , with a nonrefundable ticket back to the States a_few days hence . There was the 1967 storm that broke_up the Torrey Canyon on a reef just eight miles off the Scillies and loosed what was then a record oil spill . Although most of the oil washed eastward , away from the islands , some Scillies hotels still have mats in front of their doors that , instead of wishing &quot; Welcome &quot; inquire politely , &quot; Tar ? &quot; And there was the 1979 &quot; Fastnet disaster , &quot; when a sudden storm exploded on a world-class yacht_race as it passed the Scillies and , for days after , de-masted yachts were being dragged into the harbor , one of them having lost its entire seven-man crew . Then the stories got closer to home : A storm five years ago , when two days of 80 m.p.h. gales halted all departures from the islands , and the &quot; big blow &quot; of 1990 , when the Scillonian III , the 1 # 000-ton , 600-passenger ferry that is the island ' s commercial lifeline to the mainland , had to anchor off Land ' s End for three days riding_out the storm , with a full_complement of seasick holiday-goers aboard . By now , mercifully , it was obvious something was happening out there in the fog . Some blinking lights were visible , and people were coming_into view , returning from the quay . The gig race was over . Andreja , an effervescent Dubliner who is a musician with that city ' s National Symphony_Orchestra , had joined one of the spectator boats that accompany the gigs in the race , each boatload selecting a favorite to root for . Her gig , the 160-year-old Bonnet , rowed in the winner , &quot; and we were pretty noisy , screaming away out there in the fog , &quot; she said later . When I arranged my visit to the Scillies months before , I ' d wondered if five days wasn ' t too long to be spending on a little set of islands well_out of the mainstream of activity . Now , as I packed my bags in the early morning darkness and prepared to leave , I thought_of a dozen things I hadn ' t had time to do -- or things I wanted to do again . I ' d spent a day on St . Martin ' s , where tons of daffodils are grown for export in the mild winter months and fulmars and kittiwakes nest in cliffs topped by the Daymark , a red-and-white , torpedo-shaped tower that has stood there majestically since 1687 as a daytime navigation marker . But I hadn ' t made_it to St . Agnes , or Bryher or Samson . I ' d gone_back to Tresco to visit the Abbey Gardens . And with Andreja and Petra , I ' d taken a final hike through the moors and across the promontories of St . Mary ' s , and by now Petra , who also was leaving the next day , was unconsciously shifting back into a London mode , measuring time by the second again and urging us on , as if to meet a schedule . Tony , the hotel ' s headwaiter , had opened the dining_room early to be sure I got a decent breakfast before leaving , and he saw me and my luggage to the stop for the heliport shuttle_bus a block away . &quot; Yes , people either like it or they don ' t , &quot; he ' d observed philosophically to my declaration of full satisfaction with the Scillies . In a sparkling sky , the helicopter brought us back across the pale blue sea to Land ' s End and the fields of Cornwall and then Penzance . As it landed , I watched the waiting ground_crew inexplicably putting_on rain parkas and then as we stepped_out onto the mainland once more , a suddenly dark sky erupted with a lashing downpour . As we dashed toward the terminal , the sun broke_through and a beauteous rainbow formed , dropping_down to the west . If I were a romantic , I would have said that the end of it seemed to drop into the sea right in the midst of the isles I ' d just left . GUIDEBOOK : The Scillies : Beyond Land ' s End Getting there : From London ' s Paddington Station , 10 express_trains a day make the five-hour trip to Penzance ( about $ 60 one way ) ; an overnight sleeper ( about $ 120 one way ) leaves at midnight and arrives_at 8 a.m. From Penzance by sea , the Scillonian III ( telephone 011-44-736-62009 ) makes one trip each way on weekdays , two on Saturday ( none Sundays ) ; one-way fare for the three-hour trip is about $ 45 . British International Helicopters ' 32-passenger aircraft make seven 20-minute flights on weekdays during summer , additional flights on Saturday ( none Sundays ) ; one-way fare is about $ 60 , and there is a special $ 90 round-trip fare for travel during specified times ( tel . 011-44-736-63871 ) . Reservations are essential in summer , and flights occasionally are delayed or canceled because of bad_weather . ( For the return trip , I made my train reservation for a_few hours after the helicopter flight to allow_for possible weather delay. ) When to go : June through August is the best season for weather , and also the busiest . Spring and fall are said to be pleasant , but chillier , and storms are more likely . Where to stay : There are 10 hotels in the Scillies . Most rates include mandatory half-board -- full English breakfast plus dinner-although some accept guests for bed and breakfast at lower rates . Three hotels highly recommended by recent visitors are Star Castle ( tel . 011-44-720-22317 , fax 011-44-720-22343 ) atop Garrison Hill overlooking Hugh Town on St . Mary ' s ( with tennis_courts and heated swimming_pool ) ; Tregarthen ' s ( tel . 011-44-720-22540 , fax 011-44-720-42089 ) , halfway up the same hill and close to the harbor , with splendid views from public rooms , and Atlantic ( tel . 011-44-720-22417 , fax 011-44-720-423009 ) on the waterfront in Hugh Town . Half-board rates at all are about $ 75 to $ 105 per person . There are about 70 smaller guest houses , offering varying meal arrangements . &quot; Self-catering &quot; accommodations -- apartments or rooms rented by the week , with no meals -- are booked_up the earliest . The Scilly Tourist Information Center , listed below , publishes monthly computer printouts , beginning in the winter , showing what dates rooms are available at each of the islands ' tourist accommodations . Where to eat : The hotels ' dining_rooms all seem to serve good food , and Tregarthen ' s , one of several open_to non-guests , provided far more in its tasty four-course meals than I could do_justice to . There are a number of restaurants that passed my sniff test and , on menus posted outside , had tempting daily specials , most of them based on local fish and produce . Some examples I jotted_down : shark steak and Stilton ; leek and Stilton soup ; baked gray_mullet with mussels ; grilled brill with lime butter ; cockles and ( yes ) mussels ; fresh John_Dory with parsnips ; grilled plaice . There are also tea_gardens that serve sinful pastries , with homemade jams and clotted cream . One of the best restaurants for scenery and sweets is Juliet ' s Garden , a short walk_out_of Hugh Town . For more information : The British Tourist Authority , 551 Fifth Ave. , New York , N.Y. 10176 ; tel . ( 800 ) GO2-BRIT ( 462-2748 ) , can provide basic information about the Scillies . Then contact the Tourist Information Center , St . Mary ' s , Isles of Scilly TR21 0JL , England ( tel . 011-44-720-22536 ) for hotel and transportation specifics . I ordered the useful &quot; Standard Guidebook to the Isles of Scilly &quot; from them for $ 4 ; it describes each of the islands , and their roads and trails and gives information about the plant and animal life .</TEXT>
