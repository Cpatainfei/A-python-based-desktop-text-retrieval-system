   <HEADLINE> IOWA ROBBERY_SUSPECT IS FIRST TO FACE U.S. ' 3 STRIKES ' CHARGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first criminal suspect to be charged under the federal_government ' s new &quot; three strikes &quot; law has been indicted in Iowa , marking a turning point that could shift significant numbers of felons from state to federal_courts and prisons . Justice_Department officials Thursday identified the first three strikes defendant as Thomas Lee Farmer , an accused grocery_store robber who has state convictions for murder , murder conspiracy and armed robbery . If convicted under Iowa law , Farmer could have been sentenced to no more_than 25 years in prison . Under the new federal provisions in the crime bill signed by President Clinton on Sept . 13 , Farmer was indicted this week by a federal grand_jury for robbery and will receive , if convicted , a term of life imprisonment without parole . &quot; This is the beginning of a definite trend by federal prosecutors around the country , &quot; a Justice_Department official predicted . He said that federal lawyers will cooperate with state prosecutors to take_over cases against any defendants who have been convicted of two previous violent crimes . Some criminal defense_lawyers and other critics see problems developing from the trend , including the further overcrowding of prisons and reduction of negotiated plea agreements that tend to prevent logjams in both state and federal_courts . Under the &quot; three strikes &quot; law , a defendant who has had two previous convictions -- either state or federal -- for violent crimes will face a mandatory life term if his third conviction is for a serious federal offense , including a drug crime . White collar offenses , such_as bank fraud or wire fraud , are exempt . U.S. Atty . Stephen J . Rapp of Waterloo , Iowa , said that he had cooperated with state prosecutors to obtain a federal indictment against Farmer , on condition that state robbery charges be dismissed against him . The new federal law provides a heavier penalty for Farmer , 42 , because Iowa has not enacted its own &quot; three strikes and you ' re out &quot; law . The California Legislature passed a three strikes measure earlier this year and state voters are being asked to approve a parallel ballot measure next week . Kevin Ohlson , special counsel to the U.S. attorney for Washington , D.C. , said that prosecutors across the country will take_advantage of the longer prison sentences provided by Congress for persons who commit repeated serious street crimes like murder , assault , rape , robbery , kidnaping , carjacking and firearms offenses . &quot; If there ' s a situation where we have a violent defendant for whom we know we could get a long prison_term without parole instead of only a 10-year term , for example , then we would bring it in federal_court , &quot; Ohlson said .</TEXT>
