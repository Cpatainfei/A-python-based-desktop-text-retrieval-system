   <HEADLINE> INTERIORS ; HARMONIC CONVERSION ; MORE THAN 20 DESIGNERS TRANSFORMED AN ANAHEIM HILLS HOUSE INTO A VILLA BY BLENDING CLASSICAL WITH CONTEMPORARY IN TONES OF TUSCANY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It could have been a decorating disaster on a grand scale : More_than 20 Orange County interior_designers , each with his or her own distinct style , recently collaborated on revamping a 17-room estate from floor to ceiling . With so many decorators on one project , one would expect a hodgepodge of clashing decors . Instead , when the 1994 Philharmonic House of Design opens its tall , arched doors to the public today , visitors will see a home unified by theme and color that looks more like the work of one versatile designer instead of two_dozen . The estate , a 7 # 500-square-foot Mediterranean-style villa in the Peralta Hills area of Anaheim Hills , was transformed by volunteers from the Orange County chapter of the American Society of Interior_Designers . It will be open for tours through May 29 to raise money for the Orange County Philharmonic Society . Visitors to the home will see a blend of traditional and contemporary styles . The designers managed to pull_together an eclectic mix of furnishings , window treatments , faux finishes and floor_coverings to create one harmonious interior . Like the designers , homeowners often must create a cohesive decor by drawing from a wide range of styles -- mixing , say , a beloved antique wingback chair with a modern iron and glass coffee_table . The design house shows how seemingly disparate design elements can work together . To achieve this unity , they worked with committee leaders who decided on the decor ' s theme and color_scheme . In keeping with the home ' s architecture , the committee encouraged designers to incorporate the classical elements of an Italian villa with contemporary features befitting a modern Southern California home . The designers responded by painting the walls with faux finishes , murals and frescoes in the tradition of Michelangelo . They covered the floors in everything from Persian rugs to contemporary Berber carpeting . They picked fabrics for draperies , bedding and upholstery that run the gamut from light gauze to heavy tapestry . They found artwork and unique accessories that are both contemporary and Renaissance-inspired . Color proved the glue that holds these competing textures and materials together . &quot; Each room is very different . . . but they all blend , &quot; says Mona Clark , ASID co-chairwoman of the design house project . &quot; The blending force is the color palette. &quot; In keeping with the Italian theme , the committee chose the warm , rich hues of Tuscany for the color palette : a pale , dusty green called &quot; willow , &quot; off-white , clay , a deep , gun-metal gray called &quot; iron stone , &quot; moss , antique gold and terra_cotta . &quot; We looked_at colors that were coming_into fashion for 1994-95 , &quot; Clark says . &quot; Then we looked_at fabrics . The colors all reminded us of frescoes . We thought they would fit_in with an Italian villa. &quot; Each designer was assigned a room and came_up with a floor_plan and concept for the decor that was submitted to the committee . &quot; The committee let them know if they were_on the right track , &quot; Clark says . ( The owner , who is selling the estate for about $ 2 million , also approved the plans . Although furnishings will be removed after the tour , surface treatments and carpeting will remain ) . * John Garcia , the designer in_charge of the estate ' s &quot; great room , &quot; a flow-through kitchen , kitchen nook , family_room and bar , used a mix of colors , textures and furnishings to give his area a warm , lived-in look . The stainless_steel of the kitchen_stove and hood and cabinet fixtures , the large bronze Thai rain drum in the center of the family_room , the mirror and glass coffee_table , the taupe and black faux leather ottoman , the nubby oatmeal-colored carpet and knotty_pine floors -- all blend to form &quot; a room that looks_like it ' s been put_together over many years of traveling and collecting , &quot; Garcia says . One of Garcia ' s first acts was to replace the &quot; busy &quot; hand-painted floral tiles in the kitchen with French tile in a subtle bone color with a limestone border . &quot; A lot of times , less is more . Everything can ' t be a star in the room , &quot; Garcia says . &quot; You need control . Let one thing be your highlight and the others support it. &quot; He painted the walls &quot; the color of chocolate_mousse &quot; to give the family_room a &quot; warm , homey feeling . It ' s a color that draws you. &quot; The light-colored carpet , massive windows and a sectional sofa lit from underneath all keep the room airy and light . Dawn Piel , the designer who created the combination home_office and den , had a different challenge . &quot; I didn ' t want to do a stereotypical home_office , &quot; Piel says . &quot; that ' s an area of the home that really hasn ' t been addressed . It often looks terrible , but we spend a lot of time there. &quot; Piel ' s chief obstacle was how to hide unsightly computer equipment and desk files . She designed an office center that looks_like a china_cabinet with a faux burl wood finish so that all_the equipment could be hidden behind doors and drawers . She also covered the walls with 2 / 3-inch layer of foam and a clay-colored damask fabric for sound-proofing and a soft look . &quot; It ' s terrific to do if you have a small condo where you have to share walls . It absolutely deadens the sound , &quot; she says . Instead of uncomfortable office_furniture , Piel used upholstered furniture including a tapestry-covered daybed to make this a room for both work and leisure . When not staring into a computer , one can relax on the daybed and peer up at a trompe l ' oeil cloud-covered ceiling painted by artist Lorenzo George . The Renaissance-inspired ceiling is one of many frescoes and murals throughout the residence . The library , for instance , has cherubs looking down from on high . &quot; It looks_like the Sistine Chapel , &quot; Clark says . * Examples of the power of the paintbrush are everywhere . Designer Gene Zettle ' s powder_room is entirely paneled in wood painted to look knotty and aged . Lana Barth and Deanna Rousseau had white doves painted on the walls of the piano niche . Bathrooms , stairways and even the baby ' s room have walls treated with a faux finish that make them look dappled or aged . In a bedroom designed for a fictitious teen-age girl who dreams of going_to Paris and studying fashion design , one wall has been painted with a mural of a Parisian street scene . Actual pink and white striped awnings above the windows and real flower boxes add_to the fantasy , and the black wrought iron headboard on the bed serves double-duty as the make-believe balcony of a French chateau . &quot; We wanted this room to be very whimsical , &quot; says Donna McHale , who designed the room with Judi Smolin under the direction of Betty Hyde . &quot; Everything ' s very swirly , very French and very dreamlike. &quot; In another room decorated for a boy who likes to play with magic , a mural of a wizard hovers over the bed , and there ' s a tree painted in one corner from which real puppets dangle like apples . Home decorators can learn much about proportion by studying the house . Visitors who check_out the sitting area of the master_bedroom suite will find massive artworks by Orlando A.B. on the walls . Designer Bill Kiefer chose the 4-by-6-foot contemporary paintings because the room has a 19-foot ceiling but is not excessively large . The pictures give the room balance , drawing the eye upward from the floor . The bed , itself a work_of_art , has a towering canopy of textured iron with a &quot; desert &quot; gold finish and fills the space created by the bedroom ' s high ceilings . To complement the hardness of the iron bed , Kiefer chose pale silk bedding and sheer cream-colored curtains that wrap loosely around the towering windows . &quot; They ' re just floating , &quot; Kiefer says . Other romantic touches : Persian rugs , a large leaded glass window , columns and a fireplace with a faux marble finish , a hand-painted chest , an antique gold mirror above a built-in desk area and Oriental sculpture . &quot; I like to show how you can bring old things in and use them &quot; in a contemporary setting , Kiefer says . &quot; We have antique sculpture mixed with ultra contemporary art. &quot; The blending of styles is also evident in the dining_room designed by Karen Myers Ziccard . She put a contemporary glass table with Lucite sculpture on a bronze base atop a traditional needlepoint rug with a floral motif . &quot; Everything doesn ' t have to be contemporary or traditional , &quot; she says . &quot; It can work together. &quot; * Unlike the designers , most home decorators don ' t have unlimited access to original artworks and expensive accessories , yet they can duplicate some of the decorating techniques used in the design house . &quot; A lot of things you can do yourself ( to ) make major changes in how you feel about a room , &quot; Piel says . The faux finishes , for instance , can be done with paint and a sponge , rag , tissue_paper or even a feather . Fabric slipcovers can rejuvenate an old chair or sofa and add softness to a room . In addition , choosing eclectic furnishings and mixing contemporary and traditional styles as the designers did can help a home avoid looking_like one of those sterile environments seen in some models , Kiefer says . &quot; We mixed textures , tones and pieces , &quot; he says . &quot; This is definitely not a model home. &quot; Philharmonic House of Design What : Public tours of a 17-room villa showcasing work of 20 interior_designers to raise funds for Orange County Philharmonic Society .
