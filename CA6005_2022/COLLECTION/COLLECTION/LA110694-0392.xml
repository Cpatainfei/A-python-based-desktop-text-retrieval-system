   <HEADLINE> O.C. JUDGES , OFFICIALS RODE IN LAWYER ' S LIMO ; GOVERNMENT : WILLIAM W . STEWART , WHO HAS A CONTRACT TO DEFEND INDIGENTS , SAYS HE WAS NOT SEEKING INFLUENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A local attorney selected by Orange County judges for a lucrative contract to defend indigents accused of crimes has for years provided local judges and other officials a chauffeur-driven limousine to ferry them to fund-raisers , private dinners and sporting events throughout Southern California . Some judges and the limousine driver said the passengers have included Superior_Court Judges Myron S . Brown and Luis Cardenas , and Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H . Vasquez -- some of the same officials who , at times , have helped oversee the county ' s contract with attorney William W . Stewart over the past 15 years . Also taking_advantage of the limousine service was District_Attorney Investigator Rusty Hodges . All acknowledged being chauffeured around in the limousine , but denied there is anything wrong with what they did . In some years , the Central Court contract , which was awarded to Stewart without competitive bidding , has been worth nearly $ 1 million in annual fees for his Santa Ana firm and its associates . &quot; The word was out : If you wanted the limousine and you had a legitimate reason and if it was available , you could use it , &quot; said Cardenas , who recalled using the vehicle one time &quot; a long_time ago &quot; to attend a local charity event with Stewart and his wife . Cardenas later said he could have been a guest in the car on other occasions . He said he remembers being &quot; impressed &quot; that a law_firm would have a limousine at its disposal . He said he was particularly pleased to learn that Stewart ' s firm would often provide the car service as a &quot; designated driver &quot; for attorneys , judges or others who may have had too_much too drink at functions . &quot; Because of the drunk-driving thing , most of us tried to be careful , &quot; said Cardenas , adding that he never had to avail himself of Stewart ' s post-party service . Stewart said he maintained a &quot; pretty open policy &quot; with the car , and , on most occasions , accompanied those who used it . &quot; I ' m not trying to buy judges , &quot; Stewart said . &quot; There are judges who are friends of mine . I made the car available to a lot of charity events. &quot; The state ' s Fair Political Practices Commission requires judges and other elected California officials to report gifts valued at $ 50 or more -- including limousine services . The driver , who requested anonymity for fear of retribution , said the car charge was $ 25 per hour and -- except for quick one-way trips -- events typically ran two hours or more . Neither Cardenas nor Brown , a passenger in the car on at least three occasions in the past three years , reported any such gifts on their annual disclosure statements since 1987 , the earliest year the judges ' records were available . * Both judges have presided over cases in which Stewart ' s firm represented indigent clients under terms of the county contract . And Brown once chaired the Alternate Defense Committee , which wields considerable influence over indigent defense_policy for the county . Vasquez , one of five members on the County Board of Supervisors , which has routinely granted contract extensions for Stewart ' s firm on the recommendation of local judges , said he was a guest in the car on two occasions . The supervisor said he paid the driver for one of the rides , a trip to Los Angeles to meet and dine with French government officials two or three years ago . But the driver , who took Vasquez to Los Angeles , said the supervisor &quot; did not pay me 10 cents &quot; because it was against the firm ' s policy for the driver to accept money from passengers . Also about that time , the supervisor said he used the car on a second outing to host the wife of former U.S. Atty . Gen . Richard Thornburgh for a tour of the Orangewood Children ' s Home . Vasquez said he did not reimburse Stewart ' s firm for the limousine on that occasion , but he did not consider the Orangewood outing as a gift because he was &quot; doing county business &quot; by trying to secure more federal funding for Orangewood . Hodges , a key investigator in the prosecution of former Supervisor Don R . Roth on charges related to the improper acceptance of gifts , said he paid both times he used the car , once &quot; chipping_in about $ 20 or $ 30 &quot; for a trip to the airport three or four years ago , and again about two years ago to shuttle friends to a party for an office colleague . The driver said he recalled Hodges as a passenger in the car more_than twice . However , he also said that the investigator once pushed $ 100 in his shirt pocket after an office party to cover the group ' s expenses for the four-hour outing , even though the driver was not supposed to accept payments from passengers . &quot; I ' ve known all those guys a_hundred years , &quot; Hodges said . &quot; My deal was I paid the driver. &quot; Meanwhile , Judge Cardenas said he did not consider use of the limousine to be a gift because he recalled using it for only a charity event . &quot; It wasn ' t like I was getting anything out of it , &quot; he said . &quot; At the time , everything was very ethical to me. &quot; Brown said he was typically one of several people in the car who accompanied Stewart to football games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum during the past three years . The judge said he never considered the limousine rides as something he would have to disclose in annual financial_statements because of his long friendship with Stewart . &quot; It didn ' t dawn on me it was a gift . . . I don ' t believe it was . He and I have been friends for years , &quot; Brown said . Although he and Stewart have enjoyed a close relationship , Brown said he has been &quot; careful to avoid the appearance of impropriety , &quot; especially when Stewart or his firm had cases in his court . While Brown served as the presiding judge of criminal matters in Superior_Court between 1987 and 1989 , Stewart or his associates worked frequently in Brown ' s court on matters related to the indigent defense contract . During that time , Brown said , he tried to distance himself somewhat from his old friend Stewart , until associates suggested there was no reason to avoid socializing with him because of his judicial position . About the end of his term as criminal presiding judge , Brown said he accompanied Stewart to Las Vegas and stayed in the attorney ' s hotel suite at Stewart ' s expense . Again , because of the pair ' s long friendship , Brown did not see the need to report the hotel stay as a gift , as required by the FPPC . &quot; It was a very reciprocal-type thing for us , &quot; the judge said of their friendship . &quot; Half the time , I would pick_up the tab . . . . That concept of avoiding even the appearance of impropriety is a terribly important concept to me . &quot; I can ' t think_of anything I would do for William Stewart that I would n ' t do for any other attorney. &quot; On the occasions when he was a passenger in Stewart ' s limousine , Brown said it usually resulted from a brief discussion about who intended to drive to the weekend football game . &quot; It just happened that Bill had this car that didn ' t require either of us to drive , &quot; Brown said , adding that on one of the game days the judge provided Bloody Marys and food for the trip . &quot; That was my contribution . I never liked limousines . It was never a perk I expected or anticipated. &quot; The disclosures about the firm ' s car service has come during a particularly troubling year for Stewart . In June , other judges alleged that Stewart had been subletting much of his contract caseload to other lawyers but continued to share_in the contract ' s profits . At the same time , the judges expressed concern about delays in resolving criminal cases because the contract attorneys were unavailable for court appearances . * Court officials also confirmed that Stewart sometimes communicated with the county court system by telephone or fax from his former import-export business in Colombia . Although Stewart once dismissed his critics in the judiciary as &quot; idiots , &quot; the concerns prompted judicial higher-ups to review Stewart ' s work performance . Although there were proposals that the judges should divide the lucrative business among several law_firms , in the end they left it up_to Stewart to decide whether to share the cases with other firms , or to retain the exclusivity he has under the existing contract . Stewart said then that he would not make a change , especially at a time when his performance was being attacked . The attorney -- known in some legal circles as &quot; Don Guillermo &quot; because of former business interests in South_America -- has talked with pride of the years spent cultivating relationships with local judges , state lawmakers and county supervisors . In all those years , though , Stewart said he has never sought special favors and has not been the recipient of any . &quot; He is a big-hearted kind of guy , &quot; Judge Brown said , &quot; and a lot of people have taken_advantage of him . But I wasn ' t around just because he had a limousine. &quot;</TEXT>
