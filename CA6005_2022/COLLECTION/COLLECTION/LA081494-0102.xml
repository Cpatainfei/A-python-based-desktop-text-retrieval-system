   <HEADLINE> THE WORLD ; DON ' T ALLOW THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE TO LANGUISH INTO IRRELEVANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> By far the most worrisome aspect of U.S. foreign_policy is the progressive erosion of the Atlantic Alliance . To be sure , the disintegration of the Soviet empire , the retreat of Soviet armies and the unification of Germany require major changes in the structure and purpose of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization . But what is happening is not adaptation ; rather , it is decline into an empty shell , with nary a public discussion . On his three trips to Europe this year , Bill_Clinton discussed the alliance as if it were a Cold_War relic . He defined its significance almost exclusively in_relation_to the Partnership for Peace , which , in his view , is not about security but about reconciliation . Having been approved by the NATO council , joined by Russia and a host of other Central and East European_countries , the partnership is now a fact of life . But it is not too late to prevent it from submerging the Atlantic Alliance , so patiently and so beneficially constructed over 40 years and still so necessary to deal with a world in turmoil . The Partnership for Peace is a hybrid of the Wilsonian concept of collective_security and of the Henry Wallace ideology of the 1940s -- both of which reject the concept of alliance . NATO was designed for security , the partnership for reassurance . The Atlantic Alliance assumed that its threats came from outside the treaty area , while the partnership seeks to pacify threats within its area by affirmations of good intentions . This is what Clinton describes as the partnership ' s truly new aspect : &quot; for the first time , all nation-states really do respect the territorial integrity of one another. &quot; The novel aspect of Clinton ' s European policy is that it seeks to build the Atlantic area from East to West , reversing the architecture of the postwar period . But making Russia the hinge of U.S. Atlantic policy places an exorbitant strain on one of the most brittle nations . And it lures the United States into assigning a role to Germany that its leaders have not requested , its circumstances do not favor and that unnecessarily wounds Great Britain and France . During his visit to Berlin , Clinton called_on Germany to assume a special responsibility for Eastern Europe and Russia , in particular ; he called the U.S. relationship with Germany &quot; singular &quot; because Germany had a more &quot; immediate and tangible concern &quot; with relations with Russia &quot; even than our other friends in Europe. &quot; Nothing illustrates better the lack of historical perspective plaguing current foreign_policy . Even to hint at a solitary and preeminent role for a country whose disasters have been caused by its inability to manage a purely national policy in the center of the Continent is as disquieting to Germany ' s neighbors as it is to the architects of German postwar policy . It is not without significance that , in responding to the President , Chancellor Helmut Kohl specifically invoked the legacy of Chancellor Konrad Adenauer -- to seek a major German role not on a purely national basis but as an integral part of the Atlantic Alliance and of the European Union . The impact of a so-called &quot; singular &quot; German-American relationship on the rest of Europe will be to foster separation of Western Europe from the United States , widespread fear in Eastern Europe and the isolation of Germany within Europe . If present trends continue , NATO policy will become increasingly rudderless . Despite ritualistic assertions to the contrary , the Administration ' s Atlantic policy is creating two categories of frontier in Europe : those that are guaranteed are not threatened , and those that are threatened are not guaranteed . The result is a gray area in Eastern and Central Europe that the nations affected find severely disquieting and that can only tempt dangerous tendencies . No reassuring phrases can change the reality that Poland , partitioned four times by Russia in two centuries , thinks_of Russia as a threat , not as a partner . The countries joining the partnership are thus doing so to implement incompatible conceptions . The nations of Central and Eastern Europe are joining because they see it as a steppingstone into NATO . Russia is joining to drain NATO of content , as is evidenced by various Russian proposals amounting to a veto over NATO decisions . Thus , when U.S. leaders imply to Poland that NATO membership is just around the corner and to Russia that it can participate in any security arrangement open_to its former satellites ( in other words , join NATO eventually ) , confusion ( and worse ) is inevitable when the promissory_notes fall due . A coherent Atlantic policy has two requirements : to infuse the core alliance with a new sense_of_direction , including settling its membership ; second , to separate its organizational activities from those of the partnership . With respect_to the first , these questions must be dealt with : What is the core NATO supposed to do ? What are the common objectives ? Indeed , what exactly is the core of NATO ? Until the question of membership in NATO is settled , the revitalization of the core Atlantic Alliance will languish . The partnership served a useful purpose in opening a discussion of NATO expansion . But further delay invites Germany and Russia to fill the vacuum between them either unilaterally or bilaterally . So_long as NATO and the partnership are merged organizationally , it will prove difficult to define common objectives for the core alliance . Twenty-two nations have already applied for membership in the partnership ; scores are eligible . Each nation is supposed to come_up with its own program of bilateral cooperation with NATO . No one familiar_with how NATO operates can believe that , as now constituted , the alliance bureaucracy can plan individual partnership programs and simultaneously generate a creative adaptation of the alliance itself to the new circumstances . Russia must be integrated into the international community . But since this is , above all , a political and economic challenge , NATO is not the best institution for that task . Russian membership in the political aspects of the G-7 meetings and participation in multilateral forums dealing with the Balkans and Korea are important . Bilateral consultations between Washington and Moscow will play a crucial role . The European Security Conference comprising all_the nations eligible for the partnership was designed for precisely this role . The Atlantic Alliance was not . Why destroy the safety net when forums for reconciliation already exist ? *</TEXT>
