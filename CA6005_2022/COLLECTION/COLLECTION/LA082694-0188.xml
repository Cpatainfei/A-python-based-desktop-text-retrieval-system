   <TEXT> When Candee Messmore took her son Spenser to the dentist when he was 2 , the examination nev er moved beyond Spenser ' s clenched mouth . &quot; The dentist ' s attitude was that my son needed to be big and sit in the chair alone , without me there , &quot; said Messmore , who lives_in Granada Hills . &quot; The whole experience started so negatively that he remembered it and referred to it for a whole year. &quot; Messmore ' s story , say experts , is not uncommon , and its impact can be far-reaching . Childhood fears can turn_into a lifelong dread of dentistry , which , in turn , may keep even adults from seeking the care and treatment they need . To head_off this kind of trauma for her son , Messmore made an appointment with a specialist trained to handle children : a pediatric dentist . During his first visit , she said , &quot; Spenser forgot all his fears . When we walked in , there was a treasure_chest full of toys . The dentist let Spenser push_buttons , move the chair up and down , squirt the water and touch all_of his tools . He even demonstrated the tools on Spenser ' s arm. &quot; Such playfulness and sensitivity are no accident , according to Dr. Stephen Howard , a Tarzana dentist also known as &quot; Dr. Supertooth. &quot; &quot; During the first year of pediatric dental training , &quot; he explained , &quot; we receive classes that revolve_around the emotional and psychological growth of the child . Kids go_through so many changes , and a good dentist has to be aware of what level they ' re on . You don ' t want to talk_down to them or use language they don ' t understand. &quot; To find a pediatric dentist who is both qualified and simpatico , Howard suggests getting a referral from a satisfied parent . &quot; Then just show_up at the office and ask to look_around , &quot; he advised . &quot; If the staff is receptive to the visit , that ' s a good sign. &quot; Many preschools offer group visits to dental offices , where kids get hands-on experiences with dental tools , said Howard , who has hosted such visits himself during his 20 years in practice . * To calm youngsters before their first appointment , Pat Azarnoff , executive_director of Tarzana-based Pediatric Projects , advises parents to express confidence in the dentist but not to offer unnecessary details . &quot; Just prepare them for what they will see and feel , &quot; said Azarnoff , whose organization distributes toys and books to help children understand health_care . &quot; Say , ' We need to keep your teeth clean and healthy and the way we do that is that a dentist checks your teeth . You will need to sit in a chair , open your mouth wide , like this , so the dentist can see inside . And I ' ll be right beside you. ' &quot; Howard added that parents can take cues from dentists about how to simplify complicated dental language for young children . &quot; We talk_about putting a Band-Aid on a tooth , not drilling a filling , &quot; he said . &quot; And we don ' t give shots , we put a tooth to sleep. &quot; Similarly , Howard rejects the term &quot; waiting room &quot; in favor of &quot; family room. &quot; In his office , this is a place packed with toys and computer_games for children of every age . Pictures of patients are_on a bulletin_board , some taken with a giant bear Howard keeps_on hand . Dr. Mostafa Rad , who has practiced pediatric dentistry in Woodland Hills for six years , allays children ' s fears by giving them choices . &quot; I ask them what flavor of fluoride they want -- strawberry , banana , bubble_gum or mint , &quot; he explained . &quot; It gives them a sense of control and boosts their confidence level . I become like a friend. &quot; Another welcoming device involves the layout of a dentist ' s office . Instead of closed examination rooms , Howard ' s floor_plan features a large open bay that harbors five dental chairs . &quot; One child can see that the other kids are OK while they ' re being examined , and it creates peer support , &quot; Howard said . &quot; It eliminates that closed-door feeling. &quot; Should an examination take_place in a separate room , most pediatric dentists allow parents to accompany their children . &quot; A child sees the exam as this new experience and they need mom or dad near to help translate it , &quot; said Azarnoff . &quot; There is no substitute for a trusted parent at a young age. &quot; * When a child turns 5 , say experts , parents can usually begin cutting_down the time they spend in the examination room . Moms and dads who take their children to a pediatric dentist might be shocked to learn that it can cost more_than their own dental_care -- an average of $ 60 for a visit . But , like Messmore , many parents who have tried the alternatives have no complaints , especially when they encounter someone like Howard . &quot; For the better part of 17 years , I came_to work each day dressed as Dr. Supertooth , wearing white tights , blue trunks and a red cape with a tooth logo on my chest , &quot; Howard recalled . While many of his patients have outgrown the gimmick , and he has put it aside , he is still known to some by his larger-than-life moniker . &quot; This business , &quot; he said fondly , &quot; is all about how to make dental visits light and easy . We do_it for the kids. &quot; Putting Teeth First Introducing children to the dentist early can lay the foundation for a lifelong habit of good dental hygiene . According to Pat Azarnoff , executive_director of Tarzana-based Pediatric Projects , &quot; There are many children today under the age of 10 who have never had a cavity because they ' ve been getting checkups and fluoride from the start . &quot; The American Dental Assn . recommends taking children in by age 1 , &quot; she said , &quot; then once or twice a year after that for checkups to see if the teeth and jaw are growing properly. &quot; An early visit benefits grown-ups as much as it does their children , said Dr. Mostafa Rad , a dentist who practices in Woodland Hills . &quot; It teaches parents to care_for their baby ' s teeth and gums. &quot; During the consultation , dentists can also evaluate -- and inform parents about -- any adverse habits , such_as thumb-sucking , and they can determine a child ' s fluoride needs . X-rays may be taken_to determine if the teeth and facial bones are developing properly and to spot any hidden decay . As soon as a child ' s first teeth begin to appear , usually by the 13th month , Rad suggests draping a gauze pad or washcloth over a finger to wipe the teeth gently . After the child is used to the procedure , parents can use a soft-bristled toothbrush with a small dab of toothpaste . They should also floss when the child ' s teeth become close enough to trap food particles , as well as brush after breakfast and before bedtime . Kids can begin helping_out with brushing at age 4 or 5 , a practice Rad encourages to build confidence . Depending_on their manual_dexterity , many children will be cleaning their teeth on_their_own before they ' re 8 . Experts advise parents to set a good_example by brushing and flossing their own teeth twice each day , and by visiting their dentists regularly . For children with particular fears or questions about dentistry , the following books , geared for youngsters ages 2 to 6 , may prove helpful to parents : * &quot; My Dentist , &quot; by Harlow Rockewell , Morrow Books , $ 4.95. * &quot; Going_to the Dentist , &quot; by Anne Civardi and Stephen Cartwright , EDC / Usborne Books , $ 3.95. * &quot; The Berenstain Bears Visit the Dentist , &quot; by Stan and Jan Berenstain , Random House , $ 2.50. * &quot; Just Going_to the Dentist , &quot; by Mercer Mayer , Western Books , $ 2.95 .</TEXT>
