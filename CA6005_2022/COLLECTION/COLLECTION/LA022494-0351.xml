   <HEADLINE> CHRISTOPHER TIES HAITI SANCTIONS TO ARISTIDE OK OF COALITION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , underlining a growing friction between the Clinton_Administration and ousted Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide , said Wednesday that the United States will not seek new economic sanctions against Haiti ' s military rulers unless Aristide agrees to name a coalition government . Christopher told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that it would be pointless to tighten the embargo against Haiti until Aristide accepts a practical political plan to restore democracy to the impoverished Caribbean country . Although the Administration has been trying_for more_than a week to persuade Aristide to endorse a coalition government plan advanced by a group of Haitian politicians , Christopher was the first official to link the plan to new economic sanctions . Previously , Administration spokesmen had said that Washington would impose the sanctions regardless of whether Aristide endorsed the compromise proposal . Diplomats from the United States , France , Canada and Venezuela have been discussing a draft of a sanctions resolution with members of the U.N. Security_Council for weeks . The four countries agreed in December to seek stronger sanctions if the military government of Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras did not step aside to permit Aristide to regain the office he lost in a bloody coup in September , 1991 . But Christopher said Wednesday that the United States is wary of tougher sanctions because they would increase suffering in the Western_Hemisphere ' s poorest country . His remarks seemed to plunge relations between the Administration and Aristide to a new low . U.S. officials are becoming increasingly impatient with what they consider Aristide ' s inflexibility . For his part , Aristide , the only freely elected president in Haiti ' s history , is said to believe that the Administration has lost interest in helping him regain his lost office . &quot; We believe that sanctions can add a good_deal of pressure , &quot; Christopher said . &quot; We think that they are most effective , though , when they are moving toward some political result . At the present_time . . . there is no plan that we can be promoting effectively with the sanctions. &quot; Christopher said that the coalition government plan , advanced by eight Haitian parliamentarians whom he called a &quot; developing centrist group , &quot; offers the best chance of restoring democracy to Haiti . The plan calls_for Aristide to name a new prime_minister who could form a coalition civilian government to clear the way for Aristide ' s eventual return to office . Aristide flatly rejected the proposal , saying it contains no guarantee that he would ever be able to return to power . Aristide ' s camp is also concerned that the plan would require him to share power with a prime_minister . Aristide and Cedras signed an agreement last summer on Governors Island in New York Harbor that was supposed to restore the ousted president by Oct . 30 . However , the military_leaders refused to keep their promise to step_down . Aristide ' s Washington lawyer , former Rep . Michael Barnes ( D-Md. ) , said that the proposal advanced by the parliamentarians &quot; is much weaker than what was agreed to at Governors Island. &quot; Barnes called_on the Security_Council to vote for new sanctions to force the army to keep the agreements it made at Governors Island . Sen . Christopher J . Dodd ( D-Conn. ) said the Administration ' s new policy places too_much reliance on the goodwill of the military_leaders who staged the coup . &quot; It seems to me we are putting pressure on the wrong party here , &quot; Dodd told Christopher . Meanwhile , Aristide announced plans to address international human_rights conferences in Paris on Sunday and in Geneva on Wednesday in an effort to generate new pressure on the military regime . At the United Nations , a spokesman said that Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , trying to break the impasse , has invited Aristide to New York , presumably to discuss the parliamentarians ' plan . Times staff writer Stanley Meisler contributed to this report .</TEXT>
