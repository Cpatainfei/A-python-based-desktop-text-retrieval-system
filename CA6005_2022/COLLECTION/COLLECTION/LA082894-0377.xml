   <HEADLINE> DESTINATION : MEXICO_CITY ; CENTRAL_PARK SOUTH ; REJUVENATED CHAPULTEPEC , THE SOUL OF THE CAPITAL , MAY NOW BE ONE OF THE WORLD ' S FINEST URBAN PARKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This is the capital and heart of Mexico . But to find the core and soul of Mexico_City , one must visit Chapultepec Park on a Sunday . In a city of magnificent public spaces and public art , Chapultepec is the ultimate open space , green and egalitarian , open_to all for free . Nearly twice the size of New York ' s Central_Park , the 1 # 561-acre Chapultepec is probably the world ' s busiest and , arguably , finest urban park . To Chilangos , as Mexico_City residents call themselves , it serves as a prime source of recreation and surcease from urban chaos and pollution , a verdant refuge in what is now the world ' s most populous metropolis with nearly 20 million people , and growing rapidly . They visit the park at a rate of more_than a_million and a half a week , mainly on weekends and holidays , when the crush nearly rivals the Mexico_City subway in rush_hour . They picnic , cycle , stroll , boat , and drink_in Mexican history , art and culture in the park ' s eight superb museums . Though I am a regular visitor to Mexico , I had not been to the capital for more_than 10 years . I recall the park then as run-down and scarred by litter , with many of its trees dying from pollution . On a return visit this August , I found the park still very crowded , but transformed and vastly more attractive . In recent years the Mexico_City government has poured more_than $ 70 million into renovating and updating the park , or the bosque ( forest ) , as it is called locally . They planted thousands of new trees , intensified the long-standing war on rats , shut_down and remodeled run-down restaurants and cafes , and built a dazzling new museum for children , Museo del Nino el Papalote , which opened nine months ago . They also brought_in a private company to remodel a decrepit , 30-year-old amusement_park , La Feria . After an $ 18-million , three-month face-lift , it reopened last December with 49 new rides and has quickly become a major national attraction . Little wonder : For only $ 6 total , a family of four can spend the whole day , with 30 free rides per person . * But nothing has energized Chapultepec quite so_much as the reopening of its 60-year-old Zoologico ( zoo ) on Aug . 1 after a two-year , $ 71-million renovation . The zoo was designed by the renowned Mexican architect Ricardo Legoretta , who also redesigned Pershing Square in downtown Los Angeles . It reflects his stark planar style , with bright yellows and purples , and drew such crushing crowds -- 150 # 000 people -- on its first day that the authorities had to shut it down for a_few days to revamp security arrangements . The reincarnation is part of Mexico_City ' s attempt to redefine itself and make itself more attractive to visitors , both foreign and Mexican . I was impressed with the changes : The once-clogged streets in the historic city_center near the cathedral and national palace have been cleared of street vendors in a complex political arrangement whereby thousands of them were relocated to small stalls in newly built malls . Bicycle-drawn taxis have been introduced downtown to reduce air_pollution and congestion . And efforts are being made to upgrade the traditional tourist center in the Zona Rosa , which has become somewhat seedy in recent years . Chapultepec is steeped in Mexican history . It was an Aztec ceremonial site more_than 700 years ago , and later an aqueduct was built to carry water from its spring to Tenochtitlan , the great pyramid city 25 miles northeast of downtown Mexico_City . Legend has it that the profligate Montezuma II kept an aviary in Chapultepec and maintained a human-relay system of 900 people to bring fresh_fish to feed the birds every day from Veracruz 240 miles away . With the Spanish invasion by Hernando Cortes , the forest became a site for bloody battles in 1521 , and the Spanish built a castle on Chapultepec Hill in the 18th Century . With Mexico ' s declaration_of_independence from Spain in 1810 , Chapultepec was declared public_property and served an important role in the century-long interim between liberty and democracy . The castle was the home for Emperor Maximilian and , later , for Mexican presidents . It is now a museum of Mexican history ; the current president still lives_in the park , in a mansion just behind the Russian Mountain roller_coaster . * I stayed_at the Hotel Nikko on the northern edge of the park , adjoining the fashionable Polanco residential_area . That area is becoming a new tourist destination , with luxury hotels and restaurants . In addition to the Nikko , there is the Presidente Inter-Continental Mexico_City and , to open later this year , the 300-room Mandarin Oriental Mexico . From these hotels , it is an easy walk to the famed Museo Nacional de Antropologia ( National Museum of Anthropology ) , the zoo and botanical_gardens . Chapultepec , open every day of the year , is divided into three sections . The most crowded is Section 1 , which includes the zoo , the castle , the Museo de Arte Moderno ( Museum of Modern Art ) , a children ' s section , the botanical_garden , a garden reserved for the elderly and a Korean garden , among many other attractions . Section 2 has the amusement_park , a lake with the famed Lago del Chapultepec restaurant , the 10 # 000-seat national auditorium , a museum of technology , the new children ' s museum and murals by Diego Rivera . Section 3 is more pastoral , with jogging trails , stables and a rodeo arena . For most foreign visitors , the chief attraction is the anthropology museum , just north of Section 1 across the Paseo de la Reforma . Reserve the better part of a day for this museum , an institution that ranks with the Louvre and the Metropolitan Museum of Art as one of the world ' s premiere cultural assets . ( The inscriptions on the exhibits are extremely informative , but all_in Spanish ; it is probably worth buying an English guide for 45 pesos , or about $ 14. ) The museum traces the pre-Columbian origins of human habitation in Mesoamerica , through Olmec , Toltec , Aztec , Maya and other cultures . The most arresting section is Room VII , devoted to the Aztecs , with the famed round Aztec calendar stone and a realistic diorama of Tenochtitlan life . But I focused_on Room X , which houses the stelae -- carved-stone religious statuary -- and other highly refined artifacts of Mexico ' s most advanced pre-Hispanic civilization , the Maya Indians of the Yucatan_Peninsula . An auditorium off the lobby features regular dance and music presentations . * But one doesn ' t have to go_to a museum to get an anthropological experience in Chapultepec . As I discovered on a recent Sunday , the park is a colorful circus of activity , conducted amid a maze of paths lined with elegant wrought-iron benches , artificial lagoons and carefully tended gardens . The most prominent trees are the more_than 1 # 000 ahuehuetes , sequoia-like trees planted by the Aztecs more_than 10 centuries ago . Vendors with small carts sell a dazzling array of snacks , such_as chicharrones , which look_like huge potato_chips but are made of flour and pork and covered with chile sauce , or mueganos , a candy covered with caramel and pieces of lemon and coconut . For four pesos you can have your fortune told by a green sparrow-like bird , a gorrion , which comes_out of its cage and picks a folded-paper fortune out of a box . Most visitors would find the park more agreeable on a weekday , when the crowds are thinner . But , determined to have the most authentic experience , I ventured in on a cloudy , drizzly Sunday . With a smattering of Spanish , it is not hard to meet the locals , who usually come_in large family groups to picnic , walk and talk , often traveling hours by bus from remote parts of the city . * Near the lake , I chatted with Antonio Soto and his wife , Claudia , who were strolling hand-in-hand with their 3-year-old son , Carlos Jiovani , clad in a Milwaukee Brewers baseball jacket . Soto told me he labors weekdays as a production worker in the huge Bimbo bread factory and his wife sells Tupperware . But about once a month the Soto family takes the one-hour bus ride from their remote suburb to Chapultepec . The boy loves the carnival games , Soto said , and wants to see the zoo . &quot; We want to go_to the zoo , but we are waiting for the crowds to die_down , &quot; Soto said . Indeed , the lines at the amusement_park and the zoo are often long on weekends . Still , for visitors with_children , both are worth the visit . Fifteen-acre La Feria is small by American amusement-park standards , but well-organized , clean and distinctly Mexican . The entrance to the roller_coaster sits under a huge painted Aztec calendar and the fronts of the coaster cars have elaborate carved images of the Aztec fire snake . * My last Chapultepec stop was the zoo . The 44-acre zoo , with 1 # 294 animals , is by no means the world ' s largest , but it is very possibly the most elegant . I entered through a broad , tiled esplanade leading into winding paths that flow into several major ecosystems : tropical_rain_forest , woodlands , savannah , tundra . There is also a fine six-acre aviary that has two golden_eagles , the symbol of Mexico . The paths are lined with bamboo and other vegetation and rise_up and down through banks of false rocks and waterfalls , all part of Legoretta ' s purpose of trying to make visitors think they are truly away from the city , in a strange land . But the familiar is close_at_hand : Among the zoo ' s food concessions are a McDonald ' s and Domino ' s Pizza . The zoo is_best known for its collection of four pandas , the largest outside China . It also has several species seen almost nowhere else , including several escuincles , a now-rare black hairless dog kept by the Aztecs , and volcano rabbits , an endangered species that lives on the slopes of volcanoes that surround Mexico_City . After three days of wandering around Chapultepec , I left with an exhilarating feeling . Having seen some of the worst of Mexico_City on previous visits -- the fabled smog , the notorious traffic_jams , the poverty-stricken barrios and political turmoil , I thought this was certainly the best of Mexico .
