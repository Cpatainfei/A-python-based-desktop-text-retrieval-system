   <HEADLINE> POP EYE : BLUE SUEDE SHOES FOR BONO AND THE BOSS ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> From Frank to Elvis ? That might be Bono ' s next salute to a personal hero . No one is confirming , but the word is that U2 ' s singer -- fresh from his passionate tribute to Ol ' Blue Eyes on the recent Grammy show -- is set to participate in a Graceland-sponsored Presley tribute scheduled for Oct . 8 at the 14 # 000-seat Pyramid arena in Memphis . The affair will be telecast worldwide and later released on home video and CD . Organizers would not confirm who is being asked to perform , but Pop Eye has learned that Bruce Springsteen is also among artists who have been approached . Springsteen and Bono would both be naturals for the show . Seeing Elvis on &quot; The Ed Sullivan Show &quot; in the ' 50s made Springsteen want to be in rock ' n ' roll , and Bono assumed an Elvis-like persona , gold lame suit and all , during the group ' s 1992-93 tour . He also contributed a version of &quot; can ' t Help Falling_in_Love &quot; to the &quot; Honeymoon in Vegas &quot; soundtrack . This is the first Elvis tribute event officially sanctioned by the Elvis Presley estate . Priscilla Presley , the executor of the estate , has long refused to endorse proposals for such shows . &quot; Until now , Priscilla has not been comfortable with the concept of a tribute , &quot; says Bob Geddes , partner of L.A.-based Avalon Attractions , which is producing the show in conjunction with the Presley estate and the Creative Artists Agency . &quot; But now she believes the timing is right. &quot; A key to the decision to do the show , says Presley estate spokesman David Beckwith , is that it will in part benefit the T.J. Martell Foundation , a music industry organization for cancer and AIDS research , and the Memphis-based St . Jude Children ' s Hospital . Geddes and Avalon partner Brian Murphy are putting_together a diverse lineup that will draw upon performers from many musical genres . &quot; They ' ll be doing a lot of Elvis material and / or material of_their_own influenced by Elvis , &quot; Geddes says . &quot; We ' re going to script the show so it ' s not the typical tribute event . We want it to be more_than just a rotation of artists on the stage. &quot; Details of the television plans -- including possible pay-per-view broadcast -- are expected to be announced next month , with the talent roster to follow . Because of the expected huge demand for tickets , Graceland will hold what is , in_effect , a lottery . Just the rumors of a tribute show led to Graceland ' s being flooded with enough ticket requests from Germany alone to fill the arena.Steve Hochman</TEXT>
