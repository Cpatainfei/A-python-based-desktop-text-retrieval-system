   <HEADLINE> SURPRISING NUCLEAR SAFEGUARD FOUND IN 1979 ACCIDENT ; THREE MILE ISLAND : MOLTEN FUEL COOLED TO SOLID FORM BY WATER IS CREDITED WITH AVERTING A GREATER CATASTROPHE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Molten nuclear fuel cooled to a solid by water surprisingly provided a safeguard against a greater catastrophe during the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant , a recent study asserts . When molten uranium and other metals first flowed to the bottom of the reactor , they formed a ceramic crust that acted_as an insulator . Scientists think pathways carrying water opened between the crust and the steel wall of the reactor and in a mass of molten fuel above the crust . The water and solid fuel prevented the uranium from melting through the vessel and falling to the floor of the containment building , a situation that would have complicated the cleanup further . &quot; The molten fuel had a very important protective capability . that ' s news , &quot; said Eric S . Beckjord , a research_director for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission who wrote a paper analyzing the report . Eleven major industrial nations formed a consortium in 1988 and spent $ 9 million on the TMI Vessel Investigation Project to determine why the steel reactor vessel didn ' t fail despite being subjected_to searing temperatures . Samples were taken from the vessel in 1990 ; a report was issued last October . Details are working their way through the scientific community . The report dramatically confirmed the theory that water can stop molten fuel from breaching a steel reactor vessel , said Steve Sholly , a senior consultant with MHB Technical Associates of San Jose , Calif. , who was not connected to the study . If all water had been lost , the reactor vessel probably would have failed , Sholly added . But people should not conclude that reactor vessels are a lot stronger than once believed , said Jim Riccio , an attorney with the Public Citizen Critical Mass Energy Project . The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission doesn ' t really know how brittle reactor vessels have become because of radiation over long periods , he said . Robert Pollard of the Union of Concerned Scientists , which is often critical of the nuclear industry , said he had not seen the report and could not comment . During the accident , the worst ever at a U.S. nuclear_power plant , the upper two-thirds of the 12-foot- high reactor core was destroyed when mechanical failure and human error allowed it to lose its cooling shield of water . Over a two-minute period , nearly 20 tons of molten fuel and debris flowed to the vessel ' s bottom . According to a fictional scenario made popular by the movie , &quot; The China Syndrome , &quot; which was playing_at area theaters when the TMI accident occurred , melting nuclear fuel would burn its way through the bottom of anything built to contain it and sink deep into the ground , releasing deadly radiation . A hot spot of more_than 2 # 000 degrees did form in the steel wall at a point where the crust was thin . Previous studies said the heat should have spread to the rest of the vessel and triggered a failure , but the water cooled_it within 30 minutes . Steel melts at 2 # 642 degrees . Scientists had expected the molten mass to sit tightly against the vessel wall and melt through it . &quot; I was personally surprised , &quot; said Mansur A . Alammar , senior engineer for the TMI operating company , GPU Nuclear Corp. , and a chairman of a nuclear industry study group on the accident . &quot; I always predicted vessel failure . Now we see this mechanism. &quot; Even before the new study , scientists believed the &quot; China syndrome &quot; was more Hollywood plot_line than scientific reality . Besides the insulating property of the fuel and the strength of the steel vessel , previous studies had shown the concrete bases on which U.S. reactors are built also would hold_up against melting fuel , Beckjord said . He said scientists will further examine the cooling process and try to determine if it would happen again in another accident . Sholly declined to predict the effect of the report on future reactor designs . But he said some designs already incorporate safeguards that the new study indicates will be effective , such_as putting reactor vessels into cavities that can be completely flooded_in an accident .</TEXT>
