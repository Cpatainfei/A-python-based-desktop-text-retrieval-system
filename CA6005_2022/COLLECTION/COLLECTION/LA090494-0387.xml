   <HEADLINE> CHINA , RUSSIA SETTLE FINAL LAND BORDER DISPUTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> China and Russia settled the last remaining dispute over their 2 # 725-mile land border Saturday and pledged they would no longer aim nuclear missiles or use force against each other . Presidents Jiang Zemin and Boris N . Yeltsin signed the agreements during the first visit here by a Chinese leader since Mao Tse-tung in 1957 , before the Sino-Soviet alliance gave_way to bitter struggle for supremacy in the Communist world . The ceremony marked a further warming in relations that were normalized in 1989 at the initiative of then-Soviet President Mikhail S . Gorbachev and have been marked since by booming two-way trade . Jiang was accorded the rare privilege of staying in the Kremlin . By delineating a 34-mile fragment of their western border , in the Altai Mountains , Russia and China buried a quarrel that led to armed clashes in 1969 . They also agreed to further talks to cut &quot; to a minimum level &quot; the number of troops stationed on each side of the entire frontier . Although Russia and China still dispute three small islands in rivers along their eastern border , Yeltsin called the agreements &quot; an achievement of historic dimensions . . . . For the first time , practically the entire border is legally defined. &quot; Easing conflict with China is important for Russia as it redefines its security_interests . The shrinking army inherited from the Soviet_Union ended a massive retreat from Eastern Europe on Saturday when the last several thousand troops came_home from Germany and the Baltics and marched in Moscow in a festive parade . Peace with China , Russia ' s most powerful neighbor , will enable the retreating army to redeploy largely to the south , to keep ethnic warfare now simmering in former Soviet republics of the Caucasus Mountains and Central Asia from spilling into Russia . The declaration signed by Yeltsin and Jiang pledged never to allow ideology to obstruct Russian-Chinese relations and to stay out of any alliance that would endanger the security of the other . Their agreement on de-targeting missiles is similar to ones Russia signed earlier this year with the United States and Britain . &quot; Autumn is the season of harvest , and in Moscow we have reaped a good crop , &quot; said Jiang , who is spending four days in Moscow . Yeltsin , who went_to Beijing for a previous Russia-China summit in December , 1992 , added : &quot; Our views coincided on all_the issues touched upon in our talks. &quot; The two presidents agreed to boost bilateral trade , which almost doubled in the past three years to a record $ 7.7 billion in 1993 . China is now Russia ' s second-biggest trading partner after Germany . They brushed_aside sharp differences over internal economic reform and closed ranks against critics in the West . China ' s leaders not long ago denounced Yeltsin and Gorbachev as traitors to communism and Russia ' s post-Soviet political reforms as mistaken . Russia ' s democratic politicians have acknowledged the successes of China ' s slower-paced economic reforms while criticizing Beijing ' s rule as repressive . &quot; We pay much attention to studying the experience of economic reforms in China , which launched them earlier than we did , &quot; Yeltsin said . Chinese spokesman Wu Jianmin said the two presidents agreed that &quot; the international community should acknowledge that there is no single pattern for the development of all countries. &quot; Despite appeals from reformist Russian lawmakers to join the West in condemning China ' s harsh treatment of dissidents , there was no mention of human_rights in the presidents ' declaration . &quot; These problems were not discussed at the summit , &quot; Wu said .</TEXT>
