   <HEADLINE> BY A DOCTOR ' S HAND ; THE BABY WAS DYING . DR . EVA CARRIZALES SAYS SHE ONLY TRIED TO EASE THE PARENTS ' PAIN , BUT A GRAND_JURY CALLS HER ACTIONS MURDER , FORCING AN ANGUISHED COMMUNITY TO RE-EXAMINE THE WAY IT TREATS LIFE AND DEATH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In retrospect , Clayton County Medical_Examiner Joe Burton says now , they should have recognized the first call from Southern Regional Medical_Center as a red flag . Hospitals , after all , normally don ' t contact the medical_examiner when a fragile , terminally ill 39-day-old baby dies . In neonatology units , medical staffs regularly walk fine lines , judging whether and when to give_up on such doomed , premature infants , but theirs is a tortuous ethical exercise practiced largely in private , shared only with the infants ' families . It is not the custom of medical staffs to invite county authorities to second-guess them . Yet that was precisely what nurses at Southern Regional appeared to be doing . The first call , at 11:17 on Saturday morning , Oct . 16 , went_to Clayton County Coroner Abb Dickson . He relayed it to the forensic pathologists in Joe Burton ' s office . Whatever nurse Gwen Pierce told Burton ' s staffers , it didn ' t arouse their concerns . Under Georgia law , if a death can reasonably be explained by natural causes , it ' s not for the medical_examiner . Investigator Don Wiegand declined jurisdiction . The hospital persisted , though . At 5:45 p.m. that same day , Nancy Goodrum , Southern Regional ' s vice_president for patient services , called the coroner again . This time the hospital put the_matter more explicitly . Several nurses in the neonatal care unit , Goodrum reported , believed that Dr. Eva Carrizales , the attending neonatologist , had &quot; hastened &quot; a baby ' s death . The baby , who had never left the neo intensive-care unit , was undeniably terminal . But at least two nurses , and possibly a third , said they ' d seen Carrizales &quot; holding the baby ' s mouth shut. &quot; Finally , the medical_examiner ' s office spotted the red flag . Whether the report was true or not , he had to investigate this case , Burton realized . What did they have here ? What they had , Burton in time would reluctantly conclude , was a caring , compassionate doctor so affected by her patients ' suffering that she ' d crossed a forbidden line . What they had , Burton ruled on Nov . 4 , was a homicide . &quot; ' Homicide ' is a term that medical_examiners use in_order to classify a death , &quot; an obviously troubled and ambivalent Burton cautioned in his written report . &quot; It does not imply that there was ' murder. ' &quot; Yes it does , a Clayton County grand_jury decided six days later . Indicting Carrizales on a murder_charge , the grand jurors concluded that the doctor &quot; with malice aforethought did cause the death of Omar Jiminez . . . by asphyxia due_to smothering and neck compression. &quot; The murder indictment of Carrizales has fueled an anguished uproar in this suburban region south of Atlanta . The medical_examiner has cried over his decision ; the district_attorney has prayed . Carrizales has resigned her medical posts , and doctors of all sorts have flinched , thinking_of the difficult , ambiguous situations they face daily . Carrizales ' supporters -- among them parents of her tiny patients , fellow church congregants , colleagues and neighbors -- have marched in rallies , organized fund-raising_campaigns , called television_stations , written letters to the editor . In statements to police_detectives , communications through her lawyers and -- before turning silent -- interviews with journalists , Carrizales herself has insisted she didn ' t cause the baby ' s death . Statements , medical nuances , hidden agendas -- all have been the subject of agitated speculation . So , too , have matters beyond the immediate particulars of Carrizales ' case . How we let people die -- that ' s what this is all about , some of Carrizales ' supporters eventually began to suggest . Isn ' t a dignified , peaceful death better than prolonged , gasping agony ? In the end , the hospital chief who turned her in , the medical_examiner who judged her and the prosecutor who charged her all sound as reluctant to punish Carrizales as do her supporters . But punish her they very well might , for her murder trial looms , and no one feels able to back_down . &quot; I don ' t have a choice , &quot; says Robert Keller , the Clayton County district_attorney . &quot; I would seek another charge if the facts allowed . But the facts don ' t allow. &quot; TWO HOURS AFTER OMAR JIMINEZ ' S DEATH , THE PHONE RANG IN THE home of Southern Regional executive Nancy Goodrum . There ' s a problem here at the hospital , nurse Linda Emerson began . A problem with a baby ' s death . The baby , born by emergency C-section at 27 weeks gestation , weighing under two pounds , had been severely ill with lung and kidney problems . For days , the baby had been judged pre-terminal . But he had kept hanging_on . According to the nurses who were there , Emerson said , sometime early that morning the doctor turned_down the ventilator , then later -- apparently without the usual consultation with other doctors or explicit agreement of the family -- took the baby off the ventilator and all support lines . But the baby would n ' t stop breathing ; for more_than an hour , he kept gasping . In that hour , the nurses believe they saw Carrizales put her hand_over the baby ' s mouth and squeeze the carotid_arteries in his neck . The doctor even told them what she was doing , the nurses claimed . She said she was shutting_off the blood flow to the baby ' s brain . The nurses were very upset , Emerson said . They ' d already placed a standard call to the coroner , reporting a child ' s death . But they thought more should be done . After digesting this report , Goodrum left messages at the hospital ' s law_firm , then drove to the hospital to review the baby ' s chart . By early afternoon , she and a hospital attorney were speaking on a conference_call with Dr. Donald Lackey , the hospital ' s vice_president for medical affairs . Lackey should call Carrizales , the lawyer advised , and point blank ask her three questions : Did she turn the ventilator down ? Did she hold the baby ' s mouth closed ? Did she cut_off the blood flow through the baby ' s carotids ? It was a task Lackey approached with considerable dread . A doctor he knew and cared about might be in_trouble , he realized . So might the hospital , and no hospital needs negative publicity . Lackey hoped to hear a different perspective on this story from Carrizales -- an explanation and a denial . Lackey admired Carrizales . Because his own specialty was newborns , the two occasionally chatted over coffee about the state_of_the_art in their field . The 41-year-old mother of four had been at Southern Regional three years , and he thought her a nice , sensitive person with a good reputation as a doctor . Those more familiar_with Carrizales held even stronger feelings of admiration . She ' d come_out of Mission , Tex. , with her high_school sweetheart , Enrique , she a Mission High cheerleader , he the football_team ' s wide receiver . Mexican Americans from poor families , they ' d married young ; she worked while he earned his architectural degree , then she , in 1982 , earned her medical degree at what is now the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Ft . Worth . After completing a pediatric residency in Texas and , in 1990 , a neonatology fellowship in Michigan , she ' d joined a small practice that provided neonatal services to three Atlanta-area hospitals , including Southern Regional . She ' d just taken her boards and was about to become certified . Their two older daughters were attending the University of Texas , and their two younger children were still at_home . Religious faith formed a central pillar of the Carrizales family ' s life . Every Sunday morning , between the regular services at North Fayette United Methodist_Church , Eva and her husband attended a church discussion group on how to apply their faith to daily life . &quot; I have to pray every hour to be good , &quot; she ' d tell other church_members . &quot; If I can ' t hold_on to God , I ' d lose it. &quot; She was , by most accounts , a compassionate doctor who loved babies . Appreciative mothers would call her at_home , and later , when their babies had grown , drop_by to show_off how they were doing . Carrizales kept photos of her patients and their families on her refrigerator door . In fact , on the Saturday afternoon when Lackey called her , one of those photos pictured Omar Jiminez ' s family -- Omar Jiminez , who ' d died in her arms just hours before . The lawyers had told Lackey he needed to hurry , to get an answer quickly , so he steeled himself . &quot; I need to ask you some questions , &quot; he began . &quot; I need to get some answers , then I need to get_off the phone. &quot; To his hospital colleagues , to the police in oral statements and a signed letter , to the grand_jury and to a journalist , Lackey ' s account of what followed has not varied . Carrizales , he says , &quot; basically affirmed all three points. &quot; Yes , she had turned_down the ventilator . Yes , she had held the baby ' s mouth closed , out of sensitivity to the parents because his features were so distorted by gross swelling . Yes , she had placed her hand on the baby ' s neck to limit the blood supply to the brain . Listening to her , Lackey ' s heart sank . This was not what he ' d wanted to hear . It seemed to him she didn ' t really understand the seriousness of the situation . He sensed she didn ' t see anything wrong . Over the next 24 hours , Lackey would call Carrizales back five times . He would advise her to get a lawyer , and he would refer her to one . He would also , at least as Carrizales recalls it , say , &quot; You should have lied to me. &quot; At this moment , though , Lackey had no time for advice or comfort . &quot; I told her I had to get_off the phone , &quot; he explained . &quot; I said I would call her back. &quot; As both doctor and administrator , Lackey felt torn in several directions . He had good reason . Decisions to take infants off respirators because they are basically dead , because their systems are shutting_down , are made almost daily in neonatal units across the country . But if it is a common business , it is also a tricky business , the subject of continual debate within the medical_community . Technology in recent years has enabled doctors to resuscitate ever smaller and more premature infants . As a result , it has also obliged doctors to withdraw treatment from a growing number of babies who eventually just can ' t survive . Here is where the doctors risk trouble , since the criteria for judging when to give_up remain uncertain , varying widely from hospital to hospital , doctor to doctor . The type of statistical certainty needed for more uniform guidelines just isn ' t attainable . The doctors , in other words , are always facing hard choices and the prospect of censure . More_than a_few neonatologists , discussing decisions they ' ve made , privately say that beyond lawsuits , they fear losing their licenses -- and even more . &quot; What we constantly fear is being charged with murder , &quot; one says . Against this backdrop , the notion of handing Eva Carrizales to the legal authorities felt chilling indeed to Lackey . At the same time , though , Lackey understood why three nurses had come_in tears to their supervisors . What they ' d seen was not in synch with the norm . Southern Regional has procedures to follow before withdrawing support . You don ' t just take babies off ventilators and heart_monitors on_your_own ; you consult with two other doctors , who must see the patient and sign_off . You also consult with the parents and document some sort of agreement , be it oral or written . Carrizales was insisting the prognosis and treatment had been explained to these parents , but at best this point remained unclear , for the parents , from Guadalajara , Mexico , were young , uneducated , bewildered , frightened . The mother had no immigration papers and neither spoke English . Hospital procedures aside , it appeared , at least from the nurses ' statements , that Carrizales might have actively intervened to hasten a death . Doctors don ' t knowingly do that -- especially in front of other people , especially in a hospital neonatal intensive-care unit . Lackey wondered -- had stress caught_up_with Carrizales ? He imagined her frustration over seeing another baby struggling slowly toward an inevitable death . The baby wasn ' t ready to have physiology take_over , the parents were present , and she lost_it . Eva Carrizales was sensitive , caring , nice -- what else could it be ? In the end , he didn ' t know what she was thinking . He only knew -- or thought he knew -- what she did . In a series of conference_calls that Saturday afternoon , the hospital administrators and lawyers considered their options . They could not , they soon decided , keep this to themselves . In 1989 , they ' d tried just that , to a disastrous end . A man who ' d come_into the emergency_room , a stabbing victim , had died in surgery . The hospital administrator had actually hung_up on reporters raising quality-of-care issues , generating a lot of bad publicity . Many of the doctors would n ' t like it ; many would prefer review by peers rather than by cops and lawyers . But Lackey felt Nancy Goodrum had to call the coroner back . &quot; Peer_review would n ' t come for days after , &quot; Lackey explained later . &quot; What were we going_to do with the baby ? Just hold it until then ? Once Dr. Carrizales says yes , she did_it , then we ' re legally obligated to call the authorities. &quot; Just as Lackey expected , many doctors at Southern Regional vigorously objected . The nurses were confused , they argued , the nurses misunderstood the situation . &quot; Where was_due process , where was peer_review ? &quot; demanded one doctor , pounding the table at a staff meeting the following week . Two days after Goodrum contacted the coroner and medical_examiner , Carrizales ' colleagues in fact did conduct a peer_review . Focusing_on the medical rather than legal dimension of Carrizales ' actions , they concluded that the care of this baby had not been &quot; below standards. &quot; By then , however , it no longer mattered what a hospital peer_review board thought_about Eva Carrizales ' conduct . By then , Clayton County police_detectives had spent the weekend at Southern Regional combing through files and interviewing nurses . By then , the death of a frail baby in a neonatal unit was a matter_to be judged not in the medical_community , but in a court of law -- and in the court of public_opinion . An autopsy of baby Jiminez conducted a day after his death revealed just how ill the infant had been in his last hours . Among other ailments , he suffered from masses of inflamed and infected tissue in the brain , severe and late-stage broncho-pulmonary abnormalities , extensive fungal_infection of the kidneys , liver congestion and spleen congestion . What the autopsy did not reveal was any physical evidence of suffocation . There were no bruises on the neck or other proof that Carrizales had smothered the baby . So Joe Burton , a 49-year-old forensic pathologist who provides medical-examiner services to five counties in the greater Atlanta area , turned_to what evidence he did have . For days , he studied the police reports , medical_reports and statements provided to investigators at the hospital . Drawing mainly from the nurses ' accounts , he pieced together something of a chronology . The severely ill newborn , Burton saw , entered the Southern Regional neonatal intensive-care unit on Sept . 13 . Within days , the baby developed a septic infection , then kidney problems . Doctors vainly tried to wean him off a respirator . At 1 month , his kidneys began failing , his heart_rate soaring . Through interpreters , the parents , Guadalupe Jiminez , 22 , and Jesus Covarubias , 24 , were made aware of their baby ' s poor prognosis . Precisely what they were told , though , and how they responded , remained somewhat unclear . One early press report had the mother , through an interpreter , quoting the father as saying the baby ' s death was inevitable , and that if the doctor did end the baby ' s life , she was &quot; doing them a favor. &quot; A later press report had the mother telling an interpreter she felt &quot; the doctor did something wrong &quot; and the father declaring &quot; she ' s not God . . . . It ' s not good because no one can do God ' s job. &quot; All Burton finally could rely_on were the parents ' statements to the police . Those statements indicated that neither parent knew &quot; for_sure &quot; that the doctor was going_to disconnect life support . No one , they said , directly discussed this with them , nor did they sign any documents . They did assume Carrizales knew what was best for their child , and they did know the baby was not expected to live . On Oct . 15 , the baby ' s kidneys virtually stopped functioning . After midnight , his respiratory function began to deteriorate . By early morning , his blood gases showed high carbon_dioxide and low oxygen levels . It was &quot; after the 4:30 a.m. time &quot; on Oct . 16 , Burton would later write , &quot; that the complicated clinical scenario begins to develop with this infant. &quot; That was when nurse Maritza Vias began pumping 100 % oxygen to the baby through a face_mask and notified Carrizales about the poor blood-gas readings . By then , nurses were using suction to clean large amounts of thick , white secretions from the baby and the ventilator tube . According to Vias ' statement , when Carrizales entered the room minutes later , she ordered the nurse to stop the suctioning . Then , at 4:45 a.m. , Carrizales ordered Versed , a narcotic sedative , be given intravenously . She also , according to Vias , turned_down the ventilator pressure rate to a setting of 3 . Mulling_over that ventilator setting and sedative , Burton couldn ' t help but wonder whether Carrizales had in fact precipitated this baby ' s decline . Some neonatologists , after all , would suggest that setting the ventilator to 3 and giving Versed was tantamount_to saying , &quot; You ' re on_your_own , but this won ' t hurt. &quot; The baby ' s parents , Burton saw from the nurse ' s notes , were called to the hospital shortly before 5 a.m. At 5:15 , the mother said she wanted to hold her baby . Carrizales responded by disconnecting the ventilator as well as the various lines that deliver nutrients and monitor blood gases , then handed the baby to his mother as nurses again gave him oxygen through a mask . Moments later , the baby ' s heart_rate plummeted ; the alarm rang on the heart_monitor . According to the nurses ' statements and notes , Carrizales turned_off the monitor and ordered Epinephrine , a heart and nerve stimulant . Eight to 10 minutes later , Carrizales took the baby from the mother and placed him in a radiant warmer as she directed the parents to the family_room . For several minutes , she tried chest compressions . Then she stopped and told Vias to take_away the oxygen_mask . Cradling the baby in her arms , Carrizales sat_down in a wooden rocking_chair in one corner of the neonatal intensive-care unit . The baby , according to the nurses , was gasping and still had an apparent heart_rate . Carrizales rocked and cradled the baby , checking his heart_rate every five or six minutes . According to two nurses , Carrizales during this time &quot; was holding the baby ' s mouth closed. &quot; According to Vias , Carrizales at one point said she was glad she was_on duty and not her partner , because he would have kept the baby on the ventilator until Monday . At 6:15 , Carrizales gave the baby to Vias and went_to talk to the parents . Detecting a breath and heart_rate , Vias told Carrizales upon her return : &quot; This baby is breathing. &quot; Carrizales took the baby back and -- as Burton put it in his written report -- &quot; is alleged to have said something to the effect , ' Don ' t let the baby breathe. ' &quot; Breathe he did , though ; the minutes stretched on . At 6:45 , when nurse Rebekah Martin replaced Vias , they noted that Carrizales was still cradling and rocking the gasping baby as she sat in the rocking chair . They saw no ventilators , no oxygen tubes , no monitors , no invasive support lines . &quot; He still has a faint heart sound , &quot; Carrizales murmured . At 7:15 , nurses again took the baby to the parents ; they or the doctor apparently believed him dead . As the parents were holding him in a private family_room , the baby apparently moved and gasped . Rosaura Martens , a family friend and translator , came running to the nurses , yelling , &quot; The baby ' s alive , it ' s a miracle. &quot; According to Martens , Carrizales responded by saying this was why she didn ' t want the parents to hold the baby -- &quot; because they would think it would live. &quot; According to nurse Martin , Carrizales took the baby back and once more began cradling and rocking him , saying she was &quot; holding the baby in such a way as_to cut_off the blood flow to the brain so that this won ' t drag_on . . . . The parents have been through enough , and this could last for days . . . . &quot; This comment , Martin told the police , so horrified and distressed her , she changed the subject . She could not , she told the police , actually see where the doctor ' s hands were . At 7:50 , a priest came_to be with the parents . At 8 , the baby was very &quot; dusky , &quot; with only a minimal heart_rate and an occasional gasp . At 8:10 , he was still gasping occasionally , but had no audible heartbeat . At 8:13 , Carrizales pronounced Omar dead . She was at the end still cradling and rocking the tiny , doomed infant . That , at least , was the sequence of events suggested by Burton ' s reading of the nurses ' statements and notes . When Burton turned_to Clayton County Police Detective Mark McGann ' s interview with Carrizales , he found an alternative version . McGann had reached the hospital at 9:30 that first night , some 13 hours after the baby ' s death . First he ' d heard a summary of the nurses ' accounts from a hospital administrator . Then , nearing midnight , Carrizales had passed word to him : If you want to talk to me , let ' s do_it now . She wanted to get home . The doctor ' s manner , McGann would later say , was flat and unemotional . She was direct , unguarded , sure of herself -- and , in a way , utterly unsophisticated . McGann had read her the Miranda rights , but near the end of a one-hour interview , sitting in the presence of three police_officers , she ' d still asked , &quot; Is this a police matter ? &quot; McGann had been surprised that she was willing to talk , that she had actually initiated the interview . Other doctors in this situation would have seen danger , he felt . Other doctors would have said -- whoa , need a lawyer . Instead , Carrizales had said , over and over : &quot; This baby was terminal . . . . This baby was going_to die. &quot; In his written report , Burton later summarized Detective McGann ' s account of his interview with Carrizales : &quot; Dr. Carrizales states that the infant was dying and she did not institute a no-code order because she felt the infant was going_to die on its own and would not have to require a withdrawal of life support . . . . Dr. Carrizales states that she was holding the mouth closed_in order to keep the family from seeing the distorted features , that the baby was markedly swollen , oozing fluids , and she was doing_it out of sensitivity to the parents . Her notes do also reflect that she placed her hand_over both sides of the neck . She states that she did this in_order to see if the heart was pumping blood up the carotids . She states that she may have made some statement to the nurses about something like this procedure could cut_off the flow of blood to the brain but she states that there really wasn ' t any flow to cut_off at that time . &quot; Dr. Carrizales states further that many dying infants . . . have episodes in which their heart_rate increases , decreases , and that they have spontaneous respiration and that this is primarily reflex and not consistent with the infant actually being alive . Such activity can go_on for hours . She states that the heart_rate that she was obtaining during the time she was rocking the infant was approximately five beats per minute and sometimes even slower . Dr. Carrizales admits that she did not follow hospital procedure in removing life support but states that this was the custom where she was trained in_order to facilitate the sensitivity of a dying infant and his bonding with the family into the procedure more smoothly . Dr. Carrizales says that the infant had polycystic kidneys and was markedly bloated with fluid and had no chance to live. &quot; What to make of all this ? Burton wondered when he ' d finished reviewing the file . The medical_examiner couldn ' t help but wonder whether any of the nurses held a grudge against Carrizales . There ' s a high stress level in neonatal units , after all , with lots of emotions , lots of decisions , lots of medical ups and downs . There are also lots of cases like this one , Burton believed ; he just didn ' t usually hear about them . Why this one ? One of the three nurses , according to the police report , had in fact complained about Carrizales once before . Nurse Terry Marin thought the doctor hadn ' t properly consulted others before disconnecting the respirator to a very premature , hours-old newborn . So perhaps there was some ill feeling between them . Still , the nurses seemed to Burton genuinely upset with what they ' d seen . They were shocked , particularly by the doctor ' s comments . that ' s what set this case apart . We couldn ' t believe she was doing_it , the nurses kept saying to McGann . We couldn ' t believe she was telling us she was doing_it . Burton could see it both ways . Part of him sort of agreed with what he thought Carrizales had done . This baby , born 10 years ago , would not have lived at all . But part of him could not go_along with it , especially the way she did_it . Of course , it was not up_to Burton to make value judgments . He had a role . His task was to determine how this baby died . So he tried to look_at the facts : This infant had multi-system organ problems , was septic , had kidney_failure and significant pathology of the brain . It was almost certain that even with maintenance of life support , this infant would have died . When , though ? Medical_records and nurses ' statements suggested that once the ventilator had been turned_down and later disconnected , and once fluids had been discontinued , the infant deteriorated markedly from his already critical condition . Had these measures been continued , it was virtually certain the infant still would have died . But removing them accelerated the process . That was the issue for him , Burton felt : whether or not the infant died on its own or whether the death was facilitated by another . Carrizales insisted that for all practical purposes the infant was dead , so anything she may have done_in no way affected the outcome . Burton saw it differently . To him , an infant with gasping respirations and a detectable heart_rate can ' t technically be declared dead , not unless you can show he had no brain_waves . It was obvious to Burton that Carrizales had shown humanitarian care , concern and love for this dying infant . Possibly it was because of her deep concern for the infant that she did her best to facilitate its death . Facilitate she had , though , Burton believed . To him , at least , the evidence clearly demonstrated that by holding the infant ' s mouth closed and pressing the carotids , she had hastened the end of cerebral activity , even if that activity had been merely reflexive . She had , in_essence , entered into the physiological happenings that resulted in this infant ' s death . On more_than one night , Burton would later say , he lay_awake over this case . He also conferred_with the prosecutors , the police_detectives , other doctors and half_a_dozen forensic investigators . One morning , when he and his colleagues staged their own mock grand_jury , Burton was the only person who said he might not vote to indict her . But in the end , as he put it later , he decided &quot; I had to speak_for the truth. &quot; If he was going_to do his job honestly , he couldn ' t back_down . What would that mean for the next hard case ? Where would it stop ? Yes , his judgment was based almost entirely on witnesses , not on hard medical evidence , not on anything from the autopsy . But bottom_line , he just could not misbelieve so many witnesses . &quot; A homicide means that an action of another individual contributed to or caused the death of another , &quot; he wrote in his report . &quot; It does not imply that there was ' murder. ' Murder is more of a legal term . I do not feel that we can classify this death as a natural death . . . . Had Dr. Carrizales not held the mouth shut , not held her hands in any way around the neck , and only had the infant off of life support , it is probable that death would have ensued , possibly within minutes of when it actually occurred . ( But ) I have no way of knowing for_sure , nor does anyone else on this Earth have any way of knowing for_sure exactly how long this infant may have continued to have gasping respirations and a slow or agonal ( death agony ) heartbeat . . . . In trying to be fair . . . I have no choice . . . other_than to sign the case out as I have done . I have listed the cause of death as asphyxia , due_to smothering and neck compression . . . . &quot; In the days following Joe Burton ' s ruling , a small army of Carrizales ' shocked supporters rose to her defense . A dozen parents called the Atlanta Journal-Constitution within the first 24 hours alone to tell how she had saved their babies ' lives . Others marched in demonstrations outside Southern Regional , wrote letters to the editor , phoned the television_stations . Members of Carrizales ' church organized a fund-raising_campaign directed at the Georgia medical_community . A good number thought it important to document Carrizales ' record as a heroic and compassionate doctor . &quot; The first month of our grandson ' s life , we didn ' t think he would live , &quot; Judith Evans of Fayetteville wrote in a letter to the editor . &quot; But Dr. Eva Carrizales gave him the same care and attention as the other babies . . . . When Thomas went_home , Carrizales gave us her phone_number and told us to call anytime we needed her . We need more doctors like Eva Carrizales. &quot; Others thought it relevant to ask why Carrizales had been singled_out and turned_in by her nurses and hospital . This whole_thing began , they suggested , because of &quot; personality conflicts &quot; between Carrizales and the nurses . Carrizales was a &quot; serious doctor &quot; and &quot; not gregarious. &quot; In fact , she was &quot; abrasive &quot; and &quot; assertive &quot; and &quot; distant &quot; at times . She wasn ' t &quot; touchy-feely. &quot; She didn ' t ask nurses , she told nurses . She was not the nurses ' buddy . Men like that , her supporters observed , are called &quot; aggressive &quot; ; women like that are called &quot; bitches. &quot; &quot; Usually a male doctor is in_charge , &quot; said Dr. Beth Killebrew , an obstetrician who belongs_to Carrizales ' church . &quot; that ' s what this is about . A female doctor has to be different than a male . Women don ' t like being bossed by another woman . She has to get nurses to be partners . She can ' t just give orders. &quot; At least a_few , among them members of the medical_community in the greater Atlanta area , felt inclined to question the medical_examiner ' s methods and conclusions . Burton was no stranger to such controversy . Well before the Carrizales case , he ' d aroused animosity among other doctors . Part of the bad feeling derived from Burton ' s perceived willingness to testify about what highly trained specialists should or should not do ; part derived from his perceived willingness to &quot; follow the money &quot; and testify for the defense as well as the prosecution ; part derived from the fact that Burton hadn ' t passed all_the exams required to be a board-certified forensic pathologist . None of these matters , however , agitated the medical_community as much as his report on Carrizales . Burton ' s conclusions are based on possibly unreliable witnesses ' statements , not hard scientific evidence , complained experts such_as Kris Sperry , the deputy medical_examiner in Fulton County ( Atlanta ) . The autopsy yielded no evidence of suffocation , no bruises on the neck , nothing . Even if Carrizales had applied pressure to the carotid_arteries , you couldn ' t say for_sure this had hastened death ; babies ' brains were much more resilient to blood-flow interruptions than adults ' . Nor could you make much of the gasps and lingering heartbeat ; newborns , being very primitive organisms , have a propensity for involuntary brain-stem reflexes . &quot; It looks_like , oh my God , the baby is trying to breathe , &quot; Sperry said . &quot; But no , it ' s just muscles firing . I think Dr. Carrizales , because involuntary_muscle reflex is so disturbing , wanted to hold the baby until it stopped , so she then could hand him to the mother still , without this twitching . This is not unreasonable . I ' ve seen it myself , and it ' s not pleasant to see . It can be devastating. &quot; Whatever the merits or flaws of these various arguments and objections , it eventually became clear that there was something else , as well , driving many of those who ' d risen to defend Carrizales . The doctor ' s indictment had aroused , in all sorts of people , certain instinctive and heartfelt attitudes toward death . Over and over , discussions here in Georgia about the Carrizales case have ended_up focusing mainly on questions of how to let_go_of the dying . &quot; Eva is real big on dignity in dying , on holding and rocking rather than hooking to machines and reading gauges , &quot; said Heidi Cornutt , a mother of four and a member of Carrizales ' church discussion group , when asked about the murder_charge . &quot; I didn ' t realize she was a doctor when she told me how she ' d held a dying baby . I thought she was a nurse , because I didn ' t think_of doctors doing that. &quot; &quot; How we play_out death is related to how we understand the idea of life , &quot; said Cheryl Maxfield , the associate pastor at Carrizales ' church , who also wrote a letter to the Journal-Constitution ' s editor . &quot; An understanding of an afterlife , which for Eva is very real , means death is not a failure . . . . There are many debates raging about the proper way to deal with death in our culture and society . . . . What is really on_trial here is a society and a theology trying to decide how we deal with the art of healing and the reality of death. &quot; One Saturday morning , 16 members of Carrizales ' Sunday discussion group gathered at their church to discuss these matters and the doctor ' s situation . Eva Carrizales ' journey from an impoverished Texas background has brought her deep into the affluent baby_boomer culture . There were , among this church gathering of her supporters , an insurance_agent , an attorney , an accountant , two doctors , a mechanical_engineer , a metallurgist , an airline pilot , a funeral_director and several who called themselves stay-at-home moms . At first , they mainly expressed disbelief about the charge . &quot; What she ' s accused of is anathema to her , to what she is , &quot; said Killebrew . &quot; That she ' d be accused of this doesn ' t fit . She would lay_down her life for babies. &quot; As the morning stretched on , though , the church group gradually , hesitantly , began saying that even if Carrizales had hastened a dying baby ' s death , they felt comfortable about it and supported her . &quot; I would n ' t hold it against her. &quot; &quot; What is death ? Maybe that baby was dead , just gasping . Maybe Eva just stopped a reflexive involuntary reflex. &quot; &quot; What Eva did is what a committee ' s do-not-resuscitate order would do . Knowing Eva , I have confidence in what she decided. &quot; &quot; Eva would never do anything to harm a baby if maybe it would live. &quot; &quot; It would be different if it were a 5-year-old. &quot; &quot; It would be different if there ' d been a 50-50 chance . But the baby was going_to die within five minutes. &quot; In time , the group began directing its fire at those who ' d turned_on Carrizales . &quot; Nobody disagrees the baby was terminal , &quot; said Killebrew . &quot; Why spend all this money and time over a fine line ? It drives me up a tree. &quot; &quot; I feel she ' s being thrown to the wolves , &quot; said Donald Harper , a Delta Airlines pilot . &quot; The big thing is , you need to support your doctors . Why did the hospital turn her in ? &quot; &quot; Who is qualified to determine death in our society ? &quot; asked Associate Pastor Maxfield . &quot; Is the legal_community ? Or is the doctor ? that ' s the question . Are we going_to let policemen decide who is dead , and when ? Who is to decide ? &quot; Not until the meeting was drawing to an end did_it emerge that no one there , despite their passionate sincerity , had actually read the medical_examiner ' s report . &quot; I only briefly looked_at it , &quot; said Killebrew . &quot; It was too_much , too emotional for me . It was all a blur . I know this woman , know her character , know who she is . Whatever happened , it was right . I don ' t believe Eva smothered this baby , that she put a hand_over his mouth . She just would n ' t do that . She would n ' t do that. &quot; Killebrew paused , looked down , considered . &quot; It ' s all based on Eva ' s character , &quot; she finally said . &quot; Most people don ' t know the details of the story. &quot; s much as he might have liked to , Clayton County Dist . Atty . Robert Keller could not so readily avoid the medical_examiner ' s report . By calling the baby ' s death a homicide , Joe Burton more or less had backed the prosecutor into a corner . &quot; I didn ' t have a choice , &quot; Keller said . &quot; Joe had a harder choice . The key for me was Burton and what he decided . If he says homicide , I have to act. &quot; Additional impetus came soon after , when Keller learned of the questionable death of another baby under Carrizales ' care . In this incident , in June , 1993 , at nearby Henry General Hospital , Carrizales reportedly gave a severely premature_baby girl with a failing heart_rate a potentially dangerous straight shot of potassium chloride , rather than drip it in slowly , as is standard . This episode hadn ' t been reported at the time ; only in the wake of the Southern Regional case were authorities hearing about it and investigating . Joe Burton wasn ' t saying Carrizales had deliberately done anything to cause this death , but in witnesses ' accounts of Carrizales ' comments and conduct at Henry General , Burton did think he saw a &quot; pattern of response &quot; that gave him &quot; considerable concern. &quot; All the same , Keller approached the Southern General case with much reluctance . Here was one of the most treacherous issues he ' d faced in his 16 years as district_attorney , and here also was something of a personal issue . His brother was a doctor -- and a close friend of Eva Carrizales . Keller himself knew Carrizales well enough to have greeted her , at times in the past , with a hug . Inevitably , he found himself discussing this doctor ' s case with his family . &quot; I prayed over what to do , &quot; Keller said . &quot; I felt I represented Dr. Carrizales as much as anyone . How should we respond ? &quot; Keller eventually fixed on a highly unusual plan . Instead of issuing an arrest_warrant , he would hand the_matter to a grand_jury -- and he would let this grand_jury hear witnesses for the defense as well as the prosecution . Keller had never done this before ; grand_juries usually hear only the prosecution ' s case . But Keller wanted this one to hear everything available , including Carrizales and her neonatology experts . They could all say whatever they wanted . If someone was going_to put a murder tag_on this one , Keller reasoned , it had to be the grand_jury , not him . But maybe they would n ' t . If he allowed the defense witnesses , the doctor just might not be indicted . That plainly was the hope of the dozen mothers marching outside the Clayton County_Courthouse in Jonesboro on the morning of Nov . 10 , carrying placards with messages such_as &quot; Dr. Carrizales Saves Babies Lives . . . Doesn ' t Kill Them &quot; and &quot; Thank You for My Little Miracle. &quot; Some held_up their children , all onetime patients_of Carrizales . As she passed_by them and a gaggle of journalists on her way to testify before the grand_jury , Carrizales flashed a &quot; V &quot; for victory sign . An hour later , having told her story without a defense_attorney present -- Keller would n ' t violate that grand_jury custom -- Carrizales left the courthouse smiling . &quot; It was great , &quot; she told reporters . &quot; I love the baby . I have no problems with any of the nurses . I know that they had some concerns , some misconceptions . But it ' s all understandable . I just want to let baby Jiminez rest in peace . God bless us. &quot; Following her to the stand were six respected neonatologists and pathologists called_for the defense , among them the Fulton County deputy medical_examiner , Kris Sperry . None of the experts endorsed the notion of mercy_killing or &quot; facilitating &quot; a death . Instead , despite some differences , they basically focused_on the lack of hard scientific evidence . From his standpoint as a board-certified forensic pathologist , Sperry told the grand jurors , all he could say reliably was that the manner of death was &quot; undetermined. &quot; To say more , he ' d have to depend_on the nurses ' observations and interpretations , which would require making &quot; a personal value judgment &quot; that didn ' t fit with a scientific report . &quot; I can ' t sew moonbeams together to get an answer , &quot; Sperry observed . It is hard to say why none of this had much effect on the grand jurors . Perhaps Keller ' s question -- &quot; Then why did she do_it , and say she did_it ? &quot; -- had an impact . Perhaps it was Burton ' s response -- &quot; I bet he would n ' t let me occlude his baby ' s carotids &quot; -- when a pathologist suggested Carrizales ' actions didn ' t kill the baby . Perhaps it was the unexpected revelation from a nurse at Henry General Hospital , who testified that Carrizales , while working with her there one evening , talked openly about baby Jiminez living for 20 minutes after she ' d blocked the flow of blood to his brain . Whatever the mix of reasons , the grand jurors , after listening to 18 witnesses over a stretch of 12 hours , needed only 20 minutes to deliberate . Shortly after 10 p.m. , apparently free from the tortured ambivalence surrounding them , the grand jurors voted to indict Carrizales on the charge of murder &quot; with malice aforethought. &quot; This was not the outcome anticipated by Keller and Burton . They thought the defense witnesses had persuaded the grand jurors . &quot; The district_attorney gave the grand_jury every option he could to not indict , &quot; Burton said later . &quot; I was surprised when the grand_jury indicted her . I did not expect it. &quot; The next afternoon , Carrizales turned herself in at the Clayton County Detention Facility . After she posted a $ 10 # 000 bond , authorities let her go_home . A VAGUE UNEASE NOW COLORS the conversations of those who have brought Carrizales to account . Few appear comfortable with what has happened . Phone_calls of inquiry are answered cautiously and only after much prodding . &quot; We had to do our jobs , &quot; says Maj . Frank Horgan of the Clayton County Police . &quot; We normally have a feeling of accomplishment , &quot; says Capt . Joe Reynolds , shaking his head . &quot; Maybe it ' s a little less so in this case . There are no bad_guys here. &quot; The Southern Regional medical director , Donald Lackey , feels a particular regret . &quot; I wish I didn ' t have to be a witness at the trial , &quot; he says . &quot; My testimony helped form the grand_jury ' s decision . Dr. Carrizales could lose her license and go_to jail for an act that doesn ' t deserve this kind of penalty . But I don ' t know what else to do . I have to give a truthful answer . If the district_attorney asks me on the stand , I ' d tell them I wish we didn ' t have to punish her. &quot; Punish her they already have , however , a circumstance hard for them to ignore . In the days following her indictment , Carrizales rather publicly struggled with a self-destructive fit of depression . She told her husband to kill her in_order to cash_in a life_insurance policy and put her out of her misery . She visited a psychiatrist . And she , with her husband , spoke unguardedly about all this to an Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter who visited her home . &quot; This is what I did , &quot; she said while holding her forefinger and middle_finger to the neck of the reporter , pressing firmly . &quot; I love babies . . . . It ' s been a tremendous tragedy for my family. &quot; The Carrizales family ' s financial ruin has been equally apparent . The doctor lost her reported annual income of $ 250 # 000 when she resigned her positions days after baby Jiminez ' s death . Later , her husband , saying he was too distracted to continue as a self-employed architect , began pumping gas evenings at a convenience_store . With legal_fees already reaching $ 100 # 000 -- in January , Carrizales retained Georgia ' s most renowned criminal defense_attorney , Bobby Lee Cook -- the Carrizales ' two older daughters had to leave the University of Texas . In February , the lender foreclosed on their Fayette County home , forcing them to move_out . If these signs of the Carrizales ' downfall were not discomfiting enough , there were also the reports of the doctor ' s present activities to consider . Her church friends report she spends much time in downtown Atlanta , caring for the homeless and hungry , visiting prisoners , helping AIDs patients . Often she can be found at the Indian Health Service , where she plans to work &quot; when this is over , &quot; and at the Trinity Soup_Kitchen . &quot; She walks the streets and goes places where we won ' t go , &quot; says Beth Killebrew . &quot; She does what we all say we will or should do. &quot; Monitoring these recurring reports of Carrizales ' fate and her supporters ' moods , Keller and Burton grapple still for a just response . Guilt and discomfort linger -- but so , too , does an unwillingness to ignore precisely what happened at Southern General -- and , for that matter , at Henry General . Bob Keller wishes everyone involved could at least address openly the fundamental issues raised by Carrizales ' apparent conduct and , particularly , her comments . If such cases do happen all_the time , if doctors always walk these fine lines , if doctors regularly make subjective judgments , if doctors do often prolong the death process pointlessly , if doctors should treat death differently -- let ' s talk_about it . &quot; Why not just say , yes , I did_it ? &quot; Keller asked . &quot; Why not say yes , the baby can ' t consent , the parents are incapable , so yes , I did_it . I did_it then , I ' d do_it tomorrow , I ' d do_it again and again and again. &quot; As Keller offered that thought one morning , he half rose from his chair , his fist pounding the desk in frustration . Some 13 weeks had passed since Carrizales ' indictment , and the district_attorney had not yet gotten_around_to arranging the doctor ' s arraignment ( and would not for four more months ) . He appeared in even less of a rush to schedule a trial . Keller spoke almost wistfully about the unlikely prospect of a plea bargain , something Carrizales ' lawyers flatly reject . &quot; Why won ' t they consider a voluntary manslaughter charge ? &quot; he asked , standing now and leaning forward over his desk . &quot; You could say it was an emotional moment ; you could offer probation . I ' m not offering , but I wonder . Ask her lawyers . Ask her lawyers why they won ' t consider that. &quot; Keller kept talking as he began to pace his office . &quot; I ' m convinced her motive was to end suffering , &quot; he said . &quot; But the family was not consulted . Does she have a right to do that ? How do you translate that into a verdict ? Into a sentence ? You could argue the motive was compassionate . If so , what does_it mean ? Does mercy killing equal murder ? &quot; Thinking of the coming trial , the unscheduled but unavoidable trial , Keller answered his own question . &quot; That , &quot; he said , &quot; is what we ' re going to find out. &quot;</TEXT>
