   <HEADLINE> JUBILEE CALLED THE TRUE ' INDEPENDENCE_DAY ' FOR BLACKS ; CELEBRATIONS : EVENT MARKS THE SIGNING THAT ENDED SLAVERY . NAACP LEADER SAYS THE DOCUMENT OF 1776 ' DIDN ' T HAVE OUR NAME ON IT. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For African Americans who observe it , Jubilee Day is Independence_Day , commemorating Jan . 1 , 1863 , when President Abraham_Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation , the document that freed the slaves . Dr. Benjamin F . Chavis Jr. , executive_director of the NAACP , which created the holiday about 15 years ago , hammered home that point Sunday as he spoke_to a group of about 75 people who attended the 15th annual Jubilee Day celebration at the Greater Community Missionary Baptist_Church . &quot; It is our Declaration_of_Independence , &quot; said Chavis . &quot; The one done_up in 1776 didn ' t have our name on it , &quot; he said . For community activist Ted Minor , such celebrations are instrumental in instilling pride among a_people whose contributions have been largely ignored in the nation ' s history books . &quot; It helps to give us and our children a sense of personal dignity , and it helps further our culture and heritage , &quot; said Minor , who donned a green dashiki for the event . Chavis ' comments came_after an arm-waving revival-like service at the small , stucco church tucked into the 11000 block of Norris Avenue in the heart of an African-American community . Chavis , who took_over the leadership from Dr. Benjamin Hooks last April , challenged religious_leaders and their congregations to carry the concepts of unity and brotherhood outside the church and into the streets as a method for curing social ills and furthering economic empowerment . &quot; We have to leave a legacy for our young people to take_hold , &quot; he told the crowd . &quot; We have to lift them up because if we don ' t , who will ? &quot; he asked . &quot; If you take_for granted your progress , you will lose_it , &quot; he warned . &quot; If you take_for granted your life , you ' ll lose it. &quot; Chavis also prodded the congregation to take greater responsibility for its neighborhoods and its children . He said they used to be a community responsibility but are now often left on_their_own in neighborhoods rocked by violence and drugs . &quot; A lot of times things don ' t happen in our community because we ' re waiting for someone else , &quot; he said . &quot; We have to take the initiative. &quot; He endorsed projects that encourage people to turn_in guns and urged citizens to come_to the aid of the vast majority of young African Americans who are not connected with gangs . Flanked by church leaders and local NAACP leaders , Chavis said he wants to use the network of more_than 2 # 300 branch offices around the nation to broadcast a message about economic empowerment and cultural values to African Americans . &quot; There are groups who ' ve come here since the Emancipation Proclamation and they ' re participating in our economy , &quot; said Chavis . Under such a system , establishment of African American financial_institutions would provide a solid base for business ventures and mainstream economic participation , he said . The first_step of the organization ' s economic push for blacks was seen in the &quot; fair share &quot; agreements of the early 1980s , contracts between the civil_rights group and U.S. corporations to increase employment opportunities for African Americans . &quot; In the 1950s , it was enough just to get a job -- we didn ' t care where , &quot; said William Gibson , chairman of the NAACP board of directors . &quot; But like anything else , our organization has evolved and matured , and today when I talk to a CEO about jobs , I ' m not just talking_about clerical work anymore , &quot; Gibson said . Chavis and other top NAACP officials are in Los Angeles for the taping of the 27th annual Image Awards , which are held to recognize achievements by African Americans in the entertainment_industry . Chavis and other officials had spent Sunday morning at the historic Second Baptist_Church in South-Central Los Angeles .</TEXT>
