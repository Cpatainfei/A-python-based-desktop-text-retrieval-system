   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 : 4 DAYS AND COUNTING ; COLOR HIM ENTERTAINING ; THE OUTLANDISH STYLE OF GOALKEEPER JORGE CAMPOS ADDS FLAIR TO THE GAME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the United Soccerphobes of America hunker_down behind their living_room sofas , bracing themselves for a month-long onslaught of strange foreigners with no last_names , 0-0 ties and a sport that strikes them as nothing more_than 90 minutes of foreplay before the riot , an icebreaker has been sent north across the border . His name is Jorge Campos , and he shouldn ' t be hard to spot . He will be the one in the phosphorescent orange togs splashed with yellow , green and purple zig-zagging stripes . Or in the neon lime with the lavender and canary argyle . Or in the hot pink with swirling pools of gold , violet and chartreuse , appearing to be part jockey , part Disney character , part Jell-O dessert . He will also be tending goal for Mexico ' s World Cup team . Occasionally . Most of the time , he will be running laps around Mexico ' s half of the field , jogging from the goal mouth to the midfield line and sprinting back again , darting out of the box to sweep the ball out_to the flank , dashing madly to tackle the ball with a perfect figure-4 slide , chasing down a retreating opponent and barking at him like a laughing hyena -- sometimes all within the same minute . Soccer , sedative of the masses ? Not the way Campos has taken it and run . He is the official party_favor of the 1994 World Cup , a sparking pinwheel on Cinco de Mayo , your non-boredom guarantee every time Mexico steps onto the field during the tournament to come . What in the world will Campos do next ? Freelance Mexico all_the way into the Cup semifinals ? Score a goal on an end-to-end 11-on-10 attack ? Stray one step too far , let a loose ball skitter past him into the net and watch Mexico go_down in flames in the first round ? No one has a clue , and that ' s the beauty of Campos ' game . Half the soccer world_views him as an improvisational genius who is revolutionizing the sport with every step he takes . The other half think he ' s stark raving loco . But , from one moment to the next , neither half can be totally sure . Campos , a former surfer from Acapulco , now participates in a sport where he supplies the waves . He can take your basic 1-0 yawner and make_it pulse with excitement , much as he did on June 4 at the Rose Bowl , Mexico versus the United States in a World Cup tuneup . Campos strode onto the grass wearing a florescent orange ensemble strewn with wild geometric patterns , a little something he had thrown_together for the occasion . He looked_like a traffic cone . The crowd gasped with delight and up in the press_box , someone deadpanned , &quot; Darn , I almost wore the same outfit today. &quot; The game began to the killer-bee buzz of several thousand airhorns , and soon , the overwhelmingly pro-Mexico crowd was chanting their hero ' s name . HORRR-HAY ! HORRR-HAY ! Campos took his place in front of the Mexican goal , but not for long . It was showtime . Saturday afternoon at the Improv . As teammates mounted a rush into U.S. territory , Campos began to roam -- first out of the box , then past the penalty area , then finally all_the way to the midfield circle , where he could get a better view of the action . The ball turns_over and Campos hurries back to the goal mouth , mainly for appearance ' s sake . An attacker dribbles down the right flank , readying for a crossing pass -- Campos darts 20 yards out of the box to sweep the ball away . Another U.S. pass is squirted left to right in front of the box . Caught out of position , Campos catches_up to the striker with a full-on sprint and kicks the ball away with a fundamentally correct slide into second_base . If Campos played ice_hockey , he ' d be Ron Hextall , Robb Stauber . Red_Line Campos . The happy wanderer , dodging slings and arrows wherever he may meander . U.S. midfielder John Harkes , just arrived from Europe and not in uniform for the game , shakes his head in the press_box at halftime . &quot; Well , Campos is always flashy , &quot; Harkes mutters . &quot; If I were out there today , I ' d be shooting at him from the 50-yard line. &quot; After the game , which the U.S. team won , 1-0 , on a goal by Roy Wegerle in the 52nd minute , U.S. goalkeeper Tony Meola , a staunch stay-at-home type , is asked what he thinks_about the Campos free style . &quot; I think it ' s great for Mexico , &quot; Meola says , &quot; but I don ' t think it ' s going_to work if he has to go_to Europe . The same thing that happened to Higuita , you know -- you ' re going to get beat . You just don ' t play that way . &quot; But he ' s very good for Mexico . There ' s nobody in the world that can do for Mexico what he can do. &quot; Higuita . There they go again , always dredging_up the name of Rene Higuita whenever the conversation turns_to Campos . that ' s because Higuita , a former Colombian goalkeeper , is about the only point_of_reference when it comes_to Campos . Like Campos , Higuita was a wide-ranging daredevil , but in the 1990 World Cup , he was burned for eternity when he misplayed a ball outside the penalty area and lost_it to Cameroon ' s Roger Milla , who converted for the goal that eliminated Colombia . Campos hears about Higuita only as often as he is interviewed . After defending him for the first 1 # 000 questions , Campos now takes the offensive when asked about Higuita . &quot; I would hope something would happen to me like it did to him , &quot; Campos says , &quot; because he has already played a World Cup , whereas I have not . &quot; I believe that Higuita did a very good job in the last World Cup . Everybody remembers the mistakes he made , but they don ' t remember the great plays , the great stops . And through time , he has revolutionized the game of soccer. &quot; If Higuita laid the groundwork , Campos is carrying the baton the next leg . No less an authority than Cesar Luis Menotti , coach of Argentina ' s 1978 World Cup champion , calls Campos &quot; the goalkeeper of the 21st century , &quot; citing the offensive possibilities Campos has created from a defensive position . Bora Milutinovic , coach of the U.S. World Cup team , is also an unabashed fan . Milutinovic , who once coached the club team Campos plays for , Universidad Autonoma de Mexico Pumas , voted Campos second on his 1993 world player of the year ballot behind Roberto Baggio of Italy . Asked what he likes about Campos , Milutinovic puts it succinctly : &quot; Everything. &quot; After being named U.S. coach in 1991 , Milutinovic joked that if Mexico didn ' t want a goalkeeper as unpredictable as Campos , he ' d be glad to take the problem off their hands . &quot; I don ' t think he comes so ( dangerously ) far out , &quot; Milutinovic says . &quot; This is how the team plays . You build the team around Campos . You have the team play as he plays. &quot; Mexico Coach Miguel Mejia Baron has done just that . Rather than tether Campos to his goalpost , Baron encourages the mad forays out of the box . Because Campos is small for a goalkeeper -- only 5 foot 9 -- Baron believes he must accentuate his greatest strengths , mobility and agility . &quot; He does take risks , &quot; Baron allows . &quot; We are fully aware of that . But football is a game of risks and he has the team ' s and coach ' s backing. &quot; So far the risk has not translated into disaster , although one misstep by Campos did prove costly in a January friendly against Bulgaria in San Diego . Playing the ball loosely outside the box late in the game , Campos turned it over and was forced to foul to prevent an empty-net goal . Bulgaria converted the resulting penalty kick , the game ended in a 1-1 tie and the headlines in Mexico the following morning read : &quot; 1 GOAL FOR MEXICO , 1 BLUNDER FOR CAMPOS. &quot; &quot; Yes , I had some problems , &quot; Campos says of the Bulgaria match , &quot; but fortunately , that ' s been the only one , and it happened in a friendly match . Fortunately , it hasn ' t happened in an official game . Hopefully , it never will. &quot; Campos has been called a &quot; sweeper-keeper &quot; and in the program , he is occasionally listed as &quot; Goalkeeper / Forward. &quot; He has played both positions professionally , sometimes in the same game , which is a little like Troy Aikman moonlighting as a defensive tackle during the Super Bowl . Campos broke_in with Pumas as a forward in 1989 and actually led the team in scoring with 14 goals . He made the move to goalkeeper in 1990 and has stayed there ever since , although he still wears the jersey and shorts of a field player underneath his goalie ' s uniform , just in case . During Gold Cup ' 93 , Campos made several such quick changes . Baron would replace him in goal in the second_half and move him up front , from where Campos assisted on goals against Canada and Martinique . He also hit the post on a shot against Jamaica . Campos says it is &quot; my dream to score a goal in World Cup &quot; and thoroughly relishes those rare opportunities he is given to mix it up_on the other end . &quot; The goalkeeper has a lot more pressure , &quot; Campos has said . &quot; There , one can ' t make a mistake . You can avoid 10 goals and if they put one in on you , they forget everything beforehand . &quot; Forward is the opposite . As an attacker , I feel more free and tranquil. &quot; Back in his homeland , Campos is a national hero , rivaling boxer Julio Cesar Chavez as the most revered athlete in Mexico . Children especially love his garish self-designed uniforms . Pint-sized knockoffs of the Campos look were the most popular Halloween costume in Mexico last year . Now he is coming_to the United States , and all_of North_America could be his for the taking . Already , Nike has launched a heavy promotional campaign , placing the face of Jorge Campos , rainbow warrior , in television commercials , in magazine ads and on a mammoth mural painted on the east_side of the Hollywood Equitable Building on the corner of Hollywood andVine . Some product , this Campos . A soccer player flamboyant enough to even catch the wary eye of the American sports fan -- and already gift-wrapped , to boot . &quot; I understand the popularity of Jorge Campos is the product of this special moment in Mexican football , &quot; Campos recently told the Mexican sports magazine Deporte Ilustrado . &quot; But everything comes and goes . Everything changes . &quot; There will be other players and other teams and hopefully , ( Mexican ) football will have better days ahead . By then , my persona will be left_behind and I will be forgotten , because that ' s the way things happen. &quot; Don ' t bet your mango-mauve-and-magenta soccer sweater on it .
