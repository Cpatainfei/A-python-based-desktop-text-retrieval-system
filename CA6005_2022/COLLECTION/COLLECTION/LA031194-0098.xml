   <HEADLINE> GOLF_COURSE SINKHOLE PERILS NEARBY PCH ; STABILIZATION : GIANT CRATER AND A DAMAGED UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE CHANNEL BELOW IT ARE ONLY 25 FEET FROM THE IMPORTANT TRAFFIC ARTERY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Emergency crews are scrambling to repair a strange crater-size hole on a Dana Point golf_course and a damaged underground drainage channel that threaten to undermine nearby Pacific Coast Highway and sewer and gas_lines . The hole , estimated to be 80 feet long , 40 feet wide and 30 feet deep , was discovered by surprised maintenance workers near the 13th green at the Links at Monarch Beach golf_course on Feb . 21 . At first , nobody knew what created the mysterious hole , but eventually , Orange County public works officials found evidence that an aging drainage channel 30 to 40 feet underground had cracked , causing the ground above it to sink . &quot; It could cause catastrophic failure if the roof ( of the channel ) was to finally cave_in , &quot; said Jim Miller , chief of flood_control design for the county . &quot; The main thing is we don ' t want additional movement or dropping to occur. &quot; The potential for problems -- the four-lane coastal highway is only 25 feet away -- prompted the County Board of Supervisors this week to declare a local emergency in the area and authorize an initial $ 200 # 000 funds for repairs . By Thursday , county crewmen had begun fixing the broken 14-foot-high drainage channel , although officials still do not know the extent of the damage . Like miners , workers are laboring in the damp darkness of intact sections of the channel , trying to support the vulnerable tunnel with a concrete foundation . &quot; It ' s really like a mining operation , working deep inside the culvert , &quot; said Jim Williams , an engineer for the county ' s Environmental Management Agency . &quot; The good news is there is a golf_course above it . . . and we have access large enough to drive a truck and equipment into it. &quot; However , the project could take six months and hundreds of thousands of dollars to finish . And , if the hole expands , it could cause a break_in the highway , Williams said . &quot; If the situation continued to deteriorate it could cause damage to PCH , &quot; he said . &quot; If it was sudden , someone ( on the roadway ) could get hurt . But we are in there to prevent something like that from happening. &quot; Golf_course spokesman Ben Cagle said the course remains open and there is no danger to players . The damaged area has been roped_off and lies just off the 13th green near the tony Ritz Cove housing_development on the ocean side of Pacific Coast Highway . The large hole in the golf_course apparently appeared overnight , according to Miller . Golf_course employees &quot; told us when they went_home on Sunday afternoon , everything looked OK , but when they came_in on the 21st , they saw it , &quot; Miller said . * County crews later discovered the sinkhole was only a symptom of a problem about 30 to 40 feet underground , Miller said . The sinkhole can easily be filled , but it could take months to fix the underground channel , Miller said . Most of the damage is near a junction connecting an old section of the storm drain to a newer one , Miller said . A break at the junction has allowed water to seep into the ground and dirt to sink into the big channel , or culvert . Escaping water has destroyed the channel ' s foundation . &quot; The box culvert is actually floating on water , &quot; said Jerry Sterling , a senior county engineer . &quot; It ' s hard to believe when you see the size_of_it , but it ' s happening. &quot; Part of the problem is that an old section of the channel was built_in an arch shape in 1932 , when Pacific Coast Highway was constructed through south Orange County . The rest of the drainage culvert , which is box shaped , was attached in 1973 when developers graded the Salt Creek area , county officials said . &quot; The arch is not built_in the same way the box is built , &quot; Miller said . &quot; The downstream end of the arch structure has dropped , pulling the roof section away . . . . We don ' t know what caused it to drop ; right now we are more interested in stabilizing it. &quot; &quot; I would n ' t really even want to speculate what caused it , &quot; Williams said . &quot; For whatever reason , water is running underneath &quot; the culvert . A New Hole on 13 A huge hole that appeared overnight near the 13th green on a Dana Point golf_course may have been caused by water leakage from a crack in an underground storm drain . What likely happened : 1 . Storm drain sections separate ; bottom of older storm drain settles and cracks ; dirt trickles in from above . 2 . Water gushes out , eroding soil and weakening foundation of storm drain . 3 . Soil is destblized in funnel effect , creating massive hole above ground . Section built_in 1932 . Buried 30-40 feet below ground . Sinkhole is 80 feet long , 40 feet wide and 30 feet deep . Section built_in 1973 . Storm drain : 12 feet wide and 14 feet high big enough to drive a truck through .
