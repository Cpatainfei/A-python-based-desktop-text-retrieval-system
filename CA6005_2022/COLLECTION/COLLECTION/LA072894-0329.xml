   <HEADLINE> GLOBAL PIRACY BRINGS NEW BRAND OF SLEUTH ; TRADE : INVESTIGATORS TELL OF FLEXIBLE METHODS USED TO TRACK INTELLECTUAL-PROPERTY CRIME , WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR 6 % OF WORLD ' S VOLUME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Private_investigators of the 1990s -- far removed from the traditional trench-coat-clad sleuths tracking marital indiscretions , have found a new_line of business -- the fight against intellectual-property crime . So-called intellectual-property enforcement is a response to the upsurge in brand counterfeiting , copyright piracy and illegal importing that market liberalization and cheaper manufacturing methods have made much easier . Together , the various forms of intellectual-property ( IP ) crime are now estimated to make_up 6 % of all world trade . Moreover , the latest wave of IP crime is not just about faking trendy T-shirts and sneakers . A potentially fatal trade_in bogus pharmaceuticals , automotive and even aircraft components are where the real profits are often found . At the same time , most of the world ' s legal authorities appear ill-equipped -- or unwilling -- to stamp it out . This is where private_investigators , with their more flexible methods , come_in . Investigation firm MRH Partnership , whose services were used in some of the_British takeover battles of the 1980s , is one of a handful of firms now working in intellectual property . MRH partner Duncan Mee said his first IP enforcement case was a large European drug_company which had found_out that a hospital in the former Czechoslovakia was being supplied cheap versions of its best-selling post-operative drug . Locating the Dutch trading company making the shipments was easy enough . But Mee ' s client wanted to know who was actually manufacturing the drugs . With the Dutch authorities showing no interest in the case , he set_about tracking the source using a classic investigation technique -- checking each night ' s garbage from Amsterdam ' s Schiphol airport for shipment notes . On the tenth day of searching , Mee and a colleague found a torn-up note indicating the same , peculiar storage conditions needed for the drug and the name of the Israeli company that had sent the shipment . That , it turned_out , was what the client needed . Mee was not told what action was then pursued but believes that , as often is the case , the client was content with an out-of-court_settlement . Mee insists methods such_as garbage-searching -- or &quot; garbology &quot; as some call it -- are carried_out strictly within the laws of the country involved . &quot; Our clients are mainly blue-chips . They would n ' t like it if we were caught doing something illegal. &quot; Other common methods for catching the IP criminal include &quot; trap-buying &quot; -- posing as a potential customer for bogus goods . Infiltrating a company by becoming an employee can also work well , particularly in catching users of pirated computer software , one of the most frequent license abuses . But even when hard evidence of counterfeiting or patent abuse is unearthed , getting a meaningful prosecution for such crimes remains unusually difficult . &quot; The courts are still giving_out pathetic sentences , &quot; says Paul Carratu , managing director of investigation firm Carratu International . &quot; Britain is one of the worst , &quot; he added . &quot; Whether it ' s still an effect of ( former Prime_Minister ) Margaret Thatcher ' s free-market philosophy or not , I don ' t know. &quot; Carratu , whose retired father Vincent is widely acknowledged to have been the forerunner in the field of IP enforcement during the 1970s , said another problem was lack of resources . &quot; Most of these crimes span more_than one country . The police simply haven ' t got the budget to chase them internationally. &quot; At the same time , the predominantly poor countries where much patent and copyright abuse originates shy_away_from enforcing thorough IP legislation . They argue that they cannot afford the prices being charged for what is to them critical industrial equipment or health products made by Western multinationals .</TEXT>
