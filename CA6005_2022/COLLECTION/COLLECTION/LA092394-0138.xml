   <HEADLINE> NATO RETALIATES , BOMBS SERB TANK IN BOSNIA ; BALKANS : AIR STRIKES ARE LAUNCHED AFTER A FRENCH SOLDIER IS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED IN A REBEL ATTACK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> NATO warplanes on Thursday punished a Bosnian Serb attack on U.N. troops by bombing an unmanned tank near Sarajevo , increasing tension in the troubled peacekeeping mission and reminding a world distracted by other crises that war still rages in the Balkans . The air strikes , carried_out at dusk by American and British aircraft , were provoked by a Serbian attack on French troops earlier in the day , NATO officials said . In that incident , four rocket-propelled grenades were fired at a light-tank unit northeast of the Bosnian capital . One French soldier was seriously wounded . The NATO action was called_for by French Gen . Bertrand de Lapresle , the U.N. Protection Force commander , &quot; to prove that he would not take the attack on the_French tank lying_down , &quot; said squadron leader Maj . Nigel Branston , a spokesman at the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ' s headquarters for southern Europe in Naples , Italy . But the air strike threatened to widen a rift between NATO countries with peacekeeping forces deployed in Bosnia-Herzegovina and others -- chiefly the United States -- that have been pressing for tougher measures against the defiant Serbs without the same fear of consequences for troops on the ground . French and British soldiers serving with the U.N. mission in Bosnia have become the chief targets of angry Serbs as pressure builds_in Western countries for an end to a U.N. arms embargo that has severely disadvantaged the Muslim-led Bosnian government . British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , commander of U.N. troops in Bosnia , opposes any moves the rebels would see as outside forces taking sides against them , such_as air strikes or seeking to arm the government forces . Rose has repeatedly declined to use force to compel the Serbs to honor weapons-exclusion zones proclaimed around Sarajevo and the eastern town of Gorazde . Serbian forces also routinely violate a &quot; no-fly &quot; zone declared over Bosnia . Paul Risley , a spokesman at U.N. headquarters in Zagreb , Croatia , said U.N. observers have reported &quot; scores of sorties &quot; by Bosnian Serb helicopters to battlefronts in the republic ' s northeast . Thursday ' s air strike was carried_out by NATO aircraft flying over Bosnia in what are usually symbolic patrols . De Lapresle called_on NATO to retaliate for the attack on the_French unit , prompting alliance commanders in Naples to order pilots near Sarajevo to find and destroy a previously identified target , a T-55 tank deployed about two miles from the U.N.-controlled airport in violation of the weapons-exclusion zone . A U.S. A-10 Warthog , the air combat workhorse dubbed the &quot; tank-buster , &quot; located the tank and ran a strafing sortie at 6:25 p.m. The pilot reported back that he was unsure he had hit the target shrouded in shadows , Branston said . Two British Jaguars then swept the area near the Serbian base at Lukavica , each dropping a 1 # 000-pound bomb . &quot; We have no final report on damages , &quot; Branston said . &quot; The ( U.S. ) cannon_fire was thought to have missed , but the 1 # 000-pound bombs hit on or very near to the target. &quot; He said no casualties were believed to have been incurred on the Serbian side because the tank was chosen by De Lapresle &quot; on the basis that there would be no loss of life , because there had been no loss of life on the U.N. side. &quot; U.N. commanders have become fearful of the precarious position in which the foreign troops deployed in Bosnia find themselves as pressure builds to end the lopsided arms embargo . The Clinton_Administration has warned that it will press the U.N. Security_Council to exempt the Bosnian government unless the Serbian rebels agree to an internationally mediated peace plan by Oct . 15 . Washington has also suggested that it may act unilaterally to arm the outgunned government forces if Security_Council allies refuse to go_along . There were indications that the latest air strike , at least in part , reflects the tougher stance in favor of NATO action in Bosnia reportedly being pressed by the United States . According to NATO sources , the Administration wants to be able to point to a more aggressive alliance response to Serbian violations as a way to persuade Congress to give_up its plan to vote for a unilateral lifting of the arms embargo . Western diplomats in this Austrian_capital say they detect serious resistance in the Pentagon and in some parts of the White_House to any action that could sour relations with NATO allies . Many fear that ending the embargo will intensify Bosnia ' s blood bath and force U.N. troops to pull_out of the region to avoid being attacked or taken hostage by resentful Serbs . Air_power has been used only four times previously against the Serbs : once in February , when four aircraft violating the &quot; no-fly &quot; zone were shot down ; twice in April to slow a rebel assault against Muslim civilians in Gorazde after hundreds had been killed in the purportedly U.N.-protected &quot; safe area , &quot; and on Aug . 5 , when U.S. warplanes shot_up an antiquated mobile gun near Sarajevo after rebels had seized tanks and armored vehicles from a U.N.-guarded weapons containment site . Times staff writers Tyler Marshall in Brussels and Stanley Meisler at the United Nations contributed to this report .</TEXT>
