   <HEADLINE> SINGLE-PAYER SYSTEM MEANS MEDICAL SERFDOM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Wake_up , Valley medical professionals : One of your colleagues is touting medical serfdom as a glorious future . Dr. Melvin H . Kirschner ( Valley Commentary , Feb . 27 ) trumpets government-monopoly medicine -- or , as he puts it , a single-payer system -- as the solution to the incompetence of the government-controlled insurance cartel . The medical system is a maze of paper pushers because socialistic intervention in the economy requires a bureaucracy . Nationalization of medicine will drive the best out of the medical field , ruin pharmaceutical research and endanger patients with rationed treatments . Putting government in_charge of the system will turn medical professionals into slaves of the state . Medicine is_on the brink of becoming a giant postal_service . SCOTT HOLLERAN Glendale</TEXT>
