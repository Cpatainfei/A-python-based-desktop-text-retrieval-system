   <HEADLINE> CONDO Q &amp; A : OWNER OF QUAKE-DAMAGED UNIT UNSURE ABOUT STAYING OR WALKING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> QUESTION : My condominium association has levied a special_assessment of $ 4 # 000 to cover the cost of repairing earthquake damage to the common areas . I also must pay_for damage inside my condominium unit . My unit has depreciated in value so that I now owe more on my mortgage that the unit is worth . It seems unwise to put more money into repairs . I love my unit and the location is near my work . I don ' t really want to move . However , because of the financial situation , I have been advised by some friends to simply walk away from the unit and default_on my loan and association assessment payments . What can I do ? ANSWER : Walking away will have a dire , long-term affect on your credit rating and it won ' t win you any friends in your association . If the bank forecloses on your unit , the bank generally is not required to pay the unpaid special_assessment . The burden of your regular assessments that remain unpaid until the bank foreclosure and the special_assessment will have to be shared by the other owners in the long_run . There may be a way for you to get some financial assistance so that you can stay in the unit that you love . Contact the Small Business Administration to see if refinancing is a possibility . You may be able to refinance your mortgage loan at the unit ' s current appraised value and obtain the assistance that you need for the special_assessment and the damage to your unit . Application to the SBA must be filed by May 15 , 1994 . The phone_number is ( 800 ) 488-5323 . How Can Board Hire Management Firm ? Q : We live_in a 36-unit condominium association . If all_of the officers want to resign from the board of directors , can they hire a management company to take_over the management of the association ? Do all_of the owners have the right_to_vote on hiring a management company ? How does the voting take_place ? A : The board cannot stop functioning . The association must have directors who are responsible_for making decisions and setting policies even if a management company is hired . You can find_out if the board has the authority to hire a management company by reading your association ' s declaration of covenants , conditions and restrictions to make the decision without a vote of the owners . If the cost of hiring management would increase the annual budget more_than 20 % , then approval of the owners would be required . The board can call a special meeting of the owners . A quorum of more_than 50 % must attend the meeting . The budget increase must be approved by a majority of the voters who are in_attendance at the meeting . Who Should Be Hired to Update Bylaws ? Q : I live_in a small homeowner association . Some of the owners would like to update the association ' s declaration and bylaws ; however , there is no money in the budget_for this purpose . Can we keep the cost down by hiring a paralegal ? A : The board should adopt a budget that adequately covers legal expenses for the association . There are proper procedures that must be followed or you may find that the revised documents are unenforceable . In my opinion , revision of the legal_documents should only be done_by an attorney who specializes in community association law . A community association manager or consultant would be able to assist you with the preliminary stages of the project but the attorney should review all_of the documents and approve or write the sections that are being revised . The attorney will advise you about the approval procedure for amended or revised documents and handle the recordation with the county .</TEXT>
