   <TEXT> Seeing a slightly disheveled David Thewlis sauntering through a somber room full of assorted levels of pricelessness in the L.A. County Museum of Art , it ' s hard not to flinch just a little bit , even though you know better . Thewlis ' retinue assures all comers that this Londoner is the gentlest of actorly souls . But his two most prominent performances so far , both as vicious , violence-prone street-dwellers -- first , playing a likely sociopath in Mike Leigh ' s film &quot; Naked , &quot; and , this week , a pedophile on the public-TV series &quot; Prime Suspect &quot; -- have seemed almost too frighteningly good not to be true . And so when you see him walk up with the cowlicks in his hair not quite kempt and his clothes not quite pressed , you remember the two roles and forget yourself . And worry for the Hockney a bit . Thewlis has come not to slash the Hockney , but to praise it , of course . He just met the painter the other day , and points_out that David Hockney , like himself , is a Northern Englishman come_to Los Angeles , a fellow &quot; working-class bloke &quot; in the land of plenty . It ' s Hockney ' s own vision of local plenty that made Thewlis fall_in_love with L.A. ; he just recently become a part-time resident , in fact . We ' re standing in front of the artist ' s wall-sized canvas , &quot; Mulholland Drive : The Road to the Studio , &quot; an illogically colorful , slightly surrealist view of Hollywood as an inviting series of weird rolling hills , a wonderland cut_up by friendly highways and unfettered by fires or riots . &quot; I ' d been here before , but when my wife and I first came_to the museum in June , seeing this painting was the first time I kind of fell_in_love with something about L.A. , &quot; explains Thewlis . &quot; I sat before it for about 20 minutes and just loved it so_much it made me feel better about the city . It makes me see it in a whole different light , as less hostile , where there ' s something possibly quite beautiful about it . &quot; It ' s probably very romanticized , but that ' s the L.A. that I like , there , &quot; he says , with a nod toward the Hockney . &quot; I found the things here that I ' m happy with , and know what to leave aside. &quot; This is most definitely not Johnny talking . Johnny is the accentuate-the-negative bloke Thewlis plays in Leigh ' s &quot; Naked , &quot; an unforgettable role that won him the award for best actor of 1993 from the National Society of Film Critics , the New York Film Critics , the London Film Critics ' Circle and the Cannes Film Festival panel , among other accolades . Johnny is the punk-rock ethos made flesh , a walking diatribe railing against God ' s inhumanity to man , a brilliant , angry raconteur whose uncompromising insistence on alienating everyone he meets relegates him to haranguing fellow street people instead of his intellectual peers . Johnny is someone who , from his lowest-class London vantage_point , sees only chaos and no order , and has become the world ' s most engagingly sardonic rage-aholic , if not the most agreeably &quot; anti &quot; of all recent screen anti-heroes . Demanding a sit as it was , &quot; Naked &quot; did only moderate art-house business in L.A. after opening in December , although it has played successfully in New York through this month , and was especially widely seen in the industry because of videocassettes sent_out for a long-shot Oscar campaign on Thewlis ' behalf . Among his contemporaries , at least , Thewlis is already becoming the stuff of legend , based mostly on Johnny , the role of a lifetime . Anyone who didn ' t get enough of Thewlis ' nastiness in &quot; Naked &quot; can get more in the coming weeks with the third cycle of the gritty &quot; Prime Suspect &quot; series , which is extremely popular_with audiences here as well as in its native England . ( The four parts begin airing on a weekly basis this Thursday on PBS. ) &quot; Prime Suspect &quot; is a vehicle for savvy police investigator Helen Mirren , but although Thewlis ' guest part is fairly small , he basically has the title_role , as a homosexual pimp , child_molester and all-around bird_of_prey believed to be a serial_murderer . As the &quot; Suspect &quot; of record he ' s even scarier -- and far less bright -- than Johnny , but the unsavory similarities between the two roles are unmistakable . Thewlis , who is reputable and peace-loving enough to have been given the run of the closed County Museum of Art for the afternoon , seems a little dismayed to think_of the impression Americans might take_away of him from these two parts alone . &quot; It ' s strange that the two things that I ' m gonna get known for here in the near future are those two projects , because I play such a sadistic bastard in both of them , &quot; Thewlis says . &quot; that ' s really not the sort of work I ' ve been doing before ; I ' m not typecast in Britain as those kind of characters , and I ' d never played those kinds of desperate , self-destructive , violent , aggressive people . ' Naked ' was a real departure , and that ' s a credit to Mike , that he does allow artists to do something they ' ve never done before. &quot; * This being a Leigh film -- which at no point in its creation or end result resembles a Hollywood picture -- there was no script drafted before the actors were assembled , and the players were responsible_for writing their own parts in the months of rehearsal , creating situations and dynamics for the movie weeks in_advance but usually coming_up with the dialogue hours or minutes before the cameras roll . This demands a Method-ist devotion to the character , since without that kind of absorption on the part of the actor , there are no lines . So Thewlis immersed himself in Johnny ' s interests , devouring heady texts on evolution , biology , social_science , theology and the likes , so that he might come_up with convincing harangues on why humankind might be coming_to an end . Ironically , it was in direct response to the unrelenting negativity of his &quot; Naked &quot; creation that Thewlis deliberately chose to start wearing rose-colored glasses , as it were . &quot; I was perceiving the world in a very negative way , which was an adjustment that was difficult to make . But once I ' d made_it , it was difficult to come_out of at the end of the film , because you ' ve learned to see everything in such a dark light . You would find nothing beautiful or worthwhile . . . . &quot; I mean , the whole experience made me much more hippie and Buddhist , &quot; Thewlis says with a slight smile . &quot; that ' s where all this research drove me . It drove Johnny into something much more nihilistic . &quot; I ' m at a stage now where I only find natural things really beautiful . I still see even this kind of beauty &quot; -- he waves his arms at the naturalistic sculptures of the human form in one museum room -- &quot; as still synthetic and very man-made . No matter what one looks_at and finds temporarily pleasing , it can never be as beautiful as just a tree , really. &quot; He laughs slightly , admitting this is a philosophy he &quot; never really had before. &quot; In selectively looking_at his adopted second city of Los Angeles , he also misses the urban forest for the trees , as it were , and doesn ' t concentrate_on the blight . &quot; I couldn ' t stay here if I had that image , if I saw this place in that way , because it would depress me too_much . that ' s how I see London , in a very depressing way -- hence , a lot of ' Naked. ' You always have to look_for something beautiful wherever you go . So the way I ' ve been able to tolerate spending this much time here -- which I ' ve needed to , for work reasons -- is to find something poetic about it . &quot; Maybe , &quot; he says , almost under his breath , &quot; I ' m deluded. &quot; Who would have guessed : The Johnny Rotten of screendom turns_out to be a Norman Vincent Peale in real_life . * Thewlis ' age is hard to place : Even with a mustache and growth of beard , his pouty lips help make him look a little baby-faced , a quality that sets_off his sadism in these two latest roles in an ironic way . In &quot; Naked , &quot; there ' s even a scene in which another character guesses how old Johnny is and , because of the character ' s haggardness , guesses way too high . In that movie , he was supposed to be in his late 20s but looked 40-ish ; Thewlis recently turned 31 . Before coming_to London , he grew_up in a seaside town with parents who had bought a little store and made their way up_to &quot; shopkeeper class &quot; -- a step_up from most of his working-class relatives who lived_in Yorkshire and toiled in the mines , but still a good step below middle-class on the United Kingdom ' s self-conscious social scale , he ' s particular to point_out . His acting career has come_along in moderate steps : studies at the Guild Hall School_of_Music and Drama , theater at the National and the Royal Court , small roles in movies like &quot; The Trial &quot; and &quot; Afraid of the Dark. &quot; But most of his work has been_on British TV -- hence , how little of it has been seen in America . &quot; It ' s certainly true that television is definitely of a higher_quality there than here . . . . There ' s not as much distinction between TV and film and theater in Britain , because most actors move comfortably between the three . You can ' t actually be just a movie actor in Britain , because we don ' t make that many movies. &quot; Not that he ' s quite jumped_on the miserable bandwagon bemoaning the apparent slow demise of his homeland ' s movie_industry . &quot; I ' ve never really taken an interest in what it actually means to say the_British film_industry is dying , in terms of what can be done about it seriously instead of ' Can we just have more money ? ' I mean , they ' re closing every hospital and school in England at the moment , and they ' re not going_to give it to a lot of maverick filmmakers to make seditious anti-government films. &quot; But Thewlis has worked extensively with the most seditious of them , including Ken Loach and the late Alan Clarke . His first fateful hookup with Leigh was_on a short film , &quot; Short &amp; Curlies &quot; ( still seen regularly between features on Bravo cable ) . Their first feature together was the comedic &quot; Life Is Sweet , &quot; in which Thewlis had one of the smaller roles , as the well-intended suitor who , memorably , licks chocolate off ornery Jane Horrocks ' breasts . Then came &quot; Naked , &quot; an experience so intense that Thewlis says he can ' t imagine taking_on another Leigh movie for a long_time . &quot; We will work together again , but I don ' t think it ' ll be for a_few years , because it takes_over your life ; it ' s damaging , really , almost . Everything else is swept to the side -- relationships and friendships and family and any other concerns one might have . If you don ' t put_in 100 % , you suffer. &quot; Thewlis claims he doesn ' t have a violent bone in his body and has never even hit anyone , let alone committed the borderline date-rape that ' s Johnny ' s hallmark in &quot; Naked. &quot; But inasmuch as he did invest parts of himself in the character , might that have been a scary thing to get_in_touch with , or just acting exhilaration ? &quot; Well , it was both -- I mean , it was exhilarating because it was scary . And what it was was ridding myself of a lot of stuff I might have repressed all my life . An enormous amount of anger rose to the surface and was allowed to be released . And it was very liberating , as I was given license to scream and run_through the streets and speak my mind at all times and to have no fear , really -- just somebody who doesn ' t give a ( expletive ) . And most of us do give a ( expletive ) and we don ' t want to speak out of turn or do anything that would turn dissent upon us . My job was to basically irritate people most of the time , and in the research for the part and the exploring of the territory , I didn ' t care about anyone . That was kind of a liberating thing to go_through , not to care at all what people think_about you -- and in fact , quite the opposite , to really try and initiate hostility against yourself , so that you can rise to it. &quot; * Shortly after winning the first of his many best actor prizes at Cannes last year , he shot &quot; Prime Suspect 3 , &quot; which he still hasn ' t seen , though it has already been shown in Britain ( &quot; they even move the news for it ; it ' s that popular &quot; ) . It ' s riveting television that puts even America ' s best-made progressive cop shows to shame , but Thewlis sounds a little wary about watching the tape he was sent . He says that filming the carefully scripted series after the long , grueling collaboration of &quot; Naked &quot; came as something of a relief . But he says that he did miss having extended rehearsal times like those on the Leigh films , and that he isn ' t quite as satisfied with his performance as he might have been with more preparation . &quot; It ' s also difficult because it ' s hard to research something like that , &quot; Thewlis says of his kiddie-pimp character . How does one actually come_to feel_like that man must have felt , without actually becoming perverse oneself and breaking the law ? Although my wife would come_back and find me looking_at Robert Mapplethorpe books and get very worried about me . I was looking_at pictures of homosexual bondage and trying to find something in it that was in some way mentally having to do with it . . . . &quot; He sounds frustrated even now : &quot; I think I never quite latched onto it. &quot; Stateside audiences will finally get_to see Thewlis as something other_than a nasty in this summer ' s family horse fable , &quot; Black Beauty. &quot; Next up for him is a shoot in Wales , where he would like to settle_down in the countryside with his wife and just paint , a la his new friend , the other David . But his wife ( Sara Sugarman , an actress who recently got signed to ICM , Thewlis says , by virtue of being funny at parties she would attend with him ) would prefer to stay_on full-time in L.A. , and part of him would too , he admits . The recent flattery from the Hollywood film community hasn ' t hurt . &quot; I met Spielberg the other day , and he told me he ' d seen ' Naked ' and really loved it , and said he ' d sat_up all night with Brian DePalma and Martin Scorsese in their respective apartments arguing about the film . Wow , I wish I could ' ve been a fly_on the wall. &quot; Now he ' d like to write a script about an expatriate British actor , &quot; just about how one ' s life can change from one thing to another very suddenly , and getting swept along in a crisis of identity into the future and who you are and who your friends are. &quot; And now that the rage of the_English art-movie crowd is getting congratulations from the unlikely likes of Spielberg and Sylvester Stallone , would this fictional identity-crisis story Thewlis wants to write be a cautionary tale ? &quot; I ' m certainly not complaining or suffering about it , &quot; he proclaims . &quot; It ' s a wonderful thing to happen to one , as long as you keep_an_eye_on yourself . All I did was I pretended to be someone else for a_few months , and it appears I did_it quite good , and that ' s all. &quot; And yet , in daily life , he professes regularity . &quot; I live_in a very small flat in Soho . Most of my friends are out_of_work . I hang_out in cheap coffee_bars and clubs and at friends ' houses which are kind of squats . But as soon as Cannes happened , it ' s like this little door opens and you ' re invited into this little club , which is the rich and famous. &quot; Better he put_off writing that particular script ; like any actor who just graduated from friends on the dole to friends who just won Oscars , he sounds conflicted . &quot; I do find myself just thinking a lot of the time it ' s just very strange what happened recently , just because I ' ve been taken_out of this one life and been put into this life here . I mean , here now -- talking to the L.A. Times in the museum of art and getting David Hockney ' s personal permission to have my picture taken here . . . . We ' re surrounded by surrealist paintings , but I mean , it ' s all surreal to me. &quot;</TEXT>
