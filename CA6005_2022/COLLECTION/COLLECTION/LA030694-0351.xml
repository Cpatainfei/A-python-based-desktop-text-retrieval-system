   <HEADLINE> VIEW FROM WASHINGTON / JAMES RISEN ; TYSON ' S ACADEMIC TOME SETS TONE FOR CLINTON ' S STAND ON JAPANESE TRADE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There is a great scene in the movie &quot; Patton &quot; that seems relevant today in the budding trade conflict between the United States and Japan . Early in the film , George C . Scott , playing Gen . George S . Patton Jr. , triumphantly surveys the North African battlefield on which his U.S. troops have just wrecked the Afrika Korps of Germany ' s military genius , Field_Marshal Irwin Rommel . &quot; Rommel ! &quot; Patton shouts , &quot; I read your book ! &quot; Know your adversary . that ' s one of the oldest rules of combat . So maybe Japan ' s trade negotiators should read the collected works of one Laura D ' Andrea Tyson . Only rarely do academic publications have any impact on public policy . But Tyson , now the chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers , wrote a dry tome just before she joined the Clinton team that now reads eerily like a memo to the President on how to deal with Japan . In her book , &quot; Who ' s Bashing Whom ? &quot; -- published in November , 1992 ( Institute for International Economics , $ 25 paperback ) , while she was still teaching at UC Berkeley -- Tyson devoted most of one chapter to a case study of Motorola Inc. ' s attempts to break_into the Japanese cellular_telephone market . Funny , but that ' s the very case the Clinton_Administration has chosen to take a stand on in its new policy of brinkmanship with Japan . Indeed , Tyson , who has been right in the middle of every key White_House decision on Japan policy , acknowledged in an interview that the Administration is following the blueprint for aggressive action on Motorola that she laid_out in her book . &quot; There has been a consensus on Japan policy that has developed that is very similar to what I wrote , &quot; she said . &quot; U.S. policy is now consistent with what I wrote. &quot; So what is Tyson ' s bottom_line on Motorola ? In documenting the long history of the case , which has been hanging fire since the Reagan years , Tyson argues in the volume that the key lesson to be learned is this : Only when the United States gets_tough with Japan do the Japanese respond . What ' s more , she says American policy-makers should drop their fear of appearing too tough and instead demand specific results and &quot; trade outcomes &quot; from Japan . In the past , U.S. negotiators often forged legalistic trade agreements that resulted in superficial changes in Japanese trading procedures -- but not in any real increase in Japanese purchases of U.S. goods . By contrast , Tyson says , the Motorola case teaches that American negotiators shouldn ' t be afraid to get their hands dirty and push for specific trade gains for specific firms -- especially if a U.S. corporation can make a good case that it has been wronged . &quot; The Motorola story indicates that the distinction between trade management through establishing better rules and managed trade through establishing trade outcomes or results is overly simplistic and misleading , &quot; she writes . &quot; Paradoxically , in Japan ' s heavily managed market , something akin to managed trade was needed to achieve something akin to market competition. &quot; As she describes the early years of the case , Tyson writes most admiringly of American policy-makers when they show flashes of steel . The Reagan_Administration got results , she says , when it got_tough and had Secretary_of_State George P . Schultz intervene with the Japanese on Motorola ' s behalf . &quot; Unilateral pressure and bilateral negotiations were essential for the enforcement of negotiated agreements , &quot; Tyson writes . &quot; It took direct personal pressure from the U.S. secretary_of_state to compel &quot; Japanese compliance with previously negotiated agreements on the cellular_phone trade . During the early days of the Bush_Administration , Motorola once again got Japan ' s attention , she says , by filing a so-called Super 301 trade complaint with the U.S. trade representative ' s office . Such a complaint of unfair trading practices , if approved , requires American retaliation . Motorola ' s case marked one of the first uses of what was dubbed the &quot; nuclear bomb &quot; in the U.S. trade arsenal . In other words , Tyson argues , when dealing with Japan , it is best to carry a big stick . Tyson sees the Motorola story as a model for policy-making for many of the same reasons the Clinton_Administration has now selected it as a test_case in its confrontation with Japan . Simply put , the Motorola case offers some of the best evidence that Japan is an unfair trading partner . For years , Tyson writes , Motorola was a world leader in cellular_phone technology , leapfrogging the best systems Japanese firms had to offer . Yet the Schaumburg , Ill. , firm consistently was denied access to the Japanese market . Subtle , non-tariff barriers were thrown_in its way both by Japanese corporations and the Japanese government . But the end result was almost the same as if Japan had imposed prohibitive tariffs or quotas on U.S. imports . In the mid-1980s , bureaucratic delays kept Motorola at_bay long enough to give Japanese firms time to catch_up_with its technology . &quot; The telecommunications market in Japan . . . ( is ) heavily managed , &quot; writes Tyson . &quot; In this industry more_than most , there was a close alliance between Japanese bureaucratic authorities and Japanese business interests , an alliance that worked to the disadvantage of outsiders. &quot; Even after the Japanese grudgingly began to open the market to Motorola under prodding from the Reagan and Bush_administrations , the government and the Japanese telecommunications industry still sought to exclude the U.S. competitor from the lucrative Tokyo metropolitan market . Indeed , the Clinton_Administration ' s charge that Japan has failed to live_up_to a 1989 agreement to open the Tokyo region to Motorola lies at the heart of the current trade dispute . In response to what it sees as Japanese intransigence on the Motorola case , the Administration is widely expected to announce later this month that it will slap roughly $ 300 million in sanctions on a variety of Japanese imports to the United States . Ultimately , however , the Motorola case has been simply a convenient vehicle for the Administration as it seeks to send a broader message to Japan about trade . And for anyone who bothered to check , that message was clearly written by Laura Tyson nearly a year and a half ago .</TEXT>
