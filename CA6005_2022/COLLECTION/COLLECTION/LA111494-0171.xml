   <HEADLINE> BRINGING PC PROFITS HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS ; MANUFACTURERS ARE PULLING_OUT THE STOPS TO CAPTURE FAST-GROWING FAMILY MARKET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About 2 million shoppers will plunk_down $ 2 # 000 or so apiece this holiday season to buy personal_computers for their families . Most of them are craving a pleasant &quot; out-of-box experience &quot; on Christmas morning : that marvelous feeling of unpacking a powerful computer with tons of built-in software , the bells and whistles of multimedia and the simplicity of bringing the whole_shebang to life with the flick of a switch . Computer makers such_as Compaq , Packard Bell , Apple , IBM and Acer are happy to oblige . More_than a decade after personal computing began to take_off in the workplace , the home market has at last become an inviting arena for PC manufacturers . And they ' re pulling_out the stops to provide alluring products at the right price . &quot; At least in the U.S. market , sales are just going_to be incredible , &quot; said Robert Corpuz , a PC analyst with Dataquest Inc. , a San Jose research firm . &quot; It ' s a very big opportunity for the top vendors , and they ' re all well positioned to sell into the home market. &quot; As the personal_computer industry gathers_in Las Vegas for today ' s opening of Comdex , its biggest trade show of the year , business is looking fine indeed . That is despite the bruising price_competition and &quot; bundling &quot; of computer applications that have depressed profit_margins and made both hardware and software more like toasters or soybeans . Link Resources , a New York consulting firm , projects that computer_hardware sales will rise 26 % in 1994 , to $ 9.2 billion . Software revenue will increase 16 % this year to $ 2.9 billion , with multimedia games and &quot; edutainment &quot; products , featuring sound and video , soaring a staggering 340 % to $ 590 million . Accounting for much of the PC ' s popularity is the growing perception by the public that computers are becoming useful household_appliances . Many machines today can be transformed easily into VCRs , CD_players , televisions , telephones and fax machines . &quot; The home PC is , in fact , emerging as a digital chameleon , &quot; said Richard Zwetchkenbaum , research_director for International Data Corp. , a research firm in Framingham , Mass . Computers &quot; used to flow downstream , from business to consumers . Now . . . the consumer is the driving force. &quot; Another factor propelling the PC ' s popularity is its wider availability . No longer relegated to computer superstores , mail-order catalogues and specialty electronics boutiques , PCs have gone mainstream . Computers , printers and software greet shoppers at Costco-Price Club warehouse stores right inside the front_door . Mass and discount merchants such_as Sears , Target and Wal-Mart have beefed_up their computing departments , as have consumer electronics chains such_as the Good_Guys and_Circuit City . At Office Depot ' s 400 stores nationwide , home computers and business machines make_up 40 % of the revenue , up substantially from a_few years ago , said spokesman Gary Schweikhart . Home_office equipment at Circuit City ' s 279 consumer electronics stores made_up 16 % of sales in the first six months this year , up from 9 % in the same period a year ago . &quot; It is the fastest-growing segment of our business , &quot; said Paul Rakov , a spokesman for the chain , based in Richmond , Va . An estimated 46 % of all computing devices sold today are for the home ; most complete systems cost between $ 1 # 200 and $ 2 # 700 . Given that more_than two-thirds of America ' s 97 million households still don ' t have personal_computers , the home represents &quot; the largest untapped market in the world , &quot; said Michael A . Norris , vice_president of consumer products for Compaq Computer Corp . Compaq , based in Houston , gets much of the credit for starting the boom a_couple_of years ago by offering aggressively priced products for the home . Its Presario computers are selling as fast as the company can ship them , Norris said , even at the rate of thousands a day . They are now offered in more_than 6 # 000 stores , up from fewer than 900 two years ago . For consumers , the chief problem this holiday is that some popular models might be in short supply as the holiday season rolls on , said Jake Winebaum , publisher and editor of New York-based FamilyPC , one of several magazines that have sprung_up in recent years to capitalize on the hot home market . IBM , for example , acknowledged recently that it underestimated demand for its Aptiva line of multimedia computers for the home , which can respond to voice commands . Like other manufacturers , IBM , known primarily in the past as a maker of business systems , is heeding the multimedia call and is moving quickly to include the capability to play CD-ROMs on all its home offerings . With so_much at stake , manufacturers are getting bolder about advertising their wares . In time for the holidays , Apple Computer Inc. has launched its first &quot; infomercial &quot; in San Francisco and Boston . During Thanksgiving week , the Cupertino-based company plans a nationwide rollout of the half-hour ad about its Performa line of Macintoshes . Despite the buoyant outlooks , Zwetchkenbaum of IDC believes that the industry will not reach its full potential for_sales growth in the home market unless it brings prices down further . For most households to be comfortable making a computer purchase , he noted , the price would have to be less than $ 700 . Mark Macgillivray , a Silicon_Valley consultant , agreed . &quot; The more companies try to outdo one another , &quot; he said , &quot; the more they raise expectations &quot; and risk disillusioning home users . But for now the industry is forging ahead . Said Norris of Compaq : &quot; The home market will be the fuel behind PC growth through the decade. &quot; PCs : Looking Hot ! Personal_computer makers have finally taken a shine to the home market . Analysts predict solid sales growth as customers snap_up multimedia computers .
