   <TEXT> CENSORED : The News_Stories That Didn ' t Make The News And Why : The 1994 Project Censored Yearbook by Carl Jensen &amp; Project Censored ( Four Walls Eight Windows : $ 14.95 ; 318 pp. , illustrated , paperback original ) . The annual Project Censored report offers devastating evidence of the dumbing-down of mainstream news in America.The flood of details and rumors about Heidi Fleiss , the Bobbits and Madonna in the mass media meant that more significant reports appeared only in smaller , often marginal publications . Among the stories that were sacrificed to make room for Woody &amp; Mia , Michael Jackson and Amy Fisher : Evidence that nearly 10 # 000 people died in the 1986 Chernobyl disaster ; that untapped oil reserves in Somalia motivated the U.S. intervention ; that the much-hyped DARE program has had little effect in discouraging drug use among students ; that the United Nations Children ' s Fund reported 9 out of 10 young people murdered in industrialized countries are slain in the U.S. Required reading for broadcasters , journalists and well-informed citizens .</TEXT>
