   <HEADLINE> MTA TALKS TO START ; GUARDED OPTIMISM TOLD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With talks scheduled to resume today between striking workers and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority , union and management officials expressed guarded optimism about getting Los Angeles ' transit system back in_gear , but there was no relief for bus-dependent riders and merchants bracing for a summer weekend without any service . Two days after suspending the stalemated bargaining sessions , negotiating teams plan to hole_up in an undisclosed hotel , where the MTA will again try to reach a compromise with its 1 # 900 mechanics , whose 5-day-old walkout has disrupted life for hundreds of thousands of commuters . Despite the resumption of talks , MTA Chief_Executive_Officer Franklin White continued his efforts to bypass the union leadership , revealing that he had mailed a conciliatory letter to each of the striking workers . Unimpressed , rank-and-file employees peppered White with jeers Thursday when he visited bus yards in Downtown Los Angeles and Highland Park , where they told him to &quot; go_back to New York &quot; and challenged him to explain salaries of more_than $ 100 # 000 for transit executives . &quot; I ' m not going_to stand here and tell you management has done everything right , &quot; said the shirt-sleeved White , vowing that his financially strapped agency would not jeopardize the strikers ' jobs in its effort to cut costs . Hector Covarrubias , a striking mechanic at the Downtown yard , was not convinced . &quot; He ' s just trying to brainwash us , &quot; Covarrubias said . &quot; The man makes $ 175 # 000 a year . He ' s not talking_about giving_up any of his money. &quot; Even as White and the workers waged their sidewalk debate , merchants along the normally bustling Broadway corridor -- one of Los Angeles ' most bus-dependent shopping hubs -- could have rolled a bowling_ball through their deserted stores without striking a customer . Instead of selling boomboxes , TVs , men ' s silk shirts , jeans or groceries , the clerks ate sandwiches and burritos , talked on the telephone , stocked shelves and worried that things will get_even worse when bus_service evaporates altogether during the all-important weekend . The MTA estimated the strike is costing at least $ 1.5 million daily in lost sales and wages in the Downtown area alone . &quot; Ay , Dios ! &quot; Manuel Lopez , 50-year-old owner of Maria ' s Seafood , said as he threw_up his hands . Inside his venerable Grand Central Market fish store was nearly $ 5 # 000 worth of salmon , shark and other fresh seafood that he feared would rot if his regular customers were unable to make_it Downtown this weekend . &quot; This is the worst time during 30 years in business , &quot; he said . On Day 4 : * The first Los Angeles transit strike in 12 years appeared destined to grind on at least into the weekend , with MTA management and the mechanics union still divided over the issue of subcontracting . MTA officials , who hope to save money by shifting some tasks to less expensive private companies , said they were pleased to see both parties back at the bargaining table . Union leaders , who consider subcontracting a threat to their jobs , also looked_forward to the dialogue . &quot; I can ' t predict what could happen at the bargaining table , &quot; said Mike Bujosa , president of the local Amalgamated Transit Union . &quot; All I can say is that I feel positive we ' re at least talking. &quot; * In his letter to striking workers , White promised employees that subcontracting would have no adverse impact on them . &quot; Despite what you may have been told , I want you to know that no current ATU employee will lose his or her job as a result of any of the MTA ' s contract proposals to subcontract a limited amount of work , &quot; White said in the letter , dated Wednesday . He explained that subcontracting is one cost-cutting tool for the agency , which already has had to make_up for a $ 126-million operating deficit . &quot; The best job security of all , &quot; White concluded , is &quot; a healthy MTA. &quot; * Transit officials reported that a bus was hit by gunfire Wednesday near an Eastside MTA facility . A small-caliber bullet left a dent in the vehicle , officials said , but no one was injured and no suspects were in custody . Also Wednesday , a striking driver was arrested on charges of interfering with a police_officer , who was citing another striker for allegedly throwing a soda_can at a bus outside an MTA facility in South-Central Los Angeles . Meanwhile , several dozen two-inch nails were found scattered in the roadway outside the El Monte bus_terminal . No MTA buses suffered damage , but several Foothill Transit buses had flat_tires , MTA spokeswoman Andrea Greene said . * The number of buses on the streets declined Thursday , from 345 to 339 , as replacement drivers -- some of them veteran supervisors who had to relearn the basics of maneuvering a seven-ton bus -- began to tire from their 12-hour emergency shifts . Usually , 1 # 900 buses are in_service , but 5 # 000 drivers and clerks have honored the mechanics ' picket_lines . Beginning today , the MTA plans to put an additional 20 buses on_the_road . The new buses , which will come from Riverside and Santa Barbara counties , will include more yellow school_buses and , for the first time , touring buses . If the strike lasts , the MTA plans to add 10 more buses Monday . * Weekend service will be suspended altogether , largely because the MTA does not have enough drivers . Another concern , transit officials said , was the potential risk for fights among passengers if only a_few buses were put_in service and crowds began to form at bus_stops . The Hollywood Bowl , which has concerts accompanied by fireworks scheduled for tonight and Saturday night , has contracted with Laidlaw to shuttle concert-goers from outlying parking_lots this weekend . Buses to Dodger Stadium will be cut , but MTA officials said the service had not been attracting many fans and is_due to be eliminated in September anyway . None of this was satisfactory to April Norton-Morgan , a 15-year-old high_school student from South-Central Los Angeles . &quot; This is really going_to mess my schedule up , &quot; she said , waiting for a bus on Vermont Avenue , as she headed_home from a USC summer_camp . &quot; On the weekends , I like to go_out with my friends and get_out of the house early . Now . . . I ' m going_to have to ask my mom for a ride. &quot; The service cuts will be much more_than an inconvenience along Broadway , which connects with some of the busiest weekend lines . Already , some shops had begun sending employees home , while others concocted creative schemes to keep_from losing their weekend revenue . Josef Cohen , who manages two stores on Broadway for Sam ' s Electronics , said he will spend $ 50 for a van on Saturday and Sunday to ferry customers from their homes if they want to shop in_person , or to deliver merchandise ordered over the telephone . Anyone who makes_it in on_their_own -- and purchases one of his TVs , typewriters or car stereos -- automatically qualifies for a free ride home . &quot; We are 97 % empty compared to what we ' re supposed to have , &quot; Cohen said . &quot; On the weekend , it ' s going_to be even worse. &quot; At Lorenzo Clothing , near 3rd Street and Broadway , manager Manuela Alvarado glumly ate a seafood taco doused with lime_juice and listened to music booming over the store ' s stereo . Usually , she and the other clerk get one short break for lunch during the afternoon . On Thursday , Alvarado was working alone and still , she said : &quot; I can eat all day if I want. &quot; Broadway ' s fate rests in the hands of two groups who , so far , have not been able to get_along . The formal bargaining sessions are being conducted in a San Fernando Valley hotel , which negotiators would rather not disclose for fear of being pestered by the media . Leading the discussions is veteran state mediator Tom McCarthy , who helped settle past Los Angeles transit strikes . He sometimes passes messages from one camp to the other . The mechanics are represented by their local president , Bujosa , and Jim Wood , secretary-treasurer of the County Federation of Labor , AFL-CIO . Representing the MTA are Gordon Krischer , a $ 290-an-hour private attorney , and Ann Neeson , director of employee relations for the MTA . They sometimes meet together , and at other times , meet privately among their own staffs to assess proposals . On Tuesday night , they negotiated for six hours before breaking about midnight . White , the MTA chief , said he has been visiting the striking workers in_person because most of them are &quot; less strident &quot; than the union leadership . But his Thursday excursions -- his sixth and seventh trips to a bus yard since workers walked_out Monday at 12:01 a.m. -- were marked by testy exchanges . &quot; When you drive_up , you never have an idea about how hostile they ' re going to be , &quot; said White , who was driven by the uniformed transit police_chief , Sharon Papa . When White arrived_at the Highland Park bus yard , it was not clear whether he was immediately recognized by the strikers . They continued marching_on the sidewalk in front of the driveway , despite a court_order prohibiting them from blocking vehicles . &quot; Guys , if you let us across , he ' ll get_out and talk to you , &quot; Papa told the strikers . As soon as they figured_out who their visitor was , the taunts began . White tried to shake hands , but one of the strikers turned_away . &quot; I have no respect for the man , &quot; said Jose Loredo , a mechanic . &quot; The man comes_out here from New York . . . . He comes_out here and lies. &quot; Undaunted , White rubbed shoulders with the crowd while about 10 transit police stood_in a semicircle several feet behind him . &quot; We ' re in a new era , &quot; he said . &quot; We aren ' t going_to be able to do_in 1994 , ' 95 and ' 96 what we were doing 10 years ago . . . . We ' re broke. &quot; &quot; It ' s not our fault , &quot; one mechanic interrupted . &quot; Where was he before we went_on strike ? &quot; Carlos Curiel , vice_president of Amalgamated Transit Union , shouted . One union_member complained about previous work that has been contracted_out to private companies , only to have to be fixed later by union mechanics . Another mechanic invited White to visit the maintenance yards more often . &quot; Come and see what your supervisors do_in between naps , &quot; a mechanic said . &quot; Is that a low blow ? &quot; said a smiling White . In another moment of lightheartedness , White grabbed a picket sign to shade himself from the fierce midday sun . For several of the strikers who happened to be toting cameras , it was a once-in-a-lifetime photo opportunity : a snapshot of top management hoisting a union sign . Before the day ended , union leaders already had printed up T-shirts capturing the moment . Times staff writer Patrick J . McDonnell contributed to this report . The MTA Strike : Day 4 The region ' s first transit strike in 12 years began at 12:01 a.m. Monday .
