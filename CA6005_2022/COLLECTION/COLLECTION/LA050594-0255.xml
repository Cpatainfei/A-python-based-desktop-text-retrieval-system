   <HEADLINE> DOLLAR JUMPS AS U.S. INTERVENES ; STOCKS EASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Massive dollar purchases by the Federal_Reserve_Bank of New York and other world central_banks halted the buck ' s steep decline Wednesday , which also helped the bond market stabilize . In the stock_market , prices were mixed_in relatively slow trading , as some investors took_to the sidelines . The Dow Jones industrials fell 16.66 points to 3 # 697.75. The dollar was the day ' s big financial story , as the Clinton_Administration signaled for the second time in a week that it would defend the currency ' s value . The Fed , acting_on behalf of the Treasury_Department , bought dollars with other currencies in a strong show of support for the greenback . Also buying dollars with the Fed were 15 other world central_banks . In total , analysts estimated , the central_banks bought $ 3 billion to $ 5 billion , much or most of that with German marks . At least for the time being , the intervention worked : The dollar surged to 1.654 marks in New York , up from 1.637 on Tuesday . The dollar also jumped to 101.85 Japanese yen from 101.05 on Tuesday . Economists have been flabbergasted this year by the dollar ' s weakness , because the strength of the U.S. economy and the recent rise in U.S. interest_rates normally would be expected to boost the dollar ' s value . The Administration ' s sudden decision to defend the dollar stems in part from fears of higher inflation , because a weak dollar raises import prices in the United States . A weak dollar also makes foreigners less willing to invest here . Also , there is a widespread feeling that a rapid decline in the dollar , as with any other financial asset , would be dangerous for the global financial system . &quot; Two things are in the interest of all ( industrialized ) nations , &quot; said John Williams , chief economist at Bankers Trust . &quot; One is stability in foreign_exchange markets and the second is the case that a stronger dollar is appropriate to slow the U.S. economy and help spur other economies. &quot; A stronger dollar could lower prices of goods imported into the United States , helping European and Japanese manufacturers while making_it harder for U.S. manufacturers to raise prices . In the bond market , where the dollar ' s weakness had raised concerns about an outflow of foreign capital from U.S. bonds , yields stabilized Wednesday . The yield on the 30-year Treasury_bond slipped to 7.33 % from 7.34 % on Tuesday , after challenging the 7.40 % level at midday . But Robert Hormats , vice_chairman of Goldman Sachs , said the bond market ' s rather unenthusiastic response signaled a judgment that &quot; the intervention will not be sustained or not work. &quot; Bonds were also helped by news of weaker-than-expected April car sales , which hinted at slower economic_growth . In other bond market news , the Treasury said it will sell $ 29 billion of government_securities next week . Meanwhile , on Wall_Street , blue_chip stocks eased after three days of gains . Losers outnumbered winners by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock_Exchange . Smaller stocks fared better : The Nasdaq composite index inched up 0.93 point to 740.30. Some traders said investors were beginning to focus_on the possibility that higher interest_rates and a strong dollar will significantly slow the economy later this year . Among the market highlights : * Many industrial issues closed lower , led by auto_makers . Ford lost 1 to 60 , GM fell 5 / 8 to 56 3 / 4 and Chrysler was off 1 / 8 to 47 . Among other industrials , Air Products &amp; Chemicals dropped 1 5 / 8 to 41 1 / 4 , Varity fell 7 / 8 to 38 , Monsanto slid 1 to 81 1 / 2 and Phelps Dodge sank 3 / 4 to 56 3 / 8 . * In another health_care takeover , Allied Clinical Labs surged 5 3 / 8 to 22 5 / 8 on a takeover offer from National Health Laboratories , which ended off 1 / 8 to 11 3 / 4 . * Among Southland issues , First Interstate Bancorp rose 1 3 / 4 to 82 3 / 4 after its chairman said the bank expects to exceed recently revised 1994 earnings estimates . Also , brokerage Jefferies Group leaped 2 7 / 8 to 43 7 / 8 . It sold 3.7 million shares of its Investment Technology Group division to investors in a new stock offering . The stock , offered at 13 , jumped to close at 16 1 / 4 in Nasdaq trading . Overseas , Hong Kong stocks finished near their lows for the year , with the Hang Seng index plunging 309.69 points to 8 # 369.44. In London , the FTSE-100 index fell 29.5 points to 3 # 070.5 while Frankfurt ' s DAX index eased 3.27 points to 2 # 249.02. Mexico_City ' s Bolsa index was off 4.11 points at 2 # 235.12. The Tokyo market was closed for the &quot; Golden Week &quot; holidays . * AVERTING CRISIS : Nations propped the dollar to boost world ' s economy . A1</TEXT>
