   <HEADLINE> BRIEFCASE : MARKETING AND MEDIA ; EL POLLO LOCO CROSSES THE BORDER FOR ITS NEW AD_CAMPAIGN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> El Pollo Loco -- apparently speedier than fast-food competitors who pretend to run_for the border -- has actually crossed over into Mexico -- for its ads . The Irvine-based company has filmed its newest TV commercials at Rosarito Beach . Scenes of busy Mexican streets dominate the 30-second spots , as chefs prepare food in an open-air restaurant . The ads , which began airing Sunday , promote the chain ' s new tacos al carbon and &quot; make_it abundantly clear that we ' re very , very different from Taco Bell , Del Taco , KFC or anyone else , &quot; said Louis Franson , the company ' s marketing director . The ads , in English , were created by Irvine agency dGWB , under the direction of Mandi Dossin , vice_president . El Pollo Loco also plans to launch a Spanish-language campaign later this month , which emphasizes family dining , authenticity and value . The ads are being produced by Casanova Pendrill Publicidad in Irvine , under the direction of Peggy Goff , vice_president .</TEXT>
