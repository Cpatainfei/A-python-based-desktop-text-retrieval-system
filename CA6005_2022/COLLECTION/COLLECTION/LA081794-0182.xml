   <HEADLINE> PARTY_LINES GETTING TANGLED AMID CRIME BILL HAGGLING ; POLITICS : THE FINAL DEBATE TAKES ON A CONTRARIAN QUALITY . REPUBLICANS ARE BACKING POSITIONS ONCE CHAMPIONED BY DEMOCRATS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No one expects consistency in politics , but the last round of debate over the $ 33.2-billion crime bill is beginning to resemble a hall of mirrors . On two key provisions , Republican leaders are attacking the final legislation with arguments that the Administration itself once raised -- and criticizing language other Republicans helped to write into the bill . The Republican accusations that the legislation does not offer enough community protection against sexual offenders substantially echoes concerns that the Administration itself voiced months ago . And the provisions under_attack from Republican leaders for potentially releasing convicted drug offenders from jail were drafted with the support of leading Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee -- over the Administration ' s objections . In both cases , the Administration , in_effect , is now under pressure from the GOP to adopt positions close to its own original preferences in the bill . But steering the legislation in that direction , on either front , risks angering liberals who rejected the Administration ' s positions in the first place . Moreover , on both counts , the Administration views the Republican objections as exaggerating the impact of the disputed provisions : &quot; The bigger flaw is that there are mountains being made of these molehills , &quot; said one senior Justice_Department official . Even so , the Administration is willing to satisfy the GOP critics on at least the so-called &quot; sexual predator &quot; provisions . Rep . Dick Zimmer ( R-N.J. ) said Tuesday night that President Clinton had called to tell him the Administration would accept the changes in the measure that Republicans are seeking . On the House floor Thursday , Republicans argued that the final legislation undermined efforts to encourage community notification when a sexual offender moves_into a neighborhood after release from prison . This emotional dispute revolves_around the way the House-Senate conference committee blended two bills that aimed to encourage states to track individuals with records of sexual offenses or crimes against children . The first bill -- the so-called &quot; Jacob Wetterling Act &quot; sponsored by Minnesota GOP Rep . Jim Ramstad and GOP Sen . Dave Durenberger -- encouraged states to establish a registry to keep track of individuals with a record of crimes against children ; both houses approved that measure . Last fall the Senate also passed an amendment to the crime bill from Sen . Slade Gorton ( R-Wash. ) that established a second registry for offenders convicted of sex crimes against victims of any age . The House-Senate conferees decided that it made no sense to establish two registries for such offenders , instead creating one larger registry covering both groups of offenders . But in combining the bills , the conferees took provisions from the Republican-sponsored &quot; Jacob Wetterling Act &quot; in two key instances that were more narrow than the broader requirements established under the Gorton legislation . It is those provisions from the Gorton amendment that Republicans are now clamoring to include in the final bill . In the Gorton bill , a so-called &quot; sexual predator &quot; would be required to notify law_enforcement officials of his address every three months for the rest of his life . The conferees had accepted the Wetterling provision that required only annual notification for 10 years . More important to the critics , the conferees rejected language in the Gorton amendment to guide the release of information to communities about sexual offenders obtained for the new state registries . As is often the case in polarizing Washington battles , the dispute boils_down to an interpretation of a_few words : The Gorton bill says that information can be released to &quot; protect the public ; &quot; the final bill ( drawing_on language in the Wetterling bill ) says that it can be released only for &quot; law_enforcement purposes. &quot; Critics of the final bill maintain that there is a large difference . The standard of protecting the public would encourage officials to widely distribute information to a community where a sexual offender has located , while the standard in the final bill might impede such efforts , they maintain . In fact , Administration and congressional sources said , Rep . Don Edwards ( D-San Jose ) and other House liberals did intend to narrow the Gorton provision ' s scope , fearing that it would lead to incidents like the recent case in Washington state , where a sex offender whose release was made public under that state ' s disclosure law had his home burned_down in the Seattle suburbs . At the time , the Administration took a position not unlike the one GOP critics are taking now . In its formal comments to the conference committee in June , the Administration expressed concern that the privacy provisions in the bills might interfere with state programs to disseminate information about sex offenders to &quot; school authorities or victims of earlier offenses. &quot; Even so , Administration officials said they doubt that the final bill represents as substantial a change from the Gorton version as Republicans contend . The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children has concluded , they noted , that the &quot; law_enforcement purposes &quot; standard in the final legislation would not impede existing community notification programs in the states . The struggle over mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenders has an equally convoluted history . House Republican Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia has repeatedly condemned the conference bill ' s provision that could lead to freeing low-level , nonviolent drug offenders without serious prior records from lengthy mandatory minimum prison sentences . &quot; It would release over 10 # 000 drug dealers who are currently in prison , &quot; Gingrich said recently . &quot; We are prepared to go_to the country and say : ' Releasing 10 # 000 drug dealers is not anti-crime. ' &quot; But two of Gingrich ' s fellow House Republicans , conservatives Bill McCollum of Florida and Henry J . Hyde of Illinois , voted for making retroactive the drug offender release provision that Gingrich condemns . On the other hand , the Administration opposed this feature , arguing instead that it should apply only to those who violate drug laws after the bill is enacted . Even so , the Administration does not believe that the provision would have nearly the impact Gingrich suggests . Based on federal prison statistics , the Justice_Department estimates that between 100 and 535 prisoners could win immediate release . By 1999 , the number would be between 2 # 000 and 3 # 000 . The notion of softening punishment of nonviolent , minor drug offenders emerged as a compromise to proposals in the House to eliminate mandatory-minimum sentences entirely on grounds that they were using_up scarce prison space needed for more serious and violent lawbreakers and keeping lesser criminals behind bars for longer than they deserved . After hearings on mandatory minimums by the House Judiciary crime subcommittee headed by Rep . Charles E . Schumer ( D-N.Y. ) , a middle ground won bipartisan support : Low-level offenders serving a mandatory minimum could ask a court to be released , citing such factors as no prior serious criminal_record , or no firearm or violence involved in the crime . Over Administration objections , however , the conference bill adopted the retroactive provision and Gingrich had a powerful one-liner about freeing 10 # 000 drug dealers . Yet , said a senior White_House official , Republicans appear less interested in the issue off-camera : &quot; It has not come_up in our meetings , &quot; the official said .</TEXT>
