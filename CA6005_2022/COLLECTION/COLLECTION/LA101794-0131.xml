   <HEADLINE> FINNISH VOTERS APPROVE JOINING THE EUROPEAN UNION ; POLITICS : REFERENDUM RESULT CHANGES NATION ' S COLD_WAR STATUS AS BUFFER BETWEEN EAST AND WEST . SWEDEN , NORWAY VOTE NEXT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Finnish voters Sunday gave a clear &quot; yes &quot; to European Union membership in a development that will alter the political map of Europe and open a new era for Finland . After a long , intensely debated campaign , Finns voted 57 % to 43 % in favor of joining the EU in January under terms negotiated by the Finnish government earlier this year . It was only the second national referendum in the country ' s history ( the first , in 1931 , repealed prohibition ) and was widely perceived as the most important single decision the Finnish electorate has ever been asked to decide . The result reduces a mandatory parliamentary vote on the issue to little more_than formality . &quot; For the first time ever , the Finnish people have decided for themselves which road the country should follow at this crucial stage in the history of our continent , &quot; Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari said in a televised address to the nation . &quot; The result is politically and morally binding on the Parliament , the president and the government. &quot; * Sunday ' s vote brings the Nordic nation of 5 million people into the mainstream of European political events for the first time , effectively ending its long and unique Cold_War role as a buffer between East and West . As such , Sunday ' s result marks one more step_in the gradual dismantling of the order that shaped Europe for 4 1 / 2 decades between the end of World_War_II in 1945 and the collapse of communism in 1989 . The Finnish &quot; yes &quot; vote carries other important ramifications for Europe . Among them : * It radically alters the geography of the European Union , extending its borders well into the Arctic for the first time and giving it its first common frontier with Russia , a border running_for more_than 700 miles . * Together with Austria , which voted to join in a referendum in June , it provides an important psychological boost for advocates of a more unified Europe . * It heightens the prospects that Sweden and Norway might vote to join the EU in similar referendums scheduled for next month , and the prime_ministers of both countries welcomed the Finnish result , saying they hoped that it will encourage a &quot; yes &quot; vote_in their nations . The Austrian and Finnish votes were purposely scheduled first in hopes of undercutting opponents of EU membership who have a far stronger base in Sweden and Norway . A &quot; yes &quot; vote_in all four nations would boost the number of nations in the EU from 12 to 16 , increase its land mass by half and add 25 million consumers and $ 500 billion to the annual gross_domestic_product of what is already the world ' s largest , richest single market . More important for American exporters , the addition of a group of traditionally free-trading nations would tilt the balance_of_power within the EU , where debates on greater openness on trade issues have traditionally split between the more liberal northern countries and those in the Mediterranean south that tend to advocate more restrictive policies . Interviews outside polling_stations in suburban Helsinki indicated that , despite the clear &quot; yes &quot; majority , many had agonized until the last minute before making their decision . &quot; I thought_about it a lot last night , and this morning I still didn ' t know , but in the end I voted yes , &quot; said Birgit Lindstroem , a retired librarian and a member of the country ' s Swedish minority . &quot; It ' s better for Finland because we won ' t be alone. &quot; While nearly half of Finland ' s trade is with the nations of the EU , pure economic factors seemed to play a secondary role in the Finnish decision . Instead , it was the issue of national security that seemed to be decisive . The EU , with its commitment to developing a common foreign and security policy , seemed to offer a rare chance to escape Russian influence for a nation that has lived_in Moscow ' s orbit for most of the last two centuries . &quot; It ' s politics and security that ' s driving us , &quot; said Hannu Olkinoure , editor of the country ' s largest business newspaper , Kauppalehti . &quot; Something in me says there is a certain momentum , a chance for us to point_out that we belong_to the Western_Hemisphere before Russia gets stronger. &quot;</TEXT>
