   <HEADLINE> THE NHL / HELENE ELLIOTT ; IN FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT , LEAGUE STILL HAS PUNCH_LINE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For all_the traditionalists , all_the Don Cherry fans who predicted that the NHL would become soft under an American commissioner , fear not . Fighting is actually on the rise this season , judging from the 41 % increase in major fighting penalties assessed through Sunday . In 651 games , 1 # 056 fighting majors had been handed_out , contrasted with 747 fighting majors in 651 games last season . That should keep all_the makers of fight tapes in business and delight Cherry , the acerbic TV analyst who proclaimed that the NHL was_on the verge of becoming a pacifists ' paradise . NHL executives say the new numbers reflect increased competitiveness . Divisional rivalries always fostered rough stuff , but conference rankings now determine playoff seedings instead of division standings . There are more intraconference games than intradivision games , providing more opportunities for fisticuffs . &quot; I think it ' s because of the conference format , and I think it should level_off as teams establish those turf battles , &quot; said Brian Burke , NHL senior_vice_president and director of hockey operations . &quot; If it doesn ' t , then we have to find_out what the reason is. &quot; Commissioner Gary Bettman said his priority is to eliminate &quot; extracurriculars , &quot; such_as head-butts , checks from behind and dangerous stickwork , through supplementary discipline -- meaning suspensions -- before he deals with fighting . &quot; We had eight suspensions in October , eight in November , three in December and two in January , one of which ( Rick Zombo ' s slash of Kevin Collins ) could have been a rulebook suspension , &quot; Bettman said . &quot; At this particular point_in_time we ' re not focused_on that ( fighting ) issue . At some point we ' ll study it , because at some point we ' re going to study everything. &quot; That study would find players opposed to a ban on fighting . &quot; I don ' t think you can ever take it out of the game , &quot; Detroit defenseman Paul Coffey said . &quot; It ' s probably not as premeditated as in the past . You ' ll see a_couple_of guys fight for 30 seconds and it ' s over . If you talk to a lot of players , you ' ll find they ' ll take a punch_in the head over a stick_in the face or stick_in the groin. &quot; STANDARDS , PLEASE We can live with flying ducks making hokey entrances at Anaheim Arena and with Harvey the Hound , the Calgary Flames ' mascot , doing a mock striptease by hiking_up his costume pants and twirling his dog_collar in the air . But sumo hockey , that ' s time to draw_the_line . A new intermission show around the NHL features two contestants , dressed like the Michelin tire man and wearing sumo wrestler headgear , &quot; playing &quot; hockey . With their bulk , all they do is slip-slide along the ice as they shoot the puck into nets set against the side boards . When they fall , they struggle like turtles to get_up . All this for the glory of a certain beer . Yes , fans deserve to be entertained all night when they shell_out big bucks for tickets . But there must be something better than that . CAPITAL_OFFENSES They tried Bryan Murray . They tried his brother , Terry Murray . And still the Washington Capitals can ' t get past the early rounds of the playoffs . They passed_up Winnipeg assistant Andy Murray ( no relation ) when they fired Terry Murray and lured Jim Schoenfeld out of the ESPN booth to coach . Washington hasn ' t missed the playoffs since 1982 , but would be an outsider if the season were to end today . Schoenfeld , a fiery leader in Buffalo and New Jersey , has an emotional spark the listless Capitals need . The key is whether he has learned to temper his impatience , which undermined his stay with the_Devils and led to his firing 14 games into the 1989-90 season . Even if he succeeds , it might be too late to save General_Manager David Poile , whose contract is up at season ' s end . Schoenfeld ' s return is likely to increase sales of diet programs among referees . Remember , Schoenfeld earned hockey immortality during the 1988 playoffs when he screamed at Don Koharski , &quot; Have another doughnut , you fat pig. &quot; You ' ve got_to love a guy who finds that the worst thing he can say . HOLD THAT MIKE Schoenfeld joins a parade of broadcasters leaving studios and press tables to coach . Pat Riley of the New York Knicks , Quinn Buckner of the Dallas Mavericks and Mike Fratello of the Cleveland Cavaliers made the jump in the NBA . The NHL ' s list includes Jacques Demers , who did radio work between leaving the Red Wings in 1990 and joining the Montreal Canadiens in ' 92 ; and Mike Keenan , who was a radio and TV analyst between jobs with the Chicago Blackhawks and New York Rangers . TIP OF THE SALARY CAP League officials were furious when the NHL Players Assn . spread word it had rejected a collective_bargaining proposal that involved a salary cap . As the league saw it , that violated an agreement to avoid commenting on talks . It won ' t help the tone of negotiations , which resume today . The association is adamant about rejecting any form of cap , but Bettman is expected to press for it , and the possibility of a player strike increases with every verbal salvo . So does the pessimism of Ranger fans , who figure that since the only thing that can keep them from winning the Stanley Cup is a strike , a strike is sure to be called . Two years ago , the Rangers finished first overall but were thrown_off stride by a brief April walkout and lost in the second round of the playoffs . SLAP SHOTS The Mighty Ducks believe the NHL is discriminating against them by assigning young , inexperienced referees to their games . They have a point : In 27 of their 45 games , the referee had two years ' experience or less . Also , neither Kerry Fraser nor Andy van Hellemond , considered the top referees , has worked_at Anaheim Arena , although every referee is supposed to work everywhere once . &quot; It ' s a concern , &quot; General_Manager Jack Ferreira said of the assignments . . . . The Rangers had a deal with the Vancouver Canucks for center Petr Nedved but backed_out when Nedved ' s agent , Tony Kondel , demanded a $ 1.4-million payment and more in performance bonuses . . . . The Toronto Maple Leafs will have to sustain their 7-0-3 streak without defenseman Bob Rouse , who had arthroscopic knee surgery and is out at least two weeks . . . . Roger Neilson ' s defensive system isn ' t pretty , but Florida keeps winning . The Panthers have given_up only 17 goals during their 5-0-4 surge , the longest unbeaten streak ever by an expansion club .</TEXT>
