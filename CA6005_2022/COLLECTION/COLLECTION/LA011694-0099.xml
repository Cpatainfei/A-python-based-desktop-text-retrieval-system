   <HEADLINE> LOVE GOD FROM HELL ; THE MAN WHO BROUGHT YOU VIDEODATING HATES TO DATE , LOVES TO TAUNT AND HAS HIMSELF BEEN UNLUCKY IN LOVE . WOULD YOU BUY A RELATIONSHIP FROM JEFFREY ULLMAN ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The big man with the heart-shaped cuff links sits in his spacious Encino office , a &quot; Get-a-Woman-Flames-of-Desire &quot; candle on his desk , a rubbing of Rudolph Valentino ' s headstone on his wall and two middle-aged businessmen in his clutches . The men have come_to ask Jeffrey Ullman , the king of videodating , about buying a franchise . They have yellow legal pads on their laps , tassels on their loafers . Zany they aren ' t . But Ullman , founder of the world ' s largest singles introduction service , can ' t help himself . Midway through a discussion of royalties and fees , he lets a phone_call from his publicist divert him from the business at_hand to a favorite topic : aphrodisiacs . He launches into a rapid-fire rant , pacing the room as he prattles on about ginseng syrup , bone_marrow jelly and chestnuts steeped in Muscadet . &quot; According to the no-nonsense Elizabethans , chestnuts -- being flatulent -- incite Venus , &quot; Ullman says , reading gleefully from a love potion cookbook . &quot; I never heard of gas getting your rocks off ! that ' s a good one ! &quot; His guests swap terrified looks . And then , suddenly , Ullman ' s back on track . Las Vegas , he tells the businessmen , is_on the smaller side , but it ' s ripe for the business of love . Salt_Lake_City , too . They ' re big on marriage in Utah . Plunk a franchise in there , Ullman says , hire a_few Mormons and you ' ll never look_back . &quot; Any virgin area left in New Jersey ? &quot; asks one of the men , much relieved to be discussing the commercial , not the carnal , side of passion . &quot; Nope , &quot; says Ullman happily , biting into a turkey sandwich as he sketches out the geographical sweep of his growing empire , Great Expectations . But there ' s always Honolulu or Charlotte , he says . With the right management team , even Oklahoma_City could be a gold mine . The men seem impressed . It looks as if Ullman has sold them on taking video-assisted coupling into the heartland . He talked tough and refused to bargain . He spoke their language -- the lexicon of the bottom_line . But even as he cements the connection , he is compelled to test it one more time . Reaching_into his desk drawer , he pulls_out two foil-wrapped packets . &quot; Condom ? &quot; he asks . YOU MAY NEVER HAVE HEARD OF JEFFREY ULLMAN , BUT CHANCES ARE you ' ve gotten his mail . &quot; Where do You Go To Meet Quality Single People Like Yourself ? &quot; asks one Great Expectations direct-mail letter , which touts the merits of choosing a mate via videotape . &quot; No more uncomfortable blind_dates , &quot; the mailer promises . &quot; No more wasted time in singles bars . No more losers. &quot; Ullman is the man behind the pitch , which he has sent_out 500 million times during the past decade . At 44 , he leads the videodating industry , which he pioneered in his native Los Angeles in 1976 . He and his franchisees own 45 Great Expectations Centres in the United States and one in Mexico . His company , which claims to have more_than 150 # 000 members , takes credit for thousands of marriages and grosses about $ 65 million a year . In 18 years , Ullman ' s invention has done more_than change the way some heterosexuals get lucky . For better or worse , it has become an integral part of American culture . And Ullman , a fast-talking , self-described &quot; social-change activist , &quot; is a big reason why . Ullman preaches the gospel of self-improvement , and he has a knack for turning almost any trend to his advantage . Feminism ? It ' s made dating confusing , he says , all_the more reason that singles need high-tech help . Yuppie materialism ? People who work all_the time , he says , need an efficient way to meet . AIDS ? Casual sex is out , he says , marriage is in . &quot; I ' m going_to marry America , &quot; he says . &quot; Why not ? &quot; that ' s where Great Expectations comes_in . Ullman says losers become winners simply by joining . Great Expectations members don ' t all find mates , he acknowledges . But at least they surmount what Ullman calls the biggest obstacle , &quot; coming forward and saying , ' I ' m ready. ' &quot; And at about $ 2 # 000 per three-year membership , that makes him a big winner as well . Ullman has become a millionaire by following his own advice . He never tries , he says , he does . He has little patience for weakness . He balks at timidity . He is an &quot; emotional provocateur , &quot; he says , whose &quot; involving confrontational &quot; style forces people to realize their opportunities . But the self-anointed Love God has a problem . His in-your-face ethic has helped build a thriving business . And at times , it has also made him insufferable . Ullman is a goofus . Once , when he needed to borrow $ 300 # 000 , he wore a clear plastic tie filled with shredded dollar_bills to a meeting with a banker . Another time , just for fun , he bit into a fake blood capsule and began frothing at the mouth and screaming . The nurses at the blood_bank where he pulled this stunt are still talking_about it , he says . Worse , Ullman-the-prankster shares a brain with Ullman-the-bully . He has made his employees cry -- a habit that once got him banned from visiting his centers . Years ago , he laid_off his own mother . Then , after giving her another chance , he booted her again . &quot; Ultimately , I had to say , ' You just don ' t get_it , Mom . You ' re fired , ' &quot; he says . He was no easier on his sister , who until 1984 was a Great Expectations vice_president . &quot; She was excessively overweight , &quot; Ullman recalls . &quot; I don ' t just mean overweight . I mean , her clothing , her hair , her nails -- she would n ' t wear hose . She was a lesbian ! I didn ' t care about that , but it showed . &quot; Today , Ullman ' s sister calls him a &quot; rage-o-holic. &quot; His longtime assistant calls him &quot; very offensive. &quot; And his wives ? Ullman may call himself an expert on courtship , they say , but his three marriages have faltered . He seems to mean well , and he certainly does_well . But whether Ullman is mean-spirited or merely tactless , whether he is driven by profit or a pure desire to join the world in wedlock , would you buy a relationship from this man ? TELEVISION TALK-SHOW HOST MONTEL WILLIAMS once asked Ullman : &quot; Are you preying on the lonely people out there ? &quot; &quot; Yes , &quot; he shot back . &quot; Just like restaurants prey on the hungry and doctors prey on the sick and talk-show hosts prey on the people who are too bored to read a book. &quot; But restaurants sell food . Doctors sell medicine . What , exactly , is Ullman selling ? This weekday evening , the Great Expectations Centre in West Los Angeles is bustling with men and women . Many of them are attractive . All of them are available . But no one is making small_talk . The place is hushed as they flip through three-ring binders containing thousands of all-important first impressions , otherwise known as Member Profiles . The Member Profile -- a one-page autobiography , with photo -- is the backbone of the Great Expectations system . Like the label on a can of soup , it lists basic ingredients -- height , weight , religious preference -- and gives some qualitative data . Members briefly describe &quot; Who I Am , &quot; &quot; What I Like To Do &quot; and &quot; What I ' m Looking For. &quot; &quot; I am as wild as they come , &quot; writes Alfonso , a fourth-grade teacher . Alan , a novelist and TV producer , promises that he ' s not &quot; the kind of guy who keeps his emotions so subterranean you need to go spelunking to find them or a Rosetta stone to interpret them. &quot; Asked what she ' s looking_for , a marriage counselor named Jody simply writes &quot; a fireman. &quot; If intrigued by a written profile , a member can cue up a video for closer inspection . There , Ullman promises a window into the soul . A video interview , he has said , &quot; shows appearance , animation , personality , charm and all_of the ambitions , desires , dreams , wants and needs which can be hidden in the ordinary social contacts. &quot; Ullman may overstate . Despite his interviewers ' attempts to prompt fascinating answers -- &quot; When you meet that special woman , &quot; goes one interview question , &quot; are you going_to know it right off ? &quot; -- not everybody shines on videotape . And not everybody tells the truth . &quot; One guy picked me . He said he was in PR . He said he was 5-foot-9 , &quot; says Barbara Lakin , a photo editor at TriStar Pictures , who describes her recent one-year Great Expectations membership as &quot; a joke. &quot; &quot; It turned_out he was a limo driver . And he was like 5-foot-3 ! &quot; Still , there ' s no denying that videotape can be very revealing . Alfonso-the-wild-man , for example , confesses on his video that he takes women to karaoke bars on the first date and that he would never , ever jump_out of an airplane for fun . &quot; People lie all_the time , &quot; says Bonnie Beaux Fullerton , a Costa Mesa comedian who met her husband , a chemist , through Great Expectations . What ' s more , some folks just aren ' t themselves on videotape . &quot; It ' s an unnatural thing for people , &quot; she says . &quot; You ' d see the little sweat balls on their upper lips. &quot; But Fullerton is definitely the consumer Ullman courts . &quot; People join GE to meet someone , get_married and have a family . That was my intention , &quot; she says . Victor Ramirez , a contract administrator who lives_in Diamond Bar , felt the same way . Friends said he was too good a catch to need the help of an introduction service . But he wanted to get serious about his love life . The bar scene was inefficient . &quot; I don ' t want a series of one-night stands , &quot; says Ramirez , who compared the price of a Great Expectations membership to &quot; going_out once a week to a nightclub , where I don ' t meet anybody. &quot; He concluded that videodating was more cost-effective . &quot; You can screen women . And there are plenty , &quot; he says , flipping through a binder . Several weeks later , he is still flipping . &quot; I ' ve met 10 different women in 2 1 / 2 months , &quot; he says . &quot; I ' m getting what I want out of it. &quot; How do you measure the success of such a system ? If he fried fast food , Ullman says , he ' d count burgers sold . Instead , he counts marriages . Metal on the finger is the ultimate goal , and Ullman employs two full-time coordinators of so-called &quot; Success Stories &quot; to track the nuptials . Ullman believes that the number of weddings now tops 10 # 000 , but because not all centers have kept continuous records , he can only provide the names of several thousand . He also offers no data on his rate of success ; Ullman says he hasn ' t kept a total of how many people have joined Great Expectations , so it ' s impossible to do the math . His statistics , or lack of them , may raise a_few eyebrows . And then there ' s the_matter of_his_own romantic record . Divorced twice , he separated from his third wife last fall . &quot; I ' ve been too willing to enter into marriage without carefully evaluating what was really there , &quot; he says . &quot; I ' ve been guilty of the following three things : 1 ) I can change her , 2 ) She will change or 3 ) I will change . Only a fool will follow those and I have been a thrice fool. &quot; But all that is irrelevant , he insists , to the workings of Great Expectations . &quot; There ' s an old line of ' Doctor , heal thyself. ' ( But ) is Jeffrey Ullman hypocritical ? The answer is no , &quot; he says . &quot; I ' m here to stimulate . I ' m here to inform . I ' m here to educate . But I ' m not here to say , ' Follow me. ' I don ' t say that. &quot; And therein lies Ullman ' s genius . While he markets himself as a modern-day Cupid ( a mural on his boardroom ceiling features the winged cherub , topped with Ullman ' s 6-month-old face ) , he never guarantees love . &quot; Great Expectations is not a ' just-add-water-for-an-instant-relationship ' service , &quot; warns a guidebook for new members . &quot; Used correctly , it provides wonderful results . Used incorrectly , it may_not . . . . It ' s up_to you what the results will be. &quot; No , Ullman never says , &quot; Follow me. &quot; He says : Pay me , then do your best . If you fail , you have only yourself to blame . ULLMAN HAS A WACKY IDEA . LET ' S CALL EX-WIFE NUMERO UNO , HE SAYS , punching the number of a San Francisco hospital into his speaker phone . Patrice Chapman , an executive_secretary , answers on the first ring . &quot; Department of surgery , &quot; she says . &quot; Yes , &quot; Ullman says , flashing a big grin . &quot; I ' m looking_for a vasectomy . I know a big dick. &quot; &quot; I do , too , &quot; Chapman replies , not missing a beat . &quot; Hi , Jeff. &quot; Chapman and Ullman were college sweethearts . They lived together in a commune in Berkeley , rallied in People ' s Park , marched against the Vietnam_War . In 1973 , when they married in Rough and Ready ( a town in California ' s Gold Country chosen for its weird name ) , Ullman arranged to capture his wedding on videotape . He first experimented with video while studying journalism at UC Berkeley . The technology was new -- the portable cameras were unwieldy , the quality was poor . But Ullman says he had a hunch that it could be used to help people solve their problems . Who would n ' t pay money for that ? He headed to the golf_course . Want to fix that slice , he asked the guys on the green . For $ 25 an hour , he ' d let them scrutinize themselves on instant replay . Tennis_players , too , paid to watch themselves swing . The experiments weren ' t lucrative -- to make a living , Ullman was a traveling teflon salesman . But all_the while , he was searching for a video niche . At a dinner_party in 1975 , a friend helped him find it . Meeting men , she said , was a drag . Blind_dates were too awkward . Chance encounters were too risky . &quot; Well , &quot; Ullman blurted_out , &quot; advertise. &quot; And that ' s when it hit him . Why not use television , the most powerful advertising medium of all , to troll for mates ? Ullman was raised to be his brother ' s keeper , he says , to make a contribution , to do the right thing . As a child growing_up in Los Angeles , he had wanted to be a doctor , a civil-rights lawyer , maybe even a congressman . But in video , he says , he found his true calling . &quot; I realized it really wasn ' t politics for me , &quot; he says . &quot; It was communication. &quot; In 1976 , with a start-up loan from his parents , Ullman ' s Great Expectations was born in a windowless office in Century City . It was to be a family project -- in fact , only Ullman ' s brother , Dana , never worked for the company . His father , Sandy , a pediatrician , came_up with the name . His mother , Estelle , was his first employee -- though for the first lean year , she donated her time , mostly working one on one with members . Chapman , his bride , helped with the books . But just two years later , as his business grew , Ullman ' s marriage fell_apart . The problem : She was &quot; a hippie at heart , &quot; Chapman says , &quot; not the least bit competitive or aggressive. &quot; And Ullman was fast becoming a relentless yuppie . Stephanie Sharp ( Member 1280 ) seemed different , Ullman says . They met when Sharp , a high_school teacher , signed_up with Great Expectations in 1978 . A year later , they began dating . &quot; Stephanie was a woman who accepted my business . I saw in her unadulterated , complete acceptance . I was enamored , &quot; he says . They married on Valentine ' s Day , 1981 , and overnight , Sharp became more_than just a wife . She was a marketer ' s dream . She posed for promotional photos with Ullman . He mentioned her during his increasingly frequent television appearances . &quot; Thousands of couples , including myself , have gotten_married through Great Expectations , &quot; he told talk-show host Jane Whitney . Soon , he would share the airwaves with Geraldo , Merv , Oprah , Phil and Sally , tossing_off his spontaneous , over-the-top humor and advice that -- while sometimes unnerving in_person -- made_for undeniably snappy television . In 1983 , sales of Great Expectations franchises took_off . Suddenly , Orange County , Mountain View and San Diego , which had sold in the late ' 70s , were joined by Houston , Portland , Chicago , Seattle and Walnut Creek . At the same time , Ullman was experimenting with direct mail . These were &quot; the golden years , &quot; he recalls , when the novelty of receiving unsolicited junk in the mailbox had not yet worn_off . &quot; Finally . An intelligent way to meet people , &quot; gushed one of the early mailers , which helped make him a millionaire . But yet again , Ullman ' s financial successes were accompanied by personal problems . He and his mother were at_odds . &quot; My mother wanted to put her arms around the company , &quot; he says , recalling how she loved to help pair people up instead of letting the system work_on its own . &quot; In many ways , she throttled the company. &quot; After he fired her the second time , they did not speak_for more_than a year -- though they made_peace before her death in 1985 . In the meantime , Ullman went_to_war with his sister , Dyan . By all accounts , she was a great interviewer and saleswoman . Warm and funny , she relaxed Great Expectations members and made them feel at_home . But since childhood she had been heavy , and that was something her big_brother couldn ' t abide . &quot; She was wonderful after you got_to know her , &quot; Ullman says . &quot; The problem is , you ' d look_at her and say , ' Oh , God ! ' &quot; Dyan is now a successful businesswoman in her own_right ; she and her partner , Terri Levine , own Just In Case , a Santa Monica luggage store . A decade has passed since Dyan left Great Expectations , and during that time -- including a period when the siblings sought joint counseling -- she has come_up with a theory about what makes her brother so fierce . &quot; Jeffrey doesn ' t think_about how you ' re going to feel . He believes you should take_care of_your_own feelings . He really does want you to be strong , &quot; she says , adding that he has always been this way , even as a child . &quot; Sometimes he seems to be incredibly proud_of being an asshole . Jeffrey would call it tough love . It just gets_to a point where you say , ' Do I want to be loved that way ? ' &quot; Dyan was apparently not the only one asking that question . In 1989 , Ullman ' s second wife filed for divorce . Sharp alleged , among other things , that Ullman was obsessed with polo -- they were members of the prestigious Santa Barbara Polo &amp; Racquet Club . She said Ullman worked too_much . She also accused him of physically abusing her , though she now says those charges were not true . &quot; I hired some cutthroat attorneys that put words in my mouth . That came from attorneys I ended_up firing , &quot; she says . Now , Sharp says she and Ullman get_along , sharing custody of their son , 10 , and daughter , 9 . &quot; He ' s been a very , very good parent . He enjoys doing kid-like things. &quot; Ullman sums_up his second marriage this way : &quot; I suffer from overconfidence . She suffers from underconfidence. &quot; And to hear him tell it , his third marriage -- to Robyn Santemire , whom he met when she worked as his personal assistant -- suffers from some of the same problems . Ullman thinks he knows the problem with his love relationships . He has been &quot; too entrepreneurial , &quot; he says , applying the same no-holds-barred , full-steam-ahead strategy to romance as he does to business . &quot; He puts 100 % into everything . He invests fully , &quot; Keith Granirer , Great Expectations ' chief financial / operating officer , says of Ullman ' s personal life . He concurs . &quot; I don ' t date , &quot; he says . &quot; I marry. &quot; The owner of the world ' s biggest dating service doesn ' t like dating ? &quot; that ' s right , &quot; he says . &quot; Margaret Mead was never really an aborigine , and look what she did. &quot; But if his third marriage ends , Ullman says he is going_to change his ways . &quot; If there is a mind-set for the ' 90s , it ' s that anything can be accomplished with an intelligent plan , &quot; says one of his recent brochures . And Ullman ' s plan is to embrace his own method and put himself on the market . For the first time , he ' s going_to join Great Expectations . IN THE MAIL COMES A VIDEOTAPE LABELED &quot; FOR MEN ONLY. &quot; IT IS AN infomercial for single men , hosted by a motivational speaker named Richard Gant . Ullman has just completed his latest infomercial , &quot; Romance , Reality and Results , &quot; so he is eager to get_a_look at the competition . He pops the tape into his office VCR and watches , amused , as Gant delivers his spiel to a group of well-coiffed young_men . Suddenly , one man speaks directly to the camera . Gant ' s tips , he says , are especially designed for people whose &quot; great expectations don ' t seem to pan out. &quot; Ullman erupts at the mention of his company ' s name . &quot; F--- you ! F--- you ! &quot; he screams at the television , a big , incredulous smile on his face . &quot; Who dresses you , bozo ? Mr. Polyester ? &quot; Ullman lives to be_on top . And he works hard at staying there . He spares no expense to investigate even the least-threatening rival . Smaller videodating companies are his primary competitors , and there are more of them than you ' d expect , all with optimistic names like Connections or Heart to Heart . But Ullman keeps_an_eye_on all methods of pairing up , from personals listings to computer dating to old-fashioned matchmakers . He ' s been known to put_on costumes to drop_in on competitors . And he has proven himself a formidable and unforgiving opponent . When VideoDate , one of Ullman ' s first rivals , went_out of business , he stopped by its empty offices and ripped the nameplate off the door . He keeps the wooden plaque as a trophy . Since then , scores of other Great Expectations knockoffs have failed . And when they do , Ullman is often there to buy them out , merging their membership lists with his own . He is driven by more_than money . Sure , Ullman lives comfortably in the San Fernando Valley , drives a new Cadillac , takes expensive vacations and collects African art . But his boundless desire to grow bigger makes him reinvest much of what he makes . &quot; His assets are all_in this company , &quot; says Granirer , the company ' s financial_officer . &quot; It ' s not about money at all for him . It ' s about building this company. &quot; Ullman has gone so far as_to sue the state of New York , seeking to strike_down an unusual law that places a $ 250 ceiling on fees charged by &quot; social-referral &quot; services . The cap has kept Great Expectations out of the Big Apple for too long , Ullman says . &quot; I want a bite. &quot; But he has learned that growth can be painful . Four years ago , his franchisees staged a revolt . They had paid as much as $ 55 # 000 apiece and were forking over as much as 10 % of their returns every month . With the recession , increased competition and a hike in direct-mail postage rates , they said , Ullman was demanding too_much . They threatened to strike and withhold their royalties . Ullman was angry . Still , in a departure from his usual combativeness , he opted for compromise , reducing royalty fees to 8 % and temporarily rebating 37.5 % of that money to an advertising fund that serves all Great Expectations operators . Today , he still chafes at the memory . &quot; They ' re quick to count my money , &quot; he says of his franchisees . &quot; They paid -- are paying -- money to be part of a system . To get_the_best of the best . They forever shall pay. &quot; But he acknowledges that the mutiny forced Great Expectations to grow_up : &quot; It has absolutely proven to be a win / win for both sides. &quot; Since then , he has distanced himself more and more from the daily management of his company , preferring instead to act_as Great Expectations ' chief spokesman and marketing guru . When a Santa Monica bank came_up with the ad slogan &quot; We handle more zeros than a dating service , &quot; for example , Ullman organized a demonstration on its doorstep , handing_out bumper stickers that proclaimed , &quot; I ' m no Zero. &quot; ( This ploy won him a mention in the Wall_Street Journal ) . Great Expectations has prompted its share of spoofs . When Johnny Carson received a mailer at his Malibu home , he filled_out the questionnaire live_on the &quot; Tonight Show. &quot; ( &quot; What am I looking_for in a mate ? &quot; he asked Ed McMahon . &quot; Someone who doesn ' t know the meaning of the word marriage . &quot; ) And TV ' s &quot; The Simpsons &quot; invented &quot; Low Expectations Dating Service , &quot; where members admit their flaws on videotape . Ullman loves the attention . He holds his head high . &quot; Of course , it lends itself to cynicism . Like , ' Great Expectations are followed by profound despair , ' &quot; he says . &quot; Well , yeah ? So ? We don ' t say , ' You pay your money and it ' s perfect. ' We ' re not a matchmaker. &quot; He reserves special scorn for matchmakers . He says their low-tech approach encourages singles to place too_much trust in a stranger ' s instincts . &quot; It ' s relationship fascism , &quot; he says , adding that matchmakers &quot; give you their opinion of what you like . I believe , as a child of the ' 60s , you should have power. &quot; Not surprisingly , Ullman has locked horns with a_few marriage_brokers . Christine O ' Keefe , for example , a Beverly Hills matchmaker , former Great Expectations executive_vice_president and author of &quot; How to Successfully Flirt , Date and Mate. &quot; Today , she says Ullman is among her dearest friends . But in 1988 , she sued him for , among other things , intentional infliction of emotional distress . When she worked for Ullman , she says , he heaped such brutal verbal abuse on his employees that she forbade him to visit his own centers . &quot; When he arrived on the scene , some people were just plain out frightened , &quot; she recalls . &quot; He is a terror as the boss . If he ever chooses another occupation , he could apply to be a terrorist and get the job. &quot; Eventually , O ' Keefe too felt the sting of Ullman ' s wrath . He refused to give her her last paycheck . &quot; He just said , ' Sue me , ' &quot; says O ' Keefe , who says Ullman eventually paid her a settlement and then called her to patch things up . &quot; He ' ll walk all_over you and he won ' t even look_back to see what he stepped on. &quot; But O ' Keefe , herself an ambitious businesswoman , still admires Ullman . &quot; I give him credit . He does_work his business. &quot; Helena Amram isn ' t so forgiving . The self-described spouse-hunter , who claims to have arranged 8 # 000 marriages around the world , has loathed Ullman since 1990 , when New York state sued Amram for overcharging and engaging in fraudulent business practices . A Manhattan judge later ordered her to refund dissatisfied customers . At the time , TV ' s &quot; A Current Affair &quot; aired a story on the lawsuit and asked Ullman for comment . Never one to pull a punch , he called Amram &quot; the Saddam Hussein of dating. &quot; A year later , at an L.A. trade show , Amram says Ullman added injury to insult by slapping her . He pleaded no contest to misdemeanor battery charges and was sentenced to community service . Still , he says , Amram was asking_for_it . &quot; She ' s less than one foot away from me , she spits at me -- a big loogie ! -- right between the eyes , &quot; he groans . Amram , a former gunboat sailor in the Israeli army who says her &quot; high-class &quot; clients pay as much as $ 50 # 000 , maintains that she is too_much of a lady to spit . In a civil suit filed_in 1992 , she claimed that Ullman ' s single slap shook loose her dental_implants , made her deaf in one ear , damaged her marriage and hurt her business . &quot; Who is he to beat me up ? &quot; she asks , sitting in her posh office just a stone ' s throw from Rodeo Drive . &quot; Jeffrey Ullman will pay , OK ? &quot; Amram has joined forces with Larry Hash , an Anaheim used-car salesman and Great Expectations member who is also suing Ullman . Ullman punched Hash twice in 1991 while Hash was picketing with a sign : &quot; I GOT RIPPED OFF BY GREAT EXPECTATIONS. &quot; ( Ullman says the blows came_after Hash whacked him with the sign. ) Hash and Amram have picketed Great Expectations together . And Amram has given Hash a free membership in her service -- though Hash reports that one recent date she arranged for him was &quot; so far off it was ridiculous. &quot; Ullman cackles when he hears this news . &quot; Larry is a loser in life , &quot; he says , and Amram is &quot; the vilest. &quot; &quot; I ' m dealing with nuts , &quot; he says with a shrug . IT IS LATE SUMMER WHEN the Great Expectations family descends upon the wildflower-strewn mountains of Vail , Colo . The occasion : the annual franchisee conference , a once-a-year pep talk , strategy meeting and gripe session that this year draws about 80 Great Expectations franchise owners and employees from around North_America . At this four-day meeting , Ullman plans to declare war on bad service . His corporate staff has been preparing presentations for weeks . The Ballistic Service Training Series , for instance , will use a military theme to drive_home the importance of serving clients better . ( &quot; I ' ve got a strobe light and a recording of bombs exploding , &quot; explains the woman who thought_up this gimmick . &quot; It ' s going_to be a major wake-up call. &quot; ) But before the shelling can begin , Ullman has a_few things to get_off his chest . &quot; Many of you , I think , at times laugh_at me in a very dispiriting and mocking way , &quot; he says at the opening session . &quot; ' Who ' s that egotistical fool ? ' ' Who ' s that guy who continues to put his name , picture and face on everything ? ' Well , it ' s the same guy who gets hate mail . It ' s the same guy who ' s been spit on by competitors ( and ) hit over the head by an angry member. &quot; The franchisee / franchiser relationship , he continues , is very much like a marriage . If both partners don ' t pull their weight , there ' s bound to be trouble . &quot; We ' re at a crossroads right now -- at a pivotal place , &quot; he tells his troops . He shifts gears to talk_about the future , but he can ' t resist a final poke_at the past . &quot; What happened in 1990 set our entire company back , &quot; he says , referring to the franchisee revolt . &quot; It had to happen . I accept that . ( But ) it changed my life . Jeffrey Ullman is a different franchiser . I ' m tougher . I ' m wiser . I ' m prepared to take Great Expectations into the 21st Century with all_of you or with some of you. &quot; Suddenly , his tone thaws . He reaches behind him , beaming as he grabs a big , Styrofoam tombstone emblazoned with the letters , &quot; GE R.I.P. &quot; &quot; This could be ( the future ) : GE Rest in Peace , &quot; he says . He means to deliver a cautionary message , but his giddy pride over his homemade prop is getting_in the way . He holds_up another faux headstone that says : &quot; Negative Images of GE. &quot; &quot; This is the grave I want to tap-dance on , &quot; he says . Ullman has been thinking hard about the future , and he ' s got some big , big plans . Statistics indicate that by the year 2000 , half of all Americans will be single . He wants to reach every_last one of them , to come_into their homes via cable hookups , to probe into untouched rural markets . Already , Great Expectations has inspired a syndicated television_show , &quot; Love Connection. &quot; ( Ullman receives royalties of $ 9 # 000 a year ) . But national sweep has failed to satisfy him . There ' s the rest of the romantically undeveloped world to think_about . Japan is intriguing . So is Canada . And that ' s not all . Ullman dreams of expanding beyond singles , introducing his video networking capabilities to industry . &quot; He who has information has power , &quot; he says . &quot; We believe that if you knew who wanted to meet you for purposes of business that would be a very powerful thing. &quot; He doesn ' t want to say too_much and tip_off his competitors . But mark his words -- if anyone can pull it off , Great Expectations can . &quot; We ' re a_people broker , aren ' t we ? that ' s really what we are. &quot; Meanwhile , lonely hearts are everywhere , and their pain is timeless . Vows will always be broken . Connections will always fail . The perfect mate will , for some people , always seem a heartbeat away . On that , Ullman can rely .</TEXT>
