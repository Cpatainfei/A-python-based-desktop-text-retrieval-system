   <HEADLINE> JAPAN APOLOGIZES FOR ACTIONS BEFORE PEARL_HARBOR ATTACK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fifty-two years and 50 weeks after the event , Japan ' s government finally apologized Monday for failing to break_off diplomatic negotiations before launching the sneak attack on Pearl_Harbor that pulled the United States into World_War_II . &quot; There can be no excuse , &quot; the Foreign Ministry said , for Japan ' s delay in delivering a message to Washington on Dec . 7 , 1941 , that it would negotiate no longer . The official apology was prompted by the routine declassification of a new batch of documents relating to that fateful day . But Monday ' s apology for Japanese diplomats ' &quot; deeply regrettable &quot; conduct was not addressed to the United States , the victim of the attack . Rather , said Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada , &quot; the statement was directed to the people of Japan. &quot; Why does the government feel a need to apologize to its own people for deceiving another nation half a century ago ? The answer involves the generalized concept of shame in Japanese society , and the particular sense_of_shame many Japanese feel about the beginning of World_War_II . In the fall of 1941 , the United States and Japan tried one last round of negotiations to resolve their angry dispute over Japanese aggression against China . While the talks were going_on , a Japanese naval task_force secretly sailed for Hawaii to attack Pearl_Harbor . On the morning of Dec . 7 -- or Dec . 8 , on Japan ' s side of the international dateline -- Japan ' s Foreign Ministry sent a final message to the State_Department . It was supposed to be delivered at 1 p.m. Washington time , just 25 minutes before the raid was to begin . With characteristic vagueness , the cable did not clearly declare war or threaten attack . Even the Japanese diplomats at the embassy in Washington did not understand this to be a warning of imminent attack . They took their time in typing an English version and did not deliver the message until an hour after Pearl_Harbor had been bombed .</TEXT>
