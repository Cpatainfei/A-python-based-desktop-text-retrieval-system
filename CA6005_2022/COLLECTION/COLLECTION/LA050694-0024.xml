   <TEXT> If Mom can ' t say her kid is a doctor or lawyer or President , what ' s the next best thing ? That guy putting you at the top of his list , and thanking_you on Oscar night as 100 million people check_out your beaming face ? Maybe a_couple_of moms have it even better . This Mother ' s Day , they can pick_up two new laser-disc releases and freeze-frame their own images . Of course , right after they applaud their son ' s name in the director ' s credit . Image ' s new wide-screen THX edition of the 1989 romantic comedy hit &quot; When Harry Met Sally . . . &quot; ( $ 40 ) gives Estelle Reiner a chance to relive one of the most memorable moments in cinema . Son Rob Reiner couldn ' t have given her a better slice of film history . Just zip to Chapter Stop 19 on Side One for an instant replay of her classic one-liner . It follows Meg Ryan ' s offering Billy Crystal something not on the restaurant menu -- proof that , yes indeed , women can fake it and even Don Juan won ' t have a clue . Enhancing that moment and helping you savor the rest of the eminently rewatchable tribute to love and friendship is a sharp digital film transfer and THX sound , underscoring that THX may be spectacular in action-packed films , but is still most welcome in a quieter environment . The sumptuous visual , literary and period feast that Martin Scorsese serves_up in &quot; Age of Innocence &quot; ( Columbia TriStar Home Video , $ 40 ) also continues his series filmic &quot; thank-you &quot; notes to his mother and father . As they have in many of the director ' s other films , Catherine and Luciano Charles Scorsese venture on-screen in the Oscar-nominated film_starring Daniel Day-Lewis , Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder . Scorsese ' s father suffered a heart_attack the day after their close-up on a staircase . &quot; That was the last image that we saw of him on film , &quot; Scorsese has said . The film is dedicated to the elder Scorsese , who died before its release . Two decades earlier , the filmmaker ' s parents were the subject of Scorsese ' s affecting exploration of his roots in a documentary called &quot; Italianamerican. &quot; The 1974 film is among &quot; Three by Scorsese , &quot; released a_few years ago by Criterion ( $ 50 ) . The other short features are &quot; The Big Shave &quot; from 1967 and &quot; American Boy &quot; from 1978 . But it is the time spent with the Scorseses , originally shot_for a public-television series on immigrant families , that is the most compelling . In some ways , it parallels the &quot; testimony &quot; of the various couples interjected throughout &quot; When Harry Met Sally . . . &quot; But we know this is real , a home_movie by a premier filmmaker that makes us wish we could also discover our parents , and so ourselves , in much the same way . While few filmmakers have put their moms on camera , fewer still have trained their lenses on in-laws , or near-in-laws . In &quot; Hannah and Her Sisters , &quot; Woody Allen , then still enamored of Mia Farrow , brought Farrow ' s mom , Maureen O ' Sullivan , into the picture . Available in an Image Entertainment release ( $ 40 ) , the 1986 film remains one of Allen ' s most tender . Of course , on Mother ' s Day , moms -- surrounded by their families , of course -- could always spend the day_watching films on laser about moms and dads and kids . Put &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire &quot; ( Fox / Image , $ 40 ) , &quot; Parenthood &quot; ( MCA , $ 35 ) , &quot; I Remember Mama &quot; ( Republic , $ 30 ) and &quot; Mommy Dearest &quot; ( Paramount , $ 35 ) all together and you may have a film that comes_close to spelling &quot; M-O-T-H-E-R. &quot; ( And if you can wait till fall , you can find &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire &quot; in a promised wide-screen , THX director-approved edition with additional footage and other supplementary material , for $ 100. ) Laserbits New Movies Just Out : &quot; A Perfect World &quot; ( Warner , $ 40 ) ; &quot; What ' s Love Got to Do With It &quot; ( Touchstone , letterboxed , $ 40 ) ; &quot; Malice &quot; ( New Line , $ 40 ) ; &quot; Fearless &quot; ( Warner , $ 40 ) ; &quot; Batman : Mask of the Phantasm &quot; ( Warner , $ 40 ) ; &quot; The Beverly Hillbillies &quot; ( FoxVideo , $ 40 ) ; &quot; The Saint of Fort Washington &quot; ( Warner , $ 35 ) . Older Movies Just Out : &quot; The Electric Horseman &quot; ( MCA / Universal , $ 40 , 1979 ) , directed by Sydney Pollack and featuring Jane Fonda and Robert Redford ; &quot; Kid Galahad &quot; ( MGM / UA , $ 35 , 1962 ) , the Elvis Presley starrer about a boxing champion , featuring six songs ; &quot; Jumping Jacks &quot; ( Paramount , $ 35 , 1952 ) , the Dean Martin-Jerry Lewis comedy about paratroopers .</TEXT>
