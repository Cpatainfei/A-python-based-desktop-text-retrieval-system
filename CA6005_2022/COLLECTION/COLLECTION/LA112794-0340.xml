   <HEADLINE> RAIN , HIGH WINDS BUFFET SOUTHLAND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Northern California warmed_up Saturday from a storm that dumped rain , hail and so_much snow that it buried the record downfall that trapped a passenger_train for four days in the 1950s . But the reprieve from the kind of weather that closed main highways linking California and Nevada and caused power outages for 20 # 000 customers Friday could be short , the National Weather Service said . In Southern California , high winds drove cold showers through the area Saturday morning , as a quarter of an inch of rain fell at lower elevations and mountains above 4 # 000 feet were coated with snow . Winds whipped at 25 to 35 m.p.h. over most of the area with gusts up_to 40 m.p.h. A wind advisory was in_effect on highways , small-craft warnings were issued for inner waters off the coast and gale warnings were posted for outer waters . Despite a dramatic rescue attempt by the Coast Guard , a woman died after she fell from a sailboat into the high , windblown seas off San Pedro . A Coast Guard helicopter lowered a rescue swimmer to snatch the woman from the nine-foot swells nine miles offshore about 12:30 p.m. Rescuers attempted to resuscitate the victim , who was not identified , but she was pronounced dead an hour later at San Pedro Peninsula Hospital . In Vernon , a funnel-shaped &quot; mini-twister &quot; ripped tar_paper and skylights from roofs of commercial buildings , sending the material spinning into the air , according to police and fire officials . Fire_Department Battalion Chief Gary Wiskus said a startled police_officer and civilian saw what looked_like a little cyclone strike just after midnight . &quot; They could see the material whirling_around inside the twister and they could hear a loud roaring noise , &quot; he said . There were no injuries . In Palm Springs , winds gusted as high as 50 m.p.h. , and on a hole of the Skins Game golf tournament , a wind-aided drive by Fred Couples soared 430 yards in the air . Winds were expected to drop to 10 to 20 m.p.h. today with clear skies and high_temperatures in the 60s , according to the National Weather Service . In Northern California , Interstate 80 in the Sierra_Nevada was open in both directions Saturday as the storm eased , Caltrans said , but chains were required for some stretches . The highway was closed at Donner Pass_on Friday when heavy snow and winds gusting to 100 m.p.h. created whiteout conditions . At the 7 # 000-foot level and a mile west of Donner Summit , the snowpack at the little town of Norden reached 72 inches , beating the 66 inches that fell_in 1951 , according to KCBS meteorologist Mike Pechner . The winter storm that lasted into 1952 nearly entombed the Southern Pacific Railroad ' s sleek City of San Francisco in a slide at Yuba Gap . The new storm snapped tree limbs that became laden with snow , felling them on power_lines , said Pacific Gas &amp; Electric spokesman Lyle LaFaver . &quot; We have about 20 # 000 people without service in an area from Eureka to Santa Cruz , &quot; he said Saturday . But the storm was good news for skiers . &quot; Conditions couldn ' t be better , &quot; said Sheila Walsh , spokeswoman at Boreal Ridge on Donner Summit . &quot; It ' s sunny and brisk. &quot; Relatively mild weather should last until Thursday , weather officials said .</TEXT>
