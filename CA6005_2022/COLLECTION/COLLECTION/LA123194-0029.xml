   <HEADLINE> SACRIFICIAL LAMB IN PESO ' S PLUNGE ; EFFORT TO CALM MEXICO ' S CRISIS DEMANDS RESIGNATION OF FINANCE_MINISTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo has finally moved to calm a crisis of confidence in his nation ' s currency . Unfortunately , shoring_up the peso required more_than the announcement of various financial measures to assure foreign investors that Mexico will pay its debts and otherwise remain a sound investment . He also had to find a sacrificial lamb whose political ouster would show that Mexico ' s new president is firmly in control . Zedillo ' s logical , but no doubt painful , choice was Finance_Minister Jaime Serra Puche . In announcing the outline of his new fiscal_policies , Zedillo said he was also accepting Serra ' s resignation and replacing him with Guillermo Ortiz , a Mexican economist who once headed the International Monetary Fund . Serra was a logical sacrifice because he so clearly mishandled the decision that set_off Mexico ' s economic_crisis . When Serra announced the peso would be devalued on Dec . 20 , it came as no surprise to the many financial analysts who had been warning that the Mexican currency was overvalued in_relation_to the dollar . But the announcement stunned some big foreign investors who had been assured by Serra several days earlier , during a visit to New York , that the peso would not be devalued . The sudden change of signals set_off a panic that sent the peso into a free fall from which it is only now starting to recover . The choice was painful because Serra is close to Zedillo and , like Mexico ' s new president , is a young , U.S.-educated technocrat of the same generation that produced former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari . In fact , when Serra was named to Zedillo ' s Cabinet last month -- after having been Salinas ' minister of trade -- Mexican pundits pegged him as the front-runner to be Zedillo ' s successor . Now those same pundits say Serra fell victim to his generation ' s hubris . Like the other young technocrats , Serra was so convinced of the rightness of his strategy to open and modernize Mexico ' s economy that he failed to realize how vulnerable his nation was to the whims of foreign investors . If they are right , then Serra ' s generation learned a hard lesson -- one that Ortiz , another member of that generation , should keep_in mind .</TEXT>
