   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO ; THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING PRESIDENT ; ELECTION-SEASON TURMOIL , INCLUDING TREACHERY IN HIS OWN PARTY , DEMANDS A FIRM HAND , YET SALINAS HAS ALL BUT ABDICATED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has become an invisible man . As Mexico slouches from crisis to crisis , Salinas has become a mere figurehead who hands_out prizes , inaugurates events , travels and creates government commissions , but no longer controls the country ' s destiny . His political death has left Mexico trapped in a stalemate and without the leadership it so desperately needs to assure a free and fair presidential election on Aug . 21 . Alone and alienated at Los Pinos , the presidential residence , Salinas watches passively as his once-loyal collaborators engage in political warfare and the country unravels . The candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , Ernesto Zedillo , rarely mentions the president or his accomplishments ; former peace commissioner ( and Zedillo rival ) Manuel Camacho Solis has left the Chiapas negotiations -- and hence the PRI-dominated political agenda -- in a lurch ; guerrilla Subcommander Marcos has refused the presidential peace offer . Most recently , Interior Minister Jorge Carpizo attempted to resign his office , which supervises elections , charging that unspecified factions were trying to undermine the democratic process . Mexico ' s multiple political crises since the Chiapas revolt last January have revealed the flaws of a governing system built_upon the political capital and the popularity of a single man . Salinas wanted to govern alone , and now he is alone . Faced with a turbulent country , a political class that cannibalizes itself and a national modernization project whose survival is at stake , Salinas has opted to remain silent , thus abandoning his presidential responsibilities . In the past , Salinas used the transformative power of the presidency to change Mexico ' s economic course ; now he should tap into that reservoir and support Mexico ' s political evolution . When the presidential succession was assured , it was natural for the incumbent to ease_up in the last months of his term . In the turmoil of this election , being fiercely contested by three candidates , Mexico needs a fully active president , one who is committed to decent elections and a pluralistic government ; a president respected for his activism in favor of democracy and not condemned for his absence ; a president who understands political competition as an unqualified good and not as a necessary evil . Mexico does not need to resuscitate the caudillos ; too many of them already inhabit the country ' s political class . However , the transition undoubtedly requires a helmsman . Salinas has the historic opportunity to reinvent himself as the statesman he strove unsuccessfully to become . He has the chance to be the first Mexican president committed to political opening , not to the survival -- at all costs -- of the PRI . Instead of handing_over the keys of the political kingdom to the party ' s dinosaurs , he could support Carpizo ' s democratic efforts ; instead of exiling himself at Los Pinos , he could seize the initiative and generate a widespread public consensus for peaceful , free and fair elections ; instead of lobbying for a job abroad ( as head of the new_World Trade Organization ) , he should finish the work waiting at_home . Hard-liners within the ruling party are attempting to take_advantage of Salinas ' abdication of leadership and launch a silent coup d ' etat that would guarantee their political renaissance . The most competitive election in Mexico ' s history will bring_together groups within the PRI that are hoping for fraud and groups that are willing -- or feel compelled -- to provide it . Zedillo ' s less-than-popular candidacy may put more pressure on the party machinery to generate votes and turn_a_blind_eye to illegal practices , particularly in remote rural_areas . Renowned and respected as a human-rights advocate and informal electoral ombudsman , Carpizo has managed to bridge the chasm of distrust among Mexico ' s political_parties . He tried to resign because he was unwilling to condone PRI-sponsored fraud and see his hard-earned reputation go_up in smoke . To persuade Carpizo to stay_on , Salinas made many promises , including the assurance of a squeaky-clean election . The question is whether he will keep his word and enforce it throughout the rank_and_file , even if the PRI loses . Salinas has distinguished himself as a risk-taker and a high-stakes gambler . Thus it is paradoxical that when Mexico confronts him with the most significant challenge of his political career -- the democratic gamble -- the president wavers . If he does not rouse himself to action soon , history will have to judge Carlos Salinas as the incredible shrinking president who lost so_much political weight by the end of his term that the presidential sash became too big for him .</TEXT>
