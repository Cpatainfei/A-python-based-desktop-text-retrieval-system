   <HEADLINE> SPIES , SATELLITES AND SEX ; THE FIST OF GOD , BY FREDERICK FORSYTH ( BANTAM : $ 23.95 ; 560 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s difficult to tell exactly what Frederick Forsyth had_in_mind when he started &quot; The Fist of God. &quot; He clearly wanted to write an op-ed piece of sorts , warning his readers about the dangers of nuclear_weapons proliferation and the need for great_powers to maintain a robust network of human spies , even in the post-Cold War era . In fact , just to make certain no one who reads the novel misses these points , Forsyth supplies an appendix in the form of an essay in which he spells them out . &quot; It is madness for the thirty most industrialized developed nations of the world , who dispose between them of ninety-five percent of high-tech weaponry and the means for its production , to sell these artifacts to the crazed , the aggressive and the dangerous for short-term profit , &quot; he writes . Fair enough . No one watching the gathering crisis in North_Korea would be inclined to argue . Forsyth ' s devotion to the preservation of the secret_agent ' s brotherhood is a little harder to support in light of espionage fiascoes like the Aldrich Ames case . Outside of the genre novel , it ' s not so clear that the intelligence gathered by human spies justifies the enormous cost . But since Forsyth clearly has friends in the brotherhood , his view is not surprising . Forsyth apparently also wanted to write a technical history of the Persian_Gulf_War of 1991 , and in this he succeeds brilliantly . Page after page is given over to lucid , thoroughly researched descriptions of the weapons_systems and communications technology that won the war . Among many other items , he gives the best concise explanation I have yet read for why the Patriot missile failed to stop most of the SCUD warheads thrown by Iraq at Israel and why , in the end , it hardly mattered . To reach Israel , the Iraqis had to modify the SCUD supplied by the Soviet_Union , adding range at the expense of payload . This jerry-building meant that the rocket tended to disintegrate as it descended toward its target . The Patriot was programmed to respond to this confusion by seeking_out and destroying the biggest piece of the SCUD it could see , which in most cases was the missile ' s spent fuel tank . But the good news was that the warheads that got_through were too small to cause much damage . The SCUD was largely a psychological threat , and the Patriot was largely a psychological response . It did its real job , which was to keep Israel out of the war and thereby preserve the coalition of Western and Arab nations arrayed against Iraq . Forsyth chose to package all_of this erudition in the form of a thriller , and in this he was somewhat less successful . The book has characters aplenty ; it begins with the Tolstoyan three-page dramatis personae that lists only the important ones . But few of these characters are engaging and almost none have more_than two dimensions . Forsyth ' s idea of character development is to have one character read the resume of another , listing the schools and regiments he has passed_through . Human_beings are not , in the end , as important to the story as governments and weapons are . Forsyth spends much of the first 50 pages discoursing on the late Gerald Bull and his advanced cannon technology . Only after this is complete does he get_around_to introducing his hero , an Arabic-speaking commando in the_British Special Air Services . Forsyth has fortunately not forgotten how to structure a plot . This one involves the conjecture that Saddam might indeed have developed a nuclear_weapon just prior to Desert Storm , secreted it in a camouflaged mountain fortress , and prepared to fire at the advancing allied troops , using the big cannon technology developed quietly for Iraq by Bull . The successful prosecution of the war hinges_on whether the Allies can find and destroy this weapon before the land war begins . Clever spies , communications satellites , reconnaissance technology and high-tech weaponry , as well as money and sexual wiles , are all bent to this end . Readers who can remember the headlines from February , 1991 , will know the outcome . But Forsyth spins a story so well that they will keep turning pages to find_out exactly how it was done .</TEXT>
