   <TEXT> Three Mile Island . Even now , 15 years after the accident and shutdown of the nuclear_power plant near Middletown , Pa. , the words conjure images of nuclear_energy run amok , a disaster , a near-holocaust . But no one was killed at Three Mile Island , and an independent review found no convincing evidence of increased cancer incidence in the area in the six years after the accident . Residents probably put themselves at greater risk driving_away from Three Mile Island than they would have by staying . Nevertheless , as the late British journalist Henry Fairlie wrote in the New Republic in 1989 , &quot; Three Mile Island in the American mind is an emblem of catastrophe . &quot; At Three Mile Island , &quot; he wrote , &quot; the fail-safe system worked . The power_station switched itself off . There was a scare , but no disaster . Yet . . . nuclear_power in America , as in no other nation , has been almost paralyzed &quot; ever since , largely because of the scare coverage of the news media on that event and on nuclear_energy in_general . &quot; There is by now considerable documentation that public opposition to risky technologies rises and falls with the volume of reporting , &quot; writes Alan Mazur , professor of public affairs at Syracuse University and editor of the summer , 1994 , issue of the quarterly journal Risk : Health , Safety &amp; Environment . The coverage of nuclear_energy -- before , during and after Three Mile Island -- is especially significant because nuclear_energy was the first major political issue of the environmental movement . In fact , it helped shape that movement , says Dianne Dumanoski , longtime science and environment writer for the Boston Globe , now on_leave to write a book on the impact of artificial chemicals on fetal development . The environmental movement emerged in the 1970s , &quot; the time that journalism was in the throes of post-Watergate chest-puffing , &quot; in the words of Robert Lichter , co-director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs in Washington . &quot; Journalists were looking_for the next Watergate , &quot; Lichter says ; in the process , &quot; a technological issue became a political and moral issue. &quot; Although some news media covered Three Mile Island responsibly , most did not . David Rubin , who chaired a government task_force that examined the coverage , said confusion among government and utility officials contributed significantly to poor media coverage . But he also said journalists covering the accident &quot; knew shockingly little about nuclear_power and compounded their ignorance by focusing too narrowly on worst-case scenario questions. &quot; The task_force called the radiation coverage &quot; abysmally inadequate &quot; and said reporters had made improper comparisons and factually impossible statements and provided insufficient background information . &quot; To a reader or viewer trying to decide whether to pack his bags and run , radiation reports in the media were often as useless as a baseball_score of 6-4 that neglected to mention which teams had played , &quot; the commission said . Some coverage of nuclear_energy has been worse than useless . A 13-year study of nuclear coverage in seven major print and broadcast news outlets by Lichter ' s center concluded that major media coverage of nuclear_energy in_general is unfair , providing a &quot; predominantly negative spin &quot; that strongly emphasizes the alleged dangers of nuclear_energy . In the early 1980s , as Charles Krauthammer , the syndicated columnist , recently observed in Time magazine , &quot; the U.S. experienced a nuclear hysteria -- a morbid , near-panicked fear of nuclear apocalypse. &quot; This frenzy of fear was fanned by , among others , the &quot; mindless media , &quot; Krauthammer wrote . In 1971 , eight years before Three Mile Island , 58 % of Americans polled said they would be willing to have nuclear_power plants in their communities . The tide of public_opinion began to turn against nuclear_power throughout the 1970s ; by 1980 , the year after Three Mile Island , 63 % were opposed , and 28 % were willing . Thus , when Paul Slovic , a professor of psychology at the University of Oregon , asked various groups of people to rank 30 activities and technologies in terms of risk , college_students and members of the League of Women Voters ranked nuclear_power as the No . 1 hazard . They judged it to be more dangerous than guns , smoking , alcohol , driving a car or working as a policeman . Slovic , the president of Decision Research Inc. in Eugene , Ore. , and a longtime expert on risk perception and assessment , gave the same list to medical and scientific experts . They rated nuclear_energy No . 20 -- after all these other hazards and after swimming , bicycling and X-rays . As part of its studies , the Center for Media and Public Affairs also conducted a survey that included questions on nuclear_energy . The center ' s survey compared the attitudes of journalists who write_about science with the attitudes of three groups of experts -- engineers , energy scientists and nuclear specialists . The experts strongly favored &quot; rapid nuclear development , &quot; by majorities ranging from 69 % to 82 % ; only 24 % of science journalists favored &quot; rapid nuclear development. &quot; Journalists who thought reactors were &quot; very unsafe &quot; and who thought present risks were &quot; not acceptable &quot; and who favored a nuclear moratorium outnumbered the experts by margins ranging from 2-to-1 up_to 8-to-1 . &quot; None of this proves that journalists consciously set_out to slant their reporting against nuclear_energy , &quot; the center report said , and indeed most responsible journalists work hard to keep their personal opinions from unfairly influencing their stories . But journalists are only human , and some &quot; leakage &quot; from the personal to the professional , however subconscious , may at times be inevitable . Public perceptions of risk are conditioned by much more_than just the news media , though -- especially on an issue as volatile as nuclear_energy . With nuclear_energy , there is the immediate specter of The Bomb . Mushroom_clouds . Hiroshima . Nagasaki . The End of the World . The Soviet nuclear disaster at Chernobyl in 1986 only compounded these fears . Any mention of nuclear_power evokes &quot; echoes of the bomb , &quot; of something with risks that are &quot; catastrophic rather than incremental , &quot; says Clarence ( Terry ) Davies , director of the Center for Risk Management at Resources for the Future , a Washington think_tank that specializes in environmental issues . Nicholas Wade , science and health editor of the New York Times , says , &quot; Everyone ' s sense of proportion seems to fly out the window as soon as you mention that something might be radiating. &quot; Hence the panicky reaction in many quarters to proposals to &quot; irradiate &quot; some food_products to kill food-borne diseases and extend shelf_life . Experts say irradiation could rid hamburger meat of new bacteria that pose &quot; a clear_and_present_danger to our public health &quot; and that killed four people and made more_than 500 ill last year after they ate_at Jack in the Box outlets in the Pacific Northwest . The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the irradiation of fruits , vegetables , chicken and some dairy_products ; in July , a panel of medical experts urged the agency to approve irradiation of some hamburger meat . But two states have banned irradiation , and many Americans remain convinced that it causes cancer , even though there has been no scientific evidence . Radiation from medical X-rays , including mammograms , also frightens some people . Doctors caution against excessive , unnecessary X-rays , for fear of the potential carcinogenic effects of repeated exposure , but many people worry unnecessarily about routine -- and medically recommended -- X-rays , as well as about radiation in airplanes and from video display terminals and other sources . Ironically -- sadly -- this fear leads some people to delay or refuse X-rays that could lead to the discovery , diagnosis and treatment of diseases far more likely to kill them than X-rays . Feeding a Nation ' s Nuclear Fears Media coverage of nuclear_energy -- and especially of Three Mile Island -- contributed significantly to what many scientists say is an unreasonable fear in the public .</TEXT>
