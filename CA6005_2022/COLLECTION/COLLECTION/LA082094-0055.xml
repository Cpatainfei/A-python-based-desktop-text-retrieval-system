   <HEADLINE> POLITICS ; ENCLAVE PRESENTS RUSSIA WITH ITS OWN HAITI ; MOSCOW LAYS_CLAIM TO UNRULY REPUBLIC OF CHECHNYA . BUT IT CANNOT CONTROL ITS REBELLIOUS LEADER . RECENT WAFFLING ON WHETHER TO INVADE NEARLY LED TO BLOODSHED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Early this month , Russian diplomats in Washington made a discreet but disturbing inquiry : If you Americans are going_to invade Haiti , they asked , would you mind if Russia invaded its own southern corner -- an unruly little place called Chechnya ? The Clinton_Administration replied that yes , we do mind , according to two specialists familiar_with the exchange , and the Russians backed_off . But not before Moscow ' s open support for a rebel group in Chechnya brought the Caucasus Mountains to the brink of bloodletting . Chechnya is Russia ' s Haiti -- a mountainous , ethnic enclave half the Caribbean nation ' s size but more dangerous . Moscow considers the oil-producing Muslim republic and its 1.2 million people part of Russia -- as does the rest of the world -- but cannot control its dictator , a former Soviet bomber pilot named Dzhokar Dudayev , who declared independence in 1991 . Since then , Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin has lived with three unpleasant choices : Topple Dudayev and risk guerrilla war against his many loyalists across the Caucasus . Let Chechnya go and thus embolden other ethnic republics to secede as well . Or forget the place -- and the embarrassment of not ruling the whole Russian Federation . The Kremlin suddenly remembered Chechnya late last month . A mass kidnaping by a Chechen gang and a failed rescue attempt left five people dead in a southern Russian resort . Accusing Dudayev of inciting terrorism and beheading his foes , Yeltsin ' s aides embraced a Chechen Provisional Council that favors rejoining Russia . On Aug . 2 , after Russia had halted flights over Chechnya and sealed the border , the opposition council , apparently expecting help from the Russian army , announced it was seizing power and calling new elections . The coup turned_out to be wishful_thinking , undermined by Yeltsin ' s decision not to invade . It was a prudent choice . Recent polls show that fewer than 10 % of all Russians want to force Chechnya back into the fold , perhaps because its warring clans and gunslinger ethos were never tamed by 70 years of Soviet rule . Russians stereotype Chechens as ruthless gangsters who might , if pushed , strike back at Russia ' s nuclear_power plants . &quot; If we used force in Chechnya , it would spark an uprising in the Caucasus and lead to such turmoil , so_much bloodshed , that no one would forgive us afterward , &quot; Yeltsin said last week . But he added with a smile , &quot; The role of the opposition ( in Chechnya ) is growing , and I would not say we have no influence there. &quot; That influence , however , is limited . The 22-member council is shunned by the bulk of Dudayev ' s political foes , who all favor some degree of autonomy from Moscow . Council leader Umar Avturkhanov , who is mayor and former police_chief of Znamenskoye , is popular only in his home district , where rubles shipped from Moscow pay public workers ' wages . Threatening a holy war &quot; that will eclipse Afghanistan , &quot; Dudayev drafted tens of thousands of men into his army this week to resist any invasion . But he has refrained_from moving against Avturkhanov , who claims to have won_over a tank battalion , two mountain cavalry squadrons and a suicide squad of terrorists from Dudayev ' s army . The Chechen leader is more wary of his best-known compatriot , Ruslan I . Khasbulatov , who came_home this summer aiming to unite Chechnya ' s fractious opposition . Authorities first put_up roadblocks to bar him from towns where he planned to hold rallies , then accused him of treason and took_away his citizenship . According to one report -- denied by the authorities -- a condemned killer was freed from jail to get_rid_of Khasbulatov . If Moscow ' s air and land blockades eventually force Dudayev down and help Khasbulatov maneuver to the top , it could only mean more bad news for Yeltsin . It was Khasbulatov , the wily pipe-smoking Chechen , who led Moscow ' s Soviet-era Parliament to months of belligerent resistance against his reforms -- until Yeltsin ordered tanks to blow_up the building last October . A Troubled Region The republic of Chechnya and its leader are posing a sticky problem for Russia . Moscow ' s support for an opposition group almost led to bloody conflict recently .</TEXT>
