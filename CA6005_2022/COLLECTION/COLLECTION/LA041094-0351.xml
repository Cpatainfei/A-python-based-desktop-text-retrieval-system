   <HEADLINE> FASTER THAN A SPEEDING BULLET ; HIGH-SPEED TRAINS ARE JAPAN ' S PRIDE , SUBJECT OF DEBATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Toru Fukushima still recalls the pride he felt when , as a high_school student during the golden autumn of 1964 , Tokyo was host to the Olympics and the soon-to-be-famous bullet train made its first high-speed runs . &quot; The bullet train and the Olympic Games together were symbols of Japan ' s economic_growth , &quot; said Fukushima , now a planning official with Central Japan Railway Co . &quot; I sent my friends New Year ' s cards with pictures of the bullet train . And I received many cards from my friends with its design . It represented the hopes of the Japanese people. &quot; While the bullet train is no longer the world ' s fastest -- that honor now belongs_to the_French Train a Grande Vitesse ( TGV ) -- Japan ' s love for speed on rails is still intense . The nation is making a multibillion-dollar gamble on developing ever faster and ever more technically advanced trains that would improve service at_home and , it is hoped , generate business abroad . Work is moving forward both on speeding_up conventional bullet trains and on building futuristic levitation trains that will float above the tracks via electromagnetic power . Yet the advanced , in-service model of the bullet train , Nozomi , has been engulfed in controversy since it was launched two years ago . Some critics say the risks in Japan ' s aggressive development of faster trains -- in terms of both finances and safety -- outweigh the potential benefits . Despite questions about the wisdom of this massive investment , it is clearly producing technical progress . And , with the Clinton_Administration showing interest in high-speed rail , Japanese rail_technology soon may be finding its way to the United States . Magnetic_levitation ( or &quot; maglev &quot; ) train technology is one area the United States and Japan cited as offering potential for research collaboration in a broad agreement signed_in February by the U.S. Department_of_Transportation and Japan ' s Ministry of Transportation . &quot; My understanding is that the U.S._government is most interested in superconductivity &quot; for use in maglev trains , said Norio Mitsuya , director of international economic affairs at the Ministry of Transportation . &quot; Maybe the Japanese government can help. &quot; Japan also &quot; certainly will be ready &quot; to cooperate in the upgrading of Amtrak ' s Washington-New York-Boston ( Northeast corridor ) service , if the United States requests such participation , Mitsuya said . Advanced Japanese rail_technology also may figure in U.S. efforts to find commercial ventures for military contractors as procurement budgets shrink . For example , Grumman Corp . -- which agreed last week to be acquired by Los Angeles-based Northrop Corp . -- has conferred_with a Japanese firm about building a relatively simple maglev train for moderate-speed service in U.S. cities . Potential markets for advanced train technology also beckon in countries such_as South_Korea , Taiwan and China . The main international competition so far has pitted the bullet train against France ' s TGV and Germany ' s Intercity Express ( ICE ) . South_Korea has chosen the TGV over the bullet train for a planned Seoul-Pusan route . Japanese engineers did feasibility studies in the United States about a decade ago , during an earlier wave of U.S. interest in high-speed trains . They looked_at prospects for a Los Angeles-San Diego line and at projects in Florida and in the Chicago area . Their conclusions -- based partly on_their_own experiences getting_around the United States -- were not encouraging . &quot; Except for the Northeast corridor , high-speed rail projects in the United States are not ( commercially ) feasible , we think , &quot; said Fukushima , whose company operates the bullet train service between Tokyo and Osaka . &quot; Americans like to travel_by airplane and rental cars . Many engineers who visited the United States know the convenience of this combination. &quot; Japanese interest in finding overseas customers for rail_technology is based not only on the money to be made , but also very much on national prestige , Fukushima said . &quot; We have pride that the initial high-speed train was inaugurated in Japan , &quot; he said . &quot; We have pride that our system encouraged European railways that high-speed rail would be possible . Thirty years ago , other countries were very pessimistic about the future of rail . We have pride in the &quot; While skeptics say prestige has played too big a role in the never-ending quest_for greater speed , Japan is aggressively pushing_forward on four major technical fronts : * The Nozomi , which runs at speeds_up to 168 m.p.h. , was launched in 1992 . Service has not been trouble-free , however , and technicians are striving to resolve a variety of problems , many of them related to loose or weak bolts . Critics say that government-owned Central Japan Railway , creator of the Nozomi , rushed the light-weight , aluminum-body train into service without sufficient testing -- a charge the company denies . Test runs are being conducted on the next generation of high-speed bullet trains , based on the same basic design as the Nozomi . One of these prototypes , the STAR 21 , set a new Japanese speed record of 265 m.p.h. in a December test run . That made_it second in the world to France ' s TGV , which has been clocked at 319 m.p.h. * Central Japan Railway is developing a futuristic maglev train that hovers about four inches above the rails . This train depends_on powerful superconducting electromagnets , which function only when cooled to very low_temperatures by liquid helium . The United States is interested in this technology , although there is great uncertainty about its practicality for rail service . A prototype , made of plastic , was destroyed in 1991 by a fire touched_off by a flat_tire . Another prototype , made of aluminum , has achieved speeds of up_to 262 m.p.h. on a four-mile test track over the past year . * Construction is under way on an 11-mile maglev test track that could become part of a super-high-speed Tokyo-Osaka route on which maglev trains would travel as fast as 300 m.p.h. , but some residents along the proposed route have fought bitterly against giving_up their land . Critics also charge that the train ' s strong magnetic_fields may pose a public health risk -- and that the $ 3 billion already committed to the project will never be recovered . * New efforts are being made to put into commercial service a relatively simple form of maglev train , called High Speed Surface Transport ( HSST ) . Variations of this system carried more_than 1.5 million riders at expositions in Japan during the 1980s . This train hovers about half an inch above its track , suspended by conventional electromagnetic power . Appropriate for use within urban_areas , it runs at speeds_up to about 70 m.p.h. The technology is not controversial , but it has never been used commercially . Long_Island , N.Y.-based Grumman has discussed cooperation in this technology with Japan ' s HSST Development Co. , created last year by 48 Japanese companies that wanted to promote its use . Efforts to market conventional bullet-train technology based on the Nozomi model are headed by the Japan High Speed Rail Consortium , which includes more_than 30 large corporations under the leadership of two trading companies , Mitsui &amp; Co . Ltd . and Nissho Iwai Corp . Still , controversy dogs the Nozo mi , the fastest train in everyday use . Since it went_into service , Japanese newspapers have carried dozens of reports about loose bolts , stones kicked_up , cracked windows and other mechanical failures . The harshest criticism is that the Nozo mi , with 37 trains in_operation , runs a higher risk of derailment than the slower -- but thoroughly proven -- Kodama and Hikari versions of the bullet train . The experience of the_French TGV , three derailments in the past 16 months , shows that high-speed rail accidents indeed can happen . The first TGV derailment was caused by a broken axle , the second by the collapse of a covered World_War I trench under the rail_line and the third by colliding_with a bumper that had fallen_off a freight_train . The TGV has special , jointed wheel sections and carriages tightly linked to form a single &quot; backbone. &quot; The design enabled the entire train to remain upright in all three derailments , so serious injury to passengers was avoided . While Japan ' s bullet train has never been derailed -- earlier models have functioned largely free_of mechanical troubles -- the Nozomi has endured a seemingly endless string of embarrassing incidents . In December , visiting Chinese Railway Minister Han Zhubin was stuck_on the Nozomi for nearly three hours due_to a power outage . While top Japanese railway officials waited at the next station to welcome the Chinese delegation , 45 other trains were canceled or delayed , affecting 45 # 000 passengers . In an earlier incident , a four-foot-long exterior part fell_off the Nozomi as it headed into a Tokyo depot . &quot; If the train were going full speed and that part came loose and hit people , it would be terrible . People would die right away , &quot; said Keiichi Namba , 43 , a Nozomi maintenance worker who is a leader of the Central Japan Railway Workers Union , a relatively small , left-leaning group that has spearheaded criticism of the Nozomi . One of the Nozomi ' s most prominent critics is Kiyoshi Sakurai , an author with a doctorate in nuclear physics who , in recent years , has specialized in writing_about the risks and problems of high_technology . Sakurai presented a sharp critique of the Nozomi in a book published last year , &quot; The Day the Myth of Bullet Train Safety Collapses. &quot; His basic argument is that -- compared to previous bullet trains -- the Nozomi has been redesigned and lightened in ways that make_it less likely to withstand the stress of vibration encountered at higher speeds . For example , he said , the train ' s central axles were solid metal in previous models , but are now hollow tubes . &quot; In a case of extreme vibration , the train could crack apart and derail . that ' s one scenario , &quot; he said . &quot; Another scenario is that if bolts come loose , the big and extremely heavy motor could fall onto the unprotected spinning axle , cut_into it , break it and cause a derailment. &quot; The rail agency ' s managers acknowledge that all_the bad publicity about the Nozomi has not been helpful to overseas sales efforts . But they also point_out that bullet trains , including the Nozomi , have carried more_than 3.4 billion passengers -- an average of 27 trips for every person in Japan -- without an accident that caused passenger injury . The Nozomi suffers only routine start-up problems that pose no risk to this enviable record , management insists . &quot; After actually using the train at high speed , there were places where the stress was greater than we expected , &quot; Akira Isozaki , head of technical research and development at Central Japan Railway , acknowledged in an interview . &quot; So there are some places where it has proven necessary to put_on thicker bolts , or more bolts . But it ' s not a matter of the train itself having been weakened by being made lighter . . . . The great majority of these problems are extremely insignificant things that have no impact on how the Nozomi runs. &quot; Criticism of the Nozomi stems partly from the high standards set by a nation that has made bullet trains a part of its culture , according to Fukushima . &quot; If you see some of the calendars in Japan , for April you see the picture of the Nozomi running . . . with cherry blossoms in full bloom and Mt . Fuji covered with snow in the background , &quot; he noted . &quot; I think this is very typical. &quot; When the TGV derailed in December -- the incident involving the World_War I trench , Fukushima said -- a French newspaper ran a headline emphasizing that because of the train ' s special design , it had not overturned . If such an incident happened in Japan , there would never be such a positive spin on the story , he said . Instead , he said , &quot; People would say , ' Why didn ' t you find the big trench ? ' &quot; While some passengers express dissatisfaction with the Nozomi , complaining that it shakes too_much because of its speed , many others are happy with the fast service . &quot; I take the Nozomi because the ride is shorter , &quot; said Haruo Fukuda , a businessman who was about to return from Tokyo to Hiroshima on a Nozomi . &quot; I don ' t care about the troubles . Machines cannot avoid having troubles . I don ' t think they ' ll cause an accident. &quot; Times researcher Chiaki Kitada in Tokyo contributed to this report .</TEXT>
