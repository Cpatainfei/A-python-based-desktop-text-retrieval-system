   <HEADLINE> MEDIA ; SPAIN TRIES NEW TACK TO PROTECT FILMMAKERS ; THE GOVERNMENT HAD RELIED_ON SUBSIDIES TO BOOST ITS INDUSTRY . NOW IT ' S LIMITING U.S. FARE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hoping for a hit , Spanish director Jose Luis Garcia tried last fall to book the debut of his new movie into Madrid ' s theaters at the peak of the Christmas season . But his distributor , United International Pictures , decided instead to release &quot; Tirano Banderas &quot; ( &quot; Banderas the Tyrant &quot; ) in mid-January , at the close of the seasonal moviegoing gold_rush . The reason : Nearly all_the high-season dates had been reserved for what are considered better box-office bets in Spain -- American movies . &quot; Tirano Banderas , &quot; a satirical look_at a Latin_American dictator , drew modest interest in the capital when it was finally released and this spring is continuing an unremarkable run in the provinces . &quot; All of us who work in Spanish film are used to getting the bad dates , &quot; lamented Garcia , who wrote the story for this year ' s Oscar-winning foreign film , &quot; Belle Epoque , &quot; and has himself made several successful comedies . Favoritism for American movies is not surprising , he said . Most Spanish film distributors went_out of business years ago . The business is in the hands of Americans now . Spanish movie_makers complain that U.S. distributors unfairly squeeze Hollywood ' s throwaways into theaters here -- and thus squeeze_out the locals -- by selling package deals of one blockbuster U.S. film coupled with three or four B movies . But change is coming . And the cavalry riding to the rescue of the Spanish film_industry is -- you guessed it -- Spanish . New regulations passed_by Parliament last month set ratios for screenings of American movies vis-a-vis Spanish or European films . The regulations , sponsored by the Culture Ministry , pit Spain ' s movie_industry and its government against their American counterparts . Underlying the legislation are two basic questions : * Is Spanish cinema on the ropes because of a Hollywood bully with bigger muscles ? * Or , have Spain ' s directors and producers just forgotten how to entertain their compatriots , leaving distributors and theater owners to make their money by showing more popular American films ? It may be a bit of both . With a stable of directors like the late Luis Bunuel , Carlos Saura and current successes like Fernando Trueba and Pedro Almodovar , no one argues that all Spanish films are losers . But ironically , the Spanish government ' s attempts to boost its film_industry since 1984 may have sent crowds packing because the Culture Ministry doled_out cash primarily for avant-garde film projects , some of which never made_it to the theaters . &quot; Subsidies were given without rewarding success at the box_office , without regard_to what spectators wanted , &quot; which was not avant-garde fare , acknowledged Pedro Perez , head of the Spanish Film_Producers Assn . There were few options , Perez said , because audiences here are too small to justify making extravagant mega-productions like &quot; Jurassic Park. &quot; The country ' s box-office record is $ 10 million for Almodovar ' s &quot; Women on the Edge of a Nervous_Breakdown , &quot; but a typically successful Spanish film earns only about $ 2 million . Whatever the causes , the market share of American films at Spanish box_offices rose from 43 % in 1966 to 80 % in 1993 , while Spanish directors ' share of their home market shrank_from 20 % to 10 % . Overall movie attendance plummeted by 78 % during the same period , though Spanish filmmakers try to make_up much of that loss with showings on TV , where Spanish cinema is still very popular , and residuals from increasing video sales and rentals . Late last year , as the global talks_of the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade sped into their final stage , Spain ' s film_industry , echoing France ' s ultimately successful campaign to restrict American films , went_on the offensive . The industry lobbied Spain ' s Socialist government for restraints . In December , the Spanish Cabinet issued a film decree just under the GATT deadline . The law required big-city movie_houses to show one day of a Spanish or European Union-produced film for every two days they show a U.S. film , or for every three days in cities with populations under 125 # 000 . But the government early this month agreed to keep the ratio 3 to 1 for all cities , after Spanish producers and theater owners and the U.S.-controlled distributors negotiated a compromise . In addition , the new law stiffens longstanding rules for obtaining dubbing licenses , essential for high earnings in Spain since U.S. films are shown with subtitles only at a scattering of big-city theaters . Until now , distributors got one dubbing license for the debut of a Spanish film and up_to three more , depending_on the earnings . Distributors accumulated a backlog of tradable licenses that the government says eliminated any incentive to promote Spanish films . The new rules set a maximum of two licenses per Spanish film , specify an expiration date of two years for each license and make them non-transferable . The government hopes the rules will encourage the U.S. distributors to promote Spanish films more . The Clinton_Administration , however , cried foul . U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor complained about Spain ' s law before Congress , and U.S. officials in Madrid say Washington may fight the law on the basis of multinational trade agreements to which Spain belongs . Direct trade reprisals against Spain would be a last_resort . More likely is a compromise that is beginning to emerge from negotiations between officials of both governments and separate talks between the Spanish and U.S. film_industries . At a recent meeting in London attended by U.S. studio heads , Spanish producers and Myron Karlin , chief operating officer of the Motion_Picture Assn . of America , negotiators discussed self-regulation of the Spanish market , said Perez . Enrique Balmaseda , director of the Culture Ministry ' s Institute of Cinematography and Audiovisual Arts , says the talks aim &quot; to balance the interest of both industries . The defense of Spanish film doesn ' t have to prevent free access to the market. &quot;</TEXT>
