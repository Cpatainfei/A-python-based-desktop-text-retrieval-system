   <HEADLINE> MEXICO ' S PRI AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * For The Times , a major American newspaper , to hail the PRI ' s autocratic nomination of a presidential candidate ( &quot; A Vote for Continuity , &quot; editorial , March 30 ) in the name of building a &quot; modern economy &quot; is disgusting . Under President Porfirio Diaz ( 1871-1880 ) , the finances of Mexico were stabilized and the country experienced an unprecedented economic development . Foreign capital , especially , American , was invested in the exploitation of the country ' s mineral resources ; : mining , textile and other industries were expanded ; railroad , ports , telegraph_lines were constructed , and foreign trade increased about 300 % . On the other hand , foreign investors drained a great part of the country ' s wealth . Large_numbers of Indians were deprived of their ancient communal lands , and these lands were concentrated in the hands of a relatively small number of landowners . Poverty and illiteracy were widespread . Manifestations of the resulting social discontent were suppressed with an iron hand . Accumulated dissatisfaction , however , burst_forth in the revolution of 1911 . Are the seeds of another revolution in the making ? Your editorial shows an ignorance of history and the recent Chiapas revolt . It is about time we stop exploiting the indigenous peoples of Mexico and recognize their plight . The Times should promote a grass-roots democratic selection of the PRI presidential candidate to bring_about economic justice in Mexico . JACK GILMAN West Hollywood * * Jorge G . Castaneda ( &quot; The Last Gasp of a Moribund System , &quot; Commentary , April 1 ) yearns for what he calls Mexico ' s last &quot; successful presidency , &quot; that of Adolfo Lopez Mateos , from 1958 to 1964 . For those of us who took_advantage of Mexico ' s policies of patronage and protectionism , those were great times . But for most Mexicans , they were hardly the good old days . In 1960 , Mexico imported from the United States nearly all_the flux used in automatic welding . That year , I built a plant in Mexico_City to produce it locally . Once the factory was in_operation , I persuaded the Mexican government to shut the border to U.S. flux producers , effectively rewarding me a monopoly and ending the lucrative market for U.S.-based manufacturers . The United States and Mexico both suffered . I made money . It was Miguel de la Madrid , Mexico ' s most underappreciated president , who kept Mexico ' s nose above water when it was in danger of drowning in debt and who began to turn_around Mexico ' s economy . He and his successor , President Carlos Salinas de Gortari , operated within a political_system that cries_out_for reform . But good economics makes_good politics . Not the other way around . It may well be that the ghost of slain presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio will hang over Mexico ' s election . But the only ghost that can haunt Mexico ' s future is an over-romanticized view of a past that never was . STANLEY A . WEISS Washington Weiss lived and worked in Mexico for more_than 20 years . * * Mexico ' s President Salinas , and his ruling party , the PRI , desperately needed something , anything to divert the world ' s attention away from Chiapas . The tragic assassination of Colosio did_it . TRINI MARQUEZ Sky Forest</TEXT>
