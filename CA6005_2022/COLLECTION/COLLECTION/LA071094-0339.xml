   <HEADLINE> CLINTON TRADE PLAN FALLS_FLAT AT G-7 SUMMIT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton came_to the high-profile Group of Seven summit to demonstrate new strength in foreign_policy but instead watched his premier initiative sink Saturday under a wave of sharp criticism . The President ' s proposal , on future trade cooperation , was met by such firm objections , according to senior aides to several summit participants , that he was forced to abandon it almost as soon as he presented it . The plan was offered as a limited next step toward expanding international commerce in the wake of a tariff-reducing global agreement completed in December . In its most elementary form , it would have set_up a one-year examination of impediments to world trade , but it would have also set an agenda for liberalizing trade rules_in entirely new areas , such_as financial services , telecommunications and investment . Clinton presented the plan as his partners in the Group of Seven -- British Prime_Minister John Major , Canadian Prime_Minister Jean Chretien , French President Francois Mitterrand , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Italian Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi -- sat_down in an ornate , red-walled room of the Palazzo Reale overlooking the Bay of Naples . Japanese Prime_Minister Tomiichi Murayama , hospitalized Friday night after suffering an intestinal illness at an informal dinner with the other summit leaders , was represented by Foreign Minister Yohei Kono . Murayama was released from the hospital Saturday evening and planned to rejoin the summit today . Midway through their two-day annual conference , the seven , whose nations account_for 70 % of the world ' s economy , approved a communique that omitted any mention of the volatility in currency exchange_rates . Since Clinton took_office , the value of the dollar compared with the Japanese yen has fallen roughly 20 % , to a post-World War II low . Although Administration officials sought to steer clear of the dollar ' s woes , those problems continued to dog Clinton in Naples : His statement Friday suggesting that the United States would not intervene to prop it up_on currency markets sent the dollar into another sudden tailspin ; on Saturday , Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen took pains to diplomatically counter the impression left by the President , saying , &quot; We ' re prepared to act when it ' s appropriate. &quot; The G-7 communique saluted the strength of the current economic recovery and called_for reductions in unemployment . &quot; The world is_well on the way to a significant economic recovery , &quot; Clinton said at a news_conference . Today , the second and final day of the summit , the group will be joined by Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin , whose role in the meetings is being expanded for the first time . The leaders will focus_on such sensitive issues as the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina , the crisis in Haiti and the progress of Russia ' s economic reforms , each holding the potential for further disagreement . The negative reaction to the President ' s trade proposal came as a jolt after Administration officials had built it up under the forward-looking name of &quot; Markets 2000 &quot; and had portrayed it as evidence of his interest in leading the other nations to more open trade practices . When the President arose in Naples on Friday morning , he was greeted by a headline in the European edition of the Wall_Street Journal reading , &quot; Clinton ' s Trade Plan Puts His Leadership to the Test at Summit. &quot; The President said Saturday evening that all but one participant in the summit &quot; said they affirmatively agreed with my trade proposal. &quot; But as portrayed by representatives of the others at the meeting , it was at first politely turned aside and then systematically ripped apart . French presidential spokesman Jean Musitelli called the plan &quot; arrogant and silly &quot; and said Mitterrand had likened its sudden , last-minute appearance to the appearance of &quot; a UFO. &quot; The summit participants themselves -- apparently at pains not to embarrass the U.S. President -- used more measured language . The problems Clinton encountered demonstrate in a foreign setting some of the difficulties he has encountered at_home : Despite signs of solid economic_growth , including the creation of 3.8 million jobs since he took_office , and low inflation , Clinton ' s standing in opinion polls continues to sag . Similarly , the strength of the U.S. economy has not translated into boosting his standing among the other leading industrialized democracies at the summit . Ironically , when President George_Bush attended his final economic summit conference , in 1992 , the United States had led the world into recession -- it was about to turn the corner into a then-unseen recovery -- but Bush ' s leadership was unquestioned . As portrayed by senior aides , Clinton did not try to press what had been a central element in his program here because he thought it was not worth a serious argument with Mitterrand . &quot; Mitterrand was being Mitterrand , &quot; a senior White_House official said , referring to the_French president ' s reputation for upholding France ' s independent course . The official added , &quot; The President decided , ' Who cares ? ' &quot; But others , in Washington , were sharply critical of Clinton ' s retreat after he advanced the proposal . &quot; This was being touted as another indication of Clinton taking_charge , and the G-7 responded . This is his breakthrough ? What happened ? &quot; said a Republican who has been involved in past summits . Administration officials thought they had done the groundwork for the proposal , sending_out a letter 10 days before the summit spelling_out the President ' s plan to each of the other six participants . But in informal talks among their aides Friday night , there were private hints of trouble , and Saturday the proposal was quickly dismissed . Germany ' s chief government spokesman , Dieter Vogel , painted a scene in which Clinton ' s proposal was gradually picked_apart , at first cautiously and politely by Kohl and then in more direct , blunt language by Mitterrand and European Union Executive Commission President Jacques Delors . Collectively , the three are by far the most experienced summit participants and certainly among the most politically savvy . Berlusconi , the summit host , also came_down hard on the Clinton idea at his closing news_conference . All argued that the plan ' s ambitious goal , to tackle a whole new set of highly emotive trade issues before the dust had settled from last year ' s bruising conclusion to the Uruguay Round of global trade talks , was at best premature . Of far greater importance to Clinton ' s summit partners , however , was their view of his plan as a danger to the delicate and crucial process of ratifying the Uruguay Round accord . Delors and Mitterrand reportedly argued that this danger is especially strong in some southern European and key developing nations , such_as India , where approval of the agreement came only after fierce political battles . Most nations have yet to go_through this process , which they hope to complete by January . The impact of the negative reception was swift and final : Less than an hour after presenting what White_House aides had been billing as the major U.S. initiative at the summit , the President was forced to put it back in his pocket . The final communique contained no mention of either the Clinton plan or the ideas central to it . &quot; Mr. Clinton was apparently influenced by the discussions and did not insist , &quot; Vogel said . According to various accounts of the incident , which occurred during the nearly four-hour morning session , only Major gave Clinton enthusiastic support , and Kohl praised some of its ideas before &quot; suggesting &quot; that it was flawed . During their meeting Saturday , the seven nations did agree on two concrete proposals to help Russia and Ukraine . Expressing &quot; deep concern &quot; about the economy of Ukraine , they agreed to provide $ 4 billion in loans over the next two years -- on condition that Ukraine &quot; renews its commitment to comprehensive market reform. &quot; In fact , Ukraine has yet to begin to reform its economy , and its Soviet-style system , based on control by the central government , is_on the verge of collapse . Desperate Ukrainian job-seekers have begun to pour over the Russian border , alarming Moscow and the West . Apart from the summit ' s aid plan , Clinton has proposed a separate $ 5-billion package for Ukraine . In addition , the summit approved $ 200 million to help Ukraine close the Chernobyl nuclear_power plant . European Union leaders have already promised $ 600 million to prevent further radiation leakage from the damaged reactor and to bring three other nuclear_reactors up_to Western standards . The 12-member European group wants Washington and Tokyo to kick_in $ 700 million more , bringing the total to $ 1.5 billion -- enough to start the cleanup job . Still , the aid package is likely to satisfy neither Kiev nor Moscow . Ukrainian officials have put the cost of a Chernobyl retrofit at up_to $ 8 billion . The seven nations also approved an expansion of the International Monetary Fund ' s lending program , a move that could allow Russia to borrow more_than $ 1 billion more from the IMF .
