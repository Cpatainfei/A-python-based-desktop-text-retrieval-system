   <HEADLINE> THE TOMATO KING OF GREENSBURG , PA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> People are competitive about their garden tomatoes in Greensburg , Pa. , my home town . Certainly my dad was . The main rivalry focused_on who had the first ripe tomato in town . The second was deciding who grew the most perfect-looking tomato . The third , for which my dad always took the prize , was whose tomatoes tasted best . Dad ' s tomato mentor was Dan Antonucci , who taught him how tomatoes were grown back in Italy and gave him seeds from his own garden , heirloom tomato varieties Antonucci ' s family had brought over in the early 1900s . Some of them no one could identify . Dad would save the seeds from his favorites , and year after year he produced the meatiest Romas , the plumpest little yellow pear tomatoes and the biggest , bumpiest , most luscious beefsteaks in western Pennsylvania . Dad took great pride in the fact that he followed Antonucci ' s old-fashioned gardening practices . He scoffed when all_the other neighbors used pesticides and artificial fertilizers . My dad was convinced that this was why his tomatoes tasted better than any others -- except Antonucci ' s , of course . He chose the sunniest spots in the corner of our back yard to grow his beauties . A small brick wall held_up a 10x10-foot raised bed dedicated to his tomatoes . It was_on this wall that I sat every summer , saltshaker in_hand , awaiting my first bite of warm ripe tomato . That moment became a sacred yearly ritual for my father and me . As a child , I devoured tomatoes as if they were juicy peaches . My mom made me stay outside to eat them because I loved the feel of the juices dripping down my chin . The sweet smell of the tomato intoxicated me as well , and I hoped that rinsing my hands would not wash_away the scent . When I wanted to splurge , I made my favorite sandwich of thick slices of beefsteak tomato , home-grown onions , lettuce and mayonnaise on soft white_bread . I was in paradise . * Toward the end of the growing season , we ate lots of unripe green tomatoes . Mom would bread and fry them . Dad dipped them in garlic and oil and grilled them next to rib eye steaks . My brothers hated them ; I couldn ' t get enough . * Ratatouille is a classic dish that is treated differently by every cook . It is the recipe of choice when your neighbor brings you one more basketful of vegetables from her prolific summer garden . Slow oven-roasting deepens the flavors . Traditionally , each vegetable is cooked separately . Ros Creasy , author and gardening expert , and I agree that cooking them all together encourages the various vegetables to blend and absorb one another ' s flavors . Double the recipe if you want leftovers . Toss ratatouille with pasta , serve as a bed under grilled fish_fillets or as an appetizer with plenty of bread , salty olives , aioli and glasses of red_wine . OVEN-ROASTED RATATOUILLE 2 to 3 medium tomatoes , seeded and cut_into 1- to 2-inch pieces 1 medium eggplant ( globe , rosa bianca or Japanese ) , peeled , cut_into 1- to 2-inch pieces 1 medium sweet red_pepper , seeded and cut_into 1-inch squares 1 medium yellow onion , cut_into 1-inch chunks 2 medium golden summer_squash , cut_into 1-inch pieces 4 cloves garlic , finely chopped 10 cloves garlic , optional 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive_oil 4 to 5 fresh oregano or sage sprigs 1 / 3 cup fruity red_wine 1 / 4 cup coarsely chopped fresh basil Salt Freshly ground pepper Place tomatoes , eggplant , sweet red_pepper , onions and squash in heavy 3-quart baking dish . Add garlic , oil , oregano and wine . Toss with vegetables . Bake , covered , at 350 degrees 30 minutes . Remove from oven and baste vegetables with pan juices . Cover again and bake until vegetables are very tender , 15 to 30 minutes longer . ( In this dish , vegetables should not be al dente. ) Mix_in basil . Season to taste with salt and pepper . Let ratatouille cool slightly before serving . Makes 4 to 6 servings . * Tomatoes , pears , chiles and potatoes are all_in season at_the_same_time . Bring them together on one plate to create an earthy dinner that is hearty and soul-satisfying . GRILLED LAMB CHOPS WITH TOMATO , PEAR , CHUTNEY AND CHILE- MASHED POTATOES 1 cup virgin olive_oil 3 tablespoons red_wine 2 tablespoons finely chopped garlic 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh rosemary 1 / 2 teaspoon freshly ground black_pepper 1 teaspoon salt 4 ( 5-ounce ) lamb loin chops Chile-Mashed Potatoes Tomato-Pear Chutney Finely chopped fresh mint In large bowl combine oil , wine , chopped garlic , rosemary , pepper and salt . Add lamb chops , turning_to coat thoroughly on both sides . Marinate 2 hours or more at room_temperature , turning occasionally . Remove lamb chops from marinade and pan-fry or grill until done . To serve , place about 3 / 4 cup Chile-Mashed Potatoes on each dinner_plate . Arrange lamb chop on side of potatoes . Garnish with 2 generous tablespoons Tomato-Pear Chutney . Sprinkle lamb chop with mint to taste . Makes 4 servings . Chile-Mashed Potatoes 2 pounds boiling potatoes , preferably new potatoes , peeled , cut_into chunks if large 1 / 4 cup unsalted butter 1 / 2 cup sour_cream 2 tablespoons finely chopped Anaheim or serrano chiles 1 / 4 to 1 / 2 cup milk Salt In large pan cook potatoes in abundant boiling water until soft . Drain . While potatoes are still hot , mash in butter , sour_cream and chiles and add milk gradually until potatoes are light and fluffy . Season to taste with salt . Tomato-Pear Chutney 2 cups peeled , seeded and coarsely chopped tomatoes 2 cups peeled , cored and coarsely chopped pears 1 medium yellow onion , coarsely chopped 1 cup raisins 2 cups light-brown sugar , packed 1 cup cider_vinegar 1 / 4 cup finely chopped ginger root 2 tablespoons mustard_seeds 2 cinnamon sticks 2 green chiles , seeded and chopped 2 teaspoons salt In 2-quart nonreactive pan combine tomatoes , pears , onion , raisins , sugar , vinegar , ginger root , mustard_seeds , cinnamon sticks , chiles and salt . Simmer over low heat , mixing occasionally , until all fruit is tender and chutney begins to thicken , about 1 hour . Remove cinnamon sticks . Reserve as much chutney as desired for this meal . Spoon remaining mixture into sterilized jars . Place lids on top and store in refrigerator up_to 6 weeks or in cool , dark place . Makes 5 to 6 pints . * This is possibly the best way to eat a perfectly ripe , juicy tomato . However , the success of this dish lies entirely in the quality of the ingredients . Don ' t even bother serving it unless the tomatoes are as sweet as sugar . Use top-quality olive_oil and fresh , delicate mozzarella . They ' re worth a_few cents more . If you can find boconcini or small mozzarella balls , they are wonderful . If you can ' t find three different kinds of basil , the sweet green variety will do just fine . TOMATO , ONION , FRESH MOZZARELLA AND THREE-BASIL SALAD 3 pounds ripe tomatoes , room-temperature , thickly sliced 1 medium red_onion , very thinly sliced 1 cup fresh basil leaves of any combination of sweet green , purple , lemon , cinnamon , Thai or chocolate , coarsely chopped , plus several sprigs for garnish 6 to 8 ounces fresh mozzarella , thickly sliced 1 / 4 to 1 / 3 cup extra-virgin olive_oil 4 to 6 tablespoons balsamic or red_wine vinegar Salt Freshly ground black_pepper Layer tomatoes , onion and chopped basil on large platter . Top with mozzarella slices . Drizzle with oil and sprinkle with vinegar . Season to taste with salt and pepper . Garnish with sprigs of fresh basil . Makes 4 servings .</TEXT>
