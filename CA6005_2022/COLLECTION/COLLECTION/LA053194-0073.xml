   <HEADLINE> THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON : ' HEAD OF THE CLASS ' IN DEALS FINANCING ; COMPANY TOWN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If this year ' s Cannes International Film Festival produced remarkably few memorable business_deals , one small exception was the $ 8.5-million sale of George Harrison ' s Handmade Films to Paragon Entertainment Corp . of Toronto . The sale brought an end to the former Beatle ' s movie-making career and gave expansion-minded Paragon the rights to a modest but desirable film library that includes &quot; Time Bandits , &quot; &quot; Life of Brian &quot; and &quot; Mona Lisa. &quot; Brokering the deal was Intermedia / FilmEquities , an investment banking firm that ' s making its own waves in international entertainment financing . Intermedia ' s Joseph N . Cohen , Malcolm Reeve and Nigel Sinclair advised Polygram International on the formation of its Polygram Filmed Entertainment . They also consult with Bertelsmann Music Group and , along with Creative Artists Agency ' s John Ptak , helped assemble an independent financing package with a potential value of $ 140 million for directors Ridley and Tony Scott . &quot; We like to think we can throw as_many bodies at these deals as a major Wall_Street ( brokerage ) house , even though we ' re a boutique , &quot; Cohen said . Industry sources call Cohen the primary strategist at the aggressive Beverly Hills firm . He has extensive industry experience but is probably best known for helping to create Largo Entertainment , the Japanese-backed production company that fell_short_of its lofty goals under producer Larry Gordon . Reeve spent 10 years at NHI Nelson Entertainment International Limited . Sinclair is a veteran Hollywood lawyer who co-founded Sinclair Tenenbaum &amp; Co . Inc. The firm is in the same office as Intermedia , which has 10 employees . &quot; Our different worlds can work together quite well , &quot; Reeve said . &quot; Our best moments have come during brainstorming , think-tank sessions. &quot; Intermedia ' s specialties are media investment banking and movie and TV packaging . In the packaging area , the company claims to have raised more_than $ 500 million to support some 60 movie and TV projects with its partners . Producer Richard Lewis , who received the firm ' s help in_lining up foreign backing for Trilogy Entertainment Group , says Intermedia is &quot; at the head of the class when it comes_to the very complicated financing arrangements. &quot; Cohen , Reeve and Sinclair see their next challenge in conquering the world of new media . &quot; Joint_ventures are ever more attractive , &quot; Sinclair said . * While Walt Disney Studios already has a partner called Cinergi , the best example of synergy may be coming from another subsidiary , Miramax Films . * After selling nearly 70 # 000 copies of a book containing the screenplay and pictures from &quot; The Piano &quot; through Disney ' s Hyperion publishing division , Miramax plans to aggressively expand its output to as_many as 12 books a year . The company inaugurated the division with a party at L.A. ' s trendy Monkey Bar on Saturday for people attending the American Booksellers convention . &quot; I ' m passionate about it , &quot; Miramax ' s Harvey Weinstein said . &quot; We feel we can do_well in this field . Ultimately , we ' ll live and die by our taste. &quot; Upcoming books include a full novel inspired by &quot; The Piano ; &quot; author David Rabe ' s novelization of &quot; The Crossing Guard , &quot; based on a Miramax film from Sean Penn , and &quot; You So Crazy , &quot; taken from the Martin Lawrence movie . * Weinstein plans to apply the same tenacious marketing approach that he and his brother , Bob , used on films such_as &quot; The Crying Game &quot; and &quot; Tie Me Up , Tie Me Down , &quot; to sell their books . &quot; The Piano &quot; screenplay was augmented by personal observations from the participants and museum-quality stills from the film . An Academy Awards-night video of director / writer Jane Campion discussing &quot; The Piano &quot; will accompany the arrival of the novel in_stores . &quot; The Crossing Guard &quot; book arrives shortly before the movie_starring Jack Nicholson , in what Weinstein sees as cross-promotional paradise . Inspired by its recent hit movie , &quot; Like Water for Chocolate , &quot; Miramax has also commissioned a Mexican cookbook called &quot; An Appetite for Passion. &quot; Weinstein credits much of the book division ' s marketing success to Donna Daniels , vice_president of communications . He says upcoming projects include a novel from Paul Auster and the autobiography of boxer Sugar Ray Leonard . Weinstein met Leonard at the infamous Friar ' s Club Roast for Whoopie Goldberg last year . An avid boxing fan , he eventually persuaded Leonard to co-author his life_story for Miramax . &quot; We also told him he could star in our next seven movies , &quot; said Weinstein , adding : &quot; Not really . If we did that and he found_out it wasn ' t true , it would n ' t be pretty. &quot; * Talk_about gone but not forgotten . Wyatt Earp ' s story has already been retold once this year in Cinergi ' s &quot; Tombstone. &quot; Next , it ' s retold again in next month ' s &quot; Wyatt Earp &quot; from Warner Bros . Now comes word that Orion Home Video plans to release an Earp special starring Hugh O ' Brien , reprising his early TV role as the lawman in &quot; Wyatt Earp : Return to Tombstone. &quot; Produced by Rob Word in association with CST Entertainment Imaging , this Earp includes colorized scenes from the original 226 TV episodes . By summer ' s end , it ' ll either be Earp-o-mania or a serious case of Earp overkill .</TEXT>
