   <HEADLINE> SHARK KILLS SANTA BARBARA SKIN DIVER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A shark , apparently a great white , killed a commercial diver in the waters off San Miguel Island on Friday -- the state ' s first confirmed death from a shark attack in nearly six years . Santa Barbara resident James Robinson , 42 , was treading water near his boat when the shark swooped in_for a swift , brutal attack . Robinson had just finished a routine dive to scout for sea_urchins and had deposited his equipment aboard his boat . His two crew_members were putting_away the equipment when they heard Robinson scream -- and whirled_around to see him drifting unconscious in a gush of blood . &quot; His right leg was nearly severed , and his left leg had puncture wounds on it , &quot; said Francis Oliver , a diver who came_to Robinson ' s aid after hearing his crew mates ' distress call . &quot; It was pretty gruesome. &quot; A veteran diver , Robinson was attacked about 9:45 a.m. half a mile off the coast of San Miguel Island , which lies_about 40 miles west of Santa Barbara . * Crew_members on Robinson ' s boat , the Florentia Marie , tried to revive him but could not find a pulse . A Coast Guard helicopter rushed Robinson to Goleta Valley Community Hospital , where he was pronounced dead of massive trauma at 11:15 a.m. Neither of the crew_members saw the attack . But Coast Guard officials said they believe Robinson was targeted by a great_white_shark , a keen-eyed predator that can grow_up to 20 feet long and can sink its serrated teeth through a surfer and surfboard with one swift bite . &quot; They say it ' s like a bullet . . . you never see the one that hit you , &quot; urchin diver Jeffery Gunning said . &quot; I just hope it went quick for Jimmy. &quot; Before entering the sea_urchin business , Robinson had worked for years as a deep-sea_diver for an offshore oil_rig in the North_Sea near the_English Channel . After settling in Santa Barbara , he quickly absorbed the California lifestyle . Deeply tanned , with blond curly hair and an athletic build , Robinson loved surfing and diving -- any activities that would keep him in the sun or in the water . Gracious and vivacious , Robinson was popular both in the harbor and in the neighborhood . &quot; You always hear about the good dying young , and golly , this guy was just one of the best , &quot; longtime diver Steve Rebuck said . &quot; He will really be missed. &quot; Most professional divers realize that great_white_sharks haunt the waters around San Miguel Island , where they feast on seals and sea_lions . But their lurking presence has not deterred divers from prowling the ocean_floor for valuable sea_urchins , abalone and lobsters . It is a threat most divers take_in stride . &quot; If you ' re frightened by it , you have no business being in the business , &quot; Rebuck said . &quot; More people are killed by lightning and bee_stings than by shark attacks. &quot; Although great_white_sharks bump , bite and scare several people a year in California , fatalities are rare . No deadly attacks have been confirmed since UCLA graduate_student Tamara McCallister was killed by a great white off Malibu in February , 1989 . A kayaker , McCallister was found dead with a 13-inch chunk of flesh torn from her thigh . In a more recent incident , a woman ' s shark-bitten body was found off the San Diego coast last April . But the county coroner said the victim may already have been dead when the great white gnawed_at her body . * To protect themselves from attack , veteran divers usually descend to the ocean_floor as quickly as possible . Once on the bottom , they can hide among rocks and shadows . Eventually , however , they must rise to the surface , where their wet-suited bodies are vulnerable . &quot; It ' s one of the risks of diving , &quot; Gunning said . &quot; We become part of the food_chain when we enter the water. &quot; As a precaution , several divers in Northern California have begun to tuck plastic pistols in their wet suits before jumping into shark-infested waters , Rebuck said . But most locals rely_on a more low-tech survival technique : when face to face with a great white , they &quot; say three Hail_Marys and four Our Fathers , &quot; diver Matt Barnes said . In the waters around San Miguel Island , divers have learned to check for sharks by studying the behavior of the sea_lions and seals that carpet the beaches . If the animals look spooked -- or if any appear mauled -- the divers know to stay away . Even the best precautions , however , are not fail-safe . Sharks sometimes attack humans out of pure curiosity , marine biologist Gary Davis said . And they sometimes confuse divers in wet suits for sleek seals . &quot; They spend a lot of time bumping things on the surface and seeing if anything falls_off , &quot; Davis said . &quot; If it does , they taste it , to see if it ' s something good to eat. &quot; Divers are willing to face such risks in part because the sea_urchin business can be quite lucrative . Divers earn $ 1 to $ 1.60 a pound for the prickly animals , which look_like bristling pincushions . Sea_urchin roe is a delicacy in Japan , prized for its rarity , freshness and delicate taste .
