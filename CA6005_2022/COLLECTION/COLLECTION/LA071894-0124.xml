   <HEADLINE> JIM MURRAY : WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FINAL ; HOKEY FINISH can ' t CHEAPEN VALUE OF PRIZE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Oh , dear ! Or , rather , oh-oh ! The two best soccer teams on the planet struggled through three periods of the game Sunday and neither could score . Brazil won the World Cup , 0-0 . Brazil won it from the free-throw line , so to say . It was like watching two woolly_mammoths struggle in a tar_pit all afternoon and end_up gumming each other to death . It ' s kind of embarrassing . What they do_in situations like this is , after 22 guys run and kick and dribble and trip each other for 120 minutes , they put the ball at point-blank range and give each team five kicks at it . Even then , they miss . It ' s only 12 yards into a goal eight yards wide , but the World Cup went flying down to Rio when the guy who is supposed to be one of the two best strikers of the soccer_ball in the world , Roberto Baggio , kicked the ball_over the goal . If you can picture a World_Series scoreless tie_in Game 7 in which they decide the championship by a home_run derby with key players or a base-stealing contest , you get_the_picture . It ' s the first World Cup_final decided this way . It ' s really a kind of crapshoot . Like cutting the cards or maybe deciding a heavyweight championship fight after regulation by having the fighters held by someone and letting the opponents see who can score the most knockdowns . As unclassical as it was , it was exciting . You can bet Brazil likes it just fine . So , strike_up the marimbas ! Get Carmen Miranda to put a bunch of bananas in her hat and give us a chorus of Chicky-chicky-boom-boom . Get the conga_line going . Tell the gang at Copacabana beach to break_out the rum and Coca-Cola for all hands . As for the forces from Forza Italia , hold the fettuccine . Nobody feels_like eating . Tell Pavarotti to forget &quot; Funiculi , Funicula. &quot; Maybe &quot; Laugh , Clown , Laugh &quot; would be more like it . Sorry , paisan . I don ' t know if they have &quot; goats &quot; in World Cups like World_Series , but if they do , I hate to say this , but I have to feel Roberto Baggio must fill the bill . Poor guy ! He came_up_to the postgame showdown with his team down 3-2 in penalty kicks . If he makes_it , he at least forces the fifth Brazilian kicker to make his shot to win . He kicked it clean over the top of the goal . that ' s 8 feet high . He had just kicked the Cup to South_America . His chief rival for player of the tournament , a flamboyant Carioca who , like Picasso and Napoleon and Madonna and Cher , goes_by one name -- Romario -- made his penalty kick . But I have to say it hit the post first . If it was inartistic by football purists ' standards , it was probably better than the alternative . The way these two teams were going , they might have gone the rest of the year without scoring . You know how that announcer became famous in Cup contests shouting &quot; G-o-o-o-o-l ! &quot; Well , Sunday , he would have had to yell &quot; S-a-a-a-v-e ! &quot; or &quot; O-o-o-ps ! &quot; Even uncontested from the 12-yard line , four of nine missed . It was like having a putt-off to decide the U.S. Open . But you have to say the Great Soccer Experiment was a crashing success . You know , we export our national sports to other countries . But not the World_Series . Not the Super Bowl . Not the Final Four . We export exhibition_games , demonstration sports . These guys gave us the whole enchilada . The United States got the greatest soccer spectacle in the world . We got the greatest players , the greatest teams and an event that occurs only every four years . It was a great party . More_than 3.5 million spectators jammed nine venues . The gross , figuring an average of $ 100 a ticket , was $ 350 million not counting TV receipts . For that , you cheerfully do penalty kicks . Penalty kicks ordinarily are awarded for infractions in the penalty area . Even the victorious goalkeeper , Claudio Taffarel , described the postgame kick-off as &quot; a lottery. &quot; He blocked only one of the three shots Italy missed . Does this now mean Brazil is the best team in the world ? Well , you play by house rules whether it ' s in a Vegas casino or a floating crap_game . After all , Brazil penalty kicks went_in the goal . The one miss was blocked . In the history books , it goes_down as a victory . Same as 5-0 even though FIFA will list the score as 0-0 . Brazil won , it is the World Cup champion by house rules . As the golfer Lloyd Mangrum , when criticized for not playing classic golf from tee to green but proceeding to one putt his way to victory , asked sweetly : &quot; Are we playing how or how many ? &quot; Brazil can say the same . It was playing how many -- and it had the most . can ' t wait till 1998 .</TEXT>
