   <HEADLINE> IN A LAMENT OF THE OLD ' ESTABLISHMENT , ' HOLLYWOOD ENCOUNTERS ANTI-SEMITISM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Reading an article , &quot; The New Establishment , &quot; in the October Vanity_Fair and scanning the accompanying photo of 16 movers and shakers in America ' s new communications megalith , William Cash says he was piqued . Cash , a Hollywood reporter for London ' s conservative Daily Tele- graph , was irked by the magazine ' s own coy question , &quot; Is there anything that binds this group of men ? &quot; That answer , as Cash delivers it in a scurrilous piece in the Oct . 29 issue of England ' s Spectator , is that they are &quot; predominantly &quot; Jewish . ( Actually , nine of the 16 are Jewish -- but Cash isn ' t about to let a little arithmetic get_in the way of a polemic. ) More , Cash writes that the reason the New Establishment is predominantly Jewish is that it actively excludes Gentiles . The article might be dismissed as an anti-Semitic bleat from a reactionary crackpot if it didn ' t have a respectable platform in the Spectator and didn ' t play to a pre-existing prejudice -- that Jews control the U.S. media . But here the canard is given new impetus in an environment of anti- political correctness , where hostility often passes for honesty . Cash realizes his discovery will trigger the &quot; inevitable shrieks of anti-Semitism &quot; -- and it has -- though he seems willing to brave these attacks in the interest of social_science . This New Establishment is a &quot; culturally maladroit and culturally nihilist ( sic ) &quot; band , Titans of Tripe , Cash calls them after Auberon Waugh , who wear , &quot; nylon jogging anoraks , fluffy white socks , digital_watches and faded jeans. &quot; You call this a power_structure ! Once upon a glorious time , Cash laments , power was in the hands ( or the feet ) of a white-shoe aristocracy . These were well-born , well-educated , well-dressed men ( at least when wearing wingtips ) -- culturally adroit and not at all nihilistic . They looked and acted the part of the Establishment -- in fact , very much like the_British Establishment . Nothing arriviste here . They ruled seigneurially and sartorially . But now the big feet of the New Establishment wear white socks -- and sneakers . These power_brokers -- including Rupert Murdoch of Fox Film and Television , Bill Gates of Microsoft computer-operating systems , John C . Malone of the Tele-Communications cable empire , not to mention the Jews among them -- have not only nudged aside the Old Establishment . Their cabal practices , in Cash ' s analysis , are a &quot; reverse form of class or racial discrimination , &quot; denying access to &quot; Wasps , blacks and Brits. &quot; French , too ? As evidence of what he calls the feudal power_structure of Hollywood , Cash adduces the recent formation of a new studio by Jewish director Steven Spielberg , Jewish record mogul David Geffen and Jewish former Disney executive Jeffrey Katzenberg , whom Cash castigates for green-lighting two movies , &quot; Aspen Extreme &quot; and &quot; Love Trouble. &quot; &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; &quot; Aladdin &quot; and &quot; The Lion King , &quot; which Katzenberg also green-lighted , apparently escaped his attention . Quoting from an account in the Wall_Street Journal , Cash recounts how this triumvirate sought the &quot; rabbinical &quot; blessing of MCA ' s long-time Chairman Lew R . Wasserman , the &quot; last surviving Jewish founder-builder of a studio , &quot; in Cash ' s description . ( Wasserman is a man of legendary proportions , but it would have taken preternatural precociousness for him to have founded Universal Pictures in 1912 -- before he was born. ) For Cash , this is sinister , like a capo petitioning a godfather -- Cash ' s own analogy . It seems never to have occurred to him that the three sought Wasserman ' s advice or wanted to know what Wasserman was going_to do with his bosses at MCA ' s parent company , Mashushita , before they made their own move . Did I say bosses ? Can it be that the godfather of the Jewish cabal that excludes Wasps , blacks and Brits pays obeisance to a higher authority ? It can , because the studios and telecommunications empires that Cash identifies as predominantly Jewish are owned and controlled by non-Jews : MCA by Mashushita , Columbia and Tri-Star by Sony , Fox by Murdoch , Time-Warner by stockholders and a corporate board . Ignoring the facts to suit his myth of Jewish control , Cash is in a long tradition of anti-Semites who began smiting Jewish movie executives almost from the moment the Jews entered the film_industry in the 1910s . One reform group demanded that movies be liberated &quot; from the hands of the_devil and 500 un-Christian Jews. &quot; Another religious zealot blasted Hollywood Jews for the &quot; seduction of hundreds of thoughtless girls every day , &quot; which he ascribed , euphemistically , to a general &quot; Europeanization &quot; of the country . Henry_Ford , in his Dearborn Independent , cited Jewish control of the film_industry and said , &quot; It is the genius of that race to create problems of a moral character in whatever business they achieve a majority. &quot; The idea was that Jews were somehow different from the majority of Gentile Americans . Jews didn ' t subscribe_to the same values . They had taken_control of this powerful instrument of social_control , but they couldn ' t use it responsibly . Whether by design or sheer ignorance , they were said to be using the movies to subvert so-called traditional values , though anyone who studies film history knows , no group was more conscious of traditional values or more eagerly sought to purvey them than the Jewish movie pioneers -- who regarded themselves as American first , Jewish second . In those days , opponents characterized the Jews as vulgar and mercenary . Cash characterizes them , at best , as &quot; compulsive story-tellers and talented negotiators , &quot; at worst , as parvenu protectionists . In his ugliest aside , he describes a beleaguered Gentile would-be producer who has dressed as a Jew , attempting to pass . His uniform ? A black nylon track suit , gold chains on his wrists and a &quot; chunky &quot; Star_of_David around his neck . No one could , or should , deny that the motion-picture industry is disproportionately Jewish at the creative executive level -- since Jews constitute roughly 4 % of the population . Nor could , or should , anyone deny that the first generation of Hollywood pioneers created the industry , in part , as an empire they could govern after being denied access to the old , East Coast Establishment . Yet , it never seems to have occurred to Cash that what unites the members of the New Establishment -- as it united the Jews and Catholics of the old Hollywood -- is a sense of marginality . Looking over the roster of Vanity_Fair ' s &quot; 16 , &quot; one sees children of the middle_class struggling to reach the top , college dropouts , even a_few dyslexics who said they had to work harder because they were regarded_as stupid . Perhaps it doesn ' t occur to Cash because to stigmatize these high achievers would be stigmatizing effort , achievement , merit . Stigmatizing Jews is much easier -- especially since many are loath to fight_back . ( In a New York Times article on the Cash controversy , not one Jewish executive was willing to go_on record. ) But Jews are only an excuse and opportunity . The deeper issue has always been power . Genteel elitists couldn ' t abide the fact that they were losing_control of the culture to individuals they regarded_as socially inferior -- even though , as Cash points_out , citing my book , &quot; An Empire of Their Own : How the Jews Invented Hollywood &quot; in approving support , the Jewish moguls slavishly imitated the old Establishment as they unwittingly helped destroy it . They attempted to remake themselves in its image . The cardinal sin of the New Establishment in its symbolic white socks is that it doesn ' t give_a_damn about white shoes . Its members don ' t want to imitate their social betters because , in Cash ' s view , they are too myopic to recognize that the old Establishment is better than they . They have the temerity to see the old elite and its institutions as , in Cash ' s words , &quot; anachronistic jokes. &quot; This seems to hit Cash where he lives , but at least he is no hypocrite about it . He obviously believes Hollywood and the world would be better places if the New Establishment and its nine Jews would hand culture back to the people who deserve it -- people presumably like Cash . At the very least , they should share their power . He closes by citing the &quot; white-sock mediocracy &quot; as &quot; another example of how driven Jews have always dealt with exclusion . Barred from one form of Establishment , they have ended_up helping to create their own. &quot; Similarly , an article like Cash ' s is another example of how powerless elitists have always dealt with exclusion . Barred from one form of Establishment , they end_up spewing anti-Semitic bile. *</TEXT>
