   <TEXT> Why is it necessary to prove that secondhand smoke causes cancer ? It ' s already obvious that the odor and discomforts caused by tobacco smoke are extremely offensive . The majority do not smoke , yet we have had smokers ' habits inflicted on us everywhere . Even without asthma , allergies , emphysema or cancer , we suffer burning eyes , nose and throat , and sore lungs when we ' re exposed to the disgusting pollution of tobacco smoke . It seems obvious that the air we breathe should be protected . Laws restrict offensive language , sexual_harassment , and the pollution of public spitting and pet droppings . If surveyed , the nonsmoking majority would likely respond that secondhand smoke is a far greater problem than these other offensive acts . Philip Morris U.S.A. has prepared the full-page , four-part series appearing in The Times ( June 28-July 1 , reprised July 3 ) , to refute the scientific evidence which proves secondhand smoke is harmful to our health . It also distributed misleading petitions in the attempt to qualify an initiative to undo laws which restrict smoking . The publicity and politics of the tobacco_industry are well-funded , but the industry is doomed . Public_opinion will demand laws to restrict exposure to secondhand smoke . SUSAN D . KLINE Costa Mesa * As a passive victim of secondhand smoke I would like to reply to the full_page in which cigarette maker Philip Morris presents its case against the EPA ' s conclusion and the science behind its case against secondhand smoke . I have never been a smoker , but some years ago I went_for a physical checkup which included X-rays of my chest which caused the doctor to ask , &quot; Were you ever a smoker ? &quot; When I told him I wasn ' t he replied , &quot; Well , you have a scar on your lungs which indicates that at one time you might have been. &quot; I explained to him that my ex-wife and I had been married for over 20 years and that every time we got_into the car the first thing she did when I started the motor was to &quot; light up. &quot; During the cold winter months when we were living back in New York , the car ' s windows were closed and I suffered bouts of nausea .
