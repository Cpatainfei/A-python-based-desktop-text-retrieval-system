   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; A BURNING ' PASSION ' FOR ANCIENT ART ; THE GETTY SNARES THE FIRST PUBLIC DISPLAY OF ONE OF THE WORLD ' S BEST PRIVATE COLLECTIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The grandiose &quot; treasures &quot; exhibitions of recent memory were a lot of fun , despite critical grumbling . One essential quality they really did lack , however , was a sense of the personal . They were like sultanic elephants designed by committee . All the same , now that they ' re gone we miss them and the good times they represented . As if to both cheer us and correct the shortcomings of the past , the J . Paul Getty Museum presents an exhibition that is , hands_down , the best thing of its kind we ' ve seen in living memory . The sort of event the public should embrace and artniks revere , it marks the first public display of one of the world ' s best private collections of ancient art from the Mediterranean world . * &quot; A Passion for Antiquities : Ancient Art From the Collection of Barbara and Lawrence Fleischman &quot; encompasses more_than 200 objects from ancient Etruria , Greece and Rome . Its curators are the Getty ' s Marion True and Arielle Kozloff of the Cleveland Museum of Art , where the ensemble will travel after closing here . Scholars will find its copiously illustrated , carefully annotated catalogue indispensable . Casual visitors should be delighted with an installation design revolving around themes rather than formal categories . They emphasize the human factor that created this art and inspired the Fleischmans to collect it with such a heartfelt intuitive grasp of its intrinsic meaning . The overarching theme of all this art is our species ' striving to transcend its animal_nature while retaining vitality . The exhibition ' s earliest work , a magnificent marble Cycladic &quot; Head of an Idol , &quot; was made about 2600 BC . It has an awe-some simplicity that evokes humankind ' s earliest impulse to control the universe through rational thought . Little more_than a smooth slab of marble with an inquiring nose , it is like a philosopher ' s touchstone . No wonder modern artists like Brancusi were so taken with such work . If its directness strikes anyone as esoteric , there is an endearing little &quot; Beak Spouted Jug &quot; nearby whose pulled-back neck evokes a small bird drinking . In a way it echoes the head ' s combination of rational thought and natural observation . Looks practical too . The whole exhibition has this quality of revelation . Gold jewelry , for example , usually attracts some of the value of the material and puts others off for the same reason . Here intricacy and artifice take the day . Earrings not 2 inches tall bear fully modeled figures of a winged woman . A pair of piping satyrs are even smaller . It ' s the art that counts , but we are reminded that the special physical qualities of gold make_it possible . Objects are generally small , but it costs them no power . A section on animals includes a late Roman folding tripod whose uprights are topped with muscular horses . Their naturalism echoes exaggerated in other Hellenistic works like a Farnese-style statuette of Herakles and another of Jupiter clearly based on a Greek model . Of the various sections , none is more enchanting and impressive than &quot; The World of Dionysos. &quot; The Greek god of wine and revelry was , quite logically , also the patron of the theater . Barbara Fleischman wanted to be an actress as a young_woman and her sensitivity to the subject shows . Objects here look almost unsettlingly contemporary . A Roman bronze head of an adolescent Dionysos with his long curly hair and look of longing sensuality is a physical type women swoon for to this day . A porky little bronze thought to represent the god as an infant also suggests him as the corpulent old Falstaff buffoon he became as the Bacchus of Rome ( and Disney ' s &quot; Fantasia &quot; ) . But the piece is not jokey . The child ' s heavily lidded eyes bespeak the price of gluttony while his open stance reminds us that the urge to revelry is always a call_back to childhood . The theater ' s tolerance for the unconventional shows in the figure of a mime in drag as a goddess , a grotesque terra-cotta mask and a little comedy face worthy of a modern special-effects artist . But the real showstopper of the section is a wine caldron that looks_like something only Hollywood could have invented . The body of the vessel resembles an ancient Chinese urn run_through the Arabian nights on its way to an Art Nouveau Paris Metro station . Its legs bring modern rolling casters to mind . The smiling figure of Dionysos sprouting irrationally from the object is as delightfully energized as Carpeaux ' s sculpture around the Paris Opera_House . But the piece is , in fact , a unique 1st Century BC object from the much-maligned Roman Hellenistic period . Just goes_to show that our culture is not the first to be gleefully eclectic . The section is followed by an engaging nook of fantastic animals such_as griffins and sirens . There are more sober presentations such_as a grouping of related objects from the Roman provinces , but by then you ' ve already started to absorb the graceful enthusiasms and eye for emotional authenticity that is the essence of this rare collection . * J .
