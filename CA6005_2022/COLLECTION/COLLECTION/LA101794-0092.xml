   <HEADLINE> THIS IS ' LIKE WATER ' FOR REAL ; MOVIES : THOSE LOVE SCENES WERE MORE THAN ACTING IN HIT MEXICAN FILM . THE TWO STARS FOUND ROMANCE AND NOW SHARE A SMALL FLAT IN HOLLYWOOD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Audiences adored Alfonso Arau ' s luscious 1992 &quot; Like Water for Chocolate &quot; and its heady mix of star-crossed lovers , Mexican_Revolution and sensual celebration of food . But even though it grossed an amazing $ 22 million in the United States alone and became the highest-grossing independently produced foreign film of all time , there isn ' t likely to be a &quot; Like Water 2 &quot; any time soon . And that ' s because its stars , Lumi Cavazos and Marco Leonardi , are busy living a real-life love_story as compelling as anything they created on screen . In fact , the couple , who met and fell_in_love in 1991 on the set of &quot; Like Water , &quot; have left their native Mexico and Italy , respectively , and now live together in a sparse Hollywood apartment with Ben-Hur , their docile pit bulldog , and , appropriately , two lovebirds . &quot; We like it here for now , &quot; Cavazos says , standing on the small balcony crowded by a bird cage and dog_house . &quot; I came here because I wanted to be with Marco and he wanted to be with me , &quot; she continues , walking back inside the apartment . &quot; I ' ve been to Marco ' s home_in Italy and he ' s been to mine in Mexico . However , we ' d both prefer to try our luck here , now that our film is still fresh in people ' s minds. &quot; &quot; One day , we were friends , and the next , we were in_love , &quot; says Leonardi , 22 . &quot; Our romance didn ' t affect our performance in the film , &quot; adds Cavazos , 25 , &quot; but the chemistry between us made our love scenes much better. &quot; In Cavazos and Leonardi ' s real-life sequel , a_few things have changed . For one thing , they have plunged into an intensive study of English . &quot; In order to get roles and see agents , we have to know the language , &quot; Cavazos says . When they met on the set of their film , Leonardi says , he spoke only Italian and she only Spanish . On a recent night out on Melrose Avenue , the couple ordered a meal in Italian , spoke_to fans on the street in English and posed for pictures with Spanish-speaking tourists . At home , they generally speak Spanish . And there ' s another difference since &quot; Like Water for Chocolate &quot; : He does the cooking . &quot; I never learned to cook as well as Marcos does , &quot; Cavazos says as Leonardi prepares a pasta dish for lunch . &quot; It ' s never been my passion . My mom was right in telling me that I would n ' t learn cooking in the theater. &quot; The Monterrey-born actress hadn ' t read Laura Esquivel ' s best-selling novel when she first interviewed for the role of Tita . &quot; Afterward , I ran to a bookstore to get the novel , &quot; she says , &quot; and read it several times to imbue myself in the character . I realized how much Tita was like me , coming from a conservative family and all. &quot; * Leonardi shares his recipe for pasta carbonara with a guest and apologizes for the domestic wine . Then he makes a long-distance_call to Italy to ask his mother in Rome for soccer scores . &quot; I call every week . Football is another passion in my life. &quot; As a teen-ager , Leonardi had a chance to become a professional soccer player , but a starring part in &quot; La Esposa es Bellissima &quot; with Angela Molina and Stefania Sandrelli changed his life . His film credits also include Guiseppe Tornatore ' s &quot; Cinema Paradiso , &quot; winner of the 1989 Oscar for best foreign film . &quot; Unlike Lumi ' s , my parents urged me to get_into film , &quot; he says . &quot; My father , who is a journalist , also worked as an movie extra . He got me into TV commercials when I was a kid . I was the youngest ( of four siblings ) , but I never figured_out why he never pushed me into show biz. &quot; For Arau , Leonardi was heaven-sent . &quot; I think Marco is an amulet , a lucky charm , &quot; Arau says . &quot; The leading man ( in ' Like Water ' ) had to be very handsome . that ' s why Tita is so in_love with him . The Mexican actors I planned to use were unavailable . That worried me until I went_to see ' Cinema Paradiso ' and saw Marco. &quot; Cavazos recently signed with ICM in hopes of pursuing mainstream Hollywood features as well as global opportunities . Peter Rawley , head of the international department at ICM , sees a bright future for them . &quot; Both are brilliant actors , &quot; Rawley says . &quot; Lots of overseas actors are coming here , testing and working_on language skills . Speaking perfect English doesn ' t mean you immediately get work -- it just puts you in a tougher category , competing with American actors. &quot; Cavazos recently learned this firsthand when she auditioned for &quot; A Walk in the Clouds , &quot; Arau ' s first English-language film , which stars Keanu Reeves . Her English was deemed adequate , but studio executives at the film ' s studio , Fox , weren ' t convinced of her chemistry with Reeves . Arau , however , says he hopes to work with her again . * Meanwhile , she hasn ' t been idle . She just finished &quot; Tres Destinos , &quot; a Spanish telenovela , in Puerto Rico . While there , she also agreed to star in Joseph B . Vasquez ' s &quot; Rice , Beans and Ketchup , &quot; a film about two Dominican immigrants searching for the American_Dream . &quot; She asked if her boyfriend could be in the film , &quot; says Vasquez , who also directed &quot; The Bronx War. &quot; &quot; We said yes and wrote a part for him as the Italian friend of the lead. &quot; Later this month , Cavazos travels_to Texas to begin filming a James L . Brooks-produced movie , &quot; Bottle Rocket , &quot; a Columbia Pictures release revolving around three men ; she plays the Cuban maid of one of them . ( &quot; Surprisingly , I don ' t have to speak that much English , &quot; she says ) . Leonardi has had preliminary discussions with an American producer about a film in which he would star as a young Italian visiting New York . The couple will go_back to Mexico next month to film &quot; Viva San Isidro ! , &quot; an Italian movie_starring Leonardi . &quot; The film is a fable with comedy , &quot; he says , in which he portrays -- appropriately -- a soccer player ; Cavazos is his love interest . &quot; The characters will speak Spanish , but they will be dubbed into Italian later . Lumi will get a chance to show how good her Italian is. &quot; Later , they walk to a nearby Hollywood park for Ben-Hur ' s daily romp . At a bus_stop , Leonardi spots what he thought was a poster for the home video release of &quot; Like Water. &quot; Instead , it advertises &quot; Love_Affair , &quot; starring Warren Beatty and Annette Bening , another on-screen / off-screen couple . Both stare at the older lovers in a pose similar to their own on the &quot; Like Water &quot; poster . &quot; It looks_like an American remake of ' Like Water , ' 20 years later , &quot; she says . That evening , they watch a dubbed English-language video of &quot; Like Water , &quot; marveling at English coming_out of their mouths . Leonardi says he might take the tape to his language instructor and say : &quot; I speak perfect English . Take a look. &quot; Cavazos , seriously , says that the_English version makes her realize that language is secondary to a good performance . Ben-Hur howls in_agreement . &quot; I don ' t think they dubbed the dog in the_English version of ' Like Water , ' do you ? &quot; she asks Leonardi . &quot; Of course they did , my love , &quot; he says . &quot; They had the dog say , ' Bow-wow ' instead of ' Guau-guau ' in Spanish . Great lip_sync , wasn ' t it ? &quot; ;</TEXT>
