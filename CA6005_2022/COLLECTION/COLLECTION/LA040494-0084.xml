   <HEADLINE> ASIAN STOCKS DOWN ON FEARS OF RATE HIKES ; MARKETS : TOKYO , BANGKOK , OTHER EXCHANGES OPEN LOWER ON WORRIES U.S. ECONOMIC_GROWTH WILL SPUR ACTION BY FED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Asian stock_markets were lower in afternoon trading today after an upbeat U.S. employment report released Friday rekindled concern that the Federal_Reserve will raise short-term rates again to keep inflation in check . Far East investors ' reaction deepened worries that U.S. stocks will dive today . Most U.S. markets were closed on Good_Friday , leaving domestic investors three days to contemplate their next moves . In afternoon trading in Tokyo , the Nikkei stock index was off 269.46 points , or 1.4 % , to 19 # 007.70. In Bangkok , the SET stock index was down 33.26 points to 1 # 199.27 in midday trading , while Kuala Lumpur ' s composite index was off 15.70 points to 944.24. Hong Kong , Sydney and several other Asian markets were closed for holidays . There were other signs that U.S. stocks could plunge early today . In Tokyo trading at midday , futures contracts on the Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 stock index were down about 11 points from last Thursday ' s close , to 435.80. That represents a 2.5 % drop_in the S &amp; P index , or about the same as a 90-point decline in the Dow Jones industrial average . Still , individual investors in the United States appeared to be generally calm over the weekend . Major mutual_fund companies , such_as Fidelity Investments , said weekend calls to place Monday sell orders or to ask_for advice weren ' t much above normal weekend levels . The U.S. stock_market had plunged last Monday through Wednesday , reacting to rising bond yields . Last Thursday , the stock_market rallied a bit , raising hopes that bearish sentiment was ending . Then came Friday ' s U.S. Labor_Department report that the economy last month created 456 # 000 new jobs , the biggest gain in more_than six years . Some bond_trading was conducted Friday even though stock_markets were closed , and bond traders immediately registered their shock at the huge employment gain : The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury_bond zoomed to its highest levels in 14 months , to 7.26 % from 7.08 % Thursday . Unless market interest_rates pull_back sharply early today , before the U.S. stock_market opens , most analysts believe stocks will plummet to reflect the bond market ' s selloff -- and the expectation that the Federal_Reserve will quickly boost short-term interest_rates again , in an attempt to moderate the economy ' s growth . The Fed has raised short rates twice since Feb . 4 , most recently to 3.5 % from 3.25 % on March 22 . At midday today in Tokyo , the U.S. bond futures were trading at yield levels right around 7.26 % . Japanese bond yields rose at the start of Tokyo trading as traders reacted to the jump in U.S. yields Friday . Bond futures for June delivery , currently the active futures contract , were down 0.25 yen at 111.85 yen . The yield on the benchmark No . 157 10-year government_bond was 3.925 % , up 0.06 points . &quot; With U.S. yields at 7.26 % , we can ' t say there won ' t be an effect on Japanese bonds , &quot; said Mikinao Matsushita , a fund manager at BOT Asset Management , a unit of the Bank of Tokyo . &quot; The influence of the U.S. bond price fall , however , will be limited , &quot; Matsushita said . &quot; Actions by the Bank_of_Japan and movements in the currency market could divert attention away from the U.S. &quot; Meanwhile , the dollar was a beneficiary of the surge in bond yields on Friday . After falling to as low as 102.13 yen last Thursday , the dollar was trading at 104.10 yen in Tokyo early today . As for Japanese stocks -- which had surged in the first_quarter , even as most world markets fell -- &quot; the immediate knee-jerk reaction is to hold_off on all equity investment until the sky is clear on Wall_Street , &quot; said Ravi Nandigum , a salesman at Baring Securities . &quot; Once the market starts stabilizing there , we will start to see money coming_back to Japan but in the meantime , we ' ll see cautious trading. &quot;</TEXT>
