   <HEADLINE> THE LAST_FRONTIER ; ON CIVIL RIGHS ' CUTTING_EDGE , GAY AND LESBIAN MANAGERS OFTEN FACE CHOICE BETWEEN OPENNESS AND AMBITION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When &quot; Julie &quot; ( not her real name ) was &quot; outed &quot; by an employee who wanted to sabotage her management career , her company stood_by her . Later , though , when she became more active and visible in lesbian interests , the same company warned her &quot; to pull_back in. &quot; &quot; Hints were given to me , &quot; she said . &quot; If I wanted to advance , I ' d have to toe_the_line a little more. &quot; For gay_men and lesbians , the world of corporate management is fraught with peril and mixed messages . They know full well that in many companies , even those with non-discrimination policies , something that ideally shouldn ' t matter in the workplace -- sexual orientation -- often does . And in the ranks of middle managers -- where a surfeit of baby_boomers jostle for a_few spaces in the executive suite -- every mark , good or bad , counts . The conundrum for gay managers is whether being gay and out of the closet would be the one demerit that would knock them out of contention , or even_out of the job they already have . From leaders of the gay rights movement they hear urgings not just to come_out , but also to serve as role_models for other gays and use their management positions to press for gay-friendly social and employment policies , such_as marriage equivalency and domestic partner benefits . At work , they notice that being part of a minority group often means getting trapped below the &quot; glass ceiling. &quot; They look above them and see no , or few , openly gay people in the executive ranks . And within , they feel a yearning to shed the ruses and the anxiety they bring . Gays are largely alone in wrestling with their dilemmas . So far , big business has virtually ignored the problems gays face in management and executive positions . Homosexuals often miss out on benefits others may derive from affirmative_action programs and diversity efforts . The issue of sexual orientation , one of the final frontiers in the American civil_rights movement , is further complicated by the religious_beliefs of some and the sexual insecurity of many . Indeed , there continues to be contentious national debate about whether gays even have rights , or whether their rights ought to be protected . * Gay_men and lesbian managers say they are sensitive to negative stereotypes of homosexuals as sexual predators . Those whose sexual orientation is known by their peers and superiors say they are constantly measuring their decisions against an unspoken and often indefinable standard of behavior . They are hesitant to hire what others might count as &quot; too many &quot; other gays -- or even members of the same sex -- of being a mentor to other gays and of pressing gay issues . The gays they do hire are often held to higher standards than straight employees , they say . &quot; The gay community is sensitive to the perception we ' re going to inundate some place , that we will hire only gay people right and left and flood the company with gays , &quot; said a lesbian entrepreneur who is_active in Bay Area Career Women , a Northern California group that is the largest organization for lesbians in the country . &quot; And we ' re also sensitive to the perception we might try to use undue influence on our employees . . . . We can do nothing that can be perceived as an impropriety. &quot; At Federal Express ' Los Angeles station , manager Nora Rooney was accused of having a romantic interest in women whom she hired or promoted . And , according to a job discrimination suit she has filed_in Los Angeles Superior_Court , because she was a lesbian , &quot; any woman she hired was also suspected to be a lesbian. &quot; Maria Chmaj , a bank vice_president in Northern California , is &quot; sensitive about making remarks about how someone looks . . . and I probably would hesitate more with women than with men . Everybody these days is being careful about office conduct , &quot; to not cross the line into sexual_harassment , she said . &quot; I feel I ' m definitely pressured not to say anything . You don ' t want people to even dream about ( a compliment ) meaning something sexual. &quot; Chmaj , like many gays , would prefer that her sexual orientation not be a workplace issue at all . But even for gays who are out and feel comfortable in their jobs , as she does , there are &quot; still things you dance around every day. &quot; Unlike other groups that face discrimination -- including racial minorities and women -- gays generally can choose whether -- and to whom -- to reveal their identity as a member of a minority . The choice was taken from Julie . But , like gay_men and lesbians scattered throughout the management ranks of the country ' s biggest businesses , she too had to figure_out , with little guidance , how much gayness was &quot; too much. &quot; Many figure that any is too_much , and so they stay in the closet . A San Francisco lesbian who was closeted as she rose steadily through the ranks of her technology company to become vice_president for human resources said she &quot; thought it would be the end of my career if I came out. &quot; &quot; As a vice_president , &quot; she said , &quot; I was concerned about what risks I would be taking_for my career . But also , I was establishing policy , writing policy manuals , trying to get partners ' benefits ( for unmarried couples ) . I didn ' t want anyone to argue that I was fighting for this because I was a lesbian . I wanted them to see that these policies made_good business sense , so that when I left , they would still hold_on to those policies. &quot; The question of whether to acknowledge their sexual orientation bedevils gays of every rank and position . &quot; The vast majority of gays and lesbians are still closeted in the workplace , and that ' s especially true of managers , &quot; said Richard Jennings , executive_director of Hollywood Supports , an organization formed in 1991 to smooth the path for gays in the entertainment_industry and to offer diversity training that includes sexual orientation issues . The kind of seminar offered by Hollywood Supports is a rarity . Most diversity training_programs have yet to identify gays as a group with special needs and sensitivities . &quot; If you were to survey the human resources profession , in all probability they would not raise any overt concern regarding involvement of gays and lesbians in the workplace , &quot; said Art Hershey , vice_president of the Professionals in Human Resources Assn . Many gays report that coming_out in the workplace was far less difficult than they had imagined . Yet fear of revealing their sexual orientation is still the greatest problem shared by gays in the workplace , said Maureen S . O ' Leary , an Oakland resident who is co-chair of Global , a U.S. and Canadian association of gay and lesbian organizations . Leroy Aarons , former executive editor of the Oakland Tribune and founder and president of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Assn. , recalls that while he was a reporter at the Washington Post in the 1960s , he never came_out at_work . &quot; At that stage of my life , &quot; he said , &quot; I was convinced it would do nothing but harm my career in a very competitive environment where every factor plays a role. &quot; He was warned to be discreet , he said , by one of the paper ' s managers who had seen him go_into a gay bar . * Gays are more vulnerable to discrimination in the workplace than other minorities and women . In all but eight states -- one of them California -- and about 115 municipalities , it is still not illegal to discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation . Several states and cities , in fact , have either enacted or are considering laws that specifically deny homosexuals protection against discrimination . ( Two such measures , in Oregon and Idaho , were defeated in this month ' s elections. ) Many employers still &quot; think it ' s a God-given right to discriminate based on sexual orientation , just like it was once thought to be a God-given right to discriminate based on gender , &quot; said Daniel Stormer , a partner in the Los Angeles law_firm Hadsell &amp; Stormer who specializes in employment discrimination . Jean M . O ' Leary , a lesbian activist and Democratic Party consultant ( no relation_to Maureen O ' Leary ) , recalled the time many years ago when she wanted to get_into a real_estate field dominated in the Los Angeles area by two companies . When she applied at the first company , she said , &quot; I absolutely felt_like I needed to tell them &quot; she was a lesbian , &quot; so it would n ' t come as a surprise later when I got phone_calls at_work &quot; related to her activism . &quot; They never hired me . I ' m sure that ' s why , &quot; she said . She went_to the other main player , didn ' t raise the issue and was hired . Many gays choose secrecy and obfuscation -- even the cover of heterosexual relationships -- over derision , rejection or more subtle forms of prejudice . Gays in middle management today share the belief that in the past , the only way gays climbed the ladder of success to upper-management rungs was in disguise . Once there , few gays choose to come_out , perhaps because they have more to lose . Gay managers say if they suspect , or are certain , that some of their senior executives are gay , they step gingerly around the issue . A gay junior executive in a conservative company said he was fairly certain a senior executive was also gay , but he was careful to respect his privacy , especially because he , too , was still closeted . Wary gays take their cues from the subtle signs around them , and the dearth of visible role_models is an important factor . Homosexuals tell Global they are often uncertain of support in their company because &quot; it ' s hard to tell whether there are any people in senior management positions who are gay , &quot; Maureen O ' Leary said . There are so few prominent , openly gay executives at_large companies that the same names are mentioned over and over again , she said . Soon there will be one fewer . Elizabeth Birch , worldwide director of litigation for Apple Computer Inc. in Cupertino , will be leaving the company next month to become executive_director of the Human_Rights Campaign Fund , the country ' s largest political organization for gays . As the highest-ranking lesbian at the company , the spotlight has turned her way often . Staying closeted puts tremendous pressure on gays in middle management , supervisorial and higher-ranking positions . Julie described her work life before being outed as &quot; walking a tightrope. &quot; One woman found it too draining to remain closeted in a managerial role . &quot; The more I come_out in my life in_general , &quot; she said , &quot; the harder it is to be closeted at_work . It takes enormous energy to live your life the rest of the day , then not live it at_work , where you have to be conscious of everything you say , to not give it away. &quot; Lesbians can feel especially vulnerable to bias . &quot; Women are still in a precarious place management-wise . Being a woman , you ' ve already got one strike against you , &quot; said the lesbian active in Bay Area Career Women . &quot; If you come_out as a lesbian , it ' s a second big strike against you . It ' s real scary . Lesbians say : ' I ' m barely here because I ' m a woman , and for me to come_out is a real risk and one I ' m not willing to take . I ' ll deal with a double life. ' &quot; Edward ( Ted ) Liebst , now a partner in Media Connections Group , a San Francisco company that provides consulting to the telecommunications industry , was very nearly leading a double life during his years in investment banking . He was a vice_president , wasn ' t out and , while he didn ' t want to lie_about being gay , &quot; if someone drew a conclusion that deferred the issue or dismissed it , I chose to let them believe what they wanted to believe. &quot; For managers , the coming_out process is renewed with every new employee , or every new project that involves people outside their department . &quot; I was the most visible lesbian in America for a_few years ; the first lesbian this , the first lesbian that , &quot; Jean O ' Leary said . &quot; But I ' m still coming_out . It ' s a constant process . You don ' t just come_out to stay . You have to tell somebody ( new ) that you are gay , and it ' s a very personal thing -- like , to drop into a casual conversation that you have a lover and it ' s a woman. &quot; Gay managers also worry that their sexual orientation might cause their company to lose business , or that normally supportive bosses will flinch at having the company ' s name associated with gay events or public discussion of homosexual issues . Birch has done &quot; tons of gay work &quot; while on Apple ' s payroll , and she said her staff and superiors were supportive . Nevertheless , when the company hit busy periods , she worried that company executives would consider her activism &quot; a distraction. &quot; Job transfers -- often a prerequisite for climbing the corporate ladder -- pose a particularly sticky problem for gay managers . If the employee has a partner , that partner faces loss of his or her job and fringe_benefits , almost always without the support an organization might provide a relocating dual-career heterosexual couple . Also , gays have an added criterion -- often their primary one -- when considering relocation : Does the region have a strong gay community , or will he or she be forced to live_in a straight culture and face discrimination , gay-bashing or loneliness ? And gay managers worry about their opportunities to rise further . Liebst of Media Communications said that in conservative banking circles , &quot; if you are a vice_president with expectations and hopes of being senior_vice_president , there ' s a certain amount of socialization that occurs . You ' re expected to participate in social functions . . . . I believed at some point my career would stop , I would hit a ceiling . I couldn ' t have chosen ( the management track ) because I couldn ' t have passed that part of the test . Right or wrong , I believed I would n ' t be able to get_to that next step , &quot; he said . Steven P . Neiffer , who is a vice_president at a Pasadena-based bank , agrees . His colleagues know his sexual orientation , and it hasn ' t seemed to stand_in his way . Even so , he said , &quot; there is an easiness between people in senior management in situations where they can involve spouses that is difficult to know how to deal with in my situation . There ' s a lot of discomfort in regularly socializing with my superiors ( or ) the bank directors. &quot; * Increasingly , gays who tire of discrimination or of feeling that they must lead a double life are taking an escape route that has been dubbed &quot; entrepreneurial flight. &quot; One lesbian who &quot; bailed_out of corporate life &quot; said that &quot; there ' s a high preponderance of gay people who create their own jobs . They find a tremendous amount of freedom. &quot; Said activist Jean O ' Leary : &quot; What I have done all my life is to create my own environment where I could be comfortable. &quot; She left real_estate and now runs her own company , Print-tec Industries , a North Hollywood company that markets computer supplies . She said she isn ' t concerned whether or how her employees learn that she is a lesbian . &quot; I don ' t pay_attention to the whole_thing . I get_to do that because I ' m the boss . Instead , I worry that they are happy and satisfied in their own jobs. &quot; Another lesbian , whose last job was as vice_president for a large corporation , said she ' s ready to leave corporate life and the closet . She ' s looking_for a business to buy . &quot; I figure this way , &quot; she said , &quot; I can be out , own my own business , run my own show , have all_the control and freedom I want. &quot;</TEXT>
