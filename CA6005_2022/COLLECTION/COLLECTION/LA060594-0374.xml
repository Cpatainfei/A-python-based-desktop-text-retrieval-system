   <HEADLINE> TWO CLASSES OF FIRST PENSION INVESTORS FACE DIFFERENT ODDS ; INVESTMENTS : A Q &amp; A WITH COURT-APPOINTED RECEIVER OF FIRM THAT HANDLED CLIENT FUNDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With a staff of just three employees , attorney Andrew C . Snyder has his work cut_out for him . As court-appointed receiver for Summit Trust Services of Colorado -- the company created by the three principals of failed First Pension Corp . in Irvine to handle client money -- Snyder is trying to untangle the twisted web of thousands of retirement accounts and track_down more_than $ 24 million in missing investor funds . Summit was seized by Colorado banking authorities April 22 . As much as $ 124 million of the money invested by 8 # 000 First Pension clients may have been lost to fraud and outright theft . Numerous clients may have invested in mortgages that did not exist , investigators said . While the three First Pension principals -- William E . Cooper , Valerie Jensen and Robert Lindley -- are cooperating with federal investigators and have agreed to eventually plead guilty to some criminal charges in connection with what securities regulators have described as an elaborate pyramid scheme , the three have yet to cooperate with Snyder . In an interview with staff writer Debora Vrana , Snyder describes the distinctions between investors who used First Pension only as an administrator for their retirement_funds and those clients who invested in allegedly fraudulent mortgage pools marketed through First Diversified Financial Services Inc. , the parent of First Pension . He gives investors an idea of what to expect in upcoming months . * Q . What are you trying to achieve as trustee for Summit ? A . My obligation under Colorado law is to sell the company , or , if possible , reorganize it . To do this , I have continued to retain Kenneth Lyon , the former president of Summit , and two other former Summit employees . Our phones have been ringing off_the_hook . Since the bankruptcy , we ' ve been getting_about 20 to 30 calls each day from investors , and also some from brokers who were responsible_for bringing people in , and even some from the accountants . We are supervising the daily transactions and affairs of Summit . In addition , we are still receiving ( client ' s interest ) checks and trying to track_down the missing money . * Q . At a bankruptcy hearing last week for First Pension , you told investors that Summit has only 30 % , or about $ 9 million , of the $ 34 million in funds it is supposed to have . How does this affect investors ' chances of getting their funds back ? A . Right now , what we think is left is about 30 cents on the dollar of cash , that ' s not including the mortgage pools . These people took a risk and invested in the mortgage pools . And it not my present intention under a yet-to-be proposed distribution plan to assist people who invested in the pools in 1982 , and have been receiving earnings ever since . * Q . Why aren ' t the concerns of people who invested in the possibly phony mortgage pools being addressed under the bankruptcy filing by First Pension and the shutdown of Summit ? These investors seem to be in the worst straits . A . Well , nobody filed a bankruptcy petition for First Diversified or for the limited real_estate partnerships , so those investors still can ' t get partnership investor lists or determine what assets may still exist . ( All assets of First Diversified were frozen by the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 23 , when the assets of its principals , Cooper , Jensen and Lindley were frozen. ) It ' s not that we are avoiding any custodial obligation . * Q . Well , who is going_to do something about these real_estate pools ? They are just sitting there , and investors can ' t get any answers . A . I understand the frustration about this , and I ' m not trying to dodge your question . I don ' t know why we aren ' t getting_off our duffs and doing something about the partnerships . Investors in these partnerships need to get organized . They need to get_together , hire someone to represent them in an attempt to replace their assets . It may be they are chasing windmills . The probability is that the majority of these mortgage-pool assets were just entries on a computer_system . You had a lot of sheep here that listened to the First Pension wolf . * Q . What are the chances that anyone in the mortgage pools will get their money back ? A . You tell me what the stock_market is going_to be_on Dec . 31 and I will tell you if they will get their money back . I think the answer is available when I get a chance to question Cooper , Lindley and Jensen about what happened . My knowledge will depend_on what information the federal authorities will share with me . * Q . Is it frustrating that the three principals from First Pension are reportedly cooperating with the criminal investigation , yet not providing any information or answers yet to you , the receiver ? A . Hopefully , we will get some information soon . At this point the three have agreed to plead guilty , but the charges still have to be filed . After a formal guilty plea is entered to the charges when they are filed , then we should get some answers . It is my anticipation that we will get some answers before the end of the month . * Q . What is the most common question you get from investors ? A . They all want to know &quot; How do I get my money ? &quot; And the answer is , &quot; I have frozen the accounts , and we are trying to track it down. &quot; The other thing they all say is , &quot; Gee , I thought my money was insured. &quot; Well , the remaining cash , the 30 % , is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . to the tune of $ 100 # 000 ( per account ) against the failure of First Interstate Bank of Denver , where the remaining money is sitting in accounts . FDIC does not insure the funds against fraud or failure of the custodian , Summit Trust , or the administrator , First Pension . It only insures against fraud and failure of the bank , First Interstate , which is open and fully functioning . * Q . Where do you think the missing investment funds went ? A . Probably back to the earlier investors , as in the typical pyramid scheme . Some was sent to Singapore , and I can ' t tell you how much went offshore , or into ( other companies ) . A . It ' s hard to say whether they are OK ; we believe that investors who had their funds in trust_deeds with other companies and there is an existing mortgage or tangible assets , then to my knowledge those are still performing . So business and transactions can occur with relation_to those assets . * Q . Are you conducting transfers or other transactions on those accounts_for investors ? A . We just do not have the staff to conduct transfers ( to other investments ) for everyone . First Pension was the pension administrator , and they had a staff of about 40 people doing this . We have three . So , it has to be an emergency situation . And most people think : &quot; If I don ' t have any cash , that ' s an emergency situation , &quot; but I ' m talking_about emergencies like being_sick or injured . * Q . When could another pension administrator , such_as California Central Trust Bank in Irvine , assume control of the retirement_plans of First Pension clients and provide such services ? A . Such a move would be subject_to the approval of the bankruptcy court here , and the regulators in Colorado . It may take 30 days , or it may take 60 days . The most important issue is finding a pension administrator . We think the sooner we can get these accounts operating again is more important than the price we can get someone to pay you for these custodian assets . I am in favor of getting Cal-Trust . * Q . One investor told me $ 25 # 000 of his IRA funds were just sitting in a cash_account with First Pension . Such funds cannot be transferred or withdrawn , correct ? And what is the likelihood that they are still there ? A . Well , the answer is they could move the money when we make a determination to unfreeze the assets . If I believe the records show that you have $ 25 # 000 and you want to transfer $ 10 # 000 , I may be able to do_it . The problem is I don ' t have an administrator right now and we ' re just not equipped to deal with all_the administrative duties . * Q . What should investors who want to protect their funds managed by First Pension be doing now ? A . Honestly , there ' s nothing you can do . The money is frozen and what ' s left is FDIC insured and earning interest . The only people I really want to hear from are those who have an emergency need for distribution , not those who feel they are losing out on some investment or because they think they have some stock tip . Investors should sit_tight . We will be sending_out letters to investors this week giving them an update . Snyder said First Pension clients who want information about cash balances in their accounts held at Summit should write to : Andrew C . Snyder , receiver c / o Summit Trust Services P.O. Box 6504 Englewood , Colo . 80155-6504</TEXT>
