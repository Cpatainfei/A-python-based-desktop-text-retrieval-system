   <HEADLINE> ANTI-ABORTION ACTIVIST FOUND GUILTY IN ATTACK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An anti-abortion activist who admitted that she shot a doctor who performs abortions and considered blowing_up his clinic was convicted of attempted murder Friday . The Sedgwick County District Court jury also convicted Rachelle Shannon on one count of aggravated assault for pointing a gun at an employee of Dr. George Tiller , the physician wounded in the Aug . 19 , 1993 , attack outside his clinic . The 37-year-old Grants Pass , Ore. , woman showed no emotion as the verdict was read . Earlier Friday , Shannon had testified that she considered bombing Tiller ' s clinic after she learned he was back at_work the day after she had wounded him in both arms . &quot; I ' m concerned about innocent , helpless babies being killed by other people who won ' t stop unless somebody stops them , &quot; she said . Sentencing was set for April 29 . She faces approximately seven years in prison if given the maximum sentence for both convictions . Shannon said she never intended to kill Tiller , testifying that she had practiced with her gun and could have killed him if she had wanted . But whether she meant to kill Tiller was irrelevant , Shannon said , &quot; because it would have been right either way to try to stop what he ' s doing. &quot; &quot; If somebody kills George Tiller , I would not assume they did the wrong thing , &quot; she said . Dist . Atty . Nola Foulston argued that Shannon really was trying to kill Tiller . &quot; And I have to tell you , she ' s no Annie Oakley , &quot; Foulston said in closing arguments . &quot; This is a woman who now wants to take_advantage , perhaps , of the fact she ' s a lousy shot. &quot; Shannon fled the clinic after shooting Tiller and was arrested in Oklahoma_City the next day . She testified that she asked police about her possible bail and Wichita public transportation after her arrest because she was thinking_about &quot; doing more &quot; to stop Tiller . During cross-examination Foulston asked Shannon what she meant by &quot; more. &quot; She replied that she wanted to close Tiller ' s clinic by bombing it . &quot; And how were you going_to do that ? &quot; Foulston asked . &quot; I probably would have had to go_out there again and figure it out , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
