   <HEADLINE> COMMENTARY ; THE APPEAL OF GETTING BACK TO THE CLASSICS ; MULTICULTURALISM IS THE UNLIKELY FUEL FOR THE BURST OF CLASSICAL REPERTORY WORK IN SOME LOCAL THEATERS . TAKE CHEKHOV ' S ' WOOD DEMON ' AT TAPER FOR INSTANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Los Angeles has never been a mecca for classical theater buffs . The overweening influence of the film and television industries , with their emphasis on pop culture , has affected even what gets produced on local stages . Yet in the past few years , there ' s been a surge of interest in the classics -- the Western canon generally thought to include everything from Greek tragedy to such vintage Americana as Thornton Wilder ' s &quot; Our Town , &quot; with an emphasis on such giants as Shakespeare , Ibsen , Shaw and Chekhov . The opening this week of Anton Chekhov ' s &quot; The Wood Demon &quot; by the Antaeus Company at the Mark Taper Forum marks the high point so far in this trend . For the past two years , the Taper has provided rehearsal space and workshops for the Antaeus Company , a group of established actors committed to creating permanent classical repertory in L.A. &quot; The Wood Demon &quot; is the inaugural production for the group , and although the Taper is not committed to producing the group beyond this staging , its backing of this show by a local company signals a potentially significant turn of events for classical theater here . This is not the first time the Taper has presented a classical repertory_company , but it is their first presentation of an L.A.-based classical company , despite doing a series of works in repertory in the early ' 80s with many local artists . The Taper ' s imprimatur is particularly significant given the venue ' s dominant position in the community . Antaeus has not , however , been the only local company trying to advance L.A. ' s cultural image . Glendale ' s A Noise Within , founded in 1991 , operates a 99-seat theater and has done_well with both audiences and critics . There have also been sundry other groups at_work , from new companies like L.A. Women ' s Shakespeare Company , to workshop-oriented groups like the Classical Theatre Lab to the more seasoned troupes like Shakespeare Festival / L.A. , among many others . But it ' s one ( admittedly impressive ) thing for a 99-seat theater like A Noise Within to make a go of it , and another for the city ' s flagship theater to throw its weight behind such a project . And not for nothing is it happening now . Yes , L.A. finally seems to have an audience for the Bard and others -- witness the crowds for Le Theatre du Soleil and the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1984 at the Olympic Arts Festival , Kenneth Branagh ' s Renaissance Theatre Company at the Taper in 1990 , and Ian McKellen ' s &quot; Richard III &quot; at UCLA in 1992 . Also , New York ' s depressed economy has driven more conservatory-trained actors and directors here to work in film and TV than ever before , and many of them still want to work in their favored medium . But there ' s more to this sudden push than supply and demand . The trend that helped move classics to the fore , ironically enough , has been multiculturalism . * L.A. ' s relationship to classical theater has always been different from that of other major cities . In addition to L.A. ' s populist image , there ' s the fact that L.A. ' s major cultural institutions came_into being much later than those of New York , Boston , Washington or any number of other places , and the European-based traditions have never been as rooted here as they have elsewhere . Los Angeles theater is a child of the ' 60s . that ' s when the Music Center and the city ' s other major institutions -- those places traditionally charged with propagating the canon -- were built . It was also a time of counterculture , not classical repertory . The Taper , founded in 1967 , put itself on the map with political docudramas like &quot; In the_Matter of J . Robert Oppenheimer &quot; ( 1968 ) , about the physicist who pioneered the development of the first atomic_bomb , &quot; The Trial of the Catonsville Nine &quot; ( 1971 ) , a courtroom docudrama about a Vietnam_war protest , and &quot; Zoot Suit &quot; ( 1978 ) , Luis Valdez ' s Pachuco-era drama inspired by a historical incident . And while the Taper has always presented about one classical work per season , it has also stayed the topical , politically charged course , up_to and including Anna Deavere Smith ' s &quot; Twilight : Los Angeles , 1992. &quot; Recently , and particularly in the wake of the demise of the Los Angeles Theatre Center , the Taper has jumped_on the multiculturalism bandwagon -- making nods to racial ( if not gender ) representation in the artists whose works they choose to develop as well as what they put_on their mainstage . In this way the Taper is emblematic of L.A. theater in_general , for even as multiculturalism has flourished on local stages in recent years , there has been an increased focus_on the classics . Call it a backlash , a desire on the one hand for traditional actors -- white and non-white -- to work_on time-tested texts and on the other hand to carve out a niche for themselves in the way multicultural advocates have . 1991 appears to have been the turning point . That year , the Taper , Too , which had long served as the Taper ' s primary venue for new works , broke_with practice , presenting three conceptual productions of older European texts . A Music Center document at the time listed &quot; a repertory_company &quot; as one of the &quot; top priorities of the Mark Taper Forum , &quot; noting the success of Branagh and company and that &quot; there is no regularly scheduled classical theater. &quot; Also in 1991 -- the same year that A Noise Within was launched -- LATC added a Classical Theatre Lab to its list of ethnic and gender-based groups . ( The Lab continued after LATC , under the direction of Robert Machray. ) And so we have a paradox . For while early multiculturalism disdained the classics as the theatrical equivalent of the Great Books , the movement has helped to bring the canon to a city historically unenthused by it . Significantly , though , it ' s not simply a reactionary backlash of Anglo traditionalists ; this may be the next step for multiculturalism . Plenty of non-white theater artists are interested in subjects other_than ethnic identity , as is evident from the diversity in the ranks of both Antaeus and A Noise Within . In fact , the current interest in racially integrated casting of classical fare -- a &quot; non-traditional &quot; approach made popular by Joseph Papp ' s New York Shakespeare Festival and used in the Taper ' s 1991 &quot; Julius Caesar &quot; and 1992 &quot; Richard II &quot; -- is proof that the L.A. stage community wants to move beyond the parochialisms of both the traditional institutional theater and early multiculturalism , both of which have practiced de_facto , if not ideological , separatism . Multiculturalists have long been pitted against the classicists , when their objectives don ' t have to be mutually_exclusive . Classic texts speak_to us about age-old problems that cut_across divisions of race , gender and class , and hopefully L.A. is at last be ready to listen . In &quot; The Wood Demon , &quot; for example , the titular protagonist finds new resolve even as the forest of Telibeyevsk burns . His contradictory emotions are likely to ring strangely true for people who live_in L.A. But then , what better playwright to illuminate the sense of futility and forbearance that Angelenos feel than Chekhov ? * &quot; The Wood Demon , &quot; Mark Taper Forum , 135 N .
