   <HEADLINE> INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE : AND NOW , A REMAKE OF YOUR LIFE , BROUGHT TO YOU BY KODAK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> P icture this : flawless photos , every time , no matter who takes them . Perfection on a print . Smiling tots wide-eyed with happiness ; family and friends gathered around holiday tables ; gorgeous sun-dappled ocean views from intimate vacations . Memories are made of this , right ? Well , they should be . But too often our photographs are made of blinks and blurs , smirks and shadows : images that betray our best moments rather than truly reflect them . Even worse , they ' re filled with people we don ' t want there and missing ones who really should be in the picture . They cheat the reality we explicitly asked the camera to remember . So instead of trying so hard to capture and preserve those golden moments , why not make the effort to perfect them ? Now it ' s not at all unusual for women ' s magazines today to use computer image processing techniques to perform digital rhinoplasties and tummy tucks on their models ; it ' s just outrageously expensive . Technology has been transforming photographs from finished products into imagery ingredients for years . What a Richard Avedon or Bruce Weber can ' t achieve , a halfway competent art_director with digital scanners , optical printers and Adobe Photoshop software can . But just like everything else processed by computers , all these big-ticket technologies are getting faster , cheaper and more accessible . Editing color photographs is becoming as easy and inexpensive as editing boring memos . Digital image processing is turning_into a mass medium . So who needs to be an Avedon if the real creativity can take_place after the picture is taken ? Why worry about f-stops and lighting if we have technology that forgives us our technical transgressions and gives us the option to polish our memories ? &quot; We have the opportunity to give people a second chance to make their pictures more perfect , &quot; asserts Paul Walrath , Kodak ' s marketing manager for photo impressions . For all_the media hype surrounding the Internet and multimedia , the next multibillion-dollar consumer market in digital technology is going_to be making memories just a little more pleasant . Consider Western Pro Imaging Labs in Vancouver as a model for tomorrow ' s photography . In July , the Canadian photo processor launched DivorceX -- a service that lets divorced people digitally excise their ex-spouses from treasured family photos at $ 75 a slice . &quot; This started_out as a joke in my speeches , &quot; says company President Ken Guelpha . &quot; Now it ' s becoming a nice little business for us. &quot; In fact , reports Guelpha , there ' s now just as much call_for digital insertions as deletions . &quot; The wedding_party photographer blew it and grandmother was missed , &quot; he recalls , &quot; so we spliced her in a_few of the pictures . . . . At another wedding , there was a great boat shot of the entire family but one of the family had turned the wrong way -- so we inserted another shot of her head . . . . At a university graduation photo , the girl blinked : For $ 75 , we simply put_in her eyes . Memories are very powerful ; pictures are very powerful , &quot; says Guelpha . &quot; We ' re helping people erase those negative aspects. &quot; Please , no discussion of ethical qualms here : Is it any more unethical to give someone her eyes back than to pose people around the table and then ask them to say &quot; Cheese ! &quot; ? This isn ' t about photojournalism verite ; it ' s about using technology to enable people to better design the life images they want to preserve . There were more_than 2.3 million weddings in America last year . How much extra would most newlyweds pay to assure their cherished images of the event were without blemish and that every member of the family looked good ? Over the same time , there were more_than 1.2 million divorces : what percentage of embittered ex-spouses would pay a premium to have their now-insignificant others erased from a_few of the photos ? There are more_than 17 million high-school students in America : how many gawky adolescents and their nervous parents would pay an extra $ 25 or so to digitally smooth down unruly hair , computationally remove zits and cut_down the horrible glare from the braces in_order to prevent the child from being photographically enshrined as the geek a tutti geek in the high_school yearbook ? Indeed , according to the authoritative Wolfman Report , Americans took more_than 18 billion photos last year -- roughly half of the world ' s picture-taking . If Americans would pay to enhance but 5 % of those pictures , we ' re immediately talking_about an enormous multibillion-dollar marketplace , comparable in size to the video_game software and consumer CD-ROM markets . Don ' t forget those billions of photos now shuffled in shoe boxes and desk drawers that were almost perfect . What happens to the family photo album as image enhancement and alteration gets better and cheaper ? A &quot; Kodak moment &quot; may indeed become the photo one makes as well as the photo one takes . The challenge isn ' t in the technology ; it ' s in packaging the technology in a form that makes people want to bring_in their photos for enhancement . Ironically -- but appropriately -- the most appealing aspect of these digital technologies may be less in how they let us create the future than how they enable us to recreate our pasts . Everybody has an &quot; If only . . . . &quot; photograph ; everyone wants photos that capture the spirit of the moment as well as its image . Increasingly , that ' s what image processing technology empowers us to do . Isn ' t that something to smile about ?</TEXT>
