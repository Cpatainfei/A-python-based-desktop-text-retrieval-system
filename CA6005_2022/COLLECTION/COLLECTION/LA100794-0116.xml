   <HEADLINE> FROM 135 MILES IN SPACE , SHUTTLE RADAR FINDS INTENTIONAL OIL SPILL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Space shuttle Endeavour ' s powerful radar detected an intentional spill of oil and algae from 135 miles up Thursday , discerning black streaks that looked_like an armada off the coast of Denmark . German scientists dumped more_than 100 gallons of diesel_oil and algae products into the sea just before Endeavour soared overhead to see if the radar could distinguish between the two substances . The early results indicated that it could . Researchers applauded when they saw the radar images . They thought they could discern the two oil_slicks from the five patches of algae but wanted to analyze the images further to make_sure , said Franz-Peter Spaunhorst , a spokesman for the German space agency , which helped coordinate the experiment . Endeavour ' s six tiny steering jets had shut_down Wednesday because of a failed temperature sensor , preventing the radar instruments from being aimed properly and forcing some targets to be scrapped . NASA put_together a computer_program to bypass the sensor and restore use of the jets , but not in time for the spill . To save the experiment , astronaut Daniel Bursch took manual control of the jets and accurately pointed the radar at the 106 gallons of diesel_oil and 26 gallons of algae byproducts . As promised , two oil-recovery ships quickly cleaned_up the mess . Environmentalists on shore watched on TV monitors to make_sure no wildlife was harmed . If the radar can distinguish between oil spills and the sheen naturally produced by fish and plankton , the next step would be to put it aboard a satellite . Scientists say such a satellite could allow oil spills to be detected and cleaned_up more quickly . NASA added an 11th day to the mission to allow_for more radar observations . Endeavour is now due back Tuesday .</TEXT>
