   <HEADLINE> MEXICAN DENIES LOAN SCAM AT SEIZED BANK ; FINANCE : CARLOS CABAL PENICHE SAYS HE ' LL FIGHT TO KEEP HIS TWO FIRMS AND CLEAR HIS NAME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A fugitive Mexican businessman accused of running an insider loan network at the Cremi-Union financial group denied the charges Thursday and vowed to remain at the helm of the bank and Florida-based Del Monte Fresh Produce Co . &quot; I don ' t intend to relinquish control of either of these companies , as has been maliciously reported , &quot; Carlos Cabal Peniche said in an open_letter to the Mexican media , his first public response to the charges against him . He vigorously denied running a $ 700-million insider loan network at Cremi-Union and said he will fight to clear his name , from an unknown location outside Mexico . In September , Mexican authorities took_over management of the bank in the first such intervention in two decades . They also sought the arrest of Cabal Peniche on charges that he falsified bank_accounts to set_up an illicit loan network that funneled the funds back to him . In his letter , Cabal Peniche said he had been unjustly targeted by Mexican Finance_Minister Pedro Aspe for reasons he did not explain . He said he was also the victim of powerful interest_groups that have taken_advantage of the scandal to falsely link him to drug trafficking and money_laundering . Cabal Peniche said he had also stirred_up resentment among U.S. competitors to Del Monte Fresh , which he bought_in 1992 for $ 500 million . &quot; I ' ve been informed that these same powerful interests , with nit-picking ( tactics ) and illegal measures , are trying to take this company away from me , &quot; he said . &quot; I will do everything possible with the support of the law that this doesn ' t happen with impunity. &quot; A bid Cabal Peniche more recently made_for San Francisco-based Del Monte Foods for $ 277 million lapsed Sept . 21 when he missed a merger deadline .</TEXT>
