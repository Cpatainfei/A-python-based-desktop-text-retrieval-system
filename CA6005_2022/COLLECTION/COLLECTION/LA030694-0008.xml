   <TEXT> Two years ago , a newspaper report from a scientific meeting read , &quot; Ability to Learn Grammar Laid to Gene by Researcher. &quot; To psychologists and linguists , the notion that grammatical_rules might be the inflexible products of strings of DNA molecules , rather than having been shaped by the nuances of a cultural milieu , was stunning , not to say heretical . To the syndicated columnist Erma Bombeck , however , it all made perfect sense . Bombeck ' s husband once taught English in high_school . &quot; He had 37 grammar-gene deficients in his class at one time , &quot; she informed her readers . To them , she explained , &quot; a comma could have been a petroglyph . A subjective complement was something you said to a friend when her hair came_out right . A dangling_participle was not their problem. &quot; And yet , Bombeck speculated , each and every one of these kids finished_up as major sports figures , rock_stars and television personalities , &quot; who make millions spewing out words such_as bummer , radical and awesome and thinking they are complete sentences. &quot; Bombeck ' s observations aside , one of the great mysteries of human life is the fact that children learn language ( not just words , but complicated grammatical structure ) with amazing facility -- yeah , like , I mean , really ! In his &quot; Patterns in the Mind , &quot; Ray Jackendoff refers to this as the Paradox of Language Acquisition . If linguists are so smart , how come they ' re so dumb that they can ' t do what kids of two can do while chucking food around the room and sticking their fingers into electrical outlets ? That is , figure_out the principles behind the grammatical patterns of various languages . The nature of language has long fascinated scholars . Obsessed would be a more accurate description . And perhaps it ' s not surprising that scholars whose stock in trade is words should be able to employ them with such stinging effect against their academic adversaries : They do so at every opportunity . There is a huge intellectual divide across which their carefully hewn invectives are hurled with such enthusiasm . On one side , there are those who believe that language acquisition is an innate process , which is fine tuned by the environment in early infancy . On the other side , children are viewed_as acquiring language solely through learning , through attentive imitation of Motherese and other voices they hear in the babble about them . The most prominent proponent of language as an innate phenomenon is Noam Chomsky , a linguist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) . When , in 1957 , Chomsky published his landmark book &quot; Syntactic Structures , &quot; he challenged the prevailing wisdom of psychology -- namely , behaviorism . According to the behaviorists , nothing existed in the brain that hadn ' t been put there through experience . In other words , we come_into the world with a mental blank slate . One of Chomsky ' s strongest arguments was the Paradox of Language Acquisition . Normal learning patterns surely could not explain the phenomenon . Children must therefore be innately equipped with an understanding of grammar . Chomsky called this a Universal Grammar . Chomsky ' s view became dominant , forcing linguists to focus_on syntax as the central feature of language acquisition -- for a while . Amid mini-rebellions among Chomsky ' s acolytes , those who favor language as a learned behavior have recently made a comeback , although not in the strict behaviorist mold . Steven Pinker ' s &quot; The Language Instinct &quot; and Jackendoff ' s &quot; Patterns of the Mind &quot; represent blasts from the innatists ' side of the divide . Both authors present evidence in favor of a strong genetic basis for the learning of language . And both view language as just one of many behaviors that are generated by genetically determined modules within the brain . Both books are therefore provocative , not only in their uncompromising promotion of the innatists ' program in linguistics , but also in extending this paradigm to other realms of human behavior . Jackendoff and Pinker proffer similar evidence and weave similar arguments in making the case for the Genetic Hypothesis of language . But their approach as authors is different . &quot; My goal is to offer the reader a_few evenings of engagement with the ideas of linguistics , without a great investment in technical detail , &quot; Jackendoff says . &quot; For better or worse , &quot; Pinker concedes , &quot; I can write in only one way , with a passion for powerful , explanatory ideas and a torrent of relevant detail. &quot; Both authors are true_to their word , and each book is splendid in its own way . It is therefore up_to potential buyers to select the amount of detail for which they have appetites . Much of the evidence presented in favor of the Genetic Hypothesis will be familiar to those with a passing interest in the science . For instance , if , as the supporters of the cultural model argue , language is absorbed in a cultural context , with the mind acting_as a general purpose learning machine , brain defects that affect overall intelligence would be expected to impair language in like manner . This is not what happens . Language-impaired individuals are often of average intelligence . Moreover , the existence of linguistic idiot savants , that is people with highly developed language but below normal intelligence , deals a severe blow to the learning model of language acquisition . &quot; If language is an instinct , &quot; says Pinker , &quot; it should have an identifiable seat in the brain. &quot; This , effectively , is what is seen with deficits that occur as a result of trauma to different areas of the brain : sometimes syntax is affected , sometimes the recognition of nouns , other times the ability to use certain verbs . There does appear to be an identifiable seat of language , or , rather , several seats , interconnected in complex ways , as new research with different forms of brain scanners is beginning to show . Pinker ' s own research is with infants . Specifically , he ' s interested in the errors that children make : &quot; My teacher holded the baby rabbits &quot; ; I finded Renee &quot; ; &quot; I love cut-upped egg. &quot; Infant utterings of this kind , which we all think are so cute , are rich_in information . &quot; The errors children do make are rarely random garbage , &quot; notes Pinker . &quot; Often the errors follow the logic of grammar so beautifully that the puzzle is not why the children make the errors , but why they sound like errors to adult ears. &quot; The infants are not repeating what they hear in daily discourse , but are logically extrapolating standard rules to irregular cases . A new_line of evidence that supports innatism , mentioned by Jackendoff and savored by Pinker , is the discovery by a Canadian linguist of a grammatical defect in otherwise normal members of a British family . Geneticists have shown that the deficit is inherited as &quot; a single dominant gene , just like pink flowers on Gregor Mendel ' s pea_plants , &quot; says Pinker . This was the research that inspired Erma Bombeck ' s philosophical musings on grammar genes . There is , however , no such thing as a grammar gene . &quot; A single gene is thought to disrupt grammar , &quot; explains Pinker , &quot; but that does not mean a single gene controls grammar. &quot; Many genes are likely to be involved . Clearly , Pinker and Jackendoff are champions of the Chomskian position , but they depart in at least one important direction . Although Chomsky views language ability as the product of a language organ , he argues that it is not the product of conventional Darwinian evolution . Instead , he suggests , it emerged when the brain passed a critical size threshold in human prehistory . By contrast , both Pinker and Jackendoff see language as the product of evolution based on selection of primitive communication skills in our early ancestors . Pinker , particularly , is an ardent champion of natural_selection , and argues that spoken language began to emerge very early in human prehistory . Chomsky &quot; has it backwards , &quot; he asserts : Humans didn ' t develop language because they evolved big brains ; brains got bigger as a result of the gradual elaboration of structures that underlie language . There are anthropologists who would contest the suggestion that language has ancient roots . But there is neurological evidence that indicates that the major changes that occurred in the human brain as it expanded involved principally those regions associated with language . And so the arguments go_on . . . and on . . . and on . There is surely no resolution in_sight , but interested observers are_well served by Pinker ' s and Jackendoff ' s different expositions . And Pinker includes a wonderful chapter demolishing the stuffiness of language pedants . &quot; It is ironic that the jeremiads wailing about how sloppy language leads to sloppy thought are themselves hairballs of loosely associated factoids and tangled non sequiturs , &quot; he scoffs . &quot; As for slang , I ' m all for it ! . . . When given a glimpse into one of these lexicons ( of slang ) , no true language-lover can fail to be dazzled by the brilliant wordplay and wit. &quot; Not_bad for a supposedly stuffy scholar from MIT .</TEXT>
