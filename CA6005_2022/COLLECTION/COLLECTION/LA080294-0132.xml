   <HEADLINE> MARKETING / BRUCE HOROVITZ : ROLLING RIGHT ALONG ; NEWEST TWIST IN SNACKS IS OLD FAVORITE , THE PRETZEL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The fact that Paul Newman ' s face is now smiling from the front of a pretzel bag is a sign of just how far the pretzel has come . These days , there ' s dough to be made in pretzels . Besides Newman , whose Newman ' s Own company recently began marketing &quot; organic &quot; pretzels , a slew of marketers -- from tiny start-ups to the snack_food giants -- have caught pretzelmania . And soft-pretzel franchises , which sell fresh-baked pretzels for about $ 1.50 a pop , are giving Mrs . Fields a run_for consumer snack dollars at the local malls . Even conventional hard pretzels are_on a rollicking roll . Frito-Lay has seen recent sales of its Rold Gold brand leave corn_chips in the snack_food dust . Eagle Snacks is preparing to get_into the swim -- with a new_line of pretzel bits shaped like seashells and sailboats . And for something special in the air , American Airlines recently dumped those tiny bags of nuts in favor of -- you guessed it -- tiny bags of pretzels . Some snack mavens are even dubbing pretzels the unofficial snack_food of the ' 90s . that ' s because pretzels are generally low in fat ( about 1 gram in 10 pretzels ) and potentially high in fun . ( Are you ready for the soon-to-be-sold hot caramel almond pretzels ? ) &quot; A pretzel is the only snack_food that doesn ' t make you feel guilty after you ' ve eaten one , &quot; said Paul Rogers , managing editor of the Chicago-based trade magazine Snack_Food . Unless , of course , you start piling on the gloppy stuff . And that ' s what growing numbers of pretzel makers are doing . Hot pretzels now come_with dips ranging from melted Cheddar_cheese to spicy pizza sauce . And hard pretzels are being baked with ingredients ranging from honey mustard to garlic and herb bits . &quot; Once you start embellishing the pretzel to appeal_to the American palate , you quickly move_out of the healthy snack category , &quot; said Judith Ashley , a nutrition professor at UCLA . But while many of the newer pretzel treats aren ' t especially healthy , there is one thing that -- for a change -- they are not : boring . &quot; The blandness factor has finally been overcome , &quot; said Dennis Mitchell , a snack_food consultant in Duluth , Minn . &quot; It ' s as if someone pushed all_the pretzel bakers to open their eyes at the same time. &quot; Of course , what is actually pushing the pretzel makers is sales . Pretzel sales in the United States topped $ 1 billion for the first time last year , according to the Alexandria , Va.-based Snack_Food Assn . And while pretzels accounted_for only about 2 % of all snack_foods sold in 1993 , the pretzel market is growing at a 25 % clip . &quot; Any snack_food company that ' s not now in the pretzel business is certainly thinking_about getting_into it , &quot; said James W . Shufelt , president of the Snack_Food Assn . Paul Newman might be slightly ahead of the pretzel curve . Last year , Newman ' s Own Organics was founded in Aptos , Calif. , by the actor ' s daughter , Nell . It is a division of the 12-year-old Newman ' s Own , which has donated more_than $ 56 million to charitable causes . The company began to test organic pretzels , which are made without preservatives and from grain free_of pesticide residues . The pretzels are top sellers in West Coast health_food stores , and now they ' re being rolled_out nationally . &quot; Pretzels are my dad ' s favorite snack -- next to popcorn , &quot; said Nell Newman , 35 , whose picture appears on the pretzel bag along with that of her 70-year-old father . &quot; When I was a kid , pretzels were the one thing we were allowed to eat before dinner , because Dad ate them too. &quot; But no one sells more pretzels than Frito-Lay , whose Rold Gold brand recently bested Snyder ' s of Hanover to become the nation ' s top seller . In February , Rold Gold introduced a fat-free pretzel whose sales are growing at twice the pace of its other types of pretzels . &quot; Our biggest problem is figuring_out how to make enough pretzels , &quot; said Hal Oates , Rold Gold product manager . The company recently opened a second plant to meet consumer demand . Relative newcomer Eagle Snacks , which has the backing of parent Anheuser-Busch , now ranks among the nation ' s top five pretzel makers . Executives project that sales could double this year , in part because of newly introduced multigrain pretzel bits that have no fat . The fastest-growing segment of the pretzel world is the soft side . Several soft-pretzel chains say their sales have doubled for each of the past two years ; more_than two_dozen such chains have sprung_up in less than five years . SuperPretzel , the king of frozen soft_pretzels , sells about 2 million soft_pretzels every day , said Michael Karaban , vice_president of marketing of J &amp; J Snack_Foods Corp. , the New Jersey company that makes the brand . SuperPretzels are sold in the frozen_food sections of more_than 90 % of the nation ' s supermarkets . The company also operates stands at airports and stadiums . And some McDonald ' s franchises on the East Coast recently began to sell the brand . Then there ' s Auntie Anne ' s . Although it might sound like a mom-and-pop operation , the Gap , Pa.-based chain has 240 shops in 30 states -- mostly inside malls -- to lure impulsive shoppers . Its Southern California locations include Santa Monica Place and Brea Mall . The chain expects to open as_many as 100 new shops in the next year , said Carl Smucker , chief operating officer . Among them : a spot inside the international terminal at Los Angeles International Airport . Of course , some passengers in the terminal may already be snacking on any of the 190 # 000 bags of pretzels that American Airlines now serves daily on flights , estimates Joe Crawley , an airline spokesman . Why did American change to pretzels ? Well , for one thing , pretzels are cheaper . But more important , said Crawley , customer surveys revealed that many health-conscious people prefer pretzels . &quot; We haven ' t received a single complaint , &quot; he said . &quot; Although we do expect to hear from some peanut farmers. &quot; * The Santa Monica agency Rubin Postaer &amp; Partners has picked_up the $ 1-million ad account_for California Pizza Kitchen . . . . The Santa Monica agency Kresser / Craig -- which has recently had merger discussions with Stein , Robaire , Helm -- has picked_up the $ 3-million ad account_for Burbank-based Disney Interactive . . . . The Venice office of Chiat / Day has picked_up the $ 5-million ad business for Memorex . . . . The Venice agency Ground Zero has picked_up the ad account_for Futurekids , a Los Angeles firm that offers computer classes for children . Snack Attack Although pretzels accounted_for just 2.1 % of all snack_foods sold last year , their overall sales grew nearly 25 % in 1993 -- the fastest growth for any major snack_food category .
