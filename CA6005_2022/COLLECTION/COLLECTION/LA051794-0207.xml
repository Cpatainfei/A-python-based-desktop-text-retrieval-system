   <HEADLINE> TOBACCO FIRM LAWYERS TRY TO SMOKE_OUT POSSIBLE MOLE ; CIGARETTES : OBSCURE PARALEGAL IS SUSPECTED OF LEAKING TO THE MEDIA DOCUMENTS EMBARRASSING TO THE INDUSTRY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s unlikely that Merrell Williams is enjoying his 15 minutes of fame . Tobacco giant Brown &amp; Williamson , the maker of Kool and Viceroy cigarettes , among others , effectively put_out an all-points bulletin for Williams , a hitherto unknown paralegal , after he failed over the weekend to appear in Louisville , Ky. , for a court-ordered deposition . The subject : His connection , if any , to explosive company documents leaked over the last few weeks to news media and anti-smoking leaders in Congress -- documents that will be the subject of congressional hearings set for today and Friday in Washington . The tobacco company and the law_firm for which Williams used to work have sued him , alleging theft and fraud in connection with the secret papers . Among them is a 30-year-old memo in which a top Brown &amp; Williamson executive stated that nicotine is addictive , a conclusion industry officials publicly deny to this day . Other documents they accuse Williams of stealing concern plans to defeat smokers ' lawsuits by hiding industry health research from plaintiff ' s lawyers . Still others show Brown &amp; Williamson hard at_work on a safer cigarette it never marketed -- apparently to avoid liability in the sale of conventional smokes . While health and anti-smoking groups have a field_day with these disclosures -- and members of Congress use them to push limits on public smoking -- Williams is hiding_out , reportedly in Mississippi . Thomas E . Royals , a criminal defense_attorney in Jackson , Miss. , confirmed Monday that Williams has retained him , fearing he may face criminal charges over release of the documents . Williams , who could not be reached for comment , apparently has never given an interview -- his obscurity freeing observers to speculate whether he is an intrepid whistle-blower , as his lawyers claim , or merely a thief , as Brown &amp; Williamson alleges . Support for both views is found in filings in Jefferson County , Ky. , Circuit Court that tell Williams ' peculiar story . A 53-year old Ph.D. in literature , Williams early in 1988 took a job as a document analyst for Wyatt , Tarrant &amp; Combs , Kentucky ' s largest law_firm -- and counsel to Louisville-based Brown &amp; Williamson . B &amp; W , a subsidiary of British tobacco giant BAT Industries and the third-largest U.S. cigarette maker , had retained the Wyatt firm to sort and analyze thousands of memos , cables , reports and other documents that might figure in cases involving the deaths of smokers . By his account , outlined in court pleadings , Williams soon was deeply troubled by the contents of the documents , which he believed contradicted many of the industry ' s public pronouncements on smoking and health . A longtime smoker who had favored Brown &amp; Williamson ' s Kool and Richland brands , Williams said he quit smoking in disgust . After being laid_off by the Wyatt firm in 1992 , Williams says he underwent quintuple bypass heart_surgery . He blamed the heart_condition on his smoking habit and stress that he said was the result of unwittingly joining a conspiracy of lies . Last year , Williams retained Louisville attorney J . Fox DeMoisey to sue Wyatt and B &amp; W over damage to his health . He told DeMoisey he was already in possession of internal documents that would support his damage claim . DeMoisey dropped the bombshell in a letter last July to the Wyatt firm . Without naming Williams , DeMoisey said he represented a client with a smoking-related health claim who also happened to have worked for Wyatt on the documents project . The client had copied and removed documents , DeMoisey wrote , because he was &quot; shocked at the fraud and hoax being perpetrated upon the government and the American people. &quot; Recognizing that the documents could be covered by attorney-client_privilege , DeMoisy said he had advised his client to return them , but wanted Wyatt to keep them handy . If the health claim could not be settled , DeMoisey said , &quot; it is my intention to file suit and immediately demand production &quot; of the documents . Outraged that a member of their defense_team would take their documents for a health claim of_his_own , Wyatt and B &amp; W struck first . They filed a lawsuit and obtained a court_order requiring the &quot; Unknown Defendant &quot; -- they later substituted Williams ' name -- to return all documents , and barring him from discussing them . Ultimately , Williams returned two boxes of documents , also handing_over his personal_computer and an inch-thick narrative describing the documents . B &amp; W believed , or at least hoped , that its materials were safe until 10 days ago , when the first report on the documents appeared in the New York Times . Since then , B &amp; W has been trying to depose Williams , hoping to prove he illegally retained and distributed copies of the documents in violation of the court_order . They have portrayed Williams in court papers as anything but principled -- claiming that he had signed two agreements vowing never to disclose client documents . They also filed affidavits in which former Wyatt co-workers described Williams as &quot; devious and dishonest &quot; and as &quot; a conniving opportunist with an ulterior motive for everything he does. &quot; DeMoisey dismisses that character sketch , calling Williams &quot; very bright , &quot; with an &quot; encyclopedic kind of mind. &quot; Williams &quot; is very concerned about his kids , &quot; DeMoisey said . He &quot; has always been concerned he was going_to get whacked by the fringe elements of the tobacco_industry . . . so he ' s been really torn_up by the whole thing. &quot; DeMoisey said it is unclear if the documents Williams took are the same as those recently disclosed . Tobacco officials &quot; are trying to make_it sound like these things were kept_in a vault , &quot; the lawyer said . In fact , he said , they were stored in a large warehouse and &quot; obviously the security wasn ' t much. &quot; Some of the documents have been obtained by the Los Angeles Times . One , authored by a B &amp; W scientist in 1965 , reported that animal tests had shown tobacco smoke to be &quot; weakly carcinogenic. &quot; The scientist wrote that finding could be considered significant , because the industry -- which publicly denied a link between smoking and cancer -- had done the research itself . Another memo took_stock of the industry ' s position on the eve of the landmark Surgeon_General ' s report of 1964 that tied smoking to lung_cancer . Dated July 17 , 1963 , the long memo by B &amp; W general counsel Addison Yeaman stated that nicotine , while beneficial , was addictive -- something industry executives denied as recently as last month , when they appeared before the House health and environment subcommittee chaired by U.S. Rep . Henry A . Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) . &quot; We are , then , in the business of selling nicotine , an addictive drug effective in the release of stress mechanisms , &quot; the memo said Yeaman also advised -- unsuccessfully , it turned_out -- that the industry relax its defensive posture about the safety of smoking . By acknowledging a possible cancer link , Yeaman wrote , the industry &quot; might worsen our situation in litigation , &quot; but would be freer to work with health groups in discovering and removing the cancer-causing elements of cigarette smoke . B &amp; W on Monday released studies commissioned by its sister firm , British-American Tobacco Co. , that it said showed nicotine is not addictive and corrected &quot; erroneous reports about nicotine research attributed to the company. &quot; The firm also said it had obtained a court_order Monday in Louisville requiring Waxman and various news organizations to allow B &amp; W to review documents in their possession . Officials with the subcommittee -- and with the New York Times and Washington Post , two of the news organizations named in the order -- could not immediately be reached for comment .</TEXT>
