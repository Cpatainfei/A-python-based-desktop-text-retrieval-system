   <HEADLINE> WHERE IS THIS NATIVE SON ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Imagine my dismay when I picked_up the Los Angeles Times Book_Review on Sunday , Dec . 5 , 1993 , and turned_to Page 4 where I read &quot; Buildings With Beautiful Bodies , Books With Lovely Limbs &quot; by William Gass . At last , I thought , there will be recognition of Los Angeles ' own native son who contributed a great_deal to the architectural landscape of this area , Paul Revere Williams . NOT ! There wasn ' t even a mention of &quot; Paul R . Williams , Architect ; Legacy of Style &quot; by Karen E . Hudson , his granddaughter . It was only in an ad by Southern California ' s Booksellers that the book was mentioned at all on Page 39 . To quote the ad , &quot; From the 1920s through the 1970s , Paul R . Williams designed over 3 # 000 projects , including the Beverly Hills and the Ambassador hotels and mansions for the stars . Here is the first documentation of one of Los Angeles ' most important architects . Rizzoli ( 0-8478-1763-6 ) , $ 50. &quot; The emphasis is my own . I just want you to know that I know how you continue to degrade our images . Even the good , bright and brilliant are not to be recognized . A disappointed Los Angeles Times subscriber . JOYCE SUMBI , LOS ANGELES A SHORT-LIVED ENTERPRISE ? I was surprised and pleased to see the publication of African-American bestsellers ( Nov . 28 ) . However , given the vitriolic response it generated ( Letters , Dec . 19 ) , I fear it will be a short-lived enterprise . Ironically , the very intensity of the reactions the list provoked is indicative_of the unique position African-American culture occupies in this country . I doubt very seriously that you would have gotten such passionate letters had you printed any other classification of bestsellers . However , dear editor , I did want to let you know that your efforts were very much appreciated and that they were not lost on all_of your readers -- especially this one . ELEANOR BROWN , LOS ANGELES SARTRE ' S SAINTLY SINNER In a very peculiar review of Edmund White ' s &quot; Genet &quot; ( Nov . 21 , 1993 ) , Daniel Harris seems to conclude from a catalogue of the various ways in which Genet was a very , very bad boy , indeed , an &quot; out and out scoundrel , &quot; that Genet was not a very good writer . The fact that he was an extraordinary and quite original stylist shows instead that there is something very wrong with the comfortable- sour-liberal-homophobic-Harper ' s magazine-moral order that the reviewer clearly feels he must defend . For in that order Genet is simply not possible . Sartre long ago defended a similar thesis in his &quot; Saint Genet. &quot; The reviewer might have avoided trivializing his own moral and aesthetic position by paying some attention to Sartre ' s discussion . ROBERT A . SCHULTZ , SANTA MONICA INFORMATION SOUGHT For a biographical history of American commercial TV and that of Screen Gems ' John H . Mitchell , focusing_on creativeness and the executives and others who &quot; made_it all happen , &quot; we will appreciate contacts from those who have a personal view of this special part of our heritage .
