   <HEADLINE> COUNTERPUNCH : OK , SO WHAT ' S WRONG WITH THIS PICTURE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The new Fox show &quot; South Central &quot; is the latest attempt to show one side of a particular Los Angeles community -- and not a very happy side . Unfortunately , many watching will believe this is the only side . But the picture is far bigger than just another show featuring African Americans . Because there are so few truly diverse images of people_of_color on television , many were , and for me are , really looking_forward to the standard that &quot; South Central &quot; has the opportunity to set . Hopefully , the show will have a chance to go beyond the standard formula sitcom . &quot; South Central &quot; has merit but it shouldn ' t offend the community it seeks to mirror even if it ' s only &quot; one side. &quot; A constant balance will make a difference . Yes , &quot; South Central &quot; deserves a chance , but so do the community voices that cry_out in frustration over the impact that some of the troubling , recurring images of poverty and violence carry ( &quot; Drama of ' South Central ' Stirs Debate , &quot; Calendar , April 12 ) . True , this &quot; South Central &quot; is just one story of lives occurring in the &quot; ' hood. &quot; But because the public perception about people_of_color is so deeply embedded , any new &quot; old &quot; stereotypical image is cause for concern . Television is a powerful medium and it shapes ( distorts ) the viewpoints of individuals around the globe . When the media fail to show a balanced look_at any particular subject , the view becomes skewed and out_of_focus . But the picture is far bigger ! * There really isn ' t much in the way of diverse images of African Americans , and other people_of_color , in the mass media . Many talented African American actors in television are mired in an abundance of sitcoms . &quot; South Central , &quot; with its dramatic intent , is viewed_as a change that was long in its arrival . I hope it evolves into a powerful vehicle that will help balance the negative image so often shown of South-Central Los Angeles and African Americans in_general . Certainly the role of the store owner in the show strongly does that . Not to mention that the show has one of the best casts_on the tube . I also understand that one show alone cannot carry the entire cultural burden . Historically , the mass media ( be it print , television or film ) have made short work of the images of African Americans , and other people_of_color , in the supposed quest_for reality , a great story or just for entertainment value . I am constantly appalled by the lack of consciousness displayed by film and television executives , who have ( I thought ) some responsibility to the citizens they seek to entertain . This is the picture that needs to be in_focus . I read Greg Braxton ' s Calendar article and many other commentaries and articles in reference_to the &quot; community &quot; being outraged over &quot; South Central &quot; and rarely do they say anything in_regard_to other culturally demeaning shows such_as &quot; Martin &quot; and &quot; Def Comedy Jam. &quot; Perhaps the articles and commentaries should be focused_on why these voices are speaking out , why they have such concerns about these issues , why they haven ' t been given a platform to have meaningful dialogue -- why such concerns exist over our images , which for African Americans and other people_of_color is not a new phenomenon . Furthermore , many in the community are just as eager to speak out on positive television_shows , such_as &quot; Roc , &quot; that balance our images and are socially responsible . However , articles and commentaries concerning the positive are few and far between . * Our images always seem to be decided upon , judged and court-martialed by an unknown system our community is not supposed to question . The community rarely has a say on the distorted , one-dimensional images that repeatedly find their way into the public consciousness . When they do , the media tend to take honest feedback and make_it controversial instead of finding the &quot; root cause &quot; of one ' s frustration . This is the picture we must focus_on and change immediately . The bigger picture asks why , with all_the surrounding talent , haven ' t the networks put_together more great dramatic series featuring African Americans , Asian Americans , Latinos or Native_Americans ? ( The bigger picture reminds me of a study that revealed that African Americans watch more television than any other ethnic group. ) The bigger picture prods me to state that no one should be left_out of the panoramic view ! Just think_of all_the new , fresh , different , culturally rich shows that could be developed in a matter of weeks , if the commitment was there . I would like to be quoted this time next year praising the new crop of shows , or films , because ( finally ) diversity and drama are walking hand-in-hand successfully . Many in the community ( silently in Hollywood ) are struggling to make_sure this happens , even through voices of frustration . The picture could sure use a new angle .</TEXT>
