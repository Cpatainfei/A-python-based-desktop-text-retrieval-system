   <HEADLINE> ART TORRES FOR TOP STATE CONSUMER JOB ; STATE_SENATOR IS PREFERABLE FOR INSURANCE COMMISSIONER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Insurance -- whether for homes , automobiles , health coverage or workers ' compensation -- has been a hot political topic in California for some time now . There have been many controversies over how much it costs , how available it is to consumers and businesses and the ways insurance_companies deal with policyholders . The unceasing disputes were one reason state voters in 1988 made the post of insurance commissioner elective by approving Proposition 103 , the much-debated initiative that also aimed to roll back auto and liability insurance rates . The overall effectiveness of Proposition 103 remains open_to argument , but there can be little doubt that its provision giving voters , rather than the governor , the power to select California ' s insurance commissioner made that previously obscure post an important and highly visible one . The state ' s first elected commissioner , John Garamendi , used the position as a bully pulpit to become a strong -- some critics uncharitably argued strident -- advocate for consumers who felt the insurance industry needed to be firmly regulated . He also used the commissioner ' s job as a springboard for a campaign for the Democratic nomination for governor , and is now leaving_office as a result of his defeat in that race earlier this year . The two major-party candidates running to replace Garamendi are both veteran members of the Legislature who must move_on to new jobs because of term limits . Both state Sen . Art Torres ( D-Los Angeles ) and Assemblyman Charles W . Quackenbush ( R-Cupertino ) can proudly point to long records of public_service in Sacramento , and both are well-regarded as political moderates more interested in getting things done than in ideological posturing . We endorse Torres on the basis of his experience in dealing with insurance issues and his track record as a conscientious , but not contentious , advocate for consumers . Torres has been chairman of the Senate ' s Insurance Committee for three years . He was elevated to that post by the leadership of the Legislature after the previous chairman , Alan Robbins , agreed to plead guilty to taking bribes from a powerful insurance industry lobbyist , among other counts . Torres helped restore public confidence in the committee . He pushed legislation to reform the state ' s badly run workers ' compensation system , to crack_down on auto insurance fraud and to protect the rights of homeowners who complained they had been poorly served by insurance_companies after disasters like the Oakland Hills fire and the Northridge earthquake . Although hard-working , Quackenbush simply cannot match Torres ' track record on insurance issues or his knowledge of the insurance industry . A Silicon_Valley resident , Quackenbush has good ideas on using computer_technology to make the state insurance department , and the industry itself , more efficient and customer-friendly -- ideas that should interest Torres . It is somewhat troubling that more_than half of the money given to Quackenbush ' s campaign ( more_than $ 600 # 000 by last accounting ) has come from insurance industry sources . By contrast , Torres has accepted roughly $ 100 # 000 from sources with insurance industry links , mostly law_firms that represent insurance_companies . Both legislators argue they would not allow insurance industry money to sway them from the strongly pro-consumer stance that Garamendi took , and we take them at their word . But on the basis of their records , Torres ' claim surely will sound more credible to voters -- as it did to us .</TEXT>
