   <HEADLINE> HOW 3 U.S. FIRMS SOLVED THE JAPAN ENIGMA ; TRADE : A WILLINGNESS TO EXAMINE THEIR FAULTS HELPED APPLE , DOW AND THE LITTLE-KNOWN JMDS SUCCEED IN A TOUGH MARKET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Apple Computer Inc. first ventured into the Japanese market in 1977 , its name recognition was so low and management coordination so poor that its first shipment of &quot; Apples &quot; was met by a refrigerated truck . Dow Chemical Co . faced the opposite problem when it proposed 20 years ago to build a caustic_soda plant here . The well-known Dow name terrified Japanese chemical companies . &quot; We must suppress Dow , a world seller with its massive capital and technology , before it lands in Japan , &quot; a panic-stricken Kaname Kashima , director of the Japan Soda Industry Assn. , declared on a 1974 television_show . Dow Chemical persevered , steadily developing relations with Japanese firms and taking_advantage of cracks in the barriers to foreign investment . The company currently has seven units in Japan -- some wholly owned subsidiaries and others joint_ventures -- that operate in industries ranging from construction to pharmaceuticals . And Apple now ranks second in Japan ' s fiercely competitive personal_computer market . But it is not just famous companies that are finding ways to overcome the difficulties of doing business in Japan . Among the little-known successes is Japan Marketing Data Systems Ltd. , which conducts a lucrative business helping bigger firms -- including Apple -- make direct-mail end_runs around Japan ' s complex distribution system . As Washington and Tokyo face_off over contentious trade issues that could spiral into a tit-for-tat trade war , the experiences of these three very different companies demonstrate both the depth and limitations of change here . Their experiences also show that U.S. firms willing to examine their own faults can become winners in what is still one of the toughest markets in the world . During Apple ' s first decade in Japan , the Cupertino , Calif.-based firm seemed to do almost everything wrong , from illogical distribution routes to trying to sell computers with user manuals and software available only in English to installing managers who didn ' t speak Japanese or understand the market . Apple is an example of &quot; how not to succeed in Japan , &quot; a U.S. State_Department official said in 1988 . &quot; People called us a laughingstock , &quot; Apple President Michael H . Spindler noted during a recent visit to Tokyo . The challenge , he added , was : &quot; Get the product right so people can use it . Price it right so people can buy_it . Then build a distribution system so people can find it. &quot; Apple ' s turnaround began in 1989 , when it put_on the market Japanese-language software for its products . That was the same year it hired Shigechika Takeuchi , a highly respected Toshiba Corp . executive , to head Apple Japan . He quickly broadened Apple ' s distribution networks and cut_prices . Apple sold about 300 # 000 Macintosh computers in Japan last year , carving out a 13.4 % share_in Japan ' s intensely competitive personal_computer market , up from 8.1 % in 1992 . That consolidated its position as second only to long-dominant NEC Corp. , whose share slipped from 52 % in 1992 to 49 % last year . Company officials predict a 20 % Apple market share next year . Although Takeuchi stepped_down as president late last year and his successor has not yet been named , Apple seems well on its way to achieving its goal of $ 1 billion in annual sales in Japan . For Dow Chemical , the key to winning in Japan was seeking opportunities in many market segments and looking_for joint_ventures and other ways to serve Japanese companies after its initial plan to enter the market was barred . Dow ' s determination paid_off as trade_barriers fell and other market forces made the company more acceptable . For example , Japan ' s three-year recession has prompted more companies to consider Dow ' s lower-priced products . &quot; ' Quality at any price ' is no longer acceptable to the local consumer or manufacturer , &quot; said James W . Harris , president of Dow Chemical Japan Ltd . &quot; A lower-cost ( foreign ) product is ( an option ) now , even if it means they have to break relationships with somebody they ' ve been doing business with for a very long time. &quot; Dow Chemical ' s worldwide presence has also helped it sell itself as Japanese companies themselves have become more global . &quot; A global company that can supply Toyota in Japan , Toyota in North_America and Toyota in Europe with a common product , made any place and delivered to meet their needs at the lowest cost-to-serve , is going_to win , &quot; Harris said . Sumitomo Dow Ltd. , a 50-50 joint_venture , will open Japan ' s largest plant for manufacture of polycarbonate plastics , a key material for the automotive and consumer electronics_industries . The venture pairs Dow ' s technology with Sumitomo ' s customer network , Harris said . Dow is also building an aluminum nitride plant in Michigan for production aimed primarily at the Japanese computer chip manufacturing market , he said . Dow has a staff of five here whose sole responsibility is to help Japanese companies ensure a match between their new products and Dow materials . Japan Marketing Data Systems ' success is_due to its ability to facilitate direct marketing to get past a key obstacle to foreign firms doing business in Japan . Japan ' s infamous multilayered distribution system not only jacks_up prices by 30 % or more , due_to profit taking at each level of the network , but it also ends_up blocking foreign manufacturers from contact with their customer base , said Charles T . Luebker , founder and president of JMDS . Direct mail and related telemarketing operations overcome such problems by delivering goods directly to consumers and also providing manufacturers with information about what kind of people buy their products , he said . JMDS , with $ 10 million in revenue last year , has doubled its business every year for the past five as a result of increased demand for its services by foreign firms that don ' t know how , or have no mechanisms , to reach Japanese consumers directly , said Marc D . Fuoti , executive_vice_president . JMDS clients include L.L. Bean , Philip Morris Cos. , Cigna Corp . and Apple . A key JMDS function is to act_as its clients ' agent in Japan , Luebker said . For L.L. Bean , JMDS handles requests for catalogues and other customer queries . For Cigna , it channels insurance applications to Japanese consumers . Apple sells software upgrades to existing customers in Japan only through telephone_orders made to a JMDS number , Luebker said . When Apple relied_on Japanese distributors for_sales in the 1980s , it &quot; had virtually no contact with the people who were actually using Apple computers , &quot; Luebker said . But Apple needed to be in touch with a sample of its user base &quot; in_order to know what ' s happening in the market , &quot; he said . By selling software upgrades through JMDS , Apple now has a data base of customers it can survey to learn what can be done to sell still more in Japan . Executives at Apple , Dow and JMDS said pressure from Washington has helped win more access for foreign products in Japan . But they also expressed fear that the United States might overplay its hand .</TEXT>
