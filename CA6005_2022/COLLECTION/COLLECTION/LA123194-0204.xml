   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; ITALY ENDS YEAR OF HOPE WHERE IT STARTED ; POLITICS : PREMIER WHO PROMISED REBIRTH FELL AS FAST AS HE ROSE . NATION AGAIN LACKS STRONG GOVERNMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An extraordinary political year limps to a close_in Italy today amid dispiriting national recognition that , after months of great ferment and hope , nothing at all has changed . The actors are new but not the plot : There is no effective government or much prospect of one arriving any time soon . As President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro pokes through the debris of a billionaire ' s dream gone_wrong , it is not clear whether 1995 will bring new elections or a tortured attempt to forge another coalition government . Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi , who resigned Dec . 22 when his right-wing coalition fractured , remains as a caretaker until Scalfaro decides what to do . Berlusconi , the 58-year-old media tycoon and novice politician who improbably rose_to_power overnight and fell almost as fast , is demanding new elections . On Friday , Scalfaro , a Christian Democratic old-timer who is now officially nonpartisan , completed a round of consultations with political_leaders that was inconclusive but did not go Berlusconi ' s way . Scalfaro said his talks had provided &quot; a clear and evident result : that a majority in Parliament say ' No ' to immediate elections. &quot; The president said he would embark_on a second round of talks next week . Berlusconi , for his part , remains convinced that new elections will come_in the spring -- and that he will win them as he did last March ' s vote , which was supposed to have signaled the rebirth of responsible politics after decades of corrupt cronyism among a handful of entrenched mainline parties . &quot; Despite maneuvering by our opponents , I ' m convinced we can do_it , &quot; Berlusconi told the Spanish newspaper El Mundo . Scalfaro ' s difficulty will now be to come_up with something approaching a functioning coalition . A key question is who will head it . By some accounts , Scalfaro may turn toward an interim , apolitical government of technicians who would administer the country and carry_out electoral reforms . That is precisely where Italy stood one year ago after a corruption scandal eviscerated parties that had shared power for more_than four decades . After the first-round talks ended Friday , analysts saw virtually no chance that Scalfaro would ask Berlusconi himself to try to form a new government . Berlusconi ' s Forza Italia , or &quot; Go , Italy , &quot; and its neo-Fascist allies in the National Alliance are substantially alone in wanting new elections . The third coalition pillar , the Northern League -- led by populist-federalist Umberto Bossi , whose split with Berlusconi brought the government down -- wants a new coalition rather than elections . Bossi rebelled against what he called Berlusconi ' s failure to follow_through on electoral promises to promote federalism and to enact antitrust_laws that would have forced him to divest at least part of his media empire . Centrist parties that rose from the ashes of the disgraced former Christian Democrats hope for a share of power in any new coalition . So do the leftist former Communists , who have been the country ' s second-largest political_movement since World_War_II but have never shared national power . Although Berlusconi ' s foes can muster a mathematical majority in both houses of Parliament , he is counting_on their inability to agree on policies . * Berlusconi entered politics a year ago to head_off what he saw as a certain victory by the former Communists in the spring elections . The gamble worked . Voters disgruntled by the scandal-tarred parties they had been electing since World_War_II turned_to free-market Berlusconi rather than the former Communists , now officially social democrats . The right-wing government proved short-lived . Installed in May with promises of a_million new jobs and economic reforms to reduce Italy ' s huge public deficit , it ran_into trouble almost immediately . By the time Bossi broke openly , Berlusconi had been forced to surrender to union demands to soften key economic measures and had also lost popular support as measured in recent local elections .</TEXT>
