   <HEADLINE> NOW YOU DON ' T HAVE TO BE A GEEK TO USE THE NET ; BUT CAN THESE GUYS -- OR ANYONE ELSE -- MAKE A BUCK OFF MOSAIC , THE SOFTWARE THAT HELPS MAKE THE INTERNET ACCESSIBLE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jim Clark is late for a meeting , and Marc Andreessen -- boy_wonder , cyberspace star , author of a computer_program that inspired Clark to sink $ 5 million of_his_own money into a new company bent_on commercializing it -- is threatening to strip off his clothes . &quot; I ' ll be there in a moment , &quot; the avuncular Clark keeps saying , a line that -- and he appears to know this -- only further infuriates the impatient 23-year-old computer geek-cum-vice president . Hailed in recent months as something akin to the Moses of the Internet , Andreessen is still not quite ready to meet venture_capitalists all by himself . They make an odd couple : the well-dressed , 50-year-old founder of Silicon Graphics Inc. and the blond programmer from New Lisbon , Wis. , who can be found pounding down Cokes and code at the local Denny ' s in the wee hours of the morning . But Clark and Andreessen are among those at the forefront of a race to bring commerce to the Internet and the Internet to the masses -- and they have something of a head_start . You ' ve heard of it . The Internet : global jumble of computer_networks and repository of informational gems , cutting-edge communication tools and new ways to make money -- and all pretty much inaccessible to common mortals doomed to a life without the techno-whiz gene . But that is changing fast , and mostly because of a program called Mosaic , written by Andreessen and a bunch of students at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . Many of them , it so happens , now work for Clark at Mosaic Communications , the 7-month-old firm he operates out of a suite of offices evenly divided between whiz-kid hackers and neatly suited business types . Mosaic Netscape , the firm ' s first effort at improving on the popular program , has become the buzz of the Internet since its release last month . ( Andreessen and his college comrades were forced to sacrifice their preferred nickname &quot; Mozilla , &quot; for the greater good of commercial marketing . &quot; We considered it , &quot; Clark says . &quot; But we just didn ' t think it would fly. &quot; ) Indeed , the mass migration of programers from the university ' s National Center for Supercomputing Applications to the corporate world last spring has had more significant hangups as well : the young firm is expected to announce Monday that it is changing its name to Netscape Communications , the result of a tussle over intellectual property_rights with the NCSA , which continues to work_on improving its own version of the software . * Mosaic allows users to browse through the Internet ' s mass of information by clicking on pictures and highlighted text . It displays graphs and maps , plays audio and video ( after a fashion ) and lets Net surfers follow an idea through a trail of computers across the world , unencumbered by arcane tech-lingo . Mosaic makes the Internet pretty . It also makes_it easy for a normal person to use . At the same time , the computer_language Mosaic is based on -- HTML , or hypertext_markup_language -- is so simple that contributing to the Internet has become almost as easy as navigating through it . Businesses , governments , non-profit organizations and random individuals are plastering the World Wide Web -- as the portion of the Internet ' s computers that speak HTML is known -- with digital data ranging from personal photos to Securities and Exchange Commission filings . Such &quot; home pages , &quot; as they are called_in Net-talk , are like graphic tables of contents that allow access to selected data at the click of a mouse. ) And the number of computers_storing such data around the world has multiplied to 10 # 000 from 100 at the beginning of last year . Net sociologists predict Mosaic and its clones will soon democratize communication in a way the electronic revolution has always promised but never quite achieved . And business_executives -- this is where multimillionaire Clark and his unlikely deputies from Illinois come_in -- herald the emergence of a new market and a new , inexpensive way to hawk their wares . &quot; It ' s like when the car first came_out and you had to crank it , and later someone figured_out to put a key ignition in , &quot; says George Brenner , vice_president of information services at MCA / Universal , whose &quot; Universal Cyberwalk &quot; Web site went on-line last week . &quot; You don ' t even have to know how to type. &quot; Recent additions to the Web include the Caltrans page ( for checking traffic maps ) , MGM ' s Stargate page ( clips from the recently released film ) and the White_House ( get a virtual tour , hear Socks meow ) . Also : Megadeth , the Burlington Coat Factory Warehouse , Art Crimes ( graffiti from the around the world ) , the complete writings of Nostradamus , Brett ' s Page ( &quot; Welcome to the Winona ( Ryder ) archive &quot; ) and Romania . The striking workers at the San Francisco Chronicle post daily editions of the &quot; San Francisco Free Press &quot; on the Web , complete with photographs and a red , white and blue masthead . Chronicle management , meanwhile , publishes its own Web paper . And on Election_Day last week , a Web site set_up by the secretary_of_state and Digital Equipment Corp . to post returns logged nearly half a_million &quot; clicks &quot; through its pages , the heaviest traffic the Web has seen since NASA ' s computers offered live pictures of comet fragments hitting Jupiter earlier this year . &quot; Mosaic blew the lid off , &quot; says Clark . &quot; Marc and his team , by doing_it , blew the lid off . And suddenly people began to use the Net as a means of disseminating information that is easy to browse . Mosaic is the first_step into the future , and you don ' t need a broad-band data highway in the sky to get there. &quot; Clark , who underwent a conversion of sorts after tracking Andreessen down through ( what else ) his home page at the University of Illinois , hopes to make money off his realization that it is the Internet -- rather than as-yet nonexistent &quot; interactive television &quot; -- that will be delivering new information , education and entertainment services to Americans in the near term . &quot; It ' s amazing to me that I was so brainwashed , &quot; says Clark , who initially had aimed to get_into interactive television when he left Silicon Graphics last year . &quot; Once I allowed myself to step_out of that and think more clearly about where markets are today , I thought : ' This is it . This is where the real market is , so grab the initiative. ' &quot; What he did , with help from the elite venture_capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers , was grab Andreessen . In a springtime raid on Urbana-Champaign , the duo then recruited five of the seven other members of the core Mosaic team at the federally funded NCSA &quot; They said , ' Do you want to come work for us for something like five times what you ' re making now , be free_of the university bureaucracy and finish what you started ? ' &quot; remembers John Mittelhauser , who like most of his colleagues , had hit the top of the university ' s undergraduate wage_scale at $ 6.85 an hour . &quot; We said , ' Yeah. ' &quot; Facing an onrush of competitors -- dozens of firms are working_on spiffier versions of Mosaic -- Clark ' s company has done what it can to capitalize on the cachet of having the original developers on board . It ' s a tack that has led to more_than a little resentment in some quarters . Critics have charged Mosaic Communications with arrogance for assuming the &quot; Mosaic &quot; name for itself and refusing to license the original code from NCSA . The firm says Netscape was written from scratch , but the sensitive discussions with the university that are prompting the firm to change its name continue . Among the pending issues : copyright infringement and trade_secret violations . &quot; We have an obligation to protect our intellectual property , &quot; says Marcia Rotunda , associate university counsel . There is also the tendency to confuse the browser program -- and the people who wrote it -- with the mass of text and images to which it gives access . &quot; People say that Mosaic is the killer application , but really it has the potential to be the killer app because of what ' s underneath it , the World Wide Web , &quot; says Chris Wilson , another member of the original Mosaic team who now works for Spry Inc. on that Seattle firm ' s version of the software . &quot; Marc didn ' t do that . NCSA didn ' t even do that . I ' ll do my penance to Tim Berners-Lee and CERN. &quot; Berners-Lee and a team of high-energy physicists at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in Geneva , known as CERN from an earlier French name , essentially created the Web in 1989 as a way to communicate with other scientists around the world . But it was not until Mosaic came_along that the network became easily accessible to large_numbers of computer users . NCSA ' s Mosaic was developed with government funds , and it is distributed free to non-commercial users . For-profit concerns have licensed nearly 10 million copies of Mosaic this year through the university ' s designated representative , Spyglass Inc. Andreessen is quick to acknowledge that his firm is not the only one in the game . Other commercial versions of the program , such_as Spry ' s Air Mosaic , are already on the market . Competitors include Spyglass ' Enhanced Mosaic , MCC ' s MacWeb , Pipeline and Netcom ' s Netcruiser . Both Microsoft and Apple Computer have announced plans to include a Web navigator program in future versions of their basic software . Clark and Andreessen say they don ' t plan to make money on the &quot; client &quot; version of their software , the program that runs_on a PC : It was released for free over the Internet last month as part of a gambit to gain market share quickly . But the &quot; server &quot; versions of the software , which commercial organizations use to construct their own Web offerings , sell for $ 1 # 500 . And a version designed for secure electronic commerce , including credit_card transactions -- which will go_for $ 5 # 000 a pop -- is_due out next month . On Friday , First Data Corp . said it planned to use the secure version of the Mosaic Communications software to enable its bank customers -- including First Interstate Bancorp . to provide on-line credit_card authorizations in real time . Microsoft and Visa International announced a similar effort last week . Such services would allow consumers to purchase products via the Net without exposing credit_card information to prying electronic eyes . Mosaic Communications ' success will depend_on the evolution of the Internet as a business tool by which companies can communicate with their customers and sell a broad range of products and services . Dozens of firms are working toward that goal , though for now the commercial_activity on the Web amounts mostly to digital brochures : Web postings are a useful way of reaching potential customers who happen to be_on the Internet . &quot; Going_on line &quot; has also become a status symbol that some companies have leveraged into publicity . &quot; Look_at Pizza Hut , &quot; says Jayne Levin , editor of the Internet Letter , referring to public fascination with the firm ' s experiment in taking pizza orders via the Web , announced earlier this year . &quot; And their service only works in the Santa Clara ( Calif. ) area. &quot; AT &amp; T ' s futuristic phones can be examined on the Web . Numerous florists offer delivery services . Miller Genuine Draft has set_up a &quot; tap room. &quot; General Electric ' s plastic products are browse-able , and Fox Television offers program schedules and video clips . The cost is low : Commercial Web sites typically cost a_few thousand dollars a month , though homemade home pages can be run_off a personal_computer and cost almost nothing to maintain . * Still , the audience is small : Only about 2 million Internet fans now have the kind of connection to the network needed to work browser programs such_as Mosaic . And depending_on the speed of your modem ( the device that links your computer to the Net by telephone ) , it can take an annoyingly long_time for images to materialize . Lynx , a more widely used Internet search tool , displays only text . An ambitious plan for conducting more substantial business on the Net -- including publishing , advertising and other functions that might generate revenue -- was scuttled recently by Westport , Conn.-based Mecklermedia , after attracting only one customer over several months . Still , information and entertainment providers such_as the San Jose Mercury News ( which is working with Clark ' s company to develop a news service on the Web ) , MCA and Viacom hold_out hope that the Internet will become a viable business platform . ( Viacom , which owns Paramount Pictures , launched its Web site this month with a sneak_preview of the soon-to-be released film &quot; Star Trek : Generations. &quot; ) With the advent of secure communications , many expect the Internet to become a major vehicle for buying everything from flowers to fashion . Commercial on-line services such_as America Online also aim to fill that role , but Clark and other Internet proponents believe potential cyber-sellers will want to cut_out the middlemen and maintain direct contact with customers . Mosaic Communications , of course , aims to play something of a middleman role itself , helping companies set_up their services and possibly taking a small piece of the revenue they generate . Clark is closemouthed about precisely how all this will work , and there don ' t appear to be a whole_lot of committed customers thus far . Indeed , despite the hype about business on the Internet , Mosaic ' s lasting impact may yet be in opening doors to non-commercial forms of information and communications . Says Sam Coleman , a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , who maintains a list of all_the California Web sites in his spare_time : &quot; The whole network , this whole network culture , has kind of grown_up in an ad-hoc way , &quot; Coleman says . &quot; This is true grass-roots stuff here. &quot; Enter the &quot; universal record locater &quot; address for his page , and the state seal comes_up , along with a blue highlighted list of Web sites around California . Click on &quot; Earrings , by Lisa &quot; and you are transported to Poway , where you can choose from pictures of translucent beads and turquoise stones . Another click sends you to a computer in Watsonville , where you can learn all about biplane tours . Surf and weather reports , restaurant guides , the Mt . Wilson Observatory and several high_schools throughout the state are also on the list . Amy Brown , 22 , who put_up her own home page last summer , says she had 1 # 700 accesses one day last week , nearly double that of a florist who rents space on the same computer . Her page has links to her friends ' computers in San Francisco and Athens , Ohio , plus other Web sites she thinks are particularly cool . The Coral Gables , Fla. , manicurist says it doesn ' t take any real technical skill to construct a home page . &quot; It ' s a reflection of yourself ; you get creative , &quot; says Brown , who has received several requests for dates despite her disclaimer that the picture on her home page doesn ' t look anything like her . &quot; It ' s nice to peer into the life of somebody that you don ' t know who lives 8 # 000 miles away. &quot; William Scott Proudfoot , a librarian at West Valley College in Saratoga , Calif. , recently created a home page so he could share with the world the letters his great-grandfather , a Civil War veteran , sent to Proudfoot ' s great-grandmother . &quot; We thought_about giving them to the University of Iowa , but we wanted more general-public type people to see them , &quot; says Proudfoot . Since the beginning of the month , more_than 1 # 600 people have looked_at the site , which includes pictures of Newton and Hannah Scott and their obituaries . From there , a browser can travel_to the Library of Congress ' Web site to view more Civil War photographs or to Brian Boyle ' s site in New Jersey , where he has compiled a list of other Civil War information available on the Web . &quot; Is this going_to change the world ? I don ' t know , &quot; says Andreessen , who has grown sensitive to the criticisms of hyperbole about himself and his program : &quot; We ' re certainly helping to open things up_to a lot of people . Are we changing the world ? I don ' t know . Well , yeah . I guess we are. &quot; More on Computers * Reprints of Amy Harmon ' s two-part series on the multimedia gold_rush are available through Times on Demand . Cost is $ 7.95.
