   <HEADLINE> PROPOSITIONS 184 , 187</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In regard_to your editorial , &quot; Prop . 184 : Why Even Polly Klaas ' Father Says It ' s a Big Mistake , &quot; Oct . 24 : When are the politicians , the media and judiciary going_to get the message ? We the people are_sick and tired_of crime . We don ' t care if it ' s stealing a loaf_of_bread or a killing , we have had it.I can ' t wait to vote yes on 184 and 187 . JOHN WALKER San Pedro * It seems that the initiative process in California is being used for purely demonstrative purpose . While the initiative process has always had the characteristics of a popularity poll , Propositions 184 and 187 have all_the earmarks of advisory plebiscites . While some may think that is just fine , it seems to me that the mischief that can be done_by passing laws as a form of expressing frustration with the status_quo could be quite bad . Unintended consequences , as the conservatives are fond of saying , are certainly waiting in the wings when such laws are passed . EDWARD SIMONS San Bernardino</TEXT>
