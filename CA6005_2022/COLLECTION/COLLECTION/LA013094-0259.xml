   <HEADLINE> ' FREEDOM TRAIN ' KICKS OFF S . AFRICA CAMPAIGN ; ELECTIONS : ANC LEADER MANDELA PRESENTS PARTY PLATFORM AFTER RAIL TRIP . PRESIDENT DE KLERK COURTS BLACK SUPPORT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Black leader Nelson Mandela laid_out his party ' s ambitious plans for social justice and economic reform Saturday on a day that essentially kicked_off the political_campaign for this nation ' s first multiracial democratic elections . Dressed in a dashiki and sporting a broad grin , Mandela rode a 14-car &quot; freedom train &quot; filled with flag-waving supporters to present the platform of his African National Congress to nearly 1 # 000 diplomats and business , ethnic and religious_leaders in a convention center at the edge of this sprawling black township . &quot; The ANC is ready to govern , &quot; said the 75-year-old Mandela on a stage framed by arches of green , black and gold balloons -- the ANC ' s colors -- and a huge banner with the party ' s new slogan : &quot; A Better Life for All. &quot; President Frederik W . de Klerk , Mandela ' s chief opponent in the voting scheduled to take_place in three months , will present his party ' s platform Wednesday at the National Party convention in Kempton Park , across Johannesburg from Soweto . De Klerk finished a three-day campaign swing Saturday seeking support from blacks in rural townships east of Johannesburg . But his rallies and speeches were repeatedly marred when hecklers either shouted him down or threatened supporters of the National Party , which created and enforced apartheid . &quot; The National Party is the real party of peace , &quot; De Klerk shouted into a microphone Saturday as several hundred ANC supporters blocked a road , chanted and sang to drown him out when he opened a party office in the township of Mzinoni . &quot; The ANC is the party of conflict. &quot; De Klerk has increasingly hammered that theme in hopes of painting the ANC as an organization that sponsors intimidation and terrorism in the townships . Mandela , in turn , has lashed_out at De Klerk for not controlling the mostly black-on-black violence that has left more_than 13 # 000 people dead since the dismantling of apartheid began in February , 1990 . Mandela also accuses De Klerk of trying to bury the past . &quot; There are those who would like us to believe that the past doesn ' t exist , that decades of apartheid rule have suddenly disappeared , &quot; he said Saturday . &quot; But the economic and social devastation of apartheid remains . Our country is in a mess. &quot; While the two leading candidates prepared_for a busy week of campaign appearances , conservative black_and_white militants gathered separately to prepare plans to boycott the April elections and use force , if necessary , to resist an ANC-led government . In Ulundi , capital of the Zulu homeland , Chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi told a special congress of his Inkatha Freedom Party that his followers should avoid the voting_booth and instead use what he called &quot; the politics of resistance &quot; in the face of what polls suggest will be an ANC landslide . He said the interim constitution passed_by Parliament last month , which will serve as the basis of the new democratic government , was &quot; specifically designed to promote ANC power and is an instrument for the Inkatha ' s destruction. &quot; &quot; I say no to the present constitution , and I say as this constitution stands , I do not see how we can enter elections , &quot; Buthelezi said in a rambling , three-hour speech . With his party in growing disarray , the mercurial Zulu leader who was once Mandela ' s chief black rival had been widely expected to tell his party whether or not he was going_to join the election . His continuing equivocation passes the ball back to the Freedom Alliance , the unlikely coalition of Inkatha , several black homeland leaders and the Afrikaner Volksfront , an umbrella organization of 60 right-wing white groups . The government and the ANC have a negotiating session scheduled Monday with the alliance to address the coalition ' s demands the constitution be amended to provide_for greater regional powers . The closed-door talks have been deadlocked for weeks after the alliance turned_down an offer of concessions on the constitution in return for a commitment to participate in the elections . Clearly , some members of the alliance see little room for compromise . Pro-apartheid whites , in particular , demand the right to create their own white state within South_Africa rather than submit to black majority_rule . Several thousand right-wingers , meeting Saturday at a fairground in Pretoria , declared independence for the would-be white homeland and approved the creation of a symbolic transitional government to run it . Ferdi Hartzenberg , the fiery leader of the white separatist Conservative_Party , was sworn_in as shadow president . The crowd shouted_down a more moderate Afrikaner leader , retired Gen . Constand Viljoen , who suggested continued talks with the ANC and government to forestall bloodshed . So far , however , bellicose threats from the right have proved all bluster . For one thing , the dozens of defiant white parties involved can ' t agree on the proposed borders of the homeland they demand , nor even what self-determination would entail . Some want to ban blacks entirely , others to allow them as servants and laborers , while some want the entire country to simply revert to the racist policies of the past . Both Mandela and De Klerk oppose creating autonomous territories along racial , tribal or ethnic lines . But negotiators from both parties have indicated they would consider provincial boundaries within a federal system so that particular groups , such_as Zulus or whites , would be in the majority . Despite such conflicting signals from the fringes , one key part of the April 27-29 election -- the winner -- remains a near certainty . Polls consistently show the ANC will win a clear majority of the popular vote , meaning Mandela would become the first black president . The National Party is favored in only one of the nine new provinces , the Western Cape , where there is a large population of mixed-race voters who are nervous about ANC control . ANC leaders have said their goal is to win 67 % of the seats in the new Parliament , a big enough majority so the ANC can rewrite the interim constitution without cutting compromises or deals . For now , however , the ANC platform is long on promises and short on specifics . In his speech , Mandela said the party would focus_on improving the quality_of_life by focusing_on job creation . He pledged a massive public works program to provide jobs for some 2.5 million people over the next decade . For the poor , he said the new government can build 1 million homes_in five years , provide running water and toilets to over 1 million families and bring electricity to 2.5 million homes . He said the government would introduce a single education system to provide 10 years of free and compulsory schooling , rather than the multiple and unequal systems set_up under apartheid . Tokyo Sexwale , a senior ANC leader , earlier had warned that the platform may raise expectations that will be impossible to fulfill and dangerous to ignore . &quot; For us to turn the country around it will take decades and decades , &quot; he said as the &quot; freedom train &quot; rumbled from Johannesburg to Soweto . &quot; We know that . That is the tragedy of apartheid. &quot;</TEXT>
