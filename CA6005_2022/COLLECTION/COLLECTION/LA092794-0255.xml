   <HEADLINE> CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN ; HAITI CLASHES RAISE ' MISSION CREEP ' FEAR ; MILITARY : SOME SAY U.S. POLICE ROLE EXCEEDS OPERATION ' S ORIGINAL SCOPE . PENTAGON MAINTAINS IT ' S ESSENTIAL FOR SUCCESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Is the American military venture in Haiti falling victim to &quot; mission creep &quot; -- the kind of unconscious expansion of U.S. troops ' basic role in a foreign operation that helped turn the intervention in Somalia last year into a debacle ? At first blush , the symptoms appear to be there : The Clinton_Administration entered Haiti with the assertion that U.S. troops would not become involved in day-to-day police operations there . That would be left to the Haitian police . Barely a day later , clearly uncomfortable U.S. officials announced that as a result of the excessive force being used by the Haitian police , U.S. military_police would be &quot; overseeing &quot; the Haitians -- and personally intervening if necessary to prevent abuses . In other words , the U.S. troops would be playing cop after all . The prospect of mounting risks for U.S. troops has sent jitters through Congress , which still is smarting from the Somalia experience , when a shift in the mission -- from ensuring security to hunting_down clan leader Mohammed Farah Aidid -- sparked a war between Aidid and U.S. forces . Those worries were heightened by an incident Saturday when U.S. Marines killed 10 Haitian policemen after a_couple_of the Haitians pointed firearms at the Americans . The Marines acted well within their rules of engagement , but the exchange raised visions of Somali-style violence . Alarmed by the seeming mission creep_in Haiti , U.S. lawmakers began moving Monday to set a firm deadline for withdrawing all American troops from the country , with plans to bring legislation to the floor soon . And commentators have taken_to leveling the charge as a matter of routine . &quot; This isn ' t ( just ) mission creep -- it ' s mission leap ! &quot; Daniel Schorr , senior correspondent for National Public Radio , told his listeners over the weekend . Last week ' s rhetorical turnabout aside , both the Pentagon and independent military analysts deny that the Administration has dangerously expanded the military ' s mission in Haiti and say that America has to serve as a police_force to make the operation work . &quot; We are resisting and we will continue to resist mission creep , &quot; Defense_Secretary William J . Perry told reporters at a briefing Monday afternoon . &quot; We will do what is necessary in the exigencies of the moment , ( but ) we will not undertake to perform routine police functions , &quot; such_as crowd_control , which the Haitian police still are performing . Robert B . Oakley , former President George_Bush ' s special envoy in the first ( and highly successful ) part of the Somalia operation -- who vigorously criticized the mission creep that eventually strangled the second phase of the U.S. intervention -- agreed with Perry . Had the United States actually invaded Haiti under_fire , U.S. troops would have had to beat_back the Haitian military and would have been forced to assume all police functions in the country . &quot; I would n ' t say that this is mission creep , &quot; he said . Andrew Krepinevich , a former Pentagon strategist now with the Defense Budget Project , said that at least part of the military ' s problem has been the takeover accord worked_out by former President Jimmy_Carter , which requires that U.S. troops cooperate with the Haitian police . Had U.S. troops had to enter Haiti by force , they would have overturned the Haitian police altogether and taken_on all police functions by necessity . The Carter plan obviated the need for that , but the Haitian cops overstepped their bounds . Now , the Americans are back in the game . Even if the mission has not yet been expanded that much , the job still is a risky one for the Americans who are_on duty in Haiti . &quot; The dangers would be inherent anyway , &quot; said retired Marine Brig . Gen . George H . Walls Jr. , who dealt with Haitian refugees in 1992 . &quot; The potential for things that you don ' t want to happen is there . It was one of the risks that we had to assess at the beginning. &quot; Indeed , Pentagon strategists are not so worried about the current situation as they are about the danger of mushrooming unrest -- and possibly some sniping against U.S. troops -- beginning next weekend as the Oct . 15 deadline for the restoration of the government of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide nears . Haitian military_leaders already &quot; see their power base eroding , &quot; a senior U.S. military_officer said . &quot; that ' s going_to be the time that we have to pay particular attention. &quot; The Clinton_Administration is trying to rein_in congressional efforts to force a quick exit of U.S. forces . Perry warned lawmakers Monday that setting a specific withdrawal date would only undermine the mission and jeopardize the safety of the expected 15 # 000 troops in Haiti . But many senators and House members appeared unconvinced . &quot; They didn ' t say anything I hadn ' t heard on television the night before , &quot; said Sen . John McCain of Arizona , a leading GOP critic of the operation . Meanwhile , the Pentagon is scrambling to retain the Haitian police as a buffer between U.S. combat troops and Haitian citizens , even if that means coaxing previously errant police back to their jobs . Two days after the Marine squad killed the 10 Haitians , U.S. commanders asked Haiti ' s military chief , Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , to order the remaining policemen , who had scattered , back to their posts . Times staff writer Michael Ross contributed to this story .</TEXT>
