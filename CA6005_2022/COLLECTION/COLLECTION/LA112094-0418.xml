   <TEXT> The chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff voiced strong confidence in President Clinton as commander_in_chief , taking_issue Friday with a statement by Sen . Jesse Helms ( R-N.C. ) . In an unsolicited telephone_interview , Gen . John M . Shalikashvili said he was compelled by Helms ' critical remarks to speak out and avoid any impression that the military leadership endorses the senator ' s assertion that Clinton has not demonstrated an ability to command the U.S. military . &quot; I do not share that view , &quot; he said . &quot; I have been with the President in difficult deliberations and have always found him able to understand the issues , ask the tough questions and make the hard decisions. &quot; Helms , who is in_line to head the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , was asked on CNN ' s &quot; Evans and Novak &quot; whether he thought Clinton was &quot; up_to the job &quot; of commander_in_chief . He replied : &quot; Well , you know , you ask an honest question . I ' ll give you an honest answer . No I do not . And neither do the people in the armed forces. &quot;</TEXT>
