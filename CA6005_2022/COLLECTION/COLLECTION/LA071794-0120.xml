   <HEADLINE> THE NEXT LOS ANGELES : REINVENTING OUR FUTURE ; THE SECRET TO LOS ANGELES IS THAT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than two decades ago , the_English writer Reyner Banham came_to this region and found a strange , sunny new_world where &quot; mobility outweighs monumentality &quot; and where &quot; only the extreme is normal. &quot; He observed , &quot; I share neither the optimism of those who see Los Angeles as the prototype of all future cities , nor the gloom of those who see it as the harbinger of universal urban doom. &quot; PSYCHIC IMAGE : Much has happened since 1971 when Banham penned those words , but they still ring true . Almost from its founding , Los Angeles has assumed a large and usually exaggerated image in the world psyche , alternately painted as a palmy pastel paradise and as an urban disaster worthy of the apocalyptic fiction of Nathanael West . For now , the latter woeful vision predominates , even among many Angelenos . But the reality , as Banham suggests , is somewhere between . It is along this median strip of life that those of us who , by_choice or necessity , live_in or near Los Angeles must negotiate our daily existence . It is to that end that The Times today publishes a special 16-page section , &quot; The Next Los Angeles : Turning Ideas Into Action. &quot; It is meant to offer practical ideas to mend a scarred city ; to help it move_on . Rarely in American history has a major urban_area been so convulsed as Los Angeles has over the last three years . Our mettle has been tested by fires , floods , deadly civil disorders , a deeply depressed economy and , most recently , the Northridge earthquake . Some have reacted by leaving for more placid climes . This special section is meant for the 15.5 million who have stayed and are determined to make this a better place to live . It is striking that the Times Poll found that 69 % of L.A. County residents overall remained satisfied with their communities , although the level of satisfaction varied with locality and stood below the national average . For all_the troubles , Los Angeles still offers much of what drew the movie_makers and millions of others over the last several decades : fine climate , beaches , mountains and deserts , quiet peaceful neighborhoods , good cultural assets , tolerance for eccentricity and non-conformance and economic opportunity . CURRENT REALITIES : For all this , no progress is possible unless it is also understood that this region still has a great_deal of work to do . It is not where it wants to be in race relations , though more has been accomplished here than in many other places in America . The economy is doing better but it is still far from recovered -- and no doubt the tight times have blemished the region ' s record for tolerance of diversity by exacerbating anti-immigrant fever . Violence , street gangs and graffiti have combined with insufficiences in police staffing and police-community relations_to make the appearance of crime greater than the actual reality . The ranks of the homeless are distressingly large ; overwhelmed , too many schools are struggling to educate and socialize our youngsters . The special section addresses these and many other issues , not just to provide yet another litany of woes but to offer practical solutions . In February we published a similar section in which experts were asked to think_about a better future . Some of it was visionary , some highly practical . Today ' s section focuses_on specific feasible steps that can have near-term tangible results . Thus , for example , there is discussion of increasing student interchanges as a means of promoting racial harmony in a region that since 1980 has become both more diverse ethnically and more geographically segregated . And there is considerable discussion of nurturing small business and taking other steps to improve the economy . Most of the ideas presented are not entirely new . Many of them could already have been implemented were it not for ossified state and local_government structures that make innovation difficult . Clearly the region ' s city and county charters , dispersing so_much power to local officials , need updating to deal with regionwide problems . But the section also strongly implies that individual actions , taking personal responsibility , can also make a big difference in solving many urban ills . FUTURE POSSIBILITIES : The Times poll results show that crime and gangs rank well above unemployment and the poor economy as the chief perceived ills of Southern California . Concern about crime is certainly justified . But we should not lose sight of the larger reality that this region stands at an historic economic juncture . Our past glories were built , successively , on ranching , agriculture , oil , entertainment , manufacturing , aerospace and real_estate . But we must recognize that our exuberant economic adolescence is over . While the new underpinnings of our economy are not yet clear , we must realize we have matured and must stand on our own feet . Certainly we can ' t complain that Los Angeles is not getting enough attention from Washington . In some ways the Clinton_Administration is more responsive to needs here than Sacramento is . Fundamentally the real answers to our problems can be found here , especially if we are true_to our history of sometimes freewheeling innovation . In a valiant effort to find rationality in the seemingly random Brownian motion of Los Angeles , Banham 23 years ago reduced Los Angeles to four &quot; ecologies : &quot; Surfurbia , Foothills , the Plains of Id , and Autopia . He would have to expand that list today . But the underlying theme of Banham and other perceptive observers is that the history of Los Angeles suggests that anything is possible here . Let us not forget that .</TEXT>
