   <HEADLINE> THE WORLD ; OFFER NORTH_KOREA A PACKAGE DEAL TO DROP ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Is Bill_Clinton ' s major foreign-policy nightmare -- a confrontation with a North_Korea armed with nuclear_weapons and ballistic_missiles -- over ? Don ' t pop those champagne corks , yet . North_Korea ' s 11th-hour decision to allow the International Atomic Energy Agency to resume inspections of its seven declared nuclear facilities merely averts an immediate clash . While the political furor over the nuclear issue has subsided , the dispute is far from resolved : The potential risks -- ranging from another Korean_war to instability and a nuclear arms race in Asia , to a collapse of an Orwellian family dynasty and chaos on the peninsula -- are as large as ever . Indeed , if North_Korea had not blinked , the IAEA ' s board of governors , which meets tomorrow in Vienna , would have had little choice but to declare that North_Korea had violated its Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty commitment . The agency would then have had to refer the_matter to the U.N. Security_Council , which probably would have imposed some economic sanctions . If IAEA agents are actually permitted to inspect the facilities , the nuclear issue will come_back to where it was a year ago . Then , the agency had demanded to see two suspected nuclear-waste sites that satellite photos revealed North_Korea had hidden from it . It was this demand for a &quot; special inspection &quot; that triggered the current imbroglio . North_Korea threatened to become the first nation to withdraw from the non-proliferation regime , refusing to allow the IAEA to continue its regular inspections . Now we are back to negotiating over access to the waste sites amid continuing suspicions that North_Korea is secretly trying to build nuclear_weapons . North_Korea ' s success in dragging_out the crisis is_due as much to a confused U.S. policy as it is to Pyongyang ' s subterfuge . The large stakes and enormous complexity of the issue ; competing bureaucratic interests producing a rash of leaks and conflicting public statements , and the perception , if not reality , that nobody is in_charge -- all sent mixed signals to North_Korea ' s leaders . Until November , the Administration had pursued an incremental approach , with no sense of what the end game might be . Then Clinton announced he would pursue a comprehensive approach . But to date , Washington has not said what is in the comprehensive package or even if there has been agreement on one . If Pyongyang showed_up at a meeting and offered to trade its nuclear program -- the only &quot; card &quot; the destitute and isolated regime has to play -- Washington , in return , could only offer &quot; another meeting. &quot; If North_Korea permits the IAEA to inspect the waste sites , implements its December , 1991 , agreement with South_Korea to create a denuclearized Korean_Peninsula -- including an intrusive challenge-inspection regime -- and accounts_for all its plutonium , the United States and its key allies , South_Korea and Japan , should reciprocate . North_Korea ' s concerns -- political legitimacy , economic help and security assurances -- are fundamental to its survival . The nuclear issue is inextricably bound up with the reunification of Korea . To succeed , U.S. policy must address the proliferation and the East Asian issues simultaneously . So what is to be done ? First , there is a need for a special coordinator on Korea who would report directly to the President . Whether it is North_Korea acquiring a nuclear_weapon or the collapse of the regime , Korea is an issue that can make or break the Clinton presidency . An experienced , no-nonsense negotiator respected on Capitol_Hill and well regarded by our allies is necessary to manage the policy . Such a person would provide the best hope of disciplining the cumbersome bureaucracy , building bipartisan support , reaching timely decisions and , over the longer term , manage the impact of Korean unification . I say this as one who tried to navigate through this bureaucracy on the Korea issue while serving in the State_Department for almost four years . A &quot; package deal &quot; should be , in_essence , a reciprocal political and confidence-building process involving several stages . For example , if the IAEA is allowed to visit the waste sites or if Pyongyang dismantles its reprocessing facilities , lifting the trade_embargo against North_Korea might be considered . Any such step should be closely coordinated with parallel steps by Seoul and Tokyo . In addition to the nuclear bombs , North_Korea ' s sale of ballistic_missiles and its development of a 1 # 000-kilometer missile capable of striking South_Korea and Japan , as well as its forward-deployed conventional forces , should be elements of a grand bargain designed to reduce tension , facilitate North-South reconciliation and engineer a &quot; soft landing &quot; for North_Korea , which is undergoing a political succession whose outcome will not be complete until Kin Il Sung leaves . There is little risk in a comprehensive approach . If North_Korea rejects a magnanimous proposition , Pyongyang would , in_essence , be saying a nuclear bomb is its best insurance_policy . In that case , having gone the extra diplomatic mile , the United States would be well-positioned to assemble a global coalition to impose U.N. sanctions on North_Korea . Despite fears of Chinese obstructionism , if Washington made such a reasonable offer , Beijing is likely not to oppose sanctions . During the Gulf War , it should be recalled , China abstained on a vote on sanctions . If North_Korea accepts the offer , it would have to open_up its hermetically sealed society to absorb economic aid , trade and investment . Such a process would either dramatically change the regime or lead to its demise . Whichever , U.S. interests would be advanced : It is a win-win proposition . To do any less would not only risk erosion of the non-proliferation regime , but increase the risk of confrontation by miscalculation and tarnish U.S. credibility in East Asia -- an area of growing importance to the United States. *</TEXT>
