   <HEADLINE> IRISH NATIONALIST EXPECTED TO GET U.S. VISA ; NORTHERN_IRELAND : SINN FEIN LEADER LIKELY TO SPEAK TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND BE ALLOWED TO VISIT SEVERAL CITIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nationalist leader Gerry Adams said Friday that he will apply for a visa to revisit the United States and hopes to arrive before the end of the month . He is expected to be invited to address members of Congress to explain developments in the Northern_Ireland peace process following the historic cease-fire declared last week by the outlawed Irish_Republican_Army . President Clinton is expected to approve the visa for Adams on the grounds that the cease-fire was declared and is holding , despite the refusal by loyalist paramilitary groups to announce a similar truce in the 25-year-long conflict . The visa application will be opposed by the_British government , which also objected to Adams being granted entry last February . But the Clinton_Administration overruled the objections ; Adams , president of Sinn Fein , the political wing of the IRA , spent 48 hours in New York City in a media blitz , presenting his version of the cause of Irish unity . This time , Adams is expected to seek , and get , a less restrictive visa that will allow him to travel_to New York , Washington , Chicago , Boston -- and perhaps San Francisco and Los Angeles . But militant Protestant leader the Rev . Ian Paisley , a member of the_British Parliament , warned that U.S. &quot; interference &quot; in the affairs of Northern_Ireland could bring closer &quot; the time for civil_war &quot; in the troubled province . Paisley made his comments after meeting the U.S. consul general here . He argued against issuing a visa and said any visit by Clinton to the province -- although none has been suggested -- would provoke widespread protest by Protestant unionists , who want continued British rule_in Northern_Ireland . But another leading unionist member_of_Parliament , John Taylor , said Friday that he thinks the IRA campaign of violence is effectively over . &quot; My gut reaction is that this cease-fire is for real , &quot; said Taylor , a member of the moderate Ulster Unionist Party . The upbeat remarks by Taylor , who was shot several times by an IRA gunman in 1972 , were thought to lift some of the unionist pressure on the Clinton_Administration to deny Adams a visa . Earlier Friday , the primate of the Protestant_Church of Ireland , Dr. Robin Eames , pleaded with the loyalists to call a halt to violence -- and heed British Prime_Minister John Major ' s personal assurance to him that there had been no secret deal negotiated between London and the IRA . The senior cleric warned the Protestant paramilitaries , &quot; If the perception on the part of many Protestants that the current peace process is somehow confined to the nationalist or Republican community is allowed to grow , it will place a dangerous imbalance on the possibilities of long-term peace . &quot; Rarely has sensitivity to each other ' s feelings been more important than at this time , &quot; he added . Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds , who signed a declaration with Major last December opening the way for all-party peace talks on Northern_Ireland , also urged the loyalists to end their violence . &quot; Take your time in making_up your minds , &quot; he said . &quot; You are entitled to time , the same as others were entitled to time , but at the end of the day we want to see you participate in and contribute to the creation of a permanent and enduring peace on the island of Ireland. &quot;</TEXT>
