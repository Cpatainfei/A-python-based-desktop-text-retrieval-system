   <TEXT> Kim Philby -- spy , traitor , philanderer , drunk -- died in 1988 at an exclusive clinic in Moscow , his home for a quarter century . For services rendered , the Soviet state provided a lavish , limited-admission funeral at the extremely exclusive KGB Club . There the spy agency ' s top officers delivered secret eulogies on the murky career of their English friend and ideological trophy . Afterward , the open casket was hauled to the even more exclusive Kuntsevo Cemetery , where Philby ' s fourth wife gave him a final tender kiss . Before the coffin was sealed , some in the graveside crowd claimed to see a faint , enigmatic smile on the lips of the well-tended corpse . Whether real or sculpted by a subtle mortician , the expression was as ambiguous as Philby ' s life . As &quot; the spy of the century , &quot; Philby was a genius at eluding sharp focus . Thanks partly to his great personal charm , he was able to sugarcoat his treason even after his damning flight from the West to the Soviet_Union in 1963 . And thanks partly to his knack for self-promotion and propaganda , Philby became one of the Cold_War ' s superstars -- without ever revealing very much about himself . The affable , deceitful man with a large whiskey capacity has intrigued journalists , playwrights , novelists and filmmakers , all_of whom have found eager audiences for their interpretations of Philby ' s shadow world . Indeed , his extraordinary double career with Great Britain ' s Secret Intelligence Service and an alphabet soup of Soviet espionage agencies made him a sort of George_Washington of spies . His house in Istanbul , where he was posted in the late 1940s , became a tourist attraction . Other haunts , such_as his favorite bar in Beirut , also acquired luster from their association with Philby . Since Philby ' s death , of course , the world has been turned upside down , as two new books on his life demonstrate . Both Anthony Cave Brown ' s &quot; Treason in the Blood &quot; and Genrikh Borovik and Phillip Knightley ' s &quot; The Philby Files &quot; owe much to the opening of Cold_War sources , including chunks of Philby ' s official KGB file and his personal papers . Although there probably never will be a final word on Philby simply because of the clandestine nature of espionage , the two volumes throw new light on vast stretches of his bizarre and puzzling life . Cave Brown ' s fascinating father-son biography is the most thorough account likely to be written_on Kim Philby and his exceedingly odd family roots . A major thesis of &quot; Treason in the Blood &quot; is that St . John Philby ' s example influenced his son ' s betrayal of Great Britain . As the tale unfolds , the lives of father and son take_on an eerie , fun house-mirror quality that makes you wonder if treason could be an inherited trait . The elder Philby was a strange duck , an anti-imperialist who railed and schemed against the_British Empire while he craved recognition from it . He became famous for his exploits during and after World_War I , including exploration of the desolate Empty Quarter of the Arabian_peninsula , but resigned from government service under a cloud shortly after the war . He was held_in detention later , during World_War_II , because of suspect loyalties . St . John Philby played a major role in the politics of Middle Eastern oil , ensuring that the vast Saudi oil fields would be developed by America rather than Britain . As an adviser to Saudi_Arabia ' s King Ibn Saud , he converted to the Muslim faith and fathered a second family -- without ever divorcing Kim ' s mother . He seldom saw his English family but tried to direct it via the remote_control of his voluminous letters . In the case of Kim , he succeeded , perhaps beyond his most fevered wishes . Sired and perhaps inspired by a compulsive iconoclast , Kim Philby claimed that he began to doubt the existence of God while still in kindergarten . He also boasted that he had become &quot; a godless little anti-imperialist before I reached my teens. &quot; ( This from a person thought to have been one of the models for A . A . Milne ' s Christopher Robin. ) As Cave Brown portrays them , Kim and his father , St . John , lived_on the fringe of history . Both were behind-the-scenes types , albeit not always by_choice . Both influenced world events in profound ways . Both chose to serve foreign masters who used them even while they distrusted them . Both were deeply alienated from their native country , yet each epitomized a certain kind of Englishness . Both went_to the right schools , knew all_the right people and had the intelligence and capacity for work to make the best of both . The father-son symbiosis also may have gone_deeper than mere example . According to Cave Brown , the possibility exists that the senior Philby played a role in his son ' s recruitment to the Soviet cause . He bases this conjecture on testimony that the Soviet government regarded the father as &quot; an asset &quot; and that a KGB file on St . John Philby had been placed inside his son ' s file -- then later removed . Yet one wonders ; both of these books present persuasive evidence that one of Kim ' s first jobs for the Soviets was to spy on_his_own father . Not surprisingly , friends sometimes thought both Philbys mad . In Kim , the signs of instability were less overt than in his father . Nonetheless one colleague eventually concluded that the son was &quot; a schizophrenic with a supreme talent for deception. &quot; Whatever his mental condition , Philby was superb at what he did . He began working for the Soviets in 1934 at age 22 and apparently served them faithfully and well for more_than half a century . He helped recruit fellow leftist friends from Cambridge_University into Communist service , most notably Donald MacLean , Guy Burgess and Anthony Blount . He provided the Soviets with mountains of high-quality information on military and diplomatic matters during the Spanish Civil War , World_War_II and the early years of the Cold_War . He also betrayed anti-Communist agents and sent many to certain death . At the same time he fashioned successful careers in journalism and in British intelligence . Despite his fabulous luck and skill , Philby ' s world began to come_apart in the early 1950s , when Burgess and MacLean fled behind the Iron_Curtain , throwing suspicion on Philby as &quot; the third man &quot; who had made the escape possible . Still Philby managed to hold_on for 12 years before fleeing himself . In that time he was more or less constantly suspected of dark deeds but investigators could pin nothing on their slippery target . Simultaneously , Philby was bedeviled by the collapse of his second marriage and the need to earn a living . Aileen Philby was in and out of mental_institutions ( she cut herself with scissors and sometimes injected herself with her own urine ) , but it is almost inconceivable that she knew_nothing of his double life . Philby apparently was never sure whether she would rat on him . At one point , Cave Brown reports , Philby ' s domestic situation required him to sleep_in a tent pitched on the yard of his home . Ultimately and astonishingly , he was rehired by the_British secret_service and sent to Beirut under journalistic cover . Cave Brown covers all this and more with a wonderful feel_for the absurdities of British and American spy mania in the 1950s and early ' 60s . In a delicious tidbit among many , reports that British P . M . Harold Macmillan despaired that the security scandals would never end . At the close of one particularly bad day , Macmillan wrote in his diary that yet another British agent had been arrested , this time for &quot; wandering around the loos in the park , passing things , probably opium or something. &quot; Despite Cave Brown ' s best efforts , questions remain about Philby ' s flight from Beirut aboard a Soviet freighter in 1963 . Was Philby planted in Moscow by the_British and Americans or was he a genuine defector ? Cave Brown concludes that &quot; we shall not know , for the Philby case was one in which the secret_services of all three countries involved -- Britain , the Soviet_Union , and the United States -- found it necessary to keep silent . No individual told the whole truth about what lay behind the affair , least of all Philby. &quot; Cave Brown also concedes that the truth behind the celebrated relationship between Philby and the CIA ' s James Jesus Angleton remains beyond grasp . Did Angleton , the counterintelligence guru of the American agency , hoodwink Philby or did Philby checkmate Angleton ? Apparently no one knows the answer . But Cave Brown presents evidence based on &quot; private information &quot; that two CIA executives who distrusted Angleton met untimely deaths , which leaves open the possibility that Angleton and Philby were in cahoots . After the feast of &quot; Treason in the Blood , &quot; Borovik and Knightley ' s book seems like small potatoes . The impression is deceptive . Borovik , a Moscow writer and TV personality , was given access to one volume of Philby ' s KGB files ( the KGB had suppressed a novel of his ; this access , he claims , was his pay-back ) . The files primarily covered Philby ' s first years as a spy for the Soviets . He also had access to Philby and conducted extensive interviews with him in the years shortly before his death . Knightley , a well-known British journalist and author of a Philby biography , edited Borovik ' s manuscript and wrote an introduction . The result is an awkward book that nonetheless contains a great_deal of insight into the nuts_and_bolts of Philby ' s secret life . Among other things , Borovik reports that Philby and other English spies were deeply distrusted by the KGB , which suspected all were double_agents . He also reports that , unlike recently exposed CIA turncoat Alrich Ames , the_British spies were reluctant to take money for their work . The reasons for refusal were both practical and idealistic . They believed_in their cause and none wanted the suspicion extra cash bestows . Interestingly , Borovik was able to compare Philby ' s words with his files . Not surprisingly , Philby lied to him or was less than forthcoming on occasion , including about his little-known involvement in a plot to kill Spain ' s General Francisco Franco . Both books provide fascinating detail on Philby ' s last_days , an indicator of the kind of information that is now accessible in Russia . Cave Brown notes that doctors searched high and low for a special Uzbeki wine believed helpful in treating his heart_condition ( they got_it from the Archimandrite of Moscow ; it seemed to help for a bit ) . And Borovik writes that in the month before his death , Philby ' s chronic insomnia had recurred with a vengeance . So in the end , Philby could not sleep until he slept forever . What was it , one wonders , that kept him awake ?</TEXT>
