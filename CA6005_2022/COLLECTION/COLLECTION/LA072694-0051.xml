   <HEADLINE> IRA WATCH ; RETURN OF THE TROUBLES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sinn Fein , a Northern_Ireland political_party allied_with the terrorist Irish_Republican_Army , on Sunday formally rejected a joint British-Irish declaration that many had seen as the best hope in years for peace in that strife-ridden region . By the December &quot; Downing Street Declaration , &quot; Ireland agreed that the majority would rule on the political status of Northern Ireland.The United Kingdom agreed that if and when the majority chose union with Ireland , the United Kingdom would not stand_in the way . The mostly Protestant unionist population constitutes a clear majority at the moment . Some decades from now the gradually growing , mostly Catholic , Irish nationalist population could become a majority . All this was just talk , of course , unless the inflamed parties on both sides could see fit to accept this vision of a peaceful , politically open-ended future . Sadly , even the remote prospect of Irish rule brought an immediate escalation in unionist terrorism . More sadly still , the hope that Sinn Fein ' s Gerry Adams could bring his party and the terrorist Irish_Republican_Army to renounce violence and join multilateral ( British , Irish , unionist , nationalist ) talks has now been utterly shattered . What next ? The hour of Sinn Fein and above all_of Gerry Adams would seem to have definitively passed . The path to peace that might have led through Sinn Fein must now lead around it . Adams and his party have , in a strange way , their worst enemies for allies : Only the terrorists on either side want the bloodshed that lies ahead .</TEXT>
