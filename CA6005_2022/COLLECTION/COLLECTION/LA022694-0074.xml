   <HEADLINE> HAITI ARMY SENSES VICTORY IN U.S.-ARISTIDE SPLIT ; CARIBBEAN : ' THEY ARE SURVIVING THE EMBARGO AND THEY ARE LAUGHING , ' A DIPLOMAT SAYS OF THE MILITARY . GAS FLOWS INTO THE COUNTRY DESPITE BAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The open and bitter conflict between the Clinton_Administration and Jean-Bertrand Aristide has left the military here confident that it has defeated conclusively all attempts to restore the exiled Haitian president to power , according to diplomats and Haitian political experts . &quot; They have control of the country , &quot; one diplomat said of the military , &quot; and they have no reason to change . They are surviving the embargo and they are laughing . They just don ' t feel the pressure. &quot; The growing U.S.-Aristide dispute , which reached a public breaking_point this week , has accompanied a virtual flood of gasoline into Haiti in defiance of a worldwide petroleum embargo designed to crush resistance to Aristide ' s restoration . So_much fuel has come_over the border from neighboring Dominican_Republic in the last week that the black_market price for gasoline and diesel_fuel dropped nearly $ 3 a gallon in two days from a high of nearly $ 9 . &quot; that ' s still a very high price , and it ' s not enough to restore things to normal , &quot; a Haitian businessman said , &quot; but it is certainly enough for the military to keep control. &quot; But the sources said the military victory is even more strongly perceived in the angry impasse between Aristide and the United States over a plan proposed by anti-Aristide legislators and endorsed by the Administration . &quot; They ( the military ) have won , &quot; the diplomat said . The plan calls_for Aristide to name a prime_minister and Cabinet acceptable to his domestic foes and to pardon the army_officers who engineered his 1991 overthrow before he would be allowed to return to Haiti . While Aristide rejected that sequence on grounds that it rewarded the people who deposed him and would undercut his ability to govern , he was most offended because the proposal made no mention of a date or timetable for his restoration . Aristide , a fiery Roman_Catholic priest who won an overwhelming election victory on a radically populist platform in 1990 , had demanded that the military step aside before he would name a new government . He also demanded that he return 10 days after the agreement was finalized . It is not just Washington ' s endorsement of the proposal drafted by some of Aristide ' s strongest opponents that has disheartened Aristide supporters here . &quot; That was bad enough , &quot; said one international official connected to the diplomatic effort to restore democracy , &quot; but what Christopher said all but killed any chance of pressuring the military to give in. &quot; He was referring to a position taken by U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher earlier this week to prevent the extension of the economic boycott imposed on Haiti last October when the army reneged , for at least the second time , on an accord to bring Aristide home . Christopher told a congressional committee Wednesday that any strengthening of the embargo , now limited to petroleum products and arms , would depend_on Aristide ' s acceptance of the legislators ' plan . Aristide dismissed the plan again Thursday as unworthy_of consideration . &quot; What signal do you think that sent to the military ? &quot; asked another international official , who added that Christopher acted without informing or even consulting other nations involved in_forcing the military to give_way . &quot; Everything is in a state of confusion , &quot; said another diplomat from that group , known as the &quot; Four Friends of Haiti &quot; -- the United States , Canada , Venezuela and France . Not only is there confusion among diplomats who thought_of themselves as allies ; sources say U.S. policy seems to have lost focus and purpose , an assessment echoed by a prominent businessman who recently met in Washington with Aristide and key State_Department officials . He reported that the situation is so bad that Aristide has cut_off all direct contact with U.S. officials , who are reduced to asking those who have visited Aristide privately what the Haitian leader thinks . &quot; At this stage , &quot; another Haitian expert said , &quot; the Administration seems to have lost all perspective &quot; because of its anger over what U.S. officials see as Aristide ' s stubborn and unrealistic refusal to compromise . &quot; In one sense , &quot; said a diplomat here , &quot; I understand the State_Department ' s position . It is clear that Aristide is part of the problem , and that he either doesn ' t understand that the military ( and his civilian opponents ) are here to stay and he needs to negotiate with them , or he really doesn ' t want to return . &quot; However , I have to agree in part_with Aristide ; what reason has he to trust the Americans ? &quot; The diplomat gave as an example of Washington ' s wavering the American refusal to extend the embargo in spite of a U.S.-supported U.N. Security_Council resolution that called_for an inclusive economic and commercial boycott if the military had not stepped_down by last Jan . 15 . &quot; And for high officials to publicly criticize Aristide , that surely didn ' t help , &quot; the diplomat said . Signs of the military ' s confidence are plentiful . Human_rights officials say murderous repression by the army and its allies has increased openly in spite of the return of international monitors . &quot; It is going_on to show the country they will punish anyone who opposes them and that the international community can ' t do anything to stop them , &quot; said a foreign official based here . The sense of victory also has ended speculation that there was a meaningful split within the military or that army commander Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras had planned to name himself as head of the government . Some figures who said they spoke_for Cedras ' perceived rival , Port-au-Prince Police_Chief Michel-Joseph Francois , and had begun charging that Cedras was planning a takeover suddenly changed their assessments Friday . Local radio_stations reported , for instance , that Senate President Bernard Sansaricq , who had called_for Cedras to resign and let Parliament name a new president , had recanted and was no longer charging the general with planning a new coup . Several sources said there never was a split . &quot; There may be differences_of_opinion over tactics , &quot; said one Haitian political expert with close ties to the military , &quot; but they are unified on the main goal : Keep Aristide out. &quot; For the moment , observers say , that goal has been reached . &quot; We have to come_up with something new , &quot; one of the diplomats said , &quot; but with the army convinced we ( the international community ) are either supporting them in secret or are foolish weaklings and Aristide refusing to compromise or accept reality , I don ' t see any way out. &quot;</TEXT>
