   <HEADLINE> RICHARD NIXON : 1913-1994 ; GUEST LIST COVERED WIDE SPECTRUM ; AUDIENCE : LONGTIME ALLIES , A FEW EX-ENEMIES AND REPRESENTATIVES FROM 86 NATIONS ATTENDED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Not all_the President ' s men were there , but enough to make a strong showing . Former Cabinet members Henry A . Kissinger and Richard G . Kleindienst were in_attendance . So were Watergate figures Maurice Stans , once finance chairman for Nixon ' s re-election committee , and G . Gordon Liddy , the convicted mastermind of the bungled burglary . Former Nixon spokesman Ron Ziegler and Counsel Chuck Colson also paid their respects . Jo Horton Haldeman , the widow of Nixon ' s chief_of_staff , H . R . Haldeman , was in the audience . And so was Rose Mary Woods , the secretary who took responsibility for creating the infamous 18 1 / 2-minute gap on a critical Watergate tape . But so was George McGovern , who was among the first_named on Nixon ' s infamous &quot; enemies list , &quot; and whose presence on the funeral ' s exclusive guest list spoke more eloquently of reconciliation than some who eulogized the 37th President . &quot; This has been a reconciling day for me and , I think , for a lot of other people , &quot; said McGovern , who as the Democratic nominee waged an acrimonious political fight against Nixon for the presidency in 1972 and was buried in a electoral landslide . &quot; I kind of really feel_like I ' ve lost an old friend , even though we were bitter political enemies through the years. &quot; Colson , who spent seven months in prison for obstructing justice during the Watergate conspiracy , also spoke_of healing . &quot; I think he achieved in death something he never quite achieved in life -- to bring the nation together , &quot; said Colson . &quot; Maybe the wounds of Watergate are now , twenty-some years later , finally healed. &quot; The guest list for the funeral cut_across a broad spectrum of Nixon ' s political and private life : Republicans and Democrats , friends and former enemies , family members , entertainers , sports figures , religious_leaders and many , many longtime staffers . At the Yorba Linda Community_Center , where many of the guests had gathered before the funeral , the Nixon faithful -- wearing either purple or yellow &quot; RN &quot; badges that were their tickets to the funeral -- embraced like long-lost friends . Liddy and Howard H . Baker Jr. , the former Tennessee senator and ranking minority member of the Judiciary Committee that held televised hearings on Watergate , rode over to the funeral site together on a shuttle . Robert H . Finch , who served under Nixon as secretary of health , education and welfare , smiled and shook hands with Donald H . Rumsfeld , the secretary_of_defense under President Gerald R . Ford . &quot; I think the Nixon family can feel very , very good about what he accomplished , and who all is here , &quot; Rumsfeld said . &quot; A broad cross-section of the world is recognizing him for what he did. &quot; From across the Nixon years came Alexander M . Haig Jr. , Haldeman ' s replacement as chief_of_staff , and Caspar W . Weinberger , former secretary of health , education and welfare who became Ronald Reagan ' s defense_secretary . James R . Schlesinger , Nixon ' s defense_secretary , and William P . Rogers , his secretary_of_state , joined a_few dozen others from the Nixon presidency , including political columnist and presidential aspirant Patrick J . Buchanan , security adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Atty . Gen . Elliot L . Richardson . Even former Vice_President Spiro T . Agnew , who before Nixon ' s resignation left_office himself in disgrace under a criminal indictment , and his wife , Judy , attended the funeral . Agnew had asked Julie Nixon Eisenhower if he would be welcome at the funeral and was assured that his presence was important . On Wednesday , he was greeted warmly . &quot; I ' m here to pay my respects for ( Nixon ' s ) accomplishments , &quot; said Nixon ' s vice_president , who resigned in 1973 after pleading no contest to tax_evasion . &quot; It ' s time to put aside 20 years of resentment , which is what I ' m doing at this moment. &quot; More_than 100 members of Congress were_on the guest list , including 47 U.S. senators , House Speaker Thomas Foley ( D-Wash. ) , Senate Democratic Leader George Mitchell of Maine and the California congressional delegation . Representatives from across the globe , from Angola to Argentina and Singapore to Seychelles , also were in_force . In all , 86 countries sent dignitaries to pay respects . But Nixon had other admirers , too , who had little if anything to do with politics . Comedians Bob Hope and Red Skelton and actor Buddy Ebsen attended with their wives . Former Rams star Roosevelt Grier also attended . &quot; It was a good send-off to Richard Nixon and his future life , &quot; said Ebsen , who also attended Pat Nixon ' s funeral last summer . &quot; There was a feeling of togetherness . It stepped across party_lines and it was a beautiful happening . We need that to get all_of us together. &quot; Said Hope : &quot; He was a hell of a guy . Playing golf , you learn a lot about a guy ' s character . His was a great character. &quot; The guest list was indeed impressive , with names like Walter Annenberg , George Argyros , Jesse Helms , William Lyon , Ashraf Pahlavi , Bebe Rebozo , Nelson Rockefeller , Henry Segerstrom , Mary Roosevelt and James B . Stockdale sprinkled throughout . Orange County also had a large contingent , including a gathering of state_senators and assemblymen . All five Orange County supervisors were also invited . The local Republican Central Committee distributed 100 tickets to elected officials , volunteers and others affiliated with the local party , chairman Thomas A . Fuentes said , and just about everyone who wanted in got_in . &quot; It was dignified , sentimental and memorable , &quot; Supervisor Harriett M . Wieder said . &quot; I think it was Kissinger who said that when you look_at the quality of a person and whether they lived well , you look_at the entirety of the life . that ' s how I remember Richard Nixon. &quot; Mourners spoke about healing and the inevitability that Nixon , in death , may finally have been absolved of his perceived sins . Former Vice_President Dan Quayle joked that Kissinger had captured it perfectly when he predicted that Nixon &quot; would ' ve liked to have read and reread all_the favorable reviews that he ' s had this last week. &quot; The Rev . Robert Schuller said he was pleased to see those reviews . &quot; I ' m very grateful to God for the respect that ' s been shown ( Nixon ) this last week , &quot; said Schuller . &quot; Society does not forgive . People tend to hold_on to their hurts. &quot; But since Nixon ' s death , Schuller said , the public is beginning to &quot; recognize Nixon ' s greatness. &quot; Times staff writers Alicia DiRado , Doreen Carvajal and Eric Lichtblau contributed to this report .
