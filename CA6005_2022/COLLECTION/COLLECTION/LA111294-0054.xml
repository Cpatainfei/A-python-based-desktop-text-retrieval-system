   <TEXT> Re &quot; Arafat Jostled by Mourners of Slain Activist &quot; ( Nov . 4 ) : Now the leader of the PLO himself is sharing with Israel the taste of Arab terrorism . Freih abu Madeen , the Palestinian Authority ' s minister of justice , accuses Israel of assassinating Hani Abed , a known member of the terrorist Islamic Jihad organization . But there is absolutely no proof , or even evidence , that Israel is responsible . Madeen is quoted , &quot; This is their style , &quot; in accusing Israel of the assassination , and he implies that only Israel has the means and the motive to commit such an act . But this claim flies in the face of 40 years of Arab terrorist actions . We in the U.S. have the New York World Trade Center bombing as proof of their abilities . This killing is another obstruction to the peace process and is not in Israel ' s interests . Arab terrorists opposed to peace with Israel have purposely committed many similar acts in the past , just to blame Israel and keep the flames against peace burning . IRVING E . FRIEDMAN Laguna Niguel * * Re &quot; Treaty Places Another Piece in the Mideast Puzzle , &quot; Oct . 27 : I have written innumerable times about the one-sided reporting of The Times regarding Israel . In your graphic &quot; Redrawing the Borders in War and Peace , &quot; the first illustration shows Israel as it was in 1949 and the text reads &quot; The borders of Israel after it declared independence and fought first war with Arab neighbors. &quot; Actually , my recollection is that the United Nations declared the State of Israel in 1948 , not 1949 , and that upon the declaration of the State of Israel its Arab neighbors attacked the small state . Why for heaven ' s sake don ' t you put_down the facts ? In the 1967 map you forgot to state that Syria attacked Israel , as did Jordan . Every time you mentioned that Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan you never mentioned the fact that Jordan captured East Jerusalem from Palestine ; it never belonged_to Jordan , check your facts . Again , in reporting of the terrible , tragic terrorist attack on a bus in the center of Tel Aviv , you actually almost glorified the Hamas who attacked only defenseless people . You also failed to explain to the public what the aim of the Hamas group is , which they have declared thousands of times and that is the destruction of Israel and setting_up Palestine as a fundamentalist Iran-type state . ARTHUR GILBERT Beverly Hills * * Every peace-minded person abhors terrorism . The recent bus bombing in Tel Aviv is no exception , but the Israelis will retaliate by blowing_up the &quot; suspected &quot; bomber ' s home ( Oct . 21 ) , and this is not considered terrorism . The U.S. gives Israel over $ 4 billion a year to perpetuate this kind of rationale . WILLIAM MATHEWS Redondo Beach * * I believe it is about time for the Israeli commandos to go_back_on duty ! They did a terrific job at Entebbe several years ago when they freed captives . Yitzhak Rabin , Shimon Peres , Ezer Weizman , et al . should reactivate the commandos in Israel and put them to work against Hamas . Yasser Arafat either does not feel_like acting against Hamas , or maybe his hands are tied by his own party . His &quot; apologies and condolences &quot; don ' t mean a thing , unless he acts_on behalf of humanity and stops this senseless slaughter of human_beings .
