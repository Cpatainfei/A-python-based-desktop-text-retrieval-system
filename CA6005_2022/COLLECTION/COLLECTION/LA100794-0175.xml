   <HEADLINE> LOVE OF BEETHOVEN INSPIRES A SHARING OF CULTURES ; MUSIC : ABOUT 1 # 000 JAPANESE AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIANS WILL UNITE TO PRESENT THE NINTH SYMPHONY AT THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When he made his Hollywood Bowl choral debut in the ' 70s , singer Stephen Gothold was pretty impressed with the sound of 120 voices participating in Beethoven ' s Ninth Symphony . It was , however , no big deal compared with his Japanese choral debut in February singing the same piece at Tokyo ' s National Sports Arena . There , his was one of 5 # 200 voices for Beethoven ' s Ninth . Now comes what many people are hoping will be Gothold ' s best Beethoven ' s Ninth experience yet : the sound of 950 voices , from Japan as well as Southern California , filling the Hollywood Bowl . Now director of choral activities at Whittier College and founding conductor of Chorale Bel_Canto , Gothold will lead his choirs and others in the joyous symphony on Saturday . In the Western world , Beethoven ' s Ninth is the stuff of church_services , weddings and symphony halls . ( In the 1965 Beatles film &quot; Help ! , &quot; its &quot; Ode to Joy &quot; was also the only thing that could placate the man-eating Bengal tiger. ) But , according to Asahi Homecast Corp. , a Pasadena-based Japanese-language radio and TV programmer that is organizing and promoting the Bowl concert , in Japan , Beethoven ' s 1824 masterpiece is nothing short of &quot; Jingle Bells &quot; in terms of its popularity . Japanese contemporary culture is not limited to Kabuki theater , Asahi president Mayumi Shirai told a press_conference here recently . &quot; There are thousands and thousands of people in communities from Hokkaido ( in northern Japan ) to Okinawa ( in southern Japan ) singing Beethoven in German , &quot; she said . &quot; This is the way they receive and welcome the new year. &quot; Conductor Hiroshi Ishimaru , who has led similar &quot; Daiku &quot; concerts in Sumida City outside Tokyo for a decade , will conduct the Japan America Symphony_Orchestra and the Los Angeles Chamber_Orchestra at the Bowl . In addition to 250 Japanese singers , who are paying their own way here from Tokyo , several Los Angeles and Orange County choruses are participating . The choruses include the Chorale Bel_Canto , Cypress Masterworks Chorale , Gay_Men ' s Chorus of Los Angeles , Saddleback Master Chorale , Saint_Peter ' s by the Sea Presbyterian_Church Sanctuary Choir , Whittier College Choir and Korean Master Chorale . Most of the choruses have performed the Beethoven elsewhere , Gothold says , but few in so major a venue as the Bowl . While Gothold began weekly rehearsals for about 140 people last month , the Japanese contingent didn ' t arrive until Tuesday , just a_few days before the Bowl concert . Then again , the Sumida City singers couldn ' t be_better rehearsed . Young or old , professionals or amateurs , many of them have been performing the work annually in Japan for a decade . * According to Japan America ' s music_director Heiichiro Ohyama , conductor Ishimaru began annual concerts in Sumida City 10 years ago to expand the audience for classical_music . &quot; Hiroshi Ishimaru felt classical_music should belong_to everyone , &quot; says Ohyama , &quot; not just the elite but the common_man also. &quot; Gothold had a chance to see that first-hand in February when he assembled an American contingent of 30 singers , including himself , for the Sumida City annual show . &quot; I felt it would be slow and cumbersome , &quot; says Gothold , &quot; and couldn ' t possibly be any good . But it was wonderful , very spirited Beethoven. &quot; that ' s what they ' re hoping for at the Hollywood Bowl , of course . The Bowl is a familiar Los Angeles landmark for the Japanese , and conductor Ishimaru is quoted in a press_release saying that &quot; as a child , I used to dream of the opportunity to conduct at the Hollywood Bowl. &quot; &quot; Daiku &quot; translates literally as &quot; number nine , &quot; and conductor Ohyama says the fact that it refers to the popular Beethoven Ninth , &quot; is understood. &quot; ( In keeping with that theme , Ohyama will also lead the orchestras in Dvorak ' s Ninth Symphony in E Minor , &quot; From the New World , &quot; also popular_with and familiar to Japanese concert-goers. ) Shirai hopes this will be the first of many annual &quot; Daiku &quot; concerts , she says , forecasting ever-increasing participation by more and more singers . &quot; We hope this 1 # 000 will be 1 # 500 , 5 # 000 and 10 # 000 in future years , &quot; says Shirai . &quot; We ' d like to see people from all_over the world come_to Los Angeles for this. &quot; * &quot; Daiku &quot; concert tickets are available from $ 3 to $ 100 for Saturday ' s performance at 8 p.m. at the Hollywood Bowl . Tickets can be purchased by calling Ticketmaster at ( 213 ) 480-3232 . Corporate box_seats are $ 250 each , including dinner and parking , and may be purchased through Asahi directly at ( 818 ) 449-0018 .</TEXT>
