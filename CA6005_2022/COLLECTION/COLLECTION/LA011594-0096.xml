   <TEXT> President Clinton and Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin concluded their two-day Moscow summit with a blizzard of new agreements on economic and security issues Friday , cementing what aides described as a new , more realistic relationship between the United States and Russia . In solemn Kremlin ceremonies , the two leaders , joined by Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk , signed an accord to remove all nuclear_weapons from Ukraine and agreed to stop aiming long-range missiles at any of the world ' s countries . And Washington and Moscow reached agreement on a series of steps designed to help Russia continue its progress toward a free-market economy while cushioning the impact of change on ordinary citizens . Yeltsin , in the only significant public disagreement with Clinton in two days of determinedly positive exchanges , sharply rejected the admission of East European_countries to the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization -- unless Russia joins at_the_same_time . Indeed , Yeltsin deftly turned his endorsement of Clinton ' s &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; into a formula for forestalling NATO membership for individual countries such_as Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic . The beauty of the American_plan , he said , was that it provides_for taking none of the European states into the alliance until they are admitted en masse , he said . That is not the way Washington sees the partnership at all , but Clinton and other Administration officials let Yeltsin ' s assertion pass without direct challenge . Who joins NATO and when is a question to be answered down the road , they made clear ; what matters now are concrete steps to deal with the problems immediately at_hand . The outcome , Russian and American officials said , reflected a significant evolution in the relationship , a step beyond both the terrors of the Cold_War and the starry-eyed illusions of the first years of peace . &quot; Before , we had the romantic phase , &quot; said Russian scholar Alexander Konovalev , an expert on East-West relations . &quot; Now this is becoming a normal working relationship between two countries. &quot; The stakes are still high . The United States desperately wants Yeltsin ' s economic and political reforms to succeed , U.S. officials note , because behind the Russian president stands the threat of aggressive nationalism in the form of neo-fascist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky . But the negotiations are much easier now . &quot; When we were adversaries , we had to negotiate every understanding line by line , &quot; said a senior U.S. diplomat with long experience in Moscow . &quot; Clinton and Yeltsin are willing to give each other the benefit of the doubt. &quot; Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov called the meeting &quot; the most substantive , businesslike and concrete &quot; of any he had attended . Clinton agreed to meet with Yeltsin again in July , when the two will attend the annual economic summit of big industrial powers in Naples , Italy . And he invited Yeltsin to make a state visit to Washington this fall , making three meetings in the span of one year . &quot; We ' re doing a lot of business , &quot; a senior U.S. official said . That was confirmed by the long list of agreements finalized in a flurry of signing ceremonies . They included : * A new joint effort to prevent the spread of nuclear_weapons . Clinton and Yeltsin pledged to take &quot; energetic measures &quot; to block the spread of nuclear_weapons , and they called_on North_Korea to comply with international demands to open its nuclear facilities for inspection . * Common concerns on human_rights . The leaders issued a statement saying &quot; aggressive nationalism and political extremism are the main threat to peace and democracy &quot; and pledged to combat human_rights violations , including anti-Semitism and xenophobia . * A $ 100-million investment fund to help turn large Russian state firms into private enterprises . Clinton appointed Michael Blumenthal , former Treasury_secretary in the Jimmy_Carter Administration , to chair the so-called Fund for Large Enterprises in Russia . Also , the Overseas Private Investment Corp . announced three protocols supporting U.S. private investment projects in Russia , including plans to modernize telecommunications_systems , restart idle oil_wells and boost crude_oil production . Clinton and Yeltsin discussed at length a social_welfare system that would help Russians make the transition to a free market system with less pain . &quot; I made_it perfectly clear to the President that we would expand the scope of reforms , focusing more on the social dimension , &quot; Yeltsin said . &quot; I am confident that this country will have greater stability and durable social peace. &quot; Even when the leaders disagreed , it reflected the overall improvement of their relationship , Russian and American officials said : The two countries can now argue candidly over individual issues without threatening each other with dire consequences . Yeltsin was characteristically blunt at the summit ' s final news_conference when asked whether he agrees with Clinton ' s policy of holding_out possible NATO membership to some former Soviet Bloc countries in Eastern Europe . &quot; Admitting us one by one is no good , &quot; Yeltsin said . &quot; I am against that. &quot; He said NATO should invite Russia and all other East European_countries to join the alliance at_the_same_time -- an approach NATO leaders rejected at their summit_meeting in Brussels this week . U.S. officials shrugged_off the dispute , saying it would not get_in the way of other dealings with Russia . The President made a determined public show of support for his Russian &quot; partner , &quot; as he repeatedly dubbed Yeltsin , talking up his reforms and expressing respect for Russia ' s greatness both in official public meetings and in events designed to reach_out to average Russians . He paid his respects_to the war dead at the Tomb of the Unknown_Soldier , attended a formal Kremlin dinner and accepted an invitation from Yeltsin to stay overnight in a guest apartment inside one of the Kremlin palaces . And he led Russia ' s first live TV &quot; town_hall , &quot; modeled on the campaign events that became Clinton ' s political trademark . Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea arrived in a snowstorm to join the President on Friday . Clinton visited the Tomb of the Unknown_Soldier at 8 a.m. , looking still tired from the previous night ' s three-hour dinner at Yeltsin ' s dacha . Clinton and a party that included Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher and Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev followed three goose-stepping soldiers , who carried a wreath to the black-and-red granite tomb , which is next to the Kremlin wall . Clinton stood with bowed head before the memorial , which contains the remains of soldiers who died in what Russians call &quot; the Great Fatherland War &quot; of 1941 to 1945 . It is inscribed : &quot; Your name is unknown but your deed is eternal. &quot; Such visits are part of the standard rituals of summitry , but this visit carried an added message to the Russian people , the White_House hopes : Clinton respects both the enormous suffering that has marked their history and the greatness of their role in the world . Both presidents hailed their agreements on nuclear weaponry as a significant step toward security from nuclear attack . Most important , they said , was the three-nation agreement to remove nuclear_weapons from Ukraine . Whether Kravchuk can keep his end of the bargain remains in doubt . Kravchuk has agreed to remove the weapons several times since 1992 , only to run_into stiff resistance from Ukraine ' s Parliament , the Rada . This week , after the new agreement was announced , some leading members of the Rada denounced it , and almost all said the Parliament would insist on debating the pact . Under the agreement on missile targeting , Russia and the United States will alter the guidance data for their long-range missiles so that by May 30 the weapons are not trained on any country . Most U.S. missiles will simply be left without target data , but the aging Minuteman III system , which requires targeting , will be aimed at remote areas in the Atlantic and Pacific_oceans , officials said . Unlike most arms control agreements , this one does not include any procedure for verifying that it has been carried_out -- because that would be virtually impossible , officials said . And , they noted , either side could restore targeting data to its missiles in a matter of minutes . But the agreement is not merely symbolic , they said . Removing the targeting data from long-range missiles means that in the event of an accidental launch of Russian missiles , New York , Washington and Los Angeles would no longer be among the likely landing points . In their human_rights declaration , the two presidents denounced &quot; aggressive nationalism . . . xenophobia and anti-Semitism. &quot; U.S. officials said they believe it is the first time Russia has specifically condemned anti-Semitism in a diplomatic statement . But human_rights also figured in the two presidents ' disagreements . Yeltsin complained about the treatment of ethnic Russians in the Baltic_republics of Latvia and Estonia , where Russia still has an estimated 20 # 000 troops , saying , &quot; There should be no double_standard , whether it happens in Haiti or the Baltics. &quot; Clinton has already pressed the leaders of Latvia and Estonia to treat ethnic Russians fairly , but he is also pressing the Russians to withdraw their troops . The two sides also disagreed over their policies toward Iran , where Russia wants to continue selling weapons . And they disagreed over Russia ' s military peacekeeping operations in neighboring Georgia and other former Soviet republics . But the disagreements did little to spoil an overall mood of satisfaction . &quot; We have certain disagreements between ourselves , &quot; Yeltsin told reporters . &quot; We do not agree with each other on everything . But the main thing is that we have goodwill and partnership. &quot; Times staff writer Richard Boudreaux contributed to this report . An Array of Accords Steps announced Friday by President Clinton and Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin at a joint news_conference : REDIRECTING MISSILES A declaration signed by the two said that by May 30 , no country will be targeted by the missiles of either the United States or Russia . &quot; For the first time since the earliest days of the nuclear age , the two countries will no longer operate nuclear forces , day-to-day , in a manner that presumes they are enemies. &quot; Three of the four U.S. strategic missile systems -- Trident I , Trident II and Peacekeeper -- will contain no targeting information . Older-technology Minuteman III missile computers , which require alignment , will be aimed at oceans . NUCLEAR WEAPONS Clinton and Yeltsin signed a three-way agreement with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk under which Ukraine pledged to transfer all_the nuclear_warheads it inherited from the Soviet_Union to Russia for dismantling &quot; in the shortest possible time. &quot; The 46 SS-24 missiles in Ukraine , the most potent weapons , would be deactivated within 10 months . The agreement still faces opposition in Ukraine ' s Parliament . NON-PROLIFERATION The two issued a joint statement listing goals and priorities on efforts to discourage the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to control sensitive dual-use technologies . They called_on North_Korea to honor the treaty requiring inspection of its nuclear facilities and urged India and Pakistan to join in treaties to ban nuclear-weapons tests . HUMAN_RIGHTS A joint statement said respect for basic human_rights is &quot; indispensable for the maintenance of good relations between countries. &quot; It pledged joint efforts to combat human_rights violations , including anti-Semitism and xenophobia . The statement answered concerns about ultranationalism in Russia and discrimination against Russian-speaking people in other former Soviet republics . URANIUM Under a contract signed_in Moscow , Russia will convert 500 tons of highly enriched uranium extracted from dismantled nuclear_weapons into low-enriched uranium that can be used for nuclear_power plants . The uranium then will be sold to the United States Enrichment Corp. , which will use the material to supply nuclear_power stations around the world . Over the 20-year life of the contract , Russia will earn about $ 12 billion at no net cost to the U.S._government . Ukraine , Kazakhstan and Belarus get compensation for the value of the uranium in warheads they transfer to Russia .</TEXT>
