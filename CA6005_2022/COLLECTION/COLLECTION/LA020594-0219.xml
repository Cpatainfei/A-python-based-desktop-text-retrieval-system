   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; AMTRAK SERVICE IS RESUMED TO BURBANK AIRPORT ; TRANSPORTATION : STATEWIDE EFFORT TO LINK DIFFERENT TYPES OF MASS TRANSIT DOES NOT CURRENTLY INCLUDE STOP FOR AIRPORT-BOUND METROLINK RIDERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Amtrak service to Burbank Airport , suspended for more_than a year , began anew Friday as part of a statewide effort to link different types of mass transit . Passengers on the Santa Barbara-San Diego line can now disembark six times a day at the airport ' s southeast edge on a new boarding platform , construction of which was hurried along after the Northridge earthquake . &quot; What we always talk_about is a seamless transportation_system . . . . We wanted to seize this opportunity &quot; to resume train service to the airport quickly after the Jan . 17 temblor , said James W . van Loben Sels , director of Caltrans , a partner with Amtrak on the new stop . However , airport-bound Metrolink riders , who pass directly through the new stop on the Moorpark line , will still have to travel_to downtown Burbank and double_back on a free shuttle provided by the airport -- even though Metrolink owns the tracks and has been invited by Caltrans to use the airport platform . Burbank Airport and Ventura County transportation officials have pressed Metrolink for direct airport service as a convenience to train commuters from Moorpark and the western San Fernando Valley . But Metrolink chief Richard Stanger said there would be too few users to justify another stop of the train . &quot; On a wildly good_day , you ' ll probably have maybe a dozen , maybe 20 people &quot; who would use the airport stop , Stanger said . &quot; that ' s only 1 % or less of our ridership on that line . &quot; So you ' re causing 99 % of our people to stop two minutes to let 1 % get_off and go_to the airport when they could have gone_to Burbank , and for admittedly a little more time gone_to the airport from the downtown Burbank station. &quot; To gauge interest in a stop on their perimeter , Burbank Airport officials have begun conducting a survey of Metrolink riders and will present the results next week to the Southern California Regional Rail Authority , which oversees Metrolink . The authority will consider the issue at its Friday meeting , including Stanger ' s recommendation not to add the platform stop to the schedule . Stanger noted that the new stop , on Empire Avenue just west of Hollywood Way , does not meet certain Metrolink requirements , such_as adequate parking_space nearby . Also , Stanger said travelers have many_more options if they use the Metrolink Burbank station , the nexus for frequent trains headed to Union Station , Ventura County and the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys . But he acknowledged that the rail authority can waive its requirements and that there could be a pool of commuters who would use the airport stop to get_to businesses close by . Bill Davis , a Simi Valley councilman on the rail authority board , said he believes the board will approve making the airport stop part of Metrolink ' s itinerary at least on a trial basis , a move Davis himself strongly backs . &quot; If I could only get 10 people to use this stop , it ' d be worth it , &quot; said Davis , who represents Ventura County on the board . &quot; It ' d be 20 less trips on the freeway , and all for a minute and a half &quot; more on the Metrolink schedule . Currently , Burbank Airport provides a free shuttle service to and from the downtown Burbank Metrolink station -- about a 10-minute journey . Jennifer Lewis , the airport ' s transportation coordinator , said the tram carries 100 riders daily , up from 35 before the Northridge earthquake . &quot; It ' s quite a mix of people that work in the area , airport passengers and people that work_at the airport , &quot; she said . The new open-air platform , which had been scheduled for construction later this year , cost $ 130 # 000 and is a temporary structure until a permanent one can be built , probably by next year , according to Caltrans spokesman John Robin Witt . The new stop will not be staffed . Tickets will be sold on the train . Amtrak service -- one train daily in either direction -- was curtailed in mid-1992 to allow Metrolink to develop its operations along the railway . Amtrak representative Ronald Scolaro estimated that between 6 # 000 and 7 # 000 passengers used the stop each year , or 16 to 19 a day . The new schedule includes three trains a day in both directions , the earliest arriving_at the airport at 9:45 a.m. en route to Los Angeles and the latest at 8:31 p.m. going north . On Friday , Steve Oliva of Del Mar was the lone passenger -- and perhaps the first all day -- to use the airport stop , getting_off about 2:30 p.m. for a surprise weekend visit to his girlfriend in Burbank . &quot; It was terrific . Normally I would drive , &quot; said Oliva , 28 , who had originally expected to disembark in Glendale . &quot; I haven ' t taken an Amtrak ( train ) since 1986. &quot; But once off the platform he had no idea where he was or how he would get_to his girlfriend ' s place -- until reporters pointed_out a waiting airport shuttle that could take him to a taxi rank .</TEXT>
