   <HEADLINE> PRIVATE BURIAL SET FOR ONASSIS AT ARLINGTON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Americans mourned the loss of a First_Lady and the loss of an era Friday as the family of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis prepared a small and private funeral far different from the grand and wrenching public ceremonies that she once helped fashion for a slain husband and President . Though the ceremonies will differ greatly , Mrs . Onassis , who died of cancer Thursday night at the age of 64 , will be buried Monday afternoon alongside President John F . Kennedy and two of their children in Arlington National Cemetery across the Potomac_River from Washington . Before she is taken_to the cemetery that guards both celebrated Americans and ordinary soldiers , a Mass will be said for her at 10 a.m. Monday at St . Ignatius Loyola Roman_Catholic_Church on Park_Avenue , just a_couple_of blocks from the 5th Avenue apartment where she died . Preparations for a burial at Arlington , where an eternal flame flickers by the grave of President Kennedy , surely will arouse memories of the 1963 funeral that mesmerized the nation . Mrs . Onassis set_aside her shyness and penchant for privacy then and orchestrated some of the most memorable features of President Kennedy ' s funeral . It was the young widow who ordered the riderless horse that followed the cortege . But privacy will rule the day as she is interred by the side of the President ; a son , Patrick Kennedy , who died three days after his birth in 1963 ; and a daughter stillborn in 1956 . Her two surviving children , 36-year-old Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg and 33-year-old John F . Kennedy Jr. , were with her when she died of cancer of the lymph system . Also present was her close friend in recent years , Maurice Tempelsman . As a light rain fell Friday morning , her son , standing in front of the apartment_building at 1040 5th Ave. , told reporters that his mother had died at 10:15 p.m. Thursday &quot; surrounded by her friends and her family and her books and the people and the things that she loved. &quot; &quot; And she did_it in her own way and in her own terms , &quot; he went_on , &quot; and we all feel lucky for that and now she ' s in God ' s hands. &quot; Mrs . Onassis , when informed that her death was near , had left New York Hospital-Cornell Medical_Center and returned to her apartment Wednesday night to face death in familiar surroundings . Her son thanked everyone &quot; both in New York and beyond &quot; for &quot; an enormous outpouring of good wishes. &quot; And he pleaded : &quot; I hope now that . . . we can just have these next couple of days in relative peace. &quot; It was difficult , however , for reporters , photographers and television_camera crews to break a habit ingrained by decades of trying to satisfy a public demand for more and more coverage of this glamorous yet very private woman . Like several other mourners in the hours after Mrs . Onassis ' death , an unidentified woman stopped to hand a rose to the doorman . She then walked to the corner and fell sobbing into the arms of another woman . The two crying women were quickly mobbed by the nearby media . Cameras and microphones thrust near their cheeks . A cameraman angrily ordered a soundman to lower the boom microphone closer to their mouths . Every tear was caught_on tape and film . More_than a_hundred reporters , photographers and television crew_members kept their vigil throughout the day , joined by at least as_many mourners and the curious . Many watched the comings and goings of friends and families from Central_Park across the avenue . A number left mementos at the door . A security_guard from the nearby Metropolitan Museum of Art left a pale rose tied to a white ribbon . A note said : &quot; From Dan and Thomas at the Met . we ' ll miss our friend. &quot; Sen . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) and his wife , Victoria , spent 25 minutes in the apartment during the morning . Tempelsman left a_few minutes later . Traffic snarls often on 5th Avenue on normal days and it was even more snarled than usual as drivers slowed_down to catch_a_glimpse of the building and the media crush . Police tried hard to move the traffic along , sometimes waving cars through red_lights . As the eulogies cascaded across news wires , President Clinton caught the mood of all by describing Mrs . Onassis -- widow of both President Kennedy and Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis -- as &quot; a model of courage and dignity for all Americans and all_the world. &quot; &quot; More_than any other woman of her time , &quot; the President went_on before leaving Washington for a two-day trip to California , &quot; she captivated our nation and the world with her intelligence , her elegance and her grace . Even in the face of impossible tragedy , she carried the grief of her family and our entire nation with a calm power that somehow reassured all_the rest of us. &quot; The President , accompanied by his wife , Hillary Rodham Clinton , spoke_to reporters in the First_Lady ' s Garden , a section of the White_House grounds that , as Mrs . Clinton put it , &quot; is named for her &quot; and &quot; which she helped to realize. &quot; Mrs . Clinton said that Mrs . Onassis had once told her : &quot; If you bungle raising your children , I don ' t think whatever else you do matters very much. &quot; The two women had first discussed the &quot; challenges and opportunities &quot; of being the First_Lady in the summer of 1992 , Mrs . Clinton said , and Mrs . Onassis had explained &quot; how she had managed so well to carve out the space and privacy that children need to grow_into what they have a right to become. &quot; Mourning for Mrs . Onassis spread throughout the land . In Boston , for example , tourists and residents lined_up at the John F . Kennedy Library to sign a special condolence book that had been placed under a 1962 portrait of the former First_Lady . The golden-framed picture portrayed a 32-year-old Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy , eyes fixed in level gaze , with a faint smile . Visitors to the repository of the Kennedy papers seemed eager somehow to connect with the woman in the white suit and to convey the feelings of sadness that , as they milled_about , they shared with one another . &quot; She will be missed ! &quot; wrote Edward S . Drake of Brea , Calif. , carefully emphasizing the exclamation_point . Bill Allen of Plymouth , Mass. , called her &quot; America ' s perfect lady , &quot; and Gill Peterson of Libertyville , Ill. , described her as &quot; a model for men and women. &quot; Raymond Beauhemin of Montreal penned a simple : &quot; Adieu , madame. &quot; As one of the founders of the Kennedy Library , Mrs . Onassis paid frequent visits to the striking white building in Boston ' s Dorchester section . A library spokesman called her &quot; a boundless source of ideas and inspiration in the development of this institution. &quot; The spokesman said that the condolence book will be sent to Mrs . Onassis ' family . Times staff writer Elizabeth Mehren in Boston contributed to this story .</TEXT>
