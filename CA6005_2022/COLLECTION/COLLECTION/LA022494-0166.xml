   <HEADLINE> BEANS ; TO SOAK OR NOT TO SOAK , IT ' S NO LONGER A QUESTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Almost every recipe in every cookbook you ' ve ever read says you must soak dried beans before you cook them . In almost every case that advice is wrong . Letting dried beans sit overnight in a bowl of cold water does nothing to improve their flavor or their texture . In fact , it does quite the opposite . While soaking shortens the unattended cooking time of beans somewhat , the time saved is marginal and there are no other labor-saving benefits . Finally , soaking does absolutely nothing to reduce the gas-producing properties of beans . These may be difficult ideas to get used to , flying as they do_in the face of everything most of us have been taught about cooking beans . One friend , an Arizonan , dismissed the idea out-of-hand , attributing it to my New Mexican background . &quot; What do they know about beans ? &quot; she said . But cooking unsoaked beans is not new . No less an authority than noted Mexican cookbook writer Diana Kennedy has advocated it for years . &quot; If you want the best-flavored beans , don ' t soak them overnight , but start cooking in hot water , &quot; she says in &quot; The Cuisines of Mexico &quot; ( Harper &amp; Row : 1972 ) . In fact , the more I asked around , the more people I found who cooked beans this way -- mostly , it seemed , people from Mexican or Central_American families -- although at least one prominent New American chef and another well-known French chef agreed . What ' s more , few commercial canners soak dried beans before cooking . In fact , in a way they don ' t cook the beans at all . The heat and pressure of the canning process ( called the retort ) is enough to cook -- perhaps even overcook -- the beans right in the can . * Still , I wanted to see for myself . Call it trial by frijoles . First , I cooked three pots of beans : one soaked overnight , one quick-soaked ( brought_to a boil and left to sit , covered_for one hour ) , and one simply covered with boiling water . To each pot I added a hunk of salt_pork , some sliced onion and a bit of garlic . I simmered them slowly on top of the stove , covered . The two soaked beans did cook more quickly than the unsoaked -- they were finished in about 1 hour and 15 minutes , as opposed to two hours . But when I sampled them , the extra 45 minutes paid_off . The two pots of soaked beans were pallid compared to the unsoaked ( though the long-soaked were better than the quick-soaked ) . The unsoaked beans had a noticeably deeper flavor ; they were firmer to the bite , and they did not break_up as much in cooking . Then came the ultimate test . I sat_down with a big bowl of the cooked unsoaked beans ( after a little refrying with bacon and a handful of grated Monterey Jack cheese ) and ate lunch . I waited , half expecting to blow_up like a balloon ( as a precaution , I did this test at_home , alone ) . Nothing untoward happened . That experiment was far from scientific , but after talking to a_couple_of researchers who confirmed my results , I moved_on to more phone_calls and other tests . * All of us , it seems , have our own set of folk tales about cooking beans . And most rules are followed simply because that ' s the way someone told us to do_it , rather than as a result of any kind of testing . * Some people told me quite firmly that beans should never be salted before cooking -- that this keeps them from softening during cooking . In fact , Kennedy herself makes this claim . So I cooked beans with salt added ( 1 teaspoon per pound of beans turns_out to be about the right ratio ) and without . They cooked to exactly the same degree of softness in almost exactly the same time . Interestingly , though , to get the same level of saltiness in the unsalted batch of beans , I had to add more_than twice as much salt . And even then , it was more a case of the broth being salty than the beans . * Other people said that the type of pot in which beans are cooked is the most important thing -- only earthenware will do . I cooked beans in three different pots -- earthenware , stainless-steel and unlined aluminum . There was some difference in the rate at which the beans soaked_up water ( or , probably more accurately , the pans soaked_up water ) . The earthenware needed more water early but then seemed to maintain a steady level a little better . I could find little difference in flavor between the earthenware and the stainless-steel , but the unlined aluminum lent a distinctly metallic flavor to the beans . * One chef told me he never allowed his beans to be cooked on top of the stove . Only by cooking them in the oven is it possible to get the slow , steady pace they need , he claimed . * I cooked beans both on top of the stove and in the oven . With constant attention and a ready flame-tamer , I could manipulate the temperature well enough to keep the beans at a sufficiently slow simmer . But , covered , in a 250-degree oven , the cooking was almost effortless . All I had to do was check every half-hour or so to make_sure there was sufficient water . The effect of the cover was particularly amazing . Cooking beans in one test without a cover took six hours . The same quantity of beans , cooked at the same temperature with a lid , was done_in about 1 hour , 15 minutes ( without pre-soaking ) . All of these tests were done with commonly available varieties -- pinto and white northern -- that had been purchased from stores that seem to sell a lot of beans . In fact , the age of the bean may be the most important factor . Dried beans continue to lose moisture as they sit . With very recently picked beans -- say , the Scarlet_Runners I pick and shell in the summer in my back yard -- a quick simmer is all that is necessary . ( Actually they are quite good even raw when doused with a little olive_oil , mint or basil and salt ) . On the other hand , those dried flageolet beans you bought on a whim a_couple_of years ago that have been sitting in the back of the pantry ever since may be quite dry . In fact , with these beans , soaking may be necessary to bring the cooking time down to a matter of hours , rather than days . * Finally , it was time to put the beans to the final test -- cooking them in recipes . What good is science , after all , if it is not in the service of mankind ? So test we did , adapting old favorite bean recipes to this &quot; new &quot; way of cooking . The results were gratifying : In every case , the dishes were done_in almost the same amount_of_time as the originals . And the textures and flavors of the beans were much improved . Progress is great when it tastes so good . * Beans , squash and chile are three of the basic American ingredients . I was going_to add corn , but it just seemed to busy . My favorite thing about this recipe is the interplay of the sweet , soft squash and the earthy , firm beans . But that ' s just a bit too subtle to carry the dish . The addition of the red_onion just before serving makes an amazing amount of difference -- a blaze of color across a subtle background . PINTO_BEAN AND SQUASH STEW 1 pound dried pinto_beans Salt 1 ( 1 / 4x2-inch ) slice salt_pork 1 / 4 onion , chopped 2 cloves garlic , minced Pepper 4 slices bacon , cubed 1 jalapeno chile , seeded and minced 2 green_onions , minced 1 butternut_squash , peeled and cubed 1 cup beef_stock 1 / 2 red_onion , finely diced 1 / 4 cup chopped cilantro 3 / 4 cup sour_cream Cover pinto_beans and 1 teaspoon salt with 3 inches of boiling water in large pot . Add salt_pork , onion and garlic . Cover and bake at 250 degrees until beans are cooked , 2 to 2 1 / 2 hours . Season to taste with salt , if necessary , and pepper . Keep warm . Cook bacon with jalapeno and green_onions over low heat in large saute pan until bacon is crisp . Add squash and stock . Cover and cook until squash is just tender , about 1 / 2 hour . Combine beans and squash and mix gently but well . Do not smash beans or squash . Spoon beans and squash into 6 serving bowls . Sprinkle each with red_onion , cilantro and 2 tablespoons sour_cream .

It ' s adapted from &quot; Paula Wolfert ' s World of Food &quot; ( Harper &amp; Row : 1988 ) . &quot; The beans must cook al pil-pil , &quot; Wolfert writes , &quot; which in Basque means very slowly in an earthenware pot , over very low heat . Purists say the good flavor of this dish comes from the taste of the pot . I believe the particular savor develops because the beans must be cooked very slowly to avoid breaking the pot , and thus the flavors of all_the components have time to intermingle . &quot; The special spicy edge of this dish comes from the fleshy hot_peppers of Espelette , a town in the Basque region of France . The closest equivalent taste that I have found is the . . . bottled chile sauce called Sriracha ( a thick chile paste sold in Southern California in most Asian markets ) . If not available , substitute Red_Devil sauce. &quot; BLACK SAUSAGES WITH RED BEANS AND CHORIZO 1 pound small red beans or red kidney beans 3 / 4 pound lean salt_pork 1 / 4 cup olive_oil 2 medium onions , sliced 2 cloves garlic , sliced 1 pound fresh chorizo sausages in natural casings , or spicy Hungarian or Italian sausages , uncut 4 carrots , scraped and cut_into 1-inch chunks to equal 16 pieces 3 green Italian peppers ( also called frying peppers ) , cored , seeded and cut_into 1-inch squares to equal 24 pieces Dash sugar Salt 3 / 4 teaspoon chile paste , or more to taste 6 ounces blood_sausage Freshly ground pepper Red_wine vinegar Pick_over beans , then place in colander and rinse under cool running water until water runs clear .

Allow yourself two days to do this one , adapted from Richard Olney ' s &quot; The French Menu Cookbook &quot; ( Godine : 1970 ) , and the amount of work should be manageable . And rest assured , the flavors are more_than worth the effort . CASSOULET Pan-Fried Goose Bean Stew 2 medium onions , coarsely chopped 2 medium carrots , peeled and cut_into short lengths 1 lamb shoulder , all surface fat removed , cut_into large pieces but not boned Salt 2 tablespoons flour 1 cup dry white_wine 3 cloves garlic , peeled Mixed herbs , such_as dried thyme , oregano , marjoram and savory 1 ( 1-pound ) can tomatoes or 3 to 4 fresh tomatoes 2 whole cloves garlic White_bread crumbs Prepare Pan-Fried Goose and Bean Stew . Set_aside . In 2 tablespoons fat rendered from Pan-Fried Goose , cook onions and carrots in heavy saute pan ( just big enough to hold meat placed side_by_side ) about 15 minutes , stirring regularly , until lightly browned . Remove onions and carrots . In same pan over high heat , brown pieces of lamb , seasoned to taste with salt , in same fat . When browned on all sides , sprinkle with flour . Turn pieces over , then return vegetables to pan . When flour is lightly cooked , add white_wine , garlic and sprinkling of herbs to taste . Scrape and stir with wooden spoon to loosen and dissolve browned bits . Transfer contents to heavy casserole . Add tomatoes and enough of cooking liquid from Bean Stew to cover . Cook , covered , at bare simmer , either in 275-degree oven or over very low heat on range , 1 1 / 2 hours . Skimming_off surface fat 2 or 3 times . Pour contents of casserole into sieve or colander . Pick_out pieces of meat and carrot and put aside . Press rest through sieve into saucepan . Bring to boil , reduce heat and cook at low simmer 15 minutes , skimming . Rub bottom and sides of large , medium-deep earthenware oven dish with garlic_cloves until garlic disappears . Untie pork rind from Bean Stew , cut_into small dice and distribute over bottom of dish . Cut Pan-Fried Goose into 2 pieces and place on bed of rinds . Drain beans , reserving liquid . Distribute about 1 / 3 of beans over and around pieces of goose . Split pig ' s foot from Bean Stew . Remove largest bones and cut each half into 3 to 4 pieces . Arrange pig ' s foot along with pieces of lamb and carrot , including carrot from Bean Stew , evenly over surface . Cover everything with half of remaining beans . Distribute sausage from Bean Stew ( cut_into thick slices ) and pancetta from Bean Stew ( cut_into squares ) on top . Cover with remaining beans . Generously sprinkle entire surface with bread crumbs . Then carefully , to moisten without displacing , pour over , ladle by ladle , sauce from lamb until liquid rises just to surface of beans . Dust lightly again with bread crumbs . Sprinkle several tablespoonfuls of melted goose fat over surface . Bake at 450 degrees until heated through and bubbling . Reduce heat to 300 degrees so gentle bubbling is maintained . After about 20 minutes , as liquid reduces , partly by absorption and partly by evaporation , begin to baste surface , first with remaining lamb sauce and then , when lamb sauce is finished , with remaining cooking liquid from Bean Stew . Baste every 20 minutes . When golden-crisp crust has formed on surface , break crust all_over with spoon so part becomes submerged and rest is moistened by sauce . In principle , cassoulet should remain at least 2 hours in slow oven , and crust should be broken minimum of 3 times . But if basting liquids should run_short before then , it is better to stop cooking than risk dish becoming too dry . Makes 14 servings .

Frijoles de Olla 1 / 2 pound dry beans , such_as pinto , California pink or black turtle Salt 1 / 4 white onion , roughly sliced 1 heaped tablespoon lard Run beans through hands to pick_out any small stones or pieces of earth . Rinse twice in cold water and drain . Put beans into pot and cover with enough hot water to come at least 3 inches above beans . Add 1 / 2 teaspoon salt , onion and lard . Bring to simmer . Continue simmering until skins of beans are soft . Season to taste with salt . Continue cooking until beans are very soft and broth is soupy . Beans are_better eaten day after cooking , when flavor matures . Makes about 3 1 / 2 cups . * This recipe , adapted from &quot; Jasper White ' s Cooking From New England &quot; ( Harper &amp; Row : 1989 ) , may well be the ultimate American baked bean , just sweet enough from the molasses and maple_sugar . There is also a pleasantly bitter undertone from the black_pepper and dried mustard . BOSTON BAKED BEANS 1 pound navy_beans , pea_beans or other small dried white_beans 1 / 2 pound salt_pork 1 medium onion , cut_in 1 / 2-inch dice 4 cloves garlic , finely chopped 1 cup tomato puree 1 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons freshly ground black_pepper 1 / 4 cup mustard 1 / 3 cup maple_sugar 1 / 3 cup molasses 2 bay leaves 3 tablespoons cider_vinegar Pick through beans and discard off-colored or broken ones . Rinse and drain beans . Remove rind from half of salt_pork . Cut_into 1 / 2-inch squares . Cut other half into 3 / 4- to 1-inch-thick strips to equal 4 or 5 strips , with rind attached . Set_aside . Line bottom of earthenware crock or bean pot with 1 / 2-inch squares of salt_pork and onion . Place beans on top . Bring 1 quart water to boil in saucepan . Add garlic , tomato puree , salt , pepper , mustard , maple_sugar , molasses , bay leaves and vinegar . Simmer 1 minute . Mix well and pour over beans . Score strips of salt_pork crosswise , about every inch , without cutting_through . This prevents strips from curling while cooking . Place strips on top of beans and liquid . Cover pot and bake at 250 degrees 5 hours , checking occasionally ( first at 2 hours , then every hour ) , to be sure liquid is just barely covering beans . Add more water as needed . After 5 hours , remove cover of bean pot and cook 1 hour more . Remove strips of salt_pork and stir pot before serving . Makes 6 to 8 servings .
