   <HEADLINE> REUSABLE ROCKET IS PROPOSED AS POSSIBLE SHUTTLE REPLACEMENT ; AEROSPACE : LOCKHEED AND ROCKETDYNE HAVE TEAMED_UP TO COMPETE WITH OTHER AEROSPACE COMPANIES FOR $ 167 MILLION IN NASA GRANTS TO STUDY THE FEASIBILITY OF A ' SINGLE-STAGE-TO-ORBIT ' ROCKET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lockheed Corp . and Rocketdyne have proposed a radical , reusable wedged-shaped spacecraft with rocket_engines to lift it into orbit and return in one piece , and which could by next decade replace the current space shuttle and the country ' s fleet of expendable rockets . Lockheed , based in Calabasas , and Rocketdyne , the Canoga Park division of Rockwell International , have teamed_up , and are among several aerospace companies competing for $ 167 million in grants from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) over the next five years to explore the feasibility of a so-called &quot; single-stage-to-orbit &quot; rocket , or SSTO . The reason behind all this is to save money . Lockheed could develop the new single-stage rocket vehicle at a cost of about $ 6 billion by the end of this century , said Bob Baumgartner , chief engineer of Lockheed ' s AeroBallistic Rocket SSTO program in Palmdale . After that , the cost per launch would be about $ 20 million , he said . By contrast , the current space shuttle costs about $ 322 million per launch , NASA official Ivan Bekey said . But some consider the single-stage-to-orbit rocket to be a pie-in-the-sky idea . &quot; I suppose it can be made to work . The question is at what price , &quot; Caltech aeronautics professor Wolfgang Knauss said . The potential pratfalls are numerous , Knauss said , adding that the idea of a single-stage rocket is still viewed_as &quot; a little far out. &quot; Materials that work well in the lab might surprise once they ' re in space , Knauss said . Newer , lightweight materials proposed for SSTO rockets &quot; have all this promise , but they haven ' t really been explored for engineering purposes , &quot; he said . Whether Congress would support such a plan is far from clear . Also uncertain is whether the Pentagon and the White_House will back the SSTO concept . Both are now completing separate studies on revamping U . S . rocket launch systems , and are expected to release their recommendations in coming weeks . Still , the idea of a single-stage reusable rocket is being taken seriously by NASA . The agency ' s own study estimates that it would cost NASA $ 18 billion for development , and $ 19 billion for production of a fleet of seven SSTO rockets to begin replacing current launching systems by around 2008 . NASA , though , is hoping the government will never have to pay_for this new generation of launching vehicles . The agency wants an SSTO program to mark a new era of privatization of rocket systems in which American companies develop and own spacecraft , while NASA would simply be a customer among many . The idea behind an SSTO is to reach orbit with a single-stage rocket , without jettisoning engines or fuel tanks . Such a vehicle would make repeated trips to space with a minimum of tinkering . This is a radical departure from current methods . All of the country ' s existing fleet of expendable rockets drop bits of themselves in stages , lightening the load as they climb . The current space shuttle fleet is closer to being truly reusable . The shuttles drop two solid fuel boosters and a fuel tank in flight . Once they are fished from the ocean , the boosters can be used a_few more times , but refurbishing the shuttle for repeat flights is a mammoth project that keeps thousands of government workers in constant employment . The current multiple-stage rockets are wasteful and costly , Baumgartner said . But a single-stage rocket must also overcome considerable technical hurdles . It must be both light enough , and powerful enough , to reach orbit intact , he said . Lockheed ' s new concept is similar to several other proposals for SSTOs . McDonnell Douglas has proposed a craft that would return to earth by landing vertically and descending slowly onto a landing pad , with its nose pointed skyward . Lockheed ' s SSTO rocket would be more like the shuttle . It would shoot_up vertically from the launching_pad like current rockets , and descend by landing horizontally on a runway like an airplane . Company officials say it ' s no coincidence the design comes not from its missile division , but from Lockheed Advanced Development Co . in Palmdale , also known as the Skunk Works , the group which has produced various spy planes and fighter jets . &quot; This is a radical change , a leapfrog , &quot; Baumgartner said . &quot; We see it as aircraft that goes_into orbit rather than a rocket that lands. &quot; Rocketdyne has the contract to make engines for the current space shuttle , and wants to remain in the vanguard as NASA plans what could be the shuttle ' s successor . If they do get funding to build an SSTO , Lockheed and Rocketdyne ' s engineers have plenty of technical hurdles to overcome because the very features that make a craft reusable tend to add weight : For instance , reusable rockets must be swaddled in heat-resistant material to avoid charring when they re-enter the atmosphere . And more powerful engines usually weigh more . Lockheed , however , believes it can master these trade-offs . Its proposed design for an SSTO rocket craft is a wingless , 110-foot-long , 110-foot-wide , triangular-shaped wedge . Technology advances make such an SSTO rocket possible today , Baumgartner contends . The most important of these is improved materials , particularly light and durable graphite composites . Graphite composites have been used for the bodies of military aircraft for years , Baumgartner said . They would be used to form the internal body and the hydrogen fuel tanks in Lockheed ' s SSTO design . A new , super-light aluminum would be used to build the liquid_oxygen fuel tanks while heat-resistant ceramics and other high-temperature metals would shield the rocket from the heat of re-entry , Baumgartner said . These materials are not only light , they are more durable than the tiles now used to protect the space shuttle , and they would not require time-consuming inspection and waterproofing after each flight , he said . The craft would carry a payload of about 40 # 000 pounds , compared with the space shuttle ' s 50 # 000 pounds , and run_on liquid hydrogen and liquid_oxygen fuel , Baumgartner said . Seven engines manufactured by Rocketdyne are to be mounted in the rear of the craft . The engines are flatter than ordinary , bell-shaped rocket_engines , and while they are heavy , they would in theory make_up for it by conforming_to the body ' s weight-saving design . Rocketdyne ' s &quot; linear aerospike &quot; engine was studied initially for space shuttle use in the early 1970s , but was never tested because NASA instead decided to use more traditional bell-shaped rocket_engines , said Don Fulton , program director of advanced launch system engines at Rocketdyne . In traditional rockets , the engine nozzle is an enclosed series of tubes . In the linear aerospike it is just a curved plate of metal . The gases expand against the plate and are contained by the friction of the surrounding atmosphere . Lockheed projects the cost of launching its proposed SSTO would be about $ 500 per pound of payload , as contrasted with about $ 7 # 000 per pound average for the current U . S . rocket fleet and for the cheapest available commercial launch systems . But as Lockheed and Rocketdyne concede , the SSTO project hinges_on a slew of unknowns . Much of the technology needed to make an SSTO has yet to be tested . For instance , it ' s unknown whether graphite composite fuel tanks can be designed to survive repeated launches without leaking , Baumgartner said . And the effects of the atmosphere against the body of the craft is another unknown , as is the performance of the engine once mounted in the rocket . NASA , however , favors development of an SSTO over other cost-saving alternatives , such_as updating current rockets , in part because it believes an SSTO would restore American dominance of the world market for launching systems . Since the mid-1970s , the American share of the private rocket market has slipped from 100 % to about 30 % of launchings worldwide , while French , Chinese and Russian shares have steadily grown . But critics question whether the commercial market for SSTOs would justify the cost of developing one . &quot; The idea is that . . . if you lower the cost of access , it will make people want to do things in space . I think that remains to be seen , &quot; said John Logsdon , director of the Space Policy Institute at George_Washington University .</TEXT>
