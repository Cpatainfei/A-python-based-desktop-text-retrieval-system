   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : FULLERTON ; TEMPERS RISE OVER AIR CONDITIONERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tempers heated_up earlier this week as parents and school_board members argued over the best way to air-condition Fullerton elementary classrooms during hot summer months . Parents and residents angrily accused the board of &quot; socialist &quot; measures when three members said the cash-strapped school district won ' t accept money earmarked to buy air conditioners for selected schools , yet leave schools in poorer areas neglected . Citing concerns over equal_opportunity , the board_members said parents ought to raise money on a districtwide basis so all students have an equal chance of beating the heat . But many parents disagreed . &quot; If money is so tight , how can you look a gift_horse in the mouth ? &quot; said Diane Czypull , 37 , who is part of a group that has been trying to get the school_board ' s approval to raise money for air-conditioning for the Laguna Road Elementary School . &quot; We are more_than willing to help you out , &quot; Czypull said . Parents at Acacia Elementary School raised money and donated five air-conditioning units to their school last summer , but board_members said Tuesday they will no longer accept such donations . The board has not voted formally on the issue and instead handles each gift donation on an ad_hoc basis . Board_members Robert C . Fisler , Elena Reyes-Jones and Rosamaria Gomez-Amaro said they oppose allowing parents to raise money to buy air conditioners for a particular school , while members Karen Chavez and Marjorie Pogue said they agreed with the parents . &quot; I feel that if parents are willing to do extra_time ( fund-raising ) for their schools , that ' s their choice , &quot; Pogue said . But Gomez-Amaro said the school_board is under the obligation to insure &quot; equal educational opportunity &quot; when accepting gifts . &quot; We don ' t want to turn_down any money that ' s going_to help the district , but we want to make_sure it doesn ' t create imbalances , &quot; she said . Reyes-Jones explained that although some parent groups are successful at raising money , schools in poorer areas may_not be as successful , and the school district doesn ' t have the money to buy air conditioners for them . Most of the district ' s 17 schools and 11 # 000 students are without air-conditioning , Reyes-Jones said . &quot; We don ' t want to exacerbate the inequity , &quot; Reyes-Jones said . Fair or not , cool air is a hot topic , especially when classroom temperatures soar past the 100-degree mark . &quot; The number of children who go_home on hot days with headaches and lose education is appalling , &quot; said Lynne Frutchey , 35 , a kindergarten teacher at Laguna Road Elementary . Frutchey called the board ' s decision &quot; extreme &quot; and suggested the district turn_off all its air conditioners , including the units in the board_members ' offices , until the problem is solved . Even residents with no children in the school_system came_to the board_meeting to offer their opinion . &quot; It ' s socialism , and you ' re driving everyone down to the lowest level , &quot; 72-year-old Charles Ford told the board . &quot; This is not the American way , &quot; agreed Pat Lochrie , who has one child in private_school . &quot; It ' s ridiculous that this board thinks it has any right at all to take its hands and stick them into these kids ' pockets for something they ' ve raised for their school , &quot; she said .
