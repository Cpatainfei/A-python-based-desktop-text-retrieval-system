   <HEADLINE> PARKER ' S PLACE : THEIR SECRET DOVE-HUNTING WEAPON : EGG_ROLLS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Each summer as September approaches , a batch of Orange Countians begins to quiver with a sense of great excitement . This is because September marks the opening of the dove hunting_season , which signals the final act of summer . Not that summer has been less than enjoyable for some of us -- it ' s just that after almost three months of anything , most of us are ready for a change . In early August I got my first anxiety dream about the coming season . According to my informal polling over the years , nearly 80 % of bird hunters have anxiety dreams before opening day . Typically , a bird hunter ' s anxiety dream involves forgetting your shells , your gun , your dog , or being part of a group of people who refuse to get_to the fields on_time . In my case , the dream was even more odd in that I got_up early on opening day , had my equipment and dog ready , and got_to the field at sunrise . Unfortunately , the field of my dreams was the Big Canyon community of Newport Beach . I stood there and watched a dove flying_high above me ( far out of range ) but shot anyway and of course missed , which is mandatory in hunters ' anxiety dreams . At this point , the assembled citizens of Big Canyon began having a party unrelated to my hunt in their neighborhood . They pretty much ignored me . Then , a huge cop approached me and demanded to know why I was brandishing a shotgun in the city_limits of Newport Beach . &quot; It ' s opening day of dove season , &quot; I explained . He glared at me . He was wearing an outfit of animal_skins and moccasins . He looked_like something out of &quot; The Deerslayer. &quot; Then he gave me a nice little leather &quot; license &quot; that had my name engraved on it , and said if I was going_to hunt Big Canyon this year , I ' d need this . &quot; Good_luck , &quot; he said . &quot; Thank you , sir ! &quot; My second anxiety dream , a week later , was even worse . In this one , I dreamed that I was hunting in Arizona and my one-eyed dog , Cassius , fell_into a flood-swollen river . He was being carried_away to certain death . I awoke terrified and realized that this had actually happened just last year . I went downstairs to see if my four-legged soul_mate was OK , and he just barked at me like I was The Times delivery person he so loves to torment . Getting Cassius ready for the season has not been easy . First , about three months ago , I put him on a diet because he ' d gained so_much weight , he ' d begun to look_like a sea_lion . His idea of a perfect day was to rise , slide on his back_down the hillside about 20 feet to wallow in the dirt , eat , then find shade and sleep for the remaining 23 hours . When I ' d remind him it was just a_few more months until bird season , he ' d lift his head slightly , open the lid of his one good eye , look_at me without comprehension , then crash back to sleep , his head hitting_the_deck like a dropped ham . Luckily , my brother Matt took it upon himself to get Cassius physically fit for bird season . He walked Cassius up the_hill and to the Alta Laguna basketball_court almost every day for a month . There they played one-on-one , with Cassius developing quite a flair for defense . Then they ' d hike back_down the_hill to the house , a two-mile round_trip for Matt but a three-mile trip for Cassius , who lumbers away every chance he gets_to chase lizards . One of the things I like to do is get Cassius &quot; birdy &quot; before the season begins . This generally means getting a rock-hard game_bird out of the freezer and throwing it into the bushes so he can smell it and bring it back . When he was a puppy we ' d play this game for hours every day . But this summer he showed no interest in the pathetic icy treat . The reason , I suspected , is that we have so many quail , dove and rabbits loitering around the house these days . There is food and water for them , and no real predators , unless you count Cassius , who is so bored with them he won ' t even look_at a covey of 15 birds as they hustle across the driveway . In the old days , I ' d say &quot; Cassius -- quail ! &quot; and he ' d bolt after them . Now he just looks_at me as if I ' m addled , yawns , and falls_asleep on the padded patio chair . I tried to interest him in tennis_balls , but he would n ' t lower himself . I tried a nice new leather softball dunked in quail scent from a local sporting goods store , but he showed no interest in that , either . I tried golf_balls , racquet balls , even training dummies , but Cassius would retrieve them only once , then waddle to his water bucket , tip it over and fall_asleep in the flood . Matt solved the problem . He discovered that the only things Cassius would enthusiastically &quot; retrieve &quot; were frozen Chinese egg_rolls . He knocked dozens of these into the hillsides with a baseball_bat -- tasty little fungos sailing into the brush -- and Cassius found every one . Of course , he ate every one on the spot , which got expensive and worked counter to the strict dieting intended to make him svelte . A few nights later I dreamed that I was hunting and Cassius went_out after a downed bird but instead brought me back a complete dinner from the Golden Peacock Chinese restaurant in Laguna Beach -- minus the egg_rolls . I fretted and couldn ' t get_back to sleep because I was hungry . Getting yourself ready for bird season isn ' t much easier . The trouble with doves is that you can only shoot them for a_few days every year , so an entire year goes_by between hunts . What this means is that you don ' t get anything close to realistic practice for these birds , and every season -- at least for people at my skill level -- seems as if it ' s your first . So I haunt the local gun range , running_up exorbitant bills for rounds of trap . By late August I ' m usually knocking_down 20 or so clay birds out of 25 . But by now I know enough to expect considerably worse results on real doves , because they are fast and wily and can change direction twice a second at 40 m.p.h. Typically , by the end of a two-day dove hunt , I ' ll have wasted so_much ammunition that -- when added_to the gas , food , licenses , lodging and egg_rolls for Cassius -- my table-ready doves will cost more per ounce than gold and only slightly less than weapons-grade plutonium . So by now we ' re more or less ready -- man and dog -- to partake_in the atavistic ritual of the hunt . We ' ve honed our bodies and minds to predatory readiness . We ' ve got bold new recipes picked_out , should we come_back with enough birds to actually make a meal . We look_at the doves flying over the house each evening , imagine them marinated and grilling on our Weber . We look_forward to doing something that men and dogs have been doing every fall , more or less , since the beginning of time .</TEXT>
