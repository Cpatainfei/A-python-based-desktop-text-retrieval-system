   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE ROAD TO RECOVERY ; EMERGENCY SYSTEMS KICKED IN ON CUE , AVERTING CHAOS ; PREPAREDNESS : COSTLY PRECAUTIONS PREVENT LOSS OF WATER , RELEASE OF SEWAGE AND HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Toxic gas billows from dozens of plants and factories . Sewage spews into the streets and floods the ocean by the millions of gallons . And flames roar out of control , as fire_hoses and hydrants run_out of water . Those dark scenes might have descended on Los Angeles in last month ' s earthquake were it not for years of planning , scores of technological advances and several billion dollars in public works improvements , officials said . Although dozens of deaths and devastating property damage understandably have received the most attention since the quake , many government officials , business people and others said residents should take some comfort in the calamities that were averted . Los Angeles ' power , water , sewage and toxic control_systems functioned almost flawlessly after the quake , and based on that experience , many officials are cautiously optimistic those key services will survive the much-anticipated Big One as well . * When Southern California was throttled at 4:31 a.m. on Jan . 17 , power was lost throughout the city . That could have been disastrous for a city sewer_system that carries nearly half a_billion gallons of waste every day . But the system shifted almost seamlessly into emergency mode . Backup generators have been installed at most of the 54 pumping stations along 6 # 500 miles of sewer_lines to keep waste flowing even during power outages . And an internal power_station was built at the Hyperion Treatment Plant , the oceanside facility in Playa del Rey that processes three-quarters of the 435 million gallons of sewage created in the city each day . The work was part of court-ordered improvements to reduce the pollutants dumped into Santa Monica Bay -- a $ 3.5-billion reconstruction job that is 60 % complete . The key to the emergency response was the Hyperion plant , which switched to the internal power_system fueled by methane gas and dried sewage sludge . &quot; We didn ' t miss a beat , &quot; said Sam Furuta , assistant director of the city ' s Bureau of Sanitation . &quot; The internal power_system came_on and kept powering us throughout the incident. &quot; With the plant still on-line , it was able to serve its intended purpose as the backstop for two other sewage plants that do not have emergency generators . More_than 37 million gallons of effluent was diverted from the Donald C . Tillman Water Reclamation Plant in the Sepulveda Basin and the Los Angeles-Glendale Water Reclamation Plant near Griffith Park . Those facilities had to shunt waste to Hyperion for half a day until they regained power . If Hyperion had lost all power , the outcome would have been much worse . The plant would have been down for at least an hour and 45 minutes , long enough that it would have been forced to dump about 25 million gallons of sewage into Santa Monica Bay with only minimal treatment , public works engineers said . Instead , the city system lost just 300 gallons , from a single sewer_main that was crushed in southwest Los Angeles . The new backup generators , installed at pumping plants around the city , helped avert much larger spills . &quot; That prevented sewage from literally flowing in the streets , &quot; said Mark Gold , staff scientist for the environmental group Heal the Bay and a frequent critic of the sewer_system . &quot; That would have created a much greater risk of some sort of public health outbreak. &quot; * Southern California ' s major water supplier , the Metropolitan Water District , also relied_on new technology and innovation to weather the earthquake . MWD officials feared that in a major catastrophe they would have to wait in_line with other customers to order new pipe to replace damaged lines . They also worried that the makers of giant main_lines were so distant that they could not deliver to Southern California promptly . So , after the 1971 Sylmar quake , the giant agency created its own pipe-making plant . With its own facility and metal supplies in La Verne when the quake hit , the MWD was able to fabricate and replace in just a day , two critical , seven-foot-diameter sections of pipe that had been damaged at the MWD ' s Jensen Pumping plant in the San Fernando Valley . Without that pipeline , much of the Valley would have been without water within about 72 hours , when reservoirs ' supplies would have run_low . The other major supplier , the city ' s Department of Water and Power , suffered breaks_in its two aqueducts that feed the Valley . With the MWD back in_service so quickly , water was routed to all customers except those who suffered local damage to mains running under city streets . &quot; We saw the potential for this problem in 1971 , &quot; said Richard Balcerzak , assistant general_manager . &quot; This is a cheap solution , and one that really paid off. &quot; Another innovation may have prevented even further damage at the Jensen facility in Granada Hills -- a critical transmission point for water in the California Aqueduct . It had sustained major damage in the Sylmar quake , in part from the phenomenon of liquefaction -- when solid_ground turns_to the consistency of quicksand as water_tables are suddenly elevated . A flood and certain fatalities were only avoided because the plant had not yet gone on-line , MWD officials said . * To correct the problem , former MWD Chief Engineer Robert Mohle embraced a revolutionary design in which the water district drilled 1 # 100 holes_in_the_ground , two feet in diameter and 60 feet deep . The &quot; Mohle holes , &quot; as they were quickly dubbed by MWD engineers , absorb water as it rises and limit the effects of liquefaction , Balcerzak said . MWD engineers believe the holes helped neutralize the shock_waves from the quake and minimize the damage . &quot; We feel pretty good about what we did , &quot; Balcerzak said . &quot; We fared pretty doggone good. &quot; An untold amount of additional funds have been spent by private industry to limit another potential earthquake disaster -- the release of hazardous materials . Authorities say that widespread compliance with an 8-year-old state law helped limit hazardous releases to a handful of relatively minor incidents . In Los Angeles , about 350 companies have been found to hold enough acutely hazardous chemicals to pose a potential public health threat if storage containers are damaged . About 200 that store the most dangerous compounds have completed the state-mandated risk management prevention programs to improve storage and responses to emergencies . &quot; In terms of hazardous materials it really went well , &quot; said David Zocchetti , manager of the hazardous-materials unit for the state Office of Emergency Services . &quot; In the last few years in Los Angeles a lot of resources have gone_into these programs . And it really showed. &quot; * The exceptions were a train derailment in Northridge that dumped two tankers of sulfuric_acid , the upending of laboratory chemicals at Cal State Northridge and a liquid propane leak near the Van Nuys Airport . The only serious injury came when a man was burned after a crude_oil pipeline ruptured and ignited in Pacoima . But many_more businesses reported no serious mishaps . Officials said the Anheuser-Busch brewery in Van Nuys demonstrated the value of preparedness . Three years ago the plant alongside the San Diego Freeway revamped an ammonia refrigeration_system in_order to limit any release of ammonia liquid or gas . Instead of a continuous loop for cooling beer , the system was divided into 25 separate compartments , each with automatic shut-off valves . When the quake hit , one damaged section of the cooling system was immediately isolated from the rest . Just 500 pounds of ammonia was released from a system that holds about 100 # 000 pounds , according to initial estimates . &quot; It could have been many , many times more , &quot; said one Busch official , who asked not to be identified . &quot; Someone manually would have shut_off the system eventually . We would not let_it_go on . But the system did_it automatically. &quot; Years of planning also enabled the city ' s electrical_system to emerge from the disaster virtually unscathed . As the quake rocked thousands of power_lines that crisscross the city , scores of transformers shorted out , showering the night sky with blue and white sparks . That touched_off dangerous electrical surges , which began backing_up through the power_grid , threatening to damage critical electrical facilities . The utility immediately went_into its &quot; automatic shutdown mode , &quot; turning_off power before it could cause any harm . Given the extraordinary force of the temblor , the process continued until the entire city was dark . But the system was saved . Within minutes , engineers began the process of cranking the system up again . Many residents had electricity within 38 minutes . By nightfall , 60 % of the city had power restored . And within 24 hours , 93 % of residents had power . Otherwise , restoring power from scratch , a so-called &quot; black start , &quot; could have taken days . The DWP avoided that in part because it has power-sharing compacts with utilities as far away as Oregon and Washington , said Marcie L . Edwards , an engineer at the DWP ' s emergency control_center . Routing power from these sources around the worst of the quake damage , DWP engineers were able to kick-start their own generators . By 8 a.m. , the first of the DWP ' s generating facilities was back in_operation . &quot; In the ( electric ) business that is almost unheard of , &quot; Edwards said . Lots of utilities use similar series of sensors and switches , she said , concluding : &quot; What ' s important is that ours worked. &quot;</TEXT>
