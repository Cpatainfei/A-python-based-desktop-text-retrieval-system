   <HEADLINE> U.S. GETS A SPECIAL_DELIVERY FROM COURIER ; TENNIS : HIS DEFEAT OF ELTINGH GIVES AMERICANS 3-2 DAVIS CUP VICTORY OVER THE NETHERLANDS AFTER KRAJICEK UPSETS SAMPRAS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jim Courier , rescuing the United States after a shocking loss by Pete Sampras , defeated Jacco Eltingh on Sunday in the deciding match of a Davis Cup quarterfinal against the_Netherlands . After Richard Krajicek defeated Sampras earlier in the day to keep the Dutch alive , Courier downed Eltingh , 6-3 , 6-4 , 4-6 , 6-1 , giving the United States a 3-2 victory in the best-of-five match competition . &quot; I didn ' t think I ' d have to play another live match , &quot; Courier said . &quot; But the bottom_line is we got the job done. &quot; It was an especially satisfying victory for Courier , who has struggled this year . &quot; It doesn ' t get any better than this for Jim Courier , &quot; said Tom Gullikson , U.S. Davis Cup captain . &quot; He ' s well on his way back. &quot; The Americans will play Sweden in the semifinals Sept . 23-25 . Sweden advanced with a 3-2 victory over France . The other semifinal will match Russia against Germany , the defending champion . Germany downed Spain , 3-2 , while Russia defeated the Czech Republic by the same score . The United States took a 2-0 lead Friday with easy victories by Sampras and Courier . But the_Netherlands evened it with a doubles victory Saturday and Krajicek ' s 2-6 , 7-5 , 7-6 ( 7-5 ) , 7-5 upset of Sampras , who is ranked No . 1 and this month won his second consecutive Wimbledon title . That left it up_to Courier and Eltingh to break the tie before a fiercely partisan crowd of 10 # 000 at a new hard-court complex next to the Rotterdam harbor . Courier , a two-time French Open champion , won the first set_in 30 minutes and took the second set by breaking Eltingh in the 10th game . On set_point , Eltingh appeared to hit a winner , but Courier chased down the ball , stretched to hit a tremendous passing_shot and then raised his arms in celebration . &quot; I thought everything was covered , &quot; Eltingh said . &quot; It was just a great shot. &quot; Eltingh came_back to win the third set , but Courier dominated the final set . After losing the first set against Sampras , Krajicek rallied to defeat the American in a battle of big servers . &quot; If I play well , I know I can beat anyone , &quot; Krajicek said . &quot; I proved that today. &quot; Sampras , coming_off an emotional Wimbledon , appeared to suffer a letdown against Krajicek . &quot; I feel a little mentally fatigued , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' ve played so many matches in the last month , it ' s taking its toll. &quot; Dutch fans chanted &quot; boring , boring , boring &quot; after Sampras served aces , and they repeatedly held_up play with &quot; the wave. &quot; &quot; The crowd was very hostile , but that ' s the way Davis Cup should be , &quot; Sampras said . &quot; I expected that. &quot;</TEXT>
