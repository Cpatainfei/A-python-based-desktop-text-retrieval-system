   <HEADLINE> FLIGHT-DELAYING FOG OUT -- BUT TRAFFIC ROLLING IN ; TRAVEL : CLEARING TODAY COMES IN TIME FOR THE START OF THE HOLIDAY RUSH AT JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT , HIGHWAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Forecasters say the thick morning fog that caused delays at John Wayne Airport for the third straight day Tuesday is over , just in time for holiday travelers to start packing the airport and freeways . &quot; This year is kind of funny since Christmas is_on a Sunday , &quot; said Bonnie Koch , owner of El Camino Travel in San Clemente . &quot; The heaviest travel will be the Friday before Christmas . . . . There are a lot of functions going_on ( Monday , Jan . 2 ) and everybody has to go_back to work_on ( Jan . 3 ) , so Monday ' s going_to be a busy day too. &quot; Last year , from Dec . 20 to Jan . 3 , a total of 280 # 093 people flew in and out of John Wayne . This year , more_than 300 # 000 are expected for the same period , said Pat Ware , spokeswoman for John Wayne Airport . Last year , when Christmas fell on a Saturday , the heaviest flying days were Wednesday and Thursday , with about 23 # 000 passengers using the airport each day , she said . On Tuesday morning , dense , patchy morning fog delayed flights for more_than an hour . The fog lifted about 8:30 a.m. , but not soon enough for passengers on a dozen flights whose takeoffs and landings were delayed . Airport officials are optimistic that travelers won ' t be affected today . &quot; The weather_forecast looks_like rain , and fog doesn ' t come_with rain , &quot; Ware said . &quot; Flights should not be affected since rain does not cause nearly as much of a visibility problem as fog does. &quot; An offshore flow kicking_in early Monday night drove fog away early Tuesday , and a 40 % chance of rain is forecast this afternoon and tonight with clearing Thursday . A chance of rain is also expected Saturday , with Christmas_Day being partly cloudy , said Curtis Brack , a forecaster with WeatherData , which provides forecasts for The Times . Highs will be in the 60s to low 70s , and lows will be in the upper 30s to mid 50s , Brack said . Travel_agents said weather has not had a big effect on their clients , many of whom bought tickets in the fall when some airlines were engaged in a price_war . &quot; Air fares have been so low , &quot; said Dianne LaPort , vice_president of operations for World Travel , which has 15 locations throughout Orange County and the Inland Empire . John Wayne Airport will be particularly busy this year because the May and November additions of Southwest Airlines and Reno Air have increased the options for travelers , Ware said . The airport now has 11 commercial airlines . Though the fog might not cause delays , airport officials are urging travelers to account_for the crowds by arriving_at least 1 1 / 2 hours early . Long-term parking is expected to fill by Thursday , so motorists are advised to park at a remote 1 # 679-space area on Main_Street between MacArthur Boulevard and Red Hill Avenue . A free shuttle will be available to take passengers to terminals , Ware said . More_than 300 hourly parking_spaces are also available immediately in front of the terminal for people picking_up family and friends . Skies may be clear , but roads may also be slick from rains . California Highway Patrol officers urge people to be cautious , check vehicles before setting_off , leave plenty of room between each vehicle and avoid drinking and driving . Police will be out_in force too . &quot; What we have starting Friday are maximum enforcement periods , &quot; which includes drunk-driver checkpoints , said Officer Joan Rivas , a spokeswoman for the California Highway Patrol in Westminster . Freeways with the most traffic will be those that lead out of the county , such_as the San Diego Freeway and the Santa Ana Freeway , said Kari Keul , spokeswoman with the Orange County Traffic Management Center in Santa Ana .</TEXT>
