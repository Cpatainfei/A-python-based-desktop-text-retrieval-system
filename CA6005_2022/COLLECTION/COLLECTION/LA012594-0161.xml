   <TEXT> At Orange County museums , officials say they use standard techniques and equipment to help guard against earthquake damage -- although , of course , none are guaranteed against the force of a major upheaval . Brian Gray , director of design and facilities at Newport Harbor Art Museum in Newport Beach , explained that the storage_area for paintings and large sculptures is padded , and &quot; everything is strapped down or bungee-corded. &quot; Smaller items sit on carpeting so they won ' t shift , and netting is placed around steel storage bins to catch anything that might fall_out . All the shelving units and files are bolted to the walls . Within the exhibition galleries , Gray said , portable wall systems are strapped to the ceiling and objects are &quot; as well attached as possible to the floor or exhibition furniture. &quot; At the Laguna Art Museum , according to Bolton Colburn , curator of collections , the on-site vault contains a compact storage system for paintings . The rows of racks rest_on wheels that are stabilized so as not to sway or jump_out of their tracks in the event of seismic tremors . Drawings are stored in boxes nestled on metal racks with safety lips guarding their edges . In the galleries , the Laguna Beach museum adheres small objects to their bases with museum wax or silicone . Paintings are secured with double sets of hooks ( screw_eyes and D-rings , the museum term for metal picture hangers ) . In some cases , the works are also attached with a plastic strap resembling an extra-strength hospital bracelet , which must be cut_to be removed . Brian Langston , marketing and public relations director at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana , said the 1992 addition to the building was designed &quot; to exceed all modern earthquake codes , &quot; and the collection storage system was specifically designed to be earthquake-resistant . Shelving rests_on big rubber wheels with miniature &quot; shock_absorbers , &quot; and all_of the shelves have attached netting . Exhibition cases in the galleries were designed with most of their weight concentrated_on the bottom , Langston said . Thick plexiglass covers the objects . Particularly valuable items are secured to their cases in four directions with lengths of monofilament line clad in a clear , bumper-like plastic tube and fastened with thin wire nails . &quot; The whole case would have to ( topple ) over for an object to be damaged , &quot; Langston said .
