   <HEADLINE> MOST INCUMBENTS FACE WEAK COMPETITION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A &quot; throw_out the bums &quot; attitude may be gripping voters nationwide , but most of the congressional and legislative officeholders in districts covering the San Gabriel Valley face only marginal challenges . Fund raising and voter registration strongly favor most incumbents . The area ' s hottest race pits Assemblyman Bill Hoge ( R-Pasadena ) against former Pasadena Police_Chief Bruce Philpott in a no-holds-barred mudfest . The other relatively close race has Rep . Carlos J . Moorhead ( R-Glendale ) , first elected in 1972 , facing a well-funded Altadena businessman who made a strong showing against the congressman two years ago . Rep . Jay C . Kim ( R-Diamond Bar ) is still the target of a federal investigation into possible violations of election , tax and labor laws , but he is expected to retain the seat he won two years ago . ASSEMBLY / 44th District Area : La Canada Flintridge , Pasadena , South Pasadena , Sunland , Tujunga . Registration : 45 % Democrat ; 43 % Republican . Candidates : Bill Hoge ( R ) , assemblyman ; Bruce Philpott ( D ) , retired police_chief ; Ken Saurenman ( Lib. ) , contractor . Background : Hoge , who won a close election two years ago against an underfunded challenger , is being taken_to the wire this time by a strong Democratic challenger , former Pasadena Police_Chief Philpott . Hoge , a conservative who has advocated putting the National_Guard on the border to stop illegal immigration and requiring the death_penalty for anyone committing three violent crimes , has considerably more money than Philpott . But Philpott has a lot of political currency in his standing as a former police_chief . And he has been hitting hard at Hoge for accepting more_than $ 100 # 000 in campaign donations from gambling interests and carrying gambling-related legislation . Philpott pledges to work for campaign reform to limit the influence of special_interests in the state Capitol . ASSEMBLY / 49th District Area : Alhambra , Monterey Park , San Gabriel , Rosemead . Registration : 61 % Democrat ; 25 % Republican . Candidates : Kim Goldsworthy ( Lib. ) , salesman ; Diane Martinez ( D ) , assemblywoman ; George H . Nirschl III ( R ) . Background : Like many of the other candidates , Martinez faced her toughest opponent in the June primary in her quest_for a second term representing the heavily Democratic district . Martinez scored a legislative victory recently when the governor signed into law her bill allowing the state to extend the Long_Beach ( 710 ) Freeway through South Pasadena without the city ' s approval . Martinez is expected to score an easy win_over her two opponents . ASSEMBLY / 57th District Area : Azusa , Baldwin Park , El Monte , La Puente . Registration : 57 % Democrat ; 30 % Republican . Candidates : David Argall , ( Lib. ) , newspaper deliverer ; Martin Gallegos ( D ) , chiropractor ; Frank Yik ( R ) , programmer . Background : This seat opened_up when Assemblywoman Hilda L . Solis ( D-El Monte ) decided to run_for state Senate . Democrat Gallegos , a chiropractor who runs his own clinic , emphasized his experience running a small business to win his party ' s nomination in a tough primary battle . Gallegos is expected to easily defeat Republican Frank Yik and Libertarian David C . Argall in the heavily Democratic district . ASSEMBLY / 59th District Area : Claremont , Covina , Monrovia , Pomona , San Dimas . Registration : 48 % Republican ; 40 % Democratic . Candidates : Margalo Ashley-Farrand ( D ) , lawyer ; Richard Mountjoy ( R ) , assemblyman . Background : Mountjoy is running in this Republican district at_the_same_time he is campaigning for the final two years of the Senate seat recently resigned by former Sen . Frank Hill . The conservative Mountjoy is expected to win both seats . If so , he would resign the Assembly seat he has held since 1978 . Ashley-Farrand has attacked Mountjoy for failing to drop_out of the Assembly race to spare voters the cost of a special election . ASSEMBLY / 60th District Area : Diamond Bar , La Mirada , West Covina , Whittier . Registration : 43 % Democrat ; 43 % Republican . Candidates : Paul V . Horcher ( R ) , assemblyman ; Andrew M . ( Andy ) Ramirez ( D ) , political consultant ; Michael L . Welte ( Lib. ) , engineer . Background : Horcher is expected to win his third term in the Assembly after losing a special election in September when he tried to move_up to the state Senate . Horcher , who calls a mainstream candidate , thinks his appeal_to moderates and conservatives alike will make the difference in this race . Voter registration favors Horcher because Republicans generally turn_out in higher numbers than do Democrats . ASSEMBLY / 61st District Area : Pomona , Ontario , San Bernardino County . Registration : 45 % Democrat ; 44 % Republican . Candidates : Fred Aguiar ( R ) , assemblyman ; Larry Silva ( D ) , counselor . Background : Aguiar ran unopposed in the June primary and comes_up against an underfunded challenger , Silva , in the general_election . Republican voter_turnout favors Aguiar winning a second term .

Hill , a Whittier Republican , resigned after being convicted of extortion , money_laundering and conspiracy . The archconservative Mountjoy , a strong backer of Proposition 187 , is expected to ride to victory on the back of the district ' s strong Republican registration .

SENATE / 30th District Area : Bell , Bell Gardens , Commerce , Cudahy , Huntington Park , Maywood , Montebello , Norwalk , Pico Rivera , Santa Fe Springs , most of South El Monte , South Gate , Vernon , Walnut Park and parts of Whittier .

Moorhead ( R ) , congressman . Background : The pundits expect this to be one of the closer races , but Moorhead is favored to win his 12th term . Voter registration favors the dean of the state ' s GOP congressional delegation because Republicans tend to turn_out to vote_in higher numbers than do Democrats . Moorhead is campaigning as a fiscal conservative and strong opponent of illegal immigration . Kahn , a capable fund-raiser , has put_out mailers in recent weeks portraying Moorhead as a member of a good-old-boys network that favors taxpayer-funded junkets . CONGRESS / 28th District Area : Arcadia , Claremont , Covina , Monrovia , Pomona , San Dimas . Registration : 46 % Republican ; 41 % Democrat .

CONGRESS / 34th District Area : La Puente , Montebello , Norwalk , Pico Rivera , Whittier . Registration : 62 % Democrat ; 28 % Republican . Candidates : Albert J . Nunez ( R ) , businessman ; Carl M . Swinney ( Lib. ) , radiologic_technologist ; Esteban E . Torres ( D ) , congressman . Background : The 34th District is heavily Democratic and Rep . Esteban E .

Kim ( R ) , congressman ; Ed Tessier ( D ) , businessman .

Kim is weathering the federal probe , which has produced no charges so far , with minimal damage . Political analysts say the district just has too many Republicans for Tessier to pull_out an upset . In addition to attacking Kim for his legal problems , Tessier has criticized the congressman for opposing recently passed anti-crime legislation , which banned various types of assault weapons . Kim maintained that the new law is not tough enough on crime . The congressman cites $ 11.3 million in federal grants for improvement to Chino and Ontario airports as some of the benefits he has helped bring_to the district .</TEXT>
