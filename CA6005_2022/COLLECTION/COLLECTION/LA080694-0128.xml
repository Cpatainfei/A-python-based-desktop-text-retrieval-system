   <HEADLINE> CANDIDATE VOWS REFORM OF MEXICO RULING PARTY ; ELECTIONS : THE PRI ' S ERNESTO ZEDILLO PLEDGES TO SEPARATE THE POLITICAL ORGANIZATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the 65 years that Mexico ' s ruling party has maintained a stranglehold on power , the succession process has come_to be known simply as &quot; the finger &quot; -- the anointing by sitting presidents of every political candidate from mayor to presidential hopefuls in closed party sessions that rendered elections little more_than formalities . But this week , with less than three weeks before the most hotly contested presidential race in more_than six decades , Ernesto Zedillo , the ruling party ' s candidate , vowed to cut_off the rite . Laying the cornerstone of a startling crusade to reshape the authoritarian image of his long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , Zedillo unveiled sweeping proposals that would , in_effect , revolutionize and deinstitutionalize the PRI . In a major address to party leaders , played_back to the Mexican people with a sense of national amazement Friday -- one tabloid declared in towering headlines : &quot; The End of the Finger ! &quot; -- Zedillo vowed to separate the ruling party from the government for the first time in six decades . He promised that , if elected , he will cede wide powers to states , municipalities and the new legislature that also will be elected Aug . 21 . He called_on his party to open_up its secretive process of selecting candidates , particularly in future presidential races . &quot; I want to be emphatic in my commitment that . . . I am resolved not to intervene , in any way , in the process of selecting candidates for the PRI , &quot; said Zedillo , 42 , who was himself chosen in a closed-door party meeting after Luis Donaldo Colosio , the then-PRI presidential aspirant , was assassinated at a March campaign rally . Declaring &quot; now is the hour of democracy , &quot; he indicated that , amid strong challenges from two of eight opposition parties contesting the elections , the PRI now has little choice but to modernize and liberalize from within . One illustration of the depth of Zedillo ' s proposed changes -- and the widespread suspicion that accompanied them -- was contained in a story Friday in Mexico ' s respected daily La Jornada . It described the scene at a campaign rally in the state of Chihuahua . &quot; Nobody believed it -- and few do believe it , &quot; the paper reported . &quot; The PRI party faithful , the journalists and politicians high and low murmured incredulously , ' Zedillo cut_off his finger. ' &quot; But Zedillo , who holds an economics doctorate from Yale , made_it clear he is serious about the reforms ; most Mexican political analysts say they are vital if the PRI is to fend_off the most strident electoral challenge to its rule since 1929 . At one point_after his Mexico_City speech , a group of journalists tried to joke with Zedillo about the proposal . &quot; How is your wound ? &quot; one asked . &quot; What wound ? &quot; Zedillo replied . &quot; The finger . You cut it this morning. &quot; &quot; You journalists never take anything seriously , &quot; he replied . Clearly , Zedillo ' s image-makers and the reform-minded factions in his diverse , amorphous party are taking his pledges seriously . His speech was just one of several major offensives the PRI is launching in the final phase of the grueling campaign . With polls showing Zedillo leading by only a narrow margin over his closest rival , Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the center-right National Action Party , and reflecting strong gains by the campaign of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas and his center-left Democratic Revolutionary Party , the PRI this week unveiled a sophisticated multimedia package to cast itself as architect of Mexico ' s transition to multi-party pluralism and true democracy . To be sure , there have been previous -- unsuccessful -- efforts at reform . Colosio , while party chairman , tried to introduce a system of primary_elections . But party hard-liners -- who are likely to oppose Zedillo on the issue as well -- rejected Colosio ' s proposal . The latest campaign includes a 45-minute video that was to be shown Friday to party members . Titled &quot; The PRI and Mexican Democracy , &quot; the video asserts the party &quot; has been the principal player in creating a modern multi-party system &quot; and &quot; is the first party interested in carrying_out a legal , transparent and easily verifiable electoral process. &quot; The presentation also stresses that the PRI has won elections not through corruption -- as_many Mexican voters suspect -- but because it is the only truly national party with support in every state , village and city_block . Zedillo ' s senior campaign aides said the pitch is designed for internal and external consumption ; one campaign official said the video was being distributed to all party workers to embolden them against accusations of corruption and electoral fraud . He added that a package containing the videocassettes and a booklet by the same name , also translated into English and French , will be given to the hundreds of foreign observers the Mexican government will allow to monitor the election for the first time . The new pitch also reflects the radical change in tone in Zedillo ' s speech to the party Thursday . Among the reasons for the PRI ' s survival , the package states , is the party ' s ability to transform and reform itself , noting its executive committee has had 31 presidents in its 65 years in power . &quot; This is the way Mexico has prevented political oligarchies , &quot; it asserts , &quot; and permitted a natural generational change in its leadership. &quot; But in a comment typical of the skeptical reaction to Zedillo ' s speech , opponent Fernandez told reporters at a campaign stop Friday in Poza Rica in the state of Veracruz : &quot; He must resign because he is a product of the finger. &quot;</TEXT>
