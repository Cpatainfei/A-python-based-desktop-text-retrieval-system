   <HEADLINE> Q &amp; A : DONALD JOHANSON ; LINKING OUR PAST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> That Holy_Grail of anthropology , the &quot; Missing Link &quot; between ape and human , is a misnomer . The Missing Link was actually found in 1974 . Its discoverer , anthropologist Donald C . Johanson , is the host and producer of an ambitious three-hour &quot; Nova &quot; documentary , &quot; In Search of Human Origins , &quot; airing Monday through Wednesday on PBS . From the Great Rift_Valley of central_Africa -- where most of the oldest human remains are found -- to the caves of southern France and the outback of Australia , Johanson ' s account of how the earliest human-like creatures survived and developed becomes a scientific detective_story taking the viewer back 3 million years . Villard has just published Johanson and his co-producer-wife Lenora ' s &quot; Ancestors : In Search of Human Origins &quot; ( co-written with Blake Edgar ) on which the documentary was based . Johanson talks with writer Robert Koehler about the challenges of the evolutionary hunt , TV-style . Is this the first television series to show how scientists trace evolutionary development ? Actually , no . Anthropologist Richard Leakey did a series on the subject about 15 years ago . But we ' re relating the state_of_the_art , so to speak , of current scientific_knowledge . We also wanted the series to be an adventure for the viewer , as we uncover clues along the way and draw as complete a picture as possible of the world our ancestors lived_in . Just as important was letting the viewer participate in the work of scientists , to see what it is they do . You ' re very concerned with how &quot; humanness &quot; developed in our ancestors , but you also seem interested in the very human disputes among scientists profiled in the program . In the ' 70s , when we announced the Missing Link we named &quot; Lucy , &quot; there was a lot of controversy , most of which circulated around Leakey and me . He and others questioned the legitimacy of our discovery . There seems to be an initiation period , when we need to look_at and study fossils and bones , and arrive_at conclusions . We announced Lucy in 1978 , but only five years ago was a consensus reached that , as I joke , placed Lucy on man ' s family_tree . What about the new debate which the series addresses ? It surrounds the &quot; Out of Africa &quot; theory , which contends that homonids developed in Africa , then spread through Europe , the Middle_East and Asia . Others dispute it . This is a very strong debate right now , and we chose two strong scientific voices to state their sides . There ' s Alan Thorne , who says that development occurred in many different places , such_as Australia , due_to the free exchange of genes across populations . And there ' s Chris Stringer , who supports the &quot; Out of Africa &quot; theory . In the program ' s third segment , we see the arguments raging at the London Royal Academy gathering . The sides are vocally opposed , and there ' s overt competition . What was your aim with this project ? The best example is in the second segment , in which we try to show that our ancestors weren ' t simply half-finished humans , nor impoverished hunter-gatherers , nor killer man-apes out of the &quot; 2001 &quot; story line , but were very well-adapted to their environment and able to survive within their own abilities . We might like to think_of ourselves as having emerged from noble hunters . But what is presented here is a very different view . There ' s very slim evidence that early humans were killer-hunters , and much more evidence that they were scavengers . How does a discovery of old bones , though , offer clues to our human identity ? Leakey ' s and Alan Walker ' s astonishing find of Homo_erectus showed us a creature with the pelvis size of Lucy , who is a much older species , but with a much larger brain size . Thus , the baby must be born immature with a small enough brain to fit through the mother ' s pelvis , and then grow after birth , requiring family care and a social_structure of empathy and caring . It ' s so interesting that this anatomical find gives us insight into human behavior and culture . Where does our violent urge come from then ? We can only guess , but I allude to it at the very end when I say that our modern capacity for culture has outpaced our biological evolution . What I mean is that , biologically and genetically , we are so related_to chimps and gorillas and Lucy . Yet there ' s been an enormous acceleration in culture and technology . I wonder if that imbalance isn ' t what accounts_for bizarre behavior like genocide and ethnic cleansing . &quot; In Search of Human Origins &quot; airs in three parts , Monday-Wednesday , at 7 p.m. on KVCR and 8 p.m. on KCET ; Tuesday at 7:30 p.m. ( Part 1 ) and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. and 8:50 p.m. ( Parts 2 and 3 ) on KPBS .</TEXT>
