   <TEXT> &quot; Will Ben always be merely the shadow of the man I used to know ? &quot; asks Kathy , 40 , a pale woman with dark circles under her eyes . &quot; I ' m grateful that he ' s alive , but he ' s in terrible pain . I don ' t know how we ' re going to go on. &quot; Two years ago , Ben , 43 , a construction worker , was part of the team rebuilding a freeway after the Loma Prieta earthquake . Somehow , a huge piling fell from a crane and landed on him , crushing his right leg and foot , smashing several vertebrae in his back and causing internal injuries . After months in the hospital and five surgeries , Ben moved_back home . Kathy , with the help of nurses and physical_therapists , took_over his care . For the next 1 1 / 2 years , their lives , as well as the life of their teen-age daughter , were put_on hold while all energies were focused_on Ben ' s recovery . He has made remarkable progress , and he ' s learning to walk again . But he will never be able to have an erection without first giving himself an injection of a drug . &quot; The spontaneity has disappeared from our sex life , &quot; Kathy explains , &quot; and that ' s killing both of us , although Ben refuses to talk_about it. &quot; Indeed , in the last few months , it seems that their marriage , which had always been strong and happy , is_on the verge of collapse . &quot; Ben says things I know he doesn ' t mean , and we ' ve been fighting constantly . I ' m so worn_out , but I can ' t sleep , and I just burst into tears over nothing , &quot; Kathy says . Ben is similarly upset , although it ' s harder for him to talk_about it . &quot; I ' m scared to death that Kathy is going_to leave me , &quot; he finally admits . &quot; We had such a good marriage , but now I can ' t even make_love to my wife unless I give myself a shot . What woman would put_up with that for long ? &quot; Maybe she should leave him , he says , half to himself . &quot; I ' ll be a burden to her all her life. &quot; &quot; Ben and Kathy are both suffering from depression , a common reaction to a crisis , &quot; says Robert W . Harelson , a marriage and family therapist in Lafayette , Calif . &quot; Whether a partner has had a heart_attack , a debilitating disease or , like Ben , a serious accident , there are common reactions and responses from which others can learn. &quot; With all their energies focused simply on surviving , many people in crisis bury their emotions and operate_on automatic_pilot . Because recovery from trauma can take a long_time , couples must find ways to maintain hope in the face of daily frustrations . The absence of hope , doctors say , can not only lead to depression , it can delay the healing process . If your family has endured a crisis , keep these points in mind : * Don ' t ignore the needs of the healthy while you ' re attending_to the needs of the ill . Kathy is actually more shut_down emotionally than Ben . She has switched her role from wife and lover to caregiver and nurse . It ' s time to reconnect with her friends and family as well as the activities that bring her joy . * There ' s no reason to go_through this crisis alone . What ' s more , denying your own needs won ' t help your loved one get better any faster . Don ' t hesitate to seek professional counseling for young children or adolescents who need help in sorting through their feelings . * Set_aside time to reminisce about the good times : the first time you met , your honeymoon , the births of your children . Music often helps rekindle happy memories , so play a tape you both enjoy . If possible , visit places where good experiences occurred -- a favorite restaurant , a theater or a park . If traveling is impossible , bring_in dishes from a favorite restaurant . * Get_in_touch with residual emotional pain . This exercise can help : First , find a quiet place . On a sheet_of_paper , each of you should complete the following sentences : The most painful part of the experience for me was . . . . What I need most and was unable to get was . . . . Discuss what you ' ve written and begin to sort through those feelings .</TEXT>
