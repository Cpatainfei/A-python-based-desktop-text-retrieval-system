   <HEADLINE> FEDERAL OIL LAWS FUEL FIGHT ; STATE PRODUCERS LOBBY TO LIFT U.S. CRUDE EXPORT BAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California ' s independent oil and natural_gas producers know how America could restore some balance to its trade with Japan -- if it weren ' t for a two-decade old federal law that they say is wrecking the market for their product . The law -- a legacy of the 1970s oil crisis -- virtually bans the export of U.S. crude . And that gives Alaskan oil producers little choice but to send all their oil south -- most of it to California . In an era of unrelentingly low crude_oil prices , the oil -- which otherwise could be exported profitably to Japan -- depresses prices for California crude by $ 2.50 a barrel or more beyond the already depressed world market_price , the independents say . &quot; Anywhere from 300 # 000 to 500 # 000 excess barrels of oil end_up in the California market each day , &quot; said Daniel P . Kramer , executive_director of the California Independent Petroleum Assn. , which represents most of the independent oil and gas producers in the state . And while the independents press a long wish list on state and federal policy_makers , overturning the ban -- which comes_up for review this year -- is at the top , he said . The independents made their case at a Sacramento event Tuesday , framed by an oil-drilling rig erected on the grounds of the state Capitol . They argue that by suppressing oil prices , the flow of Alaskan crude makes_it uneconomical to pump much of California ' s heavy crude_oil out of the ground . Besides unleashing California production , exporting the Alaskan oil could cut $ 2.2 billion to $ 3.6 billion a year from the U.S. trade_deficit with Japan , currently running at an annual $ 60 billion , the independents contend . Indeed , some high-ranking energy experts have called lifting the ban a &quot; no-brainer. &quot; But it may_not be easy to block its periodic renewal by Congress . Among the opponents are the politically powerful Seafarers International Union , whose members transport the Alaskan crude down the West Coast . Any Alaskan oil transported to Japan most likely would travel in foreign flag tankers . The Maritime Trades Department of the AFL-CIO , which includes the Seafarers and 41 other unions with a total of 8 million members , passed a resolution Friday that it plans to distribute to members of Congress . &quot; Three years have elapsed since the United States sent its sons and daughters off to war in the Persian_Gulf . . . . &quot; it reads . &quot; Ironically , at this critical juncture in our nation ' s history , an effort is under way to remove current restrictions on the export of Alaskan oil. &quot; The U.S. Department_of_Energy has launched a study of the idea and plans to hold public hearings next month in San Francisco and Anchorage before making a policy recommendation in April or May . The DOE will ponder how lifting the ban could affect crude prices and production , state and federal revenue , employment among both oil and maritime workers and tanker traffic . &quot; If the analysis concludes that lifting the ban would benefit independent producers , domestic production and the state , I would be a strong advocate , &quot; Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary said Tuesday . Beyond creating jobs , the unions say the ban has saved West Coast consumers &quot; billions &quot; of dollars , as lower oil prices translated into lower gasoline prices at the pump . * The independents point to a study they sponsored that predicts lifting the ban would raise crude prices both in California and Alaska , increasing domestic oil_production by a net 400 # 000 to 500 # 000 barrels a day . That could create 5 # 500 or more jobs in California alone , according to the study by Martin Carnoy , an education professor at Stanford_University , and Lenny Goldberg , a Sacramento-based consultant . Goldberg further contends that consumers -- in California and elsewhere -- would not notice any rise in gasoline prices if the ban were lifted . &quot; Prices at the gas_pump fluctuate with world market_prices , not regional crude_oil prices , &quot; Goldberg said . Less optimistic is gasoline marketing expert Trilby Lundberg . Using the independents ' own numbers , all else being equal , she figures that ending the ban would raise pump prices as much as 6 cents a gallon . The major oil_companies are mostly staying out of the fight for now . But the battered independents aren ' t likely to give_up easily . Jerry Hoffman , president of Taft-based Berry Petroleum Co. , said the company , which averages about $ 60 million a year in gross sales , paid $ 6 million and $ 8 million in federal and state taxes in 1990 and 1991 , respectively . &quot; This year we ' ll be filing for a refund , &quot; Hoffman said , &quot; and it ' s directly due_to government rules interfering in our business . The government is killing the goose that lays the golden egg. &quot; The Cost to California Producers California ' s independent oil producers say that Alaskan crude , forced into the state ' s market by a ban on U.S. oil exports , is depressing the price of their oil by an average of $ 2.50 a barrel or more . Chart compares the price of two grades of crude -- the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate and California ' s Elk Hills Stevens -- that are roughly comparable in the characteristics that affect cost . 1994 West Texas Intermediate : $ 14.24 Elk Hills Stevens : $ 11.70 Sources : Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserves , Bloomberg Business News Researched by ADAM S .
