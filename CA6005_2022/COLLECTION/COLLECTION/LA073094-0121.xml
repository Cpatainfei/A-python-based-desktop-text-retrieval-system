   <HEADLINE> CITYSCAPES / MATHIS CHAZANOV : VENICE BEACH JUGGLER DECIDES TO GIVE HIS CHAIN_SAW THE AX</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even the Venice Beach chain saw guy is not immune to mid-career crisis . After 11 years of parlaying his stupid human trick into a modest level of renown , Robert Gruenberg is putting_away the Sears Craftsman . Off it will go_into the garage ( his landlady thinks he ' s in the gardening business ) , along with the bowling_balls and a five-foot-long fake fish , all props for a wacky juggler who has long been a mainstay of the grungy stretch of beachfront tourist attractions . Gruenberg ' s loony , menacing persona is still on view for now , as he wears wraparound shades and flings machetes , bowling_balls and offensive gibes with abandon . But Gruenberg , 35 , a sidewalk comic who made his shtick into a widely accepted metaphor for self-inflicted , death-defying stupidity , is not kidding about his decision to hang_up the chain_saws . After the tourist season , of course . The gas-powered gag is artistically limiting , he says . Besides , his back hurts , he is tired_of the chain saw guy ' s hostile nature , he wants to provide better things for his 4-year-old daughter and he is dreaming of a transition to a &quot; Seinfeld &quot; -like TV_show called &quot; Chain_Saw Dad &quot; or simply , &quot; Gruenberg. &quot; &quot; I just want to leave while I have a hand left to wave , &quot; he says . &quot; that ' s sort of a cute line , but it ' s also sort of pathetic that I ' d have to do something that could hurt me to get people to watch me when I just want to be a comedian. &quot; Meanwhile , there are tourists to taunt , old_ladies to threaten ( &quot; Don ' t pretend you don ' t know me , Mom ! &quot; ) and members of racial and ethnic minorities to insult -- whatever it takes_to hold the attention of the fickle masses who drift up and down the beachfront like clumps of seaweed . that ' s the hard part : crowd_control ( &quot; Watch my show or I ' ll kill you &quot; ) and accounts receivable ( &quot; Kids , if your parents don ' t give you some money for me , it means they don ' t love you. &quot; ) . * The Torrance resident says he developed the chain saw routine to keep his mind focused_on his juggling . &quot; I was such a good juggler inside my bedroom , but when I got_out in front of people , I would drop everything , &quot; he says . &quot; But with the chain saw , I was so afraid that I would hurt myself that I was able to conquer my fear. &quot; Gruenberg ' s debut came at the height of a boom in boardwalk visits linked to the increased popularity of seaside roller-skating , says Bob Goodfader , longtime owner of the Sidewalk Cafe and other beachfront enterprises . The chain saw act has loomed particularly large , Goodfader says , because &quot; it ' s an extreme , which Venice is . He ' s one real extreme and he ' s got a show that people really watch. &quot; Even so , Gruenberg plans to quit despite a profitable run that included jobs in Las Vegas , TV commercials , appearances at corporate dinners and a spot on Johnny Carson ' s &quot; Tonight Show. &quot; Gruenberg says he intends to bid farewell to the boardwalk sometime in September , with a final flourish -- nude chain-saw juggling -- if friends will donate $ 10 # 000 to benefit AIDS care and research . Gruenberg , who won some unfavorable ink when the IRS came_after him one April on felony charges of understating his revenues ( he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor ) , takes_up the collection before the whirring chain saw starts flying . &quot; Come on , damn it , &quot; he mutters . &quot; I ' ve got a Porsche. &quot; ( The former operator of a used car lot really drives a secondhand Mercedes he bought for $ 700. ) Then he tapes shut the throttle and does his thing , flipping an egg , a half-eaten apple and the 15-pound machine from hand to hand , behind his back and under a leg . A skeptical volunteer from the crowd , meanwhile , lies beneath him on the sidewalk . &quot; I ' m insane , &quot; says Gordon Taub , 23 , who volunteered twice last week . &quot; He just picked me out of the crowd . I ' m looking_for work but I ' m not looking_for this. &quot; Why is the image of the chain saw juggler so striking ? &quot; It ' s almost like a metaphor come_alive , &quot; says Leo Braudy , a USC literature professor and author of &quot; Frenzy of Renown , &quot; a study of fame . &quot; It ' s like someone made_up the joke and he decided to do_it . . . to pull_together an image of chaos and turn it into some kind of artistic shape. &quot; Eric Mankin of Petaluma , a former machete juggler turned juggling impresario , says : &quot; It has the element of risking everything for something trivial , for the enjoyment of the crowd . He should bill it as ' Chain_Saw Juggler -- A Farewell to Arms. ' &quot; Venice civic_leaders recently named Gruenberg beachfront entertainer of the month , an honor worth $ 200 in prizes . But they say his departure will not mark a turning point for the popular seafront strip . &quot; I ' ve seen more new acts this summer than in the last two years , &quot; says Mark Ryavec , executive_director of the Venice Boardwalk Assn . &quot; We ' re down one chain saw juggler , but we still have Chad. &quot; Indeed , Chad Taylor , who occasionally jokes and juggles on the boardwalk , has also wielded a chain_saw from time to time . But he , too , is leery of defining himself by mastery of the noisy machine . &quot; ( Gruenberg ) is the main guy on the boardwalk , &quot; Taylor says . &quot; I ' m not that big on the Venice Beach chain saw title . I got_into it because everywhere you go and do a juggling act , people ask : ' Why aren ' t you juggling the chain saw ? ' &quot;</TEXT>
