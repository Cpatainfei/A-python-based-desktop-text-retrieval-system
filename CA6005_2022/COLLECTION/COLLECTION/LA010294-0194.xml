   <TEXT> Times readers recently were asked to gaze into their crystal balls and offer their predictions for the biggest challenges , personal and civic , of 1994 . Not surprisingly , crime , jobs and education figured prominently . Some readers also proposed detailed solutions . Below are excerpts from the taped TimesLink messages and faxes received over the past week . * &quot; I feel that the major issues in Orange County are getting guns off the street , reducing the violence and supporting education in the county. &quot; Nancy Hoy , Laguna Beach , 56 , Irvine Valley College professor * &quot; I see a lot of the ' us ' -versus- ' them ' mentality in Orange County -- Residents versus immigrants , developers versus environmentalists , rich versus poor -- and I ' d like to see greater unity and a more complete sense of community for 1994. &quot; Mary Litton , Costa Mesa * &quot; Orange County will have a lot more crime than we had this year , so I would like to see a lot of emphasis on crime . All cities ( should ) join forces and increase police presence . More search-and-seizures . A crackdown on gang members . Unless we do that , it will not be a safe county. &quot; Fares Batarseh , Anaheim , 35 , sales manager for a bakery * &quot; The 1994 year ( will give us ) the opportunity to reach_out to all segments of the population and also to make_sure that the 40 % of the population that is minority is fully integrated and becomes a player in everyday life in Orange County. &quot; Alfredo Amezcua , Santa Ana , 43 , attorney * &quot; I believe that crime and jobs will remain the watchwords for the year ahead , both for government and in our personal lives . Gangs and the mayhem and the loss of life they cause will unfortunately worsen our social fabric . As time goes_on , gang violence becomes more of an accepted fact of life than a disease befitting eradication . &quot; Jobs and their creation and retention will continue to be the other main source of concern . So many changes have occurred in 1993 with the passage of NAFTA and the loss of so many defense-related jobs that new and innovative ideas will need to come_to the fore. &quot; Bob Baker , Anaheim , 42 , operations analyst * &quot; The biggest 1994 challenge is education . Past programs have failed . Reason ? Sex-education classes of the 1960s and ' 70s have failed to reduce the teen-age pregnancies . Pregnancies have actually increased . Discipline , ethnic problems , manner of dress , drugs , gangs and individual student safety . . . need improvement . Families with these concerns should be free to place their student in another school . &quot; The backbone of this program would be that no felon would be released to the streets until they get provided with proficiency in reading and writing , &quot; he said . The land could also be used to build a reform_school for at-risk youth in addition to housing for the homeless , he said .
