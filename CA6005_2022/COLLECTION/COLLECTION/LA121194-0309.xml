   <HEADLINE> THE FOILED PEACE EFFORTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Diplomats from around the world have tried in different ways to bring peace to the war-torn Balkans , and especially Bosnia-Herzegovina . Here ' s a look_at some of these attempts : Vance Plan * Drafted in late 1991 while the Serb-Croat war was raging , the proposal of then-U.N. mediator Cyrus R . Vance called_for the deployment of 14 # 000 peacekeepers to areas of Croatia occupied by the Yugoslav army . Federal troops were to withdraw to rump Yugoslavia , local gunmen were to be disarmed , and an international peace conference was to be convened to negotiate a political settlement . U.N. deployment occurred in spring , 1992 ; some Yugoslav army troops moved_on to Bosnia-Herzegovina . Others , native to occupied territory , now referred to as the four U.N. Protected Areas , switched uniforms and deemed themselves the army of the Republic of Serbian Krajina , their rogue state . No international peace conference was ever convened because of the war ' s flare-up in Bosnia . Vance-Owen Plan * Late in 1992 , after Bosnian Serbs had rebelled against the country ' s proclaimed independence for eight months , Vance and Lord Owen , the European Community mediator , crafted a plan for settling the war in Bosnia by dividing the territory into 10 ethnically defined provinces ; three each were to be ruled by Serbian , Croatian and Muslim governments , Sarajevo to be jointly administered . The plan sacrificed Bosnia ' s multiculturalism and integration but preserved the fiction of a single federal entity within prewar Bosnian borders . The Muslim-led government accepted the plan reluctantly , but Bosnian Serbs rejected it each of four times it was presented as the international community ' s last offer for a peaceful settlement . Lift and Strike * Discussed during 1992 U.S. presidential campaign , lifting of the arms embargo hampering Bosnian government defenses and launching North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization air strikes to neutralize the Serbs ' heavy_weapons were threatened as an alternative to the Vance-Owen plan if Serbian rebels refused a negotiated settlement . But European allies resisted this , fearing it would put Bosnian-based peacekeepers at risk of retaliation or hostage-taking . Washington Action Plan * On May 22 , 1993 , a week after the Bosnian Serbs had given final rejection of Vance-Owen in a referendum , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher met with counterparts from Britain , France , Russia and Spain to urge another round of negotiations to settle conflict without resorting_to use of force . Owen-Stoltenberg Plan * With Vance retired from mediation after failure of his original plan to win combatants ' backing or enforcement by the international community , former Norwegian Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg took_over the U.N. mediator role . He worked with Owen in revising the Vance-Owen plan to address Serbs ' demands for contiguous territory . A final map emerged in the autumn , proposing to divide the republic into three autonomous regions , each with right to eventually annex to a neighboring country . This clearly applied only to Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Croat segments . Sarajevo was to be under U.N. administration , Mostar governed by the European Community . The government refused for months to endorse what it considered ethnic partitioning . U.S. diplomats privately assured Sarajevo they were not forcing them to sign . The government capitulated only after mediators promised massive NATO troop deployment to enforce the deal envisioning the return of refugees to many areas from which they had been expelled in &quot; ethnic cleansing. &quot; Serbs , who had tentatively endorsed the plan , began demanding &quot; quality &quot; as well as &quot; quantity &quot; in territory , insisting on better shares of utilities , industrial centers and access to the Adriatic_Sea . Their final rejection came at an EC foreign_ministers meeting Dec . 23 , 1993 . Contact Group * After a diplomatic impasse following failure of Owen-Stoltenberg and ultimatums by NATO prohibiting heavy_weapons around Sarajevo and Gorazde , the international community formed another mediation team . Mediators from the United States , Britain , France , Russia and Germany used the Owen-Stoltenberg map as a starting point , but reconciliation of Muslims and Croats eased partitioning by reducing the factions from three to two . Contact Group ended_up proposing a roughly even split of Bosnia between Serbian rebels and new federation of Muslims , Croats and non-nationalist Serbs . Federation was to control 51 % of Bosnian territory and rebels 49 % . But only the federation had &quot; confederation rights &quot; to join in economic and political alliances with neighboring countries . Federation also was to retain Bosnia ' s U.N. seat and other international memberships . The government reluctantly agreed to the split in a parliamentary vote_in July . Serbs again rejected it in their parliament and in a late August referendum .</TEXT>
