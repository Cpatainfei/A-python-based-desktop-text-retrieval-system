   <HEADLINE> HOT NEW ARENA FOR TAKEOVERS IS BANKRUPTCY ; MERGERS : OPPORTUNITIES LIKE R.H. MACY &amp; CO . ARISE AS SUITORS DEAL WITH -- OR BECOME -- CREDITORS OF DISTRESSED COMPANIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Going_after a company that ' s under bankruptcy court protection -- as Federated Department_Stores is doing with R.H. Macy &amp; Co . -- isn ' t buying on the cheap . Experts say it ' s a complicated and costly way of doing a takeover , merger or acquisition , and one with significant risks . Yet , merger and bankruptcy experts alike predict a steady and increasing stream of such acquisitions , including takeovers that appear at first blush to be unwanted -- as in the Macy-Federated situation -- or downright hostile . Why bother with the added legal expense of dealing with a company in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , with potential long delays and a court system known to have little patience for hostile advances ? The answer is simple : opportunity . Bankruptcy Court is the place to find vulnerable companies these days , said Paul S . Aronzon , an attorney who heads the bankruptcy practice of Milbank , Tweed , Hadley &amp; McCloy in Los Angeles . &quot; So_much of corporate America has been put_in the position of having a bad balance_sheet , &quot; he said , &quot; that this has become a natural arena to look_for acquisitions. &quot; Many companies , he said , have been driven to seek Bankruptcy Court protection by the debt-based merger mania of the 1980s . Before that , an investor or company with money to spend probably would n ' t have gone_through the trouble that dealing with bankruptcy court poses . Now , companies in financial distress are too plentiful to ignore , Aronzon said . Taking_control of a company when it ' s down on its luck is not new . Old Mr. Potter tried to do_it to George Bailey ' s Building &amp; Loan in &quot; It ' s a Wonderful Life , &quot; and scions J.P. Morgan and John D . Rockefeller actually succeeded in building their empires on the backs of others ' misfortunes . But within the setting of the modern day Bankruptcy Court , such takeovers are just beginning to blossom . Mainly because of creditors , the group whose interests generally must be satisfied first in Bankruptcy Court procedures . Some creditors become anxious when a company languishes in bankruptcy without developing a plan of reorganization and emerging from court protection . In such cases , it often is easy for those with takeover intentions to buy_up the debt at a deep discount and gain standing with the court . Although it is not easy , said bankruptcy experts , creditors groups can now petition the court to end the bankrupt company ' s exclusive_right to develop a reorganization plan and can propose one of_their_own -- one that could favor an outside suitor . At nearly two years , Macy ' s bankruptcy is &quot; a little long in the tooth , &quot; said Jeffrey Chanin , president of Chanin &amp; Co. , a bankruptcy investment banking firm with offices in Los Angeles and Westport , Conn . &quot; It ' s a complex , large ( case ) and as it starts pushing past two years , people . . . want a solution , their patience starts running out. &quot; Still , other creditors are becoming more sophisticated and are able to use the bankruptcy laws to their advantage , said Ron Orr , a partner at the Los Angeles firm of Gibson , Dunn &amp; Crutcher and head of its bankruptcy practice . Often , creditor groups may encourage competition for control of a bankrupt company , knowing that heightened bidding could raise the amount they get_back on their debts . Takeovers in bankruptcy , said Orr , could become a vital creditors ' tool . &quot; If Federated proceeds and looks_like it has a possibility of winning , the Macy ' s management may try to cut a deal . Or , if Federated goes_forward and succeeds , creditors in the future could threaten ' to do a Federated ' &quot; on other companies , he said . Federated , owner of Bloomingdale ' s and several department_store chains -- and a chief competitor of Macy ' s in many Eastern cities -- purchased $ 449.3 million of Macy ' s debt from Prudential Insurance Co . of America and has an option on an equal amount . Owning some of Macy ' s $ 6 billion in debt essentially makes Federated an owner of Macy , but more importantly , gives it an opportunity to participate in structuring and approving its reorganization plan . Macy so far has received Federated ' s interest coolly , as it previously has rebuffed other potential suitors . Anyone considering an unwanted takeover of a company in bankruptcy has to be concerned about how negatively its attentions are perceived by the court . Bankruptcy judges have in the past have refused to allow some debt-buying prospective acquirers to participate in the reorganization process , questioning the good_faith of the interloper ' s motives . On the other hand , a seemingly hostile_takeover can become friendly , if enough of the creditors come_to favor the takeover terms . Such was the case in the reorganization of the Revco discount drug store chain , in which creditors ultimately sided with a group led by investor Sam Zell . The Zell Chilmark Fund also took_over department_store operators Carter Hawley Hale when it emerged from bankruptcy in late 1992 , in a deal that was_well received by Carter Hawley ' s management . Despite the pitfalls , takeovers in bankruptcy will increasingly become a viable option , some attorneys said , for acquiring companies without the consent of management . Among the advantages is the general notion that it ' s easier to appeal_to creditors than shareholders who were the focal_point of takeover wars in the 1980s . Also , potential suitors have an easier time getting a good look_at a bankrupt company ' s innermost details , because of the extensive supportive documents a company seeking Chapter 11 protection must provide . But it ' s for that very reason that James McTevia , a Detroit area consultant in business restructurings and bankruptcies , believes companies will try harder to restructure its finances without resorting_to bankruptcy -- and risking a hostile_takeover .</TEXT>
