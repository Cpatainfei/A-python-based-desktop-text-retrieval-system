Source : Morgan Stanley Capital International MEXICAN STOCKS The market managed to ignore the steep downdraft in U.S. stocks , as the Bolsa inched up 11.44 points to 2 # 457.59 on Tuesday . But a bigger rally early in the day -- on news that former Education Minister Ernesto Zedillo will succeed the slain Luis Donaldo Colosio as the ruling party ' s presidential candidate -- faded toward the market close . * The appointment of Zedillo , 42 , had been expected ; investors believe that he will continue the free-market economic_policies of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari . But it isn ' t clear that the beaten-up Bolsa can mount much of a rally soon , simply based on Zedillo ' s candidacy . The Bolsa Index Tuesday closes : 2 # 457.59 Source : D.A.
