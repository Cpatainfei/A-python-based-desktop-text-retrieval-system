   <TEXT> Sex in the ' 90s is certainly not simple . Not that sex has ever been simple . But combine the fear of AIDS with the epidemic of sexually transmitted diseases ( STDs ) and the changing cultural roles of men and women , and you end_up with a confused and weary society of singles . What , exactly , are contemporary attitudes about sex and dating ? One study reports that the AIDS epidemic has had a chilling effect on the sex lives of singles . But companion surveys report that promiscuity is as popular as ever . One thing is certain , based on interviews with singles and relationship experts : Attitudes toward sex and relationships have become more conservative . Equally certain is that this change in mores doesn ' t always translate into a change in behavior . &quot; I was in my early 20s in the late ' 70s , &quot; said Rebecca , a 36-year-old single attorney in Ventura . &quot; That was the time of disco and the Village People and one-night stands . that ' s what everyone did and they didn ' t think_twice about it. &quot; Rebecca said that for the last five years , she has thought much harder before getting involved with a man . &quot; The last three years , the warnings about getting AIDS have been deafening , &quot; she said . &quot; My friends and I all talk_about needing to be careful. &quot; Still , Rebecca admitted that within the last six months she had unprotected sex with someone she didn ' t know well and hasn ' t dated since . &quot; I did_it because I guess I just wanted an attachment , and I had_sex , because that ' s what he wanted . Passion or need or loneliness motivate us to do stupid things in the face of all_the facts. &quot; Andy , a 38-year-old screenwriter , said he is more concerned about protecting himself against AIDS and STDs than he was in the past , but he also said that he has had unprotected sex within the last six months outside a monogamous relationship . &quot; I didn ' t see her as a promiscuous woman , so I didn ' t really worry about it , &quot; he said . But Andy , who lives_in Los Angeles , said dating has changed a lot since the days of the &quot; three-date rule. &quot; &quot; In the past , I would have expected to sleep_with a woman by the third date , if not before , &quot; he said . &quot; Now , I would n ' t expect it , and in fact , I would worry if she did sleep_with me on the first date. &quot; Andy said that although he ' s looking toward marriage , he would have_sex with a woman he didn ' t know or like much , if he was attracted to her . But he would wear a condom . &quot; Men are still men , &quot; he said . &quot; They basically want to sleep_with every woman they see. &quot; Sound crass ? Psychologists say that despite the conservative trend in sexual_activity and warnings about the dangers of unprotected sex , people continue to operate emotionally in the same way they always have . Which is why , psychologists say , many heterosexuals who are well-educated about AIDS still think they are immune to it . &quot; In some ways , the heterosexual community doesn ' t believe it is affected by AIDS , &quot; said Wanda von Kleist , a Chicago psychologist who counsels many singles . &quot; There is a lot of denial , because they have not had as_many deaths as the gay_men ' s community . In the heterosexual community , the majority of people do not use condoms or safer_sex because they do not believe they will get it. &quot; What has changed in the past few years , thanks to the AIDS epidemic , is women ' s ability to say no , Von Kleist said . &quot; It ' s more socially acceptable for a woman to say upfront that she doesn ' t want to have_sex , &quot; she said . &quot; For a long_time , women felt_like if they said no , something was wrong with them . I think now women have an opportunity to say what they want. &quot; Debra , a 33-year-old actress who lives_in Hollywood , said she insists that a man wear a condom and get not one but two AIDS tests . She said she has_sex less often now , partly out of fear and partly out of_her_own changing attitude . &quot; I do feel freer to say no now , and I ' m more likely to than I would have in the past , &quot; she said . &quot; And when it comes_to AIDS , I take it very seriously -- I ' ve had a good friend die from it . Men tend to think I ' m accusing them when I tell them to get an AIDS test -- but most men are more careful with pregnancy than they are with AIDS . Because they ' re at less risk to getting AIDS. &quot; The more conservative swing in sexual behavior has also affected the way men and women relate to one another . In the ' 60s and ' 70s , sex was used so freely and casually that many people never really got intimate , psychologists say -- people substituted sex for intimacy . Men and women are now forced to deal with each other in a different way . &quot; Both sexes are definitely more cautious about having_sex , &quot; said Stanley Teitelbaum , a New York psychologist who specializes in sex and relationships . &quot; For a long_time , many people used sex as a way to relate , instead of relating and then having_sex . So people who had problems relating used sex to cover_up those difficulties . They can ' t do that so freely and readily anymore. &quot; But the most blatant changes in attitudes about sex and dating can be seen in the gay_men ' s community . Michael Koth , a 38-year-old professional trainer , remembers the days when everyone in the gay community was &quot; footloose and fancy free &quot; when it came_to sex . &quot; You could go_in any alley in certain neighborhoods and cruise certain areas and see all kinds of sex , &quot; said Koth , who has delivered 172 eulogies for friends who have died of AIDS . &quot; Everyone went_to sex clubs and bath houses every night . It was just so_much a part of how everyone lived. &quot; Koth , who lives_in West Hollywood , said he and his friends practice safe_sex and are now much more aware of their sexual behavior . He added that AIDS has forced many in the gay community to seek deeper relationships rather than relating through promiscuity . Still , he said , there are people who don ' t take AIDS seriously . &quot; There is a whole new phase of young people who seemingly don ' t care , who think that they ' re invincible , &quot; said Koth , who tended bar in gay and straight clubs across the country in the late ' 70s and early ' 80s . There is also a new_wave of sex clubs popping_up around L.A. and New York , he said . Although management supplies condoms and posts safe-sex rules on the walls , there is no way of really monitoring and enforcing people ' s behavior . &quot; It ' s more discreet than it used to be , &quot; he said . &quot; But I ' m sure people are still practicing unsafe sex. &quot; One of the high-risk groups for contracting HIV are teen-agers , who , psychologists say , are scared but also maintain a high level of denial . &quot; The more they find_out about STDs and AIDS , the more their heads are saying that they need to be more conservative , &quot; said Lorraine Sterman , a Los Angeles psychologist who counsels adolescents . &quot; But their bodies are no different than teens ' bodies have always been -- raging with hormones . It ' s a very , very ambivalent situation. &quot; Sterman said the major problem is &quot; teen-age omnipotence. &quot; &quot; Teens think they are omnipotent , and they think , ' It won ' t happen to me , ' &quot; she said . &quot; In the past , the worst that could happen was that they got pregnant -- now they can die . And it ' s such an overwhelming thought , they tend not to think_about it. &quot; Susan , a 17-year-old high_school senior at a Catholic_school in Orange County , said many of her friends are sexually active , but that they are more afraid of pregnancy than of AIDS and STDs . &quot; A lot of my girlfriends are_on the pill . But people are not concerned about AIDS -- it ' s not a part of our lives here , &quot; said Susan , who added that although her friends know they need to use protection , they often don ' t . &quot; A lot of my friends will get drunk , and then their judgment is not great , &quot; Susan said . &quot; One girl in our school got pregnant , and it was a very big deal . A lot of kids are embarrassed to buy protection , so they use the withdrawal_method , which is stupid . But a lot of people don ' t think anything can happen to them. &quot; Despite the problems and the very real fears facing this generation , there are many valuable lessons available for those who choose to learn them , psychologist Teitelbaum said . &quot; It ' s more important in the ' 90s than ever before to develop those qualities in yourself that give you good judgment , to use your perception , to know what the other person is about , &quot; he said . &quot; You need to know who you are getting involved with , to tune_in rather than tune out . If people are more forthright , and put their needs and concerns on the table , that can be a positive step toward building healthy relationships. &quot; DATING ( SOCIAL )</TEXT>
