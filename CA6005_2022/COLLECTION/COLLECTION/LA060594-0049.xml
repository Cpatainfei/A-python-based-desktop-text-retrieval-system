   <HEADLINE> NEW RELEASES ; * * * * ; MARIAN MCPARTLAND-CLARK TERRY , &quot; PIANO JAZZ &quot; ( JAZZ ALLIANCE )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The latest and certainly one of the best in the transcriptions of McPartland ' s &quot; Piano Jazz &quot; radio series , this entertaining hour finds trumpeter Terry in estimable form as soloist , vocalist and raconteur . Reminiscing about his days with Duke Ellington , his invention of the hilarious &quot; Mumbles &quot; vocal styles and his work in jazz education , he fields questions from his ever-charming interviewer . Terry solos , often with a mute , on several originals , such_as &quot; Michelle &quot; ( no relation_to the Beatles tune ) , &quot; The Simple Waltz &quot; and &quot; The Snapper. &quot; McPartland , in addition to backing him , offers a piano solo , her own engaging &quot; There ' ll Be Other Times. &quot; Rounding_out the hour are such standards as Eubie Blake ' s &quot; Memories of You &quot; and Ellington ' s &quot; Come Sunday. &quot; ( These award-winning programs deserve CD reissues in their entirety. ) Albums are rated on a scale of one star ( poor ) to four stars ( excellent ) .
