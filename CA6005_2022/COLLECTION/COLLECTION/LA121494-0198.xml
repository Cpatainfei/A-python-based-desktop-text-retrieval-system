   <HEADLINE> THE BATTLE FOR BREANA ' S LIFE ; FOR 23 MONTHS , THE MCDONALDS OF IRVINE HAVE JUGGLED HOPE AND DESPAIR . EVEN AS THEIR DAUGHTER ' S LEUKEMIA SURGES , MEDICAL ADVANCES AND A NEW SISTER MAKE THE TODDLER ' S RECOVERY A DISTANT BUT POSSIBLE REALITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The shudder lifted Frank McDonald ' s head_off the pillow . He rolled_over but couldn ' t drift back to sleep . Something ' s wrong , he thought , as he sat_up and looked_around the dark room in Children ' s Hospital of Orange County in Orange . Frank and his wife , Jan , had learned much in the past year while shuttling their gravely ill daughter from one doctor ' s office to the next . They could rattle_off obscure medical terms or navigate through a morass of insurance forms and regulations . More_than that , they could recognize that cold whisper of dread that signals trouble . When you have a child on the edge , no sleep is deep . On that Friday after Thanksgiving , Frank stepped toward the bed of his 23-month-old daughter , Breana . In the dim light he saw his child atop the starched white sheet , surrounded by a shadow . He flicked on the light and saw she was lying_in a pool of blood that had trickled out of a transfusion device feeding into her chest . &quot; I about lost_it , &quot; the 34-year-old U.S. Marine said . &quot; I pushed the button for help and ran_out into the hallway shouting for the nurses. &quot; Help arrived in time , and Breana , again , had dodged a bullet . &quot; I was sure we had lost her , after all that ' s happened , all we ' ve been through , &quot; Frank said . Shadows have been around beautiful Breana Kay McDonald since the day she was born , so slight and weak , with Down ' s syndrome and a hole in her heart . Her first year was rough , marked with harrowing seizures , but her prognosis after corrective heart_surgery in April , 1993 , was decent . Then the news came earlier this year , landing with a numbing thud in the hearts of her parents : Breana had the early stages of leukemia . Since that day , the odyssey for the Irvine parents and child has been alternately inspiring and wrenching . The battle to save Breana , a battle not yet resolved , will only be won if she has her cancerous bone_marrow replaced -- an area of medicine that has seen some landmark advances and successes in recent months . The McDonalds only have to look in the room next door to Breana ' s room at CHOC to see the benefits of these cutting-edge techniques . Her neighbor is Aida Jacinto of Glendale , a 6-month-old who is recovering nicely from an experimental procedure performed by Breana ' s doctor to halt her leukemia with a megadose of marrow cells . Farther away but even closer in situation is 5-year-old Christy Schwartz , a Cleveland girl getting a second chance at life thanks to her newborn sister . Doctors plan to replace Christy ' s tainted marrow with an infusion of rich , marrow-producing blood culled from the umbilical_cord delivered during her sister ' s Nov . 22 birth . Breana was slated last month to receive that very same treatment , which has been performed fewer than 70 times worldwide . Frank and Jan had their second child , Mariana , on Nov . 1 , and specialists were_on hand to collect , test and freeze the cord blood that was a close genetic matched to Breana . But before the transfusion could be performed , Breana ' s leukemia , which had been dormant , surged . &quot; I don ' t know ; I was kind of expecting it , &quot; Jan , 25 , said the day after the test results arrived with the worst news possible . &quot; Something told me not to go buy a turkey at the commissary . Something told me we ' d be spending Thanksgiving at the hospital. &quot; Breana will be at CHOC throughout the holidays . She is a_couple_of weeks into two months of chemotherapy , a treatment she may_not survive because of her weak heart . If she does weather the barrage of chemicals and radiation , and her leukemia goes_into remission , she will again be eligible for the extraordinary cord blood procedure . The technique has the potential to change the way leukemia and other marrow disorders are treated , eliminating lengthy searches for donors and the painful process they undergo to surrender marrow . Evidence also suggests that cord blood , taken from afterbirth that is typically discarded , makes_for a safer transplant , reducing the chance of rejection . For the McDonalds , the dazzling promise of the cord-blood technique was a high-tech life_preserver they clung_to during the months before Mariana ' s birth . They coped_with Breana ' s roller-coaster health by reassuring themselves that everything would be fine , just as long as the leukemia stayed dormant until they had the cord blood . &quot; All these things were going_on , the pregnancy and keeping_an_eye_on Breana , &quot; Frank said . &quot; The clock was ticking . Then we got the cord blood , but before they could use it , well , I guess we just ran_out of time . Now we have to see if she can make_it through the chemo . It ' s all_in God ' s hands , again. &quot; &quot; We Would Do Whatever We Had To. &quot; Jan McDonald knew even before she looked_at her firstborn for the first time . She had known for three days , since the dream . She had seen a giggling girl , maybe 4 or 5 years old , standing beside a Christmas_tree surrounded by brightly wrapped gifts . The child ' s face was familiar , somehow , and it was different than most youngsters ' . &quot; You could see she had Down ' s syndrome , &quot; Jan remembered , trailing a finger down her own cheek . &quot; Her face . . . You could just tell . that ' s when I knew. &quot; A few days later , the delivery room team was busy over the minutes-old child , who had swallowed a great_deal of blood during the delivery . Jan looked past their gloves and pump and studied her daughter ' s features . &quot; I told Frank right then . He looked but wasn ' t sure , but I was. &quot; The couple had been married for four years . His stint as a Marine helicopter mechanic had taken them from South Carolina to Hawaii and then , in 1992 , to Orange County . They were scared when doctors confirmed Jan ' s intuition . &quot; We didn ' t know anything about it all , what it meant really for us or Breana , &quot; Jan recalled . &quot; We knew we loved her , though , and we would do whatever we had to. &quot; Breana was a month old when her parents watched her stiffen and go wide-eyed for the first time . The seizures were part of the medical baggage that often accompanies Down ' s , as were the coronary problems . The troubles worsened two months later when a wall separating chambers in Breana ' s heart blew_out . The McDonalds were seeing their world change . Other matters were quickly eclipsed by the onslaught of medical problems . They were far from their families back East , so they managed on_their_own . Some good friends and Marines stepped_forward to help . The couple found themselves edgy most of the time , tired and drained , living day to day , clinic to clinic . While the Marine Corps was sympathetic and helpful -- a program for parents of ill children allowed Frank to juggle his schedule and remain at_home when his unit was shipped overseas -- the government ' s insurance programs were less cooperative . Jan spent long , tense hours on the phone trying to sort_out the mess . A toll was being taken_on the couple . Their relationship was tested by short-fuse frustrations , and they found little time for themselves . On Jan . 28 , though , they set_aside some rare time for each other . They didn ' t know it at the time , but they were creating their second child and , maybe , a second chance for Breana . &quot; The doctor called later that same night , and we had to rush_off to the hospital because Breana ' s blood work came_back , &quot; Frank said . &quot; When they said ' leukemia , ' the room started spinning for me . I had to grab a chair to keep_from failing over. &quot; The clock was ticking . The cancer was in a latent stage but could surge at any time . Doctors hurried Breana into a second heart_surgery they had hoped could wait until she was older and stronger . There was no time to wait . They needed her heart to be ready for the arduous months ahead , should chemotherapy be needed . The National Bone_Marrow Registry in Minnesota began screenings to find a potential match for Breana . The playful , tow-headed girl would need a transplant to quell the leukemia , doctors agreed . Jan and Frank and their relatives underwent DNA tests , but they didn ' t offer the perfect match doctors were seeking . Then , when Jan discovered she was pregnant , a new , better option -- the cord blood technique -- became available . Envisioning Two Healthy Daughters The big day , Nov . 1 , began badly . Jan was scheduled to undergo a Cesarean to deliver her second child at 2 p.m. , but the McDonalds arrived_at the hospital early in the morning . Breana , fidgety and cranky , needed her weekly blood work to chart the status of her nascent leukemia . As soon as Breana saw one of the brightly decorated , closet-sized phlebotomy labs at CHOC , she began to squirm and wail . She recognized the room , and the familiar feel of the rubber strap wound around her arm , and she wanted no part of it . &quot; One of the hardest things is watching her get poked and prodded all_the time , &quot; Frank said , as he caressed Breana ' s head and nuzzled her bright red cheek . &quot; We can ' t explain to her either why all this is going_on , why Mommy and Daddy let her get hurt all_the time . Some days are worse than others , but it ' s never easy. &quot; Breana ' s face was flushed as the lab technician , a woman with a gentle voice , tried to win_over the little_girl with offers of candy and a colorful sticker . Breana threw the candy back at her . Jan held onto Breana ' s legs as the technician probed the crook of the little_girl ' s elbow , searching for a vein . &quot; She ' s been irritable the past few days , &quot; Jan explained . &quot; I think she senses something big . She can tell we ' re anxious , and it makes her anxious , I guess. &quot; After three tries , the needle found a vein . But after a_few moments , the woman shook her head disapprovingly as she tapped the small vial . &quot; I didn ' t get enough . we ' ll have to try the other side. &quot; As the edgy parents watched , the tech worked_on the other arm . Finally , it was over . Frank and Jan were visibly drained as they made their way past the parents and children in the noisy hallway . Breana was withdrawn , sobbing and half asleep . &quot; Not a good way to start the day , &quot; Jan said . The parents dropped a sleeping Breana off at the house of some friends and headed back to the hospital . They were worried , because the child had never been away from them before , and wondered how she ' d take it when she woke_up and they were not there . The excitement and anxiety that surround any birth were doubled by the stakes riding_on the cord blood collection and matching . In the end , though , everything went_off without a hitch . Mariana , 9 pounds , 6 ounces , announced her arrival to the entire nursery with a set of very healthy lungs . The doctors were all smiles as they filed_out of the delivery room with a hearty amount of cord blood , ample for their needs . Frank beamed behind his surgical mask as he watched his new daughter grip one of his fingers . &quot; She ' s beautiful , isn ' t she ? &quot; he asked of everyone in range . Mariana met her sister the next morning . Jan held the tightly bundled baby next to her on the hospital_bed as Breana pointed at the newest family member and giggled . Tests began on the cord blood . Early indications were that the match was not perfect but was close enough to proceed . Dr. Mitchell Cairo , director of bone_marrow transplantation at CHOC , said the infusion could take_place after a_few weeks of tests and preparation . The McDonalds envisioned a Christmas with two healthy daughters . The Mood Was Gray No one noticed the lump in Breana ' s cheek until some family friends visited the McDonalds on Nov . 5 , Frank ' s birthday . The visitors had with them their little boy with a round face that drew coos from Frank . &quot; Your daughter has chubby cheeks , too , &quot; the boy ' s mother cheerfully countered . &quot; That really surprised me , &quot; Jan said , &quot; because Breana ' s always been so thin , we ' re trying to fatten her up . We looked and , sure enough , from where they were sitting , it looked_like she did . It was just one chubby cheek , though. &quot; Breana stuck her tongue out playfully the next day when a new specialist peered into her mouth and studied the growth . It could be a side-effect of tooth formation , he said , shining a light in the girl ' s mouth . Or , the parents knew without hearing it , it could announce the arrival of full-blown leukemia . The mood was gray when the worst news comes_back . &quot; We were just a little late , &quot; Frank said aloud , but to himself . Any cord blood miracle would have to be put_on hold . The couple tried to put_on their best face when Jan ' s mom , Kay , arrived from Georgia to help_out and to , as she said before her voice trailed off , &quot; see Breana , just in case . . . . &quot; Two days before Thanksgiving -- and a day before Breana was readmitted to the hospital for her first bout of chemotherapy -- the McDonalds and Kay took Breana to CHOC for a_battery of tests and preparation procedures . They were joined by a friend , Michelle Vallens of Los Alamitos , who brought burgers and fries . The weary parents took turns eating_at a concrete picnic bench outside the clinic . Sitting at the table , Jan stared up at the afternoon blue_skies and offered a halfhearted smile . &quot; Frank and I both know that she might not make_it , &quot; she said . &quot; But we just tell ourselves that if she goes , she goes_to God , to heaven , where she won ' t suffer anymore . It comforts me ; it makes_it easier . I don ' t know that I could make_it any other way. &quot; Vallens , a friend who met the McDonalds through church , was sitting across from Jan . Vallens lost her son , an 8-year-old with cerebral_palsy , last year to chronic_renal_failure . &quot; The last time I was ( at the hospital ) was the night my son , Jonathan , died , &quot; Vallens said . &quot; This is like a nightmare revisited . I came_down when I heard about Breana , but it ' s not easy being here . Even if you have strong faith , it is so hard to understand how these things happen. &quot; Jan nodded . &quot; I know. &quot; Heaven Was Guaranteed The next day Breana was checked_into a sterilized , &quot; clean_room &quot; on the third floor oncology ward at CHOC . Before entering the ward ' s glass-walled rooms , all visitors scrubbed thoroughly and donned a surgical mask , made less ominous by its pink and blue teddy_bear design . The McDonalds adopted a new schedule : Frank worked all day at the Tustin Marine Corps Helicopter Air_Station while Jan stayed_at the hospital with Breana and Mariana . In the evening , Frank arrived for his shift and spent the night while Jan and the infant headed_home . The couple saw little of each other , and their fatigue and worry was visible . The first round of chemotherapy had little visible impact on Breana . While her health was fragile , she retained an impish love of getting_into things . She giggled wildly each time she tried to pull the surgical masks off nurses and visitors in her version of peek-a-boo . To someone who didn ' t know her , only the medical gear and tubes suggested she was ill . That would change , the doctors said . &quot; They said her hair will start falling_out after the next round of chemo , &quot; Jan said while fetching the toys Breana had gleefully scattered across the floor . &quot; So far , though , the only thing we ' ve seen is her appetite go_down . She won ' t eat fruits or vegetables anymore . She still likes ice_cream , though. &quot; The McDonalds have to don gloves to change Breana ' s diapers or risk skin burns , a chilling fact that hammers home exactly how powerful are the chemicals coursing through her system . &quot; Oh , and there ' s one other thing . . . she has these now , &quot; Jan said , pointing to freckle-like dots that formed a triangle on Breana ' s right cheek . The dots are tattoos that will help guide radiologists when they begin bombarding the lump with radiation . The radiation can damage healthy body tissue and lead to painful sores , so the doctors want to target it precisely . While Jan and Breana played , several television_camera crews filed past the door on their way to see the little_girl in the next room , a 6-month-old Glendale girl named Aida , also in the care of Dr. Cairo , who had been in all_the newspapers that morning because an experimental bone_marrow technique had saved her from leukemia . The technique used for Aida was different from the cord blood procedure Cairo and company plan to use on Breana , but Jan could only see similarities between the two sick girls . &quot; What a coincidence , huh ? Right next door , &quot; Jan said . Jan joked that the media would be visiting both rooms if things had been different . Then , &quot; I hope everything works_out for that family. &quot; As the camera crews adjusted their bright lights and tried to coax a smile from the infant , Jan craned her neck to get a glimpse of the beautiful child , who was being held by a nurse . &quot; I hate cameras , so I guess it ' s just as well. &quot; Frank , ever gregarious and outgoing , had met another youngster on the ward , an 11-year-old named Brian who was at CHOC for his second bone_marrow transplant . The first failed . &quot; I met him one day , and the next he was standing in our room when I woke_up , &quot; Frank said . &quot; He said he was bored . I could tell he was lonely , so I played with him a while , and we talked . He ' s a sweet little kid. &quot; The precocious youngster , a veteran of the hospital scene , had plenty of advice to share . &quot; He told me about different painkillers , what to tell the nurses and what effect the medications would have_on Breana , all kinds of stuff . Breana can ' t tell us what ' s going_on with her , so he helped me understand it a little bit. &quot; Then the boy asked Frank for some advice . He said in a matter-of-fact way that he knew he would die if his second transplant failed . What he was wondering , he said , was if he would go_to hell . Frank was taken_aback , then reassured his new friend that he was in no danger of going_to hell . When it was Brian ' s time to go , Frank continued , heaven would be his destination . Guaranteed . &quot; He seemed to feel better after that . I felt_like it was a good thing for me to be there when he needed someone . I felt_like I gave him something , &quot; Frank said of the boy , who still awaits a transplant . Frank paused and thought for a moment about that gift , and about the dozen youngsters on the ward where his daughter will spend her Christmas , maybe even her Jan . 4 birthday . &quot; The thing I pray for is that God would heal every kid in the hospital or at least not make them feel the pain , even if it ' s just for a little while , &quot; Frank said . &quot; There ' s a lot of pain there . Too much. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Transplant Alternative When bone_marrow becomes diseased , it must be replaced . Harvesting blood_cells , called cord blood , from umbilical_cords and placentas offers patients with cancer or genetic_disorders an alternative to the traditional bone_marrow transplant . * Removing Cord Blood Cord blood extraction harms neither the newborn nor the mother . It is performed after birth and typically culls about 8 ounces . 1 . Placenta and umbilical_cord are moved to the lab ; syringes are inserted and blood withdrawn . 2 . Blood is processed to isolate stem cells , which contain the building_blocks necessary for regenerating blood and marrow . 3 . Stem cells are stored until needed and then intravenously infused into patient , normally in the chest area . * Cord Blood over Bone_Marrow Unlike bone_marrow , stem cells culled from cord blood are not genetically encoded and therefore can be used with less closely matched recipients . Other advantages : * Cord blood is less likely to have graft-versus-host disease , when immune cells from transplant attack the patient . * Patients with smaller donor pools , including minorities , have access to larger donor pools through cord blood_banks . * Siblings are more likely to be donors . Deep in the Bone Bone_marrow , a soft , fatty_tissue found in bone cavities , is the body ' s blood factory . It is either red -- consisting_of red and white_blood_cells and platelets -- or yellow , mostly connective_tissue and fat .
