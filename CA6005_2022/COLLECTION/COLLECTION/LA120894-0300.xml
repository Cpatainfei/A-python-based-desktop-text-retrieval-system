   <HEADLINE> FRANCE ASKS U.N. TO DRAFT PLAN FOR BOSNIA PULLOUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Declaring negotiations to end the Balkan crisis at a &quot; total impasse , &quot; the_French government said Wednesday that it has asked the United Nations and NATO to draw_up a detailed withdrawal plan for the 24 # 000 U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia-Herzegovina . French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe told the National Assembly here that the U.N. force , which includes 5 # 000 French troops , &quot; has done everything it can &quot; to end the conflict peacefully . And he said an evacuation would be a &quot; high-risk operation that will require reinforcing troops on the ground first. &quot; Juppe acknowledged that &quot; the decision which we are being forced into will mean war , more unhappiness and more suffering , &quot; adding that he feared the Balkans will be &quot; set_ablaze &quot; in the near future . The foreign_minister ' s gloomy assessment , which followed a flurry of visits to European capitals to discuss the crisis , came as NATO said it will ask member states how many troops they could supply to a mission to evacuate U.N. peacekeepers . A force of at least 20 # 000 , and perhaps many_more , would be required to withdraw the U.N. Protection Force , alliance officials said . With pressure mounting for a withdrawal , mission officials in the former Yugoslav federation discovered Wednesday that they had lost even the ability to retreat , as a partial pullout from embattled Bihac collapsed before it got started . The thwarted attempt to &quot; temporarily redeploy &quot; half of the 1 # 200 Bangladeshi troops out of Bihac stemmed from a decision made within the U.N. military hierarchy in Zagreb , Croatia , sources there said . In recent days , Juppe has blamed the United States for inflaming the conflict with talk_of lifting a U.N. arms embargo that has kept the Muslim-led Bosnian government from defending the country against a 32-month rebellion by heavily armed Serbs . Despite Juppe ' s forecast that no settlement is likely , Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic told a news_conference at his headquarters in Pale , just east of the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo , that he is prepared to resume stalled negotiations in_view of &quot; new interpretations &quot; being made by the five-nation Contact Group of a plan offered in June on a take-it-or-leave-it basis . Juppe and other politicians from countries contributing troops to the peacekeeping force have recently suggested that the Bosnian Serbs should be allowed to join their conquered territory to neighboring Serbia . That right of confederation was denied them under the original plan drawn_up by the Contact Group , which is composed of the United States , Britain , Russia , France and Germany . Karadzic tied his rebels ' return to negotiations to a lifting of U.N. sanctions on allied Serbia , but his hints of assisting the U.N. peacekeepers in an unhindered evacuation were likely to appeal_to those now scrambling for a way_out . Troop-contributing countries , including many from NATO , have been alarmed by the surge in hostile actions against U.N. peacekeepers , mostly by the Bosnian Serbs , who hold nearly 350 troops hostage and have thousands of others surrounded . Bosnian Serb gunmen in Banja Luka did resolve the most serious of the hostage situations Wednesday when they released a sick Jordanian military observer , Maj . Zaid Hussein Fayed , after a Russian officer volunteered to take his place . The Serbs had reneged_on a promise they made Monday to release the major , who has been bedridden with a heart ailment since Nov . 30 . Instead , on Tuesday , the rebels seized a Spanish captain offered in his place as well as a Czech major supervising the hostage swap . The Jordanian and the Czech were released late Wednesday , said U.N. mission spokesman Paul Risley . With the Russian , there are now four captive military observers in Banja Luka . Systematic humiliation of the U.N. peacekeeping force has intensified withdrawal planning , officials at U.N. mission headquarters in Zagreb said . The provocations prompted mission commanders to propose evacuating half of the undersupplied Bangladeshis , who are caught between attacking Bosnian Serb forces and Croatian Serb rebels seeking to starve and freeze them out of the U.N. &quot; safe area &quot; they were deployed to protect . But a U.N. request to bus out 600 soldiers over six nights -- 100 soldiers a night -- failed to gain support from any of the factions that could endanger such a withdrawal , one U.N. official said . Without the cooperation of the armed forces that surround them , neither withdrawal nor redeployment would be possible , as has been made clear by the weeks-long blockade by Croatian Serb gunmen preventing Dutch troops from reinforcing the Bangladeshis in Bihac . The proposal to withdraw half of the Bangladeshi battalion was described by mission spokesman Michael Williams as a move under_consideration because of the poor state of provisions . The troops have little food and no fuel and are confined to quarters because of a lack of winter coats and defensive weapons -- shortages aggravated by the Croatian Serb blockade . The frustration level at mission headquarters in Zagreb has been palpable , as civilian and military_leaders examine their escape routes and find them all wanting . &quot; We can decide to do anything we want . We can decide that pigs can fly , but unless they sprout wings it ' s not going_to happen , &quot; spokesman Risley said of the Bihac reduction that mission headquarters wants but cannot achieve . &quot; We can decide whatever we want , but the reality is that we have very limited options. &quot; A senior Western diplomat from a troop-contributing country said the mission is working feverishly with NATO on emergency pullout plans . &quot; It ' s going_to be a mess . You ' re going to have women and children blocking the roads with their bodies . We are not going_to be able to simply drive_out of here , &quot; said the envoy . One U.N. official familiar_with the withdrawal planning said a number of scenarios have been prepared_for , including a swift and surreptitious retreat . &quot; A hasty withdrawal plan is one that takes_place in the worst of environments , where two things are of importance : speed and stealth , &quot; the official said . &quot; Under a hasty withdrawal plan , you make no attempt to save equipment . . . . The priority is to save the lives of peacekeepers and allow_for their safe evacuation. &quot; But even the most thorough contingency planning has failed to chart a secure course out of the deteriorating Bosnian conflict , especially in places like Bihac where the Serbs clearly want U.N. troops out of the way while the poorly defended government supporters want to hold_on to what is at least a psychological shield . Bosnian Serb gunmen and the Croatian Serb rebels collaborating in attacks on Bihac would probably facilitate a U.N. withdrawal &quot; with conditions , &quot; the U.N. official said . For example , they would gladly provide safe passage out through the occupied Krajina region of Croatia for the Bangladeshis as long as they take with them their armored personnel_carriers , weapons , radios , communications_equipment and other gear of military value . The Krajina Serbs are also expected to demand that all U.N. troops leave , rather than just half , removing the main impediment to a Serbian conquest of the Bihac pocket .
