   <TEXT> Today ' s menu of local album releases includes Will Brady ' s one-man acoustic blues effort ; &quot; Homespun : A Collection of Fullerton Artists , &quot; a collaborative project involving five bands and three poets ; and a recording of the blues-rock Rhythm Lords . Ratings range from * ( poor ) to * * * * ( excellent ) . Three stars denote a solid recommendation . * * * Various Artists &quot; Homespun : A Collection of Fullerton Artists &quot; Homespun Productions Compilations are scattershot by nature , but this one , an attractively packaged showcase for five bands on the non-punk side of Fullerton ' s alternative scene , has a good ratio of hits to misses . Born too late for the free-form , freak-flag-flying ' 60s , Plato ' s Stepchildren attempt to re-create the mood of a hippie coffeehouse or a late- ' 60s college radio_station where the pot was a bit too plentiful . The instrumentalists , mainly on bongos and acoustic_guitars , try to keep a sense of coherence , but it ' s undermined by singers who spend too_much time letting_out whoops and animal noises as if they were part of a kindergarten class exercise in unfettered self-expression . One suspects that the Incredible String Band might have sounded like this in its most precious and diffuse moments ; one also suspects that the ISB had the good_sense not to release anything it recorded at such moments . Moe ' s Art , fronted jointly by Al Olefer and former Don ' t Mean Maybe member Jeff Fairbanks , takes_in some familiar indie-rock territory with its three tracks . While the songs aren ' t stunning , the band rocks cleanly and with an edge . It throws_in enough jarring shifts to remind everybody why Fairbanks ' old band often was compared to the Minutemen , but it more_than balances any arty inclinations with its solid grounding in such reliable sources as the Rolling Stones , the Meat Puppets and the Velvet Underground . Trip the Spring goes two for three : &quot; Felt &quot; never finds a center for Kevin Dutton ' s theatrical declamations , but &quot; Long Yellow Weeds &quot; ( urban pastoral , nice sense of innocence and wonder ) and &quot; Motel Limbo &quot; ( urban afflicted , believably tormented ) make_for good bookends . Some might find Dutton ' s earnest , stagy style a_bit_much ( think_of David Bowie and Jethro Tull ' s Ian Anderson , with a touch of the Celtic airy quality of the Incredible String Band ' s Robin Williamson thrown_in ) , but his voice is distinctive , and when he has a good role he is effective . The band is very strong instrumentally , with a firm and flexible rhythm_section and a bevy of artful touches from lead guitarist John Kraus . Moonwash Symphony comes_through with a beautiful , hymnal air , &quot; Nightingale , &quot; that front_man Shon Sullivan sings mostly in German . It ' s hard to believe a melody this lovely wasn ' t borrowed from the European folk-classical tradition , but if Sullivan came_up with it himself , he ' s to be congratulated . &quot; Try &quot; rides a darkly tunneling , Joy Division-like bass line and finds its way to some catchy melodic hooks as it evokes a moment of romantic crisis . Gentle seduction through strong craftsmanship is the band ' s method , and it works . Room to Roam , in contrast , is a boisterous , bash-it-out crew . But it also knows how to throw_out a strong melodic hook . &quot; Leap of Faith &quot; and , especially , &quot; Fall Again &quot; have the combination of humability and roughed-up alarm that are the stuff of many_a KROQ hit . The loose , hard-driving attack works well ( but the drumming shouldn ' t be quite this sloppy ) . Interspersed between band segments are readings by three poets . Michael Mollo and Tom Rush are outraged by the usual stuff that outrages anti-Establishment types , and they express said outrage in the usual way ( Rush is a respectable performer of his apocalyptic vision , &quot; In the Time of the Plague &quot; ) . The one worth hearing more of is Mark Obermeyer , who oozes sarcasm but is sufficiently funny and inventive in his wordplay to get_away with it . &quot; Orientation , &quot; his ridicule-heaping response to therapeutic attempts to reverse the sexual orientation of gay_men , scores its intended ironic points but is memorable mainly for the fun he has doing_it . * * 1 / 2 Will Brady &quot; Next Door to the Blues &quot; ( cassette ) A lack of money , not talent , is the only problem with this solo-acoustic debut by Brady , a veteran singer-guitarist from Laguna Beach who formerly played rock with Honk and traditional blues in the Brady &amp; Siegel duo . He has drawn all but one of these 12 tracks from performances along his usual round of club and coffeehouse gigs . Brady plays an amplified acoustic_guitar with lots of reverb effects to give it more bite -- probably a necessity in the pubs where solo performers have to contend with the chattiness of cafe society . On record , though , it means getting used to a guitar sound that has too_much brittle snap in the treble strings and too_much boom in the bass . With that caveat , Brady has come_up with a tasty collection . The song selection -- drawn mainly from good , traditional outside sources but avoiding the too-familiar -- is varied in_style , mood and tempo . Brady delivers everything in a clear , nuanced voice that carries his own interpretation rather than trying to mimic his sources . &quot; Beatin ' Like a Tom-Tom , &quot; an Ernie K . Doe song , is a sad-eyed little gem that Brady milks for innocent charm . A Mance Lipscomb rag-blues , &quot; Good as I Been to You , &quot; finds Brady willing to spice rural blues with a touch of urban jazz . &quot; Ha-Ha in the Day Time , &quot; a wry lament by Percy Mayfield , hits some crying notes a la John Hammond that capture the speaker ' s real sense of hurt . Brady plays it straight with unvarnished , if somewhat restrained , regret on_his_own composition , &quot; There ' s Nothing I Can Do About It Now. &quot; He excels with rhythmic , rocking guitar work and more traditional blues solo licks ; some of his jazzy sorties are less effective as he breaks_away from a song ' s rhythmic base and fails to make the lone guitar swing . Compared to vibrant live-in-studio recordings by such solo blues acts_as Paul Geremia and Robert Lucas , Brady ' s album isn ' t next door to ideal ; it ' s pretty far down the block . He deserves a shot at recording under optimal circumstances . ( Available for $ 10 plus $ 2 shipping from Will Brady , P.O. Box 9065 , South Laguna , CA 92677-9065 ) * * 1 / 2 Rhythm Lords &quot; Happy Hour &quot; Rebecca Records It ' s hard to find a distinctive niche in the well-mapped world of blues-rock ; this band from Long_Beach and Orange County hasn ' t found one yet . But with their first full-length album , the Rhythm Lords at least are carrying_on a wide search for something to call their own . Front_man Dale Peterson offers original songs in a variety of styles , including a Stevie Ray Vaughan-like tense , swirling shuffle ( &quot; The Bell Has Tolled &quot; ) , a Looziana swamp-fever workout ( &quot; Voodoo Queen &quot; ) and a jumping , Chicago-blues instrumental showcase ( &quot; Happy Hour &quot; ) . The Rhythm Lords also move_in some unpredictable directions , covering dark , dire songs by Tom Waits ( &quot; Down Down Down &quot; ) and Bob Dylan ( &quot; Everything Is Broken &quot; ) . So far , though , the magic formula that would separate this group from the large pack of worthy aspiring roots bands hasn ' t turned_up . That doesn ' t mean that fans of bands such_as the Paladins , the Fabulous Thunderbirds and the James Harman Band won ' t find things to enjoy on &quot; Happy Hour. &quot; Peterson has a solid , husky blues voice , and his guitar playing is consistently nimble , emphatic and tasteful ( there ' s none of the egotistical show-for-its-own-sake that bogs_down less worthy contenders ) . In his best original , &quot; Pay His Way , &quot; Peterson brings a laconic gallows humor to bear as he captures the sense of frustration and vulnerability pervading neighborhoods where street crime is out of control . Band member Eric Von Herzen , who has been heard on several of Social Distortion ' s bluesier tracks , gives the Rhythm Lords a second able soloist , and the rhythm_section plays with a snap that lives_up_to the band ' s name . Good production abets the crisp playing . So what ' s the missing key that would turn all this ability and integrity into something special ? It ' s inspiration , something nobody can pinpoint or describe until it suddenly appears . Sometimes it arrives when bands honor their calling and keep plugging_away long enough to stumble upon it . ( Available from Rebecca Records , P.O. Box 3301 , Long_Beach , CA 90803 , ( 310 ) 987-1050 ) . * The Rhythm Lords will open the Orange County Blues Festival Oct . 1 at 11 a.m. at Doheny State Beach in Dana Point .</TEXT>
