   <HEADLINE> U.S. STRIKES DEAL WITH JAPAN TO OPEN MARKETS ; TRADE : BREAKTHROUGHS IN FOUR KEY AREAS ARE HAILED AS A GENUINE MILESTONE . BUT TOKYO ' S FAILURE TO AGREE ON AUTO-RELATED EXPORTS COULD STILL LEAD TO SANCTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a dramatic end to a tense round of trade diplomacy , the United States and Japan reached a series of agreements Saturday that Clinton_Administration officials said would crack open the lucrative Japanese market for four major U.S. industries and generate billions of dollars in new exports . Twenty hours of overnight negotiations , concluded only minutes before senior Japanese officials were about to return to Tokyo , produced surprising breakthroughs in every area under discussion with one significant exception : The two sides could not come_to terms over autos and auto parts . These exports account_for two-thirds of America ' s $ 60-billion annual trade_deficit with Japan . With no progress achieved on automotive issues -- a senior trade official said the Japanese &quot; weren ' t ready to be serious &quot; -- U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said he would take steps that could lead to the imposition of sanctions on Japan . The penalties , if imposed , would be intended to force Japan to increase its limited purchases of replacement parts made in the United States . Prime_Minister Tomiichi Murayama , speaking_to reporters in Tokyo , said &quot; it is extremely regrettable &quot; that the United States decided to take steps toward sanctions over the auto parts issue . &quot; They were insisting that we relax our auto inspections , &quot; Murayama said . &quot; But as we cannot relax safety ( standards ) , we were not_able to yield. &quot; However , the auto parts impasse was overshadowed by the progress made on other fronts , as government officials and business_executives cheered the sudden turnabout in an angry relationship that had been sliding toward the brink of a trade war . The agreements will make_it easier for insurance_companies to do business in Japan , for manufacturers of medical and telecommunications_equipment to sell their products to the Japanese government , and for makers of flat glass , used in automobiles and construction , to enter a lucrative market that had been virtually closed to them . &quot; This is a good_deal for the United States and a good_deal for Japan , &quot; observed Kantor , a view he said was shared by President Clinton . In the view of U.S. officials and outside trade experts , Saturday ' s breakthroughs represent a genuine milestone . After nearly 15 months of bickering , the two countries , whose trade relations produce ripple effects that span the globe , have agreed on a system to measure the success of foreign firms in gaining access to the Japanese market . Japan has long been considered one of the most difficult markets to enter . Despite its government ' s assurances to the contrary , U.S. trade officials say , the door is barricaded by a combination of bureaucratic regulations , unofficial standards and other , often invisible , barriers . Despite what U.S. officials have characterized as a history of backsliding by Japan on previous trade agreements , a buoyant Kantor said he is confident the new accords will stick . &quot; These agreements will not only work , they ' re results-oriented , they ' re tangible , they ' re concrete , &quot; said Kantor , who presided over nonstop negotiations that began at 3 p.m. EDT Friday and concluded at 11:05 a.m. Saturday . &quot; They ' ll be effective. &quot; Clyde Prestowitz , a former trade official and frequent critic of Japanese trade practices , said the agreements &quot; put U.S.-Japanese relations on a new plane . It ' s a win-win proposition. &quot; Prestowitz said the agreements should halt the dramatic rise in the value of the yen against the dollar , a phenomenon that has made Japanese products increasingly expensive in the United States . The Japanese currency began climbing to new highs against the dollar when a U.S.-Japanese summit fell_apart amid bitter recriminations last February . In addition , he said , Japan &quot; gets credit internationally for being forward-looking and flexible. &quot; Another prominent critic of Japanese trade practices , House Majority_Leader Richard A . Gephardt ( D-Mo. ) , said &quot; another wedge was driven into the Japanese market &quot; as a result of the new accords . &quot; It ' s clear when the U.S. really stands_up , Japan opens_up , &quot; Gephardt said . Even so , he added , the agreements &quot; still only address a small percentage of our trade problems. &quot; The senior members of the Japanese delegation , Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and Foreign Minister Yohei Kono , headed_home immediately after the talks . In a brief meeting with Japanese reporters , Hashimoto said the agreements would help smooth often-difficult U.S.-Japanese relations across the board . The goodwill should spill beyond trade to encompass political and diplomatic issues , he said . Japanese officials emphasized that the agreements avoid setting specific &quot; numerical targets , &quot; an initial U.S. objective that Tokyo had vowed for months to block . But U.S. officials said the accords will make_it possible to gauge the openness of Japanese markets . &quot; The Japanese government for the first time is committed to use objective , quantitative and qualitative criteria to evaluate the progress made under these agreements , &quot; Kantor said . The impasse over measuring progress has been the biggest hurdle during the 15 months since Clinton visited Tokyo in July , 1993 , and launched the current round of negotiations . In the final hours of their talks Saturday , the two sides agreed there must be &quot; progress in the value and share &quot; of foreign goods and services in the Japanese market , with a goal of achieving &quot; over the medium term , a significant increase in access and sales. &quot; &quot; There is no difference_of_opinion as_to what that means , &quot; Kantor said . &quot; The idea of ' progress in value and share ' cannot be misinterpreted. &quot; Kantor said the agreements will work as follows : * Japan will open_to foreign manufacturers the process by which it purchases telecommunications_equipment , an $ 11-billion market in which Japanese companies get 95 % of the business . * In government purchases of medical equipment , Japan will allow fair bidding and provide a complaint mechanism for foreign firms that feel they have been treated unfairly . The medical equipment sector is dominated by the United States , which accounts_for 52 % of global sales of such products but only 23 % of the Japanese market . Increasing that share to 40 % would generate an $ 440 million more a year in sales , U.S. officials said . * Japan will reform its insurance regulatory system , introduce unspecified liberalizing measures and strengthen its antitrust policies . The changes are designed to open the world ' s second-largest insurance market in which foreign companies account_for only 3 % of all policies sold . * Japan will open its $ 4.5-billion flat-glass business to foreign producers . Over the past 20 years , U.S. officials said , three Japanese companies have maintained exactly the same market shares -- 50 % , 30 % and 20 % . Japan also agreed to promote greater use of insulated glass and safety_glass , products in which U.S. companies are considered leaders . Only the rough parameters of the agreement have been worked_out so far , and &quot; there is a lot of negotiating that will need to be done &quot; over the next month , a senior trade official said . But even an agreement in principle represents progress , industry officials said . &quot; The principles are excellent . It should have a significant impact on U.S. sales in Japan , &quot; said Ralph Gerson , executive_vice_president of Guardian Industries Corp. , a large glass manufacturer in Michigan . Although no agreement was reached in the automotive arena , there have been limited signs of progress in market penetration . Ford announced last week that its sales in August were 152 % higher than a year earlier . Still , U.S. auto sales in Japan remain minuscule . Kantor said that regulatory barriers to foreign replacement parts make_it &quot; nearly impossible for competitive foreign auto parts producers to break_into the Japanese market. &quot; Japan buys 2.6 % of its replacement , or &quot; after-market , &quot; auto parts from foreign companies ; in the United States , 47 % of these parts are imported . Any decision to impose sanctions over the auto impasse would proceed under Section 301 of U.S. trade laws . The first_step , which could take_up to a year , would be an investigation of the problem and additional negotiations with Japan . Kantor , citing Japan ' s cooperation in other sectors , refrained_from using the &quot; Super 301 &quot; provision , in which Japan would have been given the stigma of an &quot; unfair trader. &quot; Andrew H . Card Jr. , president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Assn. , said he is &quot; marginally encouraged &quot; by the action . But , he added , &quot; the Japan-U.S. trade problem will not be solved without opening Japan ' s automotive market , for both vehicles and parts. &quot; Tatsuro Toyoda , chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Assn. , called the Section 301 trade action &quot; unfortunate. &quot; Midori Tani , director of international communications for the Ministry of International Trade and Industry , said &quot; the fact that the United States and Japan could reach an agreement . . . has a great value. &quot; Times staff writer David Holley in Tokyo contributed to this story .</TEXT>
