   <HEADLINE> RAMS SORELY WILL SEEK A VICTORY AT GREEN_BAY ; PRO FOOTBALL : QUARTERBACKS MILLER AND CHANDLER ARE RECOVERING FROM INJURIES , AND BETTIS HAS A PAINFUL BACK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While an improving defense gives the Rams hope for better days ahead , any chance they have against the Green_Bay Packers today depends_on how well their quarterbacks fare in the trainer ' s room . The Rams ( 2-3 ) enter the game with Chris Miller suffering from a sore throwing shoulder and Chris Chandler trying to recover from a sprained left ankle . Miller is expected to start today , but Coach Chuck Knox hasn ' t ruled_out starting Chandler or using him as a backup if his ankle continues to show improvement . &quot; we ' ll have to wait and see , &quot; Knox said . Injuries best describe the state of the Rams ' offense lately . Wide receiver Flipper Anderson will wear a flak jacket to protect a small broken bone in his back . Tailback Jerome Bettis , who didn ' t practice this week because of a bruised low back , will start and is expected to carry the offense once again . So with plenty of ice_packs in tow , the Rams will try to win at Lambeau Field for the first time since 1988 with a beat-up offense that has produced only one touchdown -- on a tipped pass from Chandler to Anderson -- and four field_goals the last two games . &quot; This is a critical game for us , &quot; Ram assistant head coach Joe Vitt said . &quot; We need to get a win in the worst way , get_back to . 500 and move_on from there . &quot; And in light of the injuries on offense , we need to turn_to our defense right now. &quot; Based on the way the Ram and Green_Bay defenses have played the last few weeks , today ' s game could become a field-goal contest between Tony Zendejas and Chris Jacke . The Rams ' defensive line -- Fred Stokes , Sean Gilbert , Jimmie Jones and Robert Young -- has kept Joe Montana and Jeff George on their heels the last two weeks . The defense shut_out the Chiefs and held Atlanta scoreless for 56 minutes before losing , 8-5 . &quot; that ' s the best defensive front in football right now , &quot; Vitt said . &quot; I can ' t think_of a better one . They get_to the passer , they work unbelievably hard in practice and they ' re young too. &quot; Green_Bay ' s defense , under the direction of former Ram assistant Fritz Shurmur , is fourth in the league ( 273 yards per game ) . The Packers have given_up more_than two touchdowns only once this season , a 24-14 loss to Miami in Week 2 . Their rush defense , sixth in the league with a 77.4-yard average , will have its hands full with Bettis , who averages 101 yards . Miller faces one of the best pass rushes in the league in Green_Bay ' s Reggie White ( three sacks ) , Sean Jones ( four sacks ) and Bryce Paup ( four sacks ) . &quot; I ' m just going_to get the ball out there quick and take as few shots as I can , &quot; Miller said . Chandler , who suffered a sprained ankle against Atlanta last week , made what Knox called a &quot; miraculous &quot; recovery this week . The snaps with the top units went_to backup Tommy Maddox and Miller , who has sat_out the last two games because of a pinched nerve and slight separation in his right shoulder . With Miller coming_off an injury and Anderson wearing a flak jacket as he runs pass routes , where does that leave the Rams ' offense ? Probably in the hands of an overworked Bettis , whose 130 carries this season are 12 more_than any other back in the NFL . Bettis has averaged 32 carries in the past two games and he raised concern early in the week about his durability in an offense that uses him so_much . He sat_out practice all week to rest his back but promises to be in the lineup today . Third-down back Johnny Bailey , the team ' s leading receiver with 16 catches for 166 yards , also should figure prominently today , possibly lining_up for the first time with Bettis , instead of replacing him . Second-year player Howard Griffith got some work_at tailback this week because David Lang sat_out practice because of a deep thigh bruise . Griffith also might play today at fullback for Tim Lester , who suffered a sprained ankle in practice Wednesday but returned the next day . Green_Bay ' s offense also has problems with injuries to key players . Starting left guard Guy McIntyre is sidelined because of a blood_clot in his calf , but quarterback Brett Favre ( deep bruise on right hip ) and wide receiver Sterling Sharpe ( hamstring ) will play . Favre , whom the Rams sought as a restricted free_agent in the off-season , leads the NFC in passing yards with 1 # 427 . He has been erratic at times , throwing eight touchdown passes with five interceptions . And he has had trouble getting Green_Bay in the end zone . The Packers have scored more_than 16 points only once this season , a 30-3 victory over Tampa Bay in Week 4 . Sharpe set a league record for receptions last season with 112 , but is the team ' s second-leading receiver with 32 for 384 yards , one catch shy of running back Edgar Bennett . Although slowed by the hamstring injury , Sharpe still caught nine passes for 132 yards and a touchdown last week in a 17-16 loss to New England . &quot; Sterling came_out for a_few plays against New England , &quot; Green_Bay Coach Mike Holmgren said . &quot; It ' s not a serious injury , just a twinge in his leg , and he has a little work_on it now and then . &quot; He ' ll play and give you everything he ' s got . Ninety percent of Sterling is usually better than 100 % of a lot of guys. &quot; Green_Bay ' s biggest weakness is its running game . Bettis has out-rushed the entire Green_Bay offense , 507 yards to 364 this season . Tailback Reggie Cobb , who ' s sharing time with rookie LeShon Johnson , leads the Packers with 185 yards in 45 carries and has the team ' s only rushing touchdown . With both teams struggling offensively and playing well on defense , does Holmgren predict a low-scoring game ? &quot; Any time I ' ve ever said that it would be , it has usually been just the other kind of game , &quot; he said . &quot; If you go_on what both teams have done so far , it ' s going_to be low-scoring. &quot;</TEXT>
