   <HEADLINE> ANTIOXIDANTS : CANCER PREVENTION OR A WASTE OF TIME ? ; HEALTH : TWO STUDIES DISPUTE THE NUTRIENTS ' EFFECTIVENESS . SOME SAY ALL THE FINDINGS REALLY REVEAL IS A NEED FOR MORE RESEARCH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Not too long ago , as_many as 30 % of Americans were consuming antioxidant supplements -- vitamins E and C and beta carotene -- to prevent disease . But now , Americans may_not be so gung-ho . After a decade of excitement , many antioxidant enthusiasts were crushed this year when two studies found the nutrients useless in protecting against lung_cancer and colon_cancer . The two studies also tested the faith of scientists and the vitamin industry . The studies point_up the need for continuing research on antioxidants and &quot; should be viewed_as a wake-up call , &quot; said John Cordaro , president of the Council for Responsible Nutrition , a trade group representing vitamin supplement makers and distributors . &quot; These studies were very surprising , perhaps because we had become accustomed to an almost never-ending onslaught of positive results , &quot; Cordaro told members of the council Monday at its annual meeting in Dana Point . But adults should continue to take vitamins E and C and beta carotene , even while the research unfolds , conference attendees were told . &quot; I would not suggest that anyone discontinue taking antioxidants on the basis of any one ( study ) , &quot; said Julie Buring , an antioxidants researcher at Harvard_University . There are still plausible reasons to believe antioxidants work against cancer and heart_disease , she said . Scientists propose that antioxidants deactivate free_radicals , molecules that cause severe genetic damage to cells and lead to disease . &quot; ( Antioxidants ) act like a vacuum cleaner . They go_in and get the oxygenated cells that attack DNA , &quot; Buring said . * The studies that turned the most promising preventive health research of the era into a controversy were published this year in the New England Journal of Medicine . In April , the Finnish and American researchers announced that a six-year study of 29 # 000 male smokers in Finland found no evidence that beta carotene supplements could prevent lung_cancer . And , in the most perplexing twist , the study found that the smokers taking beta carotene had an increased risk of stroke and a slightly elevated risk of heart_disease . Then , in July , researchers at Dartmouth Medical_School reported that beta carotene and vitamins_C and E did nothing to lower the risk of colorectal cancer in 751 people . The studies were exceptional in that they ran counter to most previous studies . For that reason , many scientists say they remain convinced that antioxidants really do_work , said Dr. Kenneth Cooper , the aerobics guru . &quot; There is so_much data out there that show the protective effects of antioxidants . Don ' t be led_astray by the studies , &quot; Cooper advised the conference participants . Supportive evidence had been building for more_than two decades . For example , one study of 87 # 000 women during the 1980s showed that those who reported a diet very high in antioxidants from fruits and vegetables had a 46 % lower risk of heart_disease . Studies looking_at the effects of antioxidants on cancer have not been as conclusive , Buring said , but they too indicate a positive effect . The problem with most of the previous studies , however , is that they simply compare people ' s diets with their health . To be accurate , the study participants have to correctly report what they eat over a period of several years . Researchers were eager for the results of the Finnish study because it was different . In that study , one group of people were given vitamin_E and beta carotene supplements while a comparison group was given a placebo . It is this kind of randomized , controlled study that is considered most scientifically valid , Buring said . And so the results were especially distressing . But Buring and others say the study was flawed because the smokers were followed for only six years , too short a time to see the effects of a fairly low dose of beta carotene . Moreover , since the men were heavy smokers , it could be that beta carotene only works to prevent disease and cannot halt lung_cancer after it has started . As for the increased risk of stroke found in the men who took beta carotene , that is much harder to explain , Buring said . &quot; We cannot exclude that this is just chance , &quot; she said of the finding . &quot; I do not believe the results disprove the benefits of antioxidants . But it suggests that the benefits we ' ve seen ( in other studies ) may have been overestimated. &quot; * Research on whether antioxidants prevent certain types of cancer have been mixed , which is why the Dartmouth study on colorectal cancer was less upsetting , says Dr. Roberd Bostick , a antioxidants researcher at Wake Forest University . &quot; The question of whether or not antioxidants have a role in preventing cancer is still a wide-open and very exciting question . The Finnish and Dartmouth studies have not derailed that , &quot; he said . So , who should take antioxidants ? Which ones ? In what dosages ? No one is eager to answer . At a recent meeting of cardiologists , two-thirds of the doctors said they took antioxidants but few admitted to recommending them to their patients , Cooper said . &quot; We ' re really not quite sure of the potential for harm from taking antioxidants . For that reason , I think physicians are a little bit scared about recommending them . But there is still enough evidence to convince them to take antioxidants themselves , &quot; Cooper said . In his new book , &quot; Antioxidant Revolution &quot; ( Nelson ) , Cooper recommends a daily &quot; cocktail &quot; of 400 international units of vitamin_E , 1 # 000 milligrams of vitamin_C and 25 # 000 IU of beta carotene . But Buring urged patience . The next big randomized , controlled study on antioxidants -- the massive , 12-year Physicians ' Health Study -- will be completed next year , with results available in 1996 , she said . &quot; If that study comes_out positive , I think a lot of people will believe it. &quot;</TEXT>
