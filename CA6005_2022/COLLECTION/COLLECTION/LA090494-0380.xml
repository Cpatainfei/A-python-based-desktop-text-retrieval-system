   <TEXT> &quot; It ' s not the end of the world , &quot; the doctor concluded . But that ' s how it felt . I had been back from Russia only two weeks with my newly adopted son , Benjamin , a robust 3-year-old . The trip had been difficult , and the adjustment at once thrilling and exhausting . I was grateful to have such a beautiful child in my life , and relieved that we had returned home safely to a new beginning : for me , for him , and for his sister , Barra , who had arrived from Calcutta in 1987 at the age of 3 months . This was supposed to be a time of bonding and falling_in_love , of adjusting to a new name , a new language -- and a new life . But it was not to be -- not yet . The doctor was a pediatrician who had examined Benjamin on our arrival in the United States . &quot; I just got the final report back from the lab , &quot; she said . Choosing to start with the good news , she told me that he had tested negative for the AIDS virus . Then she paused . &quot; He is positive for hepatitis_B . He has an active infection . He can transmit the virus to others. &quot; For a moment , I couldn ' t breathe . My first reaction was disbelief , then denial . She droned_on , but only pieces of what she was saying registered . She urged me to find a specialist . I must have shouted , &quot; Oh , no ! . . Oh , no ! . . Oh , no ! . . &quot; because Barra ran_into the room , frightened by my tone . &quot; What is it ? What ' s wrong , Mommy ? &quot; Because I write_about health policy for The Times , I already knew a lot about hepatitis_B . And I knew it was grim . Hepatitis_B can be deadly . It can kill swiftly or slowly -- but either way , it is insidious . Over time , an active chronic infection like my son ' s can destroy the liver , resulting in scarring -- called cirrhosis -- liver failure or liver cancer . The disease is endemic to Eastern Europe . Many of the youngsters adopted from that region were infected by their mothers during birth or through blood_transfusions and contaminated needles while living_in orphanages . I do not know how Benjamin was infected . I do know that he received some inoculations as a baby and underwent a hernia operation . Some people with hepatitis_B become sick and die relatively quickly , or recover and develop a lifelong immunity . Others remain symptom-free but carry an active infection that gradually destroys the liver . Children often appear healthy while the virus gains a toehold and begins to replicate because their immune_systems are not fully developed . Both children and adults are sometimes able to clear the virus spontaneously -- seroconversion . About 1 % do so annually . A bright spot in an otherwise bleak picture is that an effective vaccine does exist . And , luckily , my daughter and I had been immunized . The results of a series of blood_tests , however , brought the worst possible scenario for my son . He was positive for surface antigen ( an antigen indicates the presence of virus ) and for the more specific e antigen . The latter was the most discouraging . Evidence of e antigen indicates that the virus is replicating , meaning the patient is highly infectious . Tests also showed that Benjamin ' s liver enzymes were elevated . While that means his immune_system was fighting the virus , those enzymes ultimately could cause liver damage . WE NEED A MIRACLE : How could I share happiness when I was overwhelmed with grief ? Benjamin came_home last November . We would spend the next six months in search of a medical miracle , if one existed . It was a searing experience to confront the health_care community not as a journalist but as an anxious and vulnerable mother . At the same time , I knew that with the sources I had developed , if a cure existed , I would find it . During the first weeks after diagnosis , I was distraught . I could not talk_about my new son without weeping . I temporarily dropped the idea of sending announcements heralding his arrival . How could I share happiness when I was overwhelmed with grief ? That Benjamin should be infected with a virus as serious as hepatitis_B was particularly stunning because I had asked the agency for a healthy child . Even though I knew that international adoption brings no guarantees , I hadn ' t expected any problems . After all , my first experience had been good . Barra had been malnourished when she arrived , but she had blossomed into a beautiful and healthy girl . I had decided to adopt Barra -- and then Benjamin -- abroad because as a single woman over 40 , my options were limited . When Barra came , India and several Latin_American countries were about the only places where an unmarried older_woman could adopt . Since then , Russia has opened its doors to foreign adoptions . It seemed fitting to turn there to complete my family , since my parents had been born in Ukraine . I wanted a little boy of Gypsy heritage . I thought it would be a positive sign for my daughter to see another dark-skinned child join our family . And I believed asking_for a Gypsy would increase my chances of getting a healthy child . Gypsy children are typically abandoned because of their heritage , while most others are available for adoption because of medical problems . But I ' d been waiting eight months for a referral and was_on the brink of selecting Dmitri , a 5-year-old in Moscow -- older and fairer than the son I ' d envisioned . On the evening I was about to say , &quot; OK , I ' ll take Dmitri , &quot; the agency called . &quot; We ' ve just learned of a 3-year-old Gypsy child in Ufa . They say he ' s healthy . We have no other information about him . Do you want to see his picture ? &quot; Of course I did . After two long days , the photo arrived . It showed a charming little boy with dark hair and dark eyes and a shy smile . Immediately , I knew he was the son of my dreams . THE FIRST MEETING : He laid his head upon my lap , and circled his arms around my waist . I left for the former Soviet_Union at the end of October , believing that Benjamin -- then , Igor Lebedev -- was destined to be my son . I flew to Ufa , an industrial town about 700 miles east of Moscow . I knew only that my son had been abandoned at birth and had spent his first six months in a hospital . After that , he had lived_in an orphanage . A few hours after arriving in Ufa , I was taken_to the orphanage . As I sat nervously in the waiting room , a handsome , bright-eyed boy was brought before me . He had been told only that his &quot; mama &quot; had come_to get him . I held_out my arms . He hesitated . Then he laid his head upon my lap , and circled his arms around my waist . The orphanage officials assured me he was in good_health . None of his documents indicated that he had been tested for hepatitis_B . We flew to Moscow , where we were to stay for several days while waiting for our paperwork to clear . Benjamin took_to Rima , our hostess , a grandmotherly retired nuclear physicist . He followed her from room to room -- preferring her to me -- and cried whenever she left the apartment . He had been separated from the only home he had known . She spoke Russian , and I didn ' t . I knew when I got him home that things would be different and he would turn_to me . So I tried to be patient . In the meantime , I learned a_few key Russian phrases : &quot; Are you hungry ? &quot; &quot; Are you thirsty ? &quot; &quot; Do you have to go_to the bathroom ? &quot; &quot; Don ' t touch ! &quot; and &quot; I love you. &quot; Even though he had become devoted to Rima , by the time we were ready to leave I think he knew what was happening . At one point , he told Rima , looking_at me : &quot; That will be my mama. &quot; Now , two weeks later , we were home_in America . And it was I who was struggling . Blissfully unaware of the medical time_bomb ticking inside him , Benjamin began to adjust to his new surroundings . In my cozy and cluttered suburban Maryland home , he was_on sensory overload . He pushed every button , opened every door . He obliterated the message on my answering machine . He traumatized our two cats . He bonded with me and quickly became attached_to his sister . Barra , who now had an instant playmate , decided she adored him -- most of the time . But after the hepatitis_B diagnosis , I held_back a little , afraid to get too close emotionally . Although I knew that people with chronic HBV infections often lived for years before developing problems , I kept worrying that he would die -- and soon . I became resentful of parents whose children were healthy . I tried to comfort myself with the knowledge that far worse things had happened to other children . At just about the time I was trying to come_to grips with Benjamin ' s condition , Polly Klaas ' body was found in California . &quot; I bet her parents would give anything to be in my shoes , &quot; I thought . &quot; At least my son is alive. &quot; Despite my fear and apprehension , I found myself drawn ever more closely to Benjamin . I was horrified when a relative , one of the few who knew of his condition , asked thoughtlessly , &quot; Can you send him back ? &quot; &quot; No we cannot send him back , &quot; I replied , my anger barely under_control . &quot; We ' re not talking_about a 90-day return policy on a car with a damaged bumper. &quot; It never occurred to me that I would n ' t keep him . THE RAMIFICATIONS : Certainly the school had to be told . How would officials there react ? As I wrestled with my own emotions , I also was forced to confront a more practical issue : Whom to tell ? I was terrified that Benjamin would be shunned -- much as some children with AIDS are . I was afraid that the parents of Barra ' s friends would refuse to let their children come_to my home . What was my responsibility to parents of Benjamin ' s friends who invited him over to play ? Did they have a right to know ? What about baby-sitters ? Although the risk of transmission is considered extremely low -- even in people with active infections -- did I have the right to make that decision and take such a chance ? Benjamin was supposed to start preschool in a_few weeks . Certainly the school had to be told . How would officials there react ? I knew the school legally could not refuse to admit him . The Americans With Disabilities Act , which bans discrimination in the private sector , defines illnesses such_as AIDS and hepatitis as disabilities . But that failed to reassure me . I knew I could force the school to take him -- but I wanted to be sure they would treat him like any other child . I had been writing_about the political and social ramifications of AIDS for years . To be sure , hepatitis_B is not as swiftly or as invariably fatal as AIDS . But many of the issues , particularly involving transmission , are identical . Because of AIDS , I had seen children , too young to understand what was happening , thrown_out of school , their families driven from their homes . I had seen adults lose their jobs , their friends , their families . I couldn ' t bear the thought of either of my children being subjected_to this kind of cruelty . As a journalist writing_about these topics , I have always respected peoples ' desire for privacy -- because I have seen how insensitive the ignorant and uneducated can be . But I also believe that being open goes_a_long_way toward removing the stigma -- and that hiding something only sends the message that there is something to be ashamed of . Now I was living it . Was I willing to stand behind my own philosophy ? I was advised by parents of other HBV children to keep Benjamin ' s condition secret . But secrecy simply didn ' t feel right . Maybe I needed the emotional support of others . My instincts told me that if I was open , people would respond appropriately . I told the full story to my closest friends and family , and my regular baby-sitters . If neighbors invited Benjamin home to play with their children -- and I would not be present -- I decided to tell them . Most of the time , the typical reply was : &quot; Oh , OK . Thanks for telling me. &quot; There was a blip of anxiety at the preschool but , overall , the staff was wonderful . The director delayed my son ' s entry so she could gather information about hepatitis_B , and educate her staff . I put the school in touch with the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention in Atlanta . Their advice was clear : The staff of a day-care center , like that of a medical facility , should practice universal precautions with all children . This means wearing gloves when changing diapers and touching blood . One CDC official told them : &quot; You know about this child . He ' s not the one you have to worry about . You have to worry about all_the ones you don ' t know about. &quot; In a city like Washington , with its diplomatic families and other foreigners , chances were overwhelming that Benjamin was not the first HBV-infected child in the school -- or in the community . The center offered its staff free inoculations . Some accepted ; others felt comfortable without them . One teacher learned that she had already been exposed . That only reinforced the CDC message : There had been infected children the center didn ' t know about . When Benjamin started school , he was warmly welcomed . And I noticed , right from the start , that there was no shortage of hugs . Nevertheless , his health brought a perilous new meaning to the most innocent rites of childhood -- a scraped knee or a cat scratch . Every time he fell , I held my breath to see if he was bleeding . When my unvaccinated mother came_to visit , I had to hide her toothbrush . Brushing was a new experience for my son , and -- like everything else that was new -- he couldn ' t get enough of it . But brushing makes gums bleed , and blood can transmit the virus . Benjamin ' s first trip to the dentist was an exercise in frustration and hostility . The dentist , who had been vaccinated , donned a plastic face shield and other protective gear . This would not have annoyed me if I ' d seen her do this with other children . But I ' d never seen her wear anything more_than a mouth mask and gloves . One night , the kids got_into a wrestling match , and Benjamin ' s fist ended_up in Barra ' s mouth . When the crying stopped , his knuckles were bleeding . And so were her gums . Even though she had been vaccinated , I panicked -- fearful that the vaccine might not have taken_effect . The next week , I had her blood_tested to be sure she was protected , and was reassured . SEEKING A CURE : Interferon already was licensed , and had an excellent safety record . Meanwhile , I was using every resource in my medical Rolodex to obtain information about hepatitis_B research . I learned that the National Institutes of Health was conducting a trial using interferon Alpha-2b in HBV-infected children , most adopted from Eastern Europe . Parents were taught to inject the drug three times a week . About 30 % to 40 % of HBV-infected adults treated with the drug go_into remission -- that is , they clear the e antigen . I knew_nothing about the effects of the drug in children but decided to find_out . I called NIH ' s leading hepatitis_B researcher , Dr. Jay Hoofnagle , whom I ' d interviewed for a story . He said the preliminary results with interferon were encouraging , and offered to give my name to Dr. Hari Conjeeveram , who was conducting the trial . Conjeeveram called that night . He was a soft-spoken physician from India who responded warmly when I told him about my daughter . He seemed eager to know more about my son , and whether he would qualify for the NIH protocol . NIH , the world ' s premier biomedical facility , sponsors thousands of studies here and around the world . Patients typically are referred to NIH by their doctors , usually when there is no other treatment available , or when conventional therapies have failed . Participants have to meet certain entry criteria . The care is free , and NIH often will pay_for travel . Although such research is not without risks , interferon already was licensed , and had an excellent safety record . Conjeeveram was very enthusiastic about interferon , although he cautioned that the numbers of children in whom the drug had been studied were small . He said that about half of the children in his study had cleared the e antigen after four to six months of interferon therapy . According to my sources at the Food and Drug Administration , studies in Belgium and Spain had reported encouraging results . Furthermore , unlike adults , who typically experienced severe flu-like side_effects , children seemed to suffer little more_than a low-grade fever and mild muscle aches . TAKING A CHANCE : ' I ' m almost afraid to love him , ' I said , knowing it was too late . Although I was becoming convinced that Benjamin should try interferon , I wasn ' t sure if I wanted to go_through NIH or see a specialist who could prescribe it privately . The NIH would be free -- but there was the possibility that my son would be placed in a control group , for comparison purposes , and would not receive the drug . I decided to consult with a private specialist first . An FDA source recommended Alan Lake , a pediatric gastroenterologist at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore . He was the best in the area , my source said . &quot; Congratulations on your new son , &quot; Lake said on the phone , causing the tears to start again . &quot; And stop worrying . He ' s going_to be fine. &quot; Benjamin and I drove to Baltimore to see Lake the following week . When Lake appeared , he grinned at Benjamin , and began speaking_to him in a Donald Duck voice -- an approach that almost certainly engages most of his young patients , but only puzzled a little boy who had been in America less than three weeks . At the time , Lake was not keen on the idea . The drug was expensive . A four-month course of treatment for my son would cost at least $ 1 # 000 -- wholesale . That would not include a hefty markup or the cost of syringes and other materials . Moreover , it would be an &quot; off-label &quot; use of the drug -- since it was not approved for children -- and my insurer would have to be persuaded to reimburse the cost . At this point , he suggested NIH . Lake and I watched my son tear around his office , turning the lights on and off , and punching the buttons on his phone . Lake chuckled . And I began to choke_up . I did not want to lose this little boy . &quot; I ' m almost afraid to love him , &quot; I said , knowing it was already too late . &quot; Love him -- I ' ll write you a prescription for it , &quot; Lake urged . On Dec . 8 , we met with Conjeeveram at NIH . His explanation of the protocol left me discouraged . First , Benjamin would have to undergo six months of screenings , and then -- as I ' d feared -- faced a 50-50 chance of receiving the drug . &quot; I have to be honest with you , &quot; I told Conjeeveram . &quot; I respect the work you are doing , but I don ' t want my kid to be a control . I want him on the drug . I want to get_it privately . If you were me , what would you do ? &quot; Conjeeveram , the father of a boy close to my son ' s age , looked_at me soberly for a long_time . He was a scientist . His study was important , and it was far from being fully enrolled . &quot; I would do exactly what you ' re doing , &quot; he said . Nevertheless , he urged me to stay_on the NIH track , in case I was not successful in getting the drug outside the study . It made no sense to stop the NIH clock , and have to start from the beginning if I failed . So we began the first of three months of regular visits there . I returned to Lake , who had been unaware of the restrictions in the NIH study , and agreed that Benjamin shouldn ' t wait . He said he would prescribe the drug if a liver biopsy confirmed the hepatitis_B diagnosis . The procedure established that my son had HBV -- nothing else -- and that the liver was not yet scarred . The next hurdle was to persuade my insurer to pay_for the drug . I ' d worried about this the most . In gathering information about hepatitis_B and interferon , I ' d heard of families whose physicians were unwilling to go_to bat for them , and they had been denied . I was afraid the insurers would say that this was an &quot; experimental &quot; use of a licensed drug . My FDA sources assured me that an &quot; off-label &quot; use was not a sufficient reason to refuse reimbursement . Moreover , they said that FDA officials routinely intervened with insurers to support off-label uses , if the treatment was considered the &quot; standard of care. &quot; They said they believed that Benjamin ' s case fell_into such a category -- and they would fight for me . Lake wrote a very strong letter , enclosing copies of existing studies . He also mentioned that he had reviewed his treatment recommendations for Benjamin with NIH researchers and FDA officials who had studied the interferon data , and who had read Benjamin ' s medical profile , and that he had received their enthusiastic endorsement . He was , in_effect , signaling them that we had the backing of experts and were prepared to do battle should they refuse . Without apparent hesitation , the insurance_company agreed to pay . Benjamin appeared to be an ideal candidate for interferon . His enzyme levels were elevated , indicating his immune_system was already fighting the virus and was likely to respond favorably to the drug . In addition , his viral DNA levels were low , meaning that -- even though the virus was replicating -- he apparently had a small viral load , which should make the virus easier to clear . Two weeks later , I was sitting in Lake ' s office again , learning to fill a syringe and tap_out the air_bubbles . Then he stood , rolled_up his sleeve , and made me give him a practice shot . Emotionally , I had shifted into a new gear . I was beginning to feel that the drug was going_to work . And I couldn ' t help but wonder , as my optimism began to grow , about those parents who did not have the contacts in the medical_community that I had . Where could they go ? What would happen to their children ? WATCHING , HOPING : ' Some kids just breeze right through , ' Conjeeveram said . Most U.S. pediatricians , unaccustomed to seeing hepatitis_B in children and unfamiliar_with the research , would almost certainly recommend nothing more_than a watch-and-wait attitude with periodic blood screenings -- indeed , before we found Lake , that was the attitude of our pediatrician . Also , I began thinking_about how close I ' d come_to selecting another child . And how I ' d learned about Benjamin at virtually the final second . The more I thought_about it , the more convinced I became that he had come_to me for a reason . He almost certainly would have died at an early age if he had stayed in Russia . They didn ' t even know about his infection . Moreover , horrifying as it now seems to me , I likely would have turned him down if I ' d known in_advance about his infection . Now , at last , with the hope that was being offered by interferon , I was slowly moving away from a life that was ruled by hepatitis_B . And I was falling_in_love . I was charmed by the way Benjamin ' s face would beam and he would squeal with delight and run to hug and kiss me when I showed_up at school to pick him up . &quot; that ' s my mommy ! &quot; he would announce to the teachers . And I was amazed by his rapidly developing English and by his growing independence . &quot; No -- by self ! &quot; he insisted when he wanted to do something without help . I remember the day he came_to me and said : &quot; Mommy , my tummy hurts . Need more doctor. &quot; I was so thrilled by his sentence construction that I momentarily forgot about his symptom . I gave him his first shot on Feb . 7 . This is a child who runs_away when I try to wipe his face with a washcloth . But he stayed absolutely still when he saw the needle . Somehow , he knew it was important . After two weeks , Lake drew more blood . He warned me not to expect to see any changes . He just wanted to be sure that the drug was not causing havoc with Benjamin ' s blood chemistry . The results showed no adverse side_effects . But the liver enzymes were still elevated , the e antigen still positive . Benjamin suffered only an occasional low-grade fever during the first few weeks of therapy . &quot; Some kids just breeze right through , &quot; Conjeeveram said . Although we were officially out of the NIH picture , we still talked by telephone . I asked Conjeeveram what to expect . He said there is typically a drop_in the enzymes , followed by a spike -- known as a flare -- which indicates that the body ' s immune_system is engaged in its final battle against the virus . Then , it is hoped , comes seroconversion -- the point at which the body clears the virus . Four weeks later , Lake drew another blood sample . Benjamin had been_on the drug six weeks . I was beginning to feel discouraged again after my initial euphoria . I wanted to see something -- a drop_in the enzymes . But Lake insisted that nothing would happen quickly . It was the only time he turned_out to be wrong . TIME FOR ELATION : ' Even I didn ' t expect the results to be this good , ' Lake said . On a Wednesday , I called him , hoping to hear that the enzymes had dropped . He reported just the opposite . They were up , one of them by more_than 100 units . &quot; I don ' t know whether this is good news , bad news or no news , &quot; he said . I took it as good news . At least something was happening . Then on Saturday , he called me . The rest of the lab report was in . &quot; I ' m going_to give you an interesting weekend , &quot; he said . &quot; Interesting is a very benign word , &quot; I replied . &quot; I don ' t know what that means. &quot; &quot; His e antigen came_back negative , &quot; he said . &quot; It may mean the levels of virus are so low that the test just isn ' t picking it up . But , even so , it means he ' s going_in the right direction . I am ecstatic. &quot; I whooped . &quot; What about antibodies ? &quot; I asked . &quot; What about surface antigen ? &quot; &quot; I didn ' t even run those tests , &quot; he said . &quot; I didn ' t expect anything to be happening so soon. &quot; He recommended that we return in a_couple_of weeks and he would run the complete set of tests . We did , and I watched as the technicians drew still more blood . It struck me what a stoic this little boy had become . He simply held_out his arm . Two days later , my phone rang . It was Lake . &quot; Tell me , tell me , &quot; I said . &quot; Oh , I just called to say hello , &quot; he said , laughing , and I knew it had to be good news . &quot; E antigen negative , &quot; he began , and I couldn ' t believe what I was hearing . &quot; E antibody positive . Surface antigen negative . Surface antibody positive. &quot; He paused . &quot; I ' m the eternal optimist , &quot; he said , &quot; but even I didn ' t expect the results to be this good -- and this fast. &quot; &quot; He ' s cured ? &quot; &quot; Yes. &quot; It was over . He and other experts , including Conjeeveram , believe that Benjamin ' s immune_system probably had been seroconverting on its own -- and got stuck . The interferon helped finish the job . Conjeeveram says they often see the same thing with adults . ' I doubt he would have been able to seroconvert without the drug , &quot; Conjeeveram said . After Lake called , I drove to my synagogue . Benjamin was to receive his Hebrew name in a ceremony that Friday , and I needed to pick_up a copy of the service so I would know what to say . I left the temple office with the envelope , and got_into my car . I decided to open it up and read the lines I was to recite : We are thankful for the many joys with which our lives have been blessed . Now this great good has come_to us : a new life , a new child to love , the opening of a new chapter in the chronicle of our family ' s existence . O may this child grow_up in health and happiness , to become a blessing to family , friends and neighbors . I put my head down on the steering_wheel and began to cry yet again -- this time , finally , for joy .</TEXT>
