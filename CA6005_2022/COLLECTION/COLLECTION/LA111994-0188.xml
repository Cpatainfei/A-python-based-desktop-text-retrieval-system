   <HEADLINE> 187 SHOWS CLERGY ' S WEAK INFLUENCE ON ELECTORATE ; RELIGION : CATHOLICS SUPPORTED ANTI-ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION MEASURE IN DROVES DESPITE MANY CHURCHES ' OPPOSITION . SOME SAY FLOCK NEEDS EDUCATION , SOME SAY SHEPHERDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When California voters -- especially Catholics -- resoundingly approved Proposition 187 over the opposition of many of their churches , they raised serious questions about the power of religious_leaders to sway political debates with moral arguments . The initiative ' s big victory revealed &quot; a Catholic electorate which increasingly seems to view the statements of its pastoral and moral leaders as having little credibility or urgency , &quot; lamented The Tidings , the newspaper of the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese , in a post-ballot editorial . The way the election turned_out signaled &quot; an alarming trend , &quot; in the Catholic_Church , which already has &quot; a shepherd-flock gap &quot; between the attitudes of lay Catholics and their bishops ' strict stands against legalized abortion and the death_penalty , wrote Editor Tod Tamberg . While Protestant voters heavily favored 187 at the polls , Protestantism ' s plethora of denominations and long tradition of emphasis on individual conscience often weaken efforts to rally churchgoers to one side of a moral-political issue . The Catholic_Church , by contrast -- the largest denomination in the state , representing about 25 % of the electorate -- has a hierarchical_structure that can marshal its many pulpits to one side , as happened with Proposition 187 . Los Angeles Cardinal Roger M . Mahony was especially active in the anti-187 campaign . But although Catholics overall opposed the initiative by a narrow 51 % -49 % ( according to The Times ' exit poll ) , it was favored 58 % to 42 % by non-Latino white Catholics . That put those white Catholics -- who outnumbered nonwhite Catholics 2-1 at the polls -- precisely in step with the 59 % of the rest of the electorate who voted &quot; yes. &quot; The result appears to indicate that white Catholics simply shrugged_off the cardinal ' s stern denunciations of the proposition as inhumane and immoral . One devoted parishioner who objected to her priests ' homilies against 187 was Pat Shuff of Fullerton . She said she and her husband have significantly scaled back their contributions to the church as a result . &quot; People who are here illegally are breaking the law . I don ' t think we should pick and choose which laws we should abide_by , &quot; she said . Not only that , Shuff said , &quot; I do believe_in separation of church and state , and I don ' t think it was proper for the church to take a stance. &quot; Several readers wrote to The Tidings last week , objecting to Tamberg ' s editorial lamenting the failure of Catholic voters to heed the cardinal ' s urgings , the editor said in an interview . The writers protested that the bishops had taken the liberal side of a social dispute &quot; and that they should stick_to religion and stay out of politics , &quot; he said . The Tidings , celebrating 100 years of publishing , has a largely older , non-Latino white readership that has dwindled to 27 # 000 in recent decades . An experimental one-year plan that will double circulation may be put into place early next year , Tamberg said . Tamberg , 31 , of Studio City , was named editor two years ago -- a job he says consumes between 60 and 70 hours a week but which he enjoys . Born in Burbank , Tamberg majored in theology and philosophy at Notre Dame while writing for the university ' s newspaper . The editor said in an interview that he believes the Catholic_Church needs to continue educating members about the social implications of their faith . &quot; When Cardinal Mahony said 187 was an affront to human dignity , for instance , many Catholics will hear that as a political statement , rather than a teaching that draws upon church tradition , &quot; Tamberg said . &quot; Look_at all_the state ' s mainline religious_leaders who spoke against it &quot; to little or no effect , he said . &quot; These are people who know the Gospel and their churches ' tradition . I think we have a great_deal of educating to do. &quot; The Times ' exit poll showed that of the 48 % of voters who identified themselves as Protestant , 69 % said they voted for 187 . That might seem surprising in light of the public opposition expressed by United Methodist , Episcopal , Presbyterian and other mainline church leaders . However , the many religiously and culturally conservative Protestant_churches and bodies around the state were silent on the issue . And even in the oldline denominations , church executives say they can do no more_than recommend stances on selected propositions . Some clergy see the split between their moral views and those of the laity in their churches as a warning sign that perhaps the clergy need &quot; educating &quot; too . &quot; We are not listening to our own constituency , &quot; said Bishop Roy Sano , who heads the Pasadena-based California-Pacific Conference of the United Methodist_Church . &quot; No doubt we could have done more &quot; in opposing 187 , he said , but mainline denominations , while remaining faithful to Christian ethics , need to hear what church_members are saying . The bishop said that political analysts who describe the Democratic Party as isolating itself from voters could have been describing church leadership as well . &quot; We have to address what is behind some of the voting pattern -- the anxiety arising from tax burdens and the feeling of being inundated &quot; by immigrants , the bishop said . The Catholic bishops are aware of the dangers of overloading parishioners with social and political lectures , said Julie Sly , communications director for the Sacramento office that represents the bishops ' positions on public policy . Because of parishioner resistance to &quot; a barrage of information to vote this way or that way , the bishops have been very selective the last few years in taking stances on state propositions , &quot; she said . For example , the bishops took no official position last year on the private-school voucher initiative -- which would have been a financial boon to the large Catholic_school system -- and none this year on the smoking and &quot; three strikes &quot; propositions . The bishops &quot; deliberately tried to argue the case against Proposition 187 on a higher plane , drawing_on specific church teachings , &quot; Sly said . &quot; We have tried to limit the statements to the initiatives which have clear moral or ethical implications. &quot;</TEXT>
