   <HEADLINE> A CLASH OF STYLES , GENERATIONS FOR UKRAINE VOTERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a chilly , darkened schoolhouse that bears_witness to the energy crisis that is sapping Ukraine ' s economic vitality , Environment Minister Yuri Kostenko looks as worn as his old gray overcoat . &quot; Had more attention been paid to Ukraine ' s energy supplies two or three years ago , then our economy would not be in such a terrible state today , &quot; the 42-year-old physical chemist said . In a stump_speech that contained more unpleasant &quot; truth-telling &quot; than most Americans might hear from politicians in a lifetime , Kostenko blamed his own government for incompetence and said Ukraine is being hijacked by &quot; horrible corruption and Mafia clans that are uncontrollable and that , together with the executive_branch , are making decisions that are disastrous for the economy. &quot; Kostenko is a respected democrat and longtime activist in the Rukh independence movement . But only 15 voters braved the damp , raw evening to come hear him . On the other side of the district , Semen V . Yufa was engaged in a different kind of &quot; truth-telling. &quot; The 33-year-old businessman , one of Kiev ' s most famous entrepreneurs , had rented a downtown movie_theater to meet with voters who were drawn_in by street hawkers with megaphones . &quot; I want us to live like human_beings at last , for us to tell each other the truth , &quot; said Yufa , who looked_like a young Donald Trump in a snazzy blue double-breasted blazer with gold buttons , a crisp white shirt and a power-yellow tie that probably cost several times the average monthly salary here . &quot; Now , we not only don ' t love each other , we hate each other , &quot; Yufa said . &quot; We lie to each other constantly , and we think this is normal. &quot; Several people in the crowd of more_than 100 nodded in_agreement . To his fans , Yufa is a tycoon , living proof that a creative , energetic person can succeed despite a business climate that remains decidedly hostile . To his enemies , he is a Mafiosi , a term used loosely here to describe anyone from a racketeer to an entrepreneur who cuts bureaucratic corners or avoids taxes , as nearly all private businesses must do . The contest between Kostenko and Yufa , who are competing with 21 other candidates for their district ' s seat in the new Parliament , is as much a clash of generation and style as of ideology . Kostenko , like virtually all Ukrainian intellectuals , was educated in the Russian language , but as a political statement he will speak only in Ukrainian or not-quite-fluent English . Yufa , a former cook turned restaurant owner , then trader and investment fund manager , addressed his voters in Russian , the native language of most of Kiev . Election law specifies that no candidate can spend more then $ 150 on his or her campaign . Kostenko claims that Yufa ' s slick color campaign brochures alone cost more_than that -- but so far no one is enforcing the new campaign finance law . Both men support a free market and nuclear disarmament . But Kostenko , a nationalist , is concerned that Russia is not fairly compensating Ukraine for the value of the metal in Kiev ' s dismantled nuclear_warheads . Yufa is more concerned about the stifling Ukrainian tax code , which he calls disgusting , and the inequities in the proposed privatization plan . His campaign goal has universal appeal . &quot; I want very much to live_in a country where everyone is rich , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
