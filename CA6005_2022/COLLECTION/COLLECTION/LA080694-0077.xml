   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; GOOD JOBS NEWS PUTS WALL_STREET IN GLOOMY MOOD ; MARKETS : BOND YIELDS RISE , WHILE STOCK PRICES AND THE DOLLAR WEAKEN . FEARS OF A HIKE IN INTEREST_RATES ARE BACK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> News that the economy added more_than a quarter of a_million jobs last month triggered a sharp rise in Treasury_bond yields Friday . The gloomy mood in bonds spread to other financial markets , weakening stock prices and the dollar . Behind the selloff were renewed fears that the Federal_Reserve_Board will act to contain inflation arising from the employment strength by pushing_up interest_rates as early as Aug . 16 . The key 30-year bond yield jumped to 7.54 % from 7.40 % on Thursday . Its price , which moves_in the opposite direction , plummeted 1 13 / 32 points , or $ 14.06 per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . On Wall_Street , the Dow Jones industrial average slid 18.77 points to 3 # 747.02 , down 17.48 for the week . The markets reacted swiftly to the Labor_Department ' s morning report that the economy created 259 # 000 new jobs in July , about 60 # 000 more_than consensus forecasts and besting even the highest expectations . The long bond ' s yield immediately surged , reflecting a swift reversal in sentiment from recent hopes that economic_growth had slowed markedly in the second_half of 1994 . The bond market ' s shortest-term maturities suffered even sharper setbacks , with yields on six-month and one-year Treasury_bills jumping about a fifth of a percentage_point . Equally disturbing was a closely watched wage gauge in the report , the hourly earnings of non-farm , non-supervisory workers , which jumped 0.4 % to $ 11.12 in July . The markets have been concerned that higher labor costs could prove inflationary . Analysts said the report increases the likelihood that the Fed will raise interest_rates as much as 0.5 % at its next Federal Open Market Committee_meeting in an attempt to slow economic_growth and head_off any increase in inflation . Bond rates move_in anticipation of such hikes because of the need to offer competitive returns to investors . &quot; Certainly it ' s strong enough to make the Fed seriously consider it , coupled with other things , &quot; said Bill Newman , chief investment strategist at Kidder Peabody . Back on Wall_Street , market declines were widespread . Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly 12 to 7 on the New York Stock_Exchange , and broad market indexes fell . The NYSE ' s composite index fell 0.77 point to 252.50. The Nasdaq index of mostly smaller companies declined 1.51 points to 718.67. The Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 list fell 1.31 points to 457.09. Big Board volume was a moderate 230.27 million shares , down from 289.15 million Thursday . Utility stocks , which had rallied over the past several weeks , were hit particularly hard amid fear that rising interest_rates would prove expensive to utilities , which typically borrow heavily in the credit markets . The Dow Jones utility average lost 1.91 points to close at 189.43. Investors sold the issues of economically sensitive companies , such_as smokestack industrial stocks , and interest-sensitive companies , such_as banks and mortgage-related companies , on the fear that higher interest_rates will choke_off investment . Among the market highlights : * Caterpillar fell 2 7 / 8 to 104 3 / 4 , even after shareholders approved a 2-for-1 stock_split effective Tuesday . International Paper declined 1 / 2 to 74 3 / 8 . Morgan Stanley lost 1 3 / 8 to 62 5 / 8 . * Telecommunications_equipment company Scientific-Atlanta surged 4 3 / 4 to 39 after its quarterly earnings soundly beat analysts ' forecasts . * Nextel Communications jumped 1 1 / 8 to 26 3 / 4 in Nasdaq trading on news that it reached a merger deal with Dial Page Inc. and was buying Motorola Inc. ' s remaining U.S. specialized mobile radio licenses . * Dial Page slipped 1 3 / 8 to 30 5 / 8 and Motorola finished_up 1 / 8 to 52 5 / 8 . The news boosted other wireless communications stocks , including OneComm , which rose 1 5 / 8 to 26 7 / 8 . * Fund American Enterprises Holdings climbed 3 7 / 8 to 74 7 / 8 after it said it received an unsolicited bid for its Source One Mortgage Service Corp . subsidiary . Elsewhere , in the currency market , the dollar followed bond prices lower . A rate hike could benefit the dollar by attracting short-term deposits from Europe , where rates are higher , but those positive implications were offset by the selloff in U.S. securities markets , which dampened demand for dollars . In late New York trading , the dollar fell to 1.581 German marks , down from 1.588 on Thursday . It also fell against the Japanese yen , closing at 100.25 yen , down from 100.38. Overseas markets were mixed , and the Dow Jones world stock index was lower near the close . In Mexico_City , stocks rose to their highest level in six months amid growing optimism that the economy is healthier than people thought , traders said . The Bolsa index rose for a sixth session , up 2.72 % , or 70.06 points , to 2643.87. Equities also ended firmer in London , with the Financial Times 100-share average rising 17.0 points to 3 # 167.5 , while Frankfurt ' s 30-share DAX average closed_up 1.40 points at 2 # 184.76. Tokyo ' s 225-share Nikkei average ended down 155.14 points at 20 # 521.70 .</TEXT>
