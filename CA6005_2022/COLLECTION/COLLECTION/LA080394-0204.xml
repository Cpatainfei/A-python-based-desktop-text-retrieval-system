   <HEADLINE> COMPUTER_FILE / LAWRENCE J . MAGID : THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; CYBERSPACE AIDS IN OUTREACH TO VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE , ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The O.J. Simpson case has raised awareness about domestic violence in all parts of society , including cyberspace . Thanks to the interactive nature of on-line services and the Internet , victims of domestic violence can now reach_out , get support from others and , in some cases , take effective action . The most comprehensive support_system I ' ve seen to date is_on the Prodigy service , where Christy , among other people , posted a note asking_for advice on how to get_out of an abusive relationship . Frances responded by recalling her own struggles with an abusive husband . A third_person , Bonnie Cunningham , gave some specific advice on how the two women could break_away from their destructive relationships and &quot; explore the deeper issues &quot; that keep them bound to abusive men . Christy wrote back , &quot; Bonnie , you are a godsend ! ! I can ' t tell you how much you have helped me . . . . Thanks to your support I ' m not going_to see him again . I don ' t want to die. &quot; These women have never met or spoken with each other , but they ' re part of an impromptu nationwide on-line support group that &quot; meets &quot; on a continuing basis . Cunningham , a former battered women ' s shelter coordinator , is spending more_than her usual amount_of_time on Prodigy as she recovers from injuries suffered during the Northridge earthquake . Abuse victims who read her offers of help on the public bulletin_board usually contact her by private electronic_mail to avoid discussing their problems in public . Prodigy displays a member ' s real name on all public bulletin_board notes . So far , at least six of the women Cunningham ' s helped have left their abusive partners . &quot; Three of them are now in shelters , &quot; she said . Some abuse victims find on-line services to be less intimidating than calling a hot_line or visiting a shelter , Cunningham said . &quot; Besides , it ' s a lot easier for a victim to quietly pour her heart out into the computer while her husband watches TV on the couch than it is to sneak over to a neighbor ' s house to make a private phone call. &quot; Prodigy ' s domestic violence topic is located on its Home Life Bulletin_Board . As with other Prodigy bulletin_boards , members can post questions or comments , respond to what others write or simply read what others have posted . Prodigy charges $ 3.60 an hour to access its bulletin_boards . America Online , CompuServe and GEnie also offer discussion groups on domestic violence , but so far they ' re not as comprehensive or as easy to find as Prodigy ' s . American Online members can find solace in the Better Health &amp; Medical Forum , where they can participate in live &quot; Abuse Survivors &quot; conferences each Wednesday evening , or an ongoing bulletin_board discussion in the &quot; Abuse / Incest Support &quot; folder . Discussions about &quot; violence against women &quot; take_place in AOL ' s Women ' s Board . Discussions about domestic violence on CompuServe can be found in the Survivors / Recovery and Safety / Protection sections of the Time Warner Crime Forum and in the Women ' s Forum . GEnie users can find such discussions in the Survival and Recovery section of the Personal Growth RoundTable . This is a &quot; private &quot; area , which means you have to request admission from the system operator . The Women ' s Wire , an on-line service focused_on women , offers access to the staff of the Domestic Abuse Awareness Project . Subscribers can display articles and participate in forums with groups working to combat domestic violence . For more information , call ( 800 ) 210-9999 or ( 415 ) 615-8989 . Finding help on the Internet can be tough , given the vast number of resources on this global network of networks . Most Internet providers offer access to forums , called newsgroups , where people can post and read messages from other Internet users . One newsgroup called alt.support.abuse-recovery specializes in helping people deal with various forms of abuse , including domestic violence , drug and alcohol_addiction and other problems . Another option is the alt.abuse.recovery newsgroup . Those who need to deal with their own abusive behavior can try the alt.abuse.offender.recovery newsgroup . You ' ll find additional discussions and shoulders to lean_on in soc.women , soc.feminism and soc.men. Going_on line to find support for a personal problem can be a good choice for some people , according to Stuart Schwartz , a professor of clinical psychiatry at Robert Wood Johnson Medical_School in New Brunswick , N.J. &quot; The computer provides a sense of anonymity and distance while retaining a sense of immediacy , &quot; he said . &quot; But it ' s not for everyone . It is by no means a substitute for a face-to-face personal intervention. &quot; Debbie Lee , associate director of the San Francisco-based Family Violence Prevention Fund , agrees that for some people , using an on-line service is &quot; not threatening because there is no person confronting what you are thinking. &quot; She also appreciates its educational value for others , including people who may_not be personally involved in an abusive relationship . &quot; People are just beginning to realize that domestic violence is everyone ' s business , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
