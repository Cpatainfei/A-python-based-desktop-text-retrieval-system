   <HEADLINE> WHIRLPOOL STOCK FALLS ON NEWS OF U.S. ANTITRUST INVESTIGATION ; PRICING : APPLIANCE MAKER HAS BEEN MOST AGGRESSIVE PRICE RAISER IN INDUSTRY . JILTED CUSTOMER BEST BUY LEAKED WORD OF THE PROBE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an unusual display of corporate tit-for-tat , Best Buy Co . seems to have extracted some revenge on Whirlpool Corp . for dropping Best Buy as a customer . Whirlpool ' s stock fell_in heavy trading Friday after word leaked_out that it was the subject of a federal antitrust probe . The leaker was its jilted former customer , Best Buy . The Justice_Department confirmed the existence of a probe . &quot; The antitrust division has an ongoing investigation of pricing practices in the large home-appliance industry , &quot; spokeswoman Gina Talamona said . She declined to be more specific . County Natwest analyst Nicholas Heymann said the probe , disclosed Thursday , could make_it difficult for Whirlpool to raise prices , something the company needs to do to protect its profits in the face of new challenges from low-cost producers . Heymann said Whirlpool has been the most aggressive appliance maker about raising prices in the United States and Europe , but the gains have been largely offset by heavy promotional expenses . Whirlpool recently told analysts it intends to reduce promotional spending , but it is unclear if retailers will accept higher prices . The electronics retailer ' s stock plunged Thursday after it released a disappointing third-quarter earnings forecast , then fell even further after a report that Whirlpool would no longer supply its Whirlpool appliances to Best Buy . After the close of trading Thursday , during which Best Buy shares plummeted 26 % , the Minneapolis-based company issued a news release confirming its falling_out with Whirlpool . But tucked into the release was a previously undisclosed fact that Best Buy was privy to as a major appliance retailer : Whirlpool is a subject of a federal antitrust investigation . Whirlpool spokeswoman Robin Skiles said the company decided to stop selling its Whirlpool brand through Best Buy because Best Buy operates largely as a discount warehouse operation and this conflicts with Whirlpool ' s strategy . &quot; If we put them into a distribution channel that is a price-value channel , it ' s a conflicting message for our brand , &quot; Skiles said . In terms of the government probe , she said Whirlpool believes the investigation is focusing_on several appliance makers and said Whirlpool is cooperating fully . Whirlpool shares fell $ 2.25 Friday to close at $ 46.50 , on volume of 1.08 million shares .</TEXT>
