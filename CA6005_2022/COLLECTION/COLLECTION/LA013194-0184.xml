   <HEADLINE> SUNDANCE SURPRISES ; FESTIVAL : TOM NOONAN ' S ' WHAT HAPPENED WAS ' IS AN UNEXPECTED WINNER , TAKING_HOME TWO MAJOR TROPHIES . ' FREEDOM ON MY MIND ' IS ANOTHER DARK-HORSE VICTOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a competition rife_with the natterings of disgruntled 20-year-olds , one of the few films to deal maturely with adult concerns ended_up being the Sundance Festival ' s surprise big winner . &quot; What Happened Was , &quot; written and directed by actor Tom Noonan , who also co-starred , won both the Grand_Jury Prize for dramatic films and the Waldo Salt screenwriting award at Saturday night ' s typically chaotic presentation ceremony . Noonan , appearing in a play in New York , could not attend , though co-producer Robin O ' Hara , who hastened to accept , assured everyone that , &quot; Tom ' s going_to go nuts. &quot; Developed by the actor as a break from the chilling villains he ' s played in &quot; Manhunter &quot; and &quot; Last Action Hero , &quot; &quot; Happened &quot; is a two-character , one-set drama detailing a painfully nervous first date between co-workers ( Noonan and Karen Sillas ) in a Manhattan law_firm . Compellingly written and acted , it paints an achingly realistic picture of people desperately trying to connect . In even more of an upset , the Grand_Jury prize for documentaries went_to the powerful &quot; Freedom on My Mind , &quot; a vivid and informative evocation of the Mississippi Voter Registration Project of the early 1960s . Co-directed by Berkeley-based filmmakers Connie Field and Marilyn Mulford , who said they hadn ' t expected to win , &quot; Freedom &quot; combines archival footage and contemporary interviews in a way that is both thoughtful and passionate . Not surprisingly winning the Audience Award for documentary was the nearly three-hour &quot; Hoop Dreams , &quot; nominally a movie about sports but in truth an examination of a complex , multilayered social reality . The Chicago-based filmmaking team ( director and co-producer Steve James and co-producers Fred Marx and Bill Haugse ) spent four-and-a-half years shooting 250 hours of film detailing not only the careers but also the private lives of a pair of gifted high_school basketball_players who fantasize about a career in the NBA as a way_out of the poverty of their surroundings . &quot; Hoop Dreams &quot; revitalizes this familiar tale , managing to be surprising and emotionally potent as well as offering a devastating look_at the realities of life in the inner_city . The Audience Award for drama went_to &quot; Spanking the Monkey , &quot; one of the festival ' s many forays_into the world of dysfunctional families . &quot; Fun , &quot; a similarly unhappy scenario despite its title , won Special_Jury Recognition for its two stars , Alicia Witt and Renee Humphrey , who play a pair of bratty-to-the-max teens who make Leopold and Loeb look well-adjusted . Also winning Special Recognition for acting was Sean Nelson , the 13-year-old star of &quot; Fresh. &quot; That unlikely combination of social consciousness and crime melodrama also earned a share of the Filmmakers Trophy , voted on by the other competition directors , for writer-director Boaz Yakin . The other half of the Filmmakers Trophy went_to &quot; Clerks , &quot; whose odyssey from its festival-low $ 27 # 575 budget to a distribution deal with Miramax is Sundance ' s most unlikely success story . The film also provided the evening ' s most appropriate acceptance speech , courtesy of writer-actor-director-co-producer Kevin Smith : &quot; This is a really cool piece of glass. &quot; Smith , a clerk himself , told Filmmaker magazine that he one day realized &quot; there had never been a convenience_store movie. &quot; The money for this epic came from &quot; a supply of eight or 10 credit_cards with $ 2 # 000 limits &quot; plus the tuition he saved from dropping_out of film school . Shooting nights , when the store he worked in was closed , Smith usually got no more_than one hour of sleep per day , and was finally so deprived he slept through the shooting of the film ' s climatic sequence . * The Filmmakers Trophy , documentary division , happily went_to &quot; Theremin : An Electronic Odyssey , &quot; which seems at first like nothing more_than an eccentric footnote to musical history that describes the life of a charismatic Russian genius named Leon Theremin . The instrument he invented and named after himself marked the beginning of electronic music , and its haunting , unworldly sound can be heard in everything from movies such_as &quot; The Day the Earth Stood Still &quot; to the Beach Boys ' &quot; Good Vibrations. &quot; But Theremin ' s life suddenly took a turn right out of a John Le Carre novel , and director Steven M . Martin ( a former Nuart Theater projectionist ) gracefully follows all its fascinating turns with unfailing wit and intelligence and turns &quot; An Electronic Odyssey &quot; into the most delightful of long , strange trips . &quot; Suture , &quot; a film noir knockoff beautifully shot in wide_screen black_and_white , took the Cinematography award for drama for director of photography Greg Gardiner , while the sepia hues of Morten Sandtroen won on the documentary side for &quot; Colorado Cowboy : The Bruce Ford Story , &quot; which proves once again that very few things are as photogenic as men of the American West . Unfortunately , the clip that was shown when the award was announced was stock rodeo footage , causing Sandtroen to dryly note as he held the trophy , &quot; I should find_out who shot that and pass this along. &quot; Also winning awards were a trio of documentaries . &quot; Coming Out Under Fire , &quot; a look_at gay and lesbian veterans of World_War_II , received a Special_Jury Award for Technical Excellence . Both &quot; Heart of the_Matter , &quot; an examination of women with AIDS , and &quot; Dialogues With Madwomen , &quot; offering candid tales of terrifying mental breakdowns and how they were treated , shared the Freedom of Expression Award . &quot; Dialogues &quot; director Allie Light made the evening ' s most eloquent acceptance , talking_of &quot; the nature of hope : The more you put it down , the more it seems to rise like a wild dream. &quot; Especially on its final weekend , when table-hopping at the Barking Frog and the Riverhorse Cafe reached epidemic proportions , this was the year when the Hollywood presence at Sundance threatened to get_out of hand . The crush to get_into the world premier of the Coen brothers ' &quot; The Hudsucker Proxy , &quot; complete with roped-off seats and Warner Bros. ' executives on walkie-talkies , was uncomfortably close to an L.A. industry event . But for every refugee from Morton ' s in a parka , there were people like the couple from Juneau , Alaska , who planned their vacation around the festival because they can ' t see Sundance-type films at_home . And for every studio-released film that premiered with reserved seats with executives names on them , there were movies like &quot; Darkness In Tallinn. &quot; This Estonian / Finnish co-production not only kept coming_up with new wrinkles in its mimeographed posters ( &quot; Dare to Cast the First Estone &quot; read one , &quot; Starring Sly Estallone and Sharon Estone &quot; read another ) , it started its screenings with a live a capella version of what was claimed to be the Estonian national_anthem by the film ' s director and producer . If Sundance can keep producing moments like that , it won ' t have to worry about losing its soul .</TEXT>
