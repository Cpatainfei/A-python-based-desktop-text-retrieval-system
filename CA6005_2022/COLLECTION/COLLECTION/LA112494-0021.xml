   <HEADLINE> VIEWS ON PROP . 187</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As an illegal immigrant from Mexico for eight years , I was asking myself , do we really get any credit at all ? As an illegal I pay taxes , pay a mortgage , car loan , and work every day . I was thinking , what if all_of us in the state stopped working for three days ? Will this be an impact on the economy ? How will politicians fix it ? Will this show any reality for people who do not want to see it ? Imagine nannies , housekeepers , drivers , field workers , waitresses and laborers all_over the state stopping at once . Will you see a difference ? Will you pay $ 3 for a head of lettuce ? Will you eat an $ 8 hamburger , spend $ 20 for a car wash and so on ? Will your income stretch that far ? See reality . DANIEL LARIOS Los Angeles * * I am a U.S. citizen . I came here 14 years ago legally from Vietnam . In order to become a citizen , I had to learn English and pass the Constitution test . The effort and hard work that I put_in have been very rewarding . I am neutral about Prop . 187 but I have two suggestions that might make a difference . First , I suggest that everybody who is illegal here now be granted amnesty and given the opportunity to become citizens within a certain period_of_time . Second , any illegal immigrants who are here now that do not take_advantage of this amnesty time frame would not be eligible for benefits . This country is made_up of immigrants , and I think these suggestions would be fair for all . JAMES MAO Oxnard * * As a manufacturing supervisor overseeing hundreds of immigrant workers , I am shocked at those who support Prop . 187 . The proposition is a countermeasure to attack illegal immigrants already within the state that have bypassed our system and supposedly waste tax dollars . Companies have prospered in Southern California due_to hard-working , legal and illegal citizens . An immigrant ' s No . 1 expectation is to lead a hard-working life , not state-funded public health or welfare benefits . Prop . 187 is trying to solve too many issues with one magic pill . The state must focus its limited resources on issues such_as our inadequate border control_system . Prop . 187 is missing the issue and is just another quick-fix scheme that will not work . FRANK HSIEH Irvine * * Along with the television ministers , I also speak_to God . After learning the results of Prop . 187 , he confessed to me he blundered . Instead of instilling free_will in our species , he should have implanted goodwill . HERMAN GOLD Beverly Hills</TEXT>
