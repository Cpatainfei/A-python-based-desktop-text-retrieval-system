   <HEADLINE> HUBBELL TO ADMIT TO TAX_EVASION , SOURCES SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Former Associate Atty . Gen . Webster L . Hubbell , a close friend of President Clinton and a former law partner of First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton , has agreed to plead guilty to two felony charges arising from the Whitewater investigation , sources said Thursday . Hubbell , 46 , who will admit to tax_evasion and mail_fraud , becomes the first major political figure and Clinton associate to be snared by the investigation of Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth W . Starr . The plea comes_in response to evidence gathered by Starr that Hubbell had overbilled his legal clients , including the federal_government . Until he resigned last March 14 , Hubbell was the nation ' s No . 3 law_enforcement official and an early appointee of the President . Not since the aftermath of the Watergate scandal in the mid-1970s has a former top Justice_Department official ended_up on the other end of the law as a result of a presidential scandal . Neither Hubbell nor his attorney , John W . Nields , could be reached for comment . Starr and his associates declined to comment . It was not yet known what penalty prosecutors would seek in the case . Because of Hubbell ' s long personal_relationship to Clinton , the guilty plea surely will be portrayed by critics as another black_eye for the President . Hubbell was the President ' s frequent golfing partner and a close political ally during Clinton ' s years as Arkansas governor . During the 1990 gubernatorial campaign , in fact , Clinton called Hubbell &quot; my best friend. &quot; And White_House counselor Thomas F . ( Mack ) McLarty , another close Clinton ally from Arkansas , told a Little_Rock newspaperman in a recently published book that Hubbell &quot; is the person whose company the President enjoys most in the world. &quot; Since coming_to Washington with a large entourage of former Arkansas associates , the Clintons have watched as_many of their old friends have encountered difficulty in high office . Of Mrs . Clinton ' s three Rose Law_Firm partners who accepted appointments in the Administration , none are still serving . Former White_House Counsel Vincent W . Foster Jr . committed suicide , former White_House Counsel William Kennedy has returned to Little_Rock , and Hubbell resigned because of his legal problems . The charges against Hubbell stem from work that the Rose Law_Firm did for the government in resolving savings and loan failures in Arkansas . According to the Associated Press , documents provided to the independent counsel by the Rose firm show that Hubbell double-billed the government for at least $ 29 # 400 in the thrift cleanup work . Sources said the government was only one of several clients overbilled by Hubbell . His federal financial disclosure form for 1992 listed $ 310 # 000 in income from Rose , which he said included some deferred earnings from 1991 . The charges against Hubbell were a byproduct of Starr ' s investigation into the Whitewater real_estate investment of the Clintons and James B . McDougal , owner of the now-defunct Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan . The central focus of the inquiry is whether either Clinton or his campaign were improperly enriched by money from Madison . Rose firm lawyers , including Mrs . Clinton , had done legal work for Madison . After it collapsed , Hubbell was paid by the government to settle a lawsuit against an accounting company accused of negligence in Madison Guaranty ' s failure . Other members of Hubbell ' s family are deeply involved in the case as well . His father-in-law and brother-in-law took_out nearly $ 1.5 million in loans from Madison . When Hubbell resigned in March , he said he was quitting government to deal with private matters relating to &quot; compensation and reimbursement &quot; questions raised by his former partners at the Rose firm . His departure caused widespread disappointment among career employees at the Justice_Department , where he was regarded_as a good administrator . &quot; It is also unfortunate that private issues between me and my firm have been cast , by some , as being part of a broad political net called Whitewater . These private issues have nothing to do with Whitewater , Madison Guaranty , the McDougals or the President and First_Lady , &quot; Hubbell said in his resignation statement . Clinton said at the time that Hubbell had made &quot; the right decision &quot; in resigning and referred to Hubbell as a &quot; good personal friend. &quot; The bulky Hubbell was an offensive lineman for the University of Arkansas football_team in the late 1960s . He played in the Sugar_Bowl , where he allowed an opponent to get past him and sack the quarterback . &quot; Quarterbacks and running backs are remembered for their achievements , &quot; Hubbell once lamented . &quot; Offensive linemen are remembered for their mistakes. &quot; Times staff writer John M .
