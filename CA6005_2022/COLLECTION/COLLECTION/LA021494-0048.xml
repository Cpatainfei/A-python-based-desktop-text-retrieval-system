   <HEADLINE> ELECTRIC_POWER AUCTION ' LAST STAND FOR RENEWABLES ' ; ENERGY : THE COMPETITION FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FUTURE STATE UTILITIES CONTRACTS COMES AS ECONOMICS ARE HEAVILY STACKED AGAINST ALTERNATIVE PRODUCERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A controversial auction of future electric_power , which could be resolved as early as Wednesday , could represent the last big chance for California ' s unique mix of wind turbines , geothermal plants and other energy alternatives to carve out more turf . At stake are billions of dollars in contracts to produce electricity for the state ' s public_utilities -- the biggest opportunity in years for those who make power from the sun , wind and subterranean steam . But the auction comes as economics are stacked against alternative_energy producers more_than at any time in recent memory . And many in the utility business and on Wall_Street believe that the twilight has arrived for industries based on such environmentally praised sources of energy . &quot; It ' s the last stand_for renewables to carve out a market niche for themselves before the new order ( of utility deregulation ) comes_in , &quot; said Arthur O ' Donnell , editor of the industry newsletter California Energy Markets . &quot; This is where the lines will be drawn for the future of energy in California. &quot; Under policies that are a legacy of the 1970s energy crises , the state Public_Utilities Commission has required Southern California Edison Co. , San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co . and Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co . to entertain bids from companies vying to sell them the power to light more_than a_million California homes . But the auction has broken_down over the utilities ' contention that the PUC ' s process is flawed in favor of the renewable energies . Edison , going further , says it doesn ' t need more energy until well into the next century . For their part , the renewable energy producers say that the utilities -- particularly Edison and SDG &amp; E -- simply want to build any new power_plants themselves . As the bids came_in last December -- framed under PUC formulas that one critic termed &quot; death by detail &quot; -- the utilities cried foul . Some bidders , said utility executives , had scored well by using numbers that defied the laws of thermodynamics as well as the spirit , if not the letter , of the auction rules . Edison accused some &quot; clever &quot; power producers of creatively -- though not necessarily fraudulently -- estimating production efficiency and other elements of their complex bids and asked the PUC to throw_out Edison ' s portion of the auction . The other utilities called_for throwing_out the most problematic bidders , but keeping the rest . The alternative_energy producers generally defend their bids -- which cite energy-production costs substantially cheaper than the utilities ' own benchmark prices . And they stand ready to modify the more creative payment clauses that the utilities object to . Indeed , they say that &quot; utility dinosaurs &quot; -- particularly Edison , which they call a &quot; purveyor of doom &quot; -- are seizing_on the issue to resist increased use of the independent producers ' renewable energy . On Wednesday in San Francisco , the PUC commissioners are scheduled to begin hearing testimony to sort the_matter out . If the commissioners end_up telling the utilities to accept somewhat modified bids , PG &amp; E and the renewable energy producers will be more or less content . But Edison , the biggest player in the auction , and SDG &amp; E say that their ratepayers would still see an unnecessary jump in their power bills if they are forced to buy additional alternative_energy . Edison -- which has contended all along that it doesn ' t need the extra power -- estimates that the auction would add 1 % to 2 % to its customers ' average monthly bill , or $ 530 million in unnecessary costs from 1997 through 2004 . SDG &amp; E estimates that the &quot; manipulated &quot; bids would cost its ratepayers an extra $ 26 million a year over the next 25 to 30 years of the contracts . If the commissioners surprise most parties and throw_out Edison ' s part of the auction , it would be a major blow to renewable energy producers who have spent decades in research and development and are poised to become broadly commercial . &quot; It would not be the death_knell of renewables , &quot; said Gerald Alderson , president of Kenetech Corp. , the largest of the wind-energy generators . &quot; On the other hand , we ' ve spent a lot of time developing what would be $ 500 million worth of projects. &quot; Proponents contend that some of these technologies -- particularly wind and geothermal -- have finally become competitive with the utilities ' fossil-fuel plants , citing the auction prices as proof . And though Edison may_not need the new power production to keep its ratepayers ' lights on , Alderson and others contend that it owes it to them to switch to lower-cost producers if they are available . &quot; Some old , inefficient power_plants ought to be turned_off , &quot; Alderson said . &quot; But a utility is going_to stand_up and say ' no , ' because they are still paying_off the investment. &quot; The renewables companies also tout the long-term benefits of their energy sources , ranging from low environmental impact to more stable energy pricing -- because they can be used as a hedge against future price hikes for natural_gas , the utilities ' principal fuel . California , which was once 70 % dependent_on oil for its electricity , turned_to renewable energy for that reason . After the 1978 revolution in Iran drove_up world oil prices , California experienced the steepest electricity price hikes in the nation . The state legislature and regulators responded with a policy -- still unique in the nation -- to promote non-fossil fuels for electricity generation . Today , California has the most diverse palette of energy sources of any region in the world . Fully 10 % of the mix comes from geothermal , biomass , solar and wind . And this is largely due_to two big auctions -- the current one being the second -- in which part of the state ' s future power needs have been set_aside for renewable and independent power producers . Historically , this has in_effect subsidized the renewables producers . But most utilities and industry_analysts see a less rosy future today . Even if some renewables can now compete on_their_own with some fossil power_plants , the utilities argue , renewables will still be too expensive to vie with the even-lower energy prices to come under electric-utility deregulation , which has been taking_hold since 1978 . &quot; ' Social generation ' is a thing of the past , &quot; said Edward J . Tirello Jr. , a senior_vice_president and utilities analyst with NatWest Securities in New York . &quot; All these higher-cost renewables and independent producers are out the window , &quot; Tirello said . &quot; They can ' t compete in a real , competitive world . . . particularly against the new generation of gas-fired turbines. &quot; Meanwhile , pressure on utilities to lower power bills , particularly to big industrial customers , is intense in California ' s business climate . While benign weather and widespread energy efficiency programs keep monthly power usage and costs for residential and industrial customers among the lowest in the nation , California ' s electricity rates remain higher than those in many other states , and large industrial users are threatening to push for even more deregulation -- in retail power , something the utilities vehemently oppose -- if they don ' t get cheaper electricity . All this leaves California ' s utilities with little patience for the PUC ' s support of renewable resources . &quot; We want to compete on a_level playing_field . . . and if we can do that , that eliminates an awful lot of the inherent disputes that are built into the current process , &quot; said Don Fellows , Edison manager of renewable resources . Edison , Fellows points_out , already buys almost a quarter of its energy from renewable resources -- about twice the national average among utilities . Edison also has more different energies in its generating mix than any other utility in the world . Utilities , he argues , should now be free to simply buy the cheapest electricity from any available source , and to determine on_their_own when they need it . But Jan Smutny-Jones , executive_director of the Sacramento-based Independent Energy Producers Assn. , sees this as short-sighted dependence on currently low gas prices . &quot; The reality , &quot; Smutny-Jones said , &quot; is that none of the gas or oil crises that you can think_of historically were predictable events . They just happened. &quot;</TEXT>
