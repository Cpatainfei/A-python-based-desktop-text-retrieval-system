   <HEADLINE> HIKING : MORRO BAY : THE MORRO OF THE STORY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Morro Rock , the much-photographed Central Coast icon , official State Landmark No . 801 , and the &quot; Gibraltar of the Pacific , &quot; isn ' t the only morro in town . Eight more morros -- mini volcanic peaks -- are linked with the famed rock in a chain that stretches from San Luis Obispo to Morro Bay . A couple of these morros ( all_of which are taller than photogenic but relatively puny Morro Rock ) offer great short hikes . Geologists say the nine morros originated as volcanoes beneath the sea that covered the area a_million years ago . After the sea and volcanic explosions subsided , erosion began dissolving the softer parts of the mountain around the volcanic_rock and left the nine volcanic peaks standing above the surrounding landscape . Among the more prominent and visible morros are Islay Peak east of the San Luis Obispo County Airport and San Luis Mountain towering above the Madonna Inn . The two of most interest to hikers are Cabrillo Peak and Black Hill , both in Morro Bay_State Park . Cabrillo Peak , a 911-foot morro , has a terrific 360-degree view . At the base of the peak are rolling grasslands with two miles of trail . Quarry Trail was so named for the rock quarried here and crushed for local roads . The Park Ridge Trail explores a group of minor peaks . Striking Park Ridge Rock is a state park ranger training site for cliff rescues . Live_Oak Trail meanders among the predominant oak along the San Luis Obispo County coast . The adventurous will bushwhack up trail-less Cabrillo Peak . A few faint zigzag paths made by use , not design , help the intrepid hiker , but it ' s a make-your-own-way kind of hike to the top . Allow yourself plenty of time to climb . From Cabrillo Peak , the panorama includes Morro Rock to the west ; the_Irish Hills and Los Osos Valley to the south ; the chain of Morros going east ; the Santa Lucia Mountains and the southern Big Sur backcountry to the north . To reach the trail head for Cabrillo Peak : From U.S. 101 in San Luis Obispo , take the Morro Bay / California 1 exit and travel 12 miles north to the outskirts of Morro Bay . Take the signed Morro Bay_State Park / Montana de Oro State Park exit and follow South Bay Boulevard . In three-fourths of a mile the road forks ; the right branch leads to the main part of Morro Bay_State Park , but fork left and continue on South Bay Boulevard another half-mile to the Cabrillo Peak dirt parking_lot on the left ( east ) side of the road . Also consider the easy three-mile round_trip hike_up Black Hill , located in the main part of Morro Bay_State Park . Black Hill , the last peak in the volcanic series before Morro Rock , has a trail that tours through a little of everything -- chaparral , eucalyptus , oaks , pine and coastal scrub . From the mountain ' s 640-foot summit , you can see Morro Bay Estuary , the sand spit and the_hills of nearby Montana de Oro State Park . Be sure to check_out the morro exhibit at the excellent Morro Bay_State Park Museum , which also boasts some terrific natural_history displays and offers a grand view of Morro Bay .
