   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS : SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO ; CITY WILL EXAMINE COUNTY LANDFILL DRAFT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Planning_Commission on Tuesday will review a draft environmental report for a plan intended to guide future development of the county ' s Prima Deshecha Landfill . About a third of the 1 # 530-acre landfill site sits within the southeast corner of the city , south of the Ortega Highway.Parts of the landfill , in_use since 1976 , are also in an unincorporated area and in San Clemente . City officials are recommending that the environmental report be changed because part of the landfill , as proposed , would eventually be visible from houses to the north and northwest . The city is also concerned about the county ' s analysis on how the landfill plan will affect Ortega Highway traffic in five years . One proposal the Planning_Commission will consider is to ask the county to take responsibility for the widening of Ortega Highway east from Interstate 5 . The meeting is scheduled for 7 p.m. at City_Hall , 32400 Paseo Adelanto . JEFF BEAN</TEXT>
