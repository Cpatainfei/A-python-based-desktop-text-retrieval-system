   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; ANALYSIS OF A DOOMED CAMPAIGN ; KATHLEEN BROWN CHANGED ISSUES TOO OFTEN AND RAN OUT OF MONEY . BUT EVEN IF SHE HAD MADE NO MISTAKES , SHE FACED A POLITICAL MASTER HOLDING TWO ACES -- CRIME AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It wasn ' t supposed to be like this , Democrats said to each other in the final days of the campaign , as the grim reality of Kathleen Brown ' s fate became apparent . She was the crown_princess of California politics , the telegenic daughter of one governor and sister of another , a bright shining star on whom the Democrats had been pinning their future hopes for years . Yet when she lost her bid for the governorship to Republican Pete Wilson , she lost big , her defeat taking_on the dimensions of a political train wreck . She lost the state by 15 points , lost even Democratic-leaning Los Angeles County . She carried fewer votes than several lower-ranking members of the Democratic ticket . She won five counties , half the number Democrats count_on even when they lose . Looking_back , Democrats and Republicans now say , there were signs of the impending blowout all along . No one moment turned the course , no one event crystallized Wilson ' s advantage over Brown . Rather , she had -- to borrow one of the political world ' s favorite phrases this year -- three strikes against her : message , money and the voting environment . Poll after poll showed Wilson controlling the issues Californians deemed important . Poll after poll showed that Brown ' s support came from people who just liked her or her family , not from those committed to her because of a deeper political issue . She was ideologically estranged from the bulk of California , both in her stance on the death_penalty and on the initiative to which she hitched her final hopes -- the polarizing Proposition 187 . She was outspent over the course of the campaign by several million dollars , and she ran in a year in which having a &quot; D &quot; after one ' s name on the ballot was very nearly a death_knell . Undeniably , her campaign made strategic errors as well , ones that haunted her effort and those of other Democrats on the ticket . She and her campaign made critical miscalculations about the issues that would motivate voters in this most angry political year . &quot; To some degree Kathleen came_into this with more of a reputation for being a political pro than she deserved , &quot; said one prominent Democrat . &quot; She had one run once before for a down-ballot office ( state_treasurer ) against an appointee . In a state this big and complicated , that is not much experience. &quot; But Democrats and Republicans suggest now that even had Brown run a strategically brilliant campaign , her chances would have been iffy , at best . &quot; Unless Kathleen Brown had sat_down at least two years ago and rethought her basic philosophical underpinnings , she was going_to have a very , very difficult race regardless of what she did , &quot; said Dan Schnur , Wilson ' s press spokesman , who echoed the views of many Democrats . &quot; Ultimately , this was an election that came_down to very stark philosophical differences. &quot; Brown does not agree , and lays the primary blame for her defeat on the Republican tide that engulfed the nation Tuesday . With her genetically optimistic style , she remains proud_of what she did . &quot; I was broke so many times in this campaign , &quot; she said in an interview after the election . &quot; We started every Monday with $ 68 in the bank . It was unbelievable what was achieved . Unbelievable that we kept coming back. &quot; * The rule is a hard-and-fast one in the cyclical and frequently mystifying world of electoral politics : Never re-fight the last election . This time around , doing so was particularly lethal . But that was what it appeared Brown was doing for much of the campaign . Like the party ' s 1992 presidential candidate , Bill_Clinton , Brown focused a great_deal of fire on the economy . Like Clinton , she had in her sights an unpopular Republican . Like Clinton , she bound up a &quot; plan &quot; in a shiny cover , rolled it up and used it to browbeat the incumbent . Democrats could have been forgiven , in those glowing early days after their sweeping 1992 victory , for having illusions that the same sort of appeal would prevail two years hence . Nothing could have been further from the truth . The signs were simple at first : Pollsters started picking_up hints that voters once again considered Republicans better suited than Democrats to deal with their problems . The public rebelled at Clinton ' s health_care plan , deriding it as a big-government solution in a time when people wanted government small . Fear raised its head , as it frequently does when times are tough . Crime zoomed to the top of the list of issues important to Californians , followed quickly by its partner in emotion : illegal immigration . Wilson laid the groundwork for his campaign more_than a year before the election , when he started stoking the fires about illegal immigration and crime . The power of incumbency came_into play : It is impossible to ignore illegal immigration as an issue when a governor uses it to declare war on the President of the United States . Even so , the Brown campaign remained convinced that the economy would be Wilson ' s albatross . A year ago Wilson had historically low popularity ratings and they believed that ultimately voters would look_at Wilson ' s tenure as governor and decide he did not merit a second term . They persisted_in those thoughts even during the spring and summer as the economy began an ever-so-slight improvement and Wilson ' s favorability nudged upward . Wilson was afraid they were right , so he did what all clever politicians do : He changed the subject . &quot; That is the genius , the shrewdness of Wilson ' s strategy , &quot; said John Brennan , director of the Los Angeles Times Poll . &quot; He turned it away from himself to other things. &quot; But what allowed him to turn the focus around , of course , were the attitudes of voters themselves . &quot; In 1992 there was a very strong Democratic tail wind , a very unusual Democratic tail wind , and the economy dominated the issue agenda , &quot; Brennan said . &quot; Nothing else was even on the screen ; crime was barely mentioned by voters . We ' re light-years away from that election now . Kathleen Brown was mistaken to think that 1992 was a pointer toward 1994 . . . . One election does not forecast the next. &quot; Darry Sragow , a strategist who managed John Garamendi ' s campaign against Brown for the Democratic nomination , lauds Wilson ' s campaign strategists as the finest in the business and uses as Exhibit A their tactical moves this year . &quot; What they basically did was get the dialogue in this campaign onto their turf , &quot; he said . &quot; Crime and immigration -- on those issues a Republican male is going_to beat a Democratic female . They find weaknesses . . . . They put a finger in the wound and keep expanding the wound . The death_penalty was obviously one . It furthered concerns about Kathleen Brown ' s ideology and ability to govern. &quot; Whether a candidate creates an issue , or whether he or she merely follows developing public_opinion , is difficult to assess . Whether Wilson pulled voters his way , or simply caught the issue wave earlier than Brown , he controlled the important issues entirely . Throughout the general_election campaign , whether voters were asked who would better handle crime or immigration or the economy , the majority had one answer : Wilson . * Once crime and immigration were established as Wilson ' s campaign issues , the Brown campaign was faced with a choice : Change the subject themselves and focus_on other issues , or roll the dice and try to beat Wilson at his own game . Within the Brown campaign , there appeared to be dissent over which path to take . Brown ' s first -- of several -- slogans sought to establish her as the candidate who would rebuild the economy . Then , in the late spring and early summer , Brown stood_up and came at Wilson with a full-throated assault on a most unlikely issue : crime . It was , at minimum , a long_shot strategy given Wilson ' s decades-long public record as a friend of crime victims ' groups and a campaigner against Democratic legislators for toughened sentences -- and Brown ' s personal opposition to the death_penalty . Her maneuver turned_out to be the political equivalent of Pickett ' s Charge , in which thousands of Confederate_soldiers literally walked across a field at Gettysburg only to be mowed_down by Union troops . Like the Union_soldiers , Wilson ' s troops were waiting , and as soon as they got_over their astonishment , they shot at Brown with both barrels . Like the Southern soldiers , Brown left herself utterly unprotected . First she charged that Wilson ' s parole policies had let violent criminals out of jail to murder and assault frightened Californians . But in the case she cited , one involving a convict named Melvin Carter , it turned_out that state officials had been required to release him under rules implemented by Brown ' s brother , Gov . Edmund G . ( Jerry ) Brown Jr . Brown nonetheless continued arguing the case , even as local prosecutors essentially sided with Wilson ' s version of the facts . In the political realm , where perception frequently outpaces reality , Brown ' s move allowed Wilson several shots : It made her look_like she operated without regard_to facts . It reminded voters anew of the familial connection between Brown and her brother , still a figure in some disrepute among California voters . It gave Wilson another chance to define Brown as a &quot; no-show &quot; in the war against crime . And it gave him another weapon with which to hammer at Brown on the death_penalty . Brown also sought to pin other crime-related errors on Wilson , such_as his Administration ' s inability to account_for thousands of registered sex offenders and the fact that , even after 12 years of Republican governors , Californians feel more unsafe now than ever before . While Brown ' s arguments might have had logical merit , she lost the battle of imagery . Not for nothing had Wilson been pounding a lectern for years about crime . He had become , in California , the personification of the average Joe ' s uphill struggle against fear of criminals . Wilson ' s campaign manager , George Gorton , said the campaign ' s internal polls showed that each time Brown launched a major offensive about crime , Wilson benefited . &quot; He was impregnable on the crime issue , &quot; Gorton said . &quot; Melvin Carter was a turning point , when she persisted_in something that was a fallacy . It tarnished her own image. &quot; Later , when Brown ran_out of money and had to pull her advertising the weekend before Election_Day , a senior Democrat pointed back to the summer spent trying to best Wilson on crime as part of the problem . &quot; She was_on the air all summer , with no movement , &quot; the Democrat said . &quot; She was flat-lining . She could have taken ( the money that paid_for ) two weeks of July and two weeks of August and socked it away. &quot; And there was not even any political benefit to show for the millions spent . The decision to focus so heavily on crime cost Brown not only money but valuable time in which she could have defined herself to California voters . It apparently did not make a dent : A Labor_Day poll taken by The Times showed that only 24 % of registered voters believed that Brown was_better equipped than Wilson to handle crime . By Election_Day , the numbers were virtually unchanged . Brown ' s campaign manager , Clint Reilly , insists that she had no choice but to go hard against Wilson on crime and other issues in the summer , regardless of the cost . That became apparent , he said , immediately after the primary when polls showed Brown behind Wilson . &quot; We -- and I think correctly -- assessed that if we went passively through the summer we probably would have been behind 20 points , and would have been in an irretrievable situation , &quot; Reilly said . Schnur , Wilson ' s spokesman , suggested that Brown ' s strategy was driven not by a realistic assessment of_her_own strengths on the crime issue but by her campaign manager ' s most recent electoral efforts . Reilly ' s latest campaigns had featured two Republican men -- Frank Jordan in San Francisco and Richard Riordan in Los Angeles -- seeking to become mayors in Democratic cities . While both of them were able to project an aura of toughness about an issue of striking importance to voters , Brown was not -- for reasons that probably were influenced by her death_penalty position , her gender and her connection to brother Jerry , whose appointment of anti-capital punishment Rose Bird to the state Supreme Court is still a fresh memory . &quot; ( Reilly ) must have thought he could either make Kathleen Brown more effective than Pete Wilson on crime or even them out , &quot; Schnur said shortly before Election_Day . &quot; You have to address it , but the most recent poll had 22 % saying she was the most credible on crime . If she had never uttered a single word , that number probably would not be different. &quot; * To Brown herself , the money spent in the summer was crucial to her effort . If she did not boost herself in the polls by Labor_Day , her campaign believed , she was dead . &quot; The whole strategy was to get_through Labor_Day with a good poll , &quot; Brown said after the election . When the polls came_out after Labor_Day , however , the news was not good . Brown trailed Wilson by nine points among likely voters , the Los Angeles Times Poll found , and had failed to create a groundswell of support for her own candidacy . That poll and others taken at_the_same_time did grievous damage to her fund-raising_efforts . &quot; The poll came_out and cost me a_million dollars . And then another poll was even worse , &quot; she said . &quot; The money dried up. &quot; The Brown campaign did its best to shield from public view its shaky finances ; its officials consistently told reporters that they had enough to last . But the empty pockets became stunningly obvious the weekend before the election , when Brown became the only major party candidate in anyone ' s memory to virtually go_off the airwaves . Money spent for advertising in the last weeks , considered the most important to campaign professionals , was minimal compared to other Democratic candidates ' expenditures . The seeming shut-down unleashed bounding anger among many Democrats toward the Brown campaign and its manager Reilly , whom many accuse of mismanaging the campaign ' s finances . From White_House officials to partisans for lower-level candidates , all were enraged that Brown would go dark at such a crucial time for the party ' s ticket . But concerns about the Brown effort abounded , and in fact predated Reilly ' s arrival in the spring . From the beginning , under both of its management teams , the Brown effort seemed to have trouble defining its own candidate . So many slogans and campaign commercials proliferated , according to some professionals , that no one image of Brown ever sank into voters ' minds . As Schnur , Wilson ' s spokesman , put it in a memorable memo to political reporters , hers was a candidacy of &quot; two years , 39 television commercials , two campaign teams , five slogans and $ 24 million. &quot; What Wilson had that Brown lacked , many Democrats and Republicans agree , was a defining agenda . For Wilson , that was crime , illegal immigration and jobs , a triumvirate that he repeated like a mantra from the early days of the campaign to the last . Brown ' s focus , perhaps by necessity as she struggled to catch_up , shifted regularly . Bob Mulholland , the Democratic_party ' s campaign adviser , quotes Republican ad master Roger Ailes ' definition of a winner : Show me a candidate with a cause . &quot; Wilson told us in 1993 what his cause would be , &quot; said Mulholland , who described the Democratic defeat as a &quot; team effort. &quot; &quot; And the Democrats never had one . We were all_over the map . We should be taken_out back and shot . This was an election we should have won. &quot; Brown did , of course , find a cause at the end : Her opposition to the anti-illegal immigrant Proposition 187 . She campaigned in the final weeks with a fiery energy , earning praise even from Democrats who had earlier doubted her core beliefs . There was only one problem : Voters , by a 3-2 margin , favored the initiative . Brown and Reilly lay blame for her showing on the anti-Democratic sentiment of voters and , as well , on the campaign ' s finances . &quot; He ( Wilson ) had an enormous amount_of_money . . . to define Kathleen and we didn ' t have the money to defend her adequately , &quot; said Reilly . Even many Democrats , however , do not buy that excuse . They contend that the money was there -- not enough to match Wilson , perhaps , but enough to define Brown had the campaign settled_on different tactics . Brown is believed to have spent close to $ 24 million in pursuit of the governorship ; Wilson spent several million more . Many Democrats , now engaged in a familiar post-election rite of questioning their party ' s future , describe the Brown campaign in the most dire of terms . It wasn ' t even a contest , said one . Criminal malfeasance , said another . Most agree that most everything that could go_wrong , did go_wrong . &quot; Kathleen Brown was never able to enunciate a rationale for her election as governor to either insiders or voters , &quot; said Democratic strategist Sragow . &quot; She just failed to succinctly state her own case . Whether the candidate doesn ' t have vision or the campaign can ' t articulate it , I don ' t know . The campaign didn ' t work. &quot; Times staff writers Bill Stall and Amy Wallace contributed to this story .</TEXT>
