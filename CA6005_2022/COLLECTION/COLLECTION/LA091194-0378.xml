   <HEADLINE> CUSTOMERS CAN FILL UP IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE ; MARKETING : INDUSTRY OFFICIALS SAY THE BLENDING OF A FAST-FOOD OUTLET AND A GASOLINE_STATION HAS PROVED POPULAR AND PROFITABLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Billy Bowling pulls into a Happy Mart convenience_store , he fills his tank with gas and his belly with tacos . &quot; If you go get gas and then you go_down the road and have to stand_in line again for food , you ' re going out of your way , &quot; said Bowling , clutching a gas receipt and a Taco Bell bag as he climbed into his car . &quot; It ' s just less of a headache. &quot; Of 18 Happy Marts that Coleman Oil Co . owns in eastern Kentucky , West_Virginia and Virginia , eight have big-name fast-food operations . The company plans more fast-food stations . Industry officials say the concept is popular_with consumers and profitable for gasoline distributors and fast-food chains . The arrangement allows fast-food companies to enter new markets without shelling_out $ 1 million or more to build a free-standing restaurant . In an economically depressed rural_area like eastern Kentucky , that ' s a big plus . &quot; It works for us because it gives us access to consumers we couldn ' t normally reach , &quot; said Bruce Schroder , vice_president for Taco Bell Express . &quot; It ' s a change in marketing strategy . . . . ( We are ) actually taking our food to the consumers. &quot; These on-the-run oases started appearing about five years ago . But 1993 was the year the trend really caught_on , said Stewart Small , spokesman for the National Assn . of Convenience_Stores . Last year , fast-food sales at convenience_stores increased 15.3 % , Small said . He said the fast-food share of convenience_store sales is now 11.7 % . Industry officials have no idea how many of these hybrid stores are out there . But , Small said , &quot; Big companies are doing_it , small companies are doing_it . &quot; It ' s happening in the city , it ' s happening in rural areas. &quot; The concept is still new enough that some of the biggest players are taking a wait-and-see attitude . McDonald ' s Corp. , the nation ' s No . 1 fast-food chain , has fewer than half_a_dozen such restaurants in its 9 # 500-unit empire . And they were developed on the local level , spokeswoman Ann Connolly said . &quot; It ' s very early for us , &quot; she said . &quot; We ' re careful . We ' re taking a close look_at this. &quot; Businesses that have tried the idea so far report impressive results . Coleman Oil installed a Burger King at its store in Phelps , population 1 # 300 , for about one-fifth the cost of building a free-standing restaurant . Doug Charles , vice_president of Pikeville-based Coleman , said gasoline sales at the store soon jumped by as much as 500 gallons a day . &quot; The big thing is we already had a good existing customer base , and it allowed us to maximize our property use , &quot; he said . The restaurant_chains won ' t give figures , but the relationship appears to be working_out well for them too . When Charles started looking_into adding brand-name fast food at Happy Marts 1 1 / 2 years ago , he had to do the courting . Now , restaurant_chains are coming_to the oil_companies . &quot; Let us help you beef_up your bottom_line , &quot; said a full-page Burger King ad in the June edition of Independent Gasoline Marketing magazine . &quot; It ' s never been this convenient before. &quot; Frank Paci , vice_president for franchise sales at Burger King , said the marriage between gasoline and fast food is a natural . &quot; They have a large similarity in the characteristic of the customers . Both businesses are very convenience-driven , &quot; he said . Taco Bell , which is owned by Pepsico Inc. , operates 200 convenience_store restaurants and plans to open another 100 by year ' s end . &quot; Our research shows that time is the currency of the ' 90s , &quot; Schroder said . Before Happy Mart added fast food , Pikeville residents with a hankering for Taco Bell had to drive about 70 miles to Hazard . Now , there are three Taco Bell Expresses within a_few miles of each other , with more to come . The arrangement also has allowed Baskin Robbins Inc. to expand in the area . Before linking up with Happy Marts in November , Baskin Robbins had only two stores in all_of eastern Kentucky . Coleman Oil has tripled that . &quot; The population and the traffic just does not support the cost involved in a full-scale store , &quot; said Baskin Robbins spokeswoman Lisa van Velthuyzen . But hook_up_with an existing operation , she said , &quot; and that suddenly becomes very viable. &quot; Most of the fast-food operations are franchise relationships , with the gas distributor as the franchisee . But Tom Osborne , spokesman for the Society of Independent Gasoline Marketers , said some restaurant owners are becoming franchisees of the gasoline distributors . The concept is commanding strong interest in the oil_industry . The Petroleum Marketers Assn . of America , whose members sell about half the nation ' s gasoline , invited Burger King to offer a convenience_store seminar at its fall convention in New Orleans . &quot; That room was overflowing , &quot; said association spokesman David Morehead . &quot; I had to have chairs brought_in , and people were literally spilling into the halls . So the interest is there. &quot;</TEXT>
