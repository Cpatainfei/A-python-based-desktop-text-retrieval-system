   <TEXT> In 1990 , when Jake Winebaum was senior_vice_president of U.S. News &amp; World Report and his wife was pregnant with their first child , he considered buying a financially troubled windsurfing magazine . He decided against it , but while he was throwing_away some old issues , inspiration struck . &quot; A cover caught my eye of a guy windsurfing with his daughter , &quot; says Winebaum , 34 , for whom the image and headline -- &quot; Fun &quot; -- made a connection . &quot; I said , ' There ' s a magazine idea : family fun. ' &quot; Conceiving a slick , advice-driven monthly that would offer suggestions for family &quot; quality time &quot; activities , Winebaum launched FamilyFun in 1991 using mostly his own money . Disney Magazine Publishing bought_it after the second issue , but while the magazine caught_on with the time-starved mothers and fathers of the ' 90s , Winebaum soon noticed the irony of a magazine about family leisure_time often forcing him to work late . He asked Disney for a computer so he could bring work home , and his daughter Jenna ' s reaction to his Macintosh Centris gave him the idea for his newest magazine , FamilyPC , which arrived on newsstands last month . &quot; ( Jenna ) at that time was about 20 months old . Instantly , she took_to ( the computer ) . She figured_out with a little help from me that moving the mouse moved the cursor around the page , &quot; he says . &quot; Within a day , she could basically navigate kids ' programs. &quot; After seeing friends ' children perform similar feats , he decided the time was right for a new magazine targeting families with home computers . Winebaum took his idea to Disney and computer magazinepublisher Ziff-Davis , which agreed to publish it as a joint_venture . The first issue , dated September / October , offers suggestions in plain English for families on choosing and using computers . The issue rates multimedia computer_systems and color printers , evaluates educational_programs and multimedia encyclopedias in a family testing lab , and gives practical instructions for such home computing activities as high-tech Halloween parties and electronic pen-palling . &quot; The computer is this immensely powerful device that can do anything , ( and ) people are just figuring_out how to harness this power for the home , &quot; says Winebaum , editor and publisher of FamilyPC as well as president and editor in chief of FamilyFun . Today ' s multimedia-ready computers often come equipped with such features as fax modems and photo CD capability , Winebaum says , and many families don ' t take full advantage of those capabilities . &quot; What do you do with a fax modem at_home ? I guarantee we will be able to come_up with 10 of the coolest things to do with a fax at home. &quot; Speaking from his magazines ' editorial offices in Northampton , Mass. , Winebaum sounds so enthusiastic it ' s easy to believe he might come_up with seven of those ideas by himself . Some of the ideas in FamilyFun have grown out of activities Winebaum has tried with his family , says the magazine ' s editor , Alexandra Kennedy , and his family computer activities could provide similar fodder for FamilyPC . &quot; Jenna and I did a ( computer ) project last week -- ' cause I do live the life , &quot; Winebaum says . &quot; We had a bunch of photographs ( of Jenna ' s introduction to her baby sister , Tess ) . I had a photo CD of them made ( and ) I took a program called ' Kid ' s Studio , ' a multimedia authoring program for 6-year-olds , and took the photo CDs and created a little story with Jenna that she narrated. &quot; Of course , such family projects require certain types of computer_hardware and software , and FamilyPC provides activity ideas as well as buying guidance . &quot; The minute I told anybody at a dinner_party or at_work that I was working_on this magazine , they ' d pin me in the corner and say , ' Write down what computer I should buy , ' &quot; Winebaum says . &quot; ( It ) is one of the most considered purchases. &quot; Families nervous about buying the multimedia equivalent of a Betamax VCR certainly may need that buying advice , but Winebaum ' s magazine isn ' t the only one giving it . Home PC , launched earlier this year by CMP Publications , targets a broader audience of home computer users , and in October , Scholastic Inc. will reintroduce Family Computing , delivering it directly to some readers of Parent &amp; Child and Home_Office Computing . Still , the combined marketing expertise of Ziff-Davis and Disney gives FamilyPC plenty of clout , and Winebaum ' s magazine instincts are_well regarded . &quot; He ' s got a sterling track record , &quot; says Anne Russell , editor-in-chief of Folio , a trade publication for the magazine business . &quot; The thing that ' s interesting about Winebaum ' s formula is it ' s participatory . . . it ' s for the family. &quot; Winebaum ' s work sometimes keeps him away from the Manhattan home he shares with his wife , Cindy , and their daughters . The launch of FamilyPC has forced him to do some extra business travel , and he usually spends at least two days a week in his magazines ' Northampton offices . Given the enormous time commitment involved , &quot; it ' s sort of ironic to start a start-up magazine about families , &quot; he says by phone while driving from Northampton to New York . &quot; He ' s always juggling everything , &quot; Kennedy says . Still , &quot; There ' s any number of times he ' s tearing out of the office saying , ' I ' ve got_to go_home and put Jenna to bed. ' &quot;</TEXT>
