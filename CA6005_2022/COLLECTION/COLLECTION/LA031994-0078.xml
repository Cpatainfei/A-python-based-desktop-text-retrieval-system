   <HEADLINE> THE STYLE FILES : THE PAIN ; MAGNIFICENT OBSESSIONS ; JUST HOW FAR DO SOME WOMEN REALLY GO TO LOOK GOOD ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The things we do for love ? They pale in comparison to the things we do for vanity . Here , the real-life stories -- honest -- of seven women with magnificent obsessions . In 1975 , Janet Mizrahi found the perfect eyeliner when a friend came_back from Europe with a glass vial of powdery gray kohl , bought_at an Algerian pharmacy in Paris . &quot; You dipped this little pencil into the granules and outlined your eyes , &quot; says Mizrahi , an aspiring novelist . &quot; It was the best eyeliner I ' d ever had , it never faded or smeared . I used it for 10 years , and every time my friend went_to Paris she would bring me back more kohl. &quot; But in time , the friend stopped going_to Paris . Then Mizrahi ' s kohl bottle broke . Life hasn ' t been the same since . &quot; I ' ve tried pencils , I ' ve tried liquid liners , I ' ve tried cake , &quot; Mizrahi says . &quot; I ' ve spent hundreds of dollars on various eye-lining materials , to no avail. &quot; Three years ago , says Mizrahi , &quot; Rumor had it that a grocery in North Hollywood carried beauty products from the Middle_East . So I drove over there -- and , of course , they did not . As I was driving_home , I had a terrible car accident , with $ 8 # 000 worth of damage to my car . The lawsuit is still going_on . And had I not been in search of that damn kohl this might never have happened. &quot; that ' s when she abandoned the search as too costly . &quot; Now I walk_around looking_like an old_lady with nasty eyes , &quot; says Mizrahi . If ever a cosmetic was jinxed , it may be this kohl . Mizrahi ' s jet-setting friend and original source of the kohl lives in the San Francisco Bay area . She lost her vial of kohl in the Oakland fire . In the late ' 80s , when Angela Friedman , a British insurance_agent living_in Los Angeles , would phone her mother in Liverpool , the first order_of_business was blush . Specifically Sun Stick bronzer from Ultima II and where to get their hands on it . &quot; We really loved this blush , &quot; says Friedman . &quot; It screwed_up from the bottom like deodorant , it was creamy and had a sheen to it . We both used the same shade , and we ' d put it not only on our cheekbones but on our nose and brow and chin -- it really gave our pale English skin a sun-kissed glow. &quot; Friedman speaks lovingly of the blush ' s other assets : it was inexpensive , stayed neat in her purse , lasted a long_time . Too long -- by the time mother and daughter ran_out , the Sun Stick had been discontinued . &quot; We tried to buy_it , but it was too late , &quot; says Friendman , who looked in L.A. department_stores , drug stores and discount_stores . &quot; My mom would take the bus all_over Liverpool . When we ' d speak on the phone we ' d say , ' Did you find it ? ' It was an international affair . We ' re talking $ 60- , $ 70-phone calls , all about this silly makeup. &quot; She still pines for the blush that faded . There is a glimmer of hope , though : When a Revlon spokeswoman heard about this mother-daughter obsession , she promised to look_into the possibility of a product reintroduction . See , they do care . All beauty quests aren ' t in vain , although they may take years to realize . In 1984 , publicist Prudence Baird was sitting in a restaurant when she saw a woman at another table . &quot; I kept staring at her beautiful skin , which seemed back-lit , it was so translucent , &quot; says Baird . &quot; My companion said , ' that ' s Barbra Streisand. ' I said , ' No it ' s not. ' I didn ' t recognize her , I was so mesmerized by her skin. &quot; The search was_on to find the facialist responsible . &quot; I asked everyone who had ever dealt with Streisand , &quot; says Baird . &quot; The woman who runs her foundations . A senior v.p. at a major movie studio . A woman who brought Streisand to a party once . Her make-up person . I left my name on answering machines all_over town . And because my last_name isn ' t Spielberg or Lucas , I guess I never got a call back. &quot; Baird had facials at posh salons in both New York and Los Angeles , always asking the inevitable question . A decade passed . She had just about given_up hope when she mentioned her search to a reporter friend , who made a_few phone_calls . Twenty-five minutes later , Baird had the facialist ' s name . And it wasn ' t one of the famous skin fraus she expected . &quot; She ' s just a fine facialist who sells a terrific line of all-natural products , &quot; says Baird . She immediately made an appointment , &quot; which , by the way , I could not get for 11 weeks . So if you ' re going to ask me the name of this facialist , I will not tell you . Because I will not wait that long for my next appointment. &quot; There ' s a small refrigerator tucked inside an etagere in actress Diahann Carroll ' s bedroom , stocked with whole_milk . She doesn ' t drink the stuff , she bathes in it . &quot; It ' s not really as glamorous as it sounds , &quot; she says . &quot; I dump two quarts of milk into the bathwater , along with some unscented vegetable_oil . Years ago , a dermatologist recommended that I bathe in milk because my skin is lacking in fatty_acids , and so ever since the ' 60s I ' ve been doing this , twice a day. &quot; When she ' s on_the_road , room service supplies the recommended daily allowance of milk . &quot; Actually , it ' s in my contract , &quot; Carroll says . But she ' s always been good-humored about it . &quot; My sister played a joke on me once , &quot; says Carroll . &quot; I was getting ready for my TV_show , ' Julia , ' and she ran the bath and filled the tub with chocolate_milk ! Just as I was stepping_in I said , ' What is this ? ' And she said , ' We don ' t want to lose an ounce of your pretty brown color. ' &quot; Women who wear waterproof mascara have special needs : like a means of removing it without losing their eyelashes in the process . that ' s why publicist Linda Ford is addicted to Effacil Eye Makeup Remover Gel from Lancome . &quot; It works better than anything , &quot; says Ford , who ' s been using the product for 10 years . In 1990 , when she discovered it had been discontinued , Ford bought_out the entire Effacil inventory at Nordstrom . &quot; Then I went_to Bullock ' s Westwood , &quot; says Ford , &quot; and the salesclerk said , ' Somebody beat you to it -- we ' ve already sold out. ' &quot; The Effacil drought lasted 1 1 / 2 years until Lancome brought it back due_to consumer demand . In the interim , &quot; I was out of Effacil for about six months , and it was hell , &quot; says Ford . &quot; that ' s my only obsession -- although I do have a savings account_for plastic_surgery when I get older. &quot; Who hasn ' t hesitated to scrub off a really flattering professional make-over , knowing that you ' ll never look that good again ? But there is an option available if you ' re game . Hank Harmon , a realtor in Encino , has her face made_up every month by Eugenia Weston , owner of Valencia-based Senna Cosmetics . Harmon has kept these standing appointments for more_than 20 years because , she says , &quot; Eugenia is probably one of the finest make-up artists in the world. &quot; And who messes with a work_of_art ? &quot; If she does my face on a Saturday , &quot; says Harmon , &quot; I ' ll leave the eye makeup on for a_few days -- Saturday , Sunday , Monday , Tuesday . Of course , I always wash the foundation off every night . But if you just clean around your eyes with a Q-tip , the eye makeup stays_on for a_couple_of days. &quot; Although Weston is flattered to have her work preserved in such a way , she doesn ' t recommend it . Says Harmon , &quot; The only reason Eugenia doesn ' t kill me is because I take very good care of my skin . And if you have good skin , it ' s easier to do some of these unorthodox things. &quot; Film_producer Linda Obst can ' t live without Philip B. ' s botanical shampoo and conditioners . Nothing else touches her hair , even on location . When she ran_out of his products on the set of &quot; Sleepless in Seattle , &quot; Obst had Philip overnight her a dozen bottles each of peppermint / avocado shampoo ( $ 16 ) , African shea butter conditioning cream ( $ 18 ) , apple cider_vinegar finishing rinse ( $ 15 ) , and rejuvenating oil treatment ( $ 25 ) from his Beverly Hills studio . Product deprivation struck again recently on the set of her new film , &quot; Bad Girls , &quot; on location in Sonora , Mexico . This time Philip shipped Obst six bottles of each product by Federal Express , enough to keep her supplied no matter how long the shoot runs .</TEXT>
