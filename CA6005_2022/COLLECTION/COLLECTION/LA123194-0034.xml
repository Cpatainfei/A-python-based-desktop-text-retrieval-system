   <HEADLINE> BULLETS FIRED AT THE WHITE_HOUSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Re &quot; Bullets Fired at White_House ; No One Injured , &quot; Dec . 18 : For the second time in recent months the White_House has come under gun attack . Due_to the routine occurrence of gun violence in our society these incidents have taken_up 30 seconds of news time and have raised little ire . Most Americans still believe that gun violence is just a symptom of &quot; bad &quot; neighborhoods and therefore is little cause for concern . However , when firearms are used repeatedly on the White_House it may be time for Americans to realize what a severe problem we have with the multitude of firearms in our country . It may also be time for President Clinton to take a tough stand against guns . U . SETH OTTENSOSER Los Angeles * It seems to me that in a country which has invested trillions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives fighting for our national security , one which has endured assassinations and consistent attempts on our presidents , we would take the protection of our President more seriously than we do . But Jesse Helms said it was all a joke ; that he was only kidding when he suggested a bodyguard for the President when he visited certain military bases . A veteran has attempted to shoot the President , another man tried to crash his plane in the White_House , and someone actually shot bullets through the windows of the chief_executive ' s residence . I ' m not at all surprised at these recent attacks ; when a U.S. senator can &quot; joke &quot; sympathetically about harming the President , it encourages nut cases to act_on his power fantasies . GARRY HOWARD Beverly Hills * When the White_House is attacked , you , as Americans , are under_attack also . It is not only the President who is endangered in this latest gunning of the government . This reaches_into every home_in America , Democrats or Republicans . Whether or not they are gunning for Newt Gingrich or the President , this is the third time such a shameful incident has occurred . Thinking Americans must begin to do their own analysis of right and wrong instead of being led down a perilous path by shameful talk-show hosts who are disseminating their vitriolic spew daily against Democrats or any issues they desire . Any addition to President Clinton ' s crime bill should include a provision making_it a crime to allow radio and talk-show hosts to incite violence against the government or any person , elected or not . This would shut the mouths of the Colorado Springs Chuck Bakers and the Rush Limbaughs . These hosts are prone to incite anger . Does the GOP &quot; contract with America &quot; include such unwarranted , unrelenting , scurrilous attacks on sitting presidents of the United States ? Why would they invite Rush Limbaugh to celebrate with them ? A talk-show host from Colorado was forced to resign his radio post after the White_House was attacked previously by a lone gunman , who was apprehended by thinking Americans . The host was cited for inciting violence by his radio audience . Now , the latest attack on the White_House by an angered gunman is another indication of such violence . When will it stop ? If Limbaugh thinks that his friendship with Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas gives him full throttle to freedom_of_speech , it ' s time for a change . HELEN R . WILSON Hemet</TEXT>
