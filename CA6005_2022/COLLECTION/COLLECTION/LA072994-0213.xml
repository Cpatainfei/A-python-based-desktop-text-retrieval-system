   <HEADLINE> HUGHES UPS THE ANTE IN SATELLITE NETWORK ; COMMUNICATIONS : THE COMPANY PROPOSES EXPANDED SYSTEM TO COVER THE GLOBE . OTHERSALSO HAVE BIG PLANS FOR SPACE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A mad scramble to build electronic highways in space -- and to pay_for them -- got crazier Thursday when Hughes Communications proposed a fivefold expansion of its plan to launch a system of satellites offering two-way voice , video and data services . Just eight months after unveiling a $ 660-million Spaceway project that would target only the United States , Hughes has gone_back to the Federal Communications Commission seeking permission to build an expanded $ 3.2-billion worldwide system . The Hughes expansion seemed to reflect a brightening outlook for the role of satellites -- in addition to fiber-optic cable and cellular technologies -- as Earth becomes connected on the fast-evolving information superhighway . &quot; As we continued to do technical work and market analysis , &quot; said Kevin McGrath , chief_executive of Hughes , &quot; we realized that the things that make this proposal attractive in the U.S. make_it even more attractive for the rest of the world. &quot; The new Hughes plan comes just four months after Teledesic , a company started with seed money from Microsoft Corp . founder Bill Gates and McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. , astounded the world with an ambitious plan to build a $ 9-billion network using 840 low-orbiting satellites . But that ' s not all . Other proposals in the works include a similar 48-satellite system from Loral Corp . of New York and a 77-satellite system from Motorola to offer worldwide mobile communications services . Teledesic says it finds Hughes ' new proposal encouraging . &quot; We see this as an endorsement of our assertion of the global demand for broad-band services , &quot; said Russell Daggatt , president of Kirkland , Wash.-based Teledesic . &quot; There is room for many competitors providing different kinds of services. &quot; Hughes ' McGrath , who met unsuccessfully with McCaw last month to discuss possible cooperation between their two companies , agreed there is room enough in space for all_the applicants and more . The companies are now working with the FCC on ways to efficiently share the type of frequency required to operate many of the networks . The first hurdle is finding the cash . Motorola was first in the race and has already lined_up some deep-pocketed Japanese backers . Teledesic has a_few million dollars in seed money from its two wealthy founders , but has yet to line_up a major backer . Hughes is owned by General Motors but says it needs major strategic partners both to help finance the project and market its services . The money will go_to the plan that offers the best reward for the least risk , and Hughes contends its plan for nine satellites to cover the globe is quicker and far less risky than Teledesic ' s complex proposal . Hughes would have two satellites operational for the United States by 1998 and the rest in place by 2000 . Since the satellites are &quot; geostationary , &quot; meaning they float 22 # 300 miles high above a certain point , each satellite could be put into use as soon as it is in position . Fewer satellites also means fewer risky rocket launches . * By contrast , the Teledesic plan would require hundreds of successful rocket launches before it could begin service , since its satellites would be placed in fast-moving , low orbits about 435 miles above Earth . Teledesic ' s Daggatt says the low-orbit approach allows users to get service with smaller , cheaper receivers . He says the Hughes system would have difficulty offering many kinds of communications services because its satellites would be so far from Earth there would be split-second delays in transmission . Both companies , however , agree that satellite systems are an important supplement to current telecommunications_systems . Daggatt sees a combination of cellular and satellite service as the most economical means of providing phone_service to developing countries . McGrath sees satellites providing crucial communications services to multinationals everywhere . An oil_company that had drilling samples from an oil_rig , for example , could beam that information for evaluation by its supercomputers at_home with just a 26-inch antenna and a two-way communications_system . If such systems were sold in the millions , as Hughes hopes , they would cost less than $ 1 # 000 each . * RECORD PROFIT : Hughes Communications parent General Motors reported its highest quarterly earnings ever .
