   <HEADLINE> AIRLINES UNDETERRED BY VIETNAM POLITICAL SNAGS ; TRAVEL : U.S. CARRIERS LAY GROUNDWORK FOR FLIGHTS WHILE AWAITING DIPLOMATIC NORMALIZATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. airlines eager for business in Vietnam are finding that politics still hampers them , despite the end of America ' s 19-year economic embargo . The United States lifted sanctions against Vietnam on Feb . 3 , but it has yet to establish diplomatic relations with its onetime enemy . The normalization of relations usually precedes the signing of the aviation agreements that allow regular passenger flights . In the interim , Delta , United , Northwest and Continental are taking intermediate steps to establish service to Vietnam , including coordinating schedules and ticket sales with Vietnam Airlines , the state-owned flag carrier . Airline industry_analysts say demand for flights to Vietnam has strong long-term potential , although they hesitate to quantify it . They say the country is inadequately served by existing carriers . &quot; It ' s simply a function of the fact that new routes are going_to be given_out to Vietnam , &quot; said Candace Browning , an analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . in New York . &quot; that ' s the reason everyone ' s interested. &quot; U.S. airlines are working to make_up for lost time . Delta Air Lines signed a letter_of_intent last month with Vietnam Airlines for joint scheduling and marketing ; it expects a formal agreement this year . United Airlines , which signed an agreement with Vietnam Airlines in February , 1993 , applied to the U.S._government for permission to fly from Los Angeles to Ho Chi Minh City , formerly Saigon . Northwest Airlines has asked_for approval to fly from Detroit to Ho Chi Minh City via Tokyo . And Continental Airlines in February renewed a request for permission to fly to Vietnam via Guam , its Pacific hub . Freight shipments between the two countries also stand to gain . Federal Express Corp . of Memphis , Tenn. , plans to start cargo flights this month to Hanoi , Danang and Ho Chi Minh City . Although the United States has not said when it might establish full diplomatic relations with Vietnam , Vietnam Airlines stands ready to negotiate an air services agreement , said Nguyen Duc Vinh , the company ' s deputy director general . The airline hopes to fly its own jets to the United States as early as this year , said Dao Manh Nhuong , deputy director general of Vietnam ' s civil aviation administration . At stake is an expected surge in air_travel to Vietnam by business people , war veterans , tourists and Vietnamese Americans , who number about 1 million . Nhuong estimates Americans could account_for up_to 30 % of airline passenger traffic to Vietnam by 1995 . The increased business may result in a boom for aircraft manufacturers . But the end of sanctions hasn ' t brought any quick sales for Seattle-based Boeing Co. , the U.S. aircraft maker favored by Vietnam Airlines . Robert Laird , Boeing ' s regional sales director , has made 14 trips to Hanoi during the past two years , positioning his company for a part in the airline ' s plan to spend $ 1 billion on fleet expansion by 2000 . &quot; Vietnam is an untapped aviation market with enormous potential , so there are a lot of people beating the doors down to talk with them , &quot; Laird said during a recent visit here . The company expects to sell 60 to 80 aircraft -- worth $ 3 billion to $ 5 billion -- over the next 10 to 15 years , Laird said . It must compete , of course , with the two other makers of large passenger jets , Europe ' s Airbus Industrie consortium and St . Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp . Boeing ' s years on the commercial sidelines may have hurt its prospects here , Laird acknowledged . But he predicted that Vietnam Airlines , which plans this year to expand its network to fly to France , Germany and Japan , will buy aircraft from more_than one supplier . The company plans to buy 30 to 40 new aircraft by the end of the century in its bid to become a leading Southeast Asian regional carrier . &quot; In the next 10 to 15 years , they could easily become the size of a Thai Airways , a Cathay Pacific or a Singapore Airlines , &quot; Laird said . Vietnam Airlines owns 18 planes , 16 of which are Soviet-built Tupolevs , Ilushins and Yakolevs -- all at least a decade old . The airline uses Soviet planes only for domestic_flights , and it hopes to phase them out completely by the end of 1995 , Nhuong said . Vietnam Airlines leases two Boeing 767s and five Airbus A-320s with foreign pilots and crews for its international_flights .</TEXT>
