   <HEADLINE> EXPORTS IN OVERDRIVE ; SUDDENLY U.S. AUTO SALES SURGE OVERSEAS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Boxy Jeep Cherokees built by Chrysler in Toledo -- Ohio , that is -- zip down Germany ' s autobahns from Bonn to Berlin . Right-hand-drive Ford Probes made in Flat Rock , Mich. , draw stares on London streets . And wide-bodied Chevrolet Caprice sedans , assembled in Texas , are status symbols in Saudi_Arabia . Once shunned as shoddy , shameless models of excess , U.S. vehicles now carry a certain cache internationally . The surprising result is that the Big Three auto_makers quietly have become a significant exporting force . Together , Chrysler , Ford and General Motors exported nearly 350 # 000 vehicles from North_American plants last year . That was up 18 % from 1992 -- and a more_than fourfold increase from 1986 levels . Exports easily could double again in the next five years , industry officials estimate . While nowhere near the same league as Japan -- which exported 5 million cars last year , including 1.6 million to the United States -- the Big Three are showing that their newest products have global appeal . &quot; We ' re selling more cars and trucks in a tougher global market because we ' re building better products , &quot; said Andrew Card , president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Assn . that ' s hardly the only reason for the export boom . North_America has become an efficient , low-cost manufacturing center . The weak dollar makes U.S. products cheaper abroad . Trade_barriers are coming_down . The telecommunications revolution is resulting in a growing convergence of consumer tastes worldwide . And Detroit companies are headed by a new generation of leaders with international experience and global vision . These forces have resulted in some profound changes in the North_American vehicle market . The Big Three themselves were net vehicle importers through the 1980s and early ' 90s . Detroit sold as_many as 400 # 000 Japanese-made vehicles under U.S. nameplates . That reversed in 1992 . Last year , GM , Ford and Chrysler exported twice as_many vehicles as they imported . With the construction by Japanese car_makers of U.S. assembly_plants in recent years , total U.S. imports dropped from 4.6 million vehicles in 1986 to 2.2 million last year . The Japanese , too , are exporting vehicles from the United States . Together , Honda , Nissan and Toyota exported 93 # 700 vehicles from U.S. plants last year , mostly to Japan . With a strong yen , Japanese production in the United States is expected to continue growing . So will the Japanese makers ' U.S. exports . And German auto_makers also are gearing_up U.S. production to take_advantage of lower operating_costs . In September , BMW begins production in South Carolina of its 3-Series sedan . Operating costs will be a third less at its Greer , S.C. , plant than in Germany . Mercedes-Benz is building a plant in Alabama , with plans to export half the sport-utility vehicles built there to Europe . In terms of their total sales , Big Three exports are still quite small . The U.S. industry sold 13.9 million cars and trucks last year . Exports amounted to only about 2.5 % of the total . But the export growth came_in the face of severely depressed markets in Europe and Japan . And looking_forward , exports could provide an important hedge against an economic downturn in the United States , analysts say . Yet there clearly are limits . Both GM and Ford have extensive global manufacturing operations . Neither wants to compete for_sales with their own foreign units . Instead , their focus is_on finding underserved niches , such_as the minivan or sport-utility markets . Market differences also may hamper exports . Because of lower gas prices in America , the Big Three ' s vehicles tend to be bigger and less fuel efficient than the popular-selling cars in Europe , Japan and Latin_America . &quot; America is not going_to be a great exporter of vehicles , &quot; said Ford Vice_Chairman Allan Gilmour . But such thinking is no longer universal . Another school of thought holds that market differences are narrowing because of rapid changes in the global flow of information . &quot; We ' re finding that as the world gets smaller and smaller through mass communications and transportation technology , automobile markets worldwide are becoming more and more similar , &quot; said Thomas Gale , vice_president of design and international operations for Chrysler . If that ' s correct , well-built , well-designed U.S. vehicles may have appeal in other countries with only minimal modifications . As a case_in_point , consider Chrysler ' s minivans and sport-utility vehicles . With only minor changes from its U.S. cousin , the Voyager / Caravan minivan is finding eager buyers in Europe . Likewise , the Jeep Cherokee and upscale Grand Cherokee are in_demand in Germany , Taiwan and Argentina . Chrysler also is producing right-hand-drive Cherokees for Japan , Great Britain and Australia at its plant in Ohio . Altogether , the company exported 132 # 000 vehicles last year , up 26 % from 1992 . The sales abroad were more cars than Volkswagen , Volvo , BMW , Mercedes , Audi , Isuzu , Subaru and Hyundai sold , individually , in America during the same 12 months . One reason for the export successes is that Detroit has learned a lot from these competitors and others . The Big Three have adapted Japanese production techniques to become more efficient and measured their cars against their rivals ' best to improve quality . While the Big Three still trail the Japanese in quality surveys , the gap in defects has narrowed . In fact , some say the differences are negligible . &quot; All three domestic manufacturers are better than the Japanese were when they established their reputation for bullet-proof quality , &quot; said Chrysler President Robert Lutz . &quot; The rankings distort reality. &quot; Chrysler may be emerging as the world ' s most efficient and profitable car_company . Many analysts say much of the reason is that it used Honda as a model for its corporate face-lift . And Ford and GM , too , are using their ties to Japanese competitors to help boost exports . The sporty Probe , for example , was designed with Mazda ' s assistance ; Probes roll_off the line right behind Mazda 626s and MX-6s at the companies ' joint Auto Alliance International assembly_plant in Flat Rock . Last year , Ford shipped 11 # 000 Probes abroad , mostly to Europe . Exports should grow now that the plant has been expanded and modified to build right-hand-drive Probes . The first such models , destined for Great Britain , were driven_off the line in December . The cars eventually will be sold in Japan and Australia , as well . Ford , with total exports of 71 # 000 vehicles last year , also is planning right-hand-drive versions of its Explorer and Taurus for_sale in Japan later in the decade . The redesigned 1994 Mustang will go_on sale in Japan in mid-May . &quot; We have a shot at exporting 100 # 000 ( vehicles ) next year , &quot; said Alexander Trotman , Ford ' s chairman and chief_executive . &quot; Our aspiration is to go_for 250 # 000 by 1998. &quot; GM also is seeking to bolster its exports from last year ' s 139 # 000 cars and trucks . It recently signed an agreement with Toyota for the sale of 20 # 000 right-hand-drive Chevrolet Cavaliers in Japan . The cars will be built_in Lordstown , Ohio . But GM ' s most aggressive export move is production of a minivan at its Doraville , Ga. , plant for_sale in Europe under its Opel badge . Up to 30 % of the plant ' s output may be dedicated to vehicles for_sale abroad . Some analysts attribute the Big Three ' s newfound interest in exporting to the new leaders who have assumed the top operating posts in the last 15 months . John F . Smith , GM ' s chief_executive_officer , established his reputation as head of GM ' s European and international operations . Trotman ran Ford of Europe . And Chrysler ' s CEO , Robert Eaton , was recruited from GM-Europe . They all have a broad understanding of global competition and consumer demands in different markets . &quot; Because they have international experience , they bring a totally new personality to the American auto_companies , &quot; said Maryann Keller , analyst with Furman Selz , a New York brokerage . &quot; It makes them more flexible. &quot; Flexible , perhaps , but still tough -- particularly when it comes_to Japan . The main reason is the stubborn U.S. trade_deficit , estimated at a record $ 59 billion for 1993 . Sixty percent of the imbalance is related to autos and auto parts . So even as the Big Three have rebounded , they have pressed their fair-trade case against Japan with renewed vigor . Detroit notes that while exports are up strongly , the gains have little to do with Japan , where U.S. car_makers sold just 17 # 093 North American-built vehicles last year . The auto_makers say it is nearly impossible to sell cars in Japan because of difficult certification rules and lack of access to dealer networks . The Japanese argue that U.S. auto_makers have not built cars for the Japanese market and that product quality is poor . In the current &quot; framework trade talks &quot; between the two countries , the Administration wants Japan to accept numerical targets for vehicle sales and auto parts purchases . But such quotas are difficult for Japan to swallow . Its market has been shrinking for three years , and it is under pressure to limit exports to Europe . More competition at_home from Detroit could only hurt Japanese manufacturers . Still , the Big Three last month dispatched Card , their chief lobbyist and former U.S. transportation_secretary , to take Detroit ' s case to the Japanese consumer . His message : The average Japanese is paying higher prices because GM , Ford and Chrysler are being kept_out . &quot; American auto_makers and Japanese consumers will both benefit , &quot; Card preached , &quot; from the same open access to Japan ' s market that Japanese auto_makers have enjoyed in the United States for decades. &quot; Big Three Exports Are Booming... Beyond recent gains , industry officials estimate that exports will at least double in the next five years . 04 # 17 , 14 # 14 , 16 Auto_maker 1992 exports 1993 exports Percent change Chrysler * 104 # 723 132 # 123 + 26 % Ford 50 # 090 70 # 999 + 42 % General Motors * 134 # 506 139 # 435 + 6 % Total 289 # 319 342 # 557 + 18 % * Includes sales of knock-down kits for assembly of vehicles abroad and sales to U.S. military_personnel overseas . ... but Japanese Exports From the U.S. Are Flat Exports from Japanese plants in the United States dipped in 1993 , largely due_to a drop_in exports of Honda Accords because of a model changeover . Honda expects to export 75 # 000 vehicles this year . 04 # 17 , 14 # 14 , 16 Auto_maker 1992 exports 1993 exports Percent change Honda 55 # 850 41 # 694 -25 % Nissan * 829 3 # 457 + 317 % Toyota 43 # 536 48 # 549 + 12 % Total 100 # 215 93 # 700 -7 % * Mainly represents exports of new Altima sedan . Still , Japan Remains Wary of U.S.-Made Cars Only a small percentage of Japanese consumers say they would be willing to purchase a car manufactured by the Big Three . Don ' t want to purchase at all : 68 % Definitely want to purchase : 2 % May purchase : 9 % Not likely to purchase : 21 % And Japanese car_dealers say the Big Three need to improve almost every part of their operations if they hope to boost sales in Japan , including : Parts supply system : Percent of import-brand dealers citing need to improve : 46.8 % Percent of Japanese-brand dealers citing need to improve : 78.8 Service system : Percent of import-brand dealers citing need to improve : 49.4 Percent of Japanese-brand dealers citing need to improve : 73.9 Suitability to Japanese conditions : Percent of import-brand dealers citing need to improve : 56.2 Percent of Japanese-brand dealers citing need to improve : 67.3 Trade-In market : Percent of import-brand dealers citing need to improve : 45.1 Percent of Japanese-brand dealers citing need to improve : 53.5 Price : Percent of import-brand dealers citing need to improve : 47.7 Percent of Japanese-brand dealers citing need to improve : 42.9 Fuel economy : Percent of import-brand dealers citing need to improve : 25.5 Percent of Japanese-brand dealers citing need to improve : 38.0 Sources : Car_companies ; Japanese Consumer Research Institute ; Japanese Fair Trade Commission ; Japanese Automobile Manufacturers Assn .</TEXT>
