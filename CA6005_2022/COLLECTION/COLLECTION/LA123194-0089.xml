   <HEADLINE> A DIRECTOR ' S METHOD AMID THE MADNESS ; MOVIES : JOHN SCHLESINGER WON AN OSCAR FOR ' MIDNIGHT COWBOY. ' SO WHAT ' S HE GOT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For a man who has spent half his life in the pursuit of making movies , John Schlesinger is surprisingly gloomy about the process . &quot; I don ' t think , by and large , I have had too many enjoyable films , &quot; he sighs . &quot; Not many were without problems. &quot; It seems an odd admission . He is known for fluid , visually interesting movies , often packed with intriguing background detail ; if anyone makes directing look effortless , it ' s Schlesinger . Consider his trio of 1960s British films ( &quot; Billy Liar , &quot; &quot; Darling , &quot; &quot; Far From the Madding Crowd &quot; ) that made Julie Christie a star and Schlesinger a name to reckon with ; the recently revived &quot; Midnight Cowboy , &quot; which won him a 1969 Oscar ; or &quot; Sunday Bloody Sunday , &quot; his stylish essay about a bisexual who has affairs with a man and his female partner . Now fast forward to his pair of dramas written by playwright Alan Bennett for BBC television : &quot; An Englishman Abroad &quot; and &quot; A Question of Attribution , &quot; widely deemed some of the best film work ever done for TV . If all this was tough going , Schlesinger hasn ' t let it show . &quot; Oh , yes , &quot; he insists in rich , fruity tones . &quot; Midnight Cowboy &quot; was miserable to make . The actors were lovely , but the New York camera crew were bolshie and union-minded . They actually confiscated a Polaroid my assistant was using to take pictures of possible extras from the crowds watching the shooting. &quot; His jovial mood turns ; his face clouds . &quot; They were hostile ; I hated them . And none of them will ever be employed by me again. &quot; Schlesinger , 68 , lives in a flat in the south Kensington district -- light , airy , beautifully restored , and six floors up in a Victorian redbrick building -- to talk_about his new film , &quot; The Innocent , &quot; which will be released by Miramax early next year . This is no hardship ; he is an engaging , enthusiastic talker , possessed of thoughtful opinions and a sly wit . He is also not above off-the-record gossip about the_likes_of Gore Vidal , imparted while he rocks back and forth on his sofa , beaming cordially . But , true_to form , &quot; The Innocent , &quot; based on Ian McEwan ' s novel , has had a rocky path to the screen . It was shot in East Berlin two summers ago , but its release has been delayed for reasons related to legal problems . &quot; There ' s a lot I could say , but can ' t at the moment , &quot; Schlesinger says , guarded for the first and last time . &quot; Just know that one day I shall come_out and say it. &quot; Nor did he enjoy making the film : &quot; I found Germany depressing , not a place I feel comfortable in . Too many ghosts . Every time I walked_out_of my house I was reminded of the situation , and because I ' m Jewish it ' s inescapable. &quot; &quot; The Innocent &quot; tells of Leonard , a young , naive British telecommunications expert sent to Berlin at the height of the Cold_War in the mid-1950s to install phone taps in a tunnel secretly dug by the Allies beneath the city ' s Russian sector . He falls_in_love with Maria , a young German woman , and is befriended by Bob Glass , an American working_at the installation ; but no one is quite who they seem , loyalties are unclear -- and Leonard soon becomes party to a grisly murder and the macabre disposal of a body . It ' s a complex story , and Schlesinger has added a twist by casting the three major roles against nationality . The Englishman Leonard is played by American actor Campbell Scott ; Welshman Anthony Hopkins plays the American Bob Glass ; the role of the Berliner Maria went_to Swedish-Italian Isabella Rossellini . &quot; We did_it deliberately , &quot; says Schlesinger a little gleefully . &quot; It complicates the thing . Since it ' s a film about who is trustworthy , with characters shrouded in a strange ambiguity , it seemed to fit. &quot; This ambiguity may harm the commercial prospects for &quot; The Innocent &quot; in the United States ; high-grossing films tend to be simplistic , with a premise you can sum_up in a sentence . &quot; I can see it might not be an easy film to market , &quot; Schlesinger muses . &quot; If so , tough . The story flip-flops all_over the place . But that ' s what I liked about it . It ' s not just a thriller , not just a romance , not just a spy story , not just a black farce , but all_of those things. &quot; The film has opened in various European territories and performed disappointingly , especially in Germany and Britain . &quot; It fared better in Italy , &quot; Schlesinger says . &quot; The Germans didn ' t like the footage of the Berlin Wall_in the film . They ' re terribly sensitive , you know . The ( German ) producers wanted me to cut those scenes . Don ' t talk to me about Germans ! &quot; &quot; The Innocent &quot; seems likely to keep Schlesinger firmly in the no-man ' s land he has chosen to work . He is emphatically not a Hollywood director , although he did participate in a panel_discussion held for the 25th anniversary of &quot; Midnight Cowboy &quot; earlier this year at the Directors Guild ; and he takes pains to distance himself from the_British film_industry . &quot; I ' m not a studio fella , &quot; he says . &quot; I worked for Hollywood in happier times , but I prefer not to have umpteen studio executives breathing down your neck , and script conferences with everyone putting their ( contribution ) in. &quot; Working for the BBC , of course , is a good antidote to Hollywood interventionism ; but it merely gives Schlesinger a different set of reasons to complain . &quot; The people there have to be goosed sometimes . It ' s all , ' Don ' t worry , don ' t get excited , ' that terrible British attitude . But they ' re nice , not Machiavellian , and at least they don ' t keep saying : ' Yeah , but how ' s this gonna play in Poughkeepsie ? ' &quot; Americans , he says , &quot; know how to enthuse , know how to sell a film , know how to run with the ball. &quot; Yet he ' s suffered snubs from the big studios ; after &quot; Sunday , Bloody Sunday , &quot; not the easiest of films , Schlesinger couldn ' t get arrested in Hollywood for four years and even directed a sequence for a Munich Olympics documentary to fill_in time . After &quot; Day of the Locust &quot; and then &quot; Marathon Man &quot; with Laurence Olivier and Dustin Hoffman he seemed back in favor . But , after the critical savaging and box-office death of &quot; Honky Tonk Freeway &quot; ( 1981 ) , an absurdist vision of America ' s automobile culture , he was a pariah for four more years . He might have lived well as a gun-for-hire director , based in Los Angeles . Yet he prefers Britain ; he finds Americans obsessed by political correctness and oppressively puritanical -- laissez-faire about violence , yet &quot; embarrassed and self-righteous about sex. &quot; He was born in London , the son of a pediatrician . In World_War_II , he entertained troops with a magic act , then went_to Oxford and acted in student plays ; he was a professional actor for eight years after graduating , then trained with the BBC , making documentaries . &quot; Acting has helped me know how it feels , plunging into an emotional or sexual scene on set at 8:30 in the morning , &quot; he says . &quot; Being an actor isn ' t easy. &quot; He works well with them -- Julie Christie , Alan Bates and Jon Voight flourished with him . Hopkins says admiringly : &quot; He ' s determined in his vision , yet he accommodates your ideas. &quot; At his age one might reasonably expect him to be winding down . Not so : He recently shot &quot; Cold Comfort Farm , &quot; based on the_British 1930s comic novel , for the BBC , with Joanna Lumley of &quot; Absolutely Fabulous &quot; and Ian McKellen . &quot; It ' s getting very difficult to do subjects which aren ' t mainstream or to get films off the ground without a major star , &quot; he grumbles . &quot; Everyone you approach immediately says , ' Oh , who ' s in it ? ' And they have to make_it in the first week of release , or there are problems . They ' re not platformed as often as they used to be . &quot; Recently I had a film all set_up with Jon Voight and Sally Field , but we couldn ' t sell foreign rights . Voight ' s a wonderful actor , but apparently he was a no-no . So it fell through. &quot; He currently has two original scripts in development that deal with AIDS . &quot; They ' re about the prejudice against AIDS , and they emphasize living with it , not dying from it . This is a cause close to my heart , a cause I believe_in working for . I ' m glad ' Philadelphia ' got made and found an audience , but I don ' t think it went_deep enough. &quot; Yet given that filmmaking is beset with problems for him , what keeps him at it ? &quot; I ' m happiest when I ' m creating something , &quot; he shrugs . &quot; that ' s what gives me true pleasure . I ' m keen to go_on as long as I can. &quot;</TEXT>
