THE DISCOVERY REINFORCES THE THEORY THAT SUCH POUCHED CREATURES , NOW IDENTIFIED WITH AUSTRALIA , ORIGINATED IN NORTH_AMERICA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The fossilized jaw of a chipmunk-size , 100 million-year-old animal recovered from the rocky badlands of Utah belongs_to the world ' s oldest marsupial . The find reinforces the theory that marsupials -- those pouched creatures identified today with Australia -- originated_in North_America . The earliest previous marsupial fossil , a smaller portion of a 90-million-year-old jaw with three teeth , was also found in Utah , about a decade ago . Spectacularly complete , the new three-quarter-inch-long jaw contains six teeth , including four molars that are characteristic of marsupials . &quot; The specimen represents an extremely primitive marsupial , or it could be the ancestor of all marsupials , &quot; said Richard L . Cifelli , the University of Oklahoma paleontologist who led the 1992 summer expedition that made the find in central Utah . Cifelli named the fossil &quot; Kokopellia &quot; after the flute-playing mythical figure of Southwest Indian lore that is a frequent theme on petroglyphs in the region . The jaw was discovered and hand-quarried from a rocky outcrop by William J . May , a paleontologist from the Oklahoma Museum of Natural_History . The expedition also found well-preserved 100-million-year-old fossils of frogs , salamanders , snakes , crocodiles , a diversity of dinosaurs and a &quot; top-of-the-notch &quot; carnivorous lizard . The animals browsed and hunted in a lush , flat landscape watered by wide , slow-moving streams and bedecked with evergreens , ferns and flowering plants . The process of mountain-making had not yet begun . Of all_the fossils , the marsupial jaw has elicited the most interest . &quot; This covers a new stage in marsupial evolution and fills a gap in our knowledge of how they evolved , &quot; commented Louis L . Jacobs , professor of geological sciences at Southern Methodist University in Dallas . &quot; Cifelli has pushed them back close to the origin of modern groups of mammals , when they were living_in the shadows and footprints of the dinosaurs , &quot; he added . &quot; It ' s pretty important . We ' re tracing their roots. &quot; Marsupials -- mammals seemingly forgotten by time -- use their pouches to shelter , carry and nurse their tiny , helpless young . They include kangaroos , koalas , pouched mice and possums . Most of today ' s marsupials roam Australia and South_America , but scientists still debate their place_of_origin . One recent theory even suggested Asia , although none are left there . &quot; The age and primitiveness of Kokopellia , a suitable ancestor for all later marsupials , are important new pieces of evidence suggesting that the group originated_in North_America , &quot; said Cifelli , whose fieldwork was supported by the National Geographic Society . According to this scenario , marsupials would have spread to South_America at the end of the Cretaceous_period about 65 million years ago , and from there to Australia via Antarctica . The three southern continents were connected until about 40 million years ago . Some scientists don ' t think the new jaw proves anything one way or another . &quot; I ' ve favored a North_American origin for marsupials since the ' 60s , &quot; said Jason A . Lillegraven , a paleontologist and vertebrate-fossil expert at the University of Wyoming . &quot; But I don ' t think the case is proven from a practical point_of_view . How do you know for_sure ? You need a terribly good fossil record , probably better than we ' re ever likely to have , to be really sure. &quot; Jacobs thinks that the age and location of the jaw make a good case for North_American origin . &quot; If the geography of fossils speaks_to the geography of where things actually originated , then this supports it , &quot; he said . Scientists still debate the reasons why placental_mammals -- named for the placenta , a membrane that nourishes the embryo in the womb -- ousted the marsupials in North_America and now dominate its animal life . The only remaining North_American marsupial is the possum , which still shelters its young in a pouch long after birth . This ancient beast has not only survived among the continent ' s competing placentals , but has extended its range_in recent years , spreading north to southern Canada . Perhaps it has been successful , scientists say , because it will eat anything , live almost anywhere , multiply prolifically and treat its young so casually that all but the fittest are weeded_out .</TEXT>
