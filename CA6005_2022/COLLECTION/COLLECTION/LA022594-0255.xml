   <HEADLINE> GOP ATTACKS HANDLING OF WHITEWATER ; CONGRESS : SENATORS PRESSURE FEDERAL REGULATORS TO AGREE TO REVIEW INVESTIGATION OF ROLE PLAYED BY ROSE LAW_FIRM , AS WELL AS FIRST_LADY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Republican lawmakers mounted a furious attack on the Clinton_Administration ' s handling of the Whitewater controversy Thursday and succeeded in pressuring federal regulators into reviewing their investigation of the role that First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and her former law_firm had played . Andrew C . Hove Jr. , acting chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , agreed to call_on the FDIC ' s inspector_general to review the agency ' s investigation of the Rose Law_Firm of Little_Rock , where Mrs . Clinton was a partner . Last week , the FDIC cleared the firm of any conflict_of_interest in the tangled real_estate venture . It was the first formal government report to be issued in the controversy over the Whitewater Development Corp . Hove ' s decision came_in the midst of a Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee hearing marked by a bitter partisan split over Whitewater . Besides seeking a renewed investigation by banking regulators , Republicans -- led by Sen . Alfonse M . D ' Amato of New York -- also demanded that the White_House and the regulators release all documents related to the affair . But the Administration refused , claiming that to do so would interfere with the ongoing investigation by Robert B . Fiske Jr. , the special counsel appointed by Atty . Gen . Janet Reno . Democrats on the committee , meanwhile , dismissed Republican demands for formal hearings on Whitewater , arguing that those , too , would interfere with Fiske ' s work . &quot; I truly believe what we ' re doing is piling on in a partisan fashion , &quot; argued Sen . John Kerry ( D-Mass. ) . Thursday ' s hearing had been called to review the status of the federal_government ' s bailout of the savings and loan industry . But Republicans used the occasion to grill Administration officials and the heads of the major banking regulatory_agencies for the first time publicly about Whitewater . Among the officials attending the hearing were Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and Federal_Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan . &quot; We have an obligation to get_to the bottom of this sorry affair , &quot; D ' Amato said . &quot; And we have reasonable concerns about the integrity of the investigation &quot; by federal regulators , he added . &quot; Something smells rotten in Little Rock. &quot; They charged that Clinton political appointees like Roger Altman , deputy Treasury_secretary and acting head of the Resolution Trust Corp. , were blocking public access to critical documents in the case , and complained that congressional Democrats were unwilling to undertake an investigation of Whitewater because of political allegiance to President Clinton . &quot; Trying to get information out of the White_House about Whitewater is like trying to eat ice_cream with knitting needles , &quot; said Sen . Lauch Faircloth ( R-N.C. ) . The GOP senators pointedly referred to instances in the past in which Democrats had conducted congressional hearings while criminal investigations were under way -- such_as the inquiry into the role of Neil Bush , son of former President George_Bush , in the failure in Colorado of Silverado Savings &amp; Loan . Congress also took testimony on the Iran-Contra scandal at_the_same_time that an independent counsel was investigating the Ronald Reagan_Administration ' s handling of the_matter , the Republicans noted . &quot; If an aide to President Reagan had been found dead and another Reagan aide went_through his papers , you can bet that the Democrats would be calling_for a congressional investigation , &quot; said Sen . Phil Gramm ( R-Tex. ) , referring to the mystery surrounding the apparent suicide in July of then-Deputy White_House Counsel Vincent Foster . D ' Amato charged that the FDIC ' s eight-page report on its investigation into Whitewater was nothing more_than an &quot; inept whitewash of Whitewatergate. &quot; He also noted that a separate , newly released RTC report on the Rose firm ' s involvement in the case showed that regulators had not contacted &quot; former or current &quot; attorneys at the firm who were knowledgeable_about the issue . In 1985 , Mrs . Clinton , then a partner at the Rose firm , was hired by Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan to help the troubled thrift win approval from an Arkansas state regulator appointed by her husband , then the state ' s governor , for a novel plan to sell preferred_stock and set_up a brokerage subsidiary . At the time , the Clintons were business partners with Madison ' s owner , James B . McDougal , and his wife , Susan , in the Whitewater real_estate development in the Ozarks . Among the central questions now being investigated by special counsel Fiske is whether Madison ' s funds were used to help pay_off Clinton ' s campaign bills . He will also try to determine whether Madison deposits were diverted to other corporations owned by McDougal , including Whitewater . In 1989 , after Madison had failed at an estimated cost to taxpayers of between $ 47 million and $ 60 million and had been taken_over by federal regulators , the Rose firm represented the FDIC in a lawsuit against Madison ' s former accounting_firm , Frost &amp; Co . The lawsuit accused Frost of negligence for failing to detect fraud at Madison . But in 1985 , Mrs . Clinton and another Rose attorney relied_on a Frost audit report on Madison when they sought state approval for Madison ' s bid to sell stock . Webster Hubbell , then a Rose partner and now associate attorney_general , handled the Madison legal work for the FDIC in 1989 , at a time when his father-in-law and his brother-in-law were suing Madison , and thus the FDIC , in separate cases . The FDIC began its investigation of the Rose firm ' s potential conflicts_of_interest last December . The agency ' s report raised questions about whether Rose had disclosed to regulators the potential for conflicts . The FDIC cleared the firm in part because the FDIC ' s own conflict_of_interest regulations covering attorneys handling cleanup work were not in_effect at the time that Rose won the contract for the legal business . But Republicans charged that the FDIC report could not be trusted because the investigation was handled by the agency ' s legal department , which had hired the Little_Rock firm to do the legal work_at Madison . In another development at the hearing Thursday , Altman acknowledged that he had met privately with White_House officials three weeks ago to brief them on an aspect of the RTC ' s Whitewater investigation . He said the purpose of the meeting was to inform the White_House about the RTC ' s options in_view of the impending expiration of statutes of limitation on civil lawsuits involving Whitewater- and Madison Guaranty-related issues . Some Republicans raised the question of whether the meeting was improper , given his role as acting chairman of the RTC , which is supposed to be an independent regulatory_agency . &quot; It was solely to be sure that ( White_House counsel Bernard Nussbaum ) understood the legal and procedural framework , &quot; Altman told the committee . He said he felt a briefing was justified because he had been giving such information to inquiring members of Congress .</TEXT>
