   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE ; FOOT-DRAGGING ON SEISMIC SAFETY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the two weeks since the Northridge earthquake sent Orange County a wake-up call_on seismic safety , it has become increasingly clear just how fortunate the county was to escape with so little damage . A review of past warnings and of failures to take corrective action reveals a cavalier attitude among officials . Earthquakes in Southern California are so frequent there is no excuse for governments to be caught ill-prepared . Last week the state Seismic Safety Commission found that Orange County and the cities of Garden Grove , San Juan Capistrano and San Clemente missed a state deadline to come_up with plans to reduce the risk to unreinforced buildings . A 1986 state directive gave localities until 1990 to produce the plans . It did not require actual retrofitting , merely an inventory of old masonry buildings that had not been reinforced . It was up_to local_governments to decide how to reduce the risks . That does not sound like an onerous requirement , and , indeed , most municipalities met it . Orange County officials claimed they met it , too , or at least thought they did ; however , a closer look shows they missed the mark . The county has admitted that a 1989 letter to the state about seismic safety promised updates but that none ever were provided . In addition , the letter referred to a plan that never went before the Board of Supervisors and eventually was scrapped . One county official said that although there was concern over seismic safety , other demands received higher priority in years of tight budgets and cutbacks . Failure to act amounts to a form of Russian roulette , and if the chamber was empty two weeks ago , Orange County never can know when it might be loaded . After a 1989 county report showed 14 firehouses in the county at high risk in an earthquake , some sensible steps were taken_to remedy deficiencies . But much more must be done . The new state report speaks_of 72 buildings , 15 of them owned by the county , being at risk . Some are old fire_stations , others are restaurants or shops . A Garden Grove official said his city missed the state deadline because it wanted first to draw_up a plan for retrofitting that did not burden business owners unduly . that ' s a good idea . But taking eight years to come_up with a plan , and missing the deadline by more_than three years , is unacceptable . Many city and county officials contend that whatever dangers there might be are not life-threatening . But this attitude represents a kind of gambling , and the death toll of more_than 50 in the Northridge earthquake shows how high are the stakes .</TEXT>
