   <HEADLINE> 2 DIE IN CRASH OF CAR FLEEING BORDER_PATROL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two people died and 11 were injured in a crash Tuesday when a car packed with illegal immigrants and driven by a suspected smuggler ran a red_light while trying to elude the Border_Patrol near the U.S.-Mexico boundary , police said . The crash killed a woman and a boy who were among 11 suspected illegal immigrants riding in a two-door Ford Granada , four of them in the trunk , police said . The dead were not identified . Four of the injured remained hospitalized in critical condition at UC San Diego Medical_Center . The driver of the Ford , 40-year-old Bartolo Martinez Vargas of Tijuana , was trying to escape a Border_Patrol sedan that had just pulled_out of a side_road behind him , authorities said . The Border_Patrol agent suspected the heavily loaded car was involved in immigrant smuggling , but there was no pursuit before the collision , authorities said . &quot; The Border_Patrol was following and positioning themselves to run the license_plate , &quot; said Bill Robinson , a spokesman for the San Diego police . &quot; The driver saw the Border_Patrol vehicle behind him and apparently panicked. &quot; The Ford drove the wrong way around traffic stopped at the red_light and onto a four-lane highway , where it was struck by two cars going_about 50 m.p.h. , police said . The drivers of those two cars were among the injured . Martinez faces charges of manslaughter and is also being investigated by the Border_Patrol ' s anti-smuggling unit , authorities said . The crash occurred about 7:30 a.m. in an intersection a_few blocks north of the border in the Otay Mesa section of southeastern San Diego . Although the crash took_place during the second week of Operation Gatekeeper -- a crackdown in which the Border_Patrol has flooded the San Diego line with agents -- it fits the pattern of previous cases that involved reckless driving by smugglers in overloaded vehicles . In 1992 , six people died after a Border_Patrol chase in which a stolen van carrying a dozen illegal immigrants crashed in front of a high_school in Temecula .</TEXT>
