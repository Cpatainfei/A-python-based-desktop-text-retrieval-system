   <HEADLINE> FBI PAPERS SHOW NOLAN WAS AN INFORMANT IN 1980S ; ETHICS : INDICTED ASSEMBLYMAN SAID WILLIE BROWN WAS MANIPULATING THE SYSTEM . THE SPEAKER HAS DENIED ALL ALLEGATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Republican Assemblyman Pat Nolan , now under indictment on political corruption charges , acted_as an FBI informant in the mid-1980s , providing agents with allegations that Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown manipulated the system to raise campaign money , according to documents obtained by The Times . In six conversations in 1985 and 1986 , Nolan told FBI_agents how the Speaker -- who was his political rival -- could swing the outcome of an issue by influencing the actions of nine or 10 Assembly Democrats . Nolan described the legislators , at least half of whom are still in the Legislature or other elective offices , as having &quot; total disregard concerning the merits of ( a ) bill &quot; adding that &quot; their primary motivation is ' milking ' campaign contributions &quot; from lobbyists . At their initial meeting at his Glendale office in October , 1985 , Nolan , then the Assembly Republican leader , told the agents he was &quot; willing to fully cooperate with the FBI and testify at trial if necessary , &quot; according to 11 pages of confidential FBI notes of the conversations . The plan backfired for Nolan , who was then seeking to unseat Brown as Speaker . Nolan , 43 , is awaiting trial in March_on corruption charges . Brown , who remains Speaker , has never been charged with a crime in connection with the FBI probe . Brown , a San Francisco legislator , could not be reached for comment , but he told the San Francisco Chronicle : &quot; In my review of this document , there ' s clearly nothing true except the correct spelling of some of the names . Frankly , my reaction is I ' m just sorry_for Pat Nolan. &quot; Nolan declined to comment . But in a statement released Friday , Nolan ' s office said the veteran Glendale legislator ' s actions show he &quot; was one of the few people who as long ago as 1985 was trying to assist the government ' s inquiry into questionable practices in the state Legislature . Frankly , that ' s why the government ' s effort against him came as such a surprise. &quot; In April , a federal grand_jury indicted Nolan and Sen . Frank Hill ( R-Whittier ) on charges of using their public offices to solicit illegal payments . Nolan , charged with six counts of racketeering , extortion , conspiracy and money_laundering , is accused of soliciting a series of bribes from unidentified individuals seeking his support on bills before the Legislature . The indictments grew out of a sting operation in which FBI_agents posed as Southern businessmen seeking legislation to establish a shrimp processing plant in West Sacramento . The sting operation was already under way -- although it was not publicly known -- when Nolan began talking to the FBI . Both Nolan and Hill have pleaded not_guilty . In face-to-face meetings and on the telephone with agents , Nolan sketched a picture of legislators motivated by the need to raise large amounts of funds to win reelection and stay in power . Nolan told the FBI that Brown was the &quot; the hub of the wheel &quot; in state politics . He contended that Brown was &quot; particularly interested with legislation concerning gambling , liquor and exemptions from the Coastal Commission. &quot; He said that Brown would instruct certain lobbyists to &quot; solicit campaign contributions or a ' fee ' ( that would be ) directed to Brown ' s law firm. &quot; In one case , Brown essentially offered to &quot; split the fee &quot; with Nolan , who was seeking help for a constituent trying to build a pizza_parlor , according to the FBI notes . Nolan also described three Los Angeles-area state_senators , including former state Sen . Paul B . Carpenter ( D-Downey ) , as having reputations for being involved in &quot; bag bills &quot; and bartering their votes for political contributions . Last month , a federal jury in Sacramento convicted Carpenter on a variety of corruption charges , primarily based on testimony of former state Sen . Alan Robbins ( D-Van Nuys ) , who earlier was also convicted on corruption charges . Another senator would &quot; normally barter his vote &quot; on special_interest legislation , Nolan told the FBI , adding &quot; it was rumored &quot; that the legislator &quot; has a room full of gifts he received as a result of supporting ' bag bills. ' &quot; Nolan told investigators he had been contacted by then-Sen . Ed Davis ( R-Santa Clarita ) , a former Los Angeles police_chief , who told him &quot; he was frustrated and disgusted with the political process. &quot; Nolan said Davis told him &quot; if he had three of his bunco people up here , he would clean it up. &quot;</TEXT>
