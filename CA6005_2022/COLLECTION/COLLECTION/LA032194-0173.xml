   <HEADLINE> CITY ' S THIRST POSES THREAT TO WATERWAY ; ENVIRONMENT : THE VENTURA RIVER SERVES URBAN WATER NEEDS . BUT SIPHONING AFFECTS THE LIFE IT SUPPORTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About six miles up the Ventura River Valley and just west of California 33 sits Foster Park , a river-side refuge where lovers court and swallows dart through the air . Under a canopy of giant sycamores , eucalyptus and oaks , this 200 acres of nature offers something few other parks in Southern California can -- a river . But the Ventura River , with its brushy banks that give children a chance to trap a tadpole or listen to a symphony of chirping birds , also slakes a city ' s growing thirst . And Foster Park is where the city of Ventura taps the river ' s flow most heavily . Here , the city diverts water for up_to 20 # 000 families a year , slowing the river and leaving it shallower , thereby warming it and essentially altering the life it supports . The diversion can hardly be noticed from the park . An underground dam cuts 60 feet down to the river ' s bedrock and pipes water to the city ' s water treatment plant along upper Ventura Avenue . Four wells farther up the river siphon subsurface river water off to also be sent to the water treatment plant . &quot; It ' s our oldest and best water_supply , &quot; said Ronald J . Calkins , director of public works for the city of Ventura . The city has turned_to the river first to fill as much of its annual water needs as possible , he said . After the river , the city looks_to Lake Casitas , which also gets its water from the river and its tributaries . Lastly , Ventura goes_to its deep water wells in the city ' s east end . But now the city wants to increase its supply from the Ventura River . Although the city would have to prepare a complete environmental impact report before it could take more water , Calkins and other officials maintain they may have rights to claim all_the water in the river during dry months . And it ' s that claim -- despite city assurances that environmental repercussions would be considered -- that has state biologists concerned that the lower river may soon face one of its most serious threats yet . Based on a convoluted series of water_rights transfers over the last 120 years among the Santa Ana Water Co. ; Ventura Water , Light and Power Co. ; Southern California Edison and others , the city claims the right to 4 # 000 miners ' inches per year from the river . that ' s an antiquated term of measurement left over from the state ' s early mining days . It ' s the equivalent of about 54 # 000 acre-feet of water per year -- or enough water to totally supply 108 # 000 families . That is more_than five times what the city now takes from the river and much more_than the city needs , Calkins said . But he said the city may have a more far-reaching right to the water . The city believes that it has so-called pueblo water_rights granted more_than 200 years ago by Spain . And he believes that the city could prove that , if necessary , by examining historical_records in Spain . &quot; There is some question whether we have a pueblo right , which is the right to just about anything , &quot; Calkins said . &quot; But if we have it , it ' s great stuff . A pueblo right is the granddaddy of them all. &quot; A pueblo right , which California courts have already ruled can be claimed by the cities of Los Angeles and San Diego , dates_from the days of the missions and entitles the cities to all_the water they need from nearby rivers , including ground_water . Having a pueblo right -- which could still be contested in court -- would exempt the city from being forced to allow a minimum amount of water to flow down the river , as California Department of Fish and Game biologists have requested , Calkins said . Ventura ' s population of 96 # 000 uses 16 # 000 acre-feet of water annually , with up_to 10 # 000 acre-feet of that taken from the Ventura River . City-paid experts will soon begin studying the river to find_out how much more water it can give_up , and at what environmental cost , said Steve Wilson , the city ' s water superintendent . After that study , the city will write a master_plan to improve water works_at Foster Park by altering the underground dam ' s intake , building a permanent dike to funnel the water into the dam and refurbishing the four subsurface wells . The city ' s pipelines also need to be replaced . &quot; We don ' t know yet how much water is available , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; But we ' re trying to get the most we can of our water_rights with the most minimal impact on the environment. &quot; The city wants the extra water for two main reasons . Wilson would like to ship more water to the city ' s east end , which is now supplied by poor-quality ground_water from wells in east Ventura and Saticoy . In addition to improving drinking_water in the east , it would also allow the basins there to rest and refill . That would make more water available during times of drought . But more importantly , Calkins said , the city may be able to delay for several years the very expensive proposition of building a plant to desalinate seawater if it can enhance its present water_supply . The city proposes to spend $ 1.5 million to study , design and implement improvements to its water diversion facilities . That compares to estimates of $ 33 million to $ 55 million to build a desalination plant . &quot; Spending millions to use the resources we have really pays_off , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s a lot of money , but it ' s a lot cheaper than desal. &quot; Calkins said Fish and Game ' s request to leave water in the river for fish and wildlife may_not be valid . &quot; I ' m not sure they can make us do that , &quot; Calkins said . &quot; But we try to balance the needs of the river because the health of the river is important to us. &quot; Ken Wilson , a Fish and Game biologist and environmental specialist , said the issue is not how much water is taken when the river is swollen from rain , but how much passes_by when the water_level is low . &quot; They believe they can take all_the water they want to , &quot; Wilson said . Diverting too_much water will dry_up pools , heat_up the water and could wipe_out the endangered species that live_in the estuary along with what is left of the steelhead trout population . &quot; At some point , we have to say we ' re not going_to take any more water from these streams , &quot; Wilson said . If the lower stretch of the river below Foster Park is dried_up by diverting too_much water , what is left of the once plentiful steelhead run could disappear entirely from the Ventura River , said Fish and Game biologist Mauricio Cardenas . Steelhead , which once ran_up the river by the thousands , still exist in the river , possibly 100 to 200 of them . Cardenas said he wants to see that the population grows strong once again . Clad in cowboy_boots and jeans , Cardenas recently walked the river ' s banks , checking on algae bloom at the outfall of the Ojai Valley Sanitary District sewage treatment plant . One afternoon , as he hiked down a trail and through the brush behind the abandoned Petrochem refinery , he spooked a white egret and prompted it into graceful flight . Later , a startled great_blue_heron also took_flight . Back in his lumbering green pickup_truck labeled with the Fish and Game logo , Cardenas drove down Old Creek Road and stopped for an impromptu temperature check of the San Antonio Creek . He said he is concerned about the city ' s plan to take more water from the river and the effect that might have_on the once mighty steelhead population as well as other fish and wildlife downstream . &quot; It ' s scary , &quot; Cardenas said . &quot; Really scary. &quot; Other Perils Ahead Even if it retains enough water for fish and wildlife to live , the Ventura River faces other perils , now and in the years ahead . The river is protected from pollution at its headwaters by the forest , where few people live , farming is sparse , and golf_courses and industry do not exist . Most of the large sources of pollution along the river have been controlled in recent years under the federal Clean Water Act . Industry is no longer allowed to dump chemicals into the river . The oil_companies that line Ventura Avenue are highly regulated , although accidents -- like a 370 # 000-gallon spill of oil byproducts disclosed last week -- can always occur . Sewage treatment plants also must meet a strict standard for bacteria and water temperature before their treated water can be released into the river . In fact , the Ojai Valley Sanitary District now is under state order to upgrade the level of treated sewer_water it discharges . But a more insidious problem remains in the seemingly harmless gutters along the streets of the entire populated area of the Ventura River watershed . Mark Capelli , executive_director of the Friends of the Ventura River and a lecturer at UC Santa Barbara , said the storm drains are one of the most serious threats to the river and its health . &quot; A river is a creature of and a product of its watershed , &quot; Capelli said . &quot; that ' s one of the reasons rivers are so vulnerable. &quot; The gutters that empty into storm drains collect tire remnants , dog droppings , back yard pesticides and crankcase oil . Waste from the streets of Ojai , Meiners Oaks , Oak View , Casitas Springs and west Ventura empty untreated into the river . But a newly enforced measure of the Clean Water Act requires the cities and counties to write plans to get the pollutants out of storm drains . Those plans are years away from being translated into action in the communities . In the meantime , said Alex Sheydayi , manager of the Ventura County Flood_Control Department , public education is a must . &quot; People have to be educated not to back their cars up over the curb and open their crankcase into the catch basin , &quot; he said . In addition , Ventura County is working_on regulations to reduce the amount of runoff from construction and other industrial sites , where unused concrete or grease may be left_out to be knocked_over in an earthquake or flushed into the river during a storm . &quot; It will take time , &quot; said Sheydayi . &quot; It ' s taken us many years to get here_and_now it will take us many years to get_out of it. &quot; Meanwhile , still more people and businesses will move_into the Ventura River Valley and the Ojai Valley . The population in the area already tops an estimated 50 # 000 people . And the county ' s current plan for the unincorporated area alone calls_for another 2 # 188 homes and 5 # 560 residents by 2010 . Those residents will not only draw their drinking_water from the river or subsurface wells , they will add_to the problems of runoff by their numbers alone . Many will use fertilizers and pesticides to plant new lawns and kill weeds ; residues of those chemicals will eventually make their way into the river . And more industry is likely to eventually settle along Ventura Avenue , which parallels the river . A project proposed by Michael Towbes Development of Montecito had been in the works for five years . It would have created an industrial_park on 21 acres near the avenue at Canada Larga . The project was withdrawn earlier this year , due in part to the economy and the environmental report that would have been required , said county planner Pat Richards . But , Richards said , there will be other proposals . &quot; It is vacant land and someone is going_to come_along and develop it sometime , &quot; he said . &quot; The only way to change that is to change the zoning. &quot; With the area already surrounded by industry , it would be difficult to change the zoning , he said . And once the oil fields that line Ventura Avenue become unproductive , there will be pressure to convert that land to other industry as well , Richards said . In addition to runoff from industry , there is residue from sprayed crops that makes its way into the river . The pesticides used to keep fruit and vegetables disease- and bug-free can also harm or kill native plants and animals in and along the river , biologists said . And golf_courses , with their manicured lawns and velvety putting greens , are notorious for high pesticide use . There are already two golf_courses in the Ventura River watershed , the public course at Soule Park east of Ojai and the private course at the Ojai Valley Country_Club . Now , the Farmont Corp . proposes to build another golf_course on 203 acres of open land west of the Ventura River . Japanese media tycoon Kagehisa Toyama , owner of the Farmont property , plans to build a lavish retirement resort there , said Maurice Stans , head of the project for the corporation . In addition to an 18-hole course , driving range and clubhouse with restaurant that have already won approval , Toyama also wants to build a retirement home on an adjacent lot . &quot; He reveres golf as a religion , &quot; said Stans , a former Nixon Administration official now working in Los Angeles . &quot; He wants to build one of the best golf_courses in the world , within an hour of Los Angeles. &quot; But Cat Brown , a biologist with the U . S . Fish and Wildlife Service , sees golf_courses in another light . &quot; Golf_courses are a terrible waste of land , &quot; she said . In this case , &quot; it will convert something with a very high value habitat into a pesticide-laden playground for the wealthy. &quot; The course will attract deer , birds and other wildlife , which might come_to drink from the artificial_lakes . But the animals of the woods are not likely to be welcome visitors at the course , Brown said . &quot; They will be lucky if they are only scared_away , &quot; Brown said . &quot; More likely , they will be killed. &quot; But Richards pointed_out that the Ventura County Board of Supervisors placed restrictions on the company to protect the environment when it approved Farmont ' s plan . Farmont will be required to install a type of membrane beneath the course that would , in theory , catch the runoff from the greens and channel it back into the lakes on the course , Richards said . In addition , Farmont must stop using potable water and find a source of reclaimed water for the grounds within eight years . Proponents have argued that a golf_course maintains open space and is better than developing the area with housing . The current General Plan , however , allows only one house on every 20 acres for the area , Richards said . The Riverbed Homeless As the Ventura River winds its way from the Los Padres National Forest to the sea , it encounters one of the most complex political problems of all -- homeless people who live_in the riverbed . There , in dry areas of the river_bottom beneath the Main_Street Bridge , live about 100 people . They include the mentally_ill , the down and out and the desperate . Some have spacious if rudimentary living areas , accentuated with carpets , picnic tables and abandoned car benches . One dwelling has two bedrooms , protected from wind and rain by blue tarps lashed to wooden frames with duct tape . They live without benefit of plumbing for washing or personal needs . Soap from washed dishes and clothes goes_into the river or into the ground . Garbage is buried or discarded in piles , although some carry their trash out_to bins . And without bathrooms anywhere nearby , the ground often serves as a latrine . And all_of it -- the furniture , the trash , the human_waste -- becomes refuse that is washed_down the river and into the estuary when heavy rains create the kind of torrential flows the county saw during the last two winters . &quot; The presence of humans down there has a serious impact on the wildlife , &quot; said Lawrence E . Hunt , a biologist who walked through bushes one day only to surprise a group of homeless men who told him he was lucky he was not shot . &quot; Fish can become infected if there is a high level of bacteria , &quot; he said . &quot; And birds can become infected when they eat infected clams and snails and other filter-feeding organisms. &quot; The homeless interfere with the natural ecosystem in other ways as well , Hunt said . Some of the river-bottom inhabitants fish without a license or regard for fishing_season , he said . &quot; They spread nets across the water and catch the steelhead when they are going upstream to spawn , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s a bad situation. &quot; The city is now planning a major restoration of the lower river . The first phase relies mostly on volunteer efforts to remove the giant_reed , arundo_donax , which has invaded the river ' s entire length . The reeds suck_up water and oxygen , choking out native plants and clogging_up the river ' s flow during storms . But the city also wants to create a nature area , called the Seaside Wilderness Park , at the mouth of the river . The project -- a joint effort of the city , California Department of Parks and Recreation , and the California Coastal Conservancy -- envisions the wilderness area with interpretive signs and possibly wooden walkways to protect sensitive wildlife habitat and vegetation . Everett Millais , director of community development for the city , said the restoration can never be complete as long as there are people living_in the river_bottom . &quot; It ' s a real dichotomy , &quot; said Millais . &quot; We have a nature preserve at the river mouth , and up the river we have a substantial homeless population living_in substandard conditions . But it is an issue without an inexpensive or easy solution. &quot; There are not enough homeless shelters in the county to provide a place to live for those people , Millais said . And even if there were , he said it is unlikely that they would all leave . &quot; Some would welcome the opportunity for a place to live , &quot; he said . &quot; But others would not. &quot; A man who called himself Easy , who lives at the river_bottom , falls_into the latter category . &quot; How can they make us all leave ? &quot; he asked . &quot; Some are experienced jungle fighters . And everybody has a weapon. &quot; Herbie , the 27-year-old &quot; cellmate &quot; with whom Easy shares a lean-to , came_to the river_bottom recently after he got_out of jail . &quot; I ' ve got nowhere else to go , &quot; he said . &quot; But I would n ' t live_in a shelter . They ' re too disrespectful all_the time. &quot; Millais said the city at one time provided portable toilets and garbage bins in a city parking_lot near the bicycle trail at Main_Street . &quot; But that didn ' t begin to address the problem , &quot; Millais said . &quot; And ideally , we would like to get facilities ( elsewhere ) that would entice people to leave the river rather than making_it easier for them to stay. &quot; But the homeless are not the only people who affect the river_bottom , Hunt said . He has also found tracks from motorcycles near the estuary , and shells left by people shooting at rodents , quail or &quot; anything else that moves , &quot; Hunt said . All those problems must be addressed if the plan to restore the estuary and create a nature preserve is to be successful . But Hunt , Brown , Capelli and others who want to preserve the integrity of the river agree that the park must be planned in a way that allows people to see nature , without trampling all_over it . &quot; It ' s a balancing act , &quot; Hunt said . &quot; You ' re trying to preserve an area , but you don ' t want to keep people out. &quot; Capelli said exposing people to a little-known resource that is so close to them is the best way to convert people to the cause of protecting and preserving the river . &quot; Most people don ' t even see the river unless they drive_up Highway 33 , &quot; he said . &quot; And yet , here is this beautiful jewel of a river right in our own back yard. &quot; An Endangered Habitat MYRIAD THREATS TO PLANTS AND WILDLIFE The Ventura River and its tributaries provide an essential network or corridors for wildlife that roam the forest and the Ventura River Valley . The rivers and their wide channels offer animals the necessities of life -- water , foraging grounds and shelter along the banks . Voices &quot; There is some question whether we have a pueblo right ( to Ventura River water ) , which is the right to just about anything . But if we have it , it ' s great stuff . A pueblo right is the granddaddy of them all. &quot; -- Ronald J . Calkins , director of Public Works , city of Ventura on the city ' s water_rights . &quot; It ' s scary . Really scary. &quot; -- Mauricio Cardenas , biologist , California Department of Fish and Game , referring to plans by the City of Ventura to study how much more water can be taken from the Ventura River at Foster Park . Environmental Issues * The homeless : About 100 homeless people live_in the river_bottom beneath the Main_Street Bridge without benefit of trash_pickup or flushing_toilets . Their encampment , which adds waste and other pollution to the river , causes concern among public agencies working to develop a wilderness area downstream at the river mouth . * New houses : The new Ojai area portion of the county General Plan calls_for another 2 # 188 homes_in the area around Meiners Oaks , Mira Monte and Oak View by the year 2010 . That will add another 5 # 560 residents to the area . They will either take their water from Lake Casitas or from the ground_water basins of the Ventura River Valley or the Ojai Valley . * New development : Vacant lots along Ventura Avenue are zoned for commercial and industrial use and eventually will be developed . In addition , as the oil fields along Ventura Avenue become unproductive in years ahead , property_owners will want to convert that land to other industrial uses . Main_Street Bridge : The current bridge built_in 1932 and its predecessor made a favorite spot for fishing in the first_half of the century . Ventura County Fairgrounds : The fairgrounds , which filled_in wetlands and part of the river delta , was at one time a Chumash village with as_many as 400 inhabitants . Seaside Wilderness Park : The city of Ventura , California Department of Parks and Recreation and the California Coastal Conservancy are working together to create a wilderness area that would let people see nature up close . Wildlife Along The River Los Padres National Forest : The forest , which is a vast tract of undeveloped land , helps protect the river and its watershed . There are few houses or roads and no development to cause pollution . Arroyo_Willow ( Salix Lasiolepis ) : The Arroyo_willow grows along the length of the river . It is a common native tree with a thin trunk only a_few inches in diameter . Coyote ( Canis Latrans ) : Coyotes are nighttime wanderers along the river . Western Goldenrod ( Euthamia ocidentalis ) : The Western goldenrod is one of the native wildflowers found in the lower Ventura River . Foster Park : The park has a river running_through it , something few parks in Southern California can match . It is also the site of the city of Ventura ' s water intake , which could be refurbished to allow the city to increase its diversions from the river . Mule_Deer ( Odocolleus hemionus ) : Mule_deer graze along river and roam through the area , nibbling on riverside vegetation and bedding_down in the brush . Least Bell ' s Vireo ( Vireo bellii pusillus ) : Endangered least Bell ' s vireos returned to nest in the Ventura River for the first time in 85 years after Southern Pacific Milling Co . moved_out . The county ' s relatively small populations inhabit wetlands and riparian scrub . Steelhead Trout ( Salmo_gairdneri irideus ) : The steelhead , which is being considered for listing as an endangered species , was once abundant in the river , living_in the ocean most of its life and then swimming up the Ventura River and Matilija Creek to spawn . Up to 200 steelhead are thought to live between the San Antonio Creek confluence with the Ventura River and Foster Park . Beldings Savannah Sparrow ( Passerculus sandwichensis beldingi ) : The only songbird in salt marshes , the five-inch bird nests exclusively in pickleweed . Salt Marsh Baccharis ( Baccharis douglasil ) : The native salt marsh is found in the wetlands area of the estuary . Oil Spill : In January 1993 , 370 # 000 gallons of toxic oil byproducts that spilled into the ground and a nearby creek was pushed into the Ventura River by heavy rains . The Estuary : Fish and wildlife that live or forage at the river mouth include the endangered tidewater goby fish , as well as California brown pelicans , the snowy plover , the California least tern and ospreys . California Least Tern ( Sterna antillarum browni ) : Colonies breed along coastal dunes and feed_in nearby wetlands . Western Snowy Plover ( Charadrius hiaticula ) : These birds nest along the shoreline , marking and hiding their eggs with twigs and grass . California Brown Pelican ( Pelecanus occidentalis californicus ) : While the pelican breeds on the Channel Islands , it is commonly found along the county ' s coastline .
