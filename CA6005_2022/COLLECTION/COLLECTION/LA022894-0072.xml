   <HEADLINE> SEVENTH_HEAVEN IS GOLDEN FOR SWEDEN ; HOCKEY : FORSBERG ' S GOAL BRINGS A 3-2 VICTORY AFTER AN OVERTIME AND SIX SHOOTOUT ROUNDS AGAINST CANADA END IN A TIE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Paul Kariya skated around in tight circles , knowing he alone would determine whether Canada would win the Olympic gold medal Sunday . Three periods of hockey before 9 # 245 at Haakon Hall had left Canada and Sweden tied at 2 , and a 10-minute sudden-death overtime had failed to separate them . They were still tied after the first best-of-five shootout round and remained even after the sixth , when two of hockey ' s most promising young players took center stage . First , Peter Forsberg -- the seventh Swedish shooter -- stunned Canadian goaltender Corey Hirsch with a daring , pull-back shot that gave his team a 3-2 lead . Kariya had to get the puck past Tommy Salo for the game to continue , and he had already beaten Salo in the first shootout round . &quot; The first time I picked the top corner , and I felt the second time , if I came_back ( to the same spot ) , he would n ' t expect it , &quot; Kariya said . &quot; I had it . I just didn ' t get the puck up. &quot; Salo threw himself across the goal mouth , his legs scissor-kicking . When the puck bounced off his leg and out of the crease , Sweden had won its first hockey gold medal . &quot; Sitting in my room , just thinking_about it , I always imagined playing Sweden for the gold medal , &quot; said Kariya , selected fourth by the Mighty Ducks in last June ' s NHL draft . &quot; For some reason , it was always Sweden . I just wish it would have ended a different way. &quot; Both teams wished it had been decided in a different way . Neither liked the shootout , calling it a skill contest unrelated to a game like this . &quot; It ' s not fair , &quot; Swedish defenseman Tomas Jonsson said . &quot; They should have sudden_death until someone wins . I guess they have to settle it somehow . I was really happy when Peter scored . If he didn ' t score , I was supposed to go_out there , and I didn ' t want to go_out there. &quot; Said Naslund : &quot; The shootout is too_much a case of luck , but time was running_out on the Olympics , so they had to end the game. &quot; But the international career of Forsberg is only taking_off . Rebounding from a flat performance in Sweden ' s first few games , he led his team past Germany and Russia and into the finals . His performance Sunday was_better still . He initiated Sweden ' s first goal , a power-play slap shot by Jonsson at 6:10 of the first_period , and the tying goal , by Magnus Svensson from the blue line with 1:49 to play . Forsberg was chosen sixth in the 1991 NHL draft by the Philadelphia Flyers , who traded his rights to the Quebec Nordiques in the Eric Lindros deal . Although his play-making skills and speed made him a star at the 1993 World Junior Championships , he has been criticized for indifferent play . &quot; Sometimes he can disappear , &quot; Jonsson said . The four-year , $ 6.9-million contract he signed with Quebec intensified the pressure he carried here , but he thrived under it . &quot; Since Nancy Kerrigan didn ' t win the gold , they should make a movie in Hollywood with him instead , &quot; Naslund suggested . &quot; He was unbelievable. &quot; As the fourth player up in the first go-round of the shootout , Forsberg had beaten Hirsch with a close-in backhander to bring Sweden even at 2-2 . Petr Nedved and Kariya converted their chances before Svensson lifted a shot over Hirsch . Canada ' s Dwayne Norris and Naslund each missed , and then Salo stopped a shot by Canada ' s Greg Parks with his right pad . Forsberg succeeded , and Greg Johnson and Roger Hansson were each stopped to start another shootout round . Hirsch forced Svensson wide to the left and stopped him , giving Nedved a chance to win the gold . &quot; My hair was standing on end , &quot; Nedved said . &quot; I went_to deke and the puck just slid a little ahead of me and I couldn ' t stuff it right in. &quot; That brought_up Forsberg , who decided to try a move he had seen Kent Nilsson make_for Sweden against the U.S. in the 1989 World Championships . &quot; that ' s a legend goal in Sweden , &quot; Forsberg said . &quot; I saw it on TV , and I wanted to try it , but I didn ' t make_it right . &quot; The goalie was standing on one side so_much . I noticed that after the first penalty shot . So I thought_about doing this . I came a little bit wrong in the beginning , but it was a goal. &quot; He skated in almost too close to get_off a shot before he cut_to his left and shifted to his backhand . &quot; I had him all_the way , &quot; Hirsch said . &quot; He wasn ' t going_to beat me . But he made a questionable move . He kind of tight-turned . I think you ' re supposed to keep moving forward with the puck , and I ' m not sure he did . But it must have been legal , because they allowed it . . . &quot; They ' re such skilled , talented players , it ' s basically 50-50 when you get_into that kind of situation. &quot; Canadian Coach Tom Renney had no quarrel with the legality of Forsberg ' s shot , but he wished the game hadn ' t come_to that . Renney ' s team began the tournament seeded fourth , but won the silver with a 5-2-1 record . Canada hasn ' t won a hockey gold medal since 1952 , in Oslo . &quot; In my mind , being inches away from the gold medal constitutes a hell of an effort , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m extremely disappointed . I think our team deserves a gold medal , period. &quot; Said Swedish defenseman Roger Johansson , who played for the Calgary Flames last season : &quot; I feel sorry_for the Canadian guys . There should be more overtime ( instead of a shootout ) , but what can you do ? Those are the rules . We won by the rules . &quot; Hopefully , there will be another team that wins the gold medal for Sweden , but this is the first time ever , and this is very special . Right from the start this year , people were_on us , giving us criticism . This must be great for the coaches . Only the strong survive. &quot; The strongest survived the shootout Sunday . &quot; I ' m proud_of our effort . We had a great tournament , &quot; Kariya said . &quot; But this is a tough way to win or lose. &quot;</TEXT>
