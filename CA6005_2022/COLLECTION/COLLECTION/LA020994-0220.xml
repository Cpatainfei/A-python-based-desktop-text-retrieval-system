   <HEADLINE> LANCASTER BANS PAY-TO-ENTER PARTIES AFTER FATAL SHOOTING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the wake of a fatal shooting at a pay-to-enter party , the Lancaster City_Council agreed to outlaw such events in residential neighborhoods . A city ordinance unanimously approved by the council Monday calls_for a fine of up_to $ 500 or six months in jail or both for anyone charging admission to a party in a private home.The ordinance will take_effect March 7 . The ordinance follows the Dec . 18 shooting death of Rayshaun Love at a pay-to-enter house_party in Lancaster . Five days after the shooting , Love ' s half-brother , Eric Gunn , pleaded not_guilty to a murder_charge as well as_to two attempted murder_charges stemming from the incident . A preliminary hearing is scheduled Feb . 25 . Love ' s killing is not the first to occur at a pay-to-enter party in the Antelope Valley . Since 1990 , two other deaths and numerous injuries have occurred at the get-togethers . There are already regulations in place that would seem to apply to these events . Richard Collins , head of Lancaster ' s code enforcement division , said building and zoning codes already regulate the use of property and fire_codes impose limits on crowd size . He said any business use of a property in a residential_area requires city approval . There are also city business license requirements and the state_Department of Alcoholic_Beverage Control mandates that a license be obtained for any gathering that includes the sale of alcohol . &quot; The ordinance the City_Council adopted specifically addresses pay-to-enter situations , where the other ordinances regulate uses in_general for health and safety concerns , &quot; Collins said . Sheriff ' s Sgt . Bob Denham said Lancaster ' s new ordinance &quot; gives us another tool. &quot; The ordinance does not apply to charitable , political or religious gatherings where participants make a donation .</TEXT>
