   <TEXT> Earthquake experts and seismologists say that with $ 100 million they could wire Southern California into a comprehensive early warning and damage reporting system which could give precious seconds of warning of a major quake . The sensors could help emergency workers determine where damage was worst and help scientists better understand the forces that produce severe temblors . THE EARLY ALERT SYSTEM A network of seismographs could be installed along major known faults in Southern California and tied into a wireless emergency network . The network would automatically be triggered by the first rumbles of a major earthquake seconds before the ground shocks could reach Los Angeles . Seismologists and geologists say such a system could give between 20 seconds and 30 seconds of warning in the event of a San Andreas Fault earthquake -- long enough to automatically : * Shut down critical utility lines * Alert reservoir workers * Sound school alarms * Send high-rise elevators to open at the nearest floor * Trigger stop lights * Warn trains * Wave_off approaching aircraft . Reality check : Such a system already exists in Japan , where it has been in_use for more_than a decade to shut_down that country ' s high-speed bullet trains safely at the first sign of a major quake . Seismologists and geophysicists say it would take a decade to create an effective early_warning_system in California . HELP FROM SPACE Global positioning system links monitoring stations to satellites , allowing scientists to measure the movements of the Earth ' s crust over long distances with unprecedented precision . The GPS system gives them the opportunity to analyze the stresses and strains building_up along fault_lines in enough detail to better understand where major earthquakes might be imminent . Reality check : There are already 10 GPS stations in Southern California continuously monitoring crustal motion . Geologists say they need a minimum of 50 permanent ground receivers . INSTANT DAMAGE REPORTS Sensitive earthquake monitoring devices would measure the strength of the actual local ground motion from an earthquake . Tied together by radio telemetry , they would help emergency workers instantly pinpoint the areas of most severe damage while providing scientists the precise data they need to better diagnose the long-term vulnerability of specific neighborhoods to earthquake tremors . Engineers could use the data to strengthen local building_codes and zoning ordinances . Sensitive earthquake monitoring devices would be installed on every major : * Highway overpass * Hospital * Dam * Pipeline * Factory * High-rise building Reality check : Los Angeles already has 175 strong motion sensors , installed since 1972 by the Division of Mining and Geology . There are about 600 in the state . But many of the instruments are antiquated and geologists would need thousands more . EARLY ALERT SYSTEM SEQUENCE 1 . As a quake begins , low intensity waves travel out from the epicenter at about 4 miles a second . 2 . The earthquake ' s first wave triggers a seismic alarm_system placed along the fault . 3 . The fault seam continues to &quot; unzip &quot; as the quake ruptures the fault zone at about 2 miles a second and generates powerful but slower shock_waves . 4 . Alarm instantly transmits warning to computer at a central emergency center . 5 . Emergency computer_system automatically sounds area alarms and shuts down critical utility systems .
