   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : DON ' T BLAME GREENSPAN ; IT ' S THE GROWING SAVINGS DEFICIT , STUPID</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What on earth is so worrying the Federal_Reserve_Board and its chairman , Alan Greenspan , that they keep raising interest_rates , trying to slow a U.S. economy that is just getting healthy after years of recession -- and threatening a California economy that is still in the convalescent ward ? Savings , in a word , or lack of same . The real , underlying concern of Greenspan and the Fed is that the U.S. savings rate has fallen_back again after a brief rise . Forget all_the ballyhoo about baby_boomers saving for retirement . Americans are saving only 4 % of their disposable , after-tax incomes these days , and that ' s as low as the savings rate has gone since the 1930s . The truth is we ' re spending more ; consumer_credit card debt is going_up again . And the federal budget_deficit , having come_down to less than $ 200 billion , has stopped falling and may turn_up again as well -- if for no other reason than rising interest_rates ratchet up government borrowing costs . The deficit makes a difference because it soaks_up half of what limited private savings there are . In short , the specter of Americans living a rake ' s progress , consuming today and putting nothing away for a chilling tomorrow , looms again . And that has consequences . &quot; The reason interest_rates are going_up may be no mystery at all , &quot; says economist Barry Bosworth of the Brookings Institution in Washington . &quot; We have a capital shortage. &quot; Bosworth is saying publicly what Greenspan and the other Fed governors worry about privately : that the gigantic U.S. economy , which has now reached $ 7 trillion in annual output of goods and services , doesn ' t have sufficient resources to allow_for rapid creation of more goods and services , jobs and incomes . That is , if we tried to raise American living standards dramatically , we would quickly stretch our resources to the limit and develop bottlenecks that in turn would wastefully increase costs , resulting in higher inflation . &quot; If you want growth of 4 % or more per annum , you have to accept inflation of 3.5 % or more along with it , &quot; says John Wilson , chief economist of BankAmerica Corp . The alternatives for the Fed are to finance U.S. growth by borrowing overseas , as was done_in the 1980s , or to throttle the economy back to a_level of growth that can be sustained . Greenspan has chosen the throttle . The Fed has lifted short-term interest_rates three times since Feb . 4 . and seems prepared to lift them again in May , apparently with the aim of slowing the economy to a growth pace of 2.5 % a year . That level of growth would not stretch our resources or accelerate inflation , but neither would it do much to reduce 6.5 % unemployment or lift U.S. living standards dramatically . But that ' s why most Americans are mystified and frustrated . The economy went_through a long , draining recession . Practically everybody ' s job is insecure these days ; raises are history , incomes aren ' t rising . And yet at the first signs of pep and drive_in the economy , along comes a guy named Greenspan applying the brakes . * What ' s going_on ? Greenspan is facing facts : We aren ' t as rich as we used to be . In other times , savings were greater . In the 1950s -- and ' 60s and ' 70s -- Americans saved 6.7 % to 7.7 % of their annual incomes in bank_accounts and trust_funds , mutual_funds and insurance_policies . And much of that money went_to finance industry because the country didn ' t have a big government deficit , and middle-class Americans didn ' t have a lot of entitlements . But since 1981 , according to the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development , &quot; the United States has saved remarkably little of its national income. &quot; In the 1980s , Americans saved 4.5 % of their income on average , and now that has fallen to 4 % . Also , federal_deficits have ballooned thanks to a river of benefits , from Medicare to student loans to welfare payments , that Washington sends through society . Other countries save more . The average savings rate for 24 industrial countries , including all_of Europe , is 9 % ; Japan ' s savings rate , even in its current recession , is more_than 15 % . Japan created the modern model for savings . After World_War_II , its government spurred industry to create jobs and then urged people to deposit tax-exempt savings in post_office accounts , which the government then funneled to industry to create more jobs and so on . Today , Japanese postal accounts are no longer tax-exempt as the government tries -- however slowly -- to shift to a consumer economy . Still , savings remain high in Japan because the population is growing older and both government and people feel the need to save for old_age . &quot; Americans are also growing older , &quot; notes economist Bosworth , &quot; but curiously they are not saving more. &quot; * In the 1980s , the United States attracted foreign savings to its Treasury_bonds , and it could do so again today . But that would push_up the dollar ' s exchange_rate and undermine the hard-won competitiveness of U.S. companies . Furthermore , foreign savings may_not be there . Europe and Japan may use their savings to revive their own economies -- or to invest in building new markets in developing countries . The inescapable fact is that we need to change . The quickest way to restore national saving is to cut the budget_deficit . The White_House estimates the deficit will be $ 175 billion in the next fiscal_year , but it could come_in higher because rising interest_rates mean the Treasury will have to pay more on its bills and bonds . Also , private savings could be encouraged by tax exemptions , and the money could be funneled to support new industries and education so more U.S. workers could earn the growing incomes that led to higher savings in former times . Saving more and making_do with fewer entitlements won ' t be easy for Americans . But it will be more useful than blaming Greenspan and the Fed for facing facts .</TEXT>
