   <HEADLINE> WILSON HAILS EFFORTS OF LEGAL IMMIGRANTS ; POLITICS : IN A SPEECH BEFORE ASIAN AMERICAN GROUP , HE SAYS PROVIDING PUBLIC_SERVICES TO THOSE WHO BREAK THE LAW TO ENTER THE U.S. ' IS AN INSULT ' TO NEW CITIZENS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gov . Pete Wilson on Monday praised legal immigrants for their entrepreneurial spirit but continued to hammer away at illegal immigrants for costing the state billions of dollars in public_services . &quot; Little Saigon is an indication of the vitality and diversity that legal immigrants bring_to California , &quot; Wilson told a gathering of Asian American business_leaders at a restaurant here . &quot; We ' re fortunate for the kind of people who came here and enriched our lives. &quot; Repeating a campaign theme , Wilson said that providing services to illegal immigrants &quot; is an insult to those who followed the arduous process &quot; of becoming legal residents and U.S. citizens . &quot; It ' s wrong to train a blind eye to the problem of illegal immigration , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; It ' s a violation of U.S. laws that simply can not be tolerated. &quot; Wilson ' s call_for changes in immigration law and tougher laws against crime drew repeated applause and chants of &quot; four more years &quot; from the crowd of about 150 Asian American leaders and Wilson supporters . The event launched &quot; Team Wilson ' 94 , &quot; a coalition in the Asian-American community dedicated to Wilson ' s reelection campaign against Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown . The coalition includes representatives of Chinese , Vietnamese , Japanese , Korean , Filipino , Indian , Cambodian , Laotian , Thai , Afghan , Pakistani and Hmong organizations . Its members include lawyers , bankers , doctors , accountants and other professionals and some Buddhist monks . John D . Tsu , the coalition ' s state chairman , said that Wilson has made_it possible for more Asian Americans to receive public_services by signing into law legislation that ensures a more accurate census count . The law , signed_in September , provides separate counts for residents of Filipino , Chinese , Korean and Japanese descent instead of lumping them all together under the category of Asians or Pacific Islanders , Tsu said . Inder Singh , chairman of the National Federation of Indian-American Associations , said he supports cracking_down on illegal immigrants because they &quot; downgrade the status of legal immigrants. &quot; &quot; Every immigrant becomes a suspect , &quot; Singh said . Wilson also used the occasion to scold organizers of a rally Sunday that drew about 70 # 000 participants in Los Angeles against Proposition 187 , the measure on the Nov . 8 ballot that would deny illegal immigrants and their children public education , non-emergency medical_care and other services . Wilson , who supports Proposition 187 , said that opponents of the measure are trying to confuse people by using the &quot; false threat that everyone becomes an INS agent. &quot; If passed , the measure would require teachers to report students and their parents suspected of being illegal immigrants . Doctors , nurses and the police would also be required to report suspected illegal immigrants , opponents say . The ballot measure has widespread support , according to recent surveys , but opponents say the measure is mean-spirited , violates federal law and could cost California taxpayers billions of dollars .</TEXT>
