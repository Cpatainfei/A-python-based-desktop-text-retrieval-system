   <HEADLINE> INFRASTRUCTURE ; NEW PIPELINE A CONDUIT OF HOPE FOR CENTRAL ASIA ; FIVE FORMER SOVIET REPUBLICS ARE BANKING ON THE AS-YET-UNBUILT CHANNEL , ALONG WITH NEW RAILWAYS AND HIGHWAYS , TO BREAK FREE FROM MOSCOW ' S LONG DOMINATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was a bizarre ceremony in the middle of nowhere . Invited guests stood_in a circle_around two sections of pipe , five feet in diameter , that rested_on a bed of gravel in the desert . Black limousines rolled_up one by one , and out climbed the leaders of Pakistan , Iran , Turkey , Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan , each stepping_forward to dig_up a shovelful of dirt . Then welders fitted the two steel cylinders together . The rest of this would-be pipeline doesn ' t exist . But President Saparmurad A . Niyazov , in a move to drum_up financing , staged the symbolic inauguration for VIPs on_hand last month for his former Soviet republic ' s independence_day . When -- and if -- completed , the pipeline will take some of Turkmenistan ' s natural_gas through Iran and Turkey to customers in Europe , bypassing the existing line through Russia . It is one of a number of pipelines , highways and railroads planned with the aim of breaking Moscow ' s economic control over former subjects in landlocked , resource-rich Central Asia . &quot; I hope this pipeline will be the first of many pipelines , &quot; said Pakistani Prime_Minister Benazir Bhutto , whose country is among those seeking trade and influence in this region of 53 million people . Decades ago , the Soviet_Union closed its southern borders and isolated the five Central Asian republics -- Kazakhstan , Kyrgyzstan , Tajikistan , Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan -- from their historic Asian trading partners . Now the five are starting to grasp the advantages of rebuilding trade and transport links to the south , to lessen their dependence on those running north into Russia . Turkmenistan hopes to get rich quick by selling gas to Europe . But so does Russia . With Russian hands on the tap , Turkmenistan has little control over where its gas goes . Most of it has been consumed by former Soviet republics Ukraine , Armenia and Georgia , which now owe Turkmenistan $ 2 billion and are too poor to pay . Construction of the pipeline through Iran and Turkey is meant to start early next year . But diplomats say financing from the West could be hard to find because of opposition there to any project that might benefit Iran . Huge , oil-rich Kazakhstan has a similar problem , as its oil exports depend totally on Russian pipelines . Russia , an oil exporter itself , views Kazakhstan as a competitor and limits the flow of Kazakh oil . As a result , Kazakhstan has formed a consortium with the Persian_Gulf sultanate of Oman to build its own pipeline through Russian territory to the Black_Sea . Central Asians are also planning new transport lines for easier routes to the sea . New tracks under construction will join Turkmenistan ' s railway with the city of Mashhad in eastern Iran , giving Central Asia rail access to Iran ' s port of Bandar Abbas . At present , the nearest ports accessible to Central Asia by rail are in Russia -- St . Petersburg on the Baltic_Sea and Vladivostok on the Pacific , both thousands of miles away . Pakistan , which wants Central Asian trade to flow through its own port of Karachi , is also discussing a railroad through western Afghanistan -- a part of that country barely touched in recent years by the Afghan civil_war . The Afghan war has also delayed the opening of Pakistan ' s most direct route to Central Asia , through Kabul to Uzbekistan . But there is another obstacle : Uzbek President Islam A . Karimov , a cautious former Communist strongly suspicious of Islamic extremism , is wary about opening_up too quickly to the Islamic south . Other routes connecting Central Asia to Pakistan lead through western China , such_as the Karakoram Highway . From there , two roads lead to Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan . Pakistan has discussed upgrading these roads with cooperation from China , which is also interested in more trade with Central Asia . Like the isolated sections of pipe_in the Turkmen desert , many of these proposed links are still in the speculative stage . But officials in the region expect that at least some will be built , bringing an end to Central Asia ' s era of Moscow-engineered isolation .</TEXT>
