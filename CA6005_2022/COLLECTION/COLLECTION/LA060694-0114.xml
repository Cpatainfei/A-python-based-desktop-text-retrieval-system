   <HEADLINE> TEAMSTERS OK NEW TRUCKING PACT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Teamsters have approved a new national trucking contract by an 81 % margin , union officials said Sunday . The union reached tentative agreement with Trucking Management Inc. on April 28 , ending a three-week strike . It was presented for rank-and-file consideration without a formal recommendation from union leaders on whether it should be approved . The four-week mail balloting resulted in 67 # 784 votes being cast for the agreement and 15 # 729 against , the union said Sunday after counting the votes over the weekend . &quot; Our members have stopped the trucking_companies from shifting good full-time jobs to low-paid part-time jobs , &quot; said Teamsters President Ron Carey . &quot; This overwhelming vote shows that our members are proud_of what they ' ve won for themselves , their communities and for future generations. &quot; Arthur H . Bunte Jr. , president of the trucking_company association that negotiated the agreement on behalf of 22 member companies , said he was &quot; very pleased &quot; with ratification . &quot; With the new contract_in place , these carriers can now concentrate_on regaining pre-strike business and attracting new customers , &quot; Bunte said . &quot; By allowing the carriers to improve customer service , the new contract will help build a more secure future for the companies and their employees. &quot; Among the provisions in the new four-year agreement is a $ 3.20-per-hour increase in wages and benefits over the life of the contract . Teamsters now earn an average of $ 17 an hour .</TEXT>
