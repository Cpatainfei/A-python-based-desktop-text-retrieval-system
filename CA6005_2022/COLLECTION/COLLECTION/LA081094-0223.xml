   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : COUNTYWIDE ; WILSON GETS SUPPORT FOR STANCE ON CRIME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Continuing his &quot; tough on crime &quot; message that has become the centerpiece of his reelection campaign , Gov . Pete Wilson on Tuesday received support from local law_enforcement officers and crime survivors who also suggested that his anti-crime package could stand to get a little tougher . But while the governor was whipping_up public support for his anti-crime agenda , the Assembly Public Safety Committee was voting_down a part of the package that would make murder in a carjacking or drive-by_shooting a capital crime . The bill , already rejected earlier this year by the committee , can come_up again for reconsideration . As he spoke_to about two_dozen law_enforcement and crime victim advocates in Westminster , Wilson had not yet learned of the latest defeat of the bill and urged the local group to pressure the Assembly for a vote . He said some Assembly members have stated opposition to the bill because they are philosophically opposed to the death_penalty , but he argued that the committee_members &quot; should at least allow their colleagues the opportunity to cast a vote on the floor . . . . In effect , what you have now are 32 million Californians being held hostage by four ( committee ) votes. &quot; Wilson also heard several suggestions from the police_chiefs of Buena Park , Huntington Beach , Placentia and Westminster and Orange County Dist . Atty . Michael R . Capizzi on how to strengthen laws against violent criminals . They also requested $ 750 # 000 for the countywide expansion of a program founded in Westminster , which teams_up prosecutors , probation_officers and local police to go_after gang leaders . Roy Wagel , 29 , of Fountain Valley , who was left paralyzed after a carjacking three years ago , told the governor that the statute of limitations on attempted murder cases should be expanded . Even if his attacker were to be caught , the legal time_limit on prosecution has already run_out . &quot; I was kind of appalled that , based on my survival , the statute of limitations is three years , &quot; Wagel told the governor . &quot; There ' s no reason for ( a violent criminal ) to think_about the consequences. &quot; Karen Lott , 46 , of Lake Forest , who began a campaign against gang violence after a 1992 shooting injured her then-16-year-old son , also argued that those convicted of attempted murder should receive the same punishment doled_out to convicted murderers . Pointing to her son and Wagel , Lott said : &quot; Just because they survived a violent , violent shooting doesn ' t lessen the crime committed against them . . . . No one knows the way that it affects a family , no one knows the pain and suffering we go_through , no one understands it unless they walk in our shoes. &quot; Instead of Wilson ' s proposal to lower the legal_age that a juvenile can be tried as an adult from 16 to 14 , Lott said the law should apply to anyone over the age of 12 who commits a violent crime . Later , in response to reporters ' questions , Wilson said the federal crime bill awaiting final approval in Congress &quot; is all right. &quot; &quot; It ' s better than nothing , now that it is freed_of the absurd racial justice amendment , &quot; he said , referring to a provision that was deleted that would have allowed Death Row inmates to challenge their sentences by using statistical evidence to show racial bias in the system . Concerning a bill by state Assemblyman Mickey Conroy ( R-Orange ) , which calls_for up_to 10 strikes of a wooden paddle for convicted juvenile graffiti vandals , Wilson downplayed the proposed punishment in the bill . &quot; What ' s more important than the corporal_punishment aspect of the thing is public humiliation of some kind , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; I also think . . . ( parents ) should be made to pay restitution for whatever is required to cure the defacement of the property , whether it ' s public or private property. &quot; GEBE MARTINEZ</TEXT>
