   <HEADLINE> SOCCER / GRAHAME L . JONES ; STAR GULLIT QUITS DUTCH WORLD CUP TEAM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ruud Gullit , the dreadlocked Dutch star who is one of international soccer ' s most recognizable and charismatic figures , has allowed his ego to ruin his reputation and , possibly , the World Cup hopes of the_Netherlands . On Monday , three weeks before Holland ' s first World Cup match , Gullit quit the team . The reason , albeit unspoken , was Gullit ' s continuing feud with Dick Advocaat , the Dutch coach . That squabble appeared to have been patched_up last week when Gullit ended a 13-month self-imposed exile from the Dutch team and agreed to play against Scotland . The Netherlands won , 3-1 , but Gullit , 31 , was taken_off at halftime and later criticized the team ' s style of play and its tactics , something he had done before . Little more_than a year ago , after being substituted for in a World Cup qualifying game against England , Gullit quit the Dutch team in a huff , saying he would never again play for Advocaat . But with the World Cup around the corner , Gullit , the European and world player of the year in 1987 , relented and Holland ' s already good chance of winning the tournament improved considerably . So why did Advocaat take Gullit off at halftime against Scotland ? Did he do so intentionally to test Gullit ' s willingness to bow to his discipline ? The answer might never be known . The effect , though , was clear . &quot; He has hurt us by leaving this way , &quot; said Ronald Koeman , the Dutch captain . &quot; It ' s a slap in the face . The players were amazed. &quot; Holland might still win the World Cup , but the absence of Gullit will make_for a less exciting team and a less interesting tournament . And if the Dutch fail , it will be Gullit , not Advocaat , who will be blamed . * Germany ' s surprise loss to Ireland on Sunday in Hanover has not been met with wild hysteria in either country . The defending world champions are not about to panic and the_Irish are , well , the_Irish . &quot; We wanted to leave Germany on a positive note , but the_Irish showed how you can be successful with basic tactics , &quot; said German Coach Berti Vogts , taking a not-so-subtle dig at Ireland ' s unsophisticated kick-and-run style . &quot; It was not a good match . I expected the midfield to be better and to create more chances . But I ' m happy that the defeat came today rather than on June 17 ( when Germany opens the World Cup against Bolivia at Soldier Field in Chicago ) . &quot; Ireland ' s coach , Jack Charlton , was equally calm about his team ' s 2-0 victory , one that followed similar successes against the_Netherlands and Bolivia : &quot; We ' ve enjoyed the win , but we won ' t make too_much of it . It was a friendly and the game is 10 yards quicker when you get_down to the real business. &quot; But at least six other coaches will have taken_note of the result . Germany ' s first-round opponents , Bolivia , South_Korea and Spain , will have taken_heart that the Germans can , indeed , be beaten . Meanwhile , Italy , Mexico and Norway , Ireland ' s opponents in the opening stage of the tournament , will be thinking_twice about taking the_Irish for granted . * That pathetic squabble about fences at three of the World Cup stadiums has taken a ludicrous turn . Today , FIFA President Joao Havelange and General Secretary Joseph ( Sepp ) Blatter , along with Alan Rothenberg , the chairman and chief_executive_officer of World Cup USA 1994 , will make a courtesy visit to the White_House for a meeting with President Clinton . According to reports , they will ask Clinton to intervene in the dispute that has pitted World Cup organizers against police and security officials in Washington , Dallas and Palo Alto . All three cities insist on erecting fences -- around the fields at RFK Stadium , the Cotton Bowl and Stanford Stadium -- as a means of keeping fans from &quot; invading the field. &quot; Police in the three cities apparently regard all soccer fans as potential hooligans . FIFA , on the other hand , wants this World Cup to be an example to the rest of the world that soccer can be played in peace if fans are_well treated and not , to quote Blatter , &quot; put_in cages. &quot; The bottom_line is that this matter , like so many others , should have been dealt with and resolved by U.S. World Cup organizers before the cities were awarded the games . But World Cup organizers dropped the ball . Or couldn ' t find it . Or lost_it . Given the multitude of other mistakes they have made_over the past few years , this is hardly surprising . * Among the plethora of soccer magazines in the world , the one that stands_out head and shoulders above the rest is Italy ' s Guerin Sportivo . Featuring more_than 120 pages each week and covering the sport on a global basis , the magazine is one of the most widely read and respected in the world . Guerin Sportivo ' s articles and polls , therefore , are taken more seriously than most as an accurate indicator of trends in the game . The latest poll will be particularly well received in Rio de Janeiro . According to the magazine , Brazil is the overwhelming favorite to win the World Cup . No fewer than 52 of 100 sportswriters surveyed chose the Brazilians as winners , 27 chose Italy and 11 selected Germany . The rest of the votes were split among several countries . * After losses against France and Germany , Italy managed to get_back on a winning track when it defeated Finland , 2-0 , in Rome on goals by Giuseppe Signori and his Lazio teammate Pierluigi Casiraghi . The Italians were never likely to be troubled by the Finns , who have not beaten them in 82 years . Look_for Signori to have an impact in the World Cup . He has been the top goal scorer in the Italian League each of the past two seasons . * Gullit isn ' t coming_to America , but Roger Milla is . Milla , the star of Cameroon ' s surprisingly successful 1990 team in Italy , was included Monday on Cameroon ' s World Cup ' 94 squad . At 42 , he will easily be the oldest player in the tournament . He scored four goals in Italia ' 90 to lead the Indomitable Lions into the quarterfinals . * FIFA will add 14 national federations to its ranks at its congress in Chicago in June . The additions will bring FIFA ' s membership to 191 nations . The 14 newcomers include seven former Soviet republics -- Azerbaijan , Kazakhstan , Kyrgystan , Moldova , Tajikistan , Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan -- as well as Djibouti , Dominica , the Cook Islands , Tonga and the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia . The Czech Republic and Slovakia , formerly a single member as Czechoslovakia , will be granted separate affiliations to FIFA . * Colombia ' s World Cup defense will need to be better than its World Cup security . The team lost $ 30 # 000 worth of its World Cup uniforms while in transit through Cali . Some of the equipment allegedly already has begun showing_up on the shelves in local stores . Soccer Notes Portuguese international midfielder Rui Barros , 28 , has left Olympique Marseille in France and signed a four-year contract with his former club , FC Porto in Portugal . . . . Dutch defender Marciano Vink , who was traded from Ajax Amsterdam to Genoa for $ 2.7 million last year , is negotiating a return to Holland , where he will play for PSV Eindhoven . . . .
