   <HEADLINE> IS MOSCOW STILL A GOOD BET ? ; DUMA THROWS RUSSIAN CONSTITUTION IN YELTSIN ' S FACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Boris N . Yeltsin has appealed_to Russia ' s lawmakers for a new spirit of cooperation in addressing the great and growing problems facing their country . But from the looks of things he ' s more likely in_for a period of bitter confrontation instead . The new popularly elected Duma , as the lower house of Parliament is known , seems ready to pick_up where its predecessor , which was dissolved by Yeltsin last fall , left_off . Shaping_up is a renewed struggle over power and a time of deepening political conflict , one whose outcome is anything but certain . President Clinton ' s necessary effort to maintain stable relations with Russia and keep_open the lines to its reformers -- a policy already greatly complicated by the disclosure that Russia had a paid spy within the ranks of the CIA -- will inevitably be made harder by the political turbulence brewing in Moscow . In the long course of things , Russia ' s internal political developments seem sure to have a much greater impact on U.S.-Russia relations than the Aldrich Ames spy case . Yelstin ' s plaintive plea for cooperation followed by just a day the Duma ' s lopsided vote to grant amnesty to some of the most conspicuous enemies of the president , and of reform . With extremists taking the lead but with support from some centrist politicians as well , the Duma ordered freedom for the dozen men who are standing trial for attempting to overthrow President Mikhail S . Gorbachev in August , 1991 , and for those who led the rebellion that tried to oust Yeltsin last October . Among the latter are former Vice_President Alexander Rutskoi and former Parliament Chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov . The Duma vote , perfectly legal under the new Yeltsin-supported constitution , was explained by one centrist deputy as an effort to leave the past behind . In fact , it simply assures that the worst of the recent past will gain new influence over the present . Restoring the political rights of putschists even while former communists and neo-fascists ride high in the Parliament is a sure prescription not for reconciliation but for disorder . Yeltsin ' s government may try to fight or delay the amnesty . That action itself could trigger an early political crisis , perhaps forcing Clinton ' s Russian policy back to the drawing board .</TEXT>
