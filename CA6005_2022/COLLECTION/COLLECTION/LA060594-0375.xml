   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : CHINA IN ITS CHRYSALIS REQUIRES A DEFT TOUCH BY U.S.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What is really going_on in China ? Hundreds of people are sleeping at railway_stations in the rural_areas , waiting days for the chance to buy a ticket so they can go_to Beijing , Shanghai and other cities to find construction work . Estimates put the number of people on_the_move in China at over 100 million . The trains are slow , but they are the mode of travel in China because roads are poor and there is little motor transport . There is insufficient electricity , so factories often shut_down a day or more per week . that ' s why China is determined to build more_than 50 power_plants in the next five years . It has just arranged $ 120 million in financing for a power project from a syndicate led by J.P. Morgan &amp; Co . and from Nippon Life_Insurance . The boom in China ' s economy is real because it ' s based in part on more_than a decade of surpluses in agriculture , which began in the late 1970s when Beijing ' s Communist government first allowed farmers to earn their own money and decide their own crops . Now it is moving_into the industrial stage , hence rural people leaving the land for big cities in all parts of the country . In Chengdu in Sichuan -- the central China province that U.S. restaurants call Szechuan and whose 110 million people make_it larger than most countries -- construction cranes are busy day and night and workers can earn the equivalent of $ 20 a month . But growth of almost 14 % a year is too fast , and inflation in the cities has been hitting 40 % -- imposing a hardship even on college-educated elites who earn $ 100 a month , more if they work for foreign companies . Corruption is rampant as politicians line their pockets . And robberies and labor unrest are_on the rise , so the government has been trying to slow development to a more manageable pace . Such chaos is normal for a developing nation , but China is no ordinary country . Its population alone -- 1.2 billion -- gives it great potential . Poor as it is today , China has an economy the size of Canada ' s . And if China could lift its economic output per person -- now under $ 500 a year -- to that of South_Korea -- roughly $ 7 # 000 -- the total Chinese economy would be greater than that of the United States . Add_to that China ' s military power and its role as cultural and political_leader of Asia and you can understand why President Clinton , tacitly acknowledging his own mistake , recently renewed most-favored-nation trading status for China . He was attacked for &quot; putting profit before principle &quot; in not cutting China off as punishment for government persecution of political_dissidents . But that ' s nice rhetoric and faulty logic . To begin with , the idea of using trade as a weapon is flawed strategy . If China doesn ' t comply with U.S. demands , who is penalized ? Cutting China ' s $ 31 billion in exports to the United States , mostly of shoes and apparel , would only make the country more economically dependent_on Japan while hurting American businesses competing for China ' s market . More important , it would sharply reduce U.S. influence in emerging Asia , destined to become the wealthiest region on Earth . How far Asia has come can be gauged from the fact that 80 % of the investments in China today are not from Japan or the United States but from business people in Taiwan , Hong Kong and Singapore , three city-states that now have a combined capital surplus of more_than $ 100 billion . Meanwhile , entrepreneurs inside China are busily investing in Hong Kong or sending money for safekeeping to the United States . Politics aside , commercial ties are growing between the United States and China , most prominently in the work U.S. companies are doing . Caterpillar Inc. has joint_ventures to build diesel_engines and hydraulic excavators in China . Boeing may be about to get a $ 5-billion order for planes to upgrade China ' s air fleet . AT &amp; T is installing phone_systems and upgrading China ' s air traffic_control systems . Raytheon and Foster Wheeler are supplying boilers and servicing power_plants . The list goes_on . Yes , but so do arrests by China ' s government . Has America no choice but to trade with the_devil ? The answer is that America has many choices , as the Clinton_Administration would realize if it developed a real foreign_policy . In different circumstances in the past , the United States has kept its principles and done what works . Thus it sold wheat to the Soviet_Union but kept guns drawn ; in South_Africa , U.S. sanctions cut_off international bank credit . And in China , a U.S. tactic is working that in fact may represent a shrewd policy . U.S. thinking is to let the world market flood the country with capital , reckoning that economic_growth and modern technology loosen the control of totalitarian government . Growth is forcing change . Five years after China ' s army mowed_down student demonstrators in Tian An Men Square , the focus of dissent is now economic . Workers and farmers are protesting conditions and arbitrary rules , organizing into unions and cooperatives under the leadership of reformers such_as Wei Jingsheng , now the most prominent jailed dissident . Reports in Washington say such organizations are receiving quiet help from U.S. intelligence agencies , as did the Solidarity union in Poland over a decade ago . In any case , quiet pressure is the way to go . Trying to push China around won ' t work , nor will it gain the support of Asian allies who don ' t welcome foreigners telling them what to do . &quot; The strongest impulse driving Asia today is to erase the humiliation by foreign powers in the 19th Century , &quot; says China scholar Chalmers Johnson of UC San Diego . That doesn ' t mean antagonism to the United States . It means Asian_countries following their own course and expecting the United States to devise post-Cold War policies to deal with them . China and Asia represent challenge as well as opportunity . The China that is emerging is an energetic place . &quot; They do their homework and learn quickly , &quot; says Teddy Huang , AT &amp; T ' s director of Far East switching systems , of Chinese personnel installing modern phone_systems . Another U.S. businessman , who prefers to speak anonymously , compares joint_venture partners in three countries : &quot; In Russia and India , top people were eager but the managers and workers most directly affected didn ' t really listen . In China , everybody listened. &quot; &quot; I ' ll tell you what America has to do to respond to China today , &quot; says a U.S. chief_executive who is building power_plants in Asia . &quot; It has to educate its own children , so we won ' t be left behind. &quot;</TEXT>
