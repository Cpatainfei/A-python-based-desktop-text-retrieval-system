   <HEADLINE> TEACHERS BEGIN VOTING ON 8 % PAY RESTORATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For new teachers in the Los Angeles Unified School District , an 8 % pay raise sounds generous . For veteran teachers , who suffered a stinging 10 % pay_cut two years ago , the offer is adequate at best . Against that backdrop , teachers throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District began voting Tuesday on whether to accept an 8 % pay restoration or to strike next week . Union leaders have recommended that teachers accept the contract offer , crafted by a state mediator during three days of negotiations last month . &quot; No one is walking_around in a state of elation -- everyone is still very angry because of the pay_cuts , &quot; said Marty Baer , the teachers union_representative at Ranchito Avenue Elementary in Panorama City . &quot; But I don ' t think we ' d win a strike . It would not be the tactical thing to do. &quot; Feelings are similar throughout the district . Many teachers who took the 10 % pay_cut say they believe the district could afford to restore the full amount but that the current offer is the best they could get . &quot; Do teachers feel we ' ve won ? &quot; said Jeanne Spira , the union_representative at Carson High_School . &quot; No , but we ' ve made some progress. &quot; The 28 # 000 members of United Teachers-Los Angeles will continue voting today , and results will be made public Thursday evening . UTLA leaders said they believe the contract will be approved by a substantial margin . &quot; The ( union ) Board of Directors has recommended that they accept it because it ' s the best possible offer we could get , &quot; said John Perez , a UTLA vice_president . &quot; That doesn ' t mean that I like it or that I think it ' s fair and just. &quot; In meetings before most schools opened , UTLA President Helen Bernstein warned teachers that they had better be prepared to walk_out and stay out if they vote to reject the offer . &quot; It is a very difficult strike to win , &quot; Bernstein said . &quot; We might as well get everything we can without going_on strike and losing money. &quot; While a 1989 teachers strike resulted in 8 % raises each year for three years , Bernstein said she believes times have changed . &quot; A strike is not always the answer , &quot; Bernstein said . &quot; But the best way to avoid a strike is to prepare_for one. &quot; The union set_up a &quot; war room &quot; where teachers from all parts of the city began strike preparations . In meetings attended by about 840 teachers last weekend , union officials said they discussed the possibility of a massive walkout next week if teachers reject the offer . If the offer is accepted , however , Bernstein said teachers should be prepared to begin contract talks again -- soon . &quot; Don ' t think I won ' t be back here telling you to get ready for a strike -- I will , &quot; she told teachers . For the 5 # 181 teachers whose salaries were not affected by the pay_cut , the contract offer represents a significant boost in their wages . These teachers , along with others who have worked for the district less than a decade , also receive salary step advances and pay increases for advanced education units . &quot; This is very pleasant for the new teachers -- they ' ve never experienced having anything taken_away from them , &quot; said Cliff Harris , the union_representative at Maclay Middle_School in Pacoima . &quot; But for the teachers who have been here a long_time , they ' re still working in the hole. &quot; Dick Crowell , the union leader at San Fernando High , said he voted to strike because he believes the money is available in the school district ' s $ 4.5-billion budget to repay teachers the full amount . &quot; I think a strike would let the community , the district and everyone know that teachers are very , very discouraged , &quot; Crowell said . &quot; I think most teachers -- me included -- have just had it . We ' re just tired_of being last in priority. &quot; But district officials and Board_of_Education members say they could not afford to reimburse teachers the full 10 % cut from their salaries . &quot; I think . . . this is the best proposal possible under the circumstances , &quot; said Mark Slavkin , the Board_of_Education president . &quot; I ' m hopeful teachers will accept it. &quot; Supt . Sid Thompson agreed . &quot; We are committed to restore fully the salary reductions made two years ago , and the 8 % restoration represents a significant step_in that direction , &quot; Thompson said . Slavkin said he believes the district and the union scrutinized the district ' s finances and both sides agreed that the current offer is the highest possible . But Slavkin acknowledged that some teachers still believe more money is available . &quot; Historically , the district has not had the highest credibility , &quot; he said . The offer , good for one year , was crafted by a state mediator after three weeks of labor talks failed to produce a settlement . The district ' s first offer , presented to teachers nearly a month ago , called_for a 7 % increase -- 3 % this year and 4 % that would carry_over to next year . But union leaders , who hired an accounting_firm to comb through the district ' s books , rejected that proposal . They said it would be a guaranteed strike and that the district was holding_back money and promises of repayment . While the majority of teachers probably will accept the offer , they certainly aren ' t pleased with it . And some said they simply couldn ' t afford to strike . &quot; The feeling is , ' Let ' s get_on_with it , ' &quot; said Harris of Maclay Middle_School . &quot; we ' ll probably be at this again in another few months. &quot;</TEXT>
