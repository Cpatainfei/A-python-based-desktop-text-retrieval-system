   <HEADLINE> FRUSTRATIONS MOUNT AS PLO LEADERSHIP BEGINS PAYING THE PRICE FOR AUTONOMY ; MIDEAST : LACK OF CASH PROVOKES ANGER , INFIGHTING AMONG SOME OFFICIALS . ARAFAT REMAINS THE ONLY REAL DECISION_MAKER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To understand some of the seeds of the looming crisis in Palestinian lands , one need go no farther than a_few sunny villas in this North African seaside city that is the headquarters of the Palestine Liberation Organization . In the suburb of Menzah , a new office for the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction is being installed behind the PLO political department . New chairs and desks are being hauled in , and the head of the political department , Farouk Kaddoumi , is insisting on signing every check , every contract . Across town , in the suburb of Mutuelleville , the general_manager of PECDAR , Ahmed Suleiman Khoury , who is also the PLO ' s new economy minister , sits in the main_office of the PLO economic department . No checks or contracts here : Khoury , feuding with the political department , has not had anything to do with PECDAR -- which he created -- in two months . Down the street , PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat is meeting with a delegation of U.S. senators . Looking pale and tired , Arafat angrily proclaims that he is not going_home to Palestine if he does not start getting some money from the international community . Threatened with a cash crisis that has left officials urgently begging the world for donations to keep the new autonomous areas afloat , PLO headquarters slips alternately into gloom , infighting , euphoria and desperation as Arafat prepares to launch his historic trip to Jericho and as the PLO , in exile for a generation , careens toward its rendezvous with destiny in the West_Bank . The surrealistic landscape was perhaps best illustrated in the office of one of Arafat ' s top advisers , who exploded in irritation recently when shown a newspaper_headline about a Palestinian civil_servant in Jericho , so far unpaid , who said he was eating by gathering bananas . &quot; So what ? &quot; he boomed . &quot; There are 350 kinds of bananas in Jericho . If you go_to Indonesia , it is the main food of the population . So why is it strange if a Palestinian eats bananas ? &quot; To believe that there is a hint of the let-them-eat-bananas motif to all_of this -- many Palestinians in the occupied territories , frustrated at Tunis ' slowness in getting the new administration working , are sure of it -- is to miss the air of mounting rage here among PLO officials . Many believe that they made the dance-with-the-devil step toward peace with Israel , only to be left twisting in the wind when it came time to pay_for it . &quot; Nobody will pay . What can we do ? Sit here and cry ? &quot; a frustrated Khoury , popularly known as Abu Alaa , asked_in his office recently . &quot; A Palestinian policeman who is in Gaza , and his family in Jordan , how will he continue to serve the interests of the people while he is not sure his family will be able to have their dinner ? &quot; Khoury asked . &quot; I wonder . I ' m afraid . If this situation continues . . . it will be a catastrophe. &quot; International donors at a meeting Friday in Paris pledged $ 42 million in start-up costs for Palestinian self-rule , an amount the World_Bank said will keep the new Palestinian Authority afloat at least through August . But it was only a little more_than half what the PLO had sought . Donors have channeled much of their early aid toward specific projects and have held_back on flexible cash aid in the face of questions over PECDAR ' s accountability . With the PLO ' s history of corruption , Arafat ' s iron grip at the helm of PECDAR has worried some . So has the feuding between Abu Alaa and Kaddoumi , who is the deputy chairman of PECDAR but who has no connections to the economic department or credentials as an economist . Critics say it is a conflict_of_interest to have a political official signing checks and overseeing the authority at_the_same_time . And coordinating financial_institutions have been slow to get_off_the_ground . &quot; I ' ve been nominated as minister of economy and commerce . For this portfolio , I don ' t know how to run it , &quot; Khoury complained . &quot; I should employ some expert people . I should rent an office place in the occupied territories . But from where ? I don ' t know how . There is no money . I look_to the sky , and nothing comes from it . &quot; Even more , I don ' t know what will be the relationship between the Palestinian Authority and the PECDAR . I can ' t imagine that we will have an economic department and a PECDAR and a finance department too ? There will be three administrations , and there is danger in such a situation. &quot; Companies seeking contracts with the new Palestinian administration have been bypassing the PECDAR office in the occupied territories in droves and doing what they have always done : flocking to the Tunisian capital to meet with Arafat , who remains the only real decision_maker . Access to Arafat has become a growth_industry . Faced with a growing number of Palestinians demanding &quot; commissions &quot; for winning contracts with the new Palestinian Authority , Arafat finally cracked_down last month , ordering the arrest of his wife ' s uncle , London businessman George Hawa , and his associate , Moiad Sabah . PLO officials say Hawa , who was released a_few days later , would sit in the lobby of the Hilton Hotel in Tunis and promise contract approvals from Arafat for a 5 % cut . &quot; He had a big mouth , and he had no power to back it up , &quot; one senior PLO official scoffed . &quot; The only power he had was he was Suha ' s ( Arafat ' s wife ) uncle . And that is nothing. &quot; For the West , wondering what this episode means about the PLO ' s determination to keep its finances clean , there are two possibilities . &quot; It has brought the smell of corruption rather close to Arafat himself , &quot; one European envoy said . &quot; But it also means someone is trying to crack_down on it. &quot; &quot; If Arafat didn ' t know , it ' s a disaster , &quot; one PLO official said of Hawa ' s alleged activities . &quot; If he did know , it ' s a typhoon. &quot; The fiscal uncertainty of the last few weeks has spelled a cash crisis in Gaza and Jericho . Before Friday ' s donor meeting , Khoury said the PLO had no idea where it would get the $ 6 million it needs for next month ' s police payroll and $ 7 million for the civil administration . Khoury has insisted that the international community owes the fledgling Palestinian government a commitment for a full year ' s budget . &quot; We cannot wait like other states . We are facing severe problems . It ' s a problem of whether there will be peace or not , &quot; he said . In his meeting earlier this month with a U.S. Senate delegation headed by Sen . Paul Simon ( D-Ill. ) , Arafat threatened to cancel his return to Jericho unless the cash started flowing . &quot; He said , ' I won ' t participate in a puppet_show , ' &quot; recounted one of those at the meeting . &quot; He was upset , but sort of more in sorrow than in anger . He was depressed. &quot; Privately , PLO officials say they have growing fears that the donor shortfall is an attempt on the part of the international community to control the PLO -- to trickle out the money , month by month , &quot; as a point of pressure on the Palestinian Authority , to make_sure we do what they want , &quot; one official said . But with the recent hiring of an outside audit firm and the passage of a new set of bylaws for PECDAR , at least assuring minimum accountability , the United States has begun urging donors to turn_on the financial tap . Friday ' s meeting was an indication that the taps , though slow , may finally be opening_up . After the meeting , Palestinian chief delegate Nabil Shaath said the $ 42 million would be enough to get things moving . &quot; Of course we did not cover all our requirements , but you can ' t get everything you want at one go . We were looking_for $ 70 million , but that ' s a good batting_average , &quot; Shaath said . &quot; I told them it costs so_much less to make a success story than to bail people out of a catastrophe , &quot; Shaath added . A Western diplomat in Tunis said : &quot; I think everyone realizes the guy ( Arafat ) has got_to be helped . Because if he goes and the whole_thing falls_apart , then everybody loses. &quot; There is a mood of irritation at Arafat ' s headquarters , where advisers say they are frankly sick_of people wringing their hands_over cash crises and blaming the PLO for incompetent administration . &quot; What crisis ? &quot; one senior Arafat adviser shouted . &quot; So we are penniless ? We have had a cash crisis for the past three years , and who was paying any attention ? There are people here who already haven ' t received their salaries for months . It ' s high_time the donors start sending money if they want to solve the crisis instead of always talking. &quot; Arafat has tentatively set his departure for Jericho for the second_half of June and has ordered the closing of most PLO offices in Tunis by Wednesday . Privately , PLO officials say the key question remains the issue of security . And they wonder if the safety of Arafat and his accompanying ministers can be guaranteed by the new Palestinian police_force . &quot; I don ' t know if he will be able to go_back , &quot; one PLO official said . &quot; The man has been sentenced to death in Gaza and Jericho. &quot; The official added : &quot; Arafat , when he goes_back , will be face to face with his people and his police at_the_same_time . I remember ( former Egyptian President Anwar ) Sadat , one of his soldiers killed him . So I don ' t know , a Palestinian policeman who hasn ' t got his salary for five months , how is he going_to behave ? And his family back in Algiers with nothing ? Not even money to buy_food ? &quot; Arafat ' s top aides exude confidence about the return . &quot; This mentality of lamentation must be stopped , &quot; one senior adviser said . &quot; Security shouldn ' t play any role . This is our country . Whether security is good or bad , this is our country , and he has to deal with it . When he goes_back , there will be three months of festivities . At least . And after the three months , there is hard labor. &quot;</TEXT>
