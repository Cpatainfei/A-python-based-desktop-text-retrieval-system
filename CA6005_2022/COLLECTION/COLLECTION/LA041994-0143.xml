   <HEADLINE> PUBLIC WORKERS ' STRIKE IN HAWAII CURBS SERVICES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tax refunds and unemployment claims were delayed and libraries were closed Monday when more_than 13 # 000 state and county workers went_on strike for the first time in the 60-year history of the Hawaii Government Employees Assn . The union is seeking a minimum 8 % pay raise over two years , twice what the state and counties have offered . Representatives from both sides ended negotiations early Monday , and picket_lines went_up around the state . The negotiators remained on call , however , said Russell Okata , executive_director of the government employees union . &quot; We have told the membership the success of the strike depends_on solidarity , but they should be prepared_for a long strike , &quot; Okata said as he joined the picket_line outside the Honolulu Municipal Building . Gov . John Waihee said he regretted the walkout . &quot; There are rarely winners in any strike , &quot; he said . The strike affected everything from health clinics to municipal golf_courses to the issuance of licenses and permits . State offices where people normally have until April 20 to drop_off tax_returns were closed , and officials said taxpayers would have to use the mail , which could take them longer to receive refunds . Public_schools remained open and police and firefighters were not striking , as unions representing teachers , firefighters and police_officers accepted the 4 % offer . But 6 # 700 other workers , many of them in non-teaching positions at the University of Hawaii , were expected to join the strike Friday . The state ' s tourism industry was not expected to be affected , officials said , because all employees vital to airport operations were declared essential and forbidden to strike . People flying to the Mainland were advised to get_to the airport up_to two hours early , however . Others deemed essential were police dispatchers , lifeguards , security_guards , school health aides and hospital X-ray technicians . Golfer Henry Ally , who usually plays_at the Ala Wai course Wednesdays and Fridays , took the disruption in stride . &quot; I hope I can play_on Wednesday , but I ' m skeptical , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
