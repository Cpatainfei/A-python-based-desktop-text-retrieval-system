   <HEADLINE> BOYS ' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP ; UNIVERSITY RUNS WILD TO BEAT CORONA DEL MAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> University ' s loose interpretation of basketball annoyed , badgered and generally unnerved another opponent Wednesday night . Yes , the Trojans played it their way in a 68-63 Sea View League victory over Corona del Mar at University . They ran , they pressed-to-stress and threw caution , not to mention shots , to the wind . It was enough to make a coach shake his head , which Corona del Mar ' s Paul Orris was doing afterward . &quot; We talked_about playing the transition game when we wanted to , not just because University was doing_it , &quot; Orris said . Ah , but the Trojans had other ideas . The Sea_Kings ( 11-9 , 3-5 ) are generally a pick-and-pass team who work their half-court offense , but University would have none of that . The Sea_Kings were pulled into a chaotic style . University ( 12-7 , 5-3 ) employed a variety of presses , when they didn ' t work , the Trojans got physical . They had three players foul_out , but forced 29 turnovers , including four in the final 1 minute 33 seconds that helped preserve a one-point lead . Ali Amiri ( 17 points ) made two free_throws with 30 seconds left to give the Trojans a 66-63 lead . The Sea_Kings missed a three-point attempt , then had one more turnover left in them . It resulted in a layup by Demitrius Zeigler . &quot; We feel other teams should adjust to our style , we don ' t need to adjust to theirs , &quot; Zeigler said . Zeigler , Orange County ' s leading scorer , emphasized that point . He suffered through a terrible game as a shooter , but he that didn ' t let that slow him down . Zeigler scored 30 points , but made only eight of 20 shots , including two of eight three-pointers . But , in the fourth quarter , he found his touch . He made four of five shots and scored 12 points . Twice , Corona del Mar tied the score and both times Zeigler answered . He sank a three-pointer to give the Trojans a 61-58 lead with 2:22 left . He then stole the inbound pass and scored to give them a five-point lead . Zeigler then made a free_throw with 1:33 left to give University a 64-63 lead . &quot; No matter what you have done through three quarters , the fourth quarter is it , &quot; said Zeigler , who made 12 of 18 free_throws . &quot; You have to step_up . that ' s what makes superstars. &quot; It also helps to be in a free-wheeling system with a shot-it-if-you-got-it philosophy . The Trojans fired_up 22 three-point attempts , making eight . That included Dustin White ' s heave from well-behind the three-point line with less than two minutes left and the Trojans nursing a one-point lead . But such madness can create havoc and the Sea_Kings couldn ' t handle it . They turned the ball_over 13 times in the first_quarter and trailed , 37-26 , at halftime . Ramin Bastani scored 16 of his 27 points in the second_half to bring the Sea_Kings back . But , in the end , they were out of their element . &quot; Nobody has been able to do what they wanted against us , &quot; Coach Mike Dinneen said . CHRIS FOSTER</TEXT>
