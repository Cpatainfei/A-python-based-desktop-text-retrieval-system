   <HEADLINE> U.S. MOVES TOWARD JAPAN TRADE SANCTIONS ; COMMERCE : TOKYO EXPRESSES WILLINGNESS TO KEEP TALKING , BUT NOT UNDER THE THREAT OF PUNITIVE MEASURES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Increasing its pressure on Tokyo to settle an irritating trade dispute , the United States took steps Sunday to impose punitive measures if a 60-day negotiating period does not give U.S. companies a greater share of Japanese government purchases of telecommunications and medical equipment . However , analysts said they did not think the United States really wants to impose such sanctions . U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced the measure after talks in Washington between U.S. and Japanese officials broke_off Saturday , one day before a twice-postponed deadline to produce an agreement that would end what the United States says is Japan ' s &quot; persistent pattern of discrimination &quot; against U.S. manufacturers in the two lucrative sectors . Negotiations have been conducted , on and off , for nearly a year , since medical equipment and telecommunications gear were given a high priority . &quot; The time has come_to use our trade laws . . . if necessary to address the question of continued discrimination against U.S. companies , &quot; Kantor said in a statement . In Tokyo , Chief Cabinet Secretary Kozo Igarashi said Japan is ready to resume trade framework talks with the United States but has no intention of continuing negotiations under U.S. sanctions pressure . Igarashi told a news_conference , however , that both countries agree the two sides have the will to continue framework talks to seek a solution to their differences . &quot; Even if trade talks on government procurement were to be canceled , other sectors under the framework talks should be maintained , &quot; he said . In Tokyo markets , the dollar fell sharply this morning , opening at 98.45 yen , down 1.48 yen from Friday ' s close , but it recovered to 98.95 yen by midday . Stocks were mixed . U.S. and Japanese officials have said that the obstacle to reaching an agreement is determining acceptable &quot; qualitative and quantitative &quot; criteria for measuring the U.S. penetration of the Japanese market . The Japanese object to any effort to set specific goals , fearing they could become mandatory targets that , if not met , could lead to the imposition of sanctions in the form of U.S. tariffs on Japanese products sold in the United States or quotas limiting such sales . The United States insists that the two nations arrive_at some system that will provide a clear measure of whether foreign companies are able to penetrate the Japanese market . The procedures announced Sunday provide that if an agreement is not reached within 60 days , the Clinton_Administration has the authority to raise tariffs on certain Japanese products shipped to the United States , a step that would probably lead to higher consumer prices for those items . While the threat of sanctions would suggest that the difficult U.S.-Japanese trade relationship is headed for new depths , neither side expressed great concern . Jeffrey Young , an analyst with Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd . in Tokyo , said Japanese negotiators appear confident that Washington does not really want to impose sanctions . Some analysts in Tokyo , he noted , believe sanctions would hurt the United States more_than Japan . U.S. officials cite what they say is a need to apply strong pressure on Japanese negotiators , and Japanese officials expressed the expectation that the talks would resume in September before any sanctions are imposed . For more_than 15 years , the United States and Japan have been engaged in a running dispute over whether the Japanese government , in its own purchases , has frozen_out foreign suppliers . The controversy is just one element among many straining U.S.-Japanese trade relations . U.S. firms also complain that Tokyo is frustrating their efforts to sell cars and car parts , to gain a firm foothold in construction and a bigger share of insurance and investment . Kantor ' s office said sales by foreign companies make_up 25 % of the average domestic private and public telecommunications market in the industrialized world but that the foreign share of this $ 10-billion market in Japan is 5 % . U.S. manufacturers hold 40 % of the medical technology market in the European Union , the trade office said , but their share_in Japan is less than half that . Kantor said four factors hamper foreign suppliers in competing for Japanese government contracts : * Limited access to early information on upcoming procurements . * Reliance by government_agencies on an informal network of Japanese companies . * Insufficient consideration of the technical merits of foreign bids . * Development of technical specifications in telecommunications that favor local companies .
