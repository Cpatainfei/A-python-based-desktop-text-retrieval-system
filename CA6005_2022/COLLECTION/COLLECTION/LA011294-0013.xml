   <TEXT> * Having read &quot; Multicultural Manners &quot; ( Voices , Dec . 27 ) , I am appalled by the ignorant and prejudicial conclusion offered_up by your writer , Norine Dresser . In the scenario , when the American , referred to as Sandy , asks_in a friendly manner as_to her acquaintance ' s first_name , she is coolly rebuffed.The situation turns awkward . Dresser states that most Asians equate informality with disrespect and that Sandy was perceived to have behaved impertinently . She states that Sandy was wrong to have taken such liberties . What Dresser fails to acknowledge is that the acquaintance ( Mrs . Rao from India ) is new_to America and has an equal responsibility to try to understand the customs of her host nation . A more proper response might have been for Mrs . Rao to reply that her culture preferred to use the family surname and that she might be more comfortable with using her first_name after they know one another better . When two different cultures meet , it is incumbent upon both to try to understand the other ' s viewpoints and customs -- that is the only way that we can learn understanding and tolerance .
