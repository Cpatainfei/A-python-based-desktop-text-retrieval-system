   <HEADLINE> REAL SHAMANS DEAL IN PHYSICAL ILLS , INNER PEACE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> American_Indian medicine strives to treat a person ' s spirit as well as his physical problems to restore harmony . &quot; We have the belief that when you have an illness it is not only physical but also spiritual , and has a lot to do with your thinking , &quot; said Rick Two Dogs , a Lakota medicine_man on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South_Dakota . &quot; In Western medicine , if you have a pain in your stomach , they ' ll give you something for the pain but not go_into what ' s behind causing the pain , the spiritual . If you dig deeper you will find the source . &quot; Our work is with the Great Spirit . I know in Western medicine a lot of times , if any , there is no prayer involved. &quot; Thomas Banyacya Sr. , 85 , a spokesman for religious people on the Hopi Reservation in Arizona , said most of his people ' s healers hold spiritual ceremonies . &quot; They have to know certain things and songs that go_with this healing , &quot; Banyacya said . &quot; There are herbs they use that could help people . Peyote is one of them . It ' s not a drug , but the white_men call it that . Some of the herbs have the special gift to heal people. &quot; Banyacya lives at Oraibi , which he said is the oldest continuously inhabited community in the United States . It is near the Third Mesa on the Hopi Reservation in northeastern Arizona . For the Navajo , &quot; a lot of traditional medicine is creating a healthy mental acceptance of death , &quot; said Charles Cambridge , an anthropologist and a Navajo from the Folded Arms Clan . &quot; There are evil forces in the universe that go_about wreaking havoc on the land and traditional people . A lot of what medicine people do is that they have to contend with the evilness out there . &quot; So the medicine_man is extremely important for his community and tribe . He is a physician and , not unlike a priest , he represents the moral health of the community and tribe . He sets the standards of moral behavior &quot; for his community . Cambridge said the Navajos believe if a person is ill , there is disharmony . &quot; Traditional people always are concerned with harmony -- the balance between good and evil , the relation of all parts of the universe , the relation of the gods and spirits , the animals and the rocks , how everything behaves in relationship to each other , &quot; Cambridge said .</TEXT>
