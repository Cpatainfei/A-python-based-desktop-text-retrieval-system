   <HEADLINE> CELEBRATING A CENTURY OF GAUMONT ; MOVIES : THE REVERED FRENCH STUDIO IS THE FOCUS OF A NINE-WEEK RETROSPECTIVE PRESENTING HISTORIC , MODERN AND RARE FILMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Nicolas Seydoux , the man who runs Gaumont , looks_around for that entity ' s peers , he doesn ' t see any . &quot; We are dean of all_the movie companies in the world , &quot; Seydoux says with not unnatural pride . &quot; All the others have disappeared. &quot; For though Americans like to think that everything to do with motion_pictures had its beginnings over here , it was in Paris in early 1895 that the Lumiere brothers had the first public showing of a projected film . And just a_few months after that , a young_man named Leon Gaumont took_over a company that sold photographic and optical equipment and , not surprisingly , renamed it after himself . Gaumont was primarily interested in things technical , but when the making of films helped the sale of his equipment , that was OK with him . Now , 100 years and some 7 # 000 films later , a cross_section of the massive oak that grew from that tiny seed will be_on display over nine weeks at UCLA ' s Melnitz Hall in a remarkable series called &quot; Gaumont Presents : A Century of French Cinema. &quot; From the earliest of silent films to the most modern international co-productions , Gaumont has been such an active player it ' s considered the oldest continuously operating film studio in the world . Which is the reason for the program ' s 13-city tour , touching_down in Los Angeles today through Dec . 3 . &quot; When you are a century old , when you have a major birthday , &quot; Seydoux explains , &quot; of course you celebrate it. &quot; With its familiar daisy logo and its chain of cinemas , Gaumont is an established brand name in France . &quot; From the beginning , &quot; writes film historian Alan Williams , &quot; they prided themselves on the technical quality of their films , but they have also been the most artistically oriented studio. &quot; So although the Gaumont name is not exactly celebrated here , many of its films are , and this series is a chance to see all_of them fully restored , with new prints and even newly written English subtitles . A case_in_point is Jean Vigo , the influential poet of personal cinema who died in 1934 at age 29 . Gaumont is especially proud_of its association with him , and in addition to his classics , &quot; Zero de Conduite &quot; and &quot; L ' Atalante , &quot; two rarely screened shorts , &quot; A propos de Nice &quot; and &quot; Taris et la natation &quot; ( Taris Swimming ) , will also be shown . For audiences with still more modern tastes , the Gaumont series features everything from Eric Rohmer ' s restrained &quot; Die Marquise von O &quot; ( The Marquise of O ) to the sentimental &quot; Cousin , Cousine &quot; and Luc Besson ' s ultra-violent &quot; La Femme Nikita. &quot; Also , for those who didn ' t get enough the last time around , the uncut , 192-minute version of Jean-Jacques Beineix ' s &quot; Betty Blue &quot; will unspool . * For the true believers , however , the program ' s most awaited treasures are its silent films , an unprecedented chance to see films by people such_as Emile Cohl , Leonce Perret and the legendary Alice Guy ( later Guy-Blache ) who have mostly been no more_than names in history books until now . A master of a whole variety of visual techniques , Cohl is considered the pivotal figure in the history of animation , the first_person to see it as a form apart from mere visual trickery , and his playful and charming shorts still amuse today . On the same program Sunday with Cohl is Leonce Perret ' s &quot; Child of Paris , &quot; which was considered the discovery of the festival when it played in Manhattan recently . Made in 1913 , two years before D . W . Griffith ' s &quot; The Birth of a Nation , &quot; it was called &quot; the most important French film of its time &quot; by archivist Henri Langlois . &quot; Child , &quot; the Dickensian story of a little_girl without parents who gets repeatedly kidnaped and in_general faces more perils than Pauline , is characterized by naturalistic acting and inventive visuals noticeably in_advance of what anyone , even Griffith , was doing at the time . As for Alice Guy , though she did receive some recognition late in life , her key position in film history was for a long_time underreported . More_than being the first female producer-director , she established the Gaumont house style of filming in real locations and is a contender for the title of first_person ever to make a fiction film , 1896 ' s &quot; The Cabbage Fairy. &quot; By the time she went_to the United States in 1907 , Guy had directed something like 300 films , including a complex &quot; Life of Christ &quot; and the charming &quot; Sur la Barricade , &quot; in which a man ' s attempt to get some milk for his mother during the Paris Commune almost has dire results . One of Guy ' s proteges , Louis Feuillade , was responsible_for some of the most memorable of all silent filmmaking , ambitious multi-hour serials such_as &quot; Judex &quot; and &quot; Les Vampires &quot; that were a sensation when they first appeared and that continue to delight audiences . &quot; Les Vampires , &quot; released in 1915-16 , was banned for a time for being an &quot; exaltation of evil &quot; and is considered perhaps the first film to take that increasingly popular tack . Nominally the story of how a plucky reporter tracks_down a criminal band that is intimidating all France , it is really more fascinated with the gang itself , a black-hooded and daring bunch that poisons , robs and terrorizes with impunity . And one of its leaders , the kohl-eyed Irma Vep ( played by Musidora ) was as bewitching as she was villainous . * Though these films ' French subtitles are fairly rudimentary , UCLA will provide a simultaneous verbal translation . Robert Israel will contribute organ accompaniment , and , as an extra inducement , the silents will be accompanied by Gaumont ' s celebrated newsreels , offering glimpses of Monet painting among Giverny ' s water_lilies , a cigarette glued to his lips , and New York City motorcycle_cops circa 1913 giving some of the world ' s first speeding_tickets . On the same Oct . 27 bill with &quot; La poison &quot; is an exceptional work by a very different director , Robert Bresson ' s austere 1956 classic &quot; Un homme condamne a mort s ' est echappe &quot; ( A Man Escaped ) . The film , acclaimed by Francois Truffaut as &quot; the most important film of the last 10 years , &quot; painstakingly delineates the imprisonment and plot to escape of a French resistance leader during World_War_II . Based on a true story and told with Bresson ' s trademark purity and control , this film is totally involving because of its avoidance of any kind of deliberately dramatic effect . Made with extensive use of close-ups , a sober voice-over , Mozart ' s Mass in C minor and non-professional actors , &quot; Escaped &quot; is the best introduction to Bresson ' s demanding but exhilarating style and probably his masterpiece as well . With both this and the Guitry showing in the best prints available in this country since their original release , this is the one Gaumont night to go_to if you ' re only going_to one . * UCLA ' s Melnitz Theater is_on the northeast corner of the Westwood campus , near the intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Hilgard Avenue . Tickets are $ 3 and $ 5 ; matinee tickets a re $ 3 and $ 1.50. Parking is available for $ 5 . For information and schedule , call ( 310 ) 206-FILM .</TEXT>
