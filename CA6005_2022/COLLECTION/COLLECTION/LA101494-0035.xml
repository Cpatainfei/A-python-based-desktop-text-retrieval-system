   <HEADLINE> STANDING ALONE IN RESISTING IRAQ ? ; IF NECESSARY , U.S. SHOULD ACT UNILATERALLY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The firm international support that quickly gathered behind the bold American-led response to Iraq ' s most recent threats toward Kuwait has begun to show disturbing signs of slippage . The United States wants the U.N. Security_Council to limit Saddam Hussein ' s freedom of military_action in southern Iraq . What Washington rightly fears is that without externally enforced restraints the Iraqi dictator could again move at any time to menace Kuwait and Saudi_Arabia . Initially , U.S. officials floated the idea of a deep exclusion zone from which Iraqi heavy_weapons would be banned . The other permanent members of the council -- Britain , China , France and Russia -- showed little interest in that notion . Now Madeleine Albright , the American ambassador to the United Nations , is trying to get a consensus for a simpler plan requiring only that Iraq ' s best troops , the Republican Guards , permanently leave the area . The tactical merit in this idea is that the largely ineffectual regular Iraqi conscript troops that would remain could not be trusted to carry_off anything as demanding as a second invasion of Kuwait . The real threat comes from the Republican Guards ; it ' s their personal loyalty to Saddam Hussein that helps to make them so dangerous as a fighting force . that ' s why Washington wants them out of southern Iraq . Albright has a lot of persuading to do , not least because France and Russia have powerful commercial reasons for going easy with Iraq , including relaxing the sanctions that were imposed four years ago . Both countries stand to gain billions when trade and investment with Baghdad again become legal . This consideration , of course , influences their diplomacy . Could the United States act to enforce its own restraints on Iraqi actions in southern Iraq without a specific new Security_Council mandate ? Washington has already indicated that it believes it has that authority , under both existing U.N. resolutions and Article 51 of the U.N. Charter , which affirms the right of individual and collective self-defense . In Saudi_Arabia Thursday U.S. Defense_Secretary William J . Perry said that while most American ground troops will probably leave Kuwait soon , a considerable U.S. air presence will remain in the region to make_sure that Iraq behaves itself . Clearly , strong international support for keeping Saddam in_line is preferable ; it is not , however , strictly required . The United States , weighing its own national interests , is apparently ready to act_on its own if need be to protect its friends and vital world oil supplies in the Persian_Gulf . That would be a tough decision to take , but a necessary one .</TEXT>
