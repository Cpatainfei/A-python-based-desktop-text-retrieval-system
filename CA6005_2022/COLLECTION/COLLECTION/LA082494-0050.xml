   <TEXT> &quot; Four Hands &quot; by the Mexican novelist Paco Ignacio Taibo II is a political thriller that sometimes resembles a crazy mosaic fashioned out of the shards of shattered novels -- E . L . Doctorow ' s &quot; Ragtime , &quot; Robert Stone ' s &quot; Dog Soldiers , &quot; and , above all , the half-plausible , half-paranoid works of Richard Condon . that ' s not to say &quot; Four Hands &quot; is a mere pastiche . Taibo writes with genuine savvy , a crackling wit and a certain zaniness that is his very own . Once we pick_up the strange but beguiling rhythms of his narrative style , we begin to understand that Taibo is a storyteller of real genius . &quot; Century after century , &quot; muses one of the slightly cracked conspirators who populate &quot; Four Hands , &quot; nicely summing_up what ' s happening in the rest of the book , &quot; professionals of power hired professionals of information , who hired professionals of curiosity , who hired legalized criminals to keep the game in play. &quot; The heroes of his tale , if we can single_out only a_couple_of the memorable characters in &quot; Four Hands , &quot; are Greg Simon and Julio ( Fats ) Fernandez , an odd couple of international investigative journalism , whose first-person reminiscences are presented in alternating , almost Rashomon-style testimony that begins to reveal a labyrinthine plot of dazzling complexity . Greg is an American , &quot; a Los Angeles Jew raised in an orphanage for Catholic boys , later living_in a black neighborhood , and finally going_to a high_school that for some strange reason was_full of Koreans. &quot; Julio is a Mexican , a man who &quot; expects a mixture of astonishment , frustrated paternal relationships , commiseration and dazzle from the world. &quot; And the title of &quot; Four Hands &quot; refers to their intimate collaboration at the typewriter_keyboard where they compose the stories that ultimately draw them into an intimate dance with spies , hit_men , terrorists , drug dealers and assorted other malefactors in a complex fugue of crime , obsession and violence . &quot; Landscapes of the religion of the scoop , the exclusive , &quot; is how Greg describes the turf where they live and work . &quot; The faces of the truth and the truth that made faces as one drummed one ' s fingers on the typewriter , creating immortals , freezing in time the stories arduously chased down alleys , into living rooms and plazas. &quot; But Greg and Julio are only two of the men and women who flash in and out of view like figures in a hall of mirrors . There ' s Alex , the merry prankster who doubles as a spymaster in deep cover . Rolando is a drug_trafficker &quot; on ( his ) way to becoming one of Mexico ' s blackest legends. &quot; Stoyan Vasilev is a profoundly enigmatic 82-year-old Bulgarian counter-spy who haunts ( and is haunted by ) a half-century of history and politics . And , intriguingly , Taibo drafts various historical figures into service as characters in &quot; Four Hands &quot; -- Stan Laurel , Leon Trotsky , Pancho Villa , Harry Houdini -- and they take_on new and beguiling dimensions as Taibo inserts them in the phantasmagoria of his narrative . Indeed , Houdini ' s imagined confessions to his psychoanalyst are as poignant , and as plausible , as any of the historical asides that decorate Taibo ' s book . Now and then , Taibo throws_in stuff that is simply intended to send up his characters . We are allowed to peek into intelligence dossiers and confidential notes ; we are given Trotsky ' s early drafts of an unpublished mystery novel . And , again and again , we are invited to read various versions of &quot; Elena Jordan ' s Rejected Thesis Proposal , &quot; a running joke about Julio ' s ex-wife . &quot; Who the hell invented and propagated , and with what insane intentions , &quot; she writes in a frenzy of anger and frustration , &quot; the concept of ' theoretical work ' ? &quot; The fever dream that is Taibo ' s novel reaches a crescendo when the various conspirators , who have been just missing each other for 300 pages or so , finally collide in a hotel corridor in Mexico_City , a conflagration that features an antique Colt six-shooter and &quot; the first recorded Tequila Molotov. &quot; &quot; It ' s quite unreal , quite absurd , &quot; says one of Alex ' s operatives when the smoke finally clears , &quot; it ' s like a Spielberg movie. &quot; Still , &quot; Four Hands &quot; ends_up almost making_sense , and what ' s what shows us how deftly and how deeply we have been drawn into Taibo ' s grand passions and twisted logic . &quot; Reality is becoming more and more Bulgarian , &quot; says one character , a crack that amounts to the punch_line to an in-joke , but only if you ' ve followed Taibo to the end of his marvelous story .</TEXT>
