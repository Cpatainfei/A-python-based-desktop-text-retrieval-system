   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA POSTPONES JOINING PEACE PLAN ; MILITARY : ' PARTNERSHIP ' PROGRAM CALLS FOR COOPERATION WITH NATO . CLINTON_ADMINISTRATION CONCERNED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The escalating warfare between Bosnian Serb forces and U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia-Herzegovina claimed another casualty Thursday : plans for greater cooperation between Russia and the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization . Russian Foreign Minister Andrei D . Kozyrev announced in Moscow that he has postponed Russia ' s entry into the &quot; Partnership for Peace , &quot; President Clinton ' s program for increased cooperation between NATO and the former Communist nations of Eastern Europe . In Washington , State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the Clinton_Administration is concerned about the Russian decision and hopes that it does not mean a definitive reversal of Russia ' s decision to join the partnership . Clinton has made Partnership for Peace the centerpiece of Western efforts to promote stability in Europe . Kozyrev called_off a scheduled April 21 visit to Brussels , where he was to enroll Russia in the program , and tied the decision to his government ' s complaint that it was not fully consulted in_advance of NATO air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions earlier this week . He told reporters Thursday that Russia first needs to define its conditions for collaborating with NATO . &quot; We are interested in much more serious relations , which would rule_out surprises and unilateral measures , especially military ones , in those areas where we should be cooperating more closely , &quot; Kozyrev said . A senior U.S. official said it was unclear whether Russia ' s decision to stay out of the partnership will last long . &quot; There have been some indications that they would like to trade membership ( in the partnership ) for closer ties to Western economies . . . but we don ' t know , &quot; he said . The Russians were upset by the NATO air strikes against the Serbs , and U.S. officials were annoyed by the Russians ' reaction , he said . Nevertheless , the two governments are still cooperating in diplomatic efforts in Bosnia , he said . Russian special envoy Vitaly S . Churkin has been trying to persuade the Bosnian Serbs , who look_to Russia as an ally , to return to peace talks , and the Administration backs his efforts , he said . But the Serbs ' abduction of U.N. peacekeepers Thursday only underscored the limits on Moscow ' s leverage -- coming only one day after Churkin announced that the Serbs assured him that they would not &quot; throw down the gauntlet to the international community. &quot; &quot; We believe that the Russians are working in furtherance of the objectives that we too have -- which is an end to the fighting wherever it ' s occurring . . . resumption of discussions about cessation of hostilities and continued pursuit of an overall political settlement that the international community can then help enforce , &quot; McCurry said . &quot; I don ' t want to suggest that on every aspect of the negotiation under way do we necessarily see things the same way , &quot; he added . Meanwhile , Clinton urged the Bosnian Serbs to stop attacking U.N. peacekeepers . &quot; I think the Serbs would be making a mistake to start treating the United Nations and NATO forces as adverse combatants , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; That is not what we are doing . We are trying to get them to honor their words. &quot; McCurry denied that the Administration is threatening any specific retaliation for attacks on U.N. forces . But , he added , &quot; I think the Serbs have come_to know in the last several days that there is an ' or else. ' &quot; McManus reported from Washington and Boudreaux reported from Moscow .</TEXT>
