   <HEADLINE> GOVERNMENT TAKES_AIM AT GM PICKUPS ; AUTOS : THE 1973-87 C-K TRUCKS ARE FOUND TO POSE AN ' UNREASONABLE RISK. ' COMPANY VOWS A FIGHT IN COURT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> General Motors Corp . C-K series pickup_trucks , which have been involved in several fatal fires following side-impact crashes , pose an &quot; unreasonable risk , &quot; Transportation_Secretary Federico Pena said Monday . He scheduled a Dec . 6 hearing to determine whether the government should require GM to recall the trucks , made between 1973 and 1987 , which are sold under the GMC and Chevrolet nameplates . The decision &quot; is totally unjustified , &quot; Bruce G . MacDonald , GM vice_president for communications , said in Detroit . &quot; The suggestion that GM put sales ahead of safety is outrageous and wrong. &quot; The company rejected an April 9 , 1993 , government request that it recall the trucks voluntarily . About 150 people have died as a result of side-impact fires in the trucks in crashes that were otherwise survivable , and many others suffered serious burns , Pena said . The trucks have been widely criticized because their fuel tanks are mounted outside the body frame , allowing_for larger tanks and therefore longer driving range , but making the tanks vulnerable to damage . &quot; This design was selected for marketing reasons , &quot; Pena said , adding that it was not changed for 15 years despite &quot; evidence that GM was aware , possibly as early as the mid-1970s but certainly by the early 1980s , that this design made these trucks more vulnerable and that fatalities from side-impact fires were occurring. &quot; A National Highway Traffic Safety Administration study found 2.8 fire-related deaths per 1 million registered vehicle years in the GM pickups , compared to one death per million in Ford trucks , which enclose the fuel tank within the frame . About 9 million of the GM trucks were built and about half are believed to still be_on the road , the Transportation Department said . &quot; The record clearly shows that there is an increased risk associated with these GM pickups , and ( it ) leads me to conclude at this point that the risk is unreasonable , &quot; Pena told a news_conference . GM ' s MacDonald said the trucks &quot; have fully met the applicable safety standards for fuel_system integrity in collisions . . . . There is simply no legal or scientific basis on which to seek a recall of these trucks under the Vehicle Safety Act . If necessary , we will defend their safety in court. &quot; In his statement , Pena noted that the law requires vehicles to both meet safety standards and to be safe in &quot; real_world conditions. &quot; The government began investigating the safety of the pickups in 1992 in response to petitions by the Center for Auto Safety and Public Citizen . It has collected more_than 100 # 000 pages of material on the issue . The public hearing is required before a company can be ordered to conduct a recall . However , even if the government acted immediately , the eight-year statute of limitations would bar it from requiring a recall of trucks made before 1986 , limiting the action to the last two model years involved . GM changed the design in 1988 . In June , a Georgia court overturned a ruling that GM was liable for the 1989 death of a teen-ager in one of the trucks , voiding a $ 105.2-million award to the victim ' s family . GM ' s rebuttal to a &quot; Dateline NBC &quot; program that portrayed the trucks as dangerous disclosed that toy rocket_engines had been used to fake an explosion in a collision staged for the broadcast .</TEXT>
