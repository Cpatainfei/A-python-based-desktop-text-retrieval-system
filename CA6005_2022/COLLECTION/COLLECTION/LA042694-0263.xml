   <HEADLINE> JAPANESE SOCIALISTS BOLT , IMPERIL COALITION RULE ; POLITICS : HATA , NEW PREMIER , LOSES MAJORITY IN PARLIAMENT . FUTURE OF HIS GOVERNMENT IS IN DOUBT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Twelve hours after electing former Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as prime_minister in Parliament , Japan ' s fractious ruling coalition collapsed early this morning . Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama announced at 1:22 a.m. that his party was bolting the coalition and would no longer be bound by a policy agreement hammered_out just last Friday after seven days of bitter debate that had pushed the coalition to the brink of a split . The move stripped Hata ' s coalition of its majorities in both the lower and upper houses of Parliament and left up_in_the_air whether the coalition can continue to rule . It also threw into doubt Japan ' s ability to fulfill a promise to the United States to produce a sweeping program of economic_policies in June to substantially reduce its $ 141-billion global trade surplus , including a $ 60-billion imbalance with the United States . Although Hata won 274 votes_in the lower house election for prime_minister -- a solid majority in the 511-seat chamber -- a walkout by all 74 Socialists would reduce the coalition ' s strength to 200 seats . That is fewer than the 206 seats held by the opposition Liberal Democratic Party ( LDP ) that was ousted last summer after 38 years in power . If the 15-seat New Party Harbinger -- which has already announced that it will not join the new Cabinet -- sides with the Socialists , the blow could be even bigger . There was no clear forecast of what might lie ahead . Among the possible scenarios : * The coalition could retain control if there is a split in the Socialist_Party -- whose rank-and-file members must still discuss their leaders ' abrupt move -- and if there are defections from the opposition Liberal Democrats . * The coalition might try to run a minority government by negotiating with parts of the opposition , including the Socialists , for support on every bill , including the budget ; this would be exceptionally risky , though , because the coalition would have to hope that no party would submit a no-confidence motion . * The coalition-led government might dissolve the lower house and call a general_election in hopes of settling the political chaos . Or there might be an alliance of convenience between the Socialists and the Liberal Democrats . Both of these steps , however , could threaten already-enacted political reforms -- cornerstones of eight months of labors by the coalition . The reforms will take_effect only after Parliament enacts a bill to fix boundaries of new single-seat districts ; any election before then would be held under the old system , with multi-seat districts and voters electing an average of four lawmakers from each constituency . Announcing the Socialists ' decision to quit the coalition , Murayama condemned their partners , including Hata ' s Renewal Party , for committing &quot; an act of betrayal &quot; by secretly forming a new &quot; parliamentary bargaining group &quot; called Kaishin ( Reformation ) and for &quot; changing the framework of the coalition &quot; by admitting two mini-parties that had not been in the coalition under former Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa . These acts , he said , were committed &quot; without any consultations at all &quot; with the Socialists and destroyed &quot; the faith and trust &quot; on which any coalition depends . &quot; From the standpoint of running the coalition democratically , we cannot forgive these acts , &quot; he said . The Socialist leader noted that the coalition earlier had agreed to freeze moves to form any &quot; bargaining group &quot; -- a group that operates in Parliament as a single party but whose two or more parties field candidates separately in elections . Socialists , who have insisted on maintaining their own identity within the coalition , want to see Japan retain a multi-party political_system . In contrast , Ichiro Ozawa , deputy leader of Hata ' s party and chief strategist under Hosokawa ' s coalition , advocates a two-party system . Formation of the new alliance in Parliament was widely viewed_as a step_in that direction . Murayama indirectly accused Ozawa of masterminding the alliance in_order to isolate the Socialists . The Socialist chief said he had called Hata to inform him of the decision made only by himself and the party ' s other two top officials . Hata asked him to &quot; wait , wait , &quot; but he said he replied , &quot; There is no room for any more discussions. &quot; Later , the Socialists ' central committee formally approved the leaders ' decision unanimously . In a separate meeting , the party ' s potential defectors -- who are banded_together in a conservative group called the &quot; Democrats &quot; -- also backed the move . Hata said he will appeal_to the Socialists to reverse their decision . If he fails , the remaining coalition partners will form a Cabinet by themselves , party leaders decided today , nine hours after disbanding in the middle of the night . Under Japan ' s constitution , Hata will not officially assume power as prime_minister until a ceremony is held_in the presence of Emperor Akihito . Until then , Hosokawa and his Cabinet_ministers , who resigned Monday , formally retain power . Liberal Democrat President Yohei Kono condemned Ozawa ' s &quot; highhanded &quot; methods of decision-making and said he will appeal_to both the Socialists and the New Party Harbinger to form an agreement on &quot; how to operate Parliament. &quot; The statement was regarded_as a veiled invitation to form a new coalition . Hata failed to explain why he had not called a meeting of coalition party chiefs Monday afternoon , as tentatively scheduled , to discuss the formation of a new Cabinet . Murayama angrily charged that he had waited four hours and learned only minutes before the meeting was finally to begin that the Reformation group already had been officially registered as a new parliamentary group with 130 lawmakers . Although apparently planned in_advance , formation of Reformation came without any public warning . Keigo Ouchi -- chairman of the middle-of-the-road Democratic Socialist_Party , which earlier had aligned itself with the Socialists -- fired the first shot . Without informing the Socialists , he telephoned other parties in the coalition to ask them to align themselves in the single bargaining group . Ouchi later said such a move would strengthen Hata ' s base of support . With blitzkrieg speed , Hata ' s Renewal Party , Hosokawa ' s Japan New Party , the Democratic Socialists and the two splinter parties leaped on the bandwagon . The Buddhist-backed Clean Government Party and a band of five recent defectors from the LDP also were reported leaning toward joining the group . But even with them , the group would fall far short of a majority . By the time the Socialists learned of the moves , Ouchi ' s proposal had taken_on the air of an ultimatum to &quot; join or quit &quot; the coalition . * RELATED STORY : D2</TEXT>
