   <HEADLINE> GOOD REASONS REMAIN TO INVEST IN , START TAX-SAVING IRAS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When you shop the market for individual_retirement_accounts these days , it ' s easy to get nostalgic for the good old days of IRAs . That era was the mid-1980s , when just about everybody with income from a job could make tax-deductible contributions , and financial services_firms were bidding eagerly for customers . Double-digit yields were everywhere , even on low-risk investments like certificates_of_deposit . Promotional come-ons often added extra money to the pot . Today the tax angles are a lot trickier , and money-market yields have fallen to their lowest levels in a generation . The annual IRA marketing blitz at tax time is only a faint echo of what it used to be . &quot; This will probably be another quiet year for IRAs , &quot; says the newsletter 100 Highest Yields , based in North Palm Beach , Fla . &quot; With interest_rates low , bank marketers don ' t foresee a lot of competition for deposits . Thus , the 10 % and even 25 % bonus rates that once applied to IRAs are going_to stay a memory. &quot; But just because the gold-rush mood has dissipated doesn ' t mean everybody should simply ignore the whole subject . Financial advisers say several good reasons persist to consider starting , or adding_to , IRAs . Since the tax laws were changed in 1987 , tax_deductions for annual IRA contributions of up_to $ 2 # 000 are limited to people who aren ' t covered by other retirement_plans at_work , and whose income doesn ' t exceed specified limits . For single taxpayers , a full deduction is available with adjusted gross income of $ 25 # 000 or less ; a partial deduction from $ 25 # 000 to $ 35 # 000 , and no deduction above that point . In the case of married_couples filing jointly , the full deduction stops at the $ 40 # 000 income level , with a partial deduction in the $ 40 # 000 to $ 50 # 000 range and nothing at $ 50 # 000 and above . &quot; Non-deductible contributions do not lower your current year ' s tax_bill , of course , &quot; says the accounting_firm of Arthur Andersen in a current handbook on tax strategies . &quot; But they do allow you to take_advantage of tax-deferred compounding of income until the earnings are withdrawn from the IRA . &quot; While the record-keeping created by non-deductible contributions can be heavy , they can help create a retirement nest egg. &quot; Once a saver has determined to make an IRA contribution , the problem remains of picking a good place to put the money . Not only are the pickings slim on fixed-return vehicles like CDs , but the choices are a bit scary in_stock and bond investments as well , if you listen to the many analysts predicting &quot; corrections &quot; for either or both of those markets . However , the typical IRA investment by definition is a long-term commitment . Most analysts believe you can confidently hope that stock prices will be considerably higher 10 or 20 years from now than they are today , even if you are not at all sure that they will rise over the next year or two . And yes , there still is some competition for your IRA business , at least among discount brokers and mutual_fund companies . Many of these firms have been reducing or eliminating their annual IRA account fees lately , at least for accounts of $ 5 # 000 or more . Other marketing inducements can still be found . For example , Calvert Group Inc. , manager of a family of socially conscious mutual_funds , is seeking IRA accounts by offering to donate $ 10 of its first year ' s annual $ 15 IRA fee to one of 22 nonprofit organizations . The deadline for all IRA contributions , deductible or not , for the 1993 tax year is April 15 , when most people ' s income_tax_returns are_due .</TEXT>
