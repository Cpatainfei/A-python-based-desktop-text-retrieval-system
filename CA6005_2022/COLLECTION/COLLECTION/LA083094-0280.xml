   <HEADLINE> NORTHERN EXPLORERS ; NEW SOVIET OIL EXPORT TAX KEEPS OXNARD FIRM WAITING FOR THE REWARDS OF ITS JOINT_VENTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a tiny , frozen encampment just south of the Arctic_Circle in western Siberia , Clancy Cottman entered a large tepee with 19 members of a local clan of reindeer herders . Cottman , vice_president of business development for Benton Oil and Gas Co. , had arranged the January , 1993 , meeting to ask the clan for permission to begin drilling for a vast pool of oil resting far beneath the surrounding tundra . Snacking on salted reindeer meat , Cottman assured the clan that the project would not harm fishing streams or damage grazing fields . When Cottman asked what Benton could offer the clan as compensation , the answer read like an order from L.L. Bean : 10 binoculars with cases , nine hunting_knives with sharpening stones , three pairs of heavy-duty gloves , nine Windbreakers , 100 feet of nylon rope , five sets of leather-sewing needles , needle-nose pliers , decorative beads , medical supplies and more . One month later , Alex Benton , the Russian-born chief_executive of the Oxnard company , personally delivered the supplies , and the clan , an indigenous tribe of nomads known as the Nentses , approved the project by unanimous vote . If only doing business with the Russian government and Boris Yeltsin were so easy . Like hundreds of U.S. companies , Benton Oil and Gas has ventured into the emerging free-market economy of Russia . The company ' s project , a joint_venture called Geoilbent Ltd. , has often been within reach of what Alex Benton calls &quot; the golden ring. &quot; But every time Benton has seemed close to collecting his bounty , political changes have pushed it another step away . Benton ' s bane has been a $ 5-per-barrel oil export tax imposed by Yeltsin in July , 1993 . That cut Benton ' s profit to just pennies per barrel , so he has put full development of the Siberian project on hold . Capable of yielding 100 # 000 barrels a day , the field is now producing 3 # 500 barrels a day . Recent moves by the Russian government have raised hopes that the oil tax could soon be lifted . But meanwhile Benton and his two Russian partners can only wait patiently , certain from the latest seismic analysis that under those reindeer herders are 350 million barrels of crude_oil waiting to be pumped out . Granted , the North Gubkinskoye field is small compared to the world ' s largest oil pockets -- including a 9-billion-barrel field partly controlled by Chevron in nearby Kazakhstan . But the size of Benton ' s project is something oil_companies &quot; have . . . dreams about finding in America , &quot; said oil analyst Charles Strain . As a 34 % partner in Geoilbent , Benton ' s share of the field would be more_than 100 million barrels . If Yeltsin ' s tax is lifted and the price of Siberian crude holds steady at the current $ 15 per barrel , Benton could make $ 500 million in profit over the next 20 years . If oil prices go_up and production_costs go_down , &quot; We should make $ 10 per barrel , &quot; Benton said . That could mean $ 1 billion in profit , and Benton , who owns 1.24 million shares of his company ' s stock , would become a very rich_man . Benton Oil ' s vast potential has attracted the attention of Ralph Wanger , manager of the highly regarded Acorn Fund in Chicago , which owns 440 # 000 shares of Benton . Benton ' s appeal , Wanger said , is that it is a small company whose stock could soar if the Russian venture takes_off . &quot; If Chevron goes_over there and does a project it might improve their earnings 3 % , &quot; Wanger said . &quot; But for Benton it could be very meaningful. &quot; A 25-year veteran of the industry , Benton is accustomed to the vicissitudes of the oil_business . But to have a project with such enormous potential blocked by something as nettlesome as Yeltsin ' s tax is especially infuriating to Benton , who has already invested $ 17 million in this effort . &quot; It ' s rather depressing after you ' ve put_in several years of work , countless trips to god-awful places , and extremely difficult negotiations with very tough people , &quot; Benton said . &quot; To have it disintegrate in front of your eyes is not a happy feeling. &quot; Founded in 1989 , Benton Oil and Gas has specialized in wringing oil from previously developed fields . Using the latest recovery technology , the company is currently squeezing oil from already-tapped fields in Louisiana and Venezuela . Those projects are considered to have enough potential that the Russian venture isn ' t critical to the company ' s future . &quot; If nothing happened anywhere else , Venezuela could justify the current price ( of Benton ' s stock ) on its own , &quot; said Herbert E . Hart , an oil analyst with the S.G. Warburg Group . Still , picking_over leftovers hasn ' t exactly been a feast . Benton reported $ 1.15 million in earnings on sales of $ 8.48 million in the June quarter , but that was the first profitable quarter since 1991 . Because of high development costs on its three projects , the company ' s losses over the last two years totaled $ 7.74 million on revenue of $ 16.4 million . So Benton ' s stock , which peaked at $ 18 per share_in 1991 , closed at just under $ 7 per share Monday . Critics have complained in recent years that Alex Benton has been better at raising hopes than producing oil . But in Russia , Benton could make enough money to silence his critics for decades . New Russian Prime_Minister Victor Chernomirdin recently formed a committee to consider granting exemptions to the oil export tax . If Benton ' s application to the committee is approved , the company would be exempt until it makes enough profit to recoup its investment . By the time that happens , Benton said , the tax might be eliminated entirely , or at least reduced . Analysts on Russian politics place even odds on the lifting of the tax , but Benton said he ' s optimistic , and his company is poised to strike quickly with a massive drilling effort that could bring the number of wells from nine currently to about 300 within five years . Benton , which promised to pay $ 25 million for its share of the partnership , would swiftly pump in the $ 8 million it still owes . More financing would come from the operation ' s early profits , $ 50 million in bank loans the company has applied for , and $ 50 million in bond proceeds that J.P. Morgan &amp; Co . and others are in the process of raising . Benton , who spent most of his career finding oil for other larger companies including Amoco , is understandably a bit breathless at his company ' s prospects . &quot; The fruit is about to be harvested , &quot; he said . But now he must wait a bit longer on a project that has required patience from the very beginning . Benton was born with the name Alexander Strochenko in 1942 in a Russian village between the Black and Caspian seas . His family fled three weeks later when Nazi troops rolled through the region in pursuit of the Caspian oil fields . After the war , his family emigrated to the Northern California town of Gilroy . Benton never considered returning to Russia until 1990 , when he was asked by the Russian government to take_part in a joint_venture involving the_virgin North Gubkinskoye field . So , accompanied by several of his executives , Benton flew to Moscow in January , 1991 . Check-in at a Moscow hotel took three hours , Benton said , with &quot; endless shouting matches &quot; between hotel_managers and Benton ' s host , the Russian Ministry of Geology . The toilets at the hotel didn ' t work and the beds were so small that the 5-foot-9-inch Benton said his feet dangled over the edge . That night , a drunken brawl erupted in the hotel hallway , and the Americans found broken bottles and blood outside their doors the next morning . A few hours later , they were the first passengers to board a Russian airplane that quickly filled_up like a subway car , with Russians wearing heavy coats and dragging heavier packages . Benton spent the flight sitting on a metal suitcase in the cockpit , the special guest of a pilot who said he had never seen an American traveling_to Siberia . The plane landed in a former gulag town about 2 # 000 miles northeast of Moscow , where high winds and minus 60-degree temperatures ruled_out helicopter flight . After a two-day wait , the Americans boarded a 1 a.m. train for Tarko-Sale , an oil town about 30 miles east of the North Gubkinskoye field . Benton has since made dozens of trips to Siberia . He prefers the brutal winter cold to the muggy heat of summer , when his workers have to wear beekeeper outfits to fend_off clouds of mosquitoes . Telephone communication with Siberia is extremely unreliable , Benton said , so he uses a satellite service . Now when he calls Russia his voice is bounced off a satellite above the Indian_Ocean and into a small dish that field managers in Siberia carry in a suitcase . Overcoming such obstacles is part of Benton ' s job . The company ' s Russian partners found the field , furnish much of the equipment and provide many of the 240 workers who pump the oil , but they needed Benton ' s cash and expertise to make_it a modern operation . Benton ' s proudest accomplishment is a 37-mile pipeline connecting the North Gubkinskoye field to the Soviet-built pipeline network that carries oil to refineries in the Czech Republic , Slovakia and Germany . Benton had the pipes built_in Texas but invited bids from Russian companies for their assembly and installation in Siberia . Bids ranged from $ 3 million to $ 9 million , and the contract went_to the low bidder , a company from Russia ' s Volga region , near the Ural mountains . American supervisors who oversaw the project were impressed by the competence of the Russian crew , Benton said , but could not understand why Russian welders took twice as long to fuse pipes as Americans did . Finally , the Americans realized that the Russian welders ' goggles were so scratched they could hardly see their hands as they worked . Furnished with new welding masks , Benton said , the Russians were as fast as Americans , if not a bit faster . The pipeline was finished in April , 1993 , and Benton seemed poised to take the project to full speed . But his plans were undone just three months later when Yeltsin imposed the oil tax , yanking away tax exemptions that Benton and other companies had been promised because they had invested early in Russian joint_ventures . Analysts say the oil tax is at the center of a political tug-of-war between reformers and protectionists . Though Yeltsin is considered a reformer , he imposed the tax to raise needed revenue and to appease his protectionist foes . He has since issued a decree lifting the tax , but his control of government bureaucrats is weak , experts said , and Yeltsin ' s latest decree has not been enforced . Prime_Minister Chernomirdin , formerly head of the Soviet natural_gas monopoly , is expected to have greater success because he is a political moderate who has relatively few enemies . And as prime_minister , he is in direct control of government_agencies . &quot; Chernomirdin can tell the ministry of revenue to collect ( the tax ) or not , &quot; said Richard B . Anderson , an assistant_professor of political_science at UCLA . As the Russian politicians battle on , Alex Benton plans his next trip to Siberia in September . He knows his oil will still be there , he just hopes the tax , and perhaps the mosquitoes , are gone .</TEXT>
