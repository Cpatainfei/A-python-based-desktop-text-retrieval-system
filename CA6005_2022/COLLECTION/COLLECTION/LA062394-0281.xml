   <TEXT> School ' s out_in Ventura County and thousands of teen-agers are_on the loose , many believing there is nothing to do and no job in_sight . Wrong . After weeks of investigation , Ventura County Life has uncovered an abundance of cool hangouts and activities -- plus the straight dope on who ' s hiring and who ' s getting hired . For the slack-hearted , we ' ve got Tips on Becoming a Successful Couch Potato . So keep this guide handy as you navigate through these lazy -- and hopefully not hazy -- days of summer . And don ' t forget the sun block . PLAYING Beaches and Harbors : The eternal teen-age question of &quot; what to do ? &quot; has a time-honored , simple solution in Ventura County : Head to the beach . You know the routine -- Zuma or Malibu if you live_in the east county , the entire coastline for everybody else . If lying out is your preferred beach activity , you might want to prevent rigor_mortis by renting in-line skates , three-wheelers and bikes by the hour at Beach Rentals , San Buenaventura State Beach ( 641-1932 ) . Two hours of in-line skating costs about $ 8 and will jump-start your circulatory_system . For an easy-going water experience , kayaks and foot-powered boats may be rented at Ventura Harbor ( 642-7753 ) . Pool Halls , Bowling_Alleys , Etc. : If your parents insist that pool halls and bowling_alleys are socially unacceptable , tell them to get with it . These once-sleazy venues have spruced_up , becoming safe havens for all but the athletically challenged . The county ' s proliferation of family pool halls means you don ' t have to go very far to find a table . For the price of a movie ticket , you and your friends can enjoy two or three hours of eight_ball while subliminally learning geometry , physics and math . Note : Some pool parlors require adult supervision or parents ' permission . Skating rinks , miniature_golf courses and batting_cages are also guaranteed boredom fighters . Some even have special reduced rates for the summer and offer inexpensive instructional classes .

Mark these openings on your calendar : * &quot; Blown Away &quot; ( July 1 ) -- Jeff Bridges plays a Boston explosives expert pitted against terrorist Tommy Lee Jones in this suspense thriller . * &quot; Baby ' s Day Out &quot; ( July 1 ) -- John Hughes , who showed us the slapstick consequences of leaving an 8-year-old boy &quot; Home Alone , &quot; has regressed to the diaper stage with a tale of a 6-month-old tot misplaced in a big city . * &quot; The Shadow &quot; ( July 1 ) -- The radio hero of the ' 30s comes_to_life , with Alec Baldwin ' s suave billionaire Lamont Cranston finding what evil lurks in the hearts of men . * &quot; True Lies &quot; ( July 15 ) -- Arnold Schwarzenegger and James Cameron , the team responsible_for &quot; Terminator , &quot; are back with more cinematic fireworks in this campy saga about a married_man who moonlights as a master spy , unbeknown to his wife . * &quot; The Mask &quot; ( July 29 ) -- If you thought rubber-faced Jim Carrey was a hoot in &quot; Ace Ventura , &quot; wait till you see him cavort in this FX-heavy comedy about a mild-mannered geek transformed into a super hero . * &quot; Airheads &quot; ( Aug . 3 ) -- Teen heartthrob Brendan Fraser is one of three dim-witted heavy-metal rockers who take a radio_station hostage to get their demo on the air . * &quot; The Next Karate Kid &quot; ( Aug . 5 ) -- The fourth installment of the series comes_with a twist : The kid is a girl . WORKING Where to Find a Job : Bagging fries , busing tables , baby-sitting your neighbor ' s obnoxious kid -- tough jobs , but somebody has to do them , and you ' re elected . Starting at the bottom is the curse of teen-hood . If you can ' t slide into a summer gig as vice_president of Daddy ' s company , you ' ll have to settle for a menial job . Once you accept that fact of life , finding work isn ' t very difficult . &quot; If a kid wants a job , it ' s pretty easy , &quot; says Ivan Carrasco at Youth Employment Services in Simi Valley . Youth Services has offices all_over the county . The Job Training Policy Council in Oxnard finds work for low-income kids . Since regular employment_agencies rarely deal with anyone under 18 , contacting Youth Services and the Job Council usually pays_off . &quot; Ninety-five percent of the time , you ' ll get a job , &quot; Carrasco says . If a fun work environment is important to you , you might apply to Six Flags Magic Mountain . Probably the largest employer of teens in the area , Magic Mountain hires 3 # 000 workers in the summer , &quot; the bulk of them young people , &quot; a spokesman says . You can run rides , stock merchandise , cook food , take tickets or get a foot in show_business by working tech at stage shows . &quot; We ' ve got positions open in every area of the park , &quot; the spokesman says . &quot; We ' re definitely in a big hiring mode . We ' ve got excellent , excellent opportunities for teens. &quot; Most summer jobs pay the minimum hourly wage of $ 4.25. At Six Flags , you can make as much as $ 5 . Youth Employment Services sometimes finds $ 8-an-hour jobs . Youth Employment Services * Camarillo -- 632 N . Las Posas Road , 482-0775 * Oxnard -- 126 E . 7th St. , 487-4043 * Thousand Oaks -- 80 E . Hillcrest Drive , 496-6868 * Simi Valley -- 3855 Alamo St. , 522-4473 * Ventura -- 1239 E .

How to Get Hired : Once you reach the interview stage , you ' ll have to decide if $ 4.25 an hour is enough incentive to make you smile , comb your hair , wash behind your ears and wear anything but blue_jeans . If you go_for it : &quot; Dress appropriately , &quot; advises Joyce Waldron , director of Youth Employment Services in Ventura . &quot; The right attitude always helps . And don ' t ever say you ' re not available. &quot; Job hunting entails a lot of paperwork . For a teen-ager , it starts with a work_permit . Required by the state if you ' re under 18 , a work_permit can be obtained at your high_school . It has to be filled_out and signed by you , your parents and your employer . Start Your Own Business : If you value independence and freedom , working for yourself is the way to go . &quot; It ' s really nice and enjoyable , &quot; says Kevin Corse , who owned his own gardening business as a Buena High student in the mid- ' 70s . &quot; It gives you an ego boost and you don ' t have anybody watching you. &quot; Mowing lawns , washing cars and windows , baby-sitting , selling cookies , cleaning homes , clearing brush , hauling trash and impersonating a handyman are some of the jobs you can do yourself and generally make your own hours . But they demand responsibility . &quot; You have to be where you say you ' ll be , &quot; Corse says . You also have to deliver the goods . Corse ' s gardening business was helped by word_of_mouth because &quot; I did a good job for this woman and she told her friends and family and it went_on from there , &quot; says Corse , who now owns a gas_station in Ventura . You have to remember to pay your own taxes and make_sure your employers pay Social_Security on you or they ' ll never be able to accept a position with the federal_government .

Just as important as what you say during an interview is what your body is saying about you , so be sure to conceal any tattoos that say : ' Work sucks , let ' s party. ' &quot; Strategies for Showing a Bad Report_Card to Your Parents : If leaving the country is not an option , Ventura family counselor Jan Baker suggests trying to use humor on Mom and Dad , softening them up with a joke ( a little self-deprecation is useful ) before handing them the card and begging for mercy . &quot; Start lighthearted but cut_to the chase , &quot; Baker says . &quot; You might as well be straight. &quot; Efforts to &quot; lose &quot; the card or have it mutilated in the wash don ' t work , Baker says . &quot; The grades will come_out anyway . You might as well face it by being direct with your parents. &quot; THINKING If you experience a moment of weakness and decide to exercise your brain on your vacation , you have several choices besides summer school .
