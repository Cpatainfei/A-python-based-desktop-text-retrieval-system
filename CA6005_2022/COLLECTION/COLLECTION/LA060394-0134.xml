   <TEXT> U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic named Tony Meola to start as goalkeeper in the team ' s opening World Cup soccer game on June 18 against Switzerland . Or did he ? During a news_conference Thursday at the Rose Bowl to introduce those who had made the team ' s final 22-man roster , Milutinovic preceded his remarks to the press with a short lecture to Meola , beginning , &quot; When you lead the team against Switzerland . . . . &quot; Afterward , when asked about it , Milutinovic was typically evasive , saying that he will not identify his 11 starters until an hour before the game . But team officials said that Milutinovic has decided that the No . 1 goalkeeper will be Meola , who started all three U.S. games in the 1990 World Cup . Meola , team captain , said he is not taking anything for granted in his competition with Brad Friedel for the position . &quot; that ' s the first thing I ' ve heard anything about it , too , &quot; he said of Milutinovic ' s remarks to him . &quot; I ' m still not sure if that was a yes or a no . I hope it was a yes. &quot; Meola will start Saturday at the Rose Bowl against Mexico in the United States ' final exhibition_game before the World Cup . RANDY HARVEY</TEXT>
