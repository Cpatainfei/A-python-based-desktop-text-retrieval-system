   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; ROUGH RIDE FOR EASTERN GERMANY ' S COMMUTERS ; EACH DAY , MANY DRIVE HUNDREDS OF MILES TO THE WEST , WHERE THE JOBS ARE . THEY SAY THEY ARE TRAPPED IN THE BRUTAL REGIMEN BY A TWO-TIERED SOCIETY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the alarm_clock explodes at 6 a.m. , Karsten Brunschkewitz hasn ' t a moment to spare . The single father of two works_on the docks in Hamburg , in what used to be West Germany -- normally a two-hour drive from Suckow , in what used to be East_Germany . The slightest delay , the least foul-up on the autobahn , and his 12-hour workday , door to door , can stretch to 13 hours or more . Brunschkewitz won ' t risk it . He jumps_out of bed , washes , boils some coffee , throws on shorts and a tank_top , eats a breakfast of boiled eggs and last night ' s salad , and goes downstairs to his maroon Volkswagen Golf in the driveway . For most of his 34 years , Brunschkewitz could only dream about crossing to the West . The border , marked with watchtowers , barbed wire and anti-vehicle trenches , cut rudely across the lush cropland 50 miles west of his village . Getting a passport was all but impossible . Today , not only can Brunschkewitz drive from east to west any time he wants -- he has to do_it , five mornings a week , if he wants a job . He is a pendler , one of hundreds of thousands of eastern German commuters who travel tremendous distances each day to the old West , just to find work . &quot; My minimum daily driving time is three hours , &quot; says Brunschkewitz , who typically crosses the old Death Strip at 100 m.p.h. , trying to cut the 100-mile trip to a life-risking hour and a half . &quot; Once , it took me five hours just to get home. &quot; ( Eastern German highways are two lanes each way , so a single accident or construction project -- and there are plenty of each -- can bring one side to a standstill. ) Of all_of the changes to beset eastern Germany since the collapse of the old order in 1989 , one of the most poignant has been the rise of the long-haul commuter . Many , like Brunschkewitz , see their children for as little as half an hour a day . Many chance grievous harm in tinny eastern cars on the hair-raising autobahns , which have no speed_limits and where 9 # 000 accidents occur each year . &quot; For an American , this must be unbelievable , &quot; says Karin Bredemeyer , a Deutsche Bank economist . &quot; You would just move to where the jobs are , would n ' t you ? But it ' s a different mentality in Germany . People like to keep to the same place. &quot; In the summer of 1992 , the most recent period for which official statistics are available , 370 # 000 former East_Germans were venturing -- exhausted -- back and forth to jobs in the former West . Some traveled aboard company-supplied buses ; others , like Brunschkewitz , in car pools . Here in the northern state of Mecklenburg Vorpommern , about 37 # 000 people commute to the former West each day -- one of every 23 working adults in the region . &quot; It ' s a terrible strain , &quot; says Anke Thiesler , a onetime secretary in the eastern city of Schwerin who became a long-haul commuter in 1990 . Her workday ran from 10 a.m. until after midnight ; she finally quit , badly worn down . Now Thiesler works in a Schwerin dress_shop by day and moonlights as a cleaning woman , just to get_by . &quot; At least now I ' m home by 8 or 9 p.m. , &quot; she says . &quot; If someone had told me before the Wende -- the ' Great Change ' -- that I ' d one day have to commute such a long way , I ' d never have believed them . It was a shock. &quot; All over the world , people from impoverished countries have long traveled great cross-border distances to improve their circumstances . And in Southern California , some commuters log two hours a day or more . Former East_Germans submit to brutal commuting regimens because they must -- even though the notion of free evenings and weekends with one ' s family is nothing short of sacred . Chancellor Helmut Kohl promised easterners in 1990 that after unification , &quot; nobody will be worse off and for many , life will be better. &quot; But instead , many easterners believe that they are caught in a two-tiered society in which westerners get all_the breaks and easterners are second-class citizens . Long-haul commuting , for them , is just one example . There is an appalling lack of jobs in the onetime German Democratic Republic . The official unemployment_rate in the six states that used to make_up East_Germany is about 15 % , and economists say that if those in make-work programs or those who have given_up looking_for a job are added in , the effective rate is about 30 % . The comparable figure in the former West is 8 % . Another factor is a general reluctance to pull_up stakes and move_on when opportunities look better elsewhere . &quot; There are two reasons the Germans don ' t move much , &quot; says Detlef Guertler , a journalist with the Berlin newspaper Wochenpost . &quot; One is that it ' s terribly hard to find a new apartment in Germany . And the other is something called heimat . It means home , but it also means more_than that -- it ' s a kind of atmosphere , the place where your friends live , where your parents live . A lot of people don ' t want to leave their heimat . &quot; A final motivating force is the gap between wages in the east and the west , even now , nearly five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall . According to a study in the eastern state of Brandenburg , 44 % of long-haul commuters there make about $ 1 # 600 per month , while 16 % of the non-commuting work_force earns as much . Across Germany , in many sectors of the economy , unions have negotiated two-tiered pay structures , with one rate for easterners and another for westerners doing the same jobs . Eastern wages have lagged , in_general , because easterners are still perceived as less productive than westerners , and because eastern living costs , while rising sharply , are still thought to be lower . &quot; They can get_away with paying us less because their economic models show that eastern prices are lower , &quot; Brunschkewitz says . &quot; But forget it -- it ' s not true . The only thing that ' s cheaper in the east , at the moment , is the gasoline. &quot; The Brandenburg study also found that long-haul commuters are , from a managerial point_of_view , the cream of the labor crop -- the people who could most effectively rebuild the former East if they could stay home and do so . Long-haul commuters tend to be young -- 35 on average -- and single or , if married , with at most one or two children . They are_well educated , and they tend to take a long view , willing to accept lower wages for a chance at long-term economic opportunity . &quot; It ' s one of the biggest problems in the reunification process , &quot; Guertler says . &quot; The better salaries in the west attract the best workers from the east , and that leaves the people who are less able and less successful in the east. &quot; All of which makes Brunschkewitz a textbook example . At 34 , the divorced father of sons who are 10 and 12 , he is a seasoned heavy-equipment operator and mechanic . Before the East_German state came undone , he worked in road_construction , earning what he calls &quot; an above-average wage. &quot; After reunification , the government paid him $ 3.60 an hour for road work . Western road workers , he says , made $ 10 an hour . That was when he heard that Barthels &amp; Lueders , a subsidiary of the giant Blohm &amp; Voss shipyard in Hamburg , where the Elbe_River flows into the North_Sea , had a truck-repair department . A fellow easterner had recently gone_to work there , and he was looking_for car-pool partners . Brunschkewitz rushed to apply for a job and has been car-pooling ever since . At exactly 7 a.m. , Brunschkewitz pulls_out of the driveway of his small family farm . It ' s quiet except for a_few storks in the trees ; Suckow is a village of just two houses , and no one at the neighboring farm is awake yet . He heads_up a low hill to a poured-concrete apartment_building , where 27-year-old Thoralf Richert is waiting . Richert is also a father of two and a mechanic . He once repaired farm equipment . Today he also fixes trucks . He has come equipped for the long drive with newspapers and a computer_game . &quot; You can get used to commuting , but it ' s better to do_it with three people , and not alone , &quot; Brunschkewitz says . &quot; It ' s less boring and you can save money on gasoline. &quot; He crosses an overpass , pulls onto the highway and accelerates to a neat 95 m.p.h. , standard commuting speed on the autobahn . The tires thud alarmingly on the rough pavement . The speed_limit in the former East is 80 m.p.h. , but many easterners drive as if they were_on the better western highways . Commuting by autobahn can be a breathtaking experience -- at least when the traffic is moving . Today it isn ' t . After a half-hour , Brunschkewitz slams_on the brakes . Traffic has stopped , and a line of trucks and cars stretches up a hill out_of_sight . People have turned_off their engines and are pacing the hot asphalt . Brunschkewitz curses . He and Richert are supposed to work a nine-hour shift ; if they come late , the company will dock their pay . He walks up the road and comes_back to report a big accident up ahead . Accidents in the former East can block highways for hours . There is no choice but to sit until the tow trucks come . &quot; Maybe we ' ll have to work overtime , &quot; Richert says . &quot; It ' s already so late when we get home_in the evenings , &quot; Brunschkewitz says . &quot; It used to be better , because there was an early shift . We worked only seven hours , and we could still be home by 5 . Now we come_in a little later , we work a longer shift , and we don ' t get home until at least 8. &quot; His children go_to_bed at 8:30 . Mercifully , the tow trucks come quickly . The accident is cleared , and at precisely 9 Brunschkewitz is peeling into the Barthels &amp; Lueders parking_lot . He and Richert hurry inside , change into long pants and blue work aprons and punch_in . They are right on_time . Three floors above , in sunny executive offices , Barthels &amp; Lueders CEO Rainer Volckmann reflects on the situation . &quot; Why do they commute ? &quot; he asks jovially . &quot; that ' s easy -- they need the money . They are a lot luckier than the people who don ' t have the chance to drive these great distances . A lot of people are out_of_work in the former East. &quot; In the beginning , when he started hiring easterners , Volckmann says , he sensed a cultural gap between them and the western mechanics . &quot; They spoke the same language , but there were different ideas in their minds , &quot; he says . &quot; Work hours , for instance . In the German Democratic Republic , it wasn ' t really necessary to work all day . They got paid no matter what . Here , they have to worry about it. &quot; But all that is behind them , Volckmann says . &quot; Today , you can see no difference between them . And there is no difference in pay. &quot; The Barthels &amp; Lueders bargaining group , which mediates between management and the work_force , forbids that , he says . Across Germany , economists are at_a_loss to estimate how long it may be before the eastern unemployment_rate approaches the western one -- if ever . The eastern economy , which hit bottom in 1992 and 1993 , is showing signs of growth . Privatization of the old eastern industrial stock is supposed to be finished by year ' s end , and the government is extending its programs of subsidies and tax_breaks for investors willing to take a plunge into the old East . But none of these signs spell much relief for the unemployed . &quot; There are high labor costs in eastern Germany , and it ' s hard to lay people off , &quot; says Bredemeyer , the Deutsche Bank economist . &quot; So investors think_about capital investment , and not about employment . They try to hire the least number of people possible . I don ' t think we ' ll ever see complete equalization of unemployment. &quot; It ' s 10 before 6 . Brunschkewitz leaves the shop_floor , changes into his shorts , punches the clock , heads to the car . He and Richert ride the stoplights east through a charmless landscape of rail yards , cranes , fuel tanks and power_lines . Brunschkewitz will have dinner to cook when he gets home , he says . Then he will drive to a friend ' s house to help plaster walls . At 7:45 , he drops_off Richert , then heads to his farm . His sons and his mother are waiting . It hasn ' t been a bad day : just 12 hours and 45 minutes , door to door . The boys follow Brunschkewitz upstairs to the kitchen and wait while he boils coffee . His mother , Vera , an unemployed biology teacher , offers her thoughts on the plight of the east : &quot; There ' s not going_to be any jobs for anybody around here for the next generation , &quot; she predicts . A firm socialist even now , she says unhesitatingly that she thinks the family was better_off in the old days . Her husband used to work_on a farming collective ; now he is jobless . Her lathe-operator daughter may never work again . She sees her grandsons ' schoolmates running wild , their parents turning_to alcohol , marriages failing . &quot; We have to have more solidarity , &quot; she says . &quot; We have to treat each other better . And we need reindustrialization , to provide jobs and rebuild some pride for the people around here. &quot; Her son sees things differently : He has a job , no matter how stressful it may be , and so he feels better_off than before . &quot; But it ' s just a job , &quot; he adds . &quot; If I could find anything else , I ' d take it . I ' ve applied to other places right here near Suckow , and they liked me , but no one around here is hiring right now. &quot; He knows , he adds , that Barthels &amp; Lueders wants to get_out of the truck-repair business and may close his department this year . Then he too will join the ranks of the eastern unemployed . &quot; If that happens , then I ' ll look_for a new job , &quot; he says . &quot; Maybe something in agriculture . But whatever I find , it will definitely be here in the area . I never want to drive so far again. &quot; Next : Westerners move east .</TEXT>
