   <TEXT> Eight days after suffering a concussion at New Orleans , quarterback Chris Miller still complains of headaches and &quot; isn ' t clear about everything. &quot; But Miller would n ' t rule himself out from starting Sunday against Denver , and Coach Chuck Knox would n ' t commit to starting Miller or Chris Chandler . Chandler appears to have the inside_track on the starting job , with Tommy Maddox backing him up . Chandler took most of the snaps in practice Monday . &quot; I would say right now that Chandler is the starter because he is getting all_the work , &quot; Knox said . &quot; I don ' t know what the situation would be Wednesday . Our doctors are monitoring Miller ' s progress , and we ' ll go from there. &quot; Miller plans to throw_in informal workouts today and return to practice Wednesday . &quot; I ' m sure I could play , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' ll be the doctor ' s call to see how I react to practice and putting a helmet on . I ' m just going day-to-day right now . I rode the exercise_bike hard and I just feel my equilibrium is a little out of whack. &quot; Miller got the concussion when the back of his head hit the turf when he was tackled by New Orleans ' Ernest Dixon in the first_quarter . He didn ' t know he had a concussion and played the rest of the first_half , throwing a touchdown pass to Isaac Bruce . He complained of dizziness at halftime , and was replaced by Chandler at the start of the second_half . Miller said he doesn ' t remember any of the second_half of the game . A CAT scan and MRI exam showed no brain damage , but team doctors held Miller out of workouts during the bye week for precautionary reasons . * Steve Novak , general counsel with the Rams for the past six seasons , will leave the team at the end of the week to become counsel for Fox network . . . . Right tackle Darryl Ashmore , who returned last week from a knee injury , worked_at right guard , backing_up starter Leo Goeas . Rookie Wayne Gandy continued to work with the first string at right tackle , with veteran Jackie Slater , back from a torn triceps muscle , as the backup . . . .
