   <HEADLINE> STATE AIDE SAYS BLACKMUN SHOULD REMOVE SELF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The man who will defend California ' s death_penalty law in the Supreme Court this week said in an interview that Justice Harry A . Blackmun had violated his oath of office by announcing his conclusion in_advance . Deputy Atty . Gen . William G . Prahl said Blackmun , 85 , should remove himself from the case . Blackmun announced on Feb . 22 that he would vote to reverse every death sentence that came_before the high_court on grounds that state procedures in capital cases were &quot; fraught with arbitrariness. &quot; &quot; From this day forward , I no longer shall tinker with the machinery of death , &quot; he said . Prahl said in a telephone_interview : &quot; If this were any other issue , there would be elements calling_for his impeachment . He has prejudged the case based on his personal feelings . . . and announced in_advance how he is going_to vote , regardless of the facts or the law . &quot; I think it raises a good question : Why is he sitting on this case ? If this turns_out to be a 5-4 vote ( against the state ) , the state of California didn ' t get a fair hearing. &quot; Blackmun has precedent for deciding in_advance to oppose the death_penalty without regard for particular circumstances . Former Justices William J . Brennan and Thurgood Marshall believed the death_penalty was unconstitutional because it was &quot; cruel_and_unusual_punishment &quot; banned by the Eighth Amendment . Prahl , noting that Blackmun , Brennan and Marshall had been the court ' s three oldest justices until Brennan and Marshall retired , said : &quot; Supreme Court justices don ' t age well on the death_penalty . They lose their fortitude for enforcing criminal law. &quot; DAVID G . SAVAGE</TEXT>
