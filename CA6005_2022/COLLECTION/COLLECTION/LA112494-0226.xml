   <HEADLINE> NEW WHOOPING COUGH VACCINE SAFER , STUDY SAYS ; HEALTH : IT IS JUST AS EFFECTIVE AT PREVENTING ILLNESS AND CAUSES FAR FEWER SIDE_EFFECTS THAN THE CURRENT TREATMENT , A MAJOR CLINICAL TRIAL IN SWEDEN FINDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A new whooping_cough vaccine has been shown to be effective and much safer than existing vaccines in a major clinical trial in Sweden , the National Institutes of Health said Tuesday . The currently used vaccine for whooping_cough , formally known as pertussis , is part of the DPT vaccine routinely given to American children beginning at the age of 2 months . Although it is effective in preventing pertussis , there have been persistent reports that the current vaccine causes neurological damage in some children . Some countries , including Great Britain , Japan and Sweden have discontinued its use , and many parents refuse to allow their children to receive it . In the trial , the new vaccine was given to 1 # 692 Swedish infants in three doses , at the ages of 3 months , 5 months and 12 months . The vaccine was about 71 % effective in preventing pertussis , compared to about 80 % for the current vaccine . Perhaps more important , the incidence of side_effects , both mild and serious , was far below that reported with the current vaccine , said Dr. John Taranger of the University of Goteborg , who led the study . &quot; We really need to get a vaccine that has fewer side_effects , and this seems to be a perfect solution to our problem , &quot; said Dr. Lawrence Pickering , a pediatrician at the Center for Pediatric Research in Norfolk , Va . Sharon Mates , president of North_American Vaccine Inc. , which manufactures the new vaccine , said the company plans to apply to the Food and Drug Administration early next year for marketing approval . The pertussis vaccine has been used in the United States since the 1940s , commonly as part of the DPT vaccine , which also protects against diphtheria and tetanus . Children usually get the vaccine in a five-dose series , beginning at age 2 months and continuing at 4 , 6 and 18 months , with a final dose between 4 and 6 years . The current pertussis vaccine is called a whole-cell vaccine because it is made of killed pertussis bacteria . It contains not only a broad mix of cellular components of the bacteria , but also two different toxins that are produced by the microorganism . The pertussis endotoxin is thought responsible_for the pain and fever associated with the vaccine , while the pertussis toxin -- which causes most of the symptoms of whooping_cough -- is assumed to cause the more severe side_effects . Reactions to the vaccine usually occur within 48 hours and may include high fever ( one out of 100 immunizations ) , persistent crying ( one out of 100 ) , seizures ( one out of 1 # 750 ) and collapse episodes with limpness and lack of responsiveness ( one out of 1 # 750 ) . Most side_effects are reversible , but there have been persistent reports of permanent brain damage caused by the vaccine . Since the $ 80-million National Vaccine Injury Compensation program was established in 1988 , 4 # 604 pertussis claims have been filed , according to the federal program ' s records . Because of their fears , many parents have refused to allow their children to receive DPT , leading to an increase in the incidence of the serious , sometimes fatal respiratory_disorder . About 4 # 000 cases of pertussis occur each year in the United States . In an effort to prevent these side_effects , several groups of researchers have developed so-called acellular vaccines , which contain a mixture of proteins from cell_walls of the bacteria . An acellular vaccine has been used successfully in Japan for several years and is approved in the United States for the fourth and fifth doses in the vaccination series . But the FDA has said that not enough evidence of safety and efficacy exists to justify using it in younger children , Pickering said . The vaccine tested in Sweden is unique because instead of cell-wall proteins , it contains a modified form of the pertussis toxin . It was developed by molecular biologists Ron Sekura and John Robbins of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , who reasoned that a single protein would produce fewer side_effects . In addition to the vaccine , a placebo containing only the tetanus and diphtheria vaccines was given to 1 # 687 other infants in the double-blind Swedish study . The children were monitored for an average of 20 months after the third shot by a team of public health nurses who evaluated all coughing episodes . The use of a placebo was possible because most Swedish children do not receive a pertussis vaccine of any sort , despite an epidemic in that country . During the trial , 240 of the children receiving the placebo developed pertussis , compared to only 72 who received the new vaccine . Although that is lower than the 80 % efficacy of the current vaccine , said child health institute spokeswoman Michaela Richardson , the whole-cell vaccine has never been tested during an epidemic . The actual efficacies are probably about the same , she added .
