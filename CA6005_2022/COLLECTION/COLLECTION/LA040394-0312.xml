   <HEADLINE> BOMB IN TURKISH BAZAAR KILLS 2 TOURISTS ; 15 PEOPLE INJURED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A bomb planted in a shoeshine box by suspected Kurdish separatists exploded in Istanbul ' s Covered Bazaar on Saturday , killing two tourists and injuring at least 15 people . Security officials said at least eight foreign tourists were among the injured . Some of the 15 were in critical condition . The Anatolian news_agency identified the dead as Munira Najan , 40 , a Tunisian woman , and Javier Castro , a Spanish man . It said Najan ' s 17-year-old son , Mehdi , four Spaniards , two Frenchmen and a Lebanese man were wounded . It was the second bombing of the popular tourist site in 10 days . Four people were injured in a blast March 24 and three tourists were wounded when a bomb went_off in the garden of St . Sophia , a 6th-Century Byzantine basilica , on March 27 . Police said that no one had claimed responsibility for Saturday ' s explosion but that they suspected the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party ( PKK ) . If that suspicion is borne_out , the tourists would be the first foreign victims of the PKK ' s separatist war since it was launched in 1984 . In Madrid , a Spanish Foreign Ministry spokesman confirmed that a Spaniard was killed . The four injured Spaniards were believed to be out_of_danger , he said , quoting the Spanish consul . Witnesses said the bomb had been planted in a shoeshine box_in front of a jewelry shop and exploded at 10:30 a.m. , shattering windows and smashing furniture in nearby shops . &quot; I threw myself out of my shop after the blast and saw two people lying on the ground . The legs of one of the victims appeared severed . I thought both were dead , &quot; a young assistant at a carpet shop told Reuters TV_reporter Kemal Gokakin . Witnesses said they had seen an unfamiliar boy for several minutes before the blast standing in front of the shop next to the shoeshine box . Yildirim Aktuna , state minister and government spokesman , visited the site and condemned the bombing . &quot; This was a cowardly , sneaky attack , &quot; he told reporters . Aktuna said additional measures would be taken_to safeguard tourist attractions and crowded sites . With more_than 4 # 000 shops , the 15th-Century Covered Bazaar is one of Turkey ' s leading tourist attractions . * In an interview with an Athens daily published Thursday , the PKK ' s political wing said the outlawed group would launch a warlike campaign against tourist targets in Turkey this year . &quot; Last year ' s campaign against Turkish tourism was just a warning . The real campaign begins this year and it will be like war , &quot; Hassan Dag of the National Liberation Front of Kurdistan said . &quot; The attacks against tourist targets are part of our war action and it is logical that there will be human victims , &quot; he said . &quot; What we want is to stop tourist money from entering Turkey . This money is used to massacre our people. &quot;</TEXT>
