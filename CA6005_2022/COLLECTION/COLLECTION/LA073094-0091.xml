   <HEADLINE> EUROPE ; PARTY ' S ADS FAIL TO SOCK IT TO ' EM ; CONTROVERSIAL ANTI-LEFTIST CAMPAIGN BY GERMANY ' S RULING CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS DRAWS FIRE FROM WITHIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Cold_War , it turns_out , is not entirely over . After parading with President Clinton through Brandenburg Gate to celebrate the end of communism , German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has revived its specter to slap his main opponents in federal elections this fall . Kohl ' s Christian Democratic Union launched a new ad_campaign last week accusing the Social Democrats of making a pact with the_devil by forming a minority government in the eastern state of Saxony-Anhalt with the leftist Greens and help from former Communists . The chancellor set the tone for the final months of his reelection campaign by charging that the Social Democratic Party &quot; broke_with the decades-old consensus of all democrats in Germany not to work together with extremists on the left or the right. &quot; One of his party ' s new posters revives Cold_War rhetoric to warn of a &quot; leftist front &quot; on the national level . Another billboard shows a red sock hanging_on a clothesline and says : &quot; Off into the future . . . but not in red socks. &quot; The sock ads have been controversial among conservatives in Kohl ' s own party -- not because they seem outmoded , but because they seem to easterners in particular to make light of a perceived &quot; red &quot; threat . Social Democratic leader Rudolf Scharping is not exactly out defending his party ' s tacit alliance with the Party of Democratic Socialism -- the reformed East_German Communist_Party . Playing to voters who fear communism , Scharping denied plans to come_to national power with such a coalition , and his party accused the Christian Democrats of having made their own pact with the Communist devil . Social Democratic campaign manager Guenter Verheugen said a majority of eastern Christian Democratic members_of_Parliament came from the old East_German Christian Democrats , a puppet party of the former East_German government . The former Communists , meanwhile , are enjoying the brouhaha that has given them considerable free advertising and fueled their hopes of winning seats in the federal Parliament . The Saxony-Anhalt vote was a surprise to all parties and presents another scenario -- unlikely but not impossible -- for the formation of a new federal_government after the Oct . 16 election . The Christian Democrats won the most votes , but their partners in the governing coalition , the liberal Free Democratic Party , did not win enough to return to the state legislature , leaving the Christian Democrats without a majority to elect a state premier . After much negotiation , the Social Democrats agreed to join forces with the Greens , who in several state votes now have become the third political force . It was a risky decision for the Social Democrats , who fear losing centrist voters throughout the country , but they managed to stave_off a &quot; grand coalition &quot; with the Christian Democrats . The former Communists won a stunning 20 % of the state vote , presumably among easterners disillusioned with the high cost of capitalism . Seven members of the Party of Democratic Socialism voted for the Social Democratic premier , Reinhard Hoeppner , and the others abstained . Hoeppner will need the party ' s support to pass laws . A day after losing the state , the Christian Democrats put_out their &quot; red &quot; ads . They represent a change in strategy for Kohl , who has been leading in opinion polls with a campaign based on his experience as a statesman and on upbeat economic predictions . Perhaps Kohl wishes he had stuck_to the old strategy . Party chiefs in all five eastern states have announced they will not be using the sock ads .</TEXT>
