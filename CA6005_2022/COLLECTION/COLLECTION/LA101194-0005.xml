   <HEADLINE> CLINTON SAID ' NO , ' AND SADDAM BLINKED ; AN ADMIRABLE SHOW OF FIRMNESS BY THE ADMINISTRATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Challenged by Iraq ' s menacing military moves toward Kuwait , the Clinton_Administration responded with a resoluteness and decisiveness in both word and deed that do_it credit . There has been no ambiguity , no wavering or evidence of internal differences in its public statements , beginning with the President ' s at last Friday ' s press_conference . Neither was there any hesitancy in_ordering to the Persian_Gulf area the troops , planes and ships that would be needed to oppose any new Iraqi aggression . Clinton and his aides immediately and clearly saw what had to be done . Their judgment was sound , their actions effective . &quot; We will not allow Saddam Hussein to defy the will of the United States and the international community , &quot; the President said Monday night . In the face of that determination , Hussein apparently has chosen to pull his troops back from the demilitarized zone between Iraq and Kuwait . However , Nizar Hamdoon , Iraq ' s ambassador to the United Nations , accompanied his announcement signaling this retreat with an affirmation of sovereignty that , in the circumstances , has to be prudently seen as something more_than routine diplomatic boilerplate . &quot; We reserve the right to move them ( the troops ) any time in the future to wherever we want within Iraqi territory. &quot; In other words , the army in southern Iraq could again be put_on the road south if Hussein should again conclude that he has something to gain by demonstrating his continuing ability to make trouble . The crisis , for now , appears to have been suspended . But the implicit threat that it could be renewed at any time hangs_in the air . That could mean that American forces in some numbers will have to remain on and around the Arabian_Peninsula for a while to come . It could also mean , as Defense_Secretary William J . Perry has suggested , that at some point U.S. forces would simply act to defang Hussein ' s army in southern Iraq , rather than settling in_for an extended stay along the border . It ' s both expensive and morale-eroding to keep highly trained forces on indefinite alert far from home . What Perry was pointedly implying is that Washington doesn ' t intend to let Baghdad dictate the terms of the U.S. deployment . Searching for rational_motives in Saddam Hussein ' s behavior has always been something of a fool ' s errand . As Gertrude Stein remarked in another context , there ' s no there there . He is a master of self-deluding miscalculations , as his enormously costly invasion of Iran in 1980 and his brutal attempt to annex Kuwait a decade later show . A sense of subtlety is alien to his conduct of international relations . The consensus is that he hoped by this latest example of belligerent posturing to influence the U.N. Security_Council to ease the economic sanctions against his country . He especially wants to begin selling oil to earn hard currency . Until a_few days ago Russia , France and China , all permanent members of the council , were sympathetic , Russia because Iraq owes it more_than $ 6 billion , France because it sees considerable commercial opportunities once the sanctions are lifted . The U.S. and British view is that the sanctions should stay because Iraq is still a long way from proving its readiness to comply with U.N. resolutions and abide_by the tenets of international_law . Its behavior over the last week has left no doubt about that .</TEXT>
