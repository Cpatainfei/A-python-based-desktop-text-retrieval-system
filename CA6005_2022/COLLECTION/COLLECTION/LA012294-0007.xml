   <HEADLINE> STITCHING TOGETHER A DISASTER SAFETY NET ; CONGRESS SHOULD NOW GIVE SERIOUS ATTENTION TO MAKING EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE MANDATORY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The time has come for Congress to take a hard look_at making earthquake insurance mandatory for all homes , apartment_houses and commercial buildings in California . The goal would be a minimum level of coverage , with a reasonable deductible , for all property_owners exposed to such destructive events as last Monday ' s Northridge earthquake . The full scope of the damage produced by that magnitude 6.6 shaker and its aftershocks can ' t yet be calculated . What is already clear is that only a fairly small percentage of property_owners carried earthquake insurance . Most of those probably suffered damage below the point where their insurance would begin to cover loss . Beyond the minimum level of insurance more extensive coverage ought to be available for those willing to pay higher premiums . The essential need is to make the insurance mandatory , just as mortgage lenders require homeowners to carry insurance against fire and similar non-seismic calamities . The point of insurance is to spread the risk . Limited-coverage mandatory earthquake insurance would do that . We focus_on earthquakes because they are of most immediate concern . But Congress should also consider mandating a general form of disaster insurance for the nation ' s property_owners , one that would also help offset losses from such other brutally destructive events as hurricanes and floods . Again , the broader the required coverage the wider the risk could be spread . For better or worse , government -- the federal_government especially , but in some cases state_governments as well -- has come_to be looked_on by many as the most important provider of relief following a natural disaster . Governments of course have a major and even , initially , a primary humanitarian role in the wake of disasters . But government simply doesn ' t have the resources to compensate for disaster-produced property losses . Disaster insurance , paid_for as all other insurance is paid_for , seems to be the best approach . The idea isn ' t new . Each fresh natural disaster revives interest in it , but as the memory of the catastrophe fades so does interest in insuring against future such events . Experience has shown that making earthquake and other disaster insurance available on a voluntary basis produces only limited participation . But disasters don ' t discriminate between those who have insurance and those who don ' t . that ' s why Congress should now give serious attention to making such insurance mandatory .</TEXT>
