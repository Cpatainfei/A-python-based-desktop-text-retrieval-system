   <HEADLINE> IS PARTITION THE ONLY WAY ? ; WHY CHRISTOPHER SEEKS TO HELP CREATE A BINATIONAL BOSNIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Bosnian peace plan urged by the European Union and the United Nations has functioned for months as a self-fulfilling prophecy . What the great_powers seemed to regard_as inevitable -- namely the tripartite , ethnic division of the Bosnian state -- Bosnia ' s Croats and Muslims , whose relations had initially been peaceful , also began to regard_as inevitable . The two groups turned_on each other , determined to acquire as much territory as possible going into the partition negotiations . The Clinton_Administration , while continuing to pay lip_service to the partition plan , is now clearly trying to make the prevailing wind blow in the other direction . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher is pushing Bosnia ' s Muslim-dominated government and its Croatian minority to form a unified binational Bosnian state within still-to-be-determined though surely reduced borders . The Muslim siege of Croatian Vitez in central Bosnia and the Croatian siege of the Muslim district of Mostar in southwestern Bosnia seem to mock Christopher ' s new approach , but a Croatian-Muslim cease-fire has been announced for noon today , and unification talks begin in Washington this weekend . A binational rather than tri-national Bosnia in federation with Croatia would give Bosnia the outlet to the sea it needs while providing Croatia with inland protection for its slender but lucrative Dalmatian coast . The newly proclaimed cease-fire is not backed by the threat of NATO reprisals for cease-fire violations , but some observers see a continuing spillover from the Sarajevo ultimatum . Christopher has some leverage on both sides in the coming negotiations . The threat of U.N. economic sanctions worries the Croats . The Muslims know that it would probably fall to the Americans in any future peacekeeping force to protect them . Whatever this leverage yields this weekend , the Administration deserves credit for finding its way , however haltingly and belatedly , to a Bosnian intervention that honors ethnic mixing and the secular state .</TEXT>
