   <TEXT> As a top official revealed that Orange County ' s investment loss had reached at least $ 2 billion , county leaders said for the first time Saturday that the financial debacle could mean layoffs , shortened workweeks and salary reductions for county employees . Members of the County Board of Supervisors said they expect to delay dozens of major projects , including the widening of the Santa Ana Freeway through Anaheim and a massive overhaul of the county ' s police communications_system , as they concentrate_on paying bills . &quot; Business is not as usual , that ' s the heartbreak , &quot; said Supervisor Harriett M . Wieder . &quot; We ' re not going_to be the same for a long while . It ' s scary . It ' s tragic . Absolutely tragic. &quot; County officials were working_through the weekend to further analyze the damage and help reassure a nervous financial world that the county , the largest U.S. municipality to declare bankruptcy , would pull itself out of its monetary crisis . In other developments : * County Supervisor William G . Steiner said he has been told that the losses have reached at least $ 2 billion in value -- providing the first county confirmation that the losses have worsened . That amounts to 25 % of what investors put_in the fund . Previously , the losses were estimated at $ 1.5 billion , or 20 % of investors ' capital . * County officials continued to push bankers and state and federal authorities for immediate help , seeking lines_of_credit from Bank of America and other financial_institutions . * Gov . Pete Wilson said the state may be able to advance the county its normal allowance of next year ' s tax money , but probably will not get more involved . &quot; I am deliberately not raising anybody ' s expectations because I think there is a very limited role that the state can play , &quot; Wilson said . * County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider removed 22 spending items from this Tuesday ' s meeting agenda , from youth programs and public works projects to such minor matters as repairing a barbed wire fence at a wilderness park . And the situation could get_worse . Another top county official said there was talk Saturday of salary cuts and reduced work hours for the county . &quot; The worst-case scenario would be layoffs , &quot; Schneider said . * State Sen . Tom Hayden ( D-Santa Monica ) proposed &quot; serious reforms &quot; to regulate the relationships between financial brokers and those who invest taxpayer money . He called_for strong prohibitions on gifts and campaign contributions from financial firms to public officials who invest public money . In Sacramento , former state_Treasurer Tom Hayes -- the county ' s new financial adviser -- made the rounds of state leaders seeking financial help . In Santa Ana , county officials worked with Salomon Bros. , the county ' s financial strategist , to consider various budget-slashing scenarios . The county has had partial success in getting money from outside sources . Bank Picks Up Debt for Notes The Industrial Bank_of_Japan picked_up the debt last week for $ 78 million worth of notes issued by the Orange County Transportation Authority and has agreed to pick_up $ 100 million more of the agency ' s notes that come due in January , Steiner said . Bank of America officials also are considering a line_of_credit to Orange County . Steiner said any money that comes from state and federal_officials in the form of sales tax_revenue and federal highway funds would not be a handout . &quot; This would not be a loan , &quot; he said . &quot; This would help us get some funds early to help with our liquidity. &quot; Also Saturday , trustees of the Anaheim Union High_School District held a special meeting and directed Orange County officials to keep their property_tax funds separate from the county investment pool . Previously , a portion of those funds had automatically gone_into the pool . The trustees followed the lead of several other school_boards that have petitioned the county to do the same . Within just a_few days last week , Orange County , one of the richest areas of the world , saw its treasurer-tax collector of 24 years resign and the next day filed for bankruptcy protection after it defaulted_on a $ 1.2 billion loan . That action triggered a Wall_Street investment brokerage to sell_off $ 2 billion in securities that it had held as collateral for the county ' s loan . In the days after the bankruptcy filing , nervous brokerages dumped $ 11.4 billion in securities onto the market . What the investment_firms were paid_for those securities will determine how much is left of the $ 7.8 billion county investment fund , which had been leveraged to nearly three times its value . Steiner said Saturday that he believes the portfolio , which includes the investments of more_than 185 school districts , cities and other agencies , has lost $ 2 billion in value so far . &quot; The pool participants need to know what ' s left in the fund and what can be released , &quot; he said . Steiner said that eventually he will seek to have the county ' s investments removed from the county treasurer ' s responsibility and managed by a private financial manager accountable to the Board of Supervisors . Wieder said she felt some relief at hiring Hayes and Salomon Bros . &quot; I said to the county counsel , ' I feel as though I can see the light at the end of this tunnel , ' &quot; Wieder recalled . &quot; And he said , ' No , it ' s just like coming_down on an elevator from the 100th floor -- we ' ve just passed the 95th. ' &quot; Wieder said it is impossible to approve any new expenditures in today ' s financial light . &quot; How can we talk_about spending_money when we don ' t know what we have ? &quot; she asked . &quot; Once we find that out , we ' re going to have to set the priorities on who gets paid. &quot; Local Businesses Show Support In recent days , Wieder said , she has seen a huge outpouring of support by the local business_community . Before Salomon Bros . joined the effort , she said , Pacific Investments offered free financial advice . Local accountants also have offered to give her briefings on securities trading so she can better understand the investment portfolio , she said . Supervisors said it is almost certain that some spending , such_as land purchases for widening Interstate 5 , a bond sale for the $ 94 million emergency communications_system and the hiring of new deputies to staff the Theo Lacy Branch Jail in Orange , will be postponed indefinitely . Stan Oftelie , head of the Orange County Transportation Authority , said its board of directors will vote Monday on a 100-day operating plan to keep the agency going . &quot; It ' s a plan to stabilize all_of our activities , and this involves contracts , vendors , professional services , cash flow , payroll and everything else , &quot; Oftelie said . There are no plans to curtail bus_service , he added . One expected casualty is a private toll road that was to be built down the middle of the Santa Ana River and is still being designed . Most of the construction was to be funded through the sale of bonds to private investors , but the transportation authority has agreed to contribute $ 12 million for an environmental study , said Mel Placilla , the project manager . Placilla said transportation officials informed him Friday that the $ 650-million project would be put_on hold . The transportation group has $ 1 billion tied_up in the county ' s investment pool , which was frozen as a result of the bankruptcy filing . &quot; It ' s too early to say we won ' t be able to do the road , &quot; Placilla said . &quot; But I can tell you that this is going_to make_it much more difficult for us to continue . we ' ll just have to wait and see what happens. &quot; Meanwhile , former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron and his assistant , Matthew Raabe , have each hired private attorneys , a pair of former federal prosecutors with experience in criminal defense and fraud . Raabe is now the acting treasurer . Michael Kolbenschlag , who is acting_as a spokesman for the county during the crisis , said the county would pay Citron ' s and Raabe ' s legal bills unless they are convicted of any wrongdoing . Raabe ' s lawyer , Terry W . Bird of Century City , said it is too soon to tell what types of legal work he will be handling . Bird said he has not yet been notified of the class-action lawsuits by bondholders naming Raabe as a defendant , and has not been contacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission , one of half_a_dozen agencies investigating the county ' s financial situation . &quot; I ' m representing him for all purposes right now , &quot; Bird said . &quot; This is changing so quickly , it ' s hard for me to tell what ' s happening next . It ' s been rather hectic , and I ' m working with Raabe on a daily basis. &quot; &quot; Matt ' s going_to do his job , he ' s going_to do_it right , &quot; Bird said of his client . &quot; It ' ll take a while before this thing gets sorted_out , but I think everybody will see that Matt did what he could. &quot; Officials from Washington , D.C. , to Sacramento are scrutinizing Citron ' s risky investments . Hayden said state lawmakers need to get more involved . &quot; I agree with the governor that we should not bail_out Orange County , &quot; Hayden said in a letter to Senate President Pro Tempore Bill Lockyer . &quot; But I disagree_with the notion that we ' ve had no hand in this , &quot; he added , pointing to laws approved by the Legislature that allowed county treasurers to participate in risky investments with taxpayer money . In the letter Hayden asked that the state ban governments from engaging in reverse repurchase agreements , &quot; the practice which was the death_knell of the Orange County fund , &quot; and limit the percentage of public funds that can be put into derivatives , complex investment instruments tied to interest_rates or other variable mechanisms . He also suggested that the state repeal the law allowing local_governments to buy lower-rated securities , prohibit governments from purchasing long-term securities , and institute &quot; strong prohibitions &quot; against contributions by brokerages to campaigns of officials who invest money . Hayden also said he had assigned an attorney from his staff to investigate the Orange County crisis and work_on the legislation full-time . &quot; I don ' t think you can turn your back on something as though it ' s kind of a localized cancer , &quot; Hayden said Saturday . &quot; On the one hand , the state is not responsible_for a failed set of policies on the Orange County level . On the other hand , the state has fostered a climate of deregulation without oversight . &quot; The state is broke , &quot; he added . &quot; The state can ' t bail_out Orange County . &quot; But Orange County is not an isolated case . It ' s the tip of a melting iceberg of irresponsible fiscal decisions abetted by special_interest campaign contributions . If this could happen in a county that has a reputation for believing_in fiscal conservatism , it certainly could happen , and is happening , in other places. &quot; Times staff writers Jodi Wilgoren and H.G. Reza contributed to this report.INVESTMENTS</TEXT>
