   <HEADLINE> ROCKWELL UNITS GET TRAIN , AVIATION CONTRACTS ; ELECTRONICS : DIVISIONS WILL HELP DEVELOP HIGH-SPEED RAIL SYSTEMS AND FLIGHT AND NAVIGATIONAL TECHNOLOGIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rockwell International Corp . said Thursday that two of its units have signed separate contracts to help other companies build high-speed trains for Amtrak and to develop navigation and avionics systems for the world ' s aviation industry . Rockwell ' s Railroad Electronics division agreed to be a subcontractor in one of several bids to build high-speed trains for Amtrak.It would supply complete electronic systems for power_units built by Siemens Transportation_Systems Inc. in New York . Siemens is one of six companies that Amtrak pre-qualified last October to bid as general contractor for the high-speed train project , which is designed to supply 26 passenger_trains mainly in the Northeast . Amtrak is expected to award the contract , worth $ 450 million to $ 500 million , later this year . Rockwell , based in Seal Beach , already supplies cab electronics systems for locomotives manufactured by the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors Corp . Separately , Rockwell signed a memorandum of agreement with Deutsche Aerospace AG in Munich , Germany , a unit of Daimler Benz AG , to form a joint_venture to develop avionics systems and to market key aviation technologies , such_as satellite-based navigation systems . Rockwell ' s Collins Commercial Avionics unit and Deutsche Aerospace ' s Radar and Radio Systems division would form a new company to be based in Ulm , Germany . The company will be named later this year after the joint_venture is created . Rockwell hopes the partnership will enable it to expand its satellite navigation capabilities for aircraft and helicopters to growing markets in Europe and the former Soviet_Union states like Russia .</TEXT>
