   <HEADLINE> TAKING_ON MEXICO ' S PEOPLE PROBLEMS ; ECONOMICS : PRESIDENT SALINAS ' SUCCESSOR WILL FACE THE COUNTRY ' S OVERWHELMING SOCIAL PROBLEMS OR PRESIDE OVER AN INCREASINGLY STRIFE-TORN NATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In nearly six years as president of Mexico , Carlos Salinas de Gortari has done a masterful job of taming inflation , reducing the nation ' s budget_deficit and attracting international investment . But Salinas ' policies have exacted enormous social costs at_the_same_time that Mexico ' s new respect in the industrialized world and approval of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement have raised expectations among Mexicans for a better life . The next president -- most likely Ernesto Zedillo Ponce de Leon , the Institutional Revolutionary Party ' s ( PRI ) newly designated candidate to replace assassinated candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio -- will have to focus_on solving the country ' s overwhelming social problems or risk presiding over an increasingly strife-torn nation . &quot; There has to be a much more deliberate approach to ( solving ) extreme poverty &quot; and to improving education , health , housing and other basic services , said Nora Lustig , senior fellow at the Brookings Institution . Salinas ' priority was fighting inflation , which has fallen to about 8 % from more_than 50 % six years ago . But the campaign required reduced public spending and a tight_money policy that aggravated the impact of the global recession -- particularly the slowdown in the United States . Salaried jobs in Mexico shrank by 2 % in 1993 as the country slipped into a recession in the last_half of the year , according to official statistics . Unemployment , including people not formally included in the work_force , is an estimated 25 % . Mexicans who kept their jobs found their spending power reduced because prices rose higher than wages . Salinas ' programs have created a &quot; sound financial base &quot; and fiscal stability for Mexico but at a great sacrifice by most Mexicans , said Scott E . Kalb , a Mexico analyst with Smith Barney Shearson . &quot; You have to turn_to matters of creating better equity , and you do that by spending on social_welfare , on education , health_care and improvements . You need infrastructure in place or you get bottlenecks . If you don ' t spend on education , your economic progress will be inhibited by the capabilities of your work_force , &quot; Kalb said . Many analysts said Salinas ' fiscal_policies have provided some leeway for the next administration to increase public spending without reigniting inflation . &quot; The critical_point is that Salinas ' progress in achieving stability has paved the way for greater spending on health , education , bridges and roads , &quot; said Salomon Bros . economist Larry Goodman . Zedillo , a 42-year-old Yale-educated economist who served Salinas as minister of budget and planning before leaving to direct Colosio ' s campaign , on Tuesday spoke_of the need to more equitably distribute the nation ' s economic gains . In accepting the PRI nomination , he pledged to &quot; greatly enhance regional development in every region of the country , particularly those which have been left_behind in the greater advancement of the country. &quot; He also promised to &quot; further an economy of certainty based on healthy public finances that will directly benefit the standard_of_living of all Mexicans. &quot; Economists reacted favorably to Zedillo ' s designation as a sign of continuity from the Salinas regime . There was also approval -- though restrained -- from investors . The Mexican Stock_Exchange , which had dropped 3 % Monday and continued downward in early trading Tuesday , rebounded with the news that Zedillo was named . Zedillo &quot; is the best candidate that PRI could get under these conditions , &quot; said Josue Campos Campuzano , an economist with the Wharton Econometric Forecasting Assn. , a Philadelphia-based think_tank that studies Mexico . &quot; He knows the politics and the economics of the old_guard and of the avant-garde of the PRI . He will work to consolidate them. &quot; Whatever his policies , Mexico ' s next president will be much more subject_to outside political pressures and less free than Salinas to impose technocratic solutions , said Rudi Dornbusch , professor of economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology . &quot; Economic issues are going_to be far more politicized than in the past , &quot; Dornbusch said . &quot; Democracy has arrived and that makes economic policy-making much harder . Remedies to poverty will be far more important and politicized than in the past six years. &quot; &quot; Mexico will become a real country . It ' s been the dream of a technocrat for the last six years , &quot; Dornbusch said . Advice ? Dornbusch of MIT said his suggestions to the new president are an immediate 30 % devaluation of the Mexican_peso , a move that would create more demand for Mexican goods by making them cheaper on foreign markets . That , in turn , would create more manufacturing jobs . Such a devaluation is not likely . But , even without such sweeping measures and despite last year ' s recession , most Mexico experts expected the country to bounce_back with economic_growth of 3 % or more in 1994 . &quot; For most of us who look_at Mexico on a daily basis , things have been looking_up lately , &quot; said Lawrence Krohn , an emerging markets_analyst with Lehman Bros . &quot; Anecdotal evidence suggests that the economy is recovering in the first_quarter in retail sales and manufacturing. &quot; Economy at a Glance Taming inflation has been one of Mexico ' s greatest economic successes in recent years . Inflation_rate : 9.0 % But the tight_money and other austerity policies used to fight inflation have been costly in terms of slower economic_growth . Gross_domestic_product ( percent change ) : 2.3 % And higher unemployment . Unemployment_rate : 10.8 % Sources : Bank of America , World Information Services , CIEMEX WEFA * MAIN STORY : A1</TEXT>
