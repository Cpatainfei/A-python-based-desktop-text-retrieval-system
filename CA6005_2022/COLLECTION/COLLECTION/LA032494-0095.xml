   <HEADLINE> OFF THE TICKER : NEXT : VIDEO_GAMES THAT GET PHYSICAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You need to exercise , but you ' d rather play video_games ? Do both , says Life Fitness Inc. , maker of Lifecycle exercise_bikes that plans this summer to unveil an &quot; Exertainment &quot; version with game maker Nintendo . The bike , expected to retail about $ 1 # 000 , is for use with a separate Nintendo system.Success at the games depend_on how consistently riders are able to pedal within a target heart_rate . A system by HeartBeat Corp. , a licensee of Sega , already sells a device that includes &quot; Outback Joey &quot; video_games in which a character sweats profusely and falls from dehydration if the exerciser ' s heart_rate gets too high . Virtual reality could crank_up the movement , said Justin Hall-Tipping , who founded HeartBeat . &quot; I expect we will develop exploratory games , like pedaling through . . . France. &quot;</TEXT>
