   <TEXT> If I really knew the future of home computers for the coming year , do you think I ' d still be working_at a salaried position ? The only thing anyone can say for certain in the home computer field -- where the future seems to change about every two weeks -- is that there will be more of it . This year , an estimated 6.9 million computers will be sold for home use in the United States , making them second only to color_TVs in consumer electronic sales . Because of the boom , entrepreneurs and other speculators will continue to throw millions of dollars into software , CD-ROMs and on-line services development in hopes of jumping_on the bandwagon of the next &quot; Carmen Sandiego , &quot; Flying Toaster screensaver or Mosaic . One of the areas most primed for growth is on-line services , which have become all_the more important now that many home computers come equipped with telephone modems . If you have students in the household , they might well want to do research on such services as America Online , CompuServe and Prodigy , all_of which have encyclopedias and numerous special_interest information groups on-line . The ubiquitous Microsoft will debut its own on-line service in 1995 , and because this 1 # 000-pound gorilla of the home computer world never does anything quietly , its entrance into the field could cause a shake-up . Look_for continuing efforts next year to tame the wild and woolly Internet to make_it more friendly for home use . With the arrival last year of Mosaic , and its even more advanced offspring -- Netscape -- average citizens who don ' t want to sacrifice their leisure_time to learn obscure computer_languages have been exploring the Net . CD-ROMs , which were still fairly rare at the beginning of ' 94 , may soon make software disks the long-playing records of the home computer field . If your current home computer does not have a CD-ROM player , your next one likely will -- especially if you have children who want to explore the many art , music , science and history CD-ROMs due for ' 95 release . Truly compatible Mac / Windows computers , slated to come_out next year , will be a welcome addition to the home market -- especially for people who now use one format in the office and another at_home . Finally , this is not a prediction but a request for the new year : Let ' s all join hands , digitally , and pledge that in 1995 we will no long make &quot; clever &quot; wordplay on the term &quot; information superhighway. &quot;</TEXT>
