   <HEADLINE> STREET SMART : CRASH INVESTIGATORS PUT IT ALL TOGETHER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was physics that sent the physics professor spinning and would probably send his car_insurance soaring . Those were the equal and opposite reactions to his action of blowing a red_light and knocking his Toyota head-on into a Geo . When Sgt . Ben Lee pulled_up seconds later , the professor was dabbing the blood on his chin . His battered car still sat askew amid bits of shattered glass and plastic , its malfunctioning alarm still squealing . As an accident investigator for the Los Angeles Police_Department , Lee spends his afternoons and evenings at scenes like this -- streets and sidewalks littered with twisted metal and , all too often , with twisted bodies . By carefully measuring skid marks and picking through busted-up hulks , Lee and his officers can piece together and make_sense of a chain of events that unfolds over fractions of a second . In serious accidents they are homicide detectives , tracking_down hit-and-run drivers and collaring drunks . In simple fender-benders they are mediators , making_sure drivers swap insurance information . It is often a technical job that is decidedly unglamorous . No one ever thanks them for handing_out a ticket . Yet they are the officers the average person is most likely to meet . Americans will spend an estimated $ 800 million this year on anti-theft devices for their cars such_as alarms and steering_wheel locks , according to the National_Insurance Crime Bureau . But most will spend little time and almost no money improving their driving skills . In fact , the average person is more likely to die in a traffic accident than at the hands of a carjacker . And even minor collisions can end_up costing thousands by the time repair bills and insurance hikes are tallied up . * A sharp accident investigator can piece together a simple crash like the professor ' s in a_few minutes . Complicated collisions involving several vehicles or a fatality can take several hours . When the driver bolts from an accident , the investigation gets_even trickier . Detective Bob Uber said investigating traffic deaths can be more difficult to solve than murders . Murders often have motives . Traffic accidents are random . &quot; We don ' t have a bullet , &quot; said Uber , who investigates accidents that involve crimes such_as hit-and-run or drunk driving . What they do have is evidence like tire marks . Tires leave different skids as they do different things . With the length of a skid , an investigator can determine how fast a car was traveling . Flat skids generally indicate a driver trying to stop by slamming_on the brakes . Acceleration skids often leave traces of rubber on the pavement . Sometimes , it seems like reading tea leaves to the uninitiated . At a collision in Pacoima , Officer John Teetor traced skid marks on the pavement , pointing_out different events as revealed by the tracks . Braking began here , impact occurred there , the car got pushed sideways to here . &quot; that ' s probably where his axle broke , &quot; Teetor said , pointing to a wobble in an otherwise straight skid . Other techniques are more conventional . In serious accidents , investigators comb through cars for clothing fibers or fingerprints or anything to connect a driver to an accident . On simple collisions , the routine is simple . Officers check to make_sure drivers were wearing seat_belts . On one Mustang , when Teetor and Lee clasped the belt together , only an inch or two was left between the buckle and the seat back , indicating it had not been used . &quot; He would have to be pretty skinny to be wearing that belt , &quot; Lee says . * Hopping_out of his black-and-white at the corner of Saticoy and Variel streets in Canoga Park , Lee ' s first order_of_business is to make_sure no one is injured . The professor ' s jaw is covered with cuts caused by the violent inflation of his car ' s air_bag , so Lee calls an ambulance . The other driver , a 17-year-old with no license and no insurance , is uninjured . Uninsured motorists are a problem on the streets . Lee estimates as_many as 40 % of drivers in Los Angeles are uninsured . Many who forsake insurance also neglect to register their cars or even bother to get a license . &quot; They have nothing to lose , &quot; Lee says . &quot; But you better believe that if you hit them , they will somehow find a lawyer. &quot; As he waits for the ambulance to arrive , Lee climbs into the front seat of the professor ' s still-squawking Toyota and nudges it out of rush-hour traffic . The front axle is broken so the few feet to the curb are as far as the car will go . A witness tells Lee that the professor blew through the red_light at Saticoy just as the teen-ager was starting a left turn onto Variel . The professor says he was_on his way to class when the light changed yellow . The teen-ager claims he was just going_to the grocery_store when he was hit . The crash left both cars undrivable , so Lee requests a tow truck over his radio . Minutes later , the teen-ager ' s mother arrives . She opts to push the family car the block or so home instead of paying the tow truck_driver . The ambulance arrives and two paramedics examine the professor ' s jaw , peppering him with questions about age , height , weight , date of birth . &quot; Hey , &quot; one of the paramedics says cheerfully , &quot; you got a birthday coming_up . An early happy birthday to you. &quot; The professor smiles faintly and mumbles something about his class . &quot; I think you ' re going to be a little late , &quot; the cheerful paramedic says , wrapping_up the exam . The professor ' s cuts are just cuts , not a more serious injury as Lee feared . As the ambulance pulls_away , the tow truck arrives . The driver quickly hooks_up the professor ' s Toyota and offers him a ride back to the garage , where he can use the phone to call_for a ride home . An hour after the crash , the street is clear again and traffic is moving swiftly . Lee ' s job is over . For the teen-ager , who was cited for not having a license or insurance , the accident means he may_not get a license until he turns 21 . For the professor , who was ultimately determined to be at_fault , the accident means a pricey trip to the body shop and probably an insurance hike .</TEXT>
