   <HEADLINE> NEW STRAINS OF AIDS VIRUS ARE IDENTIFIED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Researchers have identified as_many as 30 different strains of the AIDS virus that often elude conventional tests used to detect their presence in blood , a Belgian researcher said here Monday . The new strains , first isolated in the Central African_country of Cameroon , have never been detected in the United States and present no threat now to the American blood supply , J . Richard George of the U.S. Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention told the 10th International Conference on AIDS . But French scientists have identified the viruses , collectively called HIV-1 subtype O , in at least 10 people in Paris , some of whom have no connection to Cameroon . Existing blood_tests may eventually have to be modified to ensure they detect the new strains as well , a recent meeting at the World_Health_Organization concluded . In a separate development , Dr. Robert Gallo , co-discoverer of the AIDS virus , announced that he may have found the first effective treatment for Kaposi ' s sarcoma , the form of cancer that is often a distinguishing feature of acquired immune deficiency syndrome . Although he reported only animal data , Gallo said his new approach is supported by indirect_evidence in humans and that it should be put into clinical trial immediately . AIDS activists have long criticized the scientific Establishment for devoting insufficient effort toward development of a treatment for Kaposi ' s and its disfiguring tumors . If Gallo ' s results are validated in humans , it could represent a significant advance in treatment , they said . The human_immunodeficiency_virus mutates extremely rapidly , as much as 1 million times faster than most other organisms ; that instability has led to a proliferation of strains of HIV . Genetic information in these different strains can vary by a fraction of a percent or by as much as 30 % . Nonetheless , the viruses can be grouped together in various ways . Two main types are recognized -- HIV-1 and HIV-2 . HIV-1 is the family that causes disease in most of the world , while HIV-2 predominates in areas of West Africa . These two families can further be broken_down into eight subtypes , labeled A through H ; all these subtypes are readily recognized by existing tests . The new strains are called subtype O , for &quot; outliers , &quot; because they lie outside the existing subtypes . The subtype O strains do not necessarily resemble each other , however . The first subtype O HIV was , in fact , reported at the 1988 International AIDS Conference by Guido van der Groen of the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Antwerp , Belgium . It was dismissed as a &quot; curiosity &quot; of no importance , said Dr. Peter Piot of WHO . But Van der Groen reported here Monday that as_many as 10 % of AIDS patients in Cameroon have antibodies to one of the subtype O viruses . The strains are also found in as_many as 6 % of AIDS patients in neighboring Niger and Gabon but not in other nearby countries , he said . Similar results were reported by Josef Eberle of the Max von Pettenkofer Institut in Munich , Germany . He and his colleagues found that as_many as 30 % of infections by new subtypes could not be detected by one or more tests normally used to monitor HIV infections . &quot; More disturbing , &quot; he said , were similar problems in the more sophisticated tests , called western blots , that are used to confirm results in the preliminary tests . French researchers reported earlier this summer in the medical journal the Lancet that they had identified HIV-1 subtype O in nine AIDS patients in Paris , most of whom had connections to Cameroon . The virus went undetected in at least one instance when subjected_to each blood_test normally used to test for HIV infection ; one test missed the virus in blood from all nine patients and is no longer used in France . Dr. Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur Institute in Paris , co-discoverer of the AIDS virus , said Monday that he had also isolated a subtype O strain from a French woman who has apparently harbored the virus since at least 1978 and who has no known risk factors for infection . Van der Groen said at least 30 subtype O strains are now known . Experts said there is no immediate threat from the new strains but noted that HIV-2 was first discovered in the same fashion . The growing number of cases in Cameroon suggests that the virus is spreading , Van der Groen said . But he emphasized that &quot; there is no reason why there has to be changes in existing HIV tests. &quot; Gallo ' s work_on Kaposi ' s sarcoma at the National Cancer Institute involved basic research on the mechanism of tumor formation . Among other things , Gallo developed an &quot; immortal &quot; line of Kaposi ' s cells that can be grown in the laboratory and injected into immunodeficient mice to produce the first animal model of the disease , he said . Using these cells , he discovered that Kaposi ' s cells are controlled by a hormone that is produced during pregnancy , called human chorionic gonadotropin or hCG . This hormone , he said , can prevent the formation of Kaposi ' s tumors when injected into the immunodeficient mice along with the malignant Kaposi ' s cells . It can also cure a tumor when injected into mice after the tumor has had time to establish itself . Gallo noted that another female hormone , called luteinizing_hormone , is about 85 % identical to hCG and may , thus , aid in controlling the tumor . &quot; That may provide the first explanation for why men get Kaposi ' s far more often than women do , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
