   <HEADLINE> MIKE DOWNEY : BY MONDAY , WE SHOULD BE_ON A FIRST-NAME BASIS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Because I wish to pay tribute to those successful boys from Brazil , today I will address our U.S. soccer players strictly by their first_names . For example , in our Independence_Day battle against the Brazilians up there in the far-north Sao Paolo suburb of Palo Alto , I am expecting outstanding performances from our hungry young team , particularly from Marcelo , Tony , Ernie and Tab . For a fast minute there Tuesday , it sure did look as though we might be playing Sweden instead , but , alas , even with our American boys sending along our very best wishes -- sweets to the Swedes -- it was not enough to maintain a 1-0 advantage over Bebeto , Romario , Dunga , Rai and friends . Too_bad , too , because Sweden is a team we could take , one of those weaker soccer nations like Costa Rica or , oh , you know , England . Of course , Bora Milutinovic , the U.S. coach with the sheep_dog bangs and the scuba-mask eyeglasses , is sitting here right in front of me between practice_sessions , swearing that this is Mission Viejo , not Mission_Impossible . &quot; Brazil is Brazil , &quot; Bora is saying . &quot; But , in one game , everything is possible. &quot; Repeating the phrase , &quot; I am so happy , &quot; like a mantra , Bora -- better use his first_name , too , mainly so I can stop looking_up the spelling -- also says he is still attempting to ascertain why so many seemed so unhappy with the outcome of Sunday ' s 1-0 defeat to Romania at the Rose Bowl , inasmuch as : &quot; To lose , 1-0 , is like tie for us. &quot; ( Translated : Good_enough to proceed to Round 2. ) Well , sorry , Bora , I find myself saying to him , but it ' s just that we have become so accustomed to winning our big soccer games here in America now . &quot; Where you from ? &quot; Bora says , squinting through those lenses of his . &quot; You new here. &quot; USA vs . Brazil is David vs . GOOOOOOOALLL-iath . We have met five times . Brazil has won all five . We have scored three goals against this team . Brazil has scored 20 goals against us . Brazil worries about us in soccer approximately the same way we worry about Uruguay in basketball . Brazil isn ' t too shook_up over us beating Colombia . Brazil won ' t be shook_up unless it ' s the 90th minute and the only goal of the game has been scored by Alexi or Cobi , not Romario or Rai . On the other hand , Brazil is Brazil . Back when you were coaching Costa Rica for a living , Bora is asked , before one of your big_games against Brazil , &quot; What would you tell your players ? &quot; Bora thinks this over . &quot; Don ' t ask_for autographs , &quot; he answers . Excellent strategy . Monday morning , be sure to write this on the U.S. team ' s chalkboard : AND REMEMBER , NO AUTOGRAPHS . Although , you must admit , at least it would n ' t take the Brazilian players too_much effort to scribble down their signatures , not needing last_names and all . And besides , I hear Dunga autographs are going_for $ 50 apiece these days at Southern California memorabilia shows . Certainly the surprising Swedes were not overly intimidated by the great Brazil team before Tuesday ' s contest . While watching the game on TV , the American players clearly took encouragement from the fact that the Brazilians did not look invincible . The U.S. players obviously enjoyed themselves immensely Tuesday , making_fun of whichever teammate was being interviewed on ESPN . &quot; Maybe Sweden will beat Brazil , &quot; said one of our top players , the popular Tab . &quot; Hey , it ' s possible. &quot; After all , Sweden ' s players do not intimidate easily . One of them , Klas Ingesson , bravely playing in this World Cup even though in May his automobile accidentally ran_into a moose . And nobody is conceding anything to Brazil at this point . Germany looks quite strong . So does Argentina . Mexico got_out of the &quot; group of death &quot; and is now listed in stable condition . Russia could surprise people if this one guy continues scoring goals at this nifty five-a-game clip . Oh , and naturally everybody has to remain aware of Italy , although occasionally I do find myself singing : &quot; Where have you gone , Roberto Baggio ? A nation turns its lonely eyes to you ! You-oo-oo ! &quot; As for the United States , all_right , let ' s throw a great big Fourth_of_July barbecue with Brazil on the grill . Our fellows consider themselves ready , willing_and_able for Monday ' s game , particularly now that team general_manager Bill ( The Burden Stops Here ) Nuttall is clear as a bell on those rules about how many yellow cards it takes_to disqualify a player . This recent misunderstanding created a disturbance after the one-game banishment of one of America ' s very best players -- John . Is this U.S. team better prepared to play Brazil , Bora is asked , than that old Costa Rica team of yours ? &quot; Yes . My team is better team than Costa Rica. &quot; Good to hear . So your team won ' t be asking_for autographs , Bora ? &quot; No . They do not know very well the Brazilian players. &quot; Seriously , Bora ? &quot; No , &quot; he says . &quot; This is joking. &quot;</TEXT>
