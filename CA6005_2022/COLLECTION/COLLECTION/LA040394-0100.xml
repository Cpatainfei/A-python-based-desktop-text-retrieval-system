   <HEADLINE> TASTE OF TRAVEL : ARIZONA : NO GLITZ GRUB ; SEARCH FOR ROAD FOOD IN AND AROUND PHOENIX UNCOVERS COWBOYS , BURGERS AND LOCAL COLOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If I had to choose my last meal , I ' d request the crema Catalan at the Scottsdale Princess hotel ' s Marquesa restaurant . I might also order the lobster and roasted corn_chowder from The Phoenician hotel ' s Windows on the Green restaurant . But I wasn ' t near death , I ' d blown half my vacation budget on two nights ' dining in Scottsdale ' s upper-crust resorts and I still didn ' t have a clue about the area ' s real flavors . that ' s when I turned_to my friend Jim Vaughan and asked where I could find regional food seasoned with local color . Vaughan is a Sonora Desert Huck Finn at 40 ; a self-educated wild_man and local tour operator who roars along Arizona back roads in a van , country_music tapes blaring . Vaughan considers himself an expert on Arizona road food -- the dining ( and diners ) he encounters as a local tour operator . He has his own way of rating restaurants and is slow to award his Five Beer Star rating . A place should have real food , he believes , not that fancy stuff . Lots of local color -- miners , ranchers and cowboys . No line dancing . No wimps . &quot; And a place loses a notch if it has more_than four Harley Davidsons out front . Nowadays , Harleys usually belong_to Yuppies . But the place would get its rating back if they were real bikers , &quot; Vaughan said . It was Vaughan who introduced me to such &quot; culinary attractions &quot; as the Rusty Spur Saloon cowboy bar in the Old Town Scottsdale area , where the big enticement is &quot; worm tequila &quot; ( $ 4.50 ) and buffalo burgers with green chili_sauce ( $ 5.50 ) . Any adventurer ' s trip to Mexico includes an introduction to mescal , the tequila cousin that hosts a shriveled-up cactus worm in the bottom of the bottle . The Rusty Spur ' s Dos Gusanos includes two such worms in alcohol so potent Trish Braun , the barmaid , warned me , &quot; It ' s not wise_to light a cigarette while you ' re drinking that stuff &quot; -- even though I wasn ' t smoking . Ten to 15 cowboys a week get_it down , dried_out worms and all , and win the honor of having their names burned into the wall as members of the bar ' s Rusty Spur Club . I was told it helps the high- stepping when the Western band starts_up at 2 p.m. Next stop on our tour was the Greasewood Flat Restaurant in the Pinnacle Peak area north of the ritzy resorts . &quot; There ' s only one Greasewood in the world , &quot; Vaughan boasted , as we drove_up the mountain . When we slipped through the ranch gate into a paddock area that houses what was once a bunk house and is now the restaurant-bar , we found a long line of dusty pickup_trucks interspersed with heavily chromed Harleys and spiffy new Mercedeses . I noticed bumper stickers on the backs of the parked pickups : &quot; Shooting is my aim in life , &quot; &quot; An armed man is a citizen , an unarmed man is a slave &quot; and &quot; My gun killed fewer people than Ted Kennedy ' s car. &quot; Across the parking_lot , tied to a hitching post , four saddled_horses dozed in the sun , awaiting their owners . It ' s wise_to make a first visit to Greasewood Flat at night . In full daylight it looks startlingly like a junkyard , surrounded as it is by prickly greasewood shrubs that bristle the dusty mountainside like 5 o ' clock shadow . A wagon_train of buckboards piled high with empty beer and liquor bottles encircles 100 or so weathered wooden picnic tables resting_on hard-packed dirt . But at night , gaslights and 10 or so huge metal fire barrels encourage a kinder , gentler feeling . With bonfires blazing , the country singer weaving his magic up_on the stage opposite the bunkhouse , and all ages and income levels trading stories around the picnic tables , it ' s the essence of Southwest camp-out . On the Sunday afternoon we visited , most of the outdoor tables were empty , but inside the converted bunk house , imposing bikers in black leather jackets barely cleared the ceiling where they stood drinking at the bar . Every inch of wall and ceiling was covered with business_cards , notes , drawings and autographed dollar_bills . A service window to the kitchen carried a sign warning , &quot; If you ' re not prepared to wait for your food , please don ' t order. &quot; Christine Johnson , Greasewood ' s restaurant manager , makes a mellow green chili_sauce that tops their thick , juicy cheeseburgers ( $ 4.75. ) &quot; My chili recipe won a_People ' s Choice Award at a local culinary festival , &quot; she bragged . &quot; There ' s no meat in it and it ' s not really hot , just very flavorful . We go_through 450 chili cheeseburgers on a Saturday night . A burger comes_with lettuce , tomato , onion , pickles and chips . One of those should do you unless you ' re a big eater. &quot; Regulars give her nachos with homemade salsa rave reviews , too ( $ 4.25 ) . Greasewood Flat can accommodate up_to 500 customers . The overflow heads for Toolie ' s Country , a barn of a place on the west_side of Phoenix with enough room for 850 cowboys and cowgirls to twirl and strut with abandon . Toolie ' s Country consistently wins plaudits from the Country_Music Assn . and the Academy of Country_Music as one of the top five country_music clubs in the United States . For Friday night fish_fries , Toolie ' s is the place to go -- $ 3.95 for a plate of fried fish and French fries delivered to tables that frame the enormous dance_floor . Toolie ' s also has free Western dancing lessons on Monday , Wednesday and Sunday evenings ( 6:30 to 8 p.m. ) . that ' s when we can learn everything from the Arizona two-step to country cha-cha , West Coast swing to the shuffle . Most popular of all are the line dances -- the Electric Slide , Achy-Breaky , Boot Scoot . Warning : No tank_tops or Harley T-shirts allowed , according to the management . The much smaller Handlebar-J , in north Scottsdale , has its own following of true cowboys ( as well as the pin-striped suit crowd ) -- all drawn by cowboy_hats nailed to the ceiling , barbecued ribs , steaks , a country band and high-gloss dance_floor . The beef barbecue dinner -- which locals devour with gusto -- will set you back about $ 14 . The most sterile place Vaughan would go_along with was Sam ' s Cafe in the downtown Phoenix Arizona Center . The restaurant overlooking a palm-tree-shaded oasis surrounded by business offices is justly famed for its poblano chicken chowder topped with tortilla_chips and mixed cheeses ( $ 3.95 for a big bowl ) . The bunuelo -- a fried tortilla shell dusted with cinnamon and sugar that serves as a bowl for vanilla_ice_cream drizzled with hot caramel -- was wonderful ( $ 3.95 ) . We had to drive all_the way to Cave Creek , a one-time mining town north of Phoenix near Carefree in quest of a &quot; Navajo taco &quot; in an unlikely setting . The Indian Village shop -- just up the_hill from the touristy Frontier Town , complete with a gallows in the parking_lot -- didn ' t look_like it could possibly contain anything authentic . We made our way through the shop ' s vast souvenir collection to a snack_counter at the back . There we selected from a menu on the wall , and watched tentatively as a ball of dough , thrown into a boiling kettle of oil , exploded into an eight-inch puffy crust . The choice of toppings was anything from beans and cheese to honey and powdered sugar . But the real deal was the Navajo taco : pinto_beans , red chile sauce , shredded lettuce and chopped tomatoes on the puffy , eight-inch crust ( $ 4.95 ) . It ' s the closest you ' ll come_to the Navajo tacos served on Native_American reservations . I know this from experience . On the way back into Phoenix , we stopped at Frontier Town , just long enough to check_out the Black Mountain Brewing Co . chile beer at Crazy Ed ' s Satisfied Frog Restaurant . Crazy Ed Chilleen is a Phoenix institution , of sorts . His beer -- pilsener spiked with Serrano chiles -- goes all_over the world . Just the thing to wash_down your 32-ounce porterhouse_steak ( $ 16.95 ) . I wanted to sample menudo so we headed for south Phoenix , though Vaughan was not turned_on by the thought of what he referred to as &quot; that stomach food. &quot; ( It ' s made of honeycomb_tripe -- part of a cow ' s stomach -- simmered with dried corn , chiles and sometimes tomatoes. ) Judging by the prevalence of the signs_in restaurant windows , menudo is a hot seller on Sunday mornings , when it is downed as a hangover cure , according to my friend Vaughan -- an authority on such matters . Adrian Mosqueda , owner-chef at Adrian ' s Restaurant , sells 80 gallons of menudo during an average three-day weekend , but it is in_demand all week long ( $ 4.50 for a big bowl ) , he said . Other offerings on his printed menu that boasts &quot; Taste the Real Mexican Food &quot; : beef_tongue tacos ( $ 1.40 ) , goat meat barbecue ( $ 5.75 ) and baked chicken in mole , served with rice or beans and tortillas ( $ 5.75 ) . I ordered fish tacos at the San Carlos Bay Seafood Restaurant -- two to a plate with rice and beans ( $ 5.25 ) . Strips of moist red_snapper wrapped in a soft_corn tortilla came topped by half a lime and the traditional garnish of chopped tomato and lettuce . ( Yum. ) Next time I ' ll try the Seven Seas Stew , which looked and smelled marvelous : a huge , steaming bowl of snapper , crab legs , squid , octopus , abalone , carrots and green chiles in a tomato broth ( $ 9.75 ) . ( Little English is spoken. ) Our next stop was El Tianguis en Guadalupe Plaza , one of Vaughan ' s favorite haunts in south Phoenix , an area that is home to many Latinos . The park behind a whitewashed adobe church is an echo of a tranquil border town on a Sunday afternoon . An arcade of shops offers everything from pinatas to sombreros to guava paste . A couple of musicians with amplified guitars played for dancing on the plaza , and families sat at little tables outside El Taquito Restaurant , plates piled high with such delicacies as cabeza burrito ( $ 2.50 ) , marinated meat from the cow ' s head ; a Spanish sesos taco of stewed beef brains in a crisp corn tortilla ( $ 1 ) . I opted for more conventional fare and ended_up with a generous serving of carne asada ( strips of beef briefly marinated in a vinegary mix before grilling ) with rice and beans on the side . It was terrific ( $ 6.75 ) . Only a_few blocks away , our last stop -- and most fun because of a meeting with its owner-chef Victoria Chavez -- was Los Dos Molinos . Chavez greeted us in her cooking clothes : a pert hat with a concho band , a stylish yellow , black and green floral print dress under an apron and comfortable shoes . The eyes behind the owlish red-frame glasses sparkled when we admired the distinctive adobe dining_room with tile-topped tables that Chavez and her husband had created in what was once a chapel . &quot; My food is hot , Hon . I mean to tell you , it ' s real hot . My chili comes from Hatch , New Mexico , and I buy_it by the truckload , &quot; Chavez said . &quot; The best thing on the menu is the ribs marinated in red chili_sauce -- carne adovada . that ' s done_in a homemade tortilla in one version ( $ 5.25 ) ; in another , it ' s ribs on a big plate with tortillas on the side ( $ 6.95 ) . It ' s really good but I always warn people. &quot; Los Dos Molinos doesn ' t advertise . &quot; I ' d rather just let people who have been here tell their friends so they ' ll know what to expect . As it is , people have to wait around outside to get_in and then they can ' t eat the food . Then they get mad . I just give them their money back. &quot; I sampled her red chili_sauce -- just the tiniest drop on the end of a homemade tortilla_chip . The burn started on the tip of my tongue , leaped to the back of my mouth , catapulted up my nasal passage and exited as tears in my eyes . Then I sneezed . Vaughan hooted . But I noticed he wasn ' t touching the stuff . . . Five Beer Star rating or not . When we paid our bill and were heading out the door , Chavez noticed my misty eyes . &quot; Oh , Hon . You did try my chili ! &quot; GUIDEBOOK : Desert Delights Where to eat : Adrian ' s , 2334 E . McDowell Road , Phoenix ; tel . ( 602 ) 273-7957 . El Taquito , 9201 S .
