   <TEXT> I would like to point_out that not one of the so-called British hooligan slang expressions in the L.A. Speak of June 12 ( by Jill Stewart , Palm Latitudes ) has anything at all to do with hooligans . As someone well-versed in soccer as a player and spectator , I can state that I have never heard of fans referred to as &quot; firms , &quot; and that &quot; ground , pitch and terraces &quot; and &quot; man of the match &quot; are not slang terms but perfectly correct descriptive nouns . Stewart also advises us that supporters may respond with the exclamation &quot; bollocks &quot; when someone misses a goal . Remotely possible , but highly unlikely , as that is the slang word for &quot; testicles. &quot; H.E.D. REID Los Angeles I take umbrage with Stewart ' s &quot; British hooligan slang , &quot; which she reports is coming_to the Rose Bowl via the World Cup . First , the_British are not coming ; they lost . But the_Irish are coming , and the fact that they ' ll use the term &quot; bollocks &quot; does not qualify them as hooligans or Brits . Furthermore , I am not a hooligan , even though as a child growing_up in Dublin I attended thousands of soccer games , as did my Da , my uncle and the local parish priest . &quot; Bollocks , &quot; which derives from the male_genitalia , isn ' t strictly soccer talk . It has everyday usage in Ireland and Britain , with three different spellings and connotations : Bollix -- Said to a friend who let you down . Bollox -- Failure to get something right . Bollocks -- The original and most brutal term . An Irish glossary once referred to Oliver Cromwell as a &quot; dirty old_English Bollocks. &quot; SHAY DUFFIN Redondo Beach</TEXT>
