   <HEADLINE> DECISION ' 94 / SPECIAL GUIDE TO CALIFORNIA ' S ELECTIONS ; TRUTH OR FICTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Any charge that pops_up late ( in a campaign ) and is particularly personal or outrageous is indeed suspect. &quot; -- Sagrow &quot; More often than not , the opinion as_to whether something is true or false . . . is based on which candidate is being gored. &quot; -- Hoffenblum * Allan Hoffenblum and Darry Sragow are longtime California political consultants . That means they know by trade all_the tricks of political persuasion at election time . The Times asked Hoffenblum , who works for Republicans , and Sragow , who works for Democrats , to warn us about what voters should watch for as the election approaches . * HOFFENBLUM : OK , Darry , it ' s 10 days before the election and the candidates ' campaign managers and media advisers are looking_at polling data indicating they are behind . It is desperation time . Can voters expect to see a barrage of last-minute deceptive advertising ? SRAGOW : I don ' t know about you , Allan , but none of my candidates would engage in those tactics . But I do warn them to expect it from the Republicans . HOFFENBLUM : Come_on , one ' s party affiliation doesn ' t determine one ' s ethics . And more often than not , the opinion as_to whether something is true or false , right or wrong , is based on which candidate is being gored . . . yours or your opponent . SRAGOW : The most common trick is to take one teeny piece of information about an opponent and totally distort it . HOFFENBLUM : You mean the half-truth . SRAGOW : I ' m not even getting_to the &quot; half &quot; truth yet . One typical Republican ploy is to create a new organization that issues ratings of officeholders . The statement that the &quot; National Taxpayers Alliance &quot; says my Democratic candidate has an 8 rating out of 100 in cutting spending may well raise questions in the minds of the voters , yet the National Taxpayers Alliance may be the creation of a Republican political consultant who computes ratings that are totally misleading . HOFFENBLUM : OK . But I ' ve seen campaigns where the Democrat consultant just turns_around and creates his or her own phony group to do the same thing . The biggest problem we Republicans have is that several organizations that purport to be nonpartisan are actually run_by partisan Democrats who tout the liberal agenda and are able and willing to send_out mailers that often totally distort the record of the Republican incumbent or candidate . Environmentalists and education groups are the worst offenders . SRAGOW : So what you ' re saying is that groups that endorse Democrats have a bias . I ' m saying that a lot of Republican endorsement groups don ' t even exist . HOFFENBLUM : Just because the message comes from a real group , or even a well-known person , doesn ' t mean the facts are truthful , especially when it arrives_at the last minute . Let me give you an example . A few years back , I was managing a tough campaign for the state Assembly , and just days before the election , a vote-gram arrived in the mailboxes of voters over the age of 60 , attacking my candidate . Now this is an important group . The vote-gram was supposedly signed by Claude Pepper , who was a highly influential member of Congress noted for supporting issues important to seniors . One week after the election , we discovered that Mr. Pepper knew_nothing about the mailer . We lost that election . SRAGOW : Earlier this year , I was the consultant to a strongly pro-environment legislative candidate who was challenging a longtime incumbent with a record on the environment that was worse than Exxon ' s . My candidate was a member of the Sierra Club , and was strongly endorsed by the club . In the closing days of the race , the incumbent dropped a piece of mail implying that he was endorsed by the Sierra Club . That false_statement clearly hurt the challenger in strongly pro-environment coastal precincts . HOFFENBLUM : I can top that . I remember being involved in a tough Republican primary , and again , in the closing days of the election , my candidate ' s opponent sent_out a mailer which loudly proclaimed on the face of the envelope &quot; Reagan Endorsement Enclosed. &quot; If the voter bothered to open the envelope to read the message , they would have found_out that it was the local candidate who had endorsed Ronald Reagan , not the other way around . SRAGOW : An incumbent ' s votes on specific bills are fertile ground for deception . Particularly in Congress , votes are cast_on very complex bills . Take , for example , aid to Israel . An up-or-down vote on aid to Israel is highly unusual . Those funds are one line in huge , multibillion-dollar , multipurpose bills . A member of Congress who votes against the entire bill could be accused of voting against Israel , even though aid to Israel is a very small piece of the bill , and the member ' s reason may having nothing to do with Israel . Or there might be several votes on a particular topic . For example , there were two versions of legislation to investigate the current post_office scandal in Congress . A candidate who voted &quot; yes &quot; on one of them and &quot; no &quot; on the other for entirely legitimate policy reasons could be falsely accused in a last-minute mailer of voting to stop the investigation . HOFFENBLUM : But again , that ' s done_by both sides . We are really saying that voters should be highly skeptical of any charges made against a candidate -- regardless of the purported source -- in the closing days of the campaign . If the facts are true , a candidate wants to get_on top of the highest mountain with the loudest bullhorn and repeat the charges as early and as often as possible . Charges made at the last moment are in almost all cases suspect . SRAGOW : I agree with that . It ' s tough to get a message across to voters in this gigantic state . If I have the goods on an opponent , I will certainly make the charge early and repeat it often . Any charge that pops_up late and is particularly personal or outrageous is indeed suspect , all_the more so if it comes from a source other_than the opposition campaign . Anonymous flyers are illegal and I think most voters know that if a charge is made anonymously -- or if it ' s not clear who sent it -- the allegation should be discounted . HOFFENBLUM : The more obscure the source , the more suspicious the voter should be . SRAGOW : One of the great mysteries of California politics are the so-called &quot; slate cards , &quot; or voter guides . They invariably flood our mailboxes in the closing days of the campaigns ( and , to the chagrin of some candidates , after the election ) . I ' ve never figured_out which slate card to trust . Each looks official or purports to come from a political_party . The truth is that most of these cards are profit-making enterprises that sell space to the highest bidder . My advice is to ignore all_of them . HOFFENBLUM : As one who produces one of the more established slate cards for Republican voters , I have to take_exception to that . Voters should approach slate cards and voters guides like any other piece of campaign literature . Some are phony and deceptive , others are not . The voters should look very closely to see who sent the slate card . If they can ' t tell , then throw it away . SRAGOW : But I ' d like to get beyond practices that are literally deceptive and talk_about practices that may be truthful , but are misleading . You Republicans are especially adept at manipulating emotional symbols . When you ' ve run_out of anything else to talk_about , you fall_back on fear . Willie Horton , black_and_white news footage of people scurrying across the I-5 , film of a terrorist throwing a body of an executed hostage onto the Tarmac . These powerful visual symbols are dredged_up whenever you have an unpopular candidate or a lousy economy and your party can ' t win on its own merits . Much of the debate in a campaign is not about particular issues , it is about which issue the voter ought to have uppermost in his or her mind when they cast their ballot . If crime is the top issue , Republicans will do_better . If education is the top issue , Democrats will do_better . That is because of voters ' preconceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of the two political_parties . So I would urge undecided voters to avoid being drawn_in by the emotion-laden symbols they will see in Republican ads during the remaining days of the campaign . HOFFENBLUM : Give me a break . That is nothing more_than partisan , elitist drivel . When a conservative attempts to have a rational debate on governmental policies pertaining to education or senior_citizens or welfare reform , what do we hear from your candidates ? Not debate , but baseless charges that we are anti-education , anti-seniors and insensitive to the problems of the disadvantaged . SRAGOW : You said it . I didn ' t . In any case , I don ' t think we have found scare symbols to match Willie Horton . We just appeal_to the voters ' better instincts . HOFFENBLUM : I can go tit_for_tat with you , if you want , on truthful political advertising that has an emotional impact . Democrats use the same techniques . SRAGOW : Let me tell you what I think the key problem is . In a state this big , voters have no hope of talking directly with the candidates . They have to rely_on bits and pieces of information that appear fleetingly on TV or radio or in their mailbox . Most of those pieces of information are paid_for by the candidates . You and I are confirming that those advertisements are often suspect . So the question is , what information can a voter trust ? In the long term , I ' m convinced that we need to force the broadcast industry , which , after all , uses the public airways to make a profit , to provide us with more direct access to candidates . But in the next 10 days , I can only confirm that the basic rule is &quot; voter beware. &quot; HOFFENBLUM : Amen .</TEXT>
