   <HEADLINE> JURY PICKED FOR HEIDI FLEISS ' TRIAL ON PANDERING , DRUG COUNTS ; COURT : OPENING ARGUMENTS ARE SET FOR MONDAY . ALLEGED ' MADAM TO THE STARS ' FACES_UP TO 12 YEARS IN PRISON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A jury of five women and seven men was seated Thursday in the trial of alleged Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss on charges of pandering and possession of cocaine . One potential juror was excused by the defense after he stated that prostitution is forbidden in the Bible , but the prosecution had no objection to the seating of an alternate juror who said he thought prostitution should be legalized . Fleiss faces_up to 12 years in prison if convicted . Opening arguments in the Los Angeles Superior_Court trial are scheduled for Monday morning . Donald Marks , one of Fleiss ' lawyers , said the possibility that his client was entrapped in an improper sting operation &quot; is clearly going_to be something discussed in the trial. &quot; Touted as the &quot; madam to the stars , &quot; the 28-year-old high_school dropout was first arrested last year after she allegedly provided cocaine and four prostitutes to a &quot; Japanese businessman &quot; who turned_out to be an undercover Beverly Hills police_officer . Then , last August , she and her 60-year-old father , pediatrician Paul Fleiss , were arrested on federal charges of tax_evasion and money_laundering -- for allegedly hiding hundreds of thousands of dollars from Heidi Fleiss ' purported prostitution ring . A month later , she was arrested for a third time , for violating the terms of her $ 50 # 000 bail in the federal case by testing positive for drugs six times since the August arrest . The drugs involved were Valium and methamphetamines , according to Assistant U.S. Atty . Mark Holscher . On Sept . 26 , she was transferred from the Downtown federal Metropolitan Detention Center to Impact House , a drug treatment and rehabilitation center in Pasadena , where she is a residential patient . Jury selection in the trial before Judge Judith Champagne began last week . A 15-page questionnaire was handed_out to the 65 prospective jurors , and court was adjourned until Monday so lawyers could review their responses . Although eclipsed by the O.J. Simpson trial , the Heidi Fleiss case -- which centers_on charges that she ran a glamorous call_girl service that catered to the rich and famous -- has generated considerable interest . That interest has been heightened by speculation that Fleiss eventually may open her &quot; black_book , &quot; disclosing the names of clients , who are said to include entertainment_industry executives and jet-set glitterati . The federal trial is scheduled to start Jan 24 .</TEXT>
