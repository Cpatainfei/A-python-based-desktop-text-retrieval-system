   <HEADLINE> THE WORLD ; WHY MORE ' NORMAL ' TIMES MAY UNDO YELTSIN ' S FUTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Early autumn seems to be a season of discontent for Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin . Three years after the failed communist coup , and almost exactly a year since the violent confrontation between Yeltsin and the reactionary Soviet-era Parliament , the fate of the Russian government is once again under a cloud . Last week , the administration of Viktor S . Chernomyrdin , Yeltsin ' s prime_minister , narrowly survived a no-confidence vote_in the state Duma . Still , the omens are far from favorable to the current government . A recent string of ecological , economic and foreign-policy messes ensures that the Duma , which in the best of times is hostile to the executive , will continue to subject Chernomyrdin and his patron to a withering attack . The recent oil spill in northern Russia could not , therefore , have come at a worse time politically . The dimensions of the disaster are staggering : more_than 2 million barrels of oil , representing both millions of dollars in lost revenue and vast ecological damage , have oozed into the delicate Arctic ecosystem . As the oil spreads , one early report holds that it has already covered an area equal_to that of the city of St . Petersburg . Unfortunately , it is quite possible that the Russian government has understated the dimensions of the spill . Cleanup will be difficult . The Russian oil_industry , never well-equipped , has been run_down during the last decade ; it simply lacks the tools and skills necessary to combat a disaster of such dimensions . Furthermore , the terrain and climate inhibit a rapid or comprehensive cleanup . Spilling from several holes in a pipeline , hot oil has spread_over delicate Arctic permafrost ; as it does so , it melts and permeates the frozen earth , which will then refreeze , leaving the oil locked deep into the ground . It ' s hard to imagine that containment efforts will be able to prevent large amounts of oil from leaking into the Pechora river , which flows into the Barents Sea . The disaster is especially damaging to the government , because it can rightly be blamed for reacting too slowly . The breaks_in the pipeline occurred some months ago ; yet , the still-nationalized Russian oil_industry tried only lackadaisically to contain the spill with a makeshift , and apparently inadequate , dam that subsequently burst during rainstorms . Also , anti-government politicians will surely contend , misleadingly but perhaps effectively , that budget_cuts are responsible_for equipment_failures in the oil_industry . Ecological disaster in the north , far away from population centers , might be forgiven if Russians believed that the economy was getting better ; but they do not . Recent polls show that almost 90 % of Russians feel that the economy is calamitous . And yet , the situation is more complex than that grim statistic would suggest . In the same poll , some three-quarters of Russians indicated that their personal economic situation is not too_bad . The government ' s dilemma is that it gets none of the credit for individuals ' personal feelings of well-being but is blamed for the pervasive sense of crisis . Much of the blame for this widespread alarm about the economy must rest with Chernomyrdin , who comes from the old Soviet managerial class and has been reluctant to cut subsidies to failing state firms . As a result , the state prints ever more worthless rubles , adding_to inflation and spawning the precipitous drop of the ruble , which fell_in value versus a none-too-healthy dollar by 47 % between Sept . 1 and Oct . 11 , falling 22 % on that last_day alone . Although the ruble quickly recovered much of its value , the political damage had been done . Chernomyrdin appeared weak , foreign investors were scared and the public wondered who was running the ship . Unlike most of the successor states to the old Soviet_Union , Russia has managed to avoid hyperinflation , and the drive for privatization is at last producing results . For the first time since the Bolsheviks created the planned economy , more_than half of Russia ' s gross_domestic_product is now produced by the private sector . Military spending has shrunk more dramatically than anyone had a right to hope , and unemployment is officially at 6 % of the work_force . But these successes are overshadowed by the roller-coaster ruble and by the only partly justified , but widespread , belief that those benefiting most from the market_economy are organized-crime bosses . Crime is the principal civic concern of most Russians , as numerous polls attest . The murder rate in Moscow is now not much better than in New York , something once almost unthinkable . Muggings are so common , and the perpetrators so infrequently caught , that most attacks are not even reported to the police . Virtually everyone one talks to believes that crime syndicates control much of economic activity , and , although this is not entirely true , it is true enough ; the resultant despair further undermines the government ' s programs . If Russians feel that the ground is slipping from beneath their feet at_home , they get little solace from foreign affairs . Most Russians now believe that their country has surrendered enough and the time has come_to assert Russian national interests . The recent withdrawal of Russian troops from Germany , though not seriously opposed by any responsible group , added_to the general sense of Russian humiliation . Even the liberal Nezavisimaia gazetta ran a front-page photo of a ragged old Russian woman and her bags being pushed in a luggage cart by a smiling German porter under the headline &quot; Russia leaves Germany. &quot; The same paper reported widespread disaffection within the army . Junior officers are looking_to leave the ranks at the earliest possible time , believing that the army has no future . Those between the ranks of major and major-general are too old for new careers , they distrust the market_economy and 40 % of them support &quot; radical patriotic ideas. &quot; Yeltsin and his foreign_minister , Andrei V . Kozyrev , have responded to this changing mood by turning Russian foreign_policy toward a more nationalist course . Thus , the recent attempt to &quot; mediate &quot; between the United States and that old Soviet client Saddam Hussein . This also explains the greater assertiveness shown by the Russian military in the so-called &quot; near abroad , &quot; or former republics of the Soviet_Union , especially Chechenya , Georgia and Tadjikistan . Where is Yeltsin in all this ? It is now becoming clear that he is a man of crisis ; the day-to-day drudgery of governing bores him , as he disarmingly admits in his autobiographical work &quot; The Struggle for Russia. &quot; &quot; In emergency situations , &quot; he writes , &quot; I ' m strong . In ordinary situations , I ' m sometimes too passive. &quot; The problem is , Russia politics are becoming more &quot; normal , &quot; despite the current spate of problems . At several critical_points in his career , Yeltsin has shown himself to be a man of courage , even moral vision ; it would be a shame if his inattention to vital details should undermine the place he has already earned in history. *</TEXT>
