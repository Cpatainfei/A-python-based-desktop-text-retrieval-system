   <HEADLINE> METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF : PASADENA ; JPL STRUCTURES DEDICATED AS HISTORIC LANDMARKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three structures that have helped NASA vault unmanned craft into space , two of them in Pasadena , became national historic landmarks Monday . The dedication was held at one of the landmarks : the Space Flight Operations Facility , which serves as mission control_center for NASA ' s Jet_Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.It was built_in 1963 . &quot; The scale of achievements of NASA ' s planetary exploration program over the past 30 years is astounding , &quot; David E . Gackenbach , superintendent of the National_Park_Service , said at the ceremony . &quot; Our efforts to land a man on the moon , investigate the near-Earth environment and explore the planets and the solar_system were supported from a technological base that reflected a depth and variety of support facilities unprecedented in American history. &quot; The second new landmark , the space simulator , was built at JPL in 1962 . It tested the spacecraft that made the first successful interplanetary flight to Venus on Aug . 27 , 1962 . It is the only NASA facility that can replicate the conditions of cold , solar_radiation and an extreme vacuum to test spacecraft . The third is the 85-foot Pioneer Station antenna at the Goldstone Tracking Station near Barstow , the first antenna in the worldwide Deep_Space Network , which began operating in December , 1958 . It was named for the Pioneer , the first U.S. spacecraft to escape Earth ' s gravity . JPL developed and operates the Deep_Space Network for NASA . Although the accepted threshold for considering a property historic is that it be at least 50 years old , the three structures ' &quot; exceptional significance in the history of space exploration qualifies them for landmark status , &quot; Gackenbach said .</TEXT>
