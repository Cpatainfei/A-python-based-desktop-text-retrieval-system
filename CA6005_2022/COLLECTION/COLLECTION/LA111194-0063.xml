   <HEADLINE> SRI LANKAN PREMIER ' S PRESIDENTIAL VICTORY A LANDSLIDE ; ELECTION : CHANDRIKA KUMARATUNGA IS FIRST WOMAN TO ATTAIN TOP POST . SHE PLEDGES TO PURSUE PEACE WITH TAMIL REBELS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Buoyed by a landslide margin of nearly 2 million votes , President-elect Chandrika Kumaratunga on Thursday claimed a &quot; clear and massive mandate &quot; to press_on with her quest_for a peaceful end to Sri Lanka ' s 11-year civil_war . In a ballot-box rout that political observers said is without precedent in this Indian_Ocean island ' s history , Kumaratunga , the prime_minister from the left-leaning People ' s Alliance , emerged victorious in a six-way race , beating her closest rival from the main opposition United National Party by 4 # 709 , 205 votes to 2 # 715 , 283 , official results showed . Her 62.28 % score in her successful bid for the powerful executive presidency was the crescendo of an electoral career that began in_earnest only in May of last year , when the 49-year-old daughter of two former Sri Lankan prime_ministers scored an upset victory in a provincial council election . This August , the widowed mother of two led the People ' s Alliance to a narrow win in national parliamentary elections , ending a 17-year chokehold on power by the UNP , which had used murder and mob violence to safeguard its rule . &quot; We , I think , have come_to the end of the dark tunnel , and we are marching toward a new era of freedom and light , &quot; said an emotional Kumaratunga , clad in a blue and white sari , after Wednesday ' s election results were announced . But the president-elect warned supporters that even if they suffered when the UNP held power , she will not brook any revenge-seeking . &quot; It is true that for 17 long years you have bottled_up the anger of much political victimization and harassment , &quot; Kumaratunga said . &quot; But the answer to that is not to repeat the same barbaric style of acting. &quot; After a violence-marred campaign , an island-wide curfew starting at 2 p.m. was imposed for the second straight day Thursday to prevent further disorder , and the rain-lashed streets of this seaside capital were practically devoid_of cars and pedestrians . After the Oct . 24 assassination of her principal opponent , Gamini Dissanayake , the pivotal issue of the presidential campaign became the policy of Kumaratunga ' s 2 1 / 2-month-old government toward the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , who control enclaves in the east and the northern Jaffna peninsula . They are widely suspected of carrying_out Dissanayake ' s murder . In an overt bid for the sympathy vote of members of the island ' s Buddhist Sinhalese majority , the UNP put_up the slain Parliament member ' s 51-year-old widow , attorney Srima Dissanayake , as its candidate . In its crudest campaign rhetoric , it also told Sri Lankans that a vote for Kumaratunga would be a vote for the Liberation Tigers . The huge majority the prime_minister won in the so-called battle of the widows showed that the UNP gambit miscarried badly . The main opposition party lost in all 22 polling districts , whereas Kumaratunga garnered a clear majority among all main voter groups : the Sinhalese , Muslims and Hindu Tamils . Her mother , Sirimavo Bandaranaike , was Sri Lanka ' s first female prime_minister , and now Kumaratunga will become this country ' s first female president . Last month , she sent emissaries to Jaffna to begin the Sri Lankan government ' s first contacts in more_than four years with the Liberation Tigers . After Dissanayake ' s death , she broke_off the preliminary talks until possible rebel responsibility could be probed . Her government has been scrupulously careful not to pin responsibility for the suicide bombing that killed Dissanayake and 54 others on the Liberation Tigers . Just as prudently , Kumaratunga did not say Thursday whether she intends to resume the talks , or what she will do if the insurgents ' complicity in the killings is proved . But she said she is as determined as ever to forge ahead with the &quot; peace process &quot; to end the ethnic war that has claimed more_than 30 # 000 lives since 1983 . &quot; We shall take this as a clear mandate from you , the people of this country , the Sinhalese Buddhist majority , and all_the other people living_in this country , belonging_to all races , to all religions , to all communities , for our government to forge ahead with peace , &quot; she said . &quot; But not peace at any cost ; negotiated peace where the rights of the majority Sinhalese people would be safeguarded and strengthened , but where we would build a society where all_the peoples of this country could live with equal rights , without fear and in brotherhood and with freedom. &quot; The sentiments of Tamils in lands controlled by the Liberation Tigers were unknown , as the guerrillas did not allow them to vote . The war also continued , impervious to the election , with a clash reported in the northern town of Penilankulam in which two rebels were slain by government soldiers . Both Kumaratunga ' s father , former Prime_Minister Solomon Dias Bandaranaike , and her actor-politician husband , Vijaya Kumaratunga , died at the hands of assassins . Her victory , Kumaratunga said , &quot; is the victory of millions of people in this country who watched and waited in silence during nearly two decades of harassment , political victimization , of state terror and violence. &quot; She is expected to be sworn_in Saturday as successor to outgoing President Dingiri Banda Wijetunga of the UNP , and in theory could serve for six years . But on Thursday , she repeated a pledge to abolish the powerful office she had just won , and set herself a deadline of July 15 . Kumaratunga has said the executive presidency created in 1978 is a temptation to the abuse of power , and that most of its functions should be transferred to the Parliament , prime_minister or Cabinet .</TEXT>
