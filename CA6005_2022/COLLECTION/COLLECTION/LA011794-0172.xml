   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : PORT HUENEME ; PUBLIC INVITED ON HIGH-TECH NAVY DESTROYER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For Joe Silva , Sunday ' s tour of the Navy destroyer USS Merrill was an event that caused the 70-year-old former Navy signalman to reflect on his service during World_War_II and later during the Korean conflict . Silva , on vacation from Brookings , Ore. , said he read about the Spruance-class destroyer ' s open_house in a local newspaper and knew that he had to take one of the 45-minute tours of the warship docked at the Naval Construction Battalion Center in Port Hueneme on Saturday and Sunday . &quot; This thing gave me the shivers , &quot; Silva said . &quot; The technology inside this vessel is nothing short of amazing . We were throwing rocks at the enemy compared to what this thing can do. &quot; The open_house was a part of the Merrill ' s stop at the Naval Surface Warfare Center -- a tenant command at the Seabee Center that helps engineer and test weapons_systems , according to Terri Reid , a Navy spokeswoman . Cmdr . Steven Busch , the Merrill ' s skipper , said he was impressed by the level of questions from visitors . &quot; I ' ve been impressed by the turnout and by their interest in the detailed workings of the ship , &quot; Busch said . &quot; It ' s been fun to show the public exactly what their tax dollars have purchased. &quot; After waiting in a dockside line that stretched_along half of the Merrill ' s 563-foot length , visitors were taken aboard the high-tech destroyer for the tour that gave them rare glimpses of a warship ' s combat information center -- a below-decks room where the ship ' s automated weapons and radar systems are controlled and monitored . The tour also included stops on the ship ' s bridge , its missile bays , its two automated five-inch deck guns and an aft hangar that houses two attack helicopters . Busch said the Merrill , based in San Diego and commissioned in 1976 , is the first destroyer to fire a Tomahawk missile . Its primary mission as a warship is to hunt_down and destroy enemy submarines , but it has also served tours_of_duty in the war-torn Mediterranean and most recently in narcotics search_missions with other federal agencies . For the past 15 months , the vessel has been in port during retrofit operations . Thousand Oaks resident Roy Lewis , 44 , said that when he heard about the public visitation on a local TV_station , he jumped at the chance to go aboard . &quot; You don ' t everyday get a chance to see a ship like this up close , &quot; Lewis said . &quot; I was very impressed. &quot; J .
