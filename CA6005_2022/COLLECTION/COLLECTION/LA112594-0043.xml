   <HEADLINE> GROUP OF VIRUSES TIED TO TYPE OF DIABETES ; SCIENCE : INSULIN-DEPENDENT FORM OF THE DISEASE MAY BE TRIGGERED IN GENETICALLY SUSCEPTIBLE PEOPLE BY POLIO-RELATED AGENTS , RESEARCHERS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> UCLA and Florida researchers have produced strong new evidence implicating a common class of viruses in causing Type 1 , or insulin-dependent , diabetes -- a discovery that could eventually lead to new ways of preventing the disease that affects as_many as 1 million Americans . Type 1 diabetes occurs when the body ' s immune_system attacks and destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas . Researchers know that only people with a specific genetic profile are susceptible to this autoimmune attack , but there has been great debate about the identity of the agent that triggers the immune_reaction . Now , two studies in this month ' s issues of the Journal of Experimental Medicine and the Journal of Clinical Investigation strongly implicate Coxsackie viruses , polio-related viruses that cause upper respiratory infections . One report shows that Coxsackie viruses trigger diabetes in genetically susceptible mice but not in those that have a different genetic profile . The second study demonstrates that the autoimmune reaction is triggered by a similarity between a Coxsackie virus protein and a protein in the pancreas . The two studies provide &quot; a strong case of guilt_by_association , &quot; said UCLA molecular biologist Daniel L . Kaufman . &quot; It ' s only inferential data so far , but it ' s pretty strong inferential data , &quot; added Dr. Noel Maclaren of the University of Florida . &quot; I think the case is really seriously beginning to build &quot; that Coxsackie viruses are the key triggering agent . If the viruses are shown to be a primary cause of the disease , vaccines against them could probably prevent diabetes , the researchers said . But &quot; before we can start working_on such a vaccine , we need to have a fairly clear smoking gun &quot; strongly confirming that the viruses cause diabetes , said Dr. Joan Harmon , director of the Diabetes Research Program at the National Institutes of Health . Researchers have a 30-year history of interest in Coxsackie viruses as a diabetes cause . Epidemiological studies in the 1960s , for example , showed that Coxsackie outbreaks in various regions were followed by an increased incidence of diabetes . Studies also showed that perhaps 60 % of newly diagnosed diabetics had antibodies to the virus . More recently , researchers such_as Maclaren and his Florida colleague , Mark Atkinson , have demonstrated that people in the very earliest stages of diabetes have antibodies against a specific protein , subsequently shown by Kaufman and others to be an enzyme called glutamic_acid decarboxylase , or GAD . Three years ago , Kaufman and Allen J . Tobin of UCLA demonstrated that a small segment of GAD is structurally similar to a segment of a Coxsackie protein . Their interpretation was that when the immune_system attacks this viral protein in fighting_off a Coxsackie infection , it also inadvertently attacks GAD , which is found on the surface of insulin-secreting pancreas cells . Ultimately the cells are destroyed and diabetes results . The new papers buttress this hypothesis . Maclaren and Atkinson wanted to show that the structural similarity between the two proteins was not simply coincidence . To achieve that , they broke the GAD molecule down into 36 shorter fragments , one of them the segment similar to the Coxsackie protein . When they exposed blood from several patients in the early stages of diabetes to each of these fragments , they observed that the anti-GAD antibodies strongly attacked the segment similar to the viral protein and reacted only weakly with the other fragments . This reinforced the idea that the attack on GAD was triggered by a Coxsackie infection . To further explore this relationship , Kaufman and his colleagues exposed two types of mice -- one group that was genetically susceptible to Type 1 diabetes and one that was not -- to a Coxsackie virus . They found that , shortly after the infection , the susceptible group developed antibodies not only against the Coxsackie protein but also against GAD . The mice then developed diabetes . The non-susceptible mice , in contrast , developed antibodies only against the viral protein and did not develop diabetes . Because the genes that control diabetes susceptibility in mice are similar to those in humans , Kaufman said , the observation suggests that Coxsackie viruses can trigger the disease in humans as well . The researchers agreed , however , that further studies will be necessary to actually prove that Coxsackie viruses cause the disease . Maclaren cautioned that Coxsackie viruses may_not be the cause of all Type 1 diabetes . About one in every five diabetics , he noted , does not produce an immune_response to GAD , and the disease in those cases may have been triggered by some_other agent . Possible triggers that have received a lot of attention include the nitrosamines used as a food preservative and a protein in cow ' s milk . &quot; We ' re really homing_in on the cause of this disease , &quot; said Dr. Richard Kahn , vice_president for research at the American Cancer Society . &quot; This could very well be the major , perhaps the only , environmental trigger for diabetes . &quot;</TEXT>
