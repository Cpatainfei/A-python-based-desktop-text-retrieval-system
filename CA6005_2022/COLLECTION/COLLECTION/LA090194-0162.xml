   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; COMING OF AGE AT CITY_HALL ; POLITICS : FROM 26-YEAR-OLD CITY_COUNCIL NOVICE TO SUPERVISOR , IT ' S BEEN ' MIND-BOGGLING ' TO YAROSLAVSKY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Los Angeles City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky , whose district in cludes Bel-Air , Century City , the Fairfax district and Westwood , was elected to the County Board of Supervisors in June and will take_office in December . During his two decades on the council , Yaroslavsky gained notoriety for calling_for more aggressive oversight of the Los Angeles Police_Department and pushing measures to limit commercial development in the city and block oil drilling off Pacific Palisades . His wife , Barbara , recently confirmed she would seek her husband ' s council seat . Question : Talk_about the job at City_Hall . Yaroslavsky : I ' m going_to miss City_Hall . I don ' t think there ' s a more challenging job in politics than being a member of a local city_council . A Los Angeles council_member can be involved in every aspect of the city . To be elected to the governing body of the second-largest city in the United States at 26 years of_age was mind-boggling . This would n ' t have happened in Europe . In most parliamentary systems in the world , it ' s not until you are 20 or 25 years into adulthood that you get that kind of opportunity . Q : You ' ve hobnobbed with the rich and famous , including President Nixon ' s chief_of_staff , Bob Haldeman , who once called_on you to ask_for support in obtaining a building variance in Westwood for a client . A : I said , &quot; Bob , I don ' t think we ' ll have a problem with this , but I want one thing in return. &quot; And his eyes lit_up . &quot; Well , what is it , councilman ? &quot; &quot; I ' d like to go_out to lunch with you and spend two hours talking_about Nixon. &quot; That was the condition . And he said , &quot; Oh , I ' d be delighted. &quot; So we met at the Marquis hotel in Westwood for lunch . A very , very interesting guy . Totally different from the impression I had from reading about him . The variance was going_to be fixed anyway . It was not a substantive variance , trust me . Q : What were your first days in office like ? A : My colleagues were quite good to me . They treated me as an equal . There were people here who were old enough to be my grandfather or my parents . Some of my worst adversaries even gave me a lot of slack . The first vote I cast was to cut_off a debate , and I voted no . I thought we were voting on the substance of the issue . The vote was 14-1 , and I was the one vote . I later got a copy of the roll_call sheet as a souvenir . A few months later , I got involved in the Robert F . Kennedy assassination investigation , and my first major legislative_act was to put_in a motion to establish an ad_hoc committee to investigate how the assassination had been handled by the police . It was very controversial , and I hustled to get the votes . Council President John Gibson then appointed the members to the committee , and he was kind enough to appoint me to it . But the four others were totally uncooperative . So it was a Pyrrhic_victory , if you will . I learned a lot that summer . Q : Whom will you miss most ? A : The person I really respected personally , not in a political sense but a personal one , was Ernie Bernardi . ( Longtime Councilman Ernani Bernardi left_office in 1993. ) This was a man with a_level of personal integrity that I aspired to . I wrote him a note on his last_day in office , saying something to the effect that I loved him like I loved my father . And I really meant it . He walked over to me afterward and said that in 32 years at City_Hall , that was the nicest thing anyone had ever said to him . For all his craziness and his habit of pressing the &quot; no &quot; button , we ' ve all come_around to his way of thinking on many things . Q : You made a last-minute decision not to challenge Mayor Tom Bradley ' s bid for a fifth term in 1989 . Subsequently , Bradley became enmeshed in a scandal about his personal finances and only narrowly escaped being thrown into a runoff election . Do you have any regrets about the decision ? A : No , I never regretted it . I don ' t think anyone will ever understand why I pulled_out until I sit them down and relate the chronology . I wasn ' t going_to do a kamikaze attack . I didn ' t want out of government bad enough to put it all on the line in what I thought was a futile effort to unseat the mayor . Most people today look_at what happened and for them the timing is blurred . Given what I knew on Jan . 8 , or whatever it was , I made the right decision . But I ' ll tell you this , I have thought_about what would have happened if I ' d won and we had had the civil disturbance we had in 1992 and the Rodney King fiasco in 1991 . It could ' ve been a hellish existence . Q : How was it possible for the city -- and its elected leadership -- to wake_up one day and find itself with a Police_Department that was seemingly out of control , abusive and racist ? A : I think it was a failure of all_the elected and appointed people who had oversight over the Los Angeles Police_Department , particularly the Police Commission . I took_on the Police_Department . I took them on over the Public Disorder Intelligence Division and over police use of the chokehold , and I paid a price for it . The Police Protective League would n ' t even endorse me in one election where I ran unopposed . And Daryl Gates vilified me publicly -- at a time when he was popular . And all that sent a signal to every City_Council member . I think all_the people , the mayor , the Police Commission , said : &quot; I don ' t want to be in Yaroslavsky ' s shoes. &quot; But I was fortunate because I had a district that backed me up . I didn ' t represent Chatsworth or Tujunga . I had a district that was ready to back_up a legitimate , aggressive look_at the Police_Department . Q : Did Tom Bradley ' s political history blind his Administration to police abuses ? A : Before Tom Bradley was elected in 1973 , he had been defeated four years earlier by Sam Yorty . Most people will say that Tom Bradley ' s loss in 1969 was_due in large measure to Yorty ' s successful attack , claiming that Tom Bradley was going_to turn the Police_Department upside down . I think Tom Bradley and Sam Williams ( Bradley ' s longtime Police Commission member ) had the 1969 defeat seared into their psyches . And they did everything in their power to avoid a public confrontation between Tom Bradley and the police . Most politicians will not admit to this , but they cannot afford to do battle with their police_departments . . . . I ' ve never said this before , but during the city ' s recent contract dispute with the police I had three flat_tires of my city car in my driveway . I can ' t prove who did_it . Alicia Katz , my deputy , had an industrial-sized thumbtack put sharp-end-up on the seat on her city car right in the middle of this thing . Fortunately , she saw it before she sat_down . There was a lot of funny business going_around . I voted against the contract . I thought it was a bad deal , and I didn ' t think the overall aura of intimidation should be rewarded -- Jeff Garfield , the union ' s representative , saying they were going_to dig_up dirt on the mayor and the council . That was extortion . That was a threat . In fact , the city attorney wrote a memo to the City_Council saying that might have been a violation of the law . Q : What ' s it like to represent the 5th District , which encompasses Fairfax , Westwood , Bel-Air , Sherman Oaks and Van Nuys ? A : It is the most politically challenging district in the city . Everybody in my district reads excessively about mundane things like local_government . Everybody is involved in a neighborhood and active in their neighborhood association . Golda Meir ( the former Israeli prime_minister ) once said when she was asked what it was like to be the head of a nation of 4 million people : &quot; I ' m prime_minister of 4 million prime ministers. &quot; I ' d have to say I ' m councilman of 300 # 000 council_members . Everybody thinks -- and with some justification -- that they can do the job as well as if not better than the incumbent . Q : What have you liked least about the job ? A : The loss of privacy -- for my family , principally , not so_much for me . My daughter has told me -- and she ' ll probably kill me if she reads this -- that sometimes she ' d rather not be known as Zev Yaroslavsky ' s daughter . And she shouldn ' t be , and my wife should not be known as Zev Yaroslavsky ' s wife . But actually there are very few downsides to this job . Q : What did you think_of Ed Davis , former police_chief and former state_senator from the San Fernando Valley ? A : Ed Davis and I have become good friends . In retrospect , when I have a chance to compare him with his successor , he was a pretty darned good chief of police . He never once threatened me or disrespected me in any way . I was a 26-year-old snot-nosed kid . I can see now how Davis would have been right in saying : &quot; Who is this punk , just out of college , telling me , a police_officer for 25 years , what to do ? &quot; But he didn ' t . Now Daryl Gates did have that attitude . Q : Do you have a favorite accomplishment ? A : For pure satisfaction , other_than my first election , there was nothing to compare to the political satisfaction of winning Proposition O ( a 1988 city ballot measure to bar Occidental Petroleum from drilling in Pacific Palisades ) . We were outspent $ 10 million to $ 3 million . We had a little help from an oil_rig explosion in the North_Sea that summer . After all this , ( Occidental Chairman ) Armand Hammer and I became buddies again . Q : Armand Hammer was a fierce adversary of yours . A : Proposition O was an absolute war with him . But a_few months after the election and we had won , I got a call to meet with Armand Hammer to discuss his plans to build an art museum in Westwood . After a while , he said , &quot; I want to talk to you alone. &quot; He asked what my plans were . He said , &quot; Anything you ever want to do , you can count_on me as a friend and supporter . I really think you would ' ve made a great mayor. &quot; I asked him , &quot; Are you going_to have a birthday_party this year , Dr. Hammer ? &quot; And he said , ' Yes , as a matter of fact. &quot; And I said , &quot; I ' d like to come. &quot; In his later years , he celebrated his birthdays with a big bash where he ' d bring Mstislav Rostropovich , the cellist , to town , and he ' d usually play Tchaikovsky ' s &quot; Variations on a Rococo Theme &quot; and Dvorak ' s cello concerto , two of my absolutely favorite pieces_of_music . I used to get invited to these bashes until I voted against his oil-drilling deal . Then I was off the list . So my wife and I went . These were a_thousand of Hammer ' s closest personal friends and we ' d just cleaned his clock_on the Prop . O campaign . If looks could kill that evening , I was dead 100 times over . But I did hear Rostropovich . Q : Another top accomplishment ? A : Lately I ' m very proud_of the work I ' ve done to hire more women police_officers . People have stereotypes about what their cops should be . They think they all should be like Kent McCord ( star of the TV series &quot; Adam 12 &quot; ) . But that ' s not what policing in the next century needs . We ' ve set some goals for hiring women . It ' s going_to be good for the city . They ' ll lower our exposure on police use-of-force cases , and they ' ll do much more for us as well . Q : Your wife ( has ) confirmed that she will seek your council seat . Is this the makings of a political dynasty ? A : No , the people who know Barbara Yaroslavsky know she has as individual a mind as there is , and certainly that has been the case over 23 years of marriage . She has her views , which are very much hers . Believe it or not , we don ' t spend a lot of time talking_about politics and government , which is probably why our marriage has lasted 23 years . I guess it ' s a natural question to raise . You would not ask that question of a man , but some ask that of a woman . Can a woman succeed her husband in a political job ? In a way it ' s demeaning . She has got her own record . She is_on the board of the L.A. Free Clinic , the Parents Advisory Council ( and several other community , religious and educational organizations ) ; she is an incredibly active person . She has got a following . She is very much her own person and I think that will become evident in the campaign . She is not going_to inherit any seat . For those people who think she is going_to be a rubber_stamp for me , it ' s time for them to get_in the ' 90s and recognize spouses are not puppets . They are going_to be sorely surprised by the independence of this candidacy . This is a very strong individual with instincts that are second to none . She is going_to have to go_out there and run from scratch . In the final analysis , people should evaluate her not on who her spouse is but who she is , and if people evaluate her on who she is then she should get more votes than I did .
