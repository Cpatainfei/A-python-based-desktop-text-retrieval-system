   <TEXT> Judith Bell ' s &quot; Pilgrims ' Progress &quot; ( Nov . 20 ) was a delight . For those who have been to Amsterdam , but want to return , it is definitely a keeper in the &quot; Future Travels &quot; file.Having said that , however , I would have liked the map to include the names of the countries outlined on the Baltic_Sea . Putting the names of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania on the map would help educate your readers about an area more aligned with Europe than the other countries in the former Soviet empire . Estonia and her Baltic neighbors welcome visitors and have much history to share with the world . Having been to Estonia six times in the last three years , I would like everyone in our country to read pieces such_as this one , about the rich culture at this place that was buried for 50 years by political oppression . How about starting with a map so others know where to find them ? BARBARA HINTON La Jolla Your article brought_back many wonderful memories of the period I lived_in Delft in 1993 . My apartment overlooked the very canal on which the Pilgrims must have traveled_to get from Leiden to Delfshaven before beginning their journey to the New World . As is evident from the name , Delfshaven was Delft ' s remote harbor at a time when it was an important center of commerce ( much as San Pedro is Los Angeles ' harbor ) . Now a quiet oasis and a delightful place to spend a_few hours in the middle of bustling Rotterdam , Delfshaven maintained its independent status until swallowed_up by Rotterdam in the late 19th Century .
