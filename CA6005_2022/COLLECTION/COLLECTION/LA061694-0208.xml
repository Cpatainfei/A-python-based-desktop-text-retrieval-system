   <HEADLINE> INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE : MONOPOLIES WOULD GAIN EVEN TIGHTER GRIP WITH SPRINT DEAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Excuse me , is there an echo on this line ? Barely a year ago , British Telecom announced that it would invest $ 5 billion to buy a 20 % stake in MCI . Now Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom -- Europe ' s largest state-run telecommunications monopolies -- say they ' re prepared to ante_up $ 4.2 billion for a comparable share of Sprint . ( You remember Sprint -- the No . 3 long-distance company that has apparently recovered well from having the merger hots for Electronic Data Services. ) What ' s next ? Japan ' s Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone investing $ 10 billion for a fifth of AT &amp; T ? Apparently , imitation is the most sincere form of flattery when you ' re trying to build a global telecommunications network . A Sprint stake unquestionably gives the two telecommunications giants a tremendous opportunity to grow in the United States . &quot; In a sense , it ' s an encouraging move for us , &quot; a British Telecom spokesman says . &quot; It very much vindicates our strategic view of the world. &quot; But watch those stiff upper lips tremble with outrage when the conversation turns_to telecommunications politics . Britain ' s telecom mandarins are stunned by the sheer gall of the_French and German monopolies in bidding billions for Sprint as they piously proclaim the relative openness of_their_own networks . that ' s utter nonsense , say the Brits , and the United States would be crazy to believe it . &quot; We will be absolutely amazed if your Department_of_Justice and the Federal Communications Commission let this deal go_through without getting tremendously huge changes and concessions from both France and Germany in the accessibility of their telecommunications markets , &quot; the spokesman says . By any measure , Britain ' s telecom marketplace is now among the most open and competitive in the world . The Baby Bells actually have greater freedom to cut deals and forge alliances here than they do_in America . In fact , foreign telephone_companies here actually offer cable_television_service , and cable TV companies have begun to offer telephone_service -- just what America ' s cable TV and telephone_companies are clamoring to do back home . ( That British consumers are often less than thrilled with the quality of these hybrid services is seen as beside the point. ) The U.S. Justice_Department approved British Telecom ' s bid to buy_into MCI in large part because the_British telecommunications market invites and encourages competition from the world over . By contrast , &quot; both France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom are monopolists , &quot; says the_British Telecom spokesman , &quot; and we would think that should be a handicap in their efforts to gain approval for their proposal. &quot; AT &amp; T -- no stranger to monopoly -- has similarly criticized the proposed European investment in Sprint . Is all this just corporate posturing by nervous competitors who are greedily eyeing each other ' s markets ? Or are there genuine economic and regulatory principles at stake ? There should be no doubt : British Telecom and AT &amp; T are absolutely right in opposing this deal , and if the Clinton_Administration ' s trustbusters aren ' t too busy figuring_out ingenious ways to break_up Microsoft , they should make_it clear that state-sanctioned multibillion-dollar monopolies do not gain easy access to a competitive American market . Why should a Franco-German alliance be allowed to practice as a predatory monopolist and use the revenue gained from its home markets -- Germany and France are the two largest telecommunications markets in Europe -- to subsidize a Sprint in competition with AT &amp; T and MCI in America and the rest of the ( deregulated ) world ? That is a totally unfair competitive advantage . Indeed , you could make a case that the_French and Germans can easily afford to invest more_than $ 4 billion for a piece of Sprint precisely because they pass along any costs to their captive subscribers . Monopolies are good at that . Just ask the folks who ran the old Bell system . The sad truth is that , while Europe is supposed to become a single market , telecommunications was granted an exemption by the European Union until 1998 at the earliest . In other words , the_French and German telecommunications monopolies are trying to exploit a loophole in the rules to secure an unfair competitive advantage in what will be a $ 300-billion market by the end of the decade . Particularly annoying , of course , is the stubborn insistence by the_French and Germans that their telecommunications markets are open . As any multinational company in those countries will tell you , France and Germany are hostile to innovations introduced from outside ; their prices are outrageously high , and there isn ' t even domestic competition to look_to for relief . If the Clinton_Administration really cares about free and fair trade , it will take this opportunity to get a schedule of market access in France and Germany before allowing a Sprint investment . Or better yet , let Sprint take the money -- just don ' t allow anyone from France Telecom or Deutsche Telekom to serve on the Sprint board or exercise any sort of management influence .</TEXT>
