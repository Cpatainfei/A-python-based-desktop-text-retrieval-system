   <HEADLINE> MEDIA ; THE MAN BEHIND ' MONICA ' ; * BRAZIL ' S MAURICIO DE SOUSA IS THE JET-SETTING CEO OF A CARTOON EMPIRE BUILT UPON A BUCKTOOTHED LITTLE_GIRL . HE OVERSEES 200 ARTISTS , A SIX-STORY OFFICE AND MUCH MORE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Brazilian cartoonist Mauricio de Sousa first got_into print in the late 1950s as a cub reporter on the crime beat for the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper . Budgets and staff were lean_back then , so Sousa often ended_up illustrating his own stories when a photographer was not on_hand . Then , after nagging for five years , he persuaded the paper to print his first cartoon . The protagonist was Monica , a pint-sized , bucktoothed girl with a closely cropped coiffure , a hot temper and a stuffed rabbit she dragged around by the ears . Monica caught_on , and in time , Sousa was drawing a weekly episode of the adventures of Monica and a gang of tykes for dozens of papers . Today , Sousa no longer chases cops and ambulances . He has swapped the newsroom and a cramped atelier at_home for a six-story office_building in Sao Paulo . His comic muse -- he originally modeled Monica after his 2-year-old daughter -- is now a mom . His cast has now grown to over 200 , from a straw-hatted hillbilly to an affable brontosaurus , and his bank_account into the millions . Today , Monica reigns as the queen of comics in Brazil , vastly outranking the classics by Disney and Marvel . The entire Monica ' s gang collection of 11 comic_books sells 2 million copies a month , making Mauricio de Sousa Productions ( MSP ) Brazil ' s , and probably Latin_America ' s , largest funny business . * Sometimes at night , Sousa still finds time and energy to draw , but like Disney , he has become the CEO of a comics corporation . By day he oversees a stable of 200 artists , shepherds contracts , negotiates with corporate sponsors , and jets to meetings at venues all_over the globe . Headquarters is a renovated glass and concrete warehouse planted imposingly on the industrial outskirts of the city . On one floor , designers hunch_over page proofs to meet deadlines for the next editions . On another , hostesses tend a great playroom , filled with games and rides and great plastic and Styrofoam replicas of Monica ' s gang , where children come_to romp each day . In the last decade , MSP ' s business has burgeoned far beyond the comic page . To his editorial oeuvre Sousa has added eight feature-length cartoon films and a theme park for kids , the Parque da Monica , based in a Sao Paulo shopping_mall . He has also gone a corporate giant step further , pressing his cast of tots into the service of advertising . Manufacturers know the value of stamping Monica ' s visage on their cookies , knapsacks , fruit_juice bottles , and schoolbooks . Trolling the supermarket aisles , kids home_in on the comic images . In 1989 , the Brazilian domestic wares manufacturer Kenko Industrias and Comercio drafted Monica and her gang to boost a new_line of disposable diapers . At the time Johnson &amp; Johnson controlled 70 % of the diaper market . &quot; We knew we needed a strong image to compete , &quot; said Ling Wang , Kenko product manager . * Four years later , J &amp; J ' s share had plunged to 21.8 % , thanks in part to an influx of cheap imports from Argentina , but also to Monica . Kenko ' s market share rose from 10 % to 19.3 % . &quot; We offered a quality product , but I ' d say at least half of our success was because of Monica ' s gang , &quot; said Wang . Today , 60 % of MSP ' s $ 250 million in yearly revenue is reaped from royalties from about 3 # 500 products made by companies such_as Nestle , Procter &amp; Gamble , and Bauducco . What makes Monica so enticing ? Sousa leaned_back in his swivel_chair to field the question . &quot; Monica ' s world is peopled by kids who could be your brother , sister or friend , &quot; he offered . Like the leading lady , Sousa ' s entire cast is based on real kids whose traits are at once local -- such_as straw-hatted country bumpkin Chico Bento -- and universal -- like Cascao , who is terrified of taking a bath . Sousa paused , then shrugged and finally surrendered with a toothy grin . Clearly , never growing_up is part of his secret . He spoke in an office where every free surface was littered with different sized dolls of Monica and her gang , flanked by armies of stuffed rabbits , toy cars and rubber alligators . Sousa ' s rise to the pinnacle of Brazil ' s comic world was not all belly_laughs . In 1964 , a right-wing military coup rocked Brazil , and the hard-liners saw conspirators behind every palm_tree . Sousa , then head of the cartoonists union , was branded a Communist for his campaign in favor of copyright laws , and he was promptly blacklisted by the country ' s leading publishers . ( Ironically , he was also snubbed by the left for refusing to turn his palette against the regime. ) But Sousa did not cave_in . Working at_home , he hand-sketched the comic_strip figures , then carved them onto linoleum blocks , put the molds in a salesman ' s valise and got_on a bus . &quot; I figured_out how much money I had and mapped_out all_the small_town newspapers within a 50-kilometer radius , &quot; Sousa said . Eventually , he had 200 newspapers on his string . Sousa ' s comics are today Brazil ' s best-selling children ' s magazines , and the leading title , &quot; Revista da Monica , &quot; ranks a remarkable third place for all magazines sold nationwide . All 11 Monica ' s gang comics routinely outsell classics like Donald Duck and Mickey_Mouse . * And in Brazil , where 21 % of adults are illiterate , and perhaps as_many more can barely struggle through a newspaper , comics aren ' t just for kids . One survey found that a startling 56 % of Monica ' s regular readers are adults . Success in Brazil has also propelled Monica abroad . By the mid-1980s , Sousa ' s comics were translated into nine languages and exported to 17 countries , from Greece to Denmark . Children everywhere seemed delighted , but Sousa found the adults a harder_sell . In patriarchal Japan , for instance , dads didn ' t take_kindly_to the pushy little_girl who ordered bad boys around . In America , editors frowned_upon Monica ' s dog , Bidu , peeing on lampposts . By the 1990s , however , the entertainment market was changing radically . Cartoon shows , videos , electronic toys and video_games had seized the youngest imaginations . &quot; Today child entertainment is based on a tripod of cartoons , comics , and toys . If you don ' t have all three , you can forget it , &quot; he said . So Sousa recalled his international comics from all but four countries . He also scrapped feature_films , which proved too drawn_out for children ' s perishable attention_span . After this strategic retreat to get his marketing tripod in_order , he is now crossing the borders again . He calls this new assault &quot; Project Hispanidad , &quot; and the weapon is a weekly , 30-minute Sesame Street-styled variety_show featuring Monica ' s gang ' s cartoons , puppets , computer_graphics and cameos by live Argentine artists . The program will be recorded in Spanish and debut in Argentina in April . * Recently a Belgian company came_to Sousa with an offer to invest $ 10 million to produce a similar variety and educational TV_show to be aired throughout Europe , possibly by the end of the year , Sousa said . He is serving_up these shows as a kind of hors d ' oeuvres for overseas appetites . The main_course is an $ 18-million , 52-episode cartoon series , also in Spanish , which is to be produced jointly by MSP and the Taiwan-based animation studio , Cuckoo ' s Nest . He hopes to peddle the series throughout Latin_America . In a separate , and bolder , project , he has contracted actors from Hanna-Barbera studios , creators of the Flintstones , to make_over Monica in a pilot_film aimed , eventually , at conquering the most coveted audience of all , English-speaking American television . Sousa has still other plans for Monica . Each month about 150 # 000 kids push_through the turnstiles at the Parque da Monica , a theme and interactive play center that sprawls over three floors of an upscale Sao Paulo shopping_mall . The numbers have piqued interests abroad . Promising was a visit last year by executives from the Boston tourist development firm , Hamilton Betts Inc. , who visited the Parque da Monica and MSP studios . A company official promptly wrote Sousa back to talk_about replicating his theme park &quot; throughout South_America and , in time , North America. &quot; A Disney-sized fantasy , perhaps , but if even a part of it comes true , Monica and her kin may be amusing children from Miami to Montevideo . And Mauricio Sousa will be grinning all_the way to the bank .</TEXT>
