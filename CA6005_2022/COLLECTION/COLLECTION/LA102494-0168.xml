   <TEXT> It was the tail_end of winter in 1989 -- the deer season given_out , herring beginning to spawn their succulent roe -- when the rhythm of economic life changed permanently in this traditional Native Alaskan village . Martha Vlasoff and her neighbors heard about the Exxon Valdez spill from -- where else ? -- &quot; Good_Morning , America. &quot; Though less than five miles from the spreading crude , they could only guess that emergency crews had tried to burn the oil off the water when acrid smoke rolled through their homes and past the sky-blue cupolas of the Russian Orthodox church . Since then , &quot; people haven ' t been able to handle the stress , &quot; Vlasoff recalled recently . &quot; Now we ' ll never be the same . Our confidence has been shaken . We had a certain way of life. &quot; From subsistence hunters to investment_bankers , virtually all Alaskans have found their futures rearranged by the five-year saga that followed the largest petroleum spill in North_America , dumping 11 million gallons of crude_oil in a body_of_water about two-thirds the size of Lake_Michigan . The $ 5-billion court judgment against Exxon Corp . in late summer refocused attention among Americans in the Lower 48 on the problems of Alaska ' s fishermen . But Alaskans worry about the deep , potentially long-term harm done to the state ' s two biggest industries , fish and oil . And the state ' s lifeblood oil_production has been slowed sooner than everyone had hoped . After the spill , Congress , facing an angry , skeptical public , dropped all notions of allowing oil exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge -- located atop what appears to be Alaska ' s last big oil field . Now , after years of bitter wrangling -- in court and over dinner_tables -- many in the state that bills itself as the &quot; last_frontier &quot; accept the notion that Alaska ' s golden promise of financial opportunity may never be quite the same . In peoples ' homes and businesses , changes range from the basic diets of Native Alaskans living near the spill to the larger specter of the state ' s economic decline . In this wrenching adjustment , once-healthy businesses have folded , particularly in fishing , the state ' s biggest employer . Oil_industry layoffs have become depressingly familiar . New service_industries have added jobs , but the overall wage rate has dropped . People now routinely attribute their divorces partly to financial stress from the spill . &quot; The area that seemed to be ignored by Exxon and everyone else was not the damage to the land , but to the people , &quot; said Stan Stephens , who has owned and operated tour boats in Valdez for more_than 30 years . &quot; It ' s been enormous , and it goes_on and on. &quot; Particularly in the fishing communities , which had little else to offer residents when the salmon and herring disappeared , &quot; You have a whole_lot of people who don ' t have anything to do , &quot; said Steve Picou , a sociologist who studied stress in Prince William Sound communities for four years after the 1989 disaster . Picou contends that the spill &quot; seriously disrupted the fabric of the community. &quot; Of course , people also adjust and thousands of Alaskans -- including fishermen -- made money on the spill cleanup . Certainly some changes wrought by the disaster have also been positive . Among legislators and business_leaders , there is lots of talk -- though little action yet -- about diversifying the state ' s economy . And the U.S. Coast Guard and the oil_companies are far better prepared for future spills . Mixed Blessings Tourism was also up 10 % this summer over last , as cruise lines cut_prices and expanded operations in the state . Though traces of the spill remain around the sound , including on Knight Island , where some of the first beaches were hit , it long ago lost its toxicity and is now mostly out_of_sight . And earlier this summer , after years of grinding litigation , Exxon was ordered to pay $ 5 billion in punitive damages -- equal_to twice this year ' s state_government budget -- to Prince William Sound residents and businesses . Whatever survives Exxon ' s appeal likely will be divvied_up in_proportion_to damages awarded in other trials . But the sound ' s 10 # 000 commercial fishermen , the largest group of plaintiffs , are expected to see most of it . Most say they could use it . Salmon runs are notoriously unpredictable . At the moment , the fishermen are celebrating a big pink salmon season . &quot; This is really the first good news they have had in years , &quot; said Joe Sullivan , resource program manager for restoration for the Alaska Department of Fish and Game . But these are hatchery-grown fish that were spawned in fresh_water from the surrounding Chugach Mountains . Wild_pink salmon , and herring , Prince William Sound ' s other big commercial species , spawn in the sound . They haven ' t come_back and seem to be genetically damaged by the oil , according to Sullivan . Since the spill , Tom Lopez has had a hard_time of it on his 50-foot salmon boat . For three years he couldn ' t make the boat payments , and he ' s had to support three children by driving a truck for a contractor on the pipeline . &quot; Everybody ' s a lot leaner , &quot; he said of himself and his fellow fishermen . &quot; I lost my wife , maybe because of the stress . After the spill , I had to step off the boat. &quot; And the once-coveted pink salmon fishing permits -- which Lopez says traded_in the industry for $ 350 # 000 the day the Exxon Valdez struck Bligh Reef -- can be had today for just $ 26 # 000 . Raymond L . Cesarini , president of Sea Hawk Seafoods , a fish processor in Valdez , once had $ 12 million in annual sales . After the spill , that was cut_in half , then to nothing , for lack of fish and workers willing to clean salmon for $ 7 an hour . Cleaning oily rocks paid $ 17 . &quot; With 10 # 000 people working_on the oil spill , &quot; he said recently , &quot; it was hard to find help. &quot; And one bad year leaves no savings to buy fish the next season . &quot; You ' re out of money , honey , &quot; Cesarini said . Boom to Bust Cesarini ' s wife , also his business partner , left him in 1990 . Even a deal to sell his plant -- to be turned_into a marine mammal rehabilitation center in the event of another spill -- has fallen_through . Native Alaskans in the sound are still waiting for their seal , sea_lion and ducks to return . While they do , they have to generate cash to buy more store-bought beef , which they don ' t much like . In Tatitlek , a village of just over 100 people where visitors have been welcome by invitation only , the need for cash has brought_forth a string of modest economic development projects . One hope : to attract tourists to their postcard-perfect village by enlarging its small dock and port and extending the village landing_strip . Applying for start-up money from funds set_up as a result of earlier spill damage suits , as well as a share of the $ 5-billion Exxon judgment , the village hopes it will finance a smoked-fish business , a clam-restoration project and expansion of an oyster mariculture operation . Meanwhile , Martha Vlasoff has left the village and is separated from her husband , a subsistence hunter . &quot; I always felt that my husband was such a good hunter that . . . if the rest of the world was destroyed , we could live_off the land , &quot; she said recently in a small apartment in Cordova . The village now has &quot; a lack of confidence in our natural_resources , &quot; she said . &quot; . . . But it ' s not the nature of a hunter to admit something like that. &quot; But the shift that affects all Alaskans is the accelerated end of the state ' s oil boom . As the gigantic Prudhoe Bay oil field plays itself out , efforts have so far failed to find another Alaskan &quot; elephant , &quot; as the oil_industry terms the biggest fields . The most promising source of new oil -- the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge -- abruptly became off limits to exploration when the nation vented its anger over the spill and the environmental havoc it created . Exploration in the refuge would literally take an act of Congress . All legislation to open the area to drilling died the day after the spill . &quot; Everyone has agreed to put this in deep_freeze , &quot; said one industry insider , describing the de_facto truce between Washington lawmakers and Alaskan supporters of the oil_companies . &quot; In exchange for us not pushing for it to be opened , they won ' t push to make_it so it won ' t be opened forever. &quot; When North Slope oil_production first began to slacken in 1989 , a popular bumper sticker read : &quot; Please God , Give Us Another Oil Boom . We Won ' t Screw This One Up. &quot; Now , no one finds humor in a hope that has faded like the winter sunlight . Alaskans dread a future of economic decline that has already begun , as the oil hunt moves overseas . All the big companies have been shrinking their Alaska operations . Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield Co. , which dug disappointing test wells in Cook Inlet and the Beaufort Sea in recent years , has dramatically cut its Alaskan exploration budget even as it announced new investments overseas , not the least a $ 1-billion deal in Algeria . Less and less oil is daily pumped through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline from the North Slope to Valdez . Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. , the oil_company consortium that operates the pipeline and its Valdez loading terminal , just laid_off 70 of its 1 # 300 employees and says more job cutbacks are coming . Little Relief in_Sight These are cruel times to a state_government 85 % dependent_on taxes and royalties from oil , and to local_governments like Valdez . The state of Alaska spent its last cash reserves in 1993 and is operating at a deficit , which will likely force lawmakers to adopt an income_tax . The annual payment to every Alaskan from oil revenues -- $ 900 each , last year -- will also likely be capped for the first time . As less oil is produced on the North Slope , property values at the Valdez terminal decline , eroding the city ' s tax_base . Last year , Valdez lost more_than $ 1.5 million in terminal taxes , or more_than 6 % of its annual budget of $ 24.5 million . Many ordinary Alaskans are deeply angry at environmentalists and Lower 48 politicians for deciding how Alaskans can exploit the state ' s natural_resources -- particularly the Arctic refuge . And they ' re angry at their own leaders because no one has come_up with an Alaskan solution . &quot; Nobody has a crystal ball about how to deal with this , and our state and federal politicians don ' t plan for the future , &quot; said Judy Meidinger , an oil_industry consultant . &quot; They ' re going to leave it to the next generation to figure out. &quot; In the meantime , however , the government and the oil_industry are undeniably better prepared to deal with oil spills -- and have created a substantial new oil spill safety industry in Prince William Sound and Cook Inlet . By most accounts , credit goes_to the far-reaching federal Oil Pollution Act of 1990 , known as OPA 90 , that was prompted by the disaster . &quot; The contingency plan ( before the Exxon Valdez spill ) was a farce , &quot; said a federal regulator who declined to be identified . &quot; A lot of OPA 90 has been very , very good. &quot; Safety Regulations The federal agencies overseeing tanker safety still have their critics . Just last week , the Natural_Resources Defense Council and a host of other environmental groups filed suit against the Coast Guard and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to speed_up safety improvements required by the law . Still , under OPA 90 the Coast Guard now has sharper teeth to oversee tanker activities , and better equipment . In Valdez , for example , the Coast Guard is about to activate a vessel-tracking system that will give duty officers the location within 10 feet of every tanker in the sound . Oil-corralling boom is now stored at the waterline near salmon hatcheries and at other sensitive locations . Shippers must plan for and practice to contain big spills . Alyeska , the pipeline operator , and one or another large oil_company hold major drills twice a year , with smaller unscheduled tests in-between . On a recent morning , more_than 500 emergency workers were part of the most aggressive and elaborate drill that Arco has launched since the Exxon Valdez spill . On one team , two community relations workers and a bush pilot braved rain-blasting winds across Prince William Sound to bring a satellite phone and fax to Tatitlek . Villagers had tried_for days after the Exxon Valdez accident to get a telephone_call through to the authorities . Today in a spill they would have direct contact to the emergency operations center in Valdez . The 1990 federal law also brought the residents of Prince William Sound into the oil-spill picture . During this drill , Tatitlek sent its own well-trained cleanup team to a beach near the simulated oil spill site to help set_up pumps , skimmers and oil-containment boom . &quot; Drills mean a lot to us , to be able to get_on top of things , &quot; said village chief Gary P . Kompkoff in his office down the road from the church . In the real_thing , he said , &quot; rather than relying_on outside personnel , we would have direct reports from village residents. &quot; Arco spent as much as $ 400 # 000 on this cleanup drill . Capt . Jerry A . Aspland , president of Arco Marine Inc. , has seen &quot; a tremendous amount of emphasis on response and cleanups in the industry , &quot; particularly because the costs of cleaning_up -- and the now-common accompanying lawsuits -- have soared in the past decade . &quot; But I have not witnessed as much emphasis on prevention , &quot; he added . Stephens , the tour boat operator , agrees , noting that even in good_conditions , only about 10 % of any free oil is recovered . Stephens is also president of a regional citizens advisory committee created by the 1990 law . These days , he is most concerned about shippers ' crews . Sailors still get drunk , he pointed_out , despite tightened drug and alcohol testing of all oil-industry crews . The Coast Guard recently charged two escort vessel captains with being under the influence of alcohol while on_duty . One captain nearly died when he fell_into icy Valdez harbor trying to jump between two docked ships at 4 a.m. &quot; The biggest problem they still haven ' t solved , &quot; Stephens said , &quot; is the human element. &quot;</TEXT>
