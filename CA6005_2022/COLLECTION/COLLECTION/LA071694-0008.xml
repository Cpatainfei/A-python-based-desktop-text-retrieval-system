   <HEADLINE> PENTAGON AIDES SEE PERILS IN STEWARDSHIP OF A-ARMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Senior Defense_Department officials are becoming worried about the safety and reliability of U.S. nuclear_weapons under the stewardship of Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary and are concerned that they soon may be unable to meet the nation ' s potential military needs . In a top secret-letter to O ' Leary in late May , Deputy Defense_Secretary John Deutch said that the Energy_Department was failing to maintain the nation ' s nuclear_weapons plants and lacked the political muscle to obtain sufficient funds to do the job . &quot; We are concerned that the present ( Energy_Department ) nuclear_weapons research , development and test budget does not provide sufficient resources to maintain the technological capability that is required for future nuclear_weapons missions , &quot; Deutch told O ' Leary . Deutch wrote the letter as chairman of the U.S. Nuclear Weapons Council , the joint defense and energy authority that sets policy for nuclear_weapons . It has two other voting members : an Energy_Department executive and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff . O ' Leary was traveling in India this week and could not be reached for comment . In recent interviews , Energy_Department officials have defended her but also acknowledged that the department is facing a rapid erosion in its capabilities . The Defense_Department ' s concerns have prompted serious suggestions that the Energy_Department get_out of the weapons business . Though the Pentagon is not seeking a transfer of weapons responsibility to itself , defense officials acknowledged that the subject has been broached . &quot; It is a serious question , &quot; Frank Miller , principal deputy undersecretary of defense for international security policy , said at a seminar in June on strategic weapons . Such suggestions reflect widespread concern among military_leaders that the nuclear_weapons complex ' s labs and factories are rapidly losing the expert staff necessary to ensure the safety and reliability of the 6 # 000 warheads that the United States intends to hold permanently . Congress has also signaled concern . A Senate subcommittee approved legislation earlier this year that transferred responsibility for the production of tritium , an important explosive booster used in hydrogen_bombs , from the Energy_Department to the Defense_Department . The provision , although it did not become law , indicated the level of anxiety . Sen . Strom Thurmond of South Carolina , the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee , charged in a Senate speech recently that &quot; Mrs . O ' Leary has surrounded herself with a team of professional anti-nuclear activists , &quot; who have put the U.S. nuclear stockpile at risk . Thurmond asserted that O ' Leary ' s advisers come from , among others , the Natural_Resources Defense Council , a prominent critic of the weapons complex . The Savannah_River nuclear_weapons site , which processes tritium and at one time produced plutonium , is the largest employer in Thurmond ' s home state . But Mario Fiori , the Energy_Department ' s chief at Savannah_River and a former Navy submarine captain , said in a recent interview : &quot; I am not going_to criticize Hazel . . . . Hazel O ' Leary is working very , very hard to create credibility for a department . . . that never had much for many many years. &quot; An Energy_Department spokesman said that , even before Deutch wrote the letter to O ' Leary , the department had notified the White_House National Security_Council that it would need a budget increase in 1996 and beyond to maintain the stockpile . &quot; We believe today the stockpile is safe and reliable , &quot; he said . Since coming_into office , O ' Leary has made a number of controversial disclosures about the Energy and Defense_departments ' nuclear_weapons experiments on Americans several decades ago . Defense officials said that those embarrassing disclosures are not the underlying reason for their concern about her leadership , however . Defense officials cited two crucial concerns about the nuclear_weapons stockpile : that it remain safe and that future presidents have absolute assurance of its reliability if it must be committed to war . Under federal policy , the risk of an accidental nuclear detonation under normal conditions is not supposed to exceed 1 in 1 billion , a standard far higher than the reliability of any spacecraft , medical device or complex computer . In the production and handling of 70 # 000 nuclear_weapons during the Cold_War , there have been no accidental detonations , according to Sidney Drell , a noted weapons expert and physicist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator . &quot; that ' s one hell of a record , &quot; Drell said . Whether that record can be maintained is what concerns the Pentagon . Officials worry that O ' Leary is unwilling to commit the political capital necessary to fight_off efforts to cut the nuclear_weapons budgets in favor of environmental and other programs not related to weaponry . &quot; They ( Energy officials ) have been good stewards but their inability to defend the kinds of budgets needed is a cause of grave concern , &quot; said a senior defense official , speaking on background . Assistant Energy_Secretary Victor Reese , who is responsible_for the department ' s weapons complex , voiced his own concerns that its capability may be eroding too rapidly . &quot; I ' m not sure that we might have gone a little too fast , &quot; he said , particularly in ensuring the health and safety of the nuclear stockpile . Former officials of the George_Bush and Ronald Reagan_administrations are among the most outspoken critics of O ' Leary , saying that she lacks the depth of knowledge to manage the nuclear stockpile . &quot; While clearly a very bright person , Secretary O ' Leary has no background in this area and as a result the department lacks the necessary clout in Washington to carry_out its linchpin mission , &quot; said former Defense Undersecretary Don Hicks . One crucial issue is whether the Energy_Department will have the funds necessary to support the two existing nuclear_weapons labs , Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore . Because the United States has agreed to a moratorium on underground testing , Pentagon officials said , it will be crucial for several years to have two labs that can review each other ' s work . Bob Barker , assistant to the president at Livermore , said that the fiscal 1995 Energy_Department budget may_not be adequate_to ensure the safety and reliability of nuclear_weapons . Funding for stewardship has dropped below the levels recommended by an interagency study , he said . &quot; You don ' t want to turn this job over to amateurs , &quot; Barker said . Fiscal 1996 funding will be even tighter , perhaps too low to support two labs , according to an expert involved in a major nuclear_weapons study . This year , the overall budget_for the Energy_Department ' s defense_program -- essentially the weapons complex -- is about $ 4.4 billion , down from $ 5.8 billion in fiscal 1993 . Ensuring the safety and reliability of nuclear_weapons in the absence of underground testing , which was abandoned during the Bush_Administration , is comparable_to ordering General Motors to stop making new cars and even to refrain_from starting any_old cars -- and at_the_same_time having complete confidence that in two or three decades GM could start a car at a moment ' s notice and restart production . To maintain a stockpile of even 6 # 000 weapons , about 100 bombs a year should be torn_apart and rebuilt . Electronics , wiring and batteries must be routinely replaced and decayed tritium replenished . That would require a new nuclear_reactor to produce tritium , production of special batteries , electronic wiring and detonators , as well as special facilities to test conventional explosives used to trigger the plutonium pits in the warheads .</TEXT>
