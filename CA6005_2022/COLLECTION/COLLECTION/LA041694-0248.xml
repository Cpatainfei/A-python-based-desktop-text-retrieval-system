   <HEADLINE> WARNING FLAG OVER GATT ; ENVIRONMENTALISTS SAY PACT WILL WEAKEN U.S. SAFEGUARDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The environmental community , which recently split deeply over support for the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , is issuing warnings about the new_world trade agreement in a newly unified voice . The environmentalists charge that the comprehensive General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade accord signed Friday in Morocco will erode the United States ' -- and California ' s -- ability to enforce its environmental strictures on everything from recycling to pesticide use to air_pollution . &quot; If this . . . is enacted , &quot; said Barbara Dudley , executive_director of Greenpeace USA , &quot; over two decades of environmental protection could be severely weakened. &quot; Nowhere is that more true than in the area of food safety , some environmentalists argue . The United States , with some of the world ' s most restrictive regulation of pesticides , prohibits the entry of food_products with detectable traces of about 40 chemicals -- substances used by many of its trading partners and listed as allowable by the standard-setting organization of the new agreement . But if U.S. Customs Service inspectors begin turning_away food imports that bear traces of these chemicals under the new agreement , America ' s trading partners are almost certain to cry foul , environmentalists warned . If their challenges stand , one activist said , U.S. pesticide protections could topple , one after another . Supporters of the accord acknowledged that the letter of the new agreement may indeed put the United States , with its strong environmental protections , on the defensive . That is because some U.S. laws championed by environmentalists , as well as state laws , do not appear to be based on undisputed scientific evidence demonstrating that a regulation will improve the public ' s health or mitigate a known environmental hazard . Supporters of the agreement also argue that the United States ' market power , as well as a growing appreciation for the environmental ethic among America ' s trading partners , will cause virtually any challenge to U.S. environmental laws to fail . &quot; The practical implementation of trade agreements is often more politically sensitive and realistic than the sheer language of the treaty , &quot; said William K . Reilly , administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in the George_Bush Administration and an avowed free_trader . Other free_traders cited the power and transparency of the processes by which U.S. laws are passed and regulations are made . In a challenge before the international trade deliberative body , U.S. defenders could produce reams of scientific data , risk assessments and economic analysis to prove that an American environmental standard was established not to keep foreign products out , but to benefit the public ' s health . &quot; In a fair fight , &quot; said Linda Fisher , a Washington-based trade attorney with the Los Angeles law_firm Latham &amp; Watkins , &quot; the United States will win. &quot; But environmental activists are not comforted by those assurances . They say that the fine print of the new agreement would allow a trading partner to argue before the trade court in Geneva , Switzerland , that Washington ' s environmental laws -- or those of individual U.S. states -- constitute an unfair barrier to the entry of that country ' s exports . If the United States regulates more strictly than its trading partners the fuel emissions or stipulates the fuel efficiency of cars sold or operated within its borders ( which it does ) , or prohibits food_products that bear traces of certain pesticides it considers hazardous ( which it does ) , a trading partner , in principle , can challenge the federal stricture under the trade agreement . Environmentalists said that under the trade agreement , trading partners could target laws such_as the one that grew out of California ' s Proposition 65 , which requires a cautionary label on any product that would expose its user to a carcinogen or a chemical that could be harmful to a developing fetus or pregnant woman . Other California state regulations that could be challenged go beyond federal_government requirements by making manufacturers of agricultural chemicals furnish the state with data on the chemical ' s possible effects on human reproduction , water_pollution , exposed workers and endangered species . Another California stricture that could come under_attack is one that has required wine manufacturers to sponsor efforts to warn consumers of the possible dangers posed by the lead in the foil that covers wine corks . Finally ... A World Trade Pact Ministers from 124 nations ended seven years of complex negotiations Friday and formally concluded the Uruguay Round of the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks in Marrakesh , Morroco . Following are the main elements of the 26 # 000-page , 385-pound global world trade pact : MARKET ACCESS - This is the backbone of the act . Countries pledge to cut tariffs on industrial and farm goods by an average of about 37 % . The United States and European Union agree to trim tariffs between them by one half . SERVICES - For the first time , rules will govern annual trade_in services such_as banking , insurance and travel , as well as the movement of labor . The United States reserves the right to deny other countries favorable access to the lucrative U.S. financial services market , but will hold_off for at least 18 months . Washington has threatened to challenge EC curbs on audio-visual goods . TEXTILES - Import quotas on textiles and clothing , in place under the Multi-Fiber Arrangement since 1974 , will be phased_out over 10 years . ANTI-DUMPING - Rules on dumping - pricing exports below their value in the domestic market - are clarified . AGRICULTURE - Also for the first time , agriculture is folded into the GATT . The blueprint is the 1992 Blair House accord reached between the United States and the EU as amended in talks last December . It converts all non-tariff barriers such_as quotas into tariffs , which are reduced 36 % for industrialized countries , 24 % for poor nations . The cuts will be phased_in over six years for rich countries , 10 for others . The pact also cuts direct export subsidies and agricultural supports and forces countries with closed farm markets -- including Japan , which restricts rice imports -- to import at least 3 % of domestic consumption of the product , rising to 5 % over six years . INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY - The treaty toughens protection for patents , copyrights , rights of performers and producers of sound_recordings , trademarks , and labels of origin . GATT EXPANSION - Set_up as a temporary body in 1947 , GATT will be transformed into a permanent watchdog called the World Trade Organization , with status equal_to the International Monetary Fund and the World_Bank . The WTO will begin operations between January and July , 1995 . Source : Times Wire_Service</TEXT>
