   <TEXT> He wanted his wife to quit smoking . It was a simple wish , yet its consequences were profound . This was in the 1970s , in Greece , where smoking was as cherished a pastime as baseball in America . Dimitrios Trichopoulos didn ' t care about bucking the tide . He simply detested his wife ' s addiction . A young cancer epidemiologist at the University of Athens , Trichopoulos tried the usual guilt_trip . He told her she was hurting herself . On this , he said , the medical literature was clear . When that didn ' t work , he told her she was hurting him -- an argument he could not support with statistics . She didn ' t believe it . Ever the scientist , he set_out to prove it . That family argument wound_up earning Trichopoulos a place in tobacco history . He was the first researcher to connect secondhand cigarette smoke with an increased risk of lung_cancer . He accomplished this in a somewhat unorthodox fashion , pirating $ 50 # 000 from one of his grants to conduct a survey of 189 nonsmoking women . ( Greek officials , Trichopoulos says , would never have given him money to study the detrimental effects of a cash crop as lucrative as tobacco ) . He found that smokers ' wives were twice as likely to develop lung_cancer as women married to nonsmokers . It worked . &quot; I convinced her , &quot; Trichopoulos says . His wife quit . The study did much more_than clean the air in the Trichopoulos home . He published it in 1981 , days before the publication of a larger study conducted by Japanese epidemiologist Takeshi Hirayama . These papers gave a huge boost to a grass-roots anti-smoking campaign that has dramatically changed the way Americans work , dine , travel and raise children . This is the nature of the secondhand smoke revolution : a little bit of science -- still emerging , not all_of it conclusive -- shaping a lot of public policy . For anti-smoking activists , scientific_research into the dangers of secondhand smoke has been a godsend . The high point came last year , when the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency declared secondhand smoke a &quot; Group_A &quot; human carcinogen , reporting that it accounts_for 3 # 000 lung_cancer deaths each year . This placed it in the same deadly category as asbestos and radon ; the agency concluded that the danger cannot be eliminated by using smoking and nonsmoking sections . Thanks in large part to that report , secondhand smoke is now one of the nation ' s most pressing and divisive public health issues . Coupled with allegations that tobacco companies have misrepresented the nicotine content in cigarettes -- and tobacco executives ' denials -- the issue is bringing public outrage to new heights . But the tobacco_industry is fighting_back -- hard . A coalition of farmers and manufacturers filed a lawsuit alleging that the EPA &quot; manipulated and cherry-picked scientific data &quot; and asked that a U.S. District Court judge in North Carolina nullify the report . In California , tobacco giant Philip Morris has placed a controversial initiative on the November ballot that would undo local ordinances designed to curb secondhand smoke and replace them with a looser standard . And on Monday , cigarette maker R.J. Reynolds launched an aggressive public information campaign designed to stave_off smoking bans by countering the widespread perception that secondhand smoke is dangerous . The company ' s tactic : Fight science with science . In full-page newspaper_ads , R.J. Reynolds says its research shows that nonsmokers are exposed to &quot; very little &quot; secondhand smoke , even when they live or work with smokers . In one month , the company said , a nonsmoker living with a smoker would breathe the equivalent of smoking 1 1 / 2 cigarettes . &quot; Policies should be based on science , &quot; Chris Coggins , the R.J. Reynolds toxicologist , said in an interview Wednesday . &quot; I think that the ( EPA ) science is very , very weak. &quot; But the industry has a long way to go toward rolling back public policy on secondhand smoke . More_than 600 state and local ordinances restrict smoking in public places , including Los Angeles ' hotly debated restaurant ban . Across the United States , in cities large and small , a familiar sight has emerged : Smokers congregating outside . The federal Occupational Health and Safety Administration is contemplating a ban in all workplaces . This month , a congressional subcommittee approved a bill , introduced by Rep . Henry A . Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) , that would ban smoking in most buildings , except restaurants and private clubs . There is no smoking on domestic_flights . There is no smoking in the White_House ; First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton will not tolerate it . There is no smoking with your Big Mac ; McDonald ' s recently banned tobacco in its corporate-owned restaurants . Taco Bell and Jack in the Box followed_suit . Last year , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled_in favor of a Nevada prisoner who called his cellmate ' s smoke cruel_and_unusual_punishment . Custody_battles have been settled by giving preference to parents who do not smoke . The turnabout from a smoking to a smoke-free society seems to have occurred overnight . It could not have happened , anti-smoking advocates say , without science . &quot; Twenty years ago , I tried to have one room in a cruise_ship declared smoke-free and I was told I was crazy , &quot; said John Banzhaf , a law professor at George_Washington University who runs Action on Smoking and Health , or ASH . &quot; Who at that time would have figured that 30 % of all our businesses would be smoke-free today ? . . . Things are moving amazingly quickly , and it is the scientific , medical underpinning that has changed the complexion of the issue. &quot; * Today , several hundred scientific studies link secondhand smoke to a variety of diseases : lung and other cancers , heart_disease , respiratory infections including bronchitis and pneumonia , asthma and sudden_infant_death_syndrome ( SIDS ) , which claims the lives of babies as they sleep . This research is responsible_for an oft-quoted statistic : About 53 # 000 Americans die each year from secondhand smoke . &quot; The evidence is so clear , &quot; says Mark Pertschuk , co-director of Americans for Non-Smokers Rights . &quot; Everybody and his brother is lining_up to ban smoking. &quot; Yet the evidence , while compelling , is not as complete as Pertschuk suggests . Of each year ' s secondhand-smoke deaths , 3 # 000 are attributed to lung_cancer , 12 # 000 to other cancers and 37 # 000 to heart_disease , according to the Coalition on Smoking OR Health , a nonprofit group formed by the American Lung Assn. , the American Heart Assn . and the American Cancer Society . The coalition also estimates that secondhand smoke accounts_for 700 SIDS deaths a year . Most scientists working outside the tobacco_industry say the link between lung_cancer and secondhand smoke is firmly established . But the evidence on heart_disease -- which accounts_for nearly 70 % of estimated deaths -- is much newer , and not all scientists accept it . Only 14 studies have documented this link , and the federal_government has not yet taken a position . Nonetheless , public tolerance for secondhand smoke is waning . A recent Gallup Poll showed 38 % of Americans support a ban on smoking in restaurants -- up 10 % from three years ago . Support for workplace smoking bans is at 32 % , up eight points from 1991 . The poll also found 36 % of Americans believe secondhand smoke is very harmful to adults , and 42 % believe it is somewhat harmful . &quot; The tide has turned , &quot; says Michael Eriksen , director of the Office on Smoking and Health at the U.S. Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention . &quot; I think an invisible line was crossed in terms of how the public feels about smoking. &quot; * The tobacco_industry is trying its best to persuade people to cross back over that line . The vast majority of the research on secondhand smoke is epidemiological , meaning it traces patterns of disease and finds connections , rather than proving cause and effect . Based on those studies , scientists are just beginning to conduct animal research to learn the precise biological effects of secondhand smoke . Tobacco_industry officials vehemently dispute the epidemiology , including the EPA report . They say some study subjects give inaccurate information about how much smoke they have been exposed to , or whether they have ever smoked . R.J. Reynolds officials also cite a recent report by the Congressional Research Service -- the research branch of the Library of Congress -- that characterized the EPA ' s data as &quot; uncertain. &quot; Coggins , the Reynolds toxicologist , complains that the EPA failed to include recent data that found no link between lung_cancer and secondhand smoke . &quot; The epidemiological evidence is not sufficient to say that ( secondhand smoke ) poses a health risk , &quot; says Gio Batta Gori , a toxicologist and consultant for the Tobacco Institute , a trade industry group . The EPA says nonsmokers face a 19 % increase in their risk of developing lung_cancer when they are exposed to secondhand smoke -- a figure Gori describes as &quot; a whiff of a risk. &quot; He says that if 2.5 % of the study subjects misclassified themselves , the research would be invalid . But the EPA , which estimates that 1 % of subjects misclassified themselves , sticks_by its findings . EPA Administrator Carol M . Browner calls the agency ' s science &quot; extensively documented &quot; and said the R.J. Reynolds ads &quot; will not distract the public from the real issue : that secondhand smoke poses a serious health problem. &quot; Most independent scientists agree that secondhand smoke causes death and disease in healthy nonsmokers . It is particularly harmful to people who have underlying illnesses -- asthma , heart_disease , bronchitis and other respiratory conditions -- that are exacerbated by cigarette fumes . But questions remain about just how much exposure will make a healthy person sick . While living with or working near a heavy smoker is a serious health risk , the dangers of casual exposure are less clear . &quot; If you were a patron and you go_out to eat , say , once a week , I think the disease risk may , in fact , be negligible , &quot; says Don Shopland , coordinator for the National Cancer Institute ' s Smoking and Tobacco Control program . &quot; On the other hand , if you are a waitress and have to work in that environment eight hours a day for several years , you have a very substantial disease burden. &quot; Still , Shopland says there is more_than enough evidence to warrant smoking bans . He cites statistics showing that secondhand smoke-related lung_cancer alone would kill 100 times as_many people each year as asbestos . &quot; And yet , &quot; he says , &quot; if you find asbestos in a school , they will close the school. &quot; Others -- including Trichopoulos -- say the risks of secondhand smoke are not commensurate with the public outcry . The real health danger , they say , is to the smoker . A smoker is 20 times more likely than a nonsmoker to develop lung_cancer -- a 2 # 000 % higher risk . But , depending_on the study cited , someone who breathes secondhand smoke is 1.19 times to 1.4 times as likely as a nonsmoker to develop lung_cancer -- a 19 % to 40 % higher risk . There is yet another ironic twist to the way science has shaped public policy : Most laws designed to curb exposure are directed at places where adults congregate -- restaurants and offices . But research shows the biggest danger is to children , particularly those whose parents smoke at_home . They need the most protection , yet get the least . According to the CDC , secondhand smoke causes up_to 300 # 000 cases of bronchitis and pneumonia each year in children under 18 months . It can trigger or worsen asthma_attacks , and may also be responsible_for up_to 26 # 000 new cases of childhood asthma each year . The agency estimates that 9 million youngsters under 5 live_in homes with smokers and are exposed to secondhand smoke almost all day . Some studies show sudden_infant_death_syndrome is 2 1 / 2 times more likely to strike babies whose mothers smoke . These figures have been used in education campaigns , including one by the CDC and another in California financed by Proposition 99 , the anti-smoking initiative adopted in 1988 . Studies show the campaigns are working ; people are smoking less , and are more cautious about where they smoke . Last year , 27 % of California smokers reported they did not smoke in their homes -- up from 18.8 % in 1992 , according to Stanton Glantz , a UC San Francisco researcher who has done extensive work_on secondhand smoke . Among smokers who lived with small children , 45 % said they did not smoke at_home . And no matter what the research shows , a_few simple truths remain : The vast majority of American adults -- 76 % -- are not smokers . Many are annoyed by secondhand smoke . It might not make them seriously ill , but it makes their clothes smell and their eyes water . And they are no longer afraid to demand change . * For the scientists who produced what law professor Banzhaf calls the &quot; medical underpinning &quot; of all this social_policy , the current debate is another rung on the tall ladder of acceptance . Many , like Trichopoulos , had little funding and even less support from mainstream health groups , such_as the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Assn. , which call secondhand smoke a major threat . Perhaps no researcher has struggled longer or harder than James Repace . He is a 55-year-old health physicist who , while working for the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington in the late 1970s , stumbled upon the idea that secondhand smoke could be measured as air_pollution . Working nights and weekends , with a borrowed air-quality monitor , he took measurements at bars , bowling_alleys and office_buildings . What he found surprised him : About 85 % of indoor air_pollution comes from tobacco . In Repace ' s view , that makes secondhand smoke the biggest pollution problem in America -- bigger , he says , than outdoor air_pollution . &quot; The typical levels of particles in the air in the presence of smoking , &quot; he says , &quot; were worse than you would find on a busy commuter highway during rush hour. &quot; On a lark , he sent his findings to the prestigious journal Science . The study was published in 1980 . R.J. Reynolds researcher Coggins says Repace ' s work relied_on outdated technology . But the Science article helped make Repace one of the nation ' s leading authorities on secondhand smoke ; the media often quote him and the government often uses him as an expert witness . His success , however , has not been a boon to his EPA career . In 1987 , Repace was investigated for conflict_of_interest by the EPA inspector_general after a Tennessee congressman complained that such outside activities prevented him from making a fair judgment about the dangers of tobacco smoke . Although he was cleared , he has been forced to leave the EPA . His bosses there , he said , have told him he is a lightning_rod for complaints from the tobacco_industry . It is a conclusion that he does not dispute . He had little to do with the landmark report declaring secondhand smoke a human carcinogen , and is &quot; on loan &quot; to OSHA . &quot; At the moment , &quot; he says , &quot; I ' m looking_for other things to do. &quot; Trichopoulos ' career , meanwhile , has not suffered . Today , he chairs the epidemiology department at the Harvard School of Public Health , marking him as one of the most respected researchers in his field . It has been a long journey from Greece in 1980 , when he says , he could barely get his secondhand smoke findings published . The study finally appeared in the International Journal of Cancer . Trichopoulos believes that had Hirayama ' s study not appeared soon after in the widely read British Medical Journal , neither would have been taken seriously . In his Harvard office , Trichopoulos keeps a rejection letter he got from the editors of one prestigious academic journal . The letter foreshadows the political touchiness of the secondhand smoke debate . The scientist chuckles each time he reads it . &quot; The implications of your findings are enormous , &quot; the editors wrote . &quot; We believe you will be proved right . . . . You will probably tell us once again that we are chicken. &quot; Fighting Science With Science These dueling advertisements -- by the tobacco_industry , above , and the U.S. Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention , right -- typify the public relations war over the health dangers of secondhand smoke .</TEXT>
