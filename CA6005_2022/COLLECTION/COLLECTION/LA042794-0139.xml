   <TEXT> &quot; Archeology is not a science ; it ' s a vendetta. &quot; -- Sir Mortimer Wheeler , British archeologist * As 80-year-old Jale Inan tells the story in her sunlit living room above the Bosporus , a simple question of justice has taken her to war with the Boston Museum of Fine_Arts . &quot; I excavated that statue ; it was stolen from us , and it belongs in Turkey . I want my statue back , &quot; she said . Inan is battling to recover the top half of a 1 # 800-year-old statue of a weary Hercules . She says the marble chunk of history was stolen from an archeological dig she directs in southern Turkey . No way , says the museum . &quot; I am ready to go and sit there until I get_it , &quot; she said . A sit-in against an American cultural icon by an octogenarian Turkish scholar who is something shorter than five feet and a good bit less than 100 pounds ? Maybe not , but educated fur is flying , and Inan is a pertinacious soul . Her herculean quest is symptomatic_of a new combativeness among countries that are the often unwitting and always unhappy source of antiquities . Her campaign is underwritten by a Turkish government embarked in high-profile counterattack against what it considers three centuries of plunder by villains from grave-robbing farmers to eminent archeologists . Turkey wants its treasures back , and its assertive stick-and-carrot recovery program , which began to bear fruit last fall , is drawing attention from other Mediterranean nations alarmed at the loss of artifacts . The undertaking is controversial . It is not calculated to comfort foreign collectors or museums . And it has become a national priority for Turkey . Turkey is the principal source of classical artifacts that find their way to First World markets today , about $ 100 million to $ 200 million worth per year by official estimate . A crossroads nation spanning Europe and Asia , host to 36 civilizations across the centuries , Turkey claims more ancient_Greek cities than Greece , more Roman cities than Italy . &quot; It ' s amazing how much time I spend on the phone with our lawyers , &quot; said Engin Ozgen , the ebullient professor who is director general of monuments and museums at the Turkish Ministry of Culture in Ankara . Little wonder . Export of cultural artifacts is illegal in Turkey , and Ozgen may become history ' s most litigious archeologist . He watches_over a $ 50-million war_chest that Turkey has earmarked to selectively pursue stolen or illegally exported antiquities . &quot; We will spend millions if necessary to prove our ownership . Sometimes collectors and museums can ' t afford legal costs , but Turkey is a country ; it is rich enough to pay these large bills , &quot; Ozgen said . Smoke from an American cigarette wreathed his well-trimmed beard as rap_music ricocheted off the baroque chandelier in his office . Ozgen caressed the glossy auction catalogues that he studies in search of purloined treasure . A New York gallery withdrew a 6th-Century BC marble torso of a boy from auction last year after Turkey claimed that it was stolen . &quot; We can ' t go_after everything that has left Turkey , but we are making symbolic recoveries while at_the_same_time educating people with the idea of stopping smuggling , &quot; Ozgen said . &quot; Around the world , collectors are thinking_twice now about the origin of what is offered them . ' Was it smuggled from Turkey ? Will they chase us ? ' &quot; Beyond the Boston Hercules , Ozgen says he is also feuding with the Dumbarton Oaks Museum in Washington over 6th-Century religious objects from a Byzantine monastery . He has a lawsuit pending against a museum in Basel , Switzerland , over an inscribed stone pillar from ancient Phrygia , and he is demanding posthaste return of an errant 3 # 000-year-old sphinx from a Berlin museum . Greece has also turned_to American courts . It sued a New York dealer last year to recover Mycenaean jewelry from the 15th Century BC that it claims was stolen by grave robbers in 1978 . A signal victory of the nascent Turkish offensive was the return last year by New York ' s Metropolitan Museum of Art of the 363-piece &quot; Lydian Hoard , &quot; an exquisite collection of silver and gold jewelry , bowls , incense burners and coins from the 6th Century BC . Around 1966 , Ozgen says , villagers near Sardis in west-central Turkey robbed a series of neighboring tombs from the time of the Lydian King Croesus ( as in &quot; rich as . . . &quot; ) . By 1968 , the buried treasures had found their way to New York , where the Met paid around $ 1.5 million for three separate lots , cautiously labeled them &quot; East Greek &quot; and delayed displaying them -- a case of a bad conscience , it would turn_out . For more_than a decade , Turkish newspaperman Ozgen Acar dogged the treasure , eventually tracing it from the villagers who stole it to pieces in the museum first significantly displayed in 1984 . The museum rejected Turkey ' s claims , and the lawyers took_over in 1987 . Six years and almost $ 3 million later , with the lawsuit still unresolved , the Met bowed gracefully last fall to what Director Philippe de Montebello called &quot; a unique confluence of factors. &quot; &quot; Turkish authorities did provide evidence that most of the material in_question may indeed have been removed clandestinely from tombs in the Usak region , much of it only months before the museum acquired it , &quot; De Montebello said at the time . More , &quot; our own records suggested some museum staff during the 1960s were likely aware , even as they acquired these objects , that their provenance was controversial. &quot; The Lydian Hoard is now on display at the national Museum of Anatolian Civilizations in Ankara , where Director Tuzun Gunel says it fits seamlessly into a collection of objects recovered by Turkish specialists in the area from which it was originally stolen . Yet critics say Turkey is hardly in a position to boast about the preservation and display of antiquities it already controls . Storehouses full of less-valuable surplus antiquities slumber far from public gaze . The Lydian Hoard will eventually be displayed at a museum in Usak near where it was found , to be seen by a fraction of those who might have marveled at it in New York . Ozgen , who oversees 175 museums and 120 excavations , says legal_action for recovery is a last_resort . Turkey , where by his estimate there are 200 # 000 burial_mounds still waiting to be explored , has powerful incentives with which to repay foreigners who cooperate in the return of smuggled artifacts . &quot; What we have is the common cultural heritage of all humankind , and our policy is to share it . We will happily lend to exhibitions , give excavations permits , scholarships and access to our museums and archives , &quot; Ozgen said . In the United States , there is also the charitable American-Turkish Society . Donors wishing to dispose_of , say , an awkward 2nd-Century Roman sarcophagus may give it to the foundation and write it off . Yes , the foundation does make occasional gifts to the Turkish government . And yes , there happened to be a particular garland sarcophagus in the Brooklyn Museum -- a three-ton marble coffin of splendid mien and dubious provenance . Its owner donated the sarcophagus to the society after the museum declined to accept it as a gift ; journalist Acar and a colleague , Melik Kaylan , had reconstructed its weighty journey from Anatolia to Brooklyn . Thomas Hoving , former director of New York ' s Met , says Brooklyn trustees might have accepted the sarcophagus had not Turkish newspapers a lot more recent than the 2nd Century turned_up inside when the lid was pried off . The sarcophagus , valued by Turkish officials at $ 3.5 million , was flown home from Brooklyn last week and went_on display Tuesday in the Istanbul Archeological Museum . Writing in a recent issue of Art &amp; Auction magazine , Hoving says , &quot; When it comes_to wresting illegally or illicitly ripped away pieces of the national artistic patrimony from the clutches of American museums , private collectors and dealers , and finagling them back home , nobody does_it better than the Turks. &quot; Hoving calls the Turks ' use of a charitable foundation as middleman &quot; the most creative incentive in the history of museums and collecting to guarantee the successful regaining of their priceless stolen heritage. &quot; The question of who owns cultural treasures of bygone civilizations -- Greek , Roman , Egyptian , Chinese or Incan -- has long vexed supplier and buyer alike . After all , there have been Egyptian obelisks in Roman piazzas for 2 # 000 years . A procession of invaders looted Rome across the centuries : Nazi artistic pillage of occupied Europe was preceded by Napoleonic looting . Venice ' s four bronze horses galloping atop St . Mark ' s were lifted from Byzantine Constantinople , now Turkish Istanbul . The Istanbul Archeological Museum has a lovely set of ancient sarcophagi arduously transported from Sidon , then Ottoman-ruled , but now a city in Lebanon . Turkey , by contrast , has a powerful claim to the sphinx that German archeologists carted_off in 1917 with the promise to return . Greece , for its part , has for nearly half a century demanded the return of the Elgin Marbles -- the frieze from around the Acropolis removed in the 19th Century . The British Museum , where the Marbles are a prized exhibit ( along with the Rosetta stone , a linguistic celebration of three civilizations found by French troops in Egypt ) , refuses , arguing that such a precedent could lead to the emptying of museums around the world . The only international treaty governing the return of artifacts is a 1970 UNESCO convention , notes Malcolm Evans , secretary_general of Unidroit , an international legal institute based in Rome that is one of the United Nations ' specialized agencies . &quot; So few ' importing ' countries have ratified that for all intents and purposes it doesn ' t work , &quot; he said . The United States ratified the treaty in 1982 . A new convention expected to be open for ratification next year will make recovery easier for &quot; exporting &quot; nations ranging from Turkey to Mexico . For objects stolen from illegal excavations , and those illegally exported , the burden_of_proof will be reversed , Evans said . Buyers will have to prove they did everything possible to establish legal provenance . The treaty would apply only to antiquities stolen or smuggled after ratification . In fact , it is recent thefts that most often have Ozgen reaching for his phone . The Turks say the Boston Hercules is one such case , although the museum disputes it . In 1980 , scholar Inan headed the dig at Perga in the Turkish south , a steady source of classical sculpture . One day , she recalls , word went round that something big had been stolen . Archeologists followed a suspect workman and recovered some statuary . Now , Inan says , they realize that they should have looked harder . Later that summer , archeologists discovered the bottom half of a three-quarter life-size statue of a weary or resting Hercules . It was a 2nd-Century Roman marble version of a statue attributed to the 4th-Century BC Lysippos of Sikyon , a Greek whose bronze statues celebrated the harmony of the male_body . The Perga Hercules ' lower half is now on display at the Turkish government museum in Antalya . Inan thinks the statue broke when it fell backward , with the two pieces lying close_together across the centuries . Lo , the next year the top of a weary Hercules turned_up in New York . A collector donated a half share to the Museum of Fine_Arts in Boston . And it wasn ' t long before the small world of archeology was atwitter over photographs showing a remarkable resemblance between the Boston top and the Turkish bottom . Inan went_to the United States to see for herself . Could she examine the statue , and would they tell her where they got_it ? &quot; They said yes , they said no , they said maybe , &quot; she recalls . &quot; They told such stories it was impossible to believe them . Maybe they really believed it was not the same statue . But it was -- the same marble , the same dress , the same aging . ' She ' s wrong , ' they said . ' She ' s wrong. ' &quot; Inan persisted . After much to-ing and fro-ing and rattling of lawyers , the Turkish government hired an American sculptor to make an exact copy of its bottom half , a cast that was fitted with the Boston top in a museum storeroom under the expert and doubting eye of Cornelius Vermeule , the museum ' s curator of classical art . Here , from Art &amp; Auction , is Hoving ' s account of 1992 ' s Hercules showdown day in Boston : &quot; The marble torso was gingerly placed on top of the cast and the two pieces virtually clicked into place -- perfectly , almost as if they had been magnetized -- Vermeule looked_up in utter astonishment . ' I ' m shocked , ' he said . ' I ' m so surprised ! Well , I never . . . ' He gazed placidly at the experts representing Turkey ' s interest and suddenly asked , ' Say , would you be willing to discuss a shared loan ? ' &quot; Inan remembers : &quot; Our lawyer was so nervous he couldn ' t watch . Then everybody yelled and kissed me . ' Congratulations , ' they said . A director of the museum said we ' d have the statue back in two weeks . That was two years ago. &quot; &quot; The museum does not acknowledge Turkey ' s claim of ownership , &quot; said Robert P . Mitchell , the museum ' s director of public relations and marketing in written response to questions about the statue . &quot; There has never been any evidence that the statue was stolen , and allegations to that effect were entirely unsupported . . . . Indeed , the break between the top and bottom halves of the statue appears to be an ancient one , such_that the top half could well have been removed long ago from the territory that is now known as Turkey . &quot; In the unfortunate event that the current settlement discussions are not successful , a lawsuit would be necessary . Such a case would raise significant questions. &quot; In Ankara , Ozgen says dryly that Boston is reconsidering its position on Hercules . &quot; The statue probably cost $ 100 # 000 to $ 200 # 000 , &quot; he said . &quot; It may cost them $ 2 million to defend it in a case we think we ' ll win . Is it worth that ? &quot;</TEXT>
