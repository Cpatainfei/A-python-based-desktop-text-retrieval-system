   <HEADLINE> ' HE ' S WITH YOU , BUT HE ' S NOT REALLY WITH YOU ' ; RAMS : MILLER ' S CONCUSSION , SUFFERED ALMOST TWO WEEKS AGO AGAINST SAINTS , STILL A SOURCE OF CONCERN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last Saturday , while at the University of Oregon to watch his alma_mater play , Ram quarterback Chris Miller turned_to a friend and said , &quot; Man , I got_to hurry up and get_on a plane when this game is over . We ' re playing Denver tomorrow. &quot; Miller was serious . His friend was concerned . &quot; But you got a bye this week , &quot; his friend said . &quot; Woo , kind of weird , &quot; Miller said with a groan . &quot; You know , a concussion has you saying some silly things. &quot; On Oct . 23 , Miller hit the back of his head on the artificial turf in the New Orleans Superdome , and although he played_on through the first_half , the concussion he experienced eventually forced him to the hospital for an overnight stay . &quot; They told me that when I hit my head on the ground , my brain kind of coiled up and shot forward , hitting the front of my skull and bruising it , &quot; Miller said . &quot; that ' s why I have a lot of pressure on the front of my head and around my temples . It feels_like you have a bad head_cold , or drank a bottle of tequila and it ' s the next morning. &quot; Twelve days later , Miller ' s head is still not right . &quot; He ' s a little out of it , to say the least , &quot; said Jerome Bettis , Ram running back . &quot; He ' s with you , but he ' s really not with you . He ' s not saying a whole_lot , and that ' s different from what he ' s normally like . &quot; I ' ll tell you , it makes me nervous . Is he going_to snap out of it ? that ' s what the question is with me. &quot; Miller walked in and out of the Ram locker_room the other day , and cornerback Darryl Henley said Miller had no recollection of doing so . &quot; I saw him this morning when he walked_out_of meetings and he just looks_like he ' s kind of walking_around , &quot; defensive end Fred Stokes said . Miller said his condition has improved greatly , but he continues to have headaches and cannot watch videotape for extended periods without turning_away because of blurred vision . &quot; After practicing Wednesday , I told the trainers , the coach and the doctor there is no way I could have played today because I was thumping myself on the helmet to see what it felt_like and I could tell if I got hit once I ' d be useless , &quot; Miller said . &quot; Just jogging down the field with my head jarring in the helmet I felt_like a mush-head. &quot; Miller is admittedly cautious . Recent news coverage of the retirement of Chicago Bear running back Merril Hoge because of post-concussion syndrome , and his own lingering symptoms , have prompted Miller not to rush back to duty . &quot; We ' re not talking an ankle sprain here , &quot; Henley said . &quot; I ' m sure when Chris drives_home he contemplates whether he ' s going_to play again. &quot; Although teammates are concerned about Miller ' s health , most have their own concussion stories to tell . &quot; I ' m used to them ; he ' s not , &quot; linebacker Shane Conlan said . &quot; I ' m always hitting , so I guess your brain gets used to it . He ' s not hitting somebody every play , so he ' s not used to it . I get_about one or two every year . &quot; I ' ve only been knocked completely out like two or three times , but the others are just little concussions . You hit a running back and you get a little buzz , a little ring and then you ' re fine . I get headaches , but they go_away . The way I play is with my head . that ' s the way it is . I couldn ' t play if I couldn ' t play that way . If it scared me , I ' d have to retire , so it doesn ' t. &quot; Miller said he has had four concussions during his career . &quot; And this one has stuck_with me the longest , &quot; he added . &quot; It ' s bothered my wife , I know , when I ' ve been sitting there mumbling or saying something backward and it makes no sense to her . &quot; When I return , it will be at the right time . I ' m not going_to be like ( New York Jet wide receiver ) Al Toon , ( New York Giant linebacker ) Harry Carson or Merril Hoge . I don ' t know where the point is where you say , ' I ' ve had too many , ' but I see progress . I ' d be lying if I said I haven ' t been thinking_of some of the long-term problems associated with this . &quot; If I practice Friday and I still don ' t feel right , believe me , I ' ll be honest with the doctors . This is not something to take lightly. &quot; The Rams did not wait for Miller ' s recovery . They decided earlier this week to start Chris Chandler at quarterback against Denver on Sunday in Anaheim Stadium . Although no one is questioning Miller ' s head injury , there have been rumblings among players that the team needs a consistent presence at quarterback , someone who might be tougher than Miller , someone who doesn ' t have a track record of always getting hurt . &quot; That may be a question , &quot; Stokes said . &quot; But I think it ' s unfair with the situation Miller has . When a guy is labeled with having injury problems , he can ' t get hurt . If he ' s hurt he can ' t even mention it , so then he plays with a injury that is something that is minor that turns_into something major . This is something else. &quot; Bettis said such talk is not surprising in the Ram locker_room , but that Miller should shrug it off . &quot; When you have a guy come_in and he ' s making a considerable amount_of_money , there are always going_to be people on the team who are going_to say , ' Is he worth it ? ' &quot; Bettis said . &quot; Everything in his situation hasn ' t been right , but he hasn ' t asked to be injured . People have missed blocks , is that his fault ? People say he hasn ' t produced , but he hasn ' t gotten the opportunity to do it. &quot; Miller , who suffered two serious knee injuries while playing with Atlanta , has already missed playing time here because of a stomach muscle strain , sore ribs and a separated shoulder . When he missed practice last week , Coach Chuck Knox didn ' t wait , switching immediately to Chandler . &quot; If he was a rookie or somebody else , there would n ' t be much said , but here ' s Chris Miller , who is supposed to be the guy , and he ' s not the guy , &quot; Stokes said . &quot; He has a knee , a shoulder , abdominal muscle , his head now and people are going , ' Is he for real ? ' &quot; I know those are questions coming up and he has to deal with them every day when he goes_home . I was looking_at him in the locker_room this week and thinking the extent of his problem only he knows . I could see where he could be easily labeled by other guys , like , ' Hey , the guy ' s not tough. ' Or he ' s faking or trying to get a way_out of a tough situation without actually quitting . I feel sorry_for him and my heart goes_out to him . I ' m praying for him. &quot; The Rams signed Miller to a three-year , $ 9-million contract . They gave Chandler $ 600 # 000 to work one season as his backup , although the gap between starter and backup appears a little foggier as players and coaches gain confidence in Chandler . &quot; I ' m not concerned about that , &quot; Miller said . &quot; I ' m not going_to make any more comments on that . It ' s a whole picture , it ' s a whole offensive unit , a whole offensive staff , and there ' s a lot that needs to be worked_out . We ' re working on a hell of a lot of new things going_into the ninth week of the season , making a lot of changes , so obviously we haven ' t gotten everything achieved that we wanted , whether I ' ve been in the game or not. &quot; As for Miller ' s toughness , he played earlier this season with a painful rib injury , took shots to soothe the pain before each game , but played_on nonetheless . &quot; I have tried to come_out here and play injured , &quot; Miller said , &quot; and I don ' t know whether that ' s showing toughness or showing stupidity . Getting injured bothers me , and affects the team as well , but I can ' t control that . Maybe it ' s my body. &quot; Miller ' s body has taken a pounding during his eight years in professional_football , but it ' s not as if he hasn ' t tried to change his luck . &quot; I wore No . 13 , thinking I could shake the black cloud , &quot; Miller said . &quot; But hell , look_at the airplane that just went_down . Sixty-eight people died . I still have my health and there are a lot more people worse off than me . &quot; There ' s only one person who knows if I ' m going_to be healthy or not and that ' s the good Lord , who has the master_plan . I don ' t know why he decided to have me spank my head on the New Orleans turf , but it ' s up_to me to get my head right and help the team the best I can. &quot;</TEXT>
