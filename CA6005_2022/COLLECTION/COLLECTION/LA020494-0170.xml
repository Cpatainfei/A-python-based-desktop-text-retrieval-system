   <HEADLINE> FCC OKS RULES FOR NEW WAVE OF PERSONAL COMMUNICATORS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Congress debated how to give Americans access to advanced telecommunications , federal regulators Thursday cleared the way for a new generation of portable devices that might one day serve as phone , fax and pager in one . The Federal Communications Commission voted unanimously to finalize its rules for deploying so-called narrow-band personal communications services , a technology the agency said will &quot; contribute to the development of the national information infrastructure. &quot; The FCC said these services , initially limited to paging and data messaging , could be launched as early as September . But experts consider this the most primitive of a family of emerging wireless technologies that will eventually allow users to send and receive video , voice and computer data from the gadgets that are as portable as a wristwatch . Meanwhile , narrow band PCS could be a boon for the estimated 14 million people who now use pagers or mobile data services , experts say . And it would be an important first_step toward a system of go-anywhere communications -- available as early as next year -- in which users would jettison separate work , cellular and home phones in favor of a single device and phone_number they could carry with them . The decision to launch PCS came as the House telecommunications and finance subcommittee heard testimony about ways to ensure universal access to the emerging information highway . Several speakers said promoting competition would create more access to telecommunications services through lower prices . But Prof . Eli Noam of Columbia University urged lawmakers to set_up a system of financial credits and debits to encourage providers to wire poor and rural_areas as rapidly as wealthier communities .</TEXT>
