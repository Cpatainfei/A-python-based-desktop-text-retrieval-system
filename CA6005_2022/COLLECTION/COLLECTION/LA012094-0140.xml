   <HEADLINE> MORNING BRIEFING : MAYBE GUY FROM COMMERCIAL CAN AUCTION OFF OLYMPIC BEER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Every day at exactly 1 p.m. , an employee of the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing committee , in skiing knickers and a floppy hat , mounts a stool on the town ' s main_street and summons a crowd clanging a cowbell . Up for auction is a countdown T-shirt , one for each day left until the Games . &quot; This is a historic day , &quot; auctioneer Morten Svensen shouts from his stool . That is the same thing the auctioneers have said every day since the auctions started 1 # 000 days before the Games . The T-shirts , especially ones with special numbers like 100 , draw astonishing bids . The highest was $ 3 # 700 ; the average is $ 320 . Add Olympics : German brewers are being urged to provide free beer to the country ' s competitors at the Winter_Olympics because the Germans ' favorite drink costs too_much in Norway . &quot; German brewers , support our Olympic team . Free beer for Lillehammer , &quot; Bild , the country ' s biggest newspaper , said in a front-page article . Bild complained that Lillehammer bars would be charging between 14 and 25 marks ( $ 8 and $ 14 ) for half a liter of beer -- between three and five times more_than in Germany . Trivia time : Who was UCLA ' s first consensus All-American in basketball ? Precocious Chris : If Chris Webber makes the NBA All-Star game , he will become the youngest player ever in the midseason contest . Shaquille O ' Neal , who was 13 days shy of his 21st birthday when he played last year , is the youngest . Webber would be three days younger if he plays_on Feb . 13 . Polar Bear : Somebody should tell Ted Sakovich that the Chicago Bears refers to the animal , not a state of undress . There he was_on one of the coldest days of the year , trotting around Calumet City , Ill. , clad only in underpants , gym_shoes and a headband with the word &quot; Bears. &quot; A wind-chill of 38 degrees below zero turned his bare skin red . &quot; I didn ' t even feel it , &quot; he said as he completed the two-block run and returned to the comfort of the Rose &amp; Crown tavern . His mistake was to have bet_on the Bears , wagering they would finish the season . 500 or better . The team lost its last four games , finishing 7-9 . The other way : Unlike Michael Jordan , who made his fortune and retired from pro basketball , Don Calhoun made his fortune and got a job shooting hoops . Since winning $ 1 million by sinking a 75-foot shot at a Chicago Bulls ' game promotion last April , Calhoun has quit his $ 5-an-hour job and joined the Harlem Globetrotters -- as a shooting guard . New sport ? Golfer Fred Couples attended a Dallas Stars hockey_game and tried his hand at a slap shot in the Reunion Arena shooting cage . He recorded the night ' s top speed , 104 m.p.h. Trivia answer : Walt Hazzard in 1964 . Quotebook : The San Antonio Spurs ' Dennis Rodman , on coaching Dennis Rodman : &quot; John ( Lucas ) knows I ' m a competitor . He knows I ' m out there doing my job , which is to kick ass . But I would n ' t want to coach me . No way . It ' s hard to coach Dennis Rodman. &quot; SHAV GLICK</TEXT>
