   <HEADLINE> GERMANY AND D-DAY REUNION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * I write in reply to Ellen Goodman ' s column of April 29 , &quot; Germany Has No Place at the D-Day Reunion. &quot; Of course , we should always remember those who died in Nazi concentration_camps and those who died trying to free them . It ' s important to remember the national denial and the international denial that made the Holocaust possible . Goodman says that the sins of the grandparents should not be visited on the grandchildren . She points_out that in 1944 few Germans thought they were getting a welcome liberation from Hitler . But this is 1994 . Anyone who was 18 in 1944 is now 68 . If we insist that Germany must be held apart from the rest of the community forever , then World_War_II will never be over . The Nazis will never die as long as we insist that their descendants can never atone for being their descendants . And , by the way , alienated youths who join groups such_as the neo-Nazis will not feel less alienation and hate by being excluded for their German-ness from the world community . Let us not emulate behavior we don ' t admire and do what the Nazis would never have done : invite Germany to world events like the D-Day reunion . LAKE NOFER Woodland Hills * I was surprised that Goodman lumped Japan teaching its young about the bombing of Hiroshima with neo-Nazis in Germany and Holocaust revisionists in America . Maybe I ' m prejudiced because I ' m of Japanese ancestry , but the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki are very important parts of modern Japanese history . Actually , it ' s a very important part of modern history , period . In my school textbook , Hiroshima took_up one or two paragraphs . In a Japanese textbook , much more information is given . I don ' t think teaching Japanese children about Hiroshima will create another generation of Tojos who will invade Korea and China and all_of Asia and try to take_over the world !
