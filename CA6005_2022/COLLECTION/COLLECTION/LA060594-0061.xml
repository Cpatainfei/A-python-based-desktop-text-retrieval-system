   <TEXT> In this popular 1993 film , the killer_whale becomes a symbol of nature exploited , the ultimate victim of man ' s greed and rapacity.Like Willy himself , trapped in a park , the theme is imprisoned in a movie fairy tale . But somehow the majesty comes_through this slightly sentimental adventure_story of Boy ( Jason James Richter ) meets Whale . Children ' s movies , after all , shouldn ' t be asked_for the sophistication and verisimilitude we demand of adult films -- and &quot; Free Willy &quot; is for children and families , first and foremost ( HBO Tuesday at 8 p.m. ; Friday at 6 a.m. and 4 p.m. ) .
