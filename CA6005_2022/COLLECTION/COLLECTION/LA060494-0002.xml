   <HEADLINE> STATE , U.S. JOBLESS RATES FALL SHARPLY ; ECONOMY : NATIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT DROPS TO 6 % AND CALIFORNIA ' S TO 8.3 % . BUT THE SOUTHLAND ' S RECOVERY CONTINUES TO LAG BEHIND THAT OF THE REST OF THE COUNTRY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The unemployment_rate fell sharply in both the nation and California in May as the economy continued to generate steady job growth , the Labor_Department reported Friday . The national jobless figure fell to 6 % , down from 6.4 % in April . But government officials said that the sizable decline appears to overstate the actual improvement in the nation ' s labor_market last month . In California , unemployment dropped to 8.3 % , down from 9.6 % , in another large statistical move that masks a more moderate pickup in job creation , according to analysts . And Southern California , although recovering , continues to trail the rest of the state and the nation as_a_whole in the economic expansion . In Los Angeles County , the jobless rate edged down only slightly to 9.7 % in May , compared with 9.9 % a month earlier . &quot; Northern California is marching along to the national tune , &quot; while Southern California is still lagging , said Thomas Plewes , associate commissioner of labor statistics . While the declines in the official unemployment_rates were impressive , a separate calculation of the number of people working across the country showed that the economy generated fewer than 200 # 000 new jobs in May . The figure was smaller than expected , and some economists said it could signal that the pace of the recovery is slowing to a more moderate level . The prospect of more restrained growth appeared to reassure the stock and bond markets , where investors have expressed growing concern that the robust growth of recent months could lead to a resurgence of inflation . The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 13.23 points to close at 3 # 772.22 , while the yield on the Treasury ' s 30-year bonds , a key indicator of long-term interest_rates , fell to 7.26 % , from 7.34 % a year earlier . Lower yields suggest that investors are more confident that inflationary pressures remain under_control . Clinton_Administration officials welcomed the job report , insisting that their policies will lead to steady growth without significant price increases . &quot; The economy is entering the summer in exceedingly good_shape , &quot; Labor_Secretary Robert B . Reich said at a White_House briefing . &quot; We are deep in a jobs recovery , a jobs expansion. &quot; But Reich expressed concern about the widening gap between the prospects of skilled , high-wage Americans and those workers who lack the necessary education and training to fully enjoy the benefits of the economic resurgence . He noted that 20 % of Americans currently without jobs have been unemployed for six months or more . The sharp drop_in the national jobless rate is somewhat exaggerated because the government has changed the way it conducts its monthly surveys and adjusts the results to reflect conditions affecting the nation ' s total labor_pool of more_than 130 million workers . Such statistical changes could account_for as much as half of last month ' s decline , said Katherine Abraham , Commissioner of Labor Statistics , suggesting that the true rate of unemployment could be closer to 6.2 % . The agency ' s separate survey of business payrolls showed a net increase of 191 # 000 jobs in May , a figure that includes 71 # 000 people who returned to work after the end of the trucking_industry strike . The payroll survey is considered a more reliable measure of employment conditions than the household poll used to calculate the unemployment_rate . While the employment figure signaled that the recovery is still on track , it was slightly smaller than expected and fell_short_of the average monthly job growth of 247 # 000 so far during 1994 . An increase of 191 # 000 jobs &quot; is not the type of figure that should panic the markets , &quot; said Martin Regalia , chief economist for the U.S. Chamber_of_Commerce . &quot; This is a continued verification of our expectation that the economy is slowing somewhat from the pace at the end of last year and during the first quarter. &quot; Nationwide , job growth was noticeably more robust in April , when the economy added a revised 358 # 000 non-farm jobs , and in March , when payrolls swelled by 379 # 000 . In California , meanwhile , &quot; we ' re seeing slow , steady increases in the number of payroll jobs , which is encouraging , &quot; said Ted Gibson , principal economist for the California Department of Finance . California ' s recovery picked_up speed slightly , with 7 # 100 jobs added_to employers ' payrolls . The government revised upward , to 7 # 900 , the number of jobs gained in April , bringing the overall increase to 15 # 000 over the last two months and 30 # 400 for all_of 1994 . Larry Kimbell , director of the UCLA Business Forecasting Project , said that the May data makes him &quot; feel more secure &quot; that the state is in the midst of a genuine recovery . Still , he noted , the job gains continue to be modest . And he expressed disappointment at the slow pace of the improvement . &quot; I want to see 30 # 000 to 40 # 000 jobs added a month . . . before I shout , ' Hooray ! We ' re in a vigorous recovery ! It ' s better to be getting some gains than none , but it still looks pretty weak. &quot; In California , last month ' s job gains came mostly in_services , particularly the motion_picture industry and retailing . Job losses continued in manufacturing , especially defense and aerospace-related fields , along with finance , insurance and real_estate . The &quot; hemorrhage &quot; of defense jobs , which disappeared at a rate of 15 # 000 jobs a month last year , has slowed to about 8 # 000 monthly , according to Plewes of the Bureau of Labor Statistics . Los Angeles County recorded a net employment gain of 26 # 000 in May , with the number of jobholders rising to more_than 4 million . It posted a decline of 4 # 000 in the number of jobless workers , with the total dipping to 432 # 000 . Unlike federal and state statistics , the county numbers are not adjusted to reflect seasonal trends . Jay D . Horowitz , labor_market analyst for the California Employment Development Department , said that he is mildly encouraged by the county totals . &quot; More or less , we ' re going to follow in the footsteps of the nation in coming_back , but it ' s a very slow process. &quot; Horowitz said that employment in construction , retailing and other services appears to be growing in the county . While job losses continue in aerospace and other high-tech fields , he said the rate of shrinkage appears to be slowing .
