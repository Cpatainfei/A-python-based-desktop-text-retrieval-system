   <HEADLINE> EXECUTIVE TRAVEL : SPOTLIGHT ON HONG KONG ; WHEN DOING BUSINESS THERE . . .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Though British influences are evident in government and commerce , business dealings also reflect the traditions of Hong Kong ' s 98 % -Chinese population . DO * Exchange business_cards . They are always exchanged upon introduction , and both hands should be used when giving and receiving . * Use courtesy titles until the person you are addressing suggests an alternate form . Also be aware that it is Chinese tradition for the surname to appear first . * Be prepared to deal with your contact ' s relatives , since most businesses are closely held family ventures . * Try to resolve legal matters and disputes out of court , as preserving relationships and saving face is vital in Hong Kong . Although English common_law forms the basis of the legal_system in Hong Kong , some Chinese legal traditions are also employed . * Be prepared to do some business in languages other_than English . English and Cantonese are official languages . The former is the most widely used in business , but Cantonese is commonly spoken in the Chinese community , and many in Hong Kong also speak Mandarin , which is the lingua_franca in China . After 1997 , English will still be an official language among the executive , legislative and judicial authorities in Hong Kong . * Avoid overly aggressive or loud behavior . Control both positive and negative emotions . Physical contact is frowned_upon . However , a brief handshake is common . * Expect to spend a lot of time laying a foundation , building relationships and proving your capabilities . * Be aware that most companies are run_by a single , dominant executive with more top-down decision making than consensus building . As a result , business decisions are often made more quickly than in other Asian_countries . * Be aware of the influence of ancient Chinese traditions . For example , a feng shui specialist may be consulted on the layout of an office , or an auspicious day may be chosen for the signing of a contract . DON ' T * Don ' t be late for appointments . Hong Kong executives expect promptness . * Don ' t use broad body gestures . Unless pointing to something specific on a document , use the whole hand to point and the hand with palm down to beckon . * Don ' t respond to invitations over the phone . It is considered impolite . A formal written response is more appropriate . * Don ' t expect to get a lot done during the Chinese New Year in February , as_many businesses close for as long as a month . * Don ' t expect to have to deal with Chinese officials immediately . But many executives are making informal contacts before the 1997 transition . Source : John Irvine , Price Waterhouse LIESL GUINTO</TEXT>
