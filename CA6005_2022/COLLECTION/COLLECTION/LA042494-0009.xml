   <TEXT> WHAT THEY FOUGHT FOR : 1861-1865 by James M . McPherson ( Louisiana State University Press : $ 16.95 ; 88 pp. ) . A Union_soldier wrote following the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation in 1862 that &quot; as god gives us liberty we Should try to impart it to others . . . thank god the chanes will Soon be bursted. &quot; It ' s an eloquent statement of a view held by many Northern soldiers -- but by no means all , for others believed Lincoln ' s order had turned the civil conflict , as one put it , into &quot; nothing but an abolition war. &quot; &quot; What They Fought For &quot; is essentially a work-in-progress , an essay surveying some of the themes James McPherson ( author of the 1989 Pulitzer winner &quot; Battle_Cry of Freedom &quot; ) plans to explore in greater detail in a forthcoming history , but this volume stands on its own due_to the many strong voices it contains -- those of James M . McPherson and those of the soldiers he quotes . McPherson ' s reading of thousand of letters and diary entries have led him to dispute the common belief that Civil War soldiers didn ' t know why they were fighting , and to conclude that although slavery was indeed a central issue , Confederate and Union combatants alike believed themselves to be &quot; custodians of the legacy of 1776. &quot; It ' s appalling to read Southern soldiers ' references_to battling &quot; tyrants &quot; on behalf of &quot; liberty &quot; while suggesting a_few sentences later that their families purchase more slaves , but equally inspiring to learn of the English-born Union corporal explaining his re-enlistment in a letter home by writing &quot; if Liberty should be crushed here , what hope would there be for the cause of Human Progress anywhere else ? &quot;</TEXT>
