   <HEADLINE> HOLIDAY SEASON CATCHES A RISING STARSHIP ; 7TH ' STAR TREK ' BLASTS OFF WITH $ 23.2 MILLION AT MOVIE BOX_OFFICE AS OVERALL SALES ARE UP 50 % FROM YEAR AGO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Star Trek : Generations &quot; was rocketing ahead of the still-simmering &quot; Interview With the Vampire &quot; and &quot; The Santa Clause &quot; Sunday to lead a powerful box-office launch for the 1994 holiday movie season -- up 50 % or more from a year ago . Overall tickets sales on the weekend that many consider the official start of the holiday movie season were estimated at close to $ 95 million , with the Thanksgiving weekend -- traditionally one of the year ' s best movie-going weekends -- coming right up . The No . 1 film -- by several light_years -- was &quot; Star Trek : Generations. &quot; The seventh feature_film in the intergalactic saga , and the first_based on &quot; The Next Generation &quot; series spin-off , brought_in die-hard fans as well as a new generation of Trekkers , soaring to an estimated $ 23.2 million on 2 # 659 screens in its first three days . It ' s the best launch of any of the &quot; Star Trek &quot; films . Add another $ 3 million from Thursday night special previews on 1 # 300 screens , and Paramount Pictures is probably already drafting the script for the eighth episode . The Starship Enterprise blasted &quot; Interview With the Vampire. &quot; After the fifth-largest debut weekend ever of $ 36.3 million , Tom Cruise and his merry band of bloodsuckers was drained of more_than half its business , down to a projected $ 18.1 million , following the conventional pattern for horror movies . But shed no tears for Lestat and Louis , since &quot; Interview &quot; has already sucked_up $ 64 million in its first 10 days -- although both first and second weekend grosses are the subject of some dispute in the industry . Still , &quot; Vampire &quot; should get an infusion over the Thanksgiving holiday . How it holds_up over the long term , however , will be closely watched based on this weekend ' s drop . The weekend had begun resembling Noah ' s Ark . There seemed to be two of every kind of film . But the results were more akin to Darwin ' s theory of natural_selection . Of the two Kris Kringle flicks , &quot; The Santa Clause &quot; and the debuting &quot; Miracle on 34th Street , &quot; the former is clearly the Uber-mensch . After last weekend ' s $ 19.3-million opening for &quot; Santa Clause , &quot; Tim Allen ' s agents were already upping his asking_price several million . And based on the $ 16.3 million done_in the second weekend -- more_than $ 40 million in 10 days -- the $ 100-million level for the film appears likely . That would end a long dry spell for Disney ' s ( non-animated ) feature_film division . But &quot; Miracle &quot; would need one to save it from quick extinction . Despite a barrage of sneak_previews the previous weekend , the John Hughes production opened_to a grinch-like $ 2.7 million on 1 # 190 screens . After last summer ' s debacle of &quot; Baby ' s Day Out , &quot; many are wondering what happened to the Hughes of &quot; Home Alone. &quot; In the animation wars , the reissue of &quot; The Lion King &quot; ate &quot; The Swan Princess &quot; for breakfast . After being withdrawn from theaters last summer , Disney ' s &quot; King &quot; returned to his perch with $ 5.5 million over the weekend , taking_in over $ 275 million . Now &quot; The Lion King &quot; will play tortoise and hare with &quot; Forrest Gump &quot; as both chug toward the phenomenal $ 300-million mark . &quot; Swan &quot; got a frog caught in its throat with a wan $ 2.5-million opening , yet another casualty of Disney ' s apparent lock on animation . ( On Wednesday , &quot; The Pagemaster , &quot; featuring Macaulay Culkin combined with animation , will also enter dubious battle against &quot; The Lion King. &quot; ) The duel of gun-toters , &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; and the debuting &quot; The Professional , &quot; was won by the latter from French director Luc Besson ( &quot; La Femme Nikita &quot; ) . &quot; The Professional &quot; got_off to an adequate start with $ 5.1 million on 1 # 158 screens , pumping some new lead into the action market . The long-running &quot; Pulp , &quot; however , only dropped to $ 3 million , proving there ' s life in it yet . To date &quot; Pulp &quot; has grossed more_than $ 48 million . Keenan Ivory Wayans ' gumshoe flick &quot; Low Down Dirty Shame &quot; joins them , starting Wednesday . The other sci-fi movie , &quot; Stargate , &quot; took_a_hit from &quot; Star Trek &quot; but still managed a flight-worthy $ 4.4 million and has now grossed $ 52 million . But the other florid horror movie , &quot; Mary Shelley ' s Frankenstein , &quot; dropped_out of the Top 10 , taking_in only $ 1.6 million , squeaking past the $ 20-million level after three weeks . Depending_on Sunday ' s business , &quot; The War &quot; will do somewhere between $ 2.8 million to $ 3 million over the weekend -- aided only a bit by the sneak_previews of Arnold Schwarzenegger ' s pregnancy comedy &quot; Junior &quot; on Friday and Saturday night . &quot; The War &quot; has basically lost the battle with only about $ 13 million in three weeks . Overall , the weekend box-office tally was far ahead of the comparable weekend last year , which had an approximate gross of $ 56.8 million . In 1992 , the ticket take was $ 74.2 million -- led by &quot; Home Alone 2 : Lost in New York , &quot; which alone snagged $ 31.1 million . In another notable debut this weekend , Zhang Yimou ' s banned-in-China &quot; To Live &quot; arrived in two theaters in New York , garnering a strong $ 33 # 000 . Final weekend estimates will be released today .</TEXT>
