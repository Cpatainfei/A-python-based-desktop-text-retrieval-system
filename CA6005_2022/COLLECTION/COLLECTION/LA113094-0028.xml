   <TEXT> ART Wrapping the Reichstag : Internationally recognized artist Christo , who has wrapped islands off Miami and a Paris bridge , on Tuesday uncloaked details for his latest plan : to cover Berlin ' s Reichstag with a silver blanket next summer . Some politicians say wrapping the 100-year-old landmark is an affront to the Reichstag , Germany ' s once and future seat of Parliament . But Christo , who erected 1 # 760 yellow umbrellas along California ' s Tejon Pass in 1991 , got the go-ahead from the German parliament last February after a determined 22-year campaign , and plans to start the project on June 17 . He will use 160 assistants to wrap the Reichstag with 90 # 000 square_yards of a silver propylene fabric , chosen &quot; because it fits with the building , the heaven and light in Berlin. &quot; Christo estimates it will take about a week to complete the job , and the building will remain covered through July 6 . The Bulgarian-born artist has given estimates of $ 4.5 million to $ 7 million for the project , which he plans to fund through the sale of his sketches . The historic gray stone building housed parliament from 1894 until 1933 when it was gutted in a fire . Reunited Germany ' s federal parliament , which now meets in Bonn , is to move_back into the Reichstag by the year 2000 . * Paris Figures Charged : French police have charged two well-known Paris art world figures with selling paintings by Marc Chagall that were stolen by the painter ' s housekeeper after his death in 1985 . Police said at least 40 gouaches , probably more , were taken from Chagall ' s studio in St . Paul de Vence and sold on the international market for about $ 10 million . Charged in the scheme were Jean-Luc Verstaete , an art consultant ; Yves Hemin , manager of the Marcel Bernheim Gallery in Paris , and Georges Guerra , their suspected accomplice . The three allegedly falsified ownership documents and found respected galleries and auction_houses to authenticate and sell the works . The housekeeper , Irene Menskoi , was murdered in 1990 , but her death was not related to the scheme , police said . Chagall ' s heirs apparently were unaware the works were missing . EVENTS Hollywood Auction : Harrison Ford ' s jacket and hat from &quot; Raiders of the Lost Ark , &quot; costumes worn by TV superheroes Wonder_Woman and Batman and Robin , and furniture from &quot; The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson &quot; are among the items to be auctioned_off Saturday and Sunday in a two-day sale of entertainment memorabilia at Hollywood ' s Butterfield &amp; Butterfield .
