   <HEADLINE> CENTER AT VAUGHN CAMPUS MAKES SCHOOL A FAMILY AFFAIR ; EXPERIMENT : HEALTH AND SOCIAL_SERVICES ARE MADE AVAILABLE TO THOSE IN THE POVERTY-RIDDEN AREA , IN THE HOPES OF BREAKING CHILDREN ' S CYCLE OF FAILURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It began with a 10-year-old child expelled from school for ditching . When school officials turned_down the frantic mother ' s pleas for another chance , she knew where to turn for help . At the Family Center_on campus , she told her story to a parent advocate who agreed to intercede . The deal he made was that to get_back in school , her son would have to take counseling and she would have to join a parenting class . In the sessions that followed , other tensions surfaced . The woman ' s 16-year-old daughter was abusing her own 2-year-old . And a disciplinarian father was demoralizing his two sons , contributing to their problems in school . Now , the daughter is in parenting classes , too , and has started working part time at the family center . The father and mother are receiving counseling . The boy is doing better in school . This fantastic-sounding story happened at Vaughn Street Elementary School . It is a prime example arising from an experiment there to show that the delivery of comprehensive health and social_services through a school-based program can improve students ' performance and even lift a community up by its own bootstraps . The Vaughn Family Center is a one-stop resource for the predominantly Latino and poor families whose children attend Vaughn . Occupying a two-room bungalow on campus , the center distributes food and clothing , connects children and parents to benefits such_as Medi-Cal and welfare , enlists the help of other community agencies for child_care and health_care and involves parents in helping their children in school . If the services parents need don ' t exist , the Family Center tries to create them , using resources at_hand , including the parents . When the center opened , there were no licensed day-care providers in the Vaughn attendance area . So the center formed a partnership with the Child_Care Resources Center to train families how to set_up day_care in their homes . So far 20 families have been licensed , providing 102 new spaces for Vaughn families . A new training session is held every two months . Other Vaughn parents worked with a health educator from Olive View Medical_Center to develop a curriculum for prenatal care . Now parents are being trained as lay health educators to teach pregnant women in the community . The hope is that this focused investment in one of the Valley ' s most poverty-impacted schools will break cycles of failure , saving money in the future . &quot; We ' re experimenting with different ways of getting services to people much earlier and using a lot more paraprofessionals and community volunteers , &quot; said Dorothy Fleisher , planning director of United Way ' s North Angeles Region , which co-sponsors the Family Center . &quot; If we ' re successful , it should cut costs at the other end : dropout rates , being unemployed , winding_up on AFDC ( Aid for Families With Dependent Children ) , the cost of being in jail. &quot; The Vaughn experiment was born three years ago out of a collaboration of United Way ' s North Angeles Region and the Los Angeles Educational Partnership , a business alliance that channels private donations into educational reform . Both agencies were independently exploring the problem of social barriers to education . They decided to start a model project . Vaughn offered the perfect laboratory . It had the worst test scores in the Los Angeles Unified School District and was one of California ' s 64 lowest-achieving schools , ranking in the 20th percentile statewide in language achievement . Its educational deficiencies reflected social conditions of the school community . Ninety-six percent of Vaughn students were eligible for the federally subsidized free lunch program and , therefore , were considered to be eligible for Medi-Cal . Yet few had signed_up . Nearly 80 % of them suffered acute dental problems . Nearly 90 % were Spanish speaking with English-language deficiencies . A more positive factor_in the choice of Vaughn was its new principal , Yvonne Chan . Assigned in May , 1990 , she quickly established herself as a high-energy , media-savvy administrator who wanted to make the school a model for educational change . Chan lobbied aggressively to bring the program to Vaughn , assuaging teachers ' fears that it would drain resources from the classroom or dilute their authority . The program got_off_the_ground in 1991 with a funding package that included a $ 160 # 000 planning grant from United Way , $ 200 # 000 from the California Department_of_Education and grants from several corporations . A governance system was established in which parents joined school staff and representatives from United Way and the educational partnership in hiring as director Yoland Trevino , formerly director of Bienvenidos , a shelter for infants and toddlers who are court dependents . Relations between the Family Center and the school have evolved with some rough spots , Chan said . Early on , she set_up meetings between the social_workers and teachers to smooth_out differences in their viewpoints . Still , there were conflicts . &quot; Teacher says , ' You ' re suspended , ' social_workers would say , ' My poor dear , did you get breakfast ? ' &quot; Chan said . &quot; These two things will kill each other and I ' m in the middle . &quot; There was a time with the Family Center overstepping bounds with teachers , &quot; Chan said . &quot; There were grievances filed with administration . There were disagreements between teachers and staff , parents and teachers , teachers and teachers . We ' ve lived through all_of those rough waters. &quot; Now , she said , the governance of the Family Center and school have merged into a smoothly functioning unit overseeing a campus that assumed nearly complete control over its own destiny this fall by becoming the Valley ' s first state-chartered school , renamed the Vaughn Next Century Learning Center . &quot; They are a part of us , &quot; Chan said . &quot; Family Center is not separate. &quot; Yet it is distinctly different . It is a place where parents are the center_of_attention . Trevino included parents in filling_out her staff of five community liaisons , three family advocates , a family counselor and an administrative assistant . Four-fifths of those hired were parents who first became involved in the program as volunteers . The community liaisons , paid $ 320 monthly for 53 hours , generally volunteer full days , Trevino said . They take_charge of the clothes_closet and the food pantry , coordinate child_care and bilingual counseling , help parents fill_out forms for services and organize events . The family advocates visit each family that comes_to the center for help and work_out a case plan under the supervision of the licensed family counselor . This can include connecting family members with community resources , helping them get benefits such_as Medi-Cal , providing transportation and just listening , Trevino said . Currently , about 140 families are in case plans . Among them , 120 have qualified for twice-monthly federal food supplements , 40 have received housing support , and 40 have entered substance_abuse treatment programs . All the parents are asked to contribute something in return , from sweeping up around the center to organizing school events , Trevino said . The Family Center has proven resourceful in the use of volunteers to expand existing community services . El Nido Family Centers in Pacoima provided a trainer who taught parents the importance of reading to their children and showed them skills for creative reading . &quot; This gives the parent an opportunity to find their own inner child and to strengthen the relationship , &quot; Trevino said . &quot; We now have grandparents that are reading to their grandchildren. &quot; Trevino next plans to train other parents as reading trainers so they can spread the &quot; Motherread &quot; program to other schools in the Northeast Valley . Volunteers also teach computer classes , Spanish literacy , English as a second language and a Spanish class aimed at the school ' s African-American parents . So far , the Vaughn experiment has produced encouraging results . Students tested in Spanish have increased their scores from under the 10th percentile to above the 30th , Chan said . Mobility -- the rate at which students transfer in and out of the school -- has dropped from nearly 70 % to less than 40 % . There are now 34 students in gifted programs , compared to none before . Conceding that much of the evidence of their success is anecdotal , however , Fleisher , the planning director for United Way ' s North Angeles Region , said she is seeking backing to conduct a long-term cost / benefit analysis . &quot; Is this model saving money ? It ' s complicated to figure that , &quot; she said . &quot; Sometimes these programs in the short run are using benefits more . In the long_run they may not. &quot; At the least , it will take years to track dropout rates as children move to higher grades and to measure the degree to which they grow_into productive adults or place a future burden on the social_system . More immediately , the Vaughn experiment continues to face obstacles -- particularly financial -- to setting its most ambitious plans in action . A primary goal -- extending quality medical_care to all Vaughn families -- has been particularly challenging . Blue Cross of California funded planning for a health_insurance program , but so far the program has not gotten_off_the_ground , Fleisher said . Decisions have yet to be made on such questions as whether all family members would be insured , or just the schoolchildren , and which medical services should be provided on campus . Meanwhile , in January , Blue Cross will pay_for a nurse practitioner to visit the school twice a week , Trevino said . The company also will enroll several Vaughn families in its CaliforniaKids program , providing complete health coverage for $ 25 per year for up_to four children and $ 10 for each child beyond that . The program is for families who aren ' t eligible for Medi-Cal but can ' t afford private health_insurance . As it turned_out , though , only a_few qualify because 80 % of Vaughn ' s students are eligible for Medi-Cal , having been born in the United States . Many don ' t know that , though , or are reluctant to apply for government assistance , leading to inevitable crises . ' We ' ve had families that come_in with horrendous doctor bills for whatever emergency , &quot; she said . &quot; They say , ' Please , can you do something because they ' re pestering us. ' &quot; The assault on dental problems also is moving slowly . Currently all Vaughn students receive an annual screening by a dentist from UCLA . Only those with the most urgent problems can be treated at the overburdened Parent Teacher Student Assn . dental program at nearby Telfair Elementary School . Trevino has received a donation of two used dental chairs and hopes to convert a bathroom on campus into a clinic staffed by volunteer dentists . &quot; The cost is astounding , &quot; she said . &quot; We ' re going to need something like $ 20 # 000 to do that , and we don ' t have that kind of money. &quot; In fact , the Family Center faces a struggle just to ensure its own existence . Its primary funding from the State_Department of Education expires after one more year . Proposals will be written for new sources of money . But , in the end , proponents of the experiment are counting_on a shift in public policy to come_to the rescue . &quot; Some of the thinking is to get agencies to redirect resources , &quot; Fleisher said . The Department of Children ' s Services , for example , might find that it has enough Vaughn children in its caseload to provide a social_worker at the school . &quot; United Way ' s intent is really to demonstrate that by doing business differently , we can get better outcomes , &quot; Fleisher said . Until those outcomes can be proved conclusively , a little faith may be required . &quot; The only way this thing is going_to work is for the public to say we ' re convinced this method is cost effective , so we ' re going to fund people to do this , &quot; Fleisher said .</TEXT>
