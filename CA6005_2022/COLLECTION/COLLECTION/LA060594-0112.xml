   <HEADLINE> CRUISE VIEWS : OVER LAND AND SEA TO ALASKA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Not many cruise_ships call_in Chicken , a tiny landlocked hamlet on a bumpy , unpaved road in northeastern Alaska about 250 miles from the nearest navigable water as the crow flies . But Alaska Highway Cruises does . This new Seattle-based company has come_up with such a fresh but obvious idea , it ' s a wonder nobody did_it before . The packages combine a Holland America Line Alaska cruise with an Alaska overland journey in a recreational_vehicle . The RVs can be picked_up in Washington or Canada for the trip to Alaska and turned_in at the port for a cruise back . You can also reverse the trip and begin with the cruise . One itinerary , the Glacier Route , sails between Vancouver , B.C. , and Seward , Alaska , calling_at Ketchikan , Juneau , Sitka and Valdez . Passengers sail aboard the Noordam or Nieuw Amsterdam , and may choose between a seven-night drive from Seward to Anchorage that includes visits to Denali National_Park and Fairbanks , or a 14-night overland excursion between Seward and Vancouver via the Alaska Highway with an option to detour up_to the Klondike or cross the scenic Cassiar Highway into the Yukon ' s remote Kluane National_Park . Passengers can opt to take either the cruise or the land portion first , but we would suggest getting the more strenuous land adventure over first , then settling into the lap of luxury on a cruise back . Alaska Highway Cruises provides 1994-model RVs that sleep two to six , along with a book of coupon vouchers for reserved campground spaces every night ; passengers buy their own gasoline and food . For our 3 # 100-mile journey , we spent roughly $ 600 on gas and oil and $ 400 on food and beverages on an accelerated nine-night version of the 14-night itinerary along the Alaska and Klondike Highways . We did not take the cruise portion . We started our trip in Seattle where an AHC representative met us at the airport and drove us to Anacortes , where the RVs for northbound travelers are parked in an attractive , wooded private campground called Scimitar Ridge . After learning how to handle the vehicle , program participants usually spend their first night here with vouchers for dinner and breakfast at a nearby restaurant , then set_out for Kamloops , British_Columbia , along the dramatic Coquihalla Highway . By getting_up and out early every morning , we spotted a fair amount of wildlife along the roadsides -- moose , caribou , white-tail deer , black_bear , a lone wolf , snowshoe_hares , porcupines , great_blue_heron , geese and bald_eagles . We tried to reach our destination for the night by mid-afternoon , but found it hard to go_to_sleep at 10 or 11 at night when the sun was still shining . For two people , the standard issue is a 1994-model 21-foot Fleetwood Jamboree Searcher , a Class C motor_home , which means the camper is built atop a pickup_truck ( in this case a Ford ) with sleeping accommodations for two in a windowed extension over the vehicle cab . Four or six adult passengers get a 27-foot vehicle with cab-over bed . Our favorite campground along the way was_on the outskirts of Prince George , B.C. , at Tabor Lake , where our closest neighbors were a pair of geese and two nesting pairs of horned grebes . The proprietor of the RV park , who also runs the elegant Log_Cabin Restaurant on the_hill , buzzed down to the campground on his moped , attired in his maitre d ' hotel tuxedo and bow_tie , to make_sure we were comfortably settled in . Top of the World Highway , a white-knuckle drive above tree_line on a dirt road along a narrow ridge between Dawson City and Chicken , was the most exciting part of the trip , especially where the snowpack encroached on at least half the roadway and there were no guardrails . In Chicken , a guided historic tour is available at 1 p.m. daily in the summer . The Chicken Saloon , Restaurant and Gift_Shop also presents sled_dog demonstrations in the snow season . When we drove_in about 10 a.m. , plumes of red dust trailing behind us , the sled_dogs perched atop their wooden posts perked_up as if it were show time , while a thin , bearded man who could have sprung from 1968 hippie days shuffled out_to our RV and murmured through the open window , &quot; Welcome to Chicken . Only the gift_shop and the saloon are open this morning. &quot; Another option is the Inside Passage , a seven-day round_trip sailing from Vancouver with port calls_at Ketchikan , Juneau and Sitka and a daylong cruise through Glacier Bay . A seven-night RV driving loop from Vancouver to Banff , Lake Louise and Jasper complements the Inside Passage sailing aboard the Westerdam or Maasdam . Prices begin at $ 1 # 995 per person , double occupancy , for a seven-night RV journey into the Canadian Rockies and a seven-day cruise on the Inside Passage , or $ 2 # 995 for a 14-night RV trip along the Alaska Highway with a seven-day cruise on the Glacier Route . A seven-night RV program around Denali with the seven-day Glacier Route cruise starts at $ 2 # 495 per person , double occupancy . These starting prices are for early season sailings and minimum-category inside ( windowless ) cabins on board ship . Upgrade supplements range from $ 50 to $ 4 # 050 per person additional for more expensive accommodations aboard ship . Children 2 and older sharing the shipboard stateroom with their parents only pay an additional $ 895- $ 1 # 595 for the package , depending_on the length of the RV portion of the trip . For a brochure , contact a travel_agent or call Alaska Highway Cruises at ( 800 ) 323-5757 . * Slater and Basch travel as guests of the cruise lines . Cruise Views appears the first and third week of every month .</TEXT>
