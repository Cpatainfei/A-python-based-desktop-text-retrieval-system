   <HEADLINE> U.S. SLIGHTLY ELEVATES TIES WITH TAIWAN ; DIPLOMACY : POLICY BOOSTS ECONOMIC CONTACT BUT KEEPS TIGHT CURBS ON OFFICIAL RELATIONS . TAIPEI AND BEIJING ARE DISPLEASED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration , completing the first full-scale review of U.S. contacts with Taiwan in 15 years , opened the way Wednesday for a slightly higher level of regular economic contact between Washington and Taipei but preserved a series of tight curbs on official relations between top-level political_leaders of the two governments . The changes appeared to please neither Beijing nor Taipei . While the Chinese government had no official response , it reportedly voiced a strong private protest , complaining that even the small new steps go too far toward giving official U.S. recognition to Taiwan . Taiwan also expressed disappointment . Its Washington office said in an official statement that the changes in U.S. policy &quot; have not sufficiently addressed the needs arising from the close relationship &quot; between the United States and Taiwan . A senior U.S. official said , &quot; We are trying to strengthen our unofficial economic and cultural ties ( with Taiwan ) , but we are also continuing our one-China policy. &quot; He insisted that &quot; both Beijing and Taiwan should be ecstatic &quot; about the changes . Under the new rules , approved by President Clinton after more_than a year of study , senior U.S. economic and technical officials will be authorized to visit Taiwan . And Taiwan will be permitted to change the name of its 13 unofficial offices in the United States from the baffling &quot; Coordination Council for North_American Affairs &quot; to a more identifiable &quot; Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office. &quot; However , largely in deference to China , which considers Taiwan a renegade province , the Administration also kept intact many of the detailed restrictions that were imposed when the United States established diplomatic relations with China and broke_off ties with Taiwan in 1979 . The new rules permit Taiwan ' s leaders to make &quot; transit &quot; stopovers in the United States . But Taiwan President Li Teng-hui , who remained inside his plane during a brief stopover in Honolulu earlier this year , will still be prohibited from visiting Washington and conducting official business in the United States . So will other top Taiwan officials . Taiwanese officials will still be barred from meetings at the White_House , the Executive Office_Building and the State_Department . Sen . Paul Simon ( D-Ill. ) , a longtime supporter of upgrading U.S. ties with Taiwan , called the changes &quot; small steps and this was an opportunity for truly significant , constructive and realistic adjustments . . . . Many of the terms of our relations with Taiwan were outdated long ago . Today , they seem like official pettiness. &quot; What was once China ' s Nationalist government fled to Taiwan and established its headquarters there after the end of the Chinese civil_war in 1949 . For more_than three decades after that , the Nationalists maintained that they were the legitimate government for all_of China . In recent years they have gradually abandoned this claim , opening the way both for democratic elections in Taiwan and for contacts between Taiwan and the mainland . The continuing awkwardness in U.S. dealings with Taiwan was_on display Wednesday when the Clinton_Administration announced its new policy . Even though the policy included a series of detailed steps , State_Department officials refused to release a written accounting of them -- apparently because that might have been perceived by China as official State_Department recognition of Taiwan . Remarks to reporters by a top State_Department official were not transcribed for a written record , as they customarily are . By permitting senior U.S. economic officials to visit Taiwan , the Clinton_Administration is , in_effect , giving permanent status to changes that were imposed in the final days of the George_Bush Administration . After the 1992 elections , Carla Anderson Hills , then the U.S. trade representative , visited Taiwan -- the first Cabinet-level official to do so since 1979 . Brown University Prof . Michael Ying-mao Kau said Wednesday that the Administration ' s new policy is &quot; very much a political response to lots of pressure from Congress , particularly after the humiliation of Lee Teng-hui. &quot; He said that people in Taiwan could gain some satisfaction from the changes . &quot; Even though it doesn ' t go as far as a two-China policy , the direction is certainly laid , &quot; Kau said . &quot; You have an improving relationship that shows movement in that direction. &quot; However , James R . Lilley , former U.S. ambassador to China and now a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute , called the Administration ' s policy review &quot; basically a nothing . . . . I just don ' t see anything new in it. &quot; Ralph Clough , a Taiwan expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies , said : &quot; I don ' t know why it took ( the Clinton_Administration ) so_long to make such small steps . But they are useful and will help to improve the links between the United States and Taiwan , and I don ' t think it will do anything to harm relations with the People ' s Republic of China. &quot; Taiwan is now America ' s sixth-leading trading partner , with $ 41 billion in trade between the two last year , which is still considerably higher than U.S. trade with China . And Taiwan has about $ 90-billion worth of foreign-currency reserves , more_than any nation in the world except Japan .</TEXT>
