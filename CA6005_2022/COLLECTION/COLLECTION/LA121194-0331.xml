   <HEADLINE> MAHONY STRESSES BROTHERHOOD IN TALK TO VALLEY JEWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cardinal Roger M . Mahony of Los Angeles , speaking at a Sabbath service in the San Fernando Valley ' s largest synagogue , praised the establishment of diplomatic relations this year between Israel and the Vatican , saying Jews and Catholics can now truly call each other brothers and sisters . &quot; We are no longer strangers to one another , but you are our elder brothers and sisters , &quot; Mahony said Friday night to 1 # 200 members of Valley Beth Shalom and guests , including Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan , who read a portion of Scripture in the service . &quot; No longer does the lack of full diplomatic relations between the Holy_See and the state of Israel divert us from other important areas of dialogue , &quot; said Mahony , who has led the Los Angeles Catholic Archdiocese since 1985 . Rabbi Harold Schulweis of the host synagogue said that Jews take_heart from Pope John Paul II ' s formal remembrances of the Holocaust and his declared intention , despite poor health , to travel eventually to the Holy_Land . &quot; We pray for the health of the Pope , who enters the annals of Jewish history as a man of compassion , conscience , vision and reconciliation , &quot; said Schulweis , responding to Mahony before the Conservative Jewish congregation . * The visit by Mahony , which was not his first to a Los Angeles synagogue worship service , focused_on the steadily improving relations between Jews and Catholics since the Second Vatican Council ( 1962-65 ) and recent Popes ' repudiation of anti-Semitism and recognition of Judaism as a vibrant faith in its own_right , not merely a precursor to Christianity . But , as the cardinal noted , given the painful history of Christian persecution of Jews in centuries past and controversies surrounding the Catholic_church ' s actions during the Nazi-era Holocaust , &quot; it is no wonder that many American Jews viewed with suspicion the Holy_See ' s seeming reluctance &quot; to recognize the state of Israel by establishing diplomatic ties . Last December , however , Israel and the Vatican announced their intention to exchange ambassadors , which they did several months later . Mahony emphasized in his Friday night talk that the primary obstacle to recognizing Israel was not religious or theological , but a practical matter of protecting the rights and safety of Arab Catholics living_in and near Israel . &quot; Up to now , the issue of full diplomatic relations . . . has been seen by many American Jews as solely a matter of the Catholic_Church accepting Judaism and the Jewish people as a continuing valid response to God ' s covenant made with them through Abraham , &quot; the cardinal said . &quot; But , in fact , it has been the precarious plight of Palestinian Catholics both within and outside Israel which has preoccupied the pastoral concern of the Vatican , &quot; Mahony said . He said that many Arab Christians on the West_Bank were being pressured from one side by Arab Muslims to support certain political positions and from the Israeli side to accept school and university closings and a bleak economic outlook under Israeli occupation . Only when Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) signaled the start of peace negotiations last year &quot; did_it become ' safe , ' as it were , for the Holy_See to move closer to full diplomatic ties , &quot; Mahony said . Another sticking point in relations between Catholics and Jews in the past was the longtime insistence by the Vatican that Jerusalem become an &quot; international city &quot; rather than fall_under the government of Israel alone . Mahony said the Vatican has quietly abandoned that notion &quot; and sought rather ' international guarantees ' to the city. &quot; Told of Mahony ' s comments that the Vatican had been worried about Catholics in Israel , Moshe Benzioni , Israeli deputy consul general in Los Angeles , said he was surprised by the cardinal ' s emphasis on those points in his speech . However , Benzioni added , &quot; Relations with the Vatican are good ; there are really not outstanding issues anymore . We are quite flattered that the cardinal sought to address a Jewish audience on this. &quot; Msgr . Royale Vadakin of Los Angeles , a local pioneer in Catholic-Jewish relations , said the Vatican ' s non-recognition of Israel was always raised at otherwise cordial interfaith dialogues in Southern California . &quot; By his presence ( at Valley Beth Shalom ) , Cardinal Mahony signals locally that this is now a resolved issue , &quot; Vadakin said .</TEXT>
