   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : JAPAN ' S ECONOMY IS DEJA VU FOR AMERICANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Behind the loud and public trade disputes with the United States , important changes are occurring in Japan ' s economy that should be reassuring to investors , business people and politicians in both countries . Most immediate is recovery from recession . &quot; We think the economy has bottomed ; consumption is increasing and the economy is beginning to grow again , &quot; says Takashi Kiuchi , chief economist of the Long-Term Credit Bank_of_Japan , one of the institutions most responsible_for financing Japanese industry ' s rise to global prominence . And that ' s good news everywhere . With $ 3 trillion a year in goods and services , Japan ' s economy generates a lot of business worldwide , including about $ 60 billion from the United States . Yes , that is less than the $ 100 billion-plus in goods and services that the United States buys each year from Japan , hence the trade problem between Tokyo and Washington . In response to U.S. demands for a reduction of that trade_deficit , Japan Tuesday announced deregulation measures for nine industries , from construction to insurance , opening them to foreign competition . The moves were cautious and unspecific , however . They represent progress , U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Tuesday , although not enough to &quot; meet U.S. concerns. &quot; So trade arguments will continue , but most likely in a friendly manner . Both sides understand that the real issue is that Japan adapt its economy to the world , buying freely from other countries as well as selling to them . Toward that end , Japan has begun restructuring its industry in ways that will be familiar to Americans who have lived through a decade of downsizing , layoffs and intense business competition . In fact , if you think_of American-style discount_stores or of how the U.S._government handled the savings and loan crisis and the problem of ailing banks , you can predict developments in Japan in the next few years . Japanese consumers will lead this economic recovery , a departure from the past . The discount_store phenomenon is growing rapidly , attracting customers and the attention of international investment managers . Michael Steinberg , who analyzes Japanese stocks for Nomura Securities in New York , likes Kato Denki , an electronics chain that sells Panasonic , Sony and other brands at a discount because it buys_in volume from the manufacturers -- a standard practice in U.S. retailing but a revolution in Japan . Michael Lindsell , the Tokyo-based investment manager for GT Global Japan Fund , favors Autobacs 7 , a company that is able to sell automobile accessories at prices half its competitors ' because it imports Japanese auto parts -- from plants in Asia or the United States -- or it gets volume discounts from manufacturers in Japan . * Discounting is not a simple matter in Japan . On one hand , it is directly related to U.S. trade concerns . Japan used to be the land of controlled markets and prices , which gave Japanese companies high profits in the home market to make them more competitive abroad . Now , companies can ' t raise prices to earn profits , so they are being forced to cut costs . And that is leading to downsizing and layoffs and a shift in the informal Japanese retirement system . Japan ' s multiple-layered and controlled retail markets served as a kind of retirement_plan for a system from which employees retire at age 55 with only small pensions . Jobs in small shops were a way for retirees to earn income , but such mom-and-pop stores can ' t survive in the competitive environment now growing_up in Japan . Major layoffs have not yet hit the big companies , says Lindsell . But almost 70 % of Japanese employees work for smaller firms , and more_than 100 # 000 people are losing their jobs each year because small companies are going bankrupt , writes Alexander Kinmont , Tokyo-based investment strategist for Morgan Stanley . Why has Japan ' s economy , which seemed impregnable a_few years ago , hit such difficulties ? Because the money stopped , just as it did_in the United States when banks and S &amp; Ls ran_afoul of bad loans . In Japan , where real_estate prices were bid up_to giddy heights -- a square_block of Tokyo was said to be worth as much as all_of California -- problems were inevitable and have turned_out to be huge . The major banks have been left with an estimated $ 250 billion of bad loans , a sum greater than all_the losses in the American S &amp; L mess . Japan ' s response has mirrored that of the U.S._government . The Bank_of_Japan , the equivalent of the Federal_Reserve , is lowering short-term interest_rates so banks can borrow cheaply , invest in long-term government_bonds and earn profits to repair their balance_sheets . Meanwhile , the bad real_estate loans are being placed in separate subsidiary_companies -- Resolution Trust Corps . by another name -- and sold_off to private investors at discounts . Amid all_of this , Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa is trying to change the political_system to make government more responsive to urban voters and consumers . And he is encountering fierce opposition , with political opponents investigating his tax_returns -- shades of his opposite_number , President Clinton . * &quot; I call Japan a clone of the United States , &quot; says a Japanese investment manager who finds deja_vu reassuring . He notes that many of the problems Japan is facing today have been dealt with in the last decade or so by U.S. business and government . And , just as predictions of doom regarding the S &amp; L mess , competitiveness or bank loans proved wrong here , so Japan ' s economy and society are likely to emerge stronger from their present trials . Maybe that ' s why some U.S. pension and mutual_fund managers are investing in Japan ' s market today , as alarmists worry about trade wars and stocks tumble in both countries . Long-term investors know from experience that worry is loud , but progress is_quiet .</TEXT>
