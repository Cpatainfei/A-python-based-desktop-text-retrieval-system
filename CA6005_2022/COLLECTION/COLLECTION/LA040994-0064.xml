   <HEADLINE> CRIMEA-UKRAINE TENSIONS RISE WITH DUELING DECREES ; POLITICS : KRAVCHUK STRIKES BACK AFTER PRESIDENT OF INDEPENDENCE-MINDED REGION ISSUES ORDERS ON DRAFTEES , TIME_ZONE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The government and the separatist-minded Crimean region have launched a battle of decrees , and the tit-for-tat volley is causing concern that the paper war could escalate into a real one . Armed with what he considers a popular mandate to make the Black_Sea peninsula independent , Crimean President Yuri Meshkov ordered Crimean draftees in the Ukrainian armed forces to serve their duty on the peninsula . Then he put Crimea on Moscow time , one hour ahead of the rest of Ukraine ; defied Kiev by holding a referendum on expanding Crimea ' s autonomy as well as his own powers , and fired the Kiev-appointed head of Crimean television , who had refused to give Meshkov ' s legislative candidates more_than equal time . After what his critics called too long and tolerant a silence , Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk fired off his own decrees . While the Crimean leader was traveling with his family in Cyprus this week , Kravchuk rescinded Meshkov ' s ukase on the draft and reinstated the television executive . He dispatched a trouble-shooter to keep_an_eye_on the increasingly volatile peninsula . Crimean clocks , however , remain on Moscow time . &quot; Ukraine ' s leadership is willing to give the Crimea the widest economic autonomy , &quot; Kravchuk said . &quot; But we will not agree to increasing its military or political powers. &quot; Returning home Wednesday , Meshkov dismissed the counter-decrees as &quot; political provocations. &quot; One of his aides said Friday , &quot; We will do what we promised. &quot; Meshkov ' s real power is limited . He has no direct control of troops or police -- no way to enforce his decrees with muscle . But popular support for independence could work to his advantage . For example , a Ukrainian army that already has trouble conscripting Crimean men might be persuaded to let them serve on the peninsula if the alternative is a higher rate of draft-dodging and desertion . The Crimean president , elected over a pro-Ukrainian candidate Jan . 30 , seems to wield a powerful mandate . Almost 80 % of those who took_part in his March 27 referendum voted &quot; yes &quot; on a constitutional question that , in_effect , declared Crimea independent . Candidates favoring independence and closer ties with Russia led in Crimean legislative elections on the same day . Although the referendum is not legally binding , Oleksandr Kulyk , editor of the peninsula ' s only Ukrainian newspaper , predicts that &quot; within six months , the forces that have seated Meshkov on his throne will use this ' innocent ' poll to push him into more separatist exploits. &quot; Other critics point_out that because the voter_turnout was 60 % of those eligible , the 80 % of voters who supported independence amount to less than half the Crimean electorate . They say that Meshkov ' s radicalism could polarize the peninsula between the urban , Russian-dominated south and the agricultural , Ukrainian-leaning north . &quot; No one wants to be another Yugoslavia , but this is leading to confrontation , &quot; said Vasyl Bohutsky , who also works for the Ukrainian newspaper . &quot; We are all alarmed. &quot; In the tinderbox of Crimean-Ukrainian relations , even a comedy of errors can have ominous overtones . So when Adm . Eduard Baltin , the Russian commander of the Black_Sea Fleet , was shot in the thigh last weekend , Crimea was abuzz with rumors of assassination plots by Ukrainian nationalists . That is , until the fleet ' s press office revealed that Baltin ' s gun went_off accidentally while he was at his dacha . Then , when a Ukrainian military delegation visited the convalescing admiral in his Crimean hospital_room , Russian television reported that Ukraine was beefing_up its forces on the peninsula . Taking the report seriously , Meshkov ' s chief_of_staff accused Kiev of trying to block Meshkov ' s return from Cyprus . Meshkov was , indeed , having problems getting home . Turkey refused permission for his chartered flight to cross its airspace . But Ukrainian officials say there was hardly_a plot afoot . In his zeal to prove Crimea ' s independence , Meshkov ignored the Ukrainian Foreign Ministry and traveled without a proper passport . Bohutsky , the Ukrainian journalist in Crimea , believes the episode is just a taste of things to come . &quot; Just watch , no matter what goes_wrong in Crimea , Meshkov will blame it all on Kiev and Kravchuk , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
