   <HEADLINE> BERRY PETROLEUM PLEADS NO CONTEST IN OIL SPILL ; PENALTY : COMPANY ORDERED TO PAY $ 600 # 000 TO SETTLE CRIMINAL COMPLAINT OVER DECEMBER PIPELINE RUPTURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The parent company of the Ventura oil firm that spilled 84 # 000 gallons of heavy crude into McGrath Lake near Oxnard last December agreed Wednesday to pay $ 600 # 000 to settle a criminal complaint brought by local prosecutors . Berry Petroleum executives pleaded no contest Wednesday in Ventura County Municipal Court to a single misdemeanor charge of failing to report the spill , effectively ending the criminal side of the lengthy court case . But the plea does not insulate the company from an ongoing civil case being prepared by the state_attorney general ' s office . Ralph Edmonds of Ventura , the chief foreman on_duty during the spill that lasted four days , also pleaded no contest Wednesday through his attorney to a misdemeanor charge of illegally releasing oil into marine waters . He was ordered to perform 320 hours of beach cleanup and serve 18 months probation . Both no contest pleas amount to guilty pleas , although they cannot be used as evidence against either Berry Petroleum , which owns Bush Oil , or Edmonds in the civil case now being pieced together by state regulators . They also eliminate the possibility of prison time for Berry Petroleum executives or Bush Oil Co . workers , a threat made by local prosecutors in the early days of the two-month cleanup . The settlement money will be divided among Ventura County courts , the district_attorney ' s office and two environmental enhancement funds operated by the state to restore damaged habitats . Under the plea agreement , the district_attorney ' s office will receive more_than $ 200 # 000 of the penalties -- reimbursement for attorney fees and prosecution costs . Another $ 300 # 000 will go_to the state_Department of Fish and Game ' s Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response , which will fund various environmental projects . About $ 27 # 000 will be given to the state treasury ' s environmental fund , and the courts will get_about $ 73 # 000 . The agreement does not include potential costs to Berry for the government ' s response and investigation of the massive spill , which closed seven miles of beaches , killed hundreds of birds and soiled the environmentally sensitive McGrath Lake . Nor does_it preclude federal agencies such_as the Environmental Protection Agency or the U.S. Coast Guard from proceeding with criminal charges against Berry principles or employees . Glen M . Reiser , the Oxnard attorney retained earlier this year by the district_attorney ' s office to prosecute the case , said the settlement was a good_deal for Ventura County , which suffered significant environmental damage because of the spill . He said Berry Petroleum failed to adequately ensure the safe transport of its crude_oil , and that the company was &quot; absolutely &quot; cutting corners to save money . &quot; Their economic performance was not as substantial as they wanted it to be at that time , &quot; Reiser said of Delaware-based Berry Petroleum . For instance , he said , the company opted to use a long-abandoned pipeline to move its oil across Harbor Boulevard instead of trucking it , the prior lease operator ' s method of transport . But Berry officials accused the district_attorney of denying the company a fair opportunity to prove its innocence . Vice_President Raymond Hatch said the company would have preferred to take the case to trial , but said it was cheaper to settle . &quot; This case presents a situation in which the almighty dollar blurred the vision of those in government who are obligated to seek the truth and do_justice , &quot; Hatch said . Hatch and his lawyers complained at a news_conference Wednesday that the district_attorney never conducted metallurgical tests on the ruptured pipeline , thereby never proving Berry ' s negligence . &quot; It is unthinkable that our government officials can assert to its citizens that they have ' investigated ' this accidental pipeline rupture when they have refused to test the actual pipeline , &quot; Hatch said . But Reiser said it would have been a waste of taxpayer money to spend $ 10 # 000 or more testing the ruptured pipe . &quot; Every indication we have leads to the inescapable conclusion that this leak was the result of excess pressure in a corroded , unprotected pipeline , &quot; he said . As for the monetary fines , Reiser said : &quot; If enhancing the environment is bowing to the almighty dollar , then I ' m on the wrong planet. &quot; Attorneys for Berry Petroleum already have filed claims with at least six local and state law_enforcement agencies , claiming that those agencies failed to respond to earlier reports of the spill , which was not discovered until last Christmas morning . The claims say that visitors to McGrath Lake in the days before Christmas told state park rangers and other officials about oil sightings , but that investigators neglected to check_out those reports . But prosecutors said that apparent oversight does not alleviate Berry ' s liability , in part because they failed to report or adequately repair another leak in the same pipe on Dec . 16 -- five days before the more serious spill . &quot; The company was in control of the operations , &quot; said Gregory W . Broce who heads the environmental unit at the district_attorney ' s office . &quot; This whole event would not have occurred if the company had done what it should have done. &quot; Meanwhile , investigators may order further cleanup at the site . Broce said he found clumps of oil just underneath the sand at McGrath Lake last month . He displayed photographs taken_in July that show thick globs of what appears to be crude_oil just beneath the surface at the shoreline . &quot; You can ' t dig_up the whole beach , &quot; he said . &quot; Mother Nature has to take its course. &quot; But Fish and Game attorney Stephen L . Sawyer , who is assembling the civil case against Berry Petroleum , said he might order another cleanup effort &quot; very soon &quot; after viewing the photographs for the first time Wednesday . &quot; What we may do is go_back into a cleanup mode and order Berry to go_back in , &quot; Sawyer said . Berry maintained Wednesday that its cleanup efforts , which cost the firm $ 8.3 million , were complete and effective in restoring the habitat . Company officials offered photographs taken last month of endangered Western snowy plovers returning to the area as proof that the lake and beach are clean .</TEXT>
