   <HEADLINE> BOOK_REVIEW : SCIENCE ; ONE MAN ' S QUEST FOR PROOF OF THE BIG BANG ; WRINKLES IN TIME , BY GEORGE SMOOT AND KEAY DAVIDSON , WILLIAM MORROW AND COMPANY INC . $ 25 , 331 PAGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Once upon a time not very long ago , cosmology -- the study of the nature and origins of the universe -- was a scientific specialty somewhere between theology and history . Great minds pondered the stars and applied mathematics to extrapolations from their observations about the size of the universe , its future and its past . By the middle of this century , these great minds ( and some lesser ones ) had divided into two camps . Those in the first argued that there had been a creation , a &quot; big bang &quot; that brought_forth space-time from a &quot; singularity , &quot; and that this space-time , our universe , has been expanding ever since . Such an enormous event , a pair of astronomers suggested in 1948 , would have left an afterglow of background_radiation . Those in the second camp maintained that the universe has always been and will continue to exist in a steady state , operating under the same rules . To assume that the universe had a beginning , they argued , implies an end or a cooling_down , and this they took as unacceptable . Besides , there was no evidence of any primal event . Then in 1964 , two researchers at Bell Labs , who had been investigating something entirely different , detected faint microwave radiation coming from all directions in the sky -- the predicted afterglow of creation , and a boost to big-bang believers . The discovery of background_radiation occurred just as the sciences of particle physics and astronomy were merging into the new discipline of astrophysics . Giant accelerators here on Earth were producing some of the same particles that astronomers detected in space . Suddenly , cosmology had become an experimental science . Enter George Smoot . &quot; Wrinkles in Time &quot; is Smoot ' s memoir of his quest_for evidence of the big bang , from the time he entered graduate_school at MIT in 1970 through the success of COBE , the Cosmic Background Explorer in 1992 . Written in collaboration with science writer Keay Davidson , the voice we hear is Smoot ' s , but the fast pace , lucid explanations of astrophysics and sensuous detail of high adventure in the Brazilian rain_forest are probably Davidson ' s . Smoot recounts the on-going rivalry between cosmologists , crediting the contributions of such scientists as Vera Rubin , who was ignored when , as a young_woman in 1950 , she suggested that the universe might not be as homogenous as expected . &quot; Wrinkles in Time &quot; skillfully combines descriptions of Smoot ' s day-to-day life as a hands-on scientist with explanations of the ways astronomers like Rubin have accounted_for the movement of the stars , missing or dark matter , black_holes and the Great Attractor . Except for a reference_to time spent in Alaska as a child , Smoot doesn ' t tell us much about his life before 1970 . We join him as he decides to build delicate instruments to detect rare particles and finds places for the instruments on a Cold-War retired U-2 spy plane , in the gondola of a Brazilian balloon , on a frozen lake in Antarctica and , finally , aboard the NASA-sponsored COBE . Always aware of the errors of predecessors and colleagues , Smoot is mindful of the importance of negative evidence , such_as his failure to find cosmic antimatter ( just as Michelson and Morley failed to find any &quot; ether &quot; when they tried to measure it in 1887 ) . Smoot remains wary of the possibility of confounding background_noise for the signals he seeks , or of omitting some simple test . Consequently , he pushes his team to go the extra mile , checking and rechecking their data . All the while , we learn , Smoot ' s team is competing with other cosmologists . Fearful of a leak , they use only vague generalities when exchanging information over the open lines of E-mail and give no hint of their progress in processing the data that slowly come_in from COBE . Of course , we know from the beginning of this story that COBE succeeded spectacularly , producing images of what Smoot calls &quot; the primordial seeds of modern-day structures such_as galaxies , clusters of galaxies , and so on . . . huge ripples in the fabric of space-time. &quot; These slight irregularities show that from the start , there was an uneven distribution of energy and matter in the universe that congealed into the galaxies , solar_systems and life-bearing planet we know as home . Although never diffident and obviously pleased with COBE ' s success , Smoot is nevertheless humble before &quot; the ultimate simplicity and power of the creativity of physical nature. &quot; Excellent diagrams and color illustrations put &quot; Wrinkles in Time &quot; over the top as a splendid history of the universe as we see it near the end of the 20th Century .</TEXT>
