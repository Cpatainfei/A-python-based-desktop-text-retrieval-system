   <HEADLINE> HEAT EASES , BUT FIRES STILL BURN ; WEATHER : RISING HUMIDITY MAKES IT SEEM HOTTER , FORECASTERS SAY . HIGH_TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO RETURN FOR THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The enduring heat_wave eased only temporarily Monday , and firefighters continued their battle against four wildfires that had scorched more_than 12 # 000 acres of brush and timberland , destroying 10 homes , incinerating about 50 vehicles and injuring at least eight people . Although Monday ' s high_temperatures generally were 5 to 10 degrees below the marks that shattered some Southland records Sunday , it was still plenty hot , with top readings of well_over 100 in many Los Angeles-area communities . Rising humidity made_it seem even hotter , and the National Weather Service issued a special &quot; excessive heat &quot; advisory warning that &quot; a potentially dangerous combination of heat and humidity is developing in the valleys . . . of Southern California. &quot; While temperatures topped out at 105 in the San Fernando and San Gabriel valleys on Monday , humid air_pumped in from a tropical storm system over Baja California made_it seem 5 to 10 degrees hotter , the weather service said . The moist air triggered some strong thunderstorms over the San Bernardino Mountains and the western Mojave_Desert on Monday afternoon . Residents of Victorville , Apple Valley and Barstow were warned of possible flash_floods . Curtis Brack , a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc. , said that while the humidity will drop a little as the week progresses , the temperatures will start rising again , with hot_weather expected through the extended Fourth_of_July weekend . Noting that people working outside for extended periods will be susceptible to sunstroke , heat cramps and heat_exhaustion , the weather service advisory suggested drinking lots of water and reducing activity levels whenever possible . The most destructive of the fires -- a 2 # 820-acre blaze northwest of the San Gabriel Mountain community of Wrightwood -- was 95 % contained Monday night after burning 10 houses and dozens of trucks and cars , said Jaquie Stiver , a U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman . Stiver said four of the more_than 1 # 300 firefighters brought_in from across the Southwest suffered minor injuries . The blaze was started by a campfire near a Boy_Scout camp , but Stiver stressed that Scouts were not responsible . Breezes in the Wrightwood area were light Monday , and the slow spread of the fire permitted the release of water-dropping planes to other blazes still raging out of control . Twenty miles to the west , near Soledad Pass , a brush_fire in Kentucky Springs Canyon was about half contained after charring more_than 3 # 500 acres of chaparral . Stiver said four more firefighters sustained minor injuries fighting that blaze , which was started by a tracer_bullet deflected from a target at a rifle_range . Almost 1 # 000 firefighters were battling the Soledad fire at nightfall Monday . In Riverside County , more_than 500 firefighters were struggling to control a blaze that had consumed about 1 # 500 acres of dense brush in the Anza area by Monday afternoon . The going was hot and slow , and with the fire only 40 % contained by midafternoon , officials said it probably would be sometime late today before the fire is fully contained . In the Cleveland National Forest , a 4 # 200-acre fire roared out of control Monday afternoon , chewing its way rapidly through heavy brush a_few miles east of the San Diego County community of Ramona . A fire official said the 330 firefighters on the lines had managed to contain only about 10 % of the blaze . He made no predictions when the fire would be controlled . For firefighters , the forecast was not good . Temperatures are expected to rise a_couple_of degrees a day through Wednesday , and while dropping humidity will make the heat a little more bearable , the drier air will increase the fire hazard . The high_temperature at Los Angeles Civic Center was 94 degrees Monday , seven degrees below Sunday ' s top mark of 101 . Monday ' s overnight low was 73 , tying the record for the warmest minimum on a June 27 , set_in 1990 . The relative_humidity ranged between 29 % and 75 % . Other high_temperatures Monday included 106 in Woodland Hills , 105 in Pasadena , 102 in Monrovia , 96 in San Gabriel , 95 in El Toro , 88 in Torrance , 83 at Los Angeles International Airport and 74 in Newport Beach . Brack said the continuing heat is the product of an immense dome of high_pressure -- centered over Arizona -- that is refusing to budge . He said that as long as the dome stays_in_place , it will block the onshore flow of cool breezes from the ocean . &quot; Right now , it looks_like not much change through the weekend , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s gonna stay hot. &quot;</TEXT>
