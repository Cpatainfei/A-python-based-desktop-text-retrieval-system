   <HEADLINE> UCLA PAID $ 1 MILLION IN CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENTS ; DOCUMENTS : THE FOUR CASES INVOLVED WOMEN WHO WERE RAPED , HARASSED OR FACED DISCRIMINATION . COURT_ORDERS SCHOOL TO RELEASE DETAILS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> UCLA has paid_out more_than $ 1 million in confidential settlements over four years to women who were raped , sexually harassed or faced gender discrimination at the Westwood school , documents released Friday show . In one case , the school paid $ 300 # 000 to a female student who was raped by two men at Reiber Hall , a student dormitory , and in another it paid $ 330 # 000 to an employee who was allegedly raped , molested and subjected_to sexual abuse by a supervisor described by the employee ' s attorney as a figure of &quot; power and prestige within the university. &quot; More_than 1 # 600 pages of documents from four secret settlements were released this week under a recent court_order obtained by the Daily Bruin , the UCLA student newspaper . The Bruin filed its lawsuit after Chancellor Charles E . Young mentioned the settlements in a 1992 news_conference but refused to provide further details . Joe Mandel , UCLA ' s vice_chancellor for legal affairs , said Friday that university officials consider any case of sexual misconduct or discrimination regrettable , but he said the number and amounts of the confidential settlements were modest for a campus with 20 # 000 employees , 33 # 000 students and an annual budget of $ 1.5 billion . Mandel said the confidential settlements were intended to do the right thing for the victims while saving taxpayers money by avoiding the potential expense of litigation . The attorney for one of the victims , however , said UCLA ' s response to her client ' s sexual_harassment allegations were pitiful and excruciatingly slow . Lisa Bloom , the attorney , also said it was the university , not her client , who insisted the final 1993 settlement be confidential . The documents show that UCLA agreed to pay more_than $ 163 # 000 to Bloom ' s client , a former manager in the school ' s Department of Business_Enterprises who supervised a crew of 40 to 60 student employees . The woman complained that on her first day of work in 1988 , her boss came_into the room and unzipped his pants to tuck his shirt in . She also complained that he made profane and sexual remarks , discussed his vasectomy and its subsequent reversal , and once declared that he was going_home to have &quot; industrial sex &quot; with his wife to conceive a child . An internal university fact-finding report , dated July , 1992 , upheld the woman ' s complaints and confirmed that her supervisor ' s behavior contributed to a department &quot; filled with sexual language , gestures , racial jokes , stories of rape and even an alleged suicide attempt. &quot; Mandel said the supervisor was fired . In another case , UCLA agreed in May , 1990 , to pay $ 330 # 000 to a woman who accused a married faculty_member of coercing her into having sexual contact as a condition of her employment . She said the faculty_member raped her twice one evening in his home , then continued to harass her on campus by groping her , making sexual remarks and locking her in his office to watch him masturbate . The woman eventually suffered an emotional breakdown . Although the faculty_member maintained that the sexual_relationship was consensual , the university concluded that the woman was a victim of sexual_harassment . Mandel said Friday that the faculty_member was suspended without pay in the wake of the allegations but gave no other details . In a third case , UCLA paid $ 300 # 000 in 1990 to a female student who was raped by two intruders in January , 1987 , in Reiber Hall . Her attorney , Daniel C . Cathcart , said Friday that the university agreed to the settlement after a civil court jury deadlocked over charges that UCLA was negligent because it failed to provide security in the dorm . Cathcart said security at the dorm was like &quot; Swiss_cheese &quot; although officials had plenty of warning about potential problems , including complaints about Peeping Toms looking_into the women ' s showers . The attorney said his client took the settlement because she didn ' t want to &quot; go_through the trauma of a second trial. &quot; In the fourth case , UCLA paid $ 255 # 000 in 1992 to a woman who said she was discriminated against on_the_job because of medical leave she took_in the early 1980s due_to complications from a pregnancy . The woman said she was harassed because she wanted to work a four-day schedule .</TEXT>
