   <TEXT> If point scores were awarded for understatement , our captain on the Queen of Nanaimo ferry would have earned a 9.9. &quot; Uh , anyone who happens to be standing on the starboard side may notice a_couple_of whales , &quot; he droned in his best monotone . ( In keeping with their supposed national character , Canadians feel they have an obligation to convey an aura of quiet calm. ) Immediately the ferry tilted to starboard as the boat ' s complement of passengers rushed to the rail . There , just yards away , as we plied between Mayne and Galiano islands in the Strait of Georgia , four huge killer_whales were either having a whale of a lot of fun or engaged in an immodest display of courtship . One of the &quot; couples &quot; leaped into the air and then flopped down , spraying water in all directions in a backward belly_flop . A few minutes later , another of the orcas made a shallow dive only to remain perpendicular , waving its tail_fins at the boat . The lady from Munich next to me at the rail looked as if her lottery number had just been announced . &quot; These whales , they are trained , yes ? &quot; she said . I assured her that no , they were indeed wild orcas and that we didn ' t allow Disney-fabricated mammals north of the 49th Parallel . Even though I live_in British_Columbia , I don ' t get_over to the splendid Gulf Islands too often -- nor do I often see spontaneous whale performances . But it was June when I related the whale incident to my B &amp; B hostess on Galiano Island , and already my third visit for the year . &quot; that ' s nothing , &quot; she said . &quot; Last August , there were not one , but two pods of killer_whales with 35 or 40 whales each that played_around in Active Pass for almost an hour. &quot; If sights like this give you goose bumps , they ' re only a taste of what awaits in Canada ' s exquisite Gulf Islands . Riding the ferries between the islands , one is likely to see porpoise , otters , sea_lions and birds of every color . Bald eagles are so abundant in places that they are considered a nuisance because they edge out resident cormorants . On all_the islands there are miles of shoreline without a single cottage . Mountain_peaks and mountain_trails . Deserted beaches . The finest cruising and sailing anywhere . Even though Vancouver and Victoria are both kissed by the Japanese current , bringing a mild climate ( and less rain than Seattle ) , the Gulf Islands go one better . Tucked into the rain-shadow of Vancouver Island , they are remarkably dry , and have a climate that at times and in places feels almost Mediterranean -- with much more sunshine and warmer temperatures year round than any other place in British_Columbia . Cactus can be found on some of the islands along with tropical palms and flourishing artichokes . About 200 islands lie_in the Strait of Georgia between Vancouver on the mainland and Vancouver Island , but only five have regular ferry service , a substantial resident population and services for visitors : Salt Spring , Galiano , Mayne , North and South Pender and Saturna . These five form the northern or Canadian extension of Washington state ' s San Juan Islands . B.C. Ferries have numerous sailings every day from Swartz Bay on Vancouver Island and from the harbor at Tsawwassen , about 25 miles south of the city of Vancouver , to the various islands . You can see the islands in a day trip from Vancouver , but that would be missing the whole point of going there . All the islands are mountainous in appearance with rugged shorelines , immense bluffs and sheer cliffs that plunge into the sea . There are wide , dazzlingly white beaches layered with crushed shells that have accumulated over the centuries . The roads are draped with gnarled Garry oaks and twisted red arbutus trees . Wildflowers and berries grow in abundance . Each has a distinct personality , but what they all offer in abundance is tranquillity and decompression from the stresses of contemporary life . You won ' t find a Hilton or a Sheraton anywhere , but there are_quiet guest houses , small elite hotels that seem to have been plucked out of the_English countryside and a_few discreet motels . The unspoken law everywhere seems to be come , enjoy , but don ' t start a stampede . Salt Spring On a hot Sunday afternoon , a small group of Vesuvius Bay residents are sitting around in lawn_chairs at the Arbutus Court Motel for the first meeting of a committee with a very serious purpose . The ferry from Vesuvius Bay to Crofton has , because of a bureaucratic whim , all_of a sudden started to toot on arrival and departure . &quot; When the damn thing goes , I practically have to peel myself off the ceiling , &quot; says one angry homeowner . A letter campaign is quickly organized , government representatives to be contacted identified , tactics and counter-tactics discussed . A dozen citizens have put_on their armor and are girded for battle . Despite its small population of 9 # 500 , a good percentage of these islanders are people who know how to get things done . Among its residents , the island has a strong core of Canadian and U.S. celebrities , such_as actor / director Goldie Hawn and painter Robert Bateman , retired lawyers , judges , industrialists and a strong core of activists . Salt Spring is the largest , most developed and most visited of the islands -- which simply means that it has an actual village , Ganges , on the east_side , with such services as a bookstore , bank , soap factory , a_couple_of specialty_stores and the_like . The island even has a movie_theater in an old community hall that shows relatively recent films . Every weekend , you can still catch_a_glimpse of the island ' s other face during the Saturday market in downtown Ganges . Salt Spring used to be called the &quot; hippie island &quot; but now the alternative lifestyle crowd has become specialist . Crafts of every description are displayed next to fresh-squeezed-orange-juice stands , jars of sugarless pure-fruit jams , herb plants for_sale , hair-beading street salons and so on . Salt Spring has 400 miles of roads , mountain_peaks reaching 2 # 310 feet , streams and lakes filled with cutthroat and bass . If you drive to the top of Mt . Maxwell Provincial Park , mid-island on the west_side , there ' s an outlook that takes_in rolling valley farmland stretching for miles and a lump-in-the-throat sweep of most of the other islands . It also has one of the Pacific Northwest ' s most famous small inns , Hastings House , a Relais &amp; Chateaux accommodation near Ganges ; excellent restaurants ; top quality B &amp; B ' s and the highest-priced real_estate in the area . Classy Hastings House is the island ' s best-known inn ( and with rates starting at $ 220 , by far the most expensive on any of the islands ) . Once the family home of British immigrants , the house is a replica of a 14th-Century Sussex country home with log beams , bedrooms with cozy comforters , stone fireplaces and mullioned windows overlooking the bay and rolling gardens . The last time I visited , the aroma of garlic and rosemary floated out of the kitchen , a teasing precursor of the Salt Spring lamb on that night ' s menu . ( Prix fixe meals are about $ 40 without wine. ) Salt Spring has more_than 100 B &amp; B ' s , some very basic , others done to a world-class standard . One of the latter is the lovingly restored Old Farm House , in the northern part of the island , run_by Karl and Gertie Fuss with rooms that start at $ 125 . I had dinner ( a delicate prawn salad ) with Gertie last year . For breakfast I tried one of her specialties : poached egg_on polenta with fresh sorrel and bearnaise sauce . The Farm House ' s rooms have old_country charm , but with fine hotel service such_as the steaming coffee on a silver tray that waited outside our room every morning so that we could lounge in handmade robes before dressing for breakfast . The Penders North and South Pender were originally one island until a canal was cut_through its isthmus , saving boats and canoes a lot of rowing miles . They ' re now joined by a one-lane wooden bridge . The Penders are second in size to Salt Spring and lie closest to the U.S. border . For the population of 1 # 800 , island life is still pretty rural ; there are no villages . After a 30-minute ferry ride from Salt Spring to Otter Bay on North Pender one early morning , I drove over to what had looked_on the map to be a village to find breakfast . &quot; Port Washington &quot; turned_out to be one 1903 general_store and a marina , both closed . The nearest thing to a village on Pender turned_out to be the Driftwood Centre , which consisted_of a bank , post boxes , bakery , coin-operated laundry , hair salon , general_store and a cafe . I finally found Diane Dryer at the Inn on Pender , who unlike everyone else on the island , seemed to be awake at 7:30 a.m. She runs her clean , motel-style inn , and the Memories restaurant ( one of the three places on the Penders to eat ) , plus manages to keep tabs on everything happening on the island . ( She was one of two people who told me Goldie Hawn had a place on North Pender. ) As I left , a delicate blacktailed deer standing a_few feet from the restaurant door was unperturbed by us humans . Anyone whose childhood years were forever changed by Bambi will be ecstatic in the Gulf Islands . Deer are everywhere . The best vista on Pender is from Mt . Norman , which has trails to its 858-foot summit and views all_over the San Juans . The Penders main claim to fame are their many bays and beaches , which are accessible by public rights_of_way . The beaches are gravelly and secluded , great for quiet picnics and ideal for easy boat launching . It was_on Pender Island that the specter of overdevelopment in the Gulf Islands first appeared . In the late 1960 ' s , a Vancouver businessman subdivided an area around Pender ' s Magic Lake for a mainland-style housing . The bitter controversy that followed quickly spread to the other Gulf Islands . In their zeal to preserve the pristine nature of the islands , residents set_up the Islands Trust , a body empowered to &quot; preserve and protect &quot; the islands through zoning bylaws . It has proved highly effective . The Penders have a full-scale resort , Bedwell Harbour , a number of lodges and inns and some charming B &amp; Bs . I particularly liked Eatenton B &amp; B , just off Scarff Road , with its huge sun_deck that looks over the entire bay , and Cliffside-Inn-on-the-Sea , which was the first B &amp; B on the island and has the reputation for being as efficient as a Swiss watch . Galiano Ask anyone what the defining personality of Galiano is and you get almost 100 % agreement : It ' s the home of the environmental activist . If there ' s a protest going_on somewhere in B.C. , you can be darn sure some of the picketers are Galianoites . Long-time resident Tom Hennessy and his wife , Ann , are typical of the kind of islanders who came vowing to escape the rat_race -- and then found themselves busier than they ever were at_home . Tom , a former gallery- and museum-designer in Washington , D.C. , came_upon Galiano during a vacation and never went_home . Their large property_right on Montague Harbour is home to Sutil Lodge , a B &amp; B with 1930 ' s fishing lodge decor , plus umpteen dozen other enterprises they now run -- including a majestic 46-foot catamaran that takes people on four-hour picnic cruises to one of the best swimming beaches in the Gulf Islands . Club-shaped Galiano is 15 miles long and one mile wide , reaches further north than the other islands and has 900 residents . Although there ' s no real village , there are more_than 20 B &amp; B ' s , several inns and lodges and the elegant Woodstone Country Inn , which is situated inland and features rooms with wood-burning fireplaces . I stumbled on a sheer gem of a place to stay_on my last visit -- Lion ' s Gate Guest House , a private home with only one bedroom . The house is about as &quot; B.C. &quot; as they come -- a log house at the end of a garden-lined drive with a huge open living_room and kitchen . The guest room ( with its own bathroom ) felt_like a little log_cabin and at night I sank into the most comfortable bed in the Western world . Owners Debbie and John Stewart are great conversationalists and even after I ' d polished_off a mean herb omelet , it was hard ripping myself away . Mayne Mayne is the smallest of the Gulf Islands ( 8.4 square_miles ) but it has a whopping population of 835 , due partly to its position closest to Vancouver , but also to its great community spirit . There ' s a good selection of charming B &amp; B ' s , one of the most elegant inns anywhere in B.C. , Oceanwood , and several good restaurants such_as Perry ' s Place , where we sampled a huge feed of freshly caught prawns ( for about $ 8.50 ) that I still dream about . On weekends , Perry ' s has jazz concerts over dinner as well as a beer garden out back . ( For anyone who has cooking facilities , fresh prawns can be bought_off a fishing_boat on the government dock at Horton Bay on weekends from 4 to 6 p.m. ) Miner ' s Bay is the heart of Mayne , with craft shops , general_stores and the popular Springwater Lodge pub . The pub has_the_best fish and chips on the islands ( $ 4.94 ) and despite my now-elevated cholesterol count , I suggest you not miss it . The ling cod was done just right , covered with a crispy light , thin batter shell . A cozy B &amp; B in Miner ' s Bay , the Root Seller , has down-home rooms , a hostess who invites guests to &quot; just help yourself &quot; and , the two nights I stayed there , interesting fellow guests . ( I shared digs with a group of physiotherapists and doctors from South_Africa and a teaching psychiatrist from Colorado. ) The top-of-the-line inn is Oceanwood , run_by Marilyn and Jonathon Chilvers with the grace and style of a fine English country hotel . Their dining_room is unquestionably the best on Mayne ( and probably in the islands ) , thanks to their dynamic young chef Chris Johnson . Oceanwood is known also for its extensive wine_cellar of internationally praised B.C. wines . Menus change daily and a four-course meal will cost about $ 25 per person . The place is packed with sybaritic treats : You can sit in the Jacuzzi with a glass of that B.C. wine and watch the boats come_by , or take a pre-dinner stroll in the herb_garden , or sit_by your own fireplace sipping more of that wine before slipping into your whirlpool bath . Among other things to do , Active Pass Lighthouse on a peninsula southwest of Miner ' s Bay is a good photo op and picnic spot , and there ' s a two-hour walk from Miner ' s Bay to Helen Point . Mayne seems to have fewer hills than the other islands , so cycling is a big pastime , and there are numerous places to rent bikes . Kayaks can be rented from Mayne Island Kayak &amp; Canoe Rentals in Miners Bay . Saturna The minute the ferry docks at Lyall Harbour , you know this is an island not like the others . Soaring cedar and fir_trees descend right down to the water , compelling you to explore along the island ' s only major road . East Point Road winds along the 10-mile-long coast through tunnels of red arbutus beside a &quot; beach &quot; of unbroken sandstone that looks over the Strait of Georgia and Tumbo Island to the northeast . There were moments when I felt I was touching the last pristine beach in North_America . Only rarely was there a piece of cleared property or a house . It was love at first sight . Even though Saturna is the largest of the &quot; outer islands &quot; ( all are &quot; outer , &quot; except Salt Spring ) , it has the least development and the smallest population ( only 280 full-time residents ) . There are no villages , no coin-laundries , no garbage_pickup or dump , no tourist shops selling &quot; Welcome to Saturna &quot; banners . There is , however , a good lodge , several fine B &amp; B ' s , bike rental , a superb bakery , a pub , marina , two general_stores and an Avon lady . Among the reasons why the island has not been densely settled -- despite , in my opinion , being the most beautiful of the lot -- is a chronic shortage of water in some places . Among some of the long-timers are the residents of the Breezy Bay community on the island ' s southwest side , who run the Breezy Bay Bed &amp; Breakfast . Betty Spears , who has lived_on Saturna for 15 years , runs the &quot; more_than 100-year-old &quot; house and whips_up farm-style breakfasts of eggs , pancakes , granola and Haggis Farm bread on the wood stove in the kitchen . Everything is period : the wrought iron beds , Amos ' n Andy radio , overstuffed sofas and tongue-and-groove walls . The atmosphere is warm and friendly and guests have the run of the house . One absolute must : the Haggis Farm Bakery , which I heard about on several of the other islands . Owners Jon Guy and Priscilla Ewbank started the bakery eight years ago when they were overwhelmed by demand for the sourdough_bread they baked each Sunday in their home kitchen . They now have a proper bakery mid-island on Narvaez Road . Coming_over on the ferry to Saturna , a young_man pointed to the top of Mt . Warburton Pike , the highest point on the island , and told me not to miss it . &quot; If you ' re lucky , you ' ll see some of the brown or honey-colored feral goats with their twisty horns . There ' s a grassy plateau and from there you can see all_of the islands and as far as Mt . Baker . It ' s the most beautiful spot on earth. &quot; He was right . GUIDEBOOK : The ABC ' s of B.C.
