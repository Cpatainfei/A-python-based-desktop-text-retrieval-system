   <HEADLINE> NATIONAL AGENDA ; GROWING IT--AND GOING NOWHERE ; RUSSIAN FARMERS ' ROAD TO MARKET RUNS AFOUL OF CHAOTIC DISTRIBUTION AND ORGANIZED CRIMINALS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So fertile is the black earth in Russia ' s southern breadbasket that farmers say if you plant a shovel , the handle will sprout leaves . On the Shtukanev family farm , this makes_for a lavish spread come dinner time : fresh chicken , potatoes , rice , bread , butter , spring dill , parsley and basil leaves , pickled tomatoes , eggplant , and , from the livestock , pure white sala , a thick hunk of salted_pork fat that is considered a special delicacy here . Every morsel--even the bottle of vodka brewed from local durham wheat--is grown by the familyon their 36-acre farm . With a tractor , a harvester , few debts and higher yields than the collective_farm he declared independence from two years ago , Vladimir G . Shtukanev , 34 , is the very model of the entrepreneurial private farmer that Russian reformers envisioned . But Shtukanev has one big problem : He has no buyer for the harvest bursting from his fields . The Soviet state distribution system is moribund , and Russia has yet to replace it with a free market to transport , wholesale and retail food . Part of the problem is the endemic chaos that has plagued Russia ' s transition to a rational economic_system , a situation further aggravated by runaway inflation . But equally to blame is the so-called Russian mafia , which has fixed food prices in the big cities and , with threats and violence , prevents farmers from selling their produce cheaper . &quot; Grave obstacles have appeared in getting food to the consumer , &quot; said Deputy Agriculture Minister Anatoly S . Kopylov in a recent interview . &quot; One of the characteristics of this disorganized and chaotic market is its criminal nature. &quot; The Agriculture Ministry is so concerned that it is setting_up 800 regional wholesale food markets to link buyers and sellers in a &quot; civilized &quot; way , Kopylov said . As Russia lurches toward a free-market economy , nowhere have the changes been more jolting--and more bewildering--than down on the farm , where the fields are bountiful but the marketing is a nightmare . On paper , at least , the transformation from the Communist command system looks sweeping . Russia now has 277 # 000 privately owned farms that are home to 1.5 million people and span 29 million acres of land . More_than 90 % of the vast and notoriously inefficient collective_farms have been turned_into joint-stock_companies in which workers have ownership and voting_rights . Here in Krasnodar , more_than 15 % of these new agro-businesses have already voted to fire the old Communist_Party bosses who once carried_out Moscow ' s commands , said Gennady G . Koltsev , the region ' s deputy administrator . &quot; If the director loses the trust of his members , no local officials can save him , &quot; Koltsev said . As the economic crunch deepens , some farms have ousted two directors in three months , he said . Still , the 60-year legacy of collectivization cannot be dissolved by decree . Gone is what leading Russian land reformer Yuri D . Chernichenko calls the &quot; agro-gulag , &quot; a system that kept collective_farm workers from leaving their farms without permission and doomed them to decades of substandard housing , health and education . But a host of complex , interrelated economic , organizational and psychological changes are needed before rural Russians can take_advantage of their theoretical new freedoms : * First , the 213 % annual interest_rate makes_it impossible for most would-be private farmers to buy the equipment , fertilizer and seed needed to get started . Many who have borrowed money have simply gone broke . In 1993 , 15 # 000 private farms went bankrupt , and the failure rate is accelerating , according to the Assn . of Russian Peasant Farms and Agricultural Cooperatives , or AKKOR . In Krasnodar , a number of former collective_farms are also insolvent , but so far local authorities--fearful that bankruptcy would mean unemployment for hundreds , if not thousands , ofworkers--have managed to bail them out . * Second , the decision to free energy prices has created a severe oil shock in the farm belt . As once-subsidized energy prices approach world levels , farmers suddenly can no longer afford to fuel their diesel-guzzling tractors , sowers and harvesters . Nor can they afford to purchase the cheap , petroleum-based fertilizers , herbicides and pesticides that they once lavished on their land . By early March , farms had only a third of the required fertilizer and half the pesticides needed to defend this year ' s crop , according to government statistics . Environmentalists say this reduced use of chemicals is a blessing in disguise . But a meager harvest is nonetheless predicted . * Third , prices for farm commodities are rising far more slowly than prices for industrial goods , a process that is fast eroding farmers ' purchasing power . &quot; Fuel prices are rising , but our prices are not , &quot; complained private farmer Vladimir O . Melnik , who along with 22 others formed a marketing cooperative in the Krymsk region of western Krasnodar . A liter of diesel_fuel costs 10 times what it did last year , Melnik said , but the price of a pound of potatoes has not even doubled . In 1992 , a Krasnodar farmer could earn enough from selling 30 tons of tomatoes to buy two tractors , he said ; today , those tomatoes would cover only half the price of one tractor . But what farmers complain of most bitterly is the lack of a safe , predictable market for their food . &quot; It really is scary , but despite the fact that the markets are empty , it ' s still impossible to sell your produce &quot; in Moscow , St . Petersburg and other large Russian cities , said Tatyana V . Vasilyeva , president of the local Krasnodar branch of AKKOR , which represents 16 # 680 private farmers . Highway robbers , traffic police who demand payola in exchange for free passage and payoffs to local gangsters make a mockery of a free market , she explained . * Vasilyeva told of farmers who drove a truck full of top-quality smoked ham to Moscow and tried to sell it for about $ 1.10 a pound--less than half the going rate in the capital . Shops would only take the ham on consignment , with the money to be paid weeks or months later--once inflation has eroded its value . &quot; At the market , our farmers nearly got killed . The mafia would not allow them to sell it there , &quot; Vasilyeva said , using the term mafia to mean anything from petty extortionists who rough_up street merchants to the professional criminals known to enforce their demands with heavy firepower . In desperation , the farmers drove their truck to the AKKOR headquarters in Moscow to ask_for help--and sold their ham on the spot . &quot; This ham was literally snapped_up in a_couple_of minutes , &quot; Vasilyeva said . &quot; People were buying as much as they could carry , because the price was ridiculously low . Still , none of the stores would take it. &quot; Melnik , the Krasnodar farmer , said his cooperative sent a truck of tomatoes to Moscow , but the farmers were stopped at the outskirts of the city , where racketeers together with corrupt traffic police insisted that the contents of the truck be handed_over at rock-bottom prices . * &quot; If you do get_through , they tell you what price you can sell for , and no lower , &quot; Melnik said . The complaints of beatings , threats and price-fixing have been repeated by farmers from Siberia to central Russia . So was Melnik ' s conclusion : &quot; It ' s just not worth going_to Moscow. &quot; Russian Interior Minister Viktor F . Yerin said such problems are exaggerated . At a news_conference this month , Yerin said police have cracked_down on highway banditry , arresting about a dozen gangs of truck hijackers in recent months . But the minister also complained of the farmers ' own passivity . Police have offered to organize protected truck convoys but have not had any takers , he said . Certainly , the residents of Krasnodar have little faith in their government . Last fall , the quasi-official state grain agency collected the autumn harvest from farmers--but did not pay some of them until April . By the time farmers and collectives got the money , inflation had reduced it to a joke . And many were left without the means to buy seeds and fuel . The pro-Communist Agrarian Union and its allies immediately began predicting a disastrous harvest unless the government stopped slashing subsidies to agriculture . After a fierce lobbying campaign , Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin released about $ 2.6 billion to help get the spring crop planted . Come autumn , however , farmers will be anxious to find a grain buyer more reliable than the state . &quot; Some growers may be scared_off , &quot; said Deputy Agriculture Minister Kopylov . &quot; That is why we are in a hurry to create a new and independent system &quot; of regional wholesale markets , grain exchanges and even a futures market that will help create a more predictable market for grain . In the meantime , private farmers and privatized collectives are quite literally living_off their land . Barter is now more common than cash transactions . Farmers say they have swapped their produce for everything from TV_sets to fuel . Farmers speak with nostalgia of how much easier life was 10 years ago . While few say they would return to the unfulfilled promise of utopia under the Soviet system , nearly everyone is dismayed by the chaos that surrounds them . When the Path to Communism collective_farm was turned_into a joint-stock_company last year , its 2 # 500 workers quickly renamed it &quot; Niva , &quot; meaning field . &quot; That ( communism ) was a society that couldn ' t exist , but we were supposedly heading for it , &quot; said Vladimir A . Maluga , 36 , who said he no longer believes_in utopia . But today , the farm that was once considered the best collective in Krasnodar is $ 13 # 000 in the red . Niva now earns cash by selling Turkish_delight , a sunflower_seed and sugar confection , in the local market . The farm has also swapped the sweet stuff for a load of construction materials and bartered its fruit for diesel_fuel . Earlier this year , farm_workers , who had not been paid_for months , were talking_of taking their shares_in Niva and splitting off as a private farm , Maluga said . Suddenly , the farm directors doubled their salaries , and their pay began to come regularly , he said . But workers too are being held accountable for the results of their labor . When 12 calves died this winter , Niva ' s director fined Maluga and three other supervisors almost twice their monthly salaries for having failed to quarantine the sick animals before the epidemic spread . Five of Maluga ' s workers were sacked for showing_up late , drunk or not at all . * Despite the harsh measures , Maluga said he would vote to keep Niva ' s director in office . &quot; He ' s a little cruel . . . but he ' s an honest man , &quot; the farmer said . He paused , then added approvingly : &quot; And he knows how to count. &quot; Meanwhile , the Niva company is learning what not to plant . For decades , central planners in Moscow ordered the collective to grow hemp--but the free-market price turned_out to be too low to make the crop worthwhile . This year , Niva is planting soybeans for cattle feed . And the farm is abandoning the old Soviet practice of fattening cattle on once-subsidized but now-expensive grain . With the Russian grain market so unstable , farmer Shtukanev has planted half his land with sunflowers . If the local plant that produces sunflower_oil buys his seeds at a decent price , Shtukanev believes that he can pay_off his debts this year . &quot; Growing it is a lot easier than selling it , &quot; Shtukanev said . &quot; You have to figure_out how you ' re going to sell your crops before you plant them . that ' s the hardest part. &quot; A Bite Out of the Breadbasket Food prices are skyrocketing in Russia , but farmers aren ' t reaping the wealth . Middlemen skim_off the profits while consumers and farmers suffer . Average Russian monthly salary , as of April : $ 94.59 ( 175 # 000 rubles ) Current prices and percent increase since June , 1993 ( in U.S. dollars ) : Beet_sugar ( 1 lb. ) : 0.14 / 353 % Bread ( loaf of white ) : $ 0.26 / 746 % Eggs ( per dozen ) : 0.93 / 684 % Flour ( 1 lb ) : 0.11 / 687 % Vodka ( Russian , 1 / 2 liter ) : 1.31 / 284 % Sources : Russian State Statistics Committee , Moscow food markets Sticker Shock at the Market What if Americans had to pay as much for food as Russians , in relative terms ? Bread would be about $ 5.25 a loaf and butter $ 17 a pound , based on a sample Russian weekly salary of $ 22 and a U.S. weekly salary of $ 445 .
