   <HEADLINE> MTA SHAKE-UP PLAN ' S LIMITED SCOPE CRITICIZED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A proposed reorganization of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ' s management of Los Angeles subway construction calls_for a handful of structural changes -- but two key state legislators said Thursday that the plan falls_short_of what is needed . Prepared by MTA Chief_Executive_Officer Franklin E . White and aides , the plan calls_for management and engineering changes aimed at preventing a repeat of problems that have plagued the multibillion-dollar project . White ' s plan does not seek to terminate the contract of Shea-Kiewit-Kenny , the builder of the troubled subway tunnels in Hollywood , or MTA-hired consulting_firms . &quot; The most important concern is to get this job done properly and quickly and not act_out of anger , &quot; White said in an interview . Replacing the contractors , he said , would add &quot; substantially &quot; to the cost of completing the work , because it could further delay work_on subway_stations along the route . The proposal was sent confidentially this week to the Federal Transit Administration , which on Oct . 5 cut_off $ 1.6 billion of future subway funding because of dissatisfaction with the MTA ' s management of construction . The federal agency also has ordered that tunneling remain shut_down along Hollywood Boulevard , pending its approval of the construction procedures to be used . &quot; We remain optimistic that all outstanding issues can be resolved before the end of the month , &quot; White said in a memo received Thursday by MTA board_members . In a related development , the MTA announced late Thursday that Joel J . Sandberg , the agency ' s project manager for all subway construction in the Wilshire district and in Hollywood , is being reassigned to the position of deputy project manager for systems and construction service . Two state legislators , both of whom have jurisdiction over transportation spending , said White ' s reorganization proposal lacks the sweep needed to better manage construction and to protect the public interest . &quot; The FTA did the right thing in cutting_off the funding , &quot; said Assembly Transportation Committee Chairman Richard Katz , whose legislation created the MTA in 1993 . &quot; They ought to be demanding a whole_lot more ( than what White ' s plan proposes ) . There ' s not much change there , really. &quot; * Katz has urged the state Transportation Commission to withhold its funding for the Los Angeles subway until the MTA demonstrates it can competently manage the project . The state has provided about $ 250 million . Katz noted on Thursday that White ' s proposal makes no mention of whether he still intends to dissolve the Rail Construction Corp. , an MTA subsidiary that has overseen subway construction since mid-1990 . Katz will hold a hearing on the subway problems Monday in Los Angeles . Another legislator who has expressed concern about the MTA ' s operations , Sen . Tom Hayden ( D-Santa Monica ) , said White ' s reorganization plan lacked the substance that he believes is needed to gain control over what is the most expensive subway construction , per mile , in U.S. history . &quot; The restructuring appears to be a reshuffling , &quot; said Hayden , who is organizing a Senate Transportation Committee hearing on Nov . 2 regarding the funding and construction of the subway and other MTA policy issues . &quot; It ' s inadequate. &quot; At the request of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan , the MTA board has twice postponed votes on White ' s earlier request to disband the subsidiary , which has drawn criticism from some officials for being too lenient with contractors . White , in addition to seeking restoration of federal funding , asked Federal Transit Administrator Gordon J . Linton for approval to resume tunneling along Hollywood Boulevard . White has said that he thinks tunneling may resume as early as Nov . 7 . Excavation in Hollywood has been halted since Aug . 18 , when surface sinkages of nine inches were confirmed . A spokesman for the Federal Transit Administration would not speculate Thursday as_to when the agency would permit tunneling to resume . The spokesman , Pete Halpin , said federal_officials have raised &quot; some questions that aren ' t addressed by the report &quot; submitted by White . &quot; In the view of our technical folks , they ' re looking_for some more information , &quot; Halpin said from Washington . In Los Angeles , MTA officials met Thursday with staff of the federal agency to review proposed procedures for resumed tunneling . The procedures were prepared by the MTA ' s inspection-management firm , Parsons-Dillingham . The engineers recommended that metal struts -- not wooden wedges -- be used for tunnel bracing . Substitution of the wedges was approved in 1992 by Parsons-Dillingham and by the project ' s chief design engineer , employed by the firm of Parsons Brinckerhoff . The wedges were crushed under Hollywood Boulevard and engineers have concluded that the failure contributed to the surface sinkages . The MTA plan also called_for three types of soil-stabilizing grouting procedures . The grouting was not performed in the worst-affected area of tunneling . * Federal Transit Administration and MTA documents obtained by The Times shed further light on the management and construction problems : * The federal_government ' s consultant for subway work in Los Angeles said in an Oct . 13 report that the MTA &quot; relented to the contractor ' s demands &quot; by reinstating Shea-Kiewit-Kenny ' s tunneling superintendent , who had been expelled for safety-related reasons . The federal consultant , Hill International Inc. , questioned the reinstatement of Norm Hutchins and criticized the MTA . &quot; The ( MTA ) needs to be more forceful with_regard_to making ( Shea-Kiewit-Kenny ) reinforce its commitment to safety , &quot; said Hill International . White said in an interview that Hutchins ' role would be reassessed . * Shea-Kiewit-Kenny has agreed to appoint E . O . Mixon as new project manager for the work . He declined to comment Thursday . * According to the reorganization proposal , Shea-Kiewit-Kenny &quot; has agreed to submit a plan for resolving all &quot; problems with installation of wooden wedges used in 12 miles of twin tunnels along Hollywood Boulevard and Vermont Avenue . Hayden said the federal_government should not agree to allow a resumption of tunneling or to unfreeze funding until the MTA approves Shea-Kiewit-Kenny ' s plan . &quot; The incremental improvements should be implemented , and then the money should be turned_on , &quot; Hayden said .</TEXT>
