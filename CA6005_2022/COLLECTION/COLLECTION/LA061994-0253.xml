   <TEXT> THERE ' S NOTHING IN the world like it . By the time it ' s over , it will have touched the hearts of one-third of the planet ' s population . Two billion people . One event : the World Cup soccer championship . Every four years , one country transforms itself into the soccer capital of the planet . This summer , the United States is host , and the worldwide television audience is expected to reach more_than an aggregate 30 billion during the monthlong event . From a field of 24 teams playing in nine stadiums across the nation , two will meet in the final match at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena on July 17 . For many Angelenos , this , the globe ' s largest single-sport event , remains a curious sideshow meriting less attention than David Letterman coming_to town to boost his sweeps-week ratings . But not so for thousands in Central Los Angeles , where many communities have high concentrations of immigrants who have brought their deep love of the sport from their native_lands . A microcosm of the frenzy that has swept the world , neighborhoods such_as South-Central , Pico-Union , East Los Angeles and Koreatown are rife_with nationalistic pride and American commercialism . Vendors sell flags and pennants of the United States , Mexico , Brazil , Nigeria and others in the Cup field to soccer fans eager to pledge their allegiance . Shouts and cheers spill from restaurants and bars where the games play_on television . Typical is the Little Siberia bar in Huntington Park , where walls plastered with Cup posters and photos act_as a backdrop to standing-room-only crowds intensely watching a futbol match . For soccer followers here and from abroad , the spectacle transcends everything . Children around the globe dream of becoming soccer heroes like Colombia ' s Carlos Valderrama or Brazil ' s Romario in the same tradition American youths aspire to become the next Joe Montana or Michael Jordan . World Cuppers live to see the clash of divergent styles of soccer : the artistry of the Brazilians ; the precision of the Germans ; the elegance of the Italians or the pageantry of the Colombians . Cameroonians , meanwhile , roar for their &quot; Indomitable Lions. &quot; Spaniards cheer their toreros with &quot; Ole ! &quot; Dutch fans count_on the clockwork of their orange team . The Super Bowl , the World_Series and the NBA finals : Combine the passion and glory of these events and it ' s only a glimpse of what the finals are for the most popular sport in the world . There is nothing like the World Cup . Not one thing . * OFF-THE-FIELD MANIA : World Cup-related events . Page 14</TEXT>
