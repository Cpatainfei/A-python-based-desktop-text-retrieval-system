   <HEADLINE> CONDO Q &amp; A : NEW LAW AFFECTS HOW ASSOCIATIONS SETTLE DISPUTES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> QUESTION : My friend owns a home_in a planned development in Santa Clarita . Her homeowners ' association sent a letter to all owners about a new law that requires alternative dispute resolution . The letter said that all associations are supposed to inform their homeowners of the new law . I own a condominium unit in Sherman Oaks . I have not received any notification from my association yet . Is my association in violation of the law ? Please explain alternative dispute resolution . In what situations must the association use it ? ANSWER : The new law went_into effect Jan . 1 . It amends California Civil Code , Section 1354 , which explains that an association ' s declaration may be enforced by any owner , or the association , or both . Your association should send notification to all members . The law states that all community associations are required to send a summary of the law to all owners annually . The summary can be included in a newsletter or other written communication , or it can be mailed along with the pro_forma budget information that is sent_out prior to the beginning of the association ' s fiscal_year . ( For a summary of the law , see story , K6. ) Alternative dispute resolution ( ADR ) is the term for several conflict settlement processes that can be used before or instead of going_to court . The new law requires that the two parties in a disagreement try to resolve the conflict through mediation or arbitration prior to commencing a lawsuit . The law specifies that ADR is not necessary when an association is attempting to collect delinquent assessments from an owner . In addition , there are other situations that may_not require ADR before obtaining an injunction or other forms of legal_action . For instance , if an owner is in the process of violating an architectural restriction by building a pool without permission , the association is allowed to take legal_action to immediately halt the construction . &quot; The new law applies only to two types of disputes regarding the association ' s governing documents , which include the declaration of covenants , conditions and restrictions ( CC &amp; Rs ) , bylaws , articles of incorporation , and rules and regulations , &quot; said attorney Herbert Strickstein , a Century City lawyer with more_than 30 years of experience in community association law . &quot; The first type of case is ' declaratory relief. ' In this type of case , a party is asking the court to declare or interpret the parties ' rights and obligations under one or more of the governing documents . For example , an owner may want to ask the court who has the responsibility for maintaining a balcony , patio , windows or doors . &quot; The second type of case is ' injunctive relief. ' For instance , a party ( the association ) is asking the court to order the other party ( a homeowner ) to do something , or to stop doing something . Examples would be an order that a homeowner stop parking in guest parking_spaces , or an order that the association fix a leaking roof . &quot; Either type of case may also include a claim for money damages as long as it does not exceed $ 5 # 000 . The new law does not apply to cases that seek only money damages. &quot; The ADR procedure begins when one of the parties in the dispute gives the other party a &quot; Request for Resolution &quot; form . By signing the form , the parties agree to submit the dispute to mediation or arbitration . James P . Lingl , a Camarillo attorney who is_active in community association legislation and the representation of community association clients , said the &quot; Request for Resolution &quot; must include a brief description of the dispute , a request for mediation or arbitration and a notice that the party receiving the request form has 30 days to respond to the request , or the request is deemed to be rejected . &quot; The request for resolution is to be served in the same way that a small claims action is to be served , &quot; Lingl said . &quot; If both parties to the dispute agree to use ADR , it should be completed within 90 days , unless both parties agree in writing to conclude the ADR at a later date . The costs of the ADR will be divided between the parties. &quot; Strickstein said that refusing arbitration or mediation does carry a risk . If the court awards attorneys ' fees and costs , it may consider a party ' s refusal to arbitrate or mediate when deciding the amounts to be awarded . A party might be required to pay more attorney ' s fees if that party does not agree to arbitration or mediation . Mediation and arbitration are two distinctly different procedures . The two parties involved in a dispute might be inclined to choose arbitration rather than mediation depending_upon the nature of the conflict . What is arbitration ? When arbitration is used , the two parties present their testimony to an arbitrator , a third_party who hears both sides of the argument and then renders a judgment . Arbitration can be binding or non-binding . What is mediation ? Mediation uses a mediator , a third_party , who listens to both sides and encourages open discussion between the parties about the reasons for the conflict . The mediator ensures the active participation of both parties by facilitating the communication , thereby assisting the two parties in exploring various ways to resolve the problem . The two parties then agree to a solution that they have helped to shape . In community associations , the two parties involved in the conflict are often neighbors who will continue to live_in the association after the conflict is resolved . Therefore , all parties should be interested in preserving a friendly atmosphere by using a constructive approach to resolve problems . Having served as a mediator on many occasions , I am convinced that mediation promotes the healing of bruised egos and combative attitudes of the two parties . After using mediation , the association is then better equipped to handle future problems . ADR can save the association member ' s time , energy and money by resolving problems quickly and efficiently without going_to court . The new requirement to attempt to mediate or arbitrate will have a positive impact on the workload of the court system . In addition , effective conflict resolution promotes a cooperative attitude among all_of the owners . Litigation , on the other hand , is often expensive , creates dissension among the owners , and takes a great_deal of time and energy that could be used in more constructive ways . Litigation is often stressful to the participants and , in some cases , interferes with the owner ' s ability to sell or the buyer ' s ability to obtain a mortgage loan . Who is responsible_for finding a mediator or arbitrator ? The person or persons who initiate the request for resolution form are usually the ones who find the mediator or arbitrator and engage the services on behalf of both parties . Since both parties share the cost , either party can suggest a mediator or arbitrator . Where does one find a mediation or arbitration service ? There are several services , such_as HomeOwners Arbitration and Mediation Services ( HOAMS ) , that specialize in community association dispute resolution . HOAMS was formed as a joint enterprise of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services ( JAMS ) , and Kate M . Rinaldi &amp; Associates , a law and mediation firm . HOAMS was formed specifically in response to the new requirements of Civil Code 1354 . &quot; We contact all_of the parties and coordinate the time and place for the hearing , &quot; said attorney Kate Rinaldi , president of HOAMS . &quot; Our mediators are seasoned professionals who have years of mediation experience as well as specialized training in homeowner association matters. &quot; HOAMS can be reached by calling ( 800 ) ADR-1354 . Lingl said , &quot; In addition to the ADR services that have personnel trained in community association disputes , each county has a low cost / no cost ADR service that is partially funded by court filing fees , such_as Dispute Resolution Services in Los Angeles. &quot; Lingl has trained some of their mediators to provide them with information about the large body of law that governs community associations . Dispute Resolution Services can be reached at ( 213 ) 896-6526 . Callers will be referred to one of several branch offices in Pasadena , South Bay , Lakewood , Santa Monica or East Los Angeles . Another way to find mediators is to call the Southern California Mediation Assn . at ( 213 ) 896-6540 . The association maintains a referral service . Callers can request a mediator with specific experience and training . Dispute Workshop Attorney Kate Rinaldi , president of HomeOwners Arbitration and Mediation Services ( HOAMS ) , will conduct a workshop on alternative dispute resolution for community association managers from 8:15 a.m. to noon June 17 at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Irvine . Managers will learn how to help their association boards of directors comply with the law . The workshop is being presented by the California Assn . of Community Managers ( CACM ) . Managers can call CACM at ( 714 ) 476-4542 for more information . Here ' s the Law : Clip ' n ' Save Rich Neuland , an attorney with Hickey &amp; Neuland , an Orange County law_firm specializing in community association law since 1970 , has prepared the following summary of the law , which can be used for distribution to association members . Associations must distribute a summary to their members each year . Summary of Civil Code Section 1354 Effective Jan . 1 , 1994 , the California Civil Code , Section 1354 , was amended to enact &quot; Alternative Dispute Resolution &quot; ( ADR ) procedures . The law requires that before a common interest development ( homeowners association ) or an individual homeowner files a lawsuit against the other , solely for declaratory relief or injunctive relief in connection with a claim for money , under $ 5 # 000 ( other_than association assessments ) or for enforcing the association ' s governing documents , the filing party &quot; shall endeavor &quot; to submit the dispute to alternative dispute resolution . Forms of ADR include mediation , negotiation and arbitration and may be binding or non-binding . The ADR process is initiated by one party serving a &quot; Request for Resolution &quot; form upon the other party to the dispute . The form must include ( 1 ) a brief description of the dispute , ( 2 ) the request for ADR , ( 3 ) a notice that a response must be received within thirty ( 30 ) days or it will be deemed rejected , and ( 4 ) a copy of Civil Code Section 1354 . Service of the Request for Resolution should be by personal service or Small Claims Court procedures . If the individual receiving the request form agrees to ADR , the ADR process must be completed within ninety ( 90 ) days unless otherwise extended by the agreement . The cost of the ADR process is to be paid by the participating parties . At the time a civil suit is begun by the filing of a Complaint , the filing party must also submit to the Court a Certificate of Compliance indicating that they have complied with the requirements of Civil Code , Section 1354 , or stating any excuse for not doing so . If no Certificate is filed , it may be grounds for challenging the suit . Proper excuses include ( 1 ) a party refused ADR , ( 2 ) that fast injunctive relief is necessary , ( 3 ) the right to bring suit will expire within 120 days following the filing of the action , or ( 4 ) dismissal of the suit would harm the filing party . Civil Code , Section 1354 , also allows the Court to send a lawsuit to ADR upon agreement of the parties . The procedures and requirements of the law do not apply to the filing of cross-complaints . Failure by any member of the association to comply with the pre-filing requirements of Section 1354 may result in the loss of the rights to sue the association or another member of the association regarding enforcement of the governing documents . Although the winning party shall be awarded reasonable attorney ' s fees and costs , the Court may consider a party ' s refusal to participate in ADR prior to starting the suit . Unless the two parties agree to the disclosure , evidence made and documents prepared_for the ADR process are not admissible in a later civil action .</TEXT>
