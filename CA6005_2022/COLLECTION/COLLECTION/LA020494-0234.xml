   <HEADLINE> 2 SENATORS ASSAIL IMMIGRATION INITIATIVE ; CONGRESS : CRITICS SAY ADMINISTRATION PLAN FAILS TO STRENGTHEN BORDER_PATROL ENOUGH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Administration ' s two-year , $ 540.5-million program to cut_down illegal immigration while encouraging legal immigrants to become citizens drew sharp criticism Thursday from two senators with influence over the Justice_Department ' s purse_strings . The lawmakers said the effort falls_short_of Congress ' desire to build_up the Border_Patrol along the U.S.-Mexican boundary , indicating that the entire effort could have trouble getting_off_the_ground . But immigrant advocate groups -- usually quick to condemn border crackdowns -- generally offered qualified support of what the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund praised as a &quot; balanced approach &quot; mixing enforcement with a citizenship drive . Sens . Ernest F . Hollings ( D-S.C. ) , chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that controls Justice_Department funding , and Pete V . Domenici ( R-N.M. ) , ranking minority member of the panel , said that the initiative &quot; does not conform with congressional direction &quot; to hire 600 new Border_Patrol agents . The program , formally unveiled Thursday by Atty . Gen . Janet Reno and Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner , calls_for adding 620 Border_Patrol agents in the current fiscal_year , but only 350 would be new hires . The other 270 would be agents reassigned from support duties and administrative work . Nationwide , the Border_Patrol now has about 4 # 100 agents , one-quarter of them posted in the San Diego area , the busiest crossing point for illegal entrants . In a letter to Reno , Hollings and Domenici said they expect the Justice_Department to seek congressional approval before transferring_agents from administrative tasks back to the border . Administration officials want to replace the desk workers with less costly contract personnel . Sens . Jeff Bingaman ( D-N.M. ) , Dennis DeConcini ( D-Ariz. ) and John McCain ( R-Ariz. ) joined Hollings and Domenici in a separate letter asking Reno why all_of the $ 45 million already appropriated for hiring 600 new Border_Patrol agents is being spent in San Diego and El Paso . &quot; The citizens of Arizona and New Mexico are also entitled to assistance as Southwest border states that are constantly confronted with illegal immigration and drug trafficking , &quot; the five senators wrote . In announcing the program Thursday , Reno and Meissner said that its immediate focus is_on the San Diego and El Paso sections of the 2 # 000-mile border because those areas account_for 65 % of illegal immigrant apprehensions . Along with bolstered enforcement , officials announced a wide-ranging , $ 30-million plan to promote naturalization of foreign nationals residing in the United States legally . The plan includes extensive public education and streamlined procedures designed to persuade immigrants to become U.S. citizens . Immigrant advocates have long called_on the federal_government to bolster citizenship programs , which they say the INS has treated as a low priority . &quot; We want people to become citizens and participate in the democratic process , &quot; said Carlos Vaquerano , spokesman for the Central_American Resource Center , a Los Angeles assistance group . While supporting the citizenship initiative and the accompanying Border_Patrol buildup , the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund stressed the importance of improved training and supervision of agents and the creation of an oversight mechanism to curtail misconduct . In the proposal , authorities said they were revising training to emphasize ethics and civil_rights , strengthening internal disciplinary procedures and creating a citizens advisory panel . But some observers were skeptical of the plan . &quot; We ' re against militarizing the border any more , and that ' s what this plan does : militarize the border , &quot; said Roberto Martinez , border representative for the American Friends Service Committee . From another viewpoint , the Federation for American Immigration Reform criticized the Justice_Department blueprint for not doing enough to overhaul a flawed immigration system . Among other steps , the group seeks tougher measures to crack_down on illegal immigration and detect false claims of U.S. citizenship . Other elements of the two-year effort include : * Providing new technologies , such_as lighting five miles of border east of San Ysidro to help detect nighttime border crossers , and automating booking and fingerprinting procedures to identify those who have been arrested previously . * Expediting the deportations of immigrants imprisoned for crimes in California , Texas , New York , Florida and Illinois . The proposal calls_for deporting such criminals immediately after they complete their sentences . * Upgrading the asylum process by doubling the number of INS officers and immigration judges handling claims . Officials hope to be keeping_up with new asylum pleas by year ' s end and then attacking the backlog of 300 # 000 cases . * Stepping_up enforcement of sanctions against employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants by focusing_on industries and employers who have a history of violations .
