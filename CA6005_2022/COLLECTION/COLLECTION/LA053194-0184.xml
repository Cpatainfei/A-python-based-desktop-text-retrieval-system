   <TEXT> Winston Churchill ( 1874-1965 ) , British statesman and Prime_Minister in a speech delivered in Fulton , Missouri , March 5 , 1946 : &quot; From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an iron_curtain has descended across the Continent. &quot; * Konrad Adenauer ( 1876-1967 ) , West German Chancellor , in a speech delivered May , 1953 : &quot; We must free ourselves from thinking in terms of nation states...The countries of western Europe are no longer in a position to protect themselves individually ; not one of them is any longer in a position to salvage Europe ' s culture. &quot; * Charles de Gaulle ( 1890-1970 ) , French General and President of the Fifth Republic , from War Memoirs , Vol . III , of the Potsdam Conference in 1945 : &quot; ( In 1945 ) I intended to safeguard the primacy of France in western Europe by preventing the rise of a new Reich which might again threaten its safety ; to cooperate with East and West...to transform the_French Union into a free_association to avoid dangers of upheaval not yet perceived ; to persuade the states along the Rhine , the Alps and the Pyrenees to form a political , economic and strategic bloc ; and to establish this association as one of the three world_powers , acting if necessary as arbiter between the Soviet and Anglo-American camps . Since 1940 every word and every act of mine was dedicated to bringing_about this possibility. &quot; * Jean Monnet ( 1888-1979 ) , French politician and economist and former head of the European Community : &quot; New bonds between peoples and the realization of their mutual solidarity are already beginning to take_hold . As the Community ' s impact gradually increases , these bonds will be strengthened . Then it will become possible to find the way towards establishing a political union and reaching the Community ' s objectives : the United States of Europe. &quot; * Margaret Thatcher , former British Prime_Minister , in an interview in 1993 : &quot; What I am worried about is Europe becoming isolated...We ' ve piled such high costs onto our industry -- the prices are too high , we ' re non-competitive . We have our agriculture at enormously high subsidized rates . But the ( European ) Commission are protectionists . And some countries in Europe are protectionist...It ' s absolutely absurd . ( Francois ) Mitterrand has tried to have a rule to restrict American films to a percentage coming_into Europe . I said , &quot; What are you doing ? I thought France made_good films . What are you afraid of ? &quot; Sources : Quotations in History , Los Angeles Times</TEXT>
