   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; ANGST AT DISNEY ' S WORLD ; ALL HOLLYWOOD ' S EYES ARE_ON DISNEY STUDIOS CHAIRMAN JEFFREY KATZENBERG . HOW MUCH HAVE FRANK WELLS ' DEATH AND MICHAEL EISNER ' S HEART_SURGERY CHANGED HIS FUTURE ? TIME WILL TELL , BUT HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH EISNER IS THE REAL STORY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just three weeks ago , Disney Chairman Michael D . Eisner sat in his office atop corporate headquarters in Burbank and for the first time reluctantly discussed what has been_on the minds of all_of Hollywood -- the fate of his studio chairman , Jeffrey Katzenberg . Katzenberg ' s future in the ever-expanding entertainment empire had been the source of intense debate since April , when Frank G . Wells , Disney president and chief operating officer , died in a Nevada helicopter crash . While much of the industry assumed that Katzenberg would step into Wells ' job , based on his decade-long record of success , Eisner said in this candid two-hour interview that he had no intentions of sharing the Disney throne . Such speculation intensified after last Saturday ' s unexpected turn of events -- which found the 52-year-old Eisner undergoing emergency quadruple heart bypass surgery . While a Disney spokesman said on Wednesday that Eisner ' s position remains unchanged , it ' s widely assumed that he now will be forced by events to appoint a second-in-command to help carry the heavy load of running one of the industry ' s biggest entertainment companies . So the spotlight instantly returns to Katzenberg -- who is known to covet the crown as Prince of the Magic Kingdom . In his interview , Eisner said that there is no one in the industry he trusts more_than the 43-year-old studio chairman , whom he has mentored for the past 20 years since their days at Paramount Pictures . &quot; He is extremely trustworthy and loyal and very supportive of the whole company -- he is very much a team player , &quot; Eisner said of Katzenberg three weeks ago . But behind the harmonious facade of Team Disney , there exists a complex , tension-filled relationship between Eisner and Katzenberg that many see as a psychological barrier to change . His friends and colleagues say that despite Katzenberg ' s accomplishments , Eisner has never given his close associate the due he has always sought . Indeed , sources say the two have never even discussed the issue of Katzenberg ' s future in the post-Wells era . &quot; This is about a withholding father and a son looking_for love and recognition from that father , &quot; a close associate of both men said last week . It was a decade ago that Eisner left as head of Paramount and brought his fast-talking , hyper-ambitious president of production with him to Disney . Together they helped transform the moribund studio -- which had only $ 225 million in revenue in 1984 -- into the $ 4.5-billion revenue producer it is today . As studio chairman , overseeing motion_pictures and television , Katzenberg has made contributions to the empire ' s animation franchise and other endeavors that would seem enough to make him the obvious heir to the throne . His track record is among the best in Hollywood , even though the studio has been struggling for years to recapture the lost luster of its live-action movie business . Disney ' s latest animated classic , &quot; The Lion King , &quot; has so far grossed nearly $ 200 million at the box_office in just over four weeks , reconfirming Disney ' s utter dominance of the feature animation kingdom . Under Katzenberg ' s supervision , Disney ' s first foray_into live theater , Broadway ' s &quot; Beauty and the Beast , &quot; is the top-grossing show on the Great White Way . The ABC series &quot; Home Improvement , &quot; produced at Disney under Katzenberg and studio president / TV head Richard Frank , was this past season ' s No . 1 TV_show . But achievement isn ' t always rewarded generously in the corporate jungle . The untimely death of Wells , who had always served as adviser and the mediator between Eisner and Katzenberg and a confidant to both , compounded with Eisner ' s sudden health_problems , complicates their relationship even further , sources suggested . &quot; These two events add an artificial drama to what was already a real-life drama . This situation became much more complicated when . . . the father became vulnerable , &quot; observes one . At this point Eisner isn ' t the only one who ' s vulnerable . Friends say that Katzenberg , widely considered a control freak , has been emotionally frayed by the sudden uncertainty surrounding his career . After turning_down countless job offers in the past , Katzenberg last week confided to those closest to him that he will leave the company if Eisner passes him over . Katzenberg refused to be interviewed for this story . And given his powerful position in the industry and the delicate nature of relationships in Hollywood , dozens of his associates and friends also would not speak on the record . But privately there was no shortage of people willing to speculate on Katzenberg ' s future , and the unusual dynamic that exists between him and Eisner . &quot; If this is not cleared_up soon , it could become a very dangerous situation . . . Jeffrey could become impatient . And both of these men are of incredible value to that company , &quot; a source who is close to Eisner and Katzenberg said last week . A close Katzenberg friend , Jim Wiatt , president of the powerful talent agency ICM , agrees : &quot; It would seem to me , they ( Eisner and the Disney board ) would have to do something soon. &quot; Eisner was expected to return home by this weekend from Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center , where he has been making business phone_calls from his bedside for the past week and has been visited at least twice by Katzenberg . Eisner , who plans to be back at_work within weeks , has made no public comment since his hospitalization . So it is anyone ' s guess if -- and when -- he will make any major decisions regarding the corporate hierarchy . Katzenberg ' s contract is believed to expire within six months , and Eisner may want to move quickly to resolve his future to assure Wall_Street that the company ' s management remains stable . Eisner initially declined to be interviewed for this story , specifically because he did not want to fuel any speculation that Katzenberg ' s role at the company would be changing . But he later relented , deciding that too_much might be read into his silence . At what turned_out to be his last interview before his bypass surgery , Eisner sat at a coffee_table in the anteroom of his pastel-colored executive suite , wearing gray slacks and a light blue shirt . He was robust and talkative , though at times defensive during an informal interview that ran four times longer than originally scheduled . Glancing frequently at the corporate publicist seated across from him , Eisner remarked no less than six times , &quot; I know I ' m going_to regret having done this. &quot; When asked about the Wells position , he drew a sharp distinction between the demands of running a studio and administering a Fortune 500 company . &quot; I don ' t want Jeffrey at the moment to worry about corporate insurance and that ' s what Frank Wells did . . . he kept the machine running , &quot; Eisner said , adding that Katzenberg had always been &quot; spared the day-to-day administrative &quot; duties , and that his &quot; ultimate responsibility is for the creation of product_lines in the motion_picture division. &quot; Said Eisner : &quot; Like casting ( a movie ) , I want to keep my stars in star roles. &quot; It was clear that as much as he treasured Katzenberg as a creative and financial executive , acknowledging that &quot; he has now matured to_the_point where he is a principal in this company , &quot; Eisner viewed himself as the sole king of the Disney jungle organizationally . Industry insiders and friends concede that Katzenberg lacks the depth of experience of Wells , a lawyer and veteran studio executive who oversaw strategic , corporate and financial planning and was Eisner ' s chief adviser . Unlike the media-savvy and image-obsessed Katzenberg , Wells was also a classic background player . Throughout their time together he was content to let Eisner -- with his tousled silver hair and goofy smile that masks a tough interior -- seize the spotlight , whether playing the role once filled by Walt Disney in the company ' s public relations campaigns or basking in the adulation of the media . But Katzenberg ' s closest allies argue that Disney ' s next president doesn ' t have to be in the exact mold of Wells . They say that Katzenberg ' s keen focus and salesmanship could be used to benefit a creative-based company like Disney -- which derives most of its revenue from film , video , television , theme parks and merchandising . They also point_out that others inside the company are available to assume the financial management duties . Many associates believe that Katzenberg , in lieu of an actual promotion , has been quietly grooming himself for broader responsibilities by trading in his casual blue_jeans and polo_shirts for designer suits and spending more time in the company of corporate_executives . Eisner may have been moving to mollify the restless Katzenberg even before Wells ' death by having Katzenberg supervise Disney ' s troubled Hollywood Records unit , its burgeoning interactive division and its extremely successful foray_into legitimate theater , &quot; Beauty and the Beast. &quot; Eisner acknowledged Katzenberg ' s achievements and &quot; creative discipline &quot; in his interview . But he also said that he wants him to remain focused on the studio -- which has been painfully searching for the formula to put the roar back into its flagging live-action business . As &quot; The Lion King &quot; races toward record-setting returns at the box_office and beyond , continuing Disney ' s unprecedented string of success in feature animation and driving ancillary business such_as merchandising and theme parks , its non-animated movies are more like an albatross . Even Katzenberg -- the very model of the relentless , modern industry predator , fiercely pursuing his prey with a laser-like focus , a steel-trap mind and killer drive -- has been unable to break_through the morass of such forgettable , one-note comedies as &quot; Cabin_Boy &quot; and &quot; Holy Matrimony , &quot; which have dominated Disney ' s slate for several years . &quot; Sure , I ' ve been happier with the animated product . . . . In an area of the company where we ' re not doing_well , I ' d like to improve it , &quot; said Eisner , conceding his unhappiness with the studio ' s live-action movies during the last_half of his and Katzenberg ' s 10-year reign at Disney . Despite its problems , Disney remains one of the most profitable studios of all time . The filmed entertainment division , which includes TV and video , generated $ 622 million in operating income for the fiscal_year ended Sept . 30 , 1993 , on gross_revenue of $ 3.7 billion . And profits have steadily gained over the past decade . The division has become a more significant part of Disney ' s operating income . A recent Barron ' s survey showed that it accounted_for 36 % of income last year , compared to 22 % in 1990 . When asked how he expected Katzenberg to be able to shoulder both new responsibilities at_the_same_time he is charged with fixing what is broken at the studio , a confident Eisner said , &quot; I know he can do_it all. &quot; Now , of course , the more critical question becomes what if Katzenberg were to be appointed to the presidency of Disney : Would the corporate duties overshadow his much-needed expertise at the studio ? Those mounting issues will undoubtedly add strain to what is already widely observed as a tense relationship between Katzenberg and Eisner . Those close to Katzenberg say he likens his relationship with Eisner to his marriage to his wife , Marilyn Siegel , in that both relationships have endured the normal ups and downs but they remain deeply committed . Katzenberg likes to say , &quot; I ' ve been married to the same woman and the same man for 19 years. &quot; In his interview , Eisner denied rumors that he and Katzenberg frequently spar , saying , &quot; We disagree on occasions . . . we ' ve never had a fight ! &quot; Some find that hard to believe given their competitiveness . Disney ' s recently departed international president , Bill Mechanic , now president of 20th Century Fox , says : &quot; They ' re perfectionists . They feel that with their record of success , they both have something to offer the process . . . . They bicker , but there ' s a basic level of respect. &quot; Both had something to prove when they came_to Disney in 1984 -- Eisner that he was capable of running a major corporation after spending his career in TV and film , and Katzenberg that he possessed the skill and maturity at age 33 to run a major Hollywood studio . Both succeeded beyond expectations by building on Disney ' s trademark family entertainment franchise . In 10 years , Disney rose from a $ 2 billion a year company to an $ 8 billion a year behemoth with tentacles reaching throughout the globe . It is probably safe to assume that living with such success has made both Eisner and Katzenberg hypersensitive to failure . This may be a cyclical business in which every studio has its ups and downs , but Disney ' s live-action problems stand_in stark contrast to its multibillion-dollar success in feature animation . Since Disney is the industry ' s only brand-name family movie label , the company still clings_to an image of purity and infallibility . Personally for Katzenberg , who by nature is very controlling about how he is publicly perceived , any failure is particularly embarrassing . Privately , people close to the studio chief agree that Katzenberg is so personally intertwined with his work that it ' s impossible to separate the two . He lives and breathes the business -- rising before dawn to begin his workday , and trading in information like a frantic commodities broker . By his very actions , Katzenberg lends insight into the inner workings of Hollywood , from what ends_up on the big screen to the labyrinthine process that gets_it there . The New York-born Katzenberg , son of a Park_Avenue stockbroker , can still pass for a grad_student with his compact , wiry frame , starched preppy clothes and hyperactive , Diet Coke-slugging style . His reputation as a spunky , take-charge guy goes_back to the 1960s , when Katzenberg was a teen-age advance man for New York Mayor John Lindsay for seven years . After brief stints as a talent_agent and producer ' s assistant , he went_to work in 1975 opening mail for Hollywood mogul Barry Diller , then the tough New York-based chairman of Paramount Pictures . Seven years later , Katzenberg , a college dropout , was shipped to Hollywood , where he rose through the ranks to become Paramount ' s president of production under Eisner . People still remember Katzenberg ' s resourcefulness . He once managed to get a plane that was already taxiing on the runway to stop and turn_around and pick_up his Paramount bosses . By 1984 , Eisner had left Paramount and brought Katzenberg along as studio chief . They helped build a nonexistent live-action movie division into a successful business during their first five years with a string of comedy hits that included &quot; Down and Out in Beverly Hills , &quot; &quot; Three Men and a Baby &quot; and &quot; Good_Morning , Vietnam. &quot; The new regime followed an untraditional strategy of putting faded stars and TV actors in inexpensive , high-concept projects that were hatched in-house . Disney evolved from what box-office analyst Art Murphy calls &quot; a half-sized major &quot; studio living_off a_few reissues a year of its animated classics in 1984 to the No . 1 market share position in 1988 with 18 releases . &quot; Nobody had ever done that , &quot; Murphy observes . After five years , the live-action winning_streak that powered the studio ' s growth had all but ended , as Disney refused to keep pace with the escalating salary demands of major stars and directors . But no one seemed to notice . Because by then Katzenberg , along with animation heads Roy Disney and Peter Schneider and a top-drawer team of animators , had revived the studio ' s animation division by creating a new_world of icons for kids with 1989 ' s &quot; The Little Mermaid , &quot; 1991 ' s &quot; Beauty and the Beast , &quot; 1992 ' s &quot; Aladdin &quot; and now &quot; The Lion King. &quot; At the heart of Disney ' s live-action strategy was a continuing effort to cut costs . In 1988 , it created Hollywood Pictures to help pump up the volume from Touchstone Pictures and Walt Disney Pictures . Ricardo Mestres , a Katzenberg protege , was put_in charge of the new division , whose mandate was to churn_out inexpensive high-concept movies for adults . That formula subsequently failed at both Hollywood and Touchstone , with a_few exceptions such_as &quot; Joy Luck Club &quot; and &quot; What ' s Love Got to Do With It. &quot; While the trademark Disney family label has had modest hits like &quot; Homeward Bound &quot; and last year ' s sleeper &quot; Cool Runnings , &quot; it too has had its share of duds , including the recent comedy &quot; Blank Check. &quot; About two months ago , Eisner lost his patience with the continuing dismal performance of Hollywood Pictures and ordered Mestres fired . Many industry insiders believe that Mestres was the fall_guy for the studio ' s more emblematic problem of generally losing touch with its live-action audience . Eisner admitted that he absolutely shares responsibility for Disney ' s problems and is personally involved in helping Katzenberg find a solution . &quot; You have to allow_for failure , &quot; he said . &quot; Even if it ' s a long period_of_time . . . I can deal with this failure and I understand that we have to move on. &quot; That said , Eisner stressed that even though his studio chief was taking_on added business responsibilities , he wanted Katzenberg even more involved in the details of movie-making . Ironically , it was highly publicized criticism of Katzenberg ' s hands-on meddling in creative matters , such_as giving extensive script notes to filmmakers and deciding what actors should wear_on screen , that caused Katzenberg to step back and assume a more macro-management role . Over the last two years , he began delegating more to the division heads and three months ago put his top lieutenant , David Hoberman , in_charge of all three movie units so he could concentrate_on his broadened mandate . Katzenberg no longer signs_off on every project in development , but is still clearly the final say behind what movies get made . Hoberman ' s promotion , clearly , if not coincidentally , may have come at the perfect time for Katzenberg if he is fated to move_into the president ' s position . Regardless , Eisner said he did not want Katzenberg straying too far from the creative front_lines . When he was in the trenches at Paramount , Katzenberg earned the nickname &quot; golden_retriever &quot; for his ability to hunt_down and deliver scripts to his masters faster than anyone in town . &quot; He is still the best golden_retriever I ever met , &quot; Eisner said three weeks ago . &quot; He ' s the best person to follow_through on a project , an idea or slate of ideas . . . that is his main attribute. &quot; In the early stages of their relationship , Eisner says , &quot; I did 100 % of the thinking and he was the one to get something done. &quot; Nowadays , Eisner says Katzenberg &quot; not only gets_it done , he comes_up with the idea. &quot; Producer Joe Roth , who was chairman of 20th Century Fox before bringing his Caravan Pictures to Disney , also praises Katzenberg ' s &quot; incredible focus of energy. &quot; Says Roth : &quot; If you need something done , he gets_it done. &quot; When the Hollywood Records ' soundtrack to Caravan ' s upcoming Keenen Ivory Wayans movie &quot; Low Down Dirty Shame &quot; needed songs , Katzenberg took pop star Janet Jackson to dinner to persuade her to contribute to the album . Even his biggest competitor , Warner Bros . Co-Chairman Robert Daly , concedes : &quot; Jeffrey is one of the best executives in the movie business. &quot; In spite of Disney ' s bad rap with talent that ' s not drawn_on cels , Katzenberg has always been an irresistible magnet for actors , directors and writers . &quot; When Jeffrey gets_on the phone and calls talent , they love it . He ' s absolutely seductive , &quot; says Jerry Katzman , William Morris Agency president . But some say Katzenberg ' s tenaciousness can also work against him . &quot; Once he decides he loves something , whether it ' s a good idea or bad idea , he gets fixated and can be extremely persuasive to get people to do things they don ' t want to do , &quot; says one colleague . In a business sense , one Hollywood insider points_out , &quot; Jeffrey doesn ' t get blinded by his passion -- which is both a tremendous strength and enormous weakness because he doesn ' t gamble . This is such a crapshoot business , I wonder if his allegiance to the corporate culture at Disney hasn ' t sometimes prevented him from taking creative chances you need to take. &quot; Katzenberg ' s vow more_than a year ago that Disney would release 50-60 movies a year , including those that Miramax distributes , also has drawn fire on and off the Burbank lot . &quot; The films start cannibalizing each other in the marketplace , &quot; acknowledges a Disney executive , to which a producer adds : &quot; When a studio puts_out 40 to 60 movies a year , certain pictures , especially smaller movies , are going_to get trampled on . It becomes a Friday-night business . If you don ' t do big business on Friday night , by Monday morning ' s marketing meeting they ' re moving other pictures into your slot. &quot; The Eisner-Katzenberg volume strategy is aimed at building_up Disney ' s library , which was small by industry standards when they took_over . &quot; Our leverage is volume , &quot; Eisner explained . &quot; As the industry became content-starved , our strength became being a volume company . . . . The question is , how do you keep_up volume and keep your quality up ? Our goal is to keep our volume and enhance our quality. &quot; As much head scratching and rethinking of its low-budget , high-volume filmmaking strategy goes_on behind the Disney gates , one of the ways Katzenberg has already moved to reverse the creative shortfall in live action is by diversifying Disney ' s movie lineup . In the last several years , the studio forged deals with key creative producers , including Roth , Andy Vajna ( Cinergi Productions ) and prestigious filmmakers Ismail Merchant and James Ivory ( &quot; Howards End &quot; ) . Disney ' s 1993 purchase of scrappy Miramax Films , which releases such provocative films as &quot; The Crying Game &quot; and &quot; The Piano , &quot; was considered a bold and smart move by the historically conservative studio . For the past two years , Katzenberg has desperately sought to mend fences with Hollywood ' s creative community , given the ill_will that was created by Disney ' s notorious tightfisted and controlling ways with talent . High-powered agents were particularly irked over Katzenberg ' s widely leaked 1991 &quot; memo , &quot; a 28-page scolding of the industry ' s runaway spending on high-priced stars and scripts and Disney ' s own indiscretions in losing sight of cost controls . &quot; When they started_out , in their initial two or three years they were great with talent -- they really took_care of them , &quot; recalls one high-powered agent . &quot; Then Jeffrey started getting hard-line and very combative and he alienated everybody in town . The consensus in the community was that Disney was resistant to creative freedom . They drove writers and directors nuts . Nobody wanted to work there. &quot; A top Hollywood businessman suggests that Disney ' s fiscal prudence was &quot; ultimately what got them into trouble . Because finally , at the end of the day , too many small movies don ' t add_up to anything . They tried to break the star system , but they failed. &quot; But with his usual perseverance and engaging personality , Katzenberg has all but willed top talent back under the Disney tent with promises of more freedom and even more money in some cases . He has even made amends with the town ' s most powerful agent , Creative Artists Agency Chairman Michael Ovitz , who said recently that while at one time &quot; Disney was not especially interested in our established clients , that ' s all ancient history now. &quot; Though still very risk-conscious , Disney is paying market_prices in some cases and has put_out the welcome_mat to such directors as Robert Redford ( whose &quot; Quiz Show &quot; comes_out this fall ) , Tony Scott ( soon to shoot the $ 50-million action film &quot; Crimson Tide , &quot; with Denzel Washington and Gene Hackman ) , &quot; Home Alone &quot; creator John Hughes ( who will make the comedy &quot; The Bee &quot; ) and Mike Newell ( &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral , &quot; &quot; Enchanted April &quot; ) . Redford , whose next movie is also committed to Disney , said that though he had heard &quot; all_the stories about how Disney brutalized talent , how they kept ' B ' and ' C ' lists ( of talent ) and were cheap and interfered , I can tell you I ' m three-quarters of the way through the journey on ' Quiz Show ' and my experience has been absolutely wonderful. &quot; Even Ovitz , known for his tumultuous relationship with Katzenberg in the past , agrees that things have improved . &quot; Jeffrey is a pleasure to do business with , &quot; the agent said . &quot; He is responsive , accessible and someone who will give you a quick answer . I would rather do business with Jeffrey Katzenberg , even if he doesn ' t agree with my point_of_view , than someone with less knowledge who is slower in getting you an answer -- that is death for an agent. &quot; Not everyone is sold on the new Katzenberg . While Ovitz and CAA President Ron Meyer won ' t discuss it , one CAA star who still refuses to do repeat business with Disney is Robin Williams , who is fuming because he says the studio wrongly used his voice as the wisecracking Genie in &quot; Aladdin &quot; to merchandise the film ' s products . Redford ' s experience notwithstanding , another key filmmaker gripes that &quot; the creative environment is worse than ever . They squish and squash the creative life out of you because they have no insight when it comes_to art. &quot; Some industry skeptics argue that Katzenberg ' s less controlling stance is reserved for the &quot; A &quot; list only and may never trickle down to lower-echelon talent . &quot; One of the reasons they had trouble attracting first-class filmmakers is you have to give_up control and Jeffrey Katzenberg finds that one of the most difficult things , &quot; observes Marty Bauer , president of talent agency UTA . &quot; But as he grows as a human_being he ' s trying to cope_with that frailty . . . I think it remains to be seen ( if he backs_off ) but that ' s his intent. &quot; Katzenberg ' s cozying up_to stars and agents has been another source of tension with Eisner . &quot; It was helpful for Herman Melville to give notes to Nathaniel Hawthorne , &quot; he said . &quot; My note to Jeffrey Katzenberg would have been to ignore all these people. &quot; Eisner added : &quot; As we become more user-friendly , I feel we ' ve become less effective . I would encourage Jeffrey Katzenberg to be more detail-oriented . . . . When he was involved in the details and not caring what CAA , ICM or the L.A. Times thought , he did_it great. &quot; While it ' s hard to find anyone in Hollywood who doesn ' t respect Katzenberg ' s talents , many question his creative instincts for picking live-action movies today ' s audiences want to see . A powerful Hollywood lawyer who greatly admires Katzenberg says , &quot; Jeffrey is the best executivein the business and he has no taste. &quot; But to Katzenberg , creating art for art ' s sake had never been a priority . Harvey Weinstein , who along with his brother Bob sold New York-based Miramax to Disney 16 months ago , says , &quot; I don ' t think Jeffrey wants ' Blank_Check ' to be his legacy. &quot; Yet Weinstein recalls phoning Katzenberg after seeing the movie to ask , &quot; What the hell is this ? &quot; Katzenberg ' s response : &quot; that ' s about $ 15 million in corporate profits , my friend. &quot; But Weinstein is quick to defend the studio chief : &quot; I don ' t think he personally has low-brow taste . . . but he ' s in_charge of an operation that has to make a lot of money and when you have to pay those kind of bills , you ' re appealing_to a different common denominator. &quot; Katzenberg , for his part , recently assured a close associate that Disney ' s commitment to a higher level of quality is real , and that &quot; it ' s not good_enough anymore that our films simply make money . They have to have some creative reason for being. &quot; Movies aren ' t the only thing Katzenberg is reassessing . Some have observed that after turning 40 and suffering the loss of several close friends and associates , including lyricist Howard Ashman , the studio chief is placing more emphasis on his personal life with his wife and their 11-year-old twins , Laura and David . The couple now takes yearly Mediterranean cruises . The family has a getaway ski house in Deer Valley , Utah , and spends its traditional two weeks each Christmas in Hawaii . With their main residence in Beverly Hills , the Katzenbergs also have an extravagant beach_house in Malibu . Diller , who socializes with Katzenberg , says , &quot; He has the full_complement -- his wife and his children and his friends . . . . Jeffrey very much has a life. &quot; &quot; I have sensed in Jeffrey a reflectiveness and maturity I didn ' t see before , &quot; says high-powered entertainment attorney Ken Ziffren . &quot; He was a bullet shot out of a gun , but I ' d say he ' s now more open and more personally vulnerable. &quot; This is not to say that Katzenberg ever stops inhaling and exhaling the business or has much of a social life outside work . Other_than his few close friends in the business like music mogul David Geffen and Steven Spielberg , Katzenberg doesn ' t hang_out with Hollywood types , unless of course it ' s business , or fun for business sake such_as his famous all-boy &quot; raft trips , &quot; where the guest list includes other studio heads , executives , agents and actors . Katzenberg defies the stereotype in other ways as well . He has no use for the screenings and premieres that dominate Hollywood night life . The Disney chief regularly attends movies in Westwood and Century City to experience them with real audiences . A number of sources interviewed for this article remarked on how few people really know the personal side of Katzenberg . Even Eisner , who said he probably knows him &quot; better than anyone , &quot; agreed that his colleague doesn ' t easily reveal himself . Eisner and Katzenberg rarely if ever socialize . &quot; They ' re not chums -- it ' s strictly business with them , &quot; says a longtime friend of both . Katzenberg and Spielberg have grown especially close_in recent years . After collaborating on the 1988 hit &quot; Who Framed Roger Rabbit , &quot; Spielberg says that he and Katzenberg discovered they got_along best avoiding the movie business altogether . &quot; We haven ' t talked_about movies in three years , &quot; Spielberg says . &quot; And we became better friends the moment we stopped . A lot of people don ' t believe me when I say Jeffrey can talk for two hours without mentioning film. &quot; The two movie millionaires went_into partnership on a restaurant_chain called Dive ! whose first location recently opened in Century City . Spielberg says the business came_together after he complained to Katzenberg that there were no good submarine_sandwiches in L.A. Within a day , Spielberg recalls , Katzenberg had arranged a meeting with a Chicago food service company , which turned the Dive ! concept into reality . Katzenberg ' s boundless energy , like his hunger , hasn ' t waned with years . This is a guy who doesn ' t take breaths between bites , who drives like a crazed teen who just got his license . He still rises before dawn to work_out or just plain work , still schedules appointments down to the nanosecond , still reads half_a_dozen scripts a weekend , still_lives by to-do lists on little cards , still burns_up the phone_lines ( recently calling all 600 people who worked_on &quot; The Lion King &quot; to personally thank them ) and still logs more miles than a flight_attendant . Legendary for his quirkiness , Katzenberg is so fond of his supercharged Mustang convertible that he recently bought and stored one of the last of its kind to roll_off the assembly_line . Organization is his religion , control his mantra . Aside from color-coding his clothes in his home closets , even his raft trips and corporate retreats are &quot; completely scheduled &quot; and punctuated by &quot; forced fun &quot; activities , as one participant puts it . Arnold Rifkin , worldwide head of the motion_picture division at the William Morris Agency , observes that Katzenberg sits at the control_panel even in the wilds of the Colorado rapids . &quot; Only he knew the arrival_time of our helicopters . Our exit depended_on him . We had no phones , no communications of any sort. &quot; In honor of David Hoberman ' s recent nuptials , Katzenberg threw a Las Vegas bachelor_party for a group of his friends , who boarded Disney jets for the Mirage Hotel , where they partied in a private suite . During the festivities , Katzenberg slipped out for nearly an hour . When asked about his whereabouts , he nonchalantly explained that he was meeting with Las Vegas developer Steve Wynn , his and Spielberg ' s Las Vegas partner in Dive ! &quot; It suddenly struck us that Jeffrey took these fairly influential people to Vegas and parked us in this room for 45 minutes ! &quot; recalls UTA ' s Jeremy Zimmer , who said that even Katzenberg had a good laugh over it . For Katzenberg , already at a personal and professional crossroads , the pivotal and unforeseen events of the last 3 1 / 2 months will force a resolution of his fate . The further role of fate aside , it ultimately boils_down to what Eisner decides to do . Needing to cut_down on stress , the convalescing Disney chairman may rethink his workaholic ways and be more ready to share the power and the pressure that goes_with it . In retrospect , his assessment three weeks ago of_his_own job and Katzenberg ' s unbridled ambition was perhaps telling if not ironic . &quot; Jeffrey has a better job than I do , &quot; Eisner said . &quot; He has all_the fun stuff. &quot;</TEXT>
