   <HEADLINE> AZT FOUND TO PROTECT FETUSES FROM AIDS ; MEDICINE : FEDERALLY SPONSORED STUDY SAYS DRUG SHARPLY REDUCES TRANSMISSION OF VIRUS FROM MOTHERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The results of a federally sponsored study testing the AIDS drug AZT in infected pregnant women have shown that the drug has a dramatic effect in preventing transmission of the virus to the fetus , The Times has learned . The findings , which are scheduled to be released by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious_Diseases today , are so significant that a special monitoring board -- which has been examining the study on an ongoing basis -- met late last week and immediately recommended that the placebo arm of the study be stopped and that all pregnant women remaining in the trial be given the drug . The study was a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study , meaning that one group of women had been receiving a medically worthless placebo for comparison purposes . The NIAID , which is part of the National Institutes of Health , took the unusual step of releasing the data so that physicians across the nation would be aware of the results . But it stopped short of recommending that doctors treating pregnant infected women automatically prescribe the drug because its long-term effects on young children are still unknown . &quot; The data are very encouraging , but we still want to make_sure there are no long-term toxicities , &quot; said Dr. Anthony Fauci , director of the NIAID . &quot; We don ' t see any indication of that , but we will only know that from long-term follow-up . With regard_to just the efficacy , it seems to be pretty compelling . &quot; I think these are important data that physicians and health_care_providers and patients should be aware of in_order to make a decision. &quot; Several thousand children have contracted AIDS since the epidemic began in 1981 , and approximately 10 # 000 or more children are believed to be infected with the human_immunodeficiency_virus that causes the deadly disease . Early in the epidemic , a small number of infections among children were the result of blood_transfusions and contaminated blood products for treating hemophilia . But the vast majority of infections occur when an infected woman transmits the virus to her fetus during pregnancy or delivery . The exact mechanism of transmission is unknown , but infected women have a 25 % or greater chance of passing the virus on to the unborn children , studies show . In this study , which began in April , 1991 , data was obtained for 364 babies who were born to infected women . Of these , 53 babies were infected . Of those 53 infants , only 13 were born to mothers treated with AZT , while the remaining 40 were born to mothers given placebos . Among all babies whose mothers received AZT , only 8.3 % were infected , but 25.5 % of babies born to mothers who received the placebo were infected . Fauci said the only short-term problem found in the group of babies treated with the drug was mild , reversible anemia . The health of the babies has been followed for at least 18 months , in part to accurately determine whether they carried a true infection . It is difficult to accurately determine whether a child is infected with the AIDS virus until he or she reaches the age of about 15 months . Until then , children typically carry antibodies passed_on from their mothers -- rather than their own -- so testing is often imprecise . The study originally was slated to include 740 HIV-infected women , but it was stopped before full enrollment was reached . The women were randomized into two groups , an AZT group and a placebo-control group . Women between 14 weeks and 34 weeks of pregnancy received the drug or a placebo orally . The drug or a placebo was administered intravenously during labor . After birth , the infants were also given AZT or a placebo orally for their first six weeks of life . For the women , treatment with the drug began no earlier than 14 weeks of pregnancy in_order to protect the fetus from potential damage . By that time , key organs are already formed and are considered less vulnerable . The study took_place at 59 facilities in the United States and nine in France , including 35 financially supported by the NIAID and 15 supported by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , also a part of the NIH . Susan DeLaurentis , a co-founder of the Los Angeles-based Pediatric AIDS Foundation , said she welcomed the study results but that she hopes research will continue into other ways to prevent transmission from mother to fetus . &quot; We ' re still interested in how transmission occurs to begin with , so we can find ways to block all transmission from all infected women , &quot; she said . &quot; But this is certainly encouraging news. &quot; AZT , which is manufactured by Burroughs Wellcome Co . of Research Triangle Park , N.C. , is one of a class of AIDS drugs that attack the underlying viral condition . It has also been shown to be effective in improving the quality_of_life for patients with fully developed AIDS , and to delay the onset of AIDS in infected individuals who have not yet experienced symptoms of disease . It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1987 .</TEXT>
