   <HEADLINE> EVOLOVING WIRELESS WORLD ; AIRTOUCH , US WEST TO MERGE DOMESTIC CELLULAR OPERATIONS ; DEALS : THE UNION WOULD CREATE THE NATION ' S THIRD-LARGEST WIRELESS COMPANY , WITH ASSETS OF $ 13.5 BILLION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Joining the small club of companies seeking to become national wireless communications providers , the former Pacific Telesis subsidiary AirTouch Communications announced Monday that it will merge its domestic cellular_telephone operations with those of the regional Bell telephone_company US West . The deal would create a joint operation with assets valued at $ 13.5 billion . It would be the nation ' s third-largest wireless communications company , with franchise areas covering 53 million people , mostly in the West . Monday ' s announcement comes_on the heels of a similar cellular merger announced last month by Bell Atlantic and Nynex , two East Coast regional phone_companies . AirTouch was rumored to be a potential third partner to that deal . Analysts say it is now unlikely that the two coastal giants will merge , though they might reach a looser cooperation agreement . &quot; We have built the platform from which we are confident we can create a national presence , &quot; said Sam Ginn , chairman and CEO of AirTouch . &quot; Customers want wireless ( phones ) to work not just in their neighborhood or community , but globally. &quot; The complex deal calls_for the two cellular companies to operate under a joint management company but remain independent until certain regulatory restraints are removed . AirTouch would own 70 % of the new , Walnut Creek-based management company . AirTouch and US West would also establish a 50-50 venture to jointly bid in upcoming Federal Communications Commission auctions for personal communications services licenses . These licenses will be used to offer a new kind of pocket telephone_service . Time Warner , in which US West has a 25 % stake , may also invest in the PCS joint_venture , Ginn said . AirTouch ' s former sister company , Pacific Bell , announced earlier this month that it also intends to bid on PCS licenses . The regional Bell operating companies are responding to growing competition in the wireless arena from national players such_as McCaw Cellular , soon to be acquired by AT &amp; T , and Nextel , in which MCI Communications has a major stake . &quot; In telecommunications today , you have to either get big or get_out , &quot; said Herschel Shostek , head of a Maryland-based wireless communications research company . Although the new_deal specifically excludes overseas cellular properties , Shostek said the new joint_venture strengthens AirTouch and US West ' s profile as the companies continue their expansion into international markets . But the new coalition has obvious weaknesses at_home . It has no recognizable national brand name and no position in key eastern markets such_as New York . Executives of the two companies said they will move quickly to fill_in the gaps by making alliances and acquiring smaller players . US West Chief_Executive Richard McCormick said the new venture ' s scale will help attract new partners . Under the AirTouch-US West agreement , the two firms ' cellular operations would remain nominally separate but would be managed by a joint &quot; wireless management company &quot; on an &quot; as-if-merged basis , &quot; Ginn said . The management company would act_as a sort of headquarters for both the cellular operations and the PCS joint_venture , providing general direction as well as support services on a contract basis , he said . The two operations would be merged either when US West received a waiver to the consent decree governing the 1984 Bell System break-up , or at the latest , four years from now . The consent decree prevents Bell operating companies from offering long-distance services , for example , meaning that long-distance_calls from a US West cellular system must be handed off to a long-distance company . AirTouch was spun_off from Pacific Telesis in part to avoid these constraints . US West would have the right to convert its 30 % share_in the cellular joint_venture into AirTouch common_stock within 10 years after the agreement . AirTouch stock rose 12.5 cents Monday to $ 26 and US West gained 62.5 cents to close at $ 40.87 in New York Stock_Exchange trading . * WIRING THE WORLD : A look_at the global telecommunications revolution .
