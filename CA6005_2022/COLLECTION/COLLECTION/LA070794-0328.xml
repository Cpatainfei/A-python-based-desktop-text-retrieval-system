   <HEADLINE> BONDS , STOCKS MIXED DESPITE FED RESTRAINT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stocks and bonds finished mixed for a second consecutive session , mostly unmoved by the Federal_Reserve_Board ' s decision not to raise short-term interest_rates again . On Wall_Street , the Dow Jones industrials rose 22.02 points to 3 # 674.50 , but that was largely because of big moves_in a_few stocks . The broad market finished flat ; the Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 index eased 0.24 point to 446.13 , and losing stocks narrowly outnumbered rising issues on the New York Stock_Exchange . In the bond market , short-term yields slid after the Fed ended its policy meeting without taking action . The yield on three-month Treasury_bills dropped to 4.35 % from 4.42 % at Tuesday ' s auction . But longer-term yields were mostly unchanged . The yield on the 30-year T-bond edged_up to 7.59 % from 7.58 % Tuesday . Some analysts said they were surprised by the bond market ' s indifference to the Fed ' s apparent decision to keep monetary policy unchanged for the next six weeks . Since the dollar began to slide in late June , Wall_Street has feared that the Fed would feel compelled to raise short-term rates again , to defend the currency . Those fears have helped push the yield on the one-year T-bill , for example , to 5.42 % now from 5.23 % on June 23 . The fact that most bond yields held steady on Wednesday , after the Fed ended its meeting , suggested to some analysts that the market remains wary about Friday ' s June employment report . If the employment report is stronger than expected it could encourage the Fed to tighten credit for economic reasons , not to help the dollar . On Wednesday , the dollar rallied from a 14-month low against the German mark after a spokesman for French Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur said monetary issues would be a main topic at the Group of Seven summit this weekend . The dollar ended at 1.575 German marks in New York after dropping to 1.565 marks , lowest since late-April 1993 . But Wednesday ' s close still was lower than the 1.580 marks at Tuesday ' s close . The dollar also eased 98.85 Japanese yen , just below Tuesday ' s close of 98.90. In commodity markets_prices overall were lower again . Oil prices fell on profit-taking as the market appeared to downplay recent concerns about supply interruptions in Yemen and Nigeria . August crude_oil futures dropped 38 cents a barrel to $ 19.24 at the New York Merc . Among Wednesday ' s stock_market highlights : * The Dow got a lift as bargain-hunters bid Caterpillar up 2 3 / 4 to 104 1 / 2 ; Alcoa , up 1 1 / 8 to 77 ; International Paper , up 1 3 / 4 to 68 3 / 4 , and Texaco , which gained 1 5 / 8 to 62 1 / 2 in reaction to Tuesday ' s report of new cost-cutting plans . * On the downside , Dime Bancorp of New York tumbled 1 3 / 8 to 9 1 / 4 after agreeing to merge with Anchor Bancorp to create the nation ' s fourth-largest savings bank , with $ 20 billion in assets . Anchor fell 7 / 16 to 15 1 / 2 . * Investors also continued to punish computer networker Wellfleet Communications , which on Tuesday agreed to buy SynOptics , another networker . Wellfleet shares slumped 7 / 8 to 19 3 / 16 . * Earnings_reports and previews took a toll on the market . Amway Asia Pacific lost 7 1 / 4 to 26 7 / 8 after reporting lower quarterly earnings . Telecommunications_equipment maker Summa Four plunged 10 1 / 4 to 11 3 / 4 after saying quarterly earnings won ' t meet expectations . Also , brokerage Salomon fell 2 to 45 1 / 2 after previewing its second-quarter results , which will amount to a large loss . Overseas , Tokyo stocks ended with moderate losses .
