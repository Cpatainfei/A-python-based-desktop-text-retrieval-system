   <HEADLINE> GALLERY : NOT YOUR AVERAGE LAP DOGS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> By the lunar_calendar observed throughout Asia , 1994 is the Year of the Dog -- and no dog is more respected in all Korea than the Jindo . Isolated on the remote island of Jindo off southwestern Korea , the breed evolved into fierce hunters.Their job was to catch wild game and bring it home to their masters . Sometimes several dogs would work together to bring_down a deer or other large animal , then one dog would go get their owner while the others stayed behind to guard the game . &quot; Natural_selection favored the mightiest dogs to breed while the weaker ones died_out , &quot; says In Sub Yang of the 400-member Korean Jindo Club in Los Angeles . &quot; That explains their aggressive nature. &quot; Jindo folklore is rich with tales of an ancestry that includes Mongolian war dogs and Asian wolves . During the 1930s , the breed nearly became extinct when the Japanese military rounded up more_than 300 # 000 of the dogs to make fur_coats for soldiers fighting in Manchuria . Today , there are an estimated 14 # 000 dogs on the island and perhaps 2 # 000 in the United States , despite efforts by the South_Korean government to control export of purebred Jindos . The dogs are prized for their intelligence and perseverance , says Junnie Yoon , a dog_show judge from South_Korea . Stories abound of Jindos overcoming great difficulties and distances to find their way home . &quot; However aggressive Jindo dogs are , that aggression is only directed at wild animals , &quot; Yoon says . &quot; Jindo dogs should never show aggression toward people unless they perceive harm intended to them . &quot; It is not a fighting dog , but when it is confronted with an aggressive dog , it will fight until it drops. &quot;</TEXT>
