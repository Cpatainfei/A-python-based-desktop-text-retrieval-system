   <TEXT> Downhill ski racers are a strange breed and don ' t deny it . While the rest of the world looks_forward to the Olympics , you suspect some skiers almost consider it a nuisance -- merely the most crowded stop on a whirlwind European tour . Luxembourg ' s Marc Girardelli , one of the greatest ski racers ever , has long maintained that winning Olympic gold is not important to him . Coincidentally , perhaps , he has not won a gold medal . AJ Kitt , the veteran U.S. downhiller , tried to explain the concept to reporters in a news_conference to preview Sunday ' s first Alpine event , the men ' s downhill . The race is expected to attract 38 # 000 spectators . &quot; If you want to be remembered as a great ski racer , be renowned with your peers , win Kitzbuehel ( Austria ) or Wengen ( Switzerland ) , &quot; he said . &quot; If you want to be remembered by everyone else , win the Olympics. &quot; The meat-and-potatoes portion of ski racers ' careers , the World Cup circuit , is largely ignored outside of Europe . The racers contend that the only time anyone cares about them is Olympic time . When Kitt finished ninth in the 1992 Albertville Games , a relatively pleasing result to him , people came_up_to console him . * The death of Ulrike Maier on Jan . 30 still weighs heavily on international skiers . The Austrian star died after crashing on the downhill course at Garmisch-Partenkirchen , Germany . Kitt concedes that danger is part of the sport and is of the opinion that course safety has greatly improved in recent years . He was critical , though , of the placement of a timing post on the Garmisch course . Maier ' s head struck the post . &quot; We have to make_sure that never , ever happens again , &quot; Kitt said . Kitt was relieved that a men ' s downhill , scheduled at Garmisch four days after Maier ' s death , was canceled . &quot; It would have been hard to go 80 m.p.h. past that part of the course , and not think_about what happened to Ulrike Maier , &quot; he said . * On the other hand , Paul Major , the U.S. Alpine director , said Maier ' s death will not make his skiers skittish . &quot; It ' s not so_much the safety , &quot; Major said . &quot; They ' re shaken more because of the death itself . She was a star of the sport , a mother , a great person , too . that ' s the shocking part . But the racers are not looking_at the course going , ' Where am I going_to fall and hurt myself. ' &quot; * Major said there was no serious discussion about leaving Diann Roffe-Steinrotter off the U.S. team . Roffe-Steinrotter , the 1992 Olympic giant slalom silver medalist , has struggled since the Albertville Games and ranks 30th in the current World Cup GS standings and 60th in the World Cup overall . &quot; She ' s scored across the board in GS and super-G , &quot; Major said . &quot; Not great , but she could pop one at any time . . . . She just hasn ' t put it together yet , but the one that counts hasn ' t come yet. &quot; CHRIS DUFRESNE</TEXT>
