   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA TAKES HARD LINE ON CHECHNYA ; CAUCASUS : KREMLIN WITHDRAWS OFFER FOR PEACE SUMMIT WITH BREAKAWAY REPUBLIC , SAYS IT IS PREPARING TO BOMB CAPITAL . MOSCOW LAUNCHES ROCKET ATTACK ON VILLAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Kremlin withdrew its offer for a peace summit with Russia ' s tiny breakaway republic of Chechnya on Saturday and said it was preparing to bomb the rebel capital into submission . Shortly after midnight today , Russian forces launched a rocket attack on the village of Pervomaiskoe , 15 miles north of the heavily armed capital of Grozny , according to Chechen military sources . Just before dawn today , Russian warplanes again reportedly streaked over Grozny but did not strike . Gen . Dzhokar M . Dudayev , the Chechen leader , sent two urgent messages during the evening accepting a 2-day-old Kremlin offer of top-level peace talks . But the Security_Council said that only leaders of the military operation would meet with him and only to discuss disarming his supporters . In grave tones , Russian authorities made_it clear that their hardening campaign against a 3-year-old declaration_of_independence by the oil-rich Muslim republic had reached its apex . &quot; Starting at midnight , Interior and Defense Ministry forces will take decisive steps , using all means at their disposal to restore order , &quot; a Foreign Ministry communique said . &quot; Bandit groups will then be disarmed , and those which dare to resist will be destroyed. &quot; Among the &quot; decisive steps &quot; planned , said Deputy Prime_Minister Nikolai D . Yegorov , were air strikes and ground-to-ground rocket attacks on &quot; strategic objects &quot; in Grozny . Russian officials appealed_to journalists and other noncombatants to leave the city . But five anti-war members of the Russian Parliament remained there in protest . Chechen authorities threatened to execute 20 captured Russian soldiers if bombing started . From an old Soviet textbook , they read instructions on television to the estimated 200 # 000 people still in Grozny on how to use grenades to cripple invading tanks . &quot; When the bombing starts , we will go_to our shelters , and when it is finished we will go_out to defend the city , &quot; said Chechen government spokesman Movladi Yudugov . As the deadline approached , a defiant mood gripped the Chechen capital , a city of half-finished apartment blocks and decrepit oil refineries 1 # 000 miles south of Moscow . Reporters leaving the city said roads were crowded with both people fleeing and gunmen driving_in to defend the place . The main square was packed with part of the republic ' s irregular army of several thousand . Chechnya ' s militant nationalism poses the most serious challenge to President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s government since Communists and other hard-liners seized the Parliament building in Moscow in October , 1993 , and staged a two-day armed rebellion that was put_down by tanks . Fearing an unraveling of the huge , multiethnic Russian Federation , Yeltsin has refused to recognize Chechnya ' s independence . But only in recent months has he gone_along with demands by hawks in his government to crush the secession drive . The Security_Council , which met for three hours in the Kremlin hospital where Yeltsin is recovering from nose surgery , chose to resort_to bombs and rockets after a week of sluggish , hesitant convergence on Grozny by thousands of troops in three columns of tanks -- Moscow ' s biggest such operation since the war in Afghanistan . One tank column commander was recalled from Chechnya on Saturday after halting his advance 20 miles west of Grozny and promising villagers that his men would never fire on civilians , regardless of orders . The threat of air_attacks was a shift that came_after Yeltsin delayed a Thursday deadline for Chechnya to disarm within 48 hours and offered to send a &quot; full-powered high-level delegation &quot; to meet Dudayev . Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin announced Friday that he would head the Russian side and meet anywhere Dudayev wanted . First Dudayev balked , insisting that Russia pull its troops out before he would talk , and by Saturday the offer from Chernomyrdin had vanished . The Security_Council gave Dudayev an ultimatum to come_to Mozdok , a military garrison town in southern Russia , to work_out the details of disarming Chechnya with Yegorov and Sergei V . Stepashin , Russia ' s chief of counterintelligence -- two key figures in the military operation . &quot; If this does not happen , no other question will be discussed , &quot; a Russian official said . The rebel general rejected the ultimatum but appealed twice , to Chernomyrdin and then to Yeltsin , for talks &quot; at a proper level &quot; on all issues , including the disarming of Chechen fighters . He reminded Yeltsin that the rebel forces were under orders not to shoot . Interfax news_agency reported that a telegram sent to Yeltsin at 9 p.m. arrived in Yeltsin ' s office 30 minutes after the midnight deadline expired . But the Itar-Tass news_agency quoted well-informed sources as saying that the telegram had arrived before midnight . The Kremlin did not respond . Yeltsin and a shrinking circle of hawkish supporters have also ignored a monthlong chorus of anti-war protest from inside Russia . The Federation Council , the upper house of Russia ' s Parliament , took Dudayev ' s side Saturday in_demanding high-level peace talks and a cease-fire . Yegor T . Gaidar , once Yeltsin ' s acting prime_minister and close adviser , called the Security_Council ultimatum &quot; a tragic mistake. &quot; &quot; They talk_about disarming illegal armed units , but I cannot imagine how the whole Chechen nation could be disarmed now , &quot; said Ruslan Aushev , president of the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia . &quot; Starting from 15-year-old boys , and even younger , all who can carry weapons , including women , have risen to defend their republic . They are ready to hold_on to the end. &quot; Officials in Moscow said the Russian troops outside Grozny would enter the city to collect arms . But their willingness to attempt this against violent resistance was in doubt . Just one of the three columns , the one moving from the north , has managed to reach the edge of the city after a week in Chechnya . Russian troops deliberately left roads south from the city open , to allow unarmed people to flee . But the Interior Ministry said Chechen fighters had also left in that direction to set_up camps in the mountains and launch a guerrilla war . Aides said Yeltsin was preparing a decree to impose a Moscow-appointed government in Chechnya that would call new elections . Faced with wariness in the West over the Kremlin ' s drift toward war , the Foreign Ministry appealed for understanding of actions against &quot; a threat of armed extremism &quot; in &quot; an inalienable part of the Russian Federation. &quot; Boudreaux reported from Moscow and Goldberg from Grozny . Times staff writer Sonni Efron in Moscow contributed to this report .</TEXT>
