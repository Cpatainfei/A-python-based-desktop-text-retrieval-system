   <HEADLINE> SENATORS SEEK TO SHIFT RUSSIAN-AMERICAN MILITARY EXERCISES FROM URALS TO THE U.S. ; DIPLOMACY : COMMUNISTS AND NATIONALISTS HAD OPPOSED THE ARRIVAL OF 250 ' YANKEE ' TROOPS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A delegation of U.S. senators Tuesday sought to defuse anti-American sentiment by proposing that joint military exercises , which were to be conducted in Russia , take_place instead on U.S. soil . The United States and Russia agreed in September to the maneuvers , with both governments billing the exercise as a dry_run for possible future peacekeeping operations . The drill was to take_place in July at the Totsk testing ground in the Ural Mountains . Its significance was to be more symbolic than military , because the entire operation was to involve only 250 soldiers from each side , no heavy equipment and no live fire . Still , Communists and nationalists here had seized_on the notion of &quot; Yankee &quot; soldiers on Russian territory as further evidence of what they see as a continued attempt by the United States to impose its will on a weakened Russia . &quot; Russia cannot be made a training ground for the American Army , &quot; lawmaker Pyotr P . Shirshov , an army_officer from Bryansk , said in a heated debate last month . Faced with stiff opposition in Parliament and in the Urals , the Russian government quietly asked the United States on Friday to postpone the exercises . On Sunday , a bipartisan delegation from the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee arrived to learn that the maneuvers , meant to showcase the new cooperation between the old adversaries , had instead fallen victim to resurgent Russian nationalism . Some conservative Russians interpreted the American push for the exercises as &quot; ' We won the Cold_War and now we ' re going to show you our stuff ' -- which is not at all what it was meant to be , &quot; said Sen . Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R-Tex. ) . Given the &quot; sensitivity &quot; of the issue , committee Chairman Sen . Sam Nunn ( D.-Ga. ) said the seven senators visiting here will recommend to President Clinton and Defense_Secretary William J . Perry that the planned U.S.-Russian maneuvers be held_in America . Nunn suggested that the National Training Center at Ft . Irwin in California -- or several bases in his home state of Georgia -- might be just right for the job . Hutchison said she is sure Texas would be pleased to host the exercises . Russian politicians welcomed the U.S. proposal . &quot; All these hysterics about the exercises in the Totsk firing_range are simply comical , &quot; said liberal economist Yegor T . Gaidar , complaining that hard-liners have told people that U.S. troops would use the opportunity to seize Moscow . &quot; Nevertheless , the opposition managed to use this as a pretext for violent anti-Western propaganda. &quot; Gaidar called the Nunn proposal &quot; reasonable and useful -- because the most frequently repeated argument was , ' See , they are not inviting us to have the exercise in the States , are they ? ' &quot; Ironically , the United States and Russia first agreed to hold the maneuvers in Germany . But officials had neglected to consult the German government , which nixed the idea . Next , the United States proposed hosting the exercises , but Russia balked at the $ 2-million price . Sergei N . Yushenkov , chairman of the Defense Committee of the Duma , or lower house of the Russian Parliament , said the maneuvers ' cost could still be a problem . And he said that members of the far-right party led by Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky -- who had insisted that the exercises not be held_in Russia -- were already finding new excuses Tuesday to oppose holding them in the United States . Zhirinovsky supporters have formed an alliance with other nationalists , Communists and conservative Agrarian lawmakers . They often command a Duma majority . &quot; They do not want equal partnership ( with the West ) , and they are not really interested in promoting a stable , firm and reliable international security_system , &quot; Yushenkov said of the hard-line opposition . At the same time , there are signs that Russian lawmakers elected in December are serious about making the new Parliament work . The U.S. senators were invited to Moscow by Duma Speaker Ivan P . Rybkin , who wanted the Senate committee to explain to Russian lawmakers how the U.S. Congress oversees the military budget . Yushenkov said the Defense Committee wants to exert the same level of civilian control over the Russian military as the U.S. Congress exercises over its armed forces -- a statement that impressed the U.S. lawmakers . While they met with a range of Russian politicians -- including Zhirinovsky backers -- the senators did not request a meeting with President Boris N . Yeltsin . In Soviet times , visiting lawmakers always had token meetings with the Supreme Soviet , the puppet legislature , then held more substantive meetings with the real rulers . &quot; We didn ' t want to give the impression that our meetings with the Duma were perfunctory , &quot; Sen . Dan Coats ( R-Ind. ) said . The U.S. lawmakers used their visit to discuss the chaotic , punitive Russian tax_system , which discourages foreign investment . Russian lawmakers , meanwhile , complained about U.S. efforts to prevent Russian weapons sales to other countries , contending that the United States is acting simply to block competition in the lucrative world arms market . Nunn also stressed the need for U.S. and Russian lawmakers to take a more active role in overseeing the dismantling and destruction of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons . The Georgia senator said he is &quot; frustrated &quot; by bureaucratic delays in distributing the $ 1 billion that Congress has appropriated to help Russia , Ukraine , Kazakhstan and Belarus do_away_with their weapons of mass destruction . He said he had been assured the money will begin flowing soon . Nunn said there are no documented cases of Russian organized crime groups stealing or selling materiel from the old Soviet arsenal but said that such a threat exists .</TEXT>
