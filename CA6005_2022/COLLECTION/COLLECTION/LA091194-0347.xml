   <HEADLINE> POP EYE : STREISAND , PURE AND UNSWEETENED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You might not be surprised by what you hear on Barbra Streisand ' s upcoming live two-CD set , &quot; Barbra : The Concert. &quot; After all , the recent tour that it documents is one of the most publicized pop treks ever -- not to mention one of the highest-grossing . But you might be surprised by what you don ' t hear : overdubs . &quot; All the performances are as they happened , &quot; says Jay Landers , who co-produced the album with Streisand . It ' s always been standard for so-called &quot; live &quot; albums to be , um , improved in the studio , and Streisand is one of show_biz ' s most notorious perfectionists . Her manager , Marty Erlichman , says that she was still fiddling_with her recent HBO special an hour before it was telecast . &quot; Nothing with Barbra is ever just handed in , &quot; Erlichman says . &quot; On these recordings there were 64 musicians and it takes a lot of mixing and editing to make_it really sound live. &quot; But Landers says that it was Streisand ' s very perfectionism in planning and performing the concerts that made overdubs unnecessary . &quot; Fortunately , in this particular situation it was sort of a matter of being able to choose -- and I don ' t want to sound too effusive -- be tween great and greater performances of particular songs , &quot; Landers says . &quot; We spent a considerable amount_of_time listening and relistening to all_the shows we recorded. &quot; The album , which will be in_stores Sept . 27 and will sell for about $ 30 in CD , was compiled from four shows at New York ' s Madison Square Garden , with a bonus of a Disney medley ( &quot; Once Upon a Dream , &quot; &quot; When You Wish Upon a Star &quot; and &quot; Someday My Prince Will Come &quot; ) that Streisand only performed in Las Vegas . A &quot; companion &quot; home video being released the same day is identical to the HBO special , documenting the Anaheim Pond concert that closed the tour . The exception is that videos sold at Blockbuster video and music stores will have an extra song : &quot; What Are You Doing for the Rest of Your Life ? &quot; The two CDs are presented as Act I and Act II of the show , starting with the Marvin Hamlisch-led orchestra ' s overture and Streisand ' s opener , &quot; As If We Never Said Goodbye &quot; from &quot; Sunset Boulevard. &quot; Other selections include &quot; Lover Man , &quot; &quot; On a Clear Day ( You Can See Forever ) , &quot; &quot; Evergreen , &quot; &quot; The Way We Were &quot; and a 10-minute medley from &quot; Yentl. &quot; The album features Streisand ' s full concert of 27 songs , plus much of the monologue material she used to introduce or link the numbers . Several other non-musical elements were included to underscore a sense of spontaneity . Says Landers : &quot; One evening the composer Jule Styne , who did ' Funny Girl , ' was in the audience , front row center , and Barbra dedicated ' People ' to him and the New York audience went berserk , so we wanted to have that . And on the closing night ( of the New York run ) , Barbra ' s image was projected on the Jumbotron in Times Square where there were tens of thousands of people , and Barbra shouted_out ' Hello , Times Square ! ' and we wanted to preserve that moment. &quot; Steve Hochman</TEXT>
