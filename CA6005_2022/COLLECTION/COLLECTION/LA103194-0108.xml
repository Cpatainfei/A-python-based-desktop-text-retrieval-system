   <HEADLINE> JAPAN GEARS_UP TO BECOME MAJOR PARTICIPANT IN AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Japanese industry struggles to adapt to the strengthening yen , Toshifumi Hirai , an official at Japan ' s Ministry of International Trade and Industry , has his eyes set_on the 21st Century . The economics of the strong yen will probably force Japan ' s currently most profitable industries -- textiles , electronics , automobiles -- to manufacture offshore in developing countries , said Hirai , director of the Aircraft and Ordnance Division at MITI . &quot; We need to find new , promising , profitable high-tech industries . . . . I think aircraft , or space , has a market in the next century. &quot; But worldwide competition in the aircraft industry is akin to a &quot; marathon race &quot; in which Japan is too weak and too far behind to even dream of taking the lead , Hirai added . &quot; We have to keep running to see the backs of the front runners , &quot; he said . &quot; We have no intention and no capability to pass them . But we just want to keep running the same distance or less distance behind. &quot; Despite such modesty , Japan ' s efforts to develop an aircraft industry are taken very seriously by leading U.S. firms . MITI , after all , is famous for its success at nurturing industries , including steel and televisions , which later grew to devastate their American rivals . U.S. firms , instead of seeing Japan as a threat , perceive the developments as part of the growing globalization of high_technology industries and are aggressively seeking to become partners with Japanese aerospace firms -- even supplying technical support . George David , president of United Technologies Corp. , the Hartford , Conn.-based maker of Pratt &amp; Whitney aircraft_engines , acknowledged during a visit to Tokyo that his firm ' s cooperation with Japanese companies was contributing to their technical abilities in aerospace . But he said he wasn ' t worried about helping to create future competitors . &quot; I believe they will be competitors anyway , &quot; he said . &quot; I would much rather partner with the strongest possible competitors rather than have to meet all_of them head-to-head in the marketplace. &quot; Klaus Brauer , Boeing ' s chief analyst for marketing and communications , noted that aircraft design and manufacture is &quot; an industry with very high risks. &quot; Japanese firms essentially have two choices , he said : They can &quot; throw all their eggs in one basket &quot; by picking a narrow niche to focus_on as full-fledged competitors , or they can continue their current efforts to diversify and share risk with foreign partners . So far , he said , the Japanese have chosen the less-risky path of partnership . &quot; That makes perfect sense to us , &quot; he said . &quot; We see that continuing. &quot; U.S. occupation forces dismantled Japan ' s aircraft industry after World_War_II . The industry has staged a comeback in recent decades to record sales of $ 8.7 billion last year , according to the Society of Japanese Aerospace Companies . About 75 % of the industry ' s output is military work for Japan ' s Self-Defense Forces , such_as production of F-15 fighter jets under U.S. licenses . Much of the commercial work consists_of producing parts for the Boeing ' s 767 and 777 jetliners , and for Pratt &amp; Whitney engines for those planes . The goal is to change the ratio to about 50-50 military and commercial , said Shinya Kobayakawa , senior managing director of the Japan Aircraft Development Corp . ( JADC ) , an umbrella organization for Japan ' s five key aircraft firms : Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. , Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. , Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. , ShinMaywa Industries Ltd . and Japan Aircraft Manufacturing Co . Ltd . A key piece of the JADC strategy is for its firms to take the leading role in the design and manufacture of a new small passenger jet the Japanese have dubbed the YSX . JADC has for several years explored building such a plane with an American or European partner , either in the 100-seat or 75-seat class . The YSX , if built , is likely to be a multinational effort . One possible scenario is for JADC , Boeing and Chinese state-run aircraft manufacturers to cooperatively build a 100-seat airplane . Boeing , for its part , has also been interested for several years in building a jet of this size . Boeing and JADC have launched a joint feasibility study for such an airplane , but design work remains in the early stage . The Japanese believe the YSX could satisfy a global market for passenger jets smaller than those of the Boeing 737 series , which seats 108 to 159 passengers . Estimates of expected demand over the next two decades for this kind of smaller jet range from 1 # 500 to 3 # 000 aircraft . The Japanese industry sees the YSX as a step toward participation in even bigger multinational projects , possibly including a post-Concorde supersonic transport or a new 600-passenger jumbo jet . Japanese aircraft manufacturers have built only one model of commercial airplane during the postwar period : the 60-seat YS11 , a turboprop airplane made largely from imported parts . The YS11 was a technological success but failed commercially . Production was discontinued in 1972 after only 180 of the airplanes were sold . The Japanese conceive_of the YSX as a larger and much more sophisticated successor to the YS11 . Japanese manufacturers gained design and technical skills as a result of their participation in the development of the Boeing 777 , which is just now coming_into production . Their share_in the 777 is valued at 21 % , in terms of work performed , risk taken and profit to be shared . The five JADC firms also had a 17 % participation in the Boeing 767 . Engineers from the JADC firms , which are primarily making large sections of the 777 fuselage , worked together with Boeing engineers in designing those sections . &quot; The quality of the parts that are produced for our airplanes by Japanese firms is very , very good , &quot; said Brauer , the Boeing analyst . &quot; The Japanese firms are very highly regarded as partners here. &quot; Mitsubishi Heavy and Kawasaki Heavy are partners with United Technologies in the production of Pratt &amp; Whitney engines for Boeing aircraft sold to Japanese airlines . Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries ( IHI ) makes Pratt &amp; Whitney F100 military engines under license for use in F-15J jet fighters , which are made by Mitsubishi Heavy for Japan ' s Air Self-Defense Force . &quot; I think the idea of controlling the means of production in one nation , and controlling the technology in one nation , is actually bound to be a thing of the past in the 21st Century , &quot; David explained . &quot; We need to prepare ourselves for the 21st Century economy , where there is a globalization of resources , a globalization of technology development , a globalization of the means of production. &quot; Such a trend is reflected in international maneuvering aimed at forming alliances to build a 100-seat passenger jet . While Japanese firms and Boeing are conducting preliminary studies , Boeing has also discussed a small plane program with Taiwan and China . South_Korea and China , meanwhile , have held their own talks_about cooperating with a European firm to produce a small jet . &quot; The reason the Japanese aerospace industry is interested in the YSX is because we want to take the initiative in the program , &quot; Mitsubishi ' s Hineno said . &quot; But China and South_Korea have the same idea . Probably China wants to lead the project , and South_Korea is thinking the same way . It is impossible for every company in the world to work together on it . Probably there will be several groups in the future , and they will compete against each other. &quot; The Japanese think they can build the small plane , but don ' t believe they have the design and sales skills to make_it a commercial success . Japanese capabilities , however , are rapidly expanding , and the industry ' s dreams are ambitious . MITI is providing nearly $ 40 million a year in annual subsidies for research into engine systems and materials for a supersonic or still-faster &quot; hypersonic &quot; aircraft of the future , Hirai said . A new supersonic transport may become reality , most likely under U.S. leadership , early in the 21st Century , Hirai said . When it does , Japan wants to be a player . &quot; National security , profitability , national pride , the good effect on other industries , technology spinoffs to other fields -- all these things are included , &quot; he explained . &quot; It is like the Olympic games. &quot;</TEXT>
