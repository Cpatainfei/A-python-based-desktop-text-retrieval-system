   <TEXT> How would you like to buy an executive house in a quiet , desirable , sophisticated neighborhood ? It ' s in a tranquil setting , near a country_club and in an area that ' s prestigious and near churche s and temples and an elementary_school . This sure sounds good to me , but guess again . Most of these descriptive words are actually considered &quot; cautionary &quot; or &quot; unacceptable &quot; by the Fair Housing Council of the San Fernando Valley in Panorama City . Indeed , according to federal regulations even exclusive and private are catch words that should be avoided when describing properties for_sale . But as is the case with many federal regulations , nobody seems to know exactly what this means . Granted that housing bias based on race , sex , age and family status is clearly illegal . Many people in the real_estate industry are wondering , though , whether putting such terms as tranquil setting_on a list of phrases to avoid really helps eradicate the scourge of discrimination . &quot; If you or your real_estate_agent advertise your property for rent or sale , you can ' t discriminate , &quot; said Diana Bruno , executive_director of the local Fair Housing Council , a nonprofit group that investigates alleged housing discrimination . Terms like sophisticated or prestigious aren ' t necessarily discriminatory , Bruno said , but they might be if used in a certain context . She and other anti-discrimination advocates are fighting hard to exclude a growing list of terms from real_estate ads . Bruno is also part of a group called the Fair Housing Advertising Task_Force , a local group of advocates , home builders and other business people who are working to make real_estate ads more multicultural . When builders advertise new homes with photos of people , she said , &quot; they must advertise all sorts of people -- people in wheelchairs , people_of_color , different nationalities , etc. &quot; But advertising an apartment_building as a &quot; quiet professional building &quot; is a gray area , Bruno said . That ad could be interpreted as suggesting that only professionals who have no kids are wanted . Another faux pas is advertising a home within walking distance to a church or temple . This , she said , could connote that the seller or landlord only wants a buyer or a tenant who attends church or synagogue services . These kinds of words and terms are being increasingly edited_out by classified departments at local newspapers , which &quot; seems to me an extreme , ridiculous kind of thing , &quot; said Steven Sokol , associate general counsel for the California Assn . of Realtors ( CAR ) . &quot; This is sort of like walking though mush . You can ' t really put your finger on all_the ways someone might construe a particular term. &quot; There is still discrimination in housing that needs to be remedied , Sokol said . As a result , &quot; society is edging forward in trying to figure what constitutes discrimination versus information that buyers ought to be able to get access to. &quot; However , the CAR doesn ' t really monitor real_estate ads , Sokol conceded . But CAR rules and various other rules and statutes do forbid false and misleading advertising . &quot; It ' s all a matter of relativity , &quot; said Steve Ellis , Los Angeles district office manager for the California Department of Real_Estate . &quot; We don ' t have a specific law that says you can ' t use this word or that word . You start getting_into semantics and it ' s pretty difficult to regulate . We don ' t try and become overbearing , &quot; he said . &quot; You shouldn ' t discriminate . But I don ' t know what ' s wrong with saying a home is two blocks from the church and temple . I would think the purchaser would want to know that , &quot; Ellis said . &quot; In general we don ' t have very specific limitations in what to put_in an ad. &quot; Ellis said he regularly gets calls from classified advertising representatives at various local newspapers asking whether the Department of Real_Estate would object to the use of certain words or phrases . Mostly , the state agency is concerned about false and misleading advertising instead of potentially offensive ads . &quot; We hardly ever go_after our licensees for their ads , &quot; Ellis conceded .</TEXT>
