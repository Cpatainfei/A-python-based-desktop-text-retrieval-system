   <TEXT> * Had the readers of your Oct . 14 editorial &quot; Joe Camel Goes_to Grade_School &quot; known that Weekly Reader previously reported on the Joe Camel controversy , they may have reached a different answer to the question you posed about the publication ' s position on smoking . For the record , R.J. Reynolds Tobacco learned of the recent Weekly Reader story through news coverage . Permission was not sought to show the Camel image , nor would it have been given . that ' s because we do agree that young people should not be exposed to cigarette brand messages in school . Previous exposure to the Joe Camel allegations by Weekly Reader , Scholastic News , in-school contests by STAT ( Stop Teenage Addiction to Tobacco ) and former Surgeon_General Antonia Novello placed awareness of the Camel brand and its advertising in schools . Whether parents were made aware of those exposures by student-oriented publications , government officials and anti-smoking industry representatives has not been reported . To date , we ' re not aware that any of those sources have acknowledged to the general public that the Federal Trade Commission found no basis in those allegations . As a parent and school volunteer , your editorial raised a greater concern for me . Did_it not occur to you that given the climate surrounding cigarettes today , students would most likely reject the issues posed by Weekly Reader ? Research conducted last year by Dr. Cornelia Pechmann of UC Irvine Graduate_School of Management indicates that young people have so embraced the anti-smoking message that their impressions of smokers now verge on a whole new class of bigotry and intolerance . Reynolds Tobacco ' s position is firm : Youth should not smoke . The good news is that the 1993 Teenage Attitudes and Practices survey recently reported by the Centers_for_Disease_Control indicates that smoking among 12-to-17-year-olds has dropped 17 % since the 1989 survey . Those are the facts that the public needs to know . PEGGY C . CARTER Manager , Media Relations R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co . Winston-Salem , N.C .</TEXT>
