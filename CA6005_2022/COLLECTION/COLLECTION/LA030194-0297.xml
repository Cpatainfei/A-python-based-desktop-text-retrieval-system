   <TEXT> Dan Gurney , a championship driver from Le Mans to Indianapolis who now builds winning race_cars in Santa Ana , thinks every time_capsule should include an ignition_key . &quot; Then , &quot; he says , &quot; in 2094 somebody would recover it , recall the importance of the car and say , ' This , not the dog , was man ' s best friend. ' &quot; French essayist Jean-Francis Held has taken that thought deeper , writing in a 1990 UNESCO study that from its indelible position in literature , movies , art , business , social progress and national decay , the automobile exemplifies man -- and vice versa . True . Rattletrap East_German Trabants were a symbol of totalitarianism , then of German reunification . It ' s no coincidence that the wood-and-leather interiors of Jaguars and Rolls-Royces are suggestive_of the comforts of a British gentlemen ' s club . The gray , heavy Mercedes-Benz personifies the stereotypical mind-set of Germany , and , with their Day-Glo paintings , flags and tassels , &quot; jeepneys &quot; are a rolling folk_art unique to the Philippines . America ' s passages have always been linked to symbolic automobiles . The Roaring ' 20s belonged_to Packard , the BMW was a yuppie car and baby_boomers drive Volvos . Rebels without causes favored hot-rod coupes , and later cruisers flexed their Dodge and Mustang muscle cars . In the ' 90s , mini-trucks with trick hydraulics memorialize the hip-hop urban culture . So , essayist Held suggests , if a collection of automobiles was preserved in a garage-tomb after a nuclear cataclysm , &quot; some skillful archeologist . . . would be able to deduce from them everything that we were. &quot; * The Americans , for instance . Americans give their cars names , religiously wash them on weekends and , say the sociologists , generally treat their Toyotas like pets . Baby_shoes and St . Christopher medals dangling from rearview_mirrors are talismans to keep us , and our cars , safe . Vanity license_plates are a form of jewelry , psychologists say . And any man cruising his stuff -- whether in a ' 32 Ford hot_rod or a Range Rover that will never tread mud -- usually is playing peacock to the opposite sex . We all have our favorites . Our President has said his most prized possession is a blue , six-cylinder 1967 Ford Mustang convertible he bought from his brother for $ 3 # 000 . Los Angeles , with its freeways , was made_for cars . As a nation , we are spending $ 176 billion a year buying cars , $ 150 billion to fuel them and $ 60 billion to insure them . Some of us were conceived in cars , born in cars , eat_in them , work in them and cover about 2 trillion miles a year in them . Each year , more_than 40 # 000 Americans die in them . The relationship is intense and not without a downside . Psychologists say cars are steel bubbles obviating contact with other humans . Freeways avoid town centers , polarize cities and erode our sense of community . Without cars , we might hear the birds again , there could be air without particles and no drive-by_shootings . Yet , as individuals and nations , the world continues to elevate the car as a fetish . &quot; It ' s a pretty complex gestalt , &quot; acknowledged Robert Cumberford , a former GM designer and columnist with Automobile magazine . &quot; They are still , to me , inefficient , unreasonable objects far from what they could be . . . but also a powerful icon , a powerful operating force for an enormous number of people . &quot; It represents , to me , a freedom , an ability to go where I want to go , when I want to go . It ' s also a cozy little tin house you take with you . . . . Always , a car offers the possibility of endless adventures in distant places . And you ' re just not going_to get that from public transportation. &quot; * The passion is no weaker in Germany , where the recent recession has seen some purists moving to less expensive houses rather than selling their precious cars . For citizens born to the mechanical precision of Mercedes-Benz , BMW , Porsche and Audi , driving and not the destination is the thrill of car travel . There are no speed_limits on the autobahns , and German motorists typically cruise in excess of 100 m.p.h. In town , drivers are noticeably aggressive and totally unforgiving . Said one Californian after a day behind the wheel in Berlin : &quot; This is war in the streets. &quot; As Americans have the powerful National Rifle Assn . protecting their rights to own , bear and fire guns , Germans have the almighty All German Automobile Club lobbying against speed_limits . The auto club issues bumper stickers to its members : &quot; Free Driving for Free People. &quot; Throughout Eastern Europe , car ownership and traffic volumes have doubled in the four years since the fall of communism . With a severe housing shortage , the nouveaux riches have few ways of flashing their status beyond buying expensive cars . Favorites are the Mercedes-Benz , BMW , Porsche and Alfa Romeo . But taxation is excessive , and so are fees for plates and insurance -- on the premise that anyone who can afford a Mercedes can afford the equivalent of a month ' s pay to register it . Driving_schools in Eastern Europe are quick to flunk students , who are then ordered to take another expensive course of training . One woman in the Macedonian capital , Skopje , complained she had taken a 70-hour training course 23 times and still hadn ' t earned a license . In Western Europe , the car culture is more settled , but not what it once was . As the birthplace of Rolls-Royce , Bentley , Jaguar and Land Rover , Britain was a crucible of the automotive world . But Jaguar is now owned by Ford ; GM controls Vauxhall ; BMW recently bought Rover , and German wooing of Rolls-Royce and Bentley continues . &quot; With Rover gone , there are now no mass-production British car_manufacturers under British ownership , &quot; noted Phil Llewellin , an automotive critic for London ' s Independent newspaper . &quot; More and more these days , when I write_about the great traditions of British sports_cars , I ' m writing_about Bentleys winning at Le Mans , and that was decades before I was born. &quot; Only a cottage sports-car industry remains , he says , one that includes such handcrafting companies as Griffith-TVR , Caterham and Morgan , with its work_force of elderly artisans &quot; happily turning_out about 1.75 cars a week. &quot; Peculiarly British is the company car . More_than 60 % of the automobiles in Britain are registered to companies that dispense them to ranking employees as perks . &quot; That way , you can be seen in a 3-Series BMW that otherwise you could never afford , &quot; said Gordon Bruce , a London automotive publicist . &quot; It relates to keeping_up with the Joneses as an unspoken statement of your position and worth . People will actually work harder to get a better company car , because it ' s worth more as an outside symbol than a raise. &quot; Despite this vanity , there are no vanity plates in Britain . If luck of issuance produces a plate that might make a statement for someone , commerce flourishes . A recent advertisement listed for_sale plate &quot; 1 BW. &quot; If your name is Bertie Witherspoon or you are the CEO of British Wedgwood , the plate would be a steal . For $ 27 # 750 . In Latin_America , Asia and the Middle_East , the car culture is as strong as in the automotive heartlands . Brand loyalty to Ford is almost a faith in Argentina . The manufacturer established a subsidiary there in 1913 , rose to claim 43 % of the market and saw its distributorships become community institutions . &quot; They say in the interior that there was the church , the army and the Ford distributorship , &quot; noted Rodolfo Ceretti , a Ford executive in Argentina . Ford ' s Falcon was prince of the pampas . It won stock_car championships in a country whose national torch has been held high by racing immortals Juan Manuel Fangio and Carlos Reutemann . Almost half a_million Falcons were manufactured in Argentina from 1961 to 1991 . Now , Argentina has a new love . The Ford Escort , naturally . India , a nation of 900 million people , is served by fewer than 2.5 million cars . Vast numbers of Indians have never been inside an automobile . Within the middle-class precincts of Delhi , Bombay and Bangalore , automobiles are a home-grown parade of oddities . One is the cockroach-shaped , peppy but fragile Maruti 800 . There ' s the Contessa Classic , the marriage of a British-built Vauxhall and an Isuzu engine . And the Ambassador , patterned on a 1950s Morris Oxford and the limousine of choice for India ' s elite . But a new era approaches . Duties on imports are being reduced . Alliances are forming -- among them Hindustan Motors with General Motors , Premier Automobiles with Peugeot -- that will put the country on new wheels . In the Middle_East , old , not new , is in . The Gaza Strip , for instance , is a place of neglected and potholed roads , of the promise of autonomy in the ongoing peace talks with Israel . The strip ' s two auto dealerships closed_in 1967 , casualties of that year ' s Arab-Israeli War . In this battered territory , the king of the car cult for 900 # 000 largely poor Arabs is the Peugeot 404 , the older the better . &quot; The car is like us -- tough , reliable and strong , &quot; said taxi driver Kamal Abu Hlail . * The weekly Souk Sayarat -- which takes_place on a dirt field that doubles as a soccer pitch -- is Gaza ' s only used-car market . It forms each Saturday and is filled with scores of Peugeot 404s in varying states of proud decay . &quot; In our situation , you can ' t own a better car , &quot; noted another owner . &quot; It ' ll take you anywhere . Anyone can fix it . And it ' s a lot faster than a donkey. &quot; In Israel , the standard_of_living is rising , and the automobile is along for the ride . The number of cars at the end of 1992 was up 9 % from 1991 . And fatal_accidents have increased accordingly . Each country is distinct in the world of autos , and some present surprises . * For all its power as a big-time automobile producer , Japan is in the minors when it comes_to enjoying cars . There are few freeways . Tokyo is a city of 12 million people built to handle half that number , and traffic is bumper to bumper . But despite the relative lack of room to move_around , interest in four-wheel-drive vehicles and camper vans is growing . Commercial parks have opened where owners of 4WD vehicles can enjoy off-road travel without leaving cities . &quot; Five years ago , we never had RV shows , &quot; commented businessman and car enthusiast Hiroshi Soma . &quot; Now , so many people want to go see camping shows. &quot; * France is also a country with a new affection for sports utility vehicles and campers -- and a nation choking on vehicles , with 1.6 million cars competing each day for Paris ' 1.3 million parking_spaces . Traffic_jams cost the city $ 300 million a year in wasted gasoline , particularly irritating when gas costs $ 3.50 a gallon . In response , scooters and motorcycles are replacing Renaults and Citroens in French affections . A recent study showed that 85 % of all scooter riders are executives who live_in cities . And in Paris , cycles and scooters are considered bon chic , bon genre . Rough translation : preppy . * In Italy , the birthplace of Ferrari , Lamborghini and Maserati , sales of designer sports_cars are flopping , with fewer on the streets than are seen abroad . Although Italy is now one of the richer countries in the world -- its gross_national_product exceeds all Latin_America ' s -- scarred and battle-wise subcompact cars are a family norm . * Brazil , another nation famous for world racing champions -- Emerson Fittipaldi , Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna -- is slightly infamous as one of only two countries -- the other is Mexico -- still building Volkswagen Beetles . Credit President Itamar Franco , a self-styled man of the people , who publicly swore affection for the enduring people ' s car and urged its return . Last summer , the Beetle was back in production in Brazil . There was an early frenzy of sales , but it hasn ' t lasted . Beetles priced at $ 7 # 000 currently are piling_up at dealerships . Yet if there is one icon among all_the automotive idolatry , it is the Beetle . Demanded by Adolf Hitler , designed by Porsche , the historic little car has remained in production somewhere in the world for more_than half a century . Twenty-one million Beetles have sold , for a world_record . That is 5 million units more_than Henry_Ford ' s Model T . Who knows ? One day they might stuff a Beetle into a time_capsule .</TEXT>
