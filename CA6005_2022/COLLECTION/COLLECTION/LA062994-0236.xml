   <HEADLINE> DOMESTIC VIOLENCE GUN BILL GAINS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Senate has passed , on 22-12 vote , and sent to the Assembly a bill that would require gun owners in certain domestic violence cases to relinquish their firearms , at least temporarily . The bill by Sen . Gary K . Hart ( D-Santa Barbara ) would extend the current prohibition against buying a gun for the duration of a domestic violence restraining order to firearms already in possession of the person named in the order . Hart said that under existing law people who are subject_to protective orders issued in domestic violence cases cannot buy or receive firearms while the orders are in_effect . However , the restriction does not apply to guns already in possession of the individual . The bill would empower a court to apply the restriction to firearms owned by the individual if the judge found that further violent acts involving guns were likely . The guns could be ordered to be relinquished for the duration of the restraining order .</TEXT>
