   <TEXT> * Re &quot; Learn a Language ? It ' s Elementary , &quot; Nov . 11 : When inner-city children as young as 6 years old are learning to speak Chinese , Japanese and Russian , why are we spending millions of dollars in sorely needed tax_revenues to translate everything into Spanish for our Latino population ? JOE BRAZAN SR . Chino Hills * The article dealing with the success of the Marvin Avenue Language Magnet Center in teaching English-speaking children a foreign language seems to indicate that this is the approach that should be used in teaching English to our non-English-speaking children . I believe it is universally accepted that the optimum time to efficiently learn a foreign language is from ages to 7 years . Why then do we persist_in placing children in classes where they are taught in their native tongue ( usually Spanish ) , and missing out on utilizing the years where they could learn English so easily ?
