   <HEADLINE> JAPAN ALLUDES TO NON-BINDING TRADE TARGETS ; ASIA : HOSOKAWA AIDE SAYS SUCH GOALS COULD WIN APPROVAL , HEADING OFF MORE CONFLICT WITH THE U.S.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ichiro Ozawa , chief strategist of Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa ' s coalition , suggested Tuesday that Japan could accept non-binding targets in its trade with the United States instead of the specific goals , backed by the threat of sanctions , that Washington is demanding . Without elaborating , Ozawa flatly predicted that the U.S.-Japan trade &quot; problem will be brought_to a conclusion next month. &quot; Ozawa , the No . 2 leader and policy-maker of the Japan Renewal Party , made his comments at a news_conference with foreign correspondents . &quot; Accepting numerical goals to be implemented by the government is , indeed , managed trade , &quot; he said , referring to the practice of government dictating to private industry . &quot; However , if you are talking_about mutual goals for efforts , that ' s not a bad thing. &quot; At a Feb . 11 Clinton-Hosokawa summit in Washington , the Japanese officials rejected U.S. demands , saying that setting specific goals for reduction of Japan ' s trade surplus with the United States would be undesirable . The failure to achieve agreement in Washington raised the specter of a tit-for-tat trade war . But since Hosokawa ' s return to Japan , his government has been discussing ways to encourage more American imports , thereby cutting Japan ' s trade surplus . * And despite the lack of formal negotiations , Ozawa ' s comments , coming from a key powerbroker in the coalition , reflect a continuing Japanese effort at compromise . In Washington , a spokesman for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative said the agency had no immediate comment on Ozawa ' s statement . Ozawa blamed the impasse at the Washington summit on a mixture of the United States ' &quot; incorrect &quot; insistence on numerical targets and Hosokawa ' s troubles at_home in winning approval for a historic political reform plan . The prime_minister , he explained , did not have enough time to make domestic &quot; political adjustments &quot; before he met Clinton . &quot; Once this problem is taken_care of , Hosokawa ' s leadership will become very firm , and Japan-U.S. adjustments will become possible , &quot; Ozawa said . Any economic damage Japan might suffer from U.S. sanctions would &quot; not amount to much &quot; in the near term , he said . Nonetheless , Ozawa warned that any U.S. resort_to sanctions would &quot; only stir_up nationalism in both countries. &quot; He added : &quot; America must_not carry_out sanctions -- unless it intends to destroy Japan and once more repeat the history of U.S.-Japan relations. &quot;</TEXT>
