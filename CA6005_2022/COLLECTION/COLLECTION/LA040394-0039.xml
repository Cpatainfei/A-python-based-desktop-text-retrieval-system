   <HEADLINE> ENDPAPERS : STICKS AND STONES ; CAN A REVIEW BE SO BAD IT IS LIBELOUS ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; It is safe to assume , &quot; John Leonard , a former editor of the New York Times Book_Review , has written , &quot; that every writer has read every word of every review , and will never forgive you. &quot; Bill Henderson made Leonard ' s comment the epigraph to his &quot; Rotten Reviews : A Literary Companion &quot; ( Pushcart Press : 1986 ) , a collection in which , as Anthony Brandt wrote in the introduction , &quot; one of the pleasures . . . is watching the great being terribly wrong about the great &quot; : Zola about Baudelaire , Stein about Pound , Emerson about Austen , Shaw about Shakespeare , and on and on . If slightly malicious humor is the chief pleasure of the collection , its chief reassurance is that literary virtue seems to triumph in the end . But does_it , always ? Near the end of his introduction , Brandt calls the cackling to a brief halt with the following thought : &quot; All of this has a serious side . . . . Rotten reviews hurt , for one thing : And if they don ' t , perhaps , affect sales , they do affect literary reputations , which , as most authors will agree , are more important than sales in the end. &quot; Cold comfort it must be to a writer to be told to trust the marketplace of ideas if by the time the marketplace renders its judgment the writer is long since dead or ruined . Can there be no earlier redress of genuine grievance ? If a final_judgment must be left to the ages , can a timelier intervention at least rescue a career ? Until recently , the answer would clearly have been negative . But now an aggrieved writer has brought suit against the New York Times Book_Review . If he has his way , the face of book_reviewing in this country may change . On Sept . 3 , 1989 , the New York Times Book_Review published a review of &quot; Interference : How Organized Crime Influences Professional_Football &quot; ( William Morrow ) by Dan E . Moldea , a journalist specializing in organized_crime . The review alleged a string of factual errors in the book and closed : &quot; There may well be some insidious connection between the wise_guys and the NFL . Then again , there may_not . ' Interference , ' with its errors and unfounded insinuations , does not settle the issue . Mr. Moldea raises the questions , but has blunted his own sword of truth. &quot; Four days later , Moldea wrote the reviewer , Gerald Eskenazi , a New York Times sportswriter , charging that Eskenazi had seriously misreported what Moldea had written . Eskenazi ' s errors about the book amounted to libel against the book ' s author , Moldea said , and he demanded &quot; a full and prompt retraction. &quot; Otherwise , he promised to &quot; take legal steps to remedy this situation , which has already caused tremendous illegal and unfair damage to my reputation and economic harm to my book. &quot; On Nov . 15 , 1989 , having failed to win a retraction or other correction , Moldea wrote a letter of about 750 words to Rebecca Sinkler , editor of the New York Times Book_Review , refuting five alleged errors in the review by quoting from the book . For example : &quot; Charge : Leading the reader to believe that I claimed that Super Bowl III in 1969 was fixed , Eskenazi wrote that I charged that there was something premeditated and ' sinister ' about a meeting in a Miami bar between ( New York Jets quarterback Joe ) Namath and Baltimore Colts place-kicker Lou Michaels during the week before the game . He added that I failed to point_out that the meeting ' almost came_to blows. ' &quot; Response : This is not true . I wrote in the second paragraph on page 197 : ' ( Lou ) Michaels told me that the meeting at a Miami bar / restaurant was quite accidental and even confrontational. ' Michaels ' statement was corroborated during my interview with Jets ' player Jim Hudson , who accompanied Namath to the bar . Further , I never claimed that the 1969 Super Bowl was fixed . To the contrary , I produced evidence on pages 194 and 198-99 discrediting the theory by Colts ' player Bubba Smith that it was. &quot; When the Times declined to publish this letter , Moldea sued -- unsuccessfully : On Jan . 31 , 1992 , U.S. District Court Judge Garrett Penn granted summary_judgment in favor of the Times . On Feb . 17 , 1994 , however , a three-judge U.S. appeals court reinstated Moldea ' s lawsuit by a 2-1 vote . Summary_judgment , as in the earlier ruling , is granted when the facts of a case are not in_dispute and a decision may be rendered on the law alone . On appeal , Moldea claimed that the facts were indeed in_dispute -- not the facts about Super Bowl III , it must be noted , but the facts about what Moldea said about Super Bowl III . To sustain his appeal , the court had to find not just that these facts were in_dispute , but that it mattered that they were in_dispute . This is just what the appeals court did find . Its opinion states with_regard_to one of Moldea ' s several charges : &quot; The clear implication of the review passage is that Moldea , either through incompetence or an intent to mislead , suggests that the meeting was ' sinister. ' This is an essentially factual claim -- either ' Interference ' so describes the meeting or it does not. &quot; The judges note that the New York Times &quot; attempted to demonstrate that the disputed passages in Moldea ' s book do_in fact describe a ' sinister ' meeting . However , arguing that the characterizations offered in the review are correct is not the same as contending that they are non-verifiable -- indeed , it is precisely the opposite. &quot; Can an Opinion Be False ? In 1990 , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled_in Milkovich vs . Lorain Journal that even statements of opinion can be libelous if they contain &quot; false and defamatory &quot; facts . Until Moldea vs . New York Times , however , no one had claimed that a negative statement about a book could , by implication , constitute a &quot; false and defamatory &quot; statement about the book ' s author . It is the novelty of this claim that may yet make the Moldea case one of historic importance for American book_reviewing . At issue , obviously , is the extent to which every book_review must also be a report on the facts of the book . If a reviewer gets those facts wrong , can the review be not just negative but also demonstrably false ? And depending_on the mistakes made , can a review be defamatory in its effect on the author ? Eskenazi wrote_of Moldea ' s book that &quot; there is too_much sloppy journalism to trust the bulk of this book ' s 512 pages , &quot; a statement Moldea regarded_as falsely bringing his reputation for accuracy into question . Chief Judge Abner Mikva , dissenting from the decision of the appeals court , disagreed_with Moldea : &quot; If the statement that Mr. Moldea wrote a sloppy book is defamatory , so would be a statement that Bette Midler wore a sloppy dress , or that Oliver Stone made a sloppy film. &quot; But Judge Harry Edwards , writing for the majority , agreed with the plaintiff at least to_the_point of recognizing the question as legitimate : &quot; Although sloppy in a vacuum may be difficult to quantify , the term has obvious , measurable aspects when applied to the field of investigative journalism , just as the term clumsy would with a brain surgeon. &quot; At issue , clearly , is the question of whether Eskenazi ' s characterization of the book -- &quot; sloppy journalism &quot; -- was based on demonstrably erroneous reporting . Mikva also argues the majority_opinion is &quot; unwise . . . to ignore altogether the effect of the communicative vehicle upon the audience. &quot; The dissenting judge maintains that readers will understand that a report coming_in a book_review is not to be taken with the same seriousness as a report elsewhere . The Washington Post in an unsigned editorial Feb . 24 took the same tack , defending the New York Times by citing a 1984 case in which the court observed : &quot; It is_well understood that editorial writers and commentators frequently resort_to the type of caustic bombast traditionally used . . . to stimulate public reaction. &quot; The Post comments : &quot; We were not thrilled by this description . . . but we were relieved that the distinction between facts and opinions was maintained. &quot; Correcting the Record Just what sort of responsibility to the facts does a book reviewer or other opinion writer incur ? Judge Mikva agrees with his two colleagues that &quot; it would be unwise ' to craft a rule that permitted otherwise libelous statements to go unchecked so_long as they appeared in certain sacrosanct genres. ' &quot; Very well : How is even this level of responsibility to be enforced ? The duty to refrain_from false or defamatory statements cannot , obviously , require journalists to be infallible . An innocent mistake may always be corrected , and most publications -- newspapers , in particular -- correct errors far more quickly and prominently nowadays than they once did . An author ' s intent in_demanding a correction , however , may be simply to discredit a review . There is always a decision to be made by the editor about when a retraction is in_order ( for the correction of factual error ) , when a letter to the editor should be printed ( for a statement of differing opinion or interpretation ) , or when no action is necessary . A letter , though it may also serve as correction , may be discounted by readers as an aggrieved author ' s opinion , which is precisely why many authors find this remedy deficient . Moldea has stated for the record that if the New York Times Book_Review had published his letter , not an overlong one by prevailing standards , he would not have sued . Times counsel George Freeman confirmed that the Times knew this but declined to publish the letter anyway , on principle , finding its charges baseless . Rebecca Sinkler further explained that the New York Times Book_Review seeks to protect reviewers from authors ' bias just as it protects authors from reviewers ' bias . Late in 1991 , Moldea asked the National Book Critics Circle to take a public position in support of his suit . I was president of the NBCC at the time and forwarded his request to the NBCC board , a body of 24 book editors and free-lance critics . I also spoke_to George Freeman and Rebecca Sinkler at that time so as_to be able to present their side of the dispute to the NBCC board . After much consideration , the board decided to take no position on the_matter . Thinking as reviewers faced with the prospect of future litigation if their work struck an author as defamatory , some on the board tacitly sided with the New York Times , which had written in its brief : &quot; It is not unreasonable to expect that if Moldea ' s lawsuit is permitted to continue , critics may become timid . For the threat posed by protracted and expensive litigation surely will encourage reviewers to ' steer far wider ' of dangerous zones . . . . To the extent that criticism becomes flannel-mouthed or perfunctory , all_of us , authors included , are impoverished. &quot; Others on the board , perhaps thinking_of their vulnerability as authors to essentially unaccountable reviewers , tacitly sided with Moldea , who claims : &quot; If I win this case , the worst that can happen is that reviewers and other opinion-writers will suddenly have a responsibility to be accountable for what they write . Any writer who cannot live with that should not be in this profession. &quot; Unlike the NBCC , however , the court must decide between these contending positions . The New York Times has asked the entire 15-judge appeals court to review the decision made by three of its members . If it affirms the three judges ' decision , then the case will be remanded to the district court for rehearing , this time before a jury . If the jury finds that Moldea has suffered libel , a further determination must then be made as_to whether he deserves the $ 10 million he seeks in punitive damages . At this point , his case will require a judgment about the power of even an uncorrected , defamatory review in the New York Times Book_Review to destroy a book . If the three judges ' opinion is overruled , Moldea says he will appeal_to the U.S. Supreme Court . Moldea alleges that after Eskenazi ' s review and , even more , after he brought suit , publishers were loath to consider his work , afraid to be_on the wrong side of a newspaper that could do so_much harm or good to their future products . This is even more difficult to quantify ; but before this case has come_to its conclusion , this too may be debated in open court , and much of literary America may be hanging_on every word .</TEXT>
