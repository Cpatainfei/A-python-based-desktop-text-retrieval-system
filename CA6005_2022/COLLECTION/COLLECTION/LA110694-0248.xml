   <HEADLINE> OBITUARIES ; SAMUEL FRANCIS , 71 ; FAMED ARTIST AND PHILANTHROPIST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Samuel Lewis Francis , an internationally acclaimed artist known for his exuberant , spiritually charged abstractions , died late Friday night of complications from cancer at St . John ' s Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica . One of a handful of famed Abstract Expressionists to be based in Southern California , Francis was 71 , said a spokeswoman for the Litho Shop , the printmaking facility he established in Santa Monica for his work . Renowned on three continents , his oeuvre combined aspects of Eastern philosophy and Western science in paintings that exude spontaneous energy . Although known and respected in such world capitals as Paris and Tokyo , Francis opted to spend most of his final three decades in the Los Angeles area , where he painted , made prints , published books , planned exhibitions and engaged in philanthropies . Among the latter was the Museum of Contemporary Art in Downtown Los Angeles , where he was a founding trustee and a member of the board of trustees until 1989 . Last year he donated 10 of his paintings to the Museum of Contemporary Art , including some of his major works from 1951 to 1992 . It marked the largest single gift to MOCA from an artist in the museum ' s history . At the time , Francis was hailed as &quot; the heart of MOCA , &quot; by Frederick Nicholas , chairman emeritus of the museum board.. Although famous for his own artwork , Francis pursued many diverse interests , including the Lapis Press , which he established in 1984 to publish books combining art with poetry , philosophy and psychology . He also established the Sam Francis Medical Research_Center , a foundation for research in communicable and environmental diseases . Until his health began to fail , Francis not only remained at his easel but maintained a lifestyle that included frequent marriages and admitted overindulgences in food and drink . &quot; I ' m a spender . I spend myself , &quot; Francis told The Times in 1991 , three years after his 1957-58 work &quot; Towards Disappearance &quot; brought $ 1.3 million at auction . At one time he had no less than six shows on view or in_progress , including one in Paris titled &quot; Sam Francis : 40 Years of Friendship &quot; honoring the artist ' s long relationship with Swiss dealer Eberhard Kornfeld , who continues to represent him . Times art critic William Wilson once called Francis ' work &quot; completely nontheoretical. &quot; &quot; He splashed color orgiastically in blobs , rivulets or circular shapes resembling burst bubbles , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; Encountered singly , Francis ' graphics -- mainly lithographs -- are physically and emotionally cathartic , like fantasies of making_love floating in midair or taking a cool shower in_colored fireworks . &quot; Except , &quot; Wilson continued , &quot; they actually never call_up direct associations to any experience other_than themselves . . . . Always the same and always changing , suggesting an art of graded moods . . . . &quot; Francis , whose works are in public collections in more_than 40 museums in the United States , Canada , Europe and Japan and who was one of 16 American painters chosen to design posters for the 1984 Olympics , was born in San Mateo in Northern California . His father was a mathematics professor and his mother a pianist and French_teacher who captivated her son with her supposed clairvoyant powers . Francis started a premed course at UC Berkeley in 1941 but dropped_out in 1943 to join the U.S. Army Air Corps . He suffered an in-flight injury leading to spinal tuberculosis and started painting while a patient in a succession of veterans hospitals . In 1945 , while at Ft . Miley Veterans Administration Hospital in San Francisco , he met David Park , an expressionistic figure painter and teacher at the California School of Fine_Arts in San Francisco . Park took an interest in Francis ' work , which at the time consisted_of portraits and landscapes , and acquainted him with the genius of Picasso , Joan Miro and Paul Klee . Upon Francis ' recovery , he returned to UC Berkeley , but this time as an art major . In 1950 , he went_to Paris to study and married for the first time . It was there two years later that he had his first one-man show , at the Galerie du Dragon . Critics praised the monochromatic white paintings , some measuring 10 feet . Francis remarried after a divorce in 1960 and traveled between Paris , Bern and Tokyo , but fell ill with tuberculosis of the kidney and returned to the United States , where he convalesced in Santa Barbara . In 1962 , he set_up shop in Santa Monica but continued to maintain studios in Japan and Europe . In 1965 , he married for the third time after another divorce two years earlier . Over the last two decades he was to accumulate honors almost as rapidly as he produced paintings . In 1985 , he married artist Margaret Smith . In addition to her , he is survived by four children . Funeral service information is available through the Litho Shop , ( 310 ) 828-0792 . Times staff writer Burt A . Folkart contributed to this obituary .</TEXT>
