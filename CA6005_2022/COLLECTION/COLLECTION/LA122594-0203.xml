   <HEADLINE> THE FALLING PESO SHOWS LIMITS OF TECHNOCRATS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Was there in Mexico anything more foreign for the American tourist than the marketplace ? The lovely piece of pottery had a price_tag of 500 pesos . But the price was negotiable -- that , as the guide book told us , was the distinguishing thing about Mexico for the American tourist . With a wink or a shrug , quien sabe ? &quot; For you , senor , 400 pesos. &quot; Last week , Mexico ' s President Ernesto Zedillo shocked the international financial markets , astonished especially his trading partners in Ottawa and Washington , by allowing the Mexican_peso to float against the U.S. dollar . Mexico is a country of secrets and shadows . Rumors in Mexico_City at week ' s end were that the devaluation crisis was the result of conflicts within Zedillo ' s own ruling party , the Institutional Revolutionary Party . Others in the capital claimed that the government has been under pressure from the south -- the continuing Indian rebellion in Chiapas . Indeed , the Zapatista rebels were_on the move last week . But if Mexico has lately been the scene of insurrections and political assassinations , Mexico also is a country of new shopping_malls . Since the North_American Free_Trade Agreement was signed last year , millions of Mexicans have been charging their way into the First World , buying everything they saw at Wal-Mart , transforming Mexico ' s trade surplus with the United States into a huge trade_deficit . The United States had been counting_on a new postwar generation of Mexican politicians , the Ivy League-trained &quot; technocrats , &quot; to hold Mexico together . Yes , America recognized that there were baroque aspects of Mexico that we knew_nothing about . Yes , we knew there were political intrigues and layers of corruption that were hidden by shadows . But we trusted the technocrats . Harvard-educated Carlos Salinas de Gortari was the first of the new generation . His successor , Zedillo , is a Yale-trained economist . We Americans thought that because we educated these Mexicans , we could count_on them to play by our rules . Octavio Paz , the eminent poet-philosopher of Mexico , has for a longer_time been writing_about the masks behind which Mexicans hide and the corridors of her ancient labyrinth . Mexico , along with Russia , never had an 18th Century , Paz wrote prophetically a_few years ago . Last week , Mexicans told me that what the devaluation proved was that Zedillo was more concerned with national politics than with his reputation in the international financial markets . There were forces at play in the Mexican_capital that outsiders did not understand . Finally , Zedillo belongs_to Mexico_City more_than to Yale_University . In recent months , American optimism was fed by the spectacular performance of stocks like Telefonos de Mexico . At week ' s end , Telefonos had fallen sharply . Critics of NAFTA in the United States are now quick to say that Mexico is an unreliable trading partner . Pro-NAFTA forces feel betrayed . Clearly , what is needed is a moderate course between the I-told-you-so negativity of the NAFTA opponents and the boom-years optimism of those Americans who thought they could make a killing in Mexico . Mexico and Russia are essential economic partners of the United States . And it is in our interest to want their experiment in free-market democracy to succeed . But Mexico , like Russia , is lurching toward the 21st Century absent an 18th Century -- the great age of democracy and capitalism . Both countries are more medieval than the professors at the Harvard Business_School , with their case-study methods , care to believe . In the dusty mercado , you did business over time . You got_to know your trading partner . You got_to understand the way his body communicated . You understood his smile . You understood his handshake . What was clear last week is that it will take time for us to understand our Mexican trading partner . But for the United States , as for Mexico , there is no turning_back . We find ourselves in the same labyrinth -- in the same dusty marketplace , haggling over the piece of pottery with a price_tag of 500 pesos .</TEXT>
