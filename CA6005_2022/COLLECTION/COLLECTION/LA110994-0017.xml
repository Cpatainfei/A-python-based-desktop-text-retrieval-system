   <HEADLINE> THEATER REVIEW ; ' HOLLYWOOD HONEYMOON ' : A GAY FARCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In many farces , a man schemes to bed his mistress , but the plot gets_in the way . In &quot; Hollywood Honeymoon , &quot; Tom Jacobson ' s new farce at Celebration Theatre in Hollywood , the hero does everything he can to avoid sex -- with a woman . Warr Acres ( Colin Gray ) , action star , has a pathological fear of female breasts . This could spell trouble for his macho image , as would his affair with a male publicist . What he needs is a good cover , which comes_in the form of marriage to Fionna Keane ( Ericka Klein ) , a lesbian British actress . Jacobson has chosen an apt target . Even now , 25 years into the gay rights movement , one senses a noxious hypocrisy when it comes_to homosexuality in show_business . How many celebrities , gay and bisexual , have toasted their mythic marriages for the sake of a nice spread in People magazine ? Yet &quot; Hollywood Honeymoon &quot; only partly satisfies . Jacobson , a shrewd student of the genre , has borrowed the well-known staples from Feydeau and other farceurs : manic entrances and exits , mistaken identities , speech impediments , the suggestion of illicit sex and the crushing fear of exposure . The play is set_in a cabin in the Sierra_Nevadas , where Acres and Keane have repaired after their hastily arranged nuptials . In tow are Acres ' lover Gene Maxwell ( Noel Alumit ) and Keane ' s lover Lane Johnson ( Coley Sohn ) . Bent_on exposing the sham is Armada DeLongpre ( Rende Rae Norman ) , a tabloid-TV host looking_for a sleazy scandal to boost her ratings . Antics ensue , some funny , others wan and strained . DeLongpre hires a hustler ( the guileless Donald Fowler ) as bait for Acres , but the kid turns_out to be a hilariously inept virgin . Except for a flat beginning and end , the structure is efficient and workmanlike . But given such a juicy topic , Jacobson ' s wit is disappointingly mild and mainstream . Too often jokes are cobbled_together using gay cliches ( Judy Garland , &quot; All About Eve &quot; ) , yielding a smug , provincial tone . Robert Schrock directs with amiable , offhand panache , though he would be wise_to find a way to speed_up the action . The cast , meanwhile , seems far too tentative , though this too may be corrected before this &quot; Honeymoon &quot; is over . * &quot; Hollywood Honeymoon , &quot; Celebration Theatre , 7051 Santa Monica Blvd. , Hollywood . Thursdays-Sundays , 8 p.m. ; Sundays , 2 p.m. Ends Dec . 18 . $ 15- $ 20 . ( 213 ) 660-8587 . Running time : 1 hour , 45 minutes .</TEXT>
