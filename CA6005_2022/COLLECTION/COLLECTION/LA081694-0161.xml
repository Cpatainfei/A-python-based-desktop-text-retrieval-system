   <HEADLINE> CRITICS OF HEALTH REFORM RAISE BUGBEAR OF BUREAUCRACY ; DEBATE : OPPONENTS ARE DRAWING ORWELLIAN IMAGES OF RED_TAPE AND FACELESS FEDERAL WORKERS . THE FEAR TACTIC COULD KILL ANY BILL , ANALYSTS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The naked shoulder belongs_to a vulnerable-looking patient . It is framed by the reassuring hands of a physician . There ' s nothing subtle about the ad . Intimacy was what the American Medical Assn . sought to convey . And its message is clear : Would you rather trust your life to a doctor or to some government bureaucrat or insurance adjuster ? As the debate over health_care reform nears a climax in Congress , opponents of comprehensive reform , including many Senate Republicans , are increasingly exploiting the public fear of a proliferating bureaucracy . And for good reason . Americans have always been leery of burgeoning red_tape and bloated government . And their concerns have risen sharply as the debate has unfolded . President Clinton ' s now-discarded plan would have created a vast array of government_agencies with broad new powers , such_as allowing the Treasury_secretary to impose a payroll tax on all employers in any state . Even most of the less ambitious reform plans , including the one being debated in the Senate , would necessitate the creation of numerous state and federal agencies -- to enforce new rules designed to extend coverage to the estimated 39 million uninsured Americans . &quot; There ' s a bureaucratic cost to doing these things , &quot; said Drew Altman , president of the Kaiser Family Foundation , a Menlo Park , Calif. , health_care philanthropy and think-tank . Indeed new government bureaucracies will be an inevitable byproduct of any successful effort to seriously reconfigure what is one-seventh of the U.S. economy . Yet the nation ' s health_care system is already burdened by the administrative imperatives of the 1 # 500 private insurance_companies now doing business , with clerks minutely examining reimbursement claims and sometimes determining in_advance whether a particular medical procedure is permissible . Any reform of the U.S. health_care system probably will substitute public bureaucrats for private ones . That leaves a particularly knotty question : Can government_agencies carry_out their duties -- such_as ensuring that subsidies reach the needy -- without becoming the intrusive force that the AMA and the public fear ? Unless such concerns can be allayed , the public ' s deeply ingrained fear of an uncaring bureaucracy could kill health_care reform , analysts said . &quot; It ' s a huge issue because ' bureaucracy ' and accusations that a plan is a ' big government ' plan have become almost nuclear_weapons , &quot; Altman said . &quot; And critics have been tremendously successful in instilling fear and skepticism about the government ' s ability to reform the health_care system. &quot; Hardly_a day goes_by now in the Senate without a member producing a multicolored chart to demonstrate the complexities of the plan crafted by Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell ( D-Me. ) . Mitchell himself went_on the Senate floor Monday to rebut his critics , saying : &quot; My bill does not provide_for a government-run health_insurance system . It is a voluntary system , which builds_on the private insurance market. &quot; Rhetoric aside , those with alternatives to the President ' s agenda are discovering -- as Clinton already has learned -- that any significant overhaul of the health_care system will require a certain amount of new government initiatives . The hardest challenge is that of providing subsidies to the needy . Clinton had proposed requiring employers to pay at least 80 % of a worker ' s premiums , with the individual paying the rest . His plan called_for subsidies for small firms with low average payrolls . But because of a firestorm of opposition to the 80 % employer mandate , Mitchell would delay the mandate until 2002 -- and require only a 50 % premium contribution from employers with 26 or more workers . The scaled-back mandate would be triggered only if voluntary measures based on market incentives do not achieve 95 % coverage -- and only in states that fall below the 95 % level . Nationally , about 85 % of the public is now insured . Analysts said that Mitchell ' s approach would lead to a more effective subsidy program , allowing the targeting of individuals instead of companies . But there would be a trade-off . In potentially defusing opposition to the employer mandate , Mitchell created grist for foes on another front : A greater bureaucracy would be needed to administer a subsidy program that targets individuals . Mitchell ' s bill would subsidize not only low-income people but also children and pregnant women as well as those temporarily unemployed . Some of them would be eligible for more_than one type of subsidy at_the_same_time . But , as the Congressional Budget Office recently noted , &quot; determining eligibility for subsidies would be an enormous task for states , made more complicated by the three different subsidy programs. &quot; States also would be responsible_for the annual reconciliation process in which a subsidized family ' s income is checked to ensure that it had received the appropriate funds . &quot; Tracking people who moved from one state to another during the year would also be difficult and would require extensive cooperation among the states , &quot; the CBO added . Administering subsidies would be just one of many new responsibilities required of the states by Mitchell ' s plan . In all , his proposal would create dozens of new federal and state agencies , empowered with new authority over how insurance is purchased and how medical services are delivered . Mitchell would create , to name a_few , a seven-member National Health_Care Cost and Coverage Commission to monitor trends on insurance coverage and costs , a seven-member National Health Benefits Board to define the scope of a standard benefits package , a 15-member National Quality Council to establish regional and state organizations to implement certain goals and standards , a National Council on Graduate Medical Education to set requirements to attain something of a balance between specialists and general_practitioners and 50 state Consumer Information and Advocacy Centers to gather and disseminate &quot; report_cards &quot; on health plans . States also would be required to enforce new laws that prohibit insurers from discriminating against the sick or the aged . In all , according to Sen . Dan Coats ( R-Ind. ) , who released a half-inch-thick &quot; primer &quot; on Mitchell ' s bill , it proposes 50 new bureaucracies and would impose 177 new responsibilities on states . &quot; This is . . . probably the largest expansion of government ever proposed , &quot; fumed Sen . Don Nickles ( R-Okla. ) . &quot; It ' s very complicated and very bureaucratic -- definitely a step_in the wrong direction. &quot; The CBO , a highly regarded , nonpartisan research arm of Congress , said in more neutral language that , for the system proposed by Mitchell to work effectively , &quot; new data would have to be collected , new procedures and administrative mechanisms developed and new institutions and administrative capabilities created. &quot; that ' s hardly_a vote_of_confidence in Mitchell ' s plan . And the Maine senator conceded that point when he unveiled his plan earlier this month . &quot; It requires a lot of administrative work , &quot; he said , &quot; and we don ' t know whether that can be done. &quot; But Theodore R . Marmor , a Yale professor of public policy and management , offered a different perspective . &quot; In terms of either interference with professional practice or the amount of both form-filling and administrative expense , the American health_care system is by far the most administratively complex and costly in the advanced world , while our government role is weakest. &quot; Added Edward F . Howard , executive_vice_president of the Alliance for Health Reform , a nonpartisan educational group : &quot; You have to remember the burden that current programs face and what they will look_like five years from now. &quot; He and Altman also noted that government-run health_care systems are much more efficient than those run_by the private sector . Whereas Medicare ' s administrative expenses are about 3 % and Medicaid about 5 % , they said , the comparable cost for private plans is 15 % to 30 % . &quot; Government programs are dramatically more efficient than private programs , &quot; said Howard . &quot; This is an area , &quot; Altman added , &quot; where facts and perception are at total loggerheads. &quot;</TEXT>
