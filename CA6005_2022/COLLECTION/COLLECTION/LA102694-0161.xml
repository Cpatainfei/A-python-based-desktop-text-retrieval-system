   <HEADLINE> CHARTING HIS LIFE ; COLLECTOR NAVIGATES THROUGH THE WORLD OF ANTIQUE MAPS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Robert Ross began collecting antique maps as a hobby 15 years ago , he never suspected he was charting a new career . Ross discovered these fragile , exquisitely detailed items in 1979 , when his wife gave him a map she had purchased at a small shop in Monterey . &quot; You paid $ 10 for this old piece_of_paper ? &quot; said Ross of the hand-colored , 8-by-10-inch travel map , which was neatly folded inside a wallet-sized pouch . He later learned that the map , depicting southern Italy , was made between 1720 and 1740 . Its appraised value today ? $ 300 . &quot; I will never sell it , &quot; said Ross , a retired Calabasas high_school principal , who studied history and geography at UCLA . He added that such maps are very rare . &quot; I ' ve never seen another like it. &quot; Since that first acquisition , Ross ' collection has grown enormously . With more_than 2 # 000 for_sale , he claims to be one of the largest antique map dealers on the West Coast . &quot; Collecting maps is like collecting other antiques , old books , coins and stamps , &quot; said Ross , who operates Antiquarian Maps , Prints and Related Books from his Woodland Hills home . &quot; Maps are uniquely beautiful objects. &quot; His maps date_from 1553 to 1890 . He buys some at local auctions and travels_to Europe in pursuit of others . He buys 19th Century material from New England . He also purchases maps by mail from a dealer in Paris . He buys based on scarcity , rarity and subject . Ross is especially fond of pre-1820 maps printed on handmade rag_paper , ensuring longevity . He likes their beautiful engravings of ships , sea monsters and elaborately costumed figures . The most expensive piece Ross has for_sale is an $ 8 # 000 , double-hemisphere map entitled Orbis Terrarum Nova Et Accuratissima Tabula -- Latin for A New and Accurate Map of the Whole World . It was published in Amsterdam in 1666 by a man named Pieter Goos . Ross explained that the piece ' s value is based on its fine details , some etched in real gold . The map depicts both sides of the globe , painted on a backdrop of blue_sky , with a large , elaborate sun casting golden rays throughout the background . Head winds are painted on all four corners , while colorful , human figures at the bottom depict the four seasons . Although buyers have made offers , Ross said he has yet to find anyone willing to pay the asking price . The oldest map in his collection was an oval Italian world map made in 1528 . It sold for $ 1 # 700 . More recent maps include a 1925 version of Los Angeles and Ventura counties , and a 1932 California Highway Patrol survey . Ross also carries &quot; manuscript maps , &quot; which , unlike mass-printed versions , are one-of-a-kind . An artisan would draw a manuscript map by hand , and an engraver would then copy the work to wood , copper , steel or stone , which would become the printing plate . &quot; These are fine works of geography and art , &quot; said Ross . &quot; They are original pieces -- centuries old , hand-drawn and colored. &quot; While Ross is often tempted to keep rather than sell his maps , he finds satisfaction in selling them to people who are enticed to the art of map collecting . The lure for collectors , he said , is in owning something made by individual craftsmen and artisans , who often produced them from drawings by famous explorers . Ross said ancient maps of North_America or the Western_Hemisphere are in great demand because they depict the &quot; most notorious geographical misconception of all time &quot; -- that California was an island . Many old American maps showing Pony_Express and mail routes , Native_American paths and early turnpikes also contain geographic inaccuracies . &quot; They can depict areas now lost in history , &quot; said Ross . &quot; They often show curious inaccuracies -- the result of myth and explorers ' fabrications. &quot; Ross ' advice to new map collectors is to first read a general cartographic reference_book and visit a reputable dealer in antiquarian maps . &quot; Try to determine some idea as_to what types of maps you wish to collect based on what appeals_to you , &quot; said Ross . He believes the majority of collectors are attracted to the decorative quality of early maps , while other collectors concentrate_on a particular area , such_as one ' s country , state , region or city of birth . &quot; It is a matter of personal taste , preference and how much one wishes to spend , &quot; said Ross . &quot; It ' s a fascinating hobby. &quot;</TEXT>
