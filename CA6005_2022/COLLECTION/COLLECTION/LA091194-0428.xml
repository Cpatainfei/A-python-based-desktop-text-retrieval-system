   <TEXT> &quot; Too great an importance has been given to the retinal , &quot; Marcel Duchamp told interviewer Pierre Cabanne in 1971 . &quot; Since Courbet it ' s been believed that painting is addressed to the retina -- that was everyone ' s error . Before , painting had other functions : It could be religious , philosophical , moral , but our century is completely retinal . . . . It ' s absolutely ridiculous . It has to change. &quot; Change it did . In the decade following Duchamp ' s observation , his belief that art should provoke the brain rather than please the eye came_to dominate art . Central to the key movements of the ' 70s , Minimalism and Conceptualism , this reductive idea ultimately led art to_the_point where it was in danger of dematerializing altogether . When the pendulum swings too far in one direction , there ' s nothing left but for it to hurtle pell-mell the other way -- which brings us to Pattern and Decoration , a shamelessly optical school of Postmodernist painting that had a healthy run in the late ' 70s . &quot; Modernism was an attempt to refine , define and streamline ; Postmodernism is about stepping outside boundaries , allowing other voices in , and recognizing daily life , &quot; observes San Diego-based artist Kim MacConnel , a key figure in the Pattern and Decoration school , whose first L.A. exhibition in seven years , &quot; Age of Plastic , &quot; opened Saturday at Thomas Solomon ' s Garage . ( A related body_of_work also goes_on view Friday at the Quint Gallery in San Diego. ) &quot; Minimalism , the reigning Modernist style when I was coming of_age as an artist , ruled life out -- there was no room for it in that work -- and I saw Pattern and Decoration , which uses Third_World motifs and images from everyday life , as a means of breaking_down the hermeticism of the New York school . Unfortunately , that strategy led to my being labeled kitsch and a cultural imperialist , &quot; he adds with a laugh . MacConnel ' s work has been called kitsch , along with several other less than laudatory things , over the course of his career . Dismissed as &quot; the worst kind of exploitation &quot; by Arts Magazine critic Gretchen Faust , as &quot; solely visual work that offers nothing to sustain the viewers ' interest &quot; by Elizabeth Hayt-Atkins in Art News , MacConnel ' s art has been largely read in terms of its relationship to the decorative arts , which have occupied a debased position in the avant-garde for decades . Picking_up on the political subtext in MacConnel ' s art , however , critic Douglas Blau describes him as &quot; a hawk masquerading as a parrot , &quot; which seems closer to the artist ' s intention ; the visual cacophony MacConnel whips_up in his work is tethered to a foundation of ideas rigorous enough to have warranted his being included in five Whitney Biennials between 1975-85 . Assaulting the viewer with a riotous melange of color and shape , MacConnel tosses subtlety -- the central tenet of &quot; good taste &quot; -- out the window ( he even went so far as_to make a series of flocked paintings ) . At the heart of all his work is the notion of patterning -- simple forms repeated at measured intervals . Favoring harlequin patterns , oversize polka_dots and bold stripes , MacConnel points_out that &quot; repetition essentially functions as a grid , which is the basis of everything from maps to the printed page. &quot; Layered onto these patterns are elements of folk_art , Chinese script , funk , space_age motifs a la &quot; The Jetsons , &quot; tribal fetishes , Pop and , most importantly , the decorative arts ( fabric , furniture and rug design , for instance ) . MacConnel might be loathe to admit it , but his work is part of a visually lush tradition that ' s always thrived on the West Coast , and stretches from European masters such_as Matisse , to L.A. artists like Sam Francis and Billy Al Bengston . * Meeting with the 47-year-old artist on a Sunday morning in his studio at UC San Diego , where he has been chairman of the art_department since last year , one encounters an easygoing man who speaks openly about his life while managing to remain decidedly private . He ' s not the sort to bare his soul to the press . Dressed in shorts and a T-shirt , unlaced purple sneakers and no socks , MacConnel is a surfer and he looks the part -- he ' s fit , energetic and tan . His studio is orderly and clean , despite the fact that the center of the room is dominated by a colorful mound of trash , much of which will be recycled into the body_of_work currently occupying him ; &quot; Age of Plastic &quot; is composed of approximately 100 small clowns fashioned out of debris scavenged on beaches here and abroad . Traveling is central to MacConnel ' s life , and has been since he was very young . &quot; I was born in Oklahoma -- my father was a geology student at the University of Oklahoma -- and shortly after I was born my parents moved to Chicago because my father transferred to a school there , &quot; he recalls . &quot; Not long after that my father wound_up being a hospitalized alcoholic , my parents divorced and my mother , my younger sister and I moved to Houston where my mother ' s brothers lived . My mother found life there boring though , so when I was 7 we moved to Mexico_City and stayed there for six years. &quot; During the years MacConnel ' s family lived_in Houston , his mother worked as a decorator . &quot; I ' d deny it , but maybe her work as a decorator had an effect on me , &quot; says MacConnel , whose younger sister , Bridget MacConnel , is an artist who does tile work and cloisonne . &quot; My mother took painting classes when we were in Mexico_City and always loved art -- I grew_up in an environment where education was considered important . &quot; Those years in Mexico_City left me with an insatiable wanderlust , &quot; he continues . &quot; As a kid I spent a lot of time skipping school and wandering around Mexico_City by myself . We lived there in the mid- ' 50s when they were building the subway , and they dredged_up all kinds of stuff from lake_bottoms and stored it on tables in the courtyard of a city building . The front_door was always open there and I loved to go look_at this stuff . &quot; My experiences in Mexico_City are reflected in the anti-Minimalist art I make , &quot; he adds . &quot; Minimalism was a hermetic movement based on system and theory , and I ' ve always been attracted to odd things outside the system . I remember being impressed by this scuzzy old guy in Mexico_City who always wore two pairs of pants and left his fly down . He sold artifacts and things like fake Aztec maps in the thieves ' market , and fakery has always been an interest of mine . Fakery , myth and cliche have a beguiling quality of non-reality and are a big part of art-making . Artists create myths and artifacts. &quot; At the age of 12 MacConnel left Mexico for a pre-prep school in Connecticut , then spent four years at the Tabor Academy , a prep_school in Marion , Mass . &quot; From there I went_on to Rutgers University where I spent two miserable years drinking and playing_cards , prior to flunking out when I was 18 , &quot; MacConnel says . &quot; I was such a hopeless case at Rutgers that just before flunking out I bought some paint and covered the wall_in my room with a big , awful , abstract painting . That was the first time it occurred to me to make any kind of visual art -- I wasn ' t one of those kids who drew . &quot; When I left school I joined the Merchant Seamen and wound_up on a ship off the coast of Vietnam -- this was 1966 , so it was pretty scary over there , &quot; he continues . &quot; We were in Da Nang harbor when there was a mortar attack , and got shot at a lot going_up the Saigon River . The war changed me , not because it was scary , but because it was so bogus . The supplies we carried were medical supplies and a huge amount of liquor . It left me very cynical. &quot; MacConnel left the Merchant Seamen in 1968 and settled in San Diego , where his mother and sister were living ( MacConnel ' s mother was born and raised there ) . Enrolling at Mesa Junior_College with no particular goal in mind , he took an art_class , &quot; and was lucky enough to get a terrific teacher who liked what I did , &quot; he recalls . &quot; I was just playing_around making adolescent pen and ink drawings , but she encouraged me to apply at UCSD , which I got_into in 1968 . &quot; I was very ignorant as I entered this arcane world , &quot; he recalls . &quot; At the time I was making large polka-dot paintings a lot like the ones I ' m making now , and nobody was making work like that then -- maybe somebody in New York was , but I hadn ' t been there at that point , and avoided reading about what was going_on there . Minimalism and Conceptualism were the dominant styles at UCSD , so I didn ' t feel part of things . &quot; That began to change for me when the New York critic Amy Goldin came here to teach from 1968 through 1970 -- she was a huge influence on my work . Amy was a rigorous intellectual , which I was not by any stretch of the imagination , and she provoked an interest in that world for me . She led me to begin asking myself such questions as : Why is an Oriental carpet not art ? Why is it decorative art ? What is a decorative art ? Why are Renoir the younger ' s pots not art , yet his father ' s paintings are art ? Who created this hierarchy of aesthetics ? I came_to the conclusion that a lot of it is simply pedigree. &quot; Graduating in 1971 , MacConnel spent a year in Europe with his first wife , Nina MacConnel-Chino , whom he married in 1969 and divorced in 1980 . On returning , he tackled the arduous task of landing a one-man show . &quot; I mowed a lot of lawns for several years after I got_out of school , &quot; he laughs . &quot; Nobody on the West Coast would touch my work . ( Orange Country dealer ) Jack Glenn showed one piece in 1973 , but it didn ' t sell and that was the only time he showed my work . That same year I went_to New York and made appointments with every gallery in town , but everyone told me my colors were too bright . One person actually told me I ' d never get a show in New York because my work wasn ' t somber enough. &quot; That person was wrong , of course . MacConnel made his solo debut in New York two years later at the then-newly opened Holly Solomon Gallery , which played a key role in popularizing Pattern and Decoration . In 1976 MacConnel began teaching at UC San Diego , a job he hung onto until 1980 , despite the fact that his work was selling at a consistently brisk pace by 1978 . He left the university in 1980 , and didn ' t return until 1987 . &quot; I ' ve been here , more or less , for 25 years -- I ' m totally a product of this place , &quot; MacConnel says . The other constant in MacConnel ' s life is the beach . He lives with his wife of two years , artist Jean Lowe , in the small beach town of Encinitas , goes body surfing twice a day , and has been collecting trash on beaches since 1975 . &quot; This isn ' t an ecological show although that will inevitably be read into it , &quot; he says of &quot; Age of Plastic. &quot; &quot; I ' ve been making stuff out of beach trash since ' 75 , mostly flower vases and things like that -- in fact , when I moved_into this studio the first thing I brought_in was my trash_pile . I always have a Hefty bag with me when I go_to the beach and I just toss things in the bag . I ' ve collected trash all_over the world -- India , Africa , Mexico -- and I mix it all together . I mostly pick_up aged stuff that looks_like it ' s been floating around a while , but I don ' t collect aesthetically -- I ' m not looking_for treasures or bright sea shells . At the same time , I don ' t pick_up everything because if I did I ' d have a room full of fast-food wrappers . The most common things on the beach are tampon applicators and lighters , and the best beach trash is in Africa -- you find plastic baskets , weird little dolls , and all kinds of things typical of that culture. &quot; As to how he made the leap from trash to clowns , he explains , &quot; in 1993 I saw a show at the Guggenheim called ' The Age of Iron ' that included work by people like Picasso , Miro and Calder , and for some reason when I looked_at the show I just thought , ' Bing ! Clowns are where it ' s at ! ' There were no clowns in that show , &quot; adds MacConnel , who ' s amassed an army of about 400 of the figures at this point , &quot; but it made me realize we ' re living in the age of plastic . &quot; I think_of these pieces as the polka_dot meets ( Minimalist sculptor ) Don Judd -- Judd is the sconce-shaped base , and the clown is the polka_dot , &quot; he says of the work , which will also be exhibited at the Holly Solomon Gallery in New York in November . &quot; The bases play off Minimalism , and the work is installed to create a repetitive pattern on the wall . The clowns cut those formalist qualities though because they ' re clearly handmade , and the clown occupies a debased position in art . My hope is that the work reads as funny , pathetic and disgusting . The little clown face is pitiful and humorous , but at_the_same_time , it ' s disgusting because it ' s trash from our environment. &quot; Surveying the wall of clowns in his studio , MacConnel says : &quot; I ' m pleased to look_at 20 years of my work and see some consistency . My first show railed against a Minimalist aesthetic that still dominates the art world to a surprising degree -- many young artists are just recycling Bruce Nauman . Minimalism was about austerity and my work is rooted in exuberance . This wrestling match is always going_on in art , and I ' m absolutely clear about which side I ' m on. &quot; Stats &quot; Age of Plastic &quot; Address : Thomas Solomon ' s Garage , 928 N .
