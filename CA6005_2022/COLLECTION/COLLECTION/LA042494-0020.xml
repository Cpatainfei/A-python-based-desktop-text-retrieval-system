   <TEXT> The 1984 Purple_Hearts ( KCOP Sunday at 5 p.m. ) seems a deliberate , if pale , carbon_copy of &quot; An Officer and a Gentleman. &quot; This is an old-fashioned , all-stops-out romance between a Marine Corps doctor ( Ken Wahl ) and a Navy nurse ( Cheryl Ladd ) , played_out against the Vietnam_War . The all-time popular The Sound of Music ( NBC Sunday at 8 p.m. ) , a 1965 blockbuster , winner of five Oscars and from the final Rodgers and Hammerstein musical , stars , of course , Julie Andrews in the story of the Trapp Family Singers , who fled their home_in the Austrian Alps just before the outbreak of World_War_II . It ' s too_bad that so_much of the 1985 Target ( KTLA Sunday at 8 p.m. ) is a conventional spy thriller with high-speed chases , because at its heart it is an honest father-and-son estrangement drama that comes_to a boil when the father ( Gene Hackman ) , a Dallas businessman , resumes secret agentry after 20 years . Matt Dillon plays the son . Pale Rider ( ABC Sunday at 8:30 p.m. ) is Clint Eastwood ' s 1985 variation on &quot; Shane , &quot; a pleasant enough diversion but marred by the queasy development that finds a pretty teen-ager ( Sydney Penny ) trying to seduce Eastwood ' s grizzled Stranger , who ' s come_out of nowhere to help some gold prospectors in their fight with a ruthless hydraulic mining_company . In Fire and Rain ( KTLA Monday at 8 p.m. ) , there ' s little of either quality . The mediocre 1989 cable movie is about the crash of Delta Airlines Flight 191 at Dallas-Fort Worth on Aug . 2 , 1985 . Angie Dickinson plays a nurse and Charles Haid and Dean Jones play rescue workers , but in a sense they ' re victims , too . The Dreamer of Oz : The L . Frank Baum Story ( NBC Tuesday at 8 p.m. ) , a 1990 TV bio-pic about the author of the children ' s book that inspired the 1939 film classic &quot; The Wizard of Oz , &quot; is long on mush and short on magic . John Ritter plays the title_role as a one-dimensional bobo of such unfaltering goodness that he makes Mister Rogers look_like the Marquis_de_Sade . The 1991 Double Impact ( KCOP Thursday at 8 p.m. , Saturday at 6 p.m. ) offers two Jean-Claude Van Dammes for the price of one , and for fans of the Belgian-born martial_arts star , it delivers the goods . It ' s a fast-moving action-adventure set largely in Hong Kong , where in 1966 a_couple_of bad_guys assassinated a British entrepreneur and his wife , but the twin sons survive -- separately , of course . They meet as adults who join forces in avenging their parents ' death . Van Damme does_well in_playing two sharply defined and distinct individuals . The Enforcer ( KCOP Saturday at 8 p.m. ) , Clint Eastwood ' s third and often humorous &quot; Dirty Harry &quot; movie that was made in 1976 , tracks_down an elusive terrorist group . To Harry ' s dismay , he has a new partner -- none other_than Tyne Daly , later of &quot; Cagney and Lacey. &quot;</TEXT>
