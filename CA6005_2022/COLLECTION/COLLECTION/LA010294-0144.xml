   <HEADLINE> SOOTHSAYERS TAKE A SHOT AT NORWAY OLYMPICS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Marcello Haugen , a Norwegian soothsayer who once lived at the base of what is now the Lillehammer Olympic Park , was renowned for his accurate predictions . So when word spread that Haugen predicted a major ski competition would be canceled in Lillehammer in February 1994 due_to extreme cold , some locals began to worry . Fret not , the psychic ' s biographer , Oistein Parmann , told the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee ' s internal magazine . Parmann said Haugen , who died in 1967 , never made such a prediction . Others have , however . Stig Oyen , a Norwegian astrologer , told the magazine that the Feb . 12-27 Games would be a sporting success , but a mess in many other ways . He predicted wet weather , and that the Games would be troublesome for the news media , especially photographers . He also predicted a shock for the home country in the 10 # 000-meter speedskating competition , in which Norwegian Johann Olav Koss is a favorite . He also said Norway will take gold in the men ' s Nordic skiing relay and that a Russian would edge out a Norwegian to win the women ' s 10-kilometer Nordic skiing pursuit . * SECOND WIND : With about six weeks to go before the opening ceremony , the staff of the Lillehammer Games is ready , willing and weary . Tor Aune , spokesman for the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee , said the hectic pace of preparation was taking its toll , and that he -- like many of his co-workers -- was getting a second wind . &quot; But everything is under_control , &quot; he said in an interview with the Norwegian news_agency NTB . &quot; We are unreservedly optimistic. &quot; Aune said that for much of the staff , the Games had already begun . They are moving_into venues and preparing_for the arrival of about 2 # 000 athletes , thousands of reporters and hordes of spectators . The biggest challenge now is expecting the unexpected . &quot; We know there is a small margin between success and fiasco . We have contingency plans tucked_away everywhere , and we assume the worst possible things will happen , &quot; Aune said . * TRAGIC TENT : Efforts to recover a tent used by Norwegian Roald Amundsen when he conquered the South_Pole in 1911 were canceled this week when an expedition member fell_into a crevasse and died . The nine-member Norwegian expedition , funded partly by the Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee , had hoped to dig 50 feet into the ice to retrieve Amundsen ' s tent from the Pole in time for the Winter_Olympics . On Dec . 26 , the team ' s second in command , 36-year-old Jostein Helgestad , fell_into a 165-foot-deep crack in the ice . Despite a dramatic rescue effort by U.S. and Norwegian personnel , he was declared dead . His body was not recovered . After the accident , the team abandoned plans to bring the tent to Lillehammer for the Games . Amundsen and his team beat Briton Robert Scott in the race to become the first expedition to reach the South_Pole . Scott died in the effort . * REINDEER RUCKUS : Plans to haul a herd of reindeer from Norway ' s arctic region to Lillehammer for the Olympics have animal protection activists seeing as red as Rudolph ' s nose . The 160 reindeer , herded by Laplanders , are to be shipped 1 # 090 miles in rail cars or trucks for the Games . Some of the antlered animals -- commonly used as food in Norway -- will be paraded into the opening ceremony . Others will be available to give reindeer sleigh rides , or will simply mill_around at a Lapp encampment being built for the Games . But the animal protection group Dyrebeskyttelsen i Norge claims the reindeer are being made to suffer in the name of tourism . &quot; To ship reindeer on trucks or rail cars is pure cruelty to animals , &quot; said group spokeswoman Tatiana Kapsto . The group asked the government to stop the plan , but the Ministry of Agriculture refused , saying that the domesticated reindeer are used to human_activity and should withstand the trip with no trouble . &quot; I am furious that the agriculture ministry has approved , &quot; Kapsto told the Oslo newspaper Verdens Gang . &quot; We will mobilize heavily during the Olympics to show our disgust. &quot;</TEXT>
