   <HEADLINE> INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS / EXECUTIVE TRAVEL : SPOTLIGHT ON GERMANY ; WHEN DOING BUSINESS THERE . . .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Business practices in Germany , a member of the Group of Seven industrialized nations , are similar to customs in the United States . But there are some legal , practical and cultural variations . DO : * Expect German businessmen to speak and understand English . Although German is the official language , members of the international business_community are invariably fluent in English , in addition to having a good command of at least one other foreign language . * Be prepared to start your business day at 8 a.m. Generally , the workday ends at 5 p.m. , but many businesses close early on Fridays . * Check to see which holidays are observed in the area you are visiting . Germany has 16 legal_holidays a year , but not all are recognized in all parts of the country . * Be punctual for appointments . In Germany , there is no such thing as &quot; fashionably late , &quot; even for social functions . * Allow a third_person to introduce you to people with whom you wish to have a business_relationship . Germans prefer to meet strangers through another person rather than introducing themselves directly . * Familiarize yourself with European Union regulations and procedures . Many aspects of German business , including international trade , are regulated by EU rules . * Consider investing in eastern Germany . The German government offers substantial incentives for moving capital into almost any sector of the depressed eastern German economy . * Hire German legal and tax advisers at an early stage when forming a new business venture . Where you locate and the legal structure of your business will influence your overall tax burden . * Apply for a residence permit if you plan to stay in Germany for longer than three months . A temporary residence permit may be obtained once you get there . DON ' T : * Don ' t bother to get a visa if you will be staying less than three months . Since the United States is a member of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization , your U.S. passport will suffice when visiting Germany on business . * Don ' t count_on government_offices being open in the afternoon . They are typically open_to the public between 8:30 a.m. and noon . However , you may make an afternoon appointment in_advance . * Don ' t expect American banking hours . German banks are typically open from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 2:30 to 4 p.m. during the week . Some remain open longer on Thursdays . * Don ' t write dates in the American order of month , day , year . The traditional German order is day , month , year , but many government_offices and others follow the European Union style of year , month , day . For example , today ' s date would be written as 1994.06.30. * Don ' t expect special treatment as a foreign investor . The German government has no special programs to encourage foreign investment . Foreign companies receive the same benefits as domestic firms and are subject_to the same regulations . * Don ' t wait to be seated when dining at a German restaurant . Except in the most formal of restaurants , there are no hosts or hostesses to greet and seat you .
