   <HEADLINE> WESTSIDE COVER STORY ; THE SURF TURF WARS ; COMPETITION FOR PRIME SPOTS HAS FORCED SURFERS TO RESORT TO TRESPASSING , FISTICUFFS , EVEN NIGHT RIDING , IN THEIR ENDLESS PURSUIT OF THE PERFECT WAVE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> AT SUNSET , AS DOZENS OF SURFERS are leaving the water at Malibu ' s Surfrider Beach , Tim Dion straps on a_battery belt , a toggle_switch and a helmet fitted with a 100-watt light . He picks_up his surfboard and wades into the darkening sea . Within moments of paddling out , Dion , his head lamp shining , is riding the curls alone , a surreal beam streaking through the water . &quot; This is the only way I can avoid the crowds , &quot; he said after coming ashore . &quot; It ' s peaceful ; no cars on the highway ; totally quiet . I put_on my waterproof Sony Walkman , my ( light ) and I ' m in my own world. &quot; With interest in surfing seemingly at an all-time high , so too is competition for prime Westside wave-riding spots . Surfers are making room by trespassing on private beach property or confronting rivals -- sometimes with their fists . But they have also resorted_to more creative means . Some take_to the water at night . Others tap high-tech wave forecasting services to meet the surf the very minute it arrives . And still others travel_to Southern California ' s offshore islands -- even distant countries -- to catch the perfect wave , perfectly alone . It is a struggle for space in a sport that , for many who practice it , thrives on solitude . Sharing a wave , many surfers believe , violates the aesthetics of surfing , and can even be dangerous . &quot; You really need one person per wave to get a clean ride , &quot; said David Clark , a longtime surfer from Santa Barbara . &quot; It ' s not like skiing where you have a whole mountain . If more_than one is_on a wave , you ' re riding their wake , adjusting your ride . It ' s like a traffic jam. &quot; After growing steadily for decades , the popularity of surfing has exploded in the last two years , according to an expert . Mike Kingsbury , managing director of the Surf Industry Manufacturers ' Assn. , a trade organization representing the surf apparel , equipment and accessories industries , says a recent industry survey estimates that 1.5 million Americans will surf actively ( at least four times ) in 1994 . That figure is a significant increase from the 1.1 million who said they actively surfed in 1992 . California accounts_for about 45 % of the national total , with a majority of that share_in the Southland . Said Kingsbury : &quot; Increased television coverage is driving interest in the sport and many baby_boomers who once gave_up surfing in the ' 70s are now going_back in the water and bringing their kids. &quot; On the Westside , the result has been further crowding at such popular surf spots as Topanga Beach , Malibu Surfrider Beach , Zuma Beach , Leo Carillo State Beach and County_Line . Up to 200 surfers pack the lineup at each place on summer weekends , jostling for position , trading words and , occasionally , exchanging blows . &quot; Sometimes I ' ll see two to three fights a day on a good swell . There are just so many_more surfers than waves , &quot; said John Baker , a longtime Malibu lifeguard . &quot; The caliber and competition of surfing has also gone way up. &quot; Complicating matters is a more aggressive attitude displayed by a younger generation of surfers . &quot; In the ' 80s the image was almost clean-cut and yuppie , &quot; said Martin . &quot; Now the look has gotten more grungy , with surfers wearing tattoos , nose_rings and earrings and having a more hostile attitude. &quot; Surfers say Point Dume and Trancas Point in Malibu are known local areas where non-resident surfers can be verbally and sometimes physically harassed . &quot; I ' ve witnessed fights , cars ruined , fins punched off ( surfboards ) and people told to leave , &quot; said Ted Silverberg , a Point Dume resident who operates a surfing school in the area . &quot; Localism is a backward mentality , but sometimes I can understand it after watching two guys ( from outside the area ) leaving 16 cigarette_butts and two Coke cans on the beach and screwing_up in the water all day. &quot; Trespassing is another symptom of increasing congestion among surfers . Though open beaches and public trails to the water abound from Santa Monica to Ventura County , some areas north of Zuma Beach have several miles of limited access . On a recent Sunday afternoon , one surfer near Trancas ducked under barbed wire and tiptoed down the side of a cliff on private_property to get_to the peeling waves . &quot; There ' s such an inland influx of surfers on weekends that you have to resort_to the private areas to get a good quota of opulent waves , &quot; he said , declining to be named . But fisticuffs and fence-climbing are not for everyone . Surfers are exploring new methods of crowd avoidance . Perhaps the most striking is surfing at night . On full-moon nights when the surf is up , as_many as 25 surfers ride the waves at Malibu ' s Surfrider Beach , a small fraction of the daytime crowd . Some tape flashlights to their arms . Others mark their wet suits and surfboards with fluorescent paint , tape or sticks_to improve vision and avoid collisions with other surfers . Dion says he has developed a special camaraderie with his fellow night surfers . One , a comedian , often takes_to the water after his midnight routine at local clubs ; another howls at the moon ( usually after arguments with his girlfriend ) , and a third relies_on nighttime surfing to sober_up after parties . Waiters at nearby Alice ' s Restaurant say that the flickering lights startle diners , some of whom asked if Martians were invading . Those participating in the midnight recreation say the experience can be surreal and at times unnerving . The ocean is aglow , with the breaking waves and paddling of surfers creating splashes of light . At night , an errant piece of seaweed brushing against the legs can cause even the most hardy waterman to genuflect wildly . And then there are encounters with real-live denizens of the deep . &quot; One time I was riding a wave and got hit in the stomach by a bunch of flying fish which knocked the wind out of me , &quot; said Dion . &quot; Thank God they weren ' t swordfish. &quot; Many surfers who are determined to ride waves during the day have turned_to wave forecasting services for high-tech help . One of the most heavily used is Surfline / Wavetrak in Huntington Beach . Owner Sean Collins often can predict wave heights to within a foot , up_to two weeks in_advance , for almost any beach in the world . His swell forecasts for Westside beaches are rarely off by more_than three hours . Most good surfing waves are spawned by storms far out_in the Pacific_Ocean . Collins tracks wind speeds and wave heights via private satellites , the National Weather Service , the U.S. Navy , forecasts from other countries such_as New Zealand , and signals from an assortment of buoys and boats far out at_sea . The raw data is run_through a custom-made computer_program that crunches out specific information for particular beaches . Wave size and direction are calculated and then adjusted to account_for the &quot; shadowing &quot; effects of Southern California ' s nine offshore islands and underwater shelving , which can sometimes eliminate the potency of some swells . Surfline / Wavetrak boasts better than 90 % accuracy and receives 3 # 000 to 4 # 000 calls daily on its 900 number , which costs $ 1.50 per call . Paradoxically , the use of wave forecasting has made the rush for the water even more intense . &quot; In the old days when swells would hit , you ' d have it uncrowded until word filtered through the pipeline , &quot; said Mikke Pierson , owner of Z.J. Boarding_House , a surf shop in Santa Monica . &quot; Now , when people know a big swell is coming , there ' s a rush on equipment , and they ' re out at the beach before the waves have even arrived. &quot; Said Dion : &quot; Guys are getting_off work and changing their whole schedule . There is no element of surprise left. &quot; Some surfers have sought sanctuary from the growing throngs on such offshore islands as San Clemente , San Miguel , Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz . &quot; There ' s clean water , no hassles , no pollution or development . It ' s just the way it was 500 years ago , &quot; said Jefferson Wagner , owner of Zuma Jay ' s surf shop in Malibu and an avid Channel Islands surfer . &quot; The beaches are so clean the sand squeaks beneath your feet when you ' re walking. &quot; But Wagner says a forbidding local scene is developing even on the Channel Islands . Some spots there are staked out by surfers who feel entitled to the turf because they also fish commercially in nearby waters . Other surfers look farther afield . In fact , most serious wave riders say that , given the crush for surfing space in Southern California , travel has now become a mandatory part of their lifestyle . &quot; A trip to another country is a throwback to the early days of surfing , &quot; said Chris Martin , owner of Toucan Surf Tours in Newport Beach , which runs trips to Costa Rica and other countries in Central_America . &quot; It ' s uncrowded and has the pioneer feeling California and Hawaii had in the late ' 50s before Gidget. &quot; Martin sends roughly 1 # 000 surfers a year -- many of them Westside residents -- to a variety of surf locales far down the coast . Prices range from $ 600 to $ 800 for a one-week trip including air fare , a vehicle and hotel . Another popular destination is Tavarua Island in Fiji , which boasts excellent year-round surf and is prominently featured in in the new surfing film &quot; Endless Summer II. &quot; David Clark , part owner of Tavarua Island Tours in Santa Barbara , has a lease on the 20-acre island , which has only 12 cottages , each accommodating two people . The surfer population is never allowed to exceed 20 . The cost is about $ 135 per night including accommodation , meals and the use of five boats to ferry guests to the surf reefs . Round-trip air fare is about $ 900 . Ron Le Blanc , a salesman at Becker ' s Surf and Sport in Malibu , surfed Tavarua in 1992 and said it was worth the money . &quot; I wanted to capture that feeling of just being with my friends , no vibes , just serenity , &quot; he said . &quot; To get that , you really have to travel quite far now. &quot; Other Westside surfers prefer to exploit the 1 # 000-mile Baja coastline , which has some beaches never walked upon by man . Air charter companies using propeller_planes ferry groups of four to five surfers to desolate beaches and islands . Popular destinations are Scorpion Bay , about 600 miles south of the border , and Isla Natividad , about one-third of the way down the Baja coast . Jeff Kurtz , an avid surfer who grew_up in Brentwood , works as a part-time pilot for Baja Air Ventures in San Diego . The company flies surfers to isolated spots all_over Mexico . Such &quot; Baja bush pilots &quot; must exhibit great daring and initiative to cope_with surfers ' demands and the bumpy state of small-town runways . For instance , Kurtz says the Mexican government began blowing_up small village runways in Baja a_few years ago to deter drug runners from hop-scotching on their journeys north . After many trips , Kurtz says , he has persuaded many of the locals to repair their landing_strips by giving them gifts and bringing_in extra business . The generosity has paid_off . On one night trip last year , with four white-knuckled surfers in the back of his plane , Kurtz began to run_out of gas over Punta Abreojos , a small_town 400 miles south of the U.S. border . Unable to find the runway , he buzzed the village center . Within minutes , dozens of local residents drove their cars out_to the landing area and illuminated the dirt strip with their car headlights . &quot; Some of us thought we were in the last moments of our lives . We had been looking_for a lighthouse but there was no moon and it was pitch_black , &quot; he said . &quot; Surfers will do anything to get_out of crowds and into virgin areas. &quot; To escape the multitudes , others have abandoned wave riding in favor of alternative modes of surfing . Rob Harris , a Hollywood resident , says he stopped vying for waves at Malibu ' s beaches and now sky surfs -- sky diving with his feet strapped to a board about the size of a snowboard from a height of 12 # 000 feet . &quot; I don ' t have to wait for swells , it ' s always consistent , and I don ' t have to deal with any crowds , &quot; he said . &quot; I can carve , track , flip , roll , twist , spin and bank , just the way I used to surf Malibu. &quot; The sport , which has about 500 participants worldwide , was invented in the late 1980s in Europe . When Santa Monica surfer Todd Roberts tires of the crowds and lack of surf , he heads to Lake Havasu , where he spends time wake-boarding -- being towed behind a power boat on a small surfboard . &quot; In the middle of winter , there ' s no crowds , no other boats and the water is like complete glass , &quot; he said . &quot; You can flip , carve , jump the wake and bash the lip_off the wake. &quot; But for some die-hard surfers , wave riding remains the ultimate sport -- even if it has to be done at unusual times and places . Dion says some of his most treasured experiences have been_on his board on a dark night at Malibu , across the bay from the din of Los Angeles , quietly bobbing_up and down on the swells . &quot; I ' ve talked to many guys who never surf in the daytime , &quot; he said . &quot; It all comes_down to one man , one wave. &quot;</TEXT>
