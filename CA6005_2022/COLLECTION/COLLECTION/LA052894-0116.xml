   <HEADLINE> CLERGY POLISH COUNSELING SKILLS TO AID PARISHIONERS ; PSYCHOLOGY : SOME RETURN TO COLLEGES OR SEMINARIES TO LEARN HOW TO DEAL WITH COMPLEX PROBLEMS AND NEEDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mounting personal pressures often send people to their religious_leaders for help first , but the days of clergy merely sending troubled individuals home to study and pray are long gone . Confronted with issues ranging from relationships and sexuality to elder abuse and alcoholism , a growing number of clergy are offering new levels of encouragement through crisis_intervention and short-term counseling . Some are returning to colleges and seminaries to update their skills and learn effective counseling techniques . &quot; Life is not simple and people cannot be given simple answers , &quot; said the Rev . Cecil Murray of the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles . Clergy ordained before this psychological awakening often feel ill-equipped to deal with many of today ' s issues . In response to this concern , Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena created a new Ph.D. program in practical theology . Introduced last fall , the doctoral program , which heavily emphasizes pastoral counseling , filled_up 21 spaces immediately . Gwen Garrison , Fuller ' s dean of academic advisement , believes that the program will better equip practicing clergy to deal with contemporary problems . &quot; Those re-entering school who have been working in the community are coming_back with more pertinent questions based on their life experiences , &quot; Garrison said . Dr. Richard Blackmun , a clinical_psychologist who teaches a class at Fuller to help clergy deal with practical issues and daily stresses , said many pastors feel increasing pressure to become specialists where their predecessors were generalists . &quot; Many clergy feel inadequate doing the things that make_up the bulk of their day , such_as administration and counseling , &quot; Blackmun said . &quot; There is an incredible amount of burnout within the religious community , and the burnout is happening at younger ages. &quot; But those clergy who refresh their skills find themselves better able to serve their congregations , he said . Although the emotional needs are great within the communities , often the resources are not . In small congregations , up_to 60 % of the clergy ' s time is given to counseling members . And although larger congregations such_as All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena and First AME often have resources to retain professionals , a great demand for qualified , affordable religious counseling still exists . At the First Presbyterian_Church of Hollywood , Herb Robinson , an ordained Presbyterian minister and licensed clinical_psychologist , is the executive_director of the Creative Counseling Center , one of the first church-based counseling centers in the country . Started in the late 1970s , the center offers sliding-scale counseling with four therapists available . Robinson believes that clerical counseling has immeasurable value to those in religious organizations . &quot; Oftentimes , an individual is referred to a practitioner who doesn ' t honor or respect a person ' s faith , &quot; Robinson said . &quot; For many , the issues worked_on in therapy -- such_as marriage and family -- dovetail with the person ' s faith and value commitments . Practitioners use a much different approach when they understand their client ' s faith. &quot; * A married_couple who attend therapy at the Creative Counseling Center agree . They had first gone_to an outside therapist who immediately began leading them toward a separation . &quot; Although our problems were pretty serious at the time , divorce wasn ' t an option we were ready to consider , &quot; the woman says . Through religious-based counseling , the two have learned coping techniques that they can use , in accordance with their faith , to strengthen their marriage and help them through the rocky times . At First AME , Murray and four other ministers do most of the personal counseling , although the church also retains two clinical_psychologists for referrals . Murray said he intends to go_back to school to enhance his counseling skills and bring them up_to date . &quot; The sheer numbers could require , in a large church such_as this , a separate individual who does nothing else ( but provide counseling ) from 7:30 in the morning to 10:30 at night , &quot; Murray said . &quot; There is so_much talk_of suicide in this community that we know that people are hurting in great quantity , &quot; he added . At the University Synagogue in West Los Angeles , Rabbi Allen Freehling offers crisis counseling , particularly on marital issues . Although he has a psychology doctorate , which he earned shortly after completing Rabbinic school , Freehling believes that it is often wiser_to refer his members to other therapists who can more fully explore the issues at_hand . Freehling , who is an AIDS activist and co-founder of the Los Angeles County Commission on AIDS , is often approached by parents of gay and lesbian children who have questions or confusion about their child ' s health or sexuality . &quot; Within this role , I discuss many issues relating to the AIDS epidemic as well as death and dying , &quot; he said . Death is overwhelmingly the main concern at West Hollywood ' s Metropolitan Community Church , an ecumenical congregation that , although open_to all people , ministers primarily to gays , lesbians and bisexuals . The Rev . Nancy Wilson heads the church , which offers group counseling sessions to help facilitate the grief and loss resulting from AIDS . &quot; In many cases , people in the groups will have lost 10 , 15 , 20 friends to the epidemic , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; We are always in the process of learning new techniques , new support issues , active listening , and anything that will provide comfort to our members. &quot; Freehling agrees that clergy must be open_to learning new ways to help their congregations . &quot; It ' s necessary for clergy to extend ourselves intellectually . As we empty out our treasury of ideas , it is imperative that we replenish it. &quot;</TEXT>
