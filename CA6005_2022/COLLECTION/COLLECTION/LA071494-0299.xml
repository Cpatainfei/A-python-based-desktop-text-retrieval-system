   <HEADLINE> ARTHUR ANDERSEN LOSES $ 1.9-MILLION NEGLIGENCE JUDGMENT ; ACCOUNTING : PACIFIC COAST PACKAGING SUED OVER THE FIRM ' S FAILURE TO DETECT EMBEZZLEMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Montebello company has won a $ 1.9-million judgment against Arthur Andersen &amp; Co . in a suit accusing the accounting_firm of negligence during a four-year period in which the client ' s controller embezzled $ 2.5 million . Interest on the judgment could bring_to nearly $ 3 million the sum owed to Pacific Coast Packaging . An attorney for Pacific Coast said Los Angeles County Superior_Court Judge J . Kimball Walker will determine the interest award next Thursday . A jury in Kimball ' s Norwalk court rendered its verdict against the Big 6 accounting_firm late Monday and decided Tuesday that Pacific Coast was owed interest on the amount . However , an attorney for Arthur Andersen said he believes that , at the very least , the judge will cut the jury award in half . The firm expects to file a motion &quot; within the week &quot; to have the jury ' s verdict set_aside and &quot; will not rest until it ' s a complete victory , &quot; said Marshall Grossman of the Century City law_firm Alschuler , Grossman &amp; Pines , which represented Andersen in the six-week trial . The embezzlement by the controller , Edwin H . Carr Jr. , began in 1986 and was discovered in late 1990 by a Pacific Coast Packaging employee . It created serious financial problems and forced Pacific Coast ' s parent company to sell a subsidiary . Carr was convicted and served a jail term ; the lawsuit was filed against Andersen in 1992 , according to Michael Winsten , one of two attorneys from the firm Bye &amp; Hatcher in Irvine who represented Pacific Coast . Arthur Andersen was the company ' s auditor from 1978 until 1991 . It contended that it was not hired to conduct a fraud investigation and therefore could not be held liable for Pacific Coast ' s losses . But , as in a lengthening string of recent decisions against accounting_firms , the jury apparently rejected that argument and found Andersen ' s auditors primarily negligent for not detecting the fraud . In May , the state Board of Accountancy filed documents seeking to revoke or suspend Arthur Andersen ' s license , accusing it of negligence in its audits of three S &amp; Ls , including Irvine-based Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan . Andersen ' s attorneys said the move is aimed at coercing it to settle with the state . The accounting_firm has already paid more_than $ 79 million to the federal_government , stemming from charges related to its audits of Lincoln and other failed thrifts .</TEXT>
