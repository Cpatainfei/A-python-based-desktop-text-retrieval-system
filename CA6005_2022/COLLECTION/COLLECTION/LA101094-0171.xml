   <HEADLINE> CHRISTOPHER LAUDS OVERTURE BY SYRIA ; MIDEAST : SECRETARY OF STATE KICKS OFF HIS MEDIATION MISSION BY PRAISING DAMASCUS OFFICIAL ' S ' SYMBOLIC ' INTERVIEW ON ISRAELI TV .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The atmosphere for peace talks between Israel and Syria has never been more favorable than it is now as a result of recent attempts by Damascus to appeal_to Israeli public_opinion , U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said Sunday . Starting a weeklong mediation mission that will take him to Jerusalem and Damascus twice , Christopher cited a long and often contentious interview that Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Shareh gave to Israel ' s state-owned television as a demonstration of Syria ' s new attitude . Christopher said Shareh ' s &quot; willingness to have an interview with an Israeli journalist is an important step toward reconciliation &quot; even though the Syrian foreign_minister ' s words echoed Damascus ' traditional hard-line position . &quot; The interview was very significant in symbolic terms , &quot; Christopher said . &quot; I would urge that attention be paid to that rather than just to the substance of it. &quot; Christopher noted that , during the Madrid conference that launched the current round of Mideast peace negotiations in 1991 , Shareh refused to permit Israeli reporters to attend what had been billed as an open news_conference , speaking only when all Israelis had been escorted from the room . The Israeli Cabinet discussed the Shareh interview in generally favorable terms during its weekly meeting Sunday . Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin said it was a &quot; positive step &quot; for Shareh to talk directly to the Israeli public , but he denounced the substance of the foreign_minister ' s remarks , especially a claim that Syrian troops never shelled Israeli civilian targets during the wars between the two nations . Rabin , Israel ' s army chief_of_staff during the 1967 Middle_East War , said the Syrians repeatedly shelled Israeli communities from positions in the Golan Heights , a strategic plateau that Israel captured during that conflict . The Golan is the central issue in the Israel-Syria negotiations . Syria demands the return of all_of the captured territory as a condition for peace . Israel has said it will consider a partial withdrawal but insists that Syria must first indicate whether it is ready to exchange ambassadors , open the border and take other steps_in exchange . Israeli Environment Minister Yossi Sarid said the interview was an important gesture , but added : &quot; I don ' t think the government is about to offer a deal of the Golan Heights in exchange &quot; for a television_program . Christopher urged Israelis to view the Syrian gesture in the context of other recent signs of an Arab-Israeli warming . In a little more_than a year , Israel has reached preliminary peace agreements with the Palestinians and Jordan , and has opened diplomatic contacts with Morocco and Syria . In addition , the oil-rich states of the Gulf Cooperation Council have agreed to stop enforcing the Arab boycott of companies that do business with Israel . Christopher meets today with Rabin , Foreign Minister Shimon Peres and other Israeli officials . He is scheduled to go_to Damascus on Tuesday to report the Israeli views to Syrian President Hafez Assad and to obtain the Syrian reply .</TEXT>
