   <HEADLINE> CHECHEN RESIDENTS FLEE CAPITAL IN FACE OF RUSSIAN THREAT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The streets of Chechnya ' s capital were filled with fleeing residents and the roar of raiding jets Wednesday , and neither side in the republic ' s civil_war gave any sign of heeding Russia ' s threat to intervene . Russian transport planes were bringing troops and weapons to the border of the small , mostly Muslim republic in the Caucasus Mountains , it was reported . They will be in position to enforce President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s ultimatum for the Chechens to stop fighting by today or face Russian intervention . The fighting pits forces loyal to Chechen President Dzhokar Dudayev , who has declared Chechnya independent from Russia , against rebels whom Dudayev says are armed and led by Moscow . The conflict is the latest to underline the tensions among scores of ethnic_groups in the former Soviet_Union . The Caucasus region has been especially fractious . For Moscow , which governs dozens of republics and regions in the Russian Federation , Chechnya has become a test of whether it is willing to use military might to hold the country together .</TEXT>
