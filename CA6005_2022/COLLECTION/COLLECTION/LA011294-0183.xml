   <HEADLINE> METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF : DRIVE BEGINS FOR LAW CURTAILING SERVICES TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An immigration reform group led by two former top INS officials on Tuesday kicked_off a petition drive to place on the November state ballot a measure that would virtually bar illegal immigrants from public hospitals and schools . Sponsors of the &quot; Save Our State ( SOS ) &quot; initiative began dropping_off petitions to citizens ' groups advocating immigration changes.They need to gather 384 # 974 valid signatures by June 8 to qualify the measure for the ballot . &quot; California is in big trouble due_to illegal immigration , &quot; said Harold Ezell , Western regional chief of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service from 1983 to 1989 and co-author of the proposal with Alan Nelson , the INS commissioner under President Ronald Reagan . &quot; We can do a lot to make_it so uncomfortable that people who want to come here illegally know that they cannot survive. &quot; The initiative , among the most stringent proposals put forth so far in the debate over illegal immigration , would require public hospitals and schools to report illegal immigrants to the INS . It would eliminate prenatal care_for pregnant women who are here without papers . Illegal immigrants could receive emergency medical service but risk being reported to the INS . Former Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum is sponsoring a separate initiative to cut_off most emergency medical_care to illegal immigrants and require Californians to carry identification cards attesting to their legal residency . Schabarum ' s proposal has yet to be cleared by state officials for circulation . Immigrant rights groups have argued that it is jobs , not public_services , that draw illegal immigrants to the United States . RICHARD SIMON</TEXT>
