   <HEADLINE> DESPITE ARISTIDE PLEA , OAS AND U.N. PULL OBSERVERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United Nations and the Organization of American_States , concerned about their human_rights monitors ' safety in Haiti , rejected a plea from exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and agreed to withdraw the workers from the beleaguered Caribbean nation . Aristide , in an interview with The Times and The Miami Herald , said he discussed the Haitian military ' s expulsion order with U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and told him , &quot; Personally , I would defy it. &quot; But a U.N. spokesman announced that Boutros-Ghali and Christopher R . Thomas , acting OAS secretary_general , decided to pull the observers out &quot; in the next day or so. &quot; Spokesman Joe Sills said the withdrawal was ordered out of concern for the safety of the more_than 100 observers . Their withdrawal means that just a handful of foreign embassy officials and private U.S. groups will be keeping track of human_rights abuses in Haiti . &quot; The coup leaders don ' t want to let you see the rapes they are using as a political weapon , &quot; Aristide said . &quot; If they don ' t have witnesses , they think it will be better for them. &quot; Juan E . Mendez , general counsel of Human_Rights Watch , a private monitoring group , said his organization fears &quot; this is a prelude to the systematic slaughter of remaining Aristide supporters. &quot; But even as the U.N. and OAS orders went_out to pack and leave , the U.N. Security_Council unanimously approved a stern statement condemning the military regime ' s decree expelling the observers who have documented a stream of political killings , torture and rapes in the last few months . &quot; The Security_Council considers this action a serious escalation in the defiant stance of Haiti ' s illegal de_facto regime toward the international community , &quot; the statement said . In the interview , Aristide refused to endorse or condemn a U.S. invasion to overthrow the Haitian military government but said he wants to see the regime toppled through peaceful international pressure . Some Clinton_Administration officials have complained that Aristide has privately supported an invasion , only to reject the idea in public statements .</TEXT>
