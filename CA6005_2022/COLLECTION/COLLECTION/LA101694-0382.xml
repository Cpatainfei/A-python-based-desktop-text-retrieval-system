   <HEADLINE> TRAVELING IN STYLE ; WITH JEFFERSON IN PARIS ; HE VISITED MONUMENTS , FELL IN LOVE , SPOKE BAD FRENCH -- OUR THIRD PRESIDENT WAS THE ORIGINAL AMERICAN IN PARIS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> IN AUGUST , 1784 , THOMAS_JEFFERSON ARRIVED IN PARIS ON a two-year special mission on behalf of the 13 newly independent American_states . He stayed for five years . I came for three years in 1969 , leaving New York on Richard M . Nixon ' s Inauguration_Day . I ' m still here . My friend Charlie , on the other hand , came for the rest of his life , but only stayed nine months because neither the phones nor the plumbing worked . &quot; Either one , &quot; he said , &quot; but not both. &quot; Jefferson succeeded Benjamin Franklin as U.S. minister to France . Franklin , Jefferson and John Adams all worked in Paris at about the same time , negotiating commercial treaties , their tours_of_duty overlapping . Their years in the city were important for all_of them . They took_to the place . In those days , they called Paris &quot; a pleasure-loving capital. &quot; Ismail Merchant and James Ivory ( &quot; Howards End &quot; ) are currently shooting a film called &quot; Jefferson in Paris , &quot; starring Nick Nolte as everybody ' s favorite Founding_Father . Visualize the Paris scene in Jefferson ' s day : swords , silver belt_buckles and lace ruffles , the wigs and fans and all_the dainty shoes worn by the aristocratic liberals who formed his circle of friends . He wrote to James_Madison back in the States about corruption in the_French court : &quot; The King , long in the habit of drowning his cares in wine , plunges deeper and deeper . The Queen cries , but sins on. &quot; Jefferson came_to Paris between revolutions -- after America ' s , before France ' s . His role in the development of the latter , though , has been exaggerated . He simply believed that mankind could be saved by knowledge . He had what he called a &quot; zeal to promote the general good by an interchange of useful things. &quot; Of course , he did say : &quot; I hold it that a little rebellion , now and then , is a good thing , and as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical. &quot; But Jefferson ' s faith was that of an enlightened liberal rather than of a doctrinaire revolutionary . He arrived in Paris with his 11-year old daughter , Martha , known as Patsy , and his slave James Hemings . ( He was an &quot; enlightened &quot; slave master rumored to have fathered children with James ' sister , Sally Hemings -- but that ' s another story ) . Franklin stayed_on after Jefferson ' s arrival , living_in the quiet village of Passy , a former woodcutters hamlet turned spa west of Paris , near the Bois de Boulogne . Franklin ' s home was the Hotel de Valentinois ( a hotel in those days was a private mansion ) , which stood on the crest of a hill , with terraces and gardens leading down to the Seine . Then in his late 70s , Franklin had developed some kind of &quot; stone , &quot; which the rough carriage ride into Paris had aggravated . So instead of venturing out , he received visitors -- and Jefferson paid a call_on Franklin after presenting his credentials at Versailles . Passy was incorporated into Paris in 1859 and is now a Metro stop in the 16th arrondissement . Tourists come_to the neighborhood to visit French novelist Honore de Balzac ' s house on the Rue Raynouard and the Clemenceau Museum on the Rue Franklin -- perhaps noticing the memorial plaque at the corner of Rue Singer and Rue Raynouard ( not far from the apartment in which Maria Schneider and Marlon Brando shared butter in &quot; Last Tango in Paris &quot; ) marking the site of Franklin ' s onetime home . John Adams got_to Paris with his family , including his wife , Abigail , and his son John Quincy a week after Jefferson did -- settling &quot; away from the ( city ' s ) putrid streets &quot; in Auteuil , a wine-producing village then on the outskirts of Paris , also now in the 16th . Jefferson liked the people and the places in this area , and he visited both Franklin and Adams often . All the people I know who live_in this arrondissement today , though , complain that they would be happier living elsewhere . They mostly occupy inherited or corporate ( and thus rent-controlled or free ) apartments . But there are more banks than cafes , and more poodles and politicians than people . JEFFERSON EVENTUALLY SETTLED IN ANOTHER neighborhood , one that has come_to be so famous and emblematic of Paris as_to be beyond like or dislike . His spacious home , the Hotel de Langeac , stood on the corner of Rue de Berri and the Champs-Elysees . That was the exurbs then , but today it ' s practically Times Square . The Hotel Le Warwick , a favorite of rock musicians , occupies what used to be Jefferson ' s land . Sponsored by his friend the Marquis de Lafayette , Jefferson ' s daughter Patsy was placed in a classy convent school . She wore a crimson uniform and soon spoke effortless French . This rather annoyed her father . Any American who has ever tried to learn French and failed can identify with this Renaissance_man who somehow never felt really comfortable with the_French language . JOHN TRUMBULL , SON OF A CONNECTICUT GOVERNOR , ARRIVED IN PARIS during the summer of 1786 . A 30-year-old artist who wanted to paint the events of the American_Revolution in retrospect , Trumbull carried letters of introduction to Jefferson from all sorts of other well-connected people . Hitting it off with the tall Virginian , Trumbull soon moved_into a guest room in the Hotel de Langeac . The two men took long walks together in the Bois de Boulogne . Jefferson considered Trumbull to be as good a painter as the highly regarded Jacques-Louis David ; Trumbull introduced Jefferson to Maria Cosway . As Dumas Malone writes in his biography &quot; Jefferson and the Rights of Man &quot; : &quot; Then began an adventure such_as Jefferson had certainly not expected , in a late summer which was amazingly like Spring . To put it somewhat differently , a generally philosophical gentleman , hungrier for beauty and a woman than he realized , was quite swept_off his supposedly well-planted feet. &quot; Jefferson may_not have learned the language , but he thought he had a fairly good fix on French women . He feared the effects of their voluptuous dress and manner on his susceptible young countrymen . He warned against &quot; female intrigue. &quot; ( Every heterosexual male American resident of Paris I know either came or remained for the love of a French woman. ) Maria Cosway , on the other hand , Jefferson found to be talented , modest and &quot; soft of disposition &quot; -- although it was said that she could also be &quot; the most coquettish of them all. &quot; Born in Italy of English descent , Cosway had studied art and music and spoke many languages . She played the harp . ( Jefferson played the violin and harpsichord. ) She was 27 , slim and graceful , with bountiful curly blond hair . Biographer James Boswell addressed her as &quot; Serenissima Principessa. &quot; She was married . Jefferson was a 43-year-old widower with a philosophical bent , particularly unsuited to withstand her charms . Her marriage was to some extent &quot; convenient , &quot; but Jefferson nevertheless always went_out of his way to be correct with her husband , a society painter . There was something magical , though , about every day he spent with Maria . He kept a record of their day-trips . They went_to the Chateau de Bagatelle , a small palace in the Bois de Boulogne built as a rest-stop for the queen on her trips between Versailles and Paris . ( The building still stands_in what is now called the Parc de Bagatelle . The park ' s flower_gardens are renowned , especially for their irises in May and roses in June . Art_exhibitions are held_in the chateau ' s outbuildings , the Trianon and Orangerie. ) They strolled the_hills along the Seine and visited the nearby river port of Reuilly . They enjoyed the panoramic terraces of the ancient town of St.-Germain-en-Laye just west of Paris ( whose imposing Renaissance chateau now houses the Museum of National Antiquities ) and the magnificent marble horse statues at Louis XIV ' s Chateau de Marly not far away ( now standing_in a park at the foot of the recently revamped Champs-Elysees ) . One of their favorite spots was Le Desert de Retz , the country estate of Racine de Monville , located near the village of Chambourcy , about four miles from St.-Germain-en-Laye. In the heart of Monville ' s compound was a huge column , designed to appear &quot; ruined , &quot; with a spiral staircase Jefferson admired . The column has been restored and still stands , classified as an historic monument . Jefferson ended his affair with his famous &quot; Head or Heart &quot; letter . According to the Head , Jefferson wrote Cosway , the most effective means of being secure against emotional pain was to retire within oneself , as &quot; The art of life is the art of avoiding pain ! &quot; Meanwhile , the Heart taunted , &quot; Let the gloomy monk , sequestered from the world , seek unsocial pleasures in the bottom of his cell. &quot; In the end , the Head won out , though not by much . JEFFERSON CONTINUED TO discover and enjoy Paris on_his_own . He particularly loved the Tuileries Gardens ( and who does not ? ) and witnessed a hot-air_balloon ascension there . He had been interested in &quot; aerostatics &quot; even before leaving the United States , but this was the first time he had seen a balloon lift_off with people aboard . He also attended many concerts in the gardens , hearing such artists as Haydn and the violin virtuoso Rudolphe Kreutzer ( to whom Beethoven dedicated his &quot; Kreutzer Sonata &quot; ) . Diplomacy and royal amusement , however , were increasingly moved from the Louvre and Tuileries palaces to Versailles , away from the city ' s &quot; putrid streets. &quot; It was probably just as well . On July 12 , 1789 , passing_through the Place Louis XV ( now the Place de la Concorde ) in his carriage , Jefferson saw German cavalry and Swiss Guards confronting an angry crowd . He turned_back to see the crowd attack the forces of order . Two days later , what was now being called &quot; the people &quot; got muskets , freed prisoners and beheaded the mayor . Jefferson came_to believe that he had in fact witnessed the first act of the &quot; Universal Insurrection. &quot; The American_Revolution was a salient role_model for the_French , thought Jefferson . He wrote to James_Madison , &quot; Our proceedings have been viewed_as a model for them on every occasion . . . . ( Our revolution ) is treated like the Bible , open_to explanation but not question. &quot; He believed a French_revolution was imminent , and he believed that , by following the American example , this revolution would mark the &quot; commencement of a general reformation in the government of the world. &quot; Optimistic , he wrote to Thomas Paine in England : &quot; I think there is no possibility now of anything hindering the final establishment of a good constitution &quot; in France . He was wrong . Jefferson and his family left Paris in October , 1789 , waiting for 10 days -- because of bad_weather -- at the channel port of Le Havre for a boat to begin their voyage home . Finally , shortly after midnight one evening , the Jefferson entourage set sail for England on the packet Anna . They arrived_at Cowes after 26 hours of &quot; boisterous navigation and mortal sickness &quot; and had to wait there for nearly two weeks before boarding a ship for home . Jefferson received special tariff considerations at the_English customs house by order of Prime_Minister William Pitt . And he read in the_English newspapers that a mob had invaded the Versailles Palace and conveyed the_French king to Paris .
