   <HEADLINE> NATIONAL PERSPECTIVE ; ' 94 ELECTIONS / BYPASSING THE POLITICIANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fueled by a perception of gridlock in Washington , a disgruntled citzenry seems determined to take things into their own hands . In addition to proposals placed on the ballot by politicians in many states , voters next month will consider 78 citizens initiatives -- the most in a half-century -- tackling dozens of controversial issues elected officials often ignore . The primary reason for the increase in the number of initiatives is &quot; a general frustration with the legislative process , &quot; said Bob Stern , co-director of the Center for Governmental Studies , a Los Angeles-based nonprofit research group . He cited term limits as a perfect example of something a legislature would be loath to consider , but which has proven to be a very popular ballot issue . &quot; The danger with initiatives is that any one with $ 1 million can buy their way onto the ballot &quot; by paying_for signature gatherers , Stern added . &quot; When you get too many ( proposals ) on the ballot , people will just vote no on everything. &quot; He said that many of the initiatives are poorly written and &quot; add_to the public ' s growing skepticism in government. &quot; Too many initiatives can also create a backlash . In Washington state , for example , which recently had led the country in trend-setting initiatives , just one of 33 proposals made the ballot this year -- a plan to expand the denture industry . But next door in Oregon , voters will have 15 ballot initiatives to consider , ranging from euthanasia to ending free speech protections for child pornography . The bulk of this year ' s initiatives deal with crime or gambling or are attempts to tighten control on elected officials -- either through term limits , campaign financing or reducing lawmakers ' ability to tax . Californian ' s will be voting on 10 initiatives ranging from immigration to health_care . Here is a look_at the rest of the nation , both citizens ' initiatives and issues placed on the ballot by legislators : * Gambling : Measures to expand gambling in one fashion or another appear on the ballots in eight states -- Arizona , Colorado , Florida , Nebraska , Missouri , Rhode Island , South_Dakota and Wyoming . Casino gambling is now allowed_in half of the country , either on land or on riverboats . * Taxes : Voters in four states -- Florida , Missouri , Montana and Oregon -- are demanding a greater say in the revenue-raising process by adding measures that require voter approval of any new taxes . Montana and Nevada have initiatives requiring super majorities in their state legislatures to approve any new taxes . * Crime : Six states -- California , Alaska , Idaho , Nebraska , Ohio and Utah -- have ballot measures that add or strengthen &quot; victims bills of rights. &quot; Georgia and Oregon have measures on the ballot to set specific penalties for violent crimes . Wyoming voters will consider a proposal to create a life sentence that allows_for no parole or pardons . In Ohio , death row inmates would lose one step_in the appeals process if a proposal passes . In Colorado , an initiative would eliminate bail for ex convicts who are arrested on new charges . * Gay rights : Ten states tried to place anti-gay rights initiatives on the ballot this year , but only Idaho and Oregon succeeded . Colorado ' s attempt at such legislation , Amendment 2 , was approved by voters two years ago but was never enacted . Last week , the state_supreme_court declared it unconstitutional . Currently , no states have laws barring gay rights . * Campaign finance reform : Diving into a subject that the U.S. Congress was unable to agree upon , six states ( Colorado , Massachusetts , Missouri , Montana , Nevada and Oregon ) have initiatives on the ballot that would regulate campaign contributions and spending . In Oregon , voters are considering allowing contributions only from constituents and reducing the amount one can contribute to elected officials . Colorado voters are considering capping the amount politicians can get from paid lobbyists , political_action_committees , corporations , labor_unions and government-connected big business at $ 50 a year . A Massachusetts proposal would limit the amount special_interests can spend on ballot questionnaires . * Abortion : Wyoming has an initiative that , if approved , would charge doctors performing abortions with felonies unless the life of the mother were in danger or the pregnancy were the result of rape or incest . A proposal to require parental notification gathered enough signatures in Colorado but was removed from the ballot by the state_supreme_court for technical reason . A 24-hour waiting period and informed-constant measure also failed to make the ballot in Washington . * Euthanasia : Oregon has the only ballot measure allowing physicians to perform euthanasia . The measure would allow terminally ill patients to take prescription_drugs to end their lives . Currently , no state allows assisted suicide , although a Michigan citizens ' commission recommended that the state legislature authorize the practice under a detailed set of restrictions . * Welfare reform : Although it ' s a sizzling topic on the federal scene , only one state was willing to touch it . Colorado ' s amendment 18 would allow the state to recoup the delivery costs of babies born to mothers on Medicaid from the biological parents or grandparents . An attempt was made in Washington , but the measure failed to make the ballot . * Term limits : Term limits once again are one of the most popular initiatives on the ballot , under_consideration this year in Alaska , Colorado , Idaho , Maine , Massachusetts , Nebraska , Nevada , Oklahoma and Utah . Term limits were first voted on in 1990 and have passed in 16 states thus far . Source : Public Affairs Research Institute of New Jersey , the Political Hotline . States That Allow Them Twenty-four states allow citizen ' s initiatives on the ballot to amend state constitutions or develop legislation . Of the 24 , only Mississippi , the most recent convert , and Illinois do not have measures on next month ' s ballots . States that allow initiatives on the ballot Alaska Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Florida Idaho Illinois Maine Massachusetts Michigan Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska Nevada North_Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon South_Dakota Utah Washington Wyoming Initiative Scorecard Number of statewide initiatives generated by citizens from 1981 to 1992 : 03 # 15 , 13 # 11 Initiatives Approved on ballot by voters Alaska 10 5 Arizona 20 7 Arkansas 11 6 California 65 30 Colorado 24 10 Florida 6 4 Idaho 6 4 Illinois Maine 16 10 Massachusetts 15 7 Michigan 9 3 Missouri 9 5 Montana 17 7 Nebraska 6 3 Nevada 7 3 North_Dakota 18 4 Ohio 13 3 Oklahoma 6 4 Oregon 44 17 South_Dakota 14 8 Utah 6 Washington 20 9 Wyoming 4 4 Total 346 153 * * * Number Per Year 1981 : 3 1982 : 54 1983 : 4 1984 : 41 1985 : 1 1986 : 41 1987 : 3 1988 : 55 1989 : 3 1990 : 64 1991 : 6 1992 : 69 Note : Many states do not place initiatives on the ballot in odd-numbered years</TEXT>
