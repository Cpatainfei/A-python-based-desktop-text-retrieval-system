   <HEADLINE> MATH BLASTS A NICHE IN VIDEO_GAME MARKET ; COMPUTERS : TWO SOUTH BAY SOFTWARE COMPANIES ARE SUCCESSFULLY BLENDING EDUCATION AND ENTERTAINMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Give kids Nintendo and they play nonstop for hours . Throw a_few lessons in and they start yawning . Such has been the thinking in the computer_game business . But two South Bay computer software companies have capitalized on a growing demand for educational software , bucking conventional wisdom that youngsters go_for bloody fighting games such_as Mortal Kombat to the exclusion of programs with characters who add and subtract . The companies ' successes have been a result of combining entertainment with education . Recent software_products teach children how to do math , find places on a map , even balance a budget , but still let them zap asteroids or wind their way through a maze . Sales of such &quot; edutainment &quot; software helped propel Torrance-based Davidson &amp; Associates from a small start-up business in 1983 to a company that made almost $ 60 million in sales last year . Davidson ' s Math Blaster has sold 1.6 million copies , making_it the world ' s second-most-successful educational software , after the Carmen Sandiego series produced by Broderbund Software . And Torrance-based Image Smith is trying to repeat Davidson ' s success , which sales expected to double this fiscal_year to $ 6 million . &quot; There ' s a pent-up demand ( for educational software ) , &quot; Image Smith President Dominique Claessens said . Parents want tools to supplement their children ' s classwork , he said . Analysts see the industry growing as more schools move away from traditional textbooks and embrace computer_programs . &quot; The educational software market is not that huge , &quot; said Seth Feinstein , a research analyst at Crowell , Weedon &amp; Co . in Los Angeles . &quot; It ' s less than $ 500 million . But it has a huge potential to be a billion-dollar industry. &quot; * When Rancho Palos Verdes educator Jan Davidson tried to sell computer_programs more_than a decade ago , few software companies had considered marketing educational games . &quot; I was wondering if personal_computers could have a positive effect on learning , &quot; said Davidson , 50 , president of Davidson &amp; Associates . &quot; At that time , there was no software. &quot; Her goal was to make educational software as exciting as computer_games . Among the first was Math Blaster . In it , a player who answers a problem correctly gets_to shoot a man out of a cannon . But software giants weren ' t interested . So Davidson ' s husband , Bob , encouraged her to start a company of_her_own . In 1983 , she used their three children ' s $ 6 # 000 college fund for capital and started selling and distributing Math Blaster and two other titles from their Rancho Palos Verdes home . &quot; We did everything ourselves , &quot; she said . &quot; We had something like a hair_dryer to shrink-wrap the titles . On Thanksgiving , the whole family worked all day assembling the product. &quot; The company sold $ 400 # 000 in software in its first year . Soon Davidson ' s business outgrew her home and moved_into a Gardena facility . Its biggest growth has been since 1991 , when personal_computer prices dropped , putting the technology within reach of many families , industry executives say . Educational software also has started to turn toward CD-ROM technology , compact_discs that incorporate sound , music and visuals on a personal_computer . Many mainstay programs , such_as Math Blaster , have been introduced in CD-ROM versions . Another CD-ROM title allows users to create a computer scrapbook with words , pictures and narration . In February , Davidson signed a deal with Simon &amp; Schuster , a subsidiary of Viacom , to develop curriculum-based software with the publisher ' s educational books division . The two companies also plan to create products for Simon &amp; Schuster ' s list of 300 # 000 consumer titles . Included will be a multimedia investment guide based on Peter Lynch ' s bestseller &quot; Beating the Street &quot; and an interactive children ' s book called &quot; Chicka Chicka Boom Boom , &quot; featuring singer Ray Charles . &quot; The idea is not to dump a book on a disc , &quot; said Bob Davidson , who joined the company as chairman in 1989 . The Lynch book , for example , will graphically describe Lynch ' s investment strategy , with the Wall_Street wizard offering anecdotes and advice . Still , industry_analysts say that store shelves already are flooded with software and CD-ROM titles . The Davidsons -- who control their own distribution network -- should not have much trouble , but smaller firms might , said Feinstein , the research analyst . &quot; It ' s much more difficult to get established now than it was 10 years ago , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s gotten much more competitive. &quot; * Image Smith , which started in 1991 , has depended_on cartoon characters such_as those from Peanuts and the Flintstones to grab the attention of children and their parents , rather than creating its own characters . &quot; There ' s tremendous recognition , &quot; said Claessens of Image Smith . &quot; No doubt that you can save some in advertising . But a lot ( of the licensing_agreements ) cost 10 % of sales. &quot; The company ' s Yearn 2 Learn titles -- one focusing_on Peanuts characters and another on Snoopy -- have sold more_than 150 # 000 copies since first released in January , 1993 . Claessens got his start on the design side of the computer_business . In the 1960s , he and his father developed an electronic graphic design system that was used by clients such_as Heineken , the beer-maker , to develop logos and packaging . For a time , they marketed the graphics system hardware to companies until they sold the system for $ 50 million in 1989 . Claessens launched his software company two years later . &quot; Until recently , there was not money in ( educational software ) , so no one went_after it . Everyone went_after games , &quot; Claessens said . &quot; Now the potential for growth is faster than other areas. &quot; * From the former headquarters of a Sepulveda Boulevard machine_shop , Image Smith ' s employees put the initial touches_on a new Flintstones program . Computer animators use Hanna-Barbera guidebooks that describe how the_likes_of Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble should look , walk , talk and eat . The first title , a Flintstones coloring book , debuted in June , and Claessens is encouraged by the sales . It is part of a deal with Turner Publishing , which owns the marketing rights to the animated Flintstones . Even using cartoon characters , Claessens has not lost sight of educating his young customers . In an upcoming Peanuts program , players try to piece together all 50 United States . If a player puts a state in the wrong place , characters say &quot; Oh , bummer , man. &quot; But when the youngsters get_it right , the characters give them a cheer .</TEXT>
