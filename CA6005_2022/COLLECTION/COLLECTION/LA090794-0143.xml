   <HEADLINE> PALESTINIANS IN GAZA ARREST 60 MILITANTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a showdown with powerful Muslim fundamentalists , the Palestinian police Tuesday arrested more_than 60 members of the militant Islamic Jihad in connection with a weekend attack on an Israeli army patrol in which one Israeli soldier was killed and two were wounded . In daylong raids throughout the Gaza Strip , special internal security units pulled the men from their homes , from cafes and stores , and from several mosques that serve as their bases , Palestinian officials said . The sweep was the biggest the Palestinian police have carried_out . For Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser Arafat , who ordered the arrests , the roundup was an assertion of his authority , a demonstration of his power and willingness to use it . It also was a warning to the militants , members of leftist as well as Islamic groups , that he will not tolerate further anti-Israeli attacks lest they jeopardize the extension of Palestinian self-rule to the occupied West_Bank . Faced with stern Israeli warnings that the Palestinian Authority had to act , Arafat had little choice , according to Palestinian observers , for not only expansion of Palestinian self-government but Palestinian autonomy itself was at stake . Yossi Beilin , Israel ' s deputy foreign_minister , praised the action as an important step toward fulfilling Palestinian obligations under the autonomy agreement with Israel and perhaps , in doing so , constituting a turning point in the Middle_East peace process . Yet the real test will come when Palestinian officials decide whether to prosecute those arrested . In the past two months , Palestinian police have arrested a number of Islamic militants but released virtually all without charge . None has been turned_over to Israel . Among those arrested Tuesday were Sheik Abdullah Shami , 39 , the most prominent Islamic Jihad leader in Gaza , and Taher Mohammed Lulu , 32 , the group ' s principal ideologist . All the Islamic Jihad members were described as having been jailed in the past by Israeli military authorities . More arrests are expected today . Palestinian police also arrested about 10 members of the radical Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine , whose members fired on an Israeli settler ' s car here last week . Islamic Jihad had declared that its militia carried_out the Sunday night ambush of an Israeli patrol guarding Morag , a Jewish settlement of about 70 people in the southern Gaza Strip . The group , which vehemently opposes the peace agreement between Israel and the PLO , declared that the Palestinian leadership &quot; knows perfectly this ( roundup ) of some symbols and supporters of Islamic Jihad will not make the movement change its clear strategy to struggle against and to tear out criminal Zionist roots from our beloved ( Gaza ) Strip. &quot; Arafat , who has sought to win_over the Islamic militants to the peace accord without open conflict , had denounced the continuing attacks . &quot; You know we are against it , &quot; Arafat said Monday . &quot; We are in search of these people who are trying to act against the security of the whole area . . . . They are getting their orders from outside Palestine , from far away. &quot; Brig . Gen . Ghazi Jabali of the police said that a man arrested earlier had also been linked to the killing and would be prosecuted . Israeli sources said a Palestinian injured in the shootout had led police to some of the Islamic Jihad members . Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin warned Arafat this week that the continuing attacks were endangering the peace agreement . &quot; The absence of firm and effective action by the Palestinian Authority to halt the terror of the extremists opposed to the peace process will create problems on Israel ' s part in continuing the agreement , &quot; Rabin said following Sunday ' s attack . Although such attacks have been less numerous than anticipated by Israeli security specialists when the agreement was signed , Rabin said the militants were &quot; nearing the limit &quot; of what Israel could tolerate . &quot; They are not making any effort to deal with these terror groups , &quot; he told Israel Television on Tuesday . &quot; In the future , if this continues , it raises a big question about the ability to continue with the implementation of the Declaration of Principles signed_in Washington. &quot; Rabin was referring to the accord on Palestinian autonomy , signed at the White_House on Sept . 13 , 1993 , that set a timetable for self-government . Rabin complained that the Palestinian police have done nothing to track_down two Muslim fundamentalists suspected of killing two Israeli construction workers near Tel Aviv last month . Israel has given the Palestinian police the names of the two suspects . Seven Israelis have been killed and 12 injured in attacks in the Gaza Strip since the Palestinian Authority assumed control in May .</TEXT>
