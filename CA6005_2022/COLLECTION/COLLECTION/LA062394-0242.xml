   <HEADLINE> INSURANCE POOL TOLD TO COVER QUAKES , FIRES ; DISASTER AID : GARAMENDI ORDERS HIGH-RISK FUND TO OFFER POLICIES STATEWIDE . MOVE IS MEANT TO AVERT AVAILABILITY CRISIS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an effort to block a potential meltdown of the California homeowners insurance market , Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi on Wednesday ordered the state ' s high-risk insurance pool to extend its residential earthquake and fire_insurance statewide . Garamendi ' s action , which he called &quot; strictly a stopgap , short-term measure , &quot; means that all homeowners will be able to buy_at least bare-bones residential coverage even in areas considered at high risk for earthquakes . The coverage comes from the California Fair Plan , the industry-financed insurer of last_resort that , until now , has mainly insured properties in the inner_city and brush-fire areas . The move appears to defuse -- at least temporarily -- the threat that a squeeze in availability of homeowners insurance will disrupt real_estate sales and hurt California ' s economic recovery . The squeeze came when several large insurers , including 20th Century Insurance Co . and Farmers Insurance Group , abruptly stopped writing new homeowners and earthquake policies after suffering huge losses from the Northridge earthquake . Garamendi ' s order , which takes_effect July 1 and lasts for nine months , grants the Fair Plan a 100 % hike in its earthquake insurance rates and a 20 % hike in its fire rates . The new earthquake rates of $ 2.50 per $ 1 # 000 of coverage are slightly higher than the current state average . Garamendi also called_on Gov . Pete Wilson and the Legislature to impose a temporary moratorium prohibiting insurers from refusing to renew homeowners and earthquake coverage . The rate hikes and proposed moratorium are intended to keep insurance from flooding into the Fair Plan . Marjorie M . Berte , Gov . Wilson ' s insurance adviser , said of Garamendi ' s order : &quot; It ' s fine to the extent that it solves an immediate availability crisis. &quot; Insurers , however , warned that the action does nothing to reduce companies ' exposure to devastating earthquake losses and could make the problem even worse . Since the Fair Plan simply passes_on its losses to California insurers according to their market share , Garamendi ' s action &quot; offers nothing but an unlimited and automatic assessment on the companies for whatever deficits may occur , &quot; Bill Sirola , spokesman for State Farm Mutual Automobile_Insurance Co. , said Wednesday . Although Garamendi has broad authority over the Fair Plan , it is a private fund that has no link to the state treasury . It was created after the Watts riots of 1965 as a means of providing insurance in urban_areas that traditional insurers considered too risky . Over the years , Fair Plan coverage has been extended_to rural places at high risk for wildfire , such_as the canyons of Malibu . Garamendi ' s order now extends coverage statewide . The residential policies -- available from all California insurance_agents -- offer stripped-down fire_insurance coverage , without coverage for liability , burglary or other risks . In order to obtain full coverage , consumers often supplement their Fair Plan policies with &quot; wraparound &quot; coverage from other insurers . The Fair Plan has docked member insurers for $ 210 million in the last nine months -- $ 150 million to cover losses from last fall ' s wildfires in Southern California and an additional $ 60 million related to the Northridge earthquake . Stuart M . Wilkinson , general_manager of Fair Plan , said Wednesday that the fund may have to levy an additional assessment , as earthquake losses are expected to reach $ 100 million . California ' s three largest insurers -- State Farm Mutual Automobile_Insurance Co. , Allstate Insurance Co . and Farmers Insurance Group -- all are calling_for repeal of the state law that forces companies selling homeowners insurance to also offer earthquake coverage . After the Jan . 17 earthquake , which is expected to cost insurers more_than $ 6 billion , the industry has reached the consensus that it is practically impossible to predict earthquake losses and therefore impossible to set a reasonable price for the coverage -- even if regulators would let companies charge that price . Garamendi , Berte and insurance officials agree that a long-term solution must come from the federal_government . The industry favors the Natural Disaster Protection Act , now before Congress , which would create a nationwide catastrophic insurance pool that would cover everything from earthquakes to hurricanes to ice_storms . Garamendi doesn ' t like aspects of that legislation but favors a similar approach . In the absence of a national solution , State Farm , Allstate and Farmers -- with some disagreement over details -- favor a statewide earthquake insurance program that would draw_on a specified amount of industry capital -- say , $ 1 billion . If losses from an earthquake exceeded the capital , the program would sell bonds to raise more money . Deputy Insurance Commissioner William Ahern said such a plan couldn ' t work because it is doubtful that the program could sell enough bonds to cover a huge catastrophe .</TEXT>
