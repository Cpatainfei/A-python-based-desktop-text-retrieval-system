   <HEADLINE> ' CONTAINED ' OIL SPILL REACHES RIVER ; ENVIRONMENT : LEAK FROM A UNOCAL TANK FLOWS INTO THE SANTA CLARA . IT ' S THIRD INCIDENT TO RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT REPORTING SYSTEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An oil spill , uninvestigated for eight days after it was reported as minor , flowed into the Santa Clara River on Saturday , prompting state inspectors to converge on a Santa Paula oil field to assess damage and blame . State officials acknowledged that they were embarrassed by their failure to move faster , but said Unocal reported March 12 that the spill had been contained without threatening nearby waterways . The leak is the third in three months in Ventura County to raise questions about the reporting system that state officials and environmentalist watchdogs rely_on to safeguard sensitive habitats . The latest spill , a 30 # 000-gallon mixture of light crude_oil and water , wound its way down a remote Santa Paula canyon and into the Santa Clara River after overflowing from a Unocal storage_tank . &quot; There ' s no doubt it ' s in the Santa Clara River and on its way to the ocean , &quot; said state_Department of Fish and Game Lt . Chris Long , assigned to the case Saturday . Initial reports from Fish and Game_wardens said no wildlife or habitat were severely damaged as a result of the spill . Thick globs of oil covered the edges of Adams Barranca on Saturday -- seven days after the state Office of Emergency Services was told of the release . The barranca is a small tributary that merges into the Santa Clara River before moving water on to the ocean . Investigators at the site said the state was notified by telephone of the release by Unocal executives March 12 , but that information from the oil_company prompted wardens to delay their investigation . According to Long , Unocal told the state that the release was contained and had not entered any waterways . Based on that information , a local investigator &quot; did not see it as something he had to respond to , &quot; he said . &quot; If it was reported in the waterways , we would have responded ( immediately ) , &quot; Long said . &quot; It ' s embarrassing for all_of us. &quot; But Dick Marshall , a field superintendent for Unocal , defended his report to state officials , saying the rain Saturday might have caused some of the oily residue to flow into the water . * He said his interpretation of the law was that the barranca is not a waterway . &quot; A waterway is something like the Santa Clara River , &quot; he said . &quot; Not Adams Barranca. &quot; Long , who interviewed Unocal workers at the company ' s Santa Paula facility for much of Saturday , has requested internal company documents relating to the release . Long said that although Unocal told the state March 12 that the spill was contained , he received reports of crude_oil in the barranca under the Foothill Road bridge within the past three days . &quot; There was no free-flowing oil , but there were signs that someone was cleaning_up , &quot; Long said . &quot; There were booms , sheen on rocks. &quot; Company officials said seismic activity , apparently after the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake , had caused a substantial increase in the amount of oil that seeps naturally from century-old tunnels in Adams Canyon . Production foreman Walker Kozer said the company maintains a series of pipes along the tunnel edges that collect the crude and transport it to nearby storage_tanks . But the tanks can only hold 100 barrels -- 4 # 200 gallons -- before overflowing , he said . &quot; I saw some oil going_over the weir , and that cascaded over into a sheen , &quot; Kozer said . &quot; There ' s no way to shut it off. &quot; The company replaced the 100-barrel storage_tanks with 500-barrel tanks last week , Kozer said . At least two_dozen workers were_on site every day to clean_up the oil , he said . &quot; We dammed it up , sopped it all up and cleaned it up , &quot; said Kozer , who called the effort 80 % complete on Saturday . Unocal estimated that just 500 of the 30 # 000 gallons that flowed over the edge of the storage_tank were actual crude_oil . But Kozer later said that the estimate was a guess . &quot; It could have been 10 barrels , it could have been 15 , &quot; he said . &quot; But it looked_like about 12 to me. &quot; The spill was reported to county fire officials Friday evening by Ken and Joy Chapman , who own seven acres of citrus and avocado_trees along the barranca . &quot; The response was they came_out and said they didn ' t see anything , &quot; computer_programmer Ken Chapman said Saturday afternoon as he watched the oily sheen travel downstream . &quot; Now it ' s been like this for the past 20 hours. &quot; County Fire Capt . Norm Plott said he sent a crew to investigate the Chapmans ' report moments after their phone_call Friday evening . But it was too dark . &quot; They couldn ' t see any oil in the river , &quot; he said . &quot; With flashlights , a sheen is a hard thing to detect. &quot; Plott and the county hazardous materials team , which was called_out Saturday morning after the fire crew returned to reinspect the site , were called_off the incident at midday and replaced by Fish and Game inspectors . Capt . Roger Reese , who heads the local Fish and Game office , said the Unocal spill was relatively small . But it is dangerous enough to disrupt the sensitive ecosystem that inhabits the rivershed , he said . &quot; Any time that you have oil in water in this way , it presents a hazard , &quot; Reese said . &quot; It ' s toxic for fish or animals that come_in contact with it , and it can be taken_up into the food_chain , presenting hazards to creatures higher up in the food chain. &quot; James Greaves , an environmental biologist based in Santa Barbara , said the spill could threaten an array of ecologically sensitive species , including federally endangered birds . &quot; This is one of the main breeding_grounds for the least Bells vireo , &quot; said Greaves , inspecting the barranca near the Chapmans ' home Saturday . The spill &quot; will have an immediate effect on the vegetation , but it has the potential to severely impact other food sources , &quot; Greaves said . Environmental watchdogs and government officials say several recent spills have been misreported . * In December , 84 # 000 gallons of thick crude_oil leaked into McGrath Lake near Oxnard after a state park ranger and six other law_enforcement agencies ignored early reports of the spill . Bush Oil Co . executives admitted that a pipeline leaked for three days before it was noticed . Just last week , local prosecutors served a search_warrant at a Texaco facility in Ventura , suspecting that the oil_company failed to report the true extent of a 370 # 000-gallon release of a petroleum byproduct . The existing reporting system &quot; seems to allow self-monitoring and self-regulation by the polluter , &quot; said John Buse , a staff attorney with the Environmental Defense Center in Santa Barbara . &quot; Changes in the reporting ( requirements ) should at least be looked_at , and if necessary adopted. &quot; Pat Baggerly of the Environmental Coalition of Ventura County agreed that the laws should be reviewed . &quot; Self-reporting isn ' t working well in all cases , &quot; she said . &quot; The ( state ) hasn ' t demonstrated that it is exercising its duties as an enforcement agency. &quot; Unocal has failed to come clean about its spills in the past . On Tuesday , a San Luis Obispo court_ordered the company to pay $ 1.5 million for failing to report that up_to 8.5 million gallons of a diesel-like liquid had leaked at the firm ' s Guadalupe oil field . Meanwhile , crews in Santa Barbara County worked Saturday to clean_up 2 # 000 gallons of crude that spilled from a Mobil Oil processing facility at Elwood Beach north of Santa Barbara late Wednesday . Mobil Oil confirmed that the spill was detected when golfers noticed oil oozing into an area near the 12th hole tee at the Sandpiper Golf_Course , which is next to Mobil ' s Elwood Beach facility , said Mobil spokeswoman Shauna Clarke . Clarke said that crews worked all day Friday and most of Saturday to build holding dams on the beach , where the light crude had flowed , Clarke said .
