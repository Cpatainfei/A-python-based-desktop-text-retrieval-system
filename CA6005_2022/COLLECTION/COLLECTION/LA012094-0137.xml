   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / ALEXANDER COCKBURN : A BIT MORE ABOUT INMAN AND SAFIRE ; A NAVY FEUD WITH ISRAEL AND THE POLLARD AFFAIR UNDERLIE THE STATED REASONS FOR WITHDRAWING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In withdrawing his nomination to be secretary_of_defense , Bobby Inman gave one of the most memorable press_conference since Richard Nixon told reporters they would n ' t have him to kick_around any more back in 1962 . Inman is not the first man of military background to fret over his press_clippings . Years of deference and snappy salutes are poor preparation for a hosing_down by the Fourth_Estate . The press has used the deadly term rambling to describe Inman ' s hour-long performance in Austin , Tex. , on Tuesday . That is a bit unfair , in that Inman laid_out his peeves in coherent fashion . But prominent citizens are not supposed to dwell in obsessive detail on their press coverage . Inman , however , also may have been sending up smoke_screens , and the journalists at the press_conference were too thunderstruck by his performance to ask even a_few simple questions about other reasons why he might be withdrawing . On the face of it , Inman ' s business career since his retirement from the CIA in 1982 did raise questions about his judgment . Supposedly a man of laser-like intelligence , Inman sat for richly remunerated years on the &quot; proxy board &quot; of International Signal and Control , a firm engaged in fraudulent misrepresentation and whose founder , James Guerin -- a man for whom Inman vouched_in court -- is now serving a 15-year prison_term in Florida . Inman could scarcely complain about &quot; the new McCarthyism &quot; in the press_on this since , apart from articles in the_British press and a column by this writer , the details of his relationship with ISC and Guerin were politely avoided in the press . The meatiest portion of Inman ' s remarks concerned columnist William Safire , whom Inman charged with nourishing a vendetta against him since the late 1970s . Inman attributed part of Safire ' s animus to an action Inman took as William Casey ' s deputy at the CIA . In the wake of the 1981 Israeli bombing raid on Iraq ' s nuclear_reactor at Tuwaitha , Inman reviewed the targeting data requested by Israel from the United States in preparation for the raid . Inman found that intelligence information far exceeding the requirements of the raid -- for example , data about Pakistan and Libya -- had been furnished by U.S. intelligence , and he forthwith decreed that a 250-mile limit be imposed on satellite and kindred information provided to Israel . At his Tuesday press_conference , Inman claimed that Israeli Gen . Ariel Sharon had complained to his American friends about Inman ' s restriction . Safire ' s admiring relationship with Sharon is a matter of record in his own columns . There is a sequel that Inman did not explore . The Tuwaitha raid was led by Col . Avi Sella , who was later dispatched to the United States as controller of Jonathan Pollard , the spy who worked_at the Naval Intelligence Service and provided Israel with precisely the satellite intelligence being withheld under Inman ' s orders . In his Dec . 23 column in the New York Times , about which Inman made complaint and which seems to have contributed powerfully to his decision to stand down , Safire specifically accused Inman of contributing to the &quot; excessive sentencing &quot; of Pollard . In other words , the tensions between Inman and Safire speak_to a larger enduring tension nourished by U.S. Navy_men against Israeli governments and their claque here for such episodes as the bombing of the U.S. ship Liberty during Israel ' s Six-Day War and Pollard ' s espionage . Now for the miniseries that the admiral can rough_out in his retirement : connivance in high places ; the Dole-Safire deal ; the battle between Safire and Washington Post editor Bob Woodward to control the Pentagon . The Clinton crowd should never have picked a military_man with a career background in spookery . At least the country has been spared a man who claimed in Austin with a straight_face that he joined the elite Bohemian Club &quot; because I love the exposure to people who are talented in the arts. &quot; To Our Contributors The Times welcomes unsolicited manuscripts for possible publication on the Op-Ed Page .
