   <HEADLINE> LILLEHAMMER / ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS ; BIG THREE OF SKATING MELT ON ICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One year after winning the men ' s figure_skating gold medal in the 1988 Winter_Olympics , Brian Boitano became so bored with the mundane life of one-night stands on the ice_show circuit that he crusaded for a rule so progressive -- in a sport that usually moves at the speed of a glacier -- that it was named for him . Upon passage of the Boitano Rule two years ago , which allowed professionals to return to serious competition , he turned his attention to becoming the first man in the event since Dick Button 40 years before to earn a second gold medal . Fifty seconds into that attempt Thursday night in the Olympic Amphitheatre , Boitano ' s comeback was_on its knees , and so was he , the victim of a wayward triple axel that cost him dearly with the judges for the technical program . Boitano will skate in Saturday night ' s freestyle program , which counts toward two-thirds of the final score , but looking_up from eighth place , he has virtually no chance to win a medal . If it was any consolation to Boitano , the two men mentioned most often as his rivals for the gold , defending champion Viktor Petrenko of Ukraine and four-time world champion Kurt Browning of Canada , were in even more distressing situations , Petrenko in ninth and Browning in 12th . Browning was so disgusted with his performance , which included falls on two required jumps , that he all but quit on the spin at the end of his program . &quot; Unbelievable , &quot; he muttered to himself while taking his obligatory bow . Indeed , it was that . Now , the most likely gold-medal contenders are first-place Alexei Urmanov of Russia , second-place Elvis Stojko of Canada and third-place Philippe Candeloro of France . Fourth-place Scott Davis , who upset Boitano to win the U.S. championship last month , also could win if he finishes first in the freestyle program while Urmanov slips to third or lower . Those contenders will take some getting accustomed to , considering that none has ever won a major international title , Stojko and Urmanov coming_closest with their second- and third-place finishes , respectively , behind Browning in last year ' s World Championships . &quot; This is a new generation that came here ready , armed and dangerous , &quot; said Stojko ' s coach , Doug Leigh . &quot; They can step_up to the plate , too . There ' s more_than one bat in this game. &quot; But almost everyone else in the sport had been looking_forward to a showdown among the sure Hall of Famers -- Boitano , Petrenko and Browning . &quot; I ' m bummed , &quot; said Paul Wylie , one of their contemporaries as the silver medalist in 1992 at Albertville , France . &quot; I don ' t think Urmanov is extraordinary and I don ' t think Candeloro is extraordinary . &quot; The extraordinary skaters all blew_up under the pressure. &quot; Boitano , Wylie allowed , was not helped by the crowd , or the lack of one , as only about half of the 6 # 000 seats were filled when the American skated onto the ice as the first of 25 competitors . It was the bad_luck of the draw . &quot; Brian opened with one of the most incredible jumps in the sport , the Tano Lutz , and it was met with polite applause , &quot; Wylie said . &quot; When that happened , it was like he said , ' What am I doing here ? ' It looked_like he was somewhere else . that ' s the worst feeling you can have. &quot; But Boitano ' s coach , Linda Leaver , said he was so pumped for the triple axel that he jumped too high , throwing himself off balance . &quot; I don ' t know what happened to me , &quot; said Boitano , 30 , of Sunnyvale , Calif . &quot; It ' s like a blur now . You ' re like , ' This can ' t be happening. ' It ' s like you ' re not really there. &quot; Midway through the technical program , the Olympic Amphitheatre was almost filled because of the late arrivals , including Michelle Kwan , 13 , of Torrance , who reached Norway earlier Thursday and will begin practicing near Oslo today as the United States ' first alternate in the women ' s competition . So the atmosphere inside the building was much enhanced for those who skated later , including Misha Shmerkin , a Russian emigre who became Israel ' s first competitor in the Winter_Olympics . He is in 15th place . Six of the last seven skaters landed their triple axels , which requires 3 1 / 2 revolutions . Browning , who drew the enviable 25th position , was one of them . Then , inexplicably , he fell on his easiest jump , a triple flip , and later turned his required double axel into a single , joining Boitano and Petrenko among the also-rans .</TEXT>
