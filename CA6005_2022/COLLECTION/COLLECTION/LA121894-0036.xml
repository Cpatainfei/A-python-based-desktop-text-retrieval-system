   <HEADLINE> A QUESTION OF LIFESTYLE ; FOND MEMORIES OF MY OLD ROOMMATE , STEWART BRAND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When &quot; The Whole Earth Catalog &quot; was first published in 1968 , not a single_entry about the invasion_of_privacy was included . But now &quot; The Millennium Whole Earth Catalog &quot; devotes four entire pages to the ever-increasing political and corporate encroachments upon our privacy . What was once deemed paranoia turns_out to have been prophesy . Nevertheless , this Catalog -- edited by Howard Rheingold with a global network of experts -- is a veritable Yellow Pages of Optimism . In a foreword , founder Stewart Brand proclaims : &quot; Here are the tools to make your life go better . And to make the world go better . That they ' re the same tools is our theory of civilization. &quot; Those tools range from safe_sex to computer_technology , from mushroom growing to pirate radio , from alternative_medicine to urban ecology , from aging to computer &quot; zines. &quot; In 25 years the Catalog has evolved from servicing hippie communes to establishing virtual communities . In 1971 , Brand invited Ken Kesey and me to co-edit &quot; The Last Supplement to the Whole Earth Catalog. &quot; One day I sensed that there was something vaguely different about my papier-mache Donald Duck with eight arms . Then I realized -- he had 10 arms now . The additional two arms were actually two pairs of shoelaces . Kesey had bought a pair of shoelaces , but they came_in packages of three . I learned that such pranks were his way of sharing intimacy , along with practical hints like pouring cornstarch into his crotch because it &quot; works better than talcum_powder and you don ' t smell like a nursery. &quot; A_couple_of years later I was living_in a room in the basement of a yellow-painted San Francisco townhouse . At the time , Brand ' s marriage was breaking_up , and he moved to another room in the basement . We shared a bathroom . I gave him a key to my room so he could have access to the refrigerator , invited him to use my phone until he got his own and offered my king-size water_bed whenever I was away . I hadn ' t intended for this to be bread cast upon the water_bed , but when the townhouse was sold and everybody had to move_out , Stewart found an apartment on Rose Street -- actual roses were embedded in the tar along the street -- and he agreed to let me rent a small room that he used as a library . &quot; It ' ll be_on a trial basis , &quot; Stewart said , &quot; as long as our lifestyles don ' t conflict. &quot; I had been publishing the work of conspiracy researcher Mae Brussell in &quot; The Realist &quot; -- from the J.F.K. assassination to the Watergate break-in -- and in the process I had undergone a paranoid freakout from information overload . Now she was warning me against sharing an apartment with Stewart . &quot; I can smell a rat , &quot; she said , &quot; and for_sure Stewart Brand is a government pig . Be really careful how much you tell him of yourself or your business . His kind can really hurt you in many ways . And do not put it past him . You are working in a dangerous area now , and certain precautions are necessary. &quot; &quot; What are you saying ? Am I in some kind of physical danger ? &quot; &quot; No , but he ' ll try to psych you out. &quot; I defied my conspiracy guru and took the room anyway . Three of the walls were lined with bookshelves that Stewart had built . One night the heaviest shelf collapsed with its contents falling all_over my narrow cot . Had I been there , I might have been killed by his double-volume set of &quot; The Ancient Art of Warfare &quot; alone . On the available wall I taped a photo of my daughter , Holly , and a_couple_of posters . One was a Native_American . The other was President Nixon , with a quote from his inaugural_address : &quot; I think_of what happened to Greece and Rome and you see what is left -- only the pillars . What has happened , of course , is that great civilizations of the past , as they have become wealthy , as they have lost their will to live , to improve , they then have become subject_to the decadence that eventually destroys the civilization . The United States is now reaching that point. &quot; Stewart and I were a touchstone of contrast . He was tall ; I was short . He had closely-trimmed straight blond hair ; I had long curly brown hair . His craggy features resembled a Nordic god ; mine a friendly gargoyle . He wore a wristwatch even when he slept ; I didn ' t wear one even when I was awake . He was neat , threw stuff away and kept organized filing_cabinets ; I was a sloppy pack_rat with a filing_cabinet that remained empty . He was carnivorous and ate meat ; I was a vegetarian and ate meat , but only once a weak , usually his leftovers while he was at the Zen Center a block away . He had a strange sweet_tooth . In college , his favorite snack was a slice of white_bread with butter and sugar on it . Now he preferred chocolate chip yogurt and sesame-graham cookies and unbaked frozen-cookie dough . He occasionally smoked cigarettes and drank wine . I never did any legal drugs , but he turned me on to hot-buttered rum and gave me a jar of batter for Christmas . We would each entertain our own guests . I would be in my room , interviewing Manson family member Squeaky Fromme , and he would be in his room , interviewing renowned anthropologist Gregory Bateson . I would share with Stewart my latest conspiracy theory , and he would give me a copy of Scientific American with an article on the mathematics of coincidence . And we inadvertently affected each other ' s sensibilities . Once I came_home , looking_forward to a relaxing carrot bubble_bath , but the tub was filled with his potted plants , nourishing themselves on water while he was away , and I didn ' t have the heart to disturb them . Conversely , when he was driving and stopped to help a stranded motorist with a jump-start , he admitted that he would n ' t have done so if I hadn ' t been in the car , and recalled the time he noticed me absent-mindedly turning_over thumbtacks on the windowsill so nobody would stick their fingers . There was , however , one particularly perverse idiosyncrasy that we had in common . I kept my awards -- from the Feminist Party Media Workshop ( for journalism ) and from Playboy ( for satire ) -- buried in a desk drawer . And Stewart kept his -- the National Book Award for &quot; The Last Whole Earth Catalog &quot; ( first prize in the contemporary affairs category ) -- hidden in his closet , an especially ironic gesture since there was resentment in the publishing industry that this non-literary effort had received the highly coveted award . One of the three jurors on the selection panel resigned in anger . Roger Strauss , president of Farrar , Strauss &amp; Giroux , complained : &quot; Look , it ' s a book I would have loved to publish for all_the obvious financial reasons , but it ' s a mishmash for coffee tables. &quot; I asked Stewart why he didn ' t display the plaque on his wall . &quot; Um , &quot; he explained . &quot; I ' ve observed that when I visit people whose offices are adorned with awards , diplomas and photos with famous names , my opinion of them goes_down . My National Book Award stays in the closet so I can retain self-respect. &quot; It was as though I deliberately kept testing the boundaries of Stewart ' s declaration that the duration of our living arrangement depended_on the non-conflicting nature of our lifestyles . I had been experimenting with THC , the ingredient in marijuana which gets one high , in powder form . On the night that the improvisational ensemble , the Committee , was to have its final performance , and while Walter Cronkite was concluding the news with his customary , &quot; that ' s the way it is , &quot; I snorted all_the THC I had left , in preparation for a personal pilgrimage to the Committee theater for the end of a satirical era . The last thing I remember was brushing my teeth , talking to Stewart and being overwhelmed by the drone of his electric saw . I woke_up in a strange bed at 3 a.m. Since I was out at the time , here ' s his description of what happened : &quot; I had been building a bed while you stood_in the hall doorway reporting the latest turns_in your hassle with Scientology . After a prolonged peculiar silence , I peeked in the hall to find that you were gone , replaced by a vacant-eyed robot which opened and closed its mouth , made a drifty gesture with a tube of toothpaste and said , ' Nn . . . . Gn . . . . ' Terrifying . All I could think was that the Scientologists must ' ve finally zapped you . After a while the thing -- you -- toppled like a tree , crashed and commenced baying into my buffalo rug . I phoned a friendly shrink for consultation . He listed to symptoms -- you were by now into a howly slow-motion laugh , ' Haaaaaa haaaaaa haaaaaa haaaaaa ' -- and the shrink suggested I take you to the UC hospital for evaluation . Which I did , with the aid of a_couple_of students from the Zen center . I would ' ve put you to bed , but I thought you were having an epileptic fit. &quot; &quot; Did you stick a TV Guide in my mouth like you ' re supposed to ? &quot; &quot; You were doing fine with the buffalo rug. &quot; On another occasion , I read that six members of Vietnam Veterans Against the War had been charged with conspiracy to use a variety of bizarre weapons , including fried marbles , to attack the 1972 Republican convention , and I immediately assumed it was a frame-up by provocateurs . Fried marbles ? Of course ! My perception of the logic of those in power was that if they accused the veterans of having fried marbles as a weapon , the public would think it was too bizarre not to be true . When I first learned that Richard Nixon ' s favorite meal was cottage_cheese with ketchup , I tried that , so it was only natural that I would now fry me up some marbles . &quot; Just don ' t use my Teflon pan , &quot; Stewart requested . I went shopping and found a place that sold marbles . I asked_for the kind that were best for frying . The clerk laughed_at what she had to believe was my idea of a joke . I returned home and melted butter in my saucepan . Then I fried two marbles . Apparently the purpose in weaponry was that when a fried marble is catapulted from a slingshot it will shatter upon hitting the target . The poor_person ' s cluster_bomb . &quot; Paul ! &quot; Stewart said in his best prissy Tony Randall voice . &quot; You sauteed those marbles . A warm buttery marble is hardly an instrument of aggression . You should ' ve added sliced mushrooms . At least follow the correct recipe : Deep-fry the marbles in fat hot enough to smoke slightly and then plunge them in cold water . ZZkk ! Ornamental little weapons. &quot; While Stewart and I were roommates , I wrote &quot; Tongue Fu , &quot; a fable serving as an allegory for my conspiracy research and as a catharsis for my paranoid freakout , but the exorcism went_into reverse when Nixon ' s Vice_President , Spiro Agnew , resigned in the face of a tax scandal , Gerald Ford was appointed to replace him , then Nixon resigned , Ford became President , he selected Nelson Rockefeller as his Vice_President , and for the first time in American history we had a pair of executives in the White_House who were not elected . I had a slight relapse of paranoia . In keeping with the trickle-down theory of conspiracy , I became suspicious of Stewart . Specifically , he had decided to publish &quot; Tongue Fu &quot; ( with an apologia for its bawdiness ) in &quot; The Whole Earth Epilog , &quot; and now I managed to convince myself , without the slightest rational basis , that he had changed my ending . I decided to confront my paranoia . On an afternoon that he was staying home , I took a bus to Sausalito . I walked to his office-on-a-houseboat and checked_out the galleys . Nothing had been changed . I felt silly , but I was OK again . Back in the apartment , I didn ' t mention my little journey to Stewart . But I sensed that there was something vaguely different in my room . Then I finally realized what it was -- my Richard Nixon poster . The President ' s eyes , which were usually looking toward the right , were now looking toward the left . I examined the poster more closely and was able to discern that the original eyeballs had been whited out from the right side , and new eyeballs had been drawn at the left-hand corners . Then I checked to see whether the eyes in Holly ' s photo had also been changed , but no , she was still looking directly at me . So was my Native_American guide . Only Nixon ' s eyes had been altered . It seemed out of character for Stewart to have done this , but I asked him anyway . &quot; No , I didn ' t do_it , &quot; he said . &quot; But Kesey was around for a while. &quot; &quot; Kesey ! Aha ! I should ' ve recognized the telltale trail of cornstarch. &quot;</TEXT>
