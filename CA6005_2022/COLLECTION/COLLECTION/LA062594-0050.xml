   <HEADLINE> COUPLE CHARGED WITH FILING 2 # 601 FRAUDULENT REQUESTS FOR ASYLUM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In one of the largest cases of such immigration fraud , a federal grand_jury Friday indicted a San Bernardino couple_on suspicion of filing more_than 2 # 600 bogus claims for political asylum . Authorities charged that the couple -- doing business as General Office Services out of sites in El Monte , Azusa and Santa Ana -- employed a now-common scheme : Duping applicants , mostly illegal immigrants from Mexico , into thinking they were merely applying for permits to work in the United States . Instead , authorities said , the suspects charged clients up_to $ 1 # 150 to file the phony applications for political asylum . &quot; The immigrants themselves have been duped by these preparers and are victims in this whole scenario , &quot; said Rosemary Melville , who heads the Los Angeles asylum office of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service . After obtaining clients ' signatures on the application_forms , authorities said , the suspects filled_in data about the purported political asylum claims . Most of the documents featured identical assertions , officials said , contending that applicants were opposition party members in Mexico and had been beaten by Mexican police . All feared for their lives if they returned home , the applications stated . Many applicants receive work_permits as a result of their applications while their cases are being considered . However , work_permits in this case were later revoked -- and the applicants made subject_to deportation -- once officials determined that the asylum claims were bogus . The number of asylum applicants from Mexico has been growing sharply , authorities say , though Mexican nationals seldom qualify for political asylum . Foreigners persecuted in their homelands because of their race , creed , political opinions or membership in social_groups may qualify , allowing them to remain and work in the United States . Charged were Cecilia Parra Sanchez , 45 , and her husband , Emilio Parra Garcia , 27 . He was arrested earlier this month at his San Bernardino residence but his wife remains a fugitive , authorities said . Federal_agents searching the couple ' s home discovered copies of 2 # 601 fraudulent asylum cases that had been filed with the INS , U.S. Atty . Nora M . Manella said .</TEXT>
