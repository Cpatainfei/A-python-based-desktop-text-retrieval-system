   <HEADLINE> DERIVATIVES LIMIT FOR BANKS NOW CONSIDERED ; INVESTING : CHIEF REGULATOR , WHO HAD SAID THE HIGH-RISK SPECULATIONS WERE NO THREAT TO THE INDUSTRY , DOES AN ABOUT-FACE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a surprise move , Comptroller_of_the_Currency Eugene B . Ludwig said Wednesday he is considering placing strict limits on the ability of national_banks to speculate in &quot; exotic and complex &quot; derivative_instruments . The high-risk financial speculations -- which are resulting in big trading losses for major corporations such_as Cargill Inc. , Procter &amp; Gamble and Kidder Peabody &amp; Co . -- could be especially dangerous for banks , the nation ' s chief bank regulator warned in a speech . Banks can be involved two ways in the market for derivatives : speculating themselves or , for six of the biggest banks , creating the complex financial packages for_sale to others . Just a week ago , Ludwig and other bank regulators indicated they were keeping a close watch on the complex financial instruments but saw no immediate threat to the nation ' s banks . But his warning Wednesday in a speech to the Exchequer Club marked a significant change : the first time a top government official said speculation in derivatives might be placed off-limits for banks whose deposits are protected by federal insurance . * &quot; We are looking_at whether we should place capital or risk limits on ( banks ' ) proprietary trading activities and whether some_other type of regulatory response is appropriate , &quot; Ludwig said . Several major banks , including Citicorp , Bankers Trust and Chemical , are large dealers in derivatives , earning substantial fees for finding customers who want to speculate on or hedge against the future performance of commodities markets and interest_rates . Banks , along with other investors , have long used &quot; plain vanilla &quot; derivatives , such_as futures and options contracts , whose values are derived from changes in interest_rates and foreign currency values . Such securities , which require relatively little money down , allow investors to hedge against sharp moves_in financial markets by granting the owner the right to buy or sell securities at set prices in the future . Yet the explosion in ever-more-complex derivative contracts over the past two years has raised questions about their use in raw speculation , the severity of players ' potential losses if markets react in unforeseen ways , and the ability of parties on the other side of the transactions to honor promises to buy or sell the designated investment if necessary . Ludwig said he asked one of his staff experts in October about financial derivatives and was offered a list of 900 products . They had &quot; such interesting names as ' harmful warrants ' and ' worthless warrants , ' ' death backed-bonds , ' ' limbos ' and ' heaven-and-hell bonds ' -- descriptions obviously designed to inspire confidence , &quot; he said in a wry tone . Since last year , the tally of derivative_instruments &quot; has expanded by at least one-third , &quot; Ludwig said . Banks can be winners and losers at_the_same_time , earning fees as packagers and sellers of derivatives to others , but taking big hits on trading for their own accounts . Bankers Trust , Chemical and Citicorp all reported Tuesday that they had suffered big declines in their trading revenues in the first_quarter . On Wednesday , Chemical acknowledged that derivatives contributed to its problems . Ludwig said he will issue 20 pages of &quot; guidance &quot; to bankers next week , covering such topics as &quot; the duties of senior management and the board of directors for oversight of derivative activities &quot; and the monitoring of risks . Sources in the comptroller ' s office said the speech Wednesday did not represent a response to recent losses in the corporate world , but rather Ludwig ' s decision to deliver a definitive statement of his concerns after much research and preparation . Ludwig said his remarks were a yellow_flag , not necessarily the precursor of a ban .</TEXT>
