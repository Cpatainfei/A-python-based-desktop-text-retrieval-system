   <TEXT> A steep fall_in the dollar sent bond yields soaring and dragged stock and bond prices lower Monday . Oil prices also dropped on signs that a strike by Nigerian oil workers might be unraveling . The dollar edged back toward its record low against the Japanese yen as dealers grew pessimistic about the outlook for progress in U.S.-Japan trade talks . Market participants said American investment funds and Japanese exporters were heavy sellers of the U.S. currency , further depressing a dollar market glutted by persistent trade_deficits and the movement of long-term capital out of U.S. assets . The Mexican_peso strengthened against the dollar on the apparent election victory of Ernesto Zedillo , presidential candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party . It cost 3.338 pesos to buy a dollar in New York on Monday , compared to 3.359 on Friday . Zedillo ' s victory also sent Mexican stocks soaring , with the Bolsa index rising 50.79 points , or 1.88 % , to close at 2 # 758.97. Long-term U.S. Treasury_bond yields rose , pushing prices down for a fourth consecutive session as the tumbling dollar threatened to sap foreign demand for bonds and other U.S._government securities . But the decline in bonds was exaggerated by light trading volume , with many investors and traders vacationing ahead of Labor_Day . In thin activity , even relatively few bond sales can have a disproportionate impact on prices . The key 30-year bond yield rose to 7.55 % from 7.48 % on Friday , while its price , which moves_in the opposite direction , dropped 13 / 16 of a point , or $ 8.13 per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . Confronted with a lack of news or fresh economic data , the bond market ' s few participants focused_on the dollar , which began to weaken in Asia and continued to drop when trading shifted to European and U.S. markets . It closed_in New York at 97.83 Japanese yen , down from 98.65 on Friday and near its all-time New York low of 97.50 yen July 12 . The greenback also closed at 1.527 German marks , down from 1.539 on Friday . Persistent weakness in the dollar has discouraged overseas investments in Treasury_bonds , since U.S. securities become worth less when converted into foreign currencies that are worth more against the dollar . Meanwhile , the retreating dollar and surging long-term bond interest_rates scared_off buyers in the stock_market . The Dow Jones industrial average fell 3.89 points to 3 # 751.22 as 235.88 million shares changed hands , down from 279.65 million on Friday . In the broader market , declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 on the New York Stock_Exchange . &quot; Basically , the stock_market is trying to digest the problems in the dollar and bond markets , &quot; said Rao Chalasani , chief investment strategist at Kemper Securities . Lower stock prices abroad also hurt the U.S. market . In Tokyo , the 225-share Nikkei index ended down 118.12 points at 20 # 394.58. In Frankfurt , the 30-share DAX average fell 25.78 points to close at 2 # 123.79. And in London , the Financial Times 100-share average closed_down 20.1 points at 3 # 171.3. Among the market highlights : * Novell fell 1 1 / 8 to 14 . The company said late Friday that it expects fiscal third-quarter earnings to be as much as 20 % below analysts ' expectations . * Neutrogena rose 6 1 / 64 to 34 49 / 64 . Johnson &amp; Johnson will buy Neutrogena , maker of skin and hair_care products , for $ 924.1 million , or $ 35.25 a share . Johnson &amp; Johnson rose 1 / 8 to 49 1 / 8 on the NYSE . * Telefonos de Mexico ADRs rose 1 to 66 1 / 2 , Grupo Televisa rose 1 7 / 8 to 61 1 / 4 and Grupo Casa Autrey rose 2 1 / 4 to 34 . * Williams Cos. , which agreed to sell its WilTel network services business to LDDS Communications for $ 2.5 billion , ended unchanged at 31 1 / 4 . LDDS fell 3 / 4 to 23 1 / 16 . Meanwhile , the expiring contract for September delivery of light , sweet crude_oil plunged 71 cents on the New York Merc to $ 16.87 a barrel , the lowest settlement for a near-term contract since May 4 .</TEXT>
