   <HEADLINE> COUNTDOWN TO THE WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ' 94 ; BODINE IS THE LATEST TO GIVE SHIMER A PUSH ; BOBSLED : NASCAR RACER ' S EFFORTS GIVE U.S. A SHOT AT A MEDAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There was a time , before and during the 1992 Winter_Olympics , when Brian Shimer became known as the driver to the stars -- Herschel Walker , Willie Gault and Edwin Moses . Shimer could never be sure who was in his lineup as the U.S. Bobsled Federation campaigned for stronger , swifter and more illustrious athletes to help attract sponsors and propel Shimer down the_hill faster . Ultimately , push came_to shove : -- Moses stormed out_in a controversy over selection procedure . -- Gault failed to qualify in final ' 92 push trials . -- Walker joined Shimer in USA I at the Winter Games in Albertville , France , but his inexperience contributed to a seventh-place finish , and he was benched for the four-man event , in which a U.S. team driven by Randy Will finished ninth . Shimer , 31 , a Floridian who played football at Morehead State , approaches these Games as driver of USA I in both the two-man and four-man events . Walker , Gault and Moses are gone . Shimer has basically operated with the same pushers and brakemen for two seasons , experiencing unprecedented success in the winter of 1992-93 and major disappointment this season while preparing_for Olympic competition . The United States has not won an Olympic medal in bobsled since 1956 , and it is impossible to measure Shimer ' s chances off the disparity of the past two seasons . The only certainty is that much of the attention will continue to focus_on the sled itself . For the first time since ' 56 , the United States will use U.S.-made sleds -- courtesy , for the most part , of NASCAR driver Geoff Bodine , who became interested while watching the Albertville Games on television and has since spent $ 130 # 000 to seed development and production of six Bo-Dyn sleds and stimulate interest in what is known as the Bobsled Project , raising $ 500 # 000 . &quot; Win or lose ( in the Winter_Olympics ) , the project is a success , &quot; Bodine said . Translated : U.S. sledders , often operating in the past with European hand-me-downs or incurring years of debt to buy their own German- or Italian-made models -- Shimer spent $ 20 # 000 on a two-man sled -- will not have to shop elsewhere or shop , period . The financial foundation should enable them to drive_in the comparative lap of luxury , with the best of U.S. technology . &quot; It was ridiculous , depressing , &quot; Bodine said of a situation in which U.S. Olympians were often sent_out with second-rate equipment and the pressure of a second_mortgage . He was exposed to it after the ' 92 Games , during which he kept thinking that he could do a better driving job than the ones he was seeing on TV . He went_to Lake Placid , N.Y. , to prove it and , he said , &quot; scared myself to death. &quot; Winner of more_than $ 7 million on the NASCAR circuit , Bodine started from halfway down the_hill and ultimately left a sled borrowed from driver Bruce Rosselli resembling the sourest lemon on a used-car lot . &quot; I was shocked to find that it was kind of a piece of junk to start with , but I told Bruce I ' d build him a new one , &quot; Bodine said . &quot; I ' m sure he didn ' t believe me . I know they ' d all heard it before. &quot; In conjunction with Bob Cuneo at Chassis Dynamics in Oxford , Conn. , where Bodine had built some of his race_cars , Bodine proved to be a man of his word and wallet . The sleds , incorporating the latest in computer_technology and ongoing input from the sledders themselves , have been delivered with a pit crew and IBM support team , freeing the athletes from the often time-consuming before-and-after dirty work . Said Shimer : &quot; I ' ll take the ice at 90 m.p.h. anytime . It ' s the three or four hours working_on the sled after a full day of training that wears you down. &quot; The first Bo-Dyn was scheduled to make its debut in a World Cup race last Feb . 24 . Test runs convinced Shimer , &quot; It was the difference between a Yugo and Porsche , &quot; but it was disqualified for technical reasons by the European-dominated International Rules Committee before the races . Cuneo made the required changes , and the sled passed inspection in July , when Shimer unofficially blistered the Lillehammer track record in the World Cup tour trials , enhancing Olympic optimism and the euphoria generated by Shimer ' s World Cup championship of the previous winter . That euphoria , however , soon began to deflate . Shimer and two-man partner Randy Jones , a former Duke football captain , finished no better than seventh in four World Cup races , and his four-man team of Jones , former Iowa track all-American Karlos Kirby and former Indiana State hurdler Bryan Leturgez finished no better than 10th . The desultory performance by the entire U.S. team during almost two months in Europe prompted the federation to rework the January schedule . Instead of returning to Europe for the last of five World Cup races and remaining there to conduct U.S. Olympic trials and final preparations , the team has spent the last four weeks in trials and training at the 1988 Olympic facilities in Calgary , Canada , where there has been a rebirth of optimism amid significantly improving start times plus a fresh physical and mental outlook . &quot; I ' d say that we ' re back where we were at the start of last season , &quot; Shimer said , referring to his World Cup championship campaign . &quot; Hopefully , we ' ll continue to progress now . I feel better about our situation . We still have time to get_to where we want to be. &quot; The Olympic two-man competition doesn ' t begin until Feb . 19 . Shimer said there has been considerable improvement since early December , when he questioned the dedication and desire of his teammates in an interview with The Times . Then , he suggested that they were riding the World Cup success of the previous winter , seemingly satisfied merely to go_to the Olympics instead of working hard toward winning a medal , a view endorsed at that time by Coach Joey Kilburn . &quot; I was upset , and justifiably so , &quot; the intense Shimer said . &quot; The attitude is_better now , but the focus should have been there from the start . Of course , there were a lot of distractions , and that contributed to it . The way the World Cup schedule was this ( season ) , we were really burnt_out by the time we got_back from Europe . We hadn ' t eaten well , slept well or been able to train well , we were over there so long. &quot; Shimer was also troubled by a leg injury that affected start times throughout the season and ultimately prompted him to bring_in a neuromuscular specialist to maximize his training during January ' s Calgary encampment . Then , too , there was the debut of the Bo-Dyns , which reacted differently to the different conditions of different courses , requiring mid-competition adjustment and an ongoing process of fine tuning . It was recently decided , in fact , that the Bo-Dyn sleds to be driven here by Shimer and Jim Herberich will use the footing and axle from federation-owned Italian sleds because they were found to be more flexible than the original Bo-Dyn steel . &quot; The drawback ( to the sleds ) is that we haven ' t had enough time to do as much research as we would have liked , but ( the developers and crew ) have worked great under pressure , &quot; Shimer said . &quot; They ' ve been receptive to every suggestion . I mean , in 1988 the federation probably blew a_million dollars hiring scientists to build a new sled , but they never talked with the athletes . It was amazing the thing even went_down hill . If these sleds aren ' t faster than what we ' ve been using , it can ' t be done. &quot; Bodine was told it couldn ' t be done when he first proposed his project . He was told about the hours and money wasted on previous projects and received little encouragement from the U.S. Olympic Committee or the U.S. Bobsled Federation , whose executive_director , Matt Roy , now says the sleds have become &quot; a rallying force. &quot; &quot; People told us we were nuts , &quot; Bodine said . &quot; Now I travel around the country and am overwhelmed by the interest . I couldn ' t be prouder . &quot; As racers , we know it should be impossible to walk in and beat a country that ' s been building sleds or cars forever , but that ' s where we are ( with the bobsled project ) in less than two years . We have a chance , and that makes_it even more special . &quot; I mean , I always wanted to be an Olympic athlete but was too small and too slow , so that to feel now like I ' m part of it , to have done something for the country , that everyone seems to have gotten_behind , is a real honor. &quot; Bodine will be driving at Daytona Beach , Fla. , when the American-made sleds carrying his name race on the Olympic track at Hunderfossen . It is the third Winter_Olympics for Shimer , who said he probably would be teaching industrial arts and coaching high_school wrestling and football if he hadn ' t responded to a federation letter seeking a_few good men years ago . How did a Floridian -- there is now the incongruity of a hometown Naples Bobsled Club to help raise funds and cover his debts -- take_to the snow , ice and daunting challenge of a bobsled run ? &quot; I don ' t know that I had ever considered myself a daredevil , but I liked the speed and challenge , &quot; Shimer said . A pattern of controversy and corruption has plagued the U.S. Bobsled Federation ' s pursuit of the ultimate dream , a return to the Olympic medal stand . Walker , Moses and Gault represented $ 250 # 000 to the federation in a sponsorship deal with McDonald ' s , but when all three failed to make the team , McDonald ' s patriotic gesture was to cut its contribution to $ 30 # 000 . The federation eventually decided it couldn ' t run athletes in on a whim , that continuity and training were critical . Now a U.S. bobsledder must compete on the World Cup circuit to be eligible for the Olympics . &quot; If Herschel had made bobsledding his No . 1 sport , he probably would have become the best pusher in the world , but we didn ' t have even one race together prior to the ( ' 92 ) Olympics , &quot; Shimer said . &quot; It was assumed we ' d have the fastest start in the world , but it didn ' t happen because it comes_down to technique and timing . It ' s like running me into the Super Bowl . You can ' t just climb into a sled and be the fastest down the_hill . &quot; We ' ve always had superior athletes to the Europeans , but they produce the better starts because they stay_together and work_on it for years at a time . This has been the first time in my eight years that the same team has trained together for more_than a year. &quot; Shimer remains confident that this continuity will produce a medal . If so , Geoff Bodine will have to be looked_upon as an equally driving force .</TEXT>
