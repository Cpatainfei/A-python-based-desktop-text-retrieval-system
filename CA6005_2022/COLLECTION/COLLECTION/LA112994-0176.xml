   <HEADLINE> TURKEY ' S FOREIGN_MINISTER QUITS ; POLITICAL CRISIS BREWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mumtaz Soysal , Turkey ' s controversial foreign_minister , resigned with a characteristic flourish Monday , plunging the coalition government of this Muslim nation of 60 million into fresh political crisis . Soysal , of the Social Democratic People ' s Party , cited &quot; deep differences in our understanding of government &quot; in his terse resignation note to Prime_Minister Tansu Ciller , leader of the conservative True Path Party . She lost no time in accepting it . &quot; Mr. Soysal ' s departure was influenced by some basic approaches to foreign_policy , &quot; Ciller said in a statement . Soysal is suspicious of the United States , pro-Iraq and wary of foreign investment -- positions diametrically opposed to those of his coalition partners . The impact of the resignation is likely to be felt first in the domestic arena . The ruling coalition and Turkish politics in_general have been in turmoil since a dispute over electoral lists last week forced the postponement of parliamentary by-elections that were scheduled for next Sunday . Ciller has not announced a new election date , saying Turkey must concentrate_on more important issues . She wants to work to stabilize the nation ' s shaky finances by raising a hoped-for $ 5 billion from privatization of state businesses next year . Also needed are new laws on free competition , patents and copyrights -- vital if Turkey is to successfully conclude talks with Europe on a special trade status by the end of next year . But all these projects are overshadowed by the apparently insoluble weakness of the coalition and by Ciller ' s lack of any real alternative within the current arithmetic of the 450-seat Parliament . &quot; Only a general_election can solve the problem , &quot; wrote Hasan Cemal , one of Turkey ' s most respected commentators . Ciller had clashed with Soysal over several issues since she approved his appointment as foreign_minister four months ago . She had accepted him in the hope he would be less obstructive of her privatization plans inside the government . But the sharp , argumentative 65-year-old law professor continued to dilute Ciller ' s plans to privatize many state_banks and industries , which finally became law Thursday . Soysal also imposed visa requirements for U.S. and other Western nationals in pursuit of what he called a foreign_policy &quot; with honor. &quot; Soysal is also known to oppose the U.S.-led Operation Provide Comfort , whose 50 aircraft have flown from bases in Turkey to protect the Kurds of northern Iraq from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein . If the government survives , his departure will probably make renewal of the force ' s mandate easier in December . But almost all commentators believe Soysal ' s resignation marks the end of the road for the coalition government that has ruled Turkey since 1991 . Ciller has so far failed to find a new partner in Turkey ' s fractured Parliament to carry her through to the next general_election , due in 1996 .</TEXT>
