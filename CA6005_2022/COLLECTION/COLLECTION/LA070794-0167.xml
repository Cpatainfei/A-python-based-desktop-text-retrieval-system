   <HEADLINE> ENERGY OFFICIALS PLAN $ 31 BILLION IN CONTRACTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Energy_Department Wednesday announced plans to open bidding on contracts worth $ 31 billion over the next five years to operate its laboratories , storage centers and production facilities . Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary said that injecting competition into the lucrative business of managing the department ' s facilities will &quot; open the doors &quot; of those sites and save billions of dollars . It also will forge a new relationship between the government and its nuclear contractors . One Energy_Department official said that the reforms should reduce the annual costs of running the department ' s production and research network by at least $ 2.5 billion . But the savings will not go_to taxpayers . Instead , the money will be used in the $ 160-billion cleanup of the nation ' s contaminated Cold_War weapons facilities . Wednesday ' s announcement was the first time that the Energy_Department has declared that three of its largest and most complex sites -- Savannah_River , S.C. ; Hanford , Wash. , and a test site in the Nevada Desert -- will be opened_to competition . Contracts for those three sites are worth $ 17.5 billion over five years and likely will lead to competition throughout the department ' s sprawling production and research complex . The Energy_Department also said that it will seek to renegotiate existing contracts worth some $ 13.5 billion to encourage efficiency . The department already had announced that it was accepting bids for $ 8.4 billion in management contracts for its Rocky Flats nuclear_weapons production site in Colorado and its Idaho National Engineering Laboratory . In total , including those two sites , the department will put $ 40 billion worth of contracts on the block over five years . That figure tops the value of contracts that the Energy_Department has opened_up for competition over the last 25 years . Only seven times since 1968 has the department forced an existing contractor at one of its facilities to compete with others for the right to continue its management .</TEXT>
