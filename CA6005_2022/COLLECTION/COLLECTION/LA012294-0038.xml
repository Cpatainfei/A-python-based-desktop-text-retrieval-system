   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; TAME OFFERING OF A POWERFUL ARTIST ' S WORK ; UC SAN DIEGO EXHIBITS ONLY A SMALL SAMPLE OF THE ART OF POLISH SCULPTOR MAGDALENA ABAKANOWICZ .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Only a handful of contemporary Polish artists are known outside their native_land , and Magdalena Abakanowicz looms the largest . * Her massive fiber hangings from the 1960s , installations of heaped , knotted rope_in the ' 70s and , especially , her crowds of burlap figures from the ' 70s to the present have established her as one of the most evocative visions to emerge from postwar Europe . Unfortunately , a show of recent work_at UC San Diego ' s Mandeville Gallery gives only a thin sampling of her work ' s dense , earthy power . One of the themes Abakanowicz has explored with penetrating depth is the relationship between the individual and the group , and how traits of the individual shift and transmute in group situations . She is not dogmatic in her treatment of mass behavior , however , and she resists blanket statements about mass obedience that would be all too easy to make after life in German-occupied , then Soviet-dominated Poland . Her rows of headless figures bespeak deference to authority while they also suggest communal strength and resistance . With seven single-figure sculptures , the Mandeville show doesn ' t muster the critical mass necessary to sustain such a dialogue . It shows a softer side to Abakanowicz , who models her slim , androgynous figures as vaguely heroic . Their ancestors are in ancient_Greek statuary , their nearer relatives the attenuated bodies of Alberto Giacometti . Abakanowicz ' s figures stand on tree_trunks , within open boxes formed by slender iron rods , and on large iron wheels . Most are just under life-size , but one , a full-size male figure , stands on a wooden beam capped at either end with crudely hewn wooden wheels . Without heads , and with shoulders pulled_back so that their arms are nearly behind them or absent altogether , Abakanowicz ' s figures declare their presence starkly but with definite dignity . Modeled in burlap stiffened with resin , their skins are richly marked with creases and seams , disparate strands woven together into a semblance of unity . The figures have no backs , but stand like empty shells , a natural metaphor for the hollowness , both physical and spiritual , that racked postwar Europe . Abakanowicz is not without a vision for the future . Half of the Mandeville show is devoted to her proposal ( one of four finalists in a city competition ) for a forest of tree-like habitable structures marking the western entrance to Paris . The 25-story dwellings would be covered with vines and powered by wind and solar_energy . Plans for &quot; Arboreal Architecture &quot; show the vigorous , organic forms the buildings would take_on the outside and the practical division of space within . To live within artificial trees sounds at once primitive and futuristic -- a return to the cave after having been to the moon . What Abakanowicz proposes in a larger sense , as much in her figurative sculpture as here , is a renewed focus_on the basics : dignified democracy among humans and respectful collaboration with the Earth . * UC San Diego ' s Mandeville Gallery , La Jolla , through Feb . 27 . ( 619 ) 534-2864 .</TEXT>
