   <HEADLINE> FAA IGNORED WARNINGS ON 757 JET TURBULENCE ; SAFETY : ACTION WAS URGED BEFORE FATAL CRASHES IN O.C. AND BILLINGS , MONT. , INVOLVING PLANES FOLLOWING TOO CLOSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Federal Aviation Administration ' s top scientist warned -- prior to two fatal airplane accidents -- that wake turbulence from Boeing 757 jetliners would cause a &quot; major crash &quot; if the agency failed to take preventive measures , internal documents show . The documents reveal for the first time that experts within the FAA itself had -- before the tragedies in Billings , Mont. , and Santa Ana -- expressed serious concerns about the potential danger to planes operating behind 757s . Eleven days before the Dec . 18 , 1992 , Billings crash killed eight people and a year before the Dec . 15 , 1993 , Santa Ana accident claimed five lives , chief scientist Robert E . Machol received a special meeting with the FAA ' s hierarchy and predicted a &quot; catastrophe &quot; due_to 757 wake turbulence . Yet , it wasn ' t until after the Santa Ana accident that FAA Administrator David R . Hinson first drew nationwide attention to the problem , issuing a bulletin instructing air traffic controllers to routinely alert pilots to the threat posed by 757s . The plane ' s unique , fuel-efficient design creates invisible , &quot; horizontal tornadoes &quot; emanating from each wingtip that are more powerful and last longer than those made by other aircraft its size . &quot; It ' s true , &quot; Machol said in a recent interview . &quot; I was the first guy within the agency who got_up and said we ' re likely to have a catastrophe , a real catastrophe , probably involving a DC-9 or a Fokker , and lose 70 to 100 people , if we don ' t do something . &quot; I wanted to speak_to the associate administrators because I was scared. &quot; The 226 pages of FAA letters and memorandums were obtained by The Times under the Freedom of Information Act , after officials fought their release . An FAA spokesman said last week that the agency is investigating whether the records were withheld in violation of the federal disclosure law . Sources have also provided The Times with documents indicating that agency officials were concerned about how Machol ' s warnings might be viewed . On one of Machol ' s memos , an official jotted a cautionary note that Machol should temper his words lest someone interpret the document to be a &quot; smoking gun. &quot; The FAA has resisted efforts to increase separation distances between 757s and tailing airplanes because it could potentially decrease the number of flights at airports and cut_into revenue of the fiscally hobbled airline industry . Even mid-sized passenger jets such_as MD-80s , DC-9s and Boeing 737s , which can carry 100 passengers or more , can be &quot; rolled &quot; and knocked_out of control when they encounter the 757 ' s &quot; wake vortex. &quot; The hazard is greatest during landing and take-off when the smaller plane can inadvertently fall below the 757 ' s flight_path and find itself entangled in a danger_zone of swirling , hurricane-force winds . Tony Broderick , the FAA ' s associate administrator for regulation and certification , attended the Dec . 7 , 1992 , meeting and recalled Machol ' s &quot; expressing concern about wake vortices on a 757 , &quot; he said . But Machol failed to provide &quot; specific data &quot; to justify the agency ' s immediate intervention , Broderick said . Yet , when Hinson recently announced a set of new policies on 757s , including a requirement that pilots of smaller planes landing behind 757s maintain a greater distance , it came_with no new &quot; data &quot; -- other_than the two fatal_accidents and three other serious incidents over the past 18 months . Most of the new policies , which require air traffic controllers to be more cautious when dealing with planes trailing 757s , take_effect this summer . In retrospect , Broderick acknowledged , the FAA could have acted sooner . &quot; I think it ' s certainly fair to say that these two tragic accidents caused us to place more emphasis on the wake vortex R &amp; D ( research and development ) project than we had in the past , &quot; Broderick said . The combination of the accidents , Machol ' s concerns and the existing research on 757s , he said , &quot; convinced us that there were an awful lot of holes in our knowledge. &quot; Leo Garodz , a former FAA manager who expressed his concerns about 757 wake turbulence to the FAA in 1991 as a consultant , was surprised to learn that Machol had raised red flags on the agency ' s wake turbulence policies as far back as 1989 . &quot; They had their own guy saying the same thing and they still kept it quiet . that ' s amazing , &quot; said Garodz , a former fighter_pilot who worked in the FAA ' s wake turbulence program for two decades before retiring in 1986 . Machol , who retired from the FAA on April 30 , said it was not unusual that his warnings went largely unheeded . &quot; Well , it is in_general true that the FAA does not put a significant amount_of_time and money into something until they have a tragedy , &quot; he said of his former employer . Reflecting the sobering calculus that the FAA and the airline industry employ , Machol said that the 13 deaths in 18 months was not an alarming enough figure to prompt drastic action . &quot; The 13 ? that ' s not much , really , &quot; he said . Overall , he said , &quot; we fly about 500 million people a year in the United States , and we kill about 100 , on average . that ' s not a bad number. &quot; By its own admission , the FAA may have violated disclosure statutes by withholding the records in January and February when The Times first requested them . The agency surrendered the records in May after the newspaper appealed the FAA ' s initial response to Hinson . Asked why the records weren ' t released the first time , FAA spokesman Hank Price said : &quot; We ' re determined to respond to that question . We ' ve launched an internal investigation . Until we ' ve done at least an internal audit , we don ' t have an answer . &quot; We take FOIA matters very seriously , &quot; Price said . &quot; We ' re all very disappointed by this thing . There are very specific legal requirements on what can be withheld and it ' s very narrow. &quot; Machol , who was involved in the FAA ' s initial response to The Times ' FOIA request , said he believes the records may have been deliberately withheld , a charge Price said the agency could not confirm or deny at this juncture . &quot; I urged them to send it all . . . the first time around , &quot; Machol said . &quot; Cliff Hay didn ' t want ( The Times ) to have them. &quot; Hay is the manager of the FAA ' s wake turbulence program . &quot; I gave ( Hay ) my entire file , &quot; Machol said . Hay denied opposing the release of any documents . &quot; I had no part in restricting anything , &quot; he said . &quot; It doesn ' t do us any good to withhold information. &quot; The FAA has identified an additional 22 internal documents on the subject of 757 turbulence but refuses to make them public , saying they are exempt under the disclosure law because they &quot; contain advice , opinions and recommendations made by staff_members in the course of reaching final positions. &quot; Besides the documents provided by the FAA , The Times obtained from independent sources an Oct . 3 , 1989 , memo suggesting that the agency was sensitive to public perception on the issue of wake turbulence . The memo , written by Machol and addressed to the FAA ' s associate administrators for aviation safety and air traffic , at one point quotes Machol as saying he didn ' t understand why there weren ' t more wake turbulence disasters given the FAA ' s wake turbulence policies . &quot; At the present_time I do not understand why we have so few catastrophes , &quot; Machol wrote . &quot; It is true that since the DC-9 went_down in Fort_Worth in 1973 ( killing all aboard ) , we have not had a large aircraft crash because of a wake vortex encounter ; but we have had a number of fatalities in GA ( general aviation ) and commuter-type aircraft , and a number of vortex encounters . . . where ' coffee was spilled , but not blood. ' &quot; At the top of the memo , someone has written by hand : &quot; Bob : A note of caution -- please watch your wording -- I don ' t want ' smoking guns ' in our files. &quot; Machol , who remembered the memo when interviewed by The Times , declined to identify the author of the handwritten note . FAA officials said they are unable to determine exactly who it was . The FAA ' s Broderick speculated that the author of the note simply objected to Machol ' s use of &quot; unprofessional &quot; language . The records that were released by the FAA indicate that Machol , as far back as June , 1990 , had urged the regulatory_agency to increase spacing between 757s and trailing airplanes . Among them : * A June 18 , 1990 , memorandum from Machol to then-head of the wake turbulence program , Rick Page , citing a wake turbulence incident four days earlier involving a Simmons 206 aircraft and a 757 . It reads , in part : &quot; Possible injuries to a flight_attendant on Simmons 206 . . . after the pilot almost lost_control of the aircraft due_to wake turbulence while on approach to Chicago O ' Hare Airport . &quot; We must do something about spacings behind 757s. &quot; * An Aug . 8 , 1990 , letter from Machol to Paul Thomas of the United Kingdom ' s Civil Aviation Authority in which Machol said the &quot; 757 has been the lead aircraft in a startlingly large_number of wake-vortex incidents. &quot; * An Oct . 25 , 1993 , report by Machol on wake turbulence in which he said , &quot; If the lead plane is a 757 and the trailing plane is a light DC-9 at three miles , &quot; and certain weather_conditions exist , &quot; the situation could in my opinion be very dangerous. &quot; * Another passage in the same report refers to the special meeting Machol requested with high-level FAA officials before the 757-related accidents had occurred and contains his prediction : &quot; I lectured to the FAA ' s associate administrators on Dec . 7 , 1992 , on wake vortices and predicted a major crash within ten years , most probably a . . . aircraft with tail-mounted engines behind a 757 at a high-altitude airport. &quot; Eleven days later , the first of the two fatal 757 encounters happened at Billings , Mont. , involving a Cessna Citation with tail-mounted engines ; the plane involved in the Santa Ana accident a year later , a Westwind , also had tail-mounted engines . Among the five casualties in the Santa Ana crash were the top two executives of the In-N-Out Burger chain . Also in the FAA ' s files : a reprint of a 1991 article from the Flight_Deck , a publication of the American Pilots Assn. , in which the pilot of a DC-9 recounted a run-in with 757 wake turbulence . The pilot , Capt . Steve Johnson , concluded : &quot; It is my opinion that . . . separation standards are not adequate when following 757 aircraft. &quot; In a telephone_interview from his Washington area home , Machol said he had based his 1992 prediction on British reports of scores of 757 turbulence encounters dating_back to the early 1980s when the 757 was first released . &quot; I was concerned about a DC-9 going_down , &quot; he said . Most recently , on Nov . 24 , 1993 -- three weeks before the Santa Ana crash -- Machol sent a report to the FAA ' s director of the Office of International Aviation and characterized the 757 as a special problem that needed to be addressed . Besides the two fatal 757-related accidents that have occurred since December , 1992 , the National Transportation Safety Board has investigated at least three other serious incidents involving 757 turbulence . The NTSB recently released its report on one of the three incidents . It involved a Boeing 737 carrying 133 passengers that performed an &quot; uncommanded roll &quot; while landing behind a 757 at Stapleton International Airport in Denver . Only moments from touch-down , the plane was flying at an altitude of 1 # 000 feet when it suddenly and violently banked left and plummeted 200 feet . The 737 captain , Lynn T . Williams , 48 , told investigators he feared the plane would flip_over before he and co-pilot Bruce R . Forbes , 37 , were able to regain control of the craft , abort their approach and circle back for a successful landing . &quot; I would like to say that whatever caused this incident scared the hell out of both of us , &quot; Capt . Williams said of his co-pilot in a written statement to the NTSB . &quot; I was not sure that this aircraft was going_to remain right side up. &quot; Based in part on such harrowing accounts , the NTSB in March urged the FAA to require minimum separation distances of between four to six miles behind 757s , depending_on the size of the trailing aircraft . But the FAA ' s new policy calls_for only a three- or four-mile separation depending_on aircraft size . The additional mile of spacing is an interim measure until results of tests on the 757 show whether more separation distance is warranted . Asked if the new policies would make_it safe , the FAA ' s Broderick paused and said , &quot; It ' s as safe as we know how to make_it given the data that we ' ve got. &quot;</TEXT>
