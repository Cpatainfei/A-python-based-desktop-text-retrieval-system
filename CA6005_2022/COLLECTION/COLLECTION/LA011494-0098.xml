   <HEADLINE> NEW VISION FOR THE OLD_WORLD ; U.S. FOCUS SHOWS SUBTLE SHIFT TO NEXT GENERATION ; POLITICS : WHILE CLINTON IS CLEARLY BACKING YELTSIN , THE AMERICAN IS HEDGING HIS BETS BY RUBBING SHOULDERS WITH UP-AND-COMING LEADERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton ' s first summit visit to Russia on Thursday reflected two concerns that have come_to dominate U.S. policy toward its troubled former adversary : keeping_up the pace of economic reforms to erase the legacy of communism at any cost , and quietly preparing_for the day when President Boris N . Yeltsin is no longer in power . In the short term , Clinton ' s hopes for Russia remain solidly with Yeltsin , and the President spent almost eight hours extolling his leadership and bonding with the Russian leader , including a brisk 20-minute walk through snowy Kremlin courtyards and a three-hour-long banquet that boasted caviar and braised moose lips . But in more subtle ways , Clinton and his aides are beginning to focus as well on the next generation of Russia ' s leaders -- from Yeltsin ' s own lieutenants to the rising stars of the newly elected Parliament . &quot; The theme of this summit is : Beyond Yeltsin , &quot; said Andrei Kortunov , a leading Russian expert on East-West relations . &quot; It isn ' t explicit . But if you look_at Clinton ' s agenda , the people he is meeting and the things he is saying , it shows that the Americans are moving away from their dependence on one man and preparing_for what comes later. &quot; A senior U.S. official agreed . &quot; Yeltsin won ' t be around forever , &quot; he said . &quot; We want to do what we can to support all_the forces of reform , so that after Yeltsin is gone the process will continue. &quot; Clinton is not abandoning Yeltsin ; far from it . Indeed , critics in both Moscow and Washington complain that the Administration still relies too_much on the Russian leader . But Yeltsin ' s health has been notoriously uneven . Some U.S. officials doubt that he will run again after his term ends in June , 1996 ; some Russians wonder whether he will survive until then . Thus , officials noted , one of Clinton ' s most important events on Thursday was a reception at Spaso House , the residence of the American ambassador here , where the President met dozens of members of the new Russian Parliament -- including , along with reformers , one unreconstructed Communist and a polite young associate of fiery ultranationalist Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , whose party shocked many with its strength in December ' s parliamentary election . Zhirinovsky , who has proposed reconquering all_the lands of the old Russian Empire including Alaska , was pointedly not invited . But by welcoming one of his followers , Clinton sent a signal that the United States is willing to work with Russian nationalists if they moderate their positions . At the same time , Clinton and his aides have been carefully cultivating the next generation of leaders in Yeltsin ' s camp -- while trying not to play favorites . At a briefing for reporters Thursday , one senior Administration official lavished praise on Deputy Prime_Minister Yegor T . Gaidar , a leading voice for economic reform -- and then added guiltily : &quot; I meant to say some nice things about ( Prime_Minister Viktor S. ) Chernomyrdin , &quot; Gaidar ' s main rival in the government . To many Russians , the main message of Clinton ' s visit is still an endorsement of Yeltsin that U.S. officials hope will bolster his standing against Zhirinovsky , the resurgent Communists and other extremists . &quot; The visit means that the West ' s confidence in Yeltsin remains valid after the ( parliamentary ) election , &quot; said Mikhail Berger , an editor of the leading newspaper Izvestia . &quot; This is very important for Yeltsin ' s team . It suggests to Russians that nothing terrible has happened , everything is going its due course. &quot; At the same time , Berger said , Clinton appears to be &quot; boosting Chernomyrdin as the most likely successor &quot; to Yeltsin . * Pavel G . Bunich , a leading reform economist who is critical of Yeltsin , said Clinton has done a good job of widening his contacts within the government but has not reached_out enough to the opposition . &quot; He ' s still betting all his money on one horse , &quot; he said . In a larger sense , the proliferation of American contacts with Moscow ' s politicians reflects the gradual normalization of U.S.-Russian relations -- from the Cold_War , when a cordial handshake between a President and a Soviet leader seemed to spell the difference between peace and war , to the kind of routine relationships the United States carries_on with most countries in the world . That change was reflected as well in Clinton ' s agenda for this meeting . The U.S.-Soviet summits of the Cold_War focused_on avoiding confrontation and averting the danger of nuclear war ; the U.S.-Russian summits following the collapse of the Soviet_Union in 1991 centered_on launching economic aid programs to move the former Communist states toward Western-style capitalism . * Now , the focus has moved once again -- to making existing Western aid programs work , especially in easing the privation suffered by ordinary Russians as old economic structures die . &quot; Russian-American relations have passed the period when their relations focused_on humanitarian and other assistance to Russia at the initial stage of reform , &quot; said Georgy Mamedov , deputy foreign_minister . &quot; Now they have moved_on to macroeconomic partnership , support for structural reform in Russia , transformation of relations between Russia , its neighbors and large countries of the world. &quot; The tone of the meetings has changed as well , U.S. and Russian officials said . &quot; What was different about today ' s meeting ? There were no cold faces and frozen formal phrases that were so typical of summits past , &quot; said Dmitry V . Ardamatsky , a presidential spokesman .</TEXT>
