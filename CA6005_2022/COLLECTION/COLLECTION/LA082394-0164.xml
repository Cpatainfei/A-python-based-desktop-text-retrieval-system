   <HEADLINE> GAS FIREPLACE IS BECOMING A HOTTER ITEM ; COMFORTS : CLEANLINESS , EASE OF USE FUEL GROWING POPULARITY . BIG FIRMS LIKE LENNOX ENTER MARKET THAT INCLUDES O.C. MAKERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Christopher Tower rebuilds his burned-out Laguna Beach home later this year , he plans to incorporate a beautiful wood-burning fireplace to complement the stunning Pacific_Ocean view from his new living_room . But in a nearby bedroom , Tower is forsaking the allure of a wood-burner for a unit that burns natural_gas . The second fireplace , Tower said , &quot; is mainly for ambience . . . a gas fireplace is easy to use and it ' s clean. &quot; Driven largely by ease of use , sales of gas hearth appliances are steadily increasing . In 1989 , only 5 % of factory-built fireplaces installed in U.S. homes burned gas . Now , gas hearth appliances account_for 26 % of all factory-built fireplaces . In about five years , gas units will probably account_for about half of all factory-built fireplaces installed in the United States , according to industry observers . Retailers also report strong demand for relatively inexpensive gas log sets and gas fireplace inserts , devices that convert wood-burning fireplaces to burn gas . The move toward gas appliances reverses a trend that began in the 1970s , when jittery consumers responded to a string of energy shortfalls by chopping and burning cordwood . One dramatic measure of wood ' s shrinking popularity : the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency believes that consumers in cold-weather regions were buying 1 million energy-efficient wood stoves annually during the early 1980s . But in 1993 , retailers sold just 130 # 000 wood-burning stoves . Sales of gas hearth appliances are fueled in large part by the high cost of wood -- a cord of oak costs at least $ 300 in Orange County -- along with growing environmental concerns . The high cost of fuel makes wood-burning prohibitive , gas proponents said , especially in Southern California , where fireplaces typically are used as decorative , rather than heating , appliances . But simple demographics also play a role . &quot; We ' re all aging , &quot; said Hearth Assn . spokesman John Crouch . &quot; Families that gathered and chopped their own heat in the form of firewood are finding that it just isn ' t as sexy an idea as it used to be. &quot; Gas hearth appliances are especially popular in upstairs bedrooms and rooms that are decorated in light , airy colors . &quot; You don ' t have to schlep wood up and ashes down and get everything dirty , &quot; said American Gas Assn . spokeswoman Julie Stewart . Gas units are getting a strong push from the nation ' s natural_gas utilities , some of which are offering rebates to customers who buy gas hearth appliances . The Southern California Gas Co . does not offer rebates but this past winter it did sponsor highway billboards promoting the use of gas logs . In some Western states , gas fireplace sales are also being driven by tough emission-control regulations akin to federal Environmental Protection Agency regulations that govern wood stoves . Two years ago , Las Vegas , one of the nation ' s fastest-growing cities , responded to a growing haze problem over the city by regulating emissions from wood-burning fireplaces . The regulations , which cover only new construction , mandate the use of catalytic_converters or secondary combustion chambers that cost as much as $ 1 # 000 . &quot; The Steve Wynns , Andre Agassis and resort moguls are still putting_in wood-burning units but the standard subdivision home has a gas-burning unit , &quot; said Michael Naylor , director of the Air_Pollution Control Division in Clark County , which encompasses Las Vegas . Las Vegas residents are taking the regulations in stride , Naylor said , because , as in Southern California , a fireplace is &quot; mainly an entertainment device &quot; that is seldom used as a primary heating source . But manufacturers are using technological advances to meet energy-efficiency demands of consumers in cold-weather climates . Santa Ana-based Fireplace Manufacturers Inc. , for example , continues to sell most of its units in warm climates . But the company is selling its gas fireplace units in Canada and Norway and hopes to enter the Chinese market through a joint_venture with a natural_gas company in Shanghai . Consumer demand for gas hearth appliances has sparked interest from some of the nation ' s largest heating , ventilation and air-conditioning manufacturers . Traditionally , the larger companies have ignored the market , which has long been dominated by smaller , regional competitors like Fireplace Manufacturers , Superior Fireplace Inc. in Fullerton and Robert H . Peterson Co . in the City of Industry . Earlier this month , Dallas-based Lennox Industries Inc. introduced its first gas-fired fireplace . The unit , which initially will be sold in Canada , will be marketed in the United States in 1995 . Industry sources said that Rheem Manufacturing Co . and Carrier Corp . are also developing gas fireplace units . Manufacturers credit increasing consumer demand to technological advances and crisp designs that result in attractive units that provide sufficient heat and are relatively inexpensive to operate . It ' s still more expensive for builders to install gas fireplaces in new homes than to incorporate gas-fired appliances , said Judy Bentley , gas product manager for Superior Fireplace . &quot; You ' re dealing with gas valves , burners , the guts of the gas-fired unit , &quot; Bentley said . &quot; But builders know that people want gas units . Wood-fired fireplaces are becoming a pain in the butt for many people. &quot; Gas-fired appliance manufacturers are using technology to develop products that provide higher efficiencies than wood-burning units . &quot; Fireplaces aren ' t just boxes with chimneys sticking_out of them anymore , &quot; said John Hornsby , chief operating officer of Fireplace Manufacturers , which next year for the first time will offer more gas models than traditional wood-burning units . &quot; Consumers increasingly are moving toward the gas fireplaces. &quot; Its newest models offer highly efficient burners that don ' t require expensive chimneys . Some units can be vented through walls ; others , while not yet legal in California , are vent-free and can be installed in the middle of a room . Fireplace Manufacturers ' units incorporate thermostats and hand-held , remote-control devices that turn flames on and off . Units without vents now on the market in some parts of the country include sensors that automatically shut_down burners if the oxygen levels in a room fall below safe levels . The industry has also devised a way to fix the age-old consumer complaint that a gas-fired unit ' s blue flame pales in comparison to the golden warmth of a wood fire . Researchers at the American Gas Assn. ' s research and development facility in Cleveland developed a technology that lets gas-fired units mimic the yellow-gold flame -- if not the distinctive odor -- of a wood-burning fireplace . Robert H . Peterson Co. , which has been manufacturing relatively inexpensive gas log units for 45 years , also is using the new , golden-flame technology and remote-control devices to bolster sales . &quot; If installed properly , our set will look_like wood burning in a fireplace , &quot; said Maurice Boekeloo , Peterson ' s vice_president of marketing . &quot; We think one of our ( sets ) burning in the fireplace is going_to give you the right environment. &quot; But , if ambience alone isn ' t sufficient , Boekeloo quickly falls_back on ease of use . &quot; There ' s no cleaning , no ashes , no hassle , &quot; Boekeloo said . &quot; When it ' s time to leave you simply turn it off. &quot;</TEXT>
