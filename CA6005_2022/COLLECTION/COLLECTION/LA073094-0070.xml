   <HEADLINE> EXTENDING THE LIFE OF AN EXTENSION_CORD ; SAFETY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Extension_cords seem simple to use , but if the cord is the wrong size or type for a job , or if it ' s improperly used , it can cause a fire . Some local codes forbid extension_cord use because they ' re considered a safety hazard . An extension_cord is intended only for temporary duty -- unplug and store it after each use . Don ' t run one where it may be tripped over . To avoid a severe or fatal shock , never use one near water . Here are some do ' s and don ' ts about choosing and using an extension_cord : * Be careful when buying an extension_cord . Just because it has several receptacle ends doesn ' t mean that it can carry more current than the outlet into which it ' s plugged . As a general rule , don ' t plug more_than one item into an extension_cord . * Most extension_cords are marked with a rating in amperes ( also called amps or simply abbreviated &quot; A &quot; ) . Look_at the nameplate . If not listed and you know the wattage , divide by 110 ( household voltage ) to obtain amperage . * Never exceed the ampere rating . * The longer the cord , the greater the drop_in current , which can reduce an appliance ' s efficiency . A 25-foot cord , for example , has to be heavier than a six-foot cord performing the same task . * An extension_cord contains a pair of wires , each covered with heat-resistant plastic insulation and wrapped in a plastic or rubber sheath . The cord is equipped with a male and female plug . If there is a three-prong plug , the cord also contains a third , ground wire . Plug this type of cord into a grounded ( three-hole ) plug . Use only three-wire extensions for tools and appliances that have three-wire cords . * If you must use an extension_cord for a refrigerator , freezer or some_other electrical unit that draws substantial amounts of current , make_sure it ' s a heavy-duty , three-wire type . * The thinner the cord , the lower its capacity for conducting electricity . Wiring in electrical cords is rated by numbers . The lower the number , the larger the wire and the greater amount of current it can safely carry . * A lamp-type cord usually contains a number wire . Don ' t use it for any device that draws more_than seven amps . * Heavier-duty numbers 16 , 14 or even 12 should be used for devices that draw higher amounts of current . * If an extension_cord feels warm_to the touch , replace it with a heavier one . * If at all possible , avoid using extension_cords in a workshop . If using one is unavoidable , make_sure that the cord has a three-prong plug and is at least a number 14 or heavier . * Hook the cord slack on a long spring screwed into the ceiling above your workbench to keep extension or power_cords out of the way . * If the cord has frayed insulation or a bare wire , replace the entire cord . If the plug is damaged , replace it with a new plug that has the same or greater current-carrying capacity . * Remove an extension_cord from an outlet by grasping the plug body . Otherwise , wires may tear loose and result in a shock or a short_circuit . * To keep them from tangling or wearing , store folded cords in napkin_rings or toilet_paper tubes , or hang_on an old tie_rack wrapped with masking tape .</TEXT>
