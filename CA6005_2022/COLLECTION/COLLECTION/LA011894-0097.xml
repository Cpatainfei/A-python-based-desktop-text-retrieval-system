   <HEADLINE> CHINA SIGNS TEXTILE PACT ; NARROWLY AVERTS U.S. PENALTIES ; TRADE : LAST-MINUTE AGREEMENT ALLOWS AMERICAN INSPECTORS INTO PLANTS TO INVESTIGATE MISLABELING AND OTHER EXPORT VIOLATIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> China averted a looming , multibillion-dollar battle over illegal textile imports on Monday , agreeing to allow U.S. inspectors into textile plants to investigate mislabeling and other export violations as part of a last-minute agreement signed by senior Chinese and American trade officials in Beijing . The negotiators concluded the compromise on the very day that stiff , U.S.-imposed penalties were to take_effect against Chinese textile manufacturers . American customs officials claim that last year China illegally exported more_than $ 2 billion worth of textile products to the United States , mostly by mislabeling goods or &quot; trans-shipping &quot; them through other countries to hide their Chinese origin . Among the many examples cited by U.S. investigators , one Chinese company labeled its products &quot; Made in the United Arab Emirates &quot; to avoid having its clothing items counted in the U.S. import quota . In retaliation for such violations , U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor threatened on Jan . 6 to slash China ' s textile quotas by 25 % to 35 % . The move was applauded by the American textile industry and would have cost the Chinese more_than $ 1 billion in lost trade . Textiles are China ' s most important export ; the United States is , by far , China ' s biggest market . China accounts_for 20 % to 25 % of all clothing purchased in the United States . At a Washington news briefing , Kantor called the pact &quot; a very important new bilateral agreement &quot; that was reached &quot; after three days of intensive negotiations. &quot; A senior American trade official in Beijing said Monday ' s agreement -- a three-year renewal of a U.S.-China textile pact that expired on Dec . 31 -- will substantially reduce the growth_rate of Chinese textile exports to the United States . &quot; China will continue to have good access to the market , &quot; the official said . But following a pattern established in other countries , notably South_Korea , China will get two warnings on illegal imports before a punitive reduction in China ' s textile quotas will be enforced . The penalty under the agreement would by a reduction equal_to three times the amount of goods illegally imported to the United States . In 1993 , the U.S. official said , American customs officials discovered more_than $ 581 million worth of illegal imports , about a quarter of the amount officials contend illegally entered the country . China exported $ 7.2 billion worth of textiles to the United States in 1993 , including an increasing array of silk goods not covered in the expired textile pact between the two countries . For the first time ever , the new agreement will also cover silk imports . American officials characterized this as a breakthrough . Kantor said that &quot; this silk apparel has been used because it ' s become so cheap a substitute for cotton and other apparel . . . . The growth in that from $ 900 million to $ 2.6 billion in just 24 months has had a serious effect upon the U.S. textile and apparel industry. &quot; The Chinese were able to claim a victory in the negotiations because they avoided cuts_in their textile quotas . The biggest concession gained by the Americans was a pledge by the Chinese to allow China-based U.S. customs officials to examine textile manufacturing_plants in surprise inspections . Under the agreement , said the senior U.S. trade official , American customs officers will be required to notify the Chinese government that they intended to inspect textile plants and indicate the city or region where the scrutiny would occur ; they would not be required to divulge the name of a targeted company or its specific location . Times staff writer Robert L . Jackson in Washington contributed to this story .</TEXT>
