   <HEADLINE> BATTERED , RAPED AND VEILED ; THE NEW SANCTUARY SEEKERS ; WOMEN INCREASINGLY ARE ASKING FOR ASYLUM FROM GENDER-BASED ABUSE , FORCING THE U.S. TO RE-EXAMINE ITS IMMIGRATION POLICY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A short , shy woman of 25 with dark hair , Aminah will not tell me her last_name or where she is from . She will only say that she is from West Africa . Initially , she cancels several interviews with me , telling her lawyer she ' s sick . The attorney suspects a case of nerves . When we finally do talk by phone , the young African woman speaks softly , hesitatingly . When Aminah ( her name and others in her account have been changed ) was a child , her father arranged for her to marry Abdul , a man 11 years her senior . Aminah ' s mother is from an Islamic tribe that practices arranged marriages . Families promise their daughters to men frequently in exchange for money or property . Though Aminah ' s father died when she was 9 , her family felt honor bound to uphold his agreement . Aminah knew_nothing about it until , at 14 , she was told she couldn ' t enter high_school because she was to marry . She was shocked -- Abdul had stayed_at Amihan ' s home when he was attending school in her village . She considered him a brother . &quot; Becoming his wife felt wrong . I didn ' t love him , &quot; says the young_woman . &quot; I felt and still feel that a marriage should be based on love. &quot; Aminah had seen her sisters enter arranged marriages to men who later physically abused them . Determined to become a lawyer like her uncle , she persuaded her family to delay the marriage so that she could continue school . In 1986 , when she was 16 , she began seeing a young_man named Omar . A year later , Aminah still refused to marry Abdul , and her mother and sisters began to beat her . &quot; They slapped me with their hands , and when I fought_back , they hit met with sticks or shoes , &quot; she says . &quot; Every time they beat me I would miss the next day of school because my body hurt so badly. &quot; Yet , Aminah went_on seeing Omar . &quot; We fell_in_love and decided we wanted to get_married , but we knew my family would never agree , &quot; she says . &quot; While his family would have supported our marriage , within my culture , one family cannot accept a woman into their home without the permission of her family. &quot; Aminah ' s mother took her to the police , who informed Aminah that she must marry Abdul or be incarcerated . But Abdul looked less appealing than ever : he had married . ( Polygamy is common in Aminah ' s country. ) &quot; His wife said he went_out at night and drank . He would come_back changed and beat her . She said he was an alcoholic , &quot; Aminah says . Horrified , the young_woman continued to resist the marriage despite pressure from both her family and the police . The family grew more outraged when Aminah gave_birth to Omar ' s daughter in 1989 . Aminah gave her to Omar ' s family to raise after her mother rejected the baby . &quot; It hurt very badly , but I knew I had to for her own sake , &quot; she says . Aminah ' s mother continued to press the marriage to Abdul , finally turning her over to the police . &quot; I was put_in a large cell with other women . Many were prostitutes , &quot; recalls Aminah . &quot; During the day , we were taken_in a big truck to the main police_station where we were made to clean the toilets. &quot; Ill and frightened , she gave_in to her mother ' s wishes . Her family set a wedding date and Abdul delivered money for the dowry . Then , in the summer of 1992 , when Aminah ' s sister was about to take her to buy a wedding_dress , Aminah slipped out of the house with the money intended for the dress . She reached a cousin who helped her get a U.S. visa and bought her a plane_ticket to New York . Last fall , the Immigration and Naturalization Service discovered that Aminah ' s visa had expired when she went_to pick_up a package at the airport . The agency began deportation proceedings . With no children , parents or spouse who are U.S. citizens , Aminah cannot legally stay in the country . But in a hearing this February , Aminah ' s lawyer , Nancy Kelly , will ask an immigration judge to grant her client political asylum . Kelly , who works with Harvard Law_School ' s Women Refugees Project , points_out that the African woman ' s family abused her with the help of the police and says there is no way Aminah can return to the country . &quot; If I go_back , my mother would make me marry that man . That life would be very hard because he ' s abusive , &quot; says Aminah , her voice shaking . &quot; And because I refused him , I know he will take it out on me by hitting me. &quot; She now lives with her sister in Massachusetts and is looking_for a job . She would like to join Omar in Europe but can ' t get legal_status there because the two never married . If she gets asylum , Aminah can retrieve her daughter from Omar ' s family and avoid her family ' s demands . &quot; There is no way I can return to the country without my family knowing , and there is no place for me to stay. &quot; Aminah ' s story is incredible , difficult for a westerner to fully comprehend . But does_it warrant political asylum ? that ' s the new question for refugee advocates and immigration officials . Moved by abuses such_as the systematic rape of women in Bosnia , and by the fact that more and more women like Aminah are seeking sanctuary because of gender-related problems , authorities have been re-evaluating the experiences women suffer . In 1991 , the United Nations High_Commissioner for Refugees advised countries to recognize gender-based persecution when it issued guidelines to protect refugee women . The European Parliament has called_upon member countries to grant asylum to women persecuted for violating the moral or ethical rules of their societies . Last year , Canada became the first , and thus far the only , country to adopt guidelines that specifically address the claims of female refugees . Under the Canadian guidelines , women who fear persecution for failing to obey gender-biased laws and those persecuted for opposing discrimination against women are eligible for asylum . But the new definition of political oppression doesn ' t stop there . Women who flee domestic violence after authorities fail to help are also eligible , as well as those who refuse to participate in certain traditions , such_as arranged marriages and veiling . &quot; The Canadian guidelines are groundbreaking because they recognize the role gender plays in women ' s lives around the world , and their experience of persecution , &quot; says Regan Ralph of the Women ' s Rights Project , a watchdog group started by New York-based Human_Rights Watch in 1990 . Now the United States is grappling with the issue . Under existing international_law , refugees seeking asylum must show a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race , religion , nationality , political opinion or membership in a social_group . In an unprecedented ruling last December , a U.S. appellate_court in Philadelphia recognized gender as a social_group and feminism as a political opinion under immigration rules . Last spring , the INS agreed to review how its policies affect women after it received a proposal from Harvard ' s Women Refugees Project , backed by 36 refugee and human-rights groups . After extensive consultations with such groups and legal_experts , the agency plans to issue guidelines covering women ' s claims next month . &quot; The idea is to increase sensitivity to women as applicants , &quot; says Gregg Beyer , INS director of asylum . Asylum as it ' s known now developed after World_War_II in response to the fact that thousands of Jews and others persecuted under the Nazi regime had been denied entry by officials enforcing immigration restrictions . Under the United Nations 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and a later protcol in 1967 , countries agreed to protect refugees who could prove persecution . Those applying for asylum in the United States must show that they have suffered persecution , not merely random violence , and that the persecution was by government officials or that those authorities were unwilling to intercede , among other criteria . Because most asylum applicants are male , persecution has been defined almost solely by men ' s experiences , which tend to involve public activities such_as organizing and demonstrating against the government . While women participate in such activities , they also suffer abuses that men do not , often at the hands of people with no official government connection . Their husbands abuse them and authorities deny help . They are raped or beaten by soldiers who want to terrorize communities or intimidate the women ' s politically active husbands . They are incarcerated or beaten_in the streets for refusing to follow official mandates they consider sexist , such_as veiling . Or , as Aminah ' s case , they are abused in the name of custom -- arranged marriages , genital mutilation , bride burnings . However , unlike the traditional public acts of oppression , many of these practices are performed not by the state , or an invading army , but by the girls ' own family -- mothers , aunts , sisters . They have thus been viewed_as personal or cultural , rather than as political matters warranting asylum . In 1987 , Sofia Campos-Guardado was visiting her uncle , who worked in a cooperative formed under El_Salvador ' s controversial land_reform program , when two men and a woman attacked his family . The three killed the men and raped the women while shouting political slogans . When Sofia applied for asylum , a U.S. appellate_court in New Orleans denied her request . It ruled that because the attack resulted from her uncle ' s political views and not hers , her rape was not political . The rapist ' s threats were deemed personal . &quot; The kinds of things that happen to women , such_as rape , genital mutilation and battering , are often not committed by state ( officials ) and so they ' re not considered human-rights issues , &quot; says Pamela Goldberg of the City_University of New York Law_School at Queens College . Adds attorney Kelly : &quot; In the past , you ' d take a strong women ' s case and turn it into a weak man ' s case because that fit the way the law was interpreted . Now , we ' re trying to show that what happens to women is different but qualifies. &quot; Meanwhile , scores of refugee women in the United States are waiting for officials to decide their fates . They are hiding , evading deportation , frightened for their lives . Will they tell their stories to the judge ? Perhaps . When they do speak , the stories that emerge are portraits of pain steeped in centuries-old discrimination and tradition . One of the first gender cases to command attention in the west came as Canada was developing its guidelines . Its immigration board had denied asylum to Nada ( a pseudonym ) , who fled Saudi_Arabia in 1991 after being beaten by religious police for refusing to veil . Lawyer Marie-Louise Cote appealed her case on humanitarian grounds , launching a massive publicity campaign supported by refugee and women ' s groups worldwide . However , Amnesty International ' s Canadian branch and the U.N. refugee group in Ottawa refused to back her . The U.N. group says intervention didn ' t appear warranted in Nada ' s case . &quot; Amnesty has a very specific and focused human-rights mandate , &quot; Alex Neve of Amnesty in Canada explains , &quot; and that mandate focuses_on detention and detention-related human-rights concerns . The response is not surprising . Human-rights organizations have only recently begun to focus_on women ' s issues . Domestic abuse , forced prostitution and bride burning have &quot; been seen as family problems , private problems , accepted as the norm and not challenged , &quot; says Ralph of the Women ' s Rights Project . Immigration Minister Bernard Valcourt rejected Nada ' s petition , stating that imposing Canadian values on other countries would be &quot; imperialist &quot; and would open immigration floodgates . But last year , responding to public pressure , he reversed his decision . Two months later , the Immigration and Refugee Board , an independent tribunal , issued the gender guidelines . Consideration of similar guidelines for the United States comes amid debate over abuses in the asylum program . With nearly 400 # 000 cases pending , the asylum backlog has skyrocketed , partly because asylum provides a way for people with no other claim for residency to stay in the country . Applicants are generally given a work authorization and allowed to remain until their cases are heard . Appeals can take years . Those denied asylum often stay illegally . Some observers say that gender guidelines will only exacerbate such problems . &quot; Expanding the definition throws kerosene on an already blazing administrative mess , &quot; says Dan Stein of the Federation for American Immigration Reform , a Washington , D.C. based group that advocates a moratorium on most immigration and has been consulted about the INS guidelines . &quot; When you have 100 million people who tomorrow would love to live_in this country , you cannot set_up an asylum system with such broad-based criteria without opening ( the system ) to massive abuse. &quot; Earlier this year , George High , executive_director of the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington , D.C. , wrote to INS asylum director Beyer arguing against U.S. development of gender guidelines . &quot; Recognizing that mistreatment of women is a worldwide phenomenon -- something by no means limited to the Third_World -- one can only question whether the advocates of gender-based asylum claims realize the massive claims they are inviting upon the United States , &quot; he protested . In fact , asylum is a small piece of the immigration pie -- 145 # 000 people filed such claims last year , while about 900 # 000 immigrated legally under other programs . And in its first year with the guidelines , Canada recognized 3509 gender claims . Of these , it decided 150 cases , with 105 granted asylum , including women fleeing arranged marriages , forced sterilizations and sexual violence . Members of Canada ' s immigration board have also ruled for domestic abuse victims in cases where officials failed to protect these women . Advocates discount critics ' fears that U.S. guidelines in this area would open asylum to every abuse victim , noting that women need to clearly demonstrate that authorities failed to protect them . That critical and difficult-to-prove link was evident in the case of an Ecuadorean woman whose husband repeatedly attacked her . The police had laughed when the woman pleaded for help , saying she must have done something wrong . &quot; There is a vast difference between a matrimonial home and a torture_chamber , &quot; the Canadian panel stands_in no different situation than a person who has been arrested , detained and beaten because of his political opinions. &quot; INS officials say they don ' t know if their guidelines will include domestic violence , although Beyer says they &quot; have to address government inability or unwillingness to protect women making certain claims. &quot; It is difficult for many people to view domestic abuse as a basis for asylum , Kelly acknowledges . &quot; It happens so_much here that people think it ' s not persecution , &quot; she says . &quot; But here , at least theoretically , women have recourse. &quot; The issue of domestic violence is at the tip of a larger controversy : When do cultural mores become political oppression and who decides ? Nurjehan Mawani , chairwoman of the Canadian tribunal and an immigrant from Kenya with long experience in refugee work , rejects the notion that the Canadian guidelines reflect a form of cultural imperialism . &quot; This is not simply a matter of imposing Western standards on other countries , &quot; she stated in issuing the guidelines . &quot; It is a matter of respecting internationally accepted human-rights standards. &quot; Female genital mutilation graphically underscores Mawani ' s point . The World_Health_Organization estimates that more_than 80 million women and girls , mainly in Africa and Asia , have been genitally mutilated . Though scholars say Islam doesn ' t mandate female genital mutilation , adherents of the practice often view it as a moral or religious requirement . It is used to reduce women ' s sexuality , to create an appearance of virginity and as a rite of passage for girls . Performed by people with no medical knowledge and with no anesthesia , the mutilation can cause hemorrhaging , infertility and death . One who survived is Khadra Farah . She applied for political asylum in Canada , fearing that she would lose her two children to her ex-husband if forced to return to her native Somalia , where men automatically retain custody rights . She wants to protect her daughter from the trauma she experienced when she was 8 . &quot; One afternoon , &quot; she attests in her affidavit , &quot; a group of women , including my mother and aunts , gathered at our house so that they could circumcise me and my cousin... I was told that it is a common thing and that it would enhance my chances of getting_married to a good man... Two pairs of women grabbed my legs and spread them wide open... Then , another lady started to get a new blade and took the cover off it... I felt the pain and started to scream . She cut_off my clitoris with the blade and I screamed more... She continued slicing away my labia minor , at which point I lost_consciousness . Subsequently , she scraped raw the walls of my vulva and bound them together with thorns . She placed a stick between the raw walls of my vulva so that I would have barely sufficient means to expel my bodily waste... My legs were left tied together for 10 days... though this event took_place over 20 years ago , I can still easily visualize the scene and feel the pain and trauma all_over again when I start to talk_about it. &quot; In May , Canada granted Farah ' s family asylum . Farah is believed to be the first woman to receive asylum in the West with a claim of genital mutilation , but she is not likely to be the last . Three years ago , the_French Commission for Refugee Appeals ruled that the threat of female circumcision could constitute persecution . Beyer says it is &quot; certainly possible &quot; that the INS considerations will address it . In Portland , Ore. , Immigration Judge Kendall WArren in March suspended the deportation of Lydia Oluloro to Nigeria , where she had suffered the same mutilation at age 4 , ruling that a threat of mutilation existed for her two U.S. citizen daughters . &quot; Although it attempts to respect the traditions and cultures of other societies , as_to this practice the court concludes that it is cruel and serves no known medical purpose , &quot; stated the judge , allowing Oluloro to stay in the country permanently . Warren ' s decision broke new ground but didn ' t set a precedent for asylum cases , as another Nigerian named Eunice Deshields recently learned when she asked Warren to reopen her case so she could seek asylum are different , and Warren rejected Deshields ' motion , noting that in asylum cases , one must fear for one ' s self , not another . Deshields has appealed , arguing that the threat of mutilation to the daughter can constitute persecution for the mother , a position the U.N. group recently recognized . Is genital mutilation truly persecution ? Oluloro ' s attorney says his client initially accepted female genital mutilation as part of her culture , but her views changed as the case developed . Are lawyers discovering fears or developing them ? David V . Beebee , district director of the INS Portland office , points_out that Deshields made her claim for asylum after her daughter was born -- and also after other appeals_to stay here failed . He fears her case could encourage women living here illegally to have children so as_to shield them from deportation . &quot; I think it ' s reasonable to assume to assume that we will see a pattern of behavior develop over time as the genital mutilation argument becomes more widely known . Any illegal alien female from any country that practices genital mutilation ( could use it ) as a method for staying in the U.S. permanently , &quot; he says . Stein and other critics of the pending guidelines consider these women and their stories perfect examples of the pitfalls of redefining political oppression . &quot; What we see here is somewhat quixotic and utopian effort to employ our asylum process to register political objections to broad-based cultural norms and standards with which we disagree , &quot; says Stein . &quot; If the basis of a claim rests_on habit , custom and convention in another society , that is not the basis for asylum . There ' s no way to limit those kinds of claims . We are not going_to change Nigerian cultural norms and standards by letting every woman who fears clitoridectomy not go_back to Nigeria . We can ' t use immigration to change the world. &quot; Those who work with refugees seeking asylum consider such fears of widespread abuse of the system unfounded . Even with new INS guidelines , women refugees will still face an almost Darwinian survival process -- with only the fittest getting far enough to even make a claim . Often responsible_for children , and with few financial resources , women are far less mobile than men ; in some countries , they aren ' t allowed to travel on_their_own . Although women compose the majority of the world ' s refugees , they constitute only 30 % of asylum applicants in the United States . Once in this country , women seeking asylum face another series of hurdles in the application process . Under the new guidelines , women applicants who have sensitive claims would have female asylum officers and can be interviewed privately . For the first time , all_INS officers would receive rape trauma awareness training . But these procedures would n ' t apply to the immigration courts , which also hear asylum claims in deportation proceedings and are run_by the Executive Office of Immigration Review , an agency independent of the INS . With justices in black robes and attorneys serving as cross-examiners , immigration courts can be intimidating . &quot; Women who have been rape victims are being asked to appear at a hearing that is frequently adversarial , often before male examiners who are not sensitive , and tell stories of terrible trauma , &quot; says Stephanie Marks of the New York-based Lawyers Committee for Human_Rights , which provides pro bono representation for refugees . Women raised to be submissive often find the very process of talking to officials daunting . Many fear their families will discover the abuse they suffered -- in many cultures rape is still considered the woman ' s fault and ruins her chances for marriage . Those who do talk find their manner of communication often misunderstood . The male model for credibility -- direct eye_contact , a straightforward manner -- doesn ' t fit rape victims or women taught to be deferential . Female refugees from conservative cultures where women barely speak_to unfamiliar men often find it impossible to reveal the graphic details of sexual abuse even the most sensitive male examiners . The asylum case of a Salvadoran woman named Maria illustrates just how callous the system can be . In 1990 , a California counselor recommended that examiners for Maria be female , stating : &quot; Examination must be carried_out with the utmost delicacy and understanding to avoid the emotional breakdown of this witness. &quot; The judge declined to substitute himself . Sobbing uncontrollably , Maria testified for three hours with her hands_over her face , recounting before a male interpreter , two male attorneys and her husband how she was raped by five Salvadoran guerrillas . The immigration judge clipped his fingernails as she spoke , but granted her asylum . In Miami , dozens of women are seeking asylum alleging abuse by the Haitian army . Some have recently won their cases . Others have been unable to testify before male judges and face significant credibility problems as they appeal . A 27-year-old Haitian named Marie could barely tell her story to her female attorney . Marie ' s husband painted presidential campaign pictures of Jean-Bertrand Aristide . In April , 1992 , police abducted him and took turns raping Marie , who was pregnant . &quot; They said , ' You have a little Aristide inside of you and we should stick our hand in and pull him out , &quot; ' she told attorney Cecilia M . Olavarria last spring . Marie never saw her husband again . During her interview with Olavarria , Marie became so hysterical that the lawyer had to call a rape hot_line for help . But I ' ve been told that Marie wants to talk to me and when she arrives_at the attorney ' s office , she greets me with a hug . She wears a black print dress with a white collar . Her year-old daughter is decked in layers of pink and white lace . Marie leans her head on one shoulder and then another . I mention Haiti . With a sharp jolt , she suddenly collapses forward onto the table , as if struck very hard . Cradling her head in her arm , she moans : &quot; Every time I remember those things , it hurts. &quot; The U.S. Coast Guard took Marie to Guantanamo Bay Naval Station after stopping her boat . Haitians there taunted her about the rapes , harassment that continues in Miami . &quot; They ask my boyfriend : ' What are you going_to do with the military ' s leftover ? &quot; ' groans Marie . &quot; Sometimes I feel_like I want to run . I left the baby sleeping one day and walked_out_of the apartment . I walked and walked , thinking and talking to myself. &quot; Taken_home by a neighbor , Marie found her daughter tottering beside an open window . &quot; She ' s losing_it and she ' s not getting any help , &quot; sighs paralegal Yolene Charles , who ' s translating . Marie tells me she wants help and part of her wants to tell her story . Of the son and stepson left in Haiti . Of the cave she hid in . Of the four men in blue uniforms who tied her up and raped her one by one , saying : &quot; This is Aristide and this is Aristide &quot; as her 12-year-old stepson watched . Marie says she will kill herself if she has to face them again . &quot; Sometimes I dream I ' m in Haiti and I wake_up screaming . I always see myself in the middle of the military , &quot; she says , slumping in her seat . &quot; I have lost my interieur . I am praying to God to get_it back. &quot; For women ' s stories to be fully heard , changes will have to extend far beyond legal interpretations of asylum law to a greater awareness of women ' s experiences in the world . Documentation supporting applicants ' testimony is critical in asylum cases , but women ' s problems have often been invisible to human-rights monitors . As a result , reports on women ' s status in many countries are scarce , making_it difficult for female applicants to substantiate their stories . Mariam , a black_woman in her early 20s , is a member of the Sudanese Women ' s Union , an organization promoting women ' s rights . Omar Bashir ' s extremist Islamic regime outlawed the SWU after he came_to power in 1989 , severely limiting women ' s activities . Defying the laws , Mariam ( not her real name ) and other women met in underground SWU cells to organize . They also refused to veil . &quot; I had no other choice . I am deeply committed to women ' s rights and to improve their situation , &quot; explains the young_woman in Arabic to her attorney , Khadija Amsrouy , who translates on a conference_call . Security_forces arrested Mariam in 1990 at an SWU demonstration . It was the first of five incarcerations . Imprisoned for periods ranging from several days to more_than a month , the law_student was deprived of food , water and sleep . &quot; You had to stand_up all_the time and they would come and watch you . If you were tired and wanted to sit or were starting to fall_asleep , they would burn you with metal iron bars . They ' d say : ' This is what you get when you want to be a feminist. &quot; ' Mariam fled Sudan and is living with a relative outside of New York . Being granted asylum is the only way she can stay here legally . So far the only people she ' s talked to here about her experience are Amsrouy , who works for the New York law_firm Debevoise and Plimpton , and a psychiatrist Amsrouy took her to after she lost 20 pounds and appeared on the verge of a breakdown . Mariam says she feels better . But the past still haunts her . &quot; I cannot sleep and even when I sleep I have very bad nightmares . It ' s always a repetition of what happened to me in Sudan . I relive that experience again and again , &quot; she says . &quot; I cry a lot. &quot; Mariam now waits for her INS interview . Her case appears strong because her persecution is directly related to activities in a political organization , although feminism has only recently been recognized as a political stance . Her attorney is worried , however , that since watchdog groups have produced little evidence verifying the existence of the SWU , it will be difficult to back_up Mariam ' s story . &quot; The SWU is a very important organization in Sudan but there was almost nothing on it , &quot; complains Amsrouy . &quot; If she were a man we would have much more documentation. &quot; Adds Canadian refugee lawyer Marie-Louise Cote : &quot; A country that ' s repressive toward women probably won ' t have any data on the status of women . So it becomes a Catch-22. &quot; For years , human-rights groups have focused_on documenting more traditional forms of political persecution . Now the question is : Are women ' s rights human_rights ? Women are not , generally , the soldiers , the guerrillas , the politicians . Their actions , their struggles have not by and large been the concern of world_courts , of international aid . Women have operated primarily in the private sphere of the home , and family life and social mores have been considered off limits to outside scrutiny . The international community has been willing to pressure a country over its system of racial_segregation , but thus far there have been no embargoes based on the systematic oppression of women . Canadian and now U.S. initiatives to reinterpret asylum law reflect on emerging international consciousness that the personal can indeed be the political . The initiatives also send a significant message , making_it clear , as Nurjehan Mawani puts it , that &quot; human_rights are human_rights and universal and indivisible , that torture is torture and rape is rape. &quot; Still , it will be years before significant legal precedents are set . &quot; We ' re getting more wins lately , &quot; Kelly says , &quot; but this could all be knocked_off its feet by a bad circuit-court decision. &quot; In the best of circumstances , Mariam and Aminah and Marie will overcome the obstacles to tell their stories and will be heard . But they are just a_few , and there is still so_much silence .</TEXT>
