   <HEADLINE> GAZA RAGE BOILS_OVER AFTER PLO ACTIVISTS ' DEATHS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Amid cries of &quot; Blood for blood ! &quot; and &quot; No peace after today ! &quot; the occupied territories exploded in violent protests Tuesday , the day after Israeli security_forces in the Gaza Strip killed six supporters of PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat . The latest displays of rage further imperiled the Middle_East peace process , already plunged into crisis by last month ' s massacre of about 30 praying Palestinians in a Hebron mosque . On Tuesday , as Israeli soldiers opened_fire on Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West_Bank , wounding more_than 75 and killing one , Palestine Liberation Organization leaders in Gaza City and the West_Bank called_for a suspension and &quot; comprehensive re-evaluation &quot; of the entire peace process . The day ' s violence also left four Israeli soldiers and three civilians wounded , among them a 70-year-old construction worker who was in critical condition after he was attacked with axes by two Palestinian laborers from Gaza in a town near Tel Aviv . PLO and Israeli officials met in Cairo on Tuesday , even as Arafat -- who denounced the Gaza killings as one &quot; in a line of massacres that the Israeli army took_part in &quot; -- called an emergency meeting of his organization in Tunis , Tunisia . In Israel , officials said that the Palestinians killed late Monday night -- contrary to some earlier reports of the incident -- were not on any &quot; most wanted &quot; lists and that they had not fired at Israeli troops before they were shot . PLO officials in the occupied territories said local Israeli officials had apologized to them for the incident . As for the closed Cairo sessions with the Israelis , PLO leaders stressed that they were not negotiations , or even discussions or meetings . The PLO said its representatives saw the Israelis in &quot; a simple act of receiving answers &quot; to Palestinian demands on a security agreement for Hebron and on questions arising from Monday night ' s shooting . The two sides thus failed to reach a predicted breakthrough Tuesday to restart formal talks on implementing the long-delayed Sept . 13 agreement for limited Palestinian autonomy , beginning in Jericho and the Gaza Strip . In his angry public reaction to the killings , Arafat , in an interview aired on Israeli television , demanded that Israel explain whether Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin was aware of his military ' s plans to slay his PLO supporters . He blamed their deaths on &quot; a secret organization from within the Israeli army . . . . The crime is deliberate , the timing is deliberate and the aim is to sabotage the peace process. &quot; Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres , a prime_mover behind the peace talks , insisted that the troops &quot; had no sinister intentions. &quot; He called the shootings &quot; regrettable , &quot; stressing , &quot; It was not done_by intention. &quot; But in and around Gaza ' s largest , most squalid refugee camp , as families of the six slain members of Arafat ' s Fatah faction mourned and buried their dead , angry local leaders called Monday night ' s shootings &quot; cold-blooded murder. &quot; Zakaria Agha , Arafat ' s handpicked future governor of Gaza , said he knew all six dead men . He said he had advised Arafat to retaliate by suspending all negotiations with Israel for now . He said he urged the PLO -- whose support is at its nadir in the territories , especially in Gaza -- to demand deployment of an international military observer force in the Gaza Strip , besides the West_Bank city of Hebron . He also said Palestinians must insist on the immediate withdrawal of all Israeli troops from Gaza and Jericho , which the &quot; Gaza-Jericho first &quot; agreement signed_in September stated would begin last Dec . 13 and be completed before April 13 . Agha and half_a_dozen witnesses asserted in interviews that Monday night ' s killings included at least one summary execution of a Palestinian by an Israeli undercover officer . The Palestinian witnesses insisted that the men were gunned_down without provocation as they handed_out leaflets in the Jabaliya refugee camp . There was a running dispute as_to whether the men were armed and whether they wore masks and dressed in camouflage , as described in official accounts given by Israeli military sources . But even Israel ' s version made_it clear that none of the six men fired on the undercover unit before they were killed -- some of them by being shot repeatedly at close range . When the undercover Israeli unit attacked , the six men were distributing leaflets encouraging support for Arafat ' s Fatah and urging the many Palestinian political factions to unite , witnesses said . The leaflets were signed by Fatah ' s &quot; secret military wing , &quot; the Fatah Hawks . Although they have insisted they are trying to preserve the peace process , Israeli authorities have said they will continue to fire on armed Palestinians ; several Gazans speculated that the men were killed when the undercover unit mistook them for members of the Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas , which opposes the talks . Witnesses described in detail how Nahed Odeh , one of the slain activists , was chased by an undercover_agent as he tried to flee the gunfire while wounded . &quot; One of the undercover men grabbed him from inside the shop , pulled him out onto the stairs , put his foot on the back of his neck and fired four times into his head , &quot; said Nowfal Abu Eida , who lives next door . Agha , the local PLO leader , insisted at a Gaza City news_conference that the six men were not even Fatah Hawks . He said they were veteran activists in Fatah ' s political wing and had spent years in Israeli prisons before the Israeli-PLO accord was signed_in September . Late last month , Arafat suspended formal negotiations to implement the Gaza-Jericho agreement when Baruch Goldstein , a Brooklyn-born extremist settler , massacred about 30 Palestinian worshipers in the Cave of the Patriarchs on Feb . 25 . After Monday night ' s killings , most PLO leaders in the territories concluded they have little hope for the future of the Israel-PLO accord . &quot; Mr. Rabin is just moving massacres from one place to another , &quot; declared Saeb Erekat , a West_Bank PLO leader who added that he believes &quot; the peace process is coming_to an end. &quot; U.S. officials , brokers of the overall Middle_East peace process that began more_than two years ago , were cautious about the effect of Monday ' s incident on the talks . &quot; There ' s a race here against time -- between the violence on the ground ( versus ) the political negotiations , &quot; a senior U.S. official said . ' There ' s no way of telling which will overtake the other at any given time . But it ' s U.S. policy to push_forward as hard as possible. &quot; There were signs_in the occupied territories Tuesday that the violence was winning the race . Palestinians in more_than half_a_dozen towns traded stones for bullets in the street violence that has become a staple of life here since the Hebron massacre . In the impoverished Gaza Strip , seething with fury and vows of revenge , local PLO leader Agha predicted , &quot; Every action has a reaction . . . . Surely , we will face difficult days ahead. &quot; Musa Abdul Nabi -- a cousin of slain activist Jamal Abdul Nabi , 37 , who left_behind a wife and seven children -- observed of the violence and protracted talks with Israel : &quot; It gives me the feeling of helplessness . All of these men who were killed were well-known supporters of the peace process . . . . Now , we need protection from the world -- to protect us from the Israelis. &quot; At the wake for Odeh -- the 29-year-old father of two and_gate guard at a Gaza university who allegedly was hunted and executed by the Israelis after he was wounded -- his younger brother was numb with grief . &quot; It was a shock . I just feel shock , &quot; Zohair Mohammed Odeh said . Asked why his brother was killed , Odeh shook his head and said , &quot; The Israelis think , they ' re leaving , so just kill these guys . . . . They just want to kill . Killing is in their blood . Before , everybody supported the peace process . But not anymore . They killed my brother . They killed my people . They ' re killing everybody , so why support this process ? &quot; Times staff writer Kim Murphy in Cairo contributed to this report .</TEXT>
