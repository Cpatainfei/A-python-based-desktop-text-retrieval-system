   <HEADLINE> OPPONENTS FEAR RENEWED PUSH FOR PRAYER IN SCHOOLS ; CONSTITUTION : CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN TAKEOVER OF HOUSE AND SENATE IS EXPECTED TO FUEL BATTLE OVER 1ST AMENDMENT ISSUES . MOST RELIGIOUS GROUPS ARE TAKING A CAUTIOUS APPROACH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Religious organizations and 1st Amendment advocacy groups are reacting with a mixture of caution and outright hostility to the growing political push for some form of organized prayer in public_schools . Advocates of strict separation of church and state expect the nation ' s public_schools to become even more of a battleground over 1st Amendment issues now that conservative Republicans have gained control of the House and Senate . Rep . Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) , the probable House Speaker in the next Congress , has indicated that he plans to push for an early vote on a constitutional amendment to permit prayer in public_schools . President Clinton heightened the debate this week , first with a conciliatory nod toward the prayer amendment , then by backing_away and suggesting that he might support a less divisive &quot; moment of reflection &quot; during the school_day . Both scenarios are potentially problematic to religious groups that believe any form of organized prayer would erode students ' constitutional rights to free expression of religion . The Supreme Court ruled_in 1962 that public_school sponsored prayer violated constitutionally mandated church-state separation . Ten years ago , a Republican-led Senate rejected a proposal for a voluntary school prayer amendment . A constitutional amendment requires a hard to get two-thirds approval in both the House and Senate , plus ratification by two-thirds of the states . If a school prayer amendment gained the necessary two-thirds support , said Robert Boston , a spokesman for Americans United for Separation of Church and State , it is likely that the required state approval would follow . Given the nation ' s current conservative political climate , he said , amendment approval would &quot; tear through the states like a brush fire. &quot; * It is the prospect of a constitutional change that is raising the strongest objections in the church world . Gingrich backs a proposal , now before Congress , that would allow individual or group prayer in a public_school if students are not required to participate and the government does not compose the prayer . &quot; The result of a school prayer amendment would not be the protection of religious liberty , a value we all cherish , but imposition upon students of obligatory prayers or an embarrassing abstention , &quot; said Alfred H . Moses , president of the American Jewish Committee . &quot; There is nothing worse for religion than when the government gets too cozy with a particular faith , &quot; said Steve McFarland , director of the Christian Legal Society ' s Center for Law and Religious Freedom . &quot; The power to endorse your faith will allow someone else to endorse their faith at your expense. &quot; Various U.S. Supreme Court decisions have upheld the right of students to pray as individuals or in groups as long as the prayers are not organized by school officials . Critics of organized prayer claim that under an organized system , peer pressure would intimidate students -- particularly adherents of minority religions such_as Jews , Hindus and Muslims -- into praying even if they did not want to . And by choosing what prayers could be said , critics say administrators would be guilty of &quot; establishment of religion &quot; in violation of the 1st Amendment . But those opposed to the no-pray policy contend that some school districts have gone too far , unlawfully curtailing all religious expression . They want more guarantees of liberties for religious students written into the Constitution . &quot; We do not want to go_back to how it was before 1963 , when the school was setting prayers and Scripture readings , &quot; said Richard D . Land , executive_director of the Christian Life Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention . &quot; But we also are not going_to accept the dismal situation of the last 30 years , where we have had an attempt to actively or passively censor religious expression on the part of students in our public_schools . &quot; Schools should not sponsor religious activities or give the appearance of either advocating or denigrating religion , &quot; Land added . But &quot; our students are American citizens , and they do not leave their 1st Amendment rights at the boundaries of public_school property. &quot; &quot; We ' re talking_about students ' right to witness to each other , being able to wear religious jewelry , T-shirts with religious expressions , being able to carry a Bible , to pray over lunch , &quot; he said . Despite his group ' s longstanding support for religious expression in public_schools , Land was cautious in his support of any congressionally sponsored prayer amendment . Any support , he said , would &quot; depend_on what ' s in it. &quot; * Land said , nevertheless , that he sees no problem with an amendment allowing public_schools to offer students a short period -- say , five minutes a day -- for &quot; a silent moment of prayer or meditation . Anything beyond that , I get exceedingly nervous with. &quot; Forest Montgomery , counsel for the conservative National Assn . of Evangelicals based in Carol Stream , Ill. , said the current proposal in Congress suffers from the same shortfall that caused his group to oppose a school prayer amendment proposed during the Ronald Reagan_Administration in 1982 : It would allow school administrators to decide what prayers would be said . &quot; We would have the same reservations about Caesar getting_in the prayer composing business that we had in 1982 , &quot; said Montgomery , in a reference_to the biblical admonition to &quot; Render unto Caesar that which is Caesar ' s and unto God that which is God ' s. &quot; Some of the strongest school prayer support within organized religion appears to come from the American Center for Law and Justice , a legal_action group founded by Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson . Jay Sekulow , lead attorney for the center , has called the drive for a school prayer amendment &quot; almost unstoppable &quot; and said it has been fueled by actions taken by authorities denying students their right to pray in the schools . Even so , Sekulow said the amendment now in Congress needs to be revised to place more emphasis on student-led prayer . If caution is the watchword of the school prayer debate , it was quite evident this week at a meeting of the interfaith Coalition for the Free Exercise of Religion , which spans the spectrum from the conservative Concerned Women for America to the liberal National Council of Churches and the Unitarian Universalist Assn . &quot; I couldn ' t find a single lawyer with a conservative organization that supports the amendment as drafted , &quot; Oliver Thomas , chairman of the coalition , said of the coalition meeting . Cardinal-designate William Keeler of Baltimore , president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops , on Thursday expressed qualified support for some type of religious expression in the schools . &quot; Our conference has said that we would be interested in school prayer . . . if it is coupled with instruction in their ( students ' ) own faith , &quot; Keeler said . He referred to a practice in many school districts in the 1940s and 1950s known as &quot; release time &quot; in which students received religious instruction -- either at their public_school or some_other place -- by priests or religious teachers . But Keeler declined to comment on the proposed congressional amendment . &quot; We don ' t comment on legislation until we see the language it would take , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
