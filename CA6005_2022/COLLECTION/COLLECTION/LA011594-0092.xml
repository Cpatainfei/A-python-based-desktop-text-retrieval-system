   <HEADLINE> CLINTON HAS TV_AUDIENCE IN THE BAG</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton charmed a live studio audience of rapt Russians so thoroughly on Friday that one starry-eyed member considered wrapping her hand , which had just shaken his , in a Baggie to retain the sensation . &quot; I talked with him just as if he were a guy from my street , &quot; marveled Natasha Vysotskaya , a 36-year-old sociologist . &quot; I should put my hand in a cellophane bag. &quot; From Vyborg to Vladivostok , millions of viewers who tuned_in to Russia ' s first direct , live address and Q &amp; A session by a U.S. President were subjected_to the full force of the down-home salesmanship he used to woo American voters . Clinton quoted Abraham_Lincoln . He assured a 13-year-old Russian boy that with hard work and luck he , too , might grow_up to be president . He praised the energy , education and rich heritage of Mother Russia and promised &quot; a light at the end of this long tunnel. &quot; He was so persuasive that he even won a round of applause for Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin , whose popularity lately is lukewarm at best , by pointing_out that Russia is lucky to have &quot; a president who ' s willing to wade into the tides of history and make decisions. &quot; If the studio audience was any indication , Clinton ' s rating may well be higher now in Russia than at_home . Unlike the old Soviet days , when a lecture on democracy and economics from a U.S. President would have drawn bellows of outraged pride from Communist patriots , the Russians in Friday ' s audience -- largely university_students -- took his preaching with equanimity . Several noted that he seemed to want to teach Russia how to run its affairs , but their comments held little rancor . &quot; His assessment of our situation , especially of the economy , is about right , &quot; said Viktor Mikheyev , a technician at the Ostankino television center where Clinton spoke . &quot; He ' s a skillful politician , &quot; said Natasha Sokolova , a Moscow State University_student . &quot; No matter what the question was , he brought the answer around to friendship and democracy. &quot; Still , some queries from the audience carried an undertone of the humiliation of lost power that has helped spur Russia ' s new_wave of ultranationalism . One questioner implied that Clinton was trying to prescribe a single , American-style recipe for Russian democracy and that Americans tend to say , &quot; ' Come_on , comrades , be just like us. ' And isn ' t that incorrect ? &quot; The strongest applause came when a Russian teacher asked why school exchange programs all seemed to bring Russian children to America but not vice versa , and Clinton acknowledged that they should be more two-sided and that American children could learn much here . One Russian broadcaster appeared miffed that so many people in the audience -- which had been meant to consist_of typical Russians -- knew English . He wondered on the air if a hall of nearly 400 Russian-speakers could be gathered_in America . Clinton , obviously aware of the pitfalls awaiting him , tried openly to avoid them ; he asserted repeatedly that the United States was not trying to dominate Russia , saying , &quot; I want to have an equal partnership here . &quot; I don ' t want to have any dictatorial control in Russia , &quot; he maintained , repeatedly referring to the United States and Russia as partners . But sometimes even his attempted compliments appeared to backfire ; he sounded like a teacher encouraging a lazy pupil when he told Russians , &quot; It is clear that you have the capability to do well. &quot; Clinton sounded pedantic as well as he described almost in outline form his vision of Russia ' s three main challenges now : developing a free-market economy , strengthening democracy and learning to redefine itself as a great_power without expanding its borders . He moved from teaching Poli . Sci . 101 to Econ . 101 when he explained to Russians intimately acquainted with rampant inflation and its causes that the government must cut its spending if it wants to slow the price spiral . He was facing a much tougher forum than the campaign-trail town_meetings he set_up to sell Americans on his candidacy and such issues as the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . Even the large part of the audience that spoke English did not respond to most of his light jokes , and only a faint laugh greeted his comically understated retort to Russian extremists ' demand that America return Alaska : &quot; I don ' t think I can go_along with that. &quot; Nor were there any grateful murmurings when he promised to deliver on pledges of American aid and praised Russia ' s past as &quot; a history of heroism. &quot; When Clinton said that he believes the greatest difference between Russia and the United States is that Russia is one of the world ' s youngest democracies while America is one of its oldest , one Russian cameraman muttered : &quot; Great . Now we have a big brother. &quot; One woman called Clinton on not having praised Russia ' s great spiritual energy -- he remedied that immediately -- and a man pressed him on continuing to give aid to Baltic countries where the Russian minorities say they are treated as second-class citizens . Clinton said he was awaiting a report from Latvia and that its conclusion on whether Russians ' rights were violated there would affect U.S. policy . Overall , however , the audience was a gentle one , as hospitable Russian audiences tend to be to foreigners . Warm smiles lit many faces at the show ' s best moment , when a 13-year-old Russian boy who had seen a photo of Clinton as a teen-ager shaking hands with President John F . Kennedy asked when his presidential ambitions had begun to take_root . &quot; Come shake hands with me , and maybe you ' ll be president of Russia some day , &quot; Clinton told him . And he did .</TEXT>
