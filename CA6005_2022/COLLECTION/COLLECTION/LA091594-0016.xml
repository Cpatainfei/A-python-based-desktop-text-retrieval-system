   <HEADLINE> MAKE IT ' SOS ' FOR SNAKE-OIL SALESMEN ; PROPOSITION 187 : WHO ' S BEHIND THIS NOXIOUS NOSTRUM ? TWO EX-BUREAUCRATS WHO FAILED TO ENFORCE IMMIGRATION LAWS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a former U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service prosecutor who for years helped to deport illegal aliens , I support strict enforcement of federal immigration laws . Nevertheless , it makes me furious that two mothballed bureaucrats -- Alan Nelson and Harold Ezell -- have sponsored a November ballot proposition whose passage could expel thousands of children from our public_schools , all_in the name of immigration control . Although they call their idea the &quot; save our state &quot; or &quot; SOS &quot; initiative , a better description would be the &quot; snake-oil salesmen &quot; initiative . Consider the credentials of the two sponsors . Nelson was commissioner of the INS throughout most of the 1980s . Ezell was INS western regional commissioner , Nelson ' s right-hand_man in California . Both were political appointees with no previous immigration experience or expertise . In 1986 , Congress gave them a forceful new weapon in the war against illegal immigration : the power to fine and jail the employers of illegal aliens . What was their track record in prosecuting employers who violated the 1986 law ? Suffice it to say that not a single employer of illegal aliens went_to jail during their tenure . Their failure to vigorously enforce the employer-sanctions provisions of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 , to beef_up the Border_Patrol or to modernize the INS ' antiquated record-keeping system helped send our illegal-alien problem spinning out of control . How is it , then , that Nelson and Ezell have suddenly emerged to propose that California adopt its own immigration policy -- one that targets schoolchildren rather than illegal workers or their employers ? Nelson is a lobbyist for the conservative Federation for American Immigration Reform , which opposes not only illegal immigration but most legal immigration as well . Ezell is now an immigration consultant who assists high-rolling foreign businessmen obtain U.S. visas . Proposition 187 would force school districts to refuse to enroll students who could not produce papers proving their legal_status . Even children who are citizens would be forced to turn_over information to the state about the immigration status of their parents . All suspicious information would be turned_over to the local INS office , where already overworked investigators would have to dig through piles of paperwork in search of illegal aliens . Critics of the 1986 law claim that it is not working because illegal workers use fake documents to gain employment . If Proposition 187 passes , we will be faced with the spectacle of children presenting fake birth_certificates and green_cards to their teachers . This is a good way to subsidize the illegal-document trade , but is it a good way to enforce our immigration laws ? The sponsors of this initiative should heed the truism that those who refuse to learn from the mistakes of the past are doomed to repeat them . As recently as 1982 , the Supreme Court struck_down as unconstitutional a Texas law very similar to the SOS initiative . The majority justices held that &quot; penalizing the . . . child is an ineffectual -- as well as unjust -- way of deterring the parent. &quot; Even the dissenting justices agreed that &quot; it is senseless for an enlightened society to deprive any children -- including illegal aliens -- of an elementary_education . . . and that it would be folly -- and wrong -- to tolerate creation of a segment of society made_up of illiterate persons. &quot; Nelson , Ezell and their backers should be honest with voters : Immigration policy is made in Washington , not Sacramento . We already spend more_than $ 1 billion a year funding the INS . Nelson and Ezell had their chance and failed to make an impact when they ran the agency in the 1980s . Most California voters are naturally fed up with illegal immigration , but we are sophisticated enough to know that depriving children of an education will only make matters worse without making a dent in illegal immigration . Presented with the facts , I believe voters will turn_down the initiative . Nelson and Ezell will have to peddle their snake_oil somewhere else .</TEXT>
