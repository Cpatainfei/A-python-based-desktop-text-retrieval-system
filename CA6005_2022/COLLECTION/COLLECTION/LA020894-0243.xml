   <HEADLINE> ANAHEIM JOINS CITIES GROUP LOBBYING ON EL TORO ; LAND USE : THE ALLIANCE OF NORTH COUNTY GOVERNMENTS FAVORS CONVERTING THE MARINE BASE INTO A COMMERICAL AIRPORT AFTER IT IS CLOSED_DOWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After months of posturing , the city of Anaheim will officially join an alliance of North County cities trying to influence future development plans for the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station , city officials said Monday . The group , known as the Orange County Regional Airport Authority , supports building a commercial airport at the base after it closes , which is scheduled to occur by 1999 . The group is closely monitoring the actions of the county ' s newly formed El Toro Reuse Planning Authority , which is taking the lead in determining the base reuse issue . A number of North County cities , including Anaheim , are concerned that the county ' s executive panel will not seriously consider an airport option for the base . Furthermore , they contend that the county panel is weighted in favor of cities that do not favor an airport proposal . A majority of South County cities oppose putting an airport at the 4 # 700-acre base because they contend it will create too_much noise , snarl traffic and affect their quality_of_life . They would like to see some_other development at the base , such_as residential or commercial projects . Although Anaheim officials have participated in OCRAA meetings , the council is expected to make the city an official member of the group with a vote at tonight ' s council meeting . &quot; We want to make_sure we have a say in what ' s going_to become of the base , &quot; said Councilman Irv Pickler . &quot; We have to look_out for our city ' s interests. &quot; OCRAA was formed by the cities of Garden Grove , Stanton and Los Alamitos last summer . Anaheim had not joined the group because it was waiting to see who would be included in the county ' s reuse committee . Ken Bruner , aide to Supervisor Thomas F . Riley who is the designated chairman of the county ' s El Toro Reuse Planning Authority , said Anaheim ' s decision should not be considered a disruptive influence on the base conversion process . Anaheim officials have also indicated they would join the executive_council of the county ' s planning group . &quot; Folks in every city in this county ought to take_care of their interests in the best way they know how , &quot; Bruner said . &quot; We can ' t tell people living_in Anaheim , Orange or San Clemente what they ought to be doing . I would hope ( Anaheim ' s ) participation in OCRAA would not be to the exclusion of any involvement ( on the county authority ) . &quot; Ever since El Toro was slated for closure , the future development of the base has been a hotly debated issue among Orange County cities , which are divided on whether to build an airport on the property . Allan B . Hughes , executive_director of the Anaheim Chamber_of_Commerce , said he supports the city joining OCRAA . &quot; The way it is now , the non-airport people have a veto &quot; in the county plan , he said . &quot; We think that ' s wrong. &quot; Hughes said a commercial or cargo airport at the base would greatly enhance the county ' s tourism industry as well as its businesses .</TEXT>
