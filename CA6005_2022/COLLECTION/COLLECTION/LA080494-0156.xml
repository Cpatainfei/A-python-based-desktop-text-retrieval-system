   <HEADLINE> CENTERPIECE : FATAL VOYAGE ; IT ' S BEEN 6 MONTHS SINCE THE COMMERCIAL TRAWLER VIL VANA AND ITS EVEN CREWMEN VANISHED IN WATERS OFF SANTA CRUZ ISLAND . BUT UNANSWERED QUESTIONS STILL HAUNT THE FAMILIES LEFT BEHIND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> NORMA WATKINS talks_about her 11-year-old granddaughter , who has been prone to sleepless nights and dark moods ever since the child ' s father was lost at_sea last year . One evening recently , Watkins says , the family was watching a TV movie about ' 30s aviator Amelia Earhart when the youngster made a haunting connection . &quot; Amelia Earhart just disappears , &quot; Watkins says , &quot; and my granddaughter goes , ' that ' s just like . . . . ' But she couldn ' t make herself say it . Her grandfather finally said , ' Just like Dad. ' &quot; Nearly 16 months have passed since the commercial trawler Vil Vana and seven crewmen vanished just north of Santa Cruz Island . While families of the victims are still tormented by the mysterious and seemingly implausible event -- one of the worst maritime disasters in Ventura County history -- they are also exasperated and angry with the U.S. Coast Guard , which has neither solved the mystery nor finished its official report on the investigation . &quot; We should have had answers by now , &quot; says Laura Huffman , the mother of the three children of crewman Donnie Watkins . Without an official report , the tragedy lacks finality for relatives , preventing them from letting_go . &quot; For all I know , &quot; Norma Watkins says , &quot; my son is alive. &quot; And without definitive answers , rumors and imaginations run wild . How could a 41-foot wooden trawler and everyone on board just vanish in the middle of Santa Barbara Channel ? Conjecture around the docks ranges from drug snuff to UFOs . SPECULATION Norma and Don Watkins speculate that the Vil Vana was sunk_in a collision with the U.S. Navy ' s black stealth ship , the 160-foot Sea Shadow , a scenario straight out of a Tom Clancy novel but with a touch of credibility : The Sea Shadow just happened to be at Santa Cruz Island that day , the Navy confirms . The drawn-out official report and the Sea Shadow ' s presence fuels the conspiracy theories . &quot; Something big-time happened on that ocean , &quot; Norma Watkins says , sitting under a shade_tree outside her La Conchita trailer . &quot; I don ' t know . . . with that report taking so_long . . . The whole_thing is fishy. &quot; But the Coast Guard sees thoroughness behind its lengthy investigation -- after all , Amelia Earhart ' s disappearance hasn ' t been solved in 57 years . While most fatality reports usually take only weeks to complete , running just a_few pages , the Vil Vana report has grown to 60 pages and &quot; is the largest investigation file I ' ve ever seen in my two years here , &quot; says Lt . Commander Adeste Fuentes , who is in_charge of the investigation for the Coast Guard ' s Marine Safety Office in Long_Beach . The Coast Guard investigation has been stymied by a lack of hard evidence and a total absence of eyewitnesses . But next_of_kin , Fuentes says , want intrigue and revelation , where none exists . &quot; If you ' re looking_for answers , &quot; he says , &quot; the answer is , ' We don ' t know ( what happened ) . ' &quot; This much is known : The blue-and-white Vil Vana was last seen at 4:30 a.m. on April 9 , 1993 , easing away from E dock at Ventura Harbor Village Marina and setting a course for the shrimp beds off Santa Cruz Island . That afternoon , satellites began picking_up distress_signals . At 8:43 p.m. , the pilot of a search helicopter spotted an emergency strobe light amid a small debris field floating 1 1 / 2 miles north of the island , off an area called Chinese Harbor . But no boat and no bodies were ever discovered . The Coast Guard turned_up &quot; nothing significant &quot; during its investigation , but Fuentes has been able to piece together several parts of the puzzle . A revised copy of the nearly completed official report , reviewed by The Times , rules_out collisions , fires or any scenario evoking the Bermuda Triangle . What probably happened ? &quot; All evidence points to the Vil Vana capsizing and sinking quickly without prior warning , &quot; Fuentes says . Fuentes ' own scenario will be an addendum to the final report , which is expected by the fall . He believes the Vil Vana was unstable in the water because of changes made to the boat before its last voyage . He believes pilot error may have caused the boat to veer sideways to a wave ; broadsided by waves , the trawler tipped to one side , took_on water and rolled_over . Fuentes thinks the vessel went_down with all seven men trapped inside , some in the hold , some in the pilot ' s cabin , some in the work area , which was enclosed by a 2-foot-by-4-foot lattice cage running from the pilot ' s cabin to the transom . Rollover &quot; may have been caused by a deadly combination of two or three factors , &quot; Fuentes says . But relatives of the victims refuse to accept rollover as the reason their men didn ' t come_back . &quot; That doesn ' t satisfy me , &quot; says Norma Watkins , frowning and lighting a cigarette . &quot; It ' s hard to believe not one of those men was able to get_off that boat and make_it to the island . Even if they all drowned , not one body popped_up . Bodies float. &quot; Unfortunately , the truth now sits at the bottom of Santa Barbara Channel . Recovery of the hull -- which Fuentes believes lies beneath 600 feet of water -- could clear_up several key questions , including the fate of the victims and whether another ship was involved . But the Coast Guard has no plans to find and salvage the Vil Vana . &quot; It ' s not part of our tasking , &quot; Fuentes says , explaining : &quot; The Coast Guard isn ' t in the salvage business . If we were , we would n ' t have any money to do anything else. &quot; QUESTIONS The Coast Guard investigation doesn ' t resolve many essential questions : If a crewman had the time to manually activate the emergency transmitter , why wasn ' t the ship ' s radio or cellular_phone used to call_for help ? Why did the transmitter malfunction at the time of the incident but work properly later during a Coast Guard bench test ? What time did the accident happen and where ? Why were no personal belongings found among the debris ? Where are the bodies ? The Coast Guard ' s hard evidence is minimal . Investigators traced the origins of the Vil Vana to a back-yard San Pedro boat maker who built the vessel as a net trawler 45 years ago . In December , 1992 , it was purchased for $ 18 # 000 by a 30-year-old Korean immigrant , Seong Choi of Oxnard . Choi became partners with a fellow Korean , John Kim , 25 , of Glendale . According to Fuentes , Choi and Kim &quot; were businessmen trying to be fishermen. &quot; At the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro , Fuentes says , the new owners converted the Vil Vana into a shrimp trawler . The net wheel in the stern and the swordfish plank on the bow , equipment weighing about 1 # 400 pounds , were removed . To store 200 or 300 shrimp traps , the stern area was rigged with the 2-by-4 cage , known as a hayrack or corral . A hydraulic drum for hoisting traps to the surface was installed on the starboard side of the cage . And , to make room for four 20-cubic-foot saltwater tanks in the hold , the 3 # 000 pounds of stone ballast were removed . Did the changes make the boat unstable ? Boating experts aren ' t sure , but Fuentes believes the tanks may have raised the vessel ' s center_of_gravity , making_it prone to tipping . In February , Choi and Kim sailed the Vil Vana to Ventura Harbor . Instead of leasing a slip , they paid a day rate to avoid paying insurance , which runs about $ 6 # 000 a year and would have required a safety inspection , boating experts say . Choi hired harbor resident Dan Pelton , 33 , to provide the fishing expertise and drive the boat , although Choi reportedly often took the helm . Pelton didn ' t have a captain ' s license , but friends and associates considered him an able , experienced fisherman and skipper . The Vil Vana initiated its first fishing trips weeks before the accident and went_out every day the week of the fateful voyage , hauling in large quantities of spot-fin prawns , fishermen say . Reportedly , Choi and Kim became unpopular around the docks for overfishing the area . Until the morning of April 9 , three of the seven crew_members had never been_on the Vil Vana . Kim took his 17-year-old nephew to dive for abalone . Pelton asked his friend and longtime sailor , Donnie Watkins , to crew . Watkins , 41 , brought along Ben Jordan , 24 , also of La Conchita . Jordan had known Watkins since he was 6 . &quot; Ben called me at 3:30 in the morning ( April 9 ) to tell me he decided to go_with Donnie instead of going_to stay with his girlfriend in Oxnard , &quot; says Jordan ' s mother , Barbara . Like Norma Watkins and Laura Huffman , Barbara Jordan launched her own tenacious investigation of the accident , interviewing Coast Guard officials and harbor locals . She learned that the Vil Vana came_in early on April 8 because of trouble with its 150-horsepower diesel_engine . &quot; I talked with people moored next to them and they said ( the crew ) was doing_work on the engine the morning they went_out , &quot; Jordan says . Although Don Watkins calls the Vil Vana &quot; a big lumbering piece of junk , &quot; it was not a shipwreck waiting to happen , says Chuck Connor , a friend of Dan Pelton and a Ventura lobster fishermen who had been aboard the boat once . &quot; It seemed perfectly fine , &quot; he says . &quot; It was a typical older boat , heavy built . But I know Dan Pelton . If that boat wasn ' t seaworthy , he would n ' t have been_on it. &quot; At a top speed of seven or eight knots an hour , the Vil Vana probably needed a good three hours to reach the east end of Santa Cruz Island , about 25 miles from Ventura Harbor . The seas were average -- three to five feet with occasional eight- to 10-foot swells -- and the winds were normal , increasing later in the afternoon to 15 to 20 knots . Patches of fog were reported , but otherwise the weather was clear , and visibility was 20 miles . Mike Pelton , Dan ' s brother , says the crew planned to set_about 300 traps off Chinese Harbor -- a task that involved placing open cans of cat_food in each trap and lowering a string of traps to the bottom -- and pick_up about 200 traps a_few miles to the west off Painted Cave . Mike Pelton , who searched the area in boats and also flew over in a hired plane shortly after the accident , says he found the newly set traps at Chinese Harbor , indicating that the Vil Vana was probably still afloat at midmorning . But he does not know the fate of the traps at Painted Cave . Fuentes , however , doubts the traps exist . &quot; They swept the whole area ( during the search ) and found nothing , no traps , &quot; Fuentes says . Originally , the Coast Guard reported the time of the accident at about 5:30 p.m. , when a COSPAS / SARSAT satellite received a 121.5 megahertz distress_signal from the Vil Vana ' s emergency transmitter , the Emergency Positioning Indicating Radio_Beacon ( EPIRB for short ) . But the official report now says a satellite recorded a 121.5 MHz signal from the Vil Vana at 2:58 p.m. In actuality , the Coast Guard now says , it has no idea when the flash_point occurred . &quot; We don ' t really know exactly when the EPIRB was activated , &quot; Fuentes says . &quot; It could have been as early as noon . We don ' t know. &quot; The EPIRB malfunction is a critical factor_in the Coast Guard ' s response_time and , possibly , the crewmen ' s fate . If the emergency system worked correctly , its 406 MHz signal would have transmitted the ship ' s location to within three miles and brought help in one or two hours . But in water temperature of 59 degrees , Vil Vana survivors would not have lasted more_than four hours without wet suits , Coast Guard manuals say . The accident probably occurred at least six hours before the helicopter pilot spotted the EPIRB ' s strobe . The failure of the EPIRB only compounds the mystery . Who adjusted it from automatic to manual and why ? How did the antenna become bent ? Why was the signal detected by some satellites and missed by others ? Why did the EPIRB ' s 406 MHz signal place its position , at various times , 800 miles off Northern California , 500 northeast of Oahu and 1 # 500 miles west of Mexico ? Why wasn ' t its 121.5 MHz signal -- receivable by satellite as well as FM radio -- picked_up by the direction_finder at the Channel Islands Harbor Coast Guard Station , which would have launched a rescue boat immediately ? ANSWERS The answers will probably never be known , but Fuentes believes the EPIRB was damaged in the turmoil and desperation of the rollover . After switching it on manually as the boat quickly filled with water , Fuentes says , a crewman may have freed the basketball-size device by forcing it outside the corral . The EPIRB may have floated under debris for a while , and its submersion , along with a bent antenna , &quot; probably impacted the accuracy of the signal , &quot; Fuentes says . Fuentes believes the Coast Guard response was by the book . A rescue effort couldn ' t begin until satellites began transmitting accurate information to U.S. Mission Control_Center computers , he says . Based in Langley , Va. , Mission Control receives information from satellites all_over the world . The control_room is often chaotic , with dozens of distress blips on the screen and no way to automatically determine which is a hoax , a mistake , or real . As_many as four confirmations are needed before alerts are dispatched to various rescue agencies . &quot; For the sake of using Coast Guard resources effectively , &quot; Fuentes says , &quot; we don ' t search for signals that disappear . It costs too much. &quot; At 6:35 p.m. , the Coast Guard had enough information to order a helicopter from its air_station at Los Angeles International Airport , but the craft didn ' t take_off until 7:43 p.m. -- a normal lag , Fuentes says . By 8:30 , the helicopter was honing in on the 121.5 MHz signal . The pilot saw the EPIRB ' s strobe a_few minutes later and dropped a flare , which illuminated a small debris field , mostly deck fodder from outside the cage . Despite a 42-hour search that covered 2 # 800 square_miles and involved a C-130 transport , two helicopters , three auxiliary aircraft and five ships , no other evidence of the Vil Vana ' s existence was found . Because the Vil Vana was fishing close to shipping lanes in the Santa Barbara Channel , next_of_kin speculate that it was either sideswiped or swamped by a deep-draft cargo_vessel or oil_tanker , behemoth ships that might not have seen a small vessel visually or on radar . &quot; It doesn ' t have to be a direct collision , &quot; Mike Pelton says . &quot; The bow wake on those ships can be as high as 20 or 30 feet . Fog comes_in from the west , the same direction as those ships . If you don ' t watch your radar , a ship could come_up on you in a minute and you could get run_over in a second. &quot; But the Coast Guard inspected all seven vessels that sailed_through the channel that day , Fuentes says . No evidence of a collision -- paint scrapings or dents -- was found . All seven captains were interviewed , &quot; but they said they didn ' t see any vessel , &quot; Fuentes says . The last large ship passed Santa Cruz Island , headed to Los Angeles about 1:30 p.m. and was in_sight of two other southbound deep-draft vessels , Fuentes says . Fuentes also checked_out the possibility that a Navy submarine could have snagged a line and dragged the Vil Vana under . But the Navy told him none of its ships , including subs and the Sea Shadow , was involved in an incident or a collision . The Navy also has issued a statement saying the stealth ship was in its berth on the south_side of Santa Cruz Island all day on April 9 . Even if the Vil Vana did roll_over , next_of_kin and others don ' t believe it could have sunk with such speed that crewmen were unable to extricate themselves . &quot; Those things don ' t go_down like a rock , &quot; Chuck Connor says . &quot; It never makes_sense that nobody got_off . The first thing Dan would have done was get his wet suit on -- he was capable of doing that in the water and he was a great swimmer. &quot; But Fuentes and other boating experts believe the sea can indeed swallow ships with sudden swiftness . &quot; ( Next_of_kin ) know their sons and husbands are survivors and it would take more_than a vessel rolling_over to take their lives , &quot; Fuentes says . &quot; But I ' ve seen videos of ships sinking_in 30 seconds. &quot; A ship ' s descent into the depths creates a vacuum and sucks flotsam down with it , experts say . Separating fact from fiction will get more difficult as time goes_by , making the Vil Vana ' s vanishing act even more inscrutable . But there are those who think the disappearance isn ' t as mysterious as it appears . The sea is cruel , arbitrary and unfathomable . The unthinkable happens . In 1917 , the U.S.S. Cyclops , a 600-foot Navy destroyer , vanished without a trace in the Atlantic . &quot; Boats have been known to disappear routinely , &quot; says John Johnson , president of Ventura Harbor Boatyard . &quot; No bodies . No nothing . My wife and I have lost friends . We had a friend lost at_sea in a steel-hulled fishing_boat that rolled_over for no apparent reason and sank quickly . These things happen more often than most people realize. &quot; The Santa Barbara Channel -- once referred to in local newspapers as &quot; the graveyard of the Pacific , &quot; can be unexpectedly treacherous -- the weather and currents confusing many experienced sailors . In December , 1835 , the side-wheel steamer Winfield Scott hit rocks off Anacapa Island and sank , with no fatalities . In February , 1876 , the 469-ton iron schooner Kalorama was beached by heavy seas , and broke_up at the foot of what is now Kalorama Street in Ventura , again without casualties . The Vil Vana took seven men to a watery grave , making the accident the county ' s worst boating disaster since the Marie , a 40-foot charter engaged in work for the U.S. Department_of_Defense , exploded off Santa Cruz Island on June 9 , 1960 , killing seven people . Only two bodies were recovered . The common notion that bodies float is misleading , experts say . When a body sinks , strong currents often bury it under silt on the ocean_floor , entombing it . Bodies not buried will rise slowly to the surface because of gas resulting from decomposition . But bodies rising from a depth of 600 feet would likely be picked clean by lobsters , shrimp , crabs and hagfish , all_of which are plentiful off Santa Cruz Island . &quot; We ' ve had other people never surface , &quot; says county Deputy Coroner Mitch Breese . &quot; This happens . They never come up. &quot; Families have looked_to politicians for help in getting answers , but they think they are being stonewalled . &quot; I ' m upset with ( Elton ) Gallegly , &quot; Norma Watkins says , waving a letter from the Republican congressman . &quot; He hasn ' t done a damn thing. &quot; Watkins and Laura Huffman have written several congressmen , sought assistance from the TV_show &quot; Unsolved Mysteries &quot; and made dozens of calls to the Coast Guard . Norma Watkins doesn ' t ever plan to give_up . &quot; I ' m not going_to stop pestering people , &quot; she says . They also have asked the Navy to find the Vil Vana , but the Navy doesn ' t do non-military salvage work , a spokesman says . Private salvage operators charge about $ 10 # 000 a day , Fuentes says . &quot; I ' d be happy if I knew in fact the boat was there , &quot; Huffman says , &quot; and if Donnie was there . R.I.P. At least he died the way he wanted to die. &quot; Huffman , the Watkinses and Barbara Jordan have filed a $ 5-million negligence lawsuit against John Kim ' s wife , whose name appears on the boat ' s title . U.S. citizenship is required to buy and use a ship for commercial purposes , so Choi and Kim had the ownership papers signed by Patricia Kim , an American . ( Efforts by The Times to reach her were unsuccessful. ) CHANGING LAWS The Coast Guard has ended its investigation ; it ' s the writing of the report that ' s now delaying completion . Fuentes , who has only been able to work_on the report intermittently because of other administrative duties , says he is fine-tuning , making_sure he sticks_to the facts . Jammed with diagrams , technical jargon , legalese and military talk , the finished report will go_to the Coast Guard commandant ' s office in Washington . Fuentes is including recommendations for improving safety in the fishing industry and doesn ' t want his credibility undermined by letting guesswork slip into the report . &quot; I don ' t want ( Coast Guard officials ) saying , ' He guesses . Why should we listen to his recommendations ? ' &quot; Fuentes says . &quot; It ' s going_to be really hard to take an incident with no hard evidence and support the recommendations I want to make to headquarters . I want to change laws , so I have to have my act together. &quot; Fuentes wants to improve training for commercial fishermen , tighten other boating regulations and educate the public not to rely exclusively on EPIRB ' s to save their lives . If he accomplishes this , Fuentes hopes to avoid another Vil Vana . &quot; I know ( the mystery ) is disheartening to next_of_kin , &quot; Fuentes says , &quot; but I have a message for them : I ' m not letting this go_away without action from headquarters. &quot; Still , Norma Watkins will step from her La Conchita yard and look_across the channel every day , her heart still not whole . &quot; It bugs me to see that island , &quot; she says . &quot; It ' s so damn close. &quot; The Story of the Vil Vana The Vil Vana , a commercial trawler , vanished just north of Santa Cruz Island on April 9 , 1993 . It was last seen at 4:30 a.m. that day , leaving the E dock at Ventura Harbor Village Marina . That afternoon , satellites picked_up distress_signals . The Coast Guard has only recovered debris from the boat . Neither the vessel nor the seven men aboard have been found . 1 ) Shrimp traps found 2 ) Sonar detects possible wreck 3 ) Emergency Positioning Radio_Beacon and debris found 4 ) Possible second set of traps * Seong Choi , 30 , of Oxnard , co-owner of the Vil Vana . * John Kim , 25 , of Glendale , co-owner of the Vil Vana . * William Choi , 17 , nephew of John Kim . No relation_to Seong Choi . * Unidentified male crewman , thought to be a Salvadoran immigrant . Sources : U.S. Coast Guard , families and friends of victims</TEXT>
