   <HEADLINE> PACIFIC LEADERS PLEDGE FREE_TRADE BY 2020</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Leaders of 18 Pacific Rim countries formally committed themselves Tuesday to dismantling all trade_barriers within the next 25 years , but last-minute objections from two nations showed how fragile their alliance remains . After a six-hour meeting at the opulent summer palace of Indonesian President Suharto , the leaders of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum ended their summit by pledging that their industrialized members will drop all barriers by the year 2010 and that developing countries will do so by 2020 . President Clinton , who last year began pushing the group toward such commitments , said the move should broaden trade and investment , bringing a harvest of benefits for all concerned , including average Americans . &quot; This is good news for the nations of our regions , and especially good news for the United States and our workers , &quot; said Clinton , who has made the creation of trade groups_a major foreign_policy objective . The agreement came_on the sixth day of a nine-day Asia trip by Clinton that today brings a state visit with Suharto . Clinton has promised to raise the issue of Indonesia ' s poor human_rights record at the session . Meanwhile , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher will meet with Indonesia ' s Human_Rights Commission , a government_agency . Although Tuesday ' s trade agreement is broad and non-binding , the countries hope it will create momentum to hasten the trend toward free_trade within a group that includes half the world ' s population and 40 % of its trade . Experts called it remarkable that such a diverse group of nations -- which includes the United States and Japan , Brunei , Mexico and China -- could even agree on common goals . But complications raised by South_Korea and Malaysia in this scrupulously scripted event suggested that the compact could rapidly become bogged down in_questions about the schedule on which the barriers will come_down and about who will qualify for special benefits . Last weekend , South_Korean officials were secretly pushing for a quicker elimination of trade_barriers and for assurances that theirs would not be classified as a developed country . Suharto , host of the event and key advocate of the program , resolved the issue by putting_off -- for now -- questions of which nations fall_into which category . But the questions are likely to resurface quickly in the months ahead as officials begin to develop a map for the nations ' movement toward freer_trade . Later Tuesday , at a news_conference in Jakarta , the Indonesian capital , Chinese President Jiang Zemin seemed to stake out his nation ' s position when he flatly declared , &quot; China ' s the biggest developing country. &quot; American officials , for their part , were arguing that the question was not vital because the rapid pace of development makes_it impossible to know which nations should still be classified as developing in 15 years . So far , it is clear only that the United States , Japan , Canada , Australia and New Zealand will be considered developed . More basic objections to the agreement were raised by Malaysian Prime_Minister Mahathir Mohammed . He joined the declaration only after enumerating in the formal session what an Administration official said was a &quot; series &quot; of reservations about the plan . Mahathir , who fears that the group may become a tool for U.S. domination in the region , said he is worried about the ability of small countries to compete in such a program . He said he is also reluctant to commit future leaders of his country to the plan . Administration officials acknowledged that Mahathir , who boycotted last year ' s meeting , may decide to drop_out entirely next year . But with Malaysia accounting_for only about 1 % of the group ' s economic output , officials said Mahathir ' s withdrawal would not be a fatal setback . Also surfacing before the plan ' s approval were questions about whether concessions to developing nations would make the pact a handy target for free-trade foes preparing to attack the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , the huge world trade proposal now before Congress . Some Administration officials , and some outsiders , have argued that the Asian deal could make the Administration vulnerable to charges that it is giving_away too many benefits to U.S. trading partners . Critics of the GATT agreement say the Administration is too easily surrendering national sovereignty in its provisions for new international trade rules . &quot; There ' s been nervousness all_over about this , &quot; said a senior Administration official . But the official said the Administration believes that Clinton can show the public that the system is fair . Clinton and other officials made the case that both sides will be making concessions . Because they have further to go , this argument goes , developing nations will actually take bigger trade-liberalization steps than will industrialized countries . Clinton gave the example of auto import tariffs . They constitute 30 % to 60 % of a car ' s price in Malaysia , Thailand and the Philippines , but only 2.5 % in the United States . Thus , while the developing countries will have longer to bring their barriers down , those barriers have farther to fall . &quot; No country will get more in benefits than it gives , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; No free riders. &quot; Suharto had prepared carefully to make the APEC summit a public relations coup , even going so far as_to have a celebrated Indonesian designer of batik garments tailor open-collared shirts for each leader attending . This morning , Clinton arrived_at the Istana Merkada Palace for a state visit with Suharto and a day of other meetings that may test how well Clinton can balance human_rights concerns with his desire to create stronger commercial ties with Indonesia . After an arrival ceremony at the palace , Clinton met Suharto to discuss trade and security concerns , and to lay out his views about Indonesia treatment of minorities , organized labor and the press . Later , Clinton was to talk to an audience of business people about U.S. concerns , including human_rights , as Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher met with the government human_rights commission and other U.S. officials talked to local human_rights organization . The members of APEC are the United States , Canada , Mexico , Chile , Thailand , Malaysia , Singapore , Indonesia , Brunei , the Philippines , Australia , New Zealand , South_Korea , Japan , China , Taiwan , Hong Kong and Papua New Guinea . At China ' s insistence , Taiwan was represented here only by a trade official . Strengthening Trade Relations The 18 member nations of APEC : 1 . U.S. 2 . Canada 3 . Mexico 4 . Chile 5 . China 6 .
