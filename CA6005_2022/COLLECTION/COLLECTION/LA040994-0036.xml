   <HEADLINE> GOLDEN STATEMENT ; THE ARTS AND CRAFTS MOVEMENT FROM THE TURN OF THE CENTURY GAVE US A DISTINCT DESIGN IDENTITY , AND THE STYLE HAS GAINED FAVOR IN RECENT YEARS . THE LAGUNA BEACH_HOUSE OF THE ELIEL FAMILY REFLECTS THIS CALIFORNIA HERITAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At the turn_of_the_century , California design meant cozy bungalows on large yards that complemented this area ' s incredible climate and natural_resources . * There were Craftsman bungalows , as well as Mission Revival , Spanish Colonial and other styles that used references from other lands but still created a house that was particular to California . During this time the California Arts and Crafts movement was in_full_swing , with artisans creating furniture from oak , lamps from copper and pottery from natural clay . The intervening 90-plus years have taken their toll on true California home design . There are few houses remaining that exemplify those original Craftsman ideals ; those that remain are found largely in older neighborhoods in communities such_as Tustin , Santa Ana , Orange , Huntington Beach and Laguna Beach . Much of Orange County ' s housing since has turned_to Europe for inspiration , but the home of Alan Blake Eliel , his wife , Lynda , and daughter Joanna deliberately takes its inspiration from the Craftsman era in the Golden State . Inside and out , their home_in a secluded canyon in Laguna Beach is a reflection of things Californian : The structure itself is a simple wood-frame house ; the furnishings and paintings are from the Arts and Crafts movement ; the plantings are indigenous to this area . &quot; A feeling of homogeneousness is missing in architecture locally . When you ' re in a village in France , you know you ' re in France . When you ' re in Switzerland , Italy or England , you know where you are . Here , you ' re not quite sure where you are architecturally , &quot; Eliel said . &quot; We keep looking past our great California heritage that some of the original architects in the area used. &quot; From the street , the Eliel home is unimposing and blends into the natural surroundings . The home , built_in 1976 , is not unlike many other small , single-family dwellings in the county . What is different about the house is the way Eliel has applied the principles of the California Arts and Crafts movement to it . Eliel , who is a landscape designer , has made a_few structural changes to the home -- such_as adding a wooden staircase -- and has surrounded it with drought-tolerant plants . The yard , primarily full of plants indigenous to California or native compatible , is in the best tradition of the Arts and Crafts movement , which believed that nature is an integral part of our lives . &quot; The Arts and Crafts movement was steeped in philosophy , &quot; Eliel said . &quot; It was all about learning to live_in harmony with nature . This 100-year-old movement was a reaction against both the excesses of the Victorian_Age and machine-made objects from the Industrial Revolution . &quot; One of the reasons for the re-emergence of this movement is the very same . People are searching again for meaning in life and looking_to nature. &quot; The Arts and Crafts practitioners went even further . They believed that the honesty of the materials used would promote honesty in the people who used them . &quot; This house in the canyon has had a profound influence on everything I ' ve done since I ' ve lived here , &quot; Eliel said . &quot; I believe a relationship with nature is like a relationship with people . The closer you are , the better the relationship . In my own humble way , I ' ve tried to use California ' s heritage in both the house and the garden. &quot; * To that end , Eliel has been collecting Arts and Crafts furniture and lamps , as well as California plein-air paintings , Craftsman pottery , antique Spanish serapes and Native_American blankets . &quot; I put my collection together because I thought it would be nice to have items that reflected California ' s art heritage . I ' m not a heavy-duty collector . I ' ve really emphasized good decorative art , landscapes and flowers that reflect my love of nature , &quot; Eliel said . He bought his first Arts and Crafts piece in the early 1970s at a used furniture store . It was a Morris chair and he paid $ 150 for it . &quot; At that time it was hard to find good , big , comfortable chairs . I liked the design , and I liked the fact that it was so sturdy and comfortable. &quot; ( Last summer , an oak Morris chair and ottoman by Gustav Stickley sold for $ 3 # 450 at an auction at Christie ' s. ) Eliel has left the walls of the house white so that the artwork is shown to its best advantage , giving the home a light and airy feeling . In the small entry hall , Eliel has placed a Gustav Stickley quarter-sawn fumed oak server with hand-hammered pulls that was originally meant to be used in a small dining_room . Atop the server are a hammered-copper pot executed at Roycroft Shops , an Arts and Crafts candleholder , a hand-colored photograph of Mt . Whitney from the turn_of_the_century , a gold-tone image of the redwoods painted on glass and a Dirk Van Erp hammered-copper lamp with a parchment-like stained mica shade . &quot; The lamp was marketed in San Francisco at the turn_of_the_century as a boudoir lamp . Its purpose is to create a glow . It ' s not for any kind of direct lighting , &quot; Eliel said . On the wall is a watercolor of yellow roses and bees by Paul de Longpre . &quot; He is Los Angeles ' first noteworthy watercolorist . He was originally from France and painted mainly flowers , &quot; Eliel said . * The home ' s dining_room perhaps best exemplifies the Arts and Crafts movement ' s philosophy , which valued simplicity of style rather than lavish expense . The room is furnished with an oak Stickley table and chairs , a James Swinnerton desert painting , a Stickley sideboard , copper owl candelabrum and Hampshire art pottery . &quot; Frankly I think that some of the Craftsman pieces are too heavy and clunky looking_for California , so I try to use the simpler pieces and give the rooms a more minimalist look , &quot; Eliel said . With the Craftsman pieces , he uses Native_American blankets and Spanish serapes , which add color , informality and a particularly California feeling to the rooms . Among items in the living room are a plein-air painting of Indian Wells and a Gustav Stickley hammered-copper oil_lamp that was converted to electric . The lamp has a shade made of mineral mica that was crushed and then had resin added_to it to harden it into a block . The pressed mica was then cut_into thin sheets with a band saw and fitted into the templates of the shade . The couch in the living room was inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement , but it is a contemporary piece that doubles as a bed for guests . Original Stickley furniture can be quite expensive . ( In 1988 Barbra Streisand paid $ 363 # 000 for a 1903 Stickley sideboard , although prices have gone_down since then. ) More affordable is new Stickley furniture , which is still manufactured at L . &amp; J.G. Stickley Inc. Using the original plans , this New York company continues to make the furniture almost the same way it was made at the turn_of_the_century , but it sells for a fraction of the cost of an original piece . &quot; You can tell the difference immediately because we use three guides_on each drawer , whereas the original ones had one , &quot; said Aminy Audi , who bought the Stickley Co . with her husband , Alfred , in late 1973 . &quot; Stickley furniture and the items from the Arts and Crafts movement really took_off in 1988 , and the market continues to grow. &quot; Audi said . ( The firm ' s furniture is available locally at Homestead House Inc. in Laguna Hills and at Baker Knapp &amp; Tubbs at the Design Center South. ) It ' s also possible to achieve the pared-down , natural look with items from other time_periods . Eliel , for example , has combined the Arts and Crafts pieces with native textiles that enhance the Craftsman feeling but are highly livable and keep the house from looking_like a museum . The underlying principles of the Arts and Crafts movement -- respecting nature , conserving materials and getting_rid_of unnecessary ornamentation -- can still make themselves very much at_home in California . * Those interested in a closer look_at California style can visit the Gamble House in Pasadena . Completed in 1908 by the architectural firm of Greene and Greene , it is a monument to the Arts and Crafts movement . The house at No . 4 Westmoreland Place is open_to the public Thursday through Sunday , from noon to 3 p.m. Admission is $ 4 for adults , $ 3 for seniors , $ 2 for students ; under 12 free . Groups of 10 or more need to make advance reservations . Call ( 818 ) 793-3334 .</TEXT>
