   <HEADLINE> THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE ; DEFENSE PATHOLOGIST A FAMILIAR FACE ; FORENSICS : NEW YORKER MICHAEL BADEN HAS WORKED_ON SEVERAL IMPORTANT CASES , INCLUDING THE SLAYINGS OF PRESIDENT JOHN F . KENNEDY AND MARTIN_LUTHER KING JR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nationally acclaimed pathologist Dr. Michael Baden , hired to assist in the defense of O.J. Simpson , needed no introductions when he arrived in Los Angeles to work_on the murder case . He already knew most of the principals working for the defense and prosecution . The New York City-based forensics specialist worked with Simpson attorney Robert L . Shapiro on the Christian Brando case and first met Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti when he performed a second autopsy on the body of former football star Ron Settles , who died mysteriously in the Signal Hill jail in 1981 . Baden has also locked horns at various times with members of the Los Angeles County coroner ' s office . Along the way , he has worked_on some of the most celebrated murder cases in recent history , including the slayings of President John F . Kennedy , Martin_Luther_King Jr . and Medgar Evers . Baden led the 1979 Congress-backed reexamination of evidence in the Kennedy assassination , which supported the original Warren Commission finding that Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman . In the King case , Baden disproved a theory that a black powder found on King ' s neck was gunpowder . If that contention had been true , it would have meant the civil_rights leader was fired on at close range and would have undermined the case against James Earl Ray , who was convicted of killing King . In the Evers case , Baden conducted a second autopsy 28 years after the civil_rights leader was gunned_down , and the findings helped convict 73-year-old Byron De La Beckwith , whose two earlier trials resulted in deadlocked juries . Whether Baden can come_up with the same headline-grabbing conclusions in the Simpson case remains to be seen . So far , he has been tight-lipped about the case , in which he is teamed with another well-known forensic scientist , Henry C . Lee . Baden ' s job will be to examine the positions of bodies , the depth of wounds , coloration around the wounds , the angles of penetration and anything else that contributed to the deaths of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman . If past cases are a guide , Baden probably will be able to determine , on the basis of wounds , which of the victims was struck first , whether the blows were defensive or offensive , whether elements such_as self-defense or torture were involved . Baden might also be able to tell whether the first blows were struck to kill , and whether there was an intent to kill both victims or just one . &quot; We are not here to look_for any particular evidence . We are here to find whatever evidence we find , &quot; he said . &quot; This means gathering evidence , and trying to reconstruct , as best as possible , what happened. &quot; Asked to describe what he does , Baden said : &quot; Our job is to listen to the dead_body and let it tell us what happened. &quot; On June 20 , Baden got his first glimpse of the findings of the autopsies performed by the Los Angeles County coroner ' s office on the two murder victims . On June 21 , less than 24 hours after picking_up the autopsy reports , Baden was in a courtroom in New Jersey , involved in another case . And the next day , he was back in Los Angeles , going_over autopsy reports and crime scene photographs in the coroner ' s office . Such transcontinental case-hoping is nothing new_to Baden , 59 , a tall man with longish gray hair , a bushy mustache and wire-rim glasses that give him a professorial look . He often handles several cases at once . Still another high-profile case he is working_on involves charges against Waneta Hoyt , a New York mother accused of killing five babies and blaming it on sudden_infant_death_syndrome . Baden is working for the prosecutors . The pathologist estimates that he has presided over 20 # 000 autopsies in a 32-year career . He works for the New York State Police as director of forensic sciences . But that is only a part-time job , and Baden often works for defense_attorneys as an independent pathologist . The physician ' s agreement with the state of New York is that he will never work against state prosecutors in a criminal case , but that he is free to work for defense_attorneys outside his home state . Baden , a former chief medical_examiner for New York City , estimates that he works for defense_teams about half the time in his private practice . A colleague , Dr. Cyril Wecht , said he and Baden were testifying in a Wilkes-Barre , Pa. , murder case when the New York City pathologist got the call from Shapiro asking him to join the Simpson case . Baden , in the Wilkes-Barre case , was testifying for the prosecution ; Wecht was testifying for the defense , not the first time they have locked horns . Wecht , a forensic pathologist and lawyer who works in Pittsburgh , served on the Kennedy committee and took the minority view , arguing against Baden that there was more_than one gunman . Despite those differences , Wecht said in a telephone_interview , he has high regard for Baden , calling him bright and very competent . Baden has had some successes undermining cases presented by Los Angeles County law_enforcement authorities . In the case of Christian Brando , the son of actor Marlon Brando , police accused the defendant of shooting his half_sister ' s lover to death as the victim lay sleeping on a couch . Brando said the gun went_off during a struggle with the victim , Dag Drollet . Baden , called into the case by Shapiro , found that gunshot residue on both of Drollet ' s hands could have been caused only if his hands were_on top or near the weapon , a finding that supported Brando ' s claim . The murder_charge against Brando was dropped and he was allowed to plead guilty to manslaughter . As for the Settles case , the coroner ' s staff , after examining the football star ' s body , supported the contention by Signal Hill police that the young_man had hanged himself in his jail_cell . After exhuming the body and conducting a second autopsy , Baden said he believed the death was caused by a chokehold administered by police . The family , which had brought Baden into the case , won a large settlement .</TEXT>
