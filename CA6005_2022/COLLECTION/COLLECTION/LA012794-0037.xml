   <TEXT> &quot; No , they don ' t . They make even sex sound boring nowadays. &quot; Jeremy Rex , 17 junior , El Modena &quot; In today ' s politically correct world , no one is daring to dig_into these subjects for fear of repercussions . As a result , the classes really teach us nothing . But most importantly , this gives us the impression that society really doesn ' t care -- that what we are doing right now is fine. &quot; Richard Kim , 15 sophomore , Villa Park &quot; I didn ' t learn anything I didn ' t already know. &quot; Isabella Roethel , 17 senior , Cypress &quot; Of course not . They don ' t tell you what the experience is really like . They just tell you to use protection. &quot; Marisa Alaniz , 16 junior , El Modena &quot; Sex education is the same every year . I don ' t need to hear what a condom is five times . . . . In one sentence I can sum_up my feelings : Tell me something I don ' t know. &quot; Mark Pearce , 17 junior , Aliso Niguel &quot; I think sex education sources should cover more , because lots of kids these days are having_sex and they need to know the facts. &quot; Shannon Dilday , 16 junior , Ocean View &quot; I think sex education in our school is limited in what they can teach us because of the parents ' concerns of what their child can hear and learn about sex . I believe we have the right to know about sex and AIDS . . . to educate us in the future so we can live safer and happier lives. &quot; San Kashani , 17 senior , Corona del Mar &quot; Dana Hills provides the basic knowledge that the students need to know . But after a certain point , it is the parents ' responsibility to elaborate on what their child needs to know. &quot; Tanya Radenovic , 17 senior , Dana Hills &quot; What courses ? &quot; Rob Fiege , 16 junior , Huntington Beach &quot; I think schools only cover certain parts of sex education . They only talk_about the physical part and what may happen , but they leave_out all_the emotional sides to it. &quot; Michelle Adney , 17 senior , Cypress &quot; The sex ed that I received in health class was very brief . It didn ' t go_into depth about the emotional strain or pressures . It doesn ' t do in-depth about the subject at all. &quot; Melissa Ann Horning , 15 junior , Sonora &quot; Sex ed courses in school only cover the physical side to having_sex . They teach you about protection from diseases and pregnancy , but fail to deal with the mental part of having_sex . Many teens have_sex before they are mentally ready to deal with it , because they feel they have to in_order to keep their boyfriend with them . Teachers need to stress that sex is a big step_in a relationship and unless teens are completely sure they want to and that they can be mature about it , they are not ready. &quot; Amanda Briggs , 16 junior , Huntington Beach &quot; They should go_into greater detail about sexually transmitted diseases. &quot; Dani Haynes , 15 sophomore , Fountain Valley &quot; They ' ve got all_the basic stuff ; they don ' t miss anything. &quot; Tan Tran , 15 sophomore , Westminster &quot; I think they are valuable because not a lot of kids get stuff on sex from their parents at_home because the parents won ' t take the time to talk_about it. &quot; Sarah Kidder , 17 senior , Irvine &quot; The sex education classes teach important facts and information that you need to know , but some values they stress are unrealistic for today ' s teen-agers. &quot; Melanie Messa , 16 junior , University &quot; There is not enough emphasis placed on the importance of abstinence . Safe_sex isn ' t 100 % safe , and that is what teen-agers need to know. &quot; Genoa Sibold-Chon , 16 senior , Villa Park &quot; The American Family Course at Cypress High_School is very informative and more_than covers what anyone may need to know. &quot; Shari Brookler , 18 senior , Cypress &quot; No , because they shy_away_from the subject of contraceptives . If they taught , among other things , how to correctly use them , they would not be promoting sex ; rather , they would be teaching responsibility. &quot; Anonymous , 17 senior , Fountain Valley &quot; No -- because they don ' t talk enough about AIDS. &quot; Mike Keene , 17 junior , Westminster &quot; The basics , enough so you shouldn ' t get_in trouble. &quot; Scott Klase , 18 senior , Corona del Mar &quot; No , because there ' s not even a sex education class at my school besides health. &quot; Tracy Wilkinson , 16 junior , Ocean View &quot; They cover what we need to know , I guess , even though kids in high_school already know most of it already. &quot; Luke Carlson , 17 junior , Irvine &quot; We don ' t really have_sex education at our school . It ' s only covered_for about two weeks in health class . I think they are too scared to tell us the whole truth about sex. &quot; Tim Shinn , 16 junior , Cypress * NEXT WEEK What New Year ' s resolution have you already broken ?</TEXT>
