   <HEADLINE> FEINSTEIN WORKER ENTERED U.S. LEGALLY , BUT VISA LAPSED ; POLITICS : INS RECORDS INDICATE NO VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW . HUFFINGTON CONTINUES TO MAKE THE HIRING AN ISSUE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After several wild days of accusations and retractions in the fiercely contested U.S. Senate_race , the Immigration and Naturalization Service confirmed Friday that the woman employed by U.S. Sen . Dianne Feinstein as a housekeeper in the early 1980s entered the country with a legal work_permit that expired while she was working for Feinstein . The INS records suggested no violation of federal law by Feinstein , but show that the housekeeper apparently remained in the country illegally while working for Feinstein . The records also show that the woman ' s work visa limited her to working_at the Guatemalan Consulate . The records appeared to buttress claims by Feinstein that she did not hire an illegal immigrant and that the woman had some documentation -- a visa -- at the time of her employment . If the woman had presented that documentation to an employer , it would have been virtually impossible for anyone but an immigration expert to recognize the restrictions , an INS official said Friday . Meanwhile , Republican challenger Mike Huffington left no doubt he would use the fact that the woman ' s work_permit expired in November , 1980 -- and that she was technically eligible to work only at the consulate -- to continue to attack Feinstein . Huffington had been_on the defensive for more_than a week after it was revealed that he and his wife had employed an illegal immigrant nanny until last year , apparently violating immigration and tax laws . Even though the circumstances of Feinstein ' s hiring in the early 1980s differed significantly from those of Huffington , the distinction was likely to be blurred in the final days of the bitter campaign that is the most expensive ever waged for a congressional seat . The immigration issue was only one of a series of events in the Senate_race Friday : * In another sign of the race ' s volatility , KNBC-TV released a poll that showed Feinstein with a 16-point lead over Huffington , up 10 points from a poll two weeks ago . The 52 % -36 % margin came only days after another poll , done_by a local television_station , showed Huffington with a 2-point lead over Feinstein . KNBC attributed its results to Huffington ' s recent disclosure about employing an illegal immigrant for more_than four years . * Entering the last frantic weekend of campaigning , Feinstein traveled_to several cities while Huffington concentrated_on Los Angeles , with several television appearances . On a local cable_television program , he called Feinstein a &quot; hypocrite &quot; and accused the INS of a &quot; cover-up , &quot; though he offered no proof . * Campaign disclosure reports showed that Huffington gave another $ 500 # 000 to his campaign , raising the total to nearly $ 28 million , which sets a national spending record for a congressional race . Feinstein loaned her campaign $ 70 # 000 , bringing its total close to $ 11 million . * The Associated Press asked the Huffington campaign to withdraw a new commercial attacking Feinstein because , the wire_service said , it was quoted erroneously in the ad . The Huffington campaign refused the request . The illegal immigrant accusations frustrated Feinstein ' s effort to draw attention to her record of bipartisan support in cities and counties . In news_conferences in Fresno and Sacramento , she maintained that the woman she hired as a housekeeper in 1980 presented documentation showing that she was in the United States legally . Late in the day , her campaign also released W-2 statements showing that Feinstein paid taxes and Social_Security for the housekeeper . Campaigning in Sacramento , Feinstein said : &quot; Never in the history of this nation has there been a race like this where one person with no record and no performance . . . has spent so_much to attack and slander. &quot; Repeating a recent theme of her campaign , Feinstein implored her supporters to turn_back Huffington ' s expensive campaign . &quot; A Senate seat cannot be bought . A Senate seat must be earned . And the way you earn it is by performing , &quot; she said . Feinstein ended her day of campaigning with a rally at Los Angeles City_Hall with President Clinton . Even before the INS disclosure Friday it was clear that Feinstein ' s hiring occurred long before the 1986 federal law that made_it a crime to hire illegal immigrants . But throughout the day , Huffington accused Feinstein of lying_about her former housekeeper ' s status and violating an obscure California labor law by hiring the housekeeper . The housekeeper was quoted by Associated Press_on Friday as insisting she was in the country legally . &quot; Yes , I was legal . I already talked with her ( Feinstein ) and I am not going_to say anything more , &quot; she said . At the San Francisco house where the woman now works as a housekeeper , her husband told The Times that she had entered the country legally and was permitted to work_at the time she was employed by Feinstein . Miguel Realegeno disputed Huffington ' s ads saying that his wife was an illegal worker . Richard Kenney , an INS spokesman in Washington , said a woman identified as Annabella del Rosario Legrand-Cabrera Realegeno , 44 , entered the United States on Nov . 17 , 1979 , on a one-year visa that allowed her to work for the Guatemalan Consulate in San Francisco . He said that visa was good until Nov . 16 , 1980 -- months after Feinstein has said she hired the woman . Kenney said INS records show that the woman ' s work authorization was limited to employment at the Guatemalan Consulate . But Kenney said it would have been very difficult for someone who was not an expert to determine what its limitations were . Although the INS said the records did not suggest any violation of the law , the Huffington campaign said the information showed that Feinstein employed an illegal worker and that this constituted a violation of state law . But the California labor code only prohibits an employer from &quot; knowingly &quot; hiring an illegal immigrant and nothing the Huffington campaign said on Friday undercut Feinstein ' s contention that she thought the woman had proper documentation when she hired her . &quot; As I ' ve said , this was back in 1980 , the person in_question handed me documentation , &quot; Feinstein told reporters as she campaigned in Northern California . &quot; It looked verifiable to me . And I hired her. &quot; The Feinstein campaign called_on television_stations to stop running the Huffington ad on the issue , saying it was &quot; potentially libelous. &quot; In a letter to the stations , campaign manager Kam Kuwata noted that Associated Press has challenged the accuracy of the ad . Associated Press San Francisco bureau chief Dan Day , who faxed a letter of protest to the Huffington campaign Thursday night , said Friday the news service was asking that the ad be pulled . &quot; The erroneous information in your ad can substantially damage ( Associated Press ' s ) reputation . Please confirm to me that you will discontinue this misrepresentation of the AP ' s reporting , &quot; Day wrote . In other developments this week : * A Senate ethics complaint filed Friday contends that Feinstein would have personally benefited from her efforts to allegedly influence the Justice and Agriculture_departments to drop 34 civil fraud suits against Sunkist Growers and its members . Feinstein wrote officials this year , supporting dismissal of the whistle-blower suits , which seek $ 80 million to $ 400 million from Sunkist Growers for violating federal quotas on citrus shipments , the complaint said . The complaint alleges that Feinstein held an interest in Newhall Land and Farming , which grows oranges and lemons for Sunkist -- based on Feinstein ' s 1992 financial disclosure statement showing an investment of $ 500 # 000 to $ 1 million . Her 1993 disclosure lists the investment at less than $ 1 # 000 , however . Richard Blum , Feinstein ' s husband , said one of his partnerships divested the Newhall asset in September , 1993 . The ethics complaint was filed by James Moody , an attorney for Sequoia Orange Co. , the firm that filed the whistle-blower suit against Sunkist . Ethics experts said Feinstein ' s letters appear to fall within Senate rules . Hadley Roff , Feinstein ' s staff director in California , said her letters were proper . The Justice_Department in September sought dismissal of the Sunkist case , despite having previously intervened on behalf of Sequoia . A spokesman said Feinstein ' s letter played no part in the decision . * State tax officials have questioned a former bookkeeper for the Huffington family as they opened a preliminary inquiry to determine if sales taxes of about $ 6 # 250 were paid on furnishings for the candidate ' s Montecito mansion . The inquiry was prompted by the claim of bookkeeper Claudia Bratton that Huffington ' s wife , Arianna , purchased at least $ 100 # 000 worth of chairs , draperies and other items with a tax card issued to her sister , Agapi Stassinopoulos , by the State Board of Equalization . The card allows interior_designers to buy items from wholesalers without paying sales tax , if the goods are to be resold . But if the items are for personal use , the cardholder must pay the tax . Bratton ' s lawyer said his client is merely reporting what she saw while working for Arianna Huffington during several months in 1990 . Jennifer Grossman , a spokeswoman for the Huffington campaign , denounced the assertions as &quot; outrageous &quot; and said Stassinopoulos had paid all_the required sales_taxes . Bryan G . Gaggs , an accountant who worked for Stassinopoulos , said he believes &quot; all returns were filed on a timely basis , and that full compliance with California sales tax laws was effected. &quot; Also contributing to this story were Times staff writers Dave Lesher and Greg Krikorian in Los Angeles , Mark Gladstone and Virginia Ellis in Sacramento and Ralph Vartabedian in Washington .</TEXT>
