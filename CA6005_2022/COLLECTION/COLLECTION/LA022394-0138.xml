   <HEADLINE> LILLEHAMMER / ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS ; DRAMA MOVES INSIDE RINK ; FIGURE_SKATING : THERE ' S MORE TO EVENT THAN THE KERRIGAN-HARDING SAGA . BAIUL , BONALY ARE EARLY FAVORITES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Based on the media coverage they have received , it might seem as if there are only two contenders in women ' s figure_skating at the Winter_Olympics , Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding . In fact , there are as_many characters in this drama as in a Russian novel . Sorry , tabloid fans , that is not a subtle reference_to &quot; Crime and Punishment. &quot; This is a story about figure_skating and the women who will compete , starting with tonight ' s technical program . Before Kerrigan was injured in an assault Jan . 6 at the national championships in Detroit , which Harding ' s ex-husband and others allege Harding helped plan , neither woman was expected to cause much fuss here . Harding did not even qualify for the 1993 World Championships , and Kerrigan finished fifth . Because no American woman won a medal , the United States was restricted to fewer than three competitors in the Winter Games for only the second time since 1924 . Kerrigan and Harding have improved since last winter , or at least that was the consensus when they arrived in Detroit , but they are not the way to bet . In the most recent line posted by Ladbrooke ' s of London , Ukraine ' s Oksana Baiul was the favorite , followed by France ' s Surya Bonaly , then Kerrigan . The contenders : OKSANA BAIUL , 16 , Ukraine The waif-like Baiul ( By-YUL ) established herself as the overwhelming favorite last winter , when she became the youngest world champion since Sonja Henie in 1928 . She was just the young_woman judges were searching for , a ballerina on ice . But whether it is because everyone in the sport is scrutinizing her more_than they did before or whether her body is maturing , it has become evident in recent months that she is not as strong or as consistent with her jumps as some of her competitors . She also was distracted during training by reporters who found their way to her Ukrainian training sites , initially in her hometown of Dneprpetrovski and later in Odessa , to hear her story . It is a compelling one . Her father left home when she was 2 , and she did not see him again until the funeral of her mother , who had died of cancer , 11 years later . Orphaned , Baiul slept on a cot in the rink where she trained until her coach left for Canada . Asked to step_in , Galina Zmievskaya initially demurred because she knew she would be required to serve not only as a coach but a parent . But her most successful student , 1992 Olympic champion Viktor Petrenko , talked her into it . &quot; She is only one girl , &quot; he said . &quot; How much can she cost ? &quot; Two years later , Baiul was the world champion . Weeping with joy afterward , she told her coach , &quot; These tears are God ' s kisses from my mother in heaven. &quot; SURYA BONALY , 20 , France A former gymnast , Bonaly ( Bone-a-LEE ) will never skate with the grace necessary to win true acceptance among the judges . But she may win a gold medal because she can out-jump almost every woman to compete in the sport and many of the men . She is so powerful that she has difficulty finding skates strong enough to withstand the torque of her takeoffs without wobbling . Exacting revenge for her second-place finish to Baiul in last year ' s World Championships , Bonaly recently won her fourth consecutive European championship . Bonaly ' s story is almost as intriguing as Baiul ' s . She was adopted by a gym teacher and an ecologist who reared her on a diet of macrobiotic food and Zen . They told reporters for years that she had been born_on Reunion , an island in the Indian_Ocean . A French magazine even paid_for her to spend a weekend there so it could photograph her on the beach , surrounded by coconuts . But as Bonaly approached 18 , when the record of her birth by French law would become available , they admitted that she had been born in Nice . Suzanne Bonaly is a stereotypical skating mother who scared_off numerous coaches and even Surya for a while . But Bonaly , a practice-a-holic who works_out eight hours a day , could not stay away , and , with the assistance of Frank Carroll during summers at Lake Arrowhead ' s Ice Castle , has improved her style . CHEN LU , 17 , China Another woman who makes the summer pilgrimage to figure_skating ' s new Mecca at Lake Arrowhead , there to train with Carlo Fassi , Chen emerged with a sixth-place finish in the 1992 Winter_Olympics , one behind Bonaly , then vaulted to third in the subsequent World Championships . She , however , seems to have stalled there , again winning the bronze in last winter ' s World Championships , and is believed to have only an outside chance of improving here . Chen ' s mother is a table_tennis instructor , and her father is a former ice_hockey player in the Jilin province of northeast China , who taught all three of his daughters to skate . But two of them quit because they did not believe they could become competitive athletes and remain feminine , a faulty premise that Chen disproved . The first figure skater of note in a country with more_than a_billion people and only 10 indoor ice_rinks , Chen , called Lu Lu by her friends , had no role_models , developing her artistic approach by studying videotapes . As a result , she sometimes seems mechanical . A smile here and there would help . But she more often loses points for the inconsistency of her jumps , a problem that has been exacerbated as her center_of_gravity has shifted with age . TONYA HARDING , 23 , U.S. A drag-racing , gun-toting , pool-hustling , cigarette-smoking hellion from the wrong side of the tracks in Portland , Ore. , she was an outsider in the sport even before this mess with Kerrigan . But when she is_on , the judges cannot deny her . She , however , has not been really on since 1991 , when she became only the second woman , the first American , to land the demanding triple axel and , for a brief , glistening moment , had no equals in the world as she upset Kristi Yamaguchi for the national championship . Enduring a series of on- and off-ice crises , her career since has steadily descended . She was second in the world in 1991 , fourth in the Olympics and sixth in the World Championships in 1992 and off the charts in 1993 . The fact that she is even here is a tribute to her perseverance . Although she has worked hard to soften her style , judges do not think much more of her in that category than they do Bonaly . But if Harding survives the technical program and lands the triple axel in the freestyle , a feat she has not accomplished since the fall of ' 91 , look_out . NANCY KERRIGAN , 24 , U.S. In the Nancy vs . Tonya , good vs . evil morality_play presented live and in_color for the last six weeks , Kerrigan has been portrayed by some as a New England ice princess . In fact , she is as blue collar as they come . The daughter of a welder and a legally blind mother , she grew_up playing ice_hockey on outdoor rinks with her brothers . As a junior figure skater , she was considered a jumper . But as she matured , she developed long , clean lines and an elegant style that often was compared to Katarina Witt ' s . The flip side of that transformation was that Kerrigan no longer could count_on her jumps , a problem that her coaches considered mental . When she began seeing a sports psychologist in 1991 , she had her best year , finishing third in the world . But she is a shy , introspective woman who did not like having her psyche probed and quit seeing the psychologist a year later . Although she finished third in the Olympics and second in the world in 1992 , her skating went backward . Favored to win the world championship last year , she finished fifth . Persuaded to return to a sports psychologist , she entered this season with renewed confidence and was skating marvelously before the assault in Detroit that knocked her out of the national championships . She has not competed since early December , so it is anyone ' s guess how she will perform here . KATARINA WITT , 28 , Germany A two-time gold medalist who took_advantage of a new rule that allowed professionals to return to serious competition , Witt chose to go_for it even though she has been left far behind by the younger_women in technical ability . Because of that , critics called her comeback a publicity stunt . She has proven them wrong . Not only is she in better shape than she was when she won her second gold medal in 1988 , her freestyle program is more demanding than was her Carmen in Calgary . &quot; I was really flirting my way through that one , &quot; she acknowledges . This time , she has a message . She is skating her freestyle program to the Pete Seeger anti-war hymn , &quot; Where Have All The Flowers Gone ? , &quot; as a tribute to Sarajevo , where she won her first gold medal . She does not have the tricks to win , but only Baiul can challenge her artistically .</TEXT>
