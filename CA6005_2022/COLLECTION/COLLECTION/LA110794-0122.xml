   <TEXT> Worshipers at Ronald and Nancy Reagan ' s church in Bel-Air said a prayer for the former President and his family . Visitors flocked to the Reagan library near Simi Valley in unusually high numbers , talking_about Reagan the man rather than his politics . And the Los Angeles office of the Alzheimer ' s Assn . was flooded by calls from across the country as Alzheimer ' s disease officially entered the national spotlight . A day after Reagan ' s disclosure that he is in the early stages of the disease , people across the Southland marveled at his gutsiness in going public with his ailment . At Bel Air Presbyterian_Church , the Rev . Carolyn Crawford led worshipers in asking_for divine help &quot; so that he will show courage and continue to be an example. &quot; The 2 # 000-member congregation has included the Reagans since 1965 , but the couple were reported_out of town and not in_attendance at Sunday ' s services . Congregant Wilma Sallman , 75 , said she was glad Reagan had come_forward with his sickness . &quot; He ' s always been upfront , &quot; she said . &quot; He tells it like it is. &quot; Frances Moore speculated that Reagan announced his ailment &quot; in self-defense &quot; to fend_off rumors and possible media leaks . Eventually , she noted , &quot; the disease gives itself away. &quot; At the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library , visitors remembered the former President ' s vitality as a public man . &quot; I met him about a year ago down in Century City and he was still full of one-liners , &quot; said Hal Everett , a retired salesman from Thousand Oaks who worked as a volunteer at the library for three years . &quot; At the time he seemed to be very healthy . &quot; He has slowed_down over the years and he doesn ' t come_up here as much as he used to , but when I met him he was still very sharp , &quot; said Everett , 72 . &quot; I ' d have voted for him again this year if he ' d run. &quot; Joseph Everson brought his friend Bjorn Sandvik of Norway to the Reagan library to see the videotape of Reagan ' s challenge to then-Soviet leader Mikhail S . Gorbachev to tear_down the Berlin Wall . &quot; I ' m a Democrat and did not agree with him in many issues , &quot; said Everson , a religious studies professor at Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks . &quot; But his place in history is secure. &quot; Another visitor , Lee Sudman , a retired furniture salesman from Tarzana , questioned Reagan ' s own assessment that he was now in &quot; the sunset of my life. &quot; &quot; The guy ' s got plenty of stamina , &quot; Sudman said . &quot; This isn ' t going_to kill him . He ' s a strong guy. &quot; Peter Braun , executive_director of the Los Angeles chapter of the Alzheimer ' s Assn. , said people with loved ones who have Alzheimer ' s disease had inundated the office with calls , spurred to ask_for help by Reagan ' s disclosure . He called Reagan ' s announcement &quot; a transforming moment for the cause &quot; and said he expected it to help increase awareness of the disease as well as funding for research . The Alzheimer ' s Assn. , Braun said , will soon begin &quot; developing a very aggressive and impressive public relations campaign &quot; to educate the public about Alzheimer ' s disease . But Sunday , he said , his office was busy dealing with media inquiries and calls .</TEXT>
