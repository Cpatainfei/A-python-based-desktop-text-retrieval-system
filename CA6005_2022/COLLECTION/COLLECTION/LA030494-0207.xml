   <TEXT> The Federal Emergency Management Agency has asked scientists to estimate future seismic shaking in Los Angeles , Orange and Ventura counties to help the government decide where to spend money devoted to earthquake mitigation . Richard Buck , a FEMA official , said Thursday the estimates will be used to decide how much money should go toward strengthening public buildings that were damaged in the Jan . 17 Northridge earthquake . No repair projects will be scrapped even if the estimates show a high probability of future quake damage , he said . But decisions on earthquake mitigation measures that go beyond code requirements would be affected , Buck said . Earthquake scientists who have been working since 1992 to calculate the probability of future quakes are participating . Their reports will be used to help analyze the benefits and costs of specific repair projects . A Sacramento consulting_firm , Goettel &amp; Horner , will do the analysis . This is apparently the first time that the panel of scientists from various California universities and the U.S. Geological Survey , working under the auspices of the Southern California Earthquake Center at USC , has prepared probability estimates that will have a direct effect on how a government_agency chooses to spend money on stemming quake hazards . The project was revealed at a Thursday news briefing at the Earthquake Center . Many of the scientists have said that the probability of big earthquakes in the Southland has been increased by the 1992 Landers quake and the Northridge quake . Kenneth Goettel , a geologist who is a partner in the Sacramento firm , said the study will provide estimates on the quake risks in 65 zones of urban Southern California . &quot; If you only have money to mitigate hazards in one building , you may do_it where the highest risk is , &quot; Goettel said . &quot; But you might decide to move the building to a less risky area , or that the risks are too high to justify the costs. &quot; Goettel and FEMA emphasized that perceived quake risks would not be the only factors used in allocating the mitigation money . Political factors , including the desires of local officials to emphasize certain projects , such_as seismic reinforcement of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum , are also considered . &quot; We also ask how many lives will be saved by mitigating hazards at specific locations , &quot; Buck declared . &quot; That is one method of determining what is most worth spending money on. &quot;</TEXT>
