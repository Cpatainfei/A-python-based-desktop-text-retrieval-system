   <TEXT> Diann Roffe-Steinrotter can go_off and ride her horses now , on summer days along the Raquette River near Potsdam , N.Y. She can stand_in the stirrups and catch warm breezes . She can know contentment . She can carry with her Tuesday ' s Olympic victory in the women ' s super-giant slalom at Kvitfjell , the latest American success on the slopes here . Russia ' s Svetlana Gladischeva won the silver , Italy ' s Isolde Kostner the bronze . For Roffe-Steinrotter , it was the end of a beginning , a last ride into one sunset , the first into another . She spoke excitedly of plans , of pursuits , of normality , of her love for equestrian , as the metaphor grew of Roffe-Steinrotter upon her white steed , galloping away in the classic hero ' s exit . Hers was not a quixotic quest , she claimed , nor her dream impossible . &quot; I ' m sure all_of you are surprised , &quot; she told assembled reporters . Shocked might have been a better word . Only Roffe-Steinrotter could know how she , at 26 , found it within her to muster such a last-chance charge for the ages . In the ski business , where careers are short , she was Jack Nicklaus winning the Masters in his 40s . Except Nicklaus didn ' t drop his clubs and walk away . Hours after her stunning triumph in the super-G , an event in which she ranked 36th in the world , Roffe-Steinrotter announced her retirement , effective next month after the World Cup_finals in Vail , Colo . The farewell speech , actually , had been written before the Games -- independent of Olympic success or failure . She had to scribble fast to keep one step ahead of the whispers . She had fought , unsuccessfully for two years , to recapture her last great moment , at Albertville in 1992 , when she claimed the Olympic silver in giant slalom . Now , she claims amnesia . &quot; It ' s hard to compare today with low points , &quot; she said . &quot; Low points don ' t exist right now. &quot; In an 11-year career , Roffe-Steinrotter has been nothing if not proud . History tends to remember what you did last , not first . She won the world championship in giant slalom at 17 , an Olympic silver but , before Tuesday , it had been nine years between international victories . Her ski clock was ticking , but she refused to go gently . &quot; I didn ' t want to cop_out , &quot; she said . &quot; I wanted to stick it out. &quot; Her best finishes in super-G this season were 28th , 27th and 25th , but there were , she guessed , no laws stating that she could not win . Even so , Roffe-Steinrotter said , she was so prom-night nervous as she stood_in the start gate she was &quot; just dying. &quot; By luck of the draw , she was the first skier down the course . Bib No . 1 . Most would say she drew short straw . There are no training runs in super-G . It ' s a blind race . You can inspect the setting of the gates only by side-stepping up the side of the course . Olympic rookies might have panicked . But what Roffe-Steinrotter lacked in skiing power , she made_up for in know-how . Before the race , she mapped_out the course , memorized it . It was fast on top , more suited to downhillers , but the course tightened in the middle stretch and at the end , which played into her slalom skills . &quot; I saw the critical turns , &quot; she said . &quot; that ' s experience , I guess. &quot; More_than others , she also knew what it would take . &quot; It takes risks , &quot; she said . &quot; that ' s another advantage of experience . I didn ' t want to be fourth , fifth or sixth in the Olympics . If you don ' t risk everything , you won ' t be there. &quot; Roffe-Steinrotter was ready to risk it all , and it scared her . She had started No . 1 in the super-G at Albertville and crashed . &quot; Don ' t think that didn ' t go_through my mind , &quot; she said . Planted too was the memory of Austrian Ulrike Maier , a favorite to win the Olympic super-G , who risked everything and died Jan . 29 in a downhill crash in Germany . &quot; I thought a lot about Ulli , &quot; Roffe-Steinrotter said . &quot; She could race like no other . She should have been an American , the way she raced in big races . If she ' s up there , looking down , she would tell every competitor on the_hill just to point your skis down and give it your best . She was such a fighter . I wanted to do the same thing. &quot; The course played just as she had seen it . Roffe-Steinrotter was slow on top , but held a tight line from the middle through the finish . Her time , 1 minute 22.15 seconds , meant nothing until it was measured against the field . When she crossed the finish_line , Roffe-Steinrotter could only shrug her shoulders . &quot; I didn ' t know , &quot; she said . Italy ' s Kostner skied second and finished . 30 behind the American . Knowing of Roffe-Steinrotter ' s woes this season , Kostner said later she thought she had skied poorly and was out of contention . She ended_up with the bronze . Roffe-Steinrotter ' s time held through six racers , but had yet to be challenged by Murderers ' Row , a list of skiers that included Germany ' s Katja Seizinger , the gold-medal favorite . When Seizinger crashed on course , the crowd let_out telling gasp . Slovenia ' s Alenka Dovzan , wearing bib No . 13 , was leading Roffe-Steinrotter by . 42 after the second interval , but she , too , skied off course . Slovenia ' s Spela Pretnar , from starting position 28 , had the lead by . 27 before she crashed . Roffe-Steinrotter had started to relax when Gladischeva , a longshot , started scorching the course from the 35th start . She came_up just short , . 29 behind the American , which was good_enough for the silver , the first medal for Russia in an Olympic Alpine event . America ' s Angst turned_to euphoria . &quot; I ' m pretty lucky to pull this one off , the way my season ' s been , &quot; Roffe Steinrotter acknowledged . &quot; But no one can take this away . No one can take it away. &quot; Years from now , no one will remember how close the 1994 gold medalist came_to not making the Olympic team . Or how Paul Major , the U.S. Alpine director , drew_up qualifying criteria the previous summer -- ostensibly to fire_up or weed out the aging veterans -- and how Roffe-Steinrotter had not met those standards . They won ' t remember how she had hit rock_bottom Dec . 4 in Tignes , France , when she failed to qualify for a second giant slalom run and wondered how much deeper into the bog she could sink . Major suggested there was nowhere else to go but up . Or out . It didn ' t help that the only decent showing for Roffe-Steinrotter this season didn ' t even count . In January , she was perched in eighth place in a super-G at Altenmarkt , Austria , when the race was canceled after 30 women had skied because of deplorable course conditions . Yet , when it came time to pick the U.S. team , Major penciled in Roffe-Steinrotter ' s name . Call it a lifetime-achievement award . &quot; I don ' t think he ' s regretting the decision now , &quot; she said . Major was expecting a strong performance , but certainly not gold . &quot; It ' s the most amazing thing I ' ve ever seen in athletics , &quot; Major said . &quot; She was down and out , everyone gave_up on her . Then , she wins the gold. &quot; The U.S. beat goes_on . The super-G gold was the second of the week , a match for Tommy Moe ' s gold in downhill . U.S. ski fever is contagious . Shannon Nobis , 21 , brought_to Lillehammer to get some experience for the 1998 Olympics , finished 10th in the super-G , a result nearly as stunning as Roffe-Steinrotter ' s . First-time Olympian Megan Gerety , whose main claim to fame this week is being Moe ' s girlfriend , was headed for a top-10 finish when she went_off course six gates from the finish . Hilary Lindh finished 13th , her best super-G result of the season . Major , ebullient and boastful , issued a challenge to the U.S. men . &quot; Tag , you ' re it , &quot; he said . Winning heals all wounds . But even a gold medal can ' t lure Roffe-Steinrotter back . She is the only married member of the women ' s team , having fallen_for Willie Steinrotter , a childhood friend . They became more_than friends after the 1988 Calgary Olympics , when Diann returned home and Willie asked her to dinner . Steinrotter ' s father had taught the young Roffe to ski at the Brantling Ski Club in Potsdam . Willie , a soccer and ski coach at Clarkson University in Potsdam , took a leave_of_absence to follow his wife to Europe for her last season . Tuesday , he stood , stunned . &quot; The only way I can describe it is , if you took all_the good_days that happen to you , and wrap them into one , that ' s how I feel , &quot; Willie said . Roffe-Steinrotter feels_like the mother hen among chicks on the U.S. team . She doesn ' t giggle anymore , or chase boys . Or engage in pillow_fights . &quot; I live a different life than I did at 17 , &quot; she said . &quot; I like quiet , being at_home , spending time with my family . This is not the sport that keeps you at home. &quot; Roffe-Steinrotter plans to devote more of her time to horses . She has been riding all her life and would like to concentrate_on equestrian competition . Maybe go_for the gold in that . If not , it has already been a great ride .</TEXT>
