   <HEADLINE> ADVENTURE TRAVEL : NEW YORK : SKIING HUT TO HUT ; WEEKEND CROSS-COUNTRY ENTHUSIASTS TACKLE THE WILDERNESS TRAILS OF THE ADIRONDACKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Kapow ! In the dark forest around Kunjamuk cabin , the trees are popping like firecrackers . It ' s 30 degrees below zero , and the bone-stinging cold that cloaks the cabin in a mantle of ice is freezing the sap in the trees . Bang ! And the expanding veins of solidifying sap burst in the trees like rifle_shots . Kablam ! The moon is_full . A pillar of smoke churns its way into the night sky , rising from a woodstove the size of a locomotive . The smoke is a reassuring sight on this frigid night . It means a roaring fire blazes inside the lonely log_cabin here in the middle of the Siamese Ponds Wilderness Area , deep in the Adirondacks of Upstate New York . And without a fire , well , let ' s just say the nine cross-country skiers holed_up inside the cabin would not be happy campers . Kapow ! Here at Kunjamuk , the snow is two feet deep . The cabin is miles away from the nearest road . The scene is set for a Jack London-style battle pitting a small band of adventurers against arctic elements . There ' s no doubt about the outcome , though this is a wilderness adventure all_right -- but one that ' s carefully planned for weekend warrior types . Some of the folks on this two-day cross-country ski trip display the most rudimentary of ski skills ( several need instruction in hill-climbing techniques at the first incline ) , but anyone game enough to contemplate covering about 10 miles a day on skis is welcome on an Adirondack Hut to Hut Tours outing . ( Real beginners may spend their weekend exploring trails nearer the base camp. ) * Make no mistake . These trips are a touch rugged , as anyone who ' s got_to make the 10-yard dash through the snow to the icicle-covered outhouse will tell you . Walter Blank , owner of the ski-touring company , is often the first to warn potential customers away from his hut-to-hut trips . &quot; I don ' t want anybody to think we ' re going from the Ramada Inn to the Holiday Inn across the golf_course , &quot; he says . Any lingering doubts about a lack of luxury are dispelled the morning skiers shove_off from Chimney Mountain Lodge at King ' s Flow near Indian Lake . One of the final preparations for the first day ' s eight-mile ski is making your own lunch . But there are few other chores -- skiers ' gear is shuttled into the cabin via snowmobile . All a skier need haul is something to eat and drink , a camera and perhaps a_few extra layers of clothing . The ski trip begins with a gentle downhill coast to King ' s Flow , now an ice- and snow-covered marsh . Back in the heyday of Adirondack logging , nearly all_the trees in these parts were stripped away by woodcutters . Across the flow , skiers zigzag through a patch of second-growth forest and onto the shores of Round Pond . Spreading_out , the group of nine scuttles across the wind-swept pond and past a series of beaver dams before ducking back into the pines to follow the old Kunjamuk Road , a former stagecoach trail running between Indian Lake and Speculator . During the next two days , they ' ll ski along frozen creeks , across ponds and down barely bushwhacked tracks . The gentle but constant shuffling motion of cross-country_skiing keeps the subzero temperatures at_bay , but whenever there ' s a halt , the cold sneaks into your bones with an icy caress . There ' s a good side to the deepfreeze -- the snow is perfect . And abundant . Skis slip through about a foot of wispy powder that ' s more like smoke than snow . That fresh layer of dust smothers a deep , firm base . This is the place to discover what cross-country_skiing is all about . Those who know the sport only by skidding across a golf_course or circulating through a crowded trail system cannot guess at the exhilarating sense of freedom gained by really going cross-country , over hill and down dale , through forests and across ponds for mile after mile after mile . * None of the terrain is overly taxing . The few steady climbs aren ' t too steep and the downhill runs are gentle and , for the most part , free_of the cross-country skier ' s nemesis -- quick , sharp , do-or-die turns . Even beginning skiers manage to take_on the ups and downs , albeit with falls aplenty . The two guides , Dick Collins and Tom Kligerman , represent opposite poles of the skiing spectrum . Dick , in his homemade down vest and wooden skis , shuffles along with hard-won grace , earned by hundreds , if not thousands , of trail miles . Kligerman , decked_out in head-to-toe Gore-tex and coasting along on metal-edged telemark skis , moves_in state-of-the-art style . The gear their charges use covers the broad range between the two . Deeper in the woods , the knot of skiers spreads_out as the more accomplished ones take the lead with one guide , while the others struggle on with another . Regardless of a skier ' s ability , it ' s hard not to be taken_in by the spell of the winter forest . Pine boughs droop under the weight of snow . Quick gusts of wind sweep the snow from the branches , and the flakes glint like tiny jewels as they drift through beams of sunlight that spear the forest canopy . By late afternoon , the skiers glide toward the cabin . The temperature is dropping . Punching a path through the snow to the nearby woodshed , the skiers form a human chain and pass dozens of logs into the cabin and on into the fiery maw of a just-lit , giant woodstove made from an old water boiler . After darkness falls , there ' s dinner , a hearty meal of salads and spicy burritos . In the icy night , Orion ushers the moon into the sky . The trees start popping . All is cozy in the now-warm cabin . The skis are outside , waiting . Tomorrow , there will be more tracks to make .
