   <HEADLINE> THE BOND MARKET MONSTER ; SOME DEMONIZE IT , BUT IT ' S A CREATURE OF OUR OWN MAKING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; I used to think if there was reincarnation , I wanted to come_back as the President , the Pope , or a . 400 baseball hitter . But now I want to come_back as the bond market . You can intimidate everybody. &quot; -- Presidential adviser James C . Carville , quoted in the book &quot; The Agenda &quot; by Bob Woodward As the governors of the Federal_Reserve_Board voted their sixth official interest_rate increase of 1994 last Tuesday , picketers from organized labor and consumer groups marched in front of the central_bank ' s fortress-like Washington headquarters . &quot; Jobs , Not Rate Hikes , &quot; one placard read . &quot; Greenspan , Have You Ever Been Out of Work ? &quot; asked another . But even within the ranks of Americans who oppose the Fed ' s policy of raising interest_rates to slow the economy , many believe the protesters ' anger is misdirected . Don ' t blame the Fed , they say . Blame the bond market -- that faceless manic multitrillion-dollar monster that swoons at the mere thought of a healthy economy that could bring an uptick in inflation . &quot; Monetary policy in this country is controlled by bond traders who live_in high-rises and are completely out of touch with reality , &quot; argues Jerry Jasinowski , head of the National Assn . of Manufacturers , whose members don ' t want to see growth in a chokehold . By Jasinowski ' s reckoning -- and that of more_than a_few other Fed critics -- the central_bank has felt compelled to punish the economy with ever-higher short-term interest_rates this year mostly to appease a seemingly select group of investors who own bonds . Bond owners , the logic goes , can ' t stand the idea of meaningful economic_growth because they ' re terrified of the possibility of higher inflation , which would erode the value of money they ' ve locked_up in long-term bonds at fixed rates . Yet as Jasinowski and others point_out , the economy has advanced this year without higher inflation . With 1994 almost over , consumer prices are rising at a lower rate even than in 1993 -- an annualized 2.6 % through October , versus 2.7 % last year . Moreover , many experts argue that with bitterly intense competition in the global economy and labor in excess supply worldwide , inflation simply won ' t be a problem in the ' 90s . Someone will always do things cheaper . The bond market , however , is not impressed . Whereas the Fed controls short-term rates , bond investors determine longer-term rates , which are considered much more important to the economy ' s health . And all year long the bond market has pushed long-term yields ever higher . The investors ' message to the Fed , according to those who would demonize the bond market : &quot; Inflation is coming ! Inflation is coming ! Keep tightening credit and stop the economy ! &quot; Investors today are demanding an annualized yield of 8.12 % to take the risk of owning a 30-year U.S. Treasury_bond , a benchmark for long-term rates . Just a year ago , 30-year T-bonds were sold at a yield of 5.8 % , the lowest in 20 years . The surge in bond yields to three-year highs has blasted other long-term interest_rates worldwide higher as well this year , boosting the cost of mortgages and car loans and the price at which many businesses and governments borrow . Indirectly , the stock_market has been affected as well , with bond traders ' counter-intuitive thinking -- that good economic news is a bad omen -- now holding_sway on Wall_Street . But whereas the bond market ' s critics paint it as a towering , malicious monster , some analysts see an entity more akin to a pitiful , helpless giant -- the uncontrollable creation of a decades-long binge of government , corporate and consumer borrowing . It is powerful , dangerous and often irrational , but &quot; this is not some private club , &quot; says James Bianco , a bond historian at Arbor Trading Group in Barrington , Ill . &quot; Think_of who the bond market is , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s pension_funds , 401 ( k ) ( retirement ) accounts , mutual_funds , governments , corporations , individuals . When you add it all up , we ' re all bond holders. &quot; * What ' s more , higher long-term interest_rates appear to have had only a minimal effect so far on the broad economy , which continues to expand and create jobs . But the damage to bond holders themselves has been devastating : Every increase in current bond yields devalues older bonds issued in recent years at lower yields . By Bianco ' s calculations , interest_rates have risen so rapidly over the past 12 months that bond holders have experienced the most severe devaluation of their securities in this century . &quot; The greatest number of victims of higher bond yields have been in the bond market itself , &quot; agrees Bruce Steinberg , economist at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . * The image of the bond market as a bogyman is a relatively new one . In the United States and abroad , bond markets for most of the 20th Century were the staid province of high-quality borrowers , such_as sovereign states and major corporations , and highly conservative investor / creditors , such_as bank trust departments . With the number of players on both sides relatively limited -- as was their ability to trade and track bonds and judge the true extent of inflation -- the movement of long-term interest_rates occurred at a snail ' s pace for decades . Sidney Homer and Richard Sylla , in their book &quot; A History of Interest_Rates , &quot; show that yields on high-quality corporate_bonds took 20 years ( 1900 to 1920 ) to rise from 3.5 % to 5 % and another 20 years ( 1920 to 1940 ) to decline from 5 % to 2.8 % . As recently as the early 1970s , the bond market was a sleepy place essentially run_by arch-conservative Eastern investment_bankers and their equally conservative bank and life_insurance company clients . William Gross , the 50-year-old managing director of Newport Beach-based Pacific Investment Management Co. ' s $ 55-billion bond portfolio , recalls his first job out of college in 1971 at Pacific Mutual Life in downtown Los Angeles . &quot; I had to go_into the vault and clip the coupons on the bonds stored there , &quot; Gross says . Coupons were interest tickets attached_to bonds ; they had to be detached and mailed to the bond issuer twice a year to receive interest owed . &quot; Those bonds weren ' t traded , &quot; Gross says . &quot; They just sat there -- for five , 10 , 15 years or more. &quot; Like so many other aspects of American life , the bond market began to change radically in the mid-1970s , with the Arab oil embargo and soaring energy prices . The generally slow upward creep of inflation and interest_rates began to accelerate . Bond owners , often left_behind the curve by accepting yields that inflation quickly eroded , began to assert their power as creditors . More important , the use of debt began to accelerate as America aged and grew more affluent , the size of federal and local_governments ballooned and corporations changed their attitude about borrowing . At the same time , the appetite for bonds surged on the part of institutional investors , who were flush with pension dollars set_aside for future retirees . By 1981 , with the annual inflation_rate running at 13 % , bond investors were demanding the highest interest_rates in U.S. history -- yields of more_than 14 % on long-term Treasury_bonds , up from 8 % just two years earlier . At that point , the Federal_Reserve , under then-Chairman Paul Volcker , committed itself to breaking the inflation cycle by inducing a severe recession with short-term interest_rates in excess of 20 % . What ' s worth noting is that the bond market wasn ' t blamed for that then-unprecedented rate surge . Inflation was real , and the image of the bond investor was that of victim , not perpetrator . What is so different today , a mere 13 years later , that makes the bond market so hated and feared ? If bigness alone makes something intimidating , the bond market is that in spades . The debt expansion that began in the 1970s has increased exponentially since 1980 : * U.S. government-related debt has exploded from $ 1 trillion outstanding in 1980 to $ 5.3 trillion now , the result of years of record federal budget_deficits . * Outstanding U.S. corporate and foreign bonds have more_than quadrupled since 1980 , from $ 508 billion to $ 2.2 trillion , and municipal_bonds issued now total almost $ 1.3 trillion , up from $ 365 billion . * All told , the value of bond debt has reached $ 8.8 trillion , up 370 % from 1980 . To put that in perspective , consider that the Wilshire market_value index of 5 # 000 U.S. stocks is up only 194 % in the same period , to about $ 4.6 trillion . Not only do investors own more fixed-rate bond assets than ever before , but technology allows them to buy and sell bonds in the blink_of_an_eye , assuring that yields can react instantly to investors ' perceptions of what is a &quot; fair &quot; return . But as mammoth as it is , the bond market from 1981 through 1993 did not use its power to extort ever-rising yields from the world ' s myriad borrowers . On the contrary , what has been forgotten in the angry rhetoric about interest_rates this year is that bond yields have mostly been in decline for the past 13 years . And contrary to what the market ' s detractors allege , many big bond investors say fear of higher inflation in a healthy economy isn ' t the overriding issue driving bond yields this year . Instead , they see in rates ' sudden turnaround the violent backlash to a sea change in the global economy -- a backlash worsened by bond investors ' own gluttony in recent years . Investors had willingly snapped_up bonds at ever-lower yields , often with funds borrowed at even lower short-term rates . They assumed that economic_growth would remain anemic -- and , more important , that the Federal_Reserve would continue to keep short-term interest_rates low . &quot; Too many investors believed the U.S. and other major economies were locked_in a quiet depression , &quot; said John Lonski , economist at Moody ' s Investors Service in New York . &quot; That assumption proved to be disastrously wrong for bond holders. &quot; Now , with the world economy clearly on the upswing again , bond investors have many new considerations in determining a logical &quot; price &quot; for money , said Pacific Investment Management ' s Gross . First and foremost , he notes , as long as demand for credit is rising , its cost can go_up -- hardly_a new concept . And with the global economy now almost entirely capitalist -- for the first time since 1917 -- and recessions in Europe and Japan ending , bond investors have begun to weigh the possibility of a &quot; capital shortage &quot; in the years ahead . Even with low inflation worldwide , Gross said , the price of credit would conceivably have to rise if there were greater global demand for money than investors had ever witnessed . Something else also is at_work in molding bond market psychology today : the simple desire to get_out of the way of bonds ' reversal of fortune and to take_advantage of higher yields on much safer short-term bank CDs and money_market accounts , courtesy of the Fed ' s tighter-credit policy . Indeed , the sudden lack of demand for bonds , as market yields have risen and investors ' holdings have tumbled in value , has been as significant a force in the market as actual selling . As have much smaller investors , Gross and his staff of 14 portfolio managers have become both cause and effect in the 1994 bond bear_market . They have helped cause it by becoming increasingly leery of aggressively investing their clients ' fresh cash_in longer-term bonds as yields have continued to rise . That has forced bond issuers -- such_as Uncle_Sam -- to offer higher yields to attract buyers . At the same time , PIMCO has suffered the effects of rising yields , as its giant portfolio of older government , corporate and other bonds has been devalued . &quot; I ' ve lost $ 5 billion ( on paper ) as bond prices have gone_down this year , &quot; Gross said , not disguising the pain that loss has caused him professionally . With long-term Treasury_bond yields now over 8 % , the &quot; real , &quot; after-inflation yield to investors is more_than 5 % -- an extremely attractive return , if not a record high , Gross contends . But the momentum of markets -- bull or bear -- has a life of its own , he said . After nine months of extraordinary losses , &quot; investors look_at this market and say , ' I ' m not going_to invest in it because it only goes down. ' &quot; Burned badly , the same investors who gorged on bonds in 1993 now shun them . That may make the bond market an angry , vengeful monster to some . And unquestionably , this monster ' s actions have consequences for the economy -- on the upside and on the downside . Worth remembering , though , is that this is a Frankenstein of_our_own creation -- as creditors , as investors , and not least as the most profligate of borrowers . What ' s Fair for Bond Holders ? What are long-term interest_rates supposed to be ? That question is key in judging whether bond investors have pushed yields_up exorbitantly this year , as some economists contend . In theory , bond yields should guarantee investors a fair return above the rate_of_inflation , thereby rewarding them for taking the risk of locking_up their funds for a long_time . But what is &quot; fair &quot; for a bond holder ? Since 1913 , yields on long-term government_bonds ( that is , 20- to 30-year issues ) have averaged 3 percentage_points above the inflation_rate , according to James Bianco at Arbor Trading Group in Barrington , Ill . In other words , if inflation was 1 % , bond yields averaged 4 % . If inflation was 7 % , bond yields averaged 10 % . The after-inflation yield is called the &quot; real &quot; yield . For much of the 1945-to-1981 era , however , inflation accelerated faster than interest_rates . The result was that bond investors ' real returns were continually eroded by inflation . In fact , bonds are said to have been in a bear_market for most of that 36-year period , meaning bond investors generally lost money after inflation . Mainly for that reason , skittish investors have been much warier about accepting lower real yields on bonds in recent years , even as inflation has declined since 1981 . The fear is ever-present that inflation could resurge . Even so , Bianco notes that with 30-year Treasury_bonds yielding 8.12 % currently and inflation around 3 % , the real yield of 5 % or so matches the average real return since 1981 -- so investors really aren ' t demanding much more_than they were getting_in the ' 80s . The Mechanics of a Bond * Why is it that bond owners lose money as market interest_rates rise ? Think_of a seesaw , with a bond ' s price on one end and its yield on the other . The two ends always move_in opposite directions . Take the example of a U.S. Treasury 30-year bond issued in 1993 . An investor who bought_it new paid $ 1 # 000 for a security that will pay 6.25 % interest , or $ 62.50 , annually for the next 30 years . That may have seemed like a decent enough return at the time . But since then , market interest_rates have zoomed . Today , investors are demanding a yield of 8.1 % on new 30-year T-bonds . Owners of the older T-bond still are earning 6.25 % , and if they hold the bond to maturity they ' ll get their full $ 1 # 000 back , as well . But if they try to sell the bond now , buyers naturally will demand that the yield match the market . To accomplish that , the bond ' s price is marked_down . Instead of $ 1 # 000 , the market_price of the bond today is about $ 793 , a 21 % decline from what the original investors paid . Divide annual interest earnings of $ 62.50 by $ 793 and you get a &quot; current &quot; yield of about 7.9 % for a new buyer . And by factoring in the added return expected by reinvesting the bond ' s annual interest earnings , the true yield -- called &quot; yield to maturity &quot; -- works_out to about 8.1 % , thereby matching the market . What happens if market yields begin to decline again ? As the seesaw analogy implies , the bond ' s price will rise accordingly . Price : $ 1 # 000 Yield : 6.25 % Price : $ 782 Yield : 8.1 % An Explosion of Debt The bond market ' s power to drive Wall_Street , mold federal policy and shape the economy has mushroomed over the last 14 years , as bond debt has rocketed worldwide . How key categories of bond debt have grown : Bonds outstanding , in billions of dollars : Category / Debt outstanding : U.S. govt.-related : 1980 : $ 1 # 016 1994 : $ 5 # 340 Corporate and foreign : 1980 : $ 508 1994 : $ 2 # 228 Municipal : 1980 : $ 365 1994 : $ 1 # 270 How Interest_Rates Have Turned Bond yields have jumped this year as the Federal_Reserve_Board has tightened credit adn the economy has surged , fueling inflation worries . While yields are still far below historical peaks , the magnitude of the rise in rates over the past year has been more dramatic than at any time sine the 1920s . 30-year U.S. Treasury_bond , average yield each year ( except latest ) : 1977 : 7.9 % 1981 : 13.5 % 1994 : 8.1 % Source : Bloomberg Business News Worst Bear_Markets Because a bond pays a fixed yield , rising yields on newly issued bonds automatically devalue older bonds , pushing their prices down . Over the past year , prices have fallen so far that bondholders ' total return -- interest payments less price decline -- has been negative . 12 months ended / Long-term T-Bond total return : Oct . 1994 : -17.5 % March , 1980 : -17.1 % Sept. , 1969 : -12.5 % June , 1981 : -12.3 % April , 1959 : -9.8 % Source : Arbor Trading Group</TEXT>
