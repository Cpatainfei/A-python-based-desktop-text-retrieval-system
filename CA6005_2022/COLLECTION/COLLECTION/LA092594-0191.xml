   <HEADLINE> MUTUAL_FUNDS / RUSS WILES : GLOBAL MANAGERS OFTEN STICK CLOSE TO HOME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jean-Marie Eveillard is a respected global-investment manager who runs the highly regarded , $ 1.9-billion SoGen International Fund . You probably figure he spends most of his time shuttling around the world in search of the next hot_stock . But in fact , he works in New York and rarely leaves the country . &quot; I ' m on_the_road maybe once a year , &quot; says Eveillard , a native of western France . &quot; I might go somewhere for a_couple_of days and visit a_few companies . that ' s about it. &quot; Managing an international fund from a base in the United States may seem as odd as running a farm from a high-rise on Wilshire Boulevard . But it ' s more common than you might think . And the manager ' s location doesn ' t affect the overall performance of foreign funds all that much . &quot; I ' ve never seen any evidence one way or another , &quot; says Anthony Cragg , a London native who manages the Strong International Stock and Strong Asia Pacific Funds from the unlikely locale of suburban Milwaukee . Although there are obvious advantages to being close to a foreign market ' s pulse , there are also drawbacks , one of which is the danger of getting swept_up in the local herd mentality . Japanese investment managers , for example , have a reputation for mistiming their own market , lunging after stocks near market peaks and selling en masse near troughs . &quot; Foreigners have consistently done better in that market than the Japanese , &quot; says Cragg , who worked in Asia for nine years , then in London for seven before joining Strong in 1993 . Eveillard tells of some New Zealand brokers who recommended that he not buy New Zealand bonds back in the mid-1980s , even though they were yielding more_than 20 % at the time . &quot; The bond market there had been so bad for so_long that the locals were discouraged , &quot; says Eveillard , who made the investment anyway , and turned a big profit . &quot; As outsiders , we could take a fresh look. &quot; Another drawback to maintaining an office abroad is that you can only be in one place at a time anyway . Thus , there ' s no particular advantage to being headquartered in Europe , for example , if you ' re also buying Asian and Latin_American stocks for your portfolio . &quot; When you ' re based in the U.S. , you can be much more objective on all_the international areas , even if you are probably a bit biased in favor of the U.S. , &quot; says David Peebles , manager of the USAA Investment International Fund . He has outperformed the average international fund in each of the last four calendar_years from his base in San Antonio . And thanks to innovations in communications , it ' s a lot easier to keep_abreast of foreign companies and markets than it was even a decade ago . The world has changed a lot since the early 1960s , when Eveillard , as a young stock analyst , used to dart around the streets of Paris on a motor_scooter , attending shareholder meetings and gathering annual reports in_person as one of the few ways to pry information out of the tight-lipped French corporations of that era . This isn ' t to say that some international fund managers don ' t spend most of their time far from American soil . The ultimate globe-trotter in the fund business is Mark Mobius , an emerging-markets specialist for the Franklin / Templeton Group . Living_in East Asia since 1965 , Mobius estimates he travels about 100 # 000 miles a year on business . He maintains two offices -- one in Hong Kong and one in Singapore -- and speaks &quot; bits and pieces &quot; of six foreign tongues . Mobius says his grass-roots research efforts depend_on extensive travel . International fund managers who don ' t have Mobius ' tolerance for airline food and hotel_rooms tend to rely_on analysts to do a lot of tire kicking on location . Eveillard , for example , works with three analysts , and Peebles with two . Analysts at both companies spend more time abroad than do the two managers . Cragg , however , spends six to seven weeks a year traveling . Fund managers also purchase research from brokerages specializing in various foreign markets , often paying_for this service by throwing commission business their way . In the final analysis , manager location doesn ' t seem to be a critical factor_in predicting the success of an international fund . But it may be more important for certain types of funds , such_as those run_by value managers focusing_on smaller foreign stocks and emerging markets that aren ' t being closely picked_over . &quot; If you ' re doing a lot of original research , it clearly helps to have people based around the world , &quot; says George Murnaghan , a spokesman for the T . Rowe Price fund group in Baltimore . &quot; But location isn ' t as important as other factors , such_as the approach , style and experience of the people running a fund. &quot; * A former portfolio manager for GT Global in San Francisco has unveiled one of the first mutual_funds to invest in Asian convertible_bonds . The new Matthews Asian Convertible_Securities Fund is the brainchild of Paul Matthews , former manager of GT Pacific Growth , and Carol Chuang , a Singapore native who has worked for several investment_firms in East Asia . The no-load fund ( 800-789-ASIA ) requires a $ 25 # 000 minimum investment and is headquartered in San Francisco . Convertibles are bonds that can be exchanged into stock assuming the underlying shares perform well . Small World Most international mutual_funds actually are run from offices in the United States by American-born managers . But some high profile portfolios , such_as the ones listed below , either have foreign managers or are headquartered overseas : * T . Rowe Price International ( $ 6 billion in assets ) : Lead manager Martin Wade , an Englishman , works in London . * Harbor International ( $ 3 billion ) : Swede Hakan Castegren manages the fund from Bermuda . * Fidelity Emerging Markets ( $ 2.2 billion ) : Englishman Richard Hazelwood runs the fund from Boston * Templeton Developing Markets ( $ 2.1 billion ) : New York-born portfolio manager Mark Mobius runs the fund from Hong Kong and Singapore . * SoGen International ( $ 1.9 billion ) : Manager Jean-Marie Eveillard , a native of France , is based in New York . * Montgomery Emerging Markets ( $ 930 million ) : Co-manager Josephine Jimenez of the Philippines works_out of San Francisco . * Fidelity Southeast_Asia ( $ 860 million ) : Allan Liu , a native of Macao , is headquartered in Hong Kong . * Merrill Lynch Developing Capital Markets ( $ 430 million ) : Grace Pineda of the Philippines oversees the fund from Princeton , N.J .</TEXT>
