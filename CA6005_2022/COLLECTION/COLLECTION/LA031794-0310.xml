   <HEADLINE> GORE TO CALL FOR GLOBAL INFORMATION AGE ; TELECOMMUNICATIONS : AT CONFERENCE , VICE_PRESIDENT WILL URGE FUNDING TO HELP DEVELOPING NATIONS BRIDGE ECONOMIC GAP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At a key gathering the Clinton_Administration is comparing to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro , Vice_President Al Gore will urge world leaders meeting in Argentina on Monday to develop a global information superhighway as a way to promote economic development . At stake is the global agenda for telecommunications development for the next generation . At a time when the burgeoning telecommunications industry is expanding to serve consumers with groundbreaking new technologies such_as high-definition television and wireless telecommunications , Gore and other top officials say they will call_for a redeployment of international funding to close the technological gulf between industrialized and developing nations . &quot; There are more telephones in Tokyo than there are in all_of Africa , &quot; said Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed Hundt , who is accompanying Gore . &quot; Africa ' s inability to grow economically is directly related to its lack of a telecommunications infrastructure. &quot; Gore , who will address officials from more_than 100 nations at the World Telecommunications Development Conference of the International Telecommunications Union in Buenos Aires , would be the highest-ranking U.S. official ever to attend the quadrennial meeting of the ITU , which is the world ' s oldest international body . Gore ' s appearance at the conference is viewed by many observers as lending new prestige and urgency to this movement that languished during the George_Bush Administration , which did not favor redeploying international funding for building communications networks in developing countries . For decades , major international lending groups such_as the World_Bank and the International Monetary Fund have concentrated_on helping nations finance crops , dams , roads and other basic needs . World_Bank officials have said they are interested in funding more telecommunications development but must first develop the expertise to evaluate proposals . The ITU , which sets international telecommunications policy -- including use of the radio_spectrum -- has no direct control over spending by its members , but its recommendations are influential . What ' s more , it could encourage members to reduce regulatory barriers in_order to attract telecommunications investment . Gore and Hundt argue that telecommunications development would promote political stability as well as help U.S. companies cash_in_on the more_than $ 250 billion worth of telecommunications modernization that the Center for Strategic and International Studies estimates will be undertaken in the next decade in China , the former Soviet_Union and developing nations . &quot; The development of a global information highway is critical to furthering education and economic development &quot; around the world , said Gregory Simon , Gore ' s domestic policy adviser . An interactive global information superhighway is a &quot; top priority , &quot; he said . In some ways , building an info highway in developing nations may be easier than in countries that already have communications networks . It is cheaper , for example , to install high-capacity fiber-optic cable than to replace ordinary copper wire , Hundt noted . What ' s more , wireless phone_service is spreading in developing nations because of pent-up demand . In Poland , for example , more_than 2.3 million people are waiting to get telephone_service , up from 1 million in 1981 , according to the Office of Technology Assessment . &quot; I think Gore ' s appearance will be tremendously well-received by developing nations , &quot; said Michael R . Gardner , a Washington lawyer who heads an industry- and government-funded program to train people from developing nations to provide communications services . &quot; It ' s time to shift gears and stop paving highways to tourist towns in developing countries that have nobody there because there ' s no fax machine to take reservations , &quot; he said . Still , Gardner said , an emphasis on telecommunications development may face some resistance from countries concerned about outside political and cultural interference . France , for instance , has proposed barring foreign words from virtually all business and government communications . Similarly , Saudi_Arabia has banned satellite dishes_out of fear that foreign television_programs may disturb the Saudi social order . And scores of countries have local-content rules that limit the amount of programming that radio_stations and other broadcasting outlets may import from overseas .</TEXT>
