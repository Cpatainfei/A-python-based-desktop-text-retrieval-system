   <HEADLINE> CRUISE VIEWS : ROYAL VIKING TO UNDERGO SEA CHANGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the saying goes , there ' s good news and bad news . The good news is we came_back recently from the most wonderful cruise we ' ve taken_in years , perhaps the best ever , a 14-day culinary extravaganza produced in cooperation with the Le Cordon_Bleu cooking school in Paris aboard the 200-passenger Royal Viking Queen . It was a perfect coalescence of interesting itinerary , outstanding cuisine , top-of-the-line service and a beautiful ship . In the two years since we were aboard its inaugural sailing , the Royal Viking Queen has developed_into one of the finest three or four ships afloat . The bad news is , we arrived in London to learn that at the end of this year the ship will cease operations under Royal Viking , leaving only a_few more months remaining to enjoy what turned_into the quintessential Royal Viking experience . We sailed from Lisbon along the coast and rivers of France to London , pausing in Bordeaux . For the last three days of the voyage , we sailed along the Thames into London to anchor alongside the Tower Bridge for the celebration of its 100th birthday . But during our blissful days at_sea , other negotiations were going_on back in the Coral Gables , Fla. , office of RVL and its parent company Kloster Cruise Ltd . that would determine the future for both the Queen and the line ' s 758-passenger flagship , Royal Viking Sun . It ' s been an open_secret for months that the two-ship Royal Viking Line was up for_sale . Effective last June 30 , Kloster sold the Royal Viking Sun to Cunard Line Ltd. , along with the Royal Viking brand name and other company trademarks , for $ 170 million , plus potential payouts of another $ 5 million based on the ship ' s future performance . The Royal Viking Queen , not included in the Cunard transaction , will sail on its scheduled itineraries with its present crew in place for the remainder of 1994 . It will then be transferred to Kloster ' s Royal Cruise Line to become the Queen Odyssey on Jan . 1 . According to Adam Aron , president of both Royal Cruise Line and Norwegian Cruise Line , the two remaining cruise divisions of Kloster , the fare for the Queen Odyssey &quot; will be roughly half of what it was_on the Royal Viking Queen. &quot; ( Based on published brochure prices on our cruise , the new fare would be around $ 440 a day per person , double occupancy. ) In acquiring the flagship and the brand name , Cunard is in_effect the new owner of Royal Viking Line . Cunard ' s senior_vice_president of marketing Navin Sawhney says that Cunard Royal Viking will market the Royal Viking Sun , Sagafjord , Vistafjord and the two new Sea Goddess ships as an ultra-luxury brand name . While Cunard and Royal Cruise Line are good companies in their own_right , they ' ll have to work hard to maintain the exemplary standards set by Royal Viking Line during its 22 years at_sea . In its best days , it was something to aspire to , and even in its second-best days , it was far better than most . Meanwhile , Cunard ' s Sawhney says his line has no plans to change anything on the Sun , including its name . &quot; The itineraries that we will operate in 1995 are as they are published in the RVL brochure . &quot; The next Le Cordon_Bleu cruise scheduled is a November segment of the 50-day Southern Cross itinerary aboard the Royal Viking Sun , leaving San Francisco Nov . 2 and Los Angeles Nov . 3 . For more information , contact a travel_agent or call Royal Viking Line ( through Sept . 30 ) at ( 800 ) 422-8000 or Cunard at ( 800 ) 221-4770 . Slater and Basch travel as guests of the cruise lines . Cruise Views appears the first and third week of every month .</TEXT>
