   <HEADLINE> AMERICA ' S PROFESSOR OF PEACE ; IDEALISM : ATTEMPTS TO FIGHT VIOLENCE WITH VIOLENCE HAVE FAILED , SAYS A COLUMNIST AND TEACHER . HIS SUGGESTION ? TEACH KIDS TO SOLVE LITTLE ARGUMENTS BEFORE THEY BECOME BIG FIGHTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was a grand day for the peaceniks when &quot; Mad Dog &quot; Colman McCarthy hit town . First , a Sunday morning stop at radio_station KPFK in the Valley , where McCarthy ( dubbed a &quot; mad-dog liberal &quot; by the National Review ) told listeners that &quot; Clinton , ( Dick ) Cheney and the chairman of Northrop &quot; are the real &quot; warlords &quot; of the world , not the little &quot; oddball rulers &quot; who use weapons that the United States &quot; so graciously &quot; provides_for them . Then , a trip downtown to Immaculate Heart College Center , where McCarthy ( also known as &quot; the liberal conscience &quot; of the Washington Post , for which he writes two columns a week ) talked to a group that included everything from scientists , psychologists and teachers to firefighters and carpenters -- all eager to hear his views about teaching peace to children . &quot; Someone is finally doing something about this violent society we live_in , &quot; Lori Klaidman said after hearing McCarthy talk . Klaidman , 32 , a brain research scientist at USC , said she might try to follow McCarthy ' s path and start a peace course at her local elementary_school . The next morning , McCarthy led two assemblies at Polytechnic School in Pasadena , where some of the city ' s best and brightest students received his pacifist word . &quot; I ' d heard things like this before , but only in_relation_to religion , &quot; said Tia Roosendahl , 17 , a senior . &quot; We were taught to love one another , to have peace in relationships and to follow Jesus at the Christian elementary_school I attended . But I never thought it applied to everyday life . I ' m impressed that ( McCarthy ) has thought it all out and written it down. &quot; Laura Layton Pendorf , a Polytechnic Spanish teacher , also heard McCarthy and was one of &quot; quite a_few teachers here who asked to start a peace studies course at the school . That would be a lot more interesting than the pluperfect subjunctive , &quot; she chuckled . Next , McCarthy made his way ( at his usual freeway speed of 45 m.p.h. ) to Claremont McKenna College , where about 120 students and faculty heard his theories . &quot; People were moved by him ; some got fired_up about starting to teach his courses in nonviolent resolution of conflict , &quot; said Bonnie Snortum , director of the school ' s Marian Miner Cook Athenaeum . &quot; Many students had never been exposed to ideas like his before. &quot; * At first it sounds absurd : a man who teaches peace . Computer skills , yes ; parenting , maybe ; dead languages like Latin , marginal . But peace ? How would you teach it -- and why ? Colman McCarthy finds it odd that anyone would ask . It ' s obvious to him that seeking peace through violence hasn ' t worked . In his 54 years , he has seen too many conflicts erupt around the world -- always followed by an increase in armaments and threats to use them . He has watched the number of prisons soar , never enough for the prisoners destined to live_in them . He has seen families erode , youth_gangs explode , drugs and violence invade our cities and countryside . He is a peaceful man , not a stupid one . If fighting violence with violence worked , he says , the results would by now be obvious to everyone , and even he could not dispute them . He ' s packed with statistics to support his point : &quot; Nearly 80 million have been killed in wars in the last 100 years ; about 40 # 000 are killed per month right now in wars everywhere ; more_than 10 # 000 Americans are killed in handgun homicides every year . Carjackings , rapes , follow-home robberies . We are afraid to walk the streets for fear of being hurt. &quot; Add to that , he says , the very personal atrocities that occur within the home -- spousal abuse , child_abuse , all sorts of family quarrels that end in harm . &quot; Aren ' t we tired_of it all ? &quot; he asks . And isn ' t peace -- defined by Webster ' s as an absence of war , freedom from public disorder , and an undisturbed state_of_mind -- the thing we all want most in our lives ? If so , he has some answers . Let ' s teach children , starting in the first_grade , the theory and meaning of peace , and how to achieve it by resolving conflicts nonviolently . Give them the tools to solve small arguments before they become big fights , McCarthy says . Let them grow_up using this knowledge , so that they will become peace-loving , peace-making adults . We are a nation of peace illiterates , he says . &quot; We would n ' t ever put kids through 12 years of elementary and high_school with no reading or math . They get math every day ; how many will use it ? How often do you have lively discussions of algebra in your home ? &quot; But children learn nothing in 12 years about how to solve conflicts or make_peace with family and friends , he says . Every child experiences these conflicts , which can be hugely healthy , he adds . &quot; Conflict is simply a signal that we ' ve got_to change the way we operate , or something worse may erupt in the relationship . We can achieve that change by violent or nonviolent means. &quot; McCarthy says if enough children are taught to solve problems without hurting others , the world will eventually become a peaceful place . Children need inspiration as well as technique , he adds . &quot; They know all about the generals , like U.S. Grant and Robert E . Lee , &quot; he says , &quot; but ask them about great ( humanitarians ) like ( Albert ) Schweitzer or ( Jane ) Addams , and they draw_a_blank . . . . There are hundreds of peace-oriented authors out there to read , but the kids never hear about them at school. &quot; * Even those who label him a leftover-leftist-flower-child acknowledge his sincerity . &quot; McCarthy represents the pacifist Catholic tradition . He ' s one of a kind and authentic . We can ' t find anybody like him to replace him , &quot; says Patrick Buchanan , the conservative columnist and co-host of TV ' s &quot; Crossfire. &quot; &quot; He ' s a likable guy , &quot; Buchanan adds , &quot; but I think his views are heretical . Even the Pope now says people have an obligation to use force if necessary to stop what ' s happening in Bosnia . The idea of personal pacifism is fine , but you can ' t even do that when you have a moral_obligation to protect your family . I think he missed his third-grade class on original_sin , ( where they taught ) that some people really are violent , dangerous or wicked -- and you have an obligation to defend yourself with force , if necessary. &quot; Buchanan says McCarthy , a frequent guest on his TV_show , practices &quot; a doctrine of freeloading . The U.S. is protected by people who risk their lives so that Colman can stand_in a classroom and say they are doing unjust and immoral things . It ' s because ( the military ) and the police are willing to defend us on a daily basis that Colman is free to stand_up and preach the beauties of pacifism. &quot; McCarthy chuckles at such detractors ; intellectual battles don ' t trouble him at all . Judging from mail and phone_calls he receives after every public appearance , he says , more Americans are willing to try a loving , nonviolent approach . Of course , they ' re not yet pounding down the doors to join his crusade . So McCarthy treads his Gandhian path alone . The quick trip to Los Angeles last week was part of his usual pattern , sowing insights like apple seeds . At home outside Washington , he describes life as solitary , except for his wife of 27 years and three sons . He ' s up before dawn five days a week to teach a 7:15 a.m. peace studies class at Bethesda-Chevy Chase High_School . Then he bikes to the office , where he writes the peace-pushing columns that are syndicated in about 50 papers ( including The Times ) . Then to the Center for Teaching Peace , a nonprofit educational_institution he started seven years ago to teach children nonviolent methods of resolving conflicts , while disseminating the literature and theory of peace . ( He has raised about $ 600 # 000 for his center in the past five years , $ 300 # 000 in a grant from Bill Moyers . Part of that money is used to teach teachers how to teach peace , a subject he hopes will eventually be taught in all_the nation ' s elementary and secondary schools. ) Then to Georgetown University School_of_Law , or the University of Maryland , where he teaches would-be lawyers a 14-week course he created , called &quot; Law , Conscience and Non-Violence. &quot; * McCarthy can ' t pinpoint the origins of his pacifism . His parents were devout Catholics ; his father a lawyer &quot; who didn ' t really care about making money &quot; and used to offer free legal services to all_the poor people in their Long_Island neighborhood . He recalls being disturbed that the college he attended ( Spring Hill in Mobile , Ala. ) had an ROTC program . &quot; It struck me then , and still does now , that the military really has no place on campus . A college ought to be a place where we learn to solve disputes through the force of ideas , the force of truth and justice -- rather than through violence and killing . I was radicalized by that. &quot; He was not the ideal student , he says . &quot; I was a pretty wild kid in school , so afterward I decided I needed discipline . I wanted to read all_the books I should have read in school and didn ' t. &quot; He entered a Trappist monastery -- &quot; a very strict , austere order &quot; -- for what he thought would be a_few weeks . He stayed five years , he says , making friends with the cows who were in his charge , and the only ones to whom he was allowed to talk . Looking_back , those were the most important years of his life , he says . &quot; It ' s therapeutic to have a period in your life of contemplation , of strenuous physical_exercise and of opening your soul to spiritual concerns . It has been a wonderful resource for me and helped me to love my family tremendously. &quot; It also helped him to love the cows and other living_things . &quot; I came_to realize just how sweet and gentle those animals really are , to understand why the Hindus consider them sacred , &quot; he said . &quot; As soon as their milk would taper_off , they ' d be shipped somewhere &quot; to a fate he didn ' t want to even imagine . McCarthy ' s audiences are startled sometimes when he suddenly shifts gears from peace mongering to the evils of eating meat . It ' s part of this whole nonviolence thing , he says . &quot; I tell my students not to eat anything that had a mother. &quot; Seven Ways to Resolve Conflicts Without Violence 1 . Define what the conflict is about . Studies on spousal disputes show that about 75 % of the time , the partners are fighting about different issues . It was something the wife said or did this morning that has the husband enraged , and something the husband did six weeks ago that has the wife losing_it . 2 . It ' s not you vs . me . It ' s you and me vs . the problem . The problem is the problem . It ' s stupid to try to defeat the other side , because the first thing the other side thinks after losing is , I need a rematch : I ' ll come_back with more firepower . We have a world of rematches of rematches of rematches . Don ' t bring your adversaries to their knees , bring them to the table . 3 . Before a conflict heats_up , list your shared concerns against your one shared separation . Deal with the conflict from where the relationship is strongest , not weakest . 4 . Never ask people who have been in a fight what happened . They ' ll only give you their version of what occurred . Instead ask , &quot; What did you do. &quot; Then you have facts , not opinions . Facts help clarify perceptions , which is basic to conflict resolution . 5 . Develop a sense of forgiveness . Reconciliation is impossible without it . Many people are willing to bury the hatchet , but they insist on remembering exactly where they buried it -- in case they need it for the next war . 6 . Learn to listen actively . Turn it around , from &quot; when I talk , people listen , &quot; to &quot; when I listen , people talk. &quot; 7 . Purify your heart . You can ' t get violence out of other people without first getting_it out of_your_own soul . We can ' t eliminate the weapons of the world without first getting them out of_our_own hearts .</TEXT>
