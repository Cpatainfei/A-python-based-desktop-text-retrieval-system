   <HEADLINE> FRENCH ARCHITECT WINS PRITZKER PRIZE ; AWARDS : CHRISTIAN DE PORTZAMPARC , 49 , IS PRAISED FOR HIS ORIGINALITY AND POETIC USE OF SPACE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> French architect Christian de Portzamparc , a champion of architecture ' s life-enhancing potential whose adventurous Parisian buildings include a music_school , an apartment complex , a cafe and a sculpture museum , has won the 1994 Pritzker Architecture Prize . Cited as &quot; a high-wire artist with sure and confident footwork &quot; who has drawn_on French tradition and the work of pioneering modernist Le Corbusier to develop his own exuberant vocabulary , Portzamparc is the first French architect to win the Pritzker . The annual award , known as the Nobel of architecture , was established in 1979 by the Hyatt Foundation to honor living architects and stimulate creativity in the field . Laureates receive a $ 100 # 000 grant along with a formal citation and a bronze medal . In announcing the award , J . Carter Brown , former director of the National Gallery of Art in Washington and chair of the Pritzker Prize jury , praised Portzamparc ' s originality , poetic use of space and sensitivity to the users and function of his buildings . &quot; He has all_the things you want without being formulaic or occupying some architectural pigeonhole , &quot; Brown said . But Portzamparc was &quot; a high-risk choice , &quot; according to Los Angeles-based architect Frank O . Gehry , who won the Pritzker in 1989 and served on this year ' s jury . At 49 , Portzamparc is a young laureate whose idiosyncratic work with opaque white forms contradicts France ' s prevailing taste for glass buildings , Gehry said . &quot; We had heated discussions , but we were all interested in finding a person who had a strong trajectory . . . . He has a force vector going and you can see its evolution. &quot; Reached by telephone at his office in Paris , Portzamparc said the prize is &quot; a great honor , &quot; which he didn ' t expect to receive so early in his career . He attributed his relatively youthful success to changes in French law , about 15 years ago , that have promoted architectural competitions for public buildings and have put mayors in_charge of building_permits -- giving young architects a fair shot at major commissions while making mayors accountable for buildings erected during their tenures . * Portzamparc ' s best-known project is the City of Music , a complex for music and dance instruction , research , practice and performance in Parc de la Villette , one of French President Francois Mitterrand ' s &quot; Grand Projects &quot; in Paris . &quot; I tried to make separate spaces with open circulation that are open_to the eye but also to the ear , &quot; he said of the project . &quot; Many different kinds of music are played there . Each group is like a family that needs its own place , but the families also need to live happily together. &quot; Among Portzamparc ' s other buildings in Paris are the Erik Satie Conservatory of Music and Elderly Housing , Cafe Beaubourg , a popular eatery overlooking the Centre Georges Pompidou and the Bourdelle Museum , a museum built around French sculptor Antoine Bourdelle ' s studio . Elsewhere in France , he has designed a residential dance_school in Nanterre , an urban development and landmark water_tower in Marne-la-Valee , and a high-rise building that will bridge a railway_station in Lille . Portzamparc also has designed an apartment complex in an experimental housing district in Fukuoka , Japan . The award will be presented on June 14 in Columbus , Ind. , at the Commons , a town square designed by Cesar Pelli , a former Pritzker Prize juror .</TEXT>
