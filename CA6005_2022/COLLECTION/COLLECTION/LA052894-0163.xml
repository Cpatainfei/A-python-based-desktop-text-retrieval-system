   <HEADLINE> CHINA SEES BOOST FOR TRADE IN U.S. MOVE ; REACTION : BEIJING EXPRESSES RESTRAINED SATISFACTION AT CLINTON ' S DECISION . OTHER ASIAN LEADERS ALSO WELCOME POLICY SHIFT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chinese officials reacted with restrained satisfaction Friday to President Clinton ' s announcement that the United States will renew its favorable trade terms with China -- and , more important , &quot; de-link &quot; trade from human_rights issues . &quot; This decision will create favorable conditions for the further strengthening and expansion of trade and economic cooperation between the two sides , &quot; government spokesman Wu Jianmin announced at a news_conference . &quot; The Chinese government and people welcome this decision of President Clinton. &quot; China had sought the removal of human_rights conditions during a year of hard lobbying and diplomatic efforts . On Thursday , a subdued Clinton granted the Chinese precisely what they wanted : the restoration of most-favored-nation trade status and the reversal of a U.S. policy linking MFN to human_rights -- a policy that has haunted Sino-American relations for the last five years . But the Chinese held_back from overt celebration over the diplomatic victory because Clinton also ordered a ban on the $ 100-million-a-year import of weapons and ammunition , and kept_in effect some sanctions established by the George_Bush Administration after the army crackdown on protesters in Tian An Men Square in 1989 . In what amounted to the only joke of the day , spokesman Wu said he heard about Clinton ' s decision by listening to the Voice of America . One of the conditions set by the Clinton_Administration was that the Chinese stop jamming VOA broadcasts . In Hong Kong , Shanghai and Beijing , American residents and business people , many of whom fought strenuously for renewal of MFN , lauded Clinton ' s decision . &quot; Overall , I think we can say we won , &quot; Frank Martin , the president of the U.S. Chamber_of_Commerce in Hong Kong , told the Associated Press . Phil Carmichael , president of the American Chamber_of_Commerce in Beijing , said at a news_conference that he was relieved that he would now have more time to spend on his business . &quot; It means I won ' t have to spend one-third to one-half of my time each year trying to get MFN renewed , &quot; he said . Other Asian governments also welcomed Clinton ' s action . &quot; From the start , we had maintained that there should be no connection between trade and human_rights issues , &quot; Malaysia ' s deputy prime_minister , Anwar Ibrahim , said Friday . Japanese Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata said renewal of China ' s trading benefits is very important for the economic development of the Asia-Pacific region . Some observers said Clinton ' s about-face could have a severe impact on U.S. prestige . &quot; You could call it the Clinton_Administration ' s declaration of defeat , &quot; Koji Igarashi , Washington correspondent for the influential Asahi newspaper , wrote in its evening edition Friday . &quot; It is a 180-degree change in direction from policy up until now and leaves the strong impression that ( Clinton ) gave_in completely to China ' s demands. &quot; In Washington , however , White_House officials made an apparent effort to show how hard Clinton worked to try to achieve human_rights progress in China . The officials disclosed that a Cabinet-level meeting in April led to a plan to send Michael H . Armacost , former U.S. ambassador to Japan , to China as a private emissary . At the time of President Richard Nixon ' s funeral in Yorba Linda in April , three top Administration officials met with Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua in a private room of the Nixon Library to tell of him of the emissary ' s plan to visit . &quot; Clearly , the feeling was that an additional channel was needed , &quot; one senior Administration official said Friday . Times staff writer Jim Mann in Washington contributed to this report .</TEXT>
