   <HEADLINE> TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS / JOSE DE LA TORRE : MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES WILL NEED TRANS-NATIONAL MANAGERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The globalization fad that is rapidly spreading among U.S. corporations has important implications for the skills required of future managers . Long gone are the days when companies sent a small force of expatriates to the far-flung posts of the corporate empire . These &quot; foreign service &quot; executives , bribed to serve most of their careers overseas by large bonuses and perks , were seldom integrated into the company ' s main business at_home and often were forgotten . Next came the multinational structures that consisted essentially of cloning domestic business_activities in other countries . Cost pressures and the need to be &quot; politically sensitive &quot; argued for replacing expatriate managers with local nationals . Today , we see more and more companies giving_up regional or geographic structures and shifting decision-making authority to &quot; global &quot; product divisions . For example : * Ford is merging its North_American and European operations ( Latin_America and Asia will follow soon ) into five worldwide program centers responsible_for all future product development efforts . * IBM ' s new structure moves away from its old geographic organization by setting_up 14 worldwide sales and marketing groups focused_on specific industrial sectors -- a move that recognizes the importance of being more responsive to groups of customers with similar needs , whatever their location . * Similar stories can be told about European and Japanese multinationals . Faced with the need to coordinate an increasingly complex set of activities , companies as different as Philips , ABB , Honda and Mitsubishi Electric either have broken operations into small units with global responsibilities or set_up new coordinating mechanisms requiring multicultural , multinational task_forces . Different industries and company cultures require tailored approaches to the eternal dilemma of how best to balance global demands with local requirements . But one thing is common to all_of these organizations : Cross-national teams are thrust together at all levels . They must sort_out how best to serve a multinational client operating in five continents , make decisions as_to when and where to add or remove capacity , design new products for global customers , transfer best practice from around the world and so on . What sort of managerial skills does life in these global organizations require ? No one denies that technical and professional competence will continue to be requisite skills to succeed in today ' s competitive business world . But they are no longer enough . The managers best suited to function in the new global economy at Apple or 3M -- or for that matter at Compaq or Disney -- also will need a better understanding of the global business environment , a great_deal of cultural sensitivity and a set of language and communication skills adapted to operating in such cross-cultural teams . Colleges and universities must do their part in emphasizing international content in their programs and in requiring such activities as foreign internships and language training . But the critical burden is_on the corporation to provide opportunities for international careers that will enhance the acquisition of these skills by their executives . A telling trend is the increasing reliance on foreign-born CEOs by such leading U.S. corporations as Coke , 3M , Salomon Bros. , Citibank , Ford , Apple , Intel and Compaq . To the extent that the way to the top calls_for an international background or experience -- and that systems are put_in place to provide it to young executives -- there will be little need to bribe them to go abroad . Self interest will prevail . There is no substitute for such firsthand exposure to the complexities of world markets . Having served in the trenches , the executive returns with a greater understanding of conditions overseas and more realistic expectations . The same applies to the benefits of rotating key potential managers from abroad through domestic operations . In 1989 , Coca Cola proudly assigned one of its toughest and most successful U.S. managers to France to deal with its newly acquired distribution system . He spoke no French , had never visited France and took_pride in the fact that he would &quot; Americanize &quot; the_French market . Eighteen months later , he was reassigned home . It was not that his ideas were wrong or badly implemented , but that his lack of cultural awareness got_in the way of his effectiveness . Contrast that story with Squibb ' s decision to hire the head of the Chinese language department at Cornell University to head its new subsidiary in Shanghai . Although ignorant of the technical aspects of the business , he was supported by an excellent U.S. staff , and his language and cultural skills allowed him to surround himself with the best local managers , whether they spoke English or not . The global organization of tomorrow will need a strong group of senior executives who can operate in a complex and multicultural world . This calls_for a new generation of trans patriates -- not ex patriates -- who have served in various countries early in their careers , acquired experience in multicultural teams and have an open and curious attitude toward other peoples and cultures . The time to begin developing these skills is now .</TEXT>
