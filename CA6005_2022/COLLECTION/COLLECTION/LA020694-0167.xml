   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY VOICES ; COMMENTARY ON EL TORO ; LET IRVINE CO . SWAP FARMLAND FOR BASE , THEN WISELY DEVELOP IT ; NOW THAT AN AGENCY HAS BEEN FORMED , IT ' S TIME TO FORMALLY KILL THE AIRPORT OPTION AND EXAMINE CREATIVE SOLUTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It wasn ' t easy , it wasn ' t pretty , and too_much valuable time was lost . But the Orange County Board of Supervisors deserves credit for finally putting_together a new government authority to oversee the conversion of the Marine Corps Air_Station at El Toro . Now the supervisors have an opportunity to get beyond the arguments about who decides ; they can help us all to focus_on what we ' ll decide . First , however , these veteran politicians are going_to have to publicly acknowledge what they privately know to be true : As long as the proposal to convert the military base at El Toro into a commercial airport is the only plan we talk_about , it will be impossible to develop a countywide consensus for the conversion and redevelopment of El Toro . that ' s because residents in southern and central Orange County understand that tens of thousands of commercial aircraft overflights every year will destroy their peace , quiet , property values and quality_of_life . But it ' s not enough to simply state that a commercial airport at El Toro is a bad idea . It ' s time to start exploring some good alternative ideas . I think I ' ve got one -- a new proposal that ' s worth putting_on the table . Here ' s my idea : The 4 # 700-acre Marine Corps Air_Station at El Toro is , of course , owned by the federal_government . It is surrounded by thousands of acres of highly productive agricultural land owned by the Irvine Co . Why not arrange for a historic public-private land swap ? Under the terms of the swap , the Irvine Co . would deed thousands of acres of its agricultural land to the federal_government . These magnificent lands would be placed in trust , ensuring that much of Orange County ' s remaining agricultural open space would be permanently preserved , forever free_of development . In exchange , the federal_government would deed ownership of the El Toro base to the Irvine Co . But the company would get more_than ownership . It would also receive the federal funds earmarked for military base conversion , including the hundreds of millions of dollars needed to clean_up the toxic_wastes that now contaminate the soils and subsoils at El Toro . Once the costly , labor-intensive cleanup task was underway , The Irvine Co . would have rights to develop the base , subject_to two conditions : First , there could be no commercial airport development at El Toro -- that would be a closed issue once and for all . Second , in its development of El Toro , the Irvine Co . would be expected to make use of the city of Irvine ' s $ 125 million in state rail-bond funds to build an innovative monorail system that would serve the El Toro-Irvine area and later expand to other parts of Orange County . What are the benefits of this kind of a land swap and development agreement ? * For the Irvine Co. , the swap would be a chance to do what it does_well -- assert itself as the master developer of a large tract of land , mixing commercial , residential and industrial development . In this case , the development could take_place within the broad guidelines of a federal / county / private agreement allowing_for what amounts to a large-scale enterprise_zone that promises unusual flexibility and profit . Because the conversion of El Toro would involve the cleanup and restoration of land damaged by toxics , the Irvine Co . would not only have access to millions of dollars of cleanup funds , it would also find itself wearing the hat of environmental protector . In addition , the swap would permit the Irvine Co . to do what it soon has to do anyway -- abandon its &quot; neutrality &quot; on the proposal to build a commercial airport at El Toro . Everyone knows that thousands of overflights from commercial air operations at El Toro would devastate Irvine , the world-famous planned community that bears the company ' s name . If the Irvine Co . were to stand_by and let this happen , it might as well trade_in its reputation as a &quot; community builder &quot; for a new sobriquet : &quot; community buster. &quot; * For Orange County residents , the early redevelopment of El Toro ( but not as an airport ) will put many thousands of people to work . Thousands of scientists , engineers and technicians will be needed for the difficult work of cleaning_up the toxic mess at El Toro . Still more workers , with other special skills , will be needed to begin the design and construction of the Irvine monorail , which can be the first 15-mile link in an extended monorail or &quot; fixed guideway &quot; system that connects most of Orange County ' s cities , including Mission Viejo , Irvine , Santa Ana and Anaheim . Already the site of an Amtrak station , the Irvine-El Toro area is perfectly positioned to become a &quot; National Center for Transportation and Environmental Excellence &quot; -- a place where thousands work_on rail_technologies that we first manufacture for our own use here in Orange County , then for_sale throughout the country and even throughout the world . The design and manufacture of modern rail systems can provide Southern California with the same kind of economic boom by 2000 that military and commercial aviation was providing in 1950 . * For the federal_government , the El Toro / Irvine Co . land swap is a chance to produce a large-scale base conversion success story . It ' s a chance to shut_down military operations at El Toro by 1997 , as originally planned . But the shutdown will take_place while a ready-to-go environmental cleanup and redevelopment plan is already underway . These arrangements can be part of a negotiated land swap that could take_place as early as next year . The federal_government , of course , would emerge with thousands of acres of orange groves and prime agricultural land -- a revenue-producing resource but also a remarkable open-space resource for everyone who lives and works in Orange County or who visits here . The government could declare these lands a &quot; National Urban Agricultural Preserve , &quot; maintaining current farming operations . Or , to effect military relocation costs , federal authorities could arrange for rapid resale of the agricultural lands . The resale could be part of a popular statewide or local bond issue , generating many millions of dollars in quick cash . It could also involve the American Farmland Trust or a similar private nonprofit entity that would oversee and manage the permanent agricultural operations . * For high elected officials -- most notably the five county supervisors , Rep . Christopher Cox ( who represents Irvine and El Toro ) , and U.S. Sens . Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer -- a land swap and early conversion of El Toro represents a chance to demonstrate some real leadership . But if these officials are to spare us many years of costly fighting over an airport , they ' ll have to set_aside their various shades of neutrality on the issue and take a stand . Land swaps with the military aren ' t new_to Orange County . Small-scale swaps in the 1970s and 1980s were very successful . So , what ' s it going_to be ? A 15-year battle over an unneeded and unwanted commercial airport at El Toro ? Or a large-scale , historic land swap that can quickly combine the dual benefits of open-space preservation and planned redevelopment ?</TEXT>
