   <HEADLINE> WRITER PENS CRITIQUES OF COUNTY PROJECTS ; COMMENTARY : ESSAYIST AND URBAN PLANNER WILLIAM FULTON OF VENTURA POINTS_OUT THE GOOD , THE BAD AND THE ABOMINABLE OF LOCAL LAND-USE DECISIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For urban planner-essayist William Fulton , the road from upstate New York to hillside Ventura was lined with barbed commentary and , sometimes , infuriated response . A Washington sportswriter was so offended by a 1985 Fulton column arguing against a major_league baseball_team for the nation ' s capital that he declared Fulton ' s assertions &quot; the greatest compendium of flapdoodle ever accepted for the written page. &quot; &quot; I felt that if Shirley Povich was writing a column attacking me , &quot; Fulton said recently , &quot; then maybe I ' d finally arrived as a pundit. &quot; Fulton , 38 , a Ventura resident since 1987 but a planner and writer with a nationwide scope , has only recently begun to turn his planner ' s expertise and sharp pen to communities around him in Ventura County . And Fulton ' s perspectives , incorporated in his statewide planning newsletter , California Planning &amp; Development Report , increasingly strike_home with local subscribers -- professional planners in Thousand Oaks , Ventura , Oxnard and the County Hall of Administration . &quot; I can ' t think_of another individual who has his perspective on new ideas , new legal decisions and new ways of doing things in land-use planning , &quot; said Everett Millais , Ventura ' s top city planner . &quot; Most planners don ' t write very well , so his ability to make_sense out of some very complex issues is a unique talent . Whenever I see something by him , I read it. &quot; Fulton said that after seven years in the county , he is ready to occasionally turn an eye to local planning decisions . &quot; I ' ve been here long enough now to have an opinion , &quot; he said . &quot; People are going_to hate me. &quot; A sampling of Fulton opinions : * Putting a Cal State university campus among lemon groves near Camarillo is the worst planning decision in recent county history . &quot; You ' re basically busting the greenbelt . The site is a disaster. &quot; * The Ahmanson Ranch mini-city project in the Simi Hills is not a bad deal , since the government could not have paid market_prices for the 10 # 000 acres of parkland in the package and pressure to build_on the ranch certainly would have increased . * Weldon Canyon at the mouth of the Ojai Valley should be approved as the west county ' s principal landfill . &quot; You can get riled up about saving one canyon , but if we ' re going to generate trash , we have to figure_out how to deal with it. &quot; * A new jail in the agricultural greenbelt near Santa Paula was necessary and its approval responsible . &quot; In order to be true communities , the good things and the bad things have to be together . And a jail is part of it. &quot; Here and elsewhere , Fulton -- who holds master ' s degrees in urban_planning and journalism -- straddles the line between planning and commentary . He not only publishes a monthly newsletter , but analyzes development issues for magazines and newspapers nationwide , lectures on urban_planning at UC Santa Barbara and recently completed a UCLA-sponsored study on growth along the Ventura Freeway near Thousand Oaks . He even addressed land-use issues as a government official , serving as chairman of the West Hollywood Planning_Commission in 1986-87 . Now Fulton sees himself as a lightning_rod for topical discussion . &quot; It ' s sort of my job to bring things to people ' s attention , &quot; he said . &quot; In the planning profession in California , there are very few people who can get_up and speak their minds without stepping_on toes . They either work for government_agencies or are consultants for developers. &quot; Millais recalled a scene at a national planning conference where Fulton , a featured speaker , provoked a heated debate . &quot; He put_forward to a group of die-hard planning types that the only effective planning is being done_by developers , &quot; Millais said . * Surrounded by the paintings of his artist wife in his light-splashed office overlooking a green Ondulando-area hillside , Fulton discussed what he sees as the best and worst planning decisions in recent county history . He cited abominable projects in Ventura and Oxnard but gave the county high marks for its determination to prevent leapfrog development beyond city boundaries . &quot; What all this adds_up to , I think , is we ' ve established a pretty good framework for regional planning , &quot; he said . &quot; But when you get_down to the projects , it ' s just a mess. &quot; Success can be measured by the continued separation of the county ' s 10 cities by farmland and by park agencies ' acquisition of scenic ranches in the Santa Monica Mountains and the Simi Hills , he said . The county can also be proud_of efforts to restore the historic downtowns of the west county . And , taken_on its own terms as a commuter suburb , Thousand Oaks , especially the Westlake portion , is remarkably attractive and self-contained , he said . But many key decisions at the city level have been marked by a lack of vision -- and by officials ' refusal to take an unpopular stand , he said . For example , government acquiescence to a Cal State campus near Camarillo &quot; was the BANANA solution -- Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anybody , &quot; he said . He took no position on the Taylor Ranch site overlooking the ocean in Ventura , favoring instead a ranch next to the Ventura Freeway near Ventura Harbor . A core problem of Ventura County ' s local planning is that &quot; we ' ve never really questioned the suburban ( development ) model -- that any destination you might go_to needs to be as close as possible to where your car is parked , &quot; Fulton said . Rather than auto-oriented shopping_malls and sterile , segregated housing tracts , Fulton prefers clustering homes , stores and offices in self-contained communities that emphasize travel on bike or foot , not by car . The traditional small_town -- where people could eat , work and play within walking distance of their homes -- is not a bad planning model , he said . In fact , several such neo-traditional villages have been proposed statewide . &quot; Communities need to be self-contained on the neighborhood level , yet connected in an effective way to the rest of the city , &quot; Fulton said . That helps create a sense of place -- an essential element if people are to care about their cities . Ventura has that sense , for example . Camarillo does not , he said . Downtown Ventura has a distinct identity . It is marked by notable buildings , especially the ornate City_Hall . And it has a variety of shops , restaurants and special events that work well together , Fulton said . Although Ventura now sprawls many miles eastward , its heart clearly is its historical downtown , he said . And that helps people feel_like they live_in a real place , not an appendage of Los Angeles . &quot; People define their communities as narrowly as they can . If they can mentally detach even from their city , they will , &quot; he said . &quot; But everybody can identify with the central part of Ventura. &quot; The murder of a Ventura High_School senior last year demonstrated the emotional connection of residents throughout the city , he said . &quot; When Jesse Strobel was killed in central Ventura , east Ventura didn ' t say , ' I don ' t care , ' &quot; Fulton said . &quot; Part of that is a strong sense of place that helps us to break_out of our cocoons. &quot; In contrast , he sees Camarillo as just another suburban city , where Mediterranean-style color_schemes are enforced by a strict design code , but which is indistinguishable from the blur of cities in Orange County . &quot; It ' s shopping_centers , parking_lots , an arterial highway and walled-off subdivisions , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s low-rise , auto-oriented and very suburban . It ' s like 100 other communities in California . If you put me blindfolded in that town , I would n ' t be able to tell you where I was . And that ' s the test of whether you have a place. &quot; * Increasingly , Fulton has jumped into the fray in his home city of Ventura , trying to protect its sense of place . He publicly challenged the City_Council in the fall to resist expansion of Buenaventura Mall unless developers could offer something more creative than &quot; a bunch of stores just dropped on top of a parking lot. &quot; Fulton insisted that developer MaceRich ' s plan to bulldoze several established neighborhood-oriented stores to bring_in more large &quot; anchor &quot; department_stores was &quot; a retailing dinosaur &quot; that failed to link the mall with nearby stores and neighborhoods . He even suggested that MaceRich build senior_citizen housing atop the center ' s proposed new parking garages so that the mall ' s character would be more compatible with the neighborhood . City officials have argued that they have little choice but to approve an expanded mall because of competition among Ventura , Oxnard and neighboring cities for a dominant regional shopping_center . But Fulton said that even if it is true that only one regional mall will thrive between Thousand Oaks and Santa Barbara , the winner will not necessarily be the one built first . &quot; It will be the one that most successfully creates a place where people want to go , &quot; he said . Millais said Fulton ' s ideas make_good sense but that MaceRich holds the trump_card , since cities are increasingly dependent_on sales taxes to balance their budgets . &quot; They say , ' Do you want us or not ? And if you want us , it ' s going_to be as we ' re used to doing business , ' &quot; Millais said . He said he knew of only a handful of cities -- Santa Barbara among them -- that have had the political will to force developers to substantially alter their projects to meld with existing city design . As things have progressed , MaceRich may cut the size of its expansion for economic reasons . That could produce an expansion that works within the broader fabric of the city , Millais said . &quot; But that is not because of anything we did , &quot; he said . &quot; The planning is being done_by the development community. &quot; As Fulton has become more involved in local issues , his positions have drawn fire and his philosophy has been interpreted by some as pro-development . &quot; I find him interesting reading , but I certainly don ' t agree with his politics , &quot; Ventura Councilman Gary Tuttle said . &quot; He ' s a bit too conservative for my liking. &quot; Mary Wiesbrock , director of Agoura-based Save Open Space , chastised Fulton for concluding that the 3 # 050-dwelling Ahmanson Ranch was a reasonable compromise given the dearth of public money to buy the land . &quot; Is he getting paid by them ? &quot; Wiesbrock said . &quot; He has his head in the sand if he calls himself a planner and says it ' s a good thing. &quot; Fulton said he is sometimes characterized as pro-business because he accepts the inevitability of some growth . &quot; My agenda is to try to take the growth I think is inevitable and sculpt it to shape a better community , &quot; he said . &quot; Sometimes just being anti-growth is the easy way_out . . . . The debate gets polarized into whether you are for or against growth , but the reality is a lot more subtle than that. &quot; * When Fulton considers Ventura County ' s future , he bucks the conventional wisdom : He does not think that all local cities will one day merge into another Orange County . &quot; It ' s important to remember that most of the population growth is behind us , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t see a doubling of the population or anything like that . &quot; Fillmore may be the exception , and Moorpark will definitely grow , &quot; he added . &quot; But in Ventura , everybody was arguing ( in 1989 ) over whether the population would be 102 # 000 or 112 # 000 or 122 # 000 . And I ' m thinking to myself , ' We ' ve gone from 20 # 000 to 90 # 000 in 20 years , so we ' ve already made our bed . We have to come_to grips with the town that we ' ve created and improve it. ' &quot; Perhaps the most important decision facing this county -- the one that will most affect growth -- is whether officials eventually approve commercial airline service at Point Mugu Naval Air_Station , Fulton said . The Navy announced last year that it would allow jetliners to use its world-class runways on a limited basis . Business_leaders and some public officials quickly endorsed the plan . But air carriers , nearly all losing money in existing markets , have balked so far . Like many county residents , Fulton is ambivalent about the prospect of an airport , because its approval could prompt a boom similar to Orange County ' s after the expansion of John Wayne Airport . &quot; As a businessman , I can tell you that the lack of an airport is the single biggest impediment to doing business around here , &quot; he said . &quot; And I think in the long_run , this county needs air connection to the rest of the state . &quot; But I think the lack of an airport is one thing that has kept this area nice , &quot; he said . Whether Ventura County can maintain its high_quality of life will be a pressing question over the next 20 years , Fulton said . &quot; The key to livability is short commutes , &quot; he said . So each city must strive to balance jobs and population . Ventura and Oxnard are unique among the cities in Southern California because they have almost a perfect balance of homes and jobs , regional studies show . But Simi Valley and Moorpark must continue to expand their industrial base , and Thousand Oaks its job market , if residents are to escape commuter gridlock in 2010 , he said . No matter how Ventura County responds to growth pressure , its proximity to Los Angeles County is an overriding consideration , Fulton said . &quot; Approval of 40 million square_feet of space at Warner Center ( in Woodland Hills ) may be the single most important planning decision to affect Ventura County , &quot; he said . &quot; Camarillo is only half an hour away. &quot; Fulton ' s List Best Planning Decisions * Adoption by cities and Ventura County of Guidelines for Orderly Development in 1969 : &quot; It created a rational regional context for land-use planning . It made each of the cities identifiably separate . You usually know what town you ' re in in Ventura County . It reduced the competition among the cities , so they weren ' t annexing like crazy . I don ' t think they suppressed that much demand for growth , and we ' ve been able to channel growth pretty rationally. &quot; * Creation of the Santa Monica Mountains planning process : &quot; The National Recreation Area and the ( Santa Monica ) Mountains Conservancy was one of the very important and good things . It created a regional framework for what should go where -- where stuff should be built and where it shouldn ' t . The Ahmanson Ranch would have been built long ago without the ( recreation area ) . &quot; * City support for historic downtowns in Oxnard , Ventura , Fillmore , Ojai and Santa Paula : &quot; They never did what many areas did -- use the iron mallet of redevelopment to tear_down our downtowns . Everybody can identify with the central part of these towns . People say Ventura did some bad things -- the condos on the_hills . But nobody said , ' Let ' s extend the redevelopment area and knock_down the Ventura Theatre. ' &quot; * Ventura ' s restoration of the old county_courthouse and its conversion into City_Hall : &quot; If there is any one building that makes Ventura a place , that ' s it . It ' s everything a beautiful building should be . It ' s up a hill . It overlooks the ocean . It ' s just spectacularly beautiful , and it would have been awful to let something happen to it . . . . ( Such buildings ) go together in creating definable places. &quot; * Expansion of Metrolink to the west county : &quot; The prospect of using Metrolink creatively to link the county together is real . The best example of its creative use is when they started to run trains in reverse to the County Fair . And now it ' s to the Beach Party . The fairgrounds are a focal_point for the whole county . And Metrolink is great for Simi Valley and Moorpark . It will help to make Simi and Moopark more economically connected with the Valley. &quot; Worst Planning Decisions * Locating the Cal State university campus west of Camarillo : &quot; The site is a disaster . If you think you can put Cal State on farmland away from the freeway and keep the rest of the greenbelt , you ' re nuts . If they ' d picked the Lusk property ( in Ventura ) , they ' d knock_out one farm right on the freeway adjacent to the city rather than taking_out a whole greenbelt . You can argue ( the Camarillo site ' s ) central location . From Thousand Oaks , it ' s not as far to drive . But that ' s only one point. &quot; * Johnson Drive development in Ventura : &quot; That is my favorite bad-planning decision . It was a large tract of land with one property_owner . It is the gateway to the city . You could have done anything with that to let people know , ' You ' re in a place in the city of Ventura. ' Instead , they built a no-brainer . You throw down six-lane roads , a pad for Carl ' s Jr. , a pad for Toys R Us , then across the street a pad for movie_theaters . I wonder how many times I have eaten dinner at the Chinese restaurant and then decided whether I should risk my life and run_across to the theater . You have to get_in your car . And once you ' re in your car , you can go anywhere. &quot; * Moving county offices out of the Ventura downtown : &quot; That removed from the downtown any hope of Ventura being a true office and government center . It ' s left to specialty retail . I admit there are so many physical constrictions , it would have been really hard to build_in the downtown . They needed a tremendous amount of space . But they could have at least kept the courthouse downtown . I ' m not sure in the long_run what has been gained . Ultimately , it was a real bad decision , a real growth inducer. &quot; * Oxnard Financial Plaza : &quot; They ' re huge buildings in a suburban setting . They have the components of a skyscraper office_building , a business hotel and a financial low-rise . But to organize it in such a poor way on the ground_level so you can ' t avoid walking across a parking_lot is just poor planning . I have a problem trying to figure_out even what the front of that place is . That creates cognitive pain . . . . You don ' t know where anything is relative to anything else . It ' s an obstruction even to business . The age of throwing_up buildings ought to be over . That place really drives me nuts. &quot; * The Radisson Suite Hotel in Oxnard : &quot; It ' s a dumb location , and it was a dumb deal for the city . They thought , ' Oh gosh , we ' ll get the Radisson and we ' ll get the ( Los Angeles ) Raiders training camp . we ' ll do the deal as a redevelopment project and we ' ll be fine. ' They thought the team would be a tourist draw . They forgot they were dealing with Al Davis , who immediately put_up a wall all around the practice field . Then the city guaranteed payments on the ( site improvement ) bonds and was hung_out to dry to the tune of $ 1 million a year. &quot; * &quot; Sales Tax Canyon &quot; ( near Rose Avenue ) : &quot; That is not entirely Oxnard ' s fault because , in part , they responded to state tax law . Look how tempting that was . You have a needy population , and you ' re able to annex a lot of property adjacent to the freeway , so you just load it up with any retail you can get . Then you have these off-ramps designed for lemon trucks . Oxnard sees itself as getting a leg up_on other cities with the auto dealerships , but look what ' s happened to Oxnard Boulevard . . . . Then the business culture has come_to expect tributes in tax_breaks . Sales Tax Canyon is a manifestation of that , and it ' s going_to turn_out to be a mess forever . There ' s no way ( for traffic ) to get_through that bend right now. &quot; Profile of William Fulton Born : Sept . 26 , 1956 , in Auburn , N . Y . Education : B A journalism , St .
