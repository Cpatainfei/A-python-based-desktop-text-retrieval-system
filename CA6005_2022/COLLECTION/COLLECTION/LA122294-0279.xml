   <HEADLINE> KEY DEBATE ON BERLUSCONI ' S FATE BEGINS ; ITALY : THE BESIEGED PRIME_MINISTER CALLS FORMER ALLIES ' TURNCOATS. ' HE MAY RESIGN TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Italy ' s long and agonizing political crisis appeared to be nearing a climax Wednesday -- if not an end -- as Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi and his enemies began an angry parliamentary showdown amid mounting reports that his resignation was imminent . In a 45-minute speech , the media magnate denounced onetime allies attempting to topple his 8-month-old government as &quot; turncoats &quot; betraying not only him but the nation . His opponents told him his days in office were numbered and accused him of monarchical pretense . &quot; I must remind you , Mr. Berlusconi , &quot; declared Northern League leader Umberto Bossi -- once an ally , now an enemy -- &quot; that the state is not you , and after you , there will be no deluge . The state will not collapse. &quot; The dramatic debate -- punctuated by cheers and jeers , heckling and banner-waving -- stormed on into the night . It was a prelude to a vote_of_confidence likely to take_place within the following 48 hours unless Berlusconi preempts it by submitting his resignation . A government spokesman said Wednesday night that Berlusconi ' s resignation could come today . If he resigns , he is not likely to go quietly . He gave all_the appearances Wednesday of a man determined to fight on , either by attempting to form a new coalition or fighting for power in a new election . Earlier this week , he called_on his followers to take_to the streets in massive demonstrations if he is ousted . He has , Berlusconi told Parliament , &quot; a mandate to govern. &quot; Only the voters can settle things now , he said . &quot; It is inevitable. &quot; Many observers here said the gap in Parliament between leftists and conservatives would make formation of anything but an interim government impossible . A number of members_of_Parliament speaking Wednesday advocated just that -- an interim , caretaker government to forestall chaos . The death of Italy ' s 53rd postwar government , if it happens , will come from the same forces that gave it life : corruption , fiscal instability , general discontent and ceaseless feuding among parties and factions . Those were the conditions when Berlusconi ' s conservative coalition surged to electoral victory March 28 , convincing voters that a populist &quot; outsider &quot; and a Parliament of novices would bring an end to Italy ' s troubles . Instead of fixing the problems , Berlusconi has become identified with them . His fiscal austerity measures -- particularly attempts to cut government-funded pensions -- alienated trade_unions . He and his business empire , Fininvest , became prime targets of Italy ' s aggressive corruption probers . Berlusconi ' s coalition -- consisting_of his own Forza Italia movement , the neo-Fascist National Alliance and Bossi ' s Northern League -- was shaky from the start . It began to disintegrate earlier this month when Bossi formally withdrew , taking most , if not all , of his party with him .</TEXT>
