   <HEADLINE> COLUMN RIGHT / JONATHAN CLARKE : SABER-RATTLING BY REPUBLICANS IS ILL-ADVISED ; INSTEAD OF EXPANDING NATO EASTWARD , GIVE PRIORITY TO A CONSERVATIVE PLAN FOR EUROPE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In determining their November vote , most Americans probably paid little regard_to foreign military policy , except perhaps to feel that the Republicans would display a surer grasp of American interests than would the Clinton_Administration . It is still early , but the warning signs are already flashing : The initial pronouncements of senior Republicans on such subjects as Bosnia , NATO and North_Korea contain all too_much political posturing unrelated to real events on the ground . If this continues , we may be headed back to the dark days of early Clintonism when big talk made_do for clear-headed analysis . This will disturb anyone who hoped that the Republicans would set_about restoring America ' s reputation and influence . Leaving aside some of the more reckless statements about an all-out bombing campaign against Serbia and saber-rattling about overturning the nuclear agreement with North_Korea , the most serious issue revolves_around NATO and the future of European security . The disarray at the meeting of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe earlier this month demonstrates that a dangerous security vacuum exists in Europe . Given that two world_wars have started in Europe , it is very much in American interests that new and credible security structures fill that vacuum . This is precisely where Republican realism is most needed -- and , alas , where it is most lacking . Instead of forcing the Administration and the Europeans to make the necessary hard decisions , the Republicans are abetting the game of Washington and European make-believe . If , as some argue , Russia is re-emerging as a potential threat , this is the very worst way to proceed . To deter aggression , Europe requires what the_French call &quot; hard &quot; security -- cast-iron guarantees that , in certain circumstances , military_forces will be available to honor treaty obligations . Throughout the Cold_War , the Soviets knew beyond_doubt that the United States would respond massively to any attack on NATO . Compare this to the situation today . As a response to security jitters in Central Europe , NATO proposes to expand eastward . This means that American GIs would be called_on to defend the eastern borders of Poland and Hungary . Not only does this entail new commitments against a potentially resurgent Russia , but , just as likely , it would draw the United States into the murky arena of Central European ethnic rivalries . Just when public_opinion strongly rejects foreign entanglements , the American global cop would be given a new precinct to patrol . If this is to be a &quot; hard &quot; commitment , the implications are enormous : a massive increase in defense spending ; a return to Cold_War levels of 300 # 000 American troops in Europe and a reversal in the public sentiment against American casualties in ambiguous causes . Unless these conditions are fulfilled , the new obligations will not be worth the paper they are written_on -- any more_than were British and French pre-World War II guarantees to Czechoslovakia . This produces a situation in Europe whereby nations think that they enjoy security , but in practical fact do not , which can lead to disastrous miscalculation . None of this is unknown to experienced Republican foreign-policy experts . Yet instead of insisting that the Administration come clean with the American people , the Republicans are conniving in the pretense that American resources and American lives remain available to sort_out Europe ' s problems . Aggressors everywhere know that this is not true . And so the European security vacuum remains dangerously unfilled and ominously ready to suck_in American combat forces . The way around this dilemma is to forget talk_of NATO expansion and , in its place , work toward a new European security_system on a continent-wide basis . The great American achievement after World_War_II was to re-integrate Germany into the West European family of nations . Today ' s challenge lies_in developing a system to perform that task for Russia . Unilateral American efforts cannot accomplish this . Instead , the United States should focus_on strengthening structures like the CSCE , the West European Union and the Franco-German Eurocorps . The Republicans are ideally placed to restore American credibility . Their philosophy of limited government and matching resources to objectives puts them in tune with public_opinion . This will enable them to re-create the consensus under which U.S. commitments meant what they said . Honesty in foreign_policy may_not win many short-term votes , but -- dare one say it ? -- may be good for the national interest .</TEXT>
