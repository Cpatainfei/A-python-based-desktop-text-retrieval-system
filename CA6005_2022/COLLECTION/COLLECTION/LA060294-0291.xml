   <HEADLINE> PUNITIVE DAMAGES FROM POLICE IN KING BEATING REJECTED ; COURTS : JURY THAT HAD AWARDED VICTIM $ 3.8 MILLION CONCLUDES OFFICERS SHOULD NOT PAY . VERDICT SIGNALS THE END OF A DRAMA THAT HAS RACKED L.A. FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Signaling an end to one of the most wrenching chapters in Los Angeles history , the jury that had awarded Rodney King $ 3.8 million for his fateful police beating decided Wednesday to leave it at that , declining to impose punitive damages against the officers who beat him . The Los Angeles federal_court panel , which reached its verdict on the 11th day of deliberations , found that former LAPD policemen Laurence M . Powell and Stacey C . Koon had acted with malice in the 1991 beating of King . But the jury concluded that the officers involved in the beating had been sufficiently punished and should not be forced to pay King as much as $ 15 million more -- a penalty that King ' s lawyers had sought to deter similar acts in the future . Although the racially mixed jury ' s verdict was unanimous , it was apparent from the brief comments of several panelists that it was not reached without acrimony . The strongest indication came from the jury ' s only African American , who served alongside six whites , one Latino and one Filipino American . &quot; There was no justice here . . . no justice at all , &quot; the juror , a South Pasadena seamstress , told reporters before driving_away . &quot; It ' s purely black and white. &quot; The verdict offered neither the retribution the King camp had hoped for nor the absolution sought by supporters of the police . Indeed , midway through the trial , U.S. District Judge John G . Davies removed one of the case ' s most symbolic flash_points by dismissing the best known and wealthiest defendant , former Los Angeles Police_Chief Daryl F . Gates . By the time the three-man , six-woman jury announced Wednesday afternoon that their verdict was reached , reaction -- in and outside the courtroom -- was as factionalized and weary as the city that had formed the sprawling backdrop for the trial . King was not present during the announcement of the verdict and could not be reached for comment . But his lawyers said they were outraged , despite what one called the &quot; Solomon-type decision. &quot; Lead attorney Milton Grimes said : &quot; How do you give a man $ 3 # 816 , 535.45 who was beaten and not consider the badness of the beaters ? &quot; Grimes said he is considering an appeal of the decision to remove Gates as a defendant . He also said a reported weekend barbecue attended by three jurors could form the basis of an appeal if they discussed the case . Of the six defendants facing the prospect of having to personally pay damages to King , only former Officer Timothy E . Wind was present in court as the verdict was read . He later spoke with reporters . &quot; This has been a long road I ' ve traveled and I am very pleased with the decision , &quot; said Wind , who was a probationary police_officer at the time of the beating and who says he is now destitute and unemployed . &quot; It ' s taken a chunk out of my life , a big chunk. &quot; Ira Salzman , Koon ' s attorney , called the verdict &quot; entirely correct , &quot; adding that police &quot; can now do their job and not fear this vindictive prosecution. &quot; Powell ' s attorney , Michael P . Stone , agreed . &quot; I ' m just so happy it ' s over. &quot; People throughout Los Angeles agreed that during the past three years the case has exacted a heavy toll . The most immediate reaction to the jury ' s decision -- from the streets of South-Central to the police_precincts of the San Fernando Valley -- was mainly one of relief that the ordeal appears to be finally playing itself out . &quot; I ' m really glad this is over , &quot; said Fletcher Jordan , a salesman at a sporting goods store at the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza . &quot; It ' s been a long process that we ' ve been going_through . Everyone. &quot; But beneath the sense of exhaustion , simmering resentments remained . In South-Central , where rioting decimated broad swaths of the city , UCLA student Trina White echoed the sentiments of many , saying that &quot; once again , the police are getting_off scot-free. &quot; White and others were particularly upset that only taxpayers -- and not police_officers -- will be paying King for the injuries he sustained . &quot; Once again , the buck is being dropped to us and we have to pay , &quot; she said . Although the awarding of substantial punitive damages would have been largely symbolic because the officers have few large assets , some felt that the jury should have sent a clearer message to the Police_Department . &quot; It seems to me the purpose of punitive damages is to extract a_level of responsibility from someone who perpetrated an act that was harmful to someone else , &quot; said Councilwoman Rita Walters . She said she found it &quot; beyond the realm of understanding &quot; that the jurors did not require the officers to pay even one dollar . Urban League President John Mack said that he believes such a message of responsibility was necessary for Koon and Powell . &quot; True , they are serving time , but they are doing so without showing any contrition . . . . You can ' t run_around brutalizing every African American young_man that you encounter. &quot; For their part , many of the city ' s police_officers took bittersweet comfort in seeing the defendants escape civil penalties . &quot; Those police_officers did what they had to do to go_home safe that night , and the citizens and the media destroyed this department for it , &quot; said Officer Jeff Hart of the LAPD ' s Foothill Division , where the four officers accused in the beating were once stationed . Sgt . Leonard Ross , president of the Oscar Joel Bryant Assn. , which represents African American police_officers , said : ' He ( King ) got paid , the guys are in prison . This trial was just like shooting a dead person. &quot; The verdict marked the denouement of a drama that has racked Los Angeles for more_than three years . The grainy , videotaped image of the white policemen clubbing the cowering black motorist , aired first by a local television_station , forced the city to confront long-simmering racial tensions and set the stage for the worst urban riots in modern history . In the years that ensued , Los Angeles got a new mayor and a new police_chief . The city ' s government underwent seismic shifts . And the lives of those involved on that traffic stop in Lake View Terrace would never be the same . The King case prompted two criminal trials , one state and the other federal . The first yielded not_guilty verdicts for the officers involved , triggering riots in which at least 53 people were killed . The second ended with the convictions of Koon and Powell for violating King ' s civil_rights . Then , two months ago , a third trial began , as King brought a civil suit against the city for monetary damages . By the time of Wednesday ' s verdict , all four officers charged initially were unemployed , and King -- a high_school dropout and ex-con -- was a household name and a millionaire . Like the court proceedings before it , the civil trial shed little light on the particulars of the beating . But it offered a glimpse of the havoc wrought by the incident ' s aftermath . The civil case was essentially a two-phase process in which King asked first for compensation for medical_bills , pain and suffering and then for punitive assessments against the individual officers . The first phase ended with an order from the jury that the city pay King $ 3.8 million in compensatory damages . But the second part of the trial involved the much thornier issue of punishment for the individual officers . Jurors , who were able to use testimony from both phases of the trial , evaluated whether present and former officers used unreasonable force or acted in reckless disregard for King ' s constitutional rights , then determined whether those officers should have to compensate King from their own pockets . King ' s lawyers had asked the jury to award between $ 3.8 million and $ 15 million in punitive damages from Koon , Powell , Wind , former Officer Theodore J . Briseno and current Officers Rolando Solano and Louis Turriaga . Wind kicked and hit King with a baton ; Briseno stomped him . Turriaga was accused of stepping_on King while trying to handcuff him , and then he and Solano dragged King on the asphalt while moving him off the roadway . But attorneys for defendants Koon , Powell , Wind and Briseno -- the defendants in the state trial -- argued that they are now impoverished and have suffered enough . Koon and Powell are serving 30 months in prison . Wind , a rookie probationary officer , was dismissed from the department , and Briseno was suspended from the force and is trying to get his job back . &quot; The officers have been victimized just like Rodney King , &quot; said Salzman , attorney for Koon , who was the supervisor in_charge . In court testimony , the officers detailed their suffering . They were outcasts among their peers , they told the jury ; their careers and homes and life savings were gone . Koon and Powell said they now work for 12 cents an hour in prison to pay_for their personal necessities . Wind ' s wife broke_down in tears on the stand when she described the toll the case has taken_on her family . Briseno took the rare step of countersuing King for a share of the award , arguing that King shoved him in the chest before the beating . The jury Wednesday agreed that Briseno had been struck but awarded him no damages . To the end , the majority of the officers were unrepentant , saying they had acted within police procedure in their treatment of King . Koon , wearing a prison-issue blue uniform and plastic sandals , reiterated his claim that he &quot; tased &quot; King and ordered others to beat the motorist because he was resisting arrest and appeared to be under the influence of PCP . &quot; I know I didn ' t do anything wrong , &quot; Koon said . &quot; I acted in good_faith . I ' ve taken full responsibility and accountability for my actions. &quot; Powell said he struck King numerous times with his metal baton because he feared for his safety , and because he was following Koon ' s orders . When Powell was asked whether he thought he had done anything wrong , he snapped : &quot; I not only don ' t think it , I know it. &quot; Only Briseno has expressed remorse at the incident -- a move that he said has made him a pariah among some police_officers . &quot; For three years , I ' ve put_up with this , and it hurts , &quot; he said . &quot; I look over at Larry and Stacey and I think , ' Is it only me that ' s admitted something wrong happened out there ? ' &quot; King admitted that he had had too_much to drink that night and said he panicked when police began following his car because he was a parolee and did not want to go_back to jail . Disputing testimony from police who said that King led officers on a long chase , King said he tried to elude the patrol_car for about 12 blocks , before deciding that it made little sense to run . King ' s lawyers said he tried to follow orders until one of the officers taunted him with racial slurs and told him to run_for his life . When he tried to run , he said , he was savagely beaten . &quot; I was just so scared . I felt_like I was going_to die , &quot; King said on the stand . When officers hogtied and dragged him to the side of the road , &quot; I felt_like a cow that was waiting to be slaughtered , like a piece of meat , &quot; he said . King ' s attorneys argued that such treatment was business as usual for the LAPD , particularly against minorities . They introduced evidence from the Christopher Commission report to show that Gates was ultimately responsible_for racism by the officers under his command . But Davies dismissed Gates as a defendant , shocking King ' s lawyers . The judge said King ' s lawyers had failed to show that Gates should be held accountable for the beating . The controversial police_chief retired in 1992 after the riots . &quot; Bad management is not enough , &quot; Davies said . &quot; Allowing racism is not enough . Poor supervision is not enough. &quot; The judge ' s decision took_away the most affluent defendant in the case , leaving King with only the &quot; little fish , &quot; said one of his attorneys . The original list of 15 defendants was eventually whittled_down to six , with no one above the rank of Koon . Since the incident , King has chalked_up $ 200 # 000 in medical_expenses for injuries including facial and leg fractures . He said he still suffers from flashbacks , dizziness , blurred vision and numbness in his face from multiple baton blows . Defense_attorneys said King brought many of his problems on himself , and they dug_into his records to show that he was a troublemaker in school and a delinquent at an early age . They told the jury that he tested positive for drugs and had several run-ins with the law . King has tried to turn his life around , his lawyers said , by seeking his high_school diploma and spending more time with his wife and children . But wherever he goes , they say , he is constantly reminded of the beating . He wears a bulletproof_vest and is accompanied by security_guards -- even to his son ' s Little_League games . &quot; I feel_like I ' m a walking target , &quot; he told the jury .</TEXT>
