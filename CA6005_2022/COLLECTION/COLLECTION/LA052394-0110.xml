   <HEADLINE> TENNIS / FRENCH OPEN ; BECKER : SAMPRAS AHEAD OF FIELD , CALENDAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Boris Becker , for one , is impressed by how Pete Sampras is handling clay this year . This , from the man Sampras routed , 6-1 , 6-2 , 6-2 , in the Italian Open final on the slow surface last week . &quot; He is playing like they will play the game in the 21st Century , &quot; Becker said . &quot; He ' s doing things I ' ve never seen on the tennis court. &quot; Sampras , 22 , has the chance to do something no one has done_in 25 years -- win four consecutive Grand_Slam tennis tournaments -- when the_French Open begins today at Roland Garros Stadium in Paris . The women ' s favorite , Steffi Graf , is trying_for her fifth consecutive Grand_Slam event title , and anyone remotely connected to the game believes she will get_it . During the next two weeks , we will see if the world ' s top-ranked male and female can continue their remarkable streaks in the one tournament where seedings mean less than clay-court ability . Sampras might be No . 1 , but he must share the favorite ' s role with No . 4 Andrei Medvedev of Russia , No . 6 Sergi Bruguera of Spain and No . 7 Jim Courier , a two-time winner in Paris . Only one can reach the final because they are all seeded in the top-half of the draw . Also in the difficult mix are No . 11 Thomas Muster of Austria , No . 16 Richard Krajicek of the_Netherlands and No . 19 Andre Agassi . &quot; ( The winner ) is going_to be someone who is aggressive and net-oriented , &quot; said No . 9 Todd Martin , whose biggest break was drawing the lower bracket . Since returning from knee surgery , Medvedev seems to have found a way to win . He has been exceptional in major clay-court tournaments , winning at Monte Carlo and Hamburg , Germany , and reaching the final in Estoril , Portugal . Medvedev , 19 , gained fame two years ago by reaching the fourth round in Paris , and advanced to the semifinals last year . Although Roland Garros ' red_clay is not suited to Sampras ' serve-and-volley game , opponents are finding him increasingly difficult on the slow surface . &quot; He thinks he ' s invincible now , &quot; Becker said . Sampras didn ' t start the year that way . In January at Doha , Qatar , he lost in the first round to No . 205-ranked Karim Alami of Morocco . Since then , he has lost only twice and added the Australian Open_to his titles at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open last summer . Although a victory in Paris will not be an official Grand_Slam because the four tournaments must be won in the same calendar_year , it is significant in that only two men -- Don Budge in 1938 and Rod Laver in 1962 and ' 69 -- have won four in a row . Sampras could be the first to do_it on three surfaces : grass ( Wimbledon ) , hard courts ( U.S. and Australian Opens ) and clay . When Sampras won in Rome last week , it was his first clay tournament in 11 months . He has won only two of his 27 titles on clay , and that has not given him much confidence . &quot; When I walk_out on clay , I feel a bit vulnerable , &quot; he said earlier this month . &quot; I wish I didn ' t feel that way , but that ' s the way I feel. &quot; That does little to foster confidence , yet he insists : &quot; I don ' t think it ' s self-defeating . It ' s reality. &quot; This also is reality : Sampras had won seven tournament titles and 29 consecutive matches until Saturday , when he lost to Michael Stich , 3-6 , 7-6 ( 9-7 ) , 6-2 , at the World Cup in Dusseldorf , Germany . &quot; I ' m trying not to be too consumed with everything , &quot; Sampras said last week in Rome . &quot; I ' m trying to stay relaxed and play my tennis , and not talk too_much and worry about ( the streak ) . &quot; Graf , who never seems to worry much , is seeking her second Grand_Slam . Her first came_in 1988 . Maureen Connolly ( 1953 ) and Margaret Court ( 1970 ) are the other women who have done_it . Graf is expected to win her third French Open title and 16th Grand_Slam tournament crown overall . She is 37-1 this year , her only loss coming_in the Hamburg final last month to No . 2 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain . The women ' s game is suffering from the absence of Monica Seles , still sidelined a year after being stabbed ; and Jennifer Capriati , who left the tour last August and was arrested in Florida last week for marijuana possession . Perhaps the return of Martina Navratilova to the_French Open for the first time since 1988 might help . She is making a farewell appearance here , and that alone makes_it an historical event .</TEXT>
