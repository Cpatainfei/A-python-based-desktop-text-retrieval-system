   <TEXT> Harvard law graduate Jennifer Harbury leaped across the widest of cultural divides when she married a Guatemalan guerrilla commander , a peasant who grew_up hungry and illiterate on a coffee plantation . But rather than turning_into a happily-ever-after tale , it has become a heartbreaker : Harbury has not heard from her husband , Efrain Bamaca Velasquez , since March 12 , 1992 , when he disappeared during a firefight with a Guatemalan Army_unit . Harbury says he ' s alive , and claims to have witnesses to prove it . To press her case , she has begun a hunger_strike in front of the National Palace in Guatemala , threatening to starve herself to death unless the Army owns up_to what she sees as a 2 1 / 2-year record of unbroken deceit . &quot; My life and the life of my husband . . . are in the hands of the Guatemalan Army , &quot; she said . The army says it never held him . &quot; If the army had any knowledge of Bamaca , we would have handed him over , &quot; said Gen . Mario Enriquez , the defense minister . It seemed for awhile that Bamaca , 37 , known by his nom_de_guerre , Commander Everardo , was yet another faceless victim of Guatemala ' s long and brutal civil_war . Thirty-three years of conflict have claimed more_than 100 # 000 lives , far more_than any other in the hemisphere over the past half-century . Guatemala has had three constitutionally elected civilian presidents since 1986 . None has been able to curb the military ' s pervasive influence , even Ramiro de Leon Carpio , who took_office last year with a spotless record as a foe of human_rights abuses . In Everardo ' s case , the Army maintains that it found a cadaver after the March , 1992 , battle and buried it in a nearby town with the inscription &quot; xxx &quot; -- unidentified . &quot; He was the only guerrilla member who disappeared in that battle , &quot; Harbury said in an interview before her recent return to Guatemala . &quot; So it had to be him , logically . Who else could it be ? &quot; She grieved his loss . Since the Army had a history of not taking prisoners , she assumed the worst . But the saga took a dramatic turn_in December , 1992 , when a guerrilla companion of Everardo named Santiago Cabrera Lopez escaped_from military detention with news that Everardo was alive , a war prisoner . Cabrera said Everardo had been tortured mercilessly . All of his toenails had fallen_out from beatings with posts . He had been hung_up on a rifle rack with his feet tied . But he survived . A second witness said he also saw Everardo alive . Harbury , 42 , is aware that Everardo and other guerrilla prisoners spotted by witnesses may have been killed by now . But she won ' t let such uncertainties deter her . After two years of fruitlessly bucking Guatemala ' s military bureaucracy for information , she launched her hunger_strike Oct . 11 . She insists that her husband be treated according to international_law , with access to medical_care , family members and human_rights monitors . If he isn ' t , she said , she will starve herself to death . Consuming only water sweetened with sugar , Harbury has been weathering wind , cold and torrential rains with only a thin piece of black plastic for cover . At night , she uses a sleeping bag . Police told her if she erected a tent , they would have to move her on . There is hardly anything conventional about the relationship between Harbury , the daughter of a professor father and an artist mother , and Everardo , who , despairing of his bleak surroundings as a teen-ager , joined a guerrilla unit and became one of his country ' s most wanted rebels . They met at the top of a volcano , of all places . Helped by guerrilla guides , Harbury made a six-hour , dead-of-night upward trek through the ghostly mists . And there at the top , protected by boulders , was the base of operations set_up by Everardo and his companions . Harbury , who was reared in Connecticut and now calls Texas home , took an interest during the 1980s in the hordes of desperate Central_Americans , including Guatemalans , who fled to South Texas to escape the civil_wars ravaging the isthmus . She went_to Guatemala in 1985 to document the abuses by the military and stayed for two years . She met Everardo after she returned to Guatemala in 1990 to write a book about the Guatemalan revolutionary movement . They married a year later . &quot; There are days when they ( her parents ) might wish that I married an insurance_agent , &quot; said Harbury , laughing_at the thought , escaping momentarily from her pain . She has sacrificed almost everything trying to obtain humane treatment for her husband . She has no job and little money . But she remains cheerful , never doubting that she is doing the right thing . Her romance with Everardo is about as startling as the events since his disappearance . While she was an undergraduate at Cornell a generation ago , he was living the life of a &quot; pack mule , &quot; hauling heavy sacks of coffee and other commodities in the dirt-poor southwest region of Guatemala . &quot; He just remembers going_out like a donkey for 13-14 hours a day and really being hungry for most of his life , &quot; said Harbury . He joined a local guerrilla movement on his 18th birthday , attracted by their emphasis on improving conditions for the 60 % indigenous population of Guatemala . His companions taught him how to read and write . He saw his first wife shot to death in an army ambush . His second wife was captured by the Army and tortured to death , Harbury said . &quot; He ' s a phenomenally intelligent person . It was just absolutely fascinating to talk to him . He didn ' t talk much . When he did talk , he would have something really thought_out and interesting , &quot; she said . &quot; What really attracted me is that he was just a very simple person , very humble . And here is a commander . . . . Everyone was supposed to accept him as an authority figure . He would n ' t let anybody salute him. &quot; Their life as a couple was brief . They lived together for a time in Mexico in 1991 when he was a delegate to peace talks with the Guatemalan Army . They were in Texas together in early 1992 when he was summoned back to Guatemala during a difficult period for his rebel colleagues . He disappeared shortly after his return . One attempt in 1992 at exhuming the remains of the man said to be Everardo was called_off . In August , 1993 , the remains finally were unearthed in Harbury ' s presence . She was handed a half-decomposed head and was asked_in Spanish : &quot; Is this your husband , Mrs . Bamaca ? &quot; She knew it was not , and her conclusion was confirmed by experts . Among her sparse belongings as she fasts is the last letter Everardo wrote to her , which reads in part : &quot; I would have liked so_much if you were with me and if you could have accompanied me to the front . . . . You do not know how much your love has carried me , your caring , your complete commitment during the days and moments we spent happily together. &quot; On the third day of her hunger_strike , she wrote her own letter , addressed to &quot; Friends &quot; in which she says that Guatemalans crowd around her and &quot; are enormously supportive . . . . They all tell me they lost family members , and tell me I am speaking_for thousands of others. &quot; Christena Colclough contributed to this story .</TEXT>
