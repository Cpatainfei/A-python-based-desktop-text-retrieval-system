   <HEADLINE> IT ' S NOT AFTER YOU ; EXPERTS SAY GREAT_WHITE_SHARK HAS BAD REPUTATION AS MAN-EATER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Great white_sharks are showing their teeth again off the coast of California . One struck fatally off Santa Barbara two weeks ago , attacking a diver while he searched for sea_urchins off San Miguel Island . Another was sighted last week feeding_on an elephant_seal between Newport Beach and Santa Catalina Island , only a_few thrusts of the tail from a coastline dotted with surfers . The event was photographed by a commercial fisherman . The media were alerted . &quot; The man-eater ' s estimated length was 18 to 20 feet and its estimated weight was over 5 # 000 pounds , &quot; said a news release sent_out by a saltwater tackle company . So , once again , great_white_sharks have been labeled man-eaters . It ' s a reputation the shark can ' t seem to shake , an image revived after every attack , after nearly every sighting . It ' s also a reputation , scientists say , that is unwarranted , one that stems from the ignorance of a public whose perception of the great white is one of a giant killing machine and nothing more . &quot; Being attacked by a great white is certainly a horrific thing , but it is an anomaly , &quot; Ken Goldman , 31 , an aquatic biologist at San Francisco ' s Steinhart Aquarium , said after the attack Dec . 9 that killed 42-year-old diver James Robinson of Santa Barbara . Goldman pointed_out that through 1993 , there have been only 76 confirmed attacks by great whites on humans since 1926 , and of those only seven resulted in fatalities . &quot; So being eaten by a white_shark is even more of an anomaly than being attacked , &quot; he said . Goldman , Scot Anderson and Peter Pyle have spent the last several years studying white_shark behavior off the Farallon Islands , a 211-acre grouping of steep , rocky islets rising from the Pacific_Ocean about 30 miles west of San Francisco ' s Golden Gate Bridge . The Farallons , part of a national wildlife refuge managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and watched_over by the Point Reyes Bird Observatory , are one of only a_few places in the world where the sharks can be studied in a natural setting , because they congregate around the islands every fall and stay until spring . &quot; I ' ve been going_out there since 1987 and the same sharks are there , &quot; said Anderson , 37 , a naturalist with the Oceanic Society and a seasonal park ranger for the Point Reyes Bird Observatory . &quot; It ' s like a party. &quot; Anderson is conducting a variety of experiments , but he is concentrating_on identifying and photo-cataloguing individual sharks , based on distinctive markings , in hopes of someday determining their migration habits . Nobody knows for_sure where the sharks come from or where they go each spring . One theory , based on captures and stillborn pups that have washed ashore , is that they spend spring and summer off the islands of Southern California and Baja . Anderson has yet to match any of the sharks at the Farallons with those captured or photographed elsewhere , but he has matched some of the sharks year after year at the islands . &quot; And I saw a shark eat a seal this year off Tomales Point ( near Point Reyes ) that we saw at the Farallons in ' 91 , so we know the same sharks go_to the mainland as well , &quot; he said . Goldman is basing a research paper on the thermo-physiology of the great white , but also on its swimming depths and movements around the islands . He has tagged and tracked several large sharks . Pyle , 37 , is the supervising biologist on the island , a bird specialist by trade -- the islands are home to 28 % of California ' s sea_birds -- but a shark expert based on his countless hours of observations . Since 1980 , he has spent six months a year watching from his perch atop Southeast Farallon Island , the largest of the chain and the only one where limited access is allowed . Besides helping by filming and cataloguing sharks when Anderson is not there , Pyle is studying the effects the weather and tides have_on shark behavior and gathering data that he hopes will someday be used to help determine population levels of great whites . Pyle believes there are 50 to 100 great whites that frequent the Farallons each spring . &quot; We think that with the data we ' re getting , we might some day be able to apply that to preventing attacks on surfers and such , &quot; Pyle said . &quot; We might even come_up with high-risk and low-risk times for humans. &quot; Among them , the three scientists have witnessed hundreds of attacks by white_sharks on pinnipeds -- the sea_lion family . And although the sharks are somewhat opportunistic -- Pyle has seen them feeding_on a blue_whale and a killer_whale carcass -- they are highly specialized hunters , almost exclusively targeting elephant_seals . Pyle theorized that in attacks on humans , the sharks might have mistaken their prey for seals . Robinson , for instance , was clad in a dark neoprene wet suit and diving in an area teeming with pinnipeds when he was attacked . Four species of pinnipeds frequent the Farallons -- northern elephant_seals , harbor_seals , California_sea_lions and stellar sea_lions , a federally &quot; threatened &quot; species . The animals spend much of their time on the rocks resting and socializing , but in coming and going they must pass_through what the scientists refer to as the &quot; high-risk zone , &quot; an area between 30 and 80 feet deep . There the sharks lurk like phantoms over the rocky bottom , blending in perfectly . &quot; You can ' t even see them , &quot; Anderson said . &quot; They can be only 10 feet down and you won ' t see them . There ' s no way of knowing one ' s there . It ' s spooky. &quot; The sea_lions seem to know when they ' re passing through the zone . They swim nervously until they ' re safely out of it . Pyle has seen fewer than a dozen attacks on sea_lions and harbor_seals . The elephant_seals , however , are slower , fatter and not as social as the sea_lions , and therefore not as fortunate . They are targeted seven times more often than other pinnipeds . Pyle said the sharks prefer to swim against the current and that most of the attacks occur at high_tide , probably in part because there is not as much haul-out space and more animals are forced into the water . At low_tide the attacks tend to occur farther offshore , perhaps an indication that the sharks require a good_deal of room to charge their prey . In any event , when an attack occurs , it is an awesome display of nature . &quot; The shark rushes up from below and grabs its prey and then thrashes it , and water flies , &quot; Anderson said . &quot; It tries to kill the animal on the first bite , then waits until it bleeds to death before it eats. &quot; The shark will sometimes wait an hour or more before moving_in and methodically plucking away at the mammal ' s flesh . And more often than not , another shark will come_in_for a_few bites . &quot; It appears as though they have a sort of pecking order , &quot; Goldman said . &quot; You never see two grab a seal at one time , but when one gets hit they are aware of it , either by sound or smell. &quot; To tag and track his sharks , Goldman uses a radio-telemetry device concealed in PVC pipe . The device is stuck_in a piece of meat and fed to the sharks while they feed_on their prey . The device has a life span of 100 days and Goldman can pick_up its signal , under good_conditions , from about half a mile away . Goldman said white_sharks , as far as he can tell , are not territorial , but added that the bigger animals seem to have certain areas where they prefer to hunt . He tracked his first shark in 1991 , a 14-foot male he named Boots . Boots was followed for five days over an eight-day period , swimming at an average depth of 50 feet . &quot; He had a_couple_of locations on the west_side of the island that he liked to hang_out in , and then he would take these treks from one to five kilometers from the island , &quot; Goldman said . &quot; He swam out and right back. &quot; A 17-footer named Ambergris was tagged last year and tracked for 10 days over a 17-day period . &quot; This shark had one major preferred spot ( off the southwest side of Southeast Farallon ) and he really liked that spot , &quot; Goldman said . &quot; He swam between 60 and 90 feet most of the time . He had a_couple_of other spots he visited , but he spent about 75 % of his time in that location . &quot; To me the most impressive thing is that these animals spend a lot of time stalking prey -- a week , two weeks , maybe three weeks or a month . Then after a meal they leave the island area , maybe for the season. &quot; There was Phoebis , a 12-foot male -- originally named Phoebe because it was first thought to be a female . Phoebis was tracked for seven days over a 10-day period . &quot; Phoebis went everywhere , &quot; Goldman said . &quot; He didn ' t have a favorite spot . It was like giving a child a crayon and letting him scribble on wall . He was all_over the place , 360 degrees around the island. &quot; Goldman said that through his work he has come_to view the great white not as a savage beast but as an animal , like any other , striving merely to survive . Scientists have already proved that they are not the cold-blooded killers people take them for . Unlike most fish , whose bodies are not much warmer than the water they swim in , great whites are considered warm-blooded or warm-bodied , maintaining a fairly constant body-core temperature of nearly 80 degrees . Said Anderson : &quot; I like to think_of the great_white_shark as a mammal-like fish that feeds_on fish-like mammals. &quot; The general public , however , might never share that opinion .</TEXT>
