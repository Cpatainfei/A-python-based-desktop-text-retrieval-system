   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA 1994 ; A VERY GOOD YEAR ; VINTAGE ' 94 HAS HAD FULL STADIUMS , WELL-PLAYED GAMES -- EVERYTHING BUT A SUPERTEAM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like a fine wine , the World Cup requires a little aging before it can truly be enjoyed . Trying to analyze what was good or bad about a tournament still in_progress serves little purpose . Impressions gathered over the course of a month need time to mature . Later , what seemed meaningful at the time might be regarded_as meaningless , and events that appeared inconsequential might take_on added significance . However , it is possible to tell a good year from a bad almost immediately , and already it is clear that 1994 has been a vintage World Cup , one that will be enjoyed in retrospect for years to come . That , at least , is the early consensus of the experts , those writers whose World Cup experience is counted , not in years but in decades . &quot; On the field , I think it ' s been one of the best for quite a long_time and certainly far better than in 1990 , &quot; said author , playwright and journalist Brian Glanville , who has covered all 10 tournaments since 1958 and whose book , &quot; The History of the World Cup , &quot; is widely regarded_as the definitive text on the event . &quot; The football has been much more open and immensely more entertaining than 1990 , which was horrific . Then , you really felt the end of the World Cup was nigh . &quot; At the same time , in a curious way , I think the tournament is going_to be won by default because I don ' t see any great teams , as evidenced by the fact that a team like Bulgaria , with all due respect_to it , can get as far as the semifinals ; and so can a team like Italy , which isn ' t a patch on the Italian teams of , say , 1978 and less still of 1982 . &quot; I don ' t see any great players , either , with the possible exception of Romario . It ' s a very diminished Brazil . . . . But when you ' ve got a player like Romario , anything is possible . He can win any game for you. &quot; Carlos Maranhao , executive editor of Vega , a weekly news magazine in Sao Paulo , Brazil , first attended a World Cup in West Germany in 1974 . This tournament , he said compares favorably to most that he has seen . &quot; In terms of the soccer , I think it ' s a very good World Cup with some very brilliant matches , like Bulgaria-Germany , like Brazil-Holland , like Romania-Argentina , &quot; he said . &quot; But you don ' t have at the moment a new king of football . This is bad . But it ' s better than Italy and , in my opinion , better also than Mexico in 1986 , but not as_good_as Spain in 1982. &quot; What has impressed Maranhao has been the fans . &quot; I think this is the most beautiful World Cup I have seen in terms of the participation of the public , &quot; he said . &quot; The stadiums are always full . They are not full with people who came from Germany or Brazil , but with Americans . This is because the U.S.A. is a country of great ethnic diversity . &quot; I think the match that most impressed me in this way was Ireland-Italy here in New Jersey . Most people supposed the Italians would fill the stadium , but there were about 70 % or 75 % of Irish fans who didn ' t come from Ireland . This is possible only in the United States. &quot; New York-based columnist Paul Gardner , author of &quot; The Simplest Game &quot; and a writer who has covered six World Cup tournaments , was one of many who doubted whether the United States could produce a proper World Cup atmosphere . He too has been pleasantly surprised by the fervor and involvement of American fans . &quot; The atmosphere in the stadiums has been fantastic , &quot; Gardner said . &quot; Going_into one of the stadiums , you could be in Rio or Milan or anywhere . There ' s been a lot of cheering , a lot of flavor , a lot of excitement and passion inside the stadiums and immediately around the stadiums . The party atmosphere has been terrific. &quot; One reason , of course , is that the quality of the soccer has been better than in quite some time . The success of the tournament always was going_to depend_on the attitude of the players , and they have come_through , despite the appalling temperatures at some games . &quot; I think it ' s been utterly disgraceful that players have been obliged to play in this heat , &quot; said Glanville , switching to his curmudgeonly mode . &quot; I think they ( the players ) have been totally heroic . It ' s wonderful the way they ' ve resisted physically . They are absolutely phenomenal . &quot; It was disgraceful to choose Orlando ( as a World Cup venue ) , knowing that they ' d have to play_at midday when it was going_to be filthy hot and vilely humid . And the ( Pontiac ) Silverdome was always a stupid idea . Pseudo-innovation , I suppose . The only thing you could say for it was that it wasn ' t any worse than playing outside . &quot; It ' s a disaster without air conditioning , and it was perverse to have to grow the grass in California and bring it out there . And for what ? So they played indoors ? Well , OK . Now let ' s forget about indoors. &quot; As uncomfortable and trying as the heat and humidity were , there were other factors that disturbed some World Cup reporters . &quot; I think overall it has been a good World Cup , &quot; said Andres Cavelier , correspondent for El Tiempo in Bogota , Colombia , &quot; but the nine venues are located too far away from each other , and it ' s difficult and expensive for the journalists and for the fans to go_to all_of these places and to get a feel_for a real_World Cup . &quot; Other_than that , the U.S. has shown the world that it could organize the World Cup . Four or five years ago , we were talking_about taking the World Cup away from the U.S. I was skeptical , as most ( overseas ) people were . &quot; I think most of the articles that we wrote in the last six months or a year were very critical of everything concerning soccer in the United States . We believed that the World Cup would not be as enjoyable and as much fun as others were , and that America wasn ' t ready for it. &quot; But the United States was ready and , with the help of a_few long-overdue rule changes , the tournament caught the public ' s imagination . David Miller , of the Times of London , has covered each of the tournaments since Sweden ' 58 and believes that USA ' 94 ranks among the more enjoyable . &quot; I think the tournament has been encouraging in a whole_lot of ways , &quot; he said . &quot; First , I think it ' s been encouraging for football . Belatedly , FIFA has tried to take steps to encourage inventive and creative play . This has resulted in some criticism of overreaction by referees , too many yellow cards and so on , ( but ) I think a swing of the pendulum was essential . &quot; With one or two exceptions , we ' ve had 20 years or more of defensive football at the expense of entertaining , spectacular football , which is the kind of thing that people want to see , that they pay money to come and watch . &quot; We ' ve had defensive football killing this and getting_away with it . Illegal tackling , illegal shirt-pulling and so on . Many , many kinds of subtle , specialist fouls . . . and referees not responding . &quot; In most World Cup matches that I ' ve seen , say in the last six World Cups -- having seen 10 -- I would have said without hesitation that there should have been at least one penalty in every match , sometimes two or three . And in most matches at least one person should have been sent_off , if the referee was interpreting the laws as they are written . That is , you get sent_off for a seriously aggressive foul or , much more important and more subtle , and it ' s within the laws , you get sent_off for persistent fouling . &quot; It ' s persistent fouling that kills the game . Your little niggling trips , pulls , obstructions and so on . All you ' re doing is trying to stop the other side playing . This is what ' s gone_on for 20 years . &quot; Now , we ' ve got the pendulum going the other way , and a_few people are screaming , notably , of course , the coaches , who don ' t like it because it ' s making life tough for them and they ' re going to have to think a bit harder . But I ' m glad to see the pendulum going that way. &quot; Gardner agrees . &quot; There have been more exciting games than there were in Italy , that ' s for_sure , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' ve had more goals . We have had more excitement . It would have been difficult to have had less . &quot; Maybe the FIFA rule changes have had something to do with that . Maybe the tackle-from-behind rule has put fear in defenders that maybe they shouldn ' t just mow people down from behind -- although , as far as I can see , the referees are not sending people off for it . &quot; The offside rule change has clearly helped . We ' ve seen goals scored , particularly Spain ' s first goal against Switzerland and Brazil ' s second goal against Sweden , where players in a passive offside position were not called . Play was allowed to flow . that ' s a huge plus , without a doubt . &quot; Some of the referees have been a bit overenthusiastic . Maybe we ' ve had too many yellow cards in some games . But on the whole I think that ' s been fairly acceptable . &quot; Yes , a good tournament on the field . An exceptional tournament ? No . Frankly , among the teams that are left I don ' t see an exceptional team . I really don ' t . That doesn ' t mean we can ' t have an exciting game . &quot; I think if Brazil is involved , we will. &quot;</TEXT>
