   <TEXT> On Oct . 9 , Robert Aronoff and Gerda Seifer wrote letters responding to my letter of Sept . 11 on the Schindler ' s List Tour . My letter responded to the assertion in the original article ( Aug . 21 ) that Poland was practicing anti-Semitism without Jews . My response was that there were hundreds of thousands of Jews in Poland and that they were in the mainstream of Polish life . It is a mystery to me how Poles turned_over 3.1 million Jews to the Germans , as Aronoff says , since they also seemed to have turned_over 3 million of themselves to the Nazi Germans for execution . As many Polish Christians as Polish Jews were murdered by the Nazis . The occupation of Poland was the most brutal in Europe and the very idea that the Poles collaborated with the Nazis is a lie . No people in Europe fought the Nazi German war machine as long and as heroically as the Poles . ARTUR ZYGMONT Torrance Both of these letters have a common_denominator . They are distorting the history and emanating the anti-Polish sentiment , and hate . The Germans killed 3 million Polish Gentiles ( in addition to ) 3.1 million Polish Jews , many in concentration_camps . Poland was the only country in which Nazis made aiding a Jew a capital_offense . Often the helping Pole ' s entire family or village was executed as well . Despite the enormous obstacles , the Polish record in rescuing Jews is one of the best in Europe . About 100 # 000 Jews who survived the war in Poland were helped by Poles and the clandestine Polish organization ZEGOTA . The revisionists would like to keep this part of history as a well-preserved secret and the media are helping them by committing Poles to the &quot; psychological holocaust. &quot; This disregard for a balanced and fair representation of Polish history cannot and should not be tolerated by the media . TED POLAK , Chair Polish American Congress , Polish American Defense Committee , Los Angeles Over 3 million Christian Poles died during this period , many thousands of them for assisting Jews . For Mr. Aronoff to say that Poles collaborated with the Nazis and for The Times to print it is beyond comprehension . ROBERT J . LISOWSKI Los Angeles I question The Times ' motive for publishing those anti-Polish letters in its Travel section . Would it possibly be to discourage tourism to Poland ? I spent World_War_II in Warsaw . As a young_girl , I participated in my family ' s efforts to help the Jews . . . . Several Jews were temporarily sheltered in our home , then taken_to other locations . Five lived with us until the Warsaw uprising in August , 1944 . When the uprising was crushed , we all went_into hiding , anticipating the arrival of the Soviet Army . In November , 1944 , one of the Jewish women we saved argued with a group of Jews and brought the Germans who then killed 18 people , including her nephew and her elderly sister . One man survived . He came at night to the place where I and 10 others were hiding , informed us of the tragedy and warned us of_our_own imminent danger , probably saving our lives . For us , and the Jews who passed_through our home , the greatest fear was that someone from the ghetto would betray . The names of Jewish traitors are a record in history books authored by Jews . The photos of Jews being pulled_out of their hidings in the ruins of the Warsaw ghetto are testimonials to such betrayals . No other people but their own Jewish acquaintances knew of those hidings . DANA I . ALVI Santa Monica I am appalled at the two letters . The Poles harbored thousands of Jews in churches , homes , on farms , and protected them at great risk to themselves . Does Aronoff know of whole towns that were executed because one Jew was harbored in a house in the town ? Aronoff should get the facts before condemning the Poles . Nowhere in his letter does he condemn the Germans , who were the culprits . I am of Polish descent and I served in World_War_II in Europe ( including Poland ) . STAN UFIER Fullerton</TEXT>
