   <HEADLINE> THE INTRICATE COURTSHIP OF TACO BELL ; RELOCATION : O.C. FIRM ' S REVIEW OF A NEW SITE TRIED THE NERVES AND PROVOKED THE TEMPERS OF POLITICIANS , EXECUTIVES AND ITS OWN EMPLOYEES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This was urgent , Controller Gray Davis insisted to Assembly Speaker Willie Brown . A conference_call had to be set_up as soon as possible . Yet another 1 # 000 jobs were about to leave California with the imminent announcement by Taco Bell Corp . that it was moving its Irvine headquarters to the north Dallas suburb of Plano , Tex . Yet another blow to California ' s image was about to land . Company executives still maintained that staying in Southern California was their preference -- if only state lawmakers would give them a sign that it made_sense to stick_around . Finally , there would be a sign -- actually , dollar_signs in the form of proposed tax_benefits . The conference_call March 25 by Davis , an ambitious state_capital veteran and champion political fund-raiser , and Brown , perhaps Sacramento ' s most powerful and controversial politician , would be critical in shaping legislation of immense symbolic importance . The conversation was frank . Company executives griped about city and toll-road development fees . Sorry , Brown said , the state couldn ' t do much about that . The businessmen complained about rules governing tax_credits for rebuilding in riot-torn areas of Los Angeles . That , Brown said , could be fixed . The effort to lure the Mexican-style fast-food chain away from the seemingly unbeatable attraction of Texas ' cheap land , cheap labor , low taxes and financial handouts had begun in_earnest . Before it was over , the company ' s slow , deliberate , exhausting review would try the nerves and provoke the tempers of political and business_leaders , builders and developers and its own employees , who seemed anything but eager to go_to a place like Plano . The decision process seemed to waver so_much -- local construction sites excluded promptly became sites reconsidered -- that one developer would confess to wondering &quot; who is driving the ship &quot; at Taco Bell . Appeals_to Taco Bell ' s corporate elite at times would take a personal , offbeat turn . Hank Adler , a partner at the Deloitte &amp; Touche accounting_firm in Costa Mesa , sent friend John E . Martin , Taco Bell ' s chief_executive , a missive every couple of days by fax . &quot; I threatened to sing , ' Stay , just a little bit longer , ' &quot; says Adler , breaking_into song at the recollection . &quot; I sent him the temperatures in Dallas when it ' s been real cold there. &quot; Through it all , Taco Bell may have been the ultimate poker player , hoping to wring every concession possible from builders , developers and politicians . And the poker_game doesn ' t seem over yet -- because real financial concessions from state and local_government have yet to materialize . Taco Bell decided three weeks ago to stay_put , but for just how long remains uncertain . Government and business_leaders assembled into an emergency &quot; red team &quot; eschew the term &quot; done deal &quot; when describing Taco Bell and say there ' s more work ahead . Martin last week , reserving the right to do whatever is &quot; best or most practical , &quot; noted the escape_hatches in the company ' s new office lease and didn ' t rule_out moving later to another state . But keeping Taco Bell , if even for a_few years until something permanent can be arranged , was an important battle victory . How California emerged on top is now viewed_as a lesson in waging what is certain to be a decades-long war between the states for prized assembly_lines , machine_shops , research labs and headquarters . A CHAT WITH THE GOVERNOR By March , Martin and his top aides already had spoken with the governors of Texas , Georgia and North Carolina , but efforts to get California Gov . Pete Wilson and Taco Bell ' s Martin together had proved futile . The state ' s red team was working with Taco Bell . But where , wondered executives , were California ' s top political_leaders ? Were they concerned ? Would they really do anything ? With a self-imposed March 31 deadline for announcing its relocation decision , executives became resigned to the likely move to Texas . But the red team had set a meeting for March 28 to give Taco Bell executives its final presentation on reasons to stay in California , and state economic aide Julie Meier Wright was working hard at setting_up a meeting between Wilson and Martin . On March 24 , Wright , who heads the state Trade and Commerce Agency , drove through a blustery arctic storm from San Diego to Taco Bell ' s Irvine headquarters for the long anticipated conversation . Traffic on local freeways was a stop-and-go nightmare . Volunteers eyed the fire-scarred Laguna hills for possible mudslides ; Malibu homes already were mired in muck . Inside the 12th-floor executive library , a quiet , windowless room with deep oversized leather chairs , artworks of glass , crystal and ceramics , paintings and bookcases filled with an eclectic array of books , Wright called Wilson while the company ' s top managers filed_in . For 45 minutes late that rainy afternoon , Wilson and Martin talked_about high costs in California and the state ' s attitude toward business . Martin and aides Charlie Rogers , Rudy Pollak and Jonathan Blum were impressed that Wilson had done his homework . The governor understood such local issues as development fees and air quality rules that required the company to provide inducements for employees to share rides to work . Wilson probed more deeply into the company ' s costs . Was Taco Bell simply paying more for top management and its creative talent , Wilson wanted to know , or were wages and salaries abnormally high throughout the organization , from executives on the top floor to food servers in the cafeteria on the bottom floor ? Martin assured him that costs were much higher throughout the work_force than they would be in Texas . And the Lone Star State , he noted , doesn ' t assess income_tax , so workers could move there and increase their take-home_pay without a wage hike . But the governor countered that property_taxes were lower here and the overall cost of doing business wasn ' t much different , especially if the company included the $ 40-million cost of relocating and the disruption to its operations . Wilson also noted the state ' s fiscal bind , making_it difficult to grant concessions to business . Martin told the governor that Taco Bell wasn ' t trying to squeeze the last dollar out of the people of California . If Taco Bell stays , Martin argued , it will mean more jobs , more taxes collected and more investment in the community . &quot; We ' re not really fighting each other here , &quot; Martin said . &quot; We ' re really trying to work with each other. &quot; MORE ENCOURAGEMENT FROM SACRAMENTO Controller Davis learned about Taco Bell ' s plans during a reception March 16 at Antonello ' s restaurant in Santa Ana . He spoke that night and the next day with Chris Townsend , a government relations executive at the company . After his staff and corporate officers talked further , Davis recognized the issues as universal concerns for business in the state -- and it was evident something would have to be done quickly . He called Willie Brown to set_up the conference_call for 10 a.m. Friday , the 25th . A Taco Bell group headed by Charlie Rogers , the senior_vice_president , assembled in the 12th-floor library . Davis was in his office . Brown was late . He had been taping his weekly television_show and couldn ' t get_back to his office in time . When he finally arrived_at 10:15 , he apologized and then , to the pleasant surprise of Rogers and his aides , devoted more_than an hour to a frank , businesslike discussion of Taco Bell ' s problems and what the state could and couldn ' t do . A new headquarters would cost nearly $ 100 million , executives said , and fees imposed by the city , a toll-road agency and others would run the bill up at least another $ 3.5 million . Brown was pessimistic . There was little , he said , that the state could do to get those fees waived . Rogers objected to laws governing tax_credits the company received for rebuilding stores in areas damaged by the 1992 Los Angeles riots . Not only were the credits applied to the earnings of Taco Bell ' s parent company , PepsiCo Inc. in Purchase , N.Y. , but they also were subject_to rules and conditions that made them all but useless . Now Brown could be optimistic . Changes could be adopted quickly , he suggested . Brown was upbeat and curious . What were Texas and the other states , he asked , doing about relocation programs , retraining efforts and educational_programs ? What were they doing with tax_credits ? Rogers , with a $ 10-million package of incentives offered by Texas , didn ' t need much more encouragement . He urged the assemblyman to advocate some kind of tax relief . Expanding companies , he rationalized , ought to get some tax_benefits for creating construction jobs , buying materials and furnishings and adding_to the property_tax rolls . Brown and Davis already had been working_on bills aimed at retaining business in California . Brown had a narrow bill giving credits to manufacturers that had passed the Assembly and was sitting in a Senate committee . Perhaps , he suggested , something could be added or changed in that bill . Davis said any tax_credits would have to come_with some obligation to stay in California , maintain job levels and add some value , such_as building a new office or buying new equipment . After all , Davis said , &quot; if the corporation isn ' t paying people , then the state is , &quot; referring to unemployment and welfare payments . Soon , Robert Girvin , Taco Bell tax director , and his staff were working by telephone and over facsimile_machines with Brown ' s aides and Davis ' legal department to go_over the language for a bill that would help growing companies . Aides to Brown and Davis came_up with the final proposal . For the first time , Taco Bell executives saw a breakthrough , a bipartisan effort by the Democratic Assembly leader and Republican governor to pass some meaningful pro-business laws . &quot; That call was pivotal , &quot; Rogers later told Davis . AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF POSITIVE ENERGY The following Monday , March 28 , the red team was encamped in a large conference_room at Irvine City_Hall . All morning , city officials , county staff_members , state workers and executives from regional agencies like the South Coast Air Quality Management District plotted strategy for their afternoon meeting with Taco Bell . Paul Reed , with the Irvine Unified School District , stopped by to explain the school lunch pilot_program the district was about to announce . Taco Bell didn ' t know it yet , but the district had agreed to let the company sell its food in Woodbridge High_School during May and June . It would be part of a plan to encourage students to remain on campus during lunchtime . Reed couldn ' t stay for the afternoon meeting with Taco Bell . But 22 red team members , led by H . Fred Mickelson , a Southern California Edison executive , were there to greet Rogers , Rudy Pollak and other corporate officers for the last and biggest red team meeting . Julie Wright of the Commerce and Trade Agency brought along her top regional aide , Judy Jarvis . Irvine Mayor Michael Ward , City_Manager Paul O . Brady Jr . and top aide Larry Larsen attended , as did Orange County Supervisor Thomas F . Riley , aide Ken Bruner and John Sibley of the county ' s Environmental Management Agency . Jim Wisley from Willie Brown ' s office rounded_out the bipartisan effort for the 90-minute session . &quot; There was an enormous amount of positive energy , &quot; Wright said later . &quot; There was a real appreciation on the part of Taco Bell executives that we were making_good progress. &quot; With a projector showing color photos and charts , Mickelson , Jarvis and Ward talked_about life in Southern California . They explained how they could help Taco Bell : fast processing of building_permits , training and education incentives , clearer rules on using the revitalization zone tax_credits , cooperation from air quality officials on the mandated ride-share plan for employees , support for any legislation offering tax_credits for expansion in California . Those were the carrots , and there was an effort to display a modest stick . Jarvis pointed_out that California and other government_agencies such_as school districts like to do business with companies located in the state . She raised the Irvine school district pilot_project . That was an important issue for Taco Bell , which now is in some 3 # 000 schools nationwide and wants to get_into thousands more . But much of the work already had been done the previous week . Mickelson had kept_in close contact with the governor ' s office and with Brown ' s office . The effort had been one of the most well-coordinated and complete attempts to woo a company heading for the exit . THE MOVING TARGET With Willie Brown drawing_up legislation to give large companies a 6 % tax_credit for investing in plants and people in California , Taco Bell executives renewed their search for another Orange County headquarters site . Some locations , like the Irvine Spectrum and a UC Irvine parcel , had long been considered . But new sites came_up as well , including Rancho Santa Margarita property and the now-vacant Loral Aeronutronics plant -- formerly Ford Aerospace -- in Newport Beach . At one point in mid-April , the Irvine Co . thought it was about to sign a deal with Taco Bell , but the fast-food chain started looking_at other sites . Developers were irked that Taco Bell often reconsidered sites that it had rejected earlier . The UCI site , for instance , was reconsidered at least three times . &quot; We ' ve danced through hoops on this thing , and you begin to wonder if there is a moving target and who is driving the ship over there , &quot; said one officer of a major developer who asked to remain anonymous . &quot; One thing ' s for_sure : They ' re not real_estate people. &quot; But Taco Bell executives were frustrated with the deals being offered . The recession may have hurt a lot of businesses , but landowners and builders still wanted a premium for building in the Golden State . Taco Bell was looking_for bargains and incentives , just as it had in its previous cross-country search for a new home . CALIFORNIA ' S TRIO OF CHALLENGERS Through John Cushman of Cushman Realty Corp . in Los Angeles , the company approached cities in Texas and Georgia last summer to see if they could meet its needs for open space with access to a major international airport . North Carolina was added_to potential sites after officials there learned about Taco Bell ' s search and asked to be considered . During the week of Nov . 1 , as fires ravaged the Southland , a Taco Bell team headed by administrative vice_president Pollak toured the three states . The team also included Cushman and architects David Gensler and Ed Friedrich . In Texas , the first stop , the financial allure was powerful . Taco Bell ' s sister company , Frito-Lay , already had moved its corporate headquarters to Legacy , a 2 # 665-acre business park in the fast-growing North Dallas suburb of Plano . And there was plenty of room for Taco Bell in the same complex . Last year , Taco Bell had consolidated some computer_operations there with Frito-Lay . Texas could deal like no other state . Besides its regular advantages -- no personal or corporate state income_taxes -- Texas could offer tax_credits , property_tax abatements and low-interest loans . Taco Bell ultimately would be offered $ 10 million in tax relief and training funds . In telephone_calls and letters , Texas ' tough but folksy governor , Ann Richards , sang the virtues of her state . But developers there were not certain Taco Bell would move . Some said they thought the trip east was mostly an effort to squeeze concessions out of California or the company ' s landlord . After two days in Texas , Pollak and his team flew to Georgia , where economic development officials were ready for courtship . Utility company executives , Atlanta and Georgia officials and business_leaders needed to find_out one thing first before they could start a full-fledged romance . Coke and Atlanta were almost synonymous , they noted , while Taco Bell was a unit of archrival PepsiCo . &quot; We wanted to know what they thought_about moving_into the land of Coca-Cola , &quot; said developer John Murphy . &quot; They addressed that , and it really wasn ' t an issue with them. &quot; Martin , it turned_out , was born in Atlanta and loved the area . In a welcoming breakfast , Gov . Zell Miller urged Taco Bell to keep an open mind about Georgia . Roy Cooper , vice_president for economic development at the Atlanta Chamber_of_Commerce , hammered home such Georgia virtues as &quot; stable and moderate &quot; taxes . &quot; Two-thirds of the population lives east of the Mississippi , &quot; he told the executives , &quot; and Atlanta is in the center of that market with unmatched livability , a world-class city and better access to Europe . We ' re as_good_as Dallas and better than L.A. &quot; Driving around Atlanta in a minibus to look_at sites , Taco Bell executives made time for a side trip . Pollak wanted to stop at a local Kroger grocery_store to see if it was carrying the new Taco Bell brand products -- including tortilla_chips , taco shells , salsa and cheese -- that the company was rolling_out as part of a cooperative effort with Frito-Lay . So thrilled were executives to see the products on the shelves that architect Friedrich took pictures . But in early March , the company sent its regrets to Georgia . The location , building costs and relocation costs proved to be too_much . North Carolina has been recruiting California companies for 15 years and set_up a permanent office in the Bay Area last fall . Martin , who once worked for the Hardee ' s fast-food chain in Raleigh , thought the Carolinas would be a great place for Taco Bell . While Pollak ' s group was in Charlotte looking_at sites , North Carolina Gov . James B . Hunt Jr . was in California , and he stopped in at Taco Bell headquarters for a brief chat-cum-sales pitch . North Carolina and Charlotte promised to put_in roads or any other infrastructure that might be needed . The state couldn ' t get_into a bidding war , but it could offer $ 1 # 000 for each new job to make capital improvements . Like other states , it also offered tax_credits for training . Hunt also had a $ 5-million competitive recruitment fund he could use at his discretion to bring_in companies . The hitch , though , was that Charlotte would have to come_up with a matching amount , and it was able to provide only $ 500 # 000 . The total , though , paled in comparison with what a state like Texas could do . Charlotte was scratched from the list at_the_same_time as Atlanta . NO PLACE LIKE HOME To John Martin , the numbers only told one side of the story . He describes business as both a science and an art , with the art too often ignored . California , he observes , still offers more energy and creativity , a greater degree of racial and ethnic diversity and a closer view of the expanding Asian market than any other state . So when Willie Brown ' s tax_credit measure was narrowly defeated in May , Martin took a longer view . Since his company ' s needs were evolving , he decided that a new lease -- a flexible one that offered the company a chance to cancel it early -- would most benefit the company . The landlord , Shuwa Investments Corp. , had offered most of the basic terms of a new lease last August , part of its strategy to take its best shot first . But back then , Taco Bell executives had only started looking_at other states and didn ' t know what they wanted to do . They used the offer as a benchmark to compare alternatives . By May of this year , Martin was ready to negotiate in_earnest , and he told Rogers and Pollak to build flexibility into the new lease . When the deal is ready , he told them , call me in Hawaii . Martin and his girlfriend of two years , Stefanie Mayer , 28 , flew to the island of Hawaii on June 4 for a two-week vacation . They also were married June 16 in a ceremony at Mauna Lani Point resort north of the Kona coast . It was the third marriage for Martin , 48 . The final deal was struck in quick fashion with little haggling but enormous amounts of lawyer time to draw_up a lease that ran 70 legal-size pages long , without attachments . &quot; The building is part of a larger project , Koll Center Irvine North , and there are many documents on file that affect how Taco Bell can use its building , &quot; Shuwa attorney Anton N . Natsis explained to his counterparts . &quot; We need to read about 20 documents to understand how to put this lease together. &quot; Pollak and Shuwa ' s Chris Mahon found they could agree quickly to some new terms , but putting it all on paper was another matter . Learning that one change would take a week to review and write , Pollak ' s jaw dropped_in disbelief . Shuwa still ended_up with the $ 41-million deal it had offered 10 months earlier , but it agreed to other changes , including Taco Bell ' s right to cancel the deal in the fifth and 10th years by paying a fee of up_to $ 3 million . Shuwa also agreed to pay_up to $ 4.1 million for tenant improvements . Rent was cut from $ 2.85 a square_foot , negotiated during the high-priced 1980s , to $ 1.50 a square_foot , about the middle of the market range today . Just after Martin and Mayer were married , Pollak called him in Hawaii to report that the company got the flexible lease it wanted . &quot; we ' ll do the deal as soon as I get home , &quot; Martin told him , &quot; and we ' ll announce it. &quot; IT ' S NOT OVER ' TIL IT ' S OVER Taco Bell ' s long search provided it with a great_deal of information as it ponders what to do_in the future . If could take_up an offer by the Koll Co . to build a structure next to its current quarters or it could follow_up_on any one of the proposals it received to build elsewhere in Orange County or in Texas . Assembly Leader Brown ' s legislative effort is expected to be resurrected next month with a state Senate bill sponsored by Sen . Bill Lockyer ( D-Hayward ) . Controller Davis says California has much more to do to compete with such aggressive states as Texas . Meanwhile , to judge from his comments last week , Martin aims to keep California nervous . &quot; If the climate in California were to go south from a business perspective , &quot; he warned , &quot; then we ' d look_at our other options. &quot;</TEXT>
