   <HEADLINE> ENVIRONMENTALISTS SEE SAFE WATER ACT AS CLINTON TEST ; LEGISLATION : ACTIVISTS SAY THE PRESIDENT ' S ACTIONS ON THE MEASURE WILL DETERMINE THEIR FUTURE RELATIONSHIP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Safe Drinking Water Act -- an arcane environmental law trickling through the legislative process on Capitol_Hill -- would not seem the sort of measure that could color a President ' s political future . And yet , with Congress slated to begin debate on the bill next week , the nation ' s principal environmental organizations are making the water act the bellwether of their future relations with President Clinton . If in the coming weeks the President joins their fight to protect water quality standards from compromises sought by many states and local water management agencies , environmentalists say that their relations with the Administration -- which got_off to a rocky start -- will be amicable . They reason that , after retreating in the face of opposition on so many of their cherished initiatives , Clinton will have drawn_a_line in the sand by taking a stand_for the bill . A tough White_House posture would scare opponents , rally environmentalists and set a new tone for a welter of environmental legislation to follow . But if , in their eyes , the President ducks the fight and allows Congress to lower drinking_water standards , environmentalists say the future of relations may be irreparably harmed . And that , in turn , could prompt the nation ' s green groups to sit_out Clinton ' s reelection campaign , as well as a_few races that are seen as important to his fate -- like California ' s gubernatorial race . How did_it come_to this ? It is a measure of the current ferment in relations between the Clinton_Administration and the environmental community that the reauthorization of an obscure law like the Safe Drinking Water Act has become a potential turning point for the nation ' s environmentalists . With nearly a dozen major pieces of environmental legislation on the congressional docket , green groups are reassessing the state of their relations with the Administration , as well as the political strategies they have pursued since Clinton entered the Oval Office promising a new era in environmental policy . &quot; There ' s a lot of disappointment on both sides , because neither side has done what it really should have done , &quot; said Carl Pope , executive_director of the 500 # 000-member Sierra Club . &quot; We environmentalists have not been_on the agenda : We kind of assumed there was a basic level of support -- which there wasn ' t -- and that the Administration was in the driver ' s seat with_regard_to Congress -- which it ' s not . &quot; And we were naive , &quot; added Pope in an admission increasingly heard from environmentalists . &quot; We didn ' t go_out to the hustings to organize political support and pressure for our agenda . Many organizations still think you can go_to Washington and get_it all done . And you can ' t. &quot; After 12 years of Republican administrations , when environmentalists found the White_House door virtually closed to them , the first year of the Clinton_Administration brought them access to the President and personnel appointments that surpassed their fondest hopes . And yet , said Jim Maddy , executive_director of the League of Conservation Voters , there is a &quot; broadly felt sense &quot; among the green groups that the Clinton_Administration ' s rhetorical embrace of their causes has not translated into clear policy victories . &quot; It ' s a whole_lot better than nothing , &quot; said Maddy of the Administration ' s first-year environmental efforts . But , he groused , &quot; it wasn ' t a good start. &quot; That year began when Clinton , facing a storm of Senate opposition , withdrew a proposal to raise fees charged to ranchers for grazing their livestock on federal lands -- a hike that had been hailed by the green groups . That pattern continued when Clinton backed_down on imposing a broad-gauged energy tax sought by environmentalists after congressional critics balked . On issues as varied as pesticide reform , greenhouse gas reduction and a plan to clean_up the Everglades , environmentalists lament that the Administration has reached for politically expedient compromises that pose risks to the environment and public health . Frustration over the Administration ' s record led Maddy ' s group in early February to issue Clinton an environmental report_card with a decidedly lackluster grade of C-plus . Clinton was stung by the mark , according to several senior Administration officials . &quot; It hurt , &quot; said one frustrated aide in a leading environmental slot . &quot; It hurt everybody &quot; inside and out of the Administration , the official added . In the Administration ' s defense , officials pointed to the environmental stature of its appointees , the ambition of Clinton ' s agenda and the access and consideration accorded to green groups in Administration deliberations . But they also complained of the environmentalists ' &quot; overly optimistic view of what could be accomplished &quot; and the depth of opposition many of the measures have encountered on Capitol_Hill . The coming months , Pope said , will be crucial in shaping the Administration ' s long-term relationship with environmentalists . &quot; I do not believe that the disappointment has yet moved to alienation , &quot; Pope said . &quot; It could , if it doesn ' t get better in the next six months. &quot; It is no coincidence that the next six months also will be a pivotal time for an array of environmental initiatives in which the Administration will play a key role . The Safe Drinking Water Act is only one of almost a dozen bills making their tortuous way through Congress . That act would lay out new standards for the purity of tap_water -- an environmental and public health issue on which green groups see the potential for a groundswell of popular support . Citing the expense of screening for many of the water-contaminants now regulated by the federal_government , local water-management agencies and the National Governors ' Assn . are arguing for a relaxation of some of the standards . At the same time , environmentalists are seeking tougher standards for certain contaminants that pose special dangers to children and pregnant women . Draft House and Senate bills differ , and environmentalists fear that nothing short of a high-level intervention by the Administration will head_off changes to the safe water act that they charge could cause public health risks . Other pieces of legislation range from overhaul of the Superfund toxic_waste cleanup program to mining reform and tougher regulation of agricultural chemicals . Virtually all_the initiatives face opposition from a loose coalition of well-funded and well-organized special_interests determined to slow what they see as the relentless march of environmental regulation . Among them are groups dedicated to upholding private-property rights , heading_off unfunded federal mandates and protecting the financial stakes of industries that could face stricter regulation under the new laws . The White_House ' s response , in the environmentalists ' view , has been consistent and disappointing . Frequently citing the need to jump start a stalled political process , the White_House has brokered one compromise after another with the opponents of its environmental initiatives . As they have done so , the environmentalists ' initial wave of almost giddy excitement has turned_to disillusionment . &quot; Both Clinton and ( Vice_President Al ) Gore have hired people in important positions who have the exact right instincts , &quot; said Jane Perkins , president of Friends of the Earth . &quot; The problem is that this Administration is driven by politics , not instincts . And politics is compromise . While we have a meeting of spirit and ideals , these initiatives are not playing_out to produce measures that we can support. &quot; The resulting disappointment has prompted environmentalists to rethink their strategy of relying_on Congress and the Administration to deliver the measures they hold so dear . Instead , they are hoping to rebuild their political clout -- not in Washington , where they have reaped modest results in recent months , but at the local level , where the environmental movement first gained its strength and momentum . &quot; We know now that we need a new path . We know our current strategy is not working -- we ' re not winning , &quot; said Jon Roush , president of the Wilderness Society . &quot; We ' ve dropped the ball . We ' ve forgotten about grass-roots . And we need to address that. &quot; Complained one Administration environmentalist who welcomes the new strategy : &quot; The crowd . . . fighting this legislation is out_in the hustings organizing acre-by-acre , while the environmentalists are jostling to get_into pictures with Al Gore . There is no power in Washington unless you can deliver back home , and that ' s what the environmental community needs to remember. &quot; Rep . George Miller , ( D-Martinez ) , who has pressed the environmentalists to refocus their political efforts , said that the shift &quot; will take muscle , organization , someone going_to town_halls and raising these issues to put them on the agenda back home. &quot; This will be an especially challenging time to pursue that strategy , since membership in environmental groups has been sliding for several years . At the same time , opinion polls indicate that Americans ' sense of urgency about environmental issues has lessened . By 1993 , just over one-fifth of Americans surveyed in a poll conducted by the Roper Organization identified themselves as active environmentalists , down from 29 % the year before . Americans ' demand for further regulation was down , the poll found . And in a 1993 Harris poll , the number of respondents saying this country should be doing more to protect the environment dropped from a high of 97 % in 1988 to 82 % in 1993 . The renewed grass-roots strategy , environmentalists said , is designed to achieve two related objectives : provide a counterweight to the growing political voice of groups seeking to slow and reverse environmental legislation and , more important , to convince the Administration and many lawmakers that environmentalists are a political force to be respected and feared , not just admired and stroked and invited to the White_House . If the grass-roots efforts can do that , environmental strategists said , then Clinton and Capitol_Hill lawmakers will think_twice before rolling_over on initiatives important to the green groups . Conversely , if politicians fight for environmental causes , the grass-roots will come_out and fight for them at election time . And if they do roll_over , the grass-roots will withhold their contributions , their organizational help and their votes . For all_the threat that such a strategy implies , environmentalists within the Administration said they would welcome a political revival of the greens in the hustings . Several officials said that in negotiations , grass-roots pressure would help strengthen the hand of an Administration that has been battered by opposition to so many of its environmental initiatives . &quot; We ' re all for that , &quot; said one Administration strategist of the environmentalists ' back-to-the-grass-roots strategy . &quot; Clearly the other side is_better organized out there right now &quot; than are the environmentalists . Those opposing much of Clinton ' s environmental reform &quot; are well-funded and organized and they really let us know what they ' re thinking . Having a grass-roots constituency telling Congress that those are bad ideas would really help. &quot; Added Perkins of Friends of the Earth : &quot; There was this feeling that maybe we could ' just let Al ( Gore ) do it. ' Well , there ' s a growing realization that Al needs help. &quot;</TEXT>
