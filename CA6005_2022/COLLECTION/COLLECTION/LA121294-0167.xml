   <HEADLINE> PACT SHOULD BENEFIT BIG INDUSTRIES IN STATE ; SUMMIT : GAINS IN TECHNOLOGY TRADE EXPECTED , BUT AGRICULTURE COULD SUFFER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California ' s high-technology , energy and medical industries should be big winners if hemispheric free_trade agreement set_in_motion Sunday by President Clinton and 33 other leaders at the Summit of the Americas in Miami comes_to pass , but the states ' agricultural and manufacturing sectors might be among the losers . Economists said the proposed agreement , which would eliminate tariffs and other barriers to trade among all_the nation ' s of North and South_America , would generally benefit U.S. industries that enjoy a clear technological advantage : Semiconductor makers and software companies would likely see huge markets opening . Any expansion of trade engendered by a new free-trade deal would also benefit the state ' s transportation industry , notably its ports . Santa Fe Pacific Corp. , for example , said its port facilities in San Diego and Los Angeles would see a significant increase in ship container traffic from hemispheric free_trade . But industries that depend_on low-cost , unskilled labor are in jeopardy , because there is no way they can compete with farms and factories staffed by impoverished Latin_American workers , economists said . Although any hemispheric free-trade deal is at least a decade away , California ' s economy could feel the pinch much sooner if Chile gains quick admission to the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , as proposed on Sunday . Chile is a big producer of table grapes and wine , which , if allowed to enter duty-free , could cause economic dyspepsia for the state ' s vintners and growers . &quot; Grape , avocado and tree crops growers -- those are some at-risk areas , &quot; said Ross Starr , a UC San Diego economics professor . The state ' s citrus industry , for one , would face increased pressure from Brazil , whose massive orange_juice concentrate industry now has only limited access to U.S. markets . California could also face major problems as a result of the recent passage of Prop . 187 , according Peter H . Smith , a political_science professor and director of Latin_American studies at UC San Diego . The proposition , designed to deny illegal immigrants access to education and health_care services , has created the perception among many South_American_nations that &quot; California is hostile to Latin_America , &quot; Smith said . &quot; It ' s a mistake to think that Prop . 187 is only going_to affect our relationship with Mexico , &quot; Smith added . &quot; Although the law may be tied_up in court , the political damage has been done. &quot; A Western_Hemisphere free-trade zone would differ from other trading blocs such_as the European Union in that it would join countries at very different levels of economic development , Starr said . &quot; The danger in such an agreement is that we put at risk the wage levels of low-skilled American workers. &quot; . Nora Lustig , senior fellow for policy studies at Brookings Institution in Washington , D.C. , said the benefits of increased trade go beyond considerations of winners and losers and provides a &quot; net gain overall &quot; that benefits everyone , as evidenced by better-than-projected gains of member countries of the European Union and NAFTA .</TEXT>
