   <HEADLINE> RUSSIANS LEAVE GERMANY MINUS FOND FAREWELLS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How do you say &quot; bum ' s rush &quot; in German ? The approximate translation is a deplorable seven syllables long , but no matter . The expression has been vividly played_out all around greater Berlin this spring and early summer , in the final act of the great piece of theater known as the end of the Cold_War : Germany ' s back-of-the-hand farewell to the Russians . Half a century ago , it was the Red Army that captured Berlin from its Nazi defenders , virtually single-handedly , at a cost of more_than 300 # 000 Soviet lives . British and American troops counted for little in the final three weeks of fighting for Hitler ' s capital ; the whole of the bloody street-to-street fighting fell to the Soviets . To this day , the bodies of 20 # 000 Soviet soldiers lie buried within the Berlin city_limits , and tens of thousands more rest in 525 Red Army cemeteries in the surrounding countryside . Ask a German today whether the fall of Berlin marked a defeat or a liberation for Germany , and he or she will almost certainly call it a liberation . Polls show again and again that Germans are glad their side lost the war , and that virtually no one would have wanted to live_in Germany had Hitler ' s National_Socialists prevailed . But you would never know the Germans were grateful to judge by the way they are showing the door to their erstwhile liberators . The Russians kept 339 # 000 troops , along with 211 # 000 dependents and civilian support personnel , in East_Germany during the Cold_War . By comparison , the Western Allies committed token occupation forces to West_Berlin : about 12 # 000 Americans , British and French . Now that all_of these occupation forces are going_home , the_French , Americans and British have been repeatedly feted with parades , fireworks , barbecues and assorted other merriments . The French even saw fit to hand_out baguettes and bottles of wine as their tanks rolled by in one parade earlier in the spring . And on June 18 , they joined the Americans and British in marching in review down the Strasse des Siebzehnten Juni , one of Berlin ' s grandest and most historic thoroughfares , before an estimated 75 # 000 respectful Berliners . Meanwhile , here are the Russians , holding their farewell party amid the weed-choked window_boxes and cracked pavements of Wuensdorf , a tumbledown military base an hour ' s drive_out of Berlin . Instead of appreciative thousands at the curbside , there were only fellow Russian dependents watching , and some curious German onlookers invited in from nearby villages . &quot; This is not good , &quot; says Dmitri Suchorukov , a Russian private who has come_out for the festivities and is milling_around the wurst stand with his buddies . &quot; Both of our grandfathers died fighting Germany , &quot; adds Marina Jatchmeniova , a Red Army nurse who is queuing for a snack with a girlfriend . &quot; My mother was born in 1944 , and she never even saw her father . No one knows where he was buried. &quot; &quot; We think the ceremonies for all_the Allies should be together , &quot; says Suchorukov . But it might have been even worse . Earlier this year , the German government had planned to give the Russians their send-off in Weimar , 150 miles southwest of Berlin -- a town that was , in fact , captured not by the Soviets but by American troops at the end of World_War_II . Russia ' s top commander in Germany , Gen . Matvei Burlakov , rebelled at this historical snub in an angry news_conference -- and a_few days later , the Germans said the Russians could march in Berlin after all . But only in an outlying suburb . And not with the other Allies . The Russians held their parade Saturday in the eastern part of Berlin . &quot; Live well Germany , homeland here we come , &quot; sang the 1 # 500 soldiers of the elite 6th Motorized Defense Brigade , based in Karlshorst . About 40 armored vehicles took_part in the parade past about 30 # 000 Germans , a much smaller crowd than turned_out for the Allies . &quot; The West is the winner , the East is the loser -- that is how everything is done_in Germany , &quot; says Lothar Bisky , chairman of this country ' s Party of Democratic Socialism , the successor to the former East_German Communist_Party . &quot; The Cold_War never ends. &quot; The humbling of the once-great Red Army doesn ' t stop at chintzy farewell parties and poorly attended parades in the middle of nowhere . All over what used to be East_Germany , symbols of Russian valor and might are disappearing . Monuments have been taken_down , streets are being renamed , and even the late Russian general who governed Berlin for a_few months after V-E Day has been posthumously stripped of his honorary citizenship . Then there are the revisionist goings-on at the Museum to the Unconditional Surrender , a Berlin institution dedicated to the Red Army victory over fascism . It has been housed since 1966 in the building where the formal instruments of surrender were signed by German and Allied officers in the spring of 1945 , and which was subsequently used as a kind of martial-law city_hall by East Berlin ' s early Soviet overlords . For 28 years , the Museum of the Unconditional Surrender has been an unabashed shrine to Red Army valor . Fourteen rooms have been filled with busts of Russian officers , photographs of Russian troops and combat maps bearing Cyrillic legends . The workroom of Marshal Georgi Zhukov , the Soviet commander who led the assault on Berlin , has been left untouched ; his uniform , now a bit faded , still hangs_in a glass case . By the front_entrance stands a Russian tank , with the inscription , &quot; For my homeland. &quot; Now , however , with fewer than 7 # 000 Russian troops left in Germany and those scheduled to be gone_by Aug . 31 , the museum has been closed for a complete overhaul . Inside , a team of German historians and their assistants has been taking_apart the exhibits and packing the pieces off to a warehouse . When the museum reopens under German management next year , the entire concept will be different . Instead of Red Army heroism in 1945 , it will showcase German-Russian relations over 75 years . &quot; The old exhibit focused mainly on the war , &quot; confirms Viktor Gorynia of the German Historical Museum , who is overseeing the renovations . &quot; Now , we want to cover the whole period from 1917 to the 1990s. &quot; Instead of telling the story of the Russian ground-pounder , the place will present both Russian and German points_of_view , and document the sufferings of soldiers and civilians of each belligerent , he says . There will even be a room given over to the three other Allied nations . All of this goes_down poorly with some of the young , white-gloved aides who are dismantling the Russian exhibit under Gorynia ' s supervision . &quot; I ' m packing these items away , and they ' ll go_into storage , and then they will never come_back , &quot; complains Stephan Boehmer , who is wrapping historic black-and-white photos in tissue_paper and packing them into cardboard boxes . He reaches_into a box and pulls_out a photo of a German bone-grinding machine -- a piece of concentration-camp hardware designed by Nazi authorities to turn the evidence of mass_murder into fertilizer . &quot; This picture will never come_back &quot; when the museum reopens , says Boehmer . &quot; In a certain sense , I think you could say we are rewriting history . But I believe that a monument is a monument , representing a certain time in history . This museum should stay as it is. &quot; Few Germans -- particularly Germans in what used to be the West -- would share Boehmer ' s sympathy for the Russians ' current plight . Having watched their Western keepers prevail in the long-fought ideological contest with Moscow , Germans are in_general reluctant to cling_to the least reminder that the Soviets won the military struggle . No one here can forget that it was the Soviets , after all , who followed up their 1945 liberation with the 1948 blockade of Berlin . Or that it was the Soviets , in the summer of 1953 , who sent tanks into Berlin to brutally put_down an East_German construction workers ' uprising . Or that it was the Soviets who approved construction of the Berlin Wall , and who , in_general , served as the puppeteers behind the East_German regime . &quot; The five years since the fall of the Berlin Wall do not cancel_out the 45 years that went before , &quot; says Joachim Thies , foreign editor of the newspaper Die Welt , and a conservative authority on international affairs . &quot; The Russians were oppressors . As individuals , they are poor people , and they must certainly feel very miserable now . But for me , they are still the representatives of the oppressors , and they will be until the last moment. &quot; Compounding the brutality of Russian domination stirring in the German mind has also been the shock here over the condition of the Russian bases in what used to be East_Germany . After the pullout began , incoming Germans found a running series of pocket disasters on the lands managed by the Red Army : unexploded ordnance scattered about , drums of hazardous chemicals tilting in stream beds , rusted-out vehicles left in the woods and meadows . Even the barracks and dependents ' housing was filthy , and in some cases the departing troops had ripped_out faucets and other fixtures to take_back to Russia with them . For many Germans , this is but another reinforcement of their long-held stereotype about the Russians : that they are scarcely more_than barbarians , an army that raped its way westward in 1945 and never reformed . &quot; The Russians committed atrocities even in the countries that did not attack them , &quot; says Thies . &quot; I would hate to whitewash this difficult relationship . We Germans were , with good reason , excluded from the ( D-day commemoration ceremonies on ) Omaha Beach , and the Russians were , with good reason , excluded from the Allied joint ceremonies in Berlin. &quot; However unwilling mainstream Germans may have been to come witness them , the Russian farewell activities in Wuensdorf were , in fact , stirring and well orchestrated . The ground rumbled as Warsaw Pact tanks and armored personnel_carriers went rolling_down Wuensdorf ' s narrow asphalt lanes . Helicopters with large red stars on their undercarriages flashed by overhead at treetop level . On the reviewing stand , Gen . Burlakov wept openly into his handkerchief . &quot; The Russian military leadership has helped us make our way to the new Germany , &quot; the governor of the state of Brandenburg , Manfred Stolpe , said in his goodby speech . &quot; Keep us in your memory . We have been friends , and we will stay friends. &quot; &quot; This was going too far , &quot; Joachim Thies said of Stolpe ' s remarks in an interview afterward . &quot; You can ' t say , ' Now we have lost friends ! ' I am a bit ashamed of this country . How can one so mix_up liberators and oppressors ? &quot;</TEXT>
