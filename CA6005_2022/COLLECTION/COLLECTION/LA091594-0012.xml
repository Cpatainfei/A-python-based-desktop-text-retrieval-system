   <HEADLINE> MR . PRESIDENT -- IS THIS REALLY WHAT AMERICA WANTS TO DO ? ; A HAITI INVASION ALONE HARDLY MAKES_SENSE ; A TOUGH SELL FOR CLINTON TONIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton will address the nation tonight on a possible U.S. invasion of Haiti . As in the past when a commitment of military power appeared imminent , the President can no doubt count_on the initial support of the American people , who at such times instinctively rally behind both the commander_in_chief and the men and women he is putting_in harm ' s way . But in the case of Haiti , Clinton has a special obligation to be candid and forceful in discussing why such a profoundly serious step -- one involving the almost inevitable loss of lives among U.S. military_personnel and the Haitians who engage them -- is necessary . For , as Wednesday ' s Senate debate on Haiti clearly showed , there is great doubt regarding not just the need for U.S. military_action but the very wisdom of trying to impose any coercive resolution to Haiti ' s long political crisis . A good argument can be made_for using force to oust the military junta in Port-au-Prince . Its members are an extremely unpleasant lot who three years ago arrested and exiled the first popularly elected president in the nation ' s history , Jean-Bertrand Aristide . Since then they have resisted U.N. efforts to restore Aristide that used both the carrot of diplomacy and the stick of economic sanctions . A year ago the junta even went so far as_to sign and then arrogantly reject a U.N. agreement for Aristide to return . In the meantime the junta has harshly suppressed the Haitian people , killing hundreds and driving thousands more into desperate exile in the United States and elsewhere . The best argument Clinton has for using U.S. power to restore Aristide is the fact that during the nine months the former Roman_Catholic priest was in the presidency the flow of illegal immigrants from Haiti to the United States declined . That is no small achievement , especially when viewed from states like California and Florida that feel the impact of illegal immigration most directly . So while Aristide may be a controversial figure in the United States , he was so popular in Haiti that he was elected with more_than 67 % of the vote and was so admired that he inspired many poor Haitians to stay home rather than flee abroad . While Aristide clearly should be returned to the presidency to which he was honestly and openly elected , the tougher question facing Clinton would be how to keep Aristide in power once U.S. military_forces achieved the initial objective of defeating the junta . No serious military analyst doubts U.S. forces could easily overwhelm Haiti ' s military . And while U.S. casualties of any number would be painful , most experts believe they would be light . The real military challenge that Haiti poses is what to do once we ' re there . In other words , getting_in would be relatively easy ; getting_out may be hard . Clinton must_not forget that the last time U.S. troops intervened in a Haitian political crisis , in 1915 , they wound_up staying for 19 years . And 60 years after the last U.S. troops left Haiti there is precious little evidence the troubled nation is better_off for that U.S. intervention . It is possible , of course , that all_the invasion preparations are a bluff -- aimed at pushing the junta ' s leaders into fleeing to exile like other Caribbean dictators before them . If so , we fervently hope it works . But before any fighting begins , the Administration should explain what U.S. forces would do once the violence ended . What plan , for instance , does_it have to assist Aristide in nation-building once he is restored ? The only real guarantee the American public will have that U.S. troops won ' t have to intervene in Haiti again , sometime in the next century , is for that nation to be transformed from the poorest country in the Western_Hemisphere to a stable democracy with a modicum of prosperity for its people . that ' s a much tougher task than defeating a ragtag army . An invasion per se is doable -- and maybe even justifiable , but it is hard to see how it would solve Haiti ' s deep political and economic problems . In the final analysis , President Clinton needs to lay out a far more convincing long-range game_plan than he has to date .</TEXT>
