   <HEADLINE> GOOD COOKING : SUMMER HERBS ; FRESH HERBS : THE MAGIC SPRIG</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fresh herbs are available in supermarket produce sections throughout the year . They present the bright essence of an herb ' s flavor in a way that the dried form can ' t begin to do . The drawbacks of fresh herbs are that they are highly perishable -- and very expensive when you get them from the supermarket . Fortunately , you can easily grow your own , guaranteeing a fresh and inexpensive supply . Plant a variety of fresh herbs in pots , then use them in your summer cooking -- in soups , salads , vegetable dishes , marinades , sauces . Consider starting your summer herb adventures with the following recipes , all jointly developed by Chicago restaurateur Rick Bayless and Susan Goss , chef at Bayless ' s Restaurant Zinfandel . They highlight the special essence of flavor that fresh herbs bring_to a dish . Bayless ' quick tips : * Add fresh herbs during the cooking , then add a little more when the dish is about finished , to introduce the fresh flavor of the uncooked herb . * For an explosion of flavor , garnish a dish with chopped or julienned fresh herbs just before serving . * I urge you to make your own strawberry vinegar ; it will be a boon to your summer cooking . It ' s easy to make and is_full of bright , deep flavor without being harsh . You could use it as a salad dressing all by itself , with only a touch of oil . In this recipe , reserve the remaining dressing for a fresh fruit_salad or perhaps a salad of small spinach leaves with quartered strawberries and marinated sweet onions . SUMMER HERB SALAD WITH STRAWBERRY VINAIGRETTE About 6 cups loosely packed mixed baby lettuces About 2 cups loosely packed assorted summer broadleaf herbs such_as basil , scented geranium , nasturtiums , borage , arugula , mint , summer_savory , flat leaf parsley Strawberry Vinaigrette Rinse lettuces and herbs . Carefully dry in salad spinner or between paper_towels . Wrap in paper_towels and refrigerate until time to serve , up_to 6 hours . Put lettuces and herbs in large salad_bowl . Stir Strawberry Vinaigrette , then measure 1 / 2 cup . Sprinkle over salad and gently toss to coat . Makes 4 to 6 servings .

Strawberry Vinaigrette 1 / 2 cup strawberry vinegar 1 cup corn , canola or safflower_oil 1 / 3 cup halved ripe strawberries 1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon clover honey 1 scant teaspoon salt 1 / 4 teaspoon freshly ground black_pepper * Combine vinegar , oil , strawberries , honey , salt and pepper in blender and puree until smooth . Dressing should have consistency of loose mayonnaise . Adjust seasonings to taste . Dressing should be tangy . Can be made ahead , stored in covered , non-reactive container in refrigerator . Let come_to room_temperature before using . Makes 1 1 / 2 cups dressing . Each 1-tablespoon serving contains about : 85 calories ; 98 mg sodium ; trace cholesterol ; 9 grams fat ; 1 gram carbohydrates ; trace protein ; 0.01 gram fiber . Note : If strawberry vinegar is unavailable , substitute mild white_wine vinegar . Then increase strawberries to 1 / 2 cup when making the dressing . Or make strawberry vinegar by putting 1 quart of very ripe ( even blemished ) strawberries in non-reactive container and cover with mild white_wine vinegar . After 1 week or so , strain , bottle and store in dark , cool place . * This almost cake-like tart is great for picnics -- it transports easily and is delicious at room_temperature . Basically , you can use any seasonal vegetables ; asparagus , shiitake and sweet onions went_into the mixture I tried . Bayless suggests using baby artichokes , trimmed and quartered , in the vegetable mix ( if you can find them ) . This tart is a carry-out item at Zinfandel ' s food market .
