   <TEXT> * The ironies of the &quot; news &quot; paper . On the one hand , we read about talks for treaties of peace between Arabs and Jews , and talks for treaties having to do with nuclear disarmament.Then we read that &quot; the industrial powers flock to this small but wealthy nation in the post-Cold War push to sell weapons &quot; ( &quot; Targeting Taiwan for Arms Deals , &quot; March 14 ) . We arm small nations to the teeth and then expect peace . If it were impossible for nations to acquire arms , then they could only attack each other with rocks and sticks . Why is it legal for any nation to produce and sell arms ? They ( the buyers ) should be spending that money on building or rebuilding their infrastructures , their industrial bases , and above all else , their educational systems , not wasting it on weapons . Why are we not in the midst of treaty talks that ban the production of all weapons , and the trade between nations of same ? PRESTON COSGROVE Los Angeles</TEXT>
