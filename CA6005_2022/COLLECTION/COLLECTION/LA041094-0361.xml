   <HEADLINE> FEHR BALL OR FOUL ? ; PLAYERS ' UNION EXECUTIVE HEAD STAYS WITHIN STRICT GUIDELINES WHEN FORCED TO DEAL WITH BASEBALL ' S INTRANSIGENT OWNERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is late in spring_training , and the man often characterized as the most powerful in baseball has the top down on his rental car , soaking_up the Arizona rays as he marvels at the growth and development he sees when returning to the Valley of the Sun each spring . It is growth similar to that of the Major_League Baseball_Players Assn . since Don Fehr became executive_director in 1983 , a span during which he has had to ward_off repeated attempts by the owners to reduce and restrict player rights through collective_bargaining and collusion . Fehr is now girding for another bargaining battle . The owners want to impose a salary cap that the union is unlikely to approve , and Fehr recently wound_up a 32-day tour of the spring camps in which he reviewed for the players a history of troubled negotiations with the owners , urged the need for solidarity and discussed the possibility of a strike in September , or as early as the All-Star break , if there is no settlement . The last month of the regular season represents the last leverage for the union before the start of the expanded playoffs and World_Series . &quot; A strike is the last_resort , but it ' s hard to envision going_into the off-season without protection against a declaration of impasse by the owners and the unilateral imposition of a new ( economic ) system , &quot; Fehr said . &quot; That would be an absolute conflagration , but it may be what the owners want . We ' ve heard rumors that some owners want to shut_down the industry for a year and a half or more . How ' s that for acting in the fans ' best interest ? &quot; I mean , that kind of talk is not about money but control , and I think that ' s what this is all about -- establishing who ' s in_charge . Funny , I always thought that the owners ' primary interest was winning baseball games. &quot; Funny ? No one has ever accused Fehr of being funny , at least not in public . Bland ? To a degree . Blunt ? To a larger degree . His is a humor wrapped in irony and acerbic wit . His is a skepticism born in the delusional decade of the ' 60s and hardened by too many battles with management . Antisocial and reclusive , as portrayed in a national magazine ? Not entirely . Articulate and well-read ? Definitely . The most powerful man in baseball ? &quot; I don ' t know what that means , &quot; Fehr said . &quot; I don ' t own anything . I ' m not involved in the management of any clubs . &quot; Where that comes from , I guess , is that the players have rights and I ' m the person who stands_up for those rights and says no to certain things . &quot; Since there ' s no commissioner , the owners appear drifting and diffused , but the players don ' t . The players always present a united front . I ' m the players ' spokesman , so I appear to have more power than I do . that ' s where it comes from , but I don ' t take it seriously . I don ' t have much desire for publicity and notoriety . I know it ' s important for me to be recognized to the extent that I ' m considered authoritative when speaking on the players ' behalf , but the rest of it is nonsense . I ' ll be happy when I can slip into obscurity. &quot; * The man who would choose obscurity finds his recreation in reading . Haunting bookstores , he says , is the best part of his spring tour . Fehr read the World Book Encyclopedia before he was 12 , he said . He estimates that he reads 120 books a year , down from 150 because the demands of a job that requires more_than 55 hours a week have become too great . Among the books in his Arizona hotel_room are a science-fiction novel , a biography of the Roman emperor , Augustus , and a study of chaos and complexity theory , which could easily be a history of owner-player relations . Mathematics . Music . Physics . Fehr has never met a subject that didn ' t interest him . &quot; Be it reading or debating , Don has always been interested in how the world works , &quot; his brother , Steve , a Kansas City attorney and player agent , said . Said Fehr : &quot; Interesting stuff if you ' re a weird person , I guess. &quot; Weird ? A touch of self-deprecating humor . This much is certain : Fehr isn ' t into what he calls &quot; meet and greet &quot; social functions . It ' s only important , he said , that he knows his constituency . &quot; Given my scintillating personality , it ' s a good thing I don ' t have to win the public relations battle , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m often accused of being too blunt for that . &quot; I ' ve just never enjoyed social bantering for the sake of social bantering . I ' d much prefer reading , spending time with my family or playing an instrument . &quot; I mean , I ' m not easily given to broad smiles or ingratiating demeanor , but I don ' t think I ' m reclusive . At least , I hope not. &quot; A younger brother , Jerry , was a professional musician before going_into wholesale jewelry . Fehr plays guitar a little and finds therapy , he said , in a digital piano that allows him to put_on headphones and not disturb anyone in his Ryebrook , N.Y. , home , where he lives with his wife , Stephanie , and his four children -- David , 19 , a Kansas freshman ; Mark , 15 ; Rachel , 11 , and Elyse , 6 . The children , Stephanie said by phone , have been born amid several baseball crises . Mark , for instance , arrived during the 1981 players ' strike . His father was gone_for three months . Similarly , Fehr estimates that he has been home for only two or three of his and Stephanie ' s 23 wedding_anniversaries . The 23rd was two weeks ago , and they were apart again . No wonder Fehr would prefer spending those rare free hours at_home . &quot; Don invests so_much time in his job that people only see him in that context , &quot; Stephanie said . &quot; He may appear reclusive and antisocial because of it , but that ' s not accurate . Don doesn ' t socialize with athletes or people in baseball , but we have many friends in a variety of jobs . &quot; He also believes that trust is vital to a relationship , so it takes him longer to develop one . He ' s definitely not a social animal , but he doesn ' t have the time for it even if he wanted to be . His priority is to his job and family , and around us he tells jokes , teases and reacts well to practical_jokes . But not at_work . People seldom see that side of him at work. &quot; Steve Fehr has encouraged his brother to develop a public sense_of_humor , providing him with jokes that elicit only a quizzical expression from Don . &quot; From a public standpoint , Don just isn ' t into the social BS , &quot; Steve Fehr said . &quot; He doesn ' t suffer fools gladly . Never has , never will. &quot; Said Steve Greenberg , the former deputy commissioner who has also worked with Fehr as an attorney-agent : &quot; I don ' t think anyone would suggest that Don has a lot of charisma . He ' ll never make_it in the Catskills as a stand-up comic , but that ' s not a criticism . It ' s just the way he is . He ' s also very thorough , analytical and intelligent . &quot; I ' d say his greatest strength as head of the union is his consistency . He avoids getting tripped_up or undercutting himself in his message , and that takes a lot of discipline . People with a large constituency often get_in trouble changing their message to suit the purpose of the person they ' re talking to , but Don doesn ' t do that . He ' s articulate , straightforward and well principled . &quot; I didn ' t always like his principles when I was in the commissioner ' s office , but they were always well reasoned and consistent. &quot; At 45 , Fehr has been with the players ' union as general counsel and executive_director since 1977 . His 17 years are one more_than the tenure of the legendary Marvin Miller , credited with building the union into one of the nation ' s strongest . An obviously tough act to follow . &quot; Not only has Don done_it , but he ' s been widely praised in the process , &quot; associate general counsel Gene Orza said . Spurred by free_agency , arbitration and the owners ' tendency to spend their national TV money as soon as they got_it , the average major_league salary has risen from $ 72 # 000 in 1977 to more_than $ 1 million . The union ' s licensing revenue has risen from $ 2 million a year in 1981 to more_than $ 70 million . Among his many arbitration victories , Fehr gained a favorable verdict when management tried to impose mandatory drug testing , and his long fight against collusion resulted in a $ 280-million settlement -- before interest -- now being distributed to the victimized players . &quot; By and large , we stopped a really bad thing , &quot; he said of collusion . &quot; If you can ' t have satisfaction over that , you can ' t have satisfaction over anything . If there wasn ' t a residual satisfaction to the job , I would n ' t do_it . We put a lot of pride into our work and feel pretty good about the results. &quot; Fehr grew_up in the Kansas City suburb of Prairie Village , Kan . He played Little_League but was never obsessed with the game . &quot; I was distressed when Charlie Finley took the A ' s to Oakland , but not to_the_point that I couldn ' t find something else to listen to on the radio , &quot; he said . &quot; I haven ' t been to a football game since 1972 . I ' ve never been competitive over things I don ' t consider important . &quot; The job , of course , has allowed me to develop an appreciation for the complexities of the game and the skill level needed to stay_at the major_league level , but I spend so_much time dealing with the day-to-day problems that I just want to go_home at night . I hesitate to go_to the park much because it reminds me of work . &quot; It ' s also difficult for me to be a fan because I ' m involved with so many baseball people that I have to give_up my rooting interest , and that takes a lot of the edge off . One of these years I ' ll be able to spend a summer at the park and enjoy it. &quot; Thus , although Fehr understands the importance of maintaining the romanticist ' s view_as part of baseball ' s appeal , he cannot succumb to it . &quot; I ' m not dealing with something abstract , a piece of art , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m dealing with people ' s careers and futures , and that ' s complicated by the fact that they have only a limited time to make an appreciable amount_of_money . I can ' t afford to be a romanticist about it. &quot; Much of his approach was shaped as a liberal-activist during the 1960s , when he attended Indiana University and later worked_on the George McGovern campaign while attending the Missouri Kansas City law_school . That was the decade of the King and Kennedy assassinations , the Kent State tragedy , the division over Vietnam . Fehr said he saw the country polarized , unable to compromise and that he developed considerable respect for the individual and considerable skepticism in_regard_to the nature and motives of &quot; monopolies and big business. &quot; The impressions lingered , though it was fate that put him in position to exercise the skepticism as an officer of the players ' union . His goal was to be a judge , and his first job out of law_school was as a clerk for U.S. District Judge Elmo Hunter in Kansas City . He and Hunter still talk and exchange opinions , and Fehr still feels a tug when he thinks_about how daily lives are affected in federal_court . Then and now he was also attracted to the challenge of trial law , and he went_on to work for a Kansas City firm specializing in_labor law . That firm was hired by the players ' union in 1976 to handle the appeal of Andy Messersmith ' s free-agency case . Messersmith , a pitcher with the Dodgers at the time , played the 1975 season without a contract to challenge the reserve clause in the standard contract . Arbitrator Peter Seitz ruled_in Messersmith ' s favor , making him a free_agent , and the owners appealed . As the local counsel working with Richard Moss , then general counsel of the union , Fehr helped sustain the historic ruling . &quot; If that isn ' t the most famous case in baseball history it ought to be , &quot; Fehr said . &quot; It enabled the players to achieve their market_value , and it forced the owners to negotiate overdue changes in the reserve system. &quot; Impressed by Fehr ' s work_on the case , Miller asked him to become general counsel of the union in 1977 , when Moss left to become a player agent . Miller retired in December 1982 , and Kenneth Moffett , a former federal mediator , was hired to replace him . Moffett was fired 15 months later , however , for taking positions that the players believed were too conciliatory , and Fehr soon became executive_director . &quot; With the players of that era , there was always pressure to stand as tall as Marvin , but I never regarded it as a burden , &quot; Fehr said . &quot; Marvin had a deserved reputation , and I never hesitated to seek his advice or keep him informed , particularly in the negotiations of 1985 . I also asked Marvin to speak_to the players who were in New York during the negotiations of 1990 on the historical perspective and importance of remaining unified . &quot; I ' ve never agreed with everything Marvin says , but I still talk to him regularly , and of course , the players ' perspective has changed with time . Most of the younger players don ' t know Marvin and aren ' t familiar_with his accomplishments . It ' s valuable to educate them as_to what he did. &quot; Fehr continues to follow many of Miller ' s negotiating precepts -- Don ' t make proposals you intend to withdraw ; don ' t say what you don ' t mean ; make_sure you do what your constituents want you to do because it ' s their future . Fehr said he can ' t allow himself to be influenced by public perceptions of player greed , nor does he believe that the style of the negotiators matters . &quot; The skill matters but not the style , &quot; he said . &quot; Negotiations are driven by the desires of the constituency. &quot; Reached at his New York apartment , Miller said he has seen Fehr mature in his job . &quot; His dealing with problems , and his approaches to problems are all on the plus side , &quot; Miller said . &quot; His handling of collusion was extremely important . On the one hand , he had to deal with the perjury of the owners . On the other , he had the frustration and anger of the players . It took time and skill to work that out , and he was up_to it. &quot; Miller also said he thought the union is as strong as ever &quot; but that doesn ' t cut ice &quot; unless it continues to meet the challenge of owners who , every three or four years , &quot; so under-assess the players that they think they can get_away with anything. &quot; The salary cap , Miller said , is the latest &quot; outrageous example. &quot; &quot; Here you have the anomaly of the owners asking a union whose purpose is to improve the wages of its constituents to join them in a conspiracy to hold_down those wages , &quot; Miller said . &quot; that ' s exactly what a salary cap is , an instrument for holding_down wages . I ' m sure the players will meet the challenge again. &quot; * It is against this backdrop of another potentially bitter labor dispute that the 1994 season has begun . The last seven bargaining negotiations have ended in either lockout or strike . Given that history and the memory of collusion , Fehr said , the union approaches the new talks with skepticism that is &quot; a never-ending drumbeat. &quot; He said each situation is viewed on its own but added : &quot; I don ' t minimize the difficulty or likelihood &quot; of the union ' s approving a salary cap that would limit wages , make_it difficult for teams to improve and significantly modify free_agency and arbitration . Fehr asks familiar questions : How can an industry with revenues of $ 1.7 billion be in financial trouble ? Why do the owners keep talking_about a partnership with the players if the players are never consulted on major decisions ? Why hasn ' t the union received a proposal more_than 15 months after the owners voted to reopen negotiations ? Why did the owners agree with negotiator Richard Ravitch ' s demand that they not join him at the table ? &quot; that ' s disquieting , &quot; Fehr said . &quot; If this is so important to the industry , shouldn ' t they want to participate ? The lack of owner involvement means they don ' t want to hear for themselves . Ravitch even passed a rule to keep them out . What does he want to keep them from knowing ? &quot; Fehr said Ravitch has been treating the owners ' position with the secrecy of the Manhattan_Project . &quot; For a year and a half , he ' s been telling us that he would explain the details of their revenue-sharing formula when it was passed , and now he says it ' s none of our business , &quot; Fehr said . &quot; I mean , the only thing he ' s really told us is they need a new system because they can ' t afford another San Diego ( referring to owner Tom Werner ' s alleged need to break_up his team for financial reasons ) . &quot; I wanted to say , ' Wait , we didn ' t pick the owner and we didn ' t pick the management. ' Did any owners step_in to help that situation or stop it ? Clearly , it wasn ' t important enough for the owners to do something about , but they want the players ' help in trying to prevent it . Maybe we should just buy the Padres and take it ( the club ) off their hands . Do you think they ' d sell it to us ? &quot; Fehr shook his head and said he is troubled by the apparent lack of direction , the appearance of an industry adrift , the absence of a commissioner or chief_executive_officer around whom policy and planning revolves and who serves as a public relations focal_point . Referring to interim commissioner Bud Selig ' s attempt to govern by committee , Fehr said , &quot; There ' s a saying that a committee that designs racehorses comes_out with camels. &quot; Despite the troubled relationship between owners and players and the likelihood it will not improve this year , Fehr said the product itself is too good not to survive and that he has no timetable for leaving his job . He is hopeful , he said , of helping professional_baseball expand internationally and looks_forward to an Olympic tournament , possibly even in Sydney in 2000 , in which the majority of players are major leaguers representing their own countries . He is also hopeful of restructuring the amateur draft . &quot; Too_much money is being wasted in the minor_leagues , &quot; he said . &quot; We should be pushing kids to college , subsidizing those programs and allowing them to play in professional summer leagues while they ' re still in school , the way an acting student is allowed to take roles in summer stock. &quot;</TEXT>
