   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON RESEARCH ; A BRAVE NEW_WORLD IS HATCHED ; AN NIH PLAN WOULD CREATE HUMAN_BEINGS FOR STUDY AND EXPERIMENTATION , AND THEN DISPOSE OF THEM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At the beginning of Aldous Huxley ' s classic novel , as at the entrance to the brave new_world it depicts , there is the &quot; Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre. &quot; In a &quot; squat gray building , &quot; 300 technicians bend over their microscopes , managing the process of human reproduction . The technicians inspect human eggs , then immerse them in a &quot; warm bouillon containing free-swimming spermatozoa. &quot; The fertilized eggs -- human embryos -- are then incubated until they are ripe for bottling and development . The suburban campus of the National Institutes of Health , just outside Washington , is a handsome park ; there are no ugly , squat , gray buildings to mar the sylvan landscape . But what the NIH proposes to undertake is nothing less than the creation of a real-life American analogue to Huxley ' s Central London Hatchery . For , later this week , the advisory committee to the director of NIH will consider and almost certainly adopt the recommendation of the NIH Human Embryo Research Panel that the federal_government sponsor and fund the laboratory creation of human embryos as research materials for experimentation . This research , the panel alleges , will have all sorts of benefits : reversing infertility , enabling us to make more perfect babies , even contributing to the fight against cancer . Other scientists disagree that the potential payoff is that considerable . But even if the scientific benefits were as great as the NIH panel claims , the burning question would remain : Is it ever morally acceptable to create human lives for research experimentation that will , inevitably , destroy them ? Most people instinctively recoil in shock and disgust , even horror , from such a proposal . That reaction should be encouraged , not deplored . It bespeaks not scientific illiteracy but moral common_sense . High_school English students find Huxley ' s fictional future frightening because , in it , men and women have been thoroughly instrumentalized , made into means for someone else ' s ends . Yet that is precisely what the NIH proposes to sponsor , using taxpayer funds to pay the freight . scientists will be creating , manipulating and then destroying &quot; developing human life &quot; that deserves &quot; serious moral consideration. &quot; But evidently not too_much consideration , for this human life , the panel argues , lacks &quot; personhood. &quot; Personhood , according to panel member Ronald Green of Dartmouth , is not a set of &quot; qualities existing out there &quot; but something that &quot; we &quot; bestow on a human creature . Whether someone is too old , too young , too burdensome or too useless to be afforded the protections given to persons is something that &quot; we &quot; decide , on the basis of enlightened self-interest . &quot; Personhood &quot; is not an inherent quality of human_beings ; &quot; personhood , &quot; on Green ' s analysis , is a &quot; social construct. &quot; We have been down this grim road before . The 20th Century is replete with examples of what happens when one group ( or caste or race or party ) declares itself to be the vanguard to whose superior purposes others must bend , even to_the_point of their extermination . The great slaughters of our era -- of Jews , Gypsies , Polish intellectuals , Ukrainian kulaks , Armenians , bourgeois Chinese , Hutus , Tutsis -- all took_place when the humanity of indisputably human_beings was denied by powerful others , who were acting , so they thought , on sound scientific or philosophical or eugenic or theological or political principle . There are some things that should never be done_by anyone , under any circumstances , for any reason , in aid of any possible benefit . One would have thought that , in the wake of Nazi quackery , the exploitation of human_beings as research material would be understood as one of those things . But now the NIH Human Embryo Research Panel proposes to go a step further by deliberately creating human lives whose only prospect is to serve as disposable research material . In so doing , the panel endorses a direct violation of the Nuremberg Code , which , inspired by Dr. Josef Mengele , unambiguously declared that &quot; no experiment should be conducted where there is . . . reason to believe that death or disabling injury will occur. &quot; The use of human_beings for experiments that will harm them and to which they have not consented should be prohibited by law . So should the technological production of innocent human_beings as research materials . Congress must act ; the NIH , alas , seems incapable of recognizing either scientific hubris or crude utilitarianism masquerading as moral reason .</TEXT>
