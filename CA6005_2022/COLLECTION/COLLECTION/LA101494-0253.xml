   <HEADLINE> RUSSIANS SUSPECT PLOT AFTER RUBLE ' S GYRATIONS ; MONEY : THE CURRENCY SURGES AFTER ITS RECENT TAILSPIN . BUT STORE PRICES DON ' T COME BACK_DOWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Natalia Berseneva , a Moscow street_sweeper , got paid Thursday . She spent three-quarters of her monthly salary on two bags of groceries for her children . As she lugged the sacks home at dusk in a cold drizzle , a defeated slump to her shoulders , Berseneva said that she reckoned that Russia ' s &quot; high people &quot; had probably made money this week as the ruble yo-yoed against the U.S. dollar . But she was more worried about how to survive another month of even higher prices with just $ 7 left in the pocket of her tattered raincoat . Better-off Russians watched with similar bewilderment as the value of their rubles shot_up a record 24.8 % Thursday -- and prices on imported goods did not budge downward . Shopkeepers had marked_up their wares Tuesday when the ruble nose-dived from 3 # 081 to 3 # 926 to the dollar , sparking a panic . Prices did not move_on Wednesday , though the ruble stabilized at 3 # 736 after President Boris N . Yeltsin sacked his finance_minister , called_for an investigation and promised to save his countrymen from hard-currency penury . On Thursday , the Russian Central_Bank obediently poured between $ 140 million and $ 155 million into the currency market , pushing the ruble back_up to 2 # 994 to the dollar . But jittery merchants still kept prices at up_to 50 % higher than what they were last weekend . The financial whiplash created new resentment about who had profited from the turmoil in the second superpower ' s currency . Ever fertile ground for conspiracy theories , Moscow roiled with rumors Thursday about who might have masterminded the ruble roller_coaster . The chief suspect was Central_Bank Chairman Viktor V . Gerashchenko , who announced Thursday that he will not resign , although Parliament plans to vote next Friday on whether to fire him . Economist Andrei Illarionov , director of the Institute of Economic Analysis , accused Gerashchenko of deliberately triggering this week ' s panic , as well as the similar currency crises of January , 1991 , and July , 1993 . &quot; The events that occurred on Oct . 11 were organized entirely by the Central_Bank of Russia , &quot; Illarionov charged in a news_conference . Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev also called_for Gerashchenko ' s head . Others suggested a cabal of powerful banks , importers or oil_companies could have paid_off government officials to let the ruble slide . &quot; This was all a big_game , &quot; said Volodya , 32 , one of Russia ' s new bankers . &quot; I don ' t know if the Central_Bank was directly involved in it or not. &quot; Volodya , who did not give his last_name , calculated that anyone with $ 300 million worth of rubles to invest and advance knowledge of the Central_Bank ' s intentions could have earned $ 90 million profit in two days . &quot; How much would you offer as a bribe if you knew you would be $ 90 million richer tomorrow ? &quot; Volodya asked . On the other hand , he said , &quot; it may have all been caused by Russian stupidity and carelessness. &quot; Dark conjectures were heard at the highest levels . Yeltsin ' s press secretary , Vyacheslav V . Kostikov , called the panic &quot; an attempted financial coup &quot; against the president . He suggested that the perpetrators could be former Communist_Party officials , who are believed to control millions of dollars of party money that vanished along with the Soviet_Union . &quot; I cannot exclude the possibility that a secret Communist_Party weapon worked -- money stolen from the country and the people , &quot; Kostikov told the Interfax news_agency . Meanwhile , the man accused of causing Russia ' s first major securities crash was released from prison on Thursday . Sergei Mavrody , head of the MMM investment_company , had been jailed on tax_evasion charges after the spectacular collapse of MMM share prices in July . He stepped_out of the Sailor ' s Rest prison and into a blue Volvo , which whisked him away without his having said how he had won his release .</TEXT>
