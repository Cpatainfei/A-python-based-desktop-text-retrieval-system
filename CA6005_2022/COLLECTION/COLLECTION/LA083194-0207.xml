   <HEADLINE> A COMIC TWIST IN CHINA ; MOVIES : BEFORE BECOMING THE FIRST ASIAN TO WIN CANNES ' BEST PERFORMANCE HONORS FOR THE DRAMA ' TO LIVE , ' GE YOU WAS KNOWN AS THE COUNTRY ' S PREMIER SATIRICAL ACTOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> China ' s New Wave cinema continued its remarkable run of international success at this spring ' s Cannes Film Festival . Celebrated young director Zhang Yimou ' s &quot; To Live , &quot; a Revolutionary-era epic under threat of ban by Communist_Party censors , was awarded the Special_Jury prize , adding_to acclaim earned by last year ' s Golden Palm winner , &quot; Farewell My Concubine. &quot; But more surprising than Zhang ' s achievement was the capture of best performance honors by &quot; To Live &quot; lead actor Ge You , the first Chinese -- indeed Asian -- to win best actor accolades at an international festival . When word of the voting trickled back through China ' s grapevine ( publicity for &quot; To Live &quot; is banned ) , the film community here assumed the distinction was bestowed on Gong Li , Chinese film ' s vivacious , internationally renowned leading lady . It was with astonishment and then elation that fans greeted the news that the film ' s male lead , the unheard-of-outside-of-China Ge You , had taken the prize . On the set of his new film , a drama depicting a police_officer frustrated by increasing violence in society , Ge ( pronounced Guh ) talked_about his recent trip to France and his work . &quot; I always assumed that Oscar and Cannes prize_winners knew ahead of time , and just acted surprised , &quot; the tall , animated Ge said with his trademark impish grin . &quot; I was sure they ' d made some mistake. &quot; His loyal Chinese followers have no doubt about the 40-year-old Ge ' s acting ability . The son of a stage and film_star father and scriptwriter mother , his thespian credentials are impeccable . Ge has been a fixture on Chinese film and television screens for years . Ge ' s triumph in the dramatic lead role in &quot; To Live &quot; came as a surprise because he is known and loved as China ' s premier comic actor . &quot; To be quite honest , &quot; he confided with a conspiratorial wink , &quot; I think my co-star may have been a little jealous. &quot; This humor with an edge has been a distinguishing trademark throughout Ge ' s career . A core member of China ' s pioneering &quot; Fifth Generation &quot; of actors and filmmakers , Ge ' s politically charged , satire-laden performances have tested the boundaries of the acceptable in China ' s dangerously capricious cultural climate throughout the last decade . Ge first gained prominence in 1986 for his lead role in the feature_film &quot; The Operators. &quot; Based on a novel by China ' s best-selling brat-pack writer Wang Shuo , the film chronicles the exploits of Ge and two partners as they manipulate discrepancies between China ' s communist veneer and corrupt reality for kicks and profit . Whether disguised as cops and extorting large sums from Hong Kong businessmen &quot; caught &quot; in the act of patronizing prostitutes , or peddling influence to business professionals who believe they are dealing with the offspring of high-ranking party officials , Ge and his wisecracking , street-smart comrades exposed the often sordid reality of Deng Xiaoping ' s &quot; reforms , &quot; and &quot; The Operators &quot; achieved cult status among urban youths . * Several films in a similar vein , including the critically acclaimed &quot; Spring Festival &quot; and Ge ' s first collaboration with Zhang Yimou , &quot; Operation Cougar , &quot; increased his reputation as a rebel with a sense_of_humor , but his leap from antihero to superstar status came_in 1990 when he captured the imagination of 600 million viewers as a crusading investigative reporter in the hit TV series &quot; Stories From the Newsroom. &quot; China ' s first Western-style sitcom , the Wang Shuo / Ge You combination again proved successful with a nationally televised , tongue-in-cheek sendup of everything China ' s leaders revere as sacred . In the show , Mao Tse-tung was frequently misquoted to humorous effect . The favored target of barbs is a matronly Communist_Party busybody who epitomizes hypocrisy . And the episode that garnered the highest ratings depicted a newsroom power struggle following the editor in chief ' s retirement , which precipitated so_much back-stabbing and double-dealing that the old_man was obliged to stay_on . This post-Tian An Men allusion to the leadership ' s inability to agree on a successor to Deng Xiaoping was the transparent reason behind &quot; Stories ' &quot; national audience . Newfound prominence as a result of &quot; Stories ' &quot; success translated into Ge ' s first &quot; serious &quot; film role , as the homosexual opera patron in &quot; Farewell My Concubine. &quot; &quot; I went_to see the film in a Chinese theater and was embarrassed when my appearance on screen was greeted with laughter , &quot; Ge said . &quot; But I think the subject_matter -- political persecution and social intolerance -- is very serious , and the audience ultimately accepted and sympathized_with my dramatic portrayal of a tragic character. &quot; Ge ' s moving performance in &quot; Farewell &quot; led Zhang Yimou to cast him opposite Gong Li in &quot; To Live. &quot; The film portrays one family ' s saga spanning the years from China ' s 1930s civil_war through the Cultural Revolution ( 1966-1976 ) . Due_to currently tense political circumstances , it is doubtful Chinese audiences will be permitted to see the film . &quot; Just as my evolution from comedy to drama has been natural , I think Chinese audiences should be allowed to advance from making light of our tragic past to seriously examining its causes , &quot; Ge commented . * He suggested that his award-winning performance may have benefited from the fact that the story was his family ' s own . Ge was separated from his parents throughout his teens , his mother and father spending a decade in a labor camp while he was raising pigs on a rural farm in place of a high_school education . &quot; Those years were a tragedy for China , but hiding from it will not heal the wounds , &quot; he said . &quot; I think it is a mistake to ban this kind of film in China , an error that I believe must and will be rectified. &quot; The police drama he is currently shooting sees Ge reuniting with his old &quot; Operators &quot; colleagues for the first time . A scene they are currently working_on involves a soccer riot , similar to that which followed China ' s World Cup qualifying loss in 1986 . Its filming , coinciding with the 1994 World Cup , was unplanned -- although Ge is a big soccer fan and resents missing games while on the set . He said he sees the future holding more of the same for him , staying busy with work , continuing to improve his acting skills and testing the boundaries of the acceptable . Ge concluded : &quot; I hope that I will see a day in China when no serious topic is off-limits to artistic treatment. &quot;</TEXT>
