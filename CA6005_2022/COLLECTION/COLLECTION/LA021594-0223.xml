   <HEADLINE> BONE SITES VERIFIED AT BOLSA CHICA WETLANDS ; ARTIFACTS : NATIVE_AMERICANS SAY PLANNED DEVELOPMENT IS_ON BURIAL_GROUND . IT ' S NOT KNOWN IF BONES ARE HUMAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than 20 concentrations of bones lie_in the path of a major housing_development that the Koll Real_Estate Group wants to build near the Bolsa Chica wetlands , according to a study commissioned by the Orange County coroner ' s office . Coroner ' s officials acknowledged the findings Monday , noting that it could be months before it can be determined whether the bones belonged_to humans or animals . However , one set of human bones believed to be about 8 # 000 years old was found at the site in 1992 . And word of this most recent discovery has lent some credence to the arguments of Native_American leaders , who say the 7.4-acre parcel may have once been a prehistoric Indian burial_site . &quot; If it ' s a dedicated cemetery , that ' s it ! &quot; said Jim Velasques , chief of the coastal Gabrieleno Shoshone tribe . &quot; It ' s sacred . You cannot dig_up bones if you have six or more burials without the consent of the descendants. &quot; Koll officials said , however , that the most recent discovery of the bones would not affect their plans for a 4 # 286-home development proposed for 400 acres near the wetlands . &quot; There ' s no question that the site is of great importance to the ancient history of Orange County , &quot; said Lucy Dunn , a senior_vice_president . &quot; But we ' ve designed the most sensitive plan that can possibly be designed . . . . It ' s not likely that a redesign will be necessary. &quot; The map obtained from the coroner ' s office details at least 20 sites where bone matter has been found . It was prepared_for the Koll Real_Estate Group by Nancy Whitney-Desautels , an archeologist excavating the site . While state law does not expressly forbid the destruction of Native_American cemeteries , experts say , public pressure could persuade county officials to require the developer to make major modifications in the project to preserve the site . The issue first drew fire last month when opponents of the project began circulating a memo written by a forensic anthropologist hired by the Orange County coroner ' s office to examine the bones found at the site in 1992 . In the memo , Judy Myers Suchey , a faculty_member at Cal State Fullerton , described the handful of human bones she had seen as &quot; very old , approximately 8 # 000 years , &quot; and therefore of serious interest to archeologists . Angered that no mention of the find had been made in the county ' s draft environmental impact report released last year , project opponents gathered en masse during a city hearing on the_matter that attracted 600 residents . Over the weekend , a group of Native_Americans staged a protest on the steps of Huntington Beach City_Hall , contending that they had been left in the dark regarding the disposition of their ancestors ' remains . Copies of the map , which had not previously been made public , also were circulated at the demonstration . Prepared in August , 1993 , the map is covered with marks indicating locations described in a legend as &quot; known bone concentrations. &quot; What is not clear , Whitney-Desautels said Monday , is how many of the bones are animal and how many human . However , she did not rule_out the possibility that the area was a Native_American cemetery . She described it as &quot; a difficult case &quot; because the human bones discovered so far are tiny and intermingled with animal bones also found at the site . A spokesman for the coroner ' s office said that traditionally about 50 % of the bones reported to Sheriff ' s Department turn_out to be those of animals . According to Whitney-Desautels , two of the more_than 20 bone concentrations at Bolsa Chica have already been determined to be those of deer and dolphin . The rest are in laboratories being studied . &quot; We should know in about three months , &quot; she said . &quot; At this point it ' s impossible to say how many ( human ) individuals are there. &quot; This latest development , however , seemed to have clear implications for Native_Americans . &quot; These are the bones of our great ancestors , &quot; said Martin Alcala , chairman of the Gabrieleno / Tongva Tribal Council . &quot; They are culturally and spiritually significant to us . It would be the same as if we went_into your graveyards and started digging_up your ancestors. &quot;</TEXT>
