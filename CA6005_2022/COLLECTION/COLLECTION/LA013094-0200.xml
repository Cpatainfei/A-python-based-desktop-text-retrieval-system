   <HEADLINE> U.S. EXPLORERS TRY TO STOP TRASHING ANTARCTICA ; SCIENCE : ALL THE WASTE FROM MCMURDO STATION AND THE AMUNDSEN-SCOTT SOUTH_POLE STATION IS TO BE LOADED ONTO A CARGO_SHIP AND SENT HOME FOR PROPER DISPOSAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Al Martin , manager of the largest scientific_research station on this frozen continent , takes_pride in the unsightly but well-organized piles of compacted and crated junk . The trash awaiting removal includes a 7-million-pound backlog from years past . It is expected to be disposed_of sometime within the next three or four years . Everybody arriving_at McMurdo must attend a briefing on what to do with the waste . Bins to segregate every imaginable kind of material are everywhere , inside buildings and on the slushy , unpaved streets outside . At the peak of the austral summer , as_many as 1 # 200 people live here . Workers and scientists alike are hammered with the same message : Keep the place clean . McMurdo , which looks a lot like an old Western mining town on ice , is the hub of U.S. Antarctic research , operated by the National Science Foundation . For the first time , at the end of this scientific season in late February , all waste_materials from McMurdo and the U.S. Amundsen-Scott South_Pole Station -- more_than 5 million pounds altogether -- will be loaded onto a cargo_vessel , the Green Wave , and shipped home . A private contractor in Washington state will handle the final disposal . &quot; For many years we treated Antarctica the way any town was treated back in the States , &quot; said Dwight D . Fisher , senior foundation representative at McMurdo before his recent return to headquarters in Washington , D.C. &quot; For the most part , we ' ve gotten_rid_of anything that has PCBs in it , &quot; Martin said . &quot; You almost have to see a before-and-after picture to see how much effort we went to. &quot; Even dirt and ice contaminated by spilled diesel_fuel are scraped_up and put_in barrels for return to the United States . At scientific field camps , restrictions are even tougher . Human_waste is sealed_in drums . In the last five years , partly in response to pressure from environmental organizations , $ 42 million has been spent to clean_up McMurdo . &quot; It ' s an unmistakable shift that reflects the emphasis in our society , nationally and internationally , &quot; said oceanographer Cornelius W . Sullivan , who is director of the foundation ' s Office of Polar Programs . &quot; We are no longer conquerors of the Earth . We are viewers of it. &quot; Until the last few years , McMurdo , which has been in_operation since 1956 , was a smoldering eyesore . Trash and garbage were burned in an open dump . Waste-filled steel_drums were plowed under . Worn-out machinery was towed onto the ice of adjoining Winter Quarters Bay . When the ice melted , the debris sank to the bottom . Today the dump is gone , although residues of toxic materials remain in the ground . Some of them continue to leach into the bay . Once a rich haven for sea life , the small body_of_water has been virtually a dead pond since the 1970s . Discharge of diesel_fuel from ships at an ice dock has contributed to the contamination . A garbage-burning incinerator was installed in 1991 . But the science foundation was forced to shut it down , at least temporarily , last June . A successful lawsuit brought by the Environmental Defense Fund charged that its toxic emissions were too high . &quot; It ' s very difficult for me to believe that an incinerator operating_on a continent that big can ' t be quite effective , very energy-efficient and environmentally sound , particularly when you look_at the alternatives , &quot; said John S . Oliver of Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in California . The alternative -- &quot; to load the waste on a ship , use all_the energy to steam it back to our country , and either burn it there or bury it there -- is just stupid , &quot; Oliver said . Sewage_disposal is still a headache for McMurdo ' s managers . Untreated frozen sewage is chopped_up , mixed with warm brine and flushed underwater through a 160-foot-long pipe . Solid waste piles_up on the ocean_bottom . In late November , divers used high-pressure hoses to disperse it in &quot; Operation Big Flush. &quot; Improvements in sewage treatment are being studied . Options include extending the disposal pipe into deeper currents of the Ross Sea or building some kind of treatment plant . In 1991 the 26 nations conducting scientific_research in Antarctica signed a protocol to strengthen environmental protection . The U.S. Senate approved the agreement in 1992 ; Congress may act this year on legislation to implement it . Four bills have been introduced . Some would dilute the authority of the National Science Foundation and give more environmental oversight to other agencies , such_as the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration .</TEXT>
