   <HEADLINE> TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS / MICHAEL J . BOSKIN : LET ' S SEND WASHINGTON A MESSAGE ABOUT STATE ' S ECONOMY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The early-June Labor_Department report showing California ' s unemployment_rate declining to 8.3 % is welcome news . It confirms what most of us had thought -- that the jump in the unemployment_rate between March and April was a statistical anomaly . The May rate is the lowest in almost 2 1 / 2 years . The modest May job growth corresponds to most other state economic indicators , which depict a gradual improvement from a very deep , long-lived recession . There are several reasons the apparent economic recovery in California is proceeding slowly , some of them traceable to policies emanating from Washington . With the November elections approaching , what policy positions should Californians demand of candidates for federal_office seeking their votes ? * Defense . President Clinton plans to accelerate the defense drawdown through 1998 . What we need is a defense_policy geared to national security in a dangerous and volatile world . With nuclear proliferation , regional conflicts and ethnic strife , the Clinton defense cuts do not make_sense . Californians should insist on a slower , smaller drawdown . This would have the side benefit of reducing the drag_on the California economy , which the rest of the economy must offset . * Taxes . Clinton ' s enormous increase in marginal tax_rates clobbers California disproportionately . Because California ( despite its recent economic difficulties ) is a high-income state , the higher tax_rates take their toll much lower down the California income distribution than is the case nationally . The same is true of the higher taxes on Social_Security benefits starting this year . And the small-business sector -- so vital to California as well as_to the nation -- was hit quite hard by the Clinton tax increase , though not so hard as_to throw the national economy back into recession , as some pundits had predicted . To pay_for its many new spending programs , such_as its welfare non-reform , the Clinton_Administration will be scrambling for more &quot; revenue. &quot; And in a second term , Clinton would have to come_up with massive tax increases as the cost of his programs grew far beyond projections -- at least if history is any guide . Given these prospects , let ' s elect people who will work to lower tax_rates , not raise them . ( By the way , expect Clinton to again propose his forgotten middle-class tax cut as part of his 1996 reelection bid. ) * Health_care reform . The Clinton health_care reform is too bureaucratic and too expensive . Private analysts estimate it would cost from 1 million to almost 3 million jobs nationwide . California would be disproportionately affected . Because California has a higher percentage of uninsured , the burden on small business would be severe here . Because California already leads the country in enrollment in health_maintenance_organizations , any hypothetical savings from a move to &quot; managed competition &quot; would be far less . Californians should insist on far less radical and expensive reform , such_as a package of insurance , malpractice and other voluntary reforms that would greatly expand access , improve portability and help control costs without risking major economic disruption and deterioration in the quality of care . * Illegal immigration . As the grandchild of immigrants , I have always placed great importance on America ' s beacon to the world , so wonderfully symbolized by the Statue_of_Liberty . Successive waves of immigrants from every continent and national and ethnic heritage have made tremendous contributions to this country , including its prosperity . A few years ago , sweeping legislation provided amnesty for illegal immigrants already living_in the United States . Subsequently , reform of legal immigration both raised the quotas and based them more on skills in short supply . But the federal_government has failed to deliver on its promise to control the borders and stem the tide of illegal immigration . At the same time , Washington is increasingly mandating benefits that states must provide to illegal immigrants . This policy has increased the incentives for people to enter the country illegally and overwhelmed the social_services and tax capacity of the handful of states that receive almost all_the illegal immigrants . This is particularly true of California , where welfare benefits are 40 % to 100 % more_than those of New York , Florida or Texas . Gov . Pete Wilson was right to join the governors of Texas and Florida in suing the federal_government to make_it pay the costs of providing these services . The beef here is not with people from other countries trying to better their lives -- that ' s what we all try to do . With the government providing cash , education , health_care and other benefits , just getting here puts many of them at a standard_of_living that would be upper-middle class or higher in their countries . The true problem is the breakdown of our federal system . The federal_government is responsible_for our borders . If the policy is to curtail illegal immigration , the federal_government ought to do so . If the policy is to allow greater immigration , the federal_government , not a_few selected states , should finance the services provided to immigrants in the interim before they become productive workers and taxpayers . Again , Californians should demand that our elected officials coordinate efforts to make Washington pony_up . Federal policies are not the only factors affecting California ' s short- and long-run economic future . But this agenda would go_a_long_way toward ensuring more business starts and expansions , which would lead to more job creation and further declines in unemployment .</TEXT>
