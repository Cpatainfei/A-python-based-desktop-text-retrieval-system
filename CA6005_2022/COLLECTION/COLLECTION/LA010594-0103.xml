   <HEADLINE> AIRCRAFT STRAFE , BOMB FLEEING MEXICAN REBELS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Indian guerrillas continued to withdraw from this town and nearby villages Tuesday , they came under bomb attacks by government aircraft in hilly southeastern Chiapas state . In the late afternoon , at least one warplane backed by helicopters targeted rebel positions on the southern outskirts of the regional tourist center , San Cristobal de las Casas , Reuters news_agency reported . As the military appeared to gain the upper_hand in the five-day uprising , government planes continued to circle the area Tuesday night and strafe the zone with machine-gun fire . There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries . The first group of reporters to enter Ocosingo since the fighting began New Year ' s Day in Chiapas found evidence of the fiercest confrontation to date between the army and the rebels . A total of 25 bodies , mainly of guerrillas but also including that of a baby , were strewn in the streets and buildings , particularly in the village market , where five bodies showed signs of execution , lying face down in a row with their hands behind their backs . Besides 11 bodies , the market contained numerous guerrilla weapons : sticks carved in the shape of guns , some with knives or corrugated metal strapped to the barrel like bayonets . Townspeople , emerging after three days of confinement in their homes , said they believe that there are more corpses in the undergrowth surrounding the village , where vultures gathered . A soldier , who would identify himself only as Juan , said four soldiers and four police_officers were killed in the fighting . Soldiers appeared nervous as they watched the streets from doorways and the town ' s few second-story windows . Neighbors carried two women , found injured in their homes , to the heavily guarded town medical clinic . They debated what to do about a shirtless young_man in fatigue pants and combat_boots whom they found , wounded and unable to speak , near the edge of town where the Zapatistas pulled_out Monday night . Villagers in Huixtla , Oxchuc and Altamirano said the rebels left their towns at dawn Tuesday . The rebels had captured a total of eight communities , including San Cristobal , but have seemingly disappeared back into the jungle . Soldiers still patrolled the main square of San Cristobal on Tuesday but began allowing pedestrians to walk on the sidewalks bordering the plaza , although not through the square itself . Samuel Ruiz , the controversial bishop of San Cristobal and the state ' s leading human_rights activist , condemned the bombing at a news_conference at that town ' s Fray Bartolome de las Casas Human_Rights Center . He cited reports that captured Indian guerrillas were executed in Ocosingo , calling executions and the bombings &quot; excessive measures &quot; and violations of international rules of war . Ruiz called_for an investigation by international human_rights groups , including Amnesty International and Americas Watch , which he said have been contacted and urged to provide observers during the fighting and its aftermath . The new government spokesman for the Chiapas conflict , Eloy Cantu , made a brief statement late Tuesday in which he addressed none of those issues . As the fighting died_down , the exchanges of blame for the conflict rose . The most immediate cause for the invasion of Ocosingo , people here said , was that the guerrillas believed some of their comrades were being held_in the local jail . Juan , the soldier , said residents had told him that the local priest has been inciting them to arms . The priest , who identified himself as Father Pablo , denied that accusation . &quot; I have encouraged respect for human_rights , but always following the legal path , &quot; he said . &quot; I have never promoted armed struggle. &quot; One villager , a middle-age woman who like many of those interviewed asked not to be identified , said the roots of the fighting go_far deeper . &quot; You have to remember that the rich ranchers here are unjust , &quot; she said . When Indians organized a demonstration three months ago in the town square over a land dispute with local ranchers , they were attacked and jailed , she said . Even though the guerrillas looted a rental house she owns near the square , she said , &quot; I understand them . All they want are schools , medical clinics and a decent way to live. &quot; She said that much of the money the federal_government sends_for programs never gets_to the people it was intended to help . Federal spending in Chiapas totaled $ 750 million last year , according to government officials . The guerrillas , for their part , left little more information about themselves in retreat than was known when they declared war on the Mexican army last weekend . Mexican Interior Ministry officials said the guerrillas ' apparent training and skill indicated they had help from foreign leftist groups , probably from Guatemalan rebels who for decades have been locked_in a war against neighboring Guatemala ' s government . Residents in the Chiapas towns said some of the guerrillas ' accents were Central_American and reported that the group included at least one white_man . The guerrillas denied foreign influence , insisting theirs was a purely home-grown movement . The border region formed by Mexico ' s Chiapas state with Guatemala has long been home to Guatemalan rebels , tens of thousands of refugees fleeing violence and Mexico ' s Mayan poor . It is a fluid region , where people traditionally have crossed back and forth with little regard for strict boundaries . Guatemalan Defense Minister Mario Enriquez , in San Salvador to discuss regional security issues -- including recent reports that former Salvadoran guerrillas may have helped arm the Guatemalan rebels -- said the Guatemalan army was investigating whether the guerrillas participated in the Mexican uprising but that he could not yet draw a conclusion . The Guatemalan guerrillas denied any involvement in the week ' s bloodshed . Some analysts in Mexico_City said the government may be trying to blame foreign influence as a way to deflect attention from the root causes of the uprising -- centuries of impoverishment and discrimination that have debilitated an entire culture . Times staff writer Tracy Wilkinson , in Mexico_City , contributed to this report .</TEXT>
