   <HEADLINE> WARRANTS ISSUED FOR CULT CHIEF , AIDE ; OFFICIALS SAY THEY MAY NOT HAVE DIED ; SWITZERLAND : POLICE SAY THE TWO MEN WERE SEEN BEFORE SEVERAL FIRES ERUPTED . AUTHORITIES RAID HOUSES , SEIZE DOCUMENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An international arrest_warrant was issued Friday for doomsday sect leader Luc Jouret and his chief aide , reflecting investigators ' growing concern that the men may be at_large after the mass murder-suicide of 53 of their followers in Switzerland and Canada . Swiss police said Friday that both men were spotted in this Alpine village the afternoon before fires broke_out in three chalets , where 25 of the sect members apparently had been killed by drugs or poison . &quot; It is possible that Mr. Jouret is among the dead ; it is possible he isn ' t , &quot; said Beat Karlen , spokesman for the police investigating the deaths of 23 people in a farmhouse in Cheiry , north of here . &quot; We are looking_into all possible theories. &quot; However , investigators are following strong leads that suggest one or more people were present just before the fires at all three locations where bodies were found in Canada and Switzerland . Although police originally called the deaths of the_Swiss , French and Canadian cult members a &quot; collective suicide , &quot; they now say they believe some victims were murdered . And until all_the victims have been identified , authorities are operating_on the assumption that the leaders may still be alive . As the probe widened Friday , police in Geneva raided several houses and apartments connected to the group , the Order of the Solar Temple , confiscating financial documents and membership lists . Swiss police have also detained several sect members for questioning , and others are being sought . None has been arrested , and the arrest_warrants for Jouret and his deputy , Joseph Di Mambro , do not mention a charge . The timing of the fires , and the fact that the gun used in the deaths in Cheiry has not been found , has complicated the case , investigators said . The first fire , apparently triggered by a timing device , was started late Monday or early Tuesday in a duplex in Canada owned by Di Mambro . Two of the five victims in Canada were alive when the fires started , autopsies have indicated . The three others , including a 3-month-old baby , were killed before the fire began . On Friday , police classified those three as murder victims . The two adults -- a Swiss citizen and his British wife -- were discovered Thursday wrapped in a carpet and blankets in the basement of the duplex . The body of the couple ' s infant son was found a_few hours later wrapped in a plastic bag and hidden behind a water_heater in the basement . The child had been stabbed as well . &quot; The bodies carried wounds made by a hand weapon , probably a knife , &quot; said Michel Brunet , a Quebec provincial police spokesman . He said later the three definitely had been murdered . The baby ' s head was hooded with a plastic garbage bag , similar to those found on some of the cult members in Switzerland . The couple had been living_in a village near the chalet that had served as headquarters for the cult . Their car was found at Montreal ' s Mirabel International Airport . Police theorized that the killer probably drove the car to the airport and took a flight out of Canada . That would have given the killer time to take_part in the mass suicide and murder in Switzerland . The next afternoon , Jouret and Di Mambro were seen in the village of Granges-sur-Salvan . Swiss radio quoted the region ' s investigating prosecutor as saying the two had sought the aid of a locksmith to enter one of the chalets . The owner of a grocery_store near the chalet has said Jouret bought 30 to 40 garbage bags that day . That night , fire broke_out in the sect ' s farm house in Cheiry , about a 75-minute drive northwest of Granges-sur-Salvan . Three hours later , the fires began in the three chalets used by the group in Granges-sur-Salvan . Among the reported victims there was Di Mambro ' s wife . Many of the answers to the remaining mysteries , including the timing of the deaths that preceded the fires , depend_on the outcome of autopsies being conducted by Dr. Thomas Krompecher , a respected pathologist at the University Center of Legal Medicine in Lausanne . Krompecher said Friday that he had completed autopsies on 12 of the 48 victims in Switzerland . Although he declined to reveal the causes of death , he said he had seen evidence of an injection in the arm of one victim . Only five of the bodies have been positively identified . Although the names have not been released , Canadian authorities have named four of them . Krompecher said neither Jouret nor Di Mambro was among those so far identified . He added that he had yet to receive dental and other records on those two men , which he said will be necessary before any identification could be made . The bodies of about 14 victims , from the chalets in Granges-sur-Salvan , had been badly burned . Krompecher said it will be days , if not weeks , before autopsies on those bodies can be completed . Andre Piller , the_Swiss prosecutor leading the investigation in Cheiry , said police found cars belonging_to three cult members who left the farm shortly before the fires broke_out . He declined to say whether the cars were owned by survivors or by people who died later in Granges-sur-Salvan . Among the mysteries is the whereabouts of the weapon used to shoot 20 of the 23 cult members discovered in the Cheiry farmhouse . ( The others probably were suffocated by the plastic bags on their heads , police have said. ) Although 52 bullet casings were found , they had not been fired from the three rifles that police discovered . &quot; There was certainly another person who put several bullets into the heads of these victims , &quot; Piller has said . In Granges-sur-Salvan , police are still making discoveries in the burned ruins . On Friday , they said they found vials of what appeared to be tranquilizers , hypodermic syringes and intravenous drips . None of the victims in Granges-sur-Salvan , including at least four children , had been shot . Police said all appeared to have been drugged by a &quot; powerful &quot; substance , still unidentified , that could have killed them . Farewell letters from some of the victims have been found , police said , and a lengthy letter apparently from the group , saying it was &quot; leaving this earth to find a new dimension of truth and absolution , &quot; was sent to a Swiss cult expert . The authorities also found a Canadian passport and several driver ' s licenses , apparently belonging_to victims , in cars_parked outside the chalets . Police declined to comment on reports that Jouret ' s Canadian driver ' s license was among those discovered there . Police in Geneva , where Jouret , a homeopathic doctor , had a practice and led regular meetings of the sect , have sealed_off several homes and apartments used by the group . Swiss newspapers reported Friday that bank documents and other papers confiscated from those houses suggested that the group ' s members had argued about finances in recent months . Times staff writer Stanley Meisler in Montreal contributed to this report .</TEXT>
