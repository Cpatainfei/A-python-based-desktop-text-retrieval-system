The fifth annual Golf Expo , being held this weekend at the Anaheim Convention Center , is a high-tech paradise for dedicated swingers hoping to drive farther and putt straighter or just looking_for few new toys to help them better enjoy their favorite sport . From laser-guided putting aides to computerized golf_courses , the Golf Expo offers a wide range of golfing gadgets for amateurs and professionals alike . The three-day_event , sponsored by the Southern California Professional_Golfers ' Assn. , runs_through Sunday evening . It features displays by 125 purveyors of golf supplies , clothes , resort and golf_course information , country_club memberships and the latest in practice equipment . Some of the stuff is small enough to be used at_home , such_as a battery-powered putting green with features that include an automatic ball return . Other pieces of equipment , on the other hand , are designed to bring the outdoors inside and would n ' t fit_in most homes . One of those , taking_up a corner of the convention hall , is a computerized practice machine programmed to simulate the world ' s toniest golf_courses . After the golfer hits a special ball toward the green depicted on a large video screen , the on-board computer determines how far and straight the ball traveled down the fairway .
