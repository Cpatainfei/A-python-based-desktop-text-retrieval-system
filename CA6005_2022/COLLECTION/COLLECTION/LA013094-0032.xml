   <HEADLINE> PROFILE ; LORD OF THE MANNERS ; IAN RICHARDSON REVIVES HIS FORMIDABLE PRIME_MINISTER IN ' MASTERPIECE ' SEQUEL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Actors don ' t get much more silken than &quot; To Play the King &quot; star Ian Richardson , who on a recent morning is indeed the very model of that vanishing breed -- a modern British gentleman . &quot; There used to be a great_deal more good-mannered behavior around , &quot; Richardson , 59 , is saying over morning coffee at Brown ' s Hotel , exactly the kind of discreet , wood-paneled hotel his TV character Francis Urquhart might repair_to for a confidence-filled chat . &quot; Now , &quot; the actor continues , &quot; good manners and politeness are regarded by young people as a sign of weakness , and that I find abhorrent . I was brought_up to be extremely good-mannered in all my dealings with my fellow men . I find it quite extraordinary that the very training I had should be regarded_as weak when it ' s a sign of strength to know how to behave. &quot; Try telling that to his chillingly magnetic creation , Urquhart , who , when last encountered in &quot; House of Cards &quot; ( 1991 ) , was leaving a well-mannered trail of havoc and death in his wake . In Andrew Davies ' sequel based on the Michael Dobbs novel , Richardson ' s devious prime_minister locks horns with a newly crowned and -- gasp ! -- compassionate king ( Michael Kitchen of &quot; Out of Africa &quot; ) , whose resemblance to a certain current monarch-to-be is there for the making . Were the parallels acknowledged during filming , one wonders , especially with the issue of Prince Charles ' accession to the throne a constant topic of British tabloid fodder ? &quot; They were never disregarded , &quot; Richardson says under his breath . &quot; I was quite surprised when I first did a scene with Michael Kitchen that he was actually attempting a Windsor voice . &quot; I might have thought myself that Michael might shy_away_from it because of the obvious controversy that would inevitably follow . But then I thought , ' No , this is very brave , because even if he played it with a Liverpool accent , people would make the connection anyway. ' &quot; Richardson says talk_of a sequel never arose during the filming of &quot; House of Cards &quot; and he was at first &quot; of two minds &quot; about reprising the role . &quot; ' House of Cards , ' if you like , was like the first_half of ' Richard III , ' which is the most enjoyable half to play because he ' s saying to the audience , ' I ' m going_to do this , and you ' re going to watch me do_it , and it ' s all jolly amusing. ' &quot; &quot; Now comes the second_half , and it ' s not funny anymore because Richard is in power and he has got_to stay there . He starts suspecting everyone , even Buckingham his old chum , and it ' s all downhill after that , &quot; the actor explains . &quot; I thought it was very likely ' To Play the King ' would be like the second_half , and having played ' Richard III ' at Stratford , I can tell you , I was apprehensive. &quot; The finished product , though , offered its own validation : &quot; I think probably as a melodramatic thriller , ' To Play the King ' has the edge on ' House of Cards , ' which I never thought it would . The way Andrew has written it I win in the end through the usual Urquhart means. &quot; The actor smiles : &quot; It ' s way over the top , really. &quot; It ' s also made the actor a TV_star after a distinguished lifetime in the classic theater , playing most of the Bard ' s great male roles with the Royal Shakespeare Company and appearing from time to time on Broadway . In 1976 , Richardson had a taste of musical stardom on the Great White Way as Higgins in &quot; My Fair Lady. &quot; But despite winning a Tony nomination , he speaks sourly about the experience . &quot; I had never worked with microphones on stage ; my voice had been trained to fill large theaters without electronic assistance and nobody thought to warn me , with the result that Christine Andreas as Eliza was being heftily miked by the controller at the back of the auditorium and whenever I opened my mouth , he was turning the mikes off , which gave a curious imbalance to the thing. &quot; He played the role for a year , &quot; and that was quite long enough . I reached the stage where I would gladly have handed my quite generous salary back to the producers if only they would let me go home. &quot; ( Mere mention of a later Broadway role , in 1981 for Edward Albee ' s ill-fated stage version of &quot; Lolita &quot; and playing opposite Donald Sutherland , makes Richardson wince. ) Back in England with his wife , Marousia Frank , Richardson has forsaken the stage in recent years for character parts on TV and the big screen ( alongside Jeremy Irons in &quot; M . Butterfly , &quot; among others ) . He speaks balefully about losing the role of Lord Darlington in &quot; The Remains of the Day &quot; to James Fox : &quot; The producers looked_at my tapes again , and the consensus of opinion was that , although I ' m not an intellectual person in reality , what comes_across on screen is a man who ' s really rather bright , which was completely wrong . Lord Darlington should be aristocratic but rather stupid , so they went_with James Fox , which is not very complimentary , but at least he was better for it. &quot; All of which may be why , after doubts about a follow-up to &quot; House of Cards , &quot; Richardson readily embraces a rumored third go-round as Urquhart . &quot; As far as the camera ' s concerned , it ' s wonderful for someone of my age who had settled into a routine of turning_up and playing a featured role to somebody else ' s leading role suddenly finding I carry the thing ; it ' s terrific. &quot; But the actor did make one proviso clear to the producers . &quot; I have said I will do_it provided in the final reel Urquhart is blown to bits . They have agreed that he must meet his demise. &quot; Part 3 of &quot; To Play the King &quot; on &quot; Masterpiece Theatre &quot; airs Sunday at 8 p.m. on KVCR , 9 p.m. on KCET and KPBS and Tuesday at 8 p.m. on KOCE . The fourth and final part airs at_the_same_times next week .</TEXT>
