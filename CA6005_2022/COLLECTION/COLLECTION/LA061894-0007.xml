   <TEXT> O.J. Simpson , the football great who rose from the mean streets of San Francisco to international celebrity , became the subject of a massive police manhunt Friday , after a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with the murders of his ex-wife and a male friend . His lawyer , Robert Shapiro , said Simpson disappeared around noon after agreeing to turn himself in to authorities . Shapiro said Simpson , 46 , had been last seen with his friend , former USC teammate Al Cowlings . The two apparently fled together as police were en route to the large , San Fernando Valley house where Simpson ' s arrest was to have taken_place . Shapiro said he was upstairs in the house when Simpson and Cowlings apparently left . Shapiro , who publicly begged Simpson to turn himself in &quot; for the sake of your family , for the sake of your children , &quot; said that in the hours before his disappearance , Simpson had updated his will , called his mother and children , and gave a friend at the house three sealed letters . One , addressed &quot; To whom it may concern , &quot; reiterated Simpson ' s denial that he had any part in the murders of his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , 35 , and Ronald Lyle Goldman , a 25-year-old Brentwood waiter . &quot; I think_of my life and feel I have done most of the right things , &quot; the letter said . &quot; So why do I end_up like this ? I can ' t go_on . No matter what the outcome , people will look and point . I can ' t take that . I can ' t subject my children to that. &quot; The letter concluded : &quot; Don ' t feel sorry_for me . I have had a great life , great friends . Please think_of the real O.J. , and not this lost person. &quot; Authorities , enraged at Simpson ' s disappearance , warned the public against hiding the 1968 Heisman Trophy winner , who had promised to surrender to authorities on Friday morning but failed to show_up . Scores of law_enforcement officers fanned_out across Southern California in an intensive search for one of the world ' s most recognizable public figures when Simpson did not appear as scheduled . &quot; Many of us perhaps had empathy , to some extent , &quot; said a visibly agitated Gil Garcetti , the Los Angeles County district_attorney . &quot; We saw the fall of an American hero . . . . But let ' s remember , we have two innocent people who have been brutally killed. &quot; Nicole Simpson and Goldman were found stabbed to death early Monday morning outside her $ 700 # 000 townhome . Police sources said the two had been slain sometime after 10 p.m. Sunday night as her two small children slept inside . Although police had refused to officially label Simpson a suspect , and Simpson ' s lawyers said he was innocent , sources inside the LAPD made_it clear from the outset that he was the focus of their investigation . The former college and professional_football star was briefly handcuffed and taken into custody at his mansion Monday afternoon . He was released , however , after questioning , and returned to the graceful Tudor-style home , where he remained as evidence against him mounted day by day . By Friday , detectives had concluded their case , recommending that Simpson be charged with two counts of first-degree murder . The charges , which include a &quot; special circumstance &quot; of multiple killings , could bring him the death_penalty if he is found , tried and convicted . Los Angeles Police Commander David J . Gascon said Simpson had been scheduled to turn himself in to police at 11 a.m. , with arraignment set for later that afternoon in Los Angeles County Municipal Court . But time ticked by and Simpson was nowhere to be seen . Finally , just before 2 p.m. , police held a news_conference to announce that Simpson had officially become a fugitive_from_justice . &quot; He is a wanted murder_suspect , &quot; Gascon said tersely , &quot; and we will go find him. &quot; It was unclear how the 6-foot-1 , 205-pound Simpson -- who had been dogged by crowds of reporters and camera crews for most of the week -- had managed to elude the authorities , who had felt confident that someone so famous would never attempt to flee . Throughout the week , Simpson had appeared to be sequestered in his Brentwood home , emerging only to visit his children and to attend Nicole Simpson ' s funeral in Brentwood and burial in Orange County . And after the services Thursday , a man resembling Simpson was photographed ducking past hordes of news reporters into the home -- escorted by an off-duty LAPD sergeant . Police sources say that authorities now believe that that man was a decoy , and intend to interview Sgt . Dennis L . Sebenik , a 25-year veteran who works in the LAPD ' s Harbor Division and who was a member of Simpson ' s security detail . Sebenik said , however , that the Simpson decoy had been intended only to help the grieving Simpson avoid the media . &quot; To get_rid_of you guys , maybe , &quot; he told The Times , &quot; but not to help him get away. &quot; Sebenik said he manages a &quot; legitimate security company &quot; and had been hired to provide security for Simpson . He would not comment on why an off-duty Los Angeles police_officer was providing security for a man widely reported to be a suspect in a double homicide . Gascon , meanwhile , said department officials were investigating Sebenik ' s conduct . &quot; I ' m not going_to rush in here and defend anything that might have occurred , but I ' m not going_to rush to judgment either , &quot; Gascon said . &quot; We have no interest in excusing what is obviously going_to be a difficult situation to explain. &quot; Shapiro said Simpson had been told Friday morning that he would have to surrender that day . Because of Simpson ' s &quot; fragile &quot; emotional_state Shapiro said he had asked several doctors to join him at the San Fernando Valley home where a heavily sedated Simpson had spent Thursday night . Shapiro said he was in constant contact with authorities as doctors were examining Simpson , a process that delayed the planned surrender for nearly an hour . Police , impatient about the delays , called the house to say that they were coming_to arrest Simpson . But , Shapiro said , he did not pass that news on to Simpson , who was with Cowlings in another part of the house . It was apparently at that point that Simpson and Cowlings slipped_away , Shapiro said . As authorities announced to an audibly shocked press corps that Simpson was a fugitive , Nicole Simpson ' s father rushed from her Brentwood condominium , begging a teen-ager to dial 911 . LAPD Sgt . Bob Brounstein said a man claiming to be Simpson called the house at least twice , saying he was coming_over to the scene of the murders to kill himself . &quot; I ' m going_to go join Nicole , &quot; the caller allegedly said . But Simpson never turned_up at the residence . &quot; We have a big mess , &quot; said Sgt . Doug Abney . &quot; This is a false alarm. &quot; As it became increasingly clear that Simpson was not likely to turn_up , other law_enforcement agencies throughout the region were notified of Simpson ' s disappearance . Sheriff ' s officials and the California Highway Patrol joined the manhunt for Simpson , focusing their search on the Los Angeles area . Police said they were looking in particular for a white Ford Bronco apparently belonging_to Simpson ' s lifelong friend , Cowling . They also warned that Simpson might be armed and was considered possibly suicidal . That created yet another problem : If Simpson raises a weapon at an officer , there is the possibility that he could end_up dead . &quot; If we can avoid a shooting , we obviously will , &quot; Abney of LAPD said . &quot; But we have to consider that if he ' s suicidal , he may be homicidal. &quot; The disappearance of Simpson was a public relations nightmare for the LAPD and the district_attorney ' s office , whose decision not to arrest Simpson earlier had been second-guessed in some quarters . Police sources had been saying all week that the evidence against Simpson was strong enough to warrant his arrest , and yet the department held_off , hoping to build an air-tight case before taking him into custody . Gascon said the department was &quot; very unhappy &quot; with Simpson ' s disappearance , and stressed that police had not given Simpson special treatment in their handling of the investigation . Garcetti , who described himself as &quot; upset and angry &quot; about Simpson ' s disappearance , also defended the Police_Department ' s performance , saying investigators had done a commendable job at building the case against the former football star . In the four days since the killings , police sources say , evidence has continued to mount linking Simpson to the crimes . Bloodstains on the walkway where the bodies were found matched Simpson ' s blood_type , they said , and two blood-stained gloves were recovered , one at the scene , its match outside his Brentwood home . Police sources also said that a trail of blood drops stretched across Simpson ' s cobblestone driveway . And Friday , they said that blood stains inside his home matched Nicole Simpson ' s blood_type . The blood evidence appeared to figure against Simpson but is not necessarily conclusive , sources said . Even the rarest blood_types are shared by many people . DNA tests can more definitively identify blood samples , but they take weeks or even months to complete . Garcetti said that a murder weapon , which he described as a &quot; substantial knife , &quot; had yet to be found . Police also have interviewed witnesses about Simpson ' s relationship with his ex-wife , and on Thursday questioned a jogger who said she saw a light-colored car resembling one of Simpson ' s outside the townhouse at around the time the murders are believed to have occurred . Witnesses and authorities said O.J. and Nicole Simpson -- who had apparently seen each other off and on after their troubled and sometimes violent marriage ended in 1992 -- had been together on the evening of the killings , attending a dance recital for their 9-year-old daughter in West Los Angeles . But he was not with the family when Nicole Simpson , her children , and seven others arrived for dinner at the Brentwood restaurant where Goldman had been a waiter for the past three months . Goldman ' s co-workers at the restaurant , Mezzaluna , later said that when Nicole Simpson went_home , someone in her party left_behind a pair of glasses . Goldman , a sometime model who during the past several weeks had struck_up a friendship with Nicole Simpson , volunteered to drop them off at her house on his way home , they said . Their blood-soaked bodies were found sprawled on a Spanish-tile walkway shortly after midnight Monday morning . Coroner ' s investigators said both their throats had been slit , and their corpses bore multiple stab wounds . Investigators added that there were signs that Goldman had put_up a fierce struggle before he died . Police sources placed the time of death at sometime between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. Within hours , police began looking_for Simpson , who , they later learned , had taken an 11:45 p.m. flight to Chicago . Lawyers for the athlete-turned-TV-pitchman said he had been scheduled to attend a meeting hosted by Hertz , the auto rental firm for which he has long been a spokesman . Workers at the Chicago hotel where Simpson checked_in hours afterward said that upon his arrival , he displayed the same affable , avuncular attitude that had been the hallmark of his public persona . When he checked_out at 8:30 a.m. CDT , however , he was visibly agitated , they said , breaking_into a line of other guests at the desk and demanding to be attended_to immediately . Simpson immediately returned to Los Angeles , arriving shortly before noon . Meanwhile , Chicago police scoured his hotel_room , discovering a broken glass , bloody pillowcases and a bloody towel ; a lawyer for Simpson later explained that he had slammed his hand_down and cut his finger upon learning of his ex-wife ' s death . Later , as police struggled to conduct a deliberate investigation in the face of intense press scrutiny , Simpson ' s lawyers protested the celebrity ' s innocence -- even as authorities stressed that he was not officially a suspect . Howard Weitzman , the lawyer who initially represented Simpson , said at first that Simpson had been_on his way to Los Angeles International Airport when the slayings occurred . Several days later , after Simpson replaced Weitzman with Shapiro , the second lawyer said that Simpson had been at_home awaiting the arrival of his limousine at the time . Shapiro , however , also signaled that Simpson was aware that he had become the focus of the case , and indicated that he was planning an aggressive defense with an announcement that he had hired a private forensics team on Simpson ' s behalf . Shapiro also said that Simpson had been distraught since the killings , and had been undergoing treatment for depression . Simpson ' s condition appeared to be particularly acute over the past three days , Shapiro said Friday . He and Simpson ' s doctors feared that the football Hall of Famer might attempt suicide , and one of Simpson ' s last acts before disappearing had been to write three letters -- one to his children , one to his mother and one to the public . Although the letters to his children and mother were not released , close friend Robert Kardashian read the public letter at a Friday afternoon press_conference . &quot; Everyone understand , &quot; the letter said , &quot; I have nothing to do with Nicole ' s murder . I love her and always will. &quot; The Day He Disappeared THE CHARGES Here is a partial transcript of the felony complaint filed against O.J.
