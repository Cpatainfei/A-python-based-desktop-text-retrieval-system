   <HEADLINE> CLINTON ' S TRUST IN CARTER RESTS_ON LONG RELATIONSHIP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was almost midnight when George_Bush went_to_bed , but fellow guest Jimmy_Carter decided to stay_up with their young host and press his case for a more active role in foreign affairs . The host was President Clinton , and the two former Presidents were spending the night at the White_House a year ago this month to speak the next morning in support of the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . Carter and Clinton talked until 2 in the morning . Political allies for two decades , their relations had chilled since Clinton took_office . The former President complained that the Administration had rebuffed his efforts to play a more prominent foreign_policy role , even though he had dealt extensively with foreign leaders since leaving_office . In his young ally , the elder_statesman found a sympathetic ear . He was able to carve out for himself an expansive role as a special presidential envoy in major foreign_policy crises , an assignment that would take him to North_Korea and , most recently , Haiti . In that capacity , Carter has scored some extraordinary achievements . Negotiations over North_Korea ' s nuclear_weapons program , agreement to stop the flood of raft people from Cuba to Florida , the accord averting a U.S. invasion of Haiti -- all these can be traced in whole or in part to the efforts of the former President . But each time Carter ventured to -- and sometimes apparently beyond -- the limits of his authority . He blasted Clinton ' s foreign_policy , as when he declared himself &quot; ashamed &quot; of U.S. economic sanctions against Haiti . He made foreign_policy on_his_own , as when he said the United States was prepared to suspend its pursuit of economic sanctions against North_Korea . The public could hardly be blamed for wondering whether Carter was an unguided missile or the Clinton_Administration had abdicated its responsibility to conduct foreign_policy . Yet Clinton himself retains his confidence in the sometimes prickly elder_statesman . The President , according to aides , is grateful for the role Carter has played in easing crises in Haiti and North_Korea and expects him to continue to be_active in those areas . &quot; They continue to have a good , substantive relationship , &quot; a senior Clinton aide said . &quot; While they differ on some things , and both have strongly held opinions , an awful lot binds them -- they ' re Democrats , Southerners who have been governors and want to bring changes in foreign_policy . A lot of foreign countries do a better job than we do of using former presidents . Clinton believes this is the right way &quot; to use them . Clinton ' s confidence rests_on a long , solid , if somewhat up-and-down , relationship that dates to 1974 , when Carter was Georgia ' s 50-year-old governor beginning to plot his presidential campaign and Clinton was an eager 28-year-old congressional candidate from Arkansas who was already dreaming of being President . After losing his race for Congress , Clinton supported Carter ' s presidential bid in 1976 and was himself elected Arkansas attorney_general that year . From the beginning , Bill and Hillary Clinton hit it off with Jimmy and Rosalyn Carter . &quot; Jimmy_Carter has always thought of Bill_Clinton as one of his earliest and strongest and most visible supporters , and feels he knows him well , &quot; a longtime Carter adviser said . &quot; All through the presidency , the Clintons were considered part of the Carter political family. &quot; Although Hillary Rodham Clinton was only 30 at the time , Carter appointed her as a board_member of Legal Services Corp. , which provides legal advice to the poor . The corporation ' s budget had been slashed by one-third , and the appointment of the aggressive young lawyer signaled Carter ' s intention to revive the institution . When Arkansas Gov . Bill_Clinton ran_for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1992 , the former President , breaking his own rule against supporting one Democrat against another in a primary , endorsed Clinton and helped him carry the Georgia primary . It was a crucial win at a time when the Arkansas governor ' s campaign was reeling over charges of draft avoidance and an extramarital affair . Carter remained a strong supporter and lavished praise on Clinton in a speech at the 1992 Democratic National Convention . But after Clinton ' s election , Carter felt slighted when the President-elect consulted with former Presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald R . Ford but not with him . Some of Clinton ' s aides began spreading the word they did not want to see the new Administration become &quot; Carterized. &quot; &quot; We don ' t want to see this Administration called ' Jimmy_Carter II , ' &quot; one Clinton adviser said at the time . Although none of the remarks were attributed to Clinton or even to his top advisers , they caused a rift . &quot; Clinton was busy , and I ' m sure he had nothing to do with it , but the carping by some of his aides was hurtful , &quot; one of Carter ' s advisers said . Carter felt humiliated at Clinton ' s inaugural gala . The only former President in_attendance , he was assigned a seat near the back . Celebrities read quotes from previous Presidents , including Reagan , but none from Carter . When Clinton spoke , he did not recognize Carter . The former President was steaming when he returned to the Carter Center in Atlanta and resumed his busy life of conducting foreign_policy discussions and traveling around the world , meeting heads_of_state , monitoring elections in emerging democracies and seeking remedies to problems in developing nations such_as river_blindness , the devastating Guinea_worm and the vestiges of slavery . Carter believed that he could at least count_on his old friend , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , to help him in his ventures into foreign affairs . Carter had advised Clinton to nominate Christopher , who had served as his deputy secretary_of_state , calling him &quot; the greatest public_servant I ' ve ever known. &quot; But their relationship cooled as Christopher ' s State_Department resisted Carter ' s efforts to get more involved in foreign_policy . Carter ' s role as a special envoy is widely viewed , particularly at the State_Department , as usurping Christopher ' s powers and overshadowing Clinton ' s official foreign_policy team . And while Carter ' s success in easing the Haitian and North_Korean crises is broadly acclaimed , some Administration officials say his role has greatly complicated Administration implementation of foreign_policy . They especially resent his frequent public criticism of Administration policy . It was not until last September , when Carter went_to the White_House to support the trade agreement and be an honored guest at a ceremony marking the historic Israeli-Palestinian accord , that he re-established a close relationship with Clinton . &quot; That was a real breakthrough , &quot; a Carter associate said . &quot; They both came_away from it saying it was very constructive , they felt very good about it. &quot; It was Carter ' s first trip to the White_House since Reagan was inaugurated to succeed him in January , 1981 . Later that morning , Clinton , Bush and Carter spoke out forcefully in the East Room of the White_House at a ceremony arranged to drum_up public support for NAFTA , a crucial measure that was in danger of dying in Congress . But only Carter took_on Ross Perot , the Texas billionaire who was financing an anti-NAFTA campaign and had been a thorn in Clinton ' s side since running third as an independent in the 1992 presidential election . In an attack that brought the audience to its feet , Carter branded Perot &quot; a demagogue who has unlimited financial resources and who is extremely careless with the truth , who is preying on the fears and uncertainties of the American public. &quot; Carter ' s help on the trade agreement -- a Republican initiative opposed by many Democrats -- further cemented his relationship with Clinton . &quot; The President deeply appreciated his help and the fact he didn ' t hesitate to take_on Ross Perot , &quot; a senior Clinton aide said . Clinton felt that Carter ' s performance set_up Perot for the televised debate with Vice_President Al Gore , which Gore won handily and was widely considered crucial to Congress ' passage of the trade agreement . Before his September meeting with Clinton , Carter had told friends he felt a &quot; sense of betrayal &quot; because the White_House had shown little interest in contacting him , and he had been rebuffed by the State_Department . He made no secret that he believed his old friend Christopher had personally frozen him out . Carter told friends that he had had better contact with the Bush White_House and had an especially cordial relationship with then-Secretary of State James A . Baker III . Christopher &quot; snubbed &quot; him , he declared , while Baker cooperated . And last week , just after returning from his Haiti mission , Carter lavished praise on Baker in a videotaped statement for use at groundbreaking_ceremonies at the Baker Institute at Rice University in Houston . Ironically , Christopher , though upset at some of Carter ' s excursions into foreign_policy , has been a strong proponent of Presidents utilizing the services of their predecessors . In a speech at the opening of the Carter Center_on Sept . 30 , 1986 , he deplored the fact that Presidents seldom seek their predecessors ' help . Turning_to another guest , then-President Reagan , Christopher reminded him that former Presidents are a national resource who leave the White_House with the ability to do great things . &quot; One comes_away from a cursory review of the lives of the ex-Presidents with a chilling sense of a wasted resource , &quot; Christopher said . &quot; On the whole , their experience was undervalued and their advice too_little sought. &quot; In recent days , Christopher has tried to make light of the rift with Carter and declared that he still views former Presidents as an &quot; underutilized resource. &quot; He also visited Carter at his home_in Plains , Ga. , on Saturday on a mission a State_Department aide said was &quot; to bury the hatchet. &quot; Officials described the 2 1 / 2-hour session , which included lunch served by the Carters , as cordial and constructive . It ended with a promise of better communication between the former President and the Clinton White_House . But regardless of any effort at reconciliation , aides to both men say the relationship is likely to remain difficult -- and a complication for the Carter-Clinton relationship -- as long as Christopher is secretary_of_state . &quot; Carter always considered Christopher to be a very capable deputy secretary_of_state , &quot; a State_Department aide said . &quot; Their roles have changed now , and Christopher is secretary_of_state , but Carter still remembers him as a capable deputy and relates to him that way. &quot; Nor is Carter ' s bond with Clinton likely to proceed without more bumps . Carter walks a difficult line . By serving as a mediator rather than purely a presidential envoy , he represents not only the United States ' position , but the position of its adversaries . To succeed , a mediator cannot be supportive of only one side . Thus , when Carter went_to Haiti , he appealed_to the &quot; honor &quot; of Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , the Haitian dictator Clinton had accused of leading a reign_of_terror . And the agreement forged by Carter providing_for the military dictators to leave_office did not include a provision important to Clinton : that they also leave the country . Cedras had balked at that . Carter ' s personality has also rankled some Clinton advisers , if not the President himself . Carter is known for stubbornness , moral righteousness and being unyielding to_the_point of exasperating his own aides . He does not take slights lightly , as his feud with Christopher demonstrates . Whatever problems might develop between them , however , Carter admires Clinton , as he told an Atlanta audience , as &quot; a brilliant young_man &quot; who survived a savage political_campaign and upon becoming President has grappled effectively with some &quot; very difficult foreign_policy questions &quot; inherited from the Bush_Administration . As President , Carter endured two independent counsel investigations -- one into whether he got campaign funds illegally from his peanut warehouse and one into his brother Billy ' s foreign-agent relationship with Libya . No wrongdoing was found in either case . But because of the experiences , Carter empathizes with Clinton ' s ordeal as the subject of the independent counsel investigation into the Whitewater real_estate venture and related matters . In fact , unbeknown to Clinton , Carter and his wife , Rosalyn , each has sent $ 1 # 000 checks , the maximum allowed , to the defense fund the President established to pay his legal_fees and other expenses incurred during the investigation .</TEXT>
