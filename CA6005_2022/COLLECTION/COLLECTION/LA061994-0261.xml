   <TEXT> It hasn ' t been this easy to get a light in years . In March at the Grammys , U2 ' s Bono sauntered onstage with a slim brown cigarillo seesawing up and down in the corner of his mouth . Before , during and after her notorious &quot; Letterman &quot; appearance , Madonna sucked away on a big fat stogie . In &quot; Reality Bites , &quot; Winona Ryder and Ethan Hawke subsisted on a steady diet of tobacco supplemented only by the occasional Big Gulp . In this summer ' s &quot; The Client , &quot; Susan Sarandon shares a tender moment and a cigarette with an 11-year-old boy . And just try to find a party-page picture of model Kate Moss where she ' s not hiding behind a cigarette only slightly narrower than she is . If you want to read more about it , stop into any bookstore and pick_up a copy of Christopher Buckley ' s satire of the tobacco_industry , &quot; Thank You for Smoking , &quot; or Richard Klein ' s eloquent analysis of the literary , philosophical and cultural history of smoking , &quot; Cigarettes Are Sublime. &quot; At a time when Congress and anti-smoking groups are uniting to try to banish them from the American scene , cigarettes seem more a part of our culture than ever . And in the last two years -- since Bill_Clinton entered the White_House , since the term Generation X became shorthand for &quot; What ' s wrong with you kids today ? , &quot; since the waif became a fashion trend instead of a charity_case -- the act of smoking has taken_on a whole new significance . Cigarettes haven ' t changed ; we have , and as a result , we ' re sending a different message by smoking them . It ' s not that we don ' t know tobacco is bad for us . Every man , woman and child in America -- except , of course , the CEOs of the major cigarette manufacturers -- knows that . But these days the fact that cigarettes can kill you only seems to increase their appeal . Wielded with an aggressive fatalism by high-profile puffers from Denis Leary and Jack Nicholson to just about everyone the media has knighted &quot; Young Hollywood , &quot; cigarettes send thick and lingering messages : part challenge , part existentialist credo ( what better way to say carpe diem , dammit ? ) , part symptom . The allure -- the sex mixed with the death and danger of cigarettes -- has wafted through entertainment since Bizet ' s &quot; Carmen , &quot; about a tragic love_affair between a soldier and his cigarette-rolling girlfriend , became a hit in 1875 . The cigarette-factory girls in &quot; Carmen &quot; made an early connection between smoking and sex : &quot; The sweet_talk of lovers -- that is smoke . Their transports and their vows -- all that is smoke. &quot; And it took_off from there . For one thing , cigarettes placed strategically , in the right_hands , look really good and give focus to a scene . &quot; I love it as a prop , &quot; says photographer Helmut Newton . &quot; I think it ' s very sexy , and it gives the person something to do . When you look_at movies between the wars , people never stopped smoking or drinking. &quot; Just look_at &quot; Casablanca , &quot; a film in which the bewitching haze of smoke never clears . &quot; Take Bogart , &quot; says MTV talk-show host and smoker Jon Stewart . &quot; Not an attractive guy . So what was it that drew the Ingrid Bermans and the Lauren Bacalls ? Obviously it was accessorizing with a cigarette . Without the cigarette , he ' s Peter Lorre. &quot; * For years , the cigarettes-as-sex metaphor was the main message Hollywood was sending when it smoked . It started_out simply and , like sex , has gotten increasingly more complicated , evolving from movies like &quot; To Have and Have Not &quot; and &quot; Now , Voyager &quot; -- in which showing two people smoking was as close as a director could get_to showing them having_sex -- to ' 80s erotic thrillers like &quot; Fatal Attraction &quot; and &quot; Basic Instinct , &quot; in which smoking was tantamount_to S &amp; M . In more recent AIDS-aware movies like &quot; Reality Bites , &quot; there is a tacit if grim acknowledgment that both sex and smoking are deadly , but , hey something ' s gonna kill you -- probably sooner rather than later -- and there aren ' t any good jobs out there anyway , so . . . . But sex isn ' t the only signal being sent by cigarettes in the movies . By the middle of the health-obsessed , family-valuing , moralistic but hypocritical ' 80s , smoking began to be recast as the purview of the villain , the neurotic , the unstable , the corrupt . Bad cops ( Richard Gere in &quot; Internal Affairs &quot; ) , bad moms ( Anjelica Huston in &quot; The Grifters &quot; ) and coldhearted white-collar guys ( Harrison Ford in &quot; Regarding Henry &quot; ) smoked , and generally they got their comeuppance for it . &quot; Cigarettes were a flash_card , &quot; says &quot; Thank You for Smoking &quot; author Buckley . &quot; It was axiomatic : If a guy lit_up , he wasn ' t in control of_his_own destiny. &quot; More recently , smoking has shifted from being almost sociopathic behavior to taking_on an edge of world-weary resignation , particularly in those films that lay claim to an understanding of Generation X ' s pain . &quot; It ' s a device used to show recklessness , &quot; says Janeane Garofalo , who starred as Winona Ryder ' s pot-smoking , sex-without-strings , Gap-managing best_friend in &quot; Reality Bites. &quot; The smoker has become &quot; a rebel , a gutsier person , &quot; she says . &quot; And there ' s something liberating about not caring about the consequences. &quot; In her West Hollywood neighborhood , Garofalo says , smokers feel so hunted that a sort of speak-easy mentality has emerged : &quot; I think you ' re seeing a lot more young people smoking in coffeehouses . In places that look the other way , business is definitely improving. &quot; Unrepentant smokers are rare among the politically correct , not to mention sponsor-conscious , world of television . ( &quot; We ' re discouraged by the network from showing main characters smoking , &quot; says &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; co-creator David Milch. ) But recently the tube has shown compassion for the tobacco-addicted on shows like &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; and miniseries like &quot; Prime Suspect , &quot; on which smoking characters have struggled to quit . &quot; Sipowicz was a smoker in the first two episodes , &quot; Milch says of the &quot; NYPD Blues &quot; character . &quot; But when he got shot , he gave it up. &quot; Apparently getting shot works better than hypnotism . And &quot; Prime Suspect , &quot; the_British miniseries that aired on PBS , has made Chief Inspector Jane Tennyson ' s smoking part of the evolving story line . In the first installment she smoked , in the second she quit , and in the third she struggled to stay_on the wagon ; simply knowing that she wanted to smoke somehow helped us understand her troubled nature better . At least one new film takes smoking as human foible even further . In next month ' s &quot; The Client &quot; ( from the book by John Grisham ) , Susan Sarandon plays a lawyer with a past who finally reaches a distant young boy -- by sharing her cigarette with him . &quot; It came_out of character , &quot; says &quot; Client &quot; director Joel Schumacher . &quot; She touches him so profoundly that when he reaches forward , if they were adults , he would kiss her . I ' m sure we ' ll get a lot of criticism for that . I ' m sure effigies of Susan will be burned. &quot; Sarandon , perhaps fearing the same thing , refused to approve any still photography that showed her smoking . * So it ' s no longer just the villains who inhale ; now it ' s real people with real flaws and real weaknesses who smoke . Now smoking is being used to show vulnerability ; it ' s a badge of humanity . In the current &quot; When a Man Loves a Woman , &quot; in which Meg Ryan portrays a recovering alcoholic wife and mother , the viewer is actually relieved to see her chain-smoking , because it means she hasn ' t taken another drink . And in &quot; The Client , &quot; at least a_couple_of the bad_guys smoke only because the actors playing them , Anthony LaPaglia and Kim Coates , are heavy smokers themselves . &quot; They ' re almost desperate without cigarettes , &quot; says Schumacher , who doesn ' t allow smoking on his sets unless it ' s part of a scene . &quot; It ' s almost easier just to let them smoke. &quot; Schumacher ' s concern for his actors is a good_example of the way smoking has again become OK in film and television : We don ' t care as much about healthy people ( particularly if they ' re playing villains ) . But give us men or women so troubled that they don ' t care whether they live or die -- so_much in pain that they need the immediate comfort of a cigarette -- and for them , we can have compassion . One screenwriter who knows says : &quot; Women love unhappy men . They find them sexy. &quot; So maybe it ' s not the cigarettes themselves that make Bono or Bogart and Ethan Hawke appealing but what they represent -- a troubled person living_in a troubled world , who , from a certain angle , when the smoke gets_in his eyes , may look a little bit like you. *</TEXT>
