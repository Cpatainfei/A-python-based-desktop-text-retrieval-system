   <TEXT> Henry Mancini , the prolific and innovative composer , arranger and conductor who gave the world memorable , elegant music for its movies ranging from the &quot; Pink Panther &quot; comedies and cartoons to the classic about alcoholism , &quot; Days of Wine and Roses , &quot; died Tuesday . He was 70 . Mancini , whose birthday was celebrated by 4 # 000 admirers at a benefit_concert April 19 , died at his home of the pancreatic and liver cancer that was diagnosed less than four months ago . His wife , Ginny , was with him . Mancini ' s music earned him an extraordinary collection of awards as well as universal popularity . He was nominated for Grammys 72 times and won 20 , and was nominated for Academy Awards 18 times , collecting four Oscars for the songs &quot; Moon River &quot; and &quot; Days of Wine and Roses &quot; and the scores of &quot; Breakfast at Tiffany ' s &quot; and &quot; Victor / Victoria. &quot; Mancini recorded more_than 90 albums , garnering eight gold records . He also had two Emmy nominations and a Golden Globe Award . In April , he was awarded the Lifetime Grammy Achievement Award . Flowers were placed on Mancini ' s star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Tuesday , shortly after his publicist , Linda Dozoretz , announced that he had died . Despite his illness , Mancini had continued to work_on a Broadway version of &quot; Victor / Victoria , &quot; a film that starred Julie Andrews and Robert Preston . Dozoretz said Mancini had completed more_than 25 new songs for the musical , which is scheduled to open this fall . Mancini retained his characteristic stamina and wit at the birthday bash where he was serenaded by opera_star Luciano Pavarotti and applauded by many of the people who performed the music he wrote , including Miss Andrews , Andy Williams and John Williams . When UCLA Chancellor Charles Young presented Mancini with the university ' s medal in recognition of his work for young people and music education , the composer quipped : &quot; I was kind of hoping for a diploma. &quot; &quot; Your name has become synonymous with 20th-Century music , and it is already clear that your legacy will live_on for generations to come , &quot; President Clinton said in saluting him at the tribute . Times jazz critic Leonard Feather said Tuesday that in evaluating Mancini ' s legendary contributions to Hollywood : &quot; He really turned_around the tradition of writing movie music , moving from strictly classical themes to unprecedented contemporary music . He was very much respected and admired by his peers. &quot; Mancini ' s creation of unorthodox instrumentation and unusual rhythms delighted him as well as his fans . &quot; I just . . . enjoyed the hell out of it , &quot; he told The Times in April . &quot; And I still do . I just love what I do. &quot; Although he wrote classic songs such_as &quot; Moon River &quot; and &quot; Charade , &quot; Mancini never considered himself a songwriter . &quot; I don ' t know if I ' ve ever written a song that wasn ' t on assignment , &quot; he said in February . &quot; All the things that were successful were title or love themes from films . . . . I was always trying to be a quote , unquote , film composer. &quot; No one ever doubted his success from the time he first set foot in Universal Studios in 1952 . &quot; ' Here kid , here ' s the picture . We need music ; put it here , here , here , here and here . Do it. ' that ' s what they said , &quot; he recalled with a chuckle . &quot; Then , as you get more successful , they get more kind to you. &quot; Within a decade , Mancini hit his stride , successively churning_out &quot; Breakfast at Tiffany ' s , &quot; which earned his first Oscar , &quot; Experiment in Terror , &quot; &quot; Days of Wine and Roses , &quot; &quot; Charade &quot; and a string of &quot; Pink Panther &quot; films . &quot; It was just a roll , &quot; he recalled , &quot; a burst of energy. &quot; Asked recently what he considered his most memorable music , Mancini said in terms of popularity it was the theme for the television series &quot; Peter Gunn. &quot; &quot; But as far as emotionally and artistically , &quot; he said , &quot; I think it was the score I did for Orson Welles ' ' Touch of Evil. ' If you listen to that score you ' ll hear a lot of things that finally developed further in film music . . . . Welles didn ' t want the ordinary kind of thing. &quot; The master musician cited melody as the key to what fans came_to call the Mancini Magic . &quot; A good theme -- like the ' Pink Panther ' or ' Baby Elephant Walk ' -- can work all_the way through the picture , which is what I did with them , &quot; he said . &quot; So , for me , a good melody is not just a pretty tune. &quot; Born in Cleveland , Mancini was brought_up in Aliquippa , Pa. , where his father was a steelworker who spent his leisure_time playing the flute in the local Sons of Italy band . The boy preferred football to music , but was persuaded by his father to learn the piccolo , flute and piano . &quot; He held a club over my head -- well , not literally , &quot; Mancini said . &quot; But if I didn ' t practice , I got hit. &quot; Music won out over sports when the young Mancini discovered jazz . He joined the school band and outside dance_bands and began arranging , studying with the conductor of a Pittsburgh orchestra . Mancini was captivated by the way music was put_together , he said years later , &quot; since I was 13 years old , copying sax choruses off Artie Shaw records and not knowing what the hell I was doing. &quot; The teen-ager idolized Glenn Miller , big-band leader and master of swing_music . In 1937 , Mancini won the first of his myriad awards when he became first flutist of the Pennsylvania All-State Band . * When he graduated from high_school in 1942 , his yearbook described him as &quot; a true music_lover , ( who ) collects records , plays in the band , and has even composed several beautiful selections . He wishes to continue his study of music and to have an orchestra of_his_own some day. &quot; More_than living_up_to that prediction , Mancini studied classical_music at the Carnegie Institute of Technology Music_School and at the Juilliard School_of_Music . He arranged music for big_bands when he served in the Army Air Corps and infantry during World_War_II . After the war , Mancini arranged music and played piano for Glenn Miller ' s band , which was reorganized under Tex Beneke . There he was attracted by a backup singer in Mel Torme ' s &quot; Mel Tones , &quot; Virginia O ' Connor . He married her in 1947 , and she became , by her own description , &quot; Hank ' s most severe critic. &quot; After he moved_on to Hollywood and the Universal International composing staff in 1952 , Mancini contributed scores to more_than 100 films in six years . Idolizing Miller , Mancini was the obvious choice to compose the score for &quot; The Glenn Miller Story &quot; in 1954 . He earned his first Academy Award nomination and the praise of critics for music that contributed to the film ' s success . In 1958 , Mancini walked_out_of the Universal barbershop and chanced to meet producer-director Blake Edwards , who would become his friend through more_than 30 years and 25 films . Edwards asked if he would be interested in scoring a new television mystery show , and the resulting distinctive score for &quot; Peter Gunn &quot; provided Mancini ' s big break . His hummable theme showed a national audience that music could enhance mood , suspense and action , and that Mancini was adept at creating it . &quot; That use of the jazz idiom , applied dramatically to the story , &quot; Mancini said in 1964 , &quot; put music on everybody ' s mind as far as television was concerned. &quot; Recorded as &quot; Music From Peter Gunn , &quot; it also gave him his first Grammys , for best album and best arrangement of the year , and an Emmy nomination as best musical_score for television . He got_even more inventive for Blake ' s TV series &quot; Mr. Lucky , &quot; amplifying the sounds of a small jazz combo with lush use of strings and organ . The effort won two more Grammys . Mancini continued to experiment with revolutionary instrumentation and dissonant sounds , using bass flutes , harmonicas , untuned pianos , calliopes , and little-known Arabic and Japanese instruments . He used the harmonica to remarkable advantage in lacing the theme of &quot; Moon River &quot; through the film &quot; Breakfast at Tiffany ' s. &quot; One reason Mancini ' s records succeeded better than those of other film composers was that he refused to release a movie soundtrack , believing the music was not meant to simply be listened to . Instead , he rearranged the score to emphasize major themes and recorded it in a fully equipped sound studio . That care on &quot; Moon River &quot; alone won him five Grammys to add_to the Oscar . Although Mancini seemed to prefer films_over television , he continued to compose for the small screen , including themes for the series &quot; Newhart &quot; and &quot; Remington Steele , &quot; the mini-series &quot; The Thorn Birds &quot; and even a_few ditties for the old NBC &quot; Late Night With David Letterman. &quot; * Mancini ' s most recent albums were &quot; Mancini : Top_Hat ( Music From the Films of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers ) &quot; and &quot; Henry Mancini : As Time Goes By , &quot; including 15 classic love songs from movies performed by the Mancini Pops Orchestra . His most recent film score was for Turner Broadcasting ' s animated &quot; Tom_and_Jerry -- The Movie &quot; released last year . He had written his autobiography , &quot; Did they Mention the Music ? &quot; Much sought after for concerts , the affable maestro made about 50 appearances a year around the world . Among the groups he conducted were the London Symphony_Orchestra , the Israel Philharmonic , the Boston Pops , the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the Los Angeles Philharmonic . He appeared in command performances before Britain ' s royal_family in 1966 , 1980 and 1984 . Mancini frequently encouraged young composers and established scholarships and fellowships for their musical education . His recent birthday tribute raised $ 2 million for the UCLA Center for the Performing Arts and Los Angeles County High_School for the Arts . Known for his common_sense as well as his talent , Mancini also wrote a textbook , &quot; Sounds and Scores -- A Practical Guide to Professional Orchestration , &quot; explaining melody , instrumentation to obtain specific sound_effects and orchestral structure . Four universities saluted his accomplishments and his devotion to education with honorary doctoral degrees -- Duquesne University and Washington and Jefferson College , both in Pennsylvania , Mt . St . Mary ' s College in Maryland , and CalArts in Valencia . In addition to the UCLA Medal that he received in April , Mancini also accepted the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Los Angeles High_School for the Arts from Gov . Pete Wilson . Proud of his Italian-American heritage , Mancini served as grand marshal of New York City ' s Columbus_Day Parade in 1985 and received a leadership award from the parade sponsor , the Columbus Citizen ' s Foundation . In addition to his wife , Mancini is survived by twin daughters , Monica and Felice ; a son , Chris , and three grandchildren . The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to the Young Musicians Foundation Scholarship Fund , 195 S . Beverly Drive , Suite 414 , Beverly Hills , Calif . No services have been planned at this time . Mancini Highlights Here are some highlights of the career of composer and arranger Henry Mancini , who died of cancer Tuesday .
