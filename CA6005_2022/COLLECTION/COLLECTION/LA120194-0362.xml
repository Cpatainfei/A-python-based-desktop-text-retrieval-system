   <HEADLINE> ALLAN MALAMUD : NOTES ON A SCORECARD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The only thing more boring than the rhetoric on both sides in the baseball labor dispute would be games between so-called replacement players . . . . Owners are mistaken if they think a substantial number of union_members will cross a picket_line . . . . If I knew the genuine major leaguers would be playing in 1995 , I ' d be more excited about trade rumors such_as the one that has the Seattle Mariners sending Randy Johnson to the New York Yankees for some prospects . . . . Roger Clemens , making his motion_picture debut in &quot; Cobb , &quot; nearly beaned Academy Award winner Tommy Lee Jones during filming with a fastball that the Boston Red Sox star estimated at 88 m.p.h. . . . In attendance at the &quot; Cobb &quot; premiere Tuesday in Beverly Hills was George Raveling . The former USC coach is walking with the aid of a cane , eating and feeling better , and hoping to do commentary on some NCAA tournament games for CBS , although nothing has been signed . . . . * Don ' t be so sure that the Clippers ( 0-13 ) will break the NBA record of 17 losses out of the gate -- they play the Minnesota Timberwolves ( 1-13 ) Saturday night at the Sports Arena . . . . Last season at this time , the Clippers were 6-7 . Of course , they had Danny Manning , Ron Harper and Mark Jackson . . . . The Clippers are so bad that they ' re getting more attention than the Lakers , who are off to a good start . . . . The youngest player in the NBA is Seattle ' s Dontonio Wingfield , 20 , and the oldest Charlotte ' s Robert Parish , 41 . . . . The John R . Wooden Classic Saturday at The Pond of Anaheim is the biggest December treat for local college basketball fans since the L.A. Classic , the eight-team tournament staged at the Sports Arena from 1959-67 . . . . Wooden ' s UCLA teams won the last six L.A. classics.Among those who participated during the early years were Jerry West of West_Virginia and Jerry Lucas and John Havlicek of Ohio State . . . . It develops that Jeff Fisher and Kevin Kennedy from Taft in Woodland Hills aren ' t the only alumni of the same high_school to coach in the NFL and manage in the major_leagues the same year . . . . According to research by Rick Obrand of Harbor City , the last time it happened was in 1991 , when Dan Henning coached the San Diego Chargers and Joe Torre managed the St . Louis Cardinals . Both are graduates of St . Francis Prep in New York . In 1983-84 , Henning and Torre coached and managed in the same city , Atlanta . . . . * The Raiders have lost their last four to the Chargers at the Coliseum but beaten them three of the last four times at San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium , the site of Monday night ' s game . . . . TV and radio analyst Hank Stram says NFL teams that call timeouts to try to freeze field-goal kickers often outsmart themselves . Stram , who coached the Kansas City Chiefs to victory in Super Bowl IV , says that instead of rattling the kickers , the extra_time allows them to relax . . . . The Orange Bowl game between top-ranked Nebraska and Miami will be played_on Sunday night , Jan . 1 . That means Penn State will know if a national title is within reach when it plays Oregon in the Rose Bowl the next day . . . . It didn ' t shock me that Ohio State gave John Cooper permission to talk to Louisiana State and Oklahoma about their coaching openings . . . . Oscar De La Hoya is donating $ 50 # 000 worth of tickets to the Boy_Scouts of America for his fight against John Avila Dec . 10 at the Grand Olympic . . . . De La Hoya ' s next bout might be against World Boxing Assn . junior-lightweight champion Genaro Hernandez or International Boxing Federation champion John John Molina in February . That would be at 135 pounds for De La Hoya ' s World Boxing Organization title . . . . Poetry in motion : Mashaallah , winner of the Jim Murray Handicap , and Franchise Player , winner of the Red Smith Handicap , have been nominated to the Hollywood Turf Cup on Dec . 11 . . . . The handle on Japan Cup Day at the Tokyo Racecourse was $ 58 # 037 , 772 . Attendance was 165 # 930 . Off-track handle for the 11-race card was $ 430 # 493 , 914 . . . . Rafer Johnson ' s daughter , Jenny , is an outside hitter for the UCLA volleyball team that will play its last home_game of the season at 7 p.m. Saturday at Pauley Pavilion in the second round of the NCAA tournament . . . . I ' d love to see a penalty_box door swing open soon , but in the NHL , not the NFL .</TEXT>
