   <HEADLINE> SUIT SEEKS TO REDIRECT USE OF TOBACCO TAX ; HEALTH : PLAINTIFFS SAY MONEY INTENDED FOR SMOKING RESEARCH AND EDUCATION WAS ILLEGALLY DIVERTED TO BALANCE THE STATE BUDGET . THE WILSON ADMINISTRATION CONTENDS THE FUNDS WERE ALLOTTED PROPERLY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Charging that the governor and Legislature illegally diverted $ 129 million intended for tobacco research and education programs in_order to balance the state budget , the American Cancer Society and the American Lung Assn . filed suit Tuesday to restore the money to its original purpose . The two nonprofit health groups , joined in their suit by four legislators and four private citizens , contended that legislative leaders and Gov . Pete Wilson &quot; in a back_room deal &quot; violated the terms of Proposition 99 , the anti-smoking ballot measure that raised the tax on a pack of cigarettes by 25 cents . That 1988 initiative specified that 20 % of the added revenues go_to anti-smoking education efforts and 5 % to research on tobacco-related disease . But in_order to fill a $ 5-billion gap that was facing the state this year , Wilson and the lawmakers cut deeply into the Proposition 99 programs to pay_for a variety of health programs for California ' s poor , including health checkups for youngsters , examinations for pregnant women and infants and medical services for physically handicapped children and those with inherited diseases . Hit particularly hard was the special tobacco research account , which provides funding for research into smoking-related diseases and for studies of ways to prevent or stop smoking . The budget deal provided $ 8 million for research over the next two years while diverting $ 56 million to health_care programs . The suit , filed_in Sacramento County Superior_Court , asks that the state ' s top financial_officers -- Wilson , state_Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Controller Gray Davis -- be ordered immediately to halt all payments from research and health education accounts_for health_care programs . &quot; The issue is whether the legislators and the governor are above the law and can appropriate taxpayers ' monies to purposes to which they were never intended , &quot; said Paul Knepprath , a spokesman for the American Lung Assn . Earlier this year , two other groups , the Americans for Nonsmokers ' Rights and Say No to Tobacco Dough , asked the court to return $ 166 million in cigarette tax money they claim was illegally diverted to health_care programs in earlier years . Wilson ' s press secretary , Sean Walsh , contended that the Proposition 99 money has been appropriated properly . Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg ( D-Sacramento ) , who wrote the bill that divided up the Proposition 99 tobacco tax_revenue , argued that the use of money was permissible . Isenberg agreed that the last-minute compromise could be characterized as a political &quot; back_room deal. &quot; But he argued that the divvying_up of the tobacco tax_revenues was a political compromise from the time the initiative ' s various sponsors -- including health groups , doctors , hospitals and environmentalists -- &quot; first sat_down and said , ' Let ' s raise the tax on cigarettes , ' and decided how the money should be spent. &quot; Isenberg pointed_out that at no time was all_the added tobacco tax_revenue targeted for anti-smoking purposes . The proposition , for example , provided_for 5 % for wildlife habitat protection . But the health groups that filed suit contend that the Legislature cannot tamper with the 5 % set_aside for research and the 20 % for anti-smoking education . The groups say that the budget compromise provides only 0.8 % for research and 13 % for education . Knepprath said that the parties to the suit would push for a speedy resolution of the case but said any action would require a full-fledged court hearing . &quot; It ' s unclear how quickly the courts will be able to act_on this , &quot; he said . However , the shrinkage in spending on education and research programs has already had an impact . Local health officials throughout the state have been forced to cut_back on education programs aimed at discouraging smoking . The impact on the scientific_research has been even more dramatic . &quot; There ' s been tremendous damage in the continuing delay in funding for important research , &quot; said Charles L . Gruder , director of the University of California ' s Tobacco-Related Disease Research Program . Under Gruder , the university has established an elaborate system for evaluating and funding Proposition 99 grants to public and private research facilities throughout the state . &quot; It takes tremendous time and energy to launch research projects and sustain them , &quot; Gruder said . Uncertainty about funding for tobacco research will inevitably force the best researchers in the field to consider directing their work to other areas , he said . &quot; The whole idea of Proposition 99 is to redirect attention to smoking-related disease . . . . If the money is so ephemeral , if there ' s no permanence at all , they may go_on to study other things. &quot; One of those researchers is Dr. David Burns , a lung specialist at UC San Diego . Burns has been conducting a detailed statistical study designed to determine why some smokers develop lung_cancer and others do not . African American smokers are 50 % more likely to die of lung_cancer than are white smokers , for example . Burns argues that uncovering the reason behind those differences may provide a new understanding not only of lung_cancer but of how cancer develops in_general . But the Proposition 99 research cut has brought a halt to the $ 85 # 000-a-year study . Burns has already been forced to lay off the full-time statistician who was working with him on the project . If it is ever funded again he will have to find and train someone new , which could take several months . And Burns ' own university salary was partly paid_for by the state grant . He must now look_for other grants to make_up the difference .</TEXT>
