   <HEADLINE> UCLA FORECAST SAYS RATE HIKES HURTING RECOVERY ; ECONOMY : LOWER-THAN-EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM EARTHQUAKE REBUILDING ARE ALSO BLAMED FOR SLUGGISHNESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a report scheduled to be released today , UCLA forecasters confirm that California ' s recovery has begun but say it is being weakened by rising interest_rates , a loss of income due_to the January earthquake and continuing losses of jobs in the aerospace industry . &quot; Although it is a relief to stop forecasting continuing recession , the celebration should be a sober one , &quot; UCLA economists Larry J . Kimbell and Tom K . Lieser wrote in the most recent report by the widely watched UCLA Business Forecasting Project . &quot; The recovery will not erase many of the long-term structural problems faced in California. &quot; Nationally , the UCLA project concluded that &quot; 1994 will be a very good year , &quot; adding that inflation should remain in check . Real gross_domestic_product should grow 3.9 % in 1994 and 2.3 % by 1996 , the report predicts . The California report is the second by UCLA saying that the state ' s long-awaited economic recovery has begun . In March , the business forecasting project issued its first positive forecast in several years . But the recovery has been sluggish for a_couple_of reasons , Kimbell said in an interview : less benefit from earthquake-related reconstruction than expected and depressed residential building in the first_quarter of 1994 , due mainly to rising long-term interest_rates . The latter appears to bolster arguments that the Federal_Reserve_Board ' s recent moves to head_off national inflation by raising interest_rates could have the unintended effect of slowing recovery in California . Wednesday ' s report adds that personal_income took a $ 19-billion hit in the first_quarter of 1994 due_to the Northridge earthquake . Still , by 1995 , the California recovery should be apparent in employment , personal_income and retail spending , the report says . By 1996 , the state ' s unemployment_rate should fall below 7 % from 8.3 % in May . The industries that will account_for the state ' s job growth in that period will be construction , trade and services , including finances , the report predicts . Manufacturing job losses , mainly in aerospace , will continue but at a slower pace : 1 % , or 20 # 000 jobs a year , in 1995 and 1996 . On Monday , Hughes Aircraft said it may cut 3 # 400 jobs in the next two years . The only bit of good news on the real_estate front : Los Angeles-area home prices showed a significant month-to-month increase in April , one of the few in the last four years . Other findings : * Total non-farm employment growth since January has been 30 # 400 jobs , an annual rate of only 0.6 % . Manufacturing lost more_than 9 # 000 jobs , due mainly to the loss of defense jobs . In the service sector , 26 # 500 new jobs were created in non-financial services , while retail trade picked_up 7 # 000 jobs and government 5 # 700 . * California ' s unemployment_rate , 8.3 % in May , remains two percentage_points above the national rate . * The average annual growth of real personal_income and taxable sales will average only about 2 % for the three years ending 1996 .</TEXT>
