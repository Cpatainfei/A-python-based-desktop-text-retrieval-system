   <HEADLINE> CAUSE TO REFLECT ; MIRRORS CAN ENHANCE THE LIGHT AND SENSE OF SPACE AND BE USED TO DRAMATIC OR PHILOSOPHICAL EFFECT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mirrors have long been used in fiction for everything from telling the fairest in the land to providing a passageway to a world of talking caterpillars and Cheshire cats . In the average home , mirrors tend to be relegated to the bathroom or the back of a door . Their predominant use has been as a looking glass . But , as interior_designers and increasing numbers of homeowners know , there are far more uses for mirrors than merely checking one ' s looks . They can be used to correct design flaws , reflect outdoor scenery and -- in Eastern philosophy -- bring luck . Strategically placed mirrors can visually expand the space in a room and bring_in reflected light . The current trend is to use oversize mirrors for dramatic effect , according to Lynn Duncan , whose interior_design firm is in Laguna Niguel . &quot; I recently put a large mirror on the back wall of a dining_room in a condo . It opened the room up and added volume to an otherwise small place. &quot; Mirrors can be used with or without frames to enhance a decor . If the room ' s furnishings are traditional , Duncan recommends a high_quality gold frame . For a contemporary home , a lacquer frame usually works best . When placing a mirror , think_about what it will reflect . &quot; I had a client who wanted to put a large mirror on a back wall instead of taking_advantage of their ocean view , &quot; Duncan said . &quot; When I showed them how the mirror could reflect that view and bring the outside indoors , they decided to use the reflection . &quot; When deciding where to put a mirror , think_of a mirror as artwork , the art being what it reflects , &quot; Duncan said . Dorian Hunter , whose design firm is in Fullerton , also likes to use mirrors to make small rooms look larger . Redecorating a 25-year-old condo in Los Angeles , Hunter was faced with trying to add light and the appearance of space to a very small kitchen . &quot; The kitchen was what they called a galley kitchen . To open_up the space we put mirrors on the wall between the counters and the cabinets , and did the same thing on the wall above the cabinets to the ceiling to reflect the ceiling light . It did the trick , really brightening the kitchen , &quot; she said . * Sometimes the use of a mirror is more philosophical . The ancient Chinese art of feng shui links the placement of objects to fate and good_luck . According to this philosophy , each direction of the compass controls certain aspects of life . Proper placement of the orientation of your house and the arrangement of personal belongings and furnishings brings good_luck or good feng shui . If things are not in the proper order , according to the philosophy , bad_luck , poor health and poverty may result . Feng shui literally means wind and water , representing the power of the environment to affect humankind . Interest in the philosophy has been growing in Southern California in the past decade , said Katherine Metz , owner of the Art of Placement in Los Angeles . She has been using the concepts of feng shui in her design business for about six years . The use of mirrors is a major element of feng shui . Because most Western homes are not designed to the specifications of feng shui , mirrors are used to try and correct architectural flaws . For instance , it is considered a misalignment to have an L-shaped house with a bedroom extending beyond the front_door . &quot; To get that room back into a transcendental state we can put_up a mirror to draw the room back into the house , &quot; Metz said . Mirrors are also used in feng shui to expand areas and draw_in energy . Mirrors are also considered a symbol of water . A feng shui master may enter a house and find an area that symbolizes fire -- not necessarily a tangible element such_as found in a kitchen or fireplace , but a sensation experienced by the master of potential bad_luck . In those situations , a mirror will be placed nearby to &quot; put_out the fire &quot; Metz said . &quot; Feng shui deals with what is seen and unseen , &quot; she added , &quot; things our Western mind hasn ' t been exposed to . But there is a growing interest in the feng shui . &quot; * The quality of mirrors -- whether used for practical or metaphysical reasons -- can vary from thick and solid to thin and wavy . Before purchasing a mirror , experts suggest standing_back and make_sure it has good clarity . There should not be any fuzziness or distortion . Also check for distortions by looking_at it from different angles . &quot; When you use a large mirror you want to go_to a good quality glass and mirror company , one that specializes in top quality mirrors . The ones you buy_at discount_stores may be rippled , &quot; Duncan said . Steve Hemsley , owner of First_Class Glass_in Laguna Beach , said the only way to really know the quality of a mirror is to look_at the back . &quot; There ' s not a lot you can look_for if the mirror is already framed . But if it is unframed , make_sure the coating on the back covers the silver completely . On a good mirror , the glass is at least one-quarter-inch thick and may have a pure silver coating or a combination of silver and copper or other reflective metals . It takes at least two coats of protective_covering to ensure the quality of the reflection remains true , Hemsley said . Proper care of a mirror is important to keep the reflective material from breaking_down . John White , owner of Brea Glass , recommends careful treatment of a mirror during installation . Use clean , dry gloves when installing a mirror , making_sure not to get any perspiration or installation chemicals on the mirror . It is also important not to let a mirror rest directly on the bottom of a frame where water and cleaning fluids can collect and damage the mirror , White said . Experts agree any cleaners used on mirrors should not have ammonia , which can drip into the frame and eat_away the reflective backing , Hemsley said . He suggests using a foam glass cleaner without ammonia . One reason for keeping a mirror in good_condition is the cost of replacement or restoration . &quot; It ' s really not worth the cost to restore a mirror , &quot; White said . &quot; And I don ' t know of that many people who still restore . Even if it ' s an antique cabinet , it ' s less costly to replace the mirror than try and restore it. &quot; Of course , another reason to keep a mirror in good_condition is that it is a focus of attention . And a reflection on your home .</TEXT>
