   <HEADLINE> LEGEND FLYING_HIGH ; AVIATION : PILOTS FROM ACROSS THE COUNTRY MAKE MEMORIAL FLIGHT TO HONOR THE LATE GEN . J.H. ' JIMMY ' DOOLITTLE , WHO LED 1942 BOMBING RUN_ON TOKYO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For Col . Jack Sims , this was the mission that mattered the most . As a surviving member of the Tokyo Raiders , Sims came from Naples , Fla. , to the Van Nuys Airport for a memorial flight to honor the late Gen . J.H. &quot; Jimmy &quot; Doolittle , who led the daring 1942 bombing_run on Tokyo that marked the first American victory against the Japanese in World_War_II . &quot; There was a twinkle in his eye and you ' d follow him to hell and back again , &quot; Sims , 75 , said of Doolittle . On Saturday , Sims and several of his former comrades began the first leg of a statewide air tour in World_War_II vintage planes . The tour will culminate today when a wreath of flowers for Doolittle is dropped from bomb bay doors over the sea near Pebble Beach . A tough street kid who grew_up in Los Angeles , Doolittle died last September at the age of 96 in that seaside town . Saturday ' s mass departure from Van Nuys Airport ' s new Petersen Aviation Terminal featured B-25 Mitchell bombers , P-51 Mustang fighter planes , F-18s , F-16s and other war birds . The flight drew aviation buffs from as far away as Minneapolis and as close as Newport Beach . &quot; Jimmy Doolittle ' s been my hero since I was knee-high to a pup , &quot; said Terry Terrell , 70 , of Newport Beach , who thundered out of the airport as a co-pilot on a silver B-25 nicknamed &quot; Pacific Princess. &quot; A 20-year-old co-pilot fresh out of flight school when he joined Doolittle ' s Raiders , Sims saw the event , which began Friday , as an opportunity to reflect on the changes in aviation since the war . Vintage aircraft stood alongside state-of-the art corporate jets such_as Gulfstream IIs , IIIs and Hawker HS 125-700s , which operate out of the Petersen Aviation Terminal . The terminal also includes five hangars , an observation_tower , and pilot and patron lounges . But while their aircraft may be outdated , Sims , a retired Air_Force colonel , believes no technology exists to replace the spirit of the men who risked their lives in Doolittle ' s famous bombing_run , which was chronicled in the 1944 movie &quot; Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo. &quot; With their planes capable of holding only enough fuel for a one-way trip , Doolittle ' s crew set_off knowing their only hope of survival was reaching the friendly shores of China after dropping their bombs on Japan . Seven of the 80 crewmen on that mission died , some executed by the Japanese , and Sims himself ran_out of fuel and bailed_out over China . Their sacrifice in delivering the war to Tokyo crushed Japanese morale and inspired Americans then and continues to inspire aviation and military history buffs today . &quot; I don ' t think anyone will equal Doolittle ' s stature , &quot; Sims said . &quot; He was a spunky little guy. &quot;</TEXT>
