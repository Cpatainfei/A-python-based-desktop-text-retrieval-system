   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : THE FINALS ; ITALY AND BAGGIO TRY TO GET LEG UP_ON BRAZIL TODAY ; SOCCER : HAMSTRING INJURY TO FORWARD COULD BE THE DECIDING FACTOR IN CLASSIC MATCHUP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The heartbeat of a nation audible in his upper right leg , Roberto Baggio hobbled off a Loyola Marymount soccer field Saturday morning hoping to comfort his countrymen with an old Italian saying . &quot; Hope is the last thing to die , &quot; he said . Across town in Fullerton , the Brazilians smiled , strutted and hinted of a performance inspired by another traditional saying . &quot; Outta our way ! &quot; From these varied perspectives the two best soccer teams in the world will march onto the prettiest lawn in Pasadena today for a game watched by billions , celebrated and suffered by millions and survived by only 22 . At the site of the granddaddy of all college bowl games , it is the mother of all sports events , the 15th World Cup championship , at the Rose Bowl at 12:30 p.m. And the four-year wait has been worth it . Italy vs . Brazil . European tradition vs . South_American birthright . Age-old chants of &quot; Eee-tal-ya &quot; vs . &quot; Ohh ohh , ehh ehh , Bra-sil. &quot; A belief in magic vs . a feeling of destiny . Hope vs . haughtiness . And Baggio vs . himself . If the ponytailed wonder is unable to play because of his strained right hamstring , the Italians lose a man who has scored five of their six last goals . They also probably lose the game . The Brazilians , whose scoring stars Romario and Bebeto have never been stronger or happier , know that . And Baggio knows that . &quot; I would feel a lot of anger , disillusion and desperation if I cannot play , &quot; Baggio said . &quot; It is the dream of all_the children of the world to play in the World Cup_final . You can imagine how I feel. &quot; Those who think Baggio is faking -- and you Brazilians know who you are -- should have seen him at practice Saturday . He did not participate in team drills . He did not move faster than a jog during separate workouts . He was constantly using his hand to massage his upper right leg , wincing with each motion . The injury was already serious enough to cause his removal with 20 minutes remaining in the semifinal game against Bulgaria , even though Italy led by only one goal . He has been listed in the tentative starting lineup for today , but that can be changed up until an hour before the game . Giuseppe Signori , scoreless despite taking 14 shots in this tournament , will replace him if necessary . Arrigo Sacchi , Italy ' s coach , has already announced that if Baggio doesn ' t start , he will not be brought_in as one of two allowed substitutions . Unspoken is Sacchi ' s belief that if Baggio doesn ' t start , by the time he comes_in it will be too late . &quot; I am willing to take a risk , &quot; Baggio said of playing_at less than full strength . &quot; But I don ' t want to be an extra weight for the other 10 men. &quot; The Brazilians , who , like the Italians , are trying to become the first country to win four World Cup titles , don ' t seem to be feeling any weight . Not only do they have history on their side -- they defeated Italy , 4-1 , in the 1970 World Cup_final , and no European team has won a World Cup outside of Europe -- they have also had a great month . After romping through preliminary bouts against mostly lightweights , outscoring opponents , 10-3 , in six games with goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel making only 12 saves , Brazil practiced Saturday in a manner typical of its attitude . Taffarel played midfield and scored a goal . Romario didn ' t even show_up . &quot; We are feeling no pressure whatsoever , &quot; midfielder Mauro Silva said . &quot; We will just play our normal game. &quot; That would mean outstanding defense by fullbacks Aldair and Marcio Santos . And steady midfield play from Mazinho and Dunga . And about a goal each from Romario ( he has five , equaling Baggio ) and Bebeto ( he has three ) . &quot; I think Romario and Bebeto are the strongest pair of soccer players in the world today , &quot; Italian defender Luigi Apolloni said . Italy doesn ' t remember what it ' s like to play a normal game . Enduring much more difficult conditions and opponents on the East Coast than Brazil in the West and Midwest , Italy has reached this game only through opera-style dramatics . The Italians required a short-handed goal by Dino Baggio to defeat Norway and survive the first round . And two late goals by Roberto Baggio to overcome Nigeria in the second round . Then another last-minute goal by Roberto Baggio to defeat Spain in the quarterfinals . They have gone_through 20 of their 22 players and now arrive_at the finals without enough . Alessandro Costacurta and Mauro Tassotti are serving suspensions for misconduct . Defender Franco Baresi hasn ' t played since the second game of the tournament because of arthroscopic knee surgery . Midfielder Roberto Donadoni , who played one of his best games in the semifinal victory over Bulgaria , will play , despite a strained left hamstring . &quot; We have played against many odds , &quot; Sacchi said . &quot; The strength of our character can bring_out hidden forces from our players . This possibly will be the edge that will give us the win. &quot; The Brazilians say they have plenty of other edges . They say that if the Italians try to attack them as expected -- something no other team has done for 90 minutes in the tournament -- they are quick enough to run them out of the Rose Bowl . &quot; The people we ' ve played against , it has been difficult for us to find space . . . but Italy will be trying to play , just like us , &quot; suspended defender Leonardo said . &quot; And when they do , Romario and Bebeto will have the freedom to move. &quot; Italy ' s best hope is that Brazil ' s most important defender , goalkeeper Taffarel , will choke against an offense capable of scoring twice , hitting the post once and forcing a great save in a span of six minutes . The only time Taffarel has faced a fast break , against the_Netherlands in the quarterfinals , he gave_up two goals in 13 minutes . &quot; Hopefully , we will reach the end and there won ' t be a tie , &quot; Taffarel said . The Italians are hoping to simply survive until the end . And once there , that there will be a Baggio . Dino Baggio , a midfielder not related to Roberto , was certain the forward would start today ' s final even if not 100 % ready . &quot; Only 50 % of Baggio will be good_enough for this team , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
