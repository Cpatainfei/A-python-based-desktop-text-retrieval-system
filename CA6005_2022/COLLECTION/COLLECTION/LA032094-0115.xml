   <TEXT> The Op-Ed piece by Harry Bernstein titled &quot; Workplace Totalitarianism Takes_a_Hit &quot; ( Column Left , March 13 ) shows us once and for all_the reactionary nature of recent unionism in America . Not only was labor unwilling to accept sharing of decision-making but it was unwilling to face the reality of international competition and the drastic changes it brought into play.Little wonder that labor_union membership is now under 20 % in this country . Not that labor ' s partnership in management decisions solves the real problem . ( Witness current difficulties in Western Europe. ) Perhaps the most promising trend in the U.S. has to do with employee_ownership , not just decision-sharing . That is already happening at companies like Avis and United Airlines . But why can ' t the employees use the money in their retirement_funds to acquire control of the corporations where they work ? After all , a 10 % ownership of the stock can often give you control of the whole show . But that would surely spell the end of unions . IRWIN GROSSMAN , Los Angeles</TEXT>
