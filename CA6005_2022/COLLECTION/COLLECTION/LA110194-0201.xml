   <HEADLINE> HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION : TO LEARN ABOUT TEENS , GO ALONG FOR ' THE RIDE '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Teens talk straight about drugs , crime and killing on the next ' Donahue ! ' &quot; bellowed the talk-show promo , a reminder of one reason why adolescents watch so little television compared with most other age_groups . Rarely do they recognize themselves on TV . That bad situation would worsen still without ABC ' s &quot; My So-Called Life , &quot; this season ' s TV headquarters for teen Angst . At times tied_up in knots by inner turmoil , there ' s no truer teen on TV than the middle-class 15-year-old played by Claire Danes on the Thursday night series that , despite its blemishes , deserves a better fate than the likely cancellation awaiting it due_to low ratings . In a glossier neighborhood , coming-of-age texture flattens to a sheeny smoothness on Fox ' s durable &quot; Beverly Hills , 90210 , &quot; which still pulls a sizable audience despite its narrow , fancy-pants universe of creamy zitlessness . And the youthful characters in the struggling &quot; Party of Five &quot; continue to wear halos as impenetrable as plexiglass shields in this week ' s special deployment of that new Fox series in the time_slot following &quot; Beverly Hills , 90210. &quot; &quot; Party of Five &quot; is an idealized ZIP_code where the Salinger siblings , ages toddler to 24 , face an uncertain life of orphanhood with a resoluteness worthy of a standing_ovation . Problems here are sizable but never unmanageable , thanks to scripts that apply tenderness and sensitivity in sweeping , whitewashing brush strokes . Although likably gentle and thoughtful , &quot; Party of Five &quot; is probably closer kin to the planet Pluto than Earth . It ' s life as you ' d like it to be , a middle-class fantasy of softened edges where young people face hardship -- on Wednesday the raging hormones of 16-year-old Bailey command center stage along with a crucial carpentry project by family head Charlie -- with wisdom and maturity beyond their years . And where they , and everyone in their realm , seem ultimately to do the right thing . Do yourself a favor tonight , though , and check_out the KCET premiere of &quot; The Ride , &quot; a quite , extraordinary four-part documentary series in which life itself often rages alongside youthful libido . Although created and nurtured on a $ 1-million budget by Shauna Garr , a 30-year-old Los Angeles filmmaker who has worked extensively for MTV , &quot; The Ride &quot; is at once about young people and by them . Ages 17 to 19 , Garr ' s six &quot; travelers , &quot; as they ' re called , logged 9 # 000 miles in a van during two months in 1993 in their quest to capture -- cinema_verite -style -- the tone of a cross-section of youth in Denver , a Native_American reservation in South_Dakota , Chicago , Dayton , Philadelphia , New Orleans , Dallas and Albuquerque . There are people to like in &quot; The Ride , &quot; and people to dislike . There are gangbangers , gangbanger wanna-bes and kids working hard to achieve mainstream goals . There are blacks , Latinos , Asians and Native_Americans . There are gays and gay bashers , poverty and racism -- much of it raw and unfiltered , with many subjects displaying amazing openness in front of the camera . Although Garr had the final edit , the youthful filmmakers shot , interviewed and did much of the editing for &quot; The Ride. &quot; A series about youth for youth ? &quot; I wanted something not made by adults and not manipulated by adults , &quot; Garr says , &quot; but real teen videos that adults may_not even want to watch. &quot; Yet they will want to , for the age appeal of &quot; The Ride &quot; -- and its insights into young minds and their environments -- are transcendent . With Garr and other adult mentors staying in nearby hotels , the &quot; travelers &quot; hung_out and often even lived with their young &quot; guides , &quot; the names given these subjects who were selected from thousands of applicants responding to ads placed in schools and other locations across the United States . &quot; The only way to do this was to have_young people spend time with other young people without adults in the room , &quot; Garr says . &quot; It ' s not that people won ' t talk to somebody 40 years old , but you cannot crawl up in a sleeping bag with a 15-year-old girl if you ' re 40. &quot; Each of the eight half-hour segments ( KCET is airing two per evening ) begins with Garr handing_out assignments reminiscent_of &quot; Mission : Impossible &quot; ( &quot; Your guide in Illinois is Bobby Nelson . Bobby Nelson is 17 years old . . . . &quot; ) . Each segment interweaves two stories that are usually separate , but sometimes juxtaposed in ways that make a narrative point . &quot; Guides &quot; Mac , 19 , and Frank , 18 , daily confront the mean streets of Philadelphia , for example . &quot; My mother died when I was 6 , &quot; says Mac , who lives alone in a basement room . &quot; How did she pass_away ? &quot; one of the young filmmakers asks . &quot; She was shot in the head , &quot; Mac replies . &quot; She didn ' t pass away. &quot; Absorbed by other matters in a well-to-do section of town , meanwhile , relatively pampered 15-year-old Leslie copes_with private_school , worries that she ' s fat and decides she needs a therapist to discuss things &quot; you cannot talk_about with your parents. &quot; Unfortunately for &quot; The Ride , &quot; it opens with one of its weakest segments by showing the audition tapes of the &quot; travelers , &quot; who were selected from some 500 applicants , and seemingly takes forever to reach its 17-year-old &quot; guides &quot; in Denver , one retracing his Native_American roots , the other envisioning a career in politics . &quot; The Ride &quot; has narrative gaps in spots -- there are times when you ' re told less than you want to know -- and it has a real clunker down the road in New Orleans , when one of the &quot; travelers &quot; becomes a &quot; guide &quot; herself , her camera awareness and mugging temporarily throwing the series off track . The more mainstream the subjects , the less compelling are the stories . On the other hand , the young filmmakers will always have Dayton , where they ' re present when a young &quot; guide &quot; who says he is sexually confused gets himself picked_up by a &quot; John &quot; while miked , an incredible sequence that briefly causes the &quot; travelers &quot; to panic . In the same segment , one of the &quot; travelers , &quot; who is African American , is confronted by a racist . &quot; I ' m always attracted to people on the edge , regardless of their social-economic level , &quot; Garr says . Intimate and often mesmerizing , &quot; The Ride &quot; is a documentary on the edge , which is why , even if you ' re long past teen-hood yourself , you can ' t stop watching it . * &quot; The Ride &quot; airs 10-11 p.m. today , Wednesday , Thursday and Friday on KCET-TV Channel 28 .</TEXT>
