   <HEADLINE> LOOK WITHIN FOR THE PERSONIFICATION OF EVIL ; HEBRON MASSACRE : JEWS AND THEIR SPIRITUAL_LEADERS BEAR RESPONSIBILITY FOR SCRIPTURAL DISTORTIONS JUSTIFYING EXTREMISM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The 111 rounds fired from Baruch Goldstein ' s assault_rifle in the mosque at Hebron didn ' t only take the lives of 30 or 40 Palestinians ; Goldstein ' s bullets also pierced the hearts of every justice-loving and peace-seeking Jew . And , since he was a religious man who chose to murder innocent human_beings while they were kneeling in prayer , in a place sacred to both Jews and Muslims , on a day celebrating the Jewish festival of Purim , his shots also rent the holy Torah and sullied the Jewish tradition . What , then , does the religious community have to offer in response to this obvious act of &quot; holy_terror &quot; ? It is , after all , the expositors of the tradition who bear an extra measure of shame and culpability for the atrocity and must provide both a moral critique and guidance to fellow Jews . In and around the Jewish world , one commonly hears that Baruch Goldstein was insane or that he was not a real Jew &quot; because real Jews do not kill innocent people. &quot; Sadly , neither explanation is creditable , as they reflect the apologetic contention that the murderer was not really one of us , not part of our community and , therefore , we are not to blame . Lamentably , Goldstein was very much a part of us . He was an officer in the Israeli reserves and the leading physician in Kiryat Arba , the Jewish settlement adjacent to Hebron . He also was a known extremist . His militant outlook and his violent program were shared by other settlers and his worldview took_root in Israeli soil . Most significantly , the strength of his conviction was drawn from the classical sources of Judaism . Goldstein , in short , represents the evil within , the dark side of Jewishness that is the product of centuries of internalized oppression . During the course of the greater part of the last two millennia , we had no power to act_on these malevolent impulses . But in post-Holocaust Israel , where we bear the psychic weight of the 6 million while being confronted by a seemingly intractable enemy , whom we dominate , the temptation to embrace the seductive appeal for vengeance is almost irresistible . That is why it is all_the more urgent for Jews to acknowledge the allure of this inclination as an initial step_in a process of cleansing and ultimately purging ourselves of our demons . In order to move beyond our obsessions , we first must admit that they are ours . Next comes the most difficult move for traditionalists : acknowledging that the sacred teachings of Judaism contain passages that , when presented uncritically , constitute incitement to violence . Consider the commandment to annihilate Amalek : &quot; Therefore , when the Lord your God grants you safety from all your enemies around you , in the land that the Lord your God is giving you as a hereditary portion , you shall blot_out the memory of Amalek from under heaven . Do not forget &quot; ( Deuteronomy 25:19 ) . Amalek has most often been identified with the particular foe that persecuted the Jews in each generation , whether they were Haman ' s Persians in antiquity or Hitler ' s Nazis in the modern period . Recently , it has become common for some Jews to refer to Palestinians as the contemporary incarnation of Amalek . This viewpoint leads to only one logical outcome -- Baruch Goldstein and the Hebron massacre . When scriptural doctrine is bound to temporal ideology -- and to a gun -- the combination is often explosive . For this reason it is incumbent upon religious teachers to publicly condemn Goldstein ' s literal application of the Amalek injunction and declare it immoral and contrary to Torah . Not to do so is to be an accomplice to the deed and to implicate the Jewish tradition -- and even God . Rabbinic authorities , especially those in Israel , also must clearly assert that the Amalek injunction is of no practical significance . Either it is to be understood as referring to evil in the abstract -- the verse reads &quot; blot_out the memory of Amalek , &quot; not the people -- or , as a parallel text in Exodus suggests , the war against Amalek may be a divine and not a human prerogative : &quot; The Lord will be at war with Amalek through the ages &quot; ( Exodus 17:16 ) . It is , however , probable that Amalek symbolizes the evil that lurks deep inside each of us , and that the eternal battle against him is the inner human struggle in which we are constantly engaged . I would suggest that the test to be applied to all_of our teachings is whether we would feel comfortable circulating them before a mixed audience of Jews , Christians and Muslims . Does Torah reflect a universal ethic of tolerance or a chauvinistic legacy of hatred and bigotry ? In that vein , it seems that all Jews ought to examine their attitudes toward Arabs and Palestinians . Too many of us view them as subhuman and are indifferent to the consequences bred by such prejudice . Finally , a question to ponder : Why is it that , in the Middle_East , the peace forces are led by secularists while the guardians of faith in both the Muslim and Jewish communities tend to be numbered among the fanatic opposition ? Perhaps those of us in pursuit of peace should begin with this problem . It is the key to a future of mutual respect and reconciliation between the children of Isaac and the children of Ishmael .</TEXT>
