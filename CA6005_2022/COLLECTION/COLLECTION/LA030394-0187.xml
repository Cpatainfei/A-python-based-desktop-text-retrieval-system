   <HEADLINE> THEATER REVIEWS ; PLAY WITHIN A PLAY SETS STAGE FOR REDEMPTION ; AUSTRALIAN PRISON INMATES IN ' OUR COUNTRY ' S GOOD ' DISCOVER UNDREAMED OF POSSIBILITIES THROUGH THEIR ROLES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For most of us , the theater is rarely more_than a diversion . But in the real-life circumstances depicted in Timberlake Wertenbaker ' s &quot; Our Country ' s Good , &quot; the very act of putting_on the first play ever performed in Australia proved to be a major turning point , not only for the participants but for the social evolution of a continent . In 1789 , the inhabitants of the Australian penal colonies were the cast-off dregs of British society : transported convicts serving out their days in isolated squalor under the brutal regime of their naval_officer jailers . But when the colony ' s newly arrived governor and a well-intentioned lieutenant enlisted some of the most hard-bitten convicts to perform in a makeshift staging of one of the few scripts in their possession , it was a social experiment without precedent . Amid the colony ' s hellish conditions , so vividly evoked in Ensemble Theatre Company ' s impeccable production , we witness nothing less than the redemption of lost souls through the process of creating art . That the convicts ' play itself is an inconsequential farce makes no difference . The real value of their participation lies_in the undreamed_of human possibilities they discover through their roles . &quot; You ' ve seen rich ladies before , haven ' t you ? &quot; their director , Lt . Ralph Clark ( Ivan Pelly ) , queries as he tries to get them to assume the postures appropriate to their characters . &quot; Well , I ' ve robbed a_few , &quot; replies Liz Morden ( Emma-Jane Huerta ) , a convict under sentence of hanging . As rehearsals progress , Morden ' s moral sensibilities evolve with stunning force . On the flip side of the process , Pelly ' s Clark descends from an initially superior stance as he ' s drawn into a desperate affair with another convict ( Alison Coutts ) . Christopher Vore plays the bullying officer violently opposed to the play . &quot; we ' ll be holding balls for them next , &quot; he sneers with great distinction . His abusive treatment of the convicts makes_for some of the evening ' s most harrowing moments . Wertenbaker ' s extraordinary celebration of transcendent human capability uses adult language and situations in the service of its hard-hitting realism , so mature viewing is advised . With the 11-member cast donning multiple roles in rapid-fire succession , the play ' s challenging production logistics have been handled as smoothly as the delivery of its powerful message by director Robert G . Weiss . The few rough spots are usually matters of pacing : A little more breathing room is needed for the emotional shifts that accompany Clark ' s love scene and for the surreal commentaries by a native aborigine ( Mark Lee ) . And one pathetically self-deprecating , fever-racked character ( Bink Goncharoff ) expires with such an exaggerated flourish -- arm flopping in an enormous arc just as his girlfriend pleads with him not to die -- that the effect is laughable rather than tragic . But then , maybe we ' re just not that sorry to see him go . * &quot; Our Country ' s Good , &quot; Alhecama Theatre , 914 Santa Barbara St. , Santa Barbara , through March 20 , Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m. , Sunday matinees at 2 p.m. Cost : $ 14 to $ 19 . For reservations or information , call 962-8606 . SOUTH PACIFIC In the masterfully unreal universe of Rodgers and Hammerstein , &quot; South Pacific , &quot; now in its 50th anniversary year , endures as one of the team ' s most exotic retreats . If you ' re looking_for escape , why not head for a tropical island paradise where the inhabitants spontaneously give voice to their feelings in perfectly rhymed song , and where full-bodied orchestras lie_in_wait behind every palm frond ? Even if you ' re not tempted by the seductive airs of &quot; Bali H ' ai &quot; and &quot; Some Enchanted Evening , &quot; PCPA Theaterfest ' s revival offers other notable enticements . Topping the list are two strong actors -- Jonathan Gillard Daly and Kerry Neel -- who breathe new life into the familiar romantic leads . Daly elevates the character of Emile de Becque , the reclusive plantation_owner , to an embittered figure of near- &quot; Casablanca &quot; stature after his true love Nellie ( Neel ) bails on their engagement when she learns about his first marriage to a now-deceased Polynesian . His subsequent rendition of &quot; This Nearly Was Mine &quot; reopens the wounds of failed love_affairs the world over . After establishing an engaging self-confidence in her early numbers , Neel ' s wholesome , girl-next-door Nellie is convincingly torn_apart by the racial bias she discovers within herself , something she can ' t even explain . The parallel story line about doomed interracial love between a naive young lieutenant ( Tim Fullerton ) and a beautiful island girl ( Alysa Sylvia Lobo ) founders somewhat on the shoals of the former ' s self-absorbed delivery , but it proves the only weak link in an otherwise impressive cast . The play ' s broadside attack on the deep-rooted prejudice beneath the surface of the American ideal is one of its most surprising elements . For that , we have to thank the musical ' s unusually literate source material -- James A . Michener ' s &quot; Tales of the South Pacific. &quot; To his credit , director Brad Carroll gives full weight to the hard-hitting social commentary . Yet his impeccable staging never loses sight of the primary mission of &quot; South Pacific &quot; : a romantic fantasy of the most unabashedly sentimental kind . It ' s a production guaranteed to make you long for love , danger or a more adventurous choice in_plays , as the case may be . * &quot; South Pacific , &quot; Allan Hancock College Marian Theater , Santa Maria , through March 13 , Thursdays through Sundays at 8 , matinees Wednesdays , Saturdays and Sundays at 2 , $ 11- $ 17 , ( 800 ) 549-PCPA . THE GOOD_PERSON OF SZECHWAN The name Bertolt Brecht isn ' t one we normally associate with zany mirth . But even the cranky old Marxist himself eventually relented from all that austere , social moralizing and conceded that entertainment had some place in the theater after all . In his later works , he incorporated many forms of popular entertainment , from street theater to vaudeville to cabaret-style song-and-dance . Trying to do_justice to the spirit -- rather than the dogma -- of Brecht , director Peter Lackner has brought a spirit of whimsy and optimism about the human condition to his staging of &quot; The Good_Person of Szechwan &quot; for the UC Santa Barbara department of dramatic_arts . Broad slapstick , surreal sound and visual effects , and a fair amount of improvising enliven this ironic modern parable about a social order which rewards evil and punishes good . When three gods visit the mortal world in search of a &quot; good_person , &quot; the best they can come_up with is a prostitute , Shen Teh , who gives them shelter . They reward her with money , which she uses to start a &quot; legitimate &quot; business ( a tobacco store ) , but she ' s quickly exploited and driven into bankruptcy by the unscrupulous people of Szechwan . Only when Shen Teh disguises herself as a man and begins practicing shady business dealings ( including selling opium ) does she regain her former wealth and status . As Shen Teh and her male alter_ego Shui Ta , young Rina Mimoun handles the shifts in her character with promising dexterity . For the most part , however , the appeal is not in the student performers themselves but in the extravagant staging in which Lackner employs them . Although Brecht completed a more-familiar earlier script called &quot; The Good Woman of Szechwan , &quot; for this freewheeling adaptation Lackner chose the seldom-performed , more tightly focused &quot; Santa Monica &quot; version the author revised during his World_War_II exile in the United States . The later version was also the script that fractured his partnership with Kurt Weill , a historical interest item sure to perk_up the umlauts of Brechtian scholars everywhere . * &quot; The Good_Person of Szechwan , &quot; Hatlen Theatre , UC Santa Barbara , Thursday through Saturday at 8 , $ 10 , ( 805 ) 893-3535 . JOAN OF ARC Two paragraphs were omitted from the recent review of &quot; Joan of Arc &quot; at Santa Barbara ' s Trinity Episcopal Church . As the missing section contained the only reference_to the play ' s librettist and producer , they ' re included here for balance and completeness : &quot; Little remains of the original libretto by Susan Stewart Potter ( no relation_to composer David ) which , like the grain of sand that provokes an oyster to secrete its pearl , brought_forth the satisfying score . &quot; Generally serviceable , the much-revised lyrics are still occasionally strained ( an ambitious cleric smirking ' Besides if she ' s a heretic / Then I assure my bishopric , ' and so on ) . &quot; The review went_on to note that the performances commendably overcame the pedestrian lyrics .</TEXT>
