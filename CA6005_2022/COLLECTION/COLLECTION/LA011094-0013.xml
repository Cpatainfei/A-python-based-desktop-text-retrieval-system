   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : PLATFORM ; CHIAPAS : ' NO ONE ' S SCARED OFF YET '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A revolt in the Mexican state of Chiapas has left scores dead . We ask some Los Angeles area residents if they feel the action will have any economic ramifications in Southern California . ABRAHAM LOWENTHAL Director , Center for International Studies , USC The Chiapas uprising is unquestionably a major event , not to be brushed_aside , but its significance for NAFTA and for California-Mexico relations should not be exaggerated or distorted . The guerrilla outbreak in Southern Mexico ' s poorest state does not mean that the Mexican people are repudiating NAFTA , that Mexico ' s current authorities have been cast_aside or that another Mexican_revolution is around the corner . The true international importance of Chiapas is really similar to the significance of the Los Angeles violence of 1992 for U.S. foreign_policy : a clear signal that economic deprivation , ethnic tensions and injustice are not being adequately addressed by local and national authorities . Our own troubles in 1992 were a wake-up call , making_it obvious that government must focus more effectively on unemployment , health , security , equity and representation or risk undermining America ' s international stature and authority . That is also the message of Chiapas . JAVIER RODRIGUEZ Activist , Committee in Solidarity With the Peoples of Mexico , Los Angeles As you know , Los Angeles and California house the largest population of Mexicans outside Mexico_City . We maintain a constant flow of communication with our friends , towns , neighbors and relatives . We send millions of dollars by way of checks , money_orders and so forth to our home states . And we are in tune with the politics and issues taking_place in Mexico . The events in Chiapas are significant as most Mexicans interviewed , primarily by the Spanish-speaking media , have stated that the Mexican government has long forgotten the indigenous populations of Mexico and , in particular , this one . When you look_at the economic and social statistics of Chiapas , you find that it is the poorest state in Mexico . It houses 36 % of the illiterate in the country . The income per family of five is estimated at $ 26 per month . The Indians have a legendary reputation for suffering and also for rebelliousness . It ' s opening the eyes of people who thought that with the approval of NAFTA Mexico was going_to enter the First World . It ' s no accident that the Zapatista guerillas chose the same day NAFTA was implemented to denounce the government and speak_of their plight -- the lack of democracy , the fear of losing their culture and their identity . FRANK DOMINGUEZ President , Orange County Hispanic Chamber_of_Commerce , Santa Ana First of all , it ' s an unfortunate thing that happened in Mexico . It impacts some of the U.S. families that are from that general area of Mexico . But it seems to me that it ' s an isolated incident . President Salinas is concerned , I ' m sure , with the equity of the land situation . But he ' s also concerned for the perception of Mexico by the outside world . I think he will do all he can to resolve this matter swiftly . We learn from every incident and land_reform is an indicator sometimes of the problems we may have from economic recessions and hard_times . This is a reflection , a symptom of some of that . But as Mexico begins to pick_up economically , the issues will change . I don ' t think it ' s going_to have a negative impact , probably next to zero , on business partnerships between the U.S. and Mexico . TERESA SANCHEZ Director , Mexico Information Project , Los Angeles The U.S. Southwest , California and Mexico share a history , a transborder economy , society , culture and a growing population . Whatever happens in Mexico , politically , economically , socially , affects people in California . The crisis in Chiapas shows something that ' s very critical given the recent passage of NAFTA -- that national policies in Mexico have political repercussions that will affect California . One of the things mentioned by the Zapatista forces was that they see NAFTA as a death sentence for indigenous people . I think there ' s an indication that a lot of people here in the United States have been concerned that the terms of NAFTA are beneficial to large corporations but will be detrimental to the majority of people , particularly those on the lowest rung of the work_force . I think the lack of any public outcry or any statement by the Clinton_Administration of concern for the human_rights violations that have been taking_place in Chiapas is quite alarming . DONALD E . STEINMAN Vice_president , Braemer World Travel Inc. , Woodland Hills I think that the news is so new and the area really in the extreme south of Mexico that people are just going_to take a mental note unless the unrest down there becomes more widespread . People aren ' t even really talking_about it . At present , there aren ' t any ( travel ) cancellations . No one ' s scared_off . This time of the year , though , right after the holidays , is a little bit slower . The crucial time becomes spring break and the Easter and Passover holidays . that ' s when the peak travel period to Mexico will come . If this thing becomes prolonged , then that ' s something different .</TEXT>
