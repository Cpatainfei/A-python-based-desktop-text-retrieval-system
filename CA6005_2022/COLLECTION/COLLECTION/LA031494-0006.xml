   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : CONVERSATION WITH F . HAYNES LINDLEY JR. ; CRIME AND VIOLENCE HAVE REACHED ' CRISIS PROPORTIONS '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> F . Haynes Lindley Jr . is president of the Los Angeles-based John Randolph Haynes and Dora Haynes Foundation , which provides funding to study social problems . This year , the organization will provide $ 1.5 million for research on three of society ' s major problems . Lindley talked to Times Staff Writer George White . Question : What is &quot; solutions-oriented research &quot; and how might Los Angeles benefit from such a project ? Answer : Solutions-oriented research means academic research concentrating_on solutions rather than causes -- action-oriented research that is particularly useful to policy-makers and others attempting to address the problems that confront our society . Local and regional social-science issues long have been the center of foundation-supported research . Our goal with this program is to attract the best researchers to focus_on solutions to three of the critical problems confronting the Greater Los Angeles area -- improving employment possibilities , curtailing crime and violence , and building community . By signaling the foundation ' s interest in these areas , top-quality researchers will realize the probability of being funded if they develop good proposals for problem-solving projects . Our organization is 67 years old . For the past 56 years , we ' ve attempted to add_to the knowledge and understanding of complex social issues by focusing_on investigating and publicizing their causes . In recent years , we concluded that we could have greater impact if we included a solutions-oriented component and become more pro-active . Accordingly , we developed the Solutions Research Program , adding it to our General Research Grant Program -- through which we will continue to fund theoretical social-science research . Q . Why did you select employment , crime and community as topics for funding ? A . It was an interesting culling process , which took_place over a_couple_of years . These three seemed the most crucial . They kept recurring throughout our board and committee discussions as the Solutions Research Program was being developed . Curtailing violence and crime is arguably the most critical difficulty we face . The problem has reached crisis proportions -- and continues to grow , threatening lives and property throughout the region . The consequences of not reversing the trend are grave . The challenge is to abate the activity without eroding the individual liberties of our free society . Equally complex and extremely severe , the problems involving employment and the work_force are having a profound impact on the region ' s economy and leading to a population that is demoralized and suffering hardship . Corporate downsizing , rapid population growth , a technological_revolution and a labor_pool lacking required skills are part of an intricate equation that must be solved if we are to avoid regional poverty . The issue of community may be the central one . A significant portion of our population lacks any sense of common_ground or common values . People at the margin feel isolated , politically impotent and cynical . Angelenos need to experience community , empowerment and its concomitant responsibility . Defining the appropriate public-policy response to this society-shattering alienation would do much to resolve many of our other major problems . Q . What kind of impact will this project have_on companies and other foundations if you fund successful proposals ? A . Businesses should benefit . Reduction in crime should reduce the costs of doing business , while increased employment should stimulate spending . If the local economy is improved , new enterprises will be established and out-of-town concerns may be attracted to the area . And if the research we support does point to meaningful solutions which subsequently do influence policy , other foundations may become interested in seeking solutions in countless other areas .</TEXT>
