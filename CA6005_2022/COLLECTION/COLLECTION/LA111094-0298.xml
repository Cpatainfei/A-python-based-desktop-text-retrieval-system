   <HEADLINE> CONSERVATIVE INTEREST_GROUPS SAVOR WINS ; POLITICS : NRA TARGETED 24 RACES AND HAS 19 TROPHIES TO SHOW FOR ITS CAMPAIGNING . RICH RETURNS ARE ALSO CITED BY CHRISTIAN , ANTI-ABORTION ACTIVISTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After looking over the 1994 election field , the National Rifle Assn . drew a bead on 24 congressional and gubernatorial candidates . The NRA called them : &quot; The 12 That Gotta Go . . . and 12 We Gotta Have. &quot; Then the pro-gun group spent $ 3.2 million on television and radio ads , billboards , leaflets and direct contributions to elect their friends and obliterate the &quot; dirty dozen. &quot; In addition , it later deployed actor Charlton Heston in a television ad to help oust House Speaker Thomas S . Foley ( D-Wash. ) , a former ally . In the election aftermath , the NRA and some_other interest_groups that participated heavily in the election -- often through harshly negative television ads -- were reveling Wednesday in the rich return on their investment . The anti-abortion movement and the Christian Coalition were also claiming substantial yields as Republicans , including many conservatives , swept to enough victories to give them control of both the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years . Though only one of many forces in Tuesday ' s political watershed election , the 3.5-million member NRA made an impression in political circles that could again drive_home the value of its goodwill -- or the power of its ire . Overall , 19 of the 24 priority races went its way , and the next GOP-led Congress clearly will be more sympathetic to the NRA ' s position -- even as the public expresses widespread support for measures intended to curtail firearm violence . The NRA ' s inroads were especially sweet after it suffered major defeats in the 103rd Congress with passage of measures that impose a waiting period for handgun purchases and ban certain assault_rifles . The group said it felt particularly betrayed by Foley , who supported a crime bill that included the assault weapon prohibition . The Speaker was narrowly defeated this week after 30 years in office . The National Right_to_Life Committee , which spent about $ 1.5 million , also found many happy returns after seeing its agenda sharply undercut in recent years . It counted a net gain of about 35 House members and seven senators sympathetic to its anti-abortion position . Asked to compare these results to previous elections , political action director Carol Long replied : &quot; I ' m not sure this can be compared to anything because the results yesterday were so fantastic . Pro-lifers made terrific gains. &quot; The Christian Coalition , meanwhile , which was particularly active throughout the South and Midwest , said that 38 of 51 House seats that Republicans picked_up were won by &quot; candidates who embraced religious conservative themes and religious conservative activists. &quot; They made the same claim for eight new senators and seven new governors . In its most ambitious effort , the group distributed 33 million voter guides across the nation . Referring to the increased role of groups like the Christian Coalition and the NRA , Mike Casey of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said : &quot; Those folks have mastered the art of influencing federal elections . I would not be surprised if . . . a good 15 to 20 races were decided by right-wing , third-party groups. &quot; An example may well have been Georgia Rep . George ( Buddy ) Darden , a five-term centrist Democrat who was_on the hit list of the NRA and the Right_to_Life Committee and whose opponent , former U.S. Atty . Bob Barr , was embraced by the Christian Coalition . Darden lost by 52 % to 48 % in unofficial returns . To be sure , the conservative groups were hardly successful in all their high-priority races . And some opposing interest_groups question whether the contributions of these special_interests made a significant difference amid a national shift to the right that produced many lopsided contests . In Virginia , for example , Republican Oliver L . North -- who had the strong support of the NRA , anti-abortion groups and the Christian Coalition -- fell_short in his $ 20-million bid to oust Democratic Sen . Charles S . Robb . In turn , North ' s hopes may have been hurt by a shrewd eleventh-hour move by a single-interest group on Robb ' s behalf . Two weeks before the election , Robb ' s campaign called the National Abortion Reproductive Rights Action League to express concern that independent candidate J . Marshall Coleman was cutting_into the Robb vote_in the senator ' s northern Virginia stronghold , a leader of the abortion-rights group said . The organization promptly blasted Coleman as &quot; a great pretender &quot; on the abortion issue at a well-publicized news_conference . Robb subsequently criticized Coleman ' s position in a television ad and NARAL reinforced its endorsement of Robb through telephone banks . Coleman won only 11 % of the total vote and did not hurt Robb as feared . The abortion-rights group , which spent $ 500 # 000 , also pointed to triumphs for key allies such_as Sens . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) and Frank R . Lautenberg ( D-N.J. ) . But overall , James Wagoner , the organization ' s executive_director , described Tuesday ' s results as &quot; a disaster. &quot;</TEXT>
