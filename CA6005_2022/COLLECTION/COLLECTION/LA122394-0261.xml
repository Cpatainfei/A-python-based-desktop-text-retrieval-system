   <HEADLINE> EUROPE ; PRIEST RALLIES POWERFUL TO AID PARIS HOMELESS ; FRANCE ' S LEADING CONSERVATIVES HAVE LEAPED TO JOIN ABBE PIERRE ' S LIBERAL CRUSADE WITH EYE TOWARD GARNERING LEFTIST VOTES IN COMING PRESIDENTIAL RACE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Next to Pere Noel , the most powerful man in France this week was a small , bespectacled , 82-year-old Roman_Catholic priest with wiry white whiskers and a wooden cane . His name is Abbe Pierre , and for 40 years he has been a tireless advocate for the poor and the homeless , badgering politicians and imploring the well-heeled to do more to help the less fortunate . But this week Pierre had the most important politicians in France leaping to join his crusade . It began after church Sunday , when the father staged his latest attempt to draw attention to the sans abri , people without shelter . He led a group of several hundred homeless protesters in a brazen break-in , seizing a vacant apartment_building in a fancy neighborhood on the Left_Bank of the Seine_River and turning it into their home . Since then , Pierre and his supporters have watched in surprise as the nation ' s most important conservative politicians , their minds fixed on the presidential elections next year and the large_numbers of left-wing voters without a strong candidate , elbow each other for the chance to help him . Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur , a front-runner in the presidential campaign , despite his as-yet-undeclared candidacy , welcomed a squatter delegation to his lush , cavernous office , where he promised them that the police will not try to eject them from their new apartments . That put the problem squarely in the lap of Balladur ' s chief rival for the presidency , Paris Mayor Jacques Chirac . Not to be outdone , Chirac went_on national television to declare the situation facing the homeless &quot; unbearable. &quot; And he promised to begin enforcing a 1945 law that allows the city to take privately owned vacant buildings and use them , temporarily , to house the homeless . Abbe Pierre wasn ' t convinced . While Balladur was &quot; a man with whom dialogue is possible , &quot; the priest predicted that Chirac would either renege_on his promise or carry it out dishonestly . &quot; We have seen him ( Chirac ) in action before , &quot; Pierre said . &quot; Once is enough. &quot; The newspapers of Paris have not failed to notice that the announcement by Chirac , a champion of business interests and virulent opponent of wealth redistribution , represented an about-face . Liberation , the left-leaning Paris daily , sneered at the mayor ' s political &quot; conversion. &quot; &quot; To squash Balladur , Chirac is ready to do anything , even to throw everything he ' s done for the past 20 years into a sack in the Seine , &quot; Liberation said . In fact , though , it is Abbe Pierre who has emerged as the consummate politician . The occupation of the apartment_building , which had been set for demolition , was a ploy that homeless advocates had used before , with modest success . But this time , the timing could not have been better . First , the country is awash in the warm , generous feelings of the Yuletide . But more_than that , the campaign for retiring President Francois Mitterrand ' s job has reached a crucial juncture , just four months before the elections . Jacques Delors , the Socialist_Party stalwart who had been leading all contenders in the polls , decided two weeks ago not to run_for the presidency . That left the devastated Socialists with no strong alternative candidate . So the race now is between Balladur and Chirac , like-minded men from the same conservative_party . If , as expected , the two emerge as the top vote-getters in the first round of elections in April , they will need votes from the left to win the runoff in May . * The man playing all this like his own Christmas tune is Pierre , a man sometimes called the Mother Teresa of Paris . Born Henri Groues , he adopted the nom_de_guerre Abbe Pierre , or Father Pierre , when he joined the_French Resistance during the Nazi occupation of World_War_II . After the war , Pierre served briefly in Parliament , using his salary to help the poor . He rose to fame on Feb . 1 , 1954 , when he launched a public appeal for money to help the homeless after the death from exposure of a woman who had been evicted from her Paris apartment for not paying rent . Today , opinion polls consistently list him as the person the_French most admire . The problem of the homeless has been growing in France , where more_than 3 million people are jobless . Social_service agencies estimate that as_many as 400 # 000 people are homeless and 2.4 million more are &quot; poorly housed , &quot; squeezed into the homes of friends or family . And Paris has more_than 100 # 000 vacant apartments , homeless advocates say .</TEXT>
