   <HEADLINE> JAPAN TO COMMIT $ 1 BILLION TO ASSUAGE ' PAIN ' OF WW II ; ASIA : FUNDS WILL BE ALLOCATED OVER NEXT 10 YEARS , PRIME_MINISTER SAYS . BUT SPECIFICS ARE LACKING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister Tomiichi Murayama formally announced Wednesday that Japan -- to &quot; face squarely &quot; its &quot; acts of aggression &quot; and colonialism -- will commit $ 1 billion over the next 10 years to a &quot; peace , friendship and exchange initiative. &quot; The program will be launched in 1995 , the 50th anniversary of Japan ' s defeat in World_War_II . It will seek to overcome the &quot; pain &quot; of the past and &quot; clear_up the future of the Asia-Pacific , &quot; he said in a statement read to reporters by Chief Cabinet Secretary Kozo Igarashi . But the effort , at present , amounts to more of a compendium of hopes than a program of action . Apart from the $ 1-billion commitment , the announcement said only that historical research by Japanese and foreign scholars , exchanges and support of international pushes for the advancement of women -- including vocational_training centers -- would be carried_out . No specifics were offered . Igarashi repeated the government ' s position that all claims against Japan from its former enemies have been settled by peace_treaties . He also said no official payments would be made to individuals . But he held_out the possibility that the government might help establish a private fund of as much as $ 100 million from which such compensation could be made . Whether to set_up such a fund , however , is still being debated , he said . Groups ranging from former British and Dutch prisoners_of_war to Korean and Filipino women forced to act_as sex slaves for Japanese troops have condemned Tokyo ' s refusal to compensate individuals . Murayama confronted the issue many times recently on a tour of several Asian_nations , where he offered numerous apologies for Japan ' s wartime conduct . The formal announcement of the plan for Japan to make amends was expected and officials said they were only awaiting the Socialist prime_minister ' s return home . &quot; Although there may be criticism of our plan , I hope people will give us a little more time to demonstrate our sincerity , &quot; Igarashi said . A Foreign Ministry official said the government still has not committed itself to decisions on atonement plans , even though Aug . 15 next year will mark the 50th anniversary of Japan ' s surrender . The diplomat told foreign correspondents that Murayama ' s announcement was timed to ensure that money for the program could be committed in the 1995 budget , which is now being compiled , even though details have yet to be worked_out . Conspicuously missing was any word on what Japan intends to do for Asian women -- as_many as 200 # 000 by unofficial estimates -- recruited as &quot; comfort women &quot; for Japanese troops during the war . Although more_than two years have passed since Japan officially acknowledged its responsibility for the sex slaves , Murayama offered only another apology and a declaration of hope to find &quot; an appropriate way &quot; for the Japanese people to express their regrets . Officials said other actions designed to make 1995 a year of reflection on the war will be taken later . These include some form of Japanese government consolation to victims of atomic_bombs dropped_by the United States on Hiroshima and Nagasaki .</TEXT>
