   <HEADLINE> Q &amp; A : STRONGER YEN FRAUGHT WITH ECONOMIC RISKS ON BOTH SIDES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The yen closed at 99.93 to the dollar in Tokyo on Monday , the first time the U.S. currency ' s value has closed below 100 yen since the modern exchange_rate system was established half a century ago . The dollar later rallied in New York back above the 100 level , but it is clear that the yen has enjoyed a record rise against the greenback . Here are some questions and answers about the yen ' s strength against the dollar and its potential effects . * Q : Why has the yen been rising against the dollar ? A : There is no single reason , but much of the yen ' s most recent strength has derived from Japan ' s enormous trade surplus with the United States . The inability of Japan and the United States to agree on ways to reduce the surplus has led the global foreign_exchange market to conclude that a more expensive yen -- in other words , a cheaper dollar -- is inevitable . * Q : How would a cheaper dollar help shrink Japan ' s trade surplus ? A : Theoretically , it means Japanese goods become more expensive in the United States because more dollars are needed to buy them , even though their value in yen terms hasn ' t changed . This is one reason why imported Japanese cars have gotten more expensive in the last few years . Conversely , it takes fewer yen to buy the same American goods in Japan -- making them more affordable . The net result is that Japan ' s trade surplus begins to shrink . * Q : Then why does the surplus remain so high ? A : There are a_few reasons . It takes time for currency exchange_rates to have an effect on trade flows . American exporters are only beginning to make significant cracks in Japan ' s insulated markets . Many Japanese exporters , attempting to keep their prices from rising sharply in the United States , have absorbed the blow of the stronger yen through lower profits . Others have moved their manufacturing operations to the United States , partly to bypass the exchange_rate problem . * Q : What are the risks of a higher yen and cheaper dollar ? A : For Japan , the risks are lower profits and sales for Japanese exporters , which could threaten the nation ' s recovery from its worst economic downturn since World_War_II . Moreover , if the Japanese economy stays in recession , consumers could be less inclined to buy imported products , even though those products become cheaper with the yen ' s rise . For the United States , a cheaper dollar discourages foreigners from investing in U.S. stocks and bonds . That has jolted Wall_Street and could ultimately lead to significantly higher U.S. interest_rates . That would help the dollar but make the cost of borrowing more expensive for American consumers and inevitably slow the U.S. economy . * Q : With those considerable risks , what are Japan , the United States and other countries doing about it ? A : On Friday , the United States led a multinational effort by central_banks to slow the dollar ' s fall by purchasing dollars on the foreign_exchange market , which reduced the supply . But the dollar fell anyway , signaling a deep-seated belief by global money traders that the U.S. currency is likely to weaken in coming weeks and months . In Japan , there is some belief that Japan ' s central_bank will lower interest_rates . That would make yen-denominated investments less valuable and theoretically could cause the yen to weaken against the dollar . But lower interest_rates can also hurt Japan by shifting investment to other countries where rates are higher .</TEXT>
