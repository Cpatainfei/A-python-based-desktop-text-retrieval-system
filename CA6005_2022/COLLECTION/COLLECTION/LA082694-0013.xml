   <HEADLINE> METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF : LOS ANGELES ; GARCETTI UNVEILS PROGRAM TO FIGHT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti on Thursday unveiled Los Angeles County ' s latest weapon against domestic violence -- a program in which volunteer lawyers , working_out of a police_station , will help victims of stalkers , harassers and batterers file for temporary restraining orders against their tormentors . The orders , which must be issued by a judge , prohibit aggressive and persistent estranged partners from going near the target of their harassment . Violation of the order can lead to immediate arrest on a misdemeanor charge under a law that went_into effect in January . If the order is violated again , the violator can be charged with a felony . &quot; We know we are not going_to stop all ( domestic ) violence with temporary restraining orders , &quot; Garcetti said during a news_conference . &quot; But it does stop many acts of violence. &quot; His office and the 1 # 400-member Women Lawyers of Los Angeles began developing the program in March , Garcetti said -- three months before national attention was focused_on domestic violence as a result of the O.J. Simpson case . Simpson is charged with the June 12 murders of his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman . Five years before those killings -- to which Simpson has pleaded not_guilty -- the ex-football great had pleaded no contest to misdemeanor spousal battery against Nicole Simpson . Lydia Bodin , the deputy district_attorney who conceived_of the restraining order program , said her office had filed 1 # 300 felonies and 2 # 500 misdemeanors in domestic violence cases in the year that ended July 31 . About a quarter of those cases involved restraining orders , she said . Under the new program , which began Thursday at the LAPD ' s Southwest station , 10 lawyers are available to help people process restraining orders free_of charge . The program will be expanded to other stations when more volunteer lawyers are recruited , Garcetti said .</TEXT>
