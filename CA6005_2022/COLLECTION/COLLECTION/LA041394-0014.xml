   <HEADLINE> AMERICANS WILL TURN AWAY FROM WAR BEGUN IN TRICKERY ; BOSNIA : IF THE ADMINISTRATION IS FINALLY READY TO INTERVENE , IT MUST COME CLEAN OR RISK LOSING THE PUBLIC ' S CONFIDENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Americans are justifiably proud_of their country ' s contributions to world democracy . They have every right , therefore , to expect the same standards from their own government . Yet the Clinton_Administration is shortchanging them on the vital matter of war in the Balkans . After an extraordinary series of conflicting statements from members of President Clinton ' s foreign-policy team , the Administration has thrown itself into the Bosnian fray . Claiming that it is acting_as a sort of indentured servant of the United Nations and NATO , it is promoting the U.S.-led air strikes on Serb positions outside Gorazde as part of the search for peace . In fact , a more honest interpretation would be that , if these strikes reflect a larger strategy and are not simply a short-term operation to demonstrate civilian control over the military , the attacks constitute an act of war that nails the American colors to the Bosnian Muslim side . Some will regard this as perfectly legitimate and long overdue . Fair enough . But subterfuge is an inauspicious beginning for a momentous foreign undertaking . It is all too reminiscent_of the sleight-of-hand involved in the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin Resolution that set the stage for Lyndon Johnson ' s Vietnam build-up . Now as then , the Administration is exploiting a pretext -- in this case , the alleged need to protect a dozen U.N. peacekeepers stationed in Gorazde but by official accounts far away from the shelling -- to mask more wide-ranging aims . Already , spokesmen are talking_about strikes on other towns throughout Bosnia . Official dishonesty played a major role in eroding public confidence for the Vietnam_War . If history is not to repeat itself -- this time probably as farce -- the Administration should come clean with the American people at a very early stage . First , let ' s look facts in the face . Military intervention in a civil_war on behalf of one side to the disadvantage of the other constitutes an act of war . In war , Americans kill other people and may be killed themselves . By admitting that this is what is happening in Bosnia , the Administration will alert the country to the seriousness of its purpose and prepare it for the long_haul . Second , wars are fought for reasons and aims . What are these ? The Administration has traced a very erratic course on whether American interests are involved in Bosnia . The time has come_to let the American public into the secret of why , after more_than two years of official vacillation and recent public disagreement , they should now support engagement in Bosnia . As for aims , what constitutes victory ? Preservation of a unitary Bosnian state ? A rollback of Serb gains to a specific proportion of Bosnian territory ? Protection of certain named towns and villages from falling_into Serb hands ? Once again , all these may be legitimate objectives , but voters need to be assured that the Administration has thought things through . Third , wars are fought to achieve victory with appropriate military means . A month ago , Defense_Secretary William Perry commented about the fighting in Bosnia that it &quot; still goes_on in ways that are difficult to influence with the use of air_power alone -- in particular the small arms , close combat fighting around many cities and villages in Bosnia. &quot; Does his advice still hold ? In which case , the logical_implication is that ground troops will have to be introduced at some stage . Will these be American , or have other countries volunteered their services ? Or -- shades of Vietnam -- is the military accommodating its professional advice to the political needs of the day ? Fourth , wars have unintended consequences . To date , there are few good things to say about the Bosnian conflict , but at least the worst fears of a wider regional conflagration have not been fulfilled . Is the Administration confident that its change of policy will preserve this relatively benign state of affairs ? Already , Russian rumblings , which call_on deeper resentments than can be assuaged by a soothing phone_call to Boris Yeltsin , fill the air . In time of war , the natural inclination of most Americans is to rally around the President . This in turn gives him the confidence of robust support when the going gets rough and victory seems elusive . But as Somalia showed , this support will evaporate overnight if people feel they have been tricked . The result then is not victory but defeat . The Administration may well have all_the answers to the questions above . But so far , its troubling decision not to lay out the full facts in public but instead to gloss_over the implications of its change of policy may come_back to haunt it and the country . The last thing that America needs is another foreign-policy debacle .</TEXT>
