   <HEADLINE> GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS : GLENDALE ; ONE-STOP CENTER TO OPEN FOR HOMELESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A coalition of Glendale charities and city officials has expanded its efforts to aid the city ' s homeless by opening a new &quot; one-stop center &quot; for the needy and reopening the city ' s only homeless shelter . The new center , at the Salvation_Army ' s Glendale headquarters , offers health screening , job information and help with welfare and Social_Security issues . Since it opened last month , the center has assisted about 30 needy singles and families . Meanwhile , the Glendale Cold_Weather Shelter , which provided meals and beds for several hundred homeless people last winter for the first time , will reopen Monday . &quot; The cold_weather program was very successful last year , &quot; said the Rev . Greg Roth of Glendale Presbyterian_Church , a member of the Glendale Task_Force on Homelessness . &quot; The volunteers who helped feed the homeless and staffed the shelter overnight were so surprised by the diversity of homeless people that came . &quot; The most common comment was , ' These folks could be my own children. ' &quot; The task_force was formed by local leaders in 1992 to begin tackling the problems of a homeless population estimated to number 260 to 360 people on any given night . The task_force studied the services available to the homeless from local charities and sought to fill the gaps , with a view to helping the homeless become self-sufficient . Its formation followed the release of &quot; The State of the Streets , &quot; a 1992 report by local charities that broke_down Glendale ' s homeless into categories : 50 % were &quot; temporary homeless &quot; who sleep_in motel_rooms or friends ' homes , 30 % were &quot; chronic homeless &quot; ( including drug and alcohol addicts , the mentally_ill and veterans ) , 10 % were frail elderly and another 10 % were found to be non-Glendale or transitory homeless . The task_force ' s first proposal was to open the winter shelter ; this past May , it proposed establishment of the one-stop center . Future projects may include new temporary and transitional housing and a homeless outreach program . Roth , who has worked with the city ' s homeless for more_than a decade -- even presiding over the funerals of 15 homeless people -- said he is glad that the problem he has been working_on for so_long is finally receiving serious attention . &quot; We ' ve come a long , long way , &quot; Roth said .
