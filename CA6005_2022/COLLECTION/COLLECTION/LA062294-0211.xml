   <HEADLINE> LOTUS SHARES WITHER ON WORD OF LOWER QUARTERLY RESULTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lotus Development Corp . shares lost more_than a fourth of their value Tuesday , as investors responded to the company ' s forecast of lower second-quarter revenue and profit . The stock closed_down $ 14.375 at $ 37 per share on the Nasdaq , a drop of 28 % . It was the most active issue on Nasdaq , with a volume of 12.7 million shares , compared to an average daily volume of about 1 million shares . After the close of trading Monday , Lotus announced that delays in new versions of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet and other office software had diminished its chances of meeting analysts ' estimates for the quarter ending July 2 . Lotus said it expects revenue between $ 230 million and $ 240 million , with earnings of 20 to 25 cents per share . Analysts had forecast profit of about 48 to 50 cents per share . Lotus has recently been trading_in the $ 50-per-share range ; shares had posted a 52-week high of $ 86.50 on March 18 . Analyst Charlotte Walker of Bear Stearns &amp; Co . said Tuesday that Lotus stock has been trading too high but that the company will probably rebound as it ships a new generation of its office software this summer . &quot; The software business is a commodity business now , so your business is going_to be affected by the products you ship . If you ' re late , you pay , &quot; she said . Jeff Tarter , editor of the industry SoftLetter newsletter , noted that the market for office software is saturated after more_than a decade of growth . &quot; There are not a lot of new buyers for spreadsheets and word_processors , &quot; he said . &quot; All the low-hanging fruit has been picked in those markets . The cost of selling this stuff has gone_up because it ' s hard to find those users , and they have to be lured in. &quot; In addition to its product delays , Lotus cited &quot; the fact that our major competitor is at the top of its Windows desktop product cycle this quarter. &quot; That is a reference_to Microsoft Corp. , the largest PC software company . Microsoft rolled_out new versions of office software over the winter . Walker said : &quot; What you hope will happen is that their new products -- which , by the way , are getting great reviews -- will help ( Lotus ) rebound , and you ' ll go_back and forth ( with Microsoft ) , back and forth. &quot; Of Tuesday ' s drop_in share value , Lotus spokesman Richard Eckel said : &quot; You ' re never happy about this type of reaction , but it wasn ' t unanticipated . Wall_Street rewards consistency , and as Wall_Street has shown before , if you deliver a surprise , you pay a price . But as we said ( Monday ) , we think this is a one-quarter phenomenon. &quot;</TEXT>
