   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / ALEXANDER COCKBURN : A SMIDGEN OF PERSPECTIVE ON D-DAY ; SO_MUCH OF THE HEROIC REMEMBRANCE DISREGARDS REAL HISTORY , INCLUDING RUSSIA ' S ROLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The June 6 , 1944 , D-day landing , quite aside from its relative weight in the defeat of Hitler ( 16 days after the Western Allies put five divisions on the Normandy beaches , the Soviet_Union launched an operation that destroyed 30 German divisions in 30 days ) , was a different event from the one being portrayed in celebrations of the 50th anniversary . For a sense of the grimness of that day , it ' s worth looking_at S.L.A. Marshall ' s &quot; The Soldier ' s Load , &quot; published by the Marine Corps Assn . Addressing the argument that since fear weakens a man , every extra ounce he carries will further drain him of muscular power and mental coordination , Marshall wrote : &quot; In the initial assault waves at Omaha Beachhead , there were companies whose men started ashore , each with four cartons of cigarettes in his pack -- as though the object of operations was trading with the_French . They dropped_in deep holes during the wade-in , or they fell_into the tide nicked by a bullet . Then they soaked_up so_much weight they could not rise again . They drowned . . . the greater number were cast up_on the beach . It impressed the survivors unforgettably -- the line of dead men along the sands , many of whom had received but trifling wounds. &quot; Many soldiers felled with their heavy loads in the water lacked even the strength to keep ahead of the tide , which moved inland at the pace of a slow walk . Marshall concluded from his interviews with survivors that &quot; weight and water were the cause of the greater part of our losses at the beach. &quot; In 1984 , the 40th anniversary of D-day was hijacked by Ronald Reagan ' s PR_men as opportunity for martial posturings on the Normandy beaches by the old actor , whose closest actual contact with war was the percussion of a movie-set six-gun next to his ear ( though this didn ' t stop him from boasting later that he had witnessed the liberation of Auschwitz ) . Actual veterans were regarded_as mere stage props for the media blitz staged by Reagan ' s communications maestro , Michael Deaver . A Pravda correspondent sourly observed at the time that the President , &quot; having weathered the war far from the front_line , in the rear , travels_to the scene of the fighting , not so_much to dramatize the turmoil of war as_to exploit the glory of the dead. &quot; The same words could be written_about President Clinton , whose own in-house propagandists have been consulting with Deaver on how to manipulate the event to extort the maximum favorable exposure for their boss . A commander-in-chief who has been outmaneuvered by the warlords of Mogadishu and Port-au-Prince should have the modesty to keep_off the Normandy beaches and stay_at home . D-day itself was a sideshow in the defeat of Adolf Hitler . The war had already been won on the Eastern front by the Russians at Stalingrad and then , a year before D-day , at the Kursk salient , where the Russians mangled 100 German divisions . Compared with these epic struggles , D-day was a skirmish . The Russians , after all , lost 20 million men in the war with Hitler . The D-day landings had mostly to do with the postwar shape of Europe . The German general_staff bore this as keenly in mind as the Western commanders . Hitler ' s generals knew that the war was lost and the task was to keep the meeting point of the invading Russian and Western armies as far_east as possible . It ' s not fashionable these days to recognize that the Soviet_Union had the lion ' s share_in defeating Nazism . At the 40th anniversary , Reagan ' s people even doctored Eisenhower ' s June 6 Order_of_the_Day to omit reference_to &quot; our Russian allies. &quot; Were he still alive on some Argentine hacienda , the aged Adolf would be smirking with satisfaction at the shape of the world 50 years after the Normandy landings : a dismembered Soviet_Union ; his wartime puppet state of Croatia promptly recognized by Germany and then by the United States , thus precipitating the whole Bosnian crisis ; fascist renaissance in Italy , with President Clinton praising Italian neo-fascists on the eve of the D-day anniversary . These neo-fascists include Gianfranco Fini , who recently remarked that Mussolini was the greatest statesman of the 20th Century . The Fuehrer must be itching to get_on the phone to Chancellor Helmut Kohl to ask him how long it will be before Deutschland demands its lost Polish territories and Kaliningrad , a.k.a. Koenigsberg . &quot; In truth , &quot; Hitler mumbles as he wraps a blanket round his skinny shanks , &quot; I really did win the war. &quot;</TEXT>
