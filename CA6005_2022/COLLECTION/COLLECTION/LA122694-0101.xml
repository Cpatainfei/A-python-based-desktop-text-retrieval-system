   <HEADLINE> ATTACKS FROM CROATIA THREATEN TRUCE , BOSNIA CHIEF SAYS ; BALKANS : U.N. SEES NO VIOLATION BECAUSE SERBS FROM NEIGHBORING STATE ARE NOT A PARTY TO ACCORD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Serbs from neighboring Croatia attacked Bosnian government troops Sunday , and the Bosnian president warned that a day-old truce would collapse unless the assaults stop . The United Nations said the clashes were not violations of the truce , signed only by the Muslim-led government and Bosnian Serbs . But government leaders warned that the attacks by allies of the Bosnian Serbs could lead to wider fighting . &quot; If those attacks don ' t stop , I am responsibly stating that there will be no cease-fire and that our army will respond on other fronts , &quot; President Alija Izetbegovic told state radio . The Croatian Serbs , who are not bound by the cease-fire brokered by former President Jimmy_Carter , were attacking near Velika Kladusa , in the Bihac area in northwest Bosnia , U.N. officials reported . They were joined by Bosnian Muslim rebels who have been fighting the government for more_than a year . In another threat to peace efforts , Serbs in western Bosnia-Herzegovina declared a general mobilization &quot; because of danger of Croatian aggression , &quot; the Bosnian Serb news_reports said . Croatian army soldiers have joined Bosnian Croats fighting Bosnian Serbs in west-central Bosnia . The Croats and the Bosnian Croatians -- allies of the Muslim-led Bosnian government -- are not part of the cease-fire , either . Most of Bosnia , however , was calm Christmas , a day after the cease-fire began , U.N. officials reported . Spokesman Alexander Ivanko said there were 73 violations by the government army and 13 by the Serbs , but all were assessed as &quot; celebration firing &quot; because of the holiday season . The first phase of the cease-fire lasts until Saturday and is meant to give time to work_out a four-month truce . Izetbegovic said the second phase couldn ' t begin until peace came_to Bihac . &quot; We are warning that if there ' s no cease-fire , there will be no negotiations on the cessation of hostilities , &quot; he said . Negotiations for a lasting peace were already considered difficult because of disagreements over a multinational peace plan that the Serbs have repeatedly rejected . The Bosnian government has insisted the Serbs accept the peace plan before negotiations begin on a lasting peace . The Serbs want to start negotiating without accepting the international proposal .</TEXT>
