   <HEADLINE> FINAL CHAPTER AT OLDEST L.A. BOOKSTORE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It began in 1888 as a &quot; Church and Sunday_School Supply House &quot; in the small and distinctly unbookish pueblo of Los Angeles . It went_on to be linked to a 1920s Hollywood scandal as the last known whereabouts of a murdered film director . It survived six Downtown locations to become the city ' s oldest bookstore , cherished by politicians , movie_stars and lesser mortals for fine novels , good pens and expert advice . But that colorful history ended Tuesday as Fowler Brothers bookstore and stationery shop closed its doors forever . The 7th Street store had lost customers , as_many independent bookshops and office supply businesses have , to discount_chains . Retailing ' s decline along 7th Street -- with recent departures of Robinson ' s department_store and Brooks Brothers clothiers -- also hurt . And the store never recovered from disruptive subway construction just outside the window , its proprietors said . &quot; We kept hoping times would get_better again , &quot; said owner Siegfried Lindstrom , 66 , whose grandfather was one of the store ' s founders . &quot; But all you have to do is look outside and see all_the empty stores around here and see that is not happening now. &quot; His son Bill , 29 , who also worked_at the shop , said it has been losing money since 1990 . &quot; With the Crown and Super Crown stores on one end and Staples and Office Depot on the other end , business has been_on a gradual slide , &quot; Bill Lindstrom said , referring to the giant discounters in books and stationery . Those chain_stores may have some lower prices , but not the antique oak bookshelves and glass cases that Fowler Brothers moved from previous sites to its last location in 1975 . Chains may have huge stacks of bestsellers , but not the many obscurities found at Fowler Brothers such_as a guide for &quot; Woodland Walks in South-East England , &quot; textbooks for independent paralegals or road maps of Austria and Arkansas . Nor do most chain_stores display copies of customer registries dating_back to the turn_of_the_century . At Fowler Brothers , guest books from the 1920s show signatures from composer John Philip Sousa , author Zane Grey , aviator Charles Lindbergh and actors Tom Mix and Douglas Fairbanks . Customers in later years included then-governor and later Supreme Court Justice Earl Warren and presidential candidate Robert F . Kennedy . A particularly intriguing 1921 signature was from silent film_star Mabel Normand . A year later , Normand was a suspect in the unsolved murder of her friend , director William Desmond Taylor . On the night before Taylor was found shot to death at his home , both he and Normand had visited the bookstore . Taylor reportedly had bought two copies of &quot; Inhibitions , Symptoms and Anxiety &quot; by Sigmund Freud . &quot; Anybody who had anything to do with Downtown has gone_to Fowler ' s , &quot; said Doug Dutton , owner of Dutton ' s bookstore in Brentwood . Despite the toughening competition from national chains to independent shops like his and Fowler Brothers , Dutton said he was shocked by the closing . &quot; I ' m just sick about it , &quot; he said . Also saddened was science_fiction author Ray Bradbury , who credits the store for his marriage . He met his wife , Maggie , at the store in 1946 when she was a fiction salesclerk there . &quot; Every single person there was top quality . They all had high IQs and knew their own subject , &quot; Bradbury recalled . &quot; There are not that many bookstores left where you are going_to get that kind of service or that kind of intellect. &quot; The Lindstroms kept their decision to close fairly quiet because of an agreement with the liquidation company that is to auction the stock or hold a discount sale at a later date . Even the gold-leaf motto sign , hung high above the sales floor , may be sold . It quotes the 18th-Century British historian Edward Gibbon in proclaiming : &quot; The early and invincible love of reading which I would not exchange for the treasures of India. &quot; There was no closing notice posted Tuesday , no farewell bargains and no crowds of souvenir seekers . Only a private farewell party for the 15 employees and friends was planned . Customers flinched when they heard the going-out-of-business news . &quot; It ' s really a shame , &quot; said Terry Lewis , a loan officer at a nearby bank . She said she used to order specialized business books that she could not find anywhere else . That apparently was the case in 1888 , shortly after the bookstore opened on 2nd Street . According to family lore , one early customer was a grizzled prospector headed for the_hills and looking_for some books to take along . On the recommendation of John W . Fowler , the miner left with &quot; Ramona &quot; and &quot; Ben Hur. &quot; The store ' s fifth location , on 6th Street near Pershing Square , was a local landmark for 41 years and part of a celebrated Bookseller ' s Row . But as the row dried_up and Pershing Square declined , Fowler Brothers moved to 7th Street , which was supposed to become Downtown ' s shopping mecca . Business was excellent through the 1980s , until subway construction turned 7th Street into an obstacle course that discouraged shoppers , Siegfried Lindstrom said . Last year ' s opening of the Red_Line subway and Blue Line trolley station a block away was a hopeful moment , but new transit commuters were not enough to make_up for the many customers who lost their jobs in the recession , he said . &quot; Downtown used to be at the center of things , &quot; he lamented . &quot; Those days are gone. &quot;</TEXT>
