   <HEADLINE> BUSINESS PULSE / JOHN BRENNAN ; CONSUMER MOOD SWINGS WITH POLITICAL PENDULUM , POLLS SHOW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Consumer spending , say the experts , drives much of the nation ' s economy . So it ' s not surprising that economists , journalists and politicians hang_on those periodic measures of consumer sentiment handed_down from a number of sources . There ' s nothing magical about consumer confidence scores . They ' re taken from public_opinion surveys that regularly ask Americans about the economy and measure changes from poll to poll . Like the economic index periodically published by The Times , most polls ask about personal finances . They try to gauge the general business climate and the public ' s expectations , as well as feelings about current conditions . What motivates changes in confidence is still somewhat of a mystery , however . Over the years , surveys have done pretty well at predicting recessions and recoveries , but the psychology they track doesn ' t always conform_to &quot; hard &quot; economic data . On paper , for example , the 1982 downturn was worse than the one in 1980 , but the average American seemed to feel otherwise . The experts -- and President George_Bush -- declared the 1990 recession to be over in mid-1991 . The public begged to differ , and its persistent gloom helped deliver the White_House to Bill_Clinton . With Clinton ' s election , confidence jumped . It soured somewhat in mid-1993 but lately has been_on the rise . Many surveys , including those by The Times , are now showing a mood more sanguine than that of the last three years . One would expect to see some aspect of the economy -- interest_rates , unemployment or disposable_income , for example -- as the basis for these changes , but a comparison of Times economic polls over the last few years shows another , more surprising factor_in the recent mood swing : politics . Remarkably , the post-election rise in optimism seemed to have been tied to political_party loyalties as much as_to affairs of the pocketbook . Irrespective of income or financial status , Democrats were gloomier when George_Bush was in office ; they feel much better now . Today it ' s the Republicans ' turn_to have the furrowed brows , for all their relative affluence and security . The partisan character of consumer confidence is quite pronounced . In July , 1992 , a Times Poll found that 49 % of Democrats but only 30 % of Republicans felt the nation was in a serious recession . Asked if the economy would be better or worse in three months , the Democrats said &quot; worse &quot; over &quot; better &quot; by 26 % to 13 % . The result among Republicans in the survey : 31 % saw improvement ; just 12 % expected to see rougher times . Democrats in that poll reported lower incomes and less secure finances than the Republicans , so one might expect that would explain the difference in their answers . Not so . In fact , high-income and lower-income people were equally likely to call the recession serious . Party identity , regardless of income , seemed to make a difference . Fifteen months into Clinton ' s term , the pattern looks quite different from that of 1992 . As of April , the proportion of Democrats who feel we are in a serious recession is down 38 points from two years ago , to 11 % from 49 % . The number has dropped for Republicans too , but by just 18 points , to 12 % from 30 % . And now when Americans are asked if the economy will improve or get_worse in the upcoming quarter , 29 % of Democrats are optimistic and 9 % are pessimistic . Among GOP adherents , negative responses outnumber positive ones 20 % to 16 % . Almost equal shares of Democrats ( 52 % ) and Republicans ( 53 % ) now call this a good time to buy big-ticket items . Just before Clinton ' s inauguration , the Democratic number was 16 points lower than the Republican number on the same question . Are Democrats actually better_off under Clinton while Republicans take it on their high-bracket chins ? Stalwarts of both parties might make such claims . After all , 44 % of Republicans think they paid higher federal taxes last year , compared to 25 % of Democrats . But Republicans are no poorer than they were before Clinton and no less financially secure , either , according to the polls . Nor are Democrats more prosperous . Seven out of 10 Republicans say they have secure personal finances , compared to 57 % of Democrats . These numbers are virtually identical to those measured during the Bush_Administration two years ago , as are the household incomes reported . With their man in office , Democrats simply seem to feel better about things economic , irrespective of_their_own financial lots . Whether that is stimulating real economic activity is hard to verify , because things such_as retail sales and durable-goods orders aren ' t tagged by political_party . The positive aura among Democrats is definitely a part of the current rise in consumer sentiment . It remains to be seen if it can sustain itself should the challenges Bill_Clinton ' s presidency faces begin to take a toll .</TEXT>
