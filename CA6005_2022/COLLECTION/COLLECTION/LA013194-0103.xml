   <HEADLINE> PRO-RUSSIA CANDIDATE TAKES EARLY LEAD IN CRIMEA VOTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russian nationalist Yuri Meshkov became the first elected president of Ukraine ' s Crimean republic Sunday on a politically explosive promise to join the strategic Black_Sea peninsula with Russia , early returns showed . Although Meshkov has retreated in recent days from the position that Crimea should formally secede from Ukraine and become part of Russia , his election is likely to stir nationalist passions in both countries and raise the odds against Ukraine ' s promised surrender of its nuclear_weapons . With one-third of the ballots counted , election officials said early today that Meshkov , a 45-year-old lawyer , was winning 70 % of the vote_in a runoff against Crimean Parliament Speaker Nikolai Bagrov , who favors Ukrainian rule of the peninsula . Long a geopolitical prize and balmy seaside playground , Crimea was seized by Russia from the Turks in the 18th Century and transferred to Ukraine in 1954 , when both countries were part of the Soviet_Union . Ethnic Russians still make_up 68 % of its 2.5 million residents . Since the 1991 Soviet collapse , Russian nationalists have campaigned to regain the fleet and the peninsula , raising ethnic tensions among Russians , Ukrainians and Tatars in Crimea . Four political figures were assassinated during the two-month election campaign , including a fleet officer and two Tatar leaders who opposed Russian rule . Voters leaving the polls Sunday suggested that Meshkov had won not only by appealing_to fellow Russian nationalists but also by capitalizing on general discontent over Ukraine ' s soaring inflation . He promised that life would be better in alliance with relatively prosperous Russia . There had been little doubt about the winner since the first round of the election two weeks ago , when Meshkov outpolled Bagrov 2 to 1 in a field of six but fell_short_of an absolute_majority . Bagrov was hurt in the runoff by his Old_Guard Communist image . The biggest uncertainty of the runoff was Meshkov ' s exact position on Crimea ' s political status and what would happen if he tried to change its status . While Russian leaders kept silent , Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk warned on Jan . 20 that he will overrule any move to redraw Ukraine ' s borders . After some waffling , Meshkov said Crimean voters should decide their future in a referendum March 27 , when Ukrainians elect a new national Parliament . He said the question to voters would be : &quot; Are you for an independent Crimean republic in a union with other states ? &quot; On Sunday , the candidate further clarified his position as he voted_in the company of six bodyguards . He said his earlier calls_for secession were &quot; simple talk for the voters &quot; and that he favored only a currency union with Russia . &quot; There will be no confrontation , &quot; he said . &quot; We will not break_away from Ukraine. &quot; Still , Meshkov ' s foes believe that he will assert de_facto independence from Kiev , tempting a forceful showdown in which the Russian-dominated Black_Sea Fleet would come_to Crimea ' s defense . &quot; For six months , we ' ll have a war of laws , with Crimea adopting laws and Kiev rescinding them , &quot; said Vitaly Fesenko , a Ukrainian political activist in Crimea . &quot; Then we might have a civil war. &quot; Fesenko doubts that Ukrainian leaders will prevail . &quot; We ' ve sent them dozens of appeals_to stop what ' s happening down here , and they ' ve done nothing , &quot; he said . &quot; We feel betrayed. &quot;</TEXT>
