   <HEADLINE> TARGETING CANCER , MORALE AND QUALITY OF LIFE ; HEALTH : AT THE WELLNESS COMMUNITY OF ORANGE COUNTY , EMPHASIS GOES BEYOND MEDICAL TREATMENT TO ADDRESS NUTRITION , BUDGETING , EXERCISE AND ATTITUDE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In 1990 , Natalie Carlson was preparing to die . The 55-year-old Costa Mesa woman , who had bone_marrow cancer , had stopped her chemotherapy even though doctors told her that if she did so , she would only have six months to live . &quot; The chemotherapy was making me so sick I couldn ' t walk from the living room to the kitchen without getting_out of breath , &quot; she recalls . &quot; I was totally sick at least three weeks out of the month . I couldn ' t go anywhere or do anything. &quot; Carlson says she sat home and felt sorry_for herself for a long_time . Then she heard about a new cancer support network , the Wellness Community of Orange County , and screwed_up her courage to attend some workshops . What she really wanted , she says , was a way to help her die . &quot; I was looking_for something to help me get_through my final days , &quot; she said . &quot; Going there and listening , eventually I began to feel better . A lot of the girls had such an up attitude . They had things worse than what I had , but most of them were laughing. &quot; Today , having defied predictions of death and still without her regimen of chemotherapy , Carlson continues to socialize with fellow patients she met at the Wellness Community . At the Wellness Community , cancer patients meet to discuss life-and-death issues , to cry , to laugh . They learn all they can about cancer ' s effects on them -- and their attitudes ' effect on cancer . In workshops and guest lectures , they learn about nutrition , household budgeting and exercise techniques . The regular participant groups target the patients ' psychological needs and are designed to supplement , not replace , medical treatment , says Barbara A . McKone , program director . The Wellness Community represents a new sensibility in cancer treatment , health_professionals say . Where once the disease alone was the all-consuming focus of doctors and other health_care_providers , now the patient ' s overall morale and quality_of_life are increasingly seen as key to reducing the disease ' s morbidity . Addressing the patient ' s psychosocial , as opposed to just medical , needs is critical , says Steven Armentrout , a UCI Medical_Center oncologist and president of the Wellness Community ' s advisory_board . &quot; There ' s a huge amount of evidence showing that patients who are_active participants in support groups . . . have ( better ) tolerance of the side-effects of therapy . And a number of studies suggest their longevity is better as well , &quot; Armentrout says . Because of their full-time staff and daily operation , large programs such_as the Wellness Community are able to provide a range of services . The Wellness Community employs four full-time people and three part-time trained facilitators . There are 40 active volunteers . Its yearly operating_budget of $ 400 # 000 is raised from private sources ; there is no government money . Variety and flexibility are key to the success of the support groups , says Cary Presant , an oncologist and former president of the American Cancer Society in California . At his facility , the California Cancer Medical_Center in West Covina , Presant recently began offering a support group open only to breast_cancer patients whose chemotherapy has caused them to gain weight . * The Wellness Community of Orange County , which recently celebrated its fourth anniversary , is one of 13 Wellness Communities nationwide . Founded in 1982 in Santa Monica , the nonprofit , privately funded centers have helped about 14 # 000 cancer patients at no charge , officials say . Wendy Cummings is one such patient . After her surgery for a brain_tumor four years ago , Cummings , 32 , of Dana Point , didn ' t blame her friends for thinking she was back to normal . After all , she returned to work full time as a Los Angeles Fire_Department paramedic just five weeks later , and occasional headaches were her only symptom . &quot; People said , ' Oh , she ' s great . She looks fine , ' &quot; Cummings recalls . But she knew better . During the 12 1 / 2-hour surgery , doctors had found the tumor to be an anaplastic astrocytoma , which can be highly malignant . They also discovered it was inoperable . While her doctor took a wait-and-see stance , Cummings began to struggle with the life-and-death issues that descend on cancer patients . She headed to the Wellness Community , where she joined other patients in weekly discussions of recovery strategies and took workshops on journal writing , social adjustment and more . &quot; After the surgery . . . I had the normal reactions that people have when they find_out they have cancer , &quot; Cummings said . &quot; But trying to talk to friends my age was difficult , because no one in their late 20s wants to talk_about mortality issues. &quot; At the Wellness Community , she says , &quot; we talked_about the things people don ' t feel comfortable talking_about with their families . It ' s not that families don ' t want to ; sometimes they just can ' t. &quot; After eight months , Cummings was able to move_on , to &quot; graduate &quot; from the group with a better attitude and understanding of the disease and her relationship to it . * Achieving a true community of patients is at the heart of the philosophy at the Wellness Community . Participants are encouraged to avoid isolation and get_to know others who have already benefited from coping techniques . In the Santa Ana facility , in a light-industrial area off the Costa Mesa Freeway , about 100 participants comprise eight weekly support groups that meet in rooms decorated to resemble living rooms . The patients ' primary at-home care providers , usually spouses , discuss their own issues in three other groups , McKone says . &quot; We look_at cancer as a family affair , &quot; she says . &quot; Everyone has different coping skills , and some family members minimize ( cancer in the family ) , put it on the back burner , so the workshops focus_on caring and coping skills. &quot; Tears are common at the Wellness Community , but so is laughter , participants say . &quot; We laughed more_than we cried . It was just incredible laughing , &quot; said Cummings , who added that her group remained upbeat even though two of its members died . &quot; If people heard the amount of laughing going_on , and then found_out we were cancer patients , they ' d think we were nuts. &quot; Often participants become conduits for spreading news of breakthroughs in cancer care . One patient recently asked his doctor for literature on a new anti-nausea drug he had received along with his regular chemotherapy , McKone said . He shared it with his group , and , within a_few weeks , half the group had started on the new drug . Such networking can also educate professional care providers . Some physicians have told McKone that their patients sometimes bring them information on new therapies even before they read about them in their journals . &quot; Our members tend to become patient-active instead of just passive people who go_to their doctor and say , ' OK , fix me , ' &quot; McKone says . &quot; Here we encourage them to be in dialogue and combine the skill of the doctor with the will of the patient. &quot; Support group members often continue their relationships outside the Wellness Community . Some of the 50 volunteers are former participants , says Shirley A . Lorenz , executive_director . Two such volunteers , Marlene Gavelin and Jack Dwan , conduct weekly introductory meetings for potential new members . In part because the Wellness Community is not affiliated with any hospital or care group , patients are referred from a variety of sources , including UCI Medical_Center in Anaheim , the City of Hope , UCLA and USC . Participation has increased about 20 % a year . &quot; These care providers need options for when their patient leaves the hospital , &quot; McKone says . &quot; It makes them feel better if they know the patients have somewhere to go. &quot; Patients ' frames_of_mind vary widely when they enter the program , but they often make a transition &quot; from victim to victor , &quot; in Lorenz ' s words , as they progress in their groups . For patients like Carlson , the program helped renew a sense of life . &quot; The Wellness Community is the reason I ' ve done so well , &quot; Carlson says . &quot; I used to think_of death all_the time . Now I don ' t think_of it at all. &quot;</TEXT>
