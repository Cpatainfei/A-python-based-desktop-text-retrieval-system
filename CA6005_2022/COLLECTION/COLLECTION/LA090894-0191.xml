   <HEADLINE> IRAQ PINS HOPES ON STRATEGY OF COOPERATION ; MIDEAST : BAGHDAD USES DIPLOMACY IN AN EFFORT TO SHOW IT ' S A GOOD NEIGHBOR AND THROW OFF U.N. EMBARGO . EVEN CONTACTS WITH ISRAEL HAVE BEEN REPORTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an old hotel on a quiet , canal-side boulevard on the outskirts of town , a huge bank of video monitors is slowly blinking to life , their electronic eyes trained on what were once some of the most dangerous weapons-manufacturing plants in the world . Machinery capable of fashioning missiles that could plummet hundreds of miles into neighboring countries lies under the watchful gaze of 24-hour-a-day cameras . Chemical and radiation sensors pick_up data at plants once thought to manufacture chemical , biological and possibly nuclear_weapons . &quot; Nothing comes_close to it . It covers an entire country , &quot; said Dr. Guy Martelle , the American whose team installed the video system in July . &quot; It is one of a kind , the largest and first of its kind in the world. &quot; By the middle of this month , United Nations officials expect to have Iraq ' s long-range weapons-monitoring program in place , the keystone in a new strategy of cooperation and careful diplomacy that Iraq hopes will finally achieve an end or an easing of the economic sanctions that have closed_off the country since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait . Iraq , for years a blustery and begrudging partner to the world ' s attempts to forever dismantle its arsenal of weapons of mass destruction , has in recent weeks engaged in a kinder , gentler strategy aimed at reassuring the world that it is ready once and for all to live as a companionable neighbor in the Middle_East . If Baghdad ' s new promises prove genuine , analysts say , they could provide an important boost to the Middle_East peace process that so far has encompassed nations such_as Jordan and Syria , which have spent the last two decades verbally railing against Israel , but has ignored the one nation that less than four years ago launched long-range missiles against Israel and Saudi_Arabia and invaded Kuwait . In recent weeks , Iraqi officials have repeatedly signaled their readiness to recognize the sovereignty of Kuwait and privately have indicated they may even be prepared to accept the U.N.-drawn border with Kuwait , which until now they have steadfastly refused to do . Just as important , there are signs that Iraq is ready to re-evaluate its stance toward Israel . In several recent interviews , Iraqi officials emphasized that Iraq no longer has a grievance with Israel if the Palestinians have decided to come_to terms with the Jewish state . &quot; We are not a direct party in the struggle with Israel . We have had a stance since the early ' 70s that whatever the Palestine Liberation Organization accepts , we will not object , because it is their case and their fate , &quot; said Iraq ' s Parliament Speaker , Saadi Mahdi Saleh . &quot; We don ' t have any problems with the Israelis that we can sit_down and discuss , &quot; added the information minister , Hamid Youssef Hammadi . Israeli television reported last month that Iraq had delivered a message from a senior official , through a third_party , to Israel ' s ambassador to the United Nations , saying that Iraq no longer had a dispute with Israel . Both sides have denied any direct contacts , though the respected London-based Arabic daily Al Hyatt reported three secret rounds of talks between Israeli and Iraqi officials in Europe , and the Italian press said Iraq ' s deputy prime_minister , Tarik Aziz , met with Israel ' s Vatican ambassador during a recent visit . Aziz was also in Morocco , historically a premier intermediary between Israel and the Arab world because of its large population of Arab Jews , last month at_the_same_time an Israeli delegation was in Rabat to meet with the Palestinians . Diplomats in the Iraqi capital said it is overwhelmingly likely that at least some third-party contacts have occurred . Iraq ' s aim , they say , is to convince the United States that Baghdad could become a valuable partner in the peace process if the embargo is lifted . &quot; It ' s very logical . They want the sanctions to be lifted . They are looking_for contacts with the Americans . They know that if they improve relations with Israel , if they show they are not willing to undermine the peace process , they could be considered a partner , &quot; said one envoy . Diplomatic sources said there are reports that Iraq has sweetened the deal by offering to resettle about 800 # 000 Palestinian refugees from Jordan and Lebanon , potentially easing one of the major dilemmas of the peace process : what to do with the millions of Palestinians outside the West_Bank and Gaza Strip . Iraqi officials say it is too early to talk_about such steps . But they say they are ready to discuss the border with Kuwait , a key stumbling_block until now in any discussion about lifting the U.N. sanctions . So far Iraq has refused to recognize the U.N.-drawn border , which awards Kuwait some lucrative oil fields formerly in Iraq , in addition to most of the naval port at Umm al Qasr . Now Iraq is saying it is willing to hold talks directly with Kuwait or through Arab intermediaries to fix the border . European diplomats close to the negotiations say Iraq appears ready to recognize the border if it can win a commitment from the United Nations that the sanctions will be lifted . No one is ready to make such a tit-for-tat pledge . &quot; The danger is if you say that ( make such a promise ) , the Iraqis will do something else that will make_it politically impossible to lift the sanctions , like attacking the Kurds again , &quot; said one diplomat . &quot; The Iraqis want a package , a prior assurance that when they say ' We recognize the Kuwait border , ' sanctions will be lifted and there won ' t be any new conditions imposed . If they don ' t get that kind of commitment , as they see it , they will be giving_up a certain amount of political capital for no good purpose , &quot; said another envoy . &quot; But the problem is , they ' ve pretty much come_to the end of the road . They ' re not going_to get that assurance . They ' re not going_to get_it from the Americans , at least . &quot; So the key question now is : Are they going_to recognize the border anyway ? Or are they going_to start becoming more hostile to the U.N. ? &quot; In interviews last week , Iraqi officials attempted to emphasize their readiness to bury old scores with Kuwait at the proper moment . &quot; We don ' t have a problem in the sense the Americans think . We have recognized Kuwait as an independent state . We are cousins , &quot; said Saleh . &quot; We might get angry with each other , and yet we can come_to good terms later . The Arabs are like one nation , one family . We don ' t have a problem as far as the sovereignty of Kuwait is concerned , and we are ready to negotiate with the Kuwaitis ( on the border issue ) in the sense that each party will have its right. &quot; Already , Iraq has made important diplomatic gains by nearing closure on a deal to sell 12 million barrels of oil trapped in its pipeline through Turkey since the beginning of the Persian_Gulf crisis . Turkish officials , reportedly after leveling threats to cut_off American bases in Turkey if the United States did not accede , have won a blessing from Washington on a deal to allow Iraq to sell oil in the pipeline , earning 60 % of the proceeds , from which it would buy_food and medicine from Turkey . Under the deal , expected to win U.N. approval this month , Iraq would gain up_to $ 280 million . And unlike previous U.N. requirements , it would have a free hand in distributing the humanitarian goods itself . &quot; It ' s a one-time operation , &quot; said an official familiar_with the negotiations . &quot; But the significance for Iraq is psychological and political. &quot; Most analysts expect that the United Nations , when it reviews the Iraqi sanctions this month , will order at least a six-month trial run_on the new weapons monitoring_program , setting the stage for a showdown in March . &quot; we ' ll need about six months to see whether it will function in the long-term perspective , &quot; said Goren Wallen , the retired Swedish admiral who heads the monitoring operation . Located in the former Canal Hotel , the U.N. program is cloaked in secrecy . Wallen greets visitors at the gate and won ' t let them set foot inside -- part of the United Nations ' attempts to ensure that its unprecedented access to Iraqi defense secrets won ' t be shared with curious neighboring nations or anyone else . Murphy was recently on assignment in Baghdad .</TEXT>
