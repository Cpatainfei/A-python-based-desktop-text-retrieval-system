   <HEADLINE> CHANGING LIFESTYLES ; UZBEKISTAN RESTORES SAMARKAND TO BOOST NATIONALIST PRIDE ; AS CENTRAL ASIA EMERGES FROM ISOLATION , THE SEAT OF TAMERLANE ' S EMPIRE IS BEING TURNED INTO A TOURIST ATTRACTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Samarkand . The name evokes mystery and romance . Eastern writers long ago described this oasis city , set_in the midst of the deserts and mountains of Central Asia , as the Mirror of the World , the Garden of the Blessed , the Fourth Paradise . Until recently , few outsiders visited Samarkand , isolated as it was in the depths of the Soviet_Union ' s Central Asian empire . Today , parties of foreign tourists stroll around the &quot; Mirror of the World &quot; admiring the turquoise domes and blue-tiled mosques and minarets , and gaze on a sight once reserved for a_few rare and intrepid wanderers -- the distant prospect of the great turquoise dome and crumbling archway of the Bibi Khanum mosque and the glittering minarets of the Registan . As Central Asia emerges from its long isolation , however , that scene may change . It is becoming clear that hundreds of ancient buildings in Samarkand and the other historic caravan cities of Bukhara and Khiva are under threat both from natural deterioration and from heavy-handed Soviet-era restoration . The U.N. Educational , Scientific and Cultural Organization issued a status report on the region that presages a UNESCO program to help Uzbekistan look_after its three historic cities , with their wealth of ancient architecture . The report is highly critical of some of the restoration work already under way . Samarkand is no stranger to restoration . When Russia captured the city in 1868 , the great mosques and madrassas were already crumbling , assisted by tremors that often shake the area . Their decline continued until the Soviet government began restoring or rebuilding some ancient buildings , particularly during the 1960s and ' 70s . Soviet restoration re-created the beauty of some of this architecture , but closer inspection shows its limitations . Much of the decorative tile work has been replaced at various times . &quot; You can tell the difference between original tile work and the newer tiles because the color of the old tiles is better , &quot; a local guide said , pointing_out the darker , richer hues of some of the old tiles , which have not faded like Soviet-period replacements . Indeed , most of the buildings are showing their considerable age , and it is often difficult to tell which crumbling details are centuries-old and which are crumbling Soviet restorations only three decades old . Samarkand became a byword for Oriental splendor in the 14th Century when the conqueror Tamerlane -- or &quot; Timur the Lame &quot; -- made_it the capital of an empire stretching from Turkey to the edge of China . He sent architects and craftsmen here from all_over Asia to ensure that the city lived_up_to his great name . The Russians conquered Samarkand as their empire expanded rapidly through Central Asia in the 19th Century . After the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 , it was all but closed to outside visitors during much of the seven decades of the Soviet_Union . With the Soviet_Union now history itself , Samarkand is a prize of the independent republic of Uzbekistan , whose government is eager to promote the ancient caravan city as a tourist attraction , pulling_in dollars to fill the hard-currency reserves of a shattered post-Soviet economy . The city ' s fame also has another use for a government eager to create a sense of citizenship in a country that did not even exist until Josef Stalin drew its borders_on the map in the 1920s . Tamerlane and Samarkand are potent symbols well-suited for boosting the Uzbek nationalism that has become the official ideology replacing yesterday ' s communism . Tamerlane ' s name has been revived from Soviet obscurity to provide a new heroic father figure in place of Lenin , and the architects and craftsmen are at_work again in the conqueror ' s former capital . The jewel of Samarkand is the Registan , once the city ' s central market_square . The square is flanked on three sides by three imposing madrassas , or Islamic colleges , whose minarets , domes and high-arched facades are covered in elaborate decorative tile work of cobalt_blue and turquoise . One of the three , a 15th-Century madrassa built by Tamerlane ' s grandson , the astronomer-king Ulugh Beg , is now a hive of building activity . The 600th anniversary of Ulugh Beg ' s birth is to be celebrated this autumn , one of several such new national celebrations , and his madrassa , once a worn and crumbling ruin , is being virtually rebuilt for the occasion . At the other end of the long main bazaar from the Registan stands the Bibi Khanum mosque . Named after Tamerlane ' s Chinese wife , the Bibi Khanum was probably built to commemorate the conqueror ' s capture of Delhi . Its great turquoise dome and massive entrance portal once made_it one of the world ' s largest mosques . Long an imposing ruin , the dome of the Bibi Khanum mosque has been repaired and major rebuilding has been under way for years -- but only recently has the work speeded_up . The forthcoming UNESCO report , however , points_out some dangers facing Uzbekistan ' s historic architecture . One of the most serious problems is that most of the ancient buildings of Samarkand and Bukhara are suffering from rising damp . The ground_water in the cities has risen significantly in recent years , probably because of the increase of piped water , combined with poor drainage . Rising as high as nine feet in the ancient brick walls , the damp forms corrosive acids and salts which gradually destroy the masonry , mortar and intricate decorations . A combined mosque and madrassa on the Registan , the 17th-Century Tilla-Kari , is under particular threat . The name Tilla-Kari , which means &quot; Covered in Gold , &quot; probably derives from the beautiful gilding on the inside walls of the mosque . The Tilla-Kari ' s problem with dampness has been compounded by a Soviet rebuilding of the mosque ' s dome in the 1970s . It was rebuilt with heavy concrete rather than the lighter original brick . This , says the UNESCO report , has caused a slow , uneven sinking of the foundations , cracking the walls . While the UNESCO report acknowledges the value of much of the restoration now being carried_out by the Uzbek government , it expresses concern for the historical accuracy of some of the rebuilding and decoration work , which it says is being done without sufficient knowledge of the original craftsmanship . Some of the rebuilding , using old Soviet methods , is actually harmful , the report says , citing such practices as the use of concrete and iron reinforcing rods to replace decayed brickwork . These modern materials are potentially corrosive and can damage the original bricks and tiles . The report particularly criticizes the rebuilding of a second story on the Ulugh Beg madrassa . The original was removed a_few centuries ago . The new work could damage the fragile ground_floor irreparably , the report says . The engineer in_charge disagrees . The structure is strong enough , says Egamberdi Nurulayev of Uzbekistan ' s Institute of Conservation and Restoration of Cultural Monuments . He says the UNESCO team &quot; follows the view that you should leave monuments ( ancient buildings ) as they are now , but our monuments are made of clay and brick and need constant repairs . If you want them as they are , you should build a glass dome over them. &quot; &quot; We want these places not only for tourists , but also to be used , &quot; he adds . Tamerlane himself has come_in_for some refashioning lately . The humble nomad who built an empire stretching halfway across Asia was seen in Soviet days as a ruthless conqueror who , by one estimate at least , caused the deaths of about 7 million people . The architects and craftsmen sent to beautify Samarkand were all captive labor , unable to leave . Now , however , he has been recycled for use as a national hero . His historical epithet , &quot; Timur the Lame , &quot; has been banished and the Karl Marx and Engels streets in Uzbek cities have given_way to Amir ( &quot; Lord &quot; ) Timur streets . Hero or barbarian , Timur today lies_in Samarkand , buried under a delicate fluted turquoise dome . While methods of preserving the ancient buildings of Uzbekistan still prove elusive , for now the architectural legacies still make a fine sight , recalling the words of James Elroy Flecker , which more_than any others preserved the myth of Samarkand for Europeans : &quot; Sweet to ride forth at evening from the wells When shadows pass gigantic on the sand , And softly through the silence beat the bells Along the golden road to Samarkand. &quot;</TEXT>
