   <HEADLINE> ASSISTED SUICIDE BAN IN WASHINGTON STRUCK_DOWN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Washington state law that bars physician-assisted suicide was ruled unconstitutional Tuesday on grounds that it deprives terminally ill patients_of personal liberty guaranteed under the 14th Amendment . In deciding a suit brought by a group of doctors and others who help terminally ill patients commit suicide , U.S. District Judge Barbara J . Rothstein said that &quot; a competent , terminally ill adult has a constitutionally guaranteed right . . . to commit physician-assisted suicide. &quot; Rothstein also wrote that she could not see the difference &quot; between refusing life-sustaining medical treatment , &quot; which is constitutionally protected , and &quot; physician-assisted suicide by an uncoerced , mentally competent , terminally ill adult. &quot; An attorney for the group , Compassion in Dying , called the decision voiding the law &quot; a tremendous victory &quot; and said that it should offer &quot; a measure of confidence to physicians who might want to provide physician-assisted suicide. &quot; The group offers counseling and instruction to patients who are considering suicide but does not provide the means for ending life . Dr. Richard Seaman , president of the Washington State Medical Assn. , said that the decision &quot; brings us very close to the slippery slope . Ethically , the doctor ' s role is taking_care of the living patient. &quot; At least 30 states have laws banning doctor-assisted suicide similar to the Washington law . Voters here turned_down an initiative in 1991 that would have made doctor-assisted suicide legal for terminally ill patients , as did Californians in 1992 . A spokesman for the state_attorney general ' s office said that it would decide in the next few days whether to appeal the decision . The judge ' s ruling came one day after a Detroit Recorder ' s Court jury acquitted Dr. Jack Kevorkian on a charge of violating Michigan ' s ban on assisted suicide in the death of a man with Lou Gehrig ' s disease . Unlike Kevorkian , who has been present at 20 deaths in Michigan since 1990 , no one in Washington state has gone public with their efforts to assist in suicides .</TEXT>
