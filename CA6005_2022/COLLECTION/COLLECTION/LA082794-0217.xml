   <HEADLINE> WEST VALLEY FOCUS : CONEJO VALLEY ; ORGANIC GARDEN CLUB FEEDS BOTH BODY AND SOUL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Vegetables are those ubiquitous objects that conjure_up a wide variety of thoughts and emotions -- from the dread of children to adults ' hope for a fountain_of_youth or a cure for their ailments . They have been a motivation for genetic research and a boon to the petrochemical industry . They are the inspiration of cartoon characters such_as Popeye . And vegetables are what brings the 50 members of the Conejo Valley Organic Gardening Club together for the common goal of growing their own produce without pesticides and chemicals . Darcey Lober , president , launched the club when she saw that other people had no gardens but were eager to grow their own fruits and vegetables . Lober grew produce in community gardens while she was living_in an apartment in Sherman Oaks several years ago . So she established community gardens on donated land in the west San Fernando Valley . Club_members meet on a regular basis and share organically grown seeds , surplus produce and information on non-chemical pest control and fertilizers , as well as philosophical thoughts on the problems of modern life . Members have different reasons for participating . Jane Rimer , a vegetarian from Agoura Hills , was looking_for good-tasting food . &quot; If you eat a lot of fruits and vegetables , they have to taste good , &quot; she said . Rimer has tried to have her own garden , but fires eight and five years ago removed all landscaping from her property . She attends the garden club meetings and tours and is able to supply her family with organically grown fruit and vegetables through the club . Patti Rose , another member , sees organic gardening as more of a philosophical question . Beyond learning how to grow crops without harming the environment or the human_body , Rose wants to become aligned with the natural_processes of the Earth . Her goal , she said , is to &quot; watch the birds in the garden and to understand the growth processes of plants . I want to understand the relationships between the weather , the plants and the soil. &quot; Rose heard about the &quot; crop swap , &quot; when club_members exchange surplus produce , and began to attend meetings . She had read extensively and gardened organically for 15 years , but found the firsthand information from organic growers extremely helpful . For example , Rose said , lectures by people growing herbs gave her new ideas about the market for herbs , what they are used for and the most effective fertilizers and pest-control techniques .
