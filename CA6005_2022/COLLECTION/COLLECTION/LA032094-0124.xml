   <HEADLINE> 5 YEARS AFTER EXXON VALDEZ OIL SPILL , ALASKANS ITCHING FOR TRIAL ; POLLUTION : OIL_COMPANY SETTLED WITH THE STATE FOR $ 900 MILLION IN 1991 , BUT OTHER CLAIMANTS REMAIN . FEDERAL SUIT STARTS MAY 2 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tides and times have been kind to Prince William Sound in the five years since the Exxon Valdez rammed a charted reef , dumping nearly 11 million gallons of crude_oil into pristine waters . Storms have scoured Alaska ' s 1 # 500 miles of polluted coastline , removing about half the oil embedded in some places . Many beaches look clean . Population forecasts for bald_eagles are good . The tourists are back . &quot; It ' s behind us , &quot; said John Manly , an aide to Gov . Walter J . Hickel , whose administration won a $ 900-million settlement from Exxon Corp . in 1991 . But it ' s not over for the people of Cordova , home port to Prince William Sound ' s commercial fishing fleet . Cordova fishermen are among the plaintiffs who filed damage claims in the wake of the March 24 , 1989 , accident . They are only just getting their day in court , and until they do , they will not turn the page on the Exxon Valdez . They blame the Valdez spill for bad salmon harvests over the last two years . They say they are just hanging_on , and that massive Exxon is trying to wait them out , an assertion the company denies . &quot; It ' s been a war of attrition , &quot; said salmon fisherman R . J . Kopchak , a former Cordova city councilman whose three-story house overlooks Cordova ' s dock and forested Orca Bay . A typical week ' s mail , stacked on Kopchak ' s kitchen_table , contains court notices about his lawsuit : More papers to sign , more documents to file . &quot; We know one guy , a fisherman here with a valid claim , who just quit sending_in his paperwork . Refuses to do_it anymore , &quot; Kopchak said as he scanned the foggy bay . &quot; The longer Exxon and its attorneys can make_it miserable for you , the greater the chance the settlement will be less. &quot; Kopchak is among fishermen who say this summer ' s salmon season could be his make-or-break year . If the run fails or prices are weak , Kopchak said he may have to polish_up his carpentry skills and move his wife and four young children somewhere else . &quot; I built this castle because I figured I ' d live and die here , &quot; he said . &quot; I really love this place . We don ' t lock our doors . We don ' t worry about our kids . The problem is , what I want to do is fish. &quot; Lawyers for Exxon , the world ' s largest corporation , reject any suggestion that delay is a tactic . Complaints have been separated into state and federal class actions , each with separate trial_judges , schedules and evidence rules . The federal suit , scheduled to start May 2 , includes 100 # 000 potential class members . Some estimates put the damages at $ 1.5 billion or more . A trial in state Superior_Court is scheduled to start June 6 and includes seven towns oiled in the spill ' s path . The mayors want compensation for municipal services they say were diverted in response to the spill . Other state plaintiffs include 13 Alaska Native corporations ; they claim damage to their land and archeological sites . Natives also sued Exxon in federal_court over damage to their traditional ways , which depend_on the sound for food . Evidence-gathering for all these actions has consumed the last five years . The company said more_than 5 million pages of documents have changed hands ; nearly 2 # 000 depositions were taken . A list filed by Exxon names 315 planned witnesses in the federal case . Plaintiffs plan to call 270 witnesses in a case scheduled to last all summer . Authorities will testify on marine science , land values , fish abundance and -- hardest of all -- whether there are any lingering effects of the spill . In Cordova , everyone wants an Exxon settlement -- even townspeople with no claim pending . &quot; We don ' t want to be known as the oil spill town any more , &quot; Mayor Margy Johnson said . Seated at a table in the restaurant of her dockside hotel , Johnson pointed_out a pair of sea_otters playing in icy waters where , in late February , the fishing fleet was still idle . Some Cordovans , hoping for a new image as a tourist town , say the city should adopt a new slogan . &quot; Sea_otter capital of the world &quot; has been mentioned . Johnson , a can-do businesswoman , wants action . Until it was abruptly canceled last week , she was helping organize Cordova ' s first &quot; Bury the Blues Day , &quot; scheduled for March 26 . The event , complete with a New Orleans-style band parading through town , was aimed at uniting the community . But organizers called it off when too many people complained they weren ' t yet ready to forgive and forget . &quot; For Cordova , the spill was like a death in the family , &quot; Johnson said . &quot; I ' m appalled that five years later there ' s still no settlement with Exxon . that ' s like trying to get_over a death when you can ' t read the will. &quot; Cordova , a town of nearly 2 # 600 on the sound ' s eastern edge , can be reached only by boat or plane . Nearly half the work_force is directly employed in fish harvesting or processing . State labor economists reported this month there was &quot; little prospect &quot; that salmon prices would bounce_back soon . Employment has receded over the last three years , sales receipts dropped and more_than two_dozen homes are_on the market , the state said . Real_estate_agent Linden O ' Toole -- among the only families to get_out of fishing , remain in Cordova and pursue a new occupation -- said she is fielding about as_many inquiries from out of state as from Cordovans looking_to buy . O ' Toole , who is supporting her fisherman husband and two small children , said earnings from real_estate have gone_to pay_off tens of thousands of dollars in fishing debts . &quot; I ' m hoping for our sake and a lot of people in this town that Exxon will come_through with a settlement , &quot; she said . &quot; They ' re a huge company . They don ' t need to hurt families like ours to do business. &quot; In 1990 , one year after the spill , the fleet turned_in a near-record pink salmon harvest and prices were good . Then , in 1991 , prices on the worldwide market collapsed and harvests were dumped back into the sea . The next two years , for undetermined reasons , the run failed . Last year , the Pacific_herring season , which typically begins in April and is the fishermen ' s first cash crop of the year , was cut_short in Prince William Sound when schools failed to materialize . Some fish were diseased . Last year , frustrated by Exxon ' s claims that the spill caused no ongoing harm , a mosquito fleet of 65 seiners gave_up the dismal pink salmon season to bottle_up the Port of Valdez , terminus of the trans-Alaska oil_pipeline . For nearly two days , no tankers could arrive or depart during the protest . &quot; I will never forgive and forget , &quot; said 42-year-old Doug Pettit , a Cordova fisherman who since 1987 has run a local heating-repair business to tide his family over the winter . &quot; It ' s as if someone murdered my daughter , &quot; he said . &quot; You can never forgive the person who did that. &quot; Pettit is an oil-spill domino . Since fishing has declined , he has worked harder at the heating company . But his neighbors are living_on savings and hopes for an Exxon settlement , and Pettit -- who also has an Exxon claim pending -- said he has gotten lenient on pricing . &quot; It isn ' t like you tapped a new resource , &quot; he said , taking a break one rainy morning as he coaxed heat from the pipes at the fishermen ' s union hall , in Cordova ' s downtown . &quot; You ' re still working with money from fishing . We all share the problem. &quot;</TEXT>
