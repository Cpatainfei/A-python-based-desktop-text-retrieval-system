   <HEADLINE> WALTER LANTZ , CREATOR OF WOODY WOODPECKER , DIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Walter Lantz , who emerged from the ranks of animation ' s early pioneers to build a multimillion-dollar cartoon empire and a respected worldwide reputation with the creation of an irascible woodpecker named Woody , died Tuesday morning . He was 94 . Lantz , who had worked in his office only a week ago , died at St . Joseph Medical_Center in Burbank of heart_failure , said his attorney , Ed Landry . In 1979 , four years after the last &quot; Woody Woodpecker &quot; cartoon was produced , Lantz was given a special Academy Award &quot; for bringing joy and laughter to every part of the world. &quot; It was during Lantz ' s honeymoon with actress Grace ( Gracie ) Stafford in 1941 at a lakeside cottage that Lantz found the inspiration for his most famous character . &quot; We kept hearing this knock , knock , knock_on the roof , &quot; Lantz told The Times in 1992 . &quot; And I said to Gracie , ' What the hell is that ? ' So I went_out and looked , and here ' s this woodpecker drilling holes in the shingles . And we had asbestos shingles , not wood . So , to show you how smart these woodpeckers are , they ' d peck a hole in the asbestos shingles and put_in an acorn . A worm would develop in the acorn , and a week later the woodpecker would come_back , get the acorn and fly away , letting_out this noisy scream as he flew away. &quot; Gracie Lantz suggested adapting the bird as a cartoon character , although her husband later admitted he was skeptical of its potential . &quot; I was doing Oswald Rabbit at the time and we were working mostly with animals . But I figured I ' d give_it_a_try , &quot; he once said . &quot; So I made a_few drawings , took the idea in to the studio and talked it over with some of the boys . Alex Lovy , one of my best artists , worked_on it , and Bugs Hardaway developed a story. &quot; The character , Woody Woodpecker , debuted soon after as a supporting character in an Andy Panda short , &quot; Knock Knock. &quot; It would become Lantz ' s most successful creation , spawning a lucrative source of global licensing royalties and making a multimillionaire of its creator . After the first three Woody cartoons were completed in the early 1940s , Mel Blanc , who had supplied the character ' s voice , signed an exclusive contract at Warner Bros . &quot; I shopped around , trying to find the right replacement , &quot; Lantz recalled in 1992 . &quot; We actually used the writer , Bugs Hardaway , for quite a while -- speeding_up his voice to a falsetto. &quot; However , it was Blanc ' s laugh -- preserved on a segment of film from Woody ' s debut -- that continued to be heard in most of the cartoons that followed and in a 1948 novelty tune , &quot; The Woody Woodpecker Song. &quot; That year , Blanc sued Lantz for more_than half a_million dollars , claiming that his original laugh had been used in subsequent cartoons without his permission . Although a judge ruled against Blanc , noting that he had failed to copyright his contribution , Lantz paid Blanc in an out of court settlement . In 1950 , Lantz was preparing another series of Woody Woodpecker cartoons at United Artists and needed a new voice . After being turned_down by her husband because Woody was a boy , Gracie Lantz taped her own audition and secretly added it to the other recordings . &quot; When we had the listening session , I didn ' t want to see the actors who were doing the voices , &quot; the artist said . &quot; So they ran some recordings and I picked one -- No . 7 , I remember -- and I said , ' Who ' s that ? ' And it was Gracie . She sneaked it in on me . I thought , ' Oh , God , no ! What are people going_to think if they find_out the producer ' s wife is doing Woody ' s voice ? ' &quot; Gracie Lantz provided Woody ' s voice and boisterous laugh in hundreds of cartoons until her death in March , 1992 , at age 88 . She initially declined screen credit for her contribution , thinking children would be disappointed if they found_out the voice was supplied by a woman . In 1958 , Walter Lantz spoke_of the character ' s unique personality . &quot; It ' s hard to think_of Woody in terms of paper and pencil , &quot; he said . &quot; He ' s quite real . . . a likable , mischievous little character . Youngsters often write to ask where he lives and what he eats. &quot; Lantz once estimated that each cartoon -- consisting_of about 5 # 000 drawings -- took nearly four months to complete . Although he was one of the few animation producers to provide his own financing , he said he had no interest in creating the kind of full-length epics Disney was known for . &quot; I ' ve never had a desire to make features , &quot; he once said . &quot; Very few outside of Disney ' s have ever been successful and his have come_to $ 3 ( million ) or $ 4 million apiece . Even with a one-shot deal , if you miss , you can lose everything you ' ve worked for for the last 40 years. &quot; Lantz stopped production of new cartoons in 1975 , though the short films continue to be reissued theatrically and broadcast on television worldwide . &quot; One reason they don ' t really date is that we use no puns or popular phrases of the time , &quot; he once said . &quot; Also , they are made_up of two-thirds physical and sight_gags and only one-third dialogue . This is a secret of their success in foreign countries too . Often we don ' t even translate the dialogue. &quot; The son of Italian immigrants , Lantz was born in New Rochelle , N.Y. He had an early interest in art as a child , completing a mail-order drawing course at age 12 . At 15 , he traveled_to New York City , where he worked for $ 7 a week as an office_boy at a William Randolph Hearst newspaper . After work , Lantz attended classes at an art_school . In 1916 , Morrell Goddard , who had created the nation ' s first color newspaper comic section , offered the aspiring teen-age artist a job in the animation department of Hearst ' s International Film Service under the supervision of director Gregory LaCava . &quot; I started_out on the camera when I was 16 , &quot; Lantz recalled in 1982 . &quot; Within three years I was an animator on ' The Katzenjammer Kids , ' ' Jerry on_the_Job , ' ' Bringing Up Father ' and all_the cartoons based on popular newspaper strips . &quot; We didn ' t know much about animation in those days -- everything was loose and rubbery -- but my studies at the Art_Students ' League had given me a good background in drawing the figure in various positions . I also used to project Charlie Chaplin ' s silent films , trace them frame by frame , then flip the drawings to study his motions. &quot; Despite the challenges of the new medium , Lantz said he and his colleagues were able to meet the growing demand for cartoon entertainment , developing many of the techniques still in_use today . &quot; We didn ' t have any animation cameras in those days , just Hearst-type newsreel cameras , and that ' s what we used , &quot; he said . &quot; They were like a big wooden box . No motors , just a chain and a crank . We ' d put the animation cel down and hold it down with a piece of glass and a lever . We ' d press the lever to smooth the cel out so it didn ' t have any wrinkles , set the exposure , turn the crank and make a picture. &quot; By 1922 , Lantz was working as a producer at the John Randolph Bray studio , supervising such characters as Col . Heeza Liar , Pete the Pup and Dinky Doodle in cartoon shorts that occasionally blended animation with live actors -- including Lantz . &quot; I was a terrible actor , &quot; he once said . &quot; I had four expressions. &quot; Four years later , Lantz moved to Hollywood , where he was briefly employed with Frank Capra as a gag writer for silent-film director Mack Sennett . In 1928 , after a friend ' s recommendation , Lantz was hired by Universal Film Co . head Carl Laemmle to oversee the studio ' s animation department . Lantz arrived just as a young cartoonist named Walt Disney was leaving , taking with him his idea for an animated mouse -- which Universal had rejected . Disney had left_behind a character named Oswald the Rabbit , which Lantz quickly redesigned and copyrighted . Beginning in 1928 , he created the first of nearly 300 cartoon shorts starring the loose-limbed rabbit . In 1930 , he made animation history by producing the first Technicolor cartoon -- the five-minute opening sequence of &quot; The King of Jazz. &quot; Lantz spent more_than a decade at Universal producing shorts starring Oswald and later , Andy Panda , before he created Woody Woodpecker . Among his many awards and tributes , Lantz was honored in 1959 by the Los Angeles City_Council as &quot; one of America ' s most outstanding animated film cartoonists. &quot; In 1973 , the international animation society , ASIFA / Hollywood , presented him with its Annie award . During the late 1970s , the New York Museum of Modern Art and Filmex in Los Angeles organized retrospectives of his career . In 1982 , Lantz donated 17 artifacts to the Smithsonian Institution ' s National Museum of American History , among them a wooden model of Woody Woodpecker and a storyboard from the character ' s 1941 debut . Museum officials credited Lantz with &quot; a truly profound accomplishment &quot; in producing 400 six-minute Woody shorts . On March 5 , 1986 , at age 86 , he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame . In 1993 , Lantz established an annual $ 10 # 000 animation prize and a scholarship in his name at California Institute of the Arts in Valencia . &quot; I ' ve been in this since I was 16 and I have done very well , &quot; he said at the time . &quot; I ' d like to do something for somebody else. &quot;</TEXT>
