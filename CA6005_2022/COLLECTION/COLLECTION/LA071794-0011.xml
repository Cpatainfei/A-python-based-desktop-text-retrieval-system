   <HEADLINE> FACTS WE CAN NEVER UN-KNOW ; THE EVOLUTION OF RACISM ; HUMAN DIFFERENCES AND THE USE AND ABUSE OF SCIENCE BY PAT SHIPMAN ( SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER : $ 23 ; 318 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Suppose , implausibly , that Charles_Darwin had never lived and nobody else had made his discoveries . Suppose that throughout the past century and a half we had remained ignorant of evolution , natural_selection and the common descent of human_beings and apes . Is it conceivable that the forced sterilization of 36 # 000 Americans in the name of racism and the discrimination toward and oppression of black people in South_Africa and elsewhere might not have happened ? &quot; What if ? &quot; history is rarely illuminating , but in this case it is pertinent because some of the most murderous racists of our century explicitly appealed_to scientific authority for their actions . Hitler ' s &quot; Mein Kampf &quot; in places paraphrases and plagiarizes the work of the biologist Ernst Haeckel , the man who championed Darwin in Germany and enjoyed great success as a popularizer of_his_own somewhat mystical and racist version of evolutionary theory . Nor , to quote Pat Shipman , was Nazi thinking &quot; simply foisted on innocent and reluctant scientists by evil politicians. &quot; Most German scientists were enthusiastic eugenicists long before the Nazis came_to power . The discovery that evolution works by the selective survival of superior strains in competition with each other had direct , vast and terrible political implications . It cannot claim to be free_of responsibility for the political abuse of those implications . And yet it is also a truth . Like nuclear_fission , natural_selection and genetic variation are powerful but morally neutral facts that we can never un-know . Yet it was precisely to un-know these facts that became the fashion in the late 1940s . Pat Shipman ' s book , after exploring the way racism and eugenics drew_on far-from-innocent biology in the 1920s and 1930s , then investigates how liberal political assumptions drove biology into a bizarre attempt to deny genetic differences among people after World_War_II . Beginning with the vicious arguments over UNESCO ' s Statement on Race , in which the anthropologist Ashley Montagu argued that race is &quot; not so_much a biological phenomenon as a social myth &quot; ( why can ' t it be both ? ) , this trend continued with the brutal ostracizing of the distinguished , if old-fashioned , anthropologist Carleton Coon in the 1960s for writing a book that investigated the biology , rather than the sociology , of race . Coon ' s book sounds not just insensitive , but wrong as well , to my ears . But Shipman defends his right to be wrong ; his motives were plainly above reproach . This leads into some difficult territory . In May 1962 , for example , Coon refused to allow the American Assn . of Physical Anthropologists , of which he was president , to vote on a resolution that all races were of equal intelligence -- not because he believed it was untrue , but because nobody knew if it was true or not and , in Shipman ' s paraphrase of his view , &quot; The truth was the truth and would remain so , silly resolutions notwithstanding. &quot; Wishful thinking will not make scientific truths more congenial to political virtue . Eugenics works -- dog_breeding proves it . In the 1920s there was nothing logically wrong with the idea that sterilizing the mentally_retarded would ( eventually and partially ) reduce the rate of mental_retardation , although there was a lot that was morally wrong with it . There is nothing logically wrong with the idea that human_races differ genetically from one another -- they do . It is racism , not race , that is wrong ; eugenics , not genetic differences . Shipman is uncompromising in her criticism of those who would prefer not to know what genetic differences among human groups are : &quot; Rather than face the monster , we have played instead at politicizing first evolutionary theory and then genetics . . . . We have fought each other . . . instead of fighting ignorance . In so doing we have given hate-mongers time to feed the monster . It has swelled on a steady diet of racial divisiveness , lies and half truths until it is strong enough now to destroy us all. &quot; A physical anthropologist herself , Shipman has written a courageous , thought-provoking and elegant book . To tell the stories of both prewar eugenics and the postwar taboo on letting the insights of genetics and evolution into the study of humanity , she examines the lives of participants in the debate , starting with Charles_Darwin himself . Extraordinary figures come_alive , such_as Rudolf Virchow , the formidable and brilliant mentor and opponent of Haeckel , and Ashley Montagu , the humble London Jew who renamed himself first as a British aristocrat and then as an American academic . It is a successful formula for such a book , and brings the dilemmas of politicized science naturally to the surface . Shipman ends her book with the story of legal scholar David Wasserman ' s innocent attempt in 1992 to hold a conference to discuss the legal implications of impending discoveries about the genetic basis of criminality : an admirable attempt to address a thorny issue before it arose . The conference was ambushed by political activists who saw it as part of a sinister campaign within the Bush_Administration to justify the forced sedation or sterilization of black youths . They argued that , however innocent Wasserman ' s intentions might be , he could not discuss the genetics of criminality without meaning the racial aspects of criminality , and that scientists must bear responsibility for the abuse of such discussions . Yet here , for the first time , Shipman ' s touch fails her . For , in making the argument that &quot; ignorance is never a solution , &quot; she misses a chance to go even further , and take_up the arguments of Wasserman ' s critics . Those who belong_to races that have been subject_to racism have a justifiable complaint to make against evolutionary biology , in my view . Evolutionary biologists have studied race , which is not a human failing , but they have not studied racism , which is . Human_beings are plainly equipped with an instinct to fear , dislike , denigrate and be violent toward people who appear to be from other tribes , bands or out-groups . Latent racism ( rendered patent by certain external circumstances ) is therefore part of our nature , just as it is part of chimpanzee nature . To argue thus does not for a moment justify prejudice , any more_than arguing that homicidal behavior in certain circumstances is part of human nature justifies murder . To design social brakes upon racism , as upon murder , we need to understand better what triggers the expression of the instinct . That requires biology as well as sociology . Let racists , for a change , be the laboratory rats .</TEXT>
