   <HEADLINE> TOKYO STOCK_MARKET POSTS HIGHEST GAIN IN THREE YEARS ; JAPAN : BELIEF THAT DIFFERENCES ON ECONOMIC_POLICY MAY SOON BE OVERCOME PUSH THE NIKKEI INDEX UP 7.8 % TO 20 # 229 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Amid one of the most powerful Japanese stock price surges ever , top leaders in Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa ' s seven-party ruling coalition Monday struggled to resolve sharp policy differences that have blocked agreement on economic stimulus measures . While the governing parties remain deeply split in their preferences on tax_policy , expectations that those differences will soon be overcome contributed to the sharpest one-day increase in_stock prices in more_than three years . The Nikkei-225 index shot_up 1 # 471 points , or 7.8 % , to close at 20 # 229 , the highest level since Oct . 25 . In terms of points , it was the third-largest one-day gain the market has ever seen . The jump was based on relief that the government had survived a crisis over political reform , and on belief that a massive stimulus package will soon be announced . In trading today , the Nikkei closed its morning session up 224 points at 20 # 453 . Hosokawa ' s Cabinet is_due to announce later this week a package of income_tax cuts and public spending worth at least $ 130 billion . There has been a fierce battle within the government , however , about whether the income_tax cuts -- which would make_up nearly half the package -- should be balanced by a consumption tax increase . The Socialist_Party , the largest member of the coalition , opposes any increase in the consumption tax , which is similar to a sales tax and currently set at 3 % . The Ministry of Finance has insisted that it would be highly irresponsible to do anything less than raise the consumption tax enough to cover the revenue losses from an income_tax cut . Most parties in the coalition favor cutting income_taxes first , then raising the consumption tax within one to three years . The argument is in part a debate over tax reform as opposed to economic stimulus . The Ministry of Finance is looking many years ahead , to the aging of Japanese society . Its belief is that part of the tax burden must be shifted from the declining number of people in their working years to free-spending consumers of any age . If tax cuts and increases are balanced from the beginning , that should be good for government finances , but the stimulative effect of the package could be seriously weakened . The Clinton_Administration , wishing to see Japanese economic_growth that would pull_in U.S. exports , has spoken out forcefully in favor of highly stimulative tax_policy and against the approach favored by the Ministry of Finance .</TEXT>
