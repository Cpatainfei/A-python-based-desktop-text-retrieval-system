   <TEXT> Kia Plunges In : Kia Motors America , the new Korean car importer with North_American headquarters in Irvine , is tackling the opposition head-on . One of its early commercials compares the company ' s only U.S. car -- the Sephia compact sedan -- to the Honda Civic and suggests that the big difference is that the $ 8 # 995 Kia costs a lot less.A stripped four-door Civic starts at $ 11 # 750 . That commercial has caused some complaints from commissioned sales people at the seven Honda dealerships that carry Kia as a secondary line . A manager at a San Francisco dealership told a trade magazine recently that customers often come_in and tell the Honda sales agents they want to see the Kias . Now Kia is tackling Chrysler Corp. ' s vaunted Neon . A Chrysler billboard campaign earlier this year showed a front view of the new compact sedan with the legends &quot; Say ' Hi ! ' to Neon. &quot; Kia has just put_up a series of billboards that feature a front view of the Sephia with the legend &quot; Say ' Bye ! ' to Neon. &quot;</TEXT>
