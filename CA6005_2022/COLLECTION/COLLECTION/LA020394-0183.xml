   <HEADLINE> METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF : UNUSUALLY DRY WINTER LINKED TO RETURN OF EL NINO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It isn ' t a drought yet , but if you think it ' s been a lot drier than usual this winter , you ' re right . During December and January , normally two of the wettest months , only 1.11 inches of rain fell on Los Angeles , compared to a normal total of 4.95 inches . The total so far for the season , which began July 1 , is only 1.93 inches , compared to an average total through Feb . 1 of 7.93 inches . Forecasters say it all probably has something to do with El Nino , the little-understood weather phenomenon that usually means more rain than usual , but this year apparently means a lot less . &quot; It ' s a very unpredictable thing , &quot; Curtis Brack , a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc. , admitted during a telephone_interview . &quot; I ' m not sure what to say. &quot; Last fall , one of Brack ' s associates , fellow WeatherData meteorologist James McCutcheon , noted that photographs from National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration satellites had confirmed a return of El Nino -- a reversal of the normal trade-wind patterns that cause the pooling of warm water off Peru . McCutcheon said that for reasons not fully understood , El Nino usually leads to a strengthening of the subtropical jet steam north of the Equator . When that happens , masses of warm , moist air off the east coast of Hawaii start drifting toward Southern California , bringing with them increasing chances of substantial rain . that ' s what happened last winter , when Southern California and Baja California were hammered by storms that caused disastrous flooding . When McCutcheon saw three months ago that El Nino was back , he saw a good chance of more of the same . &quot; If you had to make your wager right now , I ' d bet_on another wet winter in Southern California , &quot; he said at the time . Fortunately for McCutcheon , he ' s not a gambler . &quot; This year , high-pressure ridge after high-pressure ridge has been developing along the West Coast , blocking the storm systems from reaching Southern California , &quot; Brack said . &quot; El Nino supposedly is still there , but it ' s not doing what it usually does . This year it seems to be causing dry weather. &quot; Bruce Thoren , another WeatherData meteorologist , said Wednesday there could be a_few light showers here tonight and early Friday . Nonetheless , Brack is still optimistic about the prospects of rain in coming months . But even if this springs ' s rains don ' t amount to much -- and despite relatively little snow in the eastern High Sierra , source of much of the city ' s drinking_water -- continuing conservation and a surplus from last year ' s heavy rains mean Los Angeles will have plenty of water this summer , city officials say .
