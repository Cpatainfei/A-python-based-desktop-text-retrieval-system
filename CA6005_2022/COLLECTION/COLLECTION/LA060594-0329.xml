   <HEADLINE> FRENCH OPEN / WOMEN ' S CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH ; RAIN FALLS ON PIERCE ' S PARADE IN PARIS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The French were singing in the rain Saturday at Roland Garros Stadium , but they will have to wait until today to finish their ode to Mary Pierce . After waiting four hours for the sky to clear and the highly anticipated French Open women ' s final between Pierce and Spain ' s Arantxa Sanchez Vicario to begin , 17 # 000 fans were sent home when the match was suspended after 17 minutes . Pierce , 19 , hoping to become the first French women ' s champion in Paris since 1967 , was leading , 2-1 , and held a break point in the fourth game . The match is scheduled to be completed before today ' s all-Spanish men ' s final between Sergi Bruguera and Alberto Berasategui . Rain has not forced the men ' s and women ' s Grand_Slam finals to be held_on the same day since they started playing_on different days in 1979 . The last time there was a rain delay at any Grand_Slam event was at Wimbledon in 1989 . In 1973 , the_French Open men ' s final was postponed for two days because of the weather . That the_French Tennis Federation decided to start the match on a cold , blustery day was surprising . But it had more to do with the audience than the athletes . A brief statement said the match was started_out of respect for the public . Sanchez Vicario ' s coach , Gabriel Urpi , was asked if it was fair to play under the circumstances . &quot; You should ask it to the tournament ( officials ) , &quot; he said . &quot; If you look_at the interest of the players only , it is better to cancel the match. &quot; But if they had postponed it earlier , they might have faced another French_Revolution . Pierce , who has dual citizenship in the United States and France , has given women ' s tennis -- and the fanatical French sporting public -- a desperately needed boost the last two weeks . That much was evident as fans huddled in the foyers to stay warm while waiting for the rain to subside . As the day faded into a gray evening , the rain let_up and fans crowded into the Center Court stadium . When the officials and ballboys and ballgirls marched_out in preparation for the final , the audience stirred in its seats . Brightly colored umbrellas opened as a light mist sprayed the stadium , and a festive mood prevailed . But the players did not show . As the minutes passed , the Parisians started clapping , singing and , yes , doing their version of the wave . Haughty and upright Roland Garros started looking_like a football_stadium in Ohio on a cold November afternoon . They were placated briefly when Pierce went_to the players ' seats to converse with her coach , Nick Bollettieri . Knowing 17 # 000 pairs of eyes were_on her , she waved as she returned to the locker_room . Then , about half an hour after the umpires had taken their positions , Pierce and Sanchez Vicario walked onto the red_clay , following two ballgirls carrying their bottled water and drinks . And the noisy gathering became still when Pierce served the first game . After each point , fans urged each other to hush . Then the noise resumed when Sanchez Vicario served . The No . 2-ranked player had defeated Julie Halard of France on Center Court in a quarterfinal last week , so she said Pierce ' s strong following did not bother her . But it seemed as if it might do so on the damp , windswept court . Sanchez Vicario , playing in her fifth Grand_Slam tournament final , made 11 unforced errors and Pierce seven in their brief encounter . &quot; There is just nothing much to say about the match , &quot; Urpi said . At least not until today .</TEXT>
