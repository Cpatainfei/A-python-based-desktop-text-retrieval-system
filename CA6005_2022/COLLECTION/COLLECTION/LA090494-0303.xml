   <HEADLINE> INFRARED : WAVE OF FUTURE FOR COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS ? ; TECHNOLOGY : IRVINE COMPANY IS BANKING ON ITS NEW CHIP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Transmitting infrared signals is nothing new for officials at Irvine Sensors Corp . Most have been at it for years now -- for example , every time they change TV channels using a remote_control . Soon , though , such commonplace infrared waves may link computers with each other and with printers and other devices . Major computer makers , such_as Compaq and IBM , recently agreed on a standard method for such infrared transmission , and Irvine Sensors has produced a chip it thinks will be a major help in its conversion from a spy_satellite research company into a consumer electronics manufacturer . &quot; We ' re looking_at something that could be so prevalent , it will be_on every schoolchild ' s desk , &quot; said Irvine Sensor ' s Myles Suer . If his company ' s low-power chip -- called SIRComm -- captures a decent share of the anticipated market , it could mean tens of millions of dollars in revenue over the next several years . Not exactly a modest aim for a 14-year-old company that hasn ' t made an annual profit since it went public in 1982 . What ' s more , Irvine Sensors had been making rosy forecasts for several years now about an earlier &quot; breakthrough &quot; product -- a high-density memory_chip that is only now beginning production . Irvine Sensors is one of several manufacturers scrambling to supply the infrared transceivers that some industry_analysts expect will begin to replace , by next year , the cables that connect personal_computers with printers , keyboards and other devices . Industry officials generally believe about a third of the nation ' s 96 million households have a personal_computer , although a recent survey suggested the proportion of households is closer to 27 % . Because infrared waves have a higher_frequency than radio_waves , infrared isn ' t likely to replace either radio , cable or telephone_wires for communicating over distances longer than several feet away . But infrared will make_it easier for digital devices to talk with each other , particularly products made by different companies . Instead of plugging a PC into a printer , users with an infrared-equipped computer would be able to point it at another infrared-equipped device , as if using a TV remote_control . Infrared should also make_it easier for users to swap information between personal_computers , cellular_phones , pagers and even digital_watches that would be able to store phone_numbers , business_cards and short memos . &quot; The idea that you can go anywhere with a mobile device and not have to worry about whether you ' ll be able to plug_in , that ' s very exciting , &quot; said Suer , marketing director at Irvine Sensors . &quot; The usage can be impromptu , because the device can be ready ( to receive signals ) all_the time. &quot; * Whiz-bang though it sounds , about 75 manufacturers are currently working to develop infrared data transfer devices , or to integrate those devices on their machines . Those companies -- including market leaders Motorola , Intel Corp. , IBM , Apple Computer and Compaq Computer Corp . -- joined an association formed by Hewlett-Packard Co . last year to develop common methods for the transfer of data via infrared . Many of those companies plan to introduce infrared equipment on the computers and printers they will display at this fall ' s consumer electronics shows , said a Hewlett-Packard spokesman . Some products already include earlier forms of infrared data transfer , such_as the personal digital assistants made by Apple and AST Research Inc. , though most of these machines do not yet meet the new standard set by the Infrared Data Assn . Irvine Sensors is not the only company chasing this potentially lucrative market , however . Rivals like Crystal Semiconductor in Austin , Tex. , are many times bigger in terms of revenue , and have more experience selling electronic components in the commercial market . With wholesale prices for the infrared assemblies expected to be about $ 5 , profits will depend_on marketing efforts as much as on technological advantage , analysts said . &quot; The market will look_at these as a black_box . It doesn ' t really matter what an individual company makes as long as it fits and it works , and it ' s compliant &quot; with the new standard , said Ken Jacobsen , vice_president of marketing for Connexus Inc. , a consulting_firm in Fremont that helped organize the trade group . With the components ' standards already agreed upon , the technical knowledge of a single firm can &quot; only go so far , &quot; Jacobsen said , no matter how advanced its products . Yet even if infrared lags behind other technologies , such_as radio data transmission , infrared interfaces will still likely be added_to most machines , according to several analysts . &quot; It ' s so cheap , it will be a giveaway , &quot; said David Scott Lewis , president of Cellsys , a Van Nuys company developing products for radio networks that would link computers over longer distances than infrared . Shorter than radio_signals , infrared_light waves lie just past the red end of the visible_spectrum of colors . Television remote_controls using infrared signals to change channels were introduced about 15 years ago , and electronic stores carry the parts needed to send and receive a_few infrared signals . But using infrared_light to flip a TV on and off , or to change channels , is much simpler than transmitting data from a computer . Computers_store information , such_as a memo or a list of phone_numbers , in a complex sequence of signals . To send or receive a document via this new method , those signals must be translated into infrared_light , then retranslated to data by the receiving unit . Irvine Sensors ' chips are designed to smooth the retranslation process . Irvine Sensors gained its expertise with infrared after it won military research and development contracts_in the 1980s , including projects that were part of the Strategic Defense Initiative . The company first studied infrared during research meant to help orbiting satellites identify enemy missiles by spotting their heat signatures . * The military work also led the company to design stacks of high-density memory_chips to store computerized information in rockets and in other environments too demanding for standard memory systems , such_as floppy_disks . It also won similar contracts from NASA . Last month , Irvine Sensors began delivery of the first memory_chip stacks built for it at an IBM factory in Vermont . The shipments will give Irvine Sensors its first commercial manufacturing revenue , said John J . Stuart Jr. , the company ' s chief financial_officer . Together , he said , the infrared chips and the memory_chips are the beginning of the end of Irvine Sensor ' s reliance on defense contracts . &quot; There are a lot of little bits and corners that we ' ve explored , &quot; he said . &quot; Now we ' re looking_at what we know . . . that has the most immediate commercial applications. &quot; Increased revenue can ' t come too soon for the company , which lost $ 1.5 million for the fiscal_year that ended in October , 1993 . The company , with 45 employees at its Costa Mesa headquarters and about 25 more at the Vermont facility , has had revenue of about $ 4 million annually in recent years . The losses have not appeared to deter stockholders , who perhaps are cheered by the company ' s technical prowess and its contracts with IBM . From a low of 47 cents in 1992 , the company ' s stock is now trading between $ 7 to $ 8 . Its stock climbed to a high of $ 10 in the third quarter of 1993 . That spike in the stock price was linked to market expectations of revenue from IBM ' s Vermont production , said Lorraine Maxfield , a vice_president for research with Paulson Investment Co . Inc. in Portland , Ore . Despite its reputation for strong research , Irvine Sensors must now hope that it has guessed correctly about future demand for its chips , she said . &quot; Is ( the infrared chip ) just another weird military toy , or does_it have serious commercial uses ? &quot; Maxfield asked . &quot; They really do have some hard science there . They just have to show the market. &quot; Steve Andler , director of marketing for AST Research Inc. ' s mobile computing division , said many companies like Irvine Sensors pay_attention whenever standards are adopted . The challenge for those companies , he said , is balancing their technical know-how with the cost concerns of buyers . &quot; There ' s no way to predict whether the standard you emerge with is the best standard , ( because ) what you ' re dealing with is competitors trying to cooperate , &quot; he said . AST in Irvine will probably begin selling notebook_computers that meet the new standard around next January , Andler said , assuming that other companies who are not members of the association -- along with association members -- actually bring the products they have developed to market . &quot; We ' re participating because we think ( the Infrared Data Assn . standard ) is a valid standard . . . But if the printer people don ' t go_with it , if the fax people don ' t go_with it , then it won ' t catch_on no matter how good it is &quot; from a technical point_of_view , he said . AST also sells a personal digital assistant , called the Gridpad , which includes infrared data transmission , though it doesn ' t yet meet the new standard . AST will probably update the Gridpads to the new standards as well , Andler said . * Coping_with existing machines that do not meet the new infrared standard is a strategy that at least one of Irvine Sensors ' competitors is pursuing . Crystal Semiconductor plans to introduce chips that can handle signals from most existing devices as well as those that are compatible with association standards . Even when the new standard becomes commonplace , consumers who own existing infrared machines will still hope to make use of them , he said . Crystal officials think that even if the new standard wins out , it will take several years to be adopted , according to spokesman Wayne Alvarez . &quot; You ' re not going_to sell everybody a new telephone just so they can have infrared on it , &quot; he said . In the meantime , Alvarez said , he expects products probably will be introduced , perhaps with his company ' s chips , to allow such new peripherals to communicate with existing personal_computers . Irvine Sensors may also go_after that dual-use market , officials there said , depending_on the demands of vendors . &quot; You want to have the smallest ( infrared ) chip , so the cost ( to the manufacturer ) of fitting them into the product goes_down , &quot; said Irvine Sensors ' Suer . &quot; You want to have_the_best , for the lowest cost. &quot; Linking Up Via Infrared Irvine Sensors ' SIRComm chip allows laptop_computers and other portables to transfer data to stationary computers , printers and modems within one meter via infrared_light . How it works : 1 . User commands laptop to transmit data 2 . Data is converted to infrared_light pulses 3 . Detector in desktop_computer picks_up infrared pulses 4 . Chip eliminates signal impurities and converts light pulses into data . Process also works in reverse for transmitting desktop files to laptop . Other applications : * Sending laptop files to a stationary printer * Transmitting files to another laptop * Sending telephone_numbers stored in a cellular_phone to a desktop_computer Source : Irvine Sensors ; Researched by JANICE L .
