   <HEADLINE> STATE WON ' T ORDER DISCLOSURE WHEN DAIRY HORMONE USED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> State agricultural officials refused Monday to require dairy_farmers to disclose their use of a synthetic growth_hormone in milk production , saying there was no scientific evidence that the substance is unhealthful either for cattle or humans . Ruling against a coalition of consumer , environmental and some farmer organizations , state Agriculture_Secretary Henry Voss said the group had only presented editorials and opinions to support its request that the synthetic growth_hormone known as Posilac be classified in California as a restricted drug . Voss said it would be inappropriate for him to order a change in the classification of Posilac based simply on arguments presented by the coalition that &quot; are not supported by the scientific community. &quot; A change in the classification of Posilac , a growth_hormone injected in cattle to increase milk production , would have required the Department of Food and Agriculture to track all sales of the drug and to make its tracking logs available to the public . In recent months , as the use of Posilac has become more widespread , especially in Southern California , Consumers Union has led a campaign to require more disclosure . On Monday , Harry Snyder , the organization ' s West Coast regional director , accused the agriculture_department of ignoring provisions in state law requiring the tracking of any livestock drug that produces a hormone-like action . He said the law is an absolute and gives the department no latitude to decide that any particular hormone-like drug should not be restricted . While he acknowledged that none of the evidence so far shows that milk produced by cows injected with Posilac is unsafe , Snyder said some elements of its use are still untested . He said the hormone has been shown to increase the incidence of udder infections in cows , which in turn requires more use of antibiotics . He said a greater concentration of antibiotic residues can lower the quality of milk and produce an odd taste .</TEXT>
