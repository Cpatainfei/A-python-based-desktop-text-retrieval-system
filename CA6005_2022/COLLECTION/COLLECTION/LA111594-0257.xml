   <HEADLINE> PINKERTON LENDS EAR FOR WORKER COMPLAINTS ; ETHICS : THE ENCINO-BASED SECURITY GIANT OPERATES ALERTLINE TO HEAR EMPLOYEES ' ANONYMOUS REPORTS OF CRIME , SAFETY VIOLATIONS OR HARASSMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three years ago , tough new federal sentencing guidelines took_effect that drastically increased fines for companies found guilty of crimes such_as fraud . But the guidelines also created a powerful incentive for corporations to adopt ethics programs by reducing fines for companies shown to have procedures in place to detect criminal behavior and reporting offenses . Such was a business opportunity for Pinkerton Security &amp; Investigation Service , the Encino-based security services giant . In the past two years , business has tripled for Pinkerton ' s AlertLine , which provides a toll-free phone_service for employees to report anonymously on any unacceptable behavior or conditions in their workplace , including sexual_harassment , theft or safety hazards , according to T . Richard Elslager , Pinkerton divisional vice_president of AlertLine Services . Hundreds of companies ranging from manufacturing to entertainment to finance -- and from 25 to more_than 200 # 000 employees -- pay Pinkerton for its AlertLine services . Fees are based on the size of the company and how the program is customized for that business . For their money , corporations get literature and other educational materials to teach employees about company ethics programs and ways to help keep the workplace safe and free_of wrongdoing . The second major service is the 800 number that promises workers strict confidentiality in reporting their complaints or observations . At the division ' s offices in Charlotte , N.C. , Pinkerton operators man phones 24 hours a day , seven days a week , taking information from callers and filing detailed reports to the client companies . Pinkerton , with $ 772 million in annual revenue , is_best known for its guards-for-hire and other securities services . It doesn ' t break_out financial results for AlertLine . But with incentives continually increasing for companies to identify and deal with internal problems , Elslager said , &quot; I don ' t see interest in this type of service declining. &quot; The growth of Pinkerton ' s AlertLine coincides with a recent boom in corporate ethics programs . A decade ago , Gary Edwards , president of the nonprofit Ethics Resource Center in Washington , was unaware of any corporation that had an ethics office or ombudsman . But the center found in a study it conducted this year that one-third of the more_than 4 # 000 companies surveyed now have such an office . The vast majority of those ethics offices have some sort of &quot; safe reporting system , &quot; including phone hot_lines or help lines , Edwards said . Corporate ethics programs were born in the mid-1980s when large defense_contractors found themselves in hot water with the government for a variety of abuses . Defense giant General Dynamics Corp. , for instance , was among the first to set_up an in-house department to encourage ethical behavior . The trend spread to other industries and received a big boost with the 1991 implementation of the new sentencing guidelines . While Edwards also sees continued growth for help lines -- sometimes derisively referred to as snitch lines or rat lines -- he also believes that they can have limited value when provided by a third_party like Pinkerton . &quot; What they ' re doing is good , &quot; Edwards said of Pinkerton . But AlertLine &quot; is not sufficient by itself because it is not going_to provide help on the question of misconduct . You need the internal resources that understand the company , its products and its policies. &quot; Nynex Corp. , a big telephone_company with an award-winning ethics program , finds that 85 % of the calls to its GuideLine 800 number involve employees asking_for advice on issues ranging from potential conflicts_of_interest to personality conflicts , said Ann Whelehan , who heads Nynex ' s New York ethics office . In an era when the telecommunications industry is changing rapidly and lines are being blurred among competitors , customers and vendors , Nynex employees need constant guidance on proper conduct , Whelehan said . Pinkerton ' s AlertLine phone reporting service , by contrast , dispenses no advice to callers . It only reports the employee ' s concerns to the employer , who is then responsible_for any response . Michael Hoffman , executive_director of the Center for Business Ethics at Bentley College in Waltham , Mass. , said that many corporate ethics officers are strongly opposed to third-party hot_lines because they believe it defeats their goal of establishing trust between the company and its employees . Nonetheless , Hoffman thinks outside reporting services can be valuable to companies that lack resources to maintain a complete in-house ethics program . Elslager acknowledged that the Pinkerton AlertLine is &quot; one small component of a corporation ' s overall compliance program. &quot; But he sees AlertLine ' s third-party status as an advantage . Because it is a neutral , professionally run operation outside the company , he said , employees can have greater confidence that confidentiality will be maintained , and that confidence encourages employees to report problems . Also , he said , AlertLine is an around-the-clock operation , unlike many in-house corporate hot_lines that turn_on an answering machine after business hours . What ' s more , Elslager said , Pinkerton customizes its educational_programs for companies . For a retailer , for example , it might provide literature on how to reduce inventory reductions due_to theft or paperwork errors . About half the calls to the Pinkerton AlertLine fall_in the category of job complaints , Elslager said . Those include people unhappy with what they believe are unfair job reviews or conflicts with their bosses . The next biggest category is policy violations and theft , followed by substance_abuse and harassment claims , he said . The Pinkerton employees ask detailed questions , then prepare reports that are promptly dispatched to the company . The caller is asked to call_back on a specific date to let Pinkerton know if the_matter was resolved ; again , the information is passed_on to the employer . Pinkerton also encourages workers to agree to conference_calls with an AlertLine specialist and someone from the company who can address the issue .</TEXT>
