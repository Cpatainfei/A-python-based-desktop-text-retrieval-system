   <HEADLINE> IT ' S NO DUTCH_TREAT TO BE_ON THIS TEAM ; SOCCER : AS USUAL , THE NETHERLANDS ' WORLD CUP ENTRY HAS FALLEN PREY TO PETTY JEALOUSIES , RIVALRIES AND EGO PROBLEMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If any of the elite World Cup teams can be called a collective head case , it is the_Netherlands . With some of the world ' s most highly skilled players and a tradition of outstanding coaching , the Dutch should rank with Brazil and Germany among the perennial favorites for soccer ' s greatest title . Yet no matter how intimidating their roster looks , the Dutch always seem to fall prey to petty jealousies , rivalries and ego problems that erode team discipline and cause them to self-destruct . Four years ago , the Netherland ' s World Cup players staged a mutiny against Coach Rinus Michels , who took them to court in a vain attempt to preserve his control over the team . The team played with lackluster spirit in the 1990 Cup , showing little dismay when they failed to win a game . The Dutch record was one loss and three ties , including one against a clearly outmatched Egyptian team . This year , the players wanted the legendary Johan Cruyff to return from Barcelona -- where he has turned the Catalonian team into a European powerhouse -- to take_over as coach from Dick Advocaat . Just when the deal seemed clinched , Cruyff backed_out because of a dispute over a footwear and clothing contract . As a result , Advocaat will be launching his quest_for a World Cup title in the United States with a group of disgruntled players who have openly flouted his authority and expressed disdain for his tactics and strategy . It does not augur well . Nonetheless , the Dutchmen ' s hard-nosed approach and their devastating attack game always makes them a threat when they can set_aside their internal bickering and concentrate_on the match at_hand . The Netherlands managed to squeak_through one of the toughest qualifying rounds , which included England , Norway , Poland and Turkey . And they did so in the absence of two of their greatest players , midfielder Ruud Gullit and striker Marco van Basten , the only man in history to be named European player of the year three times . Van Basten , a magnificent forward who has been compared favorably to his mentor Cruyff , was one of the biggest disappointments in the 1990 World Cup in Italy , where he failed to score a goal in any of of the_Netherlands ' four matches . This year , he will not be able to play because of persistent troubles with his ankles and a slower-than-expected recuperation from surgery . With van Basten out of the picture , the scoring pressure will fall on Dennis Bergkamp . Less temperamental and more steady than van Basten , Bergkamp has been known as a diligent practitioner who has worked with Herculean dedication on his speed , footwork and ball-handling ability ever since he was discovered as a prodigy at the age of 12 by Cruyff . Since signing his first professional contract with Cruyff ' s former team , Ajax Amsterdam , Bergkamp , now 25 , has developed_into one of the best young forwards in international soccer . While less volatile than some of the other Dutch stars , Bergkamp is also known to have his quirky side that could leave him vulnerable to hothouse , pressure-packed situations such_as the World Cup . He refused foreign offers early in his career because he said he could not face the prospect of living alone in a foreign country . Even though he has gone_on to a successful career as a soccer mercenary with Internazionale in Milan , he is still judged by analysts to be rather shaky when playing_on foreign turf , away from the consoling inspirations of a hometown crowd . But the key to Dutch success in the World Cup this year will rest , as always , with its charismatic midfielder , Ruud Gullit . With his dreadlocks flailing and his precision passes riddling opposing defenses , Gullit can be a breathtaking &quot; free role &quot; player to watch . He and Bergkamp can be expected to provide some of the most spectacular two-man plays in the Cup games -- provided their heads and their bodies are up_to the challenge . Gullit did not go_through the qualifying round and is not scheduled to join the Dutch team until the middle of May . He contended that professional commitments in Italy kept him away from the national squad . But everyone in Holland seems aware that another principal reason for his absence lay_in his personal quarrel with the coach . Gullit was one of the first players to insist he would only play if Cruyff became head coach for the World Cup . Even though Gullit renounced his earlier vow and decided to play under Advocaat , it is still unclear whether they have truly patched_up their dispute and to what extent their personal friction will undermine team unity . Another question_mark remains Gullit ' s physical condition . He has recently incurred a serious back problem , compounding his history of knee injuries . Since 1989 , he has had four operations on his left knee and one on his right one . At the ripe old_age of 32 , it is difficult to know whether his legs can endure the grueling Cup schedule -- in the summer heat of Florida and the rest of the East Coast -- regardless of his renowned grit and determination .</TEXT>
