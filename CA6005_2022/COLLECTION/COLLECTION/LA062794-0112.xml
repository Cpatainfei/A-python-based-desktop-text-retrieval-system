   <HEADLINE> STAKE IN CASINO GIVES U.S. AN UNUSUAL HAND TO PLAY ; GAMBLING : SEIZED IN A DRUG CASE , BICYCLE CLUB MAKES MILLIONS FOR FEDS . BUT CRIMINAL PROBE COMPLICATES ISSUE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S._government owns a controlling interest in a neon-splashed casino hard by the Long_Beach Freeway that has reaped an estimated $ 25 million in gambling profits for federal agencies -- and a wealth of embarrassment . After seizing the Bicycle Club Casino four years ago in a drug money_laundering case , the government quickly found itself investigating alleged criminal activity inside a business it partially owned . While one arm of the U.S. Justice_Department oversaw the club ' s operations , another indicted the head of the casino ' s lucrative Asian games for allegedly engaging in loan sharking and extortion of some of the club ' s customers . The Bell Gardens casino also has run_afoul of the Internal Revenue Service , forcing the Justice_Department to pay its share of hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines . And to protect the government ' s interest in the gambling concern , officials approved use of casino revenues to finance a political_campaign against plans for a rival card club in Orange County . By all accounts , the government ' s intimate role in the Bicycle Club -- billed as California ' s Premier Gambling Palace -- is unique . The club was the largest single asset forfeited under racketeering laws when it was seized in April , 1990 . The government ' s protracted involvement with the casino runs counter to the intent of a system designed to quickly dispose_of assets seized from criminal enterprises . &quot; We don ' t want to run the Bicycle Club , &quot; said Robert Sharp , acting director of the Justice_Department ' s Asset Forfeiture Office in Washington . &quot; It ' s the opposite of what the government wants to do . . . . Our business is not to run card casinos. &quot; But disposing_of the property has proved to be difficult because litigation over precisely what share the government owns took years . &quot; Just because we want to ( sell ) doesn ' t mean it ' s possible , &quot; Sharp said . Sources estimate that the government ' s share of the casino could fetch more_than $ 30 million . In the meantime , records and interviews show , the Justice_Department has been receiving about $ 500 # 000 a month in profits from the cavernous casino about 10 miles southeast of Downtown Los Angeles . To safeguard its interests , the government now pays a former Las Vegas casino executive and his staff up_to $ 500 # 000 a year as trustee . The government ' s primary partner and the casino ' s longtime day-to-day manager is George Hardie , an ardent opponent of state legislation to impose tough regulation on California card clubs . He and Uncle_Sam are &quot; strange bedfellows , &quot; Hardie said . &quot; The problem with the government is ( that ) this is a new thing . Nobody has ever had an asset like this . Usually you get an airplane ( or ) somebody ' s house and they sell it . . . . Here they have an asset that ' s pretty unclear what to do with. &quot; * The government entanglement with the Bicycle Club dates to the drug heyday of the late 1980s . Even by South Florida standards , the case was notorious . Entire barges and shipping containers of marijuana had been smuggled boldly into New York , New Orleans and San Francisco . Later , while the alleged kingpin , champion speedboat racer Benjamin Barry Kramer , awaited trial , there was a daring escape attempt . A helicopter plucked the burly prisoner from the exercise yard of a Miami detention center , but could not haul him high enough and crashed into a fence . It took years , but the government established that $ 12 million of the smugglers ' profits were invested in construction of the Bicycle Club , then touted as the world ' s largest poker parlor . Michael Gilbert , the son of UCLA booster and prominent developer Sam Gilbert , was charged with funneling the drug money into the casino through banks and businesses . Sam Gilbert died three days before he , too , was indicted . In 1990 , after Kramer , his father and Michael Gilbert were convicted , the government seized the entire casino . Several months later , the government relinquished its claim to a partnership headed by Hardie that held 35 % of the casino because a federal judge determined he was not involved in the money_laundering . But the government pressed its claim against some_other Bicycle Club investors who allegedly knew that drug money was used to help build the casino . By last November , the federal_government had won a controlling 36 % interest in the club , including majority ownership of a second partnership , LCP Associates Ltd . For the law_enforcement officials in the U.S. attorney ' s office and the U.S. Marshals Service , ownership of a high-profile establishment in a controversial industry was at the very least a voyage into uncharted waters . &quot; There is a_level of discomfort , &quot; said Chief_Assistant U.S. Atty . Steven E . Zipperstein in Los Angeles . &quot; That is not the type of activity that law_enforcement agencies are_best suited to conduct. &quot; * The Bicycle Club is no back-room poker parlor . With valet parking and nearly 2 # 000 employees , it looks_like a bit of Nevada plunked behind a sound wall on the I-710 . Below billows of cigarette smoke , the nearly 200 green felt-covered gaming_tables bustle around the clock . Restaurants that cater to the club ' s heavily Asian American clientele lie just beyond Asian game tables , the most profitable part of the casino . Because of the complexity of those fast-paced games , the Bicycle Club contracted_in 1985 with a businessman , Hollman Cheung , now 42 , to run them . It was a big job with an income to match -- about $ 6 million a year , according to court records filed last year . But investigators got a glimmer in 1991 that Cheung may have been conducting more_than pai gow a nd super pan nine poker . An associate , Tony Wong , now 40 , had been arrested by Los Angeles County sheriff ' s deputies after threatening a Bicycle Club gambler who had borrowed money from Cheung and had not repaid the debt and interest , according to court records . In Wong ' s car , deputies found a loaded handgun , two sets of brass knuckles , an envelope containing copies of 20 checks , and a notebook with information on 37 people . Prosecutors alleged that the majority were Bicycle Club gamblers , employees or loan_shark victims . Wong pleaded guilty to three extortion charges and was sentenced in July , 1991 , to a year in jail and three years probation . Using information from the Wong case , the U.S. Organized Crime Strike Force convened a grand_jury investigation of Cheung and Wong . A secret indictment , unsealed this past March , charged them with 10 counts of extortion and conspiracy to &quot; loan money at usurious rates to people gambling at the Bicycle Club &quot; and &quot; use threats of force and violence to collect the loan payments. &quot; Two additional counts were filed against Wong for allegedly using and carrying a 9-millimeter handgun in the collection of a loan by extortionate means . Some victims were charged 10 % interest every three to five days , prosecutors said in court papers . One man was allegedly threatened over a $ 16 # 000 debt and forced to deed his home to Cheung until the money could be repaid . Cheung ' s attorney , Charles R . English , said his client has pleaded not_guilty . The trial is set for next month and English declined to comment on specific charges against Cheung . &quot; The plea speaks_for itself , &quot; he said . Prosecutors said co-defendant Wong is believed to have fled the country . After Assistant U.S. Atty . Marc R . Greenberg in Los Angeles argued that Cheung was a flight risk and might threaten or intimidate witnesses , a federal judge denied him bail . Cheung and his associates were barred from having any contact with those who had borrowed money . Cheung had been free on $ 500 # 000 bail for a separate New York indictment on conspiracy and racketeering charges related to gold bullion businesses that allegedly looted the investment accounts of customers . Assistant U.S. Atty . Jonathan Gerson said Cheung pleaded not_guilty . The government recently added a new count alleging that Cheung and an associate tried to burn_down a rival bullion business in Monterey Park . Another of Cheung ' s co-defendants is a onetime Bicycle Club worker convicted recently of possessing an illegal machine_gun . Cheung ' s last contract to operate the Bicycle Club ' s Asian games was terminated in March &quot; due_to his jail status , &quot; trustee records show . He had been under investigation since 1991 and was first indicted secretly in May , 1993 , but he continued to occupy a vital position in a business partially owned by the government . &quot; I find that to be unusual and unique , &quot; English said , &quot; that Hollman Cheung was making his living under the auspices of the U.S. government. &quot; Zipperstein of the U.S. attorney ' s office said , in response to a question , that the profitability of the club was not a factor_in delaying Cheung ' s removal from the casino . &quot; I am satisfied that no one in the federal_government turned_a_blind_eye to alleged wrongdoing for the sake of protecting the flow of cash , &quot; Zipperstein said . &quot; I am satisfied that the government has reconciled all_the various obligations thrust upon it. &quot; * The alleged criminal activity took_place from about April , 1987 , to about December , 1992 -- including the first 2 1 / 2 years of the government ' s involvement in the casino . At the time , the government ' s interest in the casino was overseen on a part-time basis by David A . Bass , the finance director for the city of Bell Gardens . Bass had been appointed by a federal judge in Florida to participate in major casino decisions and co-sign any checks of more_than $ 25 # 000 . Along with financial information on the casino ' s performance , Bass reported significant events to the court and the U.S. Marshals Service each month . The Times has sought for several months to obtain the trustee reports prepared by Bass , but government attorneys have refused to provide the material , saying the reports contain proprietary information that could be useful to competitors . The reports , Bass said in an interview , reflected various issues , including a $ 4.6 million fine levied by the IRS for failure to properly report large cash transactions involving more_than $ 10 # 000 . The reporting requirements are designed to detect and deter money_laundering . &quot; There is certainly no question that IRS has been investigating them , &quot; Bass said . Later , a knowledgeable source said , the fine was reduced to about $ 700 # 000 under a confidential settlement . Government officials refuse to discuss the settlement . But Hardie said : &quot; Sure they paid their share. &quot; The casino grosses almost $ 100 million a year . Yet trustee reports show that a government-commissioned audit in 1992 found &quot; unsophisticated cash management &quot; and other problems at the casino . Hardie disputed the audit , which recommended greater oversight of the club . When Bass resigned in 1993 to take another job , a judge named a full-time trustee , former Caesars Palace official Harry J . Richard of Las Vegas , &quot; to safeguard the interests of the United States. &quot; This year , Richard ' s budget is $ 500 # 000 , including a $ 200 # 000 annual salary for himself , plus expenses for legal counsel , and accounting and clerical help . On advice of his lawyer , Richard declined to be interviewed . * As the government ' s on-scene representative , Richard has become involved in major decision making , mundane matters and the minutiae that are important to maintain a profitable gambling concern . His monthly reports , covering everything from cosmetic changes to the casino ' s market share_in Southern California , are routed to federal_officials monitoring the club from Los Angeles , Miami and Washington . Through his reports , they learned to the penny how much could be saved by eliminating complimentary shrimp in the high-stakes Gold Room , dropping the casino ' s name from sugar packets , eliminating fresh flowers in the restaurant and changing from Coke to Pepsi . The reports also show that the casino was making hundreds of thousands of dollars in charitable and political contributions . The trustee reported last July that the casino ' s political donations in the first_half of the year more_than doubled as several communities , including Cypress and West Hollywood , voted on whether to allow card clubs that would compete with the Bicycle Club . &quot; These increases relate to efforts by the club to oppose the start-up of additional card clubs , &quot; Richard wrote . Political contributions are expenses of the casino , and as such reduce the club ' s profits , including the government ' s share . The former trustee , Bass , said that in previous years he approved making political contributions with the knowledge of government officials . &quot; My view was ( they were ) a necessary operating expense for the club , &quot; he said . Justice_Department officials refused to discuss the political contributions . &quot; I don ' t want to comment on that issue . Period , &quot; Zipperstein said . But in one case , government lawyers were forced to defend the practice in court . During a heated 1993 campaign over a plan to construct a rival card club in Cypress , owners of the Los Alamitos racetrack sued to stop the government and the Bicycle Club from contributing to the campaign against them . U.S. attorneys objected to the government being named in the lawsuit . &quot; Any owner of a business is obviously entitled to contribute for or against a measure on a ballot , &quot; they argued . An injunction sought by the racetrack to bar the government ' s practice was not granted , and the lawsuit was dropped after Cypress voters overwhelmingly defeated the card club proposal . While government officials refuse to discuss the government ' s total take during the past four years , they acknowledge that the casino has been profitable . The government has been receiving nearly $ 500 # 000 a month , according to Bass and recent trustee reports . Hardie , the casino manager , said : &quot; They ' ve already got_over $ 25 million in distributions from the club , plus whatever they get from the sale . It ' s been very beneficial to the government. &quot; The money goes_into the Asset Forfeiture Fund , which finances law_enforcement programs and pays operating expenses for the trustee . During the years of ownership , federal_officials said , they have had to walk a fine line , ever mindful of the impact of their actions on their partners , club employees and the city of Bell Gardens , which receives more_than half its budget from casino taxes . Yet another concern has been negative publicity , which one official said they feared could damage the card club itself , the value of the business -- and the sale price . Spurred by the Cheung indictment , officials said the time has come for the federal_government to get_out of the card club business . &quot; The fact that the government apparently has been making a profit is no justification for the government ' s continued ownership interest in the club , &quot; Zipperstein said . Timothy Miller , a supervising deputy with the U.S. Marshals Service in Los Angeles , said : &quot; We would like to dispose_of it as soon as possible . It ' s time-consuming on my part and a lot of people ' s part. &quot; Although about one-sixth of the government ' s interest remains in_dispute , officials have devised a plan to put the rest of the government ' s share of the casino up for_sale . The plan is awaiting approval from a federal judge in Ft . Lauderdale , Fla . &quot; There is a method , &quot; Miller said . &quot; A proposal for disposal. &quot; Uncle_Sam in the Casino Business More_than four years ago , the U.S._government seized a major interest in the Bicycle Club after the casino was found to have been built_in part_with laundered drug money . Since then , the government has received an estimated $ 25 million in profits . * Location : Bell Gardens * Slogan : California ' s Premier Gambling Palace * Employees : About 2 # 000 * Gaming tables : Nearly 200 * Revenues : $ 96.2 million for 1993 * Total profit : $ 23.1 million for 1993 * Government share : The United States claims a 55.6 % controlling interest in LCP Associates Ltd. , the larger of two partnerships that own the Bicycle Club . This gives the government a controlling 36.2 % share of the entire casino . Sources : Federal trustee reports , court documents</TEXT>
