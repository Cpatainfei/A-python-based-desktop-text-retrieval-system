   <TEXT> U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali said Friday that a peacekeeping force of more_than 15 # 000 troops will be needed to restore order in Haiti and recommended that the job be given to the United States and its allies . In a report to the Security_Council , Boutros-Ghali said the world body is not up_to the task of putting_together such a large force and proposed that the council authorize a group of countries to undertake the task . He did not explicitly appoint the United States to lead the mission , but diplomats at the United Nations said that was clearly his implication . Boutros-Ghali sidestepped the issue of whether the force would invade Haiti or wait for the leaders of the military regime to leave peaceably . But his proposal could make_it easier for the Clinton_Administration to invade Haiti , because it would give the United States a broad mandate for action from the Security_Council . &quot; This is basically the Desert Storm model , &quot; a Clinton_Administration official said , referring to the U.N. approval of U.S. leadership in the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War . &quot; The U.N. says go_ahead and solve the problem and leaves it to us to do it. &quot; The Administration did not offer any official response to Boutros-Ghali ' s recommendation , circulated privately at the United Nations and in Washington on Friday in_advance of its public release today . The secretary_general ' s proposal that the United States and other countries run the peacekeeping operation solves at least two diplomatic problems : * It lets U.S. troops make_up more_than 30 % of the peacekeeping force ; in a U.N.-led operation , a single country is normally limited to no more_than 30 % . But that guideline would have limited U.S. participation to 4 # 500 troops and required the United Nations to recruit 10 # 500 troops from other countries -- a task Boutros-Ghali said is impossible . * It lets the United States exercise direct command of the force , without going_through the United Nations ' sometimes balky chain of command -- a provision the Administration had requested . At the same time , Boutros-Ghali took pains to warn the United States -- and any other country that cares to join -- that the mission will not be easy . He said the force would need to operate in &quot; a disturbed and violent environment . . . for a period of unforeseeable duration. &quot; &quot; His message is : Don ' t think you can just get_in , knock ( Lt . Gen . Raoul ) Cedras out of power and then turn it over to the U.N. , &quot; an Administration official said . &quot; You ' ve got_to be around until we ' ve got democracy on track. &quot; In his 13-page report , Boutros-Ghali said : &quot; The situation in Haiti has deteriorated to an intolerable extent . The senior leadership of the ( Haitian armed forces ) continues to defy the will of the international community and to inflict murder , rape and torture on the unfortunate people of Haiti. &quot; He said a large peacekeeping force is needed &quot; after the departure of the senior Haitian military leadership and before the restoration in full of the legitimate government ' s authority. &quot; He said the operation would require a total of 15 # 610 personnel : 5 # 000 combat troops , including infantry , helicopters and special operations units ; 6 # 500 support troops , including military_police , intelligence and communications units ; 3 # 500 more combat troops in offshore reserve ; 550 civilian police , and 60 military trainers to retrain Haiti ' s army and police_forces . Once the peacekeeping force restores order , he said , the main body of troops could gradually withdraw , leaving the reserve troops and trainers behind . U.S. officials said this week that 15 countries have offered to take_part in a peacekeeping force . But Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher acknowledged Friday that the offers were made under the assumption that Haiti ' s military_leaders would step_down peaceably . They were not necessarily promises to join in a U.S. invasion , Christopher said .</TEXT>
