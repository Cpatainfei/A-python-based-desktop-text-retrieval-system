   <HEADLINE> WHAT ' S NEXT FOR BONDS ; WHILE SOME BAIL_OUT , OTHERS NIBBLE AT HIGHER YIELDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The worst bond selloff in seven years has left many conservative investors in a quandary : Even as they count their losses , they ' re also looking_at extremely enticing yields on fixed-income investments . If you can handle the risk , experts say , this could be a good time to shop for bonds and other income-producing investments . The surge in market interest_rates in the first_quarter sharply devalued older fixed-rate bonds and competing investments such_as utility stocks . That devaluation showed_up most prominently in bond mutual_funds , which hold more_than $ 700 billion of Americans ' savings . The average fund owning long-term U.S._government bonds tumbled 4.5 % in price during the first_quarter , according to fund-tracker Lipper Analytical Services in New York . However , because government_bond fund owners are earning interest at a 6.4 % annualized rate , on average , the funds ' &quot; total return &quot; -- interest earnings minus price loss -- was a negative 3.2 % for the quarter . In other words , interest earned during the three months helped offset some of the price decline . Still , that may_not be much consolation to former bank CD holders who converted those CDs to bond funds last year . Mutual_fund companies fear that many new bond fund owners weren ' t prepared to see any decline in their principal . Indeed , most fund companies admit that their bond funds are experiencing net redemptions by shareholders for the first time in more_than a year , as some spooked investors head for safer ground . Over the last two days , however , interest_rates appear to have stabilized . And many Wall Streeters continue to insist that rates have overreacted to worries about inflation rising in a strengthening economy . &quot; I think this bear_market ( in bonds ) is at least three-quarters cooked &quot; already , says William Gross , a veteran money manager at Pacific Investment Management Co . in Newport Beach . The yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury_bond has rocketed from 6.35 % at year ' s end to 7.24 % now . Shorter-term yields have risen even faster , in some cases . The five-year Treasury_note yield , for example , is 6.42 % now versus 5.20 % at year ' s end . Even if inflation is slightly higher this year than the 3 % annualized rate of recent years , current bond yields more_than compensate for that risk , Gross and other Wall Streeters say . Inflation is the chief threat to bonds , because it erodes the value of their fixed returns . Bond mutual_fund managers , trying to put the best face on the first-quarter debacle , also note that the deep price declines of some types of bonds and bond funds exaggerated the actual level of selling in those markets . Thinly traded tax-exempt municipal_bonds , for example , suffered some of the biggest losses in the quarter . But that was less a function of investors ' desire to dump those bonds than of panicked brokerages ' arbitrary decision to mark_down the prices of their bond inventories , regardless of buy or sell activity . Susan Peabody , whose Alliance California Municipal_bond fund has lost nearly 10 % of its value since year ' s end , said Wall_Street ' s perception is that &quot; when you go_through these phases_in bonds , everyone ' s a seller and there are no buyers. &quot; But in most bond sectors , the truth is that there have been few buyers in recent weeks , as interest_rates began to rocket and many players stepped aside . Now , however , yields have reached levels where some investors have at least begun to nibble again . And for good reason , bond pros say . &quot; In many cases the calendar has been rolled back a year or a_couple_of years &quot; in terms of yields available , says Theresa Havell , manager of the Neuberger &amp; Berman Limited Maturity bond fund in New York . What ' s the best strategy for income-seeking investors now ? Some ideas : * Stay with bond funds of intermediate term ( five- to 10-year maturities ) or short term ( one- to five-year ) . Their share prices decline less than long-term fund shares when market interest_rates rise . And with the recent yield surge , intermediate- and short-term funds may pay as much or more_than long-term funds did three months ago . * Buy Treasury_notes or bonds directly . If you ' re a buy-and-hold investor , owning an individual Treasury_bond means you can be sure of getting your money back at maturity , regardless of how its price fluctuates in the interim . In contrast , because mutual_funds are constantly trading bonds and have no set maturities , you may never recover a loss of principal in a fund if interest_rates continue to rise in the years ahead . ( However , a fund ' s yield also rises with market rates. ) Banks or discount brokers can help you buy Treasuries , if you don ' t have a broker . Or you can buy directly through the Federal_Reserve . * Look closely at tax-exempt muni bonds or funds . Because munis plunged so far in value in the first_quarter , their yields now are particularly lucrative . Peabody ' s Alliance fund , which owns long-term California munis , yields about 5.85 % now , up from 5.25 % at year ' s end . The current 5.85 % tax-free yield is the equivalent of a 9 % yield on taxable bonds ( such_as Treasuries ) for a Californian in the 34.7 % combined federal / state tax_bracket . For higher-income taxpayers , that taxable equivalent yield is even higher . * Look_for bond &quot; substitutes &quot; whose yields have risen with market interest_rates . Electric utility stocks , for example , have been hammered lower this year , sending their annualized dividend yields well beyond 6 % , for the most part . Utilities may no longer offer the same kind of annual dividend growth as they did_in the 1980s , but at current yields they may still prove to be decent long-term investments for risk-tolerant investors , some experts say . * MARKETS SETTLE_DOWN : For the first time in nearly two weeks , stocks and bonds did not take investors on an emotional roller_coaster ride , with the Dow Jones industrial average posting a slight gain and the 30-year Treasury_bond yield closing unchanged . D2 A Losing Quarter for Bonds Rising market interest_rates devalued older fixed-rate bonds in the first_quarter , which means bond mutual_fund owners saw their share prices fall . Here ' s a look_at the average price declines in key fund categories , compared with their average annualized yields . 03 # 23 , 25 # 18 Fund category 1st qtr . principal loss Annualized yield Short-term U.S. govt . -2.3 % 4.9 % GNMA -4.0 % 6.9 % Long U.S. govt . -4.5 % 6.4 % General muni -7.0 % 5.6 % * * tax-free return , which means true yield is higher .
