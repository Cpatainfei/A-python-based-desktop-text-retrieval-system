   <TEXT> In this land where the Nile has its uppermost headwaters , the brief , sudden African dusk had fallen on the rolling mountains , bathing them violet . On the breeze-swept veranda of his parish church and school , a Roman_Catholic priest nursed a lukewarm beer and voiced his dread . &quot; We live_in the fear of each day , &quot; he confided . &quot; When I consider history , and people ' s hearts , I am truly afraid. &quot; Just that Friday , he explained , members of Burundi ' s army had shot and killed seven people in cold blood as they traveled from Bujumbura , the capital at the northeastern tip of Lake Tanganyika , to the terraced slopes of Buhonga . In July , he said , the parish school ' s manager , a professor , two cooks and a driver were pulled from their car on a mountain road by soldiers , and slain just as pointlessly . &quot; Here , to meet the army is to meet death , &quot; said the priest , whose 85 # 000 parishioners eke a living from small banana plantations and subsistence_farming . &quot; But there is no one you can complain to about it . We are Christians , so we are waiting for the Last Judgment. &quot; Others in this remote , landlocked wedge of Central_Africa -- bedeviled by ethnic hatred , a colonial past and now , even by geography -- fear an apocalypse . In Burundi , &quot; We are at the brink of the chasm , &quot; said Tharcisse Nsavymana , president of Iteka , a human_rights group . Recent events in Rwanda , the country immediately to the north , have given pessimists much to worry about . In April and May , ethnically motivated massacres led to the liquidation of an estimated 500 # 000 Rwandans -- perhaps twice as_many as that . &quot; Since the catastrophe in Rwanda , the risk of a total conflagration in Burundi is_on everybody ' s minds , &quot; Nsavymana said . &quot; Not a day goes_by without a murderous attack here or there. &quot; But not everyone in Burundi is rushing , lemming-like , toward collective suicide . After protracted haggling , politicians from 10 parties last month signed a power-sharing agreement crafted to placate the powerful , wealthy Tutsi minority without renouncing the Hutu majority ' s democratic right to rule . That pact , and the election of a consensus president in late September , may halt Burundi ' s slippery slide into ethnic war . Or they may_not . For the single mightiest institution -- the 7 # 150-member Burundian army , air_force and national police , in which Tutsis hold virtually all command_posts , including the defense minister ' s portfolio -- possesses an effective right of veto , whatever politicians decide . In October , 1993 , in a still murky bid at a government takeover , renegade Tutsi soldiers arrested Melchior Ndadaye -- predecessor of President Cyprian Ntayamira , who died in an April plane crash -- and murdered him at the Muha army_base south of the capital . The attempted putsch and the assassination of Burundi ' s first democratically elected and Hutu president since independence in 1962 sparked massacres of Tutsis by outraged Hutus across the country . Within days , a savage campaign of repression was launched by Tutsi soldiers , police and groups of young unemployed thugs regrouped as self-styled militias . At least 50 # 000 people , Tutsis and Hutus , perished , Amnesty International estimates . But the outside world , absorbed by Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s army assault on hard-line members_of_Parliament in Moscow ' s White_House , the quagmire faced by the United States in Somalia and other events that autumn , was not paying_attention . That the army and the police , or gendarmerie , is still firmly in Tutsi hands rules_out any nationwide genocide of Burundi ' s minority population on a Rwanda-like scale . But it makes any attempt at democracy-building in this country a ticklish , even risky endeavor , indeed . &quot; The army is untouchable ; it doesn ' t want to hear about Hutus in the army . This is the principal problem in Burundi , &quot; said Emmanuel Mpfayukurera , 35 , a Hutu elected to Parliament last year on the list fielded by the Hutu-dominated party that Ndadaye founded , the Front for Democracy in Burundi . To understand how deep the ethnic divide has become , one must delve into the past of this tawny-colored , densely peopled land astride the crest dividing the watersheds of the Nile and the Congo . Like Rwanda -- where a blood bath erupted after the Rwandan head_of_state , along with Ntayamira , Burundi ' s acting president , were killed in a plane hit by a rocket April 6 -- the ethnic mix_in Burundi is 85 % Hutu , 14 % Tutsi and 1 % Twa , or Pygmy . The Tutsi-Hutu division -- the legacy of colonial rule and longstanding Tutsi economic , social and intellectual dominance -- gave this country a social order that Hutus like Mpfayukurera have no problem labeling &quot; black apartheid. &quot; The Twa , Burundi ' s diminutive , original inhabitants , were displaced starting in about the year 1000 by the Hutu , a stocky farming people of Bantu heritage . Beginning in the 16th Century , another migration occurred , that of the tall , pastoralist Tutsi from Ethiopia and Uganda . Gradually , the Hutu became subjugated into a feudal_system similar to that of Medieval Europe , with a loosely organized Tutsi aristocracy headed by a king . The Hutu relinquished their land and mortgaged their services to the Tutsi in return for cattle , the currency of wealth and social_status . The arrival of Europeans only consolidated Tutsi supremacy . Both Rwanda and Burundi were colonized in the 1890s by Germany . But Belgium easily defeated the small German detachments garrisoned here in World_War I . After the war , the League of Nations mandated Burundi ( then called Urundi ) and Rwanda to Belgium . The Belgians were only too happy to rule indirectly through Tutsi chiefs and princes , allowing them broad powers in return for tax_revenue . Even Christian missions , granted a monopoly on education , made the ethnic differences worse . They virtually ignored Hutus , commonly considered dumb , if hard-working peasants , and concentrated_on educating the &quot; nobler &quot; Tutsis . That colonial past , and the Tutsi mastery of independent Burundi that ended only with the groundbreaking democratic elections of June , 1993 , spawned a society as schizoid as the antebellum American South . Hutus make_up the overwhelming majority of the country ' s 5.8 million people . Yet one Hutu politician has calculated that Tutsis still hold all but 13 of the 228 judgeships . In the army , Tutsi supremacy is so strong that a majority of soldiers -- Tutsis -- are believed to come from a single province , Bururi , home to three Tutsi heads_of_state . For decades , Tutsis also held the bulk of the government-issued licenses for foreign and large-scale domestic trade , making_it easier for members of the minority to become rich . Most government functionaries are still Tutsis . One reason for such preeminence was a longstanding policy of what Hutus term &quot; intellectual genocide. &quot; Until the 1990s , they say , Hutu children used to have the letter u inserted before their names on school rolls , while Tutsi youngsters were marked with an i . When the time came_to choose children for higher education , those with the telltale u were systematically flunked or shunted into vocational or technical courses . &quot; The selection in education was intentionally such_that there was no Hutu intelligentsia , &quot; Labor Minister Venerend Bakevyumusaya says . As a result , only 1 # 000 Hutus have made_it through secondary_education , he estimates . In 1972 , one of Africa ' s fiercest ethnic wars drenched Burundi in blood after a large-scale Hutu revolt led to the deaths of more_than 1 # 000 Tutsis . That summer , the Tutsi military junta then in power responded by hunting_down and killing any Hutu with a formal education , a government job or a fair amount_of_money . In three months , an estimated 200 # 000 Hutus were butchered ; tens of thousands more fled to Tanzania , Rwanda and Zaire . In consequence , it is hard these days in Burundi to find a Hutu politician , Cabinet_minister or other leader older than the mid-30s . Africa , which mobilized on a continental scale to oppose racial discrimination in white-ruled South_Africa , seemed largely indifferent to this black-on-black carnage . The world ' s attitude then , and its general paralysis when faced with this spring ' s massacres in Rwanda , made a deep impression on Burundi ' s current leaders . In the words of one Bujumbura-based diplomat , Sylvestre Ntibantunganya -- the 38-year-old Hutu politician who succeeded Ntayamira as acting president after the April plane crash -- realizes with his entourage &quot; that no foreign power is going_to fly troops in here to save their skins . So they have to deal with the military and the minority. &quot; That acute sense of realpolitik has led the Front for Democracy in Burundi to voluntarily relinquish many of the fruits of its victory in the national elections held_in June , 1993 . Though the first democratic polling in Burundi ' s history gave it 64 of the 81 seats in the National Assembly and a landslide presidential margin for Ndadaye , the Hutu-led party has agreed to embrace the former ruling Union for National Progress and other Tutsi-led parties as partners in government . &quot; We won the elections , but we practically have ceded power , &quot; Mpfayukurera said . &quot; We ' re living with our head in the lion ' s maw , and he can close his jaws at any time. &quot; Under the Sept . 10 power-sharing accord , the Front for Democracy ceded 45 % of the ministerial posts to the Tutsi-led opposition . The premiership , for all intents and purposes , was also reserved for a Tutsi . Rival parties also agreed to create a seven-member state council to serve as a powerful check on the president . Ntibantunganya , a former National Assembly chief , was confirmed Sept . 30 as Burundi ' s president by a 68-1 vote of Parliament . As expected , the acting head_of_state was nominated as the consensus candidate by a committee made_up of representatives of the country ' s 13 political_parties , two bishops , a businessman and a union leader . In the end , eight of the 13 parties endorsed him . &quot; We have to heal the wounds , to get people to tolerate each other , to settle their differences , &quot; Ntibantunganya has said . The young Hutu leader knows firsthand how hurtful the country ' s ethnic discord can be . In last October ' s attempted coup , his wife was murdered by rebel troops who had come_to arrest him . The give-and-take that led to Burundi ' s power-sharing agreement and the broad support for Ntibantunganya ' s candidacy make some optimistic that ethnic reconciliation is_well under way . &quot; This is not Rwanda , &quot; U.S. Embassy spokesman Gordon Duguid observed . &quot; It ' s a difficult situation , but the prospects for democracy are good if a majority of the people can resist the extremists . They ' re the danger to the process. &quot; True , some Hutus have objected to the whole idea of power-sharing as a flouting of the bedrock notion of democracy , the majority ' s right to rule . Meanwhile , opposing Tutsis accuse the Front for Democracy of masterminding the October , 1993 , massacres . Some say that as_many as 200 # 000 Tutsis were slaughtered , while thousands of others fled their homes and now live_in camps guarded by the army . &quot; If we weren ' t afraid , we would n ' t be in the street , &quot; said Christophe Hicintuka , 40 , who marched recently through Bujumbura with hundreds of other Tutsi supporters of the hard-line Party for National Recovery , which rejected the power-sharing pact . But most alarming is the fact that as the politicians negotiated , the killings in Burundi continued , and continue even now . Even as members of the Parliament debated Ntibantunganya ' s election , grenades were tossed_in Bujumbura ' s southern suburbs . &quot; People are arming themselves all_over the country , &quot; said former President Pierre Buyoya , a Tutsi whose acceptance of multi-party democracy led to his resounding defeat by Ndadaye ' s pro-Hutu party at the polls . In the bazaar of the capital , one can reportedly buy a grenade these days for $ 1 . Small bands of Hutu extremists are said to be operating in the countryside , staging hit-and-run attacks , then retreating into the dense equatorial forests . More_than 200 # 000 Hutus crossed the border from Rwanda this summer after the civil_war victory of the Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front , further adding_to Burundi ' s instability . Politicians , especially from the Hutu-led Front for Democracy , are in mortal danger . One deputy was shot and killed in August as he drove_home . On Sept . 16 , Norbert Ndihokubwayo , another Hutu member of the National Assembly , was fired on by two gunmen as he drove through Bujumbura . He was struck by five bullets , including one that pierced his jaw , but survived . In Burundi ' s own tragic version of ethnic cleansing , Hutus and Tutsis , who used to intermarry often enough in the past , were chased from each other ' s neighborhoods starting last autumn . Their abandoned homes were torched and their possessions looted . The two peoples , who share a common culture and language , Kirundi , have never been more polarized . But it is the army , and the politicians who have forged secret ties with it , who remain the X-factor , the unknown_quantity , that will determine whether war or peace reigns . Just two days after the power-sharing formula was agreed to by most of Burundi ' s leading politicians , on Sept . 12 , Tutsi soldiers circled the working-class Hutu neighborhood at Kamenge a_few miles from Parliament ' s chambers . Hutus who had armed themselves shot at the soldiers , residents admit . The army withdrew but returned after dawn with 10 armored cars and fired for hours on the flimsy shacks of dried mud where 80 # 000 Hutus live . The next day , the soldiers began house-to-house searches and manhunts . By the army ' s count , 60 civilians and two soldiers were killed . Kamenge residents say 150 of their neighbors died . Many , including the district ' s Front leader , were skewered with bayonets , they say , making nonsense of the army ' s claim that it was engaged in a firefight with armed Hutu extremists . Dahlburg , The Times ' New Delhi Bureau chief , was recently on assignment in Burundi .</TEXT>
