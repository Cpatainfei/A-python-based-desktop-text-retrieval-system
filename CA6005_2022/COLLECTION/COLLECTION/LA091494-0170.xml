   <HEADLINE> TOYOTA TO HIKE N . AMERICAN PRODUCTION ; AUTOMOBILES : THE RISING YEN IS SEEN AS THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THE DECISION TO BOOST OUTPUT BY 48 % .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Toyota Motor Corp . is boosting car production in North_America by 48 % , meaning that within three years , nearly two-thirds of the Toyotas sold in North_America will be built there . Toyota , Japan ' s largest auto_maker , said Tuesday that it is making the move partially because of pressure on profits caused by the decline of the U.S. dollar against the yen . The auto_maker also said it plans in 1995 to shift production of all pickup_trucks sold in the United States from Japan to the Toyota-General Motors joint manufacturing_plant in Fremont , Calif. , New United Motor Manufacturing Inc. NUMMI produced 98 # 000 pickup_trucks last year , while 86 # 000 were imported from Japan , Hagerty said . The yen has soared more_than 20 % over the last two years against the dollar , meaning that revenue earned in dollars is worth less when sent_back to Japan . The rise also makes Japanese wages and materials more expensive in dollar terms . Other major Japanese manufacturers have also been increasing overseas production . Japanese auto_makers have been forced to raise overseas prices to make_up the difference in the yen . As a result , some Japanese models now cost several thousand dollars more in North_America than comparable American-made cars . Last month , Toyota announced average price increases for most of its 1995 models of 3.3 % , or $ 572 , compared to initial 1994 prices . Honda and Nissan have announced similar increases , all blaming a higher yen , and Honda also plans to increase U.S. production . Toyota plans to increase North_American production to 790 # 000 vehicles in 1996 , up from 533 # 000 in 1993 . That means more_than 60 % of its cars sold in the United States in 1996 will be North American-made , up from 46 % in 1993 , Toyota said . Toyota ' s Georgetown , Ky. , plant is expected to boost employment from 5 # 500 as of July to about 6 # 000 in 1996 . Toyota spokesman Brendan Hagerty said Toyota does not plan any layoffs in Japan because of the move . While the yen was part of the reason for the U.S. production boost , Hagerty said there is a more fundamental one . &quot; Toyota really believes that to service a market well you have to produce there , &quot; he said . Tuesday ' s production announcement came a day after the first Avalon , a large sedan designed specifically for the U.S. market , rolled_off the assembly_line at the Kentucky plant . All Avalons , which replace the Cressida model , are to be built_in Kentucky . Overall , as a result of the increases in North_American production , Toyota plans to cut its exports from Japan to the United States from 554 # 000 vehicles in 1993 to about 400 # 000 in 1996 . Japanese auto_makers also face a new U.S. regulation taking_effect in October that will require cars sold in the United States to bear a sticker showing the percentage of North American-manufactured parts they contain . Japanese manufacturers fear that American consumers will prefer cars with high North_American content . The United States is Toyota ' s largest market .</TEXT>
