   <HEADLINE> EMOTIONS HIGH , VERSIONS VARY IN GIRL ' S TRAFFIC DEATH ; ACCIDENT : POLICE SEEK DRIVER OF CAR THAT STRUCK CHILD IN SOUTH-CENTRAL . WOMAN REPORTEDLY WAS ATTACKED BY A MOB .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Six-year-old Rebeca Velazquez lost her life on South-Central ' s unforgiving streets , where justice often is elusive and truth comes_in many shades of gray . The tiny first-grader , who had a penchant for Barbies , pink bows and braids , was struck by a car as she darted across Compton Avenue , anxious to find a bathroom while running errands with her father . For a_few explosive minutes in this mostly Latino neighborhood , an angry mob surrounded the black driver and peppered her with racial epithets . But the woman , thought to be in her early 30s , managed to slip back behind the wheel and speed away from the Sunday afternoon crowd . The next morning , doctors disconnected Rebeca ' s life-support machine . It may never be known who the driver was , or whether she fled because of fear or guilt . The California Highway Patrol would like to question her , though officers said Tuesday they believe the incident was an accident . On this stretch of asphalt , flanked by auto shops , check cashing outlets and an array of unlicensed vendors , the version of events changes with each eyewitness account . Some say the driver stepped_out of her blue 1970s Chevrolet station_wagon only after several men in the neighborhood noticed she had no license_plates and ran to block her way . They recall her as aggressive , possibly intoxicated , with a tattoo on her neck , berating the fallen child for dashing into her path . &quot; She came_out screaming , in English -- who knows what she was saying -- but she was angry and she wanted to run_away , &quot; said Rosario Serrano , 58 , who lives just a_few feet from where Rebeca landed , in an apartment protected by an iron grate . &quot; She was waving her arms trying to get_away . They just wanted to hold her until the police could come. &quot; Others insist the driver stopped voluntarily , but grew defensive after she was accosted by the menacing crowd . They remember about 30 men_in_the_street , pushing her , tugging her shirt , shouting derogatory words . When she finally made_it back to the safety of her car , where they say she had two small children , someone started hurling bottles and tried to chase her down . &quot; Man , they wanted to kill that black girl , &quot; said Jorge Luis Guzman , 27 , manager of the nearby El Carnal muffler shop . &quot; They tried to get her out of the car , to do something bad to her , they were so mad. &quot; From the perspective of his welding bench a_few storefronts away , Carlos Orduno offered another version . He saw negligence on both sides -- the driver for leaving the scene of a fatal_accident and the girl ' s father for letting her cross a heavily trafficked street alone . &quot; It was an error for that lady to go -- that was wrong -- but she was probably scared and it ' s natural for anyone to look_out for their own safety , &quot; said Orduno , 53 . &quot; But I also don ' t think that girl should have been crossing the street . It was so sad to see that tiny little thing lying there , but I wondered how could her father have left her alone like that. &quot; Rebeca ' s father , Hector Velazquez , sat Tuesday on a plastic-covered couch in the living room of his small bungalow in Watts , trying to make_sense of the split-second that cost his daughter ' s life . She was a sentimental girl , he said , pointing_out a bedroom covered with frilly pink lace and a wall decorated with three wooden figurines spelling_out &quot; Hope , Charity , Faith. &quot; Often she retreated there to watch her Spanish-language soap_operas in peace , or play with her prized Barbie , which is perched in the back of a doll-size horse-drawn carriage , her head shrouded in a pink polka-dotted veil . Moreover , he said , she understood well the rules of crossing the street . &quot; She knew , she knew , &quot; said Velazquez , a 38-year-old forklift driver , as he comforted his wife , Ana Maria , and their 5-year-old son , Hector Jr . &quot; I always told her , ' Stop . Look both ways. ' If she had seen a car , she would n ' t have crossed. &quot; On Sunday , they had spent the day running errands , first dropping_off his wife at a swap meet , then taking Rebeca ' s grandmother home . Before picking them up again , Velazquez s aid , he decided to stop at a catering truck in the Florence district that sells seafood prepared in the style of his native Mexican state , Nayarit . He left the girl in the car , which he parked on the west_side of Compton Avenue , just north of Gage Avenue . He crossed to the east_side and placed his order , but began to question whether it had been a wise idea to leave Rebeca alone . As he stepped to the curb , he saw her wriggling uncomfortably outside the car , clearly needing to use the bathroom . Before he could say anything , she walked into the street . He swears she looked both ways , but the car slammed into her 65-pound frame before he could speak . The speed_limit on Compton Avenue is 30 m.p.h. , but CHP officers say they have no way of knowing how fast the southbound car was traveling . No paint or glass fragments were left_behind and the skid marks are very_light . &quot; There was nothing at the scene to give us any indication of anything , &quot; said Officer Rick Rodriguesa CHP spokesman . The driver , who he said had been dressed in yellow , &quot; doesn ' t appear to be at_fault for anything . But we would like to talk to her , just to identify her and get a statement. &quot; All Velazquez knows is that his daughter fell limp on the street . He raced to cradle her in his arms , but there were no visible signs of life . If someone could be held responsible , he said , it would be a small solace . But he knows it is unlikely . &quot; Besides , &quot; he said , his eyes red from tears and sleepless nights , &quot; what would it solve ? My daughter ' s dead , that ' s all . Now I have to bury her. &quot;</TEXT>
