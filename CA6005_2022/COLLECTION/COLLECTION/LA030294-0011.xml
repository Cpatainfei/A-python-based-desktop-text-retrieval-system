   <HEADLINE> METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF : ESCAPE ATTEMPT GETS AID FROM A FRIEND -- AND A QUAKE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Roy ( JoJo ) Ward Jr. , a suspected killer and fugitive who staged an unsuccessful escape_from the jail of the Lennox sheriff ' s station , apparently got help from two outside sources . One : a Los Angeles gang member who authorities believe intentionally got himself arrested so he could smuggle a gun into the jail . The other : the Northridge quake , which disrupted the department ' s automatic fingerprint identification system and led authorities to treat Ward like a simple run-of-the-mill drug dealer instead of a dangerous escape artist . It wasn ' t until later that investigators learned that Ward , 24 , was wanted by federal authorities for a variety of charges , including staging a daring Thanksgiving weekend breakout from a Shreveport , La. , jail with the aid of a gun hidden inside a turkey dinner . &quot; The guy is a dangerous man , &quot; said Capt . Jack Scully , commander of the Lennox station . &quot; I have no doubt he will try to escape again. &quot; Ward was arrested Wednesday in the Athens district by deputies who said they discovered about a pound of cocaine in his car . He produced a driver ' s license in the name of Sam Hall . Deputies did not know that &quot; Sam Hall &quot; was Ward , a longtime Los Angeles gang member who had escaped_from the California Youth Authority as a teen-ager and fled to Louisiana , where he served three years for manslaughter and was awaiting sentencing on federal weapons charges when he broke_out last November . When Ward was arrested on the cocaine possession charge last week , deputies took him to Lennox station , an aging facility that has five holding cells . In the past , sheriff ' s spokesman Deputy Larry Mead said , it would have taken only about an hour for a computer check of the fingerprints to reveal &quot; Hall ' s &quot; true identity . But since the Jan . 17 earthquake damaged the Hall of Justice , where the Sheriff ' s Department ' s fingerprint section is located , the department has had to use other agencies ' computers to run fingerprint checks , sometimes taking days . If they had known who Ward was , Scully said , he would have received special handling as a dangerous escape risk . As it was , he was put into a holding cell with other crime suspects . The holding cells are equipped with pay phones . Scully said investigators are still trying to determine exactly what happened next . But they believe that Ward may have called outside contacts and arranged for a gang member named Damon Goff , 24 , to smuggle a gun into the jail . During the failed escape Friday morning , Scully said , Ward held a gun to the head of a jailer and pulled the trigger . The round did not go_off . Goff and Ward were arraigned Tuesday on charges of attempted murder , assault with a deadly weapon on a police_officer and bringing a weapon into the jail . GORDON DILLOW</TEXT>
