   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : FULLERTON ; CALLING FOR HONOR TO BE SET IN STONE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Carrying the red flags of the United Farm_Workers of America and a banner stating , &quot; Viva Cesar Chavez , &quot; more_than 350 people marched through the Cal State Fullerton campus Tuesday , demanding that a 5-month-old building be named after the late labor_leader . Their voices thundered in the halls and walkways with shouts of &quot; Si se puede ! &quot; ( Yes it can be done ! ) The two-hour demonstration was highlighted by a speech from a niece of Chavez , who remembered her uncle as a &quot; humble hero and courageous warrior. &quot; &quot; My tio ( uncle ) wasn ' t able to go beyond the eighth grade &quot; because his parents depended_on his wages to survive , said Juanita Chavez , 23 , a San Francisco State University_student . &quot; But he was self-taught and well-read because he had an unquenchable thirst_for_knowledge . So it is fitting that his legacy be continued at colleges and universities by students who have the opportunity that he never had , &quot; said Chavez , whose university recently named its student_center after her uncle . Other colleges and universities throughout the country have named buildings in honor of the founder of the United Farm_Workers union . Chavez , who died in April , 1993 , was known for leading consumer boycotts of farm products and staging hunger_strikes to publicize the working conditions of Central Valley farm_workers . In the late 1960s , Chavez launched a grape boycott that is still supported to press for stronger protections against pesticides and better working conditions for migrant workers . &quot; The work that Cesar Chavez did for the poor is respected all_over the nation , &quot; said Monica Hernandez , a 25-year-old Cal State Fullerton student and an organizer of the demonstration . &quot; We want to honor him because he exemplifies public_service with a commitment to community , youth and education. &quot; More_than 25 campus groups including MEChA , the Sociology Student Assn. , the African Student Alliance , the Filipino Student Assn . and the Chicano Poet Society organized the event in which they urged administrators to name the building for Chavez . The Chicano Studies Department submitted the request to the Naming of the University Hall committee earlier this year . &quot; Cesar Chavez set a moral direction for all_of us to follow and is seen as an individual who dedicated his life to helping others , and I think those values ought to be a part of our university , &quot; said Isaac Cardenas , chairman of the Chicano Studies Department . &quot; that ' s why we should pay tribute to Cesar Chavez. &quot; Robert A . Emry , the committee ' s chairman and head of the speech communication department , said members are considering four proposals . He would not reveal the names under_consideration , saying the information is confidential . But he said the committee will make a recommendation to the university ' s president before December . Emry said most university buildings are named after former presidents or people who have donated money to help construct them . MIMI KO</TEXT>
