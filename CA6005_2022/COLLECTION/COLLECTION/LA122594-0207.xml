   <HEADLINE> DESPITE ESTABLISHMENT ' S DISMAY , CARTER DISPLAYS DIPLOMATIC PROWESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Why does the Washington Establishment have such a distaste for Jimmy_Carter , our most prominent living ex-president ? After all , here is a man who builds housing for the poor , writes poetry , stays with the same wife and actually cares about peace -- making a major personal effort to bring it about in several difficult situations . In the Clinton_Administration , he has been responsible_for major diplomatic breakthroughs in North_Korea and Haiti . In Bosnia , he may actually have nudged the Bosnian Serbs closer to the negotiation table , though the results will not be known for several weeks . The reaction of official Washington could not be more apoplectic . The Washington Post editors denounced Carter in two successive lead editorials . Former Secretary_of_State Lawrence S . Eagleburger suggested that the former President might ruin a policy that had been almost irreparably ruined during Eagleburger ' s own tenure in office . The Clinton White_House tried to have it both ways . Publicly , it wished Carter well . Privately , White_House officials informed journalists , of course anonymously , of their dissatisfaction with Carter ' s trip , suggesting that he was naive and being used . One facile explanation for official Washington ' s intense hostility to Carter might be that since so many officials in the capital city do little to help the poor , are incapable of rhyming one word with another , acquire a trophy wife with the next highest office and do little for peace except raise the defense budget , they have little time for someone who displays the other virtues . But there appear to be two serious reasons for the hostility . One is that the former President ' s activity exposes the erosion of the imperial presidency , to which the Carter critics from both parties , and even many members of the press , are deeply devoted . The other is that any success he has only reveals the utter bankruptcy of the policies followed by the Bush and Clinton_Administrations in such places as North_Korea , Haiti and Bosnia . The imperial presidency really began Dec . 7 , 1941 and continued until the fall of the Berlin Wall . During that time , the U.S._government operated in a state of national emergency . Fear of another bolt_out of the blue , this time perhaps with nuclear_weapons , caused the American political class to concentrate enormous power in the hands of the presidency . Unlike most other world leaders , the President alone has the power to make the decision to go_to_war . Because of what was regarded_as imminent danger , the President was also permitted to surround decision-making with elaborate secrecy . In this system , the U.S._government operated like a monarchy in the field of foreign affairs . The President became all-powerful and , because of secrecy , all-knowledgeable . His counselors , in turn , became the king ' s privileged advisers , quick to denounce any opposition to the President ' s policies as verging on disloyalty given the danger the country faced . Press pundits cooperated in the game . Their authority depended_on their access to the monarch and his privileged advisers with knowledge of state secrets . But do we still need such an arrangement ? In a post-Cold War world , with economics replacing politics as the core subject of foreign_policy , such attitudes may be out of date . The imminent danger is gone . So is the rationale for the concentration of power in the hands of the presidency . So is the justification for extreme secrecy . In these new circumstances , the old American tradition of citizen diplomacy is beginning to reassert itself -- and no one has exploited the new opportunities more brilliantly than Carter . U.S. history , in fact , is replete with the efforts of citizens to &quot; improve &quot; on the policy of their government . The practice began in 1798 , when George Logan , a friend of Thomas_Jefferson , went_on his own authority to France to secure its accord with the United States . He had some success , but reaped criticism from Jefferson ' s friends . The U.S. Congress then passed the Logan Act , which provided punishment for any citizen who , without authorization , tried to influence the conduct of a foreign government toward the United States in periods of controversy . That act , still on the books , has never been enforced and probably could not be without infringing upon the constitutional rights of Americans . Indeed , the very role of the press in American society makes implementation of the act almost implausible ; for a free press daily influences the conduct of U.S. foreign_policy without authorization . The beginning of an exit strategy for the Cuban missile crisis began over a lunch between ABC correspondent John Scali and a Russian KGB agent . During the Vietnam_War , Administration officials were livid when U.S. journalists visited Hanoi , but there was little they could do about it without provoking a constitutional crisis . Senators denounced CNN ' s Peter Arnett for remaining in Baghdad during the Gulf War but , in the end , accepted his &quot; unauthorized &quot; intervention . Nor is there any way to bar U.S. political figures who force their way into the process . Members of Congress travel the world interfering in policy , often uninvited . During the Carter_Administration , aides of Sen . Jesse Helms ( R-N.C. ) showed_up uninvited at the London talks on Rhodesia and attempted to influence the negotiations , to the consternation of the Carter White_House . The effort failed and the talks succeeded . Jesse Jackson flew to Syria in January , 1984 , to persuade the government there to release Lt . Robert O . Goodman Jr. , who had been shot_down on a bombing mission over central Lebanon . Jackson was roundly denounced until he came_home with Goodman , and Ronald Reagan had the good_sense to schedule a ceremony on the White_House lawn . Today , more_than 1 # 000 U.S. state and local_governments are conducting their own foreign_policy according to research carried_out by Michael Shumann of the Institute of Policy Studies . Their efforts forced the Reagan_Administration to shift its policy toward South_Africa , provided sanctuary to illegal aliens fleeing the civil_wars of Central_America and pressed the cause of human_rights in various dictatorial governments . This movement toward &quot; local foreign_policies &quot; is so large it cannot be stopped . Carter , then , is only the most prominent of a growing number of Americans participating in the policy process . He has attracted more attention both because he is a former President and because he has chosen the most difficult cases . He has moved where the U.S._government has pursued such an inept diplomatic course that it left the country with few options other_than force when the country was unwilling to go_to_war . Thus , the Bush and Clinton_Administrations demonized the North_Korean , Haitian and Bosnian Serb leadership , to_the_point that we had no effective diplomatic contact . Yet , we were left with a strategy that assumed diplomatic contact -- because our allies in Seoul and Tokyo were unwilling to wage war against North_Korea ; the U.S. Senate was unwilling to support an invasion of Haiti , and the American people were unwilling to occupy Bosnia . Carter has brilliantly exploited these contradictions to create a unique diplomatic role for himself . Those who criticize him should ask whether there was an alternative . Was the U.S._government , in each case , not in a position where it wanted to shift course but for domestic political reasons found it difficult ? Indeed , when governments demonize one another , there are limited diplomatic opportunities , unless some impartial third_party -- like Carter -- takes the initiative . Thus , the diplomatic breakthrough between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization was_due to two Norwegian sociologists rather than to the U.S. secretary_of_state , who could not take an impartial position between Israel and the PLO . Administrations must learn to exploit these private efforts rather than resist them . If Carter comes_up with proposals in Bosnia that trouble Washington , any Administration should be strong enough to say no . But it should also be wise enough to accept a diplomatic opening if one develops that it did not expect and that a former President helped create .</TEXT>
