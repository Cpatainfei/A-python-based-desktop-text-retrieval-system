   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEW ; POIGNANT ' SCENT OF GREEN PAPAYA ' ; THE CANNES WINNER UNDERSCORES THE DECORUM OF PREWAR VIETNAM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; The Scent of Green Papaya , &quot; a film as delicate and evocative as its name , recognizes that out of illusion can come reality . Though its re-creation of the streets and houses of prewar Vietnam is ravishing , &quot; Papaya &quot; ( selected theaters ) was shot exclusively on a sound stage outside of Paris . And though its actors are all Vietnamese , almost every one had been tainted by French culture and had to be freshly tutored in the graceful gestures and body_language of their homeland . Yet so well did all_of this artifice succeed that &quot; Papaya &quot; managed a number of remarkable firsts . It won the prestigious Camera d ' Or at Cannes as best first feature for its writer-director Tran Anh Hung , is Vietnam ' s first official submission for the best foreign language Oscar and is the first film to present a look from the inside at a culture and a sensibility we think we know but don ' t , that of the once-divided country that was simultaneously our enemy and our friend . And though there is no lack of incident or emotion in &quot; Papaya , &quot; it is primarily a fable-like memory film , an idealized tribute to the spirit of Vietnam ' s beautiful prewar days and the concern with textures , colors , tastes and smells that made the simple acts of everyday life into a complete aesthetic experience . Symbolizing the tranquil , unhurried pace of Vietnam past is Mui , first glimpsed as a 10-year-old girl ( Lu Man San ) arriving in Saigon in 1951 to become a servant for a well-to-do family . Innocent but curious and hard-working , with a surprisingly broad and cheery smile , Mui stands_for the grace and beauty invested in ordinary things by a culture where women did the meaningful work but were constrained to remain in the shadows . Two kinds of knowledge come_to Mui as she quietly works , and what turns_out to have lasting value are not the behind-closed-doors secrets of her employers but an understanding of what it means to perform ordinary tasks ( like the preparing of unripe papaya as a breakfast vegetable ) with delicacy and grace . Mui ' s mistress ( Truong Thi Loc ) not only runs the house but also the family cloth business , while her husband ( Tran Ngoc Trung ) , distraught over the death of their daughter , rarely leaves the house and mostly ignores his two youngest sons . His own mother , a premature widow , rarely even leaves the second floor , much to the concern of Mr. Thuan ( Nguyen Van Oanh ) , a discreet elderly admirer . One of the points of Tran Anh Hung ' s film is to underline this discretion , the decorum and restraint that was the rule_in most strata of Vietnamese society , qualities that have become natural to Mui by the time the film jumps forward 10 years and becomes something of a Cinderella story . Now a beautiful young_woman ( played by Tran Nu Yen-Khe ) , Mui finds herself working for Khuyen ( Vuong Hoa Hoi ) , a wealthy classical composer and friend of her original family , a young_man she has felt an attraction toward from the beginning . Still , she goes_on as before , smiling and preparing savory Vietnamese dishes that cinematographer Benoit Delhomme photographs as if they were clusters of diamonds . It really can ' t be overemphasized how exquisite everything is in &quot; The Scent of Green Papaya , &quot; not only the food , but also the vases and screens that decorate the houses , even a drop of sap dripping onto a thick green leaf . Just as the film ' s story is a series of small incidents that build almost imperceptibly to a dramatic climax , so it is visually , as all_the careful , unhurried shots of domestic rituals and objects end_up supplying an unexpected quiet sensuality to Mui ' s story . Filmmaker Tran Anh Hung , who was 12 when his family moved to France in 1975 , attempted to shoot in Saigon , but logistical difficulties made Paris inevitable . Even though Nguyen Anh Hoa , who plays the old servant woman , had to be brought over from Vietnam to tutor the mostly amateur cast in correct behavior , the director ' s sureness of vision and remarkable control of the medium ensured that his native country ' s singular way of seeing the world would be done_justice . Which makes_it all_the more unsettling , as the roar of a presumably military jet reminds us near the end , that the time was not far off when this most delicate civilization would be crushed to dust in a ruinous war . In addition to everything else it does , &quot; The Scent of Green Papaya &quot; is intended as a cultural memorial , and a fine and poignant one it turns_out to be . * ' The Scent of Green Papaya ' Tran Nu Yen-Khe : Mui , 20 years old Lu Man San : Mui , 10 years old Truong Thi Loc : the mother Nguyen Anh Hoa : Thi , the old servant Vuong Hoa Hoi : Khuyen Les Productions Lazennec production with La SFP Cinema and La SEPT Cinema , released by First Look Pictures .
