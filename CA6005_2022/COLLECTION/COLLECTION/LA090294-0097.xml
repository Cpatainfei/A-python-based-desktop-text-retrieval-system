   <HEADLINE> VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : PROGRAM HELPS FIND HOMES FOR MORE PETS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Euthanasia may soon be a thing of the past at the West Valley Animal Shelter and Control_Center in Chatsworth . The animal control officers and volunteers at the West Valley shelter have pioneered a mobile pet adoption program showcasing orphaned dogs and cats at malls and pet_food stores that has dramatically decreased the need to put their animals to sleep . Aggressive tactics such_as the mobile program , in addition to the volunteers ' commitment to finding homes for the animals , have reduced the euthanasia rate by more_than 70 % at the West Valley shelter , according to Animal Control Officer Tim Goffa . District Supervisor George Weissman said that he foresees other shelters in Los Angeles trying the mobile adoption program . &quot; With the success they have been having , I can ' t see it going any other way , &quot; Weissman said . On Aug . 21 , West Valley joined up with the West Los Angeles shelter to showcase 41 animals at the Century City Shopping_Center . All but three cats were adopted , said West Valley volunteer Judy Levine . On Sept . 10 , the shelter is hosting an open_house and on the following day , they are taking some animals to the Discount Pet_Food store in Van Nuys . Even at the shelter itself , volunteers like Levine are always working_on keeping the animals from being put_down . Levine helped arrange a two-week stay_of_execution for Vivian , a shepherd-mix that had been left tied to the flagpole in front of the shelter with her ear badly mangled from a fight with another animal . Levine offered to tend to Vivian ' s wounds whenever possible . &quot; We also want to find homes for the older animals , &quot; Levine said , explaining that many people come_to shelters looking_for puppies or kittens and don ' t want a pet that will die after just a year . &quot; I want to educate people that it ' s OK to adopt an older pet . . . . They are great animals. &quot; While the volunteers and employees are all eager to find their animals homes , they are committed to finding them good homes . Levine and her colleagues make follow-up calls to all new pet guardians to make_sure the animals are being adequately cared_for . MAKI BECKER</TEXT>
