   <HEADLINE> SPOUSAL ABUSE IS RARELY PROSECUTED AS A FELONY IN O.C. ; CRIME : STATISTICS INDICATE AN ABSENCE OF VIGOROUS PURSUIT OF CASES IN THE COUNTY -- 95 % OF ARRESTS END_UP AS MISDEMEANORS . D.A. SAYS OVERALL DATA IS INCOMPLETE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At a time when local domestic violence complaints are soaring at record rates , state crime statistics show that the Orange County district_attorney ' s office has the worst record among prosecutors in the state ' s six most-populous counties for vigorously pursuing spousal abuse cases . Over the past three years for which state figures are available , the office of Dist . Atty . Michael R . Capizzi elected to file the smallest percentage of cases as felonies , had the lowest conviction rate in those felony cases -- 52.4 % -- and succeeded in putting the smallest percentage of serious offenders in prison . A Times investigation revealed that more_than 95 % of the felony spousal abuse arrests in Orange County ended_up being filed_in court as misdemeanors , giving Orange County the lowest felony filing rate -- 4.2 % -- among the state ' s top six counties . In comparison , San Diego County , which comes_closest to Orange County in terms of population and demographics , has a felony filing rate nearly four times higher . Domestic violence counselors and those concerned over battered wives have fought for years to get the criminal justice system to take spousal abuse more seriously . But it has taken the double-murder case against former football great O.J. Simpson to finally focus public attention on the nation ' s epidemic of spousal abuse -- and the legal_system ' s response to it . California law gives prosecutors the option of filing spousal abuse cases either as felonies , punishable by prison_terms of two to four years for first-time offenders , or as misdemeanors , which can only be punished with relatively shorter stays in the county jail , or with probation . In an interview last week , Capizzi dismissed the statistical comparisons -- which echoed similar findings of a recent Times investigation revealing that his office had the poorest record among the six most-populous counties for prosecuting rape -- saying that the state ' s statistical data was incomplete . He also said the state statistics are unsuitable for comparisons between counties -- an assertion that is contradicted by recognized criminologists and disputed by state justice_department officials . Capizzi said he is proud_of the way his office has handled spousal abuse cases , and said a special prosecution unit he created 15 months ago is cracking_down on individuals who batter their mates . He said his office is doing the best it can with limited resources . &quot; I think we do_well in that area with the caseload that ' s presented to us . We are constantly striving to do_better , &quot; Capizzi said . &quot; As a result of ( the new unit ) , we are much stronger in our handling of those cases . We are able to give them more individualized attention , and that was the purpose in creating that unit. &quot; Critics , however , say the figures raise troubling questions about how seriously prosecutors treat spousal abuse cases that are often a critical predictor of escalating violence -- and even murder . &quot; I think these are abysmal figures , and they certainly look_like Orange County has not faced the fact that domestic abuse is a serious crime , &quot; said Dr. Mildred Kaley Pagelow , a Cal State Fullerton professor who has researched domestic abuse for 20 years . Reports of spousal abuse in Orange County have skyrocketed over the past five years for which official statistics are available . The numbers are growing at a pace 65 % higher than the state as_a_whole , and 20 % faster than in Los Angeles County , which saw a slight decrease in the last year . Likewise , Orange County police agencies have been arresting adults and juveniles for spousal abuse at a rate that is increasing virtually twice as fast as statewide and five times faster than in Los Angeles County . Reasons for the dramatic increases are unclear , although some speculate that increased spousal abuse may be linked to the economic downturn and to an increased awareness of the problem and willingness to call police . The most troubling statistic shows that deadly domestic violence is also on the rise in Orange County . According to state figures , 19 men and women were killed in 1993 in domestic violence cases in Orange County , an increase of five over the number just five years ago . At the same time , homicides linked to domestic abuse in Los Angeles County and the state reportedly declined . Critics say Capizzi -- and by extension , Orange County -- has been slow to recognize and combat spousal abuse and domestic violence . Some note that there are more shelters for abused animals in Orange County than there are facilities for battered women . &quot; Long before ( Orange County ) established a special prosecution unit , other counties had already done that , &quot; Pagelow said . &quot; There ' s just been no special emphasis on these cases. &quot; One of the state ' s first pilot_programs for prosecuting spousal abuse was started in Los Angeles in 1985 , while the district_attorney ' s office there created a full-fledged unit 1 1 / 2 years ago . San Diego started a program in 1988 and has since become a nationwide model . Both jurisdictions boast a higher percentage of felony filings , higher conviction rates , and a higher rates of incarceration for spousal abuse than Orange County , according to state figures . The data used in The Times ' comparisons comes from the California Department_of_Justice , which collects statistics on crime and punishment from every law_enforcement agency , prosecutor ' s office and courthouse in the state . The data tracks felony spousal abuse arrests , the recommendations to prosecutors of the arresting agencies , prosecutors ' filing of the cases either as felonies or misdemeanors , and the outcome of those cases once they are adjudicated in the courts . In defending his office ' s handling of spousal abuse cases , Capizzi said there are many factors that can distort the picture given by felony arrest statistics . Capizzi said prosecutors face a higher burden than police_officers , who frequently consider a case to be a felony at the time of arrest , when a later and more thorough evaluation of the evidence by prosecutors dictates that it should be treated as a misdemeanor . &quot; They can arrest for probable_cause , &quot; he said . &quot; Many times there is a felony probable_cause arrest , and when the liaison officer comes_in , they will say this is not a felony , it should be a misdemeanor . &quot; If we see them as a misdemeanor , we will file it as a misdemeanor. &quot; But the overwhelming reduction of felony arrests to misdemeanor charges shows that prosecutors are disregarding police judgment , Pagelow said . Years ago , she said , the problem in spousal abuse cases typically involved police who refused to arrest abusive husbands -- or boyfriends who , under California law , can sometimes be defined as spouses -- in about 95 % of the cases . &quot; Now , they make that call ( and make an arrest ) , but it ' s not prosecuted as a felony , &quot; she said . &quot; When the charge is a misdemeanor , the message very often is that this is nothing to worry about. &quot; Capizzi said his office doesn ' t underestimate what is at risk . &quot; Obviously , we wanted to see a more aggressive stance on these cases , and that ' s why we started the unit , &quot; he said . &quot; These cases just tug at you to see that we have to do something to deal with these cases before they turn_into a homicide. &quot; But critics say that every domestic dispute case , regardless of the severity of any injuries , presents an opportunity to try to break the cycle of violence . Even in cases where there is evidence of prior violence and repeat offenses , the criminal justice system as_a_whole often allows offenders to escape the most serious punishment . Consider , for example , the case of James Calvin Wilkes , 46 , of Garden Grove , who was charged with misdemeanor injury to his spouse in January , 1991 , and was arrested again for slashing his wife with a machete before the first case was resolved . Records show that while awaiting trial for the machete attack , Wilkes was sentenced to informal probation for the first offense . And when he pleaded guilty to felony charges in the machete attack , he was again sentenced to probation -- even though he had a prior conviction for voluntary manslaughter , a shooting death in San Diego . When he was arrested for violating his probation , and faced a possible five-year prison sentence , he was instead sent to Orange County Jail for one year , getting credit for six months already spent in custody . Capizzi ' s domestic violence unit has two prosecutors and one investigator devoted full time to felony spousal abuse cases , while two deputies in each of the county ' s five courthouses handle misdemeanor domestic violence cases in addition to their routine caseload . Each spousal abuse case is reviewed individually , and prosecutors take into consideration the victim ' s injuries and the defendant ' s prior record . Repeat offenders are not automatically charged with felonies . Senior Deputy Dist . Atty . Jane Shade said the unit cannot handle all cases stemming from domestic violence but concentrates_on the most serious and difficult cases , such_as those involving several charges , or reluctant witnesses , or stalking . The unit is currently revamping its system of record-keeping to be able to track domestic abuse cases , Shade said . She said many felony arrests are properly filed as misdemeanors , and she personally reviews all spousal abuse case rejections to make_sure the decision not to prosecute was correct . &quot; We take these charges very , very seriously , &quot; said Shade , who added that she considers domestic violence cases to be &quot; homicide prevention &quot; cases . &quot; There is discretion involved , but that ' s what we do. &quot; In Santa Clara County , prosecutors have used their discretion to file a much higher percentage of felonies . The felony filing rate there is nearly five times that of Orange County , and its felony conviction rate is 54 % higher . Nearly 50 % more of those convicted of spousal abuse in Santa Clara County end_up with some form of incarceration . The Santa Clara district_attorney ' s office opened its domestic violence unit in late 1990 , said Rolanda Pierre-Dixon , the head of the unit . &quot; It ' s not that difficult to file a felony case , &quot; she said . &quot; You ' ve got a woman with a broken bone , or someone who has been hospitalized or there ' s some lethality involved . In those cases , I will file a felony . But there ' s an old saying : ' A bad felony does not make_for a good misdemeanor. ' You ' ve got_to have a good case , and we pursue good cases here. &quot; San Diego County has one of the nation ' s model programs for prosecuting domestic violence cases . The city attorney has nine deputies , and the district_attorney ' s office has 12 prosecutors , who do nothing but track felony and misdemeanor spousal abuse cases . The San Diego Police_Department has 24 detectives and three sergeants devoted to such cases . &quot; We have the largest specialized felony domestic violence unit in the country , &quot; said Casey G . Gwinn , head deputy city attorney and supervising attorney of the domestic violence unit . &quot; We ' ve gone_far but still have a long way to go. &quot; While more_than one-fourth of the cases rejected for prosecution in Orange County are explained as &quot; victim unavailable / declines to testify , &quot; San Diego has a policy of pressing ahead with charges -- even with an uncooperative victim -- once the unit has taken the case . Some Orange County law_enforcement agencies have officers who specialize in domestic dispute cases , but many departments do not . All insist that they take domestic violence seriously , but also say that it is not always realistic to pursue felony prosecutions . Santa Ana Police Lt . Robert Helton said his department does not have a special unit to handle such cases , but a civilian employee acts_as a liaison with prosecutors to provide assistance . Helton said the biggest problem is reluctant victims . &quot; Many victims are unwilling to proceed with a criminal case because they are fearful , do not want to lose the family breadwinner , nor do they want to face more turmoil in their family , &quot; he said . Orange County Superior_Court Judge Donald E . Smallwood was the driving force behind the creation of a county task_force on domestic violence about a year ago . Smallwood said he expects the panel to produce detailed recommendations for tackling the problem in coming months . &quot; This is an area that has not been given the attention ( it should have received ) by prosecutors and the courts , and has just been soft-peddled over the years , &quot; he said , adding that he believes that holds true for the nation , not just Orange County . &quot; It ' s critical because this is the one area where we can make such a tremendous difference , &quot; he said , adding that he estimates one killing in Orange County each month can be traced to domestic violence . Capizzi said it is also unfair to blame his office for sentencing of spousal abusers . Prosecutors recommend a sentence but cannot force a judge to impose it . There are some judges in the county who hand_down sentences for spousal abuse that are too lenient for his tastes , he said , but declined to identify them or say whether his prosecutors take_advantage of a legal procedure that would allow them to avoid taking spousal abuse cases before those judges . He said his prosecutors do all they can &quot; to the extent we can influence the sentence , create a higher percentage of cases going_to prison and a higher level of prison commitments. &quot; Shade said prison is not always an appropriate sentence . Often , she said , prosecutors try to seek sentences that combine jail and therapy in an attempt to break the patterns of abuse . When possible , abusers are sent to a 32-session counseling program that focuses_on stopping abuse before it starts again . &quot; By and large , there are very few defendants in spousal abuse cases that deserve prison , &quot; said Shade . &quot; What we are interested in is breaking the chain of violence. &quot; But Los Angeles attorney Gloria Allred , president of the Women ' s Equal Rights Legal Defense and Education Fund , said the Legislature clearly designated spousal abuse law as a crime punishable as a felony if there is evidence of trauma . She said Orange County prosecutors are undermining the Legislature ' s intent . &quot; They ' re basically saying , ' we ' ll wait until this guy beats you half to death before we do anything , ' &quot; said Allred , who said this is especially critical because studies show domestic violence almost always escalates in severity . &quot; Battered women need and deserve legal protection , &quot; she said . Allred said -- and Judge Smallwood agreed -- that domestic violence would be taken more seriously if the traditional victims were men . &quot; I do believe there is a gender bias at_work here , &quot; Smallwood said . Shade said the unit is dedicated to making_sure that trained prosecutors get justice for victims of spousal abuse , and said the office ' s record for doing so is_on the rise . &quot; Our response continues to get better and better , &quot; Shade said . Sgt . Tom Boylan , who supervises the crimes against persons unit of the Costa Mesa Police_Department , was startled by the statistics and said , &quot; they do not look that good ( considering ) the seriousness of the crime. &quot; The data , however , is only available through 1992 , a_few months before the Orange County district_attorney ' s office set_up its domestic violence unit . Boylan cautioned that the situation might have improved since then . &quot; Our D.A. has been fairly aggressive in this area , &quot; he said . &quot; I think they are making a substantial effort today. &quot; Robin Jaruszewski , community outreach director at Interval House , a 55-bed shelter for battered women , said the number of victims she sees continues to grow . &quot; We are always filled . We always have a waiting list . People are talking_about O.J. , O.J. , and I ' m saying , Where have all these people been ? This happens every day. &quot; In many of the Orange County homicides linked to domestic abuse in the last year , law_enforcement authorities were_on alert that the alleged assailant could be dangerous : * Camp Pendleton military_police responded twice to quell domestic disturbances at the home of Tina and Jeffrey Gibson , a decorated Persian_Gulf_War veteran , but Gibson was never jailed or disciplined . Shortly after their divorce , Gibson allegedly murdered his ex-wife in San Clemente in May , 1993 , before allegedly shooting to death his 5-year-old daughter and seriously injuring another woman in the apartment . Gibson has pleaded not_guilty and faces trial . * Anaheim city prosecutors charged Ysrael Jacoba Cordova , 36 , with misdemeanor spousal abuse for an April , 1993 , attack on his longtime companion , Rebecca Ann Cruz . He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 days in jail . After his release , he attacked Cruz again . Although he was booked on felony charges , Orange County prosecutors filed the case as a misdemeanor . He again pleaded guilty to spousal abuse , and was sentenced to 120 days in jail . In February of this year , Cordova was charged with bursting into Cruz ' s Anaheim home , fatally shooting her boyfriend , and threatening to kill Cruz before she fled out a back_door . Cordova faces trial on murder_charges later this year . Spousal abuse cases are often troubling ones for the legal_system -- presenting difficulties not unlike those in rape cases . Victims are often reluctant to testify . The defendant often tries to blame the victim . Some jurors might be hesitant to convict someone in what many still see as a family dispute to be settled behind closed doors . Nancy Rodriguez , a senior counselor at Interval House , said she is frustrated by the number of cases that are treated as misdemeanors by prosecutors . &quot; I personally think the very first offense should be considered a felony before it ' s looked_at as a misdemeanor , &quot; Rodriguez said . &quot; If it ' s a misdemeanor , these guys are basically given a fine or jail time , and its usually time served . &quot; The system doesn ' t seem to work sometimes , &quot; she said . &quot; Sometimes , its just a joke. &quot; Times staff writers Mark Landsbaum , Dan Weikel , Mark Platte and Richard O ' Reilly , as well as library researcher Sheila Kern and computer analyst Sandy Poindexter , contributed to this report . Spousal Abuse : How Orange County Compares Among the state ' s six-most populous counties , Orange County police arrest fewer individuals for spousal abuse , but generally seek the harshest punishment for those they do arrest . County prosecutors , however , pursue the smallest percentage of cases as felonies , electing instead to file the cases as misdemeanors . Very few defendants are ever sent to prison . * During 1990-92 , the most recent period for which figures are available , Orange County police and sheriff ' s deputies made the smallest number of spousal abuse arrests per 100 reported cases .
