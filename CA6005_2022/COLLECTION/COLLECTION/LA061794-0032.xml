   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; CYBERVAL ; A WRITER OVERCOMES THE FEAR OF A NEW PC WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM YOUNG EXPERTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Not long ago I became part of a trend , both nationally and here in the Valley . Like the other Americans who bought 50 million personal_computers last year alone , I bought a new PC -- a better , faster , more powerful model than the Stone_Age IBM clone my son took_off to college eight years ago . This is the story of the first weeks of the bittersweet romance between me and my new IBM compatible . * I have a standard answer_for friends who ask what kind of computer I bought . &quot; It ' s beige , &quot; I tell them . Because I knew from the outset that I didn ' t want to devote the rest of my adult life to figuring_out how much electronic firepower I needed , I turned the task over to my 24-year-old son , Eric . Computer-literate ( computer-gifted , if you ask his mother ) , Eric made lists of possible options and checked them twice . He tapped his more expert pals for advice , then worked the phones to compare prices . Finally , he asked an especially knowledgeable friend , Mark Bentkower , if he would join us , and we made an appointment at a computer_store known for customizing PCs at a competitive price . At the store Eric and Mark did most of the talking . They had strong views on such things as how fast the modem should be . They spoke_of the rate in bits per second and baud . Baud ? I ' m a recovering English major . When I hear baud , I think_of the Wife of Bath , Moll Flanders , those bawds . Actually , I too know that baud_rate indicates how quickly your computer sends or receives information . As such , it has a major impact on how much you enjoy your system . Too slow a modem will drive you crazy and will ultimately cost you a fortune in phone charges ( since the modem is the part of the system that allows you to connect with other computers and exchange information over phone_lines ) . The higher your baud , the better . From Day One , I had decided to have the kind of relationship with my computer I have with my Honda . What matters_to me is that it works , not how it works . I don ' t want be a computer doctor when I grow_up . But not everybody feels that way about their machine helpers . Earlier this year , at a conference on women and the Internet at the Huntington in San Marino , I ran_into the aptly named Rhonda Super . A North Hollywood resident , Super , 42 , works in the entertainment_industry and dreams of the day when she will configure the elements she has so carefully researched into the computer of her dreams . &quot; I love hardware , &quot; says Super . &quot; I like making quilts , and I think it ' s the same concept . You construct something. &quot; I don ' t make quilts , but I did write the check after the Biederman deal was struck . To be really accurate , I would describe my new computer as ecru . Getting Started , or Is There Anything on TV ? If you are like most people , which is to say , if technology doesn ' t make you tingle , the first thing that happens when you get a new computer is that you are afraid of it . Not the way you ' re afraid of getting carjacked or losing the game of life , but the way you ' re afraid of having to program your VCR in a timed test . You ' re intimidated . This happens to virtually everyone . Actor John Goodman was brave enough to screech at Elizabeth Taylor in &quot; The Flintstones &quot; movie , but he recently revealed on a TV talk_show that he had just bought a new computer and -- these are his exact words -- &quot; I ' m scared to death of it. &quot; There ' s a reason for this . Computer culture isn ' t nearly as amicable as terms such_as user-friendly would lead you to believe . Cyberculture has a we ' re-hip-and-you ' re-not aspect to it that can put_off all but the most confident . For example , take the Internet ( please ) . Finding your way onto the Internet may be the single hardest thing you will ever have to do ( see accompanying story ) . Even the guides to the Internet seem to be written in secret_code . Part of the reason the Internet is harder to join than an Afrikaner country_club is that nobody who is already on the Internet really wants to help you over the Great Technodivide to their side , where the cool people pass electronic notes at the speed_of_light . And once you do manage to get connected , &quot; newbies , &quot; as Internet plebes are called , are often treated to cyberscorn , especially if they came aboard via a commercial access provider . So what ' s gonna happen is one day , soon after you unpack your new computer , you ' re going to sit_down in front of your monitor , hands hovering Van Cliburn-like over the keyboard , focusing all your mental_energy on whatever computing task lies before you , and you ' re going to decide : To hell with it . I wonder if anything good ' s on cable ? One evening recently , I was making_up excuses for not practicing on the computer when my son finally got impatient . &quot; Come on , Mom , &quot; he said . &quot; Carpe datum. &quot; Those Pesky Gender Differences Computers were invented mostly by men , mostly with other men in mind . Want evidence ? Read any history of computing or , alternatively , look where the ads for computers run in your daily newspaper . The Saturday sports section , that ' s where . Want more ? What does 90 % of the world ' s software consist_of ? Games . Games that combine the principles of target shooting and Dungeons &amp; Dragons , two pastimes that have mesmerized perhaps four females in all_of recorded history . Of all_of these thousands of computer_games , only one -- Tetris -- is popular_with women , including Hillary Rodham Clinton . According to a heart-rending story published recently in the Wall_Street Journal , there is a 66-year-old grandmother in Indiana who is so Tetris-obsessed that she plays five hours a day , prompting her granddaughter to inquire about treatment centers ! The thrust of the Journal story is that software designers are analyzing Tetris ' distaff appeal in hopes of creating more games that attract women , thus , doubling the market ! Great idea . But will the guys charged with solving the puzzle be able to stop playing Sim City long enough to do_it ? What does this mean for the mature woman with a computer ? It means she should find herself some of these nice young experts and let them ease her way onto the Infobahn . In fact , many of you have probably given_birth to one already . If so , don ' t waste a nanosecond feeling guilty about asking_for help . You ' ve already prepaid through the year 2000 in laundry . Expect to be patronized a bit even as you are assisted . One of my son ' s friends recently gave me his electronic_mail address and when he came_to the . that is a standard feature , he didn ' t call it an &quot; at , &quot; as he would have with his cyberbuds , he called it &quot; an ' a ' with a lasso around it. &quot; Do I care ? I do not . He is generous to a fault with his formidable expertise and , like my son , has already helped me skip the &quot; Hooked_on Phonics &quot; phase of mastering my machine and get_to the good_parts . You think it ' s wrong for a woman to allow men to do the electronic equivalent of opening the car_door for her ? I ' ll bet Gloria Steinem has a_couple_of male hackers in her Rolodex , and I ' ll tell you who else doesn ' t think it ' s cheating . Guys . Men who are just getting started on the Internet sometimes adopt female-sounding computer names in hopes of enlisting the aid of the male computing majority . These men in electronic drag know that another male ' s cry_for help is routinely dismissed with the abrupt message , &quot; RTM , &quot; computerese for &quot; Read the Manual. &quot; The actual response is usually &quot; RTFM , &quot; but remember , standards of behavior in cyberspace are closer to &quot; Lord of the Flies &quot; than to a church picnic . A lot of women are excited by the information revolution , and they want to make_sure that they get_on the Information Superhighway too . Barbara Stites , who lives_in Van Nuys , is frustrated because she doesn ' t yet have the money to upgrade her computer . Stites , 47 , got her master ' s degree in history at Cal State Northridge a_couple_of years ago , and she is eager to tap into the many electronic archives that could advance her research on life in Mississippi in the early 1800s . But she needs a whole new system , including a modem , to do that . &quot; I need to be able to get_out there and communicate , &quot; she said . Stites worries that the Internet is creating an electronic elite and an electronic underclass , made_up of people without the money or training or even time to take_advantage of the opportunities being created by the new technology . &quot; If you ' re connected , &quot; Stites observed , &quot; you get the benefits . And if you ' re not , you don ' t. &quot; The Personal_Computer : A Really Versatile Small Appliance I bought my new computer because I thought it would make my life easier . It would allow me to work_on stories at odd hours , late at night , for instance , without having to schlep into the office . And I thought it would encourage me to do more of my own writing . This was an issue I had been brooding about lately with one of my dearest friends , a woman I met on our first day of sixth grade . A college professor in upstate New York , Toni is an anthropologist , a mother of five and a superb writer in at least two languages ( she also has a black_belt in karate ) . But in recent years she has been increasingly troubled by the question of whether , as a writer , she has been a good steward to her talent . And so she came_up with a plan that would help us both . We would start writing to each other regularly and see what our correspondence became . Maybe a book , maybe two books , maybe nothing at all beyond a stack of letters . Whatever we produced , we knew we would have a great time doing_it . Because long before we had computers , we were teen-age best_friends who spent hundreds of nights whispering happily to each other on such eternally fascinating subjects as books , men ( boys , we called them then ) and the meaning of life . Now Toni and I would whisper electronically , probably on the same topics . So far we have got as far as exchanging e-mail addresses . Things I have actually done on the computer ( besides routine writing ) : 1 . Installed a personal-finance program . Like most people , I dream of a perfectly balanced checkbook , meticulously tracked investments , a balanced_budget -- the economic equivalent of being born again . And with this software , I thought , peace_of_mind -- if not wealth -- would be mine . Of course , to achieve fiscal Nirvana I first had to input all_the boring details of my financial life , including the particulars of every check I ' ve written since the first of the year , into my computer . At which point , I realized that , for the time being at least , my laudable desire for financial order can be met quite adequately , thank_you , by my check register and a pocket_calculator . 2 . Played Tetris . Bor-ing . I just don ' t get the appeal . Should I get my estrogen levels checked ? 3 . Lurked on the Internet . You can do amazing things on the Internet -- tap into entire libraries , including the Vatican ' s , for instance -- but one of the most fun things you can do is to look_at the messages people send each other on the system ' s 4 # 000 newsgroups . The technical term for reading these messages ( which are public ) , without participating in the exchange , is lurking , and it is a revelation . First of all , you scroll through an electronic list of the myriad newsgroups in existence , and you choose the ones that pique your imagination . The best place to start is the stuff labeled with the prefix alt. , for alternative . This is cyberspace ' s answer to the tabloids , except more so , since you can actually tap into the mind-set of people with every imaginable sexual fantasy as well as such decidedly minority enthusiasms as Chia pets , ketchup and ( I am not making this up ) Karl Malden ' s nose . Serious concerns are also shared among newsgroup participants -- a number are devoted to recovery and to specific disabilities and disorders . This week , for example , a man told alt.support.stuttering that he stutters and said he ' d appreciate information about the genetic basis of the condition since his 7-year-old son stutters too . But for every serious newsgroup , there are two that remind you just how zany , even demented , your fellow computer users truly are . You try not to peek when you encounter such provocative forums as alt.psychotic.roommates , alt.sexy.bald.captains or alt.conspiracy.abe-lincoln. Which is how I found myself eavesdropping recently on a newsgroup devoted entirely to bashing Barney . Alt.tv.dinosaurs.barney.die.die.die is the place to go if you think the big purple guy may cause cavities ( of tooth or brain ) in his young fans . Messages about Barney -- a.k.a &quot; the purple pervert &quot; and &quot; the spongy one &quot; -- included the news that Barney had been named ( for unstated reasons ) in a $ 77.9-million lawsuit . A woman added_to the group ' s growing body of &quot; Insidious Barney Symbolism Theories , &quot; by reporting , &quot; My 3-year-old daughter and I have come_to the same conclusion : That Barney is a sick representation of a phallic object. &quot; That prompted another group member to respond : &quot; Now that you mention it , I think I can see it . Gives all new meaning to ' I love you . You love me . . . . ' &quot; And , of course , there were the Barney song parodies , including : I hate you . You hate me . We ' re gonna go_out and kill Barney . And the shots rang_out and Barney hit the floor . No more purple dinosaur ! This is nothing more_than good clean spleen . I have yet to encounter the really Dark Side of the Force . More and more Internet users are apparently playing rough , engaging in nasty electronic encounters known as flame wars . Wired magazine ran a recent story about the feud between a group of cat lovers and a group called alt.tasteless , who stopped swapping dead-baby jokes long enough to torment the feline enthusiasts with cruel postings , such_as a request for a recipe for Polynesian cat . Turks and Armenians have apparently taken their ancient differences with them into cyberspace . But so far I ' ve only seen the sunny side of the Infobahn . One of my favorite things about computers is how playful they are . Last time I went_into Microsoft Word to edit a story , the program sent me the following tip of the day : &quot; Did you know you can hurt yourself if you run with scissors ? &quot; Is this a great technology , or what ? A Final Word Almond . My new computer is definitely almond .</TEXT>
