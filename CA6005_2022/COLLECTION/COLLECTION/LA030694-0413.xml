   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN RIVERS ; A CRUISE BETWEEN ST . PETERSBURG AND MOSCOW , ALONG THE WATERWAYS OF THE CZARS , REVEALS RUSSIA ' S HIDDEN HEART</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Peter the Great loved water . He learned to sail at the age of 12 ; he studied navigation and shipbuilding ; he even worked in the shipyards of Amsterdam -- after he had become czar . He also built the first Russian navy and commanded ships in successful sea battles against the Turks and Swedes . And in 1703 , on the Neva River delta , he founded the great , lovely , canal-laced seaport of St . Petersburg , which became known as &quot; the Venice of the North. &quot; St . Petersburg was a glorious city , a miracle of 18th-Century town_planning . Built literally from the ground up -- and the ground was a morass of marshland and islets -- it grew_into a complex of about 35 # 000 buildings , many of them designed by architects imported from Switzerland , Italy , Germany , France and Scotland . Peter stocked St . Petersburg with aristocratic families , distinguished merchants , artisans of every kind . Science , art and literature flourished . In 1712 , he declared it capital of the Russian Empire . Today , St . Petersburg -- having been renamed Petrograd and then Leningrad in the meantime -- has reclaimed its historic identity , and reminders of its former glory are everywhere . Golden domes and soaring spires are still reflected in its canals , and the vivid yellows , greens , reds and blues of its rococo and neoclassical palaces have a stage-set brilliance -- especially when illuminated by the sharp-etched light of the setting sun . Catherine the Great ' s famed Hermitage may be in_trouble -- plagued by vandalism , threatened by unstable riverbank soil and humidity -- but its stunning Rembrandts , Picassos and Matisses and its gold-and-crystal chandeliers are still bathed in limpid , northern light bounced up through the windows off the Neva . And on the quayside , in the city ' s working port district , a brass_band props_up a notice reading , in English : &quot; All the money you provide will be used to revive the great cultural heritage of our city. &quot; They are playing &quot; Tiger Rag. &quot; We ' ve come_to the port to board the M / V Sergei Kirov , a sleek , 1988-vintage German-built riverboat that is to take us , and about 250 other passengers , from St . Petersburg to Moscow . In a way , this is another legacy of Peter the Great and his love for water . Today , an intricate network of lakes , canals , rivers and reservoirs connects the two cities , passing_through some of the most beautiful countryside in the Russian heartland , past remote islands and villages hard to visit any other way . Peter didn ' t construct this network himself , but he inspired it and got_it started . In 1961 , these waterways were opened_to Russian tourism ; in 1991 , foreign visitors were invited to ply the route for the first time . It used to take the czars and their families 18 days to make the cruise . We took 11 , including two nights each in St . Petersburg and Moscow , using the Kirov as our hotel . And an international hotel it was : The boat ' s captain and crew were Russian ; the chefs were Swiss ( serving food that was light , tasty and occasionally Russian ) ; an English company booked the cruise , and the public relations was American -- personified by a zippy , young , first-generation American-Russian cruise director from San Francisco.The accommodations were well-designed , comfortable double-berth cabins . The night of our departure , the captain made a speech of welcome , and we drank toasts in reddish Russian champagne . Then off we went . Almost at once , the warehouses and factories of the port district gave_way to an almost bucolic landscape of romantically dilapidated homes with vegetable_gardens and little orchards alongside , interspersed with a surprising number of new dachas sprouting along the riverbanks . Then the silver_birch and fir_trees thickened , and we glided almost silently into the twilight . During the night , the Neva bore us into Lake Ladoga , said to be the largest body of fresh_water in Europe , about 136 miles long , 80 miles wide and as deep as 730 feet in some places . The navigation channel was slightly choppy in the brisk wind , and the vast moonlit expanse of water was a dramatic change from the confines of the Neva . The next morning , we sailed out of the lake into the placid Svir River , its banks so densely wooded in places that we felt as if we were sailing through a primeval forest . The air was filled with the sweet scent of sawdust , and we passed small sawmills and great rafts of logs . Then came a long stretch of dachas crowding the river , their backs giving onto more dense woods . Here and there , a fisherman waited patiently at the water ' s edge for a catch of pike , bream , perch or Baltic salmon . All the way to Moscow , we were to pass_through landscapes like this one -- riverfront communities with what looked_like sheer wilderness behind them . When we docked at the tiny village of Svirstroi , our captain went ashore to go mushrooming . We decided to explore on our own , penetrating the edge of the woods and walking over a carpet of green , gold and gray lichen . My wife picked a spectacular red-and-white spotted mushroom , and over garden fences , on our way back to the boat , we showed it proudly to villagers stacking birch logs for winter . Our mushroom was a source of much excited gesturing . One toothless babushka slapped her head and grabbed her throat when she saw it . It was apparently the most poisonous mushroom in all_of Russia , and we carefully disposed_of it . That evening , we glided into Lake Onega and docked at Kizhi Island , now an open-air museum of ancient wooden farm and church architecture . The next morning , light seemed to dance through the air as the rising sun glanced off the silvery aspen wood scales covering the 22 onion domes clustered atop the island ' s Preobrazhenskawa Church , or Church of the Transfiguration . Our guide to the island was a young_woman named Luba , who lived_on Kizhi . Showing us a 19th-Century farmhouse adorned with a fretwork fertility symbol , Luba recounted an old local custom : &quot; If a girl wanted a husband , she would go naked into a young farmer ' s field to wash face and body in dew . When she went again next day , generally boy would be there waiting. &quot; She added dryly , &quot; Later , with collective_farms , it was not so simple. &quot; As the Kirov sailed that afternoon , the domes glowed pink , and a tintinnabulation of joyous bells rang_out . A barge carrying massive logs followed us out of the lake into the Vitegra-Kovzha canal . The countryside now was rolling , hilly . At twilight , with the moon rising , we ascended from the Stygian depths of one lock till the tops of fir_trees welcomed us . The gates opened , and we drifted on , our bows forging moonlit ripples on still , dark waters , the forest a constant brooding presence on either side . The next day , we docked near the fortified monastery at Belozersk , on Beloe Ozero , or White Lake . This vast lakeside complex of towers , bastions , churches and a cathedral once protected local muzhiks or peasants from the Mongol hordes . Badly in need of restoration and bereft_of its monks since the Revolution , it is now imbued with melancholy majesty . Altogether more human was our stop the following day : We sailed down the Sheksna Canal , through the vast Rybinskoe Reservoir , past the river port of Rybinsk and down an arm of the fabled Volga_River to the fortress-monastery of Yaroslavl , the oldest city on the river . The monastery compound is now a public park , where the citizens of Yaroslavl , temporarily escaping their cramped living quarters , relax in a tree-shaded courtyard ablaze with flower beds . We inspected the doors of the monks ' cells , purposely made extremely narrow to discourage them from overeating , and marveled at the highly ornamented Church of the Epiphany , with its 17th-Century frescoes by local artists . At Uglich , a sleepy , leafy Volga town dating_from the 10th Century , we wandered among the Sunday shoppers . The food_shop on the main_street smelled of black_bread and pickles . Customers carrying milk_cans lined_up for milk , smoked fish , sausage , buckwheat and Mars bars -- a confection seemingly ubiquitous in Russia today ; the cashiers added_up purchases by abacus . Uglich is a religious town . The church in the local kremlin , or fortress , is now a museum -- but people still pray there before an icon of the_Virgin Mary , whose veil is said to have floated down the Volga to the town . Passing_through a progression of locks below Dubna on the final leg of our journey , we entered the Moskva River and were soon moored in the Russian_capital itself . On the day we left Moscow -- traveling_by plane this time , not boat -- another 250 passengers boarded the Sergei Kirov for a cruise in the other direction , downstream to St . Petersburg . I wished for a moment that I could join them , relishing once again that slow boat through the Russian heartland .
