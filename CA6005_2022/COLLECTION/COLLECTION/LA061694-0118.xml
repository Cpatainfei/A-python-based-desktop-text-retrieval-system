   <HEADLINE> THE FOOT THAT FITS THE GOLDEN BOOT ; THERE ARE NO SHOO-INS , AS ANY STRIKER FROM ASPRILLA TO ZAGUINHO COULD WALK AWAY WITH TROPHY AS CUP ' S LEADING GOAL-SCORER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In 1990 , it was the wild eyes , the outstretched arms , the joyous celebrations of Italy ' s Salvatore ( Toto ) Schillaci that fired the fans ' imagination . In 1986 , it was the smooth skills , the fluid motion , the calm demeanor and the deadly finishing of England ' s Gary Lineker that won their applause . In 1982 , it was Italy ' s Paolo Rossi who captured their hearts . In 1978 , it was Argentina ' s Mario Kempes who grabbed their attention . Every World Cup has had its leading goal-scorer , the player who finds the back of the net more often than anyone else . Sometimes , he is already famous , like West Germany ' s Gerd Muller in 1970 or Portugal ' s Eusebio in 1966 . Other times he is a relatively unknown player who suddenly is thrust into the international spotlight , like Poland ' s Grzegorz Lato in 1974 or Yugoslavia ' s Drazen Jerkovic in 1962 . Either way , he is the man with the golden boot , the player goalkeepers come_to fear more_than any other . In the 64-year history of the World Cup , 16 players have had the honor of being the tournament ' s top marksman . There have been only 14 tournaments , but three players tied for the award in 1934 . Among those 16 , one name stands_out : Just Fontaine , who was born in Morocco but played for France , scored an astonishing 13 goals in the 1958 World Cup in Sweden . It is a record that seems unlikely to be broken . &quot; Dark , sturdily built , a fast and determined runner with excellent acceleration and a fine shot &quot; -- that ' s how English journalist Brian Glanville described Fontaine in his book , &quot; The History of the World Cup. &quot; Look_at that description again . It takes more_than the ability to strike the ball hard and accurately to be a world-class goal-scorer . One has to be tough , durable and able to withstand the furious onslaught of the world ' s best defenders . One also has to be fast , not only fleet of foot but quick-thinking . Some strikers are described as &quot; instinctive , &quot; but more often there is considerable guile and cunning in their makeup . Lineker , for example , used to &quot; hide &quot; behind defenders , according to Denmark ' s Kent Nielsen . &quot; It ' s more like chess than soccer against him , &quot; Nielsen said . &quot; He ' s always hiding behind a defender . He never does much until you suddenly realize that he ' s done exactly enough , and by then it ' s too late. &quot; Lineker , now playing in Japan , was the Golden Boot winner as top scorer of the 1986 World Cup in Mexico with six goals . Six , in fact , seems to be the magic_number needed . Each of the four most recent winners -- Schillaci , Lineker , Rossi and Kempes -- had that many . Gone are the days of Muller , &quot; Der Bomber , &quot; who scored a record 14 World Cup goals , including 10 in the 1970 tournament in Mexico . Or of Fontaine , and Hungary ' s Sandor Kocsis , with 11 in 1954 . Nowadays , scoring a half-dozen goals is likely to be enough to be proclaimed the world ' s top striker . So , who are the candidates to become the goal-scoring hero of 1994 ? Which of the many first-class forwards who have come_to the United States will emerge as the tournament ' s top marksman during the next month ? Here , in alphabetical order , are 10 of the players with a very good chance : LUIS ROBERTO ALVES ( MEXICO ) Better known as Zaguinho , this tall , left-footed striker made Mexican soccer history when he scored a national team-record seven goals in a 9-0 rout of Martinique during the 1993 CONCACAF Gold Cup tournament , which Mexico won . His dribbling skills and shooting ability make him a threat from almost anywhere , although he prefers the left side . Zaguinho , 27 , was nicknamed in honor of his Brazilian father , Zague , who played for many years in the Mexican League . If Mexico does_well , Zaguinho could be the star of the tournament . FAUSTINO ASPRILLA ( COLOMBIA ) How popular is Asprilla , 24 , in his native_land ? Well , one Colombian radio_station keeps reporters permanently in Italy and carries live commentary on every match_played by his club , Parma . The Italian team paid $ 4 million to acquire Asprilla from Atletico Nacional in 1992 . He has exceptional speed , a deadly shot and an unpredictable temperament . His scoring was instrumental in helping Parma win the European Cup Winners ' Cup in 1993 and reach the final again this year . One of nine children , he was born in poverty-stricken Tulua , near Cali . According to no less an authority than Portugal ' s Eusebio , Asprilla has &quot; all_the qualities necessary to become a world-class star. &quot; GABRIEL BATISTUTA ( ARGENTINA ) The soft-spoken striker from Reconquista , a rural town in the province of Santa Fe , says he wants to emulate Mario Kempes , whose six goals propelled Argentina to its first World Cup triumph in 1978 . The 25-year-old , now playing for Fiorentina in Italy , has all_of the credentials . He was the top scorer in the 1991 Copa America in Chile and scored both goals in the final against Mexico in the 1993 Copa America in Ecuador . Batistuta has 18 goals in 28 internationals . &quot; Scoring a goal is just the best feeling for a striker , &quot; he said . &quot; But it ' s difficult to describe. &quot; BEBETO ( BRAZIL ) Even though he turned 30 this year , Bebeto remains one of the world ' s top forwards . Two seasons ago , he was the leading scorer in Spain with 29 goals for Deportivo la Coruna , the club he joined after leaving Vasco da Gama . He had the distinction of scoring against every Spanish First Division club except one . This season , he again ranked among the league ' s scoring leaders . He is small and seemingly frail , but opponents have learned just how strong and elusive he is . His ball-control skills are second to none , some of them having been taught to him by the great Zico . Bebeto scored five of Brazil ' s 20 goals in World Cup qualifying play . DENNIS BERGKAMP ( NETHERLANDS ) Never mind Marco Van Basten , Ruud Gullit and all_the rest , it is Bergkamp at whose feet Holland ' s future lies . Widely proclaimed to be the next great Dutch star , Bergkamp this season made the move from Ajax Amsterdam to the rarefied atmosphere of Italy ' s first division . He and Internazionale of Milan took some time to hit it off , but the Dutch striker won his place in the fans ' hearts by helping the team win the UEFA Cup , salvaging an otherwise forgettable season . Bergkamp was discovered as a teen-ager by none other_than Johan Cruyff and learned the ropes with Cruyff ' s old club , Ajax , where he played alongside Van Basten . Bergkamp averaged 25 goals a season for three years in Holland before moving south . At 25 , he is ready to show his ability to score more_than a goal every_other game for the national team is no fluke . He has superb skills , and his finishing touch is second to none . Confidence to perform on the largest stage might be his only weakness at the moment , but the World Cup should cure that . ILIE DUMITRESCU ( ROMANIA ) The shadow of Gheorghe Hagi has lain across the Romanian team for quite a while , but in the past year or so Dumitrescu has emerged as a player who can steal some of the attention from his more illustrious teammate . Like Bergkamp , Dumitrescu is 25 and has tremendous technique . His goals are often spectacular , and he has been scoring them with greater frequency of late . The Steaua Bucharest star has collected nine goals in Romania ' s last seven matches and looks certain to be signed by a wealthier club , perhaps in Italy , if his World Cup goes according to plan . His partner in the Romanian attack , Florin Raducioiu , already plays for AC Milan . Between them , Dumitrescu and Raducioiu scored 12 of Romania ' s 29 goals in its qualifying campaign . JUERGEN KLINSMANN ( GERMANY ) Not many players have enjoyed as much success as Klinsmann , whose quickness , control and finishing ability make him perhaps the most lethal weapon in the German arsenal . His honors speak_for themselves : World Cup winner in 1990 ; UEFA Cup winner in 1991 ; top scorer in the Bundesliga in 1988 ; Olympic Games bronze medalist in ' 88 ; German player of the year in ' 88 . He has achieved fame and fortune in three countries -- Germany , Italy and most recently France , where he plays for AS Monaco . He is said to be heading back to Italy on a two-year , $ 1.5-million contract with Sampdoria after the World Cup . At 29 , he is still at the peak of his game . Not_bad for a baker ' s son from Stuttgart . ROMARIO ( BRAZIL ) Having had to deal with the kidnaping and subsequent release of his father in Rio de Janeiro earlier this year , Romario has dedicated himself anew to the sport . &quot; The only way I can repay the Brazilian people for all_the support they gave me is by scoring goals and helping to win the World Cup , &quot; he said . He is certainly in form to do so , having just inherited Bebeto ' s Spanish League scoring title by accumulating 30 goals for league champion Barcelona . Romario , a silver medalist in the 1988 Olympics in which he was the top scorer with seven goals , helped PSV Eindhoven win three Dutch championships before he moved to Spain for $ 4 million . Recalled to the Brazilian team for the final World Cup qualifying game against Uruguay , he scored both goals in a 2-0 victory that purchased Brazil ' s ticket to the World Cup . His left foot is his main weapon . HRISTO STOICHKOV ( BULGARIA ) For three consecutive years , Stoichkov was Bulgaria ' s player of the year . But it was not until the volatile striker was lured to Spain by Barcelona that he achieved worldwide fame . Since Stoichkov joined the club , Barcelona has won four Spanish championships in a row , with their Bulgarian star a key contributor to each one . In frequent trouble with referees because of his explosive temper , the 28-year-old nonetheless has sublime skills . He can set_up goals , as he does for Bulgaria , or score them , as he does for Barcelona . In the 1990-91 season , he scored 38 goals . No one in Europe did better . Two seasons ago , he banged in 20 . This season , while teaming_up front with Brazil ' s Romario , who led the Spanish League with 30 goals , Stoichkov still was able to score 16 . Strangely , he has not done as well for the national team , but Bulgaria is confident Stoichkov will remedy that in the next few weeks . RACHIDI YEKINI ( NIGERIA ) Four years ago , Yekini could have been a huge star , as big as if not bigger than Cameroon ' s Roger Milla . But because Nigeria lost its final qualifying game to Cameroon when a tie would have been enough to send it to Italy , it was Milla , not Yekini , who achieved stardom in Italia ' 90 . Now , Yekini , 30 , has one last chance to grab the global spotlight . He is ready , judging by his performance at the African_Nations ' Cup in Tunisia in March . He finished as the championship ' s top goal-scorer with five goals as Nigeria won the title . Earlier , he had recorded eight of Nigeria ' s 17 goals in its World Cup qualifying campaign . And before that , he had been the leading scorer at the 1992 African_Nations Cup in Ivory_Coast . Tall and powerfully built , he is unafraid of opposing defenders , which helped him become the top striker in the Portuguese League this season with 21 goals for Vitoria Setubal . He deservedly was voted Africa ' s player of the year for 1993 . * There are a dozen or more other strikers of outstanding ability taking_part in World Cup ' 94 . Defending champion Germany , for example , also has Karlheinz Riedle and Rudi Voeller . Italy has Giuseppe Signori , the leading scorer in the Italian League in each of the last two seasons . In addition to Batistuta , Argentina can count_on the services of Abel Balbo and Claudio Caniggia , if the latter can recover his form after a yearlong ban for cocaine use . Switzerland ' s Stephane Chapuisat and Adrian Knup make_up one of the deadliest duos in the tournament . Another team with a fierce 1-2 punch is Sweden , which boasts Martin Dahlin and Tomas Brolin . Then there are Belgium ' s Josip Weber , Colombia ' s Adolfo Valencia , Spain ' s Julio Salinas , Russia ' s Sergei Yuran and a host of others . All in all , this could be a high-scoring World Cup . Italia ' 90 produced an average of 2.21 goals a game , the lowest in the event ' s history . But with the talent available in 1994 , that figure easily could be improved on . After all , even the tournament ' s mascot is named Striker .</TEXT>
