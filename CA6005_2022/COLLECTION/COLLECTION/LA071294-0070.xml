   <HEADLINE> SCOTT HARRIS : ALLERGIC REACTION TO MEDIA ' S O.J. MANIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was a well-earned night of vegetation , of slouching on the sofa with channel changer in_hand . It had been a long day , and the last thing I wanted was to watch the news . So I punched up ESPN . All sports . All the time . What I wanted were the baseball highlights . We ' re all entitled to an escape , right ? But ESPN ' s &quot; SportsCenter &quot; wanted me to wait . Their top story was everybody ' s top story -- a double homicide that has already gotten more ink and more air time than most wars . And it ticked me off . I can ' t tell you how it ticked me off . I felt_like throwing the channel changer at the TV . I felt_like calling ESPN and saying : &quot; You jerks ! You jock-sniffers ! Murder is not a sport ! Who do you think you are -- Court TV ? ! ? &quot; Instead , I went searching for my new favorite show , which is called &quot; Anything but O.J. &quot; It ' s not as though the Simpson case doesn ' t interest me . It does . I ' ll admit to intermittent moments of fascination . But I couldn ' t even watch the famously riveting freeway chase for more_than a_couple_of minutes . Not long after the first news of the murders , I seemed to develop an allergic_reaction . My diagnosis suggests a combination of factors . One is almost too common to mention . Simply put , I never rooted for a football_player more_than I rooted for O.J. Why , in one semi-glorious season in junior_high , I was lucky enough to be assigned O.J. ' s No . 32 , further stoking my superstar fantasies . So inside the adult lingers the hurt of an adolescent who fears that he ' s been betrayed . Has the say-it-ain ' t-so sentiment ever been felt so widely and so deeply ? But there ' s another reason for my aversion : the sheer gaudiness of the spectacle . The Simpson case is the Las Vegas of media events -- a grotesque perversion of sensible values . Most of us , I suspect , know the difference between a big story and an important story . Important stories are supposed to be big . But , as the Simpson case demonstrates , an enormous , humongous , Gargantuan story doesn ' t have to be all that important . The point here isn ' t to minimize the pain of the victims and their families . Nor is it to minimize the concerns about domestic violence raised by the Simpson case . But sadly , there are many other victims and many other families who do not make headlines . It ' s the convergence of two great American pastimes -- celebrity worship and the voyeurism inspired by &quot; sensational &quot; crimes -- that has made this the biggest story of the moment . The people who manage American media believe that the public can ' t get enough O.J. The spousal abuse stories , however worthwhile , represent an effort by the media to find deeper meaning to the Simpson case and , perhaps , to salvage a measure of self-respect . Concern over spousal abuse is not why a division of TV trucks are camped outside the Criminal_Courts Building . And it ' s not why the networks went live from the preliminary hearing . Rather , the Simpson case is the latest and perhaps greatest monument to the way American culture so routinely perceives heinous crime as a source of entertainment , eclipsing the sagas of Amy Fisher , the Menendez family and the Bobbitts . When the Simpson case reaches its resolution , it would be interesting to count and compare the TV hours and print coverage devoted to these great L.A. stories -- the Rodney King riot , the Northridge earthquake and the Simpson case . Hell , it would be interesting to compare them now . There is something wrong here , and that ' s why I hope the O.J. allergy is contagious . It was good to learn that fans of daytime soap_operas , for example , made_it clear they prefer to be entertained by the fiction of regular programming than the sad facts of the Simpson case . Like most journalists , I ' ve hyped a story or three , so I can empathize with the programmers , producers and editors who want to cover every angle , every detail of the Simpson case . If criticized , they ' ll defend their decisions by saying they are merely giving you what you want . Don ' t blame the messenger -- blame the audience . Obviously , they need our help . Letters are good . But the most effective protest is to simply change the channel . They ' ll get the message -- and print will follow TV ' s lead . And in time , maybe O.J. mania will settle_down into the more appropriate levels of a sensational story of little social consequence -- which , if you consider recent examples , is plenty . So it isn ' t that I don ' t find the Simpson case interesting . It ' s a good whodunit , particularly given the desire to believe it was some random psycho and not O.J. But of all_the O.J. conversations I ' ve had in recent weeks , the most interesting wasn ' t a dissection of the evidence , an exchange of tasteless jokes or the speculative casting of the made-for-TV movies to come . Rather , it was an exchange with a visitor from Sweden describing her arrival in Washington , D.C. &quot; When I turned_on the TV , &quot; she told me , &quot; there was this picture of a white truck on the freeway . The police were trying to arrest this Simpson man for murder . And I was wondering , ' Who is this Simpson ? ' &quot; Oh , to be blessed with such ignorance . Scott Harris ' column appears Tuesdays , Thursdays and Sundays . Readers may write to Harris at the Times Valley Edition , 20000 Prairie St. , Chatsworth , Calif . 91311 . The Simpson case is the Las Vegas of media events -- a grotesque perversion of sensible values .</TEXT>
