   <HEADLINE> INSIST ON REPLACING THE FUEL RODS IN JULY ; NORTH_KOREA : A REFUSAL BY KIM WOULD BE A CLEAR SIGNAL OF THE NEED FOR SANCTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It is difficult for the North_Koreans even to pretend that they have not completed at least one nuclear_weapon . Defense_Secretary William Perry recently indicated as much on national television and , shortly after taking_office , Central Intelligence Director R . James Woolsey Jr . stated that the Democratic People ' s Republic_of_Korea probably had separated enough plutonium for at least one first-generation &quot; device. &quot; Diplomacy to dissuade the North from going nuclear lost its utility sometime in 1991 or 1992 , to judge by the evidence gathered during the incomplete international inspections . Sometime during the administration of President Bush , North_Korea crossed the line from having a nuclear-weapons program but not enough fissile material to build a bomb , to assembling its first device . It not only has enough plutonium for at least one weapon ; it has probably built it . While the Bush_Administration looked the other way , the door shut on the opportunity to deter North_Korean proliferation . Now the Clinton_Administration must contain the North ' s nuclear ambitions . The three goals should be : to ensure that the North never uses its nuclear arsenal , small though it may be ; to forestall the construction of even more nuclear_weapons , and to see the North ' s nuclear capability dismantled . A fourth aim , if North_Korea does not respond rationally to these initiatives , is to prevent the outbreak of a second Korean_War . For the moment , there is no alternative to living with a nuclear North , while mobilizing world support to ensure that Kim Il Sung finds it difficult to add_to his atomic stockpile and is provided inducements to dismantle it . Many say that it is time to consider sanctions to force North_Korea to accept full International Atomic Energy Agency inspections . But it is difficult to enact sanctions and harder still to enforce them without the enthusiastic participation of South_Korea , China and Japan , the nations that should be the most concerned about an evolving nuclear threat on the Korean_peninsula . Nonetheless , sanctions remain one of the few instruments of coercion left short of war . But they must be requested by Asian_nations , not the United States alone . A critical_point is approaching that presents to the international community both an opportunity and a danger . The North has operated a 30-megawatt reactor for many years . Nuclear physics dictates that July would be the best time for the routine of extracting the reactor ' s load of uranium fuel rods and their plutonium . Although Ashton Carter , assistant secretary_of_defense for international security affairs , has suggested that the shutdown could safely be postponed for roughly a year , it is in the interest of non-proliferation to see that the core is removed expeditiously and under safeguards ; that is , in July , not indefinitely later . Instead of setting dates for additional inspections of the reprocessing plant at Yongbyon , the U.N. Security_Council should call_on North_Korea to replace the reactor core this summer , with the IAEA observing to ensure against diversion of the plutonium . The spent fuel rods should be removed from the country . Since the North_Koreans do not need to reprocess the uranium to support their existing and planned reactors , this represents no hardship to the country -- if it still desires a non-nuclear Korean_peninsula , as it has repeatedly asserted . The plutonium has some potential value as a supplement to reactor fuel , and the government could be compensated generously for that resource , even if such payment were perceived as being a payoff for good behavior . If , however , North_Korea intends to expand its nuclear arsenal , as the evidence of the last IAEA inspection indicates , refusal of the Security_Council order would be a clear signal . The world community would be justified in_using some means of coercion to get North_Korea to live_up_to its treaty obligations to become and remain a non-nuclear-armed state .</TEXT>
