   <HEADLINE> ALL-OUT EFFORT OF ELECTION WORKERS , TROOPS SAVES S . AFRICA VOTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This country ' s historic elections seemed doomed at 3:30 a.m. one day this week when a convoy of trucks carrying thousands of newly printed ballots stopped on the outskirts of this volatile black township to ask an army patrol for an escort . The third and final day of the election , Thursday , was about to dawn . Many of the 16 polling_stations in Thokoza had yet to see a ballot ; tens of thousands of angry voters had been turned_away . But the soldiers refused , saying they needed an order from their commanders in Pretoria . Ken Weinberg , a retired U.S. Navy officer and logistics consultant for the Independent Electoral Commission , punched the number of the Defense Force command into his cellular_telephone . The army major who answered said he wanted to help but his force was stretched too thin . &quot; Major , &quot; Weinberg said , &quot; I hate to be melodramatic here , but if you don ' t want this area to burn tomorrow , you had better get me some troops right now. &quot; &quot; Mr. Weinberg , &quot; came the reply , &quot; they ' ll be there in 45 minutes. &quot; South_Africa ' s first democratic elections this week came_close to collapsing when millions of voters flooded under-equipped and , in some cases , unequipped polling_stations for the first full day of voting Wednesday . But it was rescued Thursday and Friday by the army , the air_force and the remarkable work of almost 300 # 000 election workers , who , facing a seemingly impossible task , refused to give_up . &quot; I ' ll tell you , it was wild , &quot; Weinberg said Friday after 54 hours without sleep . &quot; People came_to the polls that first day as if we were giving_out free Hershey bars . We never expected so many. &quot; From the beginning , a host of problems faced election officials , who had just four months to launch a voter education drive , print ballots , hire poll workers , arrange security and draw_up a plan to make the election work . The original plan , election officials now acknowledge , was weak and full of misjudgments . But , when the Inkatha Freedom Party agreed to participate in the elections just a week before the voting was to begin , the plan began to fall_apart . Each of the 9 # 000 polling_stations needed a host of materials , including invisible ink to mark voters ' hands , pencils , batteries , ultraviolet_lamps , steel boxes , stamps , ink pads , and , of course , separate ballots for the national and provincial elections . But , with Inkatha in the race , election officials now also needed an Inkatha sticker for each of the 80 million ballots and nearly 1 # 000 new polling_stations in former no-go areas of Inkatha ' s home base , KwaZulu . Election officials had not ordered enough materials for extra polling_places , and they were in_trouble . &quot; We began robbing Peter to pay Paul , &quot; admitted one official , who asked not to be named . At polling_stations in urban_areas , such_as Thokoza , boxes of materials arrived , already opened and missing everything from batteries to ink pads . Some presiding officers in remote regions arrived_at their polling_stations to find no materials at all . Although they had 80 million ballots , for an expected 21.7 million voters , the distribution system was inadequate ( and now is the subject of a police_investigation ) . That was complicated by the system that allowed South_Africans to cast their ballots wherever they chose , resulting in long lines at some places and no lines at others . The Inkatha stickers didn ' t arrive_at dozens , perhaps hundreds , of polling_places . In some stations , voters were urged to write in the name of Inkatha if they wanted to vote for that party . At others , presiding officers wrote the name in themselves , at the bottom of the ballot , and hand-drew a square to hold the voters ' X . Late Wednesday , with just one day of voting remaining , Inkatha President Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi was complaining loudly about the lack of stickers for his party and threatening to pull_out of the elections . Almost every_other party , including the African National Congress and President Frederik W . de Klerk ' s National Party , the two most powerful , complained about ballot shortages . Johann Kriegler -- the election_commission chairman , a judge and head of South_Africa ' s Lawyers for Human_Rights -- battled reporters ' questions before finally admitting serious inadequacies in the voting . But , as the head of the panel empowered to declare the elections free and fair , he pleaded with South_Africans not to expect a perfect election . Inside the electoral commission headquarters the mood was gloomy . &quot; It ' s a disaster , it ' s a disaster , &quot; moaned one young white election official . &quot; We ' ve failed. &quot; But others , believing that there was still time to salvage the election , stepped_forward . &quot; We can ' t give_up yet , &quot; Weinberg remembered telling the election official . &quot; We can make this work somehow. &quot; That launched a giant , mid-election effort to rescue the voting . Dozens of printing_companies across the country were called to print ballots , and their crews worked all night Wednesday to create more_than 9 million new ballots , each with the Inkatha and party leader Buthelezi ' s name at the bottom . It was a rush job . When one printer complained that his workers had been_on the job for 12 straight hours , a logistics officer appealed_to his patriotism and prevailed . Informed by another printer that it would take an extra hour to bind the ballots and number them , Weinberg , who was fielding urgent requests from around the country for tens of thousands of ballots , told him not to bother . Thousands of extra pens , ink pads and other items were also ordered . And in the early hours of Thursday , airplanes and trucks fanned_out across the country to deliver the new materials and ballots . The South_African air_force , which dispatched 50 planes and helicopters to the remotest reaches of the country , called its mission Operation Jamba . It turned_out to be the largest peacetime mission in the force ' s history . The election rescue succeeded in most of the country . Bongi Msimang , a 37-year-old primary_school principal and presiding officer at a voting station in Thokoza , had battled angry voters all day Wednesday when the ballots never arrived . &quot; Fortunately , I was able to control them by asking them to be patient , &quot; she said . Lacking a working phone , she had to rely_on urgent messages delivered personally by her voting officers to the election_commission headquarters . &quot; We didn ' t know what was going_on , &quot; she said . &quot; Even my superior didn ' t know the truth. &quot; But at 4 a.m. Thursday , Msimang was awakened by a phone_call at her Thokoza home . The ballots , escorted by soldiers , had arrived . &quot; I ' m confident everybody who wanted to vote got the chance , &quot; she said Friday . In Thokoza , and in large sections of the country , the election was saved . But it wasn ' t enough in six former black homelands of South_Africa , where voting had to be extended_to Friday . Ronald Gould , a Canadian hired as South_Africa ' s chief election officer , urged the country Friday to be patient with the vote count . He said officials at 700 counting stations would begin tabulating the vote early today and that it might take two or three days for the final results to be known . &quot; We ' re not running a fast-food operation here , where we would have well-organized , well-provisioned franchises , &quot; Gould explained . &quot; We already have some known problems , and we will have some unknown problems. &quot; But the electoral commission , and the officials who worked night and day to make the election work , were relieved when every polling_station finally closed its doors late Friday . They expected challenges to the election from various political_parties . But they were confident that they would be able to call the exercise free and fair .</TEXT>
