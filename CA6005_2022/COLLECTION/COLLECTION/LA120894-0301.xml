   <HEADLINE> QUAKE TEAM DOWNPLAYS CODE FLAWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A team of engineers commissioned by the state to examine the effects of the Northridge earthquake has found that in many cases , failures of design , construction and inspection caused more damage than building_code deficiencies . Despite the widespread calls_for tougher codes immediately following the Jan . 17 earthquake , case studies of 27 buildings yielded evidence that much of the typical damage could have been prevented by inexpensive measures to better enforce the current code , state officials said . Faults pinpointed in the study included missing joint reinforcement , gaps in wood framing , discrepancies between a designer ' s assumptions and actual field conditions and a design with incomplete paths for the distribution of seismic forces . The report also shows that retrofitting helped prevent damage in some cases and not in others , depending_on how well it was done . Drawn in part from that study , recommendations being presented to the state Seismic Safety Commission today in Sacramento will focus primarily on how to ensure that the code is followed . &quot; Overall , the recommendation is that quality_control , doing what we do , but doing_it better is the fundamental recommendation , rather than change the code , &quot; said L . Thomas Tobin , executive_director of the Seismic Safety Commission . &quot; We believe a good portion of the damage in the earthquake was_due to a failure of quality_control , either through design by the engineer or architect or plan checking , construction or inspection , &quot; Tobin said . Among the proposals will be a requirement that architects and engineers identify all seismic features in their plans and that local building officials specifically inspect those features . Also , the commission staff will recommend that the architect or engineer personally inspect the project during construction . &quot; We have to get_the_best pair of eyes out on_the_job , the individual who designs the building , &quot; said Fred Turner , the commission ' s staff structural engineer . &quot; Quite often , when you get_out in the field , you may see the opportunity for improvements , oversights in design . You can resolve construction difficulties . You can even learn so your construction process is better. &quot; The study was coordinated by consulting engineers Rutherford and Chekene of San Francisco , which retained other engineers for the 27 case studies . A draft was shown to the Seismic Safety Commission in October . Its findings , incorporated into staff recommendations that are expected to be adopted early next year , shed_light_on some of the most spectacular -- and unexpected -- building failures . The team investigating the Bullocks department_store in Northridge Fashion Center , for example , found that it was designed with &quot; an inadequate lateral system consisting_of discontinuous shear walls &quot; which , in_effect , bounced up and down independently , punching through the concrete floor beneath . The engineers concluded that had the earthquake lasted longer , the Broadway department_store in Northridge Fashion Center could have collapsed because of the failure of columns around the escalators . Those columns , which were not part of the building ' s seismic apparatus , were unable to sway with the exterior frame and broke instead . Among the other problems at the Broadway , masonry walls were poorly fastened to the building frame , because of the difficulty of grouting such walls , causing them to move independently . One code deficiency was noted in the separation of the Broadway ' s roof from its walls . The engineers said the forces were great enough to have caused the failure even if the 1970 building had been designed to current code . The incompatibility between seismic and load-bearing systems noted at the Broadway was also responsible_for the collapse of the Cal State Northridge parking structure , the report said . Non-seismic columns breaking_in the interior of the garage pulled the exterior frame inward . In several cases , engineers found that retrofitting proved ineffective . The team investigating the Broadway in Topanga Plaza said a retrofitting project helped to keep damage within the design criteria of the building , but that &quot; the inadequate attachment of the original construction walls to their foundation reduced the total resistance provided and led to significantly greater damage than would otherwise have occurred. &quot; In the case of the Bullocks at Northridge Fashion Center , an engineer singled_out an inadequate retooling of the plan improvised just after the 1971 Sylmar earthquake , while the building was under construction . Extra shear walls were added , but consisted_of &quot; shotcrete , &quot; concrete sprayed between existing columns , rather than fastened to them , causing the discontinuous load path . This means that the walls could shake individually rather than transfer the seismic forces through the building . One of the most perplexing findings was that damage often could not be explained by current seismic theoretical models . The seven-story Holiday Inn in Van Nuys , for example , was most heavily reinforced in the lower floors based on the assumption that they would be subject_to the greatest seismic forces . However , damage to the red-tagged building was concentrated_on the fourth and fifth floors . The same pattern showed_up in the Sherman Oaks Towers , a 12-story concrete frame building whose fifth floor was most seriously damaged . Turner , staff structural engineer for the commission , called it &quot; disconcerting &quot; that the actual performance of buildings -- including some that should have failed but didn ' t -- cannot be replicated by currently accepted theory . &quot; We can say that the general performance objectives of the building_code were met , &quot; Turner said . &quot; The troubling aspect is we can ' t answer the question why. &quot; Turner said one recommendation will be to promote more research on the behavior of buildings under seismic stress . Nevertheless , he said , more and quicker improvements in building safety will be realized by &quot; ensuring that we have a better handle on quality_control and attention to detail. &quot;</TEXT>
