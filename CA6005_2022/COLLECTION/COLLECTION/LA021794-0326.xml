   <HEADLINE> BOMB BLOWS_OUT CHURCH WINDOWS ; CRIME : MORMON BUILDING IS AGAIN THE TARGET OF VIOLENCE . ARSON CAUSED $ 1 MILLION DAMAGE IN 1990 ; VANDALS HAVE ALSO BROKEN IN , PAINTING SLOGANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A pipe_bomb blew_out several windowpanes in a Mormon_church before dawn Wednesday , but the small explosion caused no injuries and only minor damage , Los Angeles police said . Police are investigating whether there is any connection between the bombing and several other attacks on the church in recent years , including an arson in May , 1990 , that caused $ 1 million in damage to the building . &quot; We are looking_into anything that might tie these things together , but at this point we don ' t have any evidence that they are connected , &quot; said Sgt . Bob Parsons , of the LAPD ' s criminal conspiracy section , which investigates bombings . Nearly four years ago , a fire set by vandals -- who also apparently smeared feces inside the church -- forced the building to close for 18 months , said Paul Walker , a church official . Then , about six months ago , vandals broke_into the building and spray-painted swastikas and &quot; White Power &quot; slogans inside , Walker said . Police have not made arrests in any of the incidents , authorities said . &quot; It ' s a sign of the times , &quot; said Walker . &quot; You don ' t know if it ' s kids or what , but there are some weak minds out there . . . . We just have to watch our building. &quot; Barbara Myler , a regional representative of the Church of Jesus_Christ of Latter-day_Saints , said the church doesn ' t feel singled_out by this latest incident because &quot; from what we understand , a Jewish synagogue and some churches in this area have been vandalized in recent years . . . . But we can empathize with other religious communities who have been_on the receiving end of this kind of hatred. &quot; In Wednesday ' s incident , an explosion about 4:50 a.m. broke several panes of thick glass at the church , which was empty at the time , police said . Upon arriving , officers discovered an unexploded portion of the bomb that they originally believed was a second pipe_bomb , said Sgt . Frank Reynoso of the Foothill station . As a precaution , several houses and apartments within a block of the church were briefly evacuated , Reynoso said . Mormon public high_school students , who arrive_at the church at about 6 a.m. each weekday for an hour of Scripture studies before going_to their regular schools , were told by phone not to come Wednesday , Myler said .</TEXT>
