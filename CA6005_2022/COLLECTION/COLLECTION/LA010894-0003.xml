   <HEADLINE> IRVINE STAFF THROWS A WRENCH IN EL TORO BOARD PLAN ; COMMITMENT IN WRITING REQUESTED ON ANNEXATION ; WIEDER SAYS CITY IS ' GETTING A LITTLE TOO HOGGISH '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The plan touted as the best possible compromise in the political fight over the future of the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station was thrown into question Friday when Irvine officials demanded that the Board of Supervisors put_in writing the promises they say were made to the city during secret negotiations . An Irvine city staff report released Friday listed a host of written commitments the city is demanding from the county , including a &quot; commitment to allow the annexation of ( the base by Irvine ) prior to January , 1999. &quot; But given the county ' s reluctance so far to formally commit to that and other points -- verbally promising only &quot; discussions &quot; about a possible annexation by Irvine -- it was unclear late Friday whether the latest development was a deal breaker . Irvine City Councilman Barry J . Hammond , who helped negotiate the agreement , said the city has lost millions of dollars in potential tax_revenue from being_on the losing end of previous annexation disputes with the county , and is determined to not lose its battle to incorporate the 4 # 700-acre base within its city_limits when the Marines move_out sometime before 1999 . &quot; We need to get resolution on how we are going_to move ahead &quot; with annexation , Hammond said . &quot; If we cannot get that , that ' s a deal breaker. &quot; Irvine Mayor Michael Ward , however , took a less threatening stand , saying the city simply wants what he contends the county ' s negotiators already agreed to verbally : &quot; Seriously talk to us to get annexation by a certain date. &quot; The language in the staff report released Friday &quot; may be toned_down by the time it gets_to the council &quot; for a vote on Irvine ' s next move scheduled for Tuesday , Ward added . Supervisor William G . Steiner , one of the county ' s key negotiators , took time to study the Irvine staff report Friday , but declined to comment . Supervisor Harriett M . Wieder , however , said she was &quot; disheartened &quot; that Irvine was pressing the annexation issue . Even though Irvine ' s message was sent_out through a staff report , she said it would not have been written without the approval of the council leadership . &quot; They are really causing the plan to go_down the tubes . They are getting a little too hoggish , &quot; Wieder said . Working to hold the deal together , County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider and Irvine City_Manager Paul O . Brady Jr . met late Friday afternoon and agreed to try to &quot; clarify &quot; the annexation issue before the council meets Tuesday . &quot; I am prepared to recommend to the Board of Supervisors that we enter into the discussions on the process of annexation . Not that we are agreeing to annexation , but that we would enter into the discussions , as we would with any other jurisdiction , &quot; Schneider said . Irvine council_members had been expected to formally endorse the compromise agreement Tuesday , and Schneider said he hoped that would still occur . But in the city staff report released Friday , council_members were being urged to send a letter to the supervisors asking_for a written confirmation of their deal by Jan . 18 . The negotiating points should be in_writing , &quot; so that future supervisors follow the procedure , &quot; Ward said . At least two of the five supervisors are expected to leave the board after the November election . The annexation issue &quot; is very important to us , &quot; Hammond said in a separate interview . &quot; We want to make_sure that we , as a city , are the ultimate decision_maker and have the ultimate control over the areas that are in our sphere_of_influence and that are ultimately going_to be in our city limits. &quot; The supervisors purposely omitted the annexation issue from their motion last month when they approved formation of an El Toro planning_board comprised of the five supervisors , three representatives from Irvine and one from Lake Forest . County officials said after the board vote that they would not commit outright to Irvine ' s annexation of the base and other nearby land . Having watched the county ' s tax_base erode in recent years , primarily due_to the formation of new South County cities , officials said the county will not give_away the land without negotiating a share of the tax_revenue expected to come from the land ' s redevelopment . Schneider said after his meeting with the Irvine city_manager that the county cannot agree to annexation until after the base conversion plan is adopted . If the El Toro agency decides to turn the base into a commercial airport , then it has to remain under the county ' s control , and Irvine cannot annex the property , Schneider said . The terms of a $ 300-million bond issue for the John Wayne Airport expansion required that if another airport was developed in Orange County , its operations could not compete with John Wayne , and the county would have to operate both facilities . Schneider also said the county would negotiate a possible annexation agreement with Irvine if the city agrees to &quot; put all tax_revenues on the table , &quot; including property , sales and hotel occupancy taxes . The proposed draft of the letter to be considered by the Irvine council states that the city ' s agreement to join the El Toro agency &quot; was predicated upon confirmation by the ( supervisors ) on several important points which were not entirely identified as part of the ( supervisors ' ) action. &quot; In addition to seeking permission to annex the base , Irvine says it received the county ' s commitment on other key points , including : * A provision that the El Toro board would adopt &quot; impact criteria , &quot; so that any redevelopment plan cannot be approved unless it meets certain requirements designed to mitigate the impact on surrounding communities . * The formation of a legally binding , three-tier &quot; joint powers authority , &quot; consisting_of a board of directors , an executive_council made_up of all 31 Orange County cities , several South County communities in unincorporated areas , business groups and up_to 10 advisory committees . Although the county had assumed that Supervisor Thomas F . Riley would serve as the agency chairman and Supervisor Gaddi H . Vasquez would be vice_chairman , Irvine officials said both positions should &quot; be shared &quot; among the county , Irvine and Lake Forest . Irvine also wants the base conversion plan to be comprehensive , so that the necessary planning , zoning and environmental studies for the site are ready for approval by the county and Irvine . The negotiated agreement &quot; represents the final position of the city of Irvine , &quot; according to the staff report . If an impasse develops , it could reopen once again the contentious debate that has raged for six months over which government_agencies will plan the future use of El Toro , possibly to the benefit of the North County cities that have been denied seats on the governing board under the latest plan . Supervisor Roger R . Stanton warned recently that if the agreement with Irvine fell_apart , the county would consider forming an 11-member planning_board made_up of the five supervisors , a city representative from each of the five supervisorial districts , and an 11th member chosen by the other 10 members . The Lake Forest City_Council , which did not participate in the negotiations that led to the agreement , has refused to officially join the agency until it receives documents detailing the pact . While several other cities have sought seats on the decision-making board , there is universal agreement that the county and Irvine are the two agencies that must be included if the plan is to win Defense_Department approval , since they share land-use authority over the site .</TEXT>
