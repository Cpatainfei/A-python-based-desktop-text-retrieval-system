   <HEADLINE> NEW MEASURE TO HELP VALLEY , OFFICIALS SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They may_not live_in the most crime-ridden corner of California , but violence-weary residents of the San Fernando Valley will surely benefit from the &quot; three strikes , and you ' re out &quot; legislation signed into law Monday by Gov . Pete Wilson , local law_enforcement officials said . Police , prosecutors and even judges said they were unfamiliar_with the fine points of the final version of the bill , approved last week by the state Senate , which is still considering four similar measures that were also passed_by the Assembly . Some have opposed the law as unworkable , too expensive and too Draconian a penalty for many repeat , nonviolent offenders . But now that it is law , they vowed to immediately begin studying it , and using it , as a tool for keeping the Valley ' s most violent offenders off the streets . However the details shake out , most of those interviewed agreed that the message the new law sends -- that third-time felony offenders will be put_away for good -- will have a deterrent effect on criminals . &quot; If you are convicted of these ( three felonies ) , you are gone . There is no way to wiggle out of this , plead out of this , mitigate this . You are removed from society , &quot; said Los Angeles Police Lt . Kyle Jackson . &quot; Will it make_it easier for police_officers ? I think so , I hope so. &quot; Like other law_enforcement officials , Jackson said Valley residents will welcome the law now that the violence once found largely in the inner_city has begun to make its way north of Mulholland Drive and into their tree-lined neighborhoods . In notorious crimes during 1993 , a West Valley woman was slain as she picked_up her daughter at a Bible study class , an elderly man was killed for his Mercedes at a gas_station , a pregnant woman was stabbed to death at an ATM , and a serial child_molester stalked children en route to local schools . Jackson , head of detectives at the LAPD ' s Devonshire Station , which has jurisdiction over the area where some of those attacks occurred , said the law will help police regain the upper_hand on criminals and reassure residents , if only symbolically at first . &quot; The public has no idea how much violent crime occurs ; this will cause the pendulum to swing in a different direction , &quot; Jackson said . The measure doubles the current terms for a second violent or serious felony and mandates a term of 25 years to life for two-time serious or violent offenders who commit any third felony . The bill went_into effect when Wilson signed it Monday ; anyone who commits a crime and is arrested the moment after he signed it will be facing a new and harsher criminal justice system . Prosecutors are now barred from entering into plea bargains , and judges will be severely restricted in their discretion to limit sentences . Some judges predicted that defendants will demand trials when they otherwise would have accepted plea bargains . Opponents said defense_attorneys risk accusations of malpractice if they allow clients to plead guilty to even a first offense if the crime could later be counted as a &quot; strike. &quot; Some defense_lawyers already are preparing to attack the law , contending that life sentences are cruel_and_unusual_punishment when applied to felons convicted of property crimes . Dennis Zine , a veteran Valley police_sergeant and former City_Council candidate , questioned whether the law will survive such attacks after the societal outrage that fueled its passage dies_down . Whether &quot; this is just another window-dressing remedy , or really effective in reducing the number of predators on the street , remains to be seen , &quot; said Zine , now director of the Los Angeles Police Protective League , the officers ' union . Zine said other supposed deterrents , such_as the death_penalty and the &quot; use a gun , go_to prison &quot; law , haven ' t worked because loopholes , political opposition and the judicial process have weakened them . Another outspoken former police official from the Valley area , Ed Davis , said Monday that he supports the concept of the law , whatever its faults and loopholes . Davis said he spent 23 years fighting for better ways to keep repeat violent offenders off the streets , first as police_chief in Los Angeles and then as a state_senator . But he said he was rebuffed time and again by liberals whom he described as being soft_on crime . Now , Davis says , the new law will finally allow police and prosecutors &quot; to slow_down the revolving door &quot; allowing dangerous career criminals in and out of prison . &quot; Right now we lock_up 100 # 000 people at any given time , &quot; said Davis , a former Chatsworth and Santa Clarita resident . &quot; If we have to double that , it ' s the price we have to pay to safeguard us against those who would rape and murder. &quot; In signing the bill into law Monday , Wilson called it the toughest and most sweeping criminal sentencing law in the state ' s history , aimed at putting habitual felons behind bars for life . But Wilson ' s own Corrections Department estimates that the new law will lead to a $ 21-billion prison building boom and a huge increase in operating_costs . And some prosecutors warn that the statute is too broad and may produce unintended consequences . Opponents include Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block and Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti , who described the law Monday as &quot; crazy &quot; but promised to uphold it anyway . Garcetti has said that only violent offenses should be considered in the &quot; three strikes. &quot; Under the law as written , he said , a juvenile with two residential burglary convictions who passes bad_checks years later could wind_up in prison for life . Garcetti ' s prosecutors are largely undecided -- mostly because few understand the law , or have even seen it . After the state Senate passed it last Thursday , a handful of Garcetti ' s top aides began distilling the complex , five-page treatise into terms that prosecutors can understand . They hope to have an understandable memo on prosecutors ' desks by this morning . That will fall well within the 48-hour period in which those arrested after the bill was signed must be arraigned or released , said Assistant Dist . Atty . R . Dan Murphy , one of Garcetti ' s three top aides . Still , Murphy conceded , confusion reigns among prosecutors . &quot; We ' re boiling it down for our lawyers and distilling it for them , into plain old lawyer talk , which isn ' t always all that clear either , &quot; he said . &quot; We have been working furiously over the weekend , &quot; said Murphy . &quot; We don ' t want to have 900 lawyers wading through this five-page bill and coming_to their own conclusions as_to what the law means. &quot; Deputy Dist . Atty . Mike Carroll , who runs the D . A. ' s Van Nuys branch , said he supports the law . &quot; We look_forward to getting_rid_of our career violent offenders , &quot; Carroll said . &quot; I would hope they leave the Valley , leave the county , and leave the state . We could even have a ceremony in which we give them bus tickets. &quot; Deputy Dist . Atty . Robert L . Cohen , who files criminal complaints in the Van Nuys branch , called it &quot; long overdue -- society coddles these people over and over again. &quot; Most prosecutors appeared to support the law in concept , but were unsure which of the four versions in the Legislature was going_into effect . Some were unclear as_to whether the third felony had to be a violent crime . Some prosecutors -- including Garcetti -- expressed concern that any third felony , even a burglary , would lock_up a criminal for life . Others questioned whether juvenile offenses would count . &quot; I think it should apply to juveniles because statistically most of the violent offenses are committed by individuals between the ages of 15 and 16 and about 22 to 24 , &quot; said Deputy Dist . Atty . Peter S . Berman , another prosecutor based in Van Nuys . &quot; It ' s those individuals that if you can stop their careers early enough , you can prevent a lot of violence being perpetrated upon the community. &quot; Berman said he believes that the law would have a deterrent effect , if only to show whether criminals are aware enough of such laws that some will flee to other states where penalties are not so harsh . Deputy Dist . Atty . Carol Fisch , prosecutor of career criminals at Van Nuys and San Fernando courthouses , said many of the people that she is now prosecuting would have fallen_under the new law . &quot; I have a couple right now that have prior murder_convictions from the early ' 70s , &quot; Fisch said , &quot; and they would all fall_into this law because this third offense would put them over the line , and that would be the end of it. &quot; Fisch predicted more of her cases would go_to trial &quot; because people aren ' t going_to plead guilty as readily. &quot; But in the long_run , she said , it will help take the habitual offenders off the streets for good . Instead , employees at the new state_prison in Lancaster could be the ones in contact with those inmates . Critics of the law say it will keep three-time losers locked_up far beyond the point where they are violent or dangerous , and that society will end_up warehousing harmless , aging convicts . Critics also raise the grim possibility that felons , realizing that they are looking_at years behind bars , may decide to leave no witnesses to their crimes . Few academics , judges , prosecutors or defense_lawyers interviewed Monday believed that the &quot; three-strikes &quot; law will deter many of the most violent criminals -- youthful offenders . David Meyers , acting public_defender in Los Angeles , said , &quot; It ' s not going_to do anything about crime . . . . Folks responsible_for crime are youthful . Young people get created all_the time. &quot; Several judges refused to comment . San Fernando Superior_Court Judge Ronald S . Coen , chairman of the Criminal_Law and Procedures Committee of the California Judges Assn. , said his organization voted to take no position on the law . But it did ask Wilson &quot; to look_at the bill and determine the impact that it would have_on judicial discretion and the number of trials that it would create in the criminal justice system. &quot; Judge Judith M . Ashmann , who supervises operations in San Fernando Superior_Court , anticipated that the law would generate more cases , but she said the situation was manageable . &quot; We are going_to do whatever the Legislature says has to be done , &quot; Ashmann said . &quot; If more cases go_to trial , we ' ll accommodate and we ' ll try the cases. &quot; Meyer is a Times staff writer and Mrozek is a special correspondent . Times staff writers Jerry Weintraub and Dan Morain also contributed to this article .</TEXT>
