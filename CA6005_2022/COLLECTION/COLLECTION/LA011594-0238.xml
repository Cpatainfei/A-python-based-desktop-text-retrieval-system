   <HEADLINE> 300 LA HABRA HIGH STUDENTS TO BE TESTED FOR TB ; HEALTH : COUNTY OFFICIALS SAY FAMILY AND CO-WORKERS OF A SENIOR AT THE SCHOOL , WHO HAS BEEN CONTAGIOUS SINCE EARLY LAST YEAR , HAVE ALREADY BEEN SCREENED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tuberculosis skin_tests will be given next week to about 300 La Habra High_School classmates of a senior female student discovered earlier this month to have a contagious form of the disease , county health officials said Friday . Dr. Penny Weismuller , director of infectious-disease control for the Orange County Health_Care Agency , said the student , whom she declined to identify , collapsed at a part-time job Jan . 5 and began coughing_up blood . The girl was taken_to Friendly Hills Regional Medical_Center , where tuberculosis was diagnosed and reported to county health authorities . Weismuller said the girl , who is in the advanced stages of tuberculosis , was sent home from the hospital Monday under medication and won ' t return to school until laboratory tests show that her sputum is no longer infectious . Tuberculosis is spread through the air , usually by coughing . Weismuller said the student has been contagious at least since last February , when she sought treatment from a physician for a persistent cough . She said medical_records show that the physician discovered the student had pneumonia , which did not respond to prescribed cough syrup or antibiotics . Weismuller said classmates of the student as far back as the 1992-93 school_year will be screened for the disease . Those classmates who have transferred to other schools are also being notified of the screening , she said . Weismuller said that all but one of nine other people in the girl ' s household have been screened for tuberculosis , and all but one were found to be infected , although the disease has not as yet affected their lungs . In addition , Weismuller said , the student ' s co-workers have been tested . Results on some of those tests are pending . However , two co-workers in closest contact with the student had positive skin_tests , although their lungs were clear , she said . &quot; Because preliminary results indicate that persons who were close contacts of this student are infected , we are recommending skin testing of classmates of the last two years , &quot; Dr. Hugh Stallworth , county health officer , said in a prepared statement . Ron Anderson , assistant to the superintendent of the Fullerton Joint Union High_School District , said the district has sent letters to parents of 300 students , &quot; strongly recommending &quot; that they take the skin_tests to be given on the La Habra High campus Wednesday . He added that on Friday the district also sent letters in English and Spanish to advise parents of the remaining 1 # 400 La Habra High students that their children do not need to be tested . Weismuller said that although the infected student worked_at a business that serves the public , customers who came briefly in contact with her are not at risk for contracting the disease . &quot; Most cases of tuberculosis are_due to close , prolonged contact , &quot; she said . Weismuller observed that those who may have contracted inactive tuberculosis infections usually can avoid the full-blown disease by taking preventive medication over six to nine months . &quot; People with positive skin_tests have about a 10 % chance of developing active disease in their lifetimes , and most who develop it will do so within the first two years after exposure , &quot; she said . Preventive medication , she said , can reduce by 70 % to 90 % the odds that the disease will become active . After tuberculosis was discovered last year among students at La Quinta High_School in Westminster , all 1 # 034 members of the student body and 189 staff_members were tested for the disease . Seven cases of active TB were diagnosed in current and former students and 189 students tested positive for the bacterium . A major difference at La Habra High_School , Weismuller said , is that so far no additional active tuberculosis cases have been found , which may in part be attributed to the shorter exposure time . The student believed to have spread tuberculosis at La Quinta had the disease for three years before she got proper diagnosis and treatment . Also , the tuberculosis bacteria strain at La Quinta resisted treatment by drugs . It will take two weeks before county health officers will receive results of laboratory tests to determine the kind of tuberculosis that has infected the La Habra High student , Weismuller said . However , she added that in both cases physicians had failed to readily diagnose tuberculosis in their patients . She said when the La Habra student ' s pneumonia failed to respond to antibiotics , the physician should have ordered a sputum test . While tuberculosis was once virtually eradicated in the United States , it has resurfaced in recent years , associated with the rise in homelessness , the outbreak of HIV and the immigration of people from Third_World countries , such_as Mexico and Vietnam , where tuberculosis is much more common . It is necessary for physicians to be more alert to the possibility of tuberculosis , Weismuller said . &quot; We will be working with the Orange County Medical Assn . and with the Vietnamese Medical Assn . and an association of Hispanic doctors to provide them additional information to raise their index of suspicion for tuberculosis , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
