   <TEXT> Re : Endangered tidewater gobies . The Hueneme / Ormond estuary has suffered through years of abuse and neglect and yet its unique habitats continue to sustain an incredible diversity of wildlife . This area contains habitat essential for the survival of many threatened and endangered species , including California least terns , brown pelicans , western snowy plovers , salt marsh bird ' s-beak , and many federal and state candidate species . The various habitats ( salt marshes , lagoons , estuaries , southern coastal foredunes and others ) at Hueneme are already considered to be endangered and are supposed to be protected . A recent discovery of tidewater gobies by UC Santa Barbara biologist Dr. Kevin Lafferty doesn ' t appear to create any new problems , although it means additional work is now clearly needed to make all_the determinations necessary in creating a recovery plan . This discovery may have the positive effect of focusing attention on a number of issues dealing with water quality and quantity . Such attention would be beneficial to all area wildlife and to the ecology . The economic_value of protecting wetlands is_well understood by sport fishermen , commercial fishermen and many farmers as well . According to the National Marine Fisheries Service , three-quarters of the nation ' s $ 4-billion marine fish and shellfish harvest is made_up of estuarine-dependent species ( fish that use vegetation for spawning , rearing and feeding ) . Marine fisheries contribute more_than $ 50 billion to the GNP . Twenty million American recreational fishermen fish for estuarine wetlands-dependent species , adding enormously to our economy . In California alone , more_than 1 1 / 2 million sports fishermen pursue this resource and more_than $ 200 million in seafood is delivered to the docks . Loss of wetlands correlates with decline in annual fish harvests and lost jobs in this industry . Therefore , any focus_on protecting wetlands is good economic news . What ' s good for gobies ends_up being good for all_of us . ALAN SANDERS Port Hueneme Sanders is conservation chairman Sierra Club , Los Padres chapter , Sespe group</TEXT>
