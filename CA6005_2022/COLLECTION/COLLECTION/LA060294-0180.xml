   <HEADLINE> ONCE MORE ONTO THE BEACH ; JOY AND PAIN MINGLE IN SANTA MONICA RE-ENACTMENT OF NORMANDY INVASION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This time around , there was a single landing_craft instead of thousands , and it landed near sunset instead of at dawn ' s light . The weather was balmy , not clammy , and some of the soldiers who waded ashore wore dress shoes and business_suits . It took some imagination , but Wednesday ' s re-enactment at Santa Monica Beach of the D-day landing at Normandy 50 years ago was close enough to the original to stir memories of that deadly day when the Allies began liberating France . Wednesday ' s faux landing before about 1 # 000 onlookers was part of a thank-you celebration sponsored by the_French Consulate in Los Angeles . It was supported by a_few ships , including a restored World_War_II Liberty_Ship , and seven vintage Hellcat fighter_aircraft that flew over in formation . Twenty veterans of the real_thing , some of whom stumbled and needed a helping hand from active-duty soldiers as they waded ashore , were greeted by dozens of French children wearing &quot; Merci L ' Amerique &quot; T-shirts and carrying white carnations . First off the landing_craft was 73-year-old Stanley Kaufman of Long_Beach , who sprinted through the surf with his knees churning high , as if the passage of five decades had not slowed him a bit and he was dodging enemy gunfire . Fifty years ago , he was among the advance force of paratroopers who dropped into the_French town of Ste.-Mer-Eglise behind the beach , with the job of opening_up routes for the Allies to advance . Asked why he was in Santa Monica , redubbed San Monique for the day , Kaufman said only , &quot; Well , it was D-day , you know. &quot; Just as unforeseen obstacles , bad_weather and enemy fire disrupted well-laid plans at Normandy , there were some glitches Wednesday . The veterans had been promised , for example , that they would be able to walk onto the sand just north of the Santa Monica pier . Instead , they waded . &quot; I got a wet butt , &quot; complained retired chief warrant_officer Bob Dorsk of North Hollywood . Dorsk missed D-day but landed later on France ' s south coast as part of a force that would push north toward Germany . He was one of 15 World_War_II veterans who received medals from the governments of France and Normandy during a ceremony after the landing . At the real D-day invasion , about 160 # 000 Allied soldiers landed along a 50-mile stretch of rugged Normandy coastline at dawn on June 6 , 1944 . American forces were concentrated at Utah Beach , where some of the heaviest fighting and casualties occurred . Carrying the American flag for Wednesday ' s ceremony was Bill Slaughter of Santa Maria , who described the D-day landing as &quot; hell on earth. &quot; He was one of only six members of his company of 250 who survived that furious battle . Sam Frackman of Laguna Hills was among the second wave of soldiers to hit Utah Beach . &quot; I ' ve already seen this , I saw the original , &quot; he said of the re-enactment . &quot; It ' s more of a memorial than a celebration. &quot; Tom Martin of Bakersfield was there with his father , a former Navy petty_officer who had the grisly job in the war of collecting the bodies of the dead and shipping them , stacked three high on ship bunks , back to England . Martin said his father is fond of recalling his duty days and telling his war stories . &quot; It was the only significant part he played in the world , &quot; Martin said of his father . &quot; It was ( his ) glory days. &quot; Good feelings between the_French and the Americans were mutual and flowed as freely Wednesday as the wine had as each town was liberated . Chuck Goode of Los Angeles remembers wondering before D-day what he was doing_in that part of the world , about to invade a country he had never seen on behalf of people he did not know . &quot; I discovered the answer when I met the_French , &quot; he said . &quot; A country is its people and the people of France are why we fought . They were our kind of people. &quot; As they will next week in France for the actual anniversary , French and American dignitaries marked the day with speeches . French Consul General Jean-Maurice Ripert , who came_up with the idea for the ceremony of gratitude , said it was important to remember the exploits of the brave . &quot; Our children must know and never forget , &quot; he said . Phillipe de Bourgoing , mayor of the Normandy town of Tracy-sur-Mer , said he will never forget the sight that he saw the morning that the Americans and the Allies finally set foot on French soil . &quot; It ' s the souvenir of my life , &quot; he said of the scene in Normandy that seared its way into his memory . &quot; About 7 in the morning after a hard night of bombing . . . I was able to reach the cliff and have a view of the sea . It was an amazing sight . Ships of all kinds . . . . I remember the thought : ' They have brought everything they have. ' &quot; After the speeches and the ceremonies , the sound of a solitary trumpeter playing &quot; Sonnerie aux Morts , &quot; the_French equivalent of taps , brought the event to a solemn close .
