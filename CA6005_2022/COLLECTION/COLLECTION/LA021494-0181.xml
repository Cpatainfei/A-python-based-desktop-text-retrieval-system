   <HEADLINE> AMERICAN WINS THE DOWNHILL IN OLYMPIC UPSET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tommy Moe of Palmer , Alaska , became only the third American male ever to win an Olympic gold medal in Alpine skiing on Sunday when he defeated , in dramatic fashion , local favorite Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway to win the downhill before an estimated crowd of 40 # 000 at Kvitfjell , Norway . Moe succeeded where Olympic officials had failed , turning attention to the Lillehammer Games and away from the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan situation . &quot; I didn ' t even have any thoughts in my mind that I was going_to win , &quot; said Moe , who won by 0.04 of a second over Aamodt in the closest Alpine race in Olympic history . &quot; I just figured , ' Hey , I ' ll ski the best I can. ' &quot; In other developments : * John Nicks of Costa Mesa ' s Ice Capades might have used a similar technique because his pair , Jenni Meno and Todd Sand , performed the best technical program of their 21-month partnership . All it earned them was sixth place entering Tuesday night ' s freestyle program , which accounts_for two-thirds of the final score , but the competition is more daunting than ever before in the Olympics . &quot; I think we did what we came_to do , which is skate the best we could , &quot; Meno said . &quot; There ' s no reason to be disappointed . Four of the teams ahead of us finished among the top five in the Olympics in 1992 , and we weren ' t even together then. &quot; * First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was late getting_to the slopes and missed Moe ' s medal-winning run , but she and daughter Chelsea were in_attendance later in the day when the U.S. hockey_team rallied from a two-goal third-period deficit to achieve a 4-4 tie against France . * Norwegians at the Viking Hall celebrated a world-record-setting gold medal performance by countryman Johann Olav Koss , who won easily in the 5 # 000-meter speedskating event . Moe silenced a mountain full of clanging cowbells with his victory over Aamodt , the world ' s top skier . Moe won with a time of 1 minute , 45.75 seconds . Aamodt , skiing from the sixth position , had taken the lead from Luxembourg ' s Marc Girardelli , much to the delight of fans who cheered wildly and waved Norwegian flags . But the euphoria was short-lived as Moe , skiing right after Aamodt , stunned the crowd with the finest race of his career . Although he was the world ' s ninth-ranked downhill skier entering the Lillehammer Games , Moe had never before won an international race . After his run , Moe had to wait anxiously to see whether his time would hold_up with some of the best downhill racers yet to ski , among them Austria ' s Patrick Ortlieb , the defending Olympic champion , and Switzerland ' s Franz Heinzer , the reigning World Cup champion . But he really had only two scares . Canada ' s Ed Podivinsky , racing from the 21st position , jumped all_the way to third place to take the bronze medal with his run . And France ' s Nicolas Burtin , a skier Moe feared on the Kvitfjell course , climbed from the 33rd start position all_the way to sixth . Moe earned the gold 10 years after Americans Bill Johnson and Phil Mahre won the downhill and the slalom , respectively , at the 1984 Sarajevo Games .</TEXT>
