   <TEXT> U.S. blue_chip stocks staged a strong rally late Monday , lifting the broad market as investors continued to pick_over the rubble of last week ' s selloff . But the bond market reversed course again , sending yields higher as investors reacted to new signs of economic strength . On Wall_Street , the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 31.29 points to 3 # 739.56 , recouping about a third of last week ' s net 107-point decline . The broad market ' s performance was less impressive , however . Winners edged losers by just 12 to 11 on the New York Stock_Exchange in moderate trading of 265 million shares . Most major indexes rose only marginally : The Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 index added 1.87 points to 454.16 and the Russell 2 # 000 index of smaller stocks gained 0.66 point to 242.69. As on Friday , investors on Monday hunted for select blue_chip bargains in the wake of the heavy stock selloff early last week . Certain industrial , technology and drug stocks led Monday ' s rebound . &quot; There were some bargain hunters ( but ) with no great conviction , &quot; contended Michael Metz , investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co . &quot; Investors are still frightened. &quot; &quot; It ' s a leaderless market , &quot; agreed David Holt , director of technical research at Wedbush Morgan Securities in Los Angeles . &quot; There is no compelling reason to go_out and buy a bunch of stocks. &quot; Indeed , the major factor behind last week ' s plunge -- worries about the effects of higher interest_rates on the economy and on investors ' psyche -- was again a topic on Monday , as bond yields rose for the first time in a week . The yield on the 30-year Treasury_bond jumped to 7.98 % from 7.94 % on Friday , and shorter-term yields rose even more sharply . Traders said the bond market reacted negatively to news that retailers reported strong weekend sales , suggesting brisk consumer spending this holiday season . Also , the National Assn . of Realtors reported that sales of previously owned homes inched up in October , despite higher mortgage rates . Investors fear that if the economy fails to slow appreciably , the Federal_Reserve_Board will raise rates further , dealing another blow to bonds and stocks . Meanwhile , fresh strength in the dollar offered support to U.S. markets on Monday . The dollar reached its highest level against the German mark in nearly three months , helped by renewed interest in high U.S. interest_rates and by Norway ' s apparent rejection of European Union membership . Currency traders interpreted the Norwegian vote as a sign of underlying friction in Europe that could hurt its economy and the mark , the continent ' s dominant currency . &quot; Every time we see less unity in Europe than expected , it ' s going_to help the dollar , &quot; said Hubert Pedroli , manager of foreign_exchange trading at the New York branch of Credit Suisse . In New York late Monday the dollar fetched 1.5668 marks , up from 1.5585 Friday and the highest level since Sept . 1 . But the dollar eased to 98.68 Japanese yen from 98.81 Friday .
