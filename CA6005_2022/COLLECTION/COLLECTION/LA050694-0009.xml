   <HEADLINE> HOME ENTERTAINMENT ; ' MRS . DOUBTFIRE ' VIDEO SELLING LIKE WILDFIRE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> FoxVideo underestimated &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire. &quot; Initially , the company shipped 8 million cassettes of the Robin Williams comedy to video stores , but that wasn ' t nearly enough . &quot; It turns_out that we need 10 million and the total may wind_up at 12 million , &quot; says Bruce Pfander , FoxVideo ' s senior_vice_president of marketing . &quot; This all took us somewhat by surprise. &quot; Now FoxVideo is scrambling to keep_up with the unexpected demand . How did the miscalculation happen ? Part of the problem apparently stemmed from the fact that there were still a lot of people wanting to see it for the first time ; the film was still showing in some theaters when it debuted on video last week . &quot; They went_to the video store instead , &quot; Pfander said . &quot; This situation doesn ' t happen often in the business , so it ' s hard to gauge. &quot; In addition , the relatively inexpensive price helped attract extra hordes of customers . Normally a movie like this would sell for $ 25 and be discounted to $ 16- $ 18 in many places . But &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire &quot; is priced at $ 20 and therefore available in the $ 13- $ 14 range . FoxVideo ' s biggest fear is shortages in the next two weeks -- people showing_up at stores only to find that the tape is out_of_stock . &quot; These next two weekends are crucial , &quot; Pfander said . &quot; In the sales market , you normally get 85 % of your sales in the first four to six weeks . If a store is out_of_stock , some people may_not come back. &quot; Videobits June 29 will be one of the biggest days of the year on home video . Three major movies come_out in time for the July 4 weekend : Columbia TriStar ' s &quot; Philadelphia , &quot; starring Tom Hanks in his Oscar-winning role and Denzel Washington ; Warner ' s &quot; The Pelican Brief , &quot; starring Washington and Julia Roberts , and MCA / Universal ' s &quot; In the Name of the Father , &quot; a nominee for the best picture Oscar . When Disney recently announced that &quot; Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs &quot; will be released Oct . 28 , the big surprise was the price -- $ 27 , about $ 2 higher than most movies geared to the sales market . There will be a rebate , though , through a promotional tie-in , which should help defray the cost . Industry observers knew that &quot; Snow White &quot; would be out before Christmas but everyone was curious about how far away it would be from the Oct . 4 &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; release date . By the time &quot; Snow White &quot; is out , the furor over MCA / Universal ' s &quot; Jurassic &quot; will have died_down somewhat . Special-Interest Videos According to the experts , &quot; Your Baby : A Video Guide to Care and Understanding &quot; is an informative tool for first-time parents , hosted by child development authority Dr. Penelope Leach . From Sidney Place Communications Inc. , $ 30 ; ( 800 ) 877-0597 . . . .

What ' s New On Video : &quot; A Perfect World &quot; ( Warner ) : Many Kevin Costner fans steered clear of this drama because their idol , usually the glamorous hero , plays a loser -- a blue-collar convict on the run . Tracked by a Texas_Ranger ( Clint Eastwood , who also directed ) and a criminologist ( Laura Dern ) , the fugitive bonds with his hostage -- an 8-year-old boy ( T.J. Lowther ) . &quot; The Remains of the Day &quot; ( Columbia TriStar ) : A melancholy tale of the consequences of emotional repression . In 1930s England , a staid butler ( Anthony Hopkins ) stoically stifles his feelings about his naive pro-Nazi employer ( James Fox ) and an appealing housekeeper ( Emma Thompson ) . Garnered a passel of Oscar nominations , including best picture , actor and actress -- all well-deserved . &quot; Ruby in Paradise &quot; ( Republic ) : Searching for a new life , young Ruby ( Ashley Judd ) heads for &quot; paradise &quot; -- a cozy Florida town -- and winds_up as a trinkets saleswoman who gets involved with two very different men . It ' s a modest , decent film with a terrific performance by Judd . &quot; Batman : Mask of the Phantasm &quot; ( Warner ) : Based on the TV cartoon series , this animated feature plays better on the small screen because of its simplistic TV-style animation . It nicely captures the dark , eerie spirit of the Batman myth and features an exciting finale . Adults can enjoy it along with the kids . &quot; Ernest Rides Again &quot; ( Monarch ) : Parents would love to see Ernest ( Jim Varney ) ride_off into the sunset forever but he just won ' t go_away .
