   <HEADLINE> DESTINATION : NEPAL ; CROSSROADS KINGDOM ; HIMALAYA TREKKERS GATHER HERE , BUT THEY ' RE ONLY THE LATEST PILGRIMS TO THIS VALLEY WHERE CULTURES AND RELIGION HAVE MINGLED FOR CENTURIES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This is a tale of three cities in a green valley astride a Himalayan crossroads in the middle of Asia . In ancient times they were known as the kingdoms of Kantipur , Lalitpur and Bhaktapur and were the repository of a deep Hindu and Buddhist culture . Today , they are called Katmandu , the capital_of_Nepal ; Patan , which now abuts the capital to the south across the Bagmati River but maintains its separate identity , and Bhaktapur , seven miles to the east . Throughout the Katmandu Valley in which they sit are scores of Hindu temples and Buddhist stupas , medieval palaces and struggling museums , Tibetan monasteries and craft centers in a complex of riches that could take weeks to explore . The most popular time to be in Nepal begins this month and goes_into November . The weather is clear and dry ; the monsoon rains that sweep_up from India have passed , and the Himalayan peaks can be seen almost every day in their full glory . If the past is any indication , the trekkers are arriving in droves from Germany , Britain , France , Japan and the United States . After a day or so to meet their guides and pack up their climbing gear in Katmandu , they will fan_out to the northeast to trek toward Mt . Everest and Kanchenjunga , and to the west toward Annapurna and Dhaulagiri , the world ' s mightiest mountains . Contrary to conventional wisdom , however , government reports on tourism indicate that most visitors come_to Nepal for non-trekking holidays , many to delve into the nation ' s ancient and diverse culture . Indians from next door are by far the largest single group of tourists , with the vast majority coming_to visit cultural sites -- or , a more recent development , to gamble . The foundation of Nepal ' s culture is religion that exerts a pervasive influence in everyday life . Everywhere are small shrines at which passersby , men going_to work and women with_children in tow , stop to ring a bell , to touch hands or heads to stone , to sprinkle flower petals , to dab a dollop of vermilion on the god depicted there . At first glance , it would seem that the Kingdom of Nepal , the only nation in which Hinduism is the official religion , is tolerant of Buddhism , once a competitive faith . It soon becomes clear , however , that Hindus in Nepal have fused into Hinduism elements of Buddhism that have roots in India and Tibet . Unlike Christians or Muslims , Nepalis see no contradiction in holding beliefs from two religions . One Saturday , an elderly Nepali gentleman stopped to chat as my wife and I came_down the long stairs from Swayambhunath , a Buddhist stupa -- a place_of_worship much like a temple -- just west of Katmandu . During the conversation , I asked : &quot; Do you come here often ? &quot; &quot; Oh , yes , from time to time . I like this place. &quot; &quot; You are Buddhist , then ? &quot; &quot; Oh , no , &quot; he said with a puzzled look , &quot; I am Hindu , pure Hindu. &quot; Later , another Nepali explained that Hindus see Buddha as the ninth incarnation of Vishnu , one of the trinity of Brahma the Creator , Vishnu the Preserver and Shiva the Destroyer . To most Westerners , Nepal seems a remote land , caught in a vise between Tibet and the Himalayan massif along its northern border and a lower range separating it from India to the south . The Katmandu Valley itself may be the Shangri-La of James Hilton ' s famous novel , &quot; Lost Horizon , &quot; although other sites have been named as the inspiration for that storied location . The kaleidoscope of faces on the streets , however , shows the impression of remoteness to be mistaken . Rather , the valley is an ethnic crossroads . We saw people who could be cousins of my ancestors , the Celts , and others who could be cousins of my wife , Fumiko , who is Japanese , plus those whose forebears came from northern or southern India , from Tibet and Mongolia , from Persia and even Greece . * The valley that is home to these people is said in legend to have once been a shallow lake that was drained when the god Manjushri cleaved a gorge with his sword and spilled the water into India . Over the centuries , the valley and surrounding hills drew Indo-Aryans from around the Volga_River in Russia who migrated through Central Asia and across Afghanistan and Kashmir . Mongols , Manchus and Tibetans seeped through the forbidding but porous Himalayan barrier that separates Indian and Sinitic cultures . They were the ancestors of the Gurung and Gurkha hill people ; for more_than a century , the Gurkhas provided the_British army with valiant soldiers . Indians came_to escape the searing heat of the Ganges plain ; Persians wandered in from the west , and Tamils came from the south of India . Greek blood is carried by descendants of Macedonian soldiers commanded by Alexander the Great when he invaded northern India in the 4th Century BC . Recently , Tibetans have come_to escape oppressive Chinese rulers . Let it be said , however , that the Katmandu Valley is not for the squeamish . Poverty prevails and many people live_in dank hovels . Water is in short supply and is polluted ; personal hygiene is only for the upper_class . The air is fouled with black exhaust belching from worn trucks , buses and taxis . Streets are covered with piles of garbage , cow dung and dog-do , and the cities need a scrub and a coat_of_paint . Litter has spread to the mountain trekking areas , even those around Mt . Everest . Fumiko saw a man behead a goat on a side street as she walked to a cultural lecture from our hotel , the Shangri-La , in the embassy district of the city . Visitors are accosted by persistent porters at the airport , by demanding cab drivers who overcharge , by pestering &quot; guides &quot; at cultural sites , and beggars who appear to be as able-bodied as those who work . All of that , combined with political dissent against the government in Nepal ' s new-found democracy , strikes by transport workers demanding higher wages , floods_in Nepal and recessions in the industrial world , explains why Nepal has lost some of its magnetism . The number of tourists last year dropped_by 17 % below that of 1992 . A senior official at the Ministry of Tourism and Civil Aviation , Laxman Upadhaya , acknowledged the problem but said &quot; we don ' t have much money to spend on tourism . Tourism is not on the government ' s priority list. &quot; Before we left in mid-June , however , the government cut the visa fee to $ 15 from $ 40 . Even so , for the adventurous , for incorrigible romantics , and for those with a taste for history , the Katmandu Valley is a trove . We are both culture buffs , confirmed temple-goers and amateur historians , and we discovered that a good place to get a feel_for early history is the temple dedicated to Vishnu called Changu Narayan . Believed to have been founded in the 4th Century AD , it sits on a hill seven miles east of Katmandu , just outside Bhaktapur , and offers a breathtaking view of the valley . Maybe Hilton had this in mind when he had the adventuresome but other-worldly English diplomat Hugh Conway and his companions first see Shangri-La . We hired a car and driver to go_to Changu Narayan on a Sunday , a working_day , to find it nearly deserted and thus serene . The main hall is built like a pagoda that , to this amateur eye , showed strong Buddhist influences . Wood carvings on pillars and over doors , however , depicted Hindu guardians as did stone sculptures scattered about the courtyard . In contrast to Changu Narayan ' s tranquillity , Pashupatinath , on the eastern edge of Katmandu and the most sacred Hindu temple in Nepal , was clamorous at mid-week . Non-Hindus are not permitted to enter the temple , perhaps because priests fear that non-believers may ridicule the object of worship , Shiva ' s lingam ( phallus ) , carved with the god ' s four faces . From a hillside across the narrow , polluted but sacred Bagmati river is a clear view of the sprawling compound . The sound of chanting and the scent of incense wafted from the temple while pilgrims splashed water on themselves at riverside . Along the riverbank are ghats , concrete platforms or steps_on which the dead may be cremated . * In Patan , the temple dedicated to the god of compassion known to Hindus as Machhendranath and to Buddhists as Avalokiteshwara is another pagoda in a quiet compound just steps from a frenetic street . In the spring , the countenance of the god , a red figure painted on a shingle , is slowly taken through the city ' s streets in a swaying , 60-foot tower of poles , flowers , and rope atop a heavy cart . Passersby bless themselves by touching any part of the tower and then their foreheads . Perhaps the most imposing sites are the Buddhist stupas at Swayambhunath just west of Katmandu and Bodhnath to the east . They are huge , round , whitewashed mounds , the domes of which are crowned with tall , square golden spires , on each side of which are painted brooding blue eyes that stare off into the distance as they watch for evil . At Swayambhunath , monkeys clambering up the long stairway and around the shrines paid little attention to people , and vice versa . Swayambhunath was more elaborate in shrines and statues than Bodhnath , which is particularly sacred to Tibetan lamas , but the latter seemed more imposing in its simplicity . The stupa , which is surrounded by a circular road lined with bookshops , souvenir shops , and a Tibetan temple , was founded in the 5th Century . By the stairs leading to the stupa is a huge prayer_wheel ; anyone can give it a spin to pray for the well-being of the world . We walked through the narrow lanes running north from the stupa to a score of Tibetan monasteries constructed by refugees . In the Nenang Pao monastery , we met a 19-year-old novice who had fled from Tibet at the age of 13 , walking for a month through the mountain_passes to reach Katmandu . A student of English , he explained about the bodhisattvas , that they are beings on the way toward enlightenment but who have not quite reached it . They attend the_Buddha , who was born Siddhartha Gautama in Lumbini , a Nepali town near the Indian border . In each of the three cities of the Katmandu Valley is a durbar , or palace , from which kings ruled tiny fiefs until the Gurkhas swept out of the_hills to unify the country in the 18th Century . The squares in front of the durbars are both historical sites and hubs of present-day life . Durbar Square in Katmandu was clogged with unkempt temples and alive_with street vendors hawking food to Nepalis and trinkets to tourists . Perhaps the most colorful was the Black Bhairab , a stone god carved on an upright slab and dancing on a corpse . We watched a woman stretch up_to smear vermilion on the chest of the god ; legend has it that anyone who tells a lie before this god will vomit blood until he dies . * In contrast , the smaller Durbar Square in Bhaktapur was_well kept and clearly a gathering place for men to gossip during the noon hour . The palace has been turned_into a museum in which a guide explained through the art_collection the complexities of the Hindu trinity . Shiva appears to get most attention , perhaps because he destroys evil , and Vishnu as guardian warrants much consideration . Brahma the Creator , however , is barely seen -- but no Nepali with whom we spoke could explain why . The Durbar Square in Patan is rather more neatly laid_out and less confusing than the jumbled square in Katmandu . The former king ' s palace is being converted to a museum ; splendid wood carvings stand_in its courtyard awaiting places inside . The museums in Bhaktapur and Patan seemed more inviting than the National Museum near Swayambhunath . The National Museum has lovely bas-relief carvings in stone that show the variety of Hindu gods , and bronze sculptures that display more imaginative ways to achieve sexual_intercourse than can be described in a family newspaper . It was not well-lit , however , nor did_it have adequate explanations for English-reading visitors . Opposite the palace in Patan is an elaborately carved temple dedicated to both Vishnu and Shiva before which the figure of a king kneels in prayer atop a tall pillar . Next door is another elaborately carved stone temple dedicated to Vishnu in his incarnation as Krishna . Across from those temples is a hiti or bath that was built_in the 6th Century . It is still in_use , underscoring the poverty of Nepal ; the polluted liquid that trickles from its pipes is the only water available to those who come_to bathe and carry water home . In contrast is the luxurious , modern palace of the present ruler , King Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev . Situated near the center of Katmandu , the palace grounds_cover 15 acres and the main building , built_in 1970 , has three wings of 30 rooms each . Visitors are permitted in the Narayanhity Palace in the state wing but not the guest wing nor the private wing . The fee for foreigners , who may visit on Thursdays only , is 250 rupees , or $ 5 . Another insight into the life of the valley comes from the carpet makers , who also offer good bargains . The craft was brought_to Nepal by Tibetans after 1959 and is practiced by Tibetan women in Jaulakhel , a Tibetan neighborhood on the southeastern edge of Patan . There we saw four women weaving a room-sized carpet that would take several months to finish . Nepali women weave carpets at the Patan Industrial Estate , in the southern sector of the city , where furniture , brassware and woolen sweaters are also made . ( We bought a carpet there for about $ 170. ) The point is that people in Nepal work hard for long hours with little return . Life in the valley , and the_hills beyond , is really on the edge . Yet through it all , we found Nepalis not to have been hardened by poverty but to have a grace and charm , perhaps infused by the deep religious culture around them . I spoke with a Western diplomat about the grim side in Nepal . &quot; Yes , &quot; he agreed , &quot; but it ' s hard not to root for these guys , isn ' t it ? &quot; GUIDEBOOK : Katmandu Connections Getting there : Katmandu is around the other side of the world so plan on at least two and better three days to get there .
