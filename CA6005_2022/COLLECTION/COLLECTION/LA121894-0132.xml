   <HEADLINE> RAW , SALTED AND ROASTED ; WHAT ' S ON THE TABLE WHEN NORA EPHRON AND STEVE MARTIN GET TOGETHER ? FAJITAS , VEGETARIANS , THANKSGIVING DINNER AND ' MIXED NUTS. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They look as if they have just dashed in from a faculty reception : she in her nice wool suit and pearls , he in a sport coat and tie . They are busy and smart , pressed for time , of course -- Steve Martin and Nora Ephron would hardly be otherwise -- but they are also hungry and they fill the room with a restless , heat-seeking energy . They are here to promote their movie , &quot; Mixed Nuts , &quot; which opens Wednesday and is based on a relatively unknown French comedy , &quot; Le Pere Noel est une Ordure &quot; ( Santa Claus Is Garbage ) . He is the star ; she is the director and co-writer ( with her sister , Delia Ephron ) . But they are each famous in their own_right . He was a philosophy student at Cal State Long_Beach who pioneered a brand of droll , cerebral stand-up comedy and became one of the most popular and gifted comedic stars . He is also a writer , of such successful movies as &quot; Roxanne &quot; and &quot; L.A. Story , &quot; as well as this year ' s bomb &quot; A Simple Twist of Fate. &quot; Now he has sworn_off screenwriting in favor of writing for the theater . His first play , &quot; Picasso at the Lapine Agile , &quot; a comic meditation on the nature of genius and celebrity , has been produced in Chicago and now Los Angeles , at the Westwood Playhouse through March 26 , to encouraging reviews . She , however , was born into a family of screenwriters . After working as a successful New York journalist for several years , she wrote &quot; Silkwood , &quot; &quot; Heartburn &quot; ( which was based on_her_own best-selling roman_a_clef ) and &quot; When Harry Met Sally . . . &quot; She directed her first film , &quot; This Is Your Life , &quot; in 1992 . Her second film , last summer ' s sleeper hit &quot; Sleepless in Seattle , &quot; made more_than $ 100 million . Each of them now leads a comfortable , even privileged , life : he with his famous art_collection , she with her vast Upper West_Side apartment in New York and a summer_house in the Hamptons . He is newly divorced ; she is happily on marriage No . 4 . They are , in fact , frank enthusiasts for the haute bourgeois life who know exactly what they want , which , at this moment , means getting their assistants to supply something more_than the avocado-and-bean-sprout sandwiches awaiting them . * Nora Ephron : We heard a rumor about fajitas . Steve Martin : Yeah , we heard she was sleeping_with . . . . No , is there meat in fajitas ? we ' ll take anything in the fajita world , but I ' m high on the vegetarian part of it . Ephron : We were hoping when Steve ' s marriage ( to British actress Victoria Tennant ) broke_up he would go_back to meat -- I felt it was time for him to break_out of that -- but he didn ' t . I still think you ' re missing a lot . Martin : Like a heart_attack . * Question : Speaking of breaking_out , Nora , were you somewhat intimidated to try another comedy after the huge success of &quot; Sleepless in Seattle &quot; ? Ephron : I didn ' t want to make &quot; Sleepless &quot; again and this is completely different . It has very low ambitions , as in low_comedy . I just wanted people to laugh . Martin : Mike Nichols once told me that I always aimed high in something low . I loved that . Ephron : We also hoped , by the way , that this would be_on television forever at Christmastime . * Q : The movie is a loose adaptation of the_French film , but did you always have Steve in mind to play the head of the suicide hot_line ? Ephron : No , because that way lies heartbreak . Martin : All right , I ' m leaving . Ephron : But we did put him at the top of our little list . . . Martin : The only other person they considered for my role was Winona Ryder . Ephron : . . . because there is just enough physical comedy in this that there weren ' t that many actors who could do_it and also Steve can act in a way that isn ' t quite real . * Q : Why did you want that quality -- because this was intended to be more farcical than &quot; Sleepless , &quot; almost a screwball comedy ? Ephron : No , because it was just . . . Why did I want what ? * Q : Steve ' s talent for making unreal behavior seem plausible . Ephron : Because the situation of the movie is just that it couldn ' t quite happen . People behave in this about 10 % crazier than in real_life . Like that startled-deer thing that Steve does_in this , the constant shock ( he registers ) when the phone rings in a suicide hot_line center . That kills me . And then , of course , the dance sequence where Steve is leaping over tables and he ' s completely believable but it has no basis in reality . Martin : And that ' s what I do best actually . I ' m sitting here thinking_about myself and that ' s really it : Although I can play regular guys , I can also turn_up the flame a bit , so behavior that would look crazy in real_life you actually can get_away with in a movie . * Q : Is that why the movie , which is ostensibly a Christmas story , is set_in Los Angeles , to heighten the farcical aspect ? Ephron : Somehow Christmas in Los Angeles immediately sets the movie off kilter . There is something about L.A. , you just understand why certain people come here . . . Martin : And don ' t you think . . . Ephron : . . . from all spectrums of the rainbow . . . Martin : . . . don ' t you think that if you set it in New York that our mixed nuts would have been more dangerous ? Ephron : Oh , yes . Martin : This is lighter , happier , because people can exist that way in L.A. and not be serial_killers . * Q : What is it about Christmas that is so fascinating that you put it in all your movies ? Do you actually celebrate the holiday ? Ephron : Of course I do ! What kind of a question is that ? * Q : Well , many people don ' t observe the birth of Christ . . . Ephron : Well , I know that , but I ' ve always had a big Christmas thing . It is so totally interesting , so endlessly interesting to me . It is such a complicated holiday . Unlike Thanksgiving where you could eat_in a Chinese restaurant and say , &quot; Isn ' t this great ? , &quot; Christmas seems to contain every_other Christmas in it . So when you say , &quot; This was the best Christmas , &quot; you ' re really saying it is so_much better than the year the marriage broke_up , or the year when Mother died . It is so full of tears under all_the celebrating . Martin : Like that line in the movie where Rita ( Wilson ) says , &quot; I just wish I had someone to care_for and who would care_for me. &quot; That is such a touching moment , gosh . * Q : So you have a weakness for the holidays , too , Steve ? Martin : Well , I really like Christmas now , but when I was doing stand-up and traveling for something like 10 years , Christmas was always spent in a hotel_room and you didn ' t participate in it because you would just get too sad . But now I ' ve started to understand that it can actually be fun to have people around , fun to buy somebody a present and to get one . * Q : So , both of you -- despite formidable reputations to the contrary -- are closet sentimentalists . Ephron : Everyone is . I once wrote that there is no one so romantic as a cynic . Martin : It ' s also what the medium of film is really good at . Ephron : Well , it has to be an earned emotion . Martin : Yes , the worst thing you can feel in a movie is manipulated and the best thing is to catch the audience by surprise . And it can be the smallest thing . One time I was driving down the street and a fire_engine went_by and all_the cars pulled over . It warmed my heart . Ephron : Why ? Because civilization was working in some way ? Martin : No , because they were doing_it for someone else . * Q : Does gender come_into play in any of this ? Do women write -- or direct -- films differently than men ? Martin : There is a female point_of_view in this movie , yes , but there is nothing in my character that could not have been written by a man . Ephron : I think that definitely happens when women make movies , they get_to say different things . One of the things about this movie that I loved was that line about the woman who said she spent the holidays standing in the &quot; 10 items or less &quot; line at the checkout register which never happened to me , but which feels completely autobiographical . * Q : I thought the most autobiographical line in the movie was , &quot; Things do not come_to those who wait &quot; . . . Ephron : Well , yes . Yes . * Q : . . . because like many women directors , you ' ve had to fight your way into the profession . What is it you want to say in film that you couldn ' t say as a journalist or a screenwriter ? Ephron : I hope to make eight or nine movies before I ' m done and so we ' ll find_out one day . But so far I think ( Delia and I ) have managed to get our voice in there some way so they don ' t feel generic . I also have a very clear goal , which is probably foolish to even say , but I love having a group of people that I get_to work with , so you have this little company and every 18 months or so you all spend three months together and eat_in restaurants in cities where you don ' t live . But mostly I want to make funny movies . * Q : Is Nora funny ? Ephron : Delia is actually funnier . . . Martin : Yes , definitely . She ' s not doing shtick but . . . Ephron : All you can say is , &quot; Does this make me laugh ? &quot; Martin : . . . she has an instinct for framing the scene -- which is something I have . She knows the value of a joke in a scene : Is it a big or small joke , is it in the foreground or background , is it a big scene or a transitional scene ? * Q : What about your nascent career as a playwright ? Martin : I think movies can be great , but movies are also like a circus , even the making of them is such an effort -- three months to shoot it and all_the prep and post-production . Even a bad movie is hard to make and believe me , I know . * Q : So playwriting is more of a purely mental exercise ? Martin : When I sit_down to do a screenplay , I already know too_much . I ' m mentally editing it , this scene is too long , too something . But in a play you can just stop for like 10 minutes and have some dialogue about an inner_tube or something that doesn ' t mean anything , but if it ' s interesting you can just talk_about it . * Q : What about screenwriting ? You ' ve said you won ' t write another movie , only plays . Are you frustrated by Hollywood ? Martin : I know I said that and I probably meant it . . . but I do think one of the biggest mistakes Hollywood makes in looking_at a script is that inevitable question : &quot; Will people like this character ? &quot; But they equate likability with someone never doing anything unlikable , it becomes Mr. Bland , almost like a hostile guy when it ' s really the foibles that make him good and human . I like it when a character is selfish or has a flaw that makes him more real than if he is Mr. Nice Guy . Even in something like &quot; Father of the Bride , &quot; the sequel to which I happen to be doing now so it ' s on my mind , he comes_off as Mr. Perfect , but he ' s actually self-centered and selfish . * Q : Were you disappointed about the reaction to &quot; A Simple Twist of Fate , &quot; your updating of &quot; Silas Marner , &quot; which is about a very imperfect man ? Martin : I think I made a lot of mistakes in the writing and I was also a little bit distracted ( by my personal life ) , but the reviews were so consistently bad I thought they must be right . I kept reading the phrase , &quot; Not quite an embarrassment. &quot; Like , OK , I ' ll put that one on the shelf . * Q : Do you two collaborate as writers , or as director and actor ? Ephron : In the context of this movie or life itself ? Martin : We talk_about the script ( of &quot; Mixed Nuts &quot; ) , but I talk to her as an actor , because when you ' re acting in a movie it ' s very liberating to just come_in and act and maybe think_of a joke occasionally . Ephron : And I ' ve read some of Steve ' s scripts and sometimes I ' ll say , &quot; Make this a bit more something. &quot; I ' ve done a certain amount of that . Martin : that ' s what people do for each other in a certain community . If you ' re writing a script or a play and Nora Ephron and Mike Nichols are your friends , you ask them to read it . * Q : As creators of comic films , do you feel there is a bias against comedy in Hollywood ? Martin : I saw a review of &quot; The Mask &quot; and it had this line , &quot; In this movie , Jim Carrey proves he can act. &quot; Now that is a very subtle example of how comedy is not considered acting . I mean , what did he do_in &quot; Ace Ventura &quot; ? Ephron : What you ' re talking_about is partly critics but mostly awards and it will always be No . 700 on the list of the world ' s problems . . . Martin : Because we get such rewards for being funny . We get paid so well and because people love it when you make them laugh . Ephron : But all movies are hard to make . I read this interview with Jan de Bont ( director of &quot; Speed &quot; ) who said , &quot; It ' s harder to make ' Speed ' than ' Sleepless in Seattle. ' &quot; Martin : Uh-oh . Ephron : Well , I didn ' t think that was entirely random and I thought , &quot; Why are you knocking my movie ? I can ' t make ' Speed ' and guess what ? You can ' t make ' Sleepless. ' &quot; Martin : Well , maybe he meant , &quot; Which is harder : shooting a bunch of fun , happy actors or a bus ? &quot; Where would you rather go_to work every day ? Ephron : I know , and I think I ' d rather slit my throat than shoot a person ' s hand on a gearshift . That is when I will happily go_back to journalism , so I understand what he meant -- but that ' s not all he meant .</TEXT>
