   <HEADLINE> CULTURE ; CHINESE ROCKERS ON A ROLL ; NO LONGER A BACK-ROOM PHENOMENON , THE YOUTH MUSIC HAS GONE COMMERCIAL -- UNDER THE WATCHFUL EYE OF THE AUTHORITIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; The world we live_in , is just like a garbage_dump People here are like worms , fighting and grabbing All they eat is conscience , all they waste is thought. &quot; -- Chinese rocker He Yong from his new album * What was occurring at the Children ' s Drama Theater on a recent afternoon looked suspiciously like a rock_concert . Wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with various English formulations using the &quot; F &quot; word , Chinese &quot; New Rock &quot; performer He Yong was_on stage executing twisting vertical leaps and violently slapping his guitar strings as he sang &quot; There is no hope ! There is no hope ! There is no hope ! There is no hope ! &quot; -- the deafening refrain_from his new song , &quot; Garbage Dump. &quot; Officially , however , what was taking_place on the small stage in central Beijing , was a &quot; press_conference &quot; sponsored by a Taiwanese record company , China Fire Productions , that has contracts with He Yong and two other young rockers who performed that afternoon . The performance / press_conference was approved by Beijing municipal officials only after Taiwanese rock promoter Landy Chang , who has a total of seven mainland Chinese rock musicians under contract , pledged that there would be no politically subversive lyrics . One of Chang ' s best-known groups , the heavy-metal Tang Dynasty , sold 2 million albums last year , including significant sales in Hong Kong , Taiwan and Japan . Their success won them another first for mainland_China -- sponsorship by a major instrument company , Tokyo-based Gibson Asia Inc. In the last two years , China has been swarmed by Taiwanese , Hong Kong and Japanese talent_agents eager to get young artists under contract . No longer a back-room phenomenon , Chinese rock ' n ' roll has entered what performers and promoters say is a new phase of commercialization , with artists scrambling for foreign contracts while trying to compete against Hong Kong bubble-gum music and karaoke bars for the public ' s attention . The carefully staged event in the Children ' s Drama Theater represents a recent push by the Beijing government to cash_in_on the rock_music market while , at_the_same_time , also trying to keep it under political control . &quot; My artists don ' t push political themes , &quot; Chang , 32 , said during an interview in a hotel coffee_shop . &quot; They love their country . They want to create , not destroy. &quot; Such talk is sweet music to the Chinese Communist leadership , long suspicious of rock_music as a moral and political pollutant . Just to make_sure things didn ' t get_out of hand , several officials sat in the back row of the theater watching nervously during the midafternoon performance . Even holding the concert at 3 p.m. , not exactly prime_time for the nocturnal rock crowd , was another way of controlling the event . Afterward , when the officials joined promoters for drinks and food , Chang said they confided their satisfaction that the performers had restricted themselves to themes of alienation , disgust , anomie , frustration , nausea , hopelessness and despair instead of diving into corruption and politics under the Communist regime . Normal teen-age depression , it seems , is OK . What the government definitely does not want is the emergence of another Cui Jian , the charismatic rock_star whose song &quot; Rock ' n ' Roll on the New Long March &quot; became the anthem of the student generation that led the 1989 demonstrations in Tian An Men Square . Since 1989 , the government has only permitted Cui Jian to perform on special occasions , such_as charity concerts . Several of his scheduled performances have been canceled without notice . In May , when the new Singapore-managed Hard Rock Cafe opened in Beijing , Cui Jian was denied entrance to the inaugural concert featuring American blues master B . B . King . After waiting for an hour outside the club , which features a mock Sistine Chapel ceiling with Elvis as God , Cui stomped off in disgust . &quot; This is not a real Hard Rock Cafe , &quot; the rejected rocker pronounced to reporters , &quot; I think they are kissing the government ' s butt. &quot; Hard Rock Cafe manager Nicholas Ong denied excluding Cui for political reasons . &quot; He was simply not invited and did not have an invitation card , &quot; said Ong , who avoids government interference by booking only foreign groups in his 400-seat club , where he says 80 % of his clientele are foreign residents and tourists . But that does not mean that Ong is always able to steer completely clear of controversy . Old Maoist suspicions of foreign devils twanging electric_guitars still persist . In late July , the Beijing Hard Rock Cafe was attacked in an editorial by the official China Youth News for the &quot; barbaric &quot; practice of stamping an inked symbol on customers ' hands when they enter the club . &quot; The marks stamped on the body are a form of barbarism and humiliation , &quot; the editorial railed . It described the club bouncers as &quot; border security police &quot; and described the club as &quot; a hard rock under the wheels of civilization. &quot; In the mind of Wang Yong , a talented musician who played the traditional Chinese stringed instrument known_as guzheng in Cui Jian ' s band , rock ' n ' roll in China is already in a period of creative decline after it first emerged in Beijing in the early 1980s . For the past year , Wang has concentrated_on creating computer-generated music . &quot; The market for rock ' n ' roll is in depression since last year , &quot; Wang said in an interview . &quot; This is not only the government ' s fault . Most of the young people today like superstars from Hong Kong and Taiwan , or Western ' easy listening ' or disco music . &quot; Our bands are always pretending they ' re frustrated , shouting as loud as they can , like He Yong . But maybe there are not so many frustrated young people now. &quot; For his part , rocker He Yong , sipping hot tea in a trendy new underground coffeehouse after his afternoon performance , was simply happy to be back on stage under any conditions . &quot; For the first_half of this year , &quot; he said , &quot; they didn ' t let us perform at all . We were always being harassed and closed_down . Sometimes they let us do shows in Inner Mongolia and other places far away , but not in Beijing. &quot; The sudden government permission for the afternoon &quot; press_conference &quot; performance , the 25-year-old rocker said coolly , was not an artistic , cultural endorsement . &quot; Look , rock ' n ' roll is a business . The government supports business. &quot;</TEXT>
