   <HEADLINE> FISH HARVESTS IN PUGET SOUND AT LOWEST LEVEL IN 55 YEARS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Salmon are not the only troubled fish in the Pacific Northwest . An analysis prepared last month for a joint U.S.-Canadian scientific panel on the health of fish stocks declared bluntly that &quot; fish resources in Puget Sound have seriously declined , and harvests are at their lowest level in over 55 years. &quot; Where once commercial and sport fishermen annually hauled over 26 million pounds of fish out of these waters , the 1993 catch was a paltry 3.6 million pounds . Pacific_cod , hake and pollock populations have been especially hard hit , according to Cyreis Schmitt , a biologist for the state of Washington and a co-author of the report . &quot; Essentially the fisheries have pretty much ceased for these three stocks , &quot; she said . Six of the eight most important non-salmon species in Puget Sound now rate as &quot; low &quot; or &quot; very low &quot; in abundance , but the authors said they could only guess at the cause . Most of these depressed species have been off limits to fishing for years , yet returns to historic population levels are overdue . The report blames everything from unusually warm water in the sound to an increase in predators to the disappearance of marshland . Unlike the salmon , some of these fish live for decades . That means a longer wait before scientists can accurately assess the stock ' s status or recommend what to do . &quot; So many questions remain about how to do_it right , &quot; Schmitt said . &quot; It takes more knowledge than we now have . The problems may or may_not be man-made , but we need to adjust to them . We need to be aware and account_for them. &quot;</TEXT>
