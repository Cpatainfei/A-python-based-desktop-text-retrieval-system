   <HEADLINE> THE GATT VOTE : IMPACT ON BUSINESS ; WORLD TRADE BLOCS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The new_World Trade Organization is the international governing authority for the myriad trade rules negotiated by more_than 100 nations in Geneva last year . As envisioned by the treaty , global tariffs would be slashed an average of 40 % , government subsidies would be reduced and many trade_barriers affecting food and other products would vanish . Yet there will remain an alphabet soup of regional trade alliances . Export mania is spreading , and many nations have lost enthusiasm for old-fashioned trade restrictions . Part of the significance of the global trade deal is that many tariffs paid by non-members of regional pacts will be lower than before . In addition , the World Trade Organization plans to negotiate further tariff reductions in the future , aiding trade partners who are not members of the same regional alliance . The membership of trade alliances is changing fast , though , and old boundaries are blurring . Here is a glance at some of the agreements and alliances , large and small : 1 . Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) : APEC was established 1989 to promote trade and investment in the Pacific Basin , in response to a more exclusive East Asian zone advocated by Malaysia . APEC ' s 16 members , who represent 40 % of global trade , include Japan , China , South_Korea , Hong Kong , the United States and Canada . APEC members set_free trade by 2020 as a goal . 2 . European Union ( EU ) : This expanding market is the offspring of the European Economic Community , launched in 1957 as Western Europe struggled to recover from World_War_II . Despite Norway ' s recent vote not to join , the EU is a highly effective example of regional economic cooperation , and its influence is expanding . Longtime members include Germany , France and Italy , and the addition of Austria , Finland and Sweden next year will bring the EU roster to 15 . 3 . North_American Free_Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) : The 1993 deal has bound Mexico , the United States and Canada in an increasingly &quot; North_American &quot; market , in which trade_barriers and tariffs are gradually vanishing . NAFTA , not quite 1-year old , has received generally positive reviews as trade has expanded solidly among the three neighbors . Fears that it would prompt an exodus of U.S. jobs into the cheaper labor_market of Mexico have proven unfounded . Several smaller alliances include : 4 . Andean Group : Launched in 1969 to increase economic ties within South_America . Its success has been limited by members ' reluctance to abandon individual trade_policies in favor of collective_agreements . Members are Bolivia , Colombia , Peru , Ecuador and Venezuela . 5 . Assn . of Southeast Asian_Nations ( ASEAN ) : Fromed in 1967 to promote economic and cultural cooperation in Southeast_Asia . Members , which grant each other preferential duties on many products , are Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines , Thailand , Singapore and Brunei . 6 . Australia-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations pact ( CER ) : The 1983 deal aimed for a manufactured-goods free-trade zone encompassing the two nations . Subsequent agreements covered most services , along with efforts to harmonize product standards , customs procedures and business laws . 7 . Caribbean Community and Common_Market ( CARICOM ) : Established in 1973 to promote economic integration among less-developed nations in the region . Members include Antigua , the Bahamas , Barbados , Belize , Dominica , Grenada , Guyana , Jamaica , Montserrat , St . Kitts-Nevis , St . Lucia , St . Vincent and the Grenadines , Trinidad_and_Tobago . 8 . Central_American Common_Market : Under this 1960 pact , Costa Rica , El_Salvador , Guatemala , Honduras and Nicaragua are working toward a common_market . But progress has been hindered by protectionism and ideological differences among the countries . 9 . Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) : This 10-nation pact emerged from a 1979 organization dedicated to cooperating on regional development plans and to reducing the nations ' economic dependence on South_Africa . But progress has been hindered by the members ' weak economies . In August , South_Africa joined the group , which is widely considered the key economic and political alliance in the region . Other members are Angola , Botswana , Lesotho , Malawi , Mozambique , Namibia , Swaziland , Tanzania , Zambia and Zimbabwe . 10 . Southern Common_Market ( Mercosur ) : Established in 1991 to create a common_market among Argentina , Brazil , Paraguay and Uruguay , Mercosur is off to a strong start . Tariff reductions are stimulating business , and trade among members has more_than doubled since 1990 . 11 . RUSSIA : Economic relations between Russia and other nations of the former Soviet_Union have been chaotic after the unraveling of Comecon , their former economic alliance . But the western world beckons : Earlier this year , Russia signed an agreement with the European Union lifting most barriers to Russian exports . Russia and Western Europe also agreed to start official talks in 1998 to establish a Europe-Russia free_trade zone . 1 . APEC 2 . EU 3 . NAFTA 4 . Andean Group 5 . ASEAN 6 . CER 7 . Caricom 8 .
