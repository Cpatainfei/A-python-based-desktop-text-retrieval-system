   <TEXT> UC Irvine has decided to start its fall film series Sept . 30 with &quot; Angel Heart , &quot; the weird Alan Parker flick starring Mickey Rourke , Robert De Niro and Lisa Bonet of TV ' s &quot; Cosby &quot; fame . The 1987 thriller about a low-rent private_eye ( Rourke ) and a murder investigation that leads him into voodoo was supposed to be Bonet ' s step into the big_leagues of Hollywood . Instead , the television_star showed_off much of her body and not much acting talent and has rarely been heard from since . Fortunately , &quot; Cinema Paradiso , &quot; scheduled next on Oct . 7 , takes_up any slack left by &quot; Angel Heart. &quot; Director Giuseppe Tornatore ' s splendid picture centers_on the old movie_theater in an Italian village and the lives of those who revere the films shown there . The sentimental 1988 release won both the best foreign film Oscar and the top award at the Cannes Film Festival . &quot; The Last Temptation of Christ &quot; screens Oct . 14 . Martin Scorsese ' s 1988 retelling of the life of Christ proved one of the more controversial films in recent years . His depiction of Christ in a more humanistic , less miraculous way angered some religious groups . The film_stars Willem Dafoe as Christ . On Oct . 21 , &quot; Love in the City &quot; will be presented . The film features five separate tales by respected Italian directors , including Federico Fellini , Michelangelo Antonioni and Cesare Zavattini . Fellini ' s &quot; Love Cheerfully Arranged , &quot; depicting the strange world of matrimonial agencies , is a highlight , as is Antonioni ' s &quot; Love Fails , &quot; which reconstructs three suicide attempts . &quot; Entre Nous &quot; is set for Oct . 28 . Diane Kurys ' movie follows the lives of two women in France during the ' 50s as they come_to terms with their feelings of love and sexuality . The 1983 release is partially based on the life of Kurys ' mother . Alfred Hitchcock ' s &quot; Rebecca &quot; will screen Nov . 4 . The winner of the 1940 Oscar for best film , it stars Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier in a melodrama about a young bride trying to replace her husband ' s widow , the enigmatic Rebecca . This was Hitchcock ' s first American film . UCI continues its fascination with Pedro Almodovar on Nov . 11 with his 1991 release , &quot; High Heels. &quot; Described as &quot; a racy comedy drama about a mother and daughter who share more_than family ties , &quot; the picture stars one of Almodovar ' s favorite actresses , Victoria Abril , as a young_woman who becomes closer to her mom after their mutual lover is killed . On Nov . 18 , 1980 ' s &quot; Loulou &quot; ( not to be confused with the much earlier Josephine Baker vehicle ) is offered . The French movie by Maurice Pialat focuses_on an upper-class woman who begins an unpredictable relationship with a less-refined stud played by Gerard Depardieu . The series closes Dec . 2 with an Ingmar Bergman classic , &quot; The Seventh Seal. &quot; The 1957 film presents the fantastic odyssey of a knight returning from the Crusades as he struggles with the meaning of life while playing a very long game of chess with Death . * What : The UC Irvine fall film series . * When : Beginning Sept . 30 ( with Alan Parker ' s &quot; Angel Heart ) at 7 and 9 p.m. and continuing every Friday through Dec . 2 . * Where : The UCI Student_Center Crystal Cove Auditorium , except for &quot; Rebecca , &quot; which will screen in the Student_Center ' s Emerald Bay room . * Whereabouts : Take the San Diego ( 405 ) Freeway to Jamboree Road and head south to Campus Drive and take a left .
