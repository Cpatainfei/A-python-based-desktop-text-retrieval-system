   <HEADLINE> THE NATION ; THE CHILDREN ' S CAMPAIGN : WHEN EMOTIONALISM MASKS HARD CHOICES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In campaign after campaign this year , the only thing trendier than trashing Washington was the Save the Children Fund ' s trademark necktie . Dave McCurdy , the moderate Democratic Senate candidate in Oklahoma , sports one . So does Michael DeWine , the conservative Republican running in Ohio . Bill_Clinton says it ' s one of his favorites . Once worn only by the terminally PC , the tie -- with its multicolored swarm of smiling kids -- has spread like some sartorial virus , sprouting from the collars of candidates of every ideological stripe . Empty symbols are , no doubt , as common in political races as bad food and baseless accusations . And candidates have always labored mightily to display fondness for their children -- and their spouses and their pets -- as a sign of their decency . In Washington state , the political neophyte trying to unseat House Speaker Thomas S . Foley goes so far as_to count the fact that Foley is not a father as one reason he should be ousted . But this fall , politicians across the country have taken the infantilization of politics a step farther . Candidates are now trying to turn every topic under the sun -- from crime to welfare to the economy -- into a &quot; children ' s issue. &quot; This tactic serves different ends for each party . Yet , they are up_to the same thing : softening the edges of a campaign that has been unrelentingly harsh . With a sullen electorate harboring serious misgivings about Democrats and Republicans alike , the parties are using emotionalism about children to ease voters ' minds -- and to obscure both the issues and what they really believe_in . Injecting kids into any political debate comes naturally to Democrats , who have always been more comfortable when it comes_to the touchy and the feelly . But when old-style liberalism is constantly being challenged by more hard-headed approaches , couching any number of issues in terms of the well-being of children is about more_than affirming the party ' s commitment to society ' s weakest members . It ' s about trying to advance the agendas of a range of traditional but now unfashionable Democratic constituencies -- minorities , the poor , environmentalists , big_spenders -- without ever mentioning them by name . As the New Republic ' s Mickey Kaus has pointed_out , the master of this art is Marian Wright Edelman , whose Children ' s Defense Fund has gained great influence by pitching poverty policy as a contest between helpless tots and those who would sacrifice their interests . In Massachusetts last month , you could hear Democratic Sen . Edward M . Kennedy pushing a similar line : Taxing the rich was not a matter of class or redistribution , but of fairness to &quot; future generations. &quot; It ' s not just paleoliberal Democrats doing this . Out west , market-minded neoliberals like Gov . Roy Romer ( D-Colo. ) frame the environmental debate as a contest between &quot; shortsighted &quot; development and &quot; a livable planet for our children. &quot; And from coast to coast , Democrats such_as McCurdy have portrayed the difference between the parties on economic_policy as one of tax_breaks for the rich versus &quot; investing in our children ' s future. &quot; Sometimes such rhetoric is almost honest ; more often it ' s a way of making tough choices sound obvious . The Republican strategy is more schizophrenic . On issues where the party is united -- typically those where a hard-edged message appeals_to voter fears -- the kids that get talked_about are threatening teen-agers . In Texas , the gubernatorial campaign being waged by George W . Bush has , like those of many other Republicans , revolved largely around promises to get_tough on law and order . Bush ' s trouble is that Gov . Ann Richards has built more jail_cells than all her predecessors combined ; and , as elsewhere , the crime_rate is falling . No matter . Bush and other Republicans argue that what matters is juvenile crime , and that is rising . Maybe -- statistics are unclear . But suppose it ' s true . You might think that a candidate forever shouting about youth crime would offer policies designed to deal specifically with it . Wrong . Instead , Republicans pledge to build more prisons . Lots of voters like the sound of that . But they are not so sure about the areas where many Republicans are drifting to the right . So out comes the child-friendly rhetoric to smooth_over harsh surfaces to make the party ' s &quot; big tent &quot; even bigger . Heard that the GOP ' s &quot; Contract With America &quot; offers tax cuts for the wealthy ? Don ' t worry : The biggest is a per-child tax_credit to &quot; strengthen the family , &quot; so it must be progressive . Uneasy about remarks like that of McCurdy ' s religious-right opponent , James M . Inhofe , calling_for a &quot; moral revolution &quot; ? Fear not : He just wants to make America &quot; a decent place for all God ' s children. &quot; Nowhere have the two parties ' penchants for rhetorical child_abuse been so vivid as over another hot campaign topic : welfare . Here , Democrats who are queasy about Clinton ' s plan to put a two-year limit on cash assistance argue that welfare is a safety net for poor children , and that cutting_off checks threatens to hurt those the program is designed to protect . Republicans counter that they , too , are worried about kids . But no system , they say , could be more damaging to children than the current one . Both sides are being evasive . Since the 1960s , the debate has raged over whether welfare fosters dependency and encourages single parenthood . Treating welfare as a children ' s issue ignores these vital points . But if conservatives are really worried about poor kids , their proposals -- especially those of people such_as Charles Murray , who want to abolish welfare entirely -- seem risky . The suspicion lingers that many Republicans are , in fact , more concerned with how the &quot; undeserving poor &quot; behave than with the well-being of children . Welfare reform will be among Congress ' main bits of business next year . But lest anyone get their hopes too high that the terms of the debate will be less child-centric ( i.e. , more honest ) outside the fevered realm of the fall campaigns , remember health_care . In late July , Hillary Rodham Clinton launched the last push for sweeping reform by reading a letter from 8-year-old Jennifer Dawn Lucas , who had trouble getting insurance because she was born with a hole in her heart . &quot; I don ' t want our country to have a hole in its heart anymore , &quot; implored the First_Lady , &quot; when it comes_to taking_care of sick children like Jennifer. &quot; Within weeks , Hillary Clinton ' s crusade for universal coverage was over , and her main allies , led by Sen . Harris Wofford ( D-Pa. ) , had changed tack . Three years earlier , Wofford had propelled health_care to the top of the agenda by telling voters that if every criminal has the right to a lawyer , every American should have the right to a doctor . Now he was pushing a plan to provide universal coverage just for &quot; the most vulnerable : our children. &quot; Who could disagree ? There was , however , one small drawback to the &quot; kids first &quot; plan : It would have done next to nothing about the health-care crisis . The real problem , after all , has little to do with_children and everything to do with America spending twice as much ( as a percentage of gross_domestic_product ) on health_care as any other wealthy nation , yet still not covering all its people . Sadly , this fact was consistently drowned_out by the flood of tales of &quot; the most vulnerable &quot; -- like Jennifer Dawn Lucas . The truth is that health_care -- like welfare or crime -- is an adult issue . Of course , children are &quot; the country ' s future ; &quot; of course , most policies we implement today will affect their lives tomorrow . But these policies must indeed be adopted today , and suffusing every debate with emotionalism about children obscures not only the hard choices that need to be made , but what each party thinks_about making them . As long as that continues , much of the national debate ( such_as it is ) will be a charade -- and a childish one at that. *</TEXT>
