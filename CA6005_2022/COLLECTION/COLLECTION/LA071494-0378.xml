   <HEADLINE> MYSTERY PRESIDES OVER WHO WILL BE SIMPSON CASE JUDGE ; COURTS : ONE OF NINE JURISTS WILL SOON BE SEEN DAILY ON LIVE TV . EXPERTS SAY AN EVEN TEMPERAMENT IS ESSENTIAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Somewhere on the ninth floor of the Los Angeles Criminal_Courts Building sits a judge who is about to be vaulted out of relative obscurity into international celebrity . One of nine judges who preside over long cases on that high-security floor is likely to be named next week as the trial_judge in the case of People vs . Orenthal James Simpson . The judge who presides over the O.J. Simpson murder case &quot; will become the most famous trial_judge in this country because every day millions upon millions of Americans will be watching his or her every move , &quot; said UCLA criminal_law professor Peter Arenella . For a judge , such an assignment offers both opportunity and peril . Just as Washington federal trial_judge John Sirica is remembered for deftly handling the case of the Watergate burglars , Chicago federal trial_judge Julius Hoffman is recalled as an intemperate figure for the way he presided over the trial of seven anti-war activists who organized massive protests at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago . Five of the defendants were found guilty , but an appeals court reversed the convictions , in part because of what it called Hoffman ' s &quot; deprecatory and often antagonistic attitude toward the defense. &quot; The judge in the Simpson case may have a tougher job than Sirica or Hoffman because those cases -- important as they were -- were not televised . &quot; There are some judges who would love to have this case , &quot; said Superior_Court Judge Robert J . Perry , one of the nine under_consideration . &quot; Others would find it extremely difficult to be in the glare of the spotlight , &quot; said Perry , who was one of the prosecutors in the federal_government ' s unsuccessful 1984 cocaine conspiracy case against auto mogul John Z . DeLorean . &quot; Judges basically work in obscurity ; you get your name in the paper when you sentence someone , &quot; Perry said . The global scrutiny of the Simpson case poses an added burden , he said : &quot; The judge who ends_up with this case ends_up representing all_the judges . Keep_in mind , judges here have to run_for reelection. &quot; Superior_Court Judge Curtis B . Rappe , who presided over the Cotton Club and Eddie Nash murder cases but is not in the running for the Simpson assignment , said he thought many judges could cope_with the pressures of the former football star ' s trial . &quot; I ' m struck by the judges who get these high-visibility cases . They don ' t seem awed by them , &quot; Rappe said . &quot; When it comes_down to it , you settle in very quickly . You have the cameras in the courtroom , but when I did those cases I didn ' t watch them on TV at night . You ' re really not a TV_star ; you ' re a judge . that ' s it. &quot; Added Rappe , who became a judge in 1987 : &quot; The legal issues don ' t change if it ' s this case or a routine burglary. &quot; The candidates for the Simpson case are all &quot; long cause &quot; judges who handle lengthy , complex cases , according to Marcia Skolnick , spokeswoman for Presiding Judge Cecil J . Mills . Getting such an assignment is a sign that the judge is highly regarded by his colleagues . Rappe said it was particularly important for such a judge to get the case because he or she does not have a regular calendar of cases . &quot; You ' ll have top flight attorneys on both sides raising every issue , &quot; and the judge will need extra_time for research , he said . On Wednesday , Mills , speaking through spokeswoman Skolnick , said he has made no decision about who will preside over the Simpson case . He said no announcement will be made until Simpson ' s July 22 arraignment . Last week , Municipal Judge Kathleen Kennedy-Powell ruled that there was sufficient evidence to bind Simpson over for trial on charges that he murdered his former wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman . Mills is not saying anything publicly about his selection process . People familiar_with his decision-making style said he is likely to narrow the field to two or three before he makes a final choice . Sources also say that his second-in-command , Superior_Court Judge Lance Ito , is likely to play a role in the process . One judge , who asked not to be identified , said he thought Mills will probably try at least informally to learn the leanings of prosecutors and defense_attorneys . That way he could avoid the possibility that the judge would be challenged . Each side can reject one judge without stating any cause . If either wants to eliminate another judge , it has to show why the judge is not fit to hear the case . Lawyers and other legal_experts said the judge should have intelligence , independence , a strong sense of fairness , considerable composure and a measured temperament . &quot; You want a judge who is unflappable because of the pressure , both personal and professional , &quot; said criminal defense_lawyer Gerald L . Chaleff , who represented Angelo Buono , the man convicted of nine murders in the 1983 Hillside Strangler case . &quot; You want someone who is fair , but in control , evenhanded , but allows the lawyers to try their case. &quot; No matter how experienced the judge , &quot; this case will be different than any other case this judge has handled &quot; because of the overwhelming media attention , Chaleff said . He said the judge will have to cope_with the pressures of a widely watched proceeding while making_sure that the trial is conducted fairly . &quot; The most important characteristics are maturity , balance , fairness , a certain sense of calm and tranquillity , and comfort with chaos , &quot; said Los Angeles Superior_Court Judge Alexander Williams , a former federal prosecutor who currently is hearing civil cases and is not a candidate for the Simpson case . Attorneys and law professors alike said the judge needs to be analytically nimble . Even before the trial starts , the judge will have to deal with several &quot; very interesting and open-ended questions_of_law , &quot; Arenella said . &quot; For example , there will be a major pretrial battle over whether DNA testing is admitted , &quot; Arenella predicted . &quot; California appellate cases on this issue are in conflict . To understand the issues in DNA testing requires a certain degree of intelligence . There is a great_deal of scientific controversy over very subtle points of scientific methodology and reliability. &quot; Once the trial begins , the judge will need a strong knowledge of the rules_of_evidence because &quot; there are so many decisions the judge will have to make so quickly , &quot; said Loyola law_school professor Laurie Levenson . She added : &quot; You need a judge who is neither intimidated by nor plays to the television cameras. &quot; Another qualification : a thick_skin . Arenella said the judge should be &quot; someone who is not sensitive to the constant Monday morning quarterbacking and criticism that the Simpson case will be subjected_to by media commentators. &quot; Also essential is the ability to keep control of the courtroom , said Loyola law_school professor Samuel H . Pillsbury , a former prosecutor . &quot; As in any case that is hotly contested , both sides are going_to be trying to take_control of the courtroom , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s a very hard thing to explain because the judge is always in_charge . But there is a subtle process by which things are negotiated in a courtroom . One sign of a judge who is in control is that you don ' t notice it . There aren ' t enormous battles , &quot; Pillsbury said . In courthouse circles , a frequently named front-runner for the case is Judge Paul G . Flynn . He has presided in several noteworthy cases . In May , 1991 , Flynn sentenced an Echo Park man to 13 years in prison for voluntary manslaughter after he killed his former wife -- who had moved_back into his home -- and her lover as they lay_in bed watching an X-rated video . In April , Flynn ruled that rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg and two other men must stand trial in the 1993 murder of an Ethiopian immigrant . s He was unavailable for comment . Perry , 43 , is considered a long_shot because he has been_on the bench for less time than any of the others ( he was appointed in 1992 by Gov . Pete Wilson ) and because Simpson ' s original attorney , Howard Weitzman , was one of the lawyers who opposed Perry when he prosecuted the De Lorean case . The other contenders are : * Nancy M . Brown , 58 , a veteran Superior_Court judge with a strong reputation for independence . She presided over the preliminary hearing in the 1980 Bob ' s Big Boy restaurant murders , in which four people were killed and five were wounded in a freezer . * Charles E . Horan , 43 , a former prosecutor in the district_attorney ' s major narcotics unit , who used to play in a rock ' n ' roll band called &quot; Use a Guitar , Go_to Prison. &quot; * Jacqueline A . Connor , 42 , a former deputy district_attorney who started the office ' s sexual_assault unit . While supervising judge of the West Los Angeles branch of the Municipal Court , she attempted to organize a program to improve relations between police_officers and people charged with resisting arrest . * John W . Ouderkirk , 52 , who presided over the trial of Damian Monroe Williams , convicted in the beating of trucker Reginald O . Denny on the first day of the 1992 Los Angeles riots . * William R . Pounders , 55 , who presided over the first McMartin Pre-school trial . He was replaced for the second trial after speaking on television about the case . * J.D. Smith , 58 , a former police_officer , who has been a judge since 1982 . Last year , after defense_lawyers asserted that the district_attorney ' s office tampered with witnesses and withheld evidence , Smith agreed to send the &quot; Bryant family &quot; drug and murder case to the attorney_general ' s office for prosecution , but a state appeals court ruled_in March that he had overstepped his authority and returned the prosecution to the district_attorney . * George W . Trammel III , 57 , who has the longest tenure of any of the candidates . He started as a Municipal Court judge in 1971 , where he declared that municipal jury panels discriminated against Latinos , and moved to the Superior_Court in 1988 . Most of the high-publicity criminal trials in the Criminal_Courts Building are held_on the ninth floor because court officials can maintain tighter security there than in other parts of the building . The ninth floor was the setting for Simpson ' s preliminary hearing . Times staff writer Andrea Ford contributed to this story .</TEXT>
