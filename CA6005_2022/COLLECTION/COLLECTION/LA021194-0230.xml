   <HEADLINE> 4TH QUARTER CAPS A GM TURNAROUND ; AUTOS : COMPANY EARNED $ 2.46 BILLION LAST YEAR , INCLUDING A RARE QUARTERLY PROFIT IN NORTH_AMERICA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A year ago , General Motors Corp . was spending an average of 35 hours to build a car . Today , that time has been cut by 10 % . In 1992 , GM pumped up sales by shipping nearly 750 # 000 vehicles at cut-rate prices to rental car_companies . In 1993 , it sold only 500 # 000 cars to rental fleets , while boosting more profitable retail sales . Two years ago , GM had a salaried staff of 91 # 000 . Today , those ranks have been trimmed to 71 # 000 ; several thousand more white-collar jobs will be eliminated this year . These signs of a more efficient and cost-conscious company are among the reasons why GM , once the basket case of the world automotive industry , reported fourth-quarter earnings Thursday of $ 1.18 billion . More important , the auto behemoth made a quarterly profit in its North_American auto operations for the first time since the spring of 1989 . GM ' s turnaround from a $ 652-million fourth-quarter loss in 1992 is further evidence of a U.S. auto boom being driven by free-spending consumers seeking to replace aging vehicles . Together , GM , Ford Motor Co . and Chrysler Corp . had operating earnings of $ 7.41 billion in 1993 -- the Big Three ' s first profitable year since 1989 . GM earned $ 2.46 billion , or $ 2.13 a share , for 1993 . The company lost a record $ 23.5 billion , or $ 38.28 a share , in 1992 , but that included a onetime $ 20.8-billion charge for future retiree health benefits . GM ' s revenue for 1993 totaled $ 138.2 billion , up 4.5 % from 1992 . While the company ' s automotive operations showed significant improvement , the 1993 earnings were solely attributable to the strong performance of three non-auto units : GMAC financial , EDS computer services and Hughes Electronics . In the fourth quarter , however , the company ' s automotive operations contributed more_than 40 % of the firm ' s $ 1.28-a-share profit . The biggest turnaround came_in North_America , where GM had operating earnings of $ 427 million in the final three months , compared to a loss of $ 1.79 billion in the year-earlier period . &quot; We ' re encouraged by the trend , but we can ' t be satisfied until the earnings power of our operations in North_America is fully restored , &quot; said John F . Smith , GM chief_executive and president . The company -- belittled for its inefficient factories , bloated work_force and dated cars and trucks -- has lost nearly $ 18 billion in North_America since 1990 , including $ 982 million in full-year 1993 . Smith ' s goal was to make the company profitable in 1993 in North_America before interest , taxes and retiree health_care benefits . Having hit that target , he now promises net earnings in 1994 . &quot; No excuses , &quot; Smith said . In recent weeks , the expectation of improved results has driven GM ' s stock to its highest level in 30 years . But the shares retreated Thursday to $ 62.50 , down $ 1.75 in trading on the New York Stock_Exchange as investors took profits in the entire auto sector . Analysts said GM ' s results were aided by a $ 444-million federal income_tax credit taken_in the fourth quarter . &quot; About 40 % of the fourth-quarter net_income came from the tax department , not the auto department , &quot; said David Healy , an analyst with S.G. Warburg , a New York brokerage . Still , most analysts were impressed with GM ' s advance . &quot; Without a doubt , year over year GM is making progress in North_America , &quot; said David Garrity , analyst for McDonald &amp; Co . Investments in New Jersey . GM attributed the improvement to both the growing economy and the company ' s ongoing restructuring . The company ' s U.S. sales increased about 6 % last year , but its market share retreated to 33.2 % from 33.9 % in 1992 . GM officials said the share loss was in part due_to 250 # 000 fewer fleet sales . The fleet sales kept factories running but provided little profit and eroded new car sales . &quot; That is an assembly_plant of volume , &quot; said G . Richard Wagoner , chief financial_officer . &quot; But it was costing us a tremendous amount of money. &quot; With retail demand on the rise , GM has been able to reduce rebates and other incentives . The average incentive was $ 880 per vehicle in the 1993 fourth quarter , down from $ 960 a year earlier . GM Comes_Back Quarterly profit , in millions of dollars : $ 1 # 180 - $ 21 # 044 ( includes provisions for future retiree health_care costs. ) Source : Company reports ; American Automobile Manufacturers Assn .</TEXT>
