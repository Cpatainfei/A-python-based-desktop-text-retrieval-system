   <TEXT> Re &quot; Riordan Declares AIDS Emergency in L.A. , &quot; Sept . 7 : As a physician who cares_for youth infected with HIV and chairman of the Adolescent HIV Consortium ( a coalition of over 80 community youth service_agencies in Los Angeles County ) , I would like to applaud the leadership of Mayor Richard Riordan , Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg as well as the rest of the City_Council . Their support for needle exchange demonstrates their willingness to act quickly in a crisis to ensure better health for our community . AIDS is continuing to spread rapidly to youth . Approximately 20 % of my youth infected with HIV have histories of sharing needles . One-third of the homeless youth I provide care to also report injecting drugs . Many of these youth express an unwillingness to begin drug treatment but readily accept the usage of clean needles . The Clean Needles Now program in Hollywood has undoubtedly saved lives by providing clean needles to my patients . In addition , they frequently refer youth to my clinics for HIV testing , medical and psychosocial services . This facilitates the provision of HIV-prevention education as well as drug treatment . The need to expand needle exchange to other areas of Los Angeles is still critical . Public education needs to be expanded to these communities to reassure the public that research has conclusively demonstrated that needle exchange does not promote the increased usage of drugs . MARVIN BELZER MD Assistant_Professor of Clinical Pediatrics and Medicine , USC * * Mayor Riordan ' s declaration of an emergency to prevent the police from issuing citations for the illegal needle exchange program is irrational and destructive . There is nothing to stop the needles handed_out from becoming contaminated and shared like those they replace . Since the life_expectancy of an IV drug abuser is half that of a person infected with HIV , supporters of such programs cannot claim to be saving lives . In fact , they are enabling addiction . Only the dope lords and social_workers benefit from needle handouts . Police_Chief Willie Williams should reject this monstrous idea and protect our citizens , including those addicted to drugs , from its harmful consequences . DAVID PARKER Agoura Hills</TEXT>
