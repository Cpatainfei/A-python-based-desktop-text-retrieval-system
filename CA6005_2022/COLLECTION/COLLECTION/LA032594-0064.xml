   <HEADLINE> NEWSWIRE : NORMAN ' S 63 LEADS PLAYERS CHAMPIONSHIP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Greg Norman took_advantage of a soft , vulnerable course for a nine-under-par 63 that led an assault on par Thursday in the first round of the Players Championship at the TPC course in Ponte Vedra , Fla . The course , once criticized by players as being too difficult , turned docile in the ideal conditions . Even though Norman birdied five consecutive holes and tied the course record set_in 1992 by Fred Couples , he held only a two-shot lead over Tom Kite , Lee Janzen , Jeff Maggert and Colin Montgomerie . Jurisprudence Six Hartford Whalers must complete 20 hours of community service during the off-season for getting_into a fight at a nightclub owned by Buffalo Bill quarterback Jim Kelly . Arrested were Pat Verbeek , Geoffrey Sanderson , Marc Potvin , Chris Pronger , Mark Janssen and Todd Harkins , along with assistant coach Kevin McCarthy . The players , in town to play the Sabres tonight , pleaded guilty to trespassing . McCarthy also was charged with trespassing and faces a court hearing . Guard Vernon Maxwell of the Houston Rockets was fined $ 1 # 500 in Houston after pleading guilty to a misdemeanor charge of illegally carrying a gun in his car . The Los Angeles Municipal Court issued a bench_warrant for the arrest of UCLA defensive back Tommy Bennett for failing to appear at his arraignment . Bennett was to have answered seven charges that included false financial_statements , perjury , possession of forged materials and grand theft , university police said . The referee of a fight Ray Mercer is accused of trying to fix testified in New York Supreme Court that he heard a lot of talking but he never heard the $ 100 # 000 bribe offer Mercer allegedly made . Wayne Kelly said he thought it was odd Mercer was accused because it was Jesse Ferguson he reprimanded during last year ' s bout . Hockey The NHL Board of Governors voted to adopt a weighted drawing for determining the first pick in the annual entry draft beginning in 1995 . This year ' s first two picks will be made by the Florida Panthers and Mighty Ducks . Skiing Tommy Moe , spurred by finishing ninth in the downhill a day earlier , won the men ' s super-giant slalom in 1 minute 5.74 seconds , well ahead of Roman Torn of Canada , at the U.S. Alpine Ski Championships in Winter Park , Colo . Shannon Nobis won the women ' s super-G in 1:11.23 , 0.02 seconds ahead of Picabo Street . Miscellany Stanford ' s 200-yard relay team of Bill Schell , Brian Retterer , Tyler Mayfield and Joe Hudepohl set U.S. records twice at the NCAA men ' s swimming championships at Minnesota . Retterer also set an American record in the 100 backstroke on the first leg of the 400 medley . Arizona ' s Chad Carvin also broke the American record twice in the 500-yard freestyle . . . . Allegations of an effort to conceal NCAA violations at the University of Maine surfaced again as Anne R . McCoy , the school ' s associate director of athletics , charged Mike Ploszek , the athletic director , with planning to hide eligibility problems .</TEXT>
