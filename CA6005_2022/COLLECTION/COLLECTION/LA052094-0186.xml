   <HEADLINE> U.S. DROPS BID TO TRY ALLEGED RAPIST ; COURTS : ATTY . GEN . RENO SAYS DOUBLE-JEOPARDY PROTECTION BARS CHARGING THE MEXICAN IN CALIFORNIA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States is abandoning efforts to extradite a Mexican national in the rape of a 4-year-old Riverside County girl after concluding that the protection against double_jeopardy bars trying him in California , Atty . Gen . Janet Reno said Thursday . However , Reno said she understands that Mexico is appealing_to toughen the 31 1 / 2-year sentence Serapio Zuniga Rios received from a Mexican court . Mexico refused to extradite Zuniga , who fled to his homeland and was arrested there in December . &quot; We have checked and double-checked and have concluded that double_jeopardy would prevent the extradition and trial in California , &quot; Reno said at her weekly meeting with reporters . A Justice_Department spokesman said that attorneys from the Office of International Affairs had been told by Riverside prosecutors that California bars double_jeopardy and that Zuniga could not be prosecuted under state law if he were brought_back to the United States . In September , 1992 , Zuniga allegedly kidnaped the child from her parents ' ranch and sexually assaulted her , then wrapped her in a blanket that he hung from a tree . In addition to the brutality of the crime , the case became involved in the NAFTA vote and was a sore point in U.S.-Mexican relations . Zuniga was allegedly enraged over being fired from the ranch . Mexico has never extradited one of its citizens to the United States for trial , and late last month , the Mexican government notified the U.S. Embassy in Mexico_City that Zuniga had been tried in secret and convicted of sexual_assault , abduction , burglary and imprisoned there . Robert S . Gelbard of the State_Department said on the eve of a two-day meeting between U.S. and Mexican officials May 9 that &quot; we are deeply shocked and disappointed by the Mexican government ' s actions. &quot; &quot; The Mexican government has known from the beginning that we have considered the Zuniga Rios case to be of fundamental importance , &quot; he said . &quot; We thought we had complete assurances from the Mexican government . . . that this man would be extradited . . . . If they are not prepared to extradite Zuniga Rios under the assurances we have gotten , under what circumstances are they going_to extradite anyone ? &quot; A senior State_Department official , insisting on anonymity , went further . &quot; They lied to us , &quot; he said . &quot; There was amazement , horror and real anger when we learned what they had done. &quot; The case became a NAFTA issue when Rep . E . Clay Shaw Jr . ( R-Fla. ) said he had swung his vote to support the trade agreement in November only after Mexico ' s then-attorney general personally assured him that the suspect would be extradited . But Reno tried to downplay any problem with Mexico over the case , saying she had been told only that Zuniga would be extradited if a court_ordered the extradition . &quot; I ' ve expressed concern to the government of Mexico and told them that it is important that we move_on and develop action and move forward on matters of concern to us , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
