   <HEADLINE> N . IRELAND : TIME FOR REAL DEBATE ; BRITAIN SHOULD GRANT VISA TO SINN FEIN ' S ADAMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Earlier this week , two Northern Irish politicians , one of them Sinn Fein ' s Gerry Adams , met in debate on &quot; Larry King Live. &quot; It ' s a debate that all_of Britain should have heard . Commenting on the broadcast , the editorial page of the London Independent rightly said : &quot; After a long conflict that has claimed more_than 3 # 000 lives , one might have expected the IRA ' s chief apologist to face vigorous public cross-examination in London and Belfast . Instead , the United States is playing host to the debates . . . . &quot; The debate is dragging its feet here in Britain , while in the United States and the Republic_of_Ireland , it is alive and fervent . British indifference to Northern_Ireland allowed injustice to fester unchallenged for generations , and so provide a recruiting ground for the IRA . &quot; The danger now is that paralysis here will hold_up the peace . Britain should play its proper role , and not simply look_on as Washington and Dublin take the lead. &quot; Adams is president of Sinn Fein , the_Irish nationalist party whose military wing is the terrorist Irish_Republican_Army . On Aug . 30 he unexpectedly announced a &quot; complete cessation of military operations &quot; by the IRA . On &quot; Larry King Live &quot; he was up against Ken Maginnis of the Ulster Unionist Party , who is publicly skeptical about Adams ' intentions . One can agree with the London Independent without suggesting for a moment that Adams , who will appear today before the Los Angeles World Affairs Council , is the most important nationalist leader in Northern_Ireland . That distinction , in our judgment , belongs_to John Hume , president of Northern_Ireland ' s Social Democratic and Labor_Party , who has been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize by members of the European Parliament . Regrettably , few Angelenos have heard of Hume or know how he and Adams differ . But what is more regrettable is that Adams is speaking today so far from Britain , where there are many potential debate opponents who indeed know this difference . Britain has promised that three months after &quot; a permanent end to the use of , or support for , paramilitary violence , &quot; to quote the 1993 Downing Street Declaration , Sinn Fein will be welcome at multilateral negotiations on the future of Northern_Ireland . Because Adams did not use the word permanent in his Aug . 30 announcement , Britain need not begin negotiations on Dec . 1 . However , Prime_Minister John Major would serve Britain ' s interests by taking the Independent ' s point and issuing Adams a visa . President Clinton has lifted the ban on political contact between U.S._government officials and representatives of Sinn Fein . Major cannot go so far so soon , but surely the time has come for informal but public_debate to include Adams in Britain as well as in the United States .</TEXT>
