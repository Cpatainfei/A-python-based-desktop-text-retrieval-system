   <HEADLINE> U.S. CEDING UPPER_HAND TO N . KOREA , CRITICS SAY ; ASIA : WASHINGTON WANTS PYONGYANG ' S NUCLEAR PROGRAM FROZEN . BUT ITS CONCESSIONS COULD INVALIDATE ANY DEAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The outlines of a deal between the United States and North_Korea are slowly emerging , and critics say they aren ' t pretty . As part of a bargain to stop the fast-growing North_Korean nuclear program , the Clinton_Administration has quietly made concessions that could permit the program ' s resumption on short notice , outside analysts say , even though it would be frozen for the immediate future . Leaders of the isolated Pyongyang regime will retain &quot; a latent ability to break_out of this deal if they feel it is unsatisfactory , &quot; said Jonathan Pollack , a Korea expert at the RAND Corp . in Santa Monica . And if they do , maintained Henry Sokolski , a former Pentagon specialist on non-proliferation , &quot; North_Korea would still be producing new plutonium in the reactor it had before and be able to make at least as_many bombs as it now can. &quot; The CIA estimates North_Korea has already produced enough nuclear material for one to two bombs . The United States and North_Korea began to move toward a settlement of the nuclear crisis in a vague , conditional agreement signed Aug . 12 after talks in Geneva . Those talks are scheduled to resume Friday . In the deal sketched out last month , the United States said it is prepared to take steps toward diplomatic recognition of North_Korea and to supply it with new , less dangerous nuclear technology if North_Korea will freeze its nuclear program and will rejoin the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty . The treaty provides_for international safeguards to prevent development of nuclear bombs . Administration officials argue that the emerging deal is of tremendous benefit to the United States and its allies , primarily because it would eliminate what Robert L . Gallucci , the top U.S. negotiator with Pyongyang , regularly calls North_Korea ' s &quot; strategic &quot; nuclear capability -- the ability to produce regular , large amounts of nuclear fuel that it could use to make bombs or export to other countries . But an examination of the fine print of the written agreement signed by U.S. and North_Korean officials last month and the public explanations they have offered since shows that , for a number of the promised gains won by the Administration , there were significant qualifications or concessions : * North_Korea would halt construction of two huge new nuclear_reactors . But its existing , smaller reactor at Yongbyon -- which has already been used to produce plutonium , a key ingredient for nuclear_weapons -- would be left intact . * North_Korea has agreed to &quot; seal &quot; its reprocessing plant , which could turn spent nuclear fuel into plutonium . But so far , there is no guarantee that this reprocessing facility would be dismantled in the fashion the United States wants . * About 8 # 000 rods of spent nuclear fuel removed from the Yongbyon plant in the spring would be sealed or encased for protection . Yet instead of the rods ' being shipped out of the country for disposal , as the Administration had wanted , U.S. officials have begun to acknowledge that they could be kept_in North_Korea . * The Clinton_Administration is still insisting that North_Korea submit to special international inspections , which would clear_up what North_Korea has done_in its nuclear program . But the Administration also has begun to make concessions about the timing of the inspections , admitting they can be put_off for now and perhaps for years . &quot; It is our view that the actual implementation of special inspections , which we recognize is a serious political issue for ( North_Korea ) , need not be undertaken immediately for a settlement to be successful , &quot; Gallucci said at a press briefing earlier this month . Postponement of the special inspections is significant , because they are the issue that sparked the Korea crisis in the first place . In March , 1993 , after the International Atomic Energy Agency asked to inspect two sites in North_Korea that officials felt might contain telltale nuclear wastes , Pyongyang countered by announcing its withdrawal from the Non-Proliferation Treaty . The terms of the deal now being envisioned by the Administration would bring North_Korea back into the treaty . But the deal would also mean that North_Korea has won extensive talks with the United States and the first moves toward diplomatic recognition and economic help before it goes_along with the special inspections the IAEA originally sought . U.S. officials point_out that North_Korea will not get the big final payoff -- a $ 4-billion light-water nuclear facility produced with foreign technology and financing -- until it goes_along with the special inspections and explains how much weapons-grade nuclear fuel it has already produced . The light-water reactor itself will take an estimated six to 10 years to complete , so the special inspections could be done during this extended period . Those who defend the proposed agreement are not worried about the delay . &quot; If this deal works , the question of the past will take_care of itself over time , &quot; asserted Robert Manning of the Progressive Policy Institute . But some skeptics contend that the proposed deal won ' t accomplish much . &quot; In some very profound sense , we are exactly where we were when this whole crisis began , &quot; Pollack said . After a year of talks , North_Korea will be back in the Non-Proliferation Treaty without submitting to special inspections now or anytime soon . And it will have at_hand , and ready for renewed use , much of its current materials and technology if it decides to resume the weapons program . Why did the Administration decide to make such a deal ? How did_it find itself giving benefits and asking its allies in Seoul and Tokyo to contribute still more rewards to have North_Korea finally comply with the international rules it was supposed to obey in early 1993 ? The first factor , analysts say , is that the Administration had surprisingly few weapons in its arsenal to pressure North_Korea . Administration officials made_it plain that they did not want to get_into a war with North_Korea that , by Pentagon estimates , would be winnable but result in tens of thousands of U.S. casualties . And , last spring , the United States found that it would be difficult , if not impossible , to persuade China and Japan to go_along with economic sanctions against Pyongyang . As a result , said Douglas Paal , a former George_Bush Administration official who now heads the Asia Pacific Policy Center , North_Korea now &quot; senses that the United States will seek an agreement at any price. &quot; The second factor affecting the Administration is the underlying belief among many in Washington that North_Korea ' s Communist regime probably will fall_apart in the next few years , so the promised economic benefits may_not have to be paid . With the death last July of President Kim Il Sung , North_Korea faces a difficult transition to new political leadership at a time when its economy is steadily declining . &quot; Time is_on our side , &quot; argued one congressional source , echoing sentiments voiced elsewhere in Washington . &quot; As long as we can maintain the current freeze and continue talking , it is to our advantage . I think we ' re never going_to see a light-water reactor up and running in North_Korea , because there ' s a good chance there won ' t be a North_Korea at the time it is ready. &quot; The third factor underlying the deal is Pyongyang ' s tough , clever negotiating tactics : The rapid , continuing pace of the North_Korean nuclear program put the Administration in the position of having to struggle just to maintain the status_quo and prevent the situation from getting_worse . Thus , one of the main concessions won by the Administration in Geneva was to prevent North_Korea from finishing new nuclear_reactors that are much bigger than the ones they already have . Moreover , the Clinton_Administration has been forced to try to figure_out what should be done with the 8 # 000 highly radioactive fuel rods North_Korea suddenly removed from the Yongbyon reactor in the spring . In taking that nuclear fuel from the reactor , North_Korea created a major new problem that didn ' t exist a year ago -- and used it to extract further concessions . North_Korea ' s pattern of first creating problems and then bargaining them away is likely to continue . Indeed , some experts warn that in the next few weeks , North_Korea could use these fuel rods to try to extract some more concessions from the Administration . &quot; The North_Koreans are deliberately letting the spent fuel deteriorate , &quot; said a Washington-based diplomat who follows North_Korea . &quot; A few weeks from now , the North_Koreans could say that these rods are deteriorating so fast that they have to be reprocessed ( into plutonium ) . That would be the next round of brinkmanship , and the United States would be at a disadvantage. &quot; In the weeks since the August agreement , Administration officials have devoted most of their efforts toward trying to organize and work_out specifics of the economic package they will offer to North_Korea . The biggest of these is the proposed light-water reactor -- which would supply nuclear_power with technology that cannot easily be used for nuclear_weapons -- because the reactor produces a much lower_quality of plutonium than the gas-graphite reactors North_Korea is now using . In recent weeks , the United States has been quietly trying to put_together a consortium of countries or companies to supply the technology for this reactor and to finance the $ 4-billion project . That effort is in some ways a mammoth dispute over construction and design contracts . &quot; It ' s not clear how the consortium would work , &quot; one U.S. official said recently . &quot; I think it ' ll be a combination of South_Korea , Japan and Germany. &quot; But another U.S. official said he doubts that South_Korea , which will provide most of the financing for the project , will be willing to help pay_for North_Korea to get any German technology . U.S. officials admit that one of the biggest unresolved problems is that the Administration will have to get clearance from Congress for South_Korea to supply light-water reactors to Pyongyang . Some U.S. laws forbid exports to North_Korea , and other laws restrict the re-export of American-licensed nuclear technology . &quot; There is going_to have to be some nuclear cooperation agreement between the United States and North_Korea , &quot; said one congressional source . &quot; that ' s a dicey proposition. &quot; The Administration also has been quietly trying to work_out details of another benefit it promised North_Korea in writing last month in Geneva -- that the United States will arrange for &quot; interim &quot; energy supplies for North_Korea in the years before the light-water reactor is built .</TEXT>
