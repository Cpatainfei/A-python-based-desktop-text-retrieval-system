   <HEADLINE> AL MARTINEZ : DOVE FEATHERS IN THE DUST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Suppose you gave a peace movement and nobody came ? that ' s the state we ' re in now that the Cold_War is over and hardly anyone is worried about nuclear missiles falling from the skies . Well , yes , there ' s that situation in Bosnia where children are dying in the snow , but since that doesn ' t threaten us directly we can accept a little , you know , hell-raising here and there . Everyone on this side of the old Iron_Curtain cheered when the Berlin Wall came_down and the Soviet_Union fell_apart . The threat of annihilation was suddenly as cold as yesterday ' s soup . But peace has its dark side , too . For one thing , more_than 100 # 000 defense and aerospace workers in L.A. County have lost their jobs because we don ' t need all those guns and fighter jets and missiles anymore . And Yakov Smirnoff , the Russian immigrant who used to make a living poking_fun at Communism , has had to retool his shtick to embrace in-law jokes . Is there anything sadder ? I ' m not saying peace is hell , but it comes_close . Even Jerry Rubin is looking_for work . I know I said he was a publicity hound and I ' d never mention his name again , but this is different . The guy has only $ 2 to his name and the wolf is at the door . You remember Rubin . He ' s our most visible peace activist . As director of L.A. ' s Alliance for Survival , he was to international crisis what seismologist Lucy Jones is to earth_tremors . Whenever hawks rattled sabers , Rubin was_on the tube waving dove feathers , and we cheered his efforts . But nobody ' s cheering anymore , and the dove feathers are lying useless in the dust . * The peace movement has been falling_apart for about two years now , ever since the Soviet_Union died , but it wasn ' t until last New Year ' s Eve that Rubin realized he had to find work . Only 40 people showed_up at the Alliance for Survival ' s annual peace party . In the past , as_many as 300 came , paying $ 20 at the door for an evening of food and entertainment . It was the alliance ' s biggest fund-raiser of the year , and it flopped . &quot; We had a good time and sang ' Auld Lang Syne , ' but my heart was broken , &quot; Rubin said the other day . &quot; No one came . It was over. &quot; The impact was more_than psychological . As full-time director of the alliance , Rubin took half of its profits from various events to support himself . His share amounted to about $ 6 # 000 a year ; not enough to maintain a lifestyle of the rich and famous but , with a working wife , an adequate amount . The New Year ' s Eve flop proved that no one is interested in peace movements anymore . But that was just one indication . Rubin has seen attendance at most alliance functions drop_by 70 % . &quot; There ' s $ 2 left in my bank_account , &quot; he said in a tone usually reserved for those announcing the horrors of war rather than the horrors of peace . &quot; I had to sell bumper stickers on the beach to pay the phone bill. &quot; Every peace group is suffering , Rubin says . &quot; It ' s not just us . Staff_members are being laid_off , and there are no retirement_benefits . The movement just isn ' t popular anymore . I ' ve got_to find a real job. &quot; * that ' s not going_to be easy for a guy who ' s 50 and graying . Rubin has become a metaphor for the peace movement itself , growing older with limited options . No one ' s going_to care that he ' s worked 14 years on behalf of peace . Where do you put_on a resume that you ' ve gone_to jail five times and fasted 15 times to help make everyone aware of the dangers of war ? How do you measure the impact of marches and banners and buttons and bumper stickers ? You don ' t get the Nobel Prize for being a little guy out there in a corner of the world waving dove feathers . &quot; Look_at me , &quot; Rubin said disconsolately . &quot; I ' m a 50-year-old high_school dropout with no skills . Well , actually , a high_school kick-out . I don ' t type , I can ' t drive and I don ' t hear too well . Who ' s going_to hire me ? &quot; He ' s got a point . When I asked what kind of a job he was looking_for , he wasn ' t even sure of that . He applied at some department_stores , but was turned_down . He ' d rather not sell shoes anyhow . He wants to consult or maybe have his own talk_show , but both possibilities seem remote . Whatever happens , he ' s going_to stay with the alliance , probably on a weekend basis , and try to turn it toward the environmental movement . &quot; Peace isn ' t a fad , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s a lifetime commitment . But I ' ve got_to eat. &quot; I ' m not sure how you thank someone who once marched with crowds and now walks alone . I ' m not sure how you say &quot; you mattered. &quot; But if it ' s any consolation , Jerry Rubin , you did matter . Too_bad that isn ' t enough to pay the rent .</TEXT>
