   <HEADLINE> SMOKE GETS IN YOUR EYES WITH THIS ONE ; PURPORTED ANTI-SMOKING INITIATIVE IS A COVER FOR TOBACCO LOBBY ' S FIGHT AGAINST LOCAL LAWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Let the public beware : Professional signature gatherers are trying to qualify an initiative for the November ballot that purports to favor a &quot; single , tough , uniform statewide law &quot; to regulate smoking in restaurants . Uniform the new law would be , but only those given to delusions would believe that a measure backed by a tobacco company -- Philip Morris Inc. -- could possibly be tough . The initiative would in fact wipe_out the approximately 270 effective local ordinances that limit or ban smoking in the workplace and in restaurants . Those measures enjoy broad public support and have the endorsement of most major health organizations . In their place would go a weaker rule that would significantly roll back much of the progress that has lately been made to protect the nonsmoking public from the disease-promoting and even cumulatively fatal effects of tobacco smoke . The initiative is a deception , plain and simple , a fraud upon the public . No one who is concerned about public health could possibly support it . Responding to complaints about the misleading claims made by the initiative ' s advocates , acting Secretary_of_State Tony Miller has warned that deliberate misrepresentation of a measure ' s contents in the course of gathering signatures is a crime that &quot; will not be tolerated. &quot; That warning may have been responsible_for halting an expensive phone-bank operation that sought backing for the initiative by claiming that it would impose strict regulations on smoking in public places . It hardly needs demonstrating that tobacco companies are not in the business of promoting anti-smoking measures . They make their money by selling cigarettes . One unfortunate marketing problem they face is that their product keeps killing_off their clientele ; as successive U.S. surgeons_general have reminded us , smoking contributes to close to 500 # 000 American deaths each year from various cancers , heart_disease , stroke and emphysema . So the demand for cigarettes has to be constantly bolstered . that ' s harder to do , though , when smoking is actively discouraged by law , as it is with local bans or strict limits on smoking in restaurants and workplaces . that ' s why the tobacco_industry wants to override community rules with a statewide law that has been drafted to its own specifications , to serve its own interests . Smoking kills , and any weakening of anti-smoking laws , however it may be disguised , shamefully abets needless deaths . The purported anti-smoking initiative is a sham , to be scorned and rejected .</TEXT>
