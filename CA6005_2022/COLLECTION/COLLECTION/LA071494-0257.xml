   <HEADLINE> MIKE DOWNEY : WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : SEMIFINALS ; THE GIANTS REACH THIS SUPER BOWL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When we spun the globe to begin this great adventure , Passport to Pasadena , there were 154 nations , from Australia to Zaire , fighting for the heavyweight soccer championship of the world . Iceland wanted it . The Ivory_Coast wanted it . Wales wanted it . Now , only two can still win , and the World Cup couldn ' t do much better than this -- Italy vs . Brazil , the clash of the titans . Roma vs . Rio . Roberto vs . Romario . Sophia Loren vs . Sonia Braga . Come Sunday , sit_back and sop_up the juiciest of matches . This one is going tohave an international flavor , Europe mixing with South_America , with a_couple_of three-time champions out_to regain their standing as soccer ' s superpower . And remember , it ain ' t over until the fat tenor sings . I can already hear it , and see it , and smell it . I can picture the scene Sunday at , say , Cafe Brasil , 10831 Venice Boulevard , Los Angeles , home of &quot; The Real Homemade Meal , &quot; or at By Brazil , 1615 Cabrillo , Torrance , home of &quot; All You Can Eat Brazilian Barbecue , &quot; or at 14 Below , 1348 14th Street , Santa Monica , featuring its big- screen TV at &quot; Brazilian World Cup Headquarters , &quot; or at Zabumba ! 10717 Venice , L.A. , with live music every night at &quot; The Brazilian Party Place. &quot; It ' ll be a hot-time in the old town Sunday night . Just as I can picture the scene at any of Southern California ' s two or three billion Italian restaurants , where a whole ocean of wine is going_to get drunk Sunday , in happiness or in sadness . Who will win ? I have no idea . This is Frazier vs . Ali . All we can do is put them in the center of the arena and let them slug it out . Who needs to win ? &quot; Brazil needs to win the title more_than Italy does , &quot; claims Bebeto , speaking on behalf of his Brazilian teammates . &quot; It will make our country better . We need to give Brazil a big present . &quot; We are not going_to leave any stone unturned until we have won. &quot; Brazil deserves a break . Things are so unstable down there , even the money has changed . On July 1 , while the players were touring North_America , back home the entire system of currency switched_over to something else . Now these poor guys don ' t even know whether they will be paid_off in real or cruzeiro real or if they had better cash_in those traveler ' s checks right after going_to Disneyland . And then there is Carlos Alberto Parreira , the beleaguered Brazil coach , whose job security seems to rate right up there with any manager of the New York Yankees . Parreira is surprised to find Italy in the final . He thought for_sure Germany would be there for Pasadena ' s big party . So did Germany ' s coach , Berti Vogts . So did Germany ' s former coach , Franz Beckenbauer . And so did , well , Germany . But you know how Italy loves a party . So , what we have are a_couple_of dream teams , representing , as Brazilian superstar Romario says , the &quot; two great schools of soccer. &quot; ( Sorry , Berti . Sorry , Franz. ) It was quite a scene in the Rose Bowl parking_lot once Brazil headed_off Sweden , 1-0 . A man on a 20-foot bicycle built for three ( complete with baby seat ) pedaled around the crowd , shouting : &quot; Bra-zeeel ! Bra-zeeel ! &quot; There was singing and dancing and there was Moribel Moraes , dropping to her knees to kiss the Pasadena cement . Her friend , Martha Wade , 26 , of Costa Mesa , said : &quot; She came all_the way up from Brazil just for this . I guess you can see how happy she is. &quot; One more game like this and she would be even happier . that ' s when California really could be the Brazilian Party Place . ( Or the Italian. )</TEXT>
