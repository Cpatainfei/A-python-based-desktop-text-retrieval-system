   <HEADLINE> RICHARD NIXON : 1913-1994 ; VOICES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; I think he concluded , however , in the final analysis , that the economy was beginning to erode very seriously , that conflict was shaping_up in the Middle_East and that he simply couldn ' t govern , and therefore it was time to leave. ' -- Alexander M . Haig , Nixon ' s last chief_of_staff * &quot; I thought it ( the Watergate break-in ) was a Democratic dirty trick to embarrass Nixon in the ' 72 campaign . . . . But the real triggering episode that brought_about the fall of Richard Nixon was that decision to try to contain the thing instead of going_to the American people and saying &quot; You would n ' t believe what some of these clowns have done &quot; and firing them , maybe on television.But he didn ' t make that decision , and it brought him down. ' -- former Sen . Howard H . Baker Jr . ( R-Tenn. ) * &quot; I think the evidence , the accumulation of evidence , was simply overwhelming . As we sat and listened to the tape-recorded conversations , you could not ignore the fact that there were encouragements to commit perjury . . . discussion of the payment of hush_money , obstruction of justice -- it was just the total accumulation of evidence that said this conduct is inconsistent with the powers that the people expect the President of the United States to exercise. ' -- Sen . William S . Cohen ( R-Me. ) * &quot; We faced what looked_like a Communist monolith with a badly divided country . . . . We divided the Communist bloc . We demonstrated that the Communist world was not a monolith . We then began to play these two ( China and the Soviet_Union ) against each other . We gradually weakened their self-confidence. ' -- former Secretary_of_State Henry A . Kissinger</TEXT>
