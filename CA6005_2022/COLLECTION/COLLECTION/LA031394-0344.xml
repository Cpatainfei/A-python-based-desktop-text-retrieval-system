   <TEXT> Isis Thomas lay cradled in her mother ' s arms in the neonatal intensive care unit at Childrens Hospital , IV lines piercing her tiny arms and stomach and a breathing tube down her throat . Every incubator and crib in the small 10-bed ICU is occupied with babies like Isis -- underweight , underdeveloped infants , many born premature and with several complications . In hospitals around Central Los Angeles , the vast majority of these tiny , sickly infants in neonatal intensive care units are born to economically and socially disadvantaged mothers , many of whom have limited access to or are unaware of the importance of proper prenatal care , doctors say . Although drug_abuse by pregnant women was once among the most common causes of infants in need of critical -- and expensive -- neonatal care , other factors are now becoming more prevalent in cases of severely ill newborns , some of whom will be afflicted with minor problems for most of their lives . And those factors -- most of which are avoidable -- are taking their toll on hospitals , taxpayers and , most important , young lives . An approximate bill to care_for one child for two weeks in a neonatal ICU in a Central Los Angeles hospital runs about $ 21 # 000 , most of which is paid_for by taxpayers because the majority of the parents are poor . While most of the neonatal ICU patients live long and somewhat normal lives , a good portion of them could have avoided ending_up in the intensive care units had their mothers taken proper preventive care that costs thousands less , doctors and advocates say . &quot; There ' s no doubt that if you ' re underprivileged , you ' re going to have a baby with a low birth weight and the chances of your baby going_into ICU are going_to be high , &quot; said Dr. Gabriel Escobar of the Permanente Medical Group Division of Research in Oakland . &quot; But the issues that lead_up to that are not so black_and_white , there are many gray areas. &quot; Isis falls_into one of those gray areas . The baby was born full_term , and doctors found problems while her mother , Clarice Thomas , was pregnant . &quot; They took an ultrasound and found_out that the baby ' s spine was crooked and that I would have to have a ( Cesarean ) section because she would n ' t make_it through the birth_canal , &quot; said Thomas , 39 , of Watts . Four-month-old Isis now suffers from a bad kidney and deformity of her right arm , among other ailments . She must be fed through a tube in her stomach and requires a tracheal tube to breathe , two of several problems that will remain with her for her entire life . Dr. Arnold Platzker , head of neonatology and pediatric pulmonology at Childrens Hospital , said it is uncertain what could have caused so many complications in the baby . It is a rare case , he said . Most infants in neonatal intensive care units are born premature , with birth weights as low as 1 pound , 4 ounces and multiple problems that sometimes continue with them through life , Platzker said . The reasons for prematurity in infants are myriad , doctors say , and are not genetically or ethnically dictated . It is partly attributable to lifestyle , poor diet , youth of mothers , drug_abuse , health_problems such_as diabetes , rare genetic problems and lack of prenatal care . Neighborhood health clinics and agencies face an uphill battle in spreading the word about the necessity of proper care . Ana Bevilacqua , a health_care worker at La Clinica Sunol in East Los Angeles , said the center has a constant flow of more_than 200 women from the community who seek prenatal services , many of whom are illegal immigrants . However , Rodolfo Diaz , executive_director of the Community Health Foundation of East Los Angeles , said it remains difficult getting some illegal immigrants to seek care because some believe that workers will turn them in to authorities . Zola Jones of the Crenshaw-based Great Beginnings for Black Babies said that many of her predominantly African American clients who manage to make their way to one of her agency ' s two locations often bring a deficient history of medical_care with them . &quot; There is more of a lack of knowledge about prenatal providers , &quot; Jones said . &quot; Women , all women , who are without insurance or not accustomed to getting regular medical_care don ' t usually know where to turn. &quot; Great Beginnings ' workers have started going door to door in neighborhoods , canvassing at-risk pregnant women at check-cashing shops and on the streets to get them to seek care . &quot; There are definitely people out there who need to come_in_for help , because the infant_mortality_rate is still too high , &quot; Jones said . &quot; So we ' re trying to get the word out. &quot; One recurrent problem is that mothers who are in pre-term labor often do not go_to the hospital until it is too late to save the baby from serious complications , said Dr. Xylina Bean , a neonatologist and director of the Rosa Parks Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Martin_Luther King.-Drew Medical_Center . Others don ' t seek care until they start showing , or they miss appointments . Neonatologists say even the most basic prenatal care -- which includes proper diet , exercise and taking any necessary medication -- could make a significant difference in a newborn . Behavior_modification is also sometimes necessary to cut_out damaging habits . For example , alcohol and smoking are most detrimental to fetuses , sometimes even more so than drug_abuse , doctors say . Women from poor , low-income households smoke more_than three times as much as those who abuse drugs or alcohol , doctors say , citing reports from the American Lung Assn . and the U.S. Centers_for_Disease_Control . &quot; The issue of drug babies is serious , but tobacco is even more severe , &quot; Escobar said . &quot; This is the major cause of low birth weight in the U.S. The combination of drugs or alcohol , tobacco and lack of access ( to prenatal care ) leads to high-risk indigent babies. &quot; Statistics from the U.S. Centers_for_Disease_Control show that low birth weight ranked as the principal cause of death among African American babies . The department also noted that poverty is largely to blame for higher infant_mortality_rates among blacks , particularly among families who have limited access to medical_care and are not covered by health_insurance . In Central Los Angeles , the infant_mortality_rate for 1992 , the most recent figures available , was 8.9 per 1 # 000 births , compared to 7.8 per 1 # 000 countywide . The infant_mortality_rate is determined by the number of deaths from birth to age 1 . It combines the neonatal rate , which includes babies who die between birth and 28 days , and the post-neonatal rate , which covers deaths between 28 days and 1 year . Bean said a little-known cause of neonatal problems among immigrant mothers is difficulty in acclimating to new environments . The longer they live here , the more they suffer from the medical problems common among Angelenos . &quot; As you begin to take_on the same patterns of behavior as the populations around you , then your risk tends to become the same as that population , &quot; she said . Bean said that although Latinos currently have a low rate of prematurity compared to African Americans , those numbers are likely to increase in future generations without greater access to prenatal care . &quot; Stress ( in poor communities ) has always been put_forward as a major problem in the environment . Just the stress of living in a hostile environment clearly plays a role in producing premature labor , &quot; she said . &quot; But whatever the reason , the numbers of preemies is still high and it taxes our resources. &quot; At Childrens Hospital , County-USC Women ' s Hospital and King-Drew Medical_Center , there is rarely a vacant bed among the 160 in their neonatal intensive care units , where 90 % of the babies are from impoverished families . At King-Drew , for example , of the approximately 9 # 000 babies born each year , about 500 end_up in the neonatal ICU , where they are hooked_up to ventilators , monitors and feeding tubes . As she walked through the neonatal ICU at King-Drew , which opened in June , Bean playfully spoke_to the dozens of infants and remarked on the progress and outcome of each . Only 18 % to 20 % of the babies in the unit are drug-exposed , she said . Many of these tiny , sickly babies are born after just 23 to 26 weeks gestation . They arrive with problems including infections , brain damage and birth_defects . And the price_tag for care is expensive . It costs an average of $ 1 # 500 to $ 2 # 000 a day to care_for children in a neonatal intensive care unit . Full prenatal care_for one mother would cost the same amount , said Diaz , of Community Health Foundation in East L.A. The stays in neonatal ICUs range from three days to five months or longer . Many families , including Thomas and her husband , Prue , have to rely_on Medi-Cal or Medicare to handle the exorbitant costs . The Thomases had no medical insurance during the pregnancy or Isis ' birth and applied for Medi-Cal in December to cover the thousands of dollars it has cost and will cost to care_for their daughter . &quot; The head of the ( neonatal intensive care ) unit said she ' ll be having operations until she ' s 16 , &quot; Clarice Thomas said of her daughter , who has been in the hospital since she was born Oct . 29 . &quot; I appreciate the taxpayers helping care_for her. &quot; Maria Barajas of South-Central relies_on Medi-Cal and low-cost social_service agencies to help cover the cost of doctors ' visits and a leg brace for her son , Rolando , 4 . Rolando was born five months into his mother ' s pregnancy after she had a fall that induced labor . Rolando has trouble moving the right side of his body and was recently diagnosed with cerebral_palsy , Barajas said . With the exception of his leg brace and going_to a special school , Rolando does not have extensive problems that require enormous amounts of medical_care . Once Isis goes_home , she will need care around the clock , plus various medical machinery to keep her alive , Platzker said . Her parents are preparing their house and themselves for her release from the hospital , which is still uncertain . &quot; I hate that she ' s so sick , &quot; Clarice Thomas said . &quot; I knew something was wrong , but I never anticipated it would be this bad . &quot; It hurts because I planned to have this baby , &quot; she said . &quot; I watched my health , went_to the doctor , took my medication , was very careful . But it just seems it couldn ' t have been helped. &quot; Some cases are avoidable , doctors and health experts say . The best way is by increasing preventive education and access to medical and prenatal care . &quot; The portion of the health-care dollar consumed by preventive education programs like prenatal care is inconsequential in comparison to the resources required to care_for a drug-impaired infant , &quot; said Dr. Norman B . Duerbeck , director of maternal-fetal medicine at White Memorial Medical_Center . A report issued in December from the recently defunct National Commission to Prevent Infant_Mortality said prenatal care is essential to solving the problem of neonatal care and infant_mortality . But the issue goes beyond increasing access to prenatal care , said Bean of King-Drew Medical_Center . &quot; Increasing access alone doesn ' t solve the problem , &quot; she said . &quot; It doesn ' t allow you to reach the hard-to-reach , at-risk populations . You have to modify their behavior to how they approach health care. &quot; Reaching these populations means finding ways to make them want to seek health_care , either by bringing it into their housing projects or communities , or developing an incentive_program that would encourage them to visit health clinics . &quot; Neonatal care is a service that is needed and will never go_away , because there are those unavoidable incidents , &quot; Bean added . &quot; And disadvantaged families are always going_to be around as long as there is a division between rich and poor . &quot; But there is a very possible way to reduce the number of disadvantaged infants that become part of the neonatal ICU patient list , &quot; she said , &quot; and we have to move_in that direction soon or else our resources will be worn thin. &quot; On the Cover An infant is hooked_up to a monitor in the Rosa Parks Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Martin_Luther_King Jr.-Drew Medical_Center . Of the 9 # 000 babies born at the hospital each year , 500 end_up in the neonatal ICU . Many of their ailments could have been avoided , experts say . &quot; The issue of why there are premature_babies and why there are_sick babies that are born with multiple problems is not a simple answer , &quot; said Dr. Xylina Bean , a neonatologist . &quot; The important thing is knowing what are the components of the problem and beginning to address each one of those issues. &quot; * IN VOICES : Dr. Xylina Bean , director of the Rosa Parks Neonatal Intensive Care Unit at Martin_Luther King.-Drew Medical_Center , discusses the tremendous need in South-Central Los Angeles for critical care_for premature and very ill babies . 22</TEXT>
