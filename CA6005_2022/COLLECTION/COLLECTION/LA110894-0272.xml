   <HEADLINE> VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW / JACK SEARLES : SIEMENS ' SOLAR-LIGHTING BUSINESS SOLD TO HONG KONG FIRM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Siemens Solar Industries , a Camarillo firm that for years has claimed to be the world ' s leading supplier of solar-energy products , has sold its solar-lighting business to a Hong Kong company that formerly manufactured outdoor lights and other items for Siemens . Terms of the sale weren ' t disclosed , but a Siemens Solar spokeswoman said the Hong Kong firm , Alpan Products Ltd. , has acquired about 10 % of Siemens ' business . Alpan was joined by an unnamed Hong Kong investor in purchasing the rights to manufacture and market Siemens ' solar-lighting products . As part of the deal , Siemens Solar will supply solar_cells that will be used to power Alpan ' s products . Alpan has established a U.S. subsidiary , Alpan Inc. , that will operate the newly acquired unit . The new firm is headquartered on Constitution Avenue in Camarillo . A Siemens Solar representative said no jobs will be lost as a result of the transaction . Siemens Solar is part of the international solar operations of Siemens AG , the German electronics giant . The Camarillo firm has about 325 employees , down from 400 several years ago . The local Siemens unit , which in recent years has upgraded its production systems in an effort to improve profitability , will retain its core business -- the production and worldwide marketing of solar_cells and modules . The ultra-thin units collect the sun ' s energy to power outdoor lights , lanterns , security lighting systems and other consumer items . The units also are used in supplying power to communities worldwide that are not part of traditional grids . Siemens prefers to concentrate_on improving its cells and modules and on developing its solar-power delivery systems , said Siemens spokeswoman Susan Shaw . In the past , Alpan manufactured some of Siemens ' lights and lanterns in factories in Hong Kong , Taiwan , Singapore and other Far East locations . Alpan also markets its own brand of solar-powered lights worldwide . Alpan has hired the managers and other employees of Siemens ' retail products group , including former Siemens sales manager Phil Lerch and former marketing executive Marilyn Palmer . Palmer said she and her co-workers will conduct worldwide marketing and distribution of the former Siemens products from Camarillo . As part of the purchase , the Hong Kong company also acquired a Siemens warehouse in San Fernando , she reported . &quot; Since Alpan already was producing many of Siemens ' products , its factories will simply continue turning them out as they have in the past , &quot; Palmer said . Siemens purchased its Camarillo plant from Atlantic Richfield Co . in 1990 . Less than three years later , Siemens filed a lawsuit charging that Arco had fraudulently misrepresented the operation ' s commercial viability . The lawsuit has not yet been resolved , Shaw said .</TEXT>
