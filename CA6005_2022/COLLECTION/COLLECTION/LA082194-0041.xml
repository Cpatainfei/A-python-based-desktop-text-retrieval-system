   <HEADLINE> MERCHANTS OF VIRTUE ; BY SHIFTING THEIR PARTY ' S LONGTIME FOCUS FROM MONEY TO VALUES A TRIO OF THINKERS HOPES TO WIN_OVER THE AGENDA -- AND THE SOUL -- OF THE GOP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> ON A MISERABLY HOT JUNE AFTERNOON IN WASHINGTON , WHITE_House staffers are putting the final touches_on the President ' s much-hyped but long-delayed plan to &quot; end welfare as we know it. &quot; And Republican operative William Kristol is tending his flock of Clinton opponents with calls to and from Capitol_Hill . Right now Kristol is helping conservative legislators devise ways to deflate the soaring rhetoric that will invariably accompany the plan ' s unveiling . From Kristol ' s vantage , sowing seeds of doubt will require a disciplined plan : President Clinton ' s proposal to put more welfare mothers to work is precisely the kind of folderol the liberal media establishment likes to embrace . Kristol , a 43-year-old former assistant_professor from Harvard , was the brains behind Dan Quayle ' s family values campaign and broadside against Murphy Brown , TV ' s most popular unwed mom . Now , with the Republicans out of power , he ' s had the chutzpah to anoint himself guardian of the party ' s direction . All it took was a $ 1.3-million donation -- including contributions from flush New York investors -- a smart if youthful staff of 10 and a sign_on the door proclaiming &quot; Project for the Republican Future. &quot; Phone in ear , voice in rapid-fire mode , Kristol urges his allies to stick_with a clean line of attack : The President ' s welfare reform is a fraud , he counsels one congressman , better titled &quot; save welfare as we know it. &quot; &quot; If we think that Clinton ' s plan does not end welfare as we know it , that should be the simple message , &quot; Kristol explains between calls , as he describes the difficulties of keeping ambitious legislators focused_on the big picture . &quot; What happens is these guys tend to fall_in_love with their own proposals and hold long press_conferences reminding everyone of their legislation. &quot; Intellectuals such_as Kristol , who are fashioning an updated version of American conservatism , see their key issue as welfare reform -- or , more broadly , reversing course in response to an increasingly violent and isolated underclass . That theme was snatched away by candidate Clinton during the 1992 campaign , but now , in defeat , they want it back . These thinkers insist that the GOP -- adrift since the fall of Communism and the mixed legacy of Reaganomics -- needs to fashion dramatic proposals for the nation ' s social woes that appeal_to reason , not hostility . The words they return to again and again are virtue , citizenship , empowerment . The liberal experiment with the welfare_state has failed , they say ; it has broken families and sapped the spirit of those in poverty . Walk into any of Washington ' s more fashionable conservative think_tanks these days , and you can hear the retro-cons making the case that they , not liberals , are the ones who care about the poor . In their view , the Great Society ' s hopes have dissolved into drug-infested communities full of fatherless children and violent streets taken_over by rootless men . So it ' s compassionate , not heartless , they argue , to end the social-welfare programs that have left_behind such human carnage . Call them retro-conservatives . Like those in the neoconservative movement that preceded them , many retro-cons have traveled across the ideological spectrum from the left . But , taking their cues from an earlier age , they typically want to go even further to dismantle the welfare_state and other government attempts to level the social playing_field . Their mantra is the &quot; little platoon &quot; -- a term coined by 18th-Century British political writer Edmund Burke to describe the loose affiliations that human_beings , left to their own devices , invariably form to take_care of one another . The retro-cons argue that those little platoons -- churches and schools , clubs and charitable associations , even unions and neighborhood activist groups that serve as moral standard-bearers and links to the broader community -- were undermined the minute Americans transferred their functions to the state . When impersonal government bureaucracies began taking responsibility for the care and feeding of the poor , modern Americans no longer needed to translate their idealistic compassion into action . &quot; Compassion is always writ small , or it doesn ' t work , &quot; says leading retro-con William J . Bennett , who recently added a bestseller , &quot; The Book of Virtues , &quot; to a resume that includes education_secretary for Ronald Reagan and drug czar for George_Bush . And &quot; strongly bound communities , fulfilling complex public functions , are not creations of the state , &quot; adds his colleague Charles Murray , whose criticisms of the welfare_state underpin the movement . Unlike mainstream Republicans , the retro-cons believe that federal social programs , ranging from student loans to food_stamps , should be eliminated -- less because they tax our pocketbooks than because they tax our character . &quot; There is a role for government , &quot; says Bennett . &quot; But it has become the place of first resort for every problem . It has created discontent , whining , a habit of dependence . It seems to me we ought to devolve government , get ( its functions ) to the state level , the local level , to communities and non-government entities , and right on to the logical extension -- to the people themselves. &quot; It ' s a jarringly utopian vision of a complex , industrial and increasingly diverse America -- and the retro-cons often seem unable to make all_the pieces fit . They are private-voucher advocates who typically send their own kids to public_school but say poor black kids need to be saved from the state education system . They are worldly Ph.D ' s who don ' t care if gays and lesbians teach their kids , so_long as they don ' t read &quot; Heather Has Two Mommies &quot; in class and don ' t demand civil-rights protection for their jobs . Retro-cons are mostly Jews and Catholics who vociferously defend the Christian right , even though the school prayer that the evangelicals promote won ' t be their own and even though the books some religious extremists want banned are central to the kind of well-rounded education they advocate . The retro-cons derisively criticize the left ' s focus_on the root causes of crime , yet they talk ad nauseam about the social pathologies wrought by the breakdown of the family . They reject immigrant-bashing : Kristol argues that American culture corrupts immigrant families , not the other way around . But in their zest to reverse America ' s cultural slide , they often forget to talk_about its parallel economic slide -- a steady decline in wages , rising multinational competition , a growing disparity between college graduates and high_school dropouts . Their ideas are strangely devoid_of focus_on economic_growth that has made the Republican_Party so successful at the polls for the past two decades . Indeed , when one leading thinker , the Heritage Foundation ' s Stuart Butler , promotes tax cuts , he stresses that they are designed more to enable overworked parents to spend time with their children than to spur the economy . Among these thinkers , Kristol , Bennett and Murray stand_out for their ability to grab the megaphone and influence the debate from Washington : &quot; The Bennett-Kristol-Murray axis is the strongest , most penetrating critique of Clintonism today , &quot; insists James P . Pinkerton , a conservative commentator and former White_House official . &quot; They ' re on to the big crisis , the rot and drift at the heart of American society . that ' s what people are most perplexed about. &quot; Kristol , Bennett and Murray are all alumni of that hotbed of liberal elitism , Harvard . Kristol wore Spiro Agnew sweat shirts on campus , but Murray joined the Peace Corps and Bennett led a teach-in at Hattiesburg , Miss . A Jew from Manhattan , an Iowa-bred Presbyterian who frequents Quaker services and a Catholic from Brooklyn , respectively , all three of these men were academicians first , political players second . But all three seem to get a quiet thrill out of lobbing bombs into the political_arena . They are contrarians with a cause . TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS TRIO IS UPSETTING A delicate balance in the Washington welfare debate , it ' s necessary first to leave the stew of the capital city and drive 60 miles into the lush rolling hills of northern Maryland , through a tiny picturesque town of front-porch swings and brick sidewalks , to the house at the end of Main_Street , where there ' s a tricycle in the dirt driveway , a pond in the back yard and a sign_over Charles Murray ' s office door : &quot; It ' s the government , stupid. &quot; It ' s hard to imagine a spot more suitable for a man once made a social pariah by his writings linking welfare to rising out-of-wedlock birth_rates -- and likely to be ostracized again this fall , when he and a co-author release a book that correlates a variety of social pathologies to low intelligence levels . It ' s also hard to imagine a more gentle figure as social outcast , as even his harshest critics will agree . This day he apologizes for a delayed phone_call , for his fatigued appearance , for cutting the interview short as he prepares to leave for a European vacation . Murray talks with the faux accent of a well-trained stage actor and bears a slight resemblance to &quot; The World According to Garp &quot; co-star John Lithgow . He ' s taller , tanner , more athletically built than suggested by those podium pictures from the endless array of welfare confabs he frequents , usually as the lone provocateur on a panel of liberal social_scientists . Sitting in front of his Quadra 700 computer , he leans_back , entwining his fingers , his gaze fixing on a distant point . As much as any tract , it was &quot; Losing Ground : American Social_Policy 1950-1980 , &quot; Murray ' s 1984 critique of the welfare_state , that drew the earliest broad outlines of the retro-cons ' brand of conservatism . Grover Norquist , president of Americans for Tax Reform , explains Murray ' s influence best : &quot; Murray has created the opportunity for conservatives , free marketers and small government advocates to have the moral high ground . He makes the case that the welfare_state has been destructive of human life . . . . Murray is like Darwin or Freud or Marx . Once ( that kind of thinker emerges ) , your whole analysis of the world shifts. &quot; Right now Murray is trying to provide a shorthand summary of his argument linking welfare checks to the rise in fatherless babies . In &quot; Losing Ground , &quot; he argued that the Great Society ' s buffers against the vagaries of life didn ' t do the poor any favors because they distorted incentive systems . By tracing the decisions of an invented couple , Phyllis and Harold , he attempted to show that after an accidental pregnancy in 1960 , it made rational sense for the pair to marry and for Harold to secure a low-wage job . By 1970 , it made more sense for Phyllis to remain single and collect welfare . This &quot; thought experiment &quot; ( a writing technique that Murray has raised to an art ) prompted much ridicule among advocates of the poor , who derisively reported that they had yet to see teen-age girls calculating their welfare payments before deciding to get pregnant . Numerous social_scientists still dispute the assertion that public assistance encourages unwed pregnancies , noting that illegitimate births have risen even as benefit levels have declined . But Murray insists this is a simplistic understanding of his argument . He starts with the proposition that single mothers with small children are not an economically or socially viable unit . They suffer under enormous rates of poverty ; a wide range of studies have found a higher incidence of crime , drug_abuse , truancy and other problems among fatherless children . Public assistance , he contends , reduces the need for a wage-earning father , and it lets wayward fathers off_the_hook . Taken together , Murray argues , welfare checks , food_stamps and housing subsidies -- an infusion of capital into desperately poor communities -- help reduce the social stigma that once accompanied unwed pregnancy . &quot; If you got_rid_of the welfare system , it would entail such a huge jolt -- to the economics , yes , but also to the milieu in which all these actions take_place . So it would drastically reduce the number of kids born_out of wedlock , &quot; Murray says . &quot; We ' re trying to get the government to stop social engineering among people , &quot; he says , &quot; to let civil society and the play of forces within civil society once again be the determining factors_in how families are formed . Civil society will say very powerfully to children entering adolescence that sexual behavior must be confined within all sorts of penalties and rewards , and it ' s going_to be the same kinds of penalties and rewards that mankind has used since Day 1. &quot; Murray favors a program of phasing_out welfare -- grandfathering those already in the system but saying to future young_men and women : Don ' t expect any help from the government . Pregnant young_women will have to rely_on family , friends and , especially , the father . What about those who get pregnant anyway ? Abortions may rise initially , he acknowledges . He also calls_for easing restrictions on adoptions and says the government should spend lavishly on orphanages for unwanted or neglected children . To critics who accuse him of wanting to break_up families and leave children starving in the streets , he gave a blunt response in a recent TV interview : &quot; Why is it cruel to have a change in a system which will vastly reduce the number of children being born into dreadful situations , dreadful , horrific situations ? &quot; Murray ' s view of the world is largely shaped by six years in Thai villages during the 1960s , first as a Peace Corps volunteer and later as a field worker for a research institute . In writings and interviews , he returns time and again to the stability and harmony of poor Thai communities that survived on a fraction of the income provided by American welfare checks -- and displayed little interest in elaborate government projects . But is it realistic to compare a rural Third_World village to a city neighborhood under pressure from modern economic and social forces ? When it comes_to illegitimacy , for example , don ' t changes in sexual mores have as much to do with unwed mothers as welfare checks ? &quot; Two thoughts on that , &quot; he interjects . &quot; If sexual liberation and sex-drenched TV and movies drive this so powerfully , why is it that rich kids don ' t have babies out of wedlock ? They do have more_than they used to , but they are still at very low levels . ( About 44 % of children born to poor_white women are illegitimate , as opposed to 6 % for white_women above the poverty_line , according to Murray ' s calculations. ) So let ' s take whatever the increase has been among upper-middle-class youngsters and say , OK , there ' s ( the impact of ) your sex-drenched society on illegitimacy . How do you explain the rest over here ? &quot; Murray ' s argument focuses_on this lower-class phenomenon -- out-of-wedlock births -- with nary a mention of the middle- and upper-class trend of high divorce rates . Murray himself is divorced . His first marriage , to a Thai woman and Fulbright scholar , produced two girls ( both landed at Harvard ) . He later married Catherine Cox , the girl-next-door from his Iowa hometown , a professor and old family friend . They have two small children . Murray says he has thought_about studying the social impact of divorce . But , he argues , the repercussions of illegitimacy are more serious . &quot; Divorce is bad for kids , but I think we can live with that problem. &quot; MURRAY ' S CAUTIOUS ACADEMIC DEMEANOR CAN BE misleading : In fact , this Midwestern son of a Maytag employee instinctively understands how to sell his ideas through the media . Like his counterparts in the retro-con troika , he has a flair for drama that appeals_to pundits and to busy politicians in need of quick and vivid ways to pitch their ideas . Murray describes himself as a wishy-washy libertarian who votes Republican only by default . But his welfare arguments are creating some uneasy splits inside the GOP . Ever since the 1970s , when Ronald Reagan took his welfare-queens-in-Cadillacs act_on the road , Republicans have promoted a program of cost cuts , cleaning_out the cheaters and forcing recipients to work . Now , a Democratic White_House is proposing a plan to put most welfare recipients to work after just two years . Meanwhile , Murray ' s followers have shifted the debate further to the right , saying work isn ' t the answer , marriage is . Cost isn ' t the issue , illegitimacy is . Even the liberal establishment has begun fretting that 30 % of births in this country are to unwed mothers . Last year , the influential Atlantic Monthly , a standard-bearer for liberal academia , ran a cover story on the sorry state of fatherless children under the provocative title &quot; Dan Quayle Was Right. &quot; Still , those worries remained background_noise inside the Republican_Party until last October , when Murray used the Wall_Street Journal ' s influential opinion pages to warn that rising illegitimacy rates among poor_whites were leading to the creation of a &quot; white underclass. &quot; &quot; The white underclass will begin to show its face in isolated ways , &quot; Murray ominously wrote . &quot; Look_for certain schools . . . to get a reputation as being unteachable . . . . Talk to the police ; listen for stories about white neighborhoods where the incidence of domestic disputes and casual violence has been shooting_up . . . . &quot; Murray ' s piece did more_than simply remind Capitol_Hill of his arguments linking welfare with births to unwed mothers just as welfare was coming_up for debate . He also single-handedly gave conservatives cover on the race issue . In the past , talk_of illegitimate births has had racial overtones , because rates are three times higher among blacks than whites . But when Murray asserted that policy-makers should be just as worried about rising birth_rates among unmarried poor_white women , the issue became safer to discuss , and the mainstream media leaped to attention . For weeks after it appeared , &quot; The Coming White Underclass &quot; served as column fodder for some of the chattering class ' s most influential commentators -- George F . Will , Charles Krauthammer , U.S. News ' Michael Barone and John Leo , Newsweek ' s Joe Klein . The TV networks also jumped_on the bandwagon , with David Brinkley , Connie Chung and &quot; 20-20 ' s &quot; John Stossel handing the mike to Murray . Buoyed by the intense media attention , Murray , Bennett and Kristol met during Christmas week to discuss how to transform ideas into policy . They concluded that the major Republican welfare legislation now pending in Congress -- a painstaking effort that took the GOP leadership months to produce -- was too timid . So Bennett and his colleague Peter Wehner wrote opinion pieces pushing Murray ' s view for USA Today and 25 major newspapers . Bennett also talked_about welfare reform in speeches and appearances on his good friend Rush Limbaugh ' s show , among others . By early spring , any ambitious legislator looking_around for a way to make a name couldn ' t help but embrace Murray ' s analysis . And two did : Republicans Jan Meyers of Kansas and James M . Talent of Missouri . The Republican bill that most GOP legislators originally backed suddenly had competition . &quot; I ' m definitely getting my right side beaten_in , &quot; moaned Pennsylvania Rep . Rick Santorum , the House ' s lead legislator on the first Republican bill . Talent ' s bill , in particular , was causing headaches for Republican leadership . The 37-year-old freshman member of Congress says he ' s convinced Murray ' s ideas caught_fire for two reasons : They were being pushed by Bennett and Murray rather than harsh right-wing voices such_as Pat Buchanan or Jesse Helms , and they had at least partial endorsement from a Democratic President . &quot; I ' m a great believer that ideas have consequences , &quot; says Talent , who requires his interns to include &quot; Losing Ground &quot; among their library of conservative readings . &quot; And the welfare system defines the values of our nation . . . . ( Welfare recipients ) are not categories , they are real people . And they are a lot smarter making decisions for themselves than you are for them. &quot; As spring wore_on , Bennett threw his weight behind the Talent bill and went_on the attack against Santorum ' s legislation . In April , his think_tank , Empower America , released a memorandum condemning the majority-Republican approach and proposing Murray-like solutions in its place . By mid-June , as the debate intensified and opposition began to mobilize , welfare had become as much Bennett ' s baby as Murray ' s . BENNETT WAS HIMSELF the product of a broken home . He and his brother Robert , now a Democratic lawyer who is defending President Clinton in a sexual_harassment suit , grew_up in Brooklyn , rarely seeing their father except on weekends . Bill was only 5 when his parents divorced , and 46 years later , this man of many words runs_short of them when describing those years . &quot; I don ' t know how it affected ( my life ) , &quot; he says . &quot; All I know is that my brother and me both , we put a big premium on family . We both carve out time , and I think Bob and I want to keep our families close , our marriages together. &quot; Bennett , a potential candidate for the GOP ' s presidential nomination in 1996 and the best-known of the retro-cons , is a big bear of a man who has trouble completing a thought without quoting either a Greek philosopher or a Founding Father . He spent long years in academia -- an undergraduate degree from Williams College , a doctorate in philosophy from the University of Texas , a Harvard law_degree -- and it shows . Bennett ' s enemies describe him as pompous , bombastic , a legend in his own mind . There is certainly a healthy dose of egoism in Bennett ' s character . But two hours into this interview , one has to wonder how much of these trappings are the facade of a slightly insecure but basically warm man -- an exponent of virtue who ' s quick to point_out his own foibles , a family-values crusader who readily pokes_fun at his own parenting of two young sons . The 51-year-old Bennett once played rhythm guitar in a band , and his earliest claim to fame was a blind_date with Janis Joplin , a story that briefly came_back to haunt him when Bush nominated him as drug czar . He remains a ' 50s- ' 60s brand of rock fan , distraught over the &quot; steep moral slide from Bach , and even Buddy Holly , to Guns N ' Roses and 2 Live Crew. &quot; That about sums_up his view of American society as well . In many ways , Bennett ' s theme is a broader one than Murray ' s , but it ' s also one less easily addressed through government policy , for his is the message of cultural decline . &quot; There is a coarseness , a callousness , a cynicism , a banality and a vulgarity to our time , &quot; he said in one speech . &quot; There are just too many signs of de-civilization -- that is , civilization gone rotten. &quot; Bennett documented America ' s decline in one book , the 1993 &quot; Index of Leading Cultural Indicators , &quot; which , like its economic counterpart , used numbers to document the country ' s health . No surprise there : While government spending and the gross_domestic_product have shot_up since 1960 , so have violent crime ( a 560 % increase , by Bennett ' s calculations ) , the rate of illegitimate births ( up 400 % ) , divorces ( up 400 % ) and the teen suicide rate ( up 200 % ) . That was followed by the more uplifting &quot; Book of Virtues , &quot; an 800-page compendium of classic children ' s tales and reading . In this new work , Bennett has done the Republican_Party a huge favor by secularizing the values debate , taking it out of the realm of the Christian right and broadening its appeal -- a significant task after a display of mean-spirited &quot; family values &quot; talk during the 1992 GOP convention left many mainstream followers shaken . It ' s difficult for anyone -- liberal or conservative , religious or not -- to argue with the &quot; virtues &quot; extolled here : friendship , loyalty , compassion , courage , faith , self-discipline , responsibility , honesty and perseverance . The book , he notes in the introduction , is designed for &quot; the moral education &quot; of our young . Explaining that he purposely ignored such modern political issues as abortion and nuclear war , Bennett writes : &quot; Good people -- people of character and moral literacy -- can be conservative , and good people can be liberal. &quot; Bennett makes an effort at a diverse cultural mix , offering such traditional fare as &quot; Jack and the Beanstalk &quot; ( demonstrating the virtue of courage ) alongside a North_American_Indian tale ( honesty ) and Martin_Luther_King Jr. ' s &quot; Letter From a Birmingham City Jail &quot; ( responsibility ) . Indeed , King remains one of Bennett ' s heroes , and while he contends that in the 1990s the federal_government has overstepped its role , Bennett continues to believe it acted properly in clamping_down on segregationist states during the 1960s battles over civil_rights . &quot; You had a situation where people ' s rights were being violated , &quot; says Bennett , who was_active in the civil_rights movement as a teacher at the University of Southern Mississippi . &quot; King said , ' Look , it ' s higher law . . . . ' The genius of King was that he always relied_on mainstream American documents. &quot; Bennett was a Democrat and president of the National Humanities Center in North Carolina when the Reagan_Administration -- at the behest of the Bradley Foundation ' s Michael S . Joyce and Irving Kristol ( father of Bill ) -- came_to call , offering him the chairmanship of the National Endowment for the Humanities . He slipped comfortably into the role of Republican spokesman , changing parties and later using the offices of secretary_of_education and then drug czar as bully pulpits for his conservative causes . Much of the education establishment still reviles him for his attacks on schools and , at the other end of the spectrum , GOP loyalists criticize him for talking a good game without fulfilling some of their key promises . &quot; We don ' t need intellectual arguments to close_down the Department_of_Education , &quot; complains GOP lobbyist David M . Carmen . A number of Republicans also question the virtues of a man who changed his mind about accepting the chairmanship of the Republican National Committee , in part because he didn ' t want to give_up lucrative speaking fees . Bennett insists this was only one factor and notes that he was in a financial bind , having to pay_back the advance on a book he hadn ' t written . Last year , with fellow conservatives Jack Kemp , Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber , Bennett formed Empower America . The idea was to provide fresh thinking for the Republican_Party , but any attempt at innovation got a late start because of bickering between the Kemp and Bennett forces over the think_tank ' s direction and by the disgruntlement of a principal financial backer . The original $ 150 # 000 salaries collected by Bennett and Weber led some GOP-ites to complain that Empower America was &quot; the best-funded speakers ' bureau in Washington. &quot; In some ways , Bennett ' s tendency to speak in grand philosophical sweeps rather than policy details makes him a compelling political figure . &quot; Bill loves novels , and I think he understands that life is a narrative , &quot; says Peter Wehner , Empower America ' s policy director . &quot; that ' s what a lot of political figures can ' t do. &quot; But on specifics , which he ' ll have to address if he makes an admittedly unconventional bid for the GOP presidential nomination , Bennett can be infuriatingly astral . When asked to clearly delineate his view of the federal_government ' s role , Bennett can ' t help himself : He starts with the Federalist Papers . &quot; It ' s No . 3 , right ? &quot; he asks Wehner before moving_on . &quot; John Jay says that security is the first object of government . I think people expect the government to protect their livelihood , their property , their lives . The great drama of the L.A. riots was that people were seeing the fundamental terms of the social_contract up for grabs . People are not supposed to defend their stores and their lives on their own. &quot; Asked to talk_about government spending -- and which parts to eliminate -- Bennett is hard to pin_down : &quot; How do you know when there ' s too_much federal_government ? Through judgment and common_sense . First and foremost is its effect on the character of the people . The test of any regime is what kind of people it produces . . . . &quot; A number of this year ' s GOP congressional candidates have latched onto a Bennett-esque virtues theme . It is , says Jeffrey Bell , author of the book &quot; Populism and Elitism : Politics in the Age of Equality , &quot; a way of filling a void . &quot; Right now the Republican_Party is in sad shape when it comes_to developing an agenda , &quot; he says . &quot; We ' ve decided all it takes is to be non-Clinton to win , which is probably true short-term : We can get_by with no agenda in ' 94 . But congressional elections and presidential elections run_on separate tracks . For all_of Clinton ' s problems , Republicans are not leading Clinton ( in polls ) , especially when Perot is thrown in. &quot; So far , three probable Republican candidates for the 1996 presidential election -- Dole , former Defense_Secretary Dick Cheney , Texas Sen . Phil Gramm -- are mostly ignoring the retro-con message . Former Tennessee Gov . Lamar Alexander has shown some interest , but Kemp has signed_off on some of the ideas while carefully distancing himself from others . The real test of how many voters are drawn to these themes would be a Bennett candidacy in which he tries to reach_out to moderates while holding_on to support within the religious right . The retro-cons ' experience in floating their welfare-reform ideas earlier this year offers other cautions . In the predictable cycles of Washington news , this season ' s genius is likely to become next season ' s exile . So by spring , the town ' s love_affair with Murray ' s ideas was already cooling . Sen . Daniel Patrick Moynihan said Murray ' s prescriptions would provoke &quot; scenes of social trauma such_as we haven ' t known since the cholera epidemic. &quot; A Washington Post editorial attacked Bennett , Kristol and Murray , saying Murray ' s &quot; solution looks an awful lot like giving_up on the problem . It reflects too_much eagerness to take risks with the lives of some of the most vulnerable people in society. &quot; In June , a group of 76 social_scientists signed a statement disputing Murray ' s research . Undaunted , and largely out of the spotlight , however , Bill Kristol , the third leg of the retro-con axis , was speaking_to a less critical audience . HOW DELIGHTFULLY DEVILISH that the conservative movement ' s most skilled assailant on the cultural elite is himself its son . Kristol grew_up on Manhattan ' s West_Side , his father the Trotskyite-turned-neoconservative hero , Irving Kristol , and his mother the prominent Columbia University historian Gertrude Himmelfarb . Kristol once told an interviewer that he grew_up harboring the &quot; typical New York-Jewish view of the world , that people who weren ' t from New York and Jewish were unfortunate : They ate Wonder bread and mayonnaise and had boring existences. &quot; By the time he came_to Washington to serve as Bennett ' s chief_of_staff at Education , his credentials included a Harvard Ph.D. in political_science and teaching experience at both the University of Pennsylvania and Harvard . He caught_on to the political game fast , rigorously adhering to the cardinal rule of successful Washington conservatives : You can bash the liberal media establishment all you want -- as long as you return their phone_calls . While his next boss , Dan Quayle , was hooted in the press , Kristol was hailed as the intellectual who trained the vice_president to quote Plato and the Talmud . Kristol was considered brainy and politically astute enough to informally advise President Bush ' s staff as well . Out of power , his knowing wit continues to play well on the insiders ' talk-show circuit : CNN ' s &quot; Crossfire &quot; and &quot; Inside Politics &quot; and CBS ' &quot; Face the Nation. &quot; Unlike Bennett , Kristol speaks best to a small circle , boiling big thoughts down to a_few words . His winning gimmick , hands_down , has been his series of &quot; private &quot; memoranda on GOP strategy , regularly faxed to Republican leaders and about 300 of Kristol ' s best_friends in the media . Through last spring and summer , Kristol conducted a series of morning synods on the state of the GOP . These 90-minute debate sessions , drawing upward of 200 mostly youthful party followers on busy weekday mornings , transformed Kristol ' s own shop into the hippest hangout in town for the brand of Republican prone to quoting Edmund Burke . But plenty of old-line Republicans continue to grumble about these brazen displays of the party ' s internal splits , while others dismiss the meetings as the &quot; Kristol-for-White-House-chief-of-staff campaign. &quot; Kristol has a reputation for arrogance , which is interesting because he also has a habit of muttering self-deprecating asides in between his fast-paced sentences . Short , with permanently knit eyebrows that give him the aura of a caring rabbi , he is not a man who works well in crowds . He ' s at his best one-on-one , behind-the-scenes , orchestrating rather than pontificating . He clearly relishes the role of contrarian ; his favorite college sport at Harvard was championing Richard Nixon and the Vietnam_War . &quot; Ah , the bombing of Haiphong , the greatest moment in an American modern presidency , &quot; he says with a laugh . Twenty years later , Kristol leads a fairly placid life : long hours at_work , marriage to former classics professor Susan Sheinberg and three small children in Virginia ' s public_schools . If Kristol could put his politics on a bumper sticker , it would read : &quot; The politics of liberty and the sociology of virtue. &quot; &quot; Politically , &quot; he says , &quot; our emphasis should be_on liberty , on cutting_back government . Then the issue of virtue and character can be addressed through ( private ) social and civic institutions. &quot; The liberty and virtue stuff plays well in the pages of conservative journals . But when Kristol talks to Washington , his language is that of raw political strategy . He ' s best known for his lobbying on the health-care debate , using his private-memo network to push the line that &quot; there is no health-care crisis. &quot; He has also used that network to chide Republicans for pursuing an empty &quot; politics of scandal , &quot; focusing_on Clinton ' s personal foibles rather than promoting ideas . And he ' s attempted to carve out a more moderate abortion plank , saying the GOP should rely_on &quot; an extensive and ongoing process of public persuasion &quot; rather than pushing for a federal ban . Yet he unstintingly defends the religious right . &quot; There has to be some education of the so-called Christian right , &quot; he concedes when asked about the group ' s extremists . &quot; But there also has to be education of the people who are intolerant_of the Christian right in the name of tolerance , who don ' t like them because they ' re strange or aren ' t part of the same social class. &quot; He opposes rightist attempts to ban classic literature , but , he asks , &quot; is it a threat to civil_liberties if the citizens in one town foolishly decide they want to remove ' Catcher in the Rye ' from the bookshelves ? &quot; As far as welfare is concerned , Kristol believes that private efforts such_as a teen abstinence support group founded by Bennett ' s wife , Elayne , will reduce births to unwed mothers as much as cutting_off welfare payments . Still , behind the scenes , Kristol has played a crucial role in translating Murray ' s ideas into plans for political action . By the time Tuesday , June 14 , rolls_around -- D-Day for the Clinton welfare plan -- he is ready . IT ' S THE SECOND WEEK OF June , and Kristol is still trying to persuade his allies to set_aside any deep analysis of the welfare_state in favor of giving good quote . His Monday , June 13 , memo to Republican leaders features an eye-catching Moynihan phrase -- &quot; boob bait for the Bubbas &quot; -- to make the argument that Clinton always pulls welfare reform out of the hat when he ' s having trouble in the polls . The next day , the White_House releases its welfare-reform plan , and Kristol helps orchestrate a Capitol_Hill press_conference featuring Bennett and key supporters in the House and Senate . As the cameras roll and the pens scrawl , the bromides fly . &quot; Marginal tinkering. &quot; &quot; An all-too-typical Clinton promise. &quot; &quot; Half joke-half fraud. &quot; By midweek , the Kristol-Bennett media assault is in full force . The media , which pushed the retro-cons ' earlier welfare-reform ideas through the cycle of embrace-reject-forget , now welcome them back -- this time as the necessary , if predictable , voices of opposition in the day ' s debate . Bennett makes the evening news and readies for a round on CNN ' s &quot; Capitol Gang. &quot; Kristol faces_off with a Democrat on CNN ' s &quot; Inside Politics. &quot; Newspapers run excerpts from Kristol ' s &quot; boob bait &quot; memo , while Empower America launches radio ads denouncing Clinton ' s welfare proposal as &quot; cynical and deceptive. &quot; The capper to the weeklong media assault looks_like it will happen Sunday , when Bennett is invited to debate Clinton Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala on CBS ' Sunday morning show &quot; Face the Nation. &quot; The debate never happens . This was to be the week when the nation engaged in a candid discussion about the pernicious effects of government giveaways on the poor , about the importance of enterprise and the dangers of dependence . Instead , a very different view of America ' s moral decay emerges , one that ' s closer to home . On Friday night , as millions of viewers sit tube-side , accused murderer and wife-beater O.J. Simpson takes a fleet of police_cars on a tour of the L.A. freeway system . Along the way , fans cheer him as if he were back at USC , sweeping through the Bruin defense on an 80-yard touchdown run . Does anyone need a more potent vision of cultural decline ? This may be the decade of consensus that the welfare_state isn ' t working , even , perhaps , that it undermines a sense of personal responsibility . But it ' s also the decade of Damian Monroe Williams , acquitted of attempted murder for beating truck_driver Reginald Denny ; of the Menendez brothers , portrayed as the victims of the parents they brutally murdered ; of Tonya Harding , rewarded with celebrity status and a movie deal for her involvement in an assault on a competitor . You don ' t need to be Lou Harris to understand that Americans are deeply troubled by the state of their society . They tell each other , and the pollsters , that they are more troubled by the nation ' s moral climate than its economic strains . But are these Americans concerned about the fatherless children in the ghettos or the fatherless children of divorce in their own neighborhoods ? Or both ? Are they more worried about sex education in the schools or Madonna grabbing her crotch on MTV ? Do Americans really buy the argument that chopping government off at the knees will lead to national spiritual renewal , a fresh sense of personal responsibility ? &quot; People are hungering for some sort of moral order , &quot; says conservative writer Pinkerton . &quot; On the other hand , people don ' t like to be lectured to. &quot; Especially by politicians . When the sun rises that Sunday morning , Bennett does make an appearance on &quot; Face the Nation , &quot; but by then the subject has shifted from welfare to the Simpson case and the public ' s reaction . Americans , Bennett suggests , are confusing &quot; real heroism with celebrity. &quot; Five days later , Bennett tells Larry King ' s CNN audience that the Simpson episode suggests America is witnessing an &quot; escape_from the idea of personal responsibility , which is not only at the heart of our law , our criminal justice system , it ' s at the heart of our civilization. &quot; &quot; What afflicts us , &quot; Bennett recently lectured , &quot; is a corruption of the heart , a turning_away in the soul . Our aspirations , our affections and our desires are turned toward the wrong things . And only when we turn them toward the right things -- toward enduring , noble , spiritual things -- will things get better. &quot; The retro-cons have convinced themselves that cutting government and encouraging Burke ' s &quot; little platoons &quot; will help return our aspirations to things enduring and noble . Retro-con Michael Joyce , president and CEO of Milwaukee ' s Bradley Foundation , argues that Americans &quot; are eager to seize control of their lives . . . to assume once again the status of proud , independent , self-governing citizens intended for them by the Founding Fathers. &quot; that ' s a big leap back from the 1990s welfare_state . Now all_the retro-cons have to do is convince a public that is angrily cynical about American government -- but also avidly addicted to its inherent promise to make life for all just a little bit better. ; ;</TEXT>
