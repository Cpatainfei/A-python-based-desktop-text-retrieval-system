   <HEADLINE> COMMITMENTS ; TILL ' DEATH WISH ' DO US PART ; WHEN THIS COUPLE SAID ' I DO , ' THEY DIDN ' T PROMISE TO LIKE THE SAME FILMS . IT HAS TO DO WITH ' GIRL MOVIES ' AND ' BOY MOVIES. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The other night , my wife suggested we see &quot; The Piano. &quot; Now that sounds like a lot of fun : two hours of watching Holly Hunter saying nothing . Sorry , not even the presence of Harvey Keitel -- one of my favorite movie thugs -- could get me off the couch for that . I think my wife was just testing me , to see if my knuckles still scrape the ground when I walk . After years of disagreement over whose choice will prevail , Robin and I have concluded that we suffer from what we call Boys ' Movie-Girls ' Movie Syndrome . I know it sounds like a cliche , but that ' s just the way it is : I like mindless action ; she prefers gauzy sentimentality . Robin ' s a pushover for the period_piece , with a musical_score as lush as Hawaii and major redemption in the end for extremely Angst -ridden characters . An extra &quot; thumbs up &quot; if it was produced before Sputnik . I ' m a sucker for squealing tires , spent shell casings , and guys who are long on attitude but short on the verbal ability to express it . She loves to razz me about my &quot; buddies , &quot; as she calls them : Charles Bronson , James Coburn , Lee Marvin , Chuck Norris , Arnold Schwarzenegger -- that crowd . So what ' s her problem ? Here ' s a woman who ' s trying to convince our young son that &quot; Camelot &quot; is a war movie , when anybody knows it isn ' t a war movie unless Sylvester Stallone wastes everything in his path searching for POWs in the jungle . Robin ' s ideal movie is long and boring and frilly and subtitled and who needs it and please , wake me when it ' s over . In the checkout line at our local video store , there she ' ll be with stuff like &quot; A Room With a View , &quot; &quot; The Age of Innocence &quot; and &quot; The Remains of the Day. &quot; But I ' ll be right behind her with &quot; Out for Justice , &quot; &quot; Death Wish II &quot; and &quot; Missing in Action III. &quot; And she has the nerve to complain about my taste ? This is a woman who : * Adores movies only with costumes from the_French Renaissance , Victorian era or the mid-1950s ( which pretty much rules_out cowboy_hats , loincloths and anything that clanks when you walk ) . * Raves over cinematography that makes every scene look as if it were shot through a heavy glaze of Vaseline ( but can ' t quite appreciate the same effect in &quot; Emmanuelle &quot; ) . * Swoons over any musical with Fred and Ginger , Gene Kelly -- even John Travolta ( yet doesn ' t share my enthusiasm for guys in togas blaring trumpets ) . Would you trust the judgment of a woman who once passed_on tickets to a Redskins-Cowboys game at RFK to watch &quot; The Nutcracker &quot; on PBS ? Sheesh . As long as we ' re on the subject of taste , what can you say about somebody who won ' t miss an episode of &quot; All My Children &quot; and thinks it ' s a travesty that Susan Lucci hasn ' t won an Emmy ? Who gets weepy over phone_company commercials ? It wasn ' t always this way . During our courtship , I willingly accompanied Robin to see films with an appeal_to the intelligentsia , offbeat flicks such_as &quot; Diva &quot; and &quot; The Gods Must Be Crazy. &quot; By the time we got_married , Robin probably believed that she was gaining a life partner whose taste in film was every bit as refined as her own . Ha ! Fooled her ! She thought she was getting Gene Siskel , but she wound_up with Snuffy Smith . We still haven ' t fully resolved our differences in this department . We ' ve discussed going our separate ways at the multiplex , but mostly we enrich the local video store by checking out two movies instead of one : something froufrou for her , something a bit more basic for my caveman instincts . I try to tell her that maybe some of us brutes embrace the lowbrow because we were force-fed the highbrow when we were too young . Like so many George_Bushes who gleefully abandoned the broccoli of childhood for the pork rinds of adulthood , maybe we just hunger for the lowest common_denominator in movie fare . Sometimes our tastes miraculously converge and she actually likes something I recommended . It ' s happened with &quot; Unforgiven , &quot; &quot; In the Line_of_Fire &quot; and &quot; The Fugitive &quot; -- all chock-full of my buddies . When the film credits roll , she turns_to me and whispers : &quot; Honey , I liked that . Really. &quot; Maybe there ' s hope for her after all . I suppose , in the spirit of marital harmony , I ought to give &quot; The Piano &quot; a chance . My buddies will just have to understand .</TEXT>
