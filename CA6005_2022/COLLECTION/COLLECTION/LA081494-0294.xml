   <HEADLINE> N . KOREAN SEES NEW ERA IN U.S. RELATIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A senior North_Korean official said Saturday that a nuclear accord between North_Korea and the United States will help forge a new era of normal relations between the two countries by establishing a basis for enhanced &quot; trust and confidence &quot; on nuclear issues and other matters . In a rare interview , Deputy Foreign Minister Kang Sok Ju , the chief North_Korean negotiator on nuclear matters , hailed the two-page statement of understanding approved by the U.S. and North_Korean governments as an expression of &quot; our clear intentions to resolve our nuclear issue. &quot; The deal calls_for Washington to arrange for construction of several Western-style nuclear_reactors in North_Korea and to move toward establishing normal diplomatic relations . In return , it commits North_Korea to halting its production of plutonium for possible use in nuclear arms , and eventually to halting work_on several reactors that are considered tailor-made for plutonium production . Kang declined to express confidence that all unresolved disputes can be settled , but he said all would be addressed in discussions with U.S. technical experts . Assistant Secretary_of_State Robert L . Gallucci , who spoke at a news_conference at 2 a.m. Saturday , agreed that the talks had reduced suspicion about the likelihood of progress . He said the level of trust between the delegations was &quot; higher than it was before this round of talks &quot; and called the accord an important &quot; first_step &quot; toward a broader nuclear agreement . Further negotiations are scheduled in Geneva on Sept . 23 on the interim energy alternatives North_Korea has been promised , establishing liaison offices in Washington and Pyongyang as a first_step to full mutual recognition , final disposal of about 8 # 000 spent nuclear fuel rods now corroding in a cooling pond north of Pyongyang , and providing the new reactors . To avoid hefty costs to the U.S. taxpayer , Gallucci is trying to arrange for Germany and Japan , and perhaps South_Korea , to pay most of the cost of the new reactors , which would be provided by South_Korea or Russia . The United States would supply technical experts .</TEXT>
