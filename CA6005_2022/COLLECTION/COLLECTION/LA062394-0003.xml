   <TEXT> U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation ( FAO ) figures show that Reggiana cattle , the traditional dairy breed in the Parmesan cheese-producing region of Reggio-Emilia , are among 53 breeds of livestock in risk of dying_out in Italy as agricultural production methods change . A spokesman for the consortium of Parmesan producers has acknowledged that there are only 1 # 400 Reggianas left , despite efforts by farmers to increase their numbers . The reduction has been under way since World_War_II , the spokesman explained . &quot; Today one uses Dutch cows of Canadian stock which produce much more milk , but the quality of Parmesan has not suffered , &quot; he claimed . &quot; It is compatible with that produced from the Reggiana. &quot; Angelo Paracucchi , one of Italy ' s best known chefs , disagreed . &quot; It can ' t be identical if one has gone from cows producing 20 litres a day to 60 litres a day . This means that one has a less fatty milk with all_the consequences that follow , including a more watered-down cheese. &quot; Also said to be threatened is the quality of Italian prosciutto now that the Romagnolo pig also has become very rare , with only nine of them alive last year . The consortium of prosciutto producers has played_down these declines , saying they reflected changes in taste : &quot; Consumers are gearing their demand to less fatty foods. &quot; The Lite of the Milky Way Milky Way , the malted milk and caramel chocolate_bar , went reduced-calorie a_couple_of years ago with the Milky Way II . Now -- reformulated with polydextrose and a triglyceride called caprenin for texture -- there ' s an even lower-calorie version . Containing only 160 calories and half as much fat as most chocolate_bars , Milky Way Lite is the first candy_bar to meet the FDA ' s Nutritional Labeling and Education Act regulations so that it can legally call itself Lite . Oh , yeah -- another technique for reducing calories was making_it only five ounces . Apparently dieters confided that they ' d have a better chance with a smaller bar . The King of the Jungle Bar In essentially unrelated chocolate news , tomorrow Nestle ' s issues a special edition chocolate_bar molded with scenes from the Disney cartoon &quot; The Lion King. &quot; You won ' t be able to miss it , with its jungle label and gold_foil wrapping .
