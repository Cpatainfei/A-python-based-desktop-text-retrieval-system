   <HEADLINE> SELLING INNER CHINA ON THE SATELLITE AGE ; TELECOMMUNICATIONS : U.S. FIRMS PITCH PHONE_SYSTEM FOR REMOTE VILLAGERS IN THE NATION ' S INTERIOR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For Herdsman Ma , deep in the great Chinese outback , the telephone is something newfangled that his village and hundreds of others have never seen . But if some ambitious U.S. companies get their way , Ma and isolated villagers like him may soon be using the &quot; electric talk &quot; -- the literal translation for a phone . A vast remote network is now possible via a constellation of low-orbit satellites tied into the world ' s most advanced telecommunications . Proponents of the Iridium , Globalstar and Teledesic and satellite systems still on the drawing board are eyeing China ' s phoneless interior as perfect for their technologies . &quot; Remote villages that have never had telephones could set_up Globalstar satellite phone_booths for just $ 1 # 500 to $ 2 # 500 each , &quot; executive Anthony Navarra said at a Beijing forum where he pitched Globalstar to 200 telecom officials . He said hand-held mobile telephones using the same technology would give reliable voice and computer data service anywhere in China -- whether from a bustling Shanghai street or the desolate oil fields of the Taklimakan desert . China ' s drive to leapfrog out of the communications dark ages with massive investment in top technologies has triggered an invasion of Beijing by the world ' s telecom executives . Although the telephone penetration rate has tripled to 2.15 % from just 0.7 % in 1988 , this still amounts to fewer than 40 million phones for 1.2 billion people -- one of the lowest_densities in the world . Fearing that poor communications could cripple economic_growth , China is spending $ 6.2 billion this year alone in its quest to have 140 million phones by 2004 . At least $ 7 billion in foreign capital will be used this decade . Satellite mobile phone_systems are seen as a sensible alternative to the huge expense of laying fiber optic or even copper cable to the remote interior . They also could help quench the voracious appetite for communications in China ' s cities , where cellular_phones have tripled in two years to 400 # 000 . But the Communist government , citing national security concerns , insists on total control over China ' s telecommunications and has barred foreign ownership or management in its network . The trick for Globalstar and other foreign providers is to persuade Beijing it will not sacrifice its sovereignty by granting them access to the explosive telecommunications market . &quot; Globalstar . . . can provide low-cost , advanced telecommunications services to the whole nation while affording the Chinese government full control of the network inside China , &quot; Navarra told the Beijing forum . The technologies are breathtaking in a country where until only a_few years ago , home telephones were out_of_reach for all but the Communist_Party elite . As early as 1998 , a pocket-sized Globalstar mobile phone or fixed &quot; village satphone &quot; could digitize Herdsman Ma ' s words and beam them from a tiny antenna to any of 48 Globalstar satellites orbiting 450 miles overhead .</TEXT>
