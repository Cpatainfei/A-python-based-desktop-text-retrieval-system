   <HEADLINE> U.S. TROOP SAFETY A KEY CONCERN IN RWANDA MISSION ; AFRICA : DESPITE POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENCE , AID EFFORT HAS RUN SMOOTHLY . OFFICIALS HOPE TO AVOID ANOTHER SOMALIA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S. Army Lt . Gen . Daniel Schroeder , a ramrod-straight soldier with a closely shaved head and a razor-sharp manner , paused only once in his rapid-fire answers to a gaggle of reporters at a recent briefing here . Schroeder , head of the task_force running Operation Support Hope , the U.S. attempt to alleviate the suffering of more_than 1 million Rwandan refugees , said he was considering using an American truck company to transport food and refugees in Rwanda . &quot; The thing that concerns us is the security issue , &quot; he said . Then came the one pause : &quot; It ' s the unknown . It ' s the uncertainty. &quot; So far , in its first few days , the U.S. operation in Zaire and Rwanda has encountered many daunting problems , but American soldiers at least have been spared the experience of their comrades in Somalia last year : being shot at by the people they were trying to help . Yet the potential for trouble remains high in the consciousness of U.S. officials in Africa and in Washington . They point to two major worries : the troops , 20 # 000 to 40 # 000 strong , who remain loyal to the losing Hutu side of the Rwandan civil_war and who might try to interfere with U.S. aid efforts ; and the victorious Tutsi minority , who might want to exact revenge on Hutu refugees returning to Rwanda from Zaire . By most reliable accounts , Rwanda has been peaceful -- partly because much of it is almost deserted -- since the army of the former Hutu-dominated government fled across the border to Zaire two weeks ago , urging or pushing much of the terrified population to flee with it . But no one knows if the peace will last . The legacy of ethnic massacres and bloodletting may_not be simple to erase . Driven from their country by the forces of the victorious Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front ( RPF ) , the Hutu troops remain just across the border in Zaire . Thousands are camped for miles along the road that runs west from the border , and paymasters handed_out thick wads of cash to the uniformed troops on a recent afternoon . Estimates of both the army ' s size and its strength vary , because many tossed down their weapons when they crossed the border . Others , however , kept their guns . The International Committee of the Red_Cross has refused to assist the Rwandan soldiers , except the wounded , until they are disarmed and put_in camps as military detainees , as required under the Geneva_Convention . Hutu leaders , however , have vowed to keep their forces intact and to lead them back one day to renew the fight against the Tutsis . During the civil_war , many of those troops carried_out horrific massacres of both Tutsis and of Hutus accused of collaborating with the Tutsis . Hutu government forces also murdered and then skinned the bodies of 10 Belgian peacekeepers during the war ' s early days . So far , the Hutu soldiers have not tried to interfere with U.S. or international aid efforts , but if they begin to do so , the American presence could rapidly become more dangerous . &quot; As long as they retain their weapons , you have a problem , &quot; said Shawn Messick , a Pentagon special operations officer who arrived here recently . &quot; It ' s part of our operating environment here. &quot; The most immediate source of potential conflict centers_on efforts by the United States , the United Nations and private relief agencies to encourage refugees to return home to Rwanda . The Hutu leadership opposes that and has tried actively to keep the refugees in Zaire , leading to concerns that if the repatriation effort becomes more successful , the Hutus might try to thwart it by force . In the past , the Hutus have received aid from the government of Zaire . U.S. officials have tried to exert what influence they can on Zaire to ensure that the aid does not continue and have received assurances that it will not . But given the notorious corruption of Zaire ' s government , officials concede they cannot be sure those assurances will stick . Persuading the refugees to return will , of course , depend in part on the behavior of the civil_war ' s winning side . The new Rwandan government has promised not to exact reprisals against returning refugees , but scattered reports indicate some reprisals already have begun . That , in turn , raises the question of what , if anything , U.S. forces will do if civilians in Rwanda once again come under_attack . U.S. officials insist that whatever happens , American troops will not take_part in efforts to protect Rwandan civilians . That , officials say , will be up_to a separate U.N. peacekeeping force . If the violence escalates , however , the arm ' s-length stance of the U.S. force could be increasingly uncomfortable . As they await the day , still some weeks away , on which the U.N. force becomes fully operational , U.S. officials concede that much depends_on the goodwill of the new government . For all that , experienced relief workers argue that the situation in Rwanda differs greatly from the one in Somalia . Indeed , some fear that the American public drew the wrong lesson from Somalia . The U.S. military saved lives in that country , the relief workers note . The problem was , they also tried to quickly refashion a country of powerful ethnic clans into a multi-party democracy . And &quot; mission creep &quot; meant the rules and the goals were constantly changing . &quot; The difference is , this is a genuine humanitarian operation with no political or military implications , &quot; said Steffan de Mistura , U.N. Children ' s Fund representative in Somalia . &quot; I don ' t think we are going_to have ' mission creep , ' &quot; Messick said . &quot; We didn ' t come_in with a blank slate , like we did_in Somalia , saying ' Do good. ' We came_in with very specific tasks , and that ' s what we ' re going to do. &quot; For now , officials say security for U.S. troops is a concern , but not a problem . The troops inside Rwanda have been given orders not to leave the airport where they are based . The 98 troops now in Goma live_in tents next to a crowded road with no protection other_than a roll of concertina wire . Most of the soldiers go unarmed , and none wear flak vests or other combat gear . If problems do develop , officials say , the U.S. troops are prepared to defend themselves . &quot; that ' s why you send_in the U.S. military , not the Peace Corps , &quot; National Security Adviser Anthony Lake said at a recent White_House meeting . Drogin reported from Goma and Lauter from Washington . * GENOCIDE TRIBUNAL SOUGHT : Rwanda ' s new leaders call_for trials against Hutu officials . A6</TEXT>
