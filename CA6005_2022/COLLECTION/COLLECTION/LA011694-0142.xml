   <HEADLINE> TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS : BACK TO THE FUTURE : RECENT TRADE ACCORDS ALMOST HAPPENED IN 1950</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Anyone following the GATT negotiations late last year had to relish the last-minute suspense -- particularly in the Franco-American battle for the hearts and minds of European movie fans . Much of the hubbub would have been unnecessary , had we acted decisively nearly 50 years ago . In the summer of 1941 , President Franklin D . Roosevelt and British Prime_Minister Winston Churchill met aboard a U.S. destroyer in the North Atlantic to discuss the conduct of the world_war . The leaders ' final communique -- the Atlantic Charter -- conveyed their belief that , whatever the war ' s outcome , any future world order must prevent recurrences of the currency devaluations and beggar-thy-neighbor trade_policies that had so deepened the world Depression and led in no small part to the cataclysm they were then seeking to overcome . &quot; ( We ) will endeavor , &quot; it said , &quot; to further the enjoyment by all states , great or small , victor or vanquished , of access on equal terms to the trade and to the raw_materials of the world. &quot; Soon after the war ' s end , institutions were created to give the world a new economic order : the United Nations with its International Monetary Fund and World_Bank , and the Marshall Plan , among others . American diplomats next set_out to complete the missing link by negotiating an international agreement that would liberalize world trade . In 1948 , some 54 nations signed the Havana Charter , which was to govern a new International Trade Organization ( ITO ) . The charter established three key principles that are still with us today : non-discriminatory treatment of all parties , a commitment to reducing tariffs and other trade_barriers and elimination of all import quotas , except under emergency conditions . But the charter ' s significance was deeper : It addressed many of the thorniest issues that would haunt trade talks for the next 45 years . Among other things , it forbade discriminatory taxation and regulated state monopolies . It limited the use of domestic-content requirements and other non-tariff barriers and administrative procedures employed by states to circumvent their commitments to open borders . It also prohibited restrictive business practices and cartels that could serve as private controls over competition . It regulated the use of public subsidies and countermeasures , such_as anti-dumping procedures . Finally , the charter called_for rules against double taxation , protected the owners of patents and other &quot; intangible &quot; assets , promoted the elimination of unfair labor practices and provided foreign investors guarantees of fair and reasonable treatment . The charter ' s provisions applied equally to goods and services . Article 19 , for example , allowed member countries to maintain &quot; screen quotas &quot; for domestic movies , but specified that the quotas were &quot; subject_to negotiation &quot; -- obligating the countries to reduce them over time . As Clair Wilcox , head of the U.S. delegation , put it : &quot; Other nations are using 17 kinds of discrimination against American films . We got them down to one , and it is negotiable ! &quot; Under that provision , quotas limiting European viewers ' access to U.S.-made films and television programming might have been reduced to insignificance long ago . Yet , late in December , 1950 , the Truman Administration -- preoccupied with the Korean conflict -- let it be known that the Havana Charter would not be submitted to Congress . * Why did_it fail ? Many business_organizations were opposed to greater government intervention in markets . Liberals thought the treaty was too weak ; conservatives saw it as a threat to national sovereignty . Republican gains in the 1950 congressional elections strengthened those who favored greater reliance on tariffs and protection of U.S. industry . And Southern Democrats , traditionally supporters of free_trade , were changing their views_as manufacturing expanded in the South . For the next 43 years , each of the seven successive negotiating rounds of the GATT -- initially established as a stopgap forum for discussing tariff reductions only -- has had to tackle the issues left on the table at Havana . What can we conclude from this experience ? First , the specter of lost national sovereignty , which played such a critical role in defeating the ITO , is less relevant today . NAFTA , bilateral discussions with Japan and the growth of regional markets have made_it legitimate for governments to seek concessions regarding each others ' tax and fiscal_policies , labor and wage practices and environmental concerns . Second , as regional blocs have gained scope and importance , they have served as testing grounds for new rules about complex issues -- for example , the rules on reciprocity in financial services within NAFTA . These can then be extended on a multilateral basis . Third , appropriate dispute-resolution procedures are critical . In a rule-based system , interpretation and enforcement must go hand in_hand with rule-making . The GATT ' s caseload increased enormously in the 1980s , to 120 cases , versus 90 in its first 32 years . Yet its adjudication powers remain so primitive that many cases were not resolved -- or , worse , its findings were ignored . So , while there is much to complain about regarding what did not get done_in Geneva in December , there is much for which to be thankful . We are slowly reconstructing the edifice we tore_down in 1950 . Who knows ? Maybe the old wording of Article 19 can be revived . Bring on the script doctors !</TEXT>
