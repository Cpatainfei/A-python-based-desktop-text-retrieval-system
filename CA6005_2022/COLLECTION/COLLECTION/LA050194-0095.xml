   <HEADLINE> BACKPACK &amp; BUDGET ; RUSSIAN HOSTELS AT FRIENDLY PRICES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Now that Russia has opened its doors more widely to the West , tourists can find a variety of ways to explore this vast country . And although the economic situation changes day by day and prices are rising , the price for a &quot; backpacker ' s bed &quot; in St . Petersburg this summer has actually dropped . St . Petersburg ' s Western-style &quot; Russian Youth_Hostel &quot; was opened in 1992 by Steven Caron , an American who , while studying at Oxford , England , traveled_to Moscow and developed the idea with some Russian friends . Finding a suitable building was a challenge . The group eventually obtained a five-story 18th-Century building that had been used by a trade_school as a dormitory for visiting professors . After completely renovating it , they could accommodate up_to 60 travelers in rooms with three , four or five beds . This year they have opened_up a fourth floor with dormitory beds ; now 80 travelers can be housed . Because a second independent hostel has opened and created a little competition , the nightly rate has been dropped from $ 16 to $ 15 ( breakfast included. ) The Russian Youth_Hostel ( RYH ) is centrally located at 3rd Sovetskaya Ulitsa , 28 ( also known as 3rd Rozhedstvenskaya Ulitsa , 28 ) ; from the U.S. , telephone 011- 7-812-277-0569 . It ' s wise_to make reservations several weeks before you go_by contacting Russian Youth_Hostels &amp; Tourism , 409 N . Pacific Coast Highway , Building 106 , Suite 390 , Redondo Beach 90277 ; tel . ( 310 ) 379-4316 , and fax ( 310 ) 379-8420 . This office can also help with visa arrangements and booking the Trans-Siberian train ( the fares for the 6 1 / 2-day journey are $ 275 for second_class and $ 400 for first class. ) The average traveler at RYH is 22 to 30 years old . Most take a day train to St . Petersburg from Helsinki , Finland . Those who have Eurail passes will find them good as far as the Russian border ; to complete the journey will cost an additional $ 40 . If you travel via Finland you can make a reservation for RYH at Eurohostel , Linnankatu 9 , SF-00160 Helsinki ; tel . 011-358-0- 66-44-52 . If you wait until you are in Europe to get your Russian visa , Finland is the best place to do so . Keep_in mind the faster you need it , the more it will cost . Many backpackers also arrive in St . Petersburg from Tallinn , Estonia , via night train for about $ 20 . Reservations for RYH can be made at Estonian YHA Liivalaia 2 , EE0001 , Tallinn ; tel . 011-3-72- 2-44-1096 . If you don ' t already have a Russian visa , ask their advice . The lineups at the Russian embassies in Baltic countries can be incredibly long and special arrangements sometimes need to be made by visitors from Western countries . The RYH staff has found that the average backpacker stays in St . Petersburg for four or five days and then moves_on to Moscow . This year the overnight second-class train_fare for foreigners between St . Petersburg and Moscow has jumped from $ 10 to $ 30 . First-class fares are now $ 50 . Western-style budget accommodations are available in Moscow for $ 12 per night in four-bedded rooms at the Moscow International Guest House , a 10-minute walk from the Prospect Mira metro station at Bolshaya Pereyaslavskaya Ulitsa 50 , Floor 10 , tel . 011-7- 095-971-4059 , fax 011-7-095- 280-7686 . This guest house has an English-speaking staff , a television lounge , kitchen and laundry facilities . Reservations can be made through RYH . The most current guidebook available , and the one most highly recommended by the RYH staff , is &quot; Russia Through the Back_Door &quot; by Ian Watson . A new , expanded 126-page edition will be available Wednesday . The information for this edition was researched early this year . It includes information on the Baltic countries and travel on the Trans-Siberian trains . Copies are available for $ 5.95 from Europe Through the Back_Door , Box C-2009 , 109 Fourth St . North , Edmonds , Wash . 98020 ; tel . ( 206 ) 771-8303 .</TEXT>
