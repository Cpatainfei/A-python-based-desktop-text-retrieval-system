   <HEADLINE> THE HEALTH TRAVELER : CONSIDER WHAT ' S ON_TAP AWAY FROM HOME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Think before you drink the water , especially in developing countries , and you boost the chances of returning home healthy . Dirty water can lead to traveler ' s diarrhea , giardiasis ( infection of the small_intestine ) and a host of other diseases . The best plan ? Maintain a healthy skepticism about the quality of drinking_water as you travel . And before departing , try to find_out the quality of the water_supply at your destination and if preventive measures are necessary . Know when it ' s best to bypass water and choose other beverages . Just in case , learn the best disinfection techniques . &quot; Places with poor sanitation services are more likely to have poor drinking_water , &quot; said Eric Rodenburg of the World Resources Institute , an environmental policy research organization in Washington , D.C. Small cities , towns and rural_areas are more likely to have unpure water than major cities . Those generalities aside , the danger of water-borne disease is widespread , said Dr. James Runnels , who heads the Baylor Travel Medicine Service at Baylor College of Medicine , Houston . &quot; Southeast_Asia , South_America , Central_America and parts of Africa all pose significant risk of water-borne illness , &quot; he said . &quot; The United States , Canada , Western Europe and Australia , by and large , are considered as safe as possible. &quot; * Pack an anti-diarrheal medicine , suggested Runnels , and ask your doctor if taking along prescription antibiotics is advisable , in case of contact with contaminated drinking_water . Depending_on destination , the doctor may suggest a preventive dose of immune globulin ( formerly called gamma_globulin ) to protect against hepatitis_A , which can be contracted through contaminated water , ice or foods . ( Although not yet available , two U.S. companies have developed hepatitis_A vaccines and are currently awaiting federal approval to market. ) Additional information on food and water precautions during foreign travel is available by telephone or fax from the federal Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention ' s international traveler ' s hot_line , ( 404 ) 332-4559 . If specific information about water at a destination isn ' t available , consider the drinking_water unsafe , said Fred Reiff , regional adviser on water quality for the World_Health_Organization / Pan American Health Organization in Washington . Reiff said he never travels without a water test kit and disinfection supplies . If water purity is questionable , choose hot coffee , hot tea , beer , wine or canned or bottled carbonated beverages . Drinking directly from a can or bottle is safer than transferring the beverage to a glass that could be contaminated , according to the CDC . Be sure to dry wet cans or bottles before drinking and to wipe clean the area of the container that will come_in contact with the mouth . Don ' t brush teeth with tap_water if there is any chance it is contaminated . While this is only practical for travelers staying in suites or , perhaps , rented homes or apartments , CDC experts consider boiling to be the most reliable method for making_water safe for drinking . Bring the water to a vigorous boil and continue boiling for 10 minutes . Allow it to cool to room_temperature and do not add ice , which could also be contaminated . Store the water in a covered and sterilized container to avoid recontamination . Boil water the evening before you need it , Runnels suggested , and then cover it overnight so it will cool and be ready for drinking the next morning . To improve the taste , add a pinch of salt to each quart . Chemical disinfection is another alternative . CDC recommends using 2 % tincture_of_iodine or disinfection tablets -- both sold at sporting goods stores . Use five drops of tincture per quart or liter , if water is clear , and 10 drops if water is cold or cloudy . To treat with the tablets , follow manufacturer ' s instructions , doubling the number of tablets if the water is cloudy . Increasing the recommended disinfection time is another way to increase purity . * Another option -- portable water filtration devices -- are promoted by manufacturers as the easy way to purify water . But even though some kill and remove many microorganisms , CDC experts do not recommend this method , noting a lack of what they consider to be valid scientific evidence in support of such claims . The systems work better on filtering bacteria than viruses , Runnels said . &quot; Even the best portable water_filter devices are not adequate_to filter viruses , &quot; he said . While the devices may be good for a camper concerned only about filtering_out the parasite responsible_for giardiasis infection , the filters should not be relied_upon to filter_out the viruses that cause such diseases as hepatitis . When should a doctor be consulted ? &quot; If you feel severely ill , pass any blood or throw_up blood , have significant nausea or vomiting or symptoms last longer than three days , get medical help , &quot; Runnels said . The Healthy Traveler appears the second and fourth week of every month .</TEXT>
