   <HEADLINE> CLINTON SENDS RECORDS TO FORMER WHITEWATER PARTNER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton has sent copies of Whitewater Development Corp . records to his former business partner , James B . McDougal , who had complained publicly earlier this year that he was unable to prepare his tax_returns without the documents . David E . Kendall , Clinton ' s lawyer , said in a letter to McDougal ' s attorney that he had sent the records -- about 2 # 000 pages of land sale contracts , escrow receipts and Whitewater bank_account statements -- to McDougal on Monday . Kendall ' s letter was released by the White_House on Wednesday . McDougal ' s attorney , Sam Heuer of Little_Rock , Ark. , said Wednesday that he had received the records but that they remained sealed in his office . &quot; Jim ( McDougal ) hasn ' t been through them yet , &quot; Heuer said . &quot; When he can come_in , we ' ll catalogue them and see what they consist of. &quot; Heuer said that although he is not required to keep the records secret , he will not allow anyone besides McDougal to look_at them until he knows precisely what the files contain . The records , which the White_House has declined to release to the public , include the collection of Whitewater-related papers that were in the office of Vincent Foster , the White_House deputy counsel who apparently committed suicide last summer . The material also includes documents that Kendall has collected from other sources in recent months , the letter stated . According to McDougal , whose account is not disputed by the White_House , Foster obtained the Whitewater-related papers from McDougal before Clinton took_office . At the Clintons ' behest , Foster had offered to prepare several years of corporate tax_returns for the Whitewater firm , which was formed by the Clintons and McDougal and his wife to build a resort community in the Ozarks . McDougal apparently neglected to prepare and file the returns . Foster had completed his tax work and sent the necessary information to accountants before he died but had not returned the documents to McDougal . The revelation that the papers were in Foster ' s office at the time of his death was key in thrusting the Whitewater controversy back into the nation ' s headlines and triggering the appointment of special counsel Robert B . Fiske Jr . to investigate the_matter . &quot; As you are aware , all documents relating to Whitewater from Mr. McDougal and other sources which I have collected have been turned_over to the special counsel without any claim of privilege of any kind , &quot; Kendall noted in his letter . Kendall went_on to note that neither he nor the Clintons &quot; have been able to locate anything approaching a complete set of records for Whitewater . For example , I have been unable to find stock books , corporate minute_books and several other kinds of typical corporate records. &quot; Fiske is looking_into allegations that President Clinton may have benefited improperly from his association with McDougal , owner of the failed Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan as well as a partner in the Whitewater development . Although the special counsel ' s inquiry centers_on Whitewater , Fiske is also investigating Foster ' s death last July . His inquiry also encompasses the role played by First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and her Little_Rock law_firm in representing Whitewater and Madison Guaranty .</TEXT>
