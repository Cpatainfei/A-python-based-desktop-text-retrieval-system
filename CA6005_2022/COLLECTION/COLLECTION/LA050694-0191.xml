   <HEADLINE> U.S. COMPLETES POLICY ON PEACEKEEPING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Clinton_Administration , chastened by its flawed efforts to make or keep peace in Somalia , Bosnia-Herzegovina and Haiti , has completed a long-delayed , oft-revised policy governing U.S. participation in peacekeeping operations around the globe . The new policy sets numerous , stringent conditions , with U.S. involvement in international peacekeeping to become &quot; more selective and more effective &quot; as a result , according to White_House National Security Adviser Anthony Lake . Signed by President Clinton earlier this week , the policy marks the first comprehensive effort by the government to specify the conditions under which the United States will intervene in foreign conflicts . But the document , known as Presidential Decision Directive 13 , spells_out only the questions -- not the answers -- for policy-makers to consider when faced by a difficult political or humanitarian crisis such_as those now facing Haiti or Rwanda . &quot; This study is not a crystal ball , &quot; Lake said . &quot; It is a road map. &quot; The study is the result of a yearlong policy review . The State_Department and the Pentagon took months to resolve the issue of who will pay the U.S. share for various types of peacekeeping missions . It was finally determined that the Pentagon would pay_for operations involving substantial numbers of U.S. troops and the likelihood of combat , such_as Somalia . The State_Department will underwrite more traditional peacekeeping duties where no U.S. combat troops are dispatched , such_as operations in the Golan Heights and Cambodia . The change will result in a shift of about $ 500 million from the State_Department budget_for multinational organizations to the Pentagon , officials said . Under the new policy , U.S. military_forces will never come under foreign command , although troops on occasion may be assigned to the temporary operational control of a U.N. commander . But there may be cases in which U.S. troops may serve &quot; for a specific time frame , for a specific mission , in a particular location &quot; under a military commander from another U.N. country . Before the United States agrees to participate in a U.N. operation , these conditions must be met : There must be an identifiable U.S. interest at stake ; the mission must be clearly defined in size , scope and duration ; there must be sufficient resources and political will to carry_out the mission , and there must be an identifiable &quot; exit strategy &quot; for ending U.S. involvement . Clear lines of command must be in place , and Congress and the American people must support U.S. involvement . Officials said an important goal of the new policy is to lower the cost of U.S. participation in U.N. peacekeeping operations . The Administration has said it wants to pay no more_than 25 % of the U.N. peacekeeping budget . It now contributes almost a third and is $ 1 billion behind in its payments . Lake said that the new policy reflects the limits of U.S. ability to solve the world ' s problems as well as constraints on the Treasury . Clinton ' s campaign proposal for a standing U.N. peacekeeping force has now evolved into a plan to create a computer_database of forces that could be enlisted on short notice to enforce U.N. resolutions .</TEXT>
