   <HEADLINE> TRAVEL INSIDER : PUTTING THE OFFICIAL STAMP ON MIDDLE_EAST BORDER CROSSINGS ; PASSPORTS : POLICIES ARE CHANGING , BUT SOME ARAB COUNTRIES STILL BAN TRAVELERS WHO CARRY ISRAELI VISAS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israeli and Palestinian leaders may be talking at last , but travelers between Israel and its Arab neighbors still need to pay close attention to their passports . Many Middle Eastern nations for years have refused to admit travelers bearing Israeli stamps in their passports . And even though relations between governments have been fitfully improving , U.S. State_Department officials say some immigration agents may still cling_to old policies . But which immigration agents ? that ' s the big complication , because reliable information is hard to come_by . In many Arab nations ( as in the United States ) , two different government representatives may answer the same question in opposite ways . Lacking reliable information , U.S. State_Department officials say , they can ' t even offer a specific list of countries that ban Israeli stamps . This isn ' t a problem in Egypt , the most common neighboring destination of American travelers to Israel . Egypt has accepted Israelis and travelers with Israeli passport stamps since soon after the Camp David Accords of 1978 . But tourism officials say a longtime ban officially remains in_effect -- at least for now -- in other Arab nations , including Bahrain , Jordan , Oman , Qatar , Saudi_Arabia , Syria , the United Arab Emirates and Yemen . ( There does , however , appear to be growing flexibility in some quarters . Jordanian officials , for instance , say they now make their admissions decisions &quot; on a case-by-case basis. &quot; ) The State_Department ' s advice is that travelers &quot; consult the nearest U.S. Passport Agency for guidance. &quot; The Passport Agency ' s Southern California office is at 11000 Wilshire Blvd. , Room 13100 , Los Angeles 90024-3615 ; tel . ( 310 ) 575-7070 . ( Since the Jan . 17 earthquake , its hours have changed from 9 a.m.-4 p.m. to 8 a.m.-3 p.m. ) But that office ' s phone_number provides recorded information , and officials there may be too busy for detailed consultations . Here are some options : * Ask Israeli immigration agents to stamp a separate piece_of_paper , rather than your passport itself . Officials commonly go_along with such requests , but travelers should remember that this is a judgment call ; Israel notes that the decision &quot; is at the discretion of authorities. &quot; * Get a temporary second passport from the U.S Passport Agency . Until 1992 , U.S. officials issued second passports specifically for travel_to Israel . Since then , the U.S. has issued second passports that don ' t specifically name Israel , but serve the same purpose and are good for two years . U.S. officials require a lot of paperwork to issue such a passport , and often counsel against it ; if you have two passports , you are far more likely to lose one , or hand_over the wrong one at the border . * Make Israel the final stop on your itinerary . This is by far the best option , and if there ' s any uncertainty about passport approvals , travelers should take this measure either alone or in addition to one of those above . The worst that can happen is that you see all_the countries you intended to , get stamped in Israel , and come_home to the U.S. , where you can decide at_leisure whether you care to replace the passport . ( For decades , South_African passport stamps have posed the same problems in Africa that an Israeli stamp did_in the Arab world . But now , as South_Africa emerges from its former pariah status and approaches its first post-apartheid election in April , many of those sanctions have eased . Within the last 18 months , both Egypt and Kenya have changed policies and started admitting travelers with South_African stamps on their passports . Tourism officials of all but a handful of Africa ' s 50-some nations have made similar changes. ) No matter what your passport strategy , it behooves travelers to Africa and the Middle_East to make advance contact with foreign embassies in the U.S. to discuss visa requirements and other details . Travelers should also take particular care to stay apprised of unrest and political developments that could affect tourism . Recorded country-by-country updates are available from the State_Department at ( 202 ) 647-5225 . * Travelers should also remember that the busiest season for passport applications is March to July , when processing_time can stretch from the usual two weeks to three or four or even longer . Applicants need not apply through the Passport Agency ' s Wilshire Boulevard office ; many people can apply by mail , and most people can apply through the &quot; acceptance facilities &quot; at post_offices and county_courthouses throughout the state . Generally , passport applicants need to provide proof of citizenship ( such_as a previous passport , birth_certificate or certificate of naturalization ) , two photographs ( each two inches square , in either color or black-and-white ) , evidence of identity ( such_as a driver ' s license or a military ID card ) , a $ 65 fee ( or $ 40 for travelers under 18 ) and an application_form .</TEXT>
