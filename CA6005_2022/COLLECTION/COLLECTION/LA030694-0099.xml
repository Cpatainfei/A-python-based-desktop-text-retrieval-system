   <TEXT> Picture this chilling scenario in earthquake-vulnerable Orange County . It could happen . It ' s 1996 , and the major Newport-Inglewood earthquake earlier this year left massive death and destruction along a 35-mile corridor stretching from Huntington Beach through Fountain Valley and Santa Ana , and well into Laguna Hills and Coto de Caza . It killed 20 # 000 men , women and children . Most died instantly , but many were lost because they couldn ' t be dug_out in time . Over 500 # 000 were injured , 100 # 000 suffering severe life- and limb-threatening conditions . The death and disability toll among the severely injured would have been much higher , more_than doubled , but many thousands received on-the-spot advanced emergency medical_care from hundreds of medical volunteers who were prepared to act without delay . The story of one victim , 14-year-old Anna , illustrates the events of that terrible disaster . Anna was in class at the local high_school when it hit . She was_on the third floor when the building partially collapsed and heavy desks , file_cabinets and debris were hurled cruelly about , killing or severely injuring 512 students and staff . The coroner later reported that all 150 deaths were virtually instantaneous due_to massive head and chest injuries . Anna and 361 others were badly hurt , mostly with crushed legs , concussions , major fractures and lacerations with severe blood loss . Anna ' s right foot was mutilated by falling concrete . As soon as the first quake stopped , most of the 2 # 000 uninjured students and faculty evacuate the ruined building . All of the staff and a group of seniors had been trained in first_aid and the &quot; simple triage and rapid treatment &quot; technique . They deployed through the rubble finding victims and safely moving many of them to open ground . They knew the threat of aftershocks and worked swiftly and quietly . Everyone knew &quot; the Big One &quot; had hit and that they would be_on their own for the next few days . Within the first hour , concerned parents began arriving and were organized and put_to_work . Six nurses and two physicians were already at_work . Dr. Gray left her car and walked to the site from the smashed freeway two miles away , having identified the school as a pre-defined medical supply site from a special map issued to volunteers . She had a backpack of supplies she kept_in the car trunk since becoming a volunteer and treated the most severely wounded while rescue and sorting continued . Her backpack supplies lasted for about an hour , but with them she was able to relieve a collapsed lung , surgically open a victim ' s windpipe , intubate the lungs of three unconscious concussion victims , and begin intravenous diuresis and antibiotics on two victims with crushed legs -- one of whom was Anna . Strong non-narcotic pain shots were administered to the most needy . The medical volunteers organized a disaster medical_aid center and sent volunteers to bring them the area ' s Medical Disaster Response supply modules . In the next several hours more medical volunteers arrived , several from the local medical clinic bringing additional supply modules to supplement those stored at the school . Additional victims were brought_in from the surrounding neighborhood . The National_Guard responded to prearranged landing zone signals on the soccer field , leaving an armed trooper on site to communicate with the growing numbers of available medevac helicopters . Several students were flown out_to San Diego and Riverside hospitals for surgical treatment of severe internal injuries . They arrived in good_condition thanks to stabilization at the Aid Center and will do_well . In the next 12 to 24 hours , the flow of victims slowed considerably , but the victims , laid side_by_side , covered the entire football_field . At night , a group of 13 physicians and 68 nurses labored under generator lights to surgically clean wounds , relieve pain and keep the severely injured stable . It is grim work in a battlefield setting but it paid_off . Over 400 men , women and children were stabilized for orderly evacuation outside the quake zone . Anna was resting pain-free in a camping tent after surgical cleansing of her wounds and powerful antibiotic treatment . The day after the initial jolt there is a sense of calm at the aid center . More medical volunteers arrived from nearby undamaged communities , bringing their supply modules with them . Very few new victims arrived . The casualties are kept comfortable and are continuously re-evaluated , much like a hospital intensive care unit but without the electronics . When evacuation opportunities arise , the most needy go_out first . Anna is comfortable and her mother is with her . The foot looks bad , however , and is showing signs of gangrene . On Day 3 , it ' s business as usual . Food , shelter and security are under_control . The hospitals within helicopter range are saturated and only a_few roads are open so evacuation is slow . Anna ' s lower leg has to be amputated to prevent the spread of gangrene . The surgery is performed with anesthesia and without pain . The loss of her leg is tragic , but she survives without further disability . By Day 7 all critically injured have been evacuated and the disaster medical_aid center is now a tent city . Epilogue : Anna ' s leg had healed and she has adjusted to her artificial leg . Her classmates have all been helped with stress debriefing therapy by volunteer mental_health workers . They get_together every year for the rest of their long lives to commemorate the tragedy that could have been much worse . It is estimated that an additional 30 # 000 people would have died if the medical response had not been available . So_much for a scenario . The fact is that vital emergency medical_care is not currently available through any of the existing county , Red_Cross , Salvation_Army , state or federal relief programs . Injuries like Anna ' s will be fatal if the great quake strikes before a medical disaster response program can be implemented . She would likely develop blood_poisoning and kidney_failure within a_few days . By the time relief arrives she would be dead or , at best , the ruined leg would be amputated and she would survive on renal dialysis for the rest of her shortened , chronically-ill life . At this moment in real time , there exists a nonprofit volunteer group named Medical Disaster Response . More_than 400 physicians and nurses and medical technicians have been trained over the past five years to respond in major disasters . But they can do little without supplies . To be truly effective , their supplies must be pre-packed and prepositioned and rotated regularly to ensure freshness . The first MDR supply modules are already in place in Mission Viejo ( there are three in that city ) , Disneyland , the Bristol Park Medical_Building in Irvine , and Our Lady of Fatima Elementary School in San Clemente . Forty backpacks have been distributed to specially trained physicians ready to be filled with life- and limb-saving supplies . Large-scale participation is in the works for the UC Irvine Medical_School campus and a prominent medical group ' s 10 facilities throughout the county . But we need at least 100 more supply modules and backpacks distributed around the county before we can expect to accomplish the recoveries in the scenario described above . Our &quot; Annas &quot; deserve a fighting chance against preventable disability and death .</TEXT>
