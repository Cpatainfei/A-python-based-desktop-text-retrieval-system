   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER OLYMPIC GAMES / LILLEHAMMER ; NOTEBOOK ; KOSS SETS A RECORD AND WINS NORWAY ' S FIRST GOLD MEDAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Speedskater Johann Olav Koss won the host country ' s first gold medal Sunday , setting a world_record in the 5 # 000-meter race at the Viking Ship rink in Hamar . Koss , urged_on by a raucous crowd of about 12 # 000 , won in 6 minutes 34.96 seconds , topping his own world_record , 6:35.53 , set_on the same rink in December . His teammate , Kjell Storelid , finished second in 6:42.68 , which was an Olympic record until Koss skated two pairs later , and Rintje Ritsma of the_Netherlands was third in 6:43.94. &quot; This was great , the best thing that ' s ever happened to me , &quot; said Koss , a 25-year-old medical_student . &quot; I have never performed better . I was not very confident before the race but Kjell Storelid ' s great performance was an immense inspiration. &quot; Skating on freshly resurfaced ice , Koss lagged behind his record pace in the early going and with a lap left still was six-hundredths of a second behind . But with the crowd screaming , &quot; Johann ! Johann ! Johann ! &quot; he stepped_up the pace and skated the lap six-tenths of a second faster than he had done_in December . Brian Wanek , the only American skater entered , finished 30th in 7:05.95 in the 32-skater field . * The first gold medal of the Games was won by Italian Manuela Di Centa , who upset two Russian skiers in the women ' s 15-kilometer freestyle cross-country race . Di Centa , 31 , the only non-Russian to have won a World Cup race this season , a 15K classical at Toblach , Italy , in December , skied the course in 39:44.5. Russian Lyubov Egorova , winner of three gold and two silver medals two years ago in the Albertville Games , was second in 41.03.0 , and her teammate , Nina Gavriluk , won the bronze in 41:10.4. Gaetano Di Centa , Manuela ' s father and longtime coach , hugged her in the finish area and said , &quot; Bravo , my star . This is only the beginning. &quot; Laura McCabe of Park City , Utah , was the first American to finish . She placed 34th in 43:51.1. * What would a Winter_Olympics be without Eddie ( the Eagle ) Edwards ? Probably not nearly as much fun . Edwards , the nearly blind English ski_jumper who captivated the world with his short and formless jumps at Calgary in 1988 , then was not allowed to jump at Albertville , showed_up at the large ski hill here , carrying a pair of slalom skis . He said he was entered in the competition , to be held next Sunday , but was not allowed into the jumping area because he had no accreditation . After saying he was being prevented from jumping because the the judges feared he would jump too far , he confessed to having a secret weapon . &quot; Jet_engines concealed in the bindings , &quot; he said .
