   <HEADLINE> IN GAZA , FEAR OF ANARCHY TRIGGERS ILLEGAL-ARMS BOOM ; MIDEAST : PALESTINIANS WORRY ISRAELI WITHDRAWAL WILL LEAVE VOID IN WHICH FEUDS , POLITICAL VIOLENCE CAN GROW .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Soon after Monsour Shawa was appointed mayor of Gaza City , a friend called to congratulate him and recommend a first order_of_business : Buy a gun . &quot; He offered to sell me one -- a 9-millimeter automatic , &quot; said the prominent Gaza businessman . &quot; I said , ' What ' s the price ? ' When he told me , I said , ' No thank_you , I ' ll take my chances. ' &quot; The price : $ 3 # 500 . But while the cost of weaponry is soaring -- just three months ago , a 9-millimeter pistol went_for a third that amount -- Gaza ' s black_market in illegal arms is booming . The reason : fear . Unlike Shawa , Palestinians throughout the occupied territories have been scrambling to stock up_on pistols , machine_guns , assault_rifles and ammunition in recent months , most of them desperate for a measure of personal protection in_advance of Israel ' s promised withdrawal from Gaza and the West_Bank town of Jericho . For Israel , the weapons proliferation illustrates an issue that has been central to the delay in its troop withdrawal , originally scheduled to begin last Dec . 13 and put_off for at least another week late Sunday when talks between PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres ended in Switzerland without a final agreement . Partly out of fear of an even larger influx of firepower into their back yard , Israeli negotiators have been insisting that their troops maintain military_control of the border crossings into the new Palestinian entity . The Palestinians have insisted that policing the borders is critical to their new autonomy . The border controversy was at the top of the list of tentative weekend compromises made by Arafat and Peres . At the core of the growing gun problem in the territories is a concern as human as it is political . It is the shared worry among Israelis and Palestinians that the dawning of a new age of autonomy after nearly three decades under strict military occupation will bring a new era of anarchy as well . &quot; There is a lot of confusion and fear in Gaza for ordinary people , &quot; said Shawa , whom Arafat named chief_executive of the capital of the emerging autonomous Gaza . &quot; It is a fear of the unknown , a fear that if there is no law , no order , no one to settle feuds , there is going_to be a period of trouble . People are desperate to have protection. &quot; The run_on guns in Gaza has driven the price of a U.S.-made M-16 rifle to nearly $ 9 # 000 -- a jump of $ 2 # 000 in two months . A Russian-made AK-47 goes_for $ 6 # 500 . The price of a single bullet that sells for 30 cents in Israel now costs $ 4 in the occupied territories , a premium that has drawn children to scavenge at Israeli army firing_ranges . Many Palestinians , and some Israeli lawmakers , blame the Israeli military for the proliferation of arms . Israeli troops still control the territories ' borders , and critics assert that border guards deliberately permit the weapons and ammunition to pass_through their checkpoints from Egypt and Jordan . In a land where such conspiracy theories are common after 27 years of sometimes-harsh military occupation , those critics suggest that the Israeli aim is to fuel future infighting among the territories ' many Palestinian factions . Israeli Deputy Defense Minister Mordechai Gur flatly denied that charge last week , and sources in the Israel Defense Forces called the allegation &quot; absurd. &quot; Gur ' s denial , delivered in the Israeli Parliament , or Knesset , reflected the elevation of the gun issue to an integral part of Israel ' s national debate on the peace process . Responding to charges by Israeli legislators that the army is ignoring the arms surge in the territories , Gur confirmed in the Knesset that Palestinians in the territories are stockpiling weapons . But he insisted in his testimony that the Israel Defense Forces are working hard to track_down and destroy arms caches in Gaza and the West_Bank . &quot; How can you even conceive_of such a thing ? &quot; Gur asked the legislators who raised the issue . &quot; Is it even conceivable that we would treat a flow of weapons to the Gaza Strip calmly , when our soldiers are in the strip and fighting in it ? &quot; In fact , Gur said , the military is intensifying its weapons searches throughout the territories . There was ample evidence in recent weeks to support his assertion . Last week in the small West_Bank village of Aboud , Israeli soldiers conducted a weapons search as destructive as it was meticulous at a Palestinian house that is now riddled with holes . It was the home of Mahmoud Abdul Majid , whose five sons were arrested in early January as suspected Palestinian terrorists . Two of the boys were released two weeks later . The other three were kept_in an Israeli jail for further interrogation . Last week , the army returned to the Abdul Majid ' s house and systematically began taking it apart . The family showed a visiting reporter walls that had been cracked open , floors ripped_up , a bathroom torn inside out and the bedroom of one of the detained sons -- a 28-year-old plumber -- taken completely apart . Throughout the search , which the family said took 14 hours and spanned two days , the soldiers told them they were looking_for an arms stockpile the family insisted did not exist . An Israeli military spokesman confirmed that soldiers had conducted the search . The Abdul Majid house was targeted , he said , because the brothers were caught with bomb-making materials when they were arrested . The army spokesman stressed that the search exhibited &quot; the ongoing efforts by the Israel Defense Forces to locate and identify illegal weapons in the territories -- especially among those who are against the peace. &quot; But he confirmed that in the end , nothing was found at the Abdul Majid house . Many Palestinians do not blame Israel ' s security_forces alone for the recent arms flow into the territories . Some leveled charges of negligence against the leaders of several Palestinian factions represented in Gaza , particularly Arafat ' s Fatah wing . That faction will supply most of the officers in the Palestinian police_force planned for control of law and order in Gaza and Jericho as Israel withdraws . Local Palestine Liberation Organization leaders confirm that it will be up_to the new police to crack_down on the weapons flow after the Israelis withdraw . But Shawa and other members of Arafat ' s handpicked team fear it may be too late by then . Their fear goes beyond the potential for armed conflict between Fatah and an extremist opposition of fundamentalist Islamic groups and leftist political_parties that also sponsor well-armed rebels in the territories . Much of the worry is grounded in ancient family feuds that have simmered beneath the surface of Gaza ' s society throughout the occupation . Israel ' s military presence , combined with a shared commitment among most Gazans to join forces against a more powerful common enemy , froze most of those feuds in place . &quot; But the memory is long in Gaza , &quot; Shawa said . &quot; Maybe it was a woman , maybe a rape , maybe a piece_of_land . Maybe it happened 30 years ago , or maybe 300 . But everyone here remembers . &quot; Now that guns are everywhere here , this could be a disaster . If the police fail to take immediate control -- a difficult task even in the best of times -- these feuds easily could explode the moment the common enemy is gone. &quot;</TEXT>
