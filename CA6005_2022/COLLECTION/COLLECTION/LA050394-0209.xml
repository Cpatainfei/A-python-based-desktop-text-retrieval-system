   <HEADLINE> CLINTON SEEKS TO ' STRENGTHEN ' CHINA TIES ; DIPLOMACY : PRESIDENT TELLS VISITING VICE PREMIER THAT IMPROVEMENT DEPENDS_ON BEIJING ' S HUMAN_RIGHTS POLICIES . BUT HE IS CRITICIZED FOR NOT ' SOUNDING TOUGH. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton told an emissary from Beijing on Monday that he wants to &quot; strengthen &quot; U.S. ties with China , a White_House spokesman said . But in the 40-minute Oval Office meeting with Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua , the President added that China still must make progress in its human_rights policies if relations are to improve . Clinton_Administration officials said Zou did not offer Clinton anything new from the Chinese regime and did not promise any of the policy_changes the Administration has been seeking , such_as the release of dissidents and an end to the jamming of Voice of America broadcasts . &quot; He did not bring anything with him , &quot; one Administration official said . The meeting underscored the Administration ' s increasingly frenetic effort to head_off a major conflict with China over human_rights and trade . It was also the highest-level contact between Washington and Beijing this year , and possibly the last such session before the President decides what to do about China ' s trade privileges . Clinton must decide before June 3 whether to extend China ' s most-favored-nation trade benefits , under which it enjoys the right to export to this country with the same low duties as most other nations . A year ago , the President signed an executive order that said China should make &quot; significant overall progress &quot; on human_rights if it wants to maintain its trade benefits after July , 1994 . But the Chinese regime has said it will not respond to U.S. pressure . In recent weeks , Beijing has taken steps seemingly aimed at defying the Administration ' s human_rights policies . China arrested several dissidents during a Beijing visit by Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher and since has announced it is again detaining China ' s top democracy advocate , Wei Jingsheng . He was released from jail last September , when China was hoping to land the 2000 Olympic Games . An Administration official said Monday night that Clinton told Zou the United States is not trying to impose its views on China . Rather , the President said , it is asking China to fulfill its human_rights obligations under the U.N. Charter . This official said the President acknowledged to Zou that China has made progress on human_rights . But he said he is waiting to see what other progress there might be between now and June 3 , when he must make the decision on China ' s trade benefits . Mike Jendrzejczyk , Washington director of Human_Rights Watch ( Asia ) , criticized the Administration ' s handling of Monday ' s session . &quot; Clinton should have come_out sounding tough and like he means it . I ' m very disappointed that Wei wasn ' t even mentioned &quot; in public statements after the meeting , Jendrzejczyk said . Administration officials &quot; are letting the hard-liners know that we ' ll look the other way if they simply give us some cover to save face for Clinton . . . . The Chinese respond to strength , not weakness. &quot; The Administration is studying the possibility of penalizing China for human_rights violations by targeting specific products from state industries . One approach being considered would be to use a provision of a 1988 trade law that allows the United States to retaliate against nations that violate labor standards . Zou is both vice premier in_charge of China ' s state planning apparatus and a member of the Communist_Party Politburo . He was invited to Washington by Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown and Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary . Knowledgeable sources said Brown has actively pushed for the Administration to change its policy toward Beijing in a way that will help U.S. companies land more contracts_in China . &quot; Given his rank , we thought it was important that the President should see him , &quot; one U.S. official said . In the Oval Office meeting , Clinton was joined by other top-level U.S. officials , including Brown , National Security Adviser Anthony Lake , National Economic Council chief Robert E . Rubin , Acting Secretary_of_State Strobe Talbott and Assistant Secretary_of_State Winston Lord .</TEXT>
