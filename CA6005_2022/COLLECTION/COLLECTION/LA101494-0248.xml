   <HEADLINE> LOYALIST MILITIAS DECLARE N . IRISH CEASE-FIRE ; ULSTER : THE MOVE BY MOSTLY PROTESTANT GROUPS COMES SIX WEEKS AFTER IRA PUT_DOWN ARMS . LONDON AND DUBLIN WELCOME NEWS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> British loyalists in Northern_Ireland announced a cease-fire Thursday , heralding a possible end to the politically inspired violence that has racked the province for 25 years . The move , by largely Protestant paramilitary groups that want to keep British control in Northern_Ireland , came six weeks after the outlawed Irish_Republican_Army announced its own cease-fire , which seemed to provide a serious platform for the peace process initiated by Britain and Ireland last December . The latest cease-fire began at midnight Thursday . British Prime_Minister John Major declared the announcement &quot; unalloyed good news. &quot; Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds said it marked &quot; the dawn of a new era &quot; and called_on the_British government to speed_up the peace process . The declaration was made in Belfast late Thursday by the Combined Loyalist Military Command and read by Gusty Spence , a former leader of the outlawed Ulster Volunteer Force who served a sentence for murder . &quot; The permanence of our cease-fire will be completely dependent upon the continued cessation of all nationalist-republican violence , &quot; the statement said . &quot; The sole responsibility for a return to war lies_with them . &quot; In the genuine hope that this peace will be permanent , we take the opportunity to pay homage to all our fighters , commandos and volunteers who have paid the supreme sacrifice . They did not die in vain . The union is safe. &quot; The statement added : &quot; In all sincerity , we offer to the loved ones of all innocent victims over the past 25 years abject and true remorse . No words of ours will compensate for the intolerable suffering they have undergone during the conflict. &quot; However , the cease-fire statement insisted that loyalists had &quot; guarantees &quot; of Northern_Ireland ' s constitutional position in Britain , which the IRA and its political arm , Sinn Fein , have sought through violence to dislodge . The British government has insisted that the fate of Northern_Ireland be determined by a majority of the people in the province -- rather than in the entire island of Ireland , which is what Sinn Fein and others seek . Like the largely Roman_Catholic IRA , the unionist paramilitaries -- the Ulster Freedom Fighters and Ulster Volunteer Force -- made no mention Thursday of turning_in weapons , ammunition or explosives . The unionist militias are responsible_for about one-third of the more_than 3 # 100 deaths attributed to sectarian violence in the province . The unionists had been under increasing pressure by moderate Protestant politicians to match the IRA ' s cease-fire and also from many militants -- if only for the sake of public relations . On Monday , British authorities permitted representatives of the unionist paramilitaries to visit paramilitary prisoners in Northern_Ireland ' s Maze prison for terrorism offenses -- to seek their approval to embark_on the declared cease-fire . On his recent U.S. tour , Gerry Adams , president of Sinn Fein , the political arm of the IRA , had noted that the IRA was observing a cease-fire while the unionist paramilitaries continued to shoot and bomb . And Adams , in Canada on Thursday at the end of his tour , called_on Major to &quot; stop fumbling with this peace process &quot; and to accelerate London ' s response . He said the_British should &quot; begin to demilitarize immediately &quot; in Northern_Ireland . Major , attending the annual Conservative_Party conference in Bournemouth , said of the cease-fire : &quot; It is extremely good news . A few months ago very few people would have imagined we would have been talking in a situation in which there is an IRA cease-fire and a loyalist paramilitary cease-fire with a genuine hope we may be able to move forward. &quot;</TEXT>
