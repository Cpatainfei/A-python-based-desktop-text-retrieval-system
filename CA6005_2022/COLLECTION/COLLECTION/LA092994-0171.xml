   <HEADLINE> 3 FIRMS MAY STOP FLOW OF OIL ROYALTIES ; LONG_BEACH : AN ESTIMATED 13 # 000 OWNERS OF MINERAL RIGHTS WILL BE OFFERED INVESTMENT OPTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three oil_companies operating in Long_Beach have announced that they will no longer pay royalties to some 13 # 000 owners of mineral interests in properties on an oil field beneath most of the city ' s shoreline areas , including Downtown . The mineral rights owners , most of them heirs and small investors , will be offered the choice of becoming full investors in the 47 # 000-barrel-a-day enterprise and assuming many of the risks of the oil market , or of abandoning their claims altogether . Other oil_companies could take_over the 13 # 000 leases , but that appears unlikely in the current oil market , investors said . For 29 years , property_owners and those who own the mineral rights to the properties have received regular_payments for allowing a group of &quot; working-interest owners , &quot; including Chevron , Phillips Petroleum and ARCO oil_companies , to extract oil and gas from the field . But decreasing reserves in the oil field and fluctuations in the price of oil have made the operation less profitable for the three oil_companies . Chevron will pull_out of the oil field altogether , said R . K . Spackman , the company ' s public affairs manager . ARCO , owner of THUMS Long_Beach Co. , which manages the oil field , will continue to be involved in oil_production there . Phillips , which has small mineral rights stake of its own , will continue as an investor . The royalty payments could stop by the end of the year , after mineral rights owners have been formally notified , Spackman said . Formal agreements signed by property_owners in the mid-1960s included terms for suspending royalty payments . Royalties paid to the 13 # 000 mineral-rights owners represent only a small portion of the profits from the field , which extends into Long_Beach Harbor . The state receives the largest share of the profits . Last year , the state collected $ 18 million , or 87 % of the profits . The city received $ 161 # 000 , less than 1 % . The field is the so-called Long_Beach unit of the East Wilmington Field , where oil was discovered in 1936 . In 1965 , the oil_companies began pumping from a series of four oil islands in Long_Beach Harbor . The Long_Beach unit yielded as much as 150 # 000 barrels a day by the late 1960s . About 790 million barrels have been pumped from the field since it opened . Most of the mineral rights owners in the field ' s so-called Townlot area -- the portion on dry_land -- are small individual investors . They receive an average of about $ 350 a year , oil_company representatives said . If all became working-interest owners , they would have to absorb collectively about 8 % of the $ 150 million a year required to operate the field , the representatives said . That represents an average annual payment of $ 92 . But that does not take_into_account the possibility of a downturn in the market , said Mel Wright , an oil_industry consultant who is also a royalty-interest owner . Wright and his wife , Jonine , receive royalty checks of about $ 50 a month because they own a share of the mineral rights to a property at 5th Place and Ocean Boulevard , which they inherited from Jonine Wright ' s grandfather . &quot; As long as THUMS keeps the costs down and the oil price stays_up , you ' ll make money , &quot; Wright said . &quot; But if oil goes_back down and there are more drilling expenses , you lose money. &quot; Oil from Long_Beach was selling this week for $ 13.44 a barrel , oil_company spokesmen said . Last December , one of the few months when the Long_Beach operation went_into the red , the price fell below $ 9 , they said .</TEXT>
