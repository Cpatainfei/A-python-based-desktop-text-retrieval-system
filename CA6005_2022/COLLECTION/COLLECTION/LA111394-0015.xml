   <TEXT> A BITTER TRUTH : Avant-Garde Art and the Great War by Richard Cork ( Yale_University Press : $ 49.95 ; 336 pp. ) The arts just prior to World_War I were charged with profound upheaval , feverish vitality and brilliant invention , as if the Zeitgeist knew that dramatically different visual languages and techniques would soon be required to register the monstrous carnage of &quot; the last_days of mankind. &quot; Expressionism , with its strident disruptions of classical composition and the human form , secured a central place in this brave new artistic world . Its tendency to reduce people to generic types provided a chilling counterpoint to the dehumanizing means and scale of modern warfare . Ludwig Meidner ' s apocalyptic landscapes ( with which this book opens ) , painted in the two years before the war , show how mysteriously intertwined these upsurges of creative and destructive energy could be . &quot; A Bitter Truth : Avant-Garde Art and the Great War , &quot; is , amazingly , the first book to comprehensively treat its subject , and it does so masterfully , teeming with trenchant anecdote and telling detail . Cork moves chronologically , combining historical background , biographical incident and cogent visual analysis in a highly integrated and readable text . The illustrations , moreover , are profuse , superbly chosen and excellently reproduced : In some ways the book forms the perfect visual complement to Paul Fussell ' s &quot; The Great War and Modern Memory. &quot; Among numerous unexpected discoveries is the striking work of British painter Paul Nash , a gentle , countrified aesthete whose battlefield experiences as a commissioned war artist utterly transformed his vision and his work . In this he serves well as an emblem of all that was done and undone by the Great War . Thomas Frick</TEXT>
