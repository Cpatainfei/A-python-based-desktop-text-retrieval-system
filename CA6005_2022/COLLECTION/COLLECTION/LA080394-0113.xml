   <HEADLINE> OPPOSITION REPORTS TOPPLING CHIEF OF BREAKAWAY RUSSIAN REPUBLIC ; CAUCASUS : BUT CHECHNYA ' S LEADER APPEARS TO BE IN CONTROL OF THE CAPITAL . HE HAS BEEN A THORN IN MOSCOW ' S SIDE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pro-Russian opposition leaders in the north Caucasian republic of Chechnya announced Tuesday that they had toppled President Dzhokar Dudayev , the fierce former Soviet air_force general who has been a thorn in Moscow ' s side since he declared his tiny Muslim republic to be independent from Russia in 1991 . Dudayev , however , appeared to be firmly in control at least in the Chechen capital , Grozny . In an interview with the Interfax news_agency late Tuesday evening , the president said his overthrow had been announced in_order to pave the way for Russian troops to invade Chechnya , a republic of 1.2 million people . The commander of an elite Russian paratroop division , responding to rumors that his unit in Tula , in central Russia , had been put_on alert , denied that Moscow had any plans to invade Chechnya . The coup leader , Umar Avturkhanov , appeared on Russian television Tuesday evening claiming that up_to 80 % of the Chechen people and most of the military supported him . Avturkhanov also said Moscow had recognized his group , the Provisional Council , as the only legitimate authority in Chechnya . &quot; Russia has made its choice , &quot; he said . Although Avturkhanov spoke from Moscow , Ostankino television reported from Grozny that troops loyal to him controlled most of the Chechen countryside while Dudayev ' s units were firmly in control of the capital and showed no signs of surrendering . Several large army_units had not yet chosen sides , according to Ostankino . No fighting was reported . Moscow has made no secret of its contempt for Dudayev , a defiant maverick who came_to power in a disputed election in 1991 and has since slashed all ties with Russia and insisted that Chechnya be recognized as a sovereign nation . The Russian Federation considers Chechnya to be one of its 88 republics . For his part , Dudayev blames Moscow for an assassination attempt against him earlier this year . And he accuses Russia of trying to reconquer its lost colony and oppress the Chechen people . The 50-year-old former general is the leading bad boy of the former Soviet_Union . The onetime nuclear bomber pilot sports a pencil mustache , elevator shoes and a flock of machine gun-toting bodyguards in baggy Italianate suits . The president is also said to have a black_belt in karate . His outlaw image is in keeping with that of his countrymen , who are arguably the most hated and discriminated-against minority in the former Soviet_Union . Chechens recall with bitterness the Stalin-era deportation of their entire people ; but Russians remember Chechnya only as the homeland of the much-feared &quot; Chechen mafia &quot; and of the terrorists who have been arrested in connection with four recent airplane and bus hijackings . Opposition forces have had sporadic gun battles with Dudayev forces in the streets of Grozny for months , and a rocket once slammed into the presidential headquarters . But the situation in Chechnya grew even more tense this week as local leaders united in the Provisional Council and made_it known they intended to oust Dudayev . Upping the ante Monday , the Russian government accused Dudayev of persecuting the 150 # 000 Russians who live_in Chechnya . President Boris N . Yeltsin ' s chief_of_staff , Sergei A . Filatov , also alleged that Dudayev supporters beheaded three Chechens who had helped Russian police catch a band of hijackers in southern Russia and had displayed their severed heads in downtown Grozny . The Russian Interior Ministry produced two gruesome photographs of heads and headless corpses , which were broadcast repeatedly Monday on Russian state television . Journalists in Grozny , however , have turned_up no evidence that any such beheading ever took_place . The Moscow Times newspaper , in a sharply worded editorial published Tuesday , suggested that the Yeltsin government may be trying to prepare the Russian public for a military incursion . On Tuesday at noon , the Provisional Council headed by Avturkhanov sent a statement to Russian news_agencies saying that Dudayev had been removed from office . The council also promised to hold new elections in the spring . Chechnya ' s general prosecutor retaliated by issuing an order for Avturkhanov ' s arrest on charges of high_treason . Within a_few hours , a senior Russian official , Deputy Prime_Minister Sergei M . Shakhrai , praised the Provisional Council , saying its principles were &quot; vital to the survival of the Chechen nation. &quot; He praised the council for promising to hold elections and said Moscow would be willing to negotiate with a delegation of its leaders . But other Russian officials warned against putting too_much stock in the Provisional Council ' s claim to have seized control of what has been a virtual police_state . Times special correspondent Chris Bird , in Grozny , contributed to this report .</TEXT>
