   <TEXT> Director James Cameron is currently in front of the camera , not behind it , posing for some publicity shots for his new movie , &quot; True Lies , &quot; and for a change , his assistants are directing him . &quot; Smile , &quot; suggests a young_woman who worked_on makeup for his latest action epic . &quot; You have a nice smile. &quot; &quot; How would you know ? &quot; Cameron good-naturedly demands . &quot; You ' ve never seen it. &quot; &quot; Every picture of you makes you look so mean , &quot; frets another assistant . &quot; The camera never lies , &quot; Cameron says -- and smiles . Cameron , who turns 40 next month , is clearly enjoying goofing on his reputation as a hard-nosed task master ; as a self-described &quot; total , obsessive-compulsive filmmaker &quot; ; as a guy who , well , might be advised to switch to decaf . On this day , though , the week before &quot; True Lies ' &quot; July 14 opening , he ' s positively relaxed , quick with a quip as well as that otherwise reticent smile . And this , despite the fact that the night before , at a crucial screening of his film before influential media , a projection glitch showed the film in what he decries as &quot; slow-motion , &quot; dragged_out the 2-hour-and-17-minute opus almost an extra 10 minutes . &quot; It was driving me nuts ; everybody was talllkiinnng . . . liiiike . . . thiiissss , &quot; Cameron laments . &quot; You work_on a movie for a year , and then it gets shown in slow motion. &quot; Funny thing was , practically nobody outside of Cameron noticed . Even at a protracted length on a faulty projector , &quot; True Lies &quot; largely operates at full throttle , particularly its final act , which easily boasts the most deliriously over-the-top action sequences of the year . Put it this way : This is a movie in which an island in the Florida Keys is blown_up by a nuclear device -- and that ' s not even the finale . In addition to the spectacle , &quot; True Lies &quot; is also a larky homage to the early James Bond movies and such spy vehicles as &quot; The Man From U.N.C.L.E. &quot; Arnold Schwarzenegger -- whom Cameron elevated to superstardom a decade back with the first &quot; Terminator &quot; movie -- stars as Harry Tasker , ultra-cool super-agent battling international terrorism by day , monotonous family dreg by night . His wife , Helen ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) , who takes him for no more_than a mossy computer geek , is a trifle stifled by his domesticity and longs for an existence as thrilling as his true life . Naturally , she gets her wish , and just about everything not named Tasker gets blown away in the bargain . Both Cameron and Schwarzenegger were fans of the tongue-in-cheek spy thrillers that serve as their movie ' s antecedents , but recent efforts in the genre had disappointed them both . &quot; The past 10 or 15 years have not seen any of those great Bond movies , &quot; says Schwarzenegger , who brought a French film , &quot; La Totale ! , &quot; with a similar theme to Cameron ' s attention . &quot; We wanted to bring that idea -- the gadgets , the ballsy way Bond would do things -- into the ' 90s. &quot; Cameron is more blunt : &quot; Bond ' s an aging , alcoholic Brit . C ' mon ! Let ' s pump some new blood into him ! &quot; * &quot; Last Action Hero , &quot; last summer ' s mega-disappointment , loomed heavily over the two men . Schwarzenegger , says Cameron , spent a day or so balking at the idea of leaping in a single bound from one action-comedy to another . &quot; We talked_about why it didn ' t work , and I felt that it was because the film was laughing_at Arnold and the genre and his fans from the outside , instead of laughing with them from the inside , which is what we would be doing , &quot; Cameron says . &quot; Besides I wanted to do a comedy , since I hadn ' t done one before , so I wasn ' t about to change that. &quot; Of &quot; Last Action Hero , &quot; Cameron drolly observes , &quot; not being funny is kind of a deficit for a movie that ' s supposed to be a comedy. &quot; He admits , however , that an action-comedy is &quot; a lethal combination , a tricky souffle . I don ' t know if we pulled it off here 100 % , but I know people laugh. &quot; Schwarzenegger says simply , &quot; I never liked the phrase , ' action-comedy. ' I prefer to let the people discover the comedy in the movie , like they do_in the James Bond movies . They don ' t go_to the movie for the comedy , but it ' s there . that ' s what accounted_for my hesitation. &quot; Still , Schwarzenegger believes the humor in &quot; True Lies , &quot; sewn into the fabric of the story , easily bests the gags tossed helter-skelter throughout his earlier effort . And Cameron , Schwarzenegger maintains , is a director who inspires both trust and courage in him -- whether it regards trying comedy again or executing the stunts the movie required . Among the activities that compose just another day at Harry Tasker ' s office are swimming under water with a spreading wall of flames fanning_out on the surface , trying to coax a horse to jump from one building to another and , in the film ' s most outrageous sequence , bouncing around the Miami skyline in a Harrier -- a military jet with helicopter-style capabilities . &quot; You trust him not to lead you to the path of death , &quot; Schwarzenegger deadpans . Cameron maps things out carefully , he says , but &quot; if you screw_up , no one can provide you with safety . If I say I can dive for 100 yards , without breathing , under water , and I screw_up and can only go_for 50 yards , I ' ll be burned to shreds. &quot; That didn ' t happen , but , Schwarzenegger says , &quot; In a scene on the rooftop of the hotel , the horse freaked_out and almost stepped literally over the rooftop . If he had taken one more step , we would ' ve fallen 30 feet to the ground. &quot; Instead , Schwarzenegger emerged from the movie with only the usual amount of scratches and scrapes . Schwarzenegger was hardly the only performer placed in seeming danger . In one sequence , Curtis is rescued from a careening limousine seconds before it plummets into the water around a bombed-out segment of the Seven-Mile Bridge in the Florida Keys . Cameron says , &quot; The trick to that is she was never in the car . She was attached_to the helicopter and the helicopter flew up and matched the speed of the car and dropped her in there . So there was never a way that she could go_off with the car. &quot; And , of course , the filmmakers never actually blew_up the bridge , although , Cameron says with a laugh , &quot; We did ask . We always ask first . On ' T2 , ' we blew_up a building that was a rental . But we asked : ' We ' re gonna rent your building -- and by the way , we ' re gonna blow it up. ' &quot; Of course , not getting permission to blow_up the real_thing just means Cameron and his team of effects technicians have to get creative . All of Cameron ' s prior major-studio directing efforts -- &quot; Aliens , &quot; &quot; The Abyss &quot; and &quot; Terminator 2 &quot; -- have won Oscars for their special_effects , and &quot; True Lies &quot; just might continue the trend . It ' s virtually impossible to tell where the reality ends and the computer imaging begins . &quot; The beauty of this film , the way this film_advances the state_of_the_art is that -- I want to say this in a way that doesn ' t sound like I ' m bragging -- our goal was to combine techniques seamlessly , &quot; Cameron brags , but only a little . &quot; We didn ' t want to create something flashy , like the T-1000 coming_out of the floor . What we tried to do was spend hours and months at computer work stations doing things that are totally invisible in the final film -- where you don ' t know whether you ' re seeing something that happened full-size or miniature , or a composite . There are over 35 composite shots in the final sequence cut_into the real rooftop in Miami , and you can ' t tell the difference . We could composite the shots six or more different ways . Jet pointing this way , jet pointing that way . Jet closer , jet further away . We could put_in different backgrounds . Every single trick I ever learned in visual effects was called into play in that sequence , and some new stuff that hadn ' t been created . It ' s probably the most complicated single effects sequence I ' ve ever done. &quot; All that effort , and Cameron was actually most concerned about other elements in the movie . He requested an extra two weeks of post-production -- not to complete the effects , but to find the perfect_pitch for the film ' s comic moments . &quot; The most important thing was that the tone be right and that the comedy worked , &quot; he says . &quot; I know how to do the action stuff , I knew the effects stuff would work . I wanted a chance to get_it in front of an audience and fine-tune it a little bit . For comedy , that ' s absolutely vital to put the film in front of an audience . that ' s something I didn ' t have to do on ' T2. ' &quot; And , as usually happens when the names James Cameron or Arnold Schwarzenegger are associated with a movie , the budget was pumped up , widely reported to be somewhere between $ 100 million and $ 120 million . &quot; We spent a lot of money , &quot; Cameron says unapologetically . &quot; It ' s like a really good value for a $ 7.50 ticket . that ' s the way anybody should look_at it. &quot; According to Cameron , the reason studios are sheepish about announcing exact budget figures is because &quot; everybody in this business is afraid of failure . And the more afraid you are of failure , the more you program yourself for defeat . They ' re afraid of the consequences -- if the film fails , it fails relative to how much it cost . &quot; But to me , if the film fails , I ' ve failed . So I don ' t care how much the movie cost . It ' s a different mind-set for the filmmaker than it is for the studio . It ' s always gonna be that way. &quot; Nonetheless , Cameron vows he will bring_down costs on his next project for 20th Century Fox , the comic-book adventure &quot; Spider-Man , &quot; and will do so by avoiding working with American unions . &quot; They really stuck it to us , &quot; he says of the unions . &quot; But I ' m not gonna be stuck twice . We tried to negotiate with them and I told them that if we were not_able to come_to terms that I would shoot out of the country next time . So I will shoot out of the country next time. &quot; Cameron ' s movies have come at a price beyond budgets that stretch to the ozone_layer : He has watched his career help splinter three marriages . &quot; It ' s really one of the problems with this business , and with a lot of high-pressure businesses , where in_order to be competitive , you have to invest all_of yourself into it , &quot; he maintains . &quot; And sometimes there ' s not a lot left_over to give to someone else . that ' s a classic problem , and I don ' t know that there ' s a solution to it. &quot; That two of his former wives are also in the film_industry -- producer Gale Ann Hurd and director Katherine Bigelow -- didn ' t seem to help . &quot; I think the thinking there was , if I get someone as driven as myself , then they can ' t criticize me , &quot; he says , then laughs . One aspect of that drive that sets him apart from other action filmmakers is his meticulous attention to the composition of shots , even in stunt scenes . Where many directors are happy just to get the stunt committed to celluloid , Cameron looks both for a spectacular thrill and a carefully sculpted image , which means demanding , nearly impossible camera work . &quot; The crew accuses me of intentionally making the shots hard , &quot; Cameron says with a laugh . &quot; The key grip will come_up_to me and say , ' There ' s probably a way to make this harder , but you just haven ' t found it yet. ' But I try to keep it challenging every single day. &quot; It ' s this desire to &quot; keep it challenging &quot; that contributes to Cameron ' s legendary on-set demeanor , a take-no-prisoners management style that inspired crew T-shirts that read , &quot; You can ' t scare me -- I work for Jim Cameron. &quot; Schwarzenegger says that Cameron ' s ends justifies his means . &quot; He ' s a fanatic about realism . He doesn ' t shy_away_from any scene ; he can do anything . He ' s totally focused -- nothing else exists for him during a movie -- and he expects that of others . I have the ultimate respect for him. &quot; &quot; I would n ' t call my style relaxed , &quot; Cameron says with something approaching understatement . &quot; I walked down to Katherine Bigelow ' s set , ' Strange Days , ' recently , and it ' s like New Age filmmaking , everybody ' s so calm. &quot; He laughs_at the very idea , then defends himself . &quot; I never grew_up in a film culture of any kind : I didn ' t go_to film school , I didn ' t set foot on any other director ' s set -- I just sort of started doing_it . So I ' ve kind of evolved my own method , for good or bad. &quot;</TEXT>
