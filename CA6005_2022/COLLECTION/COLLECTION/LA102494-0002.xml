   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : PROPOSITION 187 ; IS BLACK-LATINO FRICTION A VOTING-BOOTH ISSUE ? ; YES : THE INITIATIVE IS HORRIBLE LEGISLATION , BUT IT ' S STILL A FOCAL POINT FOR LEGITIMATE AFRICAN AMERICAN RESENTMENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Is Proposition 187 being used as a campaign ploy ? Absolutely ! Should it be defeated ? Absolutely ! Will large_numbers of African Americans vote for it , helping ensure its passage ? Absolutely ! Why ? Because the opponents of the ballot measure , including the 70 # 000 protesters who marched a week ago down streets named after Mexicans prominent in Los Angeles history , have ignored long-running tensions between the black and Latino communities . There is fighting in the high_schools and prisons , a tenuous gang truce in Venice , a power struggle in Compton . Each of these problems has strained relations between two groups scrambling for the crumbs . Many black people don ' t care that Proposition 187 is being financed by racist organizations and that minorities are being pitted against one another . If the initiative creates a McCarthyite police_state , the attitude is , &quot; So be it &quot; . Latino community leaders cannot have it both ways . They cannot expect the African American community to embrace their struggle while they disrespect ours . When studies came_out about the lack of Latinos on television and in the news , many of the people interviewed focused more on the number of blacks on the air rather than the bigger problem of who holds the real positions of power . When accusations were made of Latino underrepresentation in U.S. Postal Service hiring , blacks were the focus of the attention , not the federal_government . Attempts to rename Martin_Luther_King Hospital also was another example where Latinos have pitted themselves against African Americans . Now comes Proposition 187 and blacks are being told that they must join with their minority brothers to fight racism ? For many , that ' s a big pill to swallow . While it must be conceded that Ronald Reagan ' s voodoo economics is the true suspect responsible_for tearing the social safety net apart , as Mexican author Carlos Fuentes correctly pointed_out , this is a labor problem . Forty percent of African-American youth are unemployed . When the assertion is made that illegal immigrants do the jobs others would n ' t do_in the first place , the black community is offended . The fact is , when you look_at large metropolitan cities around the country , it is black_women who are doing the cleaning , or working for minuscule factory wages . It is the black_man who is slinging the food , shining the shoes and selling the peanuts . Many say Proposition 187 is not against illegals , it ' s against children . For African Americans , their children are the driving force behind their support of the proposition . Joe Hicks , Executive_Director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Los Angeles , recently discussed the initiative at an NAACP meeting . In articulating his reasons for joining other prominent African American leaders who are against 187 , he spoke on how this immigration hysteria is really premised on bigotry , racism and scape-goating . But is it in fact hysteria , or like the march , a social movement to bring resolution to a deeper problem ? The Latino community wants to have their cake and eat it , too , and black people aren ' t having it . Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina cannot accuse fellow Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke of being racist for trying to resolve the problem of day_laborers , then ask Burke ' s constituents to join hands with her and sing &quot; Kumbaya &quot; against Proposition 187 . The $ 15 billion in federal aid this state receives due_to the presence of illegal immigrants is still taxpayer money . And for those who insist on comparing African Americans with illegal immigrants , that only serves to further alienate potential allies . I will be voting no on Proposition 187 because it truly is not the solution to the problems associated with immigration . But unless opponents of the measure offer other African Americans more_than what they ' ve come_up with , unless they deal with the issues tearing us apart , I will be in the minority , my place_of_origin .</TEXT>
