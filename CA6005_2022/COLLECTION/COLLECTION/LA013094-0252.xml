   <HEADLINE> STATE LAGS IN SEISMIC TESTING OF SCHOOLS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nearly four years after the Loma Prieta earthquake created a new sense of urgency to upgrade school safety , state officials have barely begun a survey to determine whether older public_school buildings , including many damaged in the Northridge quake , should be brought_up to more modern seismic standards . The state also has not inspected California ' s 55 # 000 public_school buildings although officials had warned that a majority of them had &quot; a potential for injury to students and teachers and for major property damage . . . if a moderate or greater earthquake occurs in a heavily populated urban area. &quot; No buildings in the Los Angeles Unified School District collapsed when the 6.6 temblor struck before dawn Jan . 17 . But damage is estimated at $ 500 million to $ 700 million -- much of it in older structures . And officials say non-structural seismic hazards , such_as unsecured cabinets , would have injured many students and teachers if the quake had hit during school hours . Although the quake caused only minimal damage in Orange County , local educators realize that a disaster like Northridge or worse could occur here , especially along the coast where the cities of Seal Beach , Huntington Beach , Costa Mesa and Newport Beach sit directly over the Newport-Inglewood Fault . &quot; Because of our ( schools ' ) proximity to the ( fault ) , we have to take precautionary measures to make_sure that our students are safe , &quot; said Jerry Buchanan , an assistant superintendent at Huntington Beach City School District . He said the district conducted several earthquake stress_tests after the 1989 Loma Prieta temblor to assure the stability of school foundations . &quot; The tests show that the walls are strong and the foundations are stable , so for now , we feel that our schools are very safe -- knock_on wood , &quot; he said . Still , state officials say many school structures may be at risk . &quot; Even though public_schools are very good buildings , we need to sift through the good older buildings and find a_few that are bad , &quot; said Tom Tobin , executive_director of the state Seismic Safety Commission . &quot; Some out there need to be identified and retrofitted &quot; with seismic improvements . Records show that the eight most seriously damaged Los Angeles schools were built_in the 1950s , 1960s and early 1970s -- before seismic safety standards were strengthened after the 1971 Sylmar quake . Four San Fernando Valley schools that have been closed indefinitely also were damaged in the Sylmar quake . The most severely damaged were two Granada Hills campuses -- Kennedy High_School , which was in the final phase of construction when the Sylmar quake hit , and Van Gogh Elementary , which underwent extensive repairs after the 1971 quake . Officials at the financially troubled school district questioned whether seismic surveys or costly retrofitting were necessary at its 855 schools and centers . &quot; It seems to me the buildings have been tested under_fire , &quot; said Douglas Brown , director of facilities services . The Field Act , the school earthquake safety law passed after the Long_Beach quake of 1933 , &quot; doesn ' t guarantee that the building is not going_to be damaged , &quot; Brown said . &quot; It guarantees that the building is going_to retain its integrity and generally not collapse. &quot; Los Angeles Unified school_board member Julie Korenstein , whose San Fernando Valley district includes portions of Northridge , said : &quot; Under the circumstances -- under the worst earthquake in Los Angeles history -- our schools fared very well. &quot; An examination of state and school district records , interviews with seismic safety experts and visits to damaged schools found : * Thousands of schools in Orange and Los Angeles counties and throughout California were built before 1976 , when earthquake safety standards for schools were strengthened . * Districts are required by law to upgrade buildings for seismic safety only during major remodeling or expansions . * Neither the state architect ' s office , which oversees school construction , nor the school district is required to regularly inspect schools for seismic safety hazards . * Much of the damage from the quake was caused by non-structural hazards such_as unsecured cabinets , bookcases and light fixtures , but the school district does not have a state-recommended program to anchor objects that could fall or fly in an earthquake . Officials say they secure light fixtures and objects whenever they make renovations at schools . Brown acknowledged that jammed doors and falling objects posed a potential hazard . &quot; I think people would have been hurt in this quake , had ( schools ) been occupied , because of falling equipment . . . , &quot; he said . &quot; But people could have gotten_out or could have been removed from those structures , without significant or perhaps any loss of life , except through trauma. &quot; Architect Gary McGavin , a member of the Seismic Safety Commission , said some life-threatening hazards could be easily and inexpensively corrected . &quot; We spend all this money on structures and essentially ignore the non-structural things , &quot; he said . &quot; A falling bookcase can kill a kid. &quot; For six decades , the state of California has recognized the importance of providing special seismic protection for schools . The codes for school construction have been more stringent than for most other structures since 1933 , when the Field Act was adopted . In 1959 , 1976 and 1988 , there were major revisions in earthquake-resistance standards for construction of public elementary and secondary_schools , based on new information from damage and collapse observed during earthquakes . Although legislation passed 25 years ago required older unreinforced masonry buildings to be retrofitted , there is no requirement for schools to be brought_up to the latest seismic safety standards unless they undergo major renovation . Nor is there a requirement for schools built before 1976 to tie_down movable objects so they cannot fall or fly during an earthquake . Within a month of Northern California ' s Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989 , then-Assemblywoman Maxine Waters ( D-Los Angeles ) introduced a bill to provide $ 2.75 million to the Office of the State Architect for a review of older_school buildings . The bill , sponsored by the state Seismic Safety Commission , required the state architect to complete a survey of schools by Jan . 1 , 1992 . &quot; A major earthquake will still cause a significant loss of school functions and property damage and may cause injuries to students and teachers in these older_schools , &quot; the commission reported . The bill passed the Assembly but died in the Senate Appropriations Committee . During this same period , the state architect ' s office was urging then-Gov . George Deukmejian to add $ 3.5 million to the state budget_for the first year of a comprehensive seismic review of schools , state colleges and universities , and state offices , according to a budget document submitted two months after Loma Prieta . Of the 55 # 000 projects involving elementary_schools , middle_schools , high_schools and community_colleges , state officials said 19 # 500 were constructed from 1933 to 1959 , and another 20 # 500 were built between 1960 and 1976 . Bringing hazardous public_schools up_to current earthquake standards , officials estimated , could cost $ 2 billion to $ 5 billion statewide -- more_than the $ 1.5-billion program to retrofit the state ' s freeways . In requesting funds for a survey , the state architect ' s office pointed_out , &quot; Over half of our public_school buildings were designed , constructed or structurally improved between enactment of the Field Act in 1933 and 1959 , after which time significant revisions to the building_codes were made . . . . &quot; Building elements designed using early practices and procedures have proven inadequate when subjected_to actual earthquake forces. &quot; The state architect began work_on the survey , spending about $ 85 # 000 of $ 174 # 000 included in the state budget_for the project . But work was halted after the Waters bill died . In an interview last week , State Architect Harry C . Hallenbeck said he has no plans to resume the survey unless the Legislature orders it or his staff_members who have examined some quake-damaged Los Angeles schools find problems in older facilities . &quot; There are priorities , &quot; Hallenbeck said . &quot; Since the Field Act in_general is performing pretty well , it ' s hard for us to put this to the highest priority . . . . &quot; Whether this earthquake will demonstrate that the older buildings suffered versus the newer ones , it ' s just too early to tell. &quot; Waters , now a congresswoman , said she still believes the statewide survey is necessary . &quot; I ' ve always had a fear we would experience an earthquake and schoolchildren would be sitting in unsafe buildings , &quot; she said last week . &quot; I thought it was important to do some advance planning and use some resources to ensure the schools ' safety. &quot; Four of the major earthquakes in Southern California this century -- Long_Beach in 1933 , Sylmar in 1971 , Whittier in 1987 and Northridge this year -- struck either before or after school hours . Records show that there are 10 # 877 buildings in the Los Angeles Unified School District -- and that 9 # 457 were built before 1970 , and 424 before 1930 . But the heaviest period of construction was the 1950s and 1960s , when 6 # 161 buildings were erected . Only 1 # 400 buildings have been built since 1980 . A survey of several Orange County districts showed that most schools were built before the 1971 Sylmar quake . For example , Fullerton High , one of the county ' s oldest_schools , has buildings dating_from the late 1930s . Additions built onto the original structure were constructed from the 1940s through the ' 60s and adhered to the codes at those times . Those building_codes , however , lag behind today ' s stricter standards . In the Huntington Beach Union High_School District , five of seven schools were built before 1970 . In Los Angeles County , the most seriously damaged schools in the Northridge quake are likely to be closed at least several weeks , according to school officials . And officials said part of Kennedy High_School in Granada Hills may need to be demolished . State inspectors found a three-inch fissure in the earth snaking its way 200 yards from the baseball field through the girls ' locker_room , across a concrete patio and through the boys ' locker_room . Hardest hit at the school was the three-story administration building , with two floors of classrooms . Large cracks were visible all_over the building . Ceiling tiles had come_down . Windows broke . And outside , one overhead panel in a concrete arcade had slipped down several inches . McGavin of the Seismic Safety Commission said the administration building could have collapsed &quot; if the strong shaking had lasted a_few seconds longer. &quot; At Van Gogh Elementary School , which was heavily damaged in the Sylmar quake , much of the recent destruction was similar to that in 1971 , said Donald Jepcott , a structural engineer examining schools for the National Science Foundation . But he said some of the damage did not appear as severe this time . For example , the columns supporting an outdoor eating pavilion were displaced more_than a foot in 1971 , but reinforced columns held_up well in this month ' s quake . But school officials said the ground beneath the school is so unstable that the site may need to be abandoned . The end of a covered walkway between the eating pavilion and the auditorium struck the auditorium wall , creating a large crack at a side_entrance . Many other cracks crisscrossed the floors of buildings . At Frost Middle_School in Granada Hills , Principal Jay Peterman said : &quot; It looks beautiful from the outside but it got hit pretty hard on the inside. &quot; The school opened in 1969 and is a split level . Where a wooden column buckled beneath its canopy , an entrance to the building was rendered unusable . Elsewhere , metal_screws were pulled from the bottoms of the columns supporting a covered walkway that was raised several inches at one end by the quake . The most immediate danger to students , had they been in school during the quake , would have been items falling_off shelves , from ceilings and out of cabinets , Peterman said . In a storage_room for the chemistry_labs , bottles of chemicals fell and broke . The textbook storage_room was thigh-deep in books . &quot; If someone had been in there , they would ' ve been severely injured , &quot; he said , adding that administrators are considering ways to restrain items on shelves . Another concern , the principal said , was that heavy air conditioning units and water_heaters mounted above classrooms were thrown around in the quake . Underlying the capricious nature of the quake was the strikingly different impact it had_on two identical two-story buildings erected in the 1920s at San Fernando Elementary School . &quot; One we can ' t use , &quot; said Assistant Principal Ted Johnson . &quot; It has major structural damage . . . . And the other one , 20 feet to the east of it and its exact twin , has got some plaster cracks . that ' s the extent of it. &quot; In addition , two bungalows -- in_use at the school for about 30 years -- fell_off their 18-inch-high wooden foundations and two more partially fell off , but officials said they remained structurally intact . The building that officials said fared the best was the newest on campus , the cafeteria , built_in the late 1970s . It had only minor cosmetic problems . Outside the San Fernando Valley , one of the most severely damaged campuses was Marvin Avenue Elementary School , just a_few hundred yards south of the buckled lanes of the Santa Monica Freeway at Fairfax Avenue . Two large , two-story classroom buildings are uninhabitable because of structural damage , said Principal Anna McLine . The worst-hit building , which looks_out_on the freeway , is webbed with cracks . A number of classrooms , including a computer lab , remain sealed because their doors were jammed shut by the quake . The door to the storage_area where administrators had stashed 400 gallons of bottled water for use in emergencies also was jammed shut . McLine , who said she believes Marvin was built_in the early- to mid-1960s , speculated that the school ' s location might have played an important part in the damage . She cited the proximity of the crippled freeway and a collapsed parking structure on the grounds of Kaiser-Permanente Medical_Center . &quot; They ' re all_in a straight_line , &quot; she added . Los Angeles school officials said they cannot eliminate a $ 600-million backlog of deferred maintenance , such_as leaky roofs , let alone commission a seismic survey or retrofitting of older_school buildings . &quot; We ' ve been in a triage mode , patching the holes year to year . . . , &quot; said school_board member Mark Slavkin . Public support for increased school funding has been hard to secure , Slavkin said , noting last year ' s defeat of a measure to lower the passage requirement for school bonds from a two-thirds to a simple majority . After the Sylmar quake , the Los Angeles school_board sought approval of earthquake safety bonds . The measures were defeated twice . But Los Angeles city voters in 1990 approved a $ 376-million bond measure for seismic safety improvements to bridges and municipal buildings . Slavkin , whose west San Fernando Valley district was hard hit by the quake , said : &quot; There is no way that this disaster can be looked_at as an indictment of current school safety rules. &quot; But , he added , &quot; every effort should be made to ensure that these facilities are at the highest level of safety and security for kids. &quot; While the state architect ' s office and Los Angeles city school officials say they lack the money to survey older_schools , at least one school district -- Berkeley -- undertook an evaluation of its schools . Although all_of the schools met Field Act requirements , five of the district ' s 17 schools were found to be potentially unsafe . One had to be permanently closed , two are closed temporarily while undergoing retrofitting , and two others are scheduled for retrofit work . Berkeley voters passed a $ 158-million school bond issue in June , 1992 , to pay the tab . &quot; School buildings built before 1976 should be examined , &quot; said Arrieta Chakos , legislative liaison for Berkeley schools . &quot; For us , the Loma Prieta earthquake was a wake-up call. &quot; Times staff writers Matt Lait and Lily Dizon and correspondent Richard Core contributed to this report .</TEXT>
