   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; U.S.-JAPAN TRADE ACCORDS MEAN BUSINESS FOR CALIFORNIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The milestone trade agreements reached between the United States and Japan on Saturday will open major opportunities for American companies , particularly those from California , industry officials and economists said Sunday . But it is not guaranteed that U.S. companies will ultimately gain significant market inroads , they added . Foreign sales almost surely will rise considerably in the fields in which agreement was reached : insurance , flat glass and government procurement of telecommunications and medical equipment . That is because current foreign sales are so low and Japanese demand is so strong . Tokyo has promised foreign firms improved access to markets in these areas , markets that are worth a total of nearly $ 340 billion . The trade deal is also expected to prove a boost for the California economy , which is more heavily dependent_on foreign trade than many other states . California is home to many of the firms that could benefit directly , such_as Beckman Instruments , a Fullerton maker of medical equipment . &quot; A lot of the high-tech stuff that is desired in Japan is made in California , &quot; said Ed Rozynski , vice_president for global strategy and analysis at the Health Industry Manufacturing Assn. , an industry group based in Washington . A wide range of cutting-edge California companies involved in such fields as information technology and multimedia would also gain as the Japanese become more familiar_with U.S. telecommunications makers and their know-how . &quot; In the emerging markets of the telecommunications business , California is going_to become a major player , &quot; said Tahir Andrabi , professor of international economics at Pomona College in Claremont . &quot; Any kind of move ( to expand the telecommunications market ) is definitely going_to help. &quot; But through a determined refusal to agree to anything smacking of &quot; numerical targets , &quot; Japanese negotiators have ensured that much of the burden of breaking_into the Japanese market will remain on foreign firms . How Japan implements the agreed changes , how much effort American companies exert and how persistently the U.S._government monitors the market-opening measures will all have a major impact , according to U.S. business_executives in Tokyo . &quot; From what I ' ve seen so far , this is an agreement we can build_on , &quot; said William Farrell , executive_director of the American Chamber_of_Commerce in Japan . &quot; The industries have got_to find_out what opportunities are open_to them and get cracking on it. &quot; Farrell noted that while the agreements were reached between Tokyo and Washington , their provisions apply to all foreign firms doing business in Japan . U.S. firms looking_for new business thus must worry not only about Japanese but also European and other foreign competitors , he noted . &quot; We ' re not expecting the dawn of a new era as of tomorrow morning , &quot; Farrell said . &quot; We ' re going to have to work_on this. &quot; Similar caution was voiced by others . &quot; Personally , I think there are some loopholes in all this , &quot; said Robert Orr , director of government relations for Nippon Motorola Ltd. , which earlier this year was at the center of a bitter dispute over access to Japan ' s cellular_telephone market . That argument was settled in March_on terms pleasing to Motorola and Washington . Orr said that while there is hope that Saturday ' s agreements will open &quot; substantial new opportunities &quot; in Japan ' s telecommunications market , this will depend_on &quot; vigorous U.S._government enforcement. &quot; These agreements , by themselves , are not likely to quickly reduce the U.S. trade_deficit with Japan , which totaled $ 60 billion last year . This is because they cover fairly narrow fields and because sales growth will be incremental . Indeed , the dollar fell against the yen in early Asian trading today on the view that the agreements will not do much to reduce Japan ' s massive trade surplus with the United States , although the greenback later recovered after Japan ' s central_bank bought the U.S. currency . But Washington chose its priority areas partly because of the long-term potential for growth . The government procurement market in telecommunications and medical equipment &quot; is set to explode in growth , &quot; said a U.S. diplomat in Tokyo , who spoke on condition he not be identified by name . &quot; We just want to make_sure we ' re part of it. &quot; By sector , key opportunities for foreign firms look_like this : * Telecommunications . The total annual telecommunications_equipment market in Japan is about $ 18 billion and rapidly growing . The new agreements cover $ 2 billion in annual procurement by government_agencies and $ 9 billion annually in purchases by Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone , which is two-thirds government-owned . Foreign firms will have a better chance to break_into these markets by getting involved with potential buyers during the design stage , when technical specifications for bids are drawn_up . * Medical equipment . The overall size of the Japanese medical technology market was $ 13 billion in 1992 . As Japan ' s population ages , this figure is expected to rise rapidly . The government market , covered by a new agreement , is about $ 2.6 billion . Foreign firms will now have access to lists of the top 10 medical technology products planned for purchase during the year by each government hospital . The agreement will especially benefit firms selling expensive , high-quality equipment that is competitive on an &quot; overall greatest value &quot; basis . Under previous bidding rules , such equipment routinely lost out_to inferior but lower-priced Japanese products . * Insurance . Japan has the world ' s second-largest insurance market , with about $ 320 billion in annual premium income . The agreement in this sector primarily concerns deregulation , which should make_it easier for U.S. companies to win market share by offering new products or reduced prices . It will take a long_time before foreign firms win a big share of this market , but even a small share is a lot of money . U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor said Saturday that the U.S. industry predicts the agreement can lead to increased foreign premium earnings of &quot; nearly $ 1 billion over the next several years. &quot; * Flat glass . This market for glass used in automobiles and construction is worth $ 4.5 billion annually . Saturday ' s agreement covered only a set of principles to provide improved access for foreign firms . The two sides agreed to try to reach a final agreement based on those principles within 30 days . U.S. firms now hold about 1 % of this market . The agreements pleased U.S. companies , many of whom have failed to crack the Japanese market despite success in other nations . While U.S. medical equipment and technology firms claim 50 % of worldwide sales , their share_in Japan is only 22 % , according to industry statistics . The results were &quot; better than our expectations , &quot; said Rozynski at the Health Industry Manufacturing Assn . As a result , U.S. medical equipment sales will probably increase by $ 500 million over three years , and the 10 # 000 jobs tied to U.S. medical exports could grow substantially , he said . Rozynski said that Japan ' s health minister will not only ask the country ' s national hospitals to purchase more foreign products -- as U.S. manufacturers had suggested -- but he will also make the same request of the university teaching hospitals . &quot; The university hospitals are where the new doctors are trained and where they are introduced to medical technology , &quot; he said . The accord comes as Orange County ' s Beckman Instruments , which primarily makes medical diagnostic equipment , expects Japanese demand for medical technology to increase as that nation seeks to become more efficient in delivering health_care to an aging population . &quot; This should help boost our international sales , &quot; said Beckman spokeswoman Jeanie Herbert , whose company relies_on foreign markets for more_than half of its total sales . U.S. insurers are expected to do_well because their experience in the rough-and-tumble domestic marketplace has given them a competitive edge over Japanese rivals accustomed to a more stable and highly profitable environment , said economist Sean Mooney at the Insurance Information Institute , a New York-based industry group . &quot; A more open Japanese insurance industry would not only benefit Japanese consumers , but it would also be a benefit to U.S. companies that have dealt in a competitive ( domestic ) market for years , &quot; Mooney said . &quot; If we were to get a 5 % share , that is a significant &quot; amount . A key point of negotiating success for the United States , which had demanded a &quot; results-oriented &quot; deal , was that Japan agreed that these changes should lead to &quot; progress in the value and share &quot; of foreign goods and services in the Japanese market . This goes beyond what Japan was willing to agree to earlier this year . But Japan , for its part , succeeded in avoiding any firm guarantees tied to specific figures for_sales volume or market share . This keeps the pressure on U.S. firms to take a major share of the responsibility for bringing_about increased sales . Holley reported from Tokyo and Sanchez from Los Angeles . * MARKET IMPACT : How the dollar and stocks reacted to the trade accord . D3 The Trade Deal Key elements of the groundbreaking U.S.-Japan trade agreement reached Saturday : * Telecommunications : Japan will open_to foreign manufacturers the process by which its government purchases telecommunications_equipment . Size of market : $ 11 billion . * Medical equipment : Japan will allow fair bidding and provide a complaint mechanism for foreign firms that believe they have been treated unfairly in government purchases of medical equipment . Size of market : $ 2.6 billion . * Insurance : Japan will reform its insurance regulatory system , introduce unspecified liberalizing measures and strengthen its antitrust policies . Size of market : $ 320 billion . * Glass : Japan will open its flat-glass business to foreign producers . Japan also agreed to promote greater use of insulated glass and safety_glass , products in which U.S. companies are considered leaders . Size of market : $ 4.5 billion .</TEXT>
