   <HEADLINE> HOME ENTERTAINMENT ; RETAILERS MIFFED AT SONY OVER STREISAND TAPE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The exclusive deal cut by Sony and Blockbuster Video for the new Barbra Streisand concert tape -- giving Blockbuster an extra song that other retailers won ' t have -- has made the competition furious . Tower Video , which has 109 stores , has canceled its order for &quot; Barbra -- the Concert , &quot; which comes_out Tuesday . So has Philadelphia ' s Movies Unlimited , and other retailers are considering joining the boycott or taking other punitive action . They hate the deal because it gives customers another reason to shop_at Blockbuster , already the industry heavyweight with more_than 2 # 000 stores . They ' re also afraid that this may happen again with some_other video . They liken it to other sorts of exclusives that favor one outlet over another , such_as McDonald ' s buying the rights to sell old MCA / Universal videos at a cut_rate . What ' s on &quot; Barbra -- the Concert &quot; is her recent HBO special . Buy_it at Blockbuster , though , and the tape includes an extra song , &quot; What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life ? &quot; The suggested list_price is $ 30 , but most stores will probably sell it for $ 20- $ 25 . According to distributor sources , about 200 # 000 cassettes have been shipped -- a lot for music videos , which don ' t sell at anywhere near the volume of motion_pictures . But no copies of the Streisand title will be sold at Tower . &quot; We don ' t want to shortchange our customers , &quot; Tower Vice_President John Thrasher said . &quot; We don ' t want to sell edited product if the unedited product is available elsewhere and we can ' t sell it. &quot; He was particularly critical of Sony , the distributor . &quot; What they ' re doing is a slap in the face to the other retailers , &quot; Thrasher said . &quot; We ' ve supported their projects in the past . It ' s totally unfair for them to do this. &quot; The Blockbuster deal may come_back to haunt Sony , he hinted : &quot; We don ' t have to carry Sony product . They have tapes other_than the Streisand tape they need us to sell . I ' m not saying we won ' t carry Sony product , but when they need us , we may_not be there. &quot; There isn ' t likely to be widespread support for Tower ' s course of action , but many retailers may follow the lead of Palmer Video , an 86-store chain based in Union , N.J. &quot; We ' re not going_to give this title the kind of promotional support we ' d normally give it , &quot; said Palmer Vice_President Peter Margo . Hearing that other stores might not carry the tape was music to the ears of Ron Castell , senior_vice_president of Blockbuster . &quot; A boycott helps us , &quot; he said . &quot; It means that if I ' m a Tower customer and I can ' t get_it at Tower , I ' m going_to get_it at Blockbuster. &quot; What those customers will find at Blockbuster are prominent displays of other Streisand product -- old movies in the video outlets and CDs and audiotapes in the company ' s music stores . &quot; We ' re going to promote all her music and movies , &quot; Castell said . &quot; People who want the new tape are likely to want her other tapes and CDs . This isn ' t about selling that one tape but selling a lot of other product too. &quot; Tower is boycotting only the video . It will carry both the CD and audiotape of the concert and the $ 50 laser version , which comes_out Oct . 4 -- and will include that extra song . Video Sales Movies that premiere on home video in the rental market usually aren ' t repriced for the sales market until six to 12 months have gone_by . But Warner plans to reduce &quot; Grumpy Old_Men , &quot; featuring Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau , to $ 20 on Nov . 2 , only four months after its video launch . Just a_few years ago , the sales market was a small , secondary phase of a movie ' s video life . But that has changed , with video sales booming as marketing techniques have become more sophisticated and more outlets have opened_up . The movies-for-sale market has expanded so_much that even some old films , backed by shrewd marketing , can sell as well as recent hits . For instance , FoxVideo ' s &quot; An Affair to Remember &quot; is a big hit -- again . The company shipped 1.6 million copies of the 1957 Cary Grant tear-jerker , repriced at $ 10 , making_it an impulse-buy item . A spokesman said the company is planning to ship 500 # 000 more , which may be needed when the remake starring Warren Beatty and Annette Bening comes_out next month . MPI ' s massive marketing push_on &quot; Hondo , &quot; the 1953 John Wayne Western that just premiered on home video at $ 20 , should make_it a big seller . If the movie had come_out five years ago , it would have been priced at about $ 30 and would not have been bolstered by a major marketing campaign . The result would have been a fraction of the business . What ' s New On Video &quot; Naked Gun 33 1 / 3 : The Final Insult &quot; ( Paramount ) . With Leslie Nielsen back for the third time as the bumbling cop , there ' s a high quota of laughs , particularly in the spoofs of the &quot; The Untouchables &quot; movie and the Academy Awards ceremony . For some fans , though , the presence of supporting actor O . J . Simpson may be a bring-down . &quot; Being Human &quot; ( Warner ) . This one came and went from theaters so fast you may never have heard of it . Robin Williams plays five different characters of questionable courage in various stages of history . He ' s not the manic Williams his fans love but very subdued . This confusing , poorly written movie is easily the worst of his career -- even worse than &quot; Toys. &quot; &quot; Mother ' s Boys &quot; ( Miramax ) . Jamie Lee Curtis plays a psychotic who abandons her husband and children and then tries to reclaim them three years later . More silly than scary , it steals from other thrillers , among them &quot; Fatal Attraction. &quot; It ' s surprising to see a quality actress like Vanessa Redgrave co-starring in such a grade-B movie .</TEXT>
