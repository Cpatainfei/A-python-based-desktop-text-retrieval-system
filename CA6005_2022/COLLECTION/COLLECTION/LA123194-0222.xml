   <TEXT> You don ' t need an invitation , you don ' t need a date , and you can drink as much virtual champagne as you want and still wake_up without a headache . Come New Year ' s Eve , thousands of people around the world will be logging_on the Internet for an evening of talking , flirting and generally being silly with counterparts in New York , San Francisco , Rome , London and a host of other cities -- without ever leaving their living_rooms . The global New Year ' s party comes_in two main flavors -- face to face and virtual . Those with Internet accounts can connect to a chat line and a virtual party or two . And in at least seven cities , Internet users will gather_in person to dress_up , get_down and , in between choruses of &quot; Auld Lang Syne , &quot; pull_up a keyboard and chat with the folks about how their New Year ' s party went or is going , depending_on the time_zone they tap into . At the Other Side Cafe in Boston , the cyber-party will feature dancing , drinking and much digital tomfoolery . &quot; What we ' re trying to do is have some very high-tech things and some very low-tech ones . It seems to be that all that ' s been reported lately in the media is about ' the dark side of cyberspace , ' &quot; said Art Turner . &quot; We ' re going to have live , friendly people right there to help them get started , &quot; said Turner , a landscape_architect in Ithaca , N.Y. , who helped organize the global party . In San Francisco , party-goers at the Noe Valley Ministry plan to tap into celebrations around the world . &quot; It ' s going_to be awesome , &quot; said organizer Cynsa Bonorris . &quot; we ' ll just start in the east and work our way across the planet , time_zone by time_zone , just a huge wave across the globe. &quot; So far , she knows of private gatherings in Copenhagen , Rome , Hawaii and Los Angeles .</TEXT>
