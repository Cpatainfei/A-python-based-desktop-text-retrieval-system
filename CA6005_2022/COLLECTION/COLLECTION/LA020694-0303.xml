   <HEADLINE> COLUMN ONE ; INS ' LIFERS ' LOCKED_UP IN LIMBO ; THEY HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME BUT ARE CONSIDERED TOO DANGEROUS FOR RELEASE IN THE U.S. THEIR HOME COUNTRIES WON ' T TAKE THEM BACK . SO A GROUP OF IMMIGRANT FELONS LANGUISH BEHIND BARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The fine points of federal immigration law , with its statutes and technical revisions , are lost on Nirayo Tirfe , a former Ethiopian guerrilla once granted political asylum in the United States . His understanding is more visceral , coming as it does from being locked_up indefinitely in a maximum security prison without any remaining criminal charges or even a sentence to serve . The U.S._government tried to deport Tirfe after a marijuana conviction , but his country refused to take him back . Now he is stuck behind bars , a &quot; lifer &quot; in Immigration and Naturalization Service slang . Like scores of other illegal immigrants , Tirfe is a man without a country , an undesirable under U.S. law who has become an international pariah . Immigration law says they have committed crimes ranging from drug offenses to murder that make them too dangerous to release here . They have slipped into a void created by global politics and Congress ' desire to get_tough on immigrants who turn_to crime . The INS estimates that nationwide there are no more_than 100 detainees who fall_into this category . But over the next few years , hundreds more are expected to finish their prison_terms , only to be warehoused by the INS . A little-noticed legal fine point , included in the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1990 , controls Tirfe ' s fate and handcuffs government officials required to keep him and others like him indefinitely behind bars . The law says these so-called &quot; non-releasable aggravated felons &quot; remain a danger to society -- even though they have completed their sentences in state or federal prisons . &quot; There is a problem that we feel as an agency -- having somebody locked_up forever and ever , &quot; said John Simon , INS deputy assistant commissioner for deportation and detention in Washington . &quot; We are trying to deal with it in a humane way. &quot; Tirfe is told not to think_of his time at the Orleans Parish Prison in New Orleans -- and before that at an INS detention center in Arizona -- as punishment , but as an administrative &quot; hold &quot; -- one that has stretched beyond a year . There is no relief in_sight . &quot; I ' m not dangerous to society , &quot; Tirfe said from Mississippi ' s Hancock County Jail , where he had been moved temporarily so that he could speak_to a reporter . &quot; I didn ' t kill nobody . I didn ' t rob nobody . They lock me up forever because of these three lousy joints. &quot; Like Tirfe , most detainees have been convicted under the country ' s zero-tolerance drugs laws , and some of the offenses involve relatively small amounts of drugs . Others are murderers , armed robbers and rapists . They all are illegal immigrants , including some , like Tirfe , who were allowed into the country but never completed the legal immigration process . An immigration judge has ordered each of them deported , but if the order cannot be carried_out , they must be locked_up until another nation agrees to accept them . That could take months , or years , or it might not happen at all . The U.S._government pays the cost . The list of such prisoners is growing so quickly that the agency has notified its offices throughout the country that &quot; on a very select basis &quot; they may send them to prisons and jails in the South . Here , it is cheapest to house them -- the going rate in county and parish jails is $ 45 a day -- and the locals look_upon the INS detainees as a cash crop . Prison construction , too , is booming . &quot; We don ' t always agree with the INS holding them , &quot; said Hancock County Sheriff Ronnie Peterson as he strolled through the jail he runs in Bay St . Louis . &quot; But we like the money. &quot; * Although the number of such detainees is relatively small , the INS worries about those in the pipeline : inmates from Vietnam , the former Soviet_Union , Cambodia , Laos , Iraq and Ethiopia who are serving state or federal prison_terms . Depending_on the currents of international politics , these countries and a_few others have generally refused to take_back their criminal citizens . The INS says other countries -- such_as Nigeria and Jamaica -- routinely engineer excessive delays . &quot; It ' s simple , &quot; said INS spokesman Duke Austin in Washington . &quot; Countries don ' t want bad people back. &quot; ( The U.S. repatriates American criminals deported by other countries. ) A check with state corrections departments in California , Texas , Florida , Illinois and New York , and the federal Bureau of Prisons , shows that as_many as 900 prisoners from these nations might one day become INS &quot; lifers. &quot; This does not include more_than 5 # 000 Cubans who are serving state_prison terms or being indefinitely held by the INS in local jails at U.S. expense . They have been the subject of on-again , off-again negotiations with Cuban President Fidel Castro . &quot; We ' re looking_at the Vietnamese , because we think that is going_to be the core population , &quot; said John B.Z. Caplinger , INS district director in New Orleans , which has jurisdiction over detainees in Louisiana , Mississippi , Tennessee , Arkansas and Kentucky . &quot; Right now , this ag ( aggravated ) felon thing is so new , we are still bouncing the ball to see which way it is going_to go. &quot; Caplinger said the law ' s intractability has created a Kafkaesque scenario where different branches of the U.S._government are playing tug of war over the fate of at least three INS prisoners who have been promised new identities under the federal witness protection program . Their criminal histories make the prisoners &quot; aggravated felons. &quot; But if they are deported , the presumption is they would be killed . &quot; I ' ve got prosecutors calling me every day , &quot; Caplinger said . &quot; I ' ve got people who testified against ( former Panamanian strongman Manuel ) Noriega who can ' t be released . that ' s how difficult this is. &quot; Citing policy , a spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service declined to confirm or deny any information about participants in the witness protection program . The backgrounds of most other detainees are relatively mundane . Abed El-Abed , a 35-year-old Palestinian born_on the West_Bank , entered the United States by walking_out_of New York ' s John F . Kennedy Airport when he was making a stopover in 1977 , leaving_behind his luggage and a Jordanian passport . Later , he opened a convenience_store in Houston , got_married and fathered four children in the United States . In 1985 , he was busted for selling heroin and served nearly seven years in federal prison in Texas . A positive drug test forced officials to revoke his immigration bond ; he has been held by the INS at the federal detention center in Oakdale , La. , for more_than 17 months . The cost of his detention , according to prison officials , is $ 25 # 000 a year . Jordan has refused to accept him , as have other countries he asked : Italy , Germany , Greece , Sweden , Denmark , Austria and Spain . El-Abed said that if he cannot be freed in the United States , he would like to go_home . &quot; I prove to them that I am Palestinian and they still don ' t believe I am Palestinian , &quot; he said . INS officials said that may be , but they will continue to list him as a Jordanian . There is no Palestinian state , much less one that would take him back . Tirfe , the former Ethiopian guerrilla who fought the government for an independent Eritrea , also has nobody to come_to his aid . According to a written INS analysis placed in his file , his two convictions for simple marijuana possession are analogous to an aggravated felony under federal law . But Tirfe , 43 , has no lawyer to challenge this argument , no money to hire one , and no hope of getting_out . Ethiopia will not accept him and neither will anyone else . &quot; I ' d rather stay three years in state_prison than one year here , &quot; he said of his cell at the Orleans Parish Prison in New Orleans . &quot; I ' d rather take_a_chance to go_back home , even though my life is in danger. &quot; Sheriff Charles Foti Jr. , who has run the 5 # 000-bed Orleans Parish Prison since 1974 , confirmed that the non-deportable prisoners have been kept_in lock-down 24 hours a day . He refuses to allow reporters to talk to inmates at the facility or to see the conditions in which they are held . But asked about complaints by Tirfe and other detainees of being shackled every time they leave their cell and of being denied food , Foti snapped : &quot; These are felons who are security risks , who demand maximum security . And while we are providing a service for the INS , that is how they are kept. &quot; Said Tirfe : &quot; They treat us like animals. &quot; Unlike the Cubans who arrived in the United States 14 years ago as part of the Mariel boat lift -- and who won the right to an annual parole board review after rioting at federal prisons in Oakdale and Atlanta in 1987 -- the non-deportables have no higher authority to whom to appeal . The mechanism does not exist in the law . &quot; The only thing I have left is my sanity , for now , &quot; said Iraqi Khaled Najib , 33 , who served four years in federal prison for selling cocaine and is approaching eight months in INS custody at the federal detention center in Oakdale . &quot; When I did my time , I had something to look_forward to . But this is torture. &quot; &quot; It ' s very depressing , mental torture , &quot; said Vi-Kiet Giang , who served 10 years in Idaho state_prison for stabbing his fiancee to death in 1983 , just a_few months after the U.S. Navy rescued them from a rickety boat in international waters off Vietnam . When he was paroled from prison -- and Vietnam refused to take him back -- Giang was sent to the Orleans Parish Prison . Because Giang committed his crime before completing his legal admissions process , he may_not be released on bond . The law , insisted Simon of the INS , ties the agency ' s hands . &quot; The intent of the law was good , but I don ' t think Congress realized what a bind they were putting us in , &quot; he said . &quot; And what you have to understand is if you have just one guy who knows that he has nothing to lose , that he may never get_out , that ' s a ( potential security ) problem. &quot; So far , three internal INS proposals to give the agency more discretion to release aggravated felons remain just that . Another that could be submitted to Congress as a technical amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act is under review by the INS_general counsel . But some mechanisms exist to persuade nations to take their citizens back . The problem , according to the INS , is that they are rarely used . &quot; As the most extreme step , the State_Department is supposed to stop issuing immigrant visas to those countries , &quot; said INS spokesman Austin . &quot; But that has never happened , not to anyone ' s knowledge . They just don ' t do_it . They are not willing to do_it . And the foreign countries know it . So they say , ' Why should we bring them back here ? ' &quot; A State_Department official , who asked not to be identified , said the U.S._government did briefly stop issuing immigrant visas to Cubans after the Mariel boat lift . &quot; There would be serious ramifications in this country to doing something like that , &quot; he said . &quot; Who would you be hurting ? You ' re talking_about family members of immigrants here . These are not people coming_to Disneyland or coming_to buy goods. &quot; Even when countries reach agreement on the repatriation of criminals , the best-laid plans can go awry . In the first INS_operation of its kind , the agency chartered a plane in December to return 74 male and nine female prisoners to Nigeria , a cheaper alternative than flying them commercially . The detainees were held at Oakdale , in jails throughout Louisiana and in Miami . The Nigerian government finally issued travel documents for them . The operation took months to plan . But when the Royal West 727 landed to refuel in Cape Verde , Nigerian authorities ordered the pilot to fly into Lagos -- where the U.S._government refuses to allow American aircraft to land for security reasons -- instead of Ibadan , the negotiated destination . While negotiations between officials in Washington and Lagos continued , the refueling stop stretched past five hours and the prisoners , who were shackled , staged a revolt . The leader had managed to slip his hands in front of his body , and strode to the front of the aircraft to encourage the others to make their move . Before order was restored , officials said , INS agents were bitten , shoved and kicked . When the plane landed in Lagos , authorities there turned_out the runway lights and tried to arrest the INS officials for bringing the Nigerian prisoners back . Finally , the prisoners were accepted . INS headquarters later issued awards lauding the bravery of the 11 officers who made the trip . * Soviet immigrant Alexander Okner ' s probation_officer in Santa Monica describes him as a career criminal who has committed despicable acts . &quot; After he serves the longest possible prison sentence as allowable under the law , probation_officer is hopeful that the immigration service can find some means by which this country no longer needs to accept his kind of refugee , &quot; the officer was moved to write in her report . But unlike Giang , who murdered his fiancee , or even Tirfe , convicted of possessing marijuana , Okner is not an aggravated felon under immigration law . That is why INS officials in New Orleans refused to accept him in Orleans Parish Prison , where agency officials in Los Angeles recently asked that he be moved . Okner ' s most recent felony -- the kidnaping and rape of a Santa Monica woman -- took_place in 1982 . This crime , for which Okner served eight years in state_prison , was not included in the immigration act ' s aggravated felon provision until 1990 -- and the law is not retroactive . But INS officials in Los Angeles consider him such a threat to society that they have jailed him at the federal detention center at Terminal Island since October , 1992 . They say they would like nothing better than to remove him from the United States , where he has lived for 17 years . But they say their efforts have been stymied . Russia refuses to take him , as does the Ukraine , the former Soviet republic where he was born . Israel , where he applied for admittance because of his Jewish heritage , has also declined . In October , the INS took the extraordinary step of booking him and an immigration agent on an Aeroflot flight to Moscow , without travel documents . Russian authorities refused to let Okner in . &quot; I ' m trying to get_out of here , &quot; Okner said from Terminal Island . &quot; If I ' m such a menace to society , and they don ' t believe that I ' ve been rehabilitated , then deport me . This is a life sentence . &quot; I hope one day they will get me out of here , dead or alive . I ' ve been promised employment ( in Los Angeles ) . I want to marry my girlfriend , help my parents , &quot; he said . &quot; If they think I will rape someone again , please make me a woman . Have the government pay_for it . I ' m serious. &quot; Okner provided a letter from a psychiatrist who has treated him that said he &quot; would pose no hazard whatsoever &quot; if released . Still , INS officials in Los Angeles say they have no intention of releasing Okner , despite a series of motions and lawsuits he has filed , despite his claim that he has changed and despite a desperate plea from his mother and father , who now suffers from cancer . He has convictions for assault_and_battery , assault with a deadly weapon , extortion , kidnaping and rape . He has admitted using drugs . INS officials also suggested that the unsolved slaying of Okner ' s fiancee in 1981 has been weighed in their decision to keep him behind bars , although he has not been charged . They say they will hold him &quot; forever , &quot; if it comes_to that . &quot; Los Angeles has the strictest detention policy in the U.S. , &quot; said Donald Looney , INS deputy district director in Los Angeles . One reason behind this stance , INS officials indicated , is the case of Bela Marko , an illegal immigrant from Hungary with a long criminal_record . The INS came under_fire because Marko had been released from INS custody before he and Los Angeles Police Detective Russell Kuster killed each other in an October , 1990 , shootout . Like today ' s non-releasables , Marko ' s homeland had refused to take him back .</TEXT>
