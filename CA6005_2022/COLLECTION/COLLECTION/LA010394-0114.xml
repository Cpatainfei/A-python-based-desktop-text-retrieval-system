   <HEADLINE> ALASKA PROCEEDS WITH KILLING WOLVES -- TO A HOWL OF PROTEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the great spruce forests south of here , the state of Alaska has begun killing wolves by the dozens -- trying to reduce predators and save caribou for human hunters . To the displeasure of almost everyone involved , the wolves are being slain in the worst of ways , causing suffering and social disruption among these highly organized and rare creatures . Political compromise and worry about national reaction have brought Alaska to this unhappy pass . A hotblooded clash between hunters , environmentalists and animal protectionists is now also a tale about the fickle attention of the news media and the tortuous maneuverings by both sides to shape public_opinion . As of this week , 65 wolves , mostly young animals , have been slain by Alaska Department of Fish and Game trappers . The animals are lured by the bait of moose and caribou carcasses and then choked in preset neck snares . If they don ' t die in the snares , they are shot to death on the spot . The government ' s goal is to eliminate 100 to 150 wolves , or 75 % to 80 % of those that roam a 4 # 030-square-mile area between Fairbanks and Denali National_Park to the south . With rolling forests and foothills spread across an area bigger than Connecticut , this area was once popular_with caribou hunters from Fairbanks . But the local caribou herd , which numbered 10 # 700 four years ago , has dropped to 4 # 000 head , and , as a result , hunting of caribou has been prohibited here since November , 1991 . Hunters say they believe that predation by wolves and grizzly_bears , combined with uncommonly harsh winters , has driven down the number of caribou and that the animals now need extra protection if they are to rebound quickly . Nonsense , opponents say . Caribou herds fluctuate dramatically in size , usually without relation_to predators , and Alaska ' s overall caribou population is at near record highs , as hunters would find if only they would venture farther from roads . But the argument is really larger and more fundamental -- a contest for meat and dominance , if you will , between those two relentless predators , Canis_lupus and Homo_sapiens . Hunters say they believe that Alaska ' s 5 # 000 to 7 # 000 wolves -- which are not listed as threatened or endangered here as they are in the Lower 48 -- are getting more_than a fair share of the caribou and moose everywhere in the state . Environmentalists counter that no humans are starving for lack of game , so nature should be left largely intact . Alaska stirred_up a national stink last winter when it sided with hunters and advanced a plan to kill wolves in three large areas within reach of Fairbanks . At that time -- and this became a key to events that followed -- the Department of Fish and Game proposed tracking radio-collared wolves from the air and shooting entire packs at a time . Aerial wolf control had been standard fare in the state on and off until the early 1980s . The idea aroused national rage , and a tourism boycott by the Washington-headquartered Fund for Animals and the Friends of Animals in Connecticut , later joined by other groups , sent panic through Alaska ' s political and tourism Establishment . Vacation travel bookings slumped , and officials said the wolf kill looked_like it might be harder on their industry than the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill . Gov . Walter J . Hickel stepped_in and decreed that there would be no aerial wolf control . Environmentalists and animal protectionists rejoiced . The tourism boycott was lifted . Hunters fumed . For many Americans , the tale ended there . The national news media retreated . But Fairbanks-area hunters and trappers appealed_to the state Board of Game . The panel , which is dominated by hunters and trappers and has a constitutional mandate to manage game for public harvest , approved an experimental wolf-control program that would rely_on snare traps in one of the three large tracts . Private hunting and trapping regulations were also liberalized throughout the state . Such ground-based trapping is fraught with its own problems , however . Government scientists , hunter activists and the opponents of wolf control all agree that it is far less desirable than aerial hunting : Shooting generally brings a swifter end than strangling in a snare , and aerial hunting allows entire packs to be eliminated rather than randomly reducing the numbers in each pack . Many biologists say they believe that for animals with elaborate communal relationships like wolves , taking_out packs in their entirety causes the least of what humans think_of as social disruption . &quot; We are shredding their social_structure -- the very thing that makes them wolves . We ' re not talking_about just having four-legged canines survive out there , but wolves . And what makes them wolves is their very sophisticated social_structure . that ' s what sets this species apart , &quot; said Gordon Haber , a wildlife scientist who has studied wolves for 28 years . He is working under a contract with animal protection organizations opposed to the state trapping and snaring program . Another consideration is that eliminating random wolves rather than entire packs may trigger greater breeding among survivors -- as is known to happen with coyotes . This could put the state in the position of having to kill still greater numbers of wolves in future years . But having fought_off aerial hunting last year , opponents of the wolf kill are not inclined to embrace it now as a compromise . &quot; Biologically it may make more sense ( to shoot them from the air ) . But it ' s like saying : What ' s the best way to kill a kindergarten class ? This is absolutely miserable stuff , and I ' m just not going_to approve any killing at all , &quot; said Pricilla Feral , whose Friends of Animals_group is leading the call_for a renewed tourism boycott in 1994 . In the meantime , the day-by-day argument over the trapping program has become a macabre PR fight . Opponents want to photograph the dead wolves to spread the pictures across the nation ; the state responds by skinning the carcasses before allowing anyone to view them . The scene is like the back_room in a butcher ' s shop and few , if any , pictures , are published as a result . Opponents cry_out in alarm when they learn that state game agents delivered the coup_de_grace to snared and dying wolves with a shot into the side , not to the head . This prolongs the suffering of these animals just to preserve the skulls for research , opponents charge . Not so , replies the state . When agents come_across a thrashing wolf in a snare , the heart-lung area is a bigger target than the head . The two-year struggle is generating new frictions within the ranks of both hunters and environmentalists . Some hunters ' groups , such_as the Alaska Outdoor Council , strike a temperate tone . Dick Bishop , vice_president of the council , asks urban Americans to consider the &quot; environmental correctness &quot; of the traditional Alaska lifestyle of filling the freezer with wild game . &quot; Self-sufficiency just makes eminent good_sense . There is less impact on the environment than buying_food and materials through conventional commercial sources . Sometimes we have to recognize that it ' s not the grocery_store that nourishes us , but it ' s Mother Earth that nourishes us , &quot; he said . But other hunters are fed up and are talking tough . They want more reductions in predators and more game for hunters . &quot; We ' ve half-stepped our way to the edge of the cliff . We can ' t take another step without falling_off , &quot; said Ralph Seekins , a prominent Fairbanks businessman and leader of the militant new Alaska Wildlife Conservation Assn . Of each year ' s harvestable surplus of wildlife , he proposes 30 % for hunters , 30 % for bears and 30 % for wolves , leaving 10 % mortality for natural causes . &quot; Doesn ' t that seem fair ? &quot; he asked . Today , by his count , hunting is responsible_for only 2.5 % of the mortality of moose , sheep and caribou in Alaska . Bears and wolves kill 87.5 % , with 10 % attributable to natural causes . To change the equation would require widespread reduction of grizzly_bears and wolves , which the association says it will seek in 1994 . Opponents of the wolf kill also find themselves divided . Mainstream environmental organizations are trying to attack the state program through changes in federal law and regulation . Recently , they pressured the federal Fish and Wildlife Service to prohibit private hunters from using aircraft to assist in hunting wolves . As part of Alaska ' s overall goal of reducing predators , hunters this winter were given the go-ahead to use planes to locate wolves , then land and shoot them . The new federal regulations will outlaw this land-and-shoot practice on national wildlife refuges . Animal protectionists , on the other hand , say that only a renewed tourism boycott can stop the wolf kill , and they are critical of those who refuse to join . So far the strategy has been a lonely crusade by the Friends of Animals , but the larger Fund for Animals_group promises its own advertising_campaign for a boycott . Environmental organizations , by and large , have resisted the boycott approach -- chiefly because small ecotourism businesses with pro-conservation leanings are the first to be hurt . Indeed , the Alaska Wilderness Recreation and Tourism Assn . says it faces devastating consequences . &quot; We ' re angry -- both at the state and the boycotters . We don ' t have any say in this ( wolf-control ) policy but we ' re being hurt , &quot; said Nancy Lethcoe , president of the group . Last year ' s six-week boycott caused a 10 % cut_in ecotourism in Alaska , she said . This year ' s bookings through the winter holiday season are way down , in some cases as much as 90 % . But animal protectionists argue that there is no other way to reach Alaska policy-makers . &quot; Money is the only thing the state of Alaska understands , &quot; Feral said , criticizing environmental organizations , such_as the Sierra Club , that are sponsoring guided outdoor trips to Alaska in 1994 . Cruise lines and bus tours make tourism Alaska ' s No . 3 employer behind government and seafood . The state ' s Visitors ' Bureau reports that it is too early to tell whether a boycott will reduce the 1 million or so tourists expected in 1994 . For now , Executive_Director Karen Cowart says , &quot; we expect no less than a 4 % increase in visitors for 1994. &quot;</TEXT>
