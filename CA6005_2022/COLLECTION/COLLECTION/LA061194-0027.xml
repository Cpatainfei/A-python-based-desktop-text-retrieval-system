   <HEADLINE> RUSSIA TO SEND PEACEKEEPERS TO RESTIVE GEORGIA ; MILITARY : MOSCOW HOPES TO AVERT FURTHER WARFARE IN ABKHAZIA PROVINCE . SOME WORRY ABOUT IMPARTIALITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a move viewed with some apprehension in the West , Russia announced Friday that it will send 4 # 000 peacekeeping troops to neighboring Georgia to prevent a resurgence of ethnic warfare in Georgia ' s secessionist Abkhazia province . Russian Defense Minister Pavel S . Grachev made the announcement in Georgia after gaining approval from the leaders of Georgia and Abkhazia , who had signed a partial peace accord May 14 . The Russian troops will reinforce a fragile cease-fire and oversee the return of thousands of refugees . The peacekeeping mission , expected to get a go-ahead from the Russian Parliament next week , will be the first set_up by Moscow under the gaze of U.N. observers . As such , it will be a closely watched trial of whether Russian troops can promote stability along Russia ' s perimeter without imperial bullying or taking sides in other people ' s feuds . &quot; In Georgia , a fundamental test of peacekeeping in the former Soviet_Union is imminent , &quot; Madeleine Albright , U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , said in a speech Wednesday , noting that Russian army_units have in the past &quot; exacerbated local conflicts , &quot; including the one in Abkhazia . President Clinton rejected an appeal by Georgian leader Eduard A . Shevardnadze in March to put a U.S. peace force in Abkhazia to limit Russian influence . And last month , U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali ruled_out U.N. peacekeepers there because Georgia and Abkhazia had failed to settle their thorniest difference -- Abkhazia ' s demand for independence . Burdened by almost 300 # 000 war refugees , Shevardnadze reluctantly accepted the Russian peacekeeping offer . Georgian officials said they hope that the refugees , mostly ethnic Georgians forced to flee last year from Abkhazia , which had a prewar population of half a_million , will feel safe enough to go_home and ease an enormous strain on Georgia ' s war-torn economy . Having driven_out the Georgian army but fearing its return , Abkhazian leader Vladislav Ardzinba accepted the Russian troops more eagerly . They will be deployed along the Ingur River , which separates the ethnically distinct province from the rest of Georgia . &quot; The sooner the Russians arrive and stand at the border , the sooner we can rebuild our economy without having to look_back over our shoulder , &quot; said Zurab Argun , an Abkhazian television commentator . More_than 3 # 000 people died in 13 months of fighting in Abkhazia , which started with a Georgian attempt to crush the province ' s limited autonomy and ended last September in an Abkhazian victory with covert Russian military support . Grachev said 2 # 500 Russian troops already based in Georgia and Armenia will make_up the first peacekeeping contingent and will take_up positions as early as a week from now . They will soon be reinforced , he said , by 1 # 500 infantry troops from Russia and , eventually , by troops from other former Soviet republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States . Since the breakup of the Soviet_Union and its army in 1991 , Russia has openly sided with a breakaway Russian-speaking province that was fighting the central government of Moldova and with the pro-Communist government of Tajikistan , which is still fighting a guerrilla movement . In both bloody clashes , Russia called its forces &quot; peacekeepers &quot; and said they were acting in the interest of regional stability . Because of the imperial taint of such missions , the United Nations and the West have refused Russia ' s request that its troops be given the &quot; blue helmet &quot; status of U.N. peacekeepers -- and be paid_out of U.N. funds . At the same time , Western leaders recognize that few nations , except Russia , are willing to put troops on the line in the conflicts of the former Soviet_Union . &quot; The fact is that the Russians are going_to do things in these areas , &quot; said a senior Western diplomat who has come_to accept that Moscow will exercise a relatively free hand in the region . &quot; The point is to work with the Russian grain , not against it. &quot; The diplomat and other Western officials said talks were under way in the U.N. Security_Council on ways to give the Russian peacekeepers informal recognition and perhaps even &quot; voluntary &quot; financial contributions -- while keeping a close eye on their behavior . &quot; We are not explicitly approving ( the Russian force ) , but working with it , &quot; said Fyodor Starcevic , who oversees 22 U.N. observers in Abkhazia . Georgian officials said they were told that the U.N. observer force will be expanded to at least 80 soldiers and that they will guard weapons depots . Even with such informal supervision , many in Georgia and the West worry that the Russian peacekeepers will serve as a tool for Moscow ' s renewed efforts to dominate the Caucasus Mountain region where Georgia is located . Russia is already planning to build five permanent military bases in the region and hopes to gain a peacekeeper role in the 6-year-old war between Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenians in that nation ' s Nagorno-Karabakh district . &quot; It was very dangerous to sign this agreement , &quot; said a Georgian Foreign Ministry official , fearful that the Russian presence will mean a de_facto partitioning of Georgia , with independence for Abkhazia . &quot; The good news is that this agreement will bring stability to this part of the Caucasus , &quot; said John Colarusso , a specialist on the region at Canada ' s McMaster University in Hamilton , Ontario . &quot; The bad news is that it will strengthen Moscow ' s imperial hold_on the whole area. &quot; Times special correspondents Hugh Pope in Istanbul , Turkey , and Chris Bird in Tbilisi , Georgia , contributed to this report .</TEXT>
