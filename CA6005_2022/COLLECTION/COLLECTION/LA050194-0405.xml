   <HEADLINE> CITY TO CONSIDER SMOKING BAN FOR PUBLIC AREAS ; SANTA CLARITA : THE BROAD PLAN IS BACK . IT TARGETS RESTAURANTS , WORKPLACES AND INDOOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESSES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wayne Taylor is slightly hunched_over , his hands cupped in front of his face to shield against a phantom breeze . There ' s a metallic scrape and a momentary hiss . Taylor drops his hands , sighs , and wisps of smoke stream out his nose and mouth as he talks . &quot; I wonder sometimes how much longer I ' m going_to be able to do this here , &quot; said Taylor , 32 , gesturing to the Newhall restaurant patio where he is having lunch . &quot; They can really make you feel_like you ' re a criminal. &quot; The act of lighting a cigarette has become more difficult in Santa Clarita recently and may become harder still in weeks to come . City officials are considering a tobacco control ordinance that would prohibit smoking in restaurants , workplaces and enclosed public areas . Banks , malls , theaters , Laundromats -- virtually all indoor commercial businesses -- would be covered . The City_Council is expected to discuss the proposal this month . &quot; I think some of the thinking is , if there are less people smoking maybe it will be easier for others to quit , &quot; said Councilman Carl Boyer , who agrees with the theory from his own attempts to stop . Boyer quit smoking when discussions about the city ban were first under way , but started again on Jan . 17 in the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake . The Santa Clarita City_Council actually approved the broad ban in December , but changed direction one month later when about 200 people packed City_Hall . Supporters cited health damage from secondhand smoke ; restaurant owners said customers would go_to nearby unincorporated areas where no ban exists , and other critics said the issue was one of personal freedom rather than health . &quot; I just wish we went_after guns and drug dealers with the same intensity , &quot; said Councilwoman Jan Heidt , who prefers letting businesses and smokers police themselves . &quot; I think that most of us who smoke here try to be considerate of others. &quot; Some Santa Clarita smokers say they already feel penned in . They often face no-smoking house rules set_down by spouses or other relatives , and don ' t appreciate having to look harder for havens where they can light_up . &quot; I don ' t mind not smoking at_work , but when I start having to worry about it on my ( free ) time , then I get concerned , &quot; said Taylor , a Canyon Country resident . &quot; If you want to come_up_to me and ask me to put my cigarette out , that ' s one thing , but all these ' No Smoking ' signs are a pain , &quot; said Michelle Rauth , a Saugus resident . &quot; What if someone wants you to be able to smoke in their restaurant ? What if someone wants you to be able to smoke in their office ? &quot; Rauth said that she doesn ' t go_to different businesses depending_on their smoking policies , but that more establishments seem to be considering bans since the City_Council has discussed the issue . Campus stadiums here are the latest to be declared off-limits for smokers . * The College of the Canyons last week expanded an indoor smoking ban to include its stadium , uncovered stairwells and a 20-foot radius around campus doorways . A similar decision was made_for Santa Clarita ' s public high_school and junior_high_schools eight months ago , making baseball and football games smoke-free . &quot; We are a decreasing minority being pushed into a corner by a majority , &quot; said John Hassel , a smoker for nearly 40 years . Hassel , a trustee for the William S . Hart Union High_School District , voted for the ban on smoking at Santa Clarita ' s high_school and junior_high_school campuses to set a good_health example for students . Although he agrees with the ban , Hassel admits it is difficult to sit through a four- or five-hour meeting without a cigarette . &quot; It ' s hell . It ' s pure hell , &quot; Hassel said . Santa Clarita &quot; is not a comfortable place for a smoker to be. &quot;</TEXT>
