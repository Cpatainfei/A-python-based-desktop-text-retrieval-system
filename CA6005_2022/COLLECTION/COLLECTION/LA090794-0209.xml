   <TEXT> A quarter of a century ago , when audio buffs were still fawning over vinyl and videocassettes were but a twinkle in a movie mogul ' s eye , David Gregg left his engineering job to work_on a futuristic vision : a plastic disc that could hold both sound and video , to be read not by a needle or a magnet , but by a beam_of_light . Gregg -- who later won four key patents to the optical disc technology that underlies compact_discs , laser discs and CD-ROMs -- says he has never been recognized for his work . Now the 71-year-old inventor has filed a $ 250-million lawsuit in U.S District Court in Los Angeles accusing consumer electronics giant Philips Electronics and its advertising_agency of stealing credit for his invention . Over the last decade , various forms of the shiny discs have resulted in billions of dollars in sales for consumer electronics firms , foremost among them Philips , which has long claimed to be the key innovator in optical technology . The firm -- which last week filed a motion to dismiss the case -- itself owns more_than a dozen patents related to optical discs . Gregg long ago sold the rights to his patents to MCA ( for all_of $ 50 # 000 ) . And he acknowledges Philips ' contributions to the optical medium . But he insists that the Dutch firm has deprived him of the reputation he deserves as the father of a technology that has become part of daily life for millions of people -- and he aims to reclaim it . &quot; They are a Goliath , &quot; says Gregg , the son of a film_industry engineer who still works_out of the same Culver City house where he grew_up . &quot; But you know my name . And you know who won that fight. &quot; The lawsuit is not the first to question who owns what and why in the area of optical discs . The Justice_Department is currently investigating how Philips and Sony Corp . came_to dominate the compact_disc business by cross-licensing each other ' s patents and jointly charging licensing_fees to other firms . And nearly every major consumer electronics_company is now racing to develop a high-density video disc , which would hold a whole movie , cost many times less than the current 11-inch laser disc and potentially replace the videotape . The claim of the individual inventor against the force of big multinational entities has not always gone unrewarded . A few years ago , for example , inventor Gilbert Hyatt proved to the satisfaction of the U.S. Patent_Office that he had invented the microprocessor before Texas Instruments Inc. and Intel Corp . -- and began collecting millions in royalties . What is different about Gregg ' s case is that the patents themselves are not in_dispute . The engineer is seeking something else : recognition -- and $ 250 million for having been denied it . But recognition of the kind he wants may_not compute with the legal_system . According to Philips ' motion , &quot; what makes this claim wholly frivolous is Gregg ' s concession that he has no interest in the patents that he allegedly invented decades ago . Instead , Gregg now seeks to protect an interest in the self-proclaimed honorific ' title ' of ' inventor ' -- an interest wholly irrelevant to the common law. &quot; Retorts Gregg ' s attorney , David Steiner : &quot; that ' s a misapplication of the law . What we ' re talking_about is the attribution of inventor , just as Alexander_Graham_Bell is known as the inventor of the telephone . There ' s major value in being known as the inventor of the optical disc . CDs are a big deal . Just ask Philips -- they certainly sell enough of them. &quot; Gregg , proudly displaying for a visitor the different sizes and formats his original invention has taken_over the years -- he has collected hundreds of movies on laser disc , in addition to music CDs , mini-discs and CD-ROMs -- says the claims by Philips have distressed him for years . He has made a habit of approaching Philips representatives at the engineering conventions he still attends , copies of his patents in_hand , to urge them to bring his concerns back to the firm ' s headquarters in the_Netherlands . &quot; I look through the registry and I march right up_to them , and I tell them , ' I am the sole inventor of the optical disc . Don ' t you use the word inventor , ' &quot; he says . &quot; I ' m just an engineer . I ' m not going_to get an invitation to Eindhoven. &quot; Philips , Gregg says , was interested in his invention -- funded by seed money from General Electric -- back in 1967 , when he demonstrated it for Philips Phonograph Industries President J.L. Ooms . But he never heard back from the firm , and in 1968 MCA bought a controlling interest in his Westwood-based start-up firm , thus winning the rights to the patents . &quot; Lew Wasserman shook my hand , looked me straight in the eye and said , ' I have 4 # 000 movies to put_on those discs , and they can ' t be pirated , ' &quot; Gregg remembers . MCA later formed a subsidiary , Irvine-based Discovision , to exploit the technology . Since 1974 , Philips and other optical disc manufacturers have licensed the patents from Discovision . The final straw for Gregg came when his son sent him a videotape of a 30-minute Philips infomercial , which touted the firm as a pioneer of CD technology . With CD technology now so widespread , and Philips ' inventor claims spreading beyond engineering circles and into a mass audience , Gregg ' s agitation increased . He was also seeking funding for a new venture -- and he wanted the credibility that would be associated with being known as the inventor of the CD . With his final patent -- applied for decades ago but finally awarded in 1990 -- in his pocket , he approached a law_firm late last year . &quot; I am the inventor of the optical disc , &quot; he says . &quot; They can ' t rob me of that . I simply want credit where credit is due. &quot;</TEXT>
