   <HEADLINE> PERRY PREDICTS SMALLER U.S. FORCE FOR RWANDA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Defense_Secretary William J . Perry said Monday on his return from Africa that he is more hopeful about an international effort to save millions of Rwandan refugees and that only 3 # 000 U.S. troops will be needed to support the humanitarian operation . The troop estimate , given to reporters at Andrews Air_Force Base in Maryland , was lower than the 4 # 000 Americans that he earlier predicted would be stationed near Rwanda by the end of this week . &quot; As we speak , we have 1 # 200 people involved in that operation , &quot; Perry said . &quot; The number is going_to go beyond 1 # 200 , and I think 3 # 000 is probably the maximum that it is likely to go to. &quot; Perry visited Rwanda , Zaire and Uganda in a weekend trip on orders from President Clinton to inspect a U.S. military-led international aid effort to save as_many as 4 million Rwandan refugees from malnutrition , thirst and disease in the wake of a bloody civil_war . He repeated his statement a day earlier in Goma , Zaire , that the effort to provide fresh_water to refugees and end a cholera epidemic at Goma had &quot; turned the corner &quot; and begun to reduce cholera deaths , which reached as_many as 3 # 000 a day last week . &quot; We will , as the leading power in the world , be asked_in many instances to take the lead &quot; in such humanitarian efforts , said Democratic Rep . Donald Payne ( D-N.J. ) , who traveled with Perry . Perry visited the Rwandan capital , Kigali , where leaders of that country ' s new government promised to allow refugees to return safely in the aftermath of the civil_war that has claimed up_to half a_million lives . There are currently about 200 U.S. troops in Kigali setting_up a 24-hour operation to receive aid shipments by military cargo plane . The United Nations is setting_up an international peacekeeping force of nearly 5 # 000 troops in Rwanda , but Clinton and Perry have stressed that U.S. troops will not join in those operations . In Goma , Perry said the international effort to provide fresh_water and food for refugees , including up_to 1.2 million Rwandans in Goma alone , had made major progress . &quot; I believe we have truly turned the corner on this tragedy here and will be making significant improvements every day , &quot; he said , referring to steadily improving ability to produce fresh_water and Sunday ' s opening of the airport in Kigali for round-the-clock aid operations . Perry will report to Clinton on his trip and make recommendations on whether more U.S. troops should be sent to Kigali to further expand the airport operation there .</TEXT>
