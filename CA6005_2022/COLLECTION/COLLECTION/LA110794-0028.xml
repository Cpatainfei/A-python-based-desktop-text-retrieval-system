   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : COMMUNITY ESSAY ; WHY DO MOTHERS KILL ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We are not certain of the true extent of the problem in this country . But statistics show that three to five children are killed by parents or caretakers each day in the United States . Of those , one child per week comes from Los Angeles County . Most are very young . Two-thirds are under age 2 and 40 % to 50 % are under age one . The triggers tend to be chronic crying and toilet training , stresses that arise in caring for a child that age . One of the common_factors is a parent who is unprepared for the demands of caring for a very young child . Often in a moment of exasperation or in some cases substance_abuse , they may take inappropriate action to stop a child from crying or to discipline a child because they don ' t understand why , for instance , a child might cry all night . Isolation and poverty are strong factors . Very often the parent doesn ' t have good support from extended family , friends or neighbors , so they feel trapped . When you lack resources , you can ' t get a break from your kids . You can ' t afford babysitters or vacations . These crimes are more likely in urban_areas or sparsely populated areas because of the stress or the isolation . Often parents who kill were abused themselves . There ' s an almost reflex action to respond in the way your parents responded to you . The most common single category of caretaker who kills a child is the mother because mothers are most commonly the caretakers for young children . But they are still a minority of the cases . Nationally , 70 &amp; to 80 % of caretakers who kill children are men : fathers , stepfathers , male companions and so on . In L.A. County that figure is 60 % . We don ' t yet have anything solid on why ( there ' s a difference ) . In most cases , parents say they didn ' t mean to kill the child , but rage or frustration got_out of control . Deliberate plans to kill children are relatively rare . In those cases usually we see brain dysfunction or mental_disorders . A parent may believe a child is purposely crying to make them angry , or that the_devil has possessed the child . Domestic violence puts a child at very high risk . When there ' s a general atmosphere of violence in a home , when you have rage pointed in any direction , you increase the chance that that rage will be manifested in violence against the most susceptible victim . Government can help . We have the first child death review team in the country . It brings many agencies together to review all cases of children who die under suspicious circumstances . It examines what happened and also gets the family the help it obviously needs . It lets us learn how these things happen so we can get better at preventing them . We are starting a computerized index in Los Angeles in January . A network like that can alert one social_service agency that another agency , or school , or police_officer , or hospital emergency_room , has had contact with the family and that there seems to be trouble , so preventive services can be offered . Better prenatal care reduces the chances of a difficult , high-risk baby . Better parenting preparation is crucial . We need to fund family support services and must also have swifter severance of parental rights when it is clear they cannot provide appropriate parenting .</TEXT>
