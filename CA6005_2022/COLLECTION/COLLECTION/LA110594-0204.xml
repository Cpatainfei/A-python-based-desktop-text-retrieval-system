   <HEADLINE> SOCCER / GRAHAME L . JONES ; LETTERS WERE MIXED , BUT MESSAGE WASN ' T</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bits and pieces from the world ' s game . . . * The handwriting was_on the wall for Ossie Ardiles , Argentina ' s World Cup-winning midfielder of 1978 who was fired this week as coach of the_English Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur . As loss followed loss , Spurs ' fans discovered that if they rearranged the letters in Ardiles ' name they could sum_up his team pretty well . The new arrangement of letters : &quot; Side is a Loser. &quot; * After finishing his playing career , Dunga , Brazil ' s World Cup ' 94 captain , says he wants to open a zoo . * Another member of Brazil ' s victorious team is following a somewhat higher calling . Goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel , who all but dropped from sight after his penalty-saving heroics helped the Brazilians win the World Cup , has resurfaced . Unable to land a job with another team after being released by his Italian club , Reggiana , Taffarel , a deeply religious man , now plays free for a church team in the town of Reggio nell ' Emilia . He even scored a goal in a recent game . &quot; He believes God protected him and the Brazilian team during the World Cup , &quot; said the parish priest , Don Luigi Gianferrari . * The only country certain to be playing in the 1996 European Championship is England , the host nation for the 16-team tournament . So , while 47 other countries are battling to make the field , England is left with nothing but &quot; friendly &quot; games between now and June 1996 . Coach Terry Venables is making_sure his team will be_well tested by then , however . Unbeaten in the first five games of Venables ' reign , England has defeated European champion Denmark , 1-0 ; tied Norway , 0-0 ; trounced Greece , 5-0 ; beaten the United States , 2-0 , and tied Romania , 1-1 . Now , the schedule gets decidedly more difficult . England plays Nigeria this month and Portugal in March . Then , next June , it plays in a tournament with Brazil , Sweden and Japan . If Venables ' team still is undefeated after that , it will have to be considered a legitimate candidate to win its first European Championship . * Bulgarian striker Hristo Stoitchkov , who played superbly in helping Barcelona thrash England ' s Manchester United , 4-0 , on Wednesday in the European Champions ' League , has been a key figure in the Spanish champion ' s four consecutive league titles . But there has been a price . When Stoitchkov was tossed_out of a Spanish Cup game this season , it was was his 11th red card in four years . Referees have also given him 36 yellow cards in that time . * The Nigerian team apparently enjoyed its World Cup experience in the United States a little more_than most of the media realized . Clemens Westerhof , the Dutch coach who led the Nigerians to within a whisker of the quarterfinals , said he knew his team was doomed to defeat against Italy . In an interview in the current issue of African Soccer , Westerhof tells the following tale : &quot; Before the match against Italy , I saw that the players had lost concentration , so I suggested that we move to another hotel . Some of them had their wives with them , and some_other ladies came . One night , six players were out until 6 a.m. The team discipline was slipping_away . &quot; They refused to move . From that moment we had lost . We didn ' t lose the match on the pitch , we ' d already lost it. &quot; * When Liverpool of the_English Premier League made a preseason tour of South_Africa , the players and coaches had the opportunity to meet President Nelson Mandela . A few weeks later , the Liverpool game program featured a photo of the president decked_out in a Liverpool jersey and scarf . A fan is born . * When Diego Maradona , suspended for a second 15-month spell after failing a World Cup drug test , assumed assistant coaching duties at Argentina ' s Deportivo Mandiyu club , he said , &quot; I will give my players an injection of strength , morale and the will to play good soccer. &quot; Commented England ' s Sunday Telegraph : &quot; As long as this is the only injection he gives them . . . &quot; * Bayern Munich won the Bundesliga championship in Germany last season under the temporary coaching of Franz Beckenbauer , then hired Italy ' s Giovanni Trapattoni as its new coach . Trapattoni , who enjoyed great success at Juventus and Inter Milan , did not get_off to an especially promising start in Germany . Nor did he win many friends with the following comment : &quot; The Germans historically have an idea of domination in their heads which I don ' t personally share but which has certainly always caused a lot of problems , &quot; he told Italy ' s Corriere Dello Sport . &quot; It ' s time to review the idea. &quot; * A television network in Argentina has a novel way of showing its feelings about referees . During televised games , whenever an official fails to give a penalty or call a foul , a cartoon referee is scrolled across the bottom of the screen -- complete with dark glasses , white cane and guide_dog . * Cameroon authorities have declared goalkeeper Joseph-Antoine Bell an undesirable and have told him he will be arrested if he tries to return to the country . He is living now in St . Etienne , France , and , having retired as a player , hopes to become a coach .</TEXT>
