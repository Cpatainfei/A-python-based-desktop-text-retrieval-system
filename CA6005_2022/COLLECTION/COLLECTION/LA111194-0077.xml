   <HEADLINE> MEDICINE / ALZHEIMER ' S DISEASE ; EYE DRUG HAS PROMISE FOR EARLY DETECTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Using a drug commonly employed to detect cataracts during eye examinations , Harvard researchers have devised an inexpensive new test for Alzheimer ' s disease that promises to speed the identification of the hard-to-diagnose disorder . Alzheimer ' s , which causes loss of memory and bodily control and is eventually fatal , affects as_many as 4 million Americans -- including former President Ronald Reagan , who announced Saturday that he is in the early stages of the disease . Researchers are enthusiastic about the new technique , whose discovery is reported today in the journal Science . But they caution that it has been studied in only a small number of people and must be tested on a much larger scale . That caution , some experts argue , is justified . At least three other highly touted tests for the disorder failed to live_up_to their preliminary promise when tested in larger trials . Neurologists are desperate for a simple way to diagnose Alzheimer ' s in its earliest stages , or even before symptoms appear . They believe several drugs now in development could delay progression of the disorder if they were given early enough . &quot; While this is certainly an exciting finding , we have to do more research to confirm these results and see if the test is reliable for Alzheimer ' s disease , &quot; said Dr. Steven DeKosky of the University of Pittsburgh , a member of the Alzheimer ' s Assn . advisory_board . If it does_work , &quot; It would be marvelous , &quot; added Dr. Leon Thal of UC San Diego . The cause of Alzheimer ' s is unknown , but it is closely tied to aging . One in 10 people over age 65 have the disease and nearly half of those over 85 are afflicted , suffering severe memory_loss , an inability to think clearly , a short attention_span and accelerated physical deterioration . Care_for Americans with the disorder costs an estimated $ 80 billion per year , according to the Alzheimer ' s Assn . There is currently no easy way to diagnose Alzheimer ' s . Patients such_as Reagan are diagnosed with a_battery of blood_tests , a physical examination , magnetic_resonance_imaging and sophisticated neuro-psychological tests that rule_out all other sources of symptoms . But these tests may cost thousands of dollars and are wrong 25 % to 40 % of the time , according to neuroscientist Leonard F . M . Scinto of Harvard Medical_School . Scinto ' s colleague , neuroscientist Huntington Potter of Harvard , got the idea for the new test from his work with Down ' s syndrome , whose victims share many symptoms and biological problems with Alzheimer ' s patients . Down ' s patients who survive past age 30 develop brain lesions virtually identical to those of Alzheimer ' s patients and also display most of the characteristic mental problems . Down ' s patients are known to be unusually sensitive to a class of drugs that inhibit transmission of signals between brain_cells by a neurotransmitter called acetylcholine . This hypersensitivity is detected by a change in heart_rate or an increase in pupil size after administration of such drugs . The response to these drugs had apparently never been studied in Alzheimer ' s patients , however . Scinto ' s team used the drug tropicamide , settling_on a dose 1 / 100 of that used to dilate pupils during an eye examination . They found that placing a drop of this solution in the eye caused the pupils of Alzheimer ' s patients to dilate by 13 % or more within 30 minutes , while those of healthy individuals dilated an average of only 4 % . The dilation disappears within an hour or two . They then examined 58 elderly individuals , including 19 with early symptoms or a formal diagnosis of Alzheimer ' s . Eighteen of the 19 showed the increased dilation . One of those had no obvious mental problems and only a mild difficulty with daily living activities . Within nine months , however , he had developed marked cognitive problems and memory_loss , indicating that the test may be able to diagnose Alzheimer ' s very early in the course of the disease . Among the remaining healthy patients , only two showed a positive response to the test . The researchers are monitoring their progress_to see if they also develop the disorder . The researchers said that hundreds , perhaps thousands , of other subjects need to be tested before they are confident that procedure successfully identifies the disease , a process that will take at least two years . They also noted that the test presently cannot be conducted by most ophthalmologists because special equipment is necessary to measure the change in pupil size . ( Southland Edition , A24 ) Test for Alzheimer ' s Alzheimer ' s disease can currently be diagnosed only with a complete battery of blood , clinical and psychological tests , and even then the diagnosis is only 75 % accurate , at best . Here is a look_at a new test that promises to be 95 % accurate . * Researchers put a drop of a diluted solution of the drug tropicamide in the eye . * A sophisticated instrument is used_to measure dilation of the pupil . * If the pupil dilates 13 % or more within 30 minutes , the patient has Alzheimer ' s . If it doesn ' t , the patient is healthy .</TEXT>
