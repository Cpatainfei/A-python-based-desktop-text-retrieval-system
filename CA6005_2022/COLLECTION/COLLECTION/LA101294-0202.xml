   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : DESPITE SOLID POTENTIAL , HUSSEIN STEERS IRAQ ON PATH OF ECONOMIC RUIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Saddam Hussein is shooting the Iraqi economy in the foot again . But the United States will feel the pain . And so , ultimately , this confrontation could force a shift in U.S. policy . By threatening Kuwait with troops , even though he appears to have backed_off in the face of a swift U.S. response , the Baghdad dictator has made another disastrous move that will keep Iraq ' s oil exports bottled_up and its economy hobbled by United Nations sanctions for another year or more . The continued absence from world markets of Iraq ' s production will keep oil prices roughly $ 3 a barrel higher than they would otherwise be , which could be good news for Saudi_Arabia , Kuwait , Mexico , Venezuela and other oil producers that are close U.S. allies . But it ' s not good news for the United States , which will incur greater risk and expense because of a poor and desperate Iraq -- in terms of troops stationed in Kuwait and other measures in an unstable Middle_East -- than if the country were able to realize its vast potential . Some experts say Saddam is using threat and disruption to get Washington ' s attention and negotiations , as North_Korea , Cuba and Haiti have done . Indeed , this latest confrontation may force a U.S. reassessment of policies toward Iraq . that ' s because the problem may_not be short-term . Iraq was a bellicose nation long before Saddam Hussein took power in 1971 , and it could continue to threaten its neighbors after he ' s gone if it remains poor and resentful . Restoring Iraq to a world of growing economies and peaceful pursuits is in the U.S. interest -- but it will be no easy matter . Iraq , with 18 million people , as much as 150 billion barrels of oil -- the world ' s second-largest reserves -- and historically abundant agriculture and an educated population , blames U.N. sanctions for its plight today . Its economic output per person , a measure of living standards , has declined to roughly $ 1 # 600 annually -- comparable_to Iran next door -- from the lofty levels ( for the Middle_East ) of $ 3 # 650 per person in 1990 , before the Gulf War . Yes , sanctions have hurt . Before the war , Iraq exported $ 18 billion a year in oil and other products . It now exports $ 1 billion a year , including $ 400 million of oil shipments through Jordan and Turkey that the United States winks_at . Loss of export revenues has curtailed the economy and lack of_imports has set_off inflationary demands for simple consumer items . But Iraq has also spurned offers from the United Nations to allow $ 1.6 billion in oil exports to pay_for food and medicines and spurned U.S. offers to unfreeze some Iraqi bank_deposits . An angry nationalism got_in the way of good_sense , as it has for decades , says Patrick Clawson , an economist with the U.S._government ' s National Defense University . Saddam Hussein ' s record is particularly sorry . He turned Iraq , a food exporter for 3 # 000 years and site of the biblical Garden_of_Eden , into a food importer , notes Clawson . He depleted Iraq ' s treasury with an eight-year war against Iran , then tried to grab Kuwait in 1990 and got flattened . Even so , the Iraqi economy improved in 1991 and ' 92 as rebuilding in Baghdad and other cities boosted productivity . Seeing the economy ' s underlying strength , French and Russian business people have been arranging ventures in Iraq pending the lifting of sanctions and resumption of oil exports . &quot; Iraq could come_back very fast if sanctions were lifted -- 1 million barrels a day immediately , rising quickly to nearly 3 million , &quot; says Albert Anton , a partner in Carl H . Pforzheimer &amp; Co. , a U.S. investment_firm specializing in petroleum issues . That would mean a quick $ 15 billion in additional revenues to the country , with more to come as it became a major oil power . But the military threat to Kuwait has undermined growing sentiment for easing sanctions . Why did Saddam Hussein do_it ? Yet another miscalculation , say many experts . But Zalmay Khalilzad , a former Defense_Department official who is now director of Middle_East Studies at Rand Corp. , says that &quot; maybe he saw that confrontation gets results , that troublemakers like North_Korea and Haiti get negotiations with Washington. &quot; For sure Washington will have to do something different . Hoping for an Iraqi uprising against Saddam Hussein is unrealistic , say most experts . &quot; He has a praetorian_guard around him in Baghdad , &quot; says one . Iraq ' s economy is hurting , but reports of starvation may be propaganda . &quot; Agriculture is actually doing better , &quot; says Clawson . So , after U.S. troops are in place in Kuwait and the cost of keeping them there is mounting , the United States and other countries may turn_to devising a new_deal for Iraq . Joseph Tovey of Tovey &amp; Co. , a U.S. oil investment_firm with interests in the Middle_East , theorizes that a confederation of states could be set_up for the many ethnic and religious populations in Iraq . The country is already divided , with U.S. and U.N. troops protecting a Kurdish state in the north and now contemplating creation of a buffer_state in the south . Still , with vast oil reserves and the Garden_of_Eden at stake , working_out Iraq ' s future will be a long process . But the payoff for the Middle_East of a progressive , peaceful Iraq would be tremendous . It will be a vast opportunity for U.S. and world business , of course . But also , like the Babylon it was in ancient history , Iraq should be a source of reflection . Here is a land with the potential to be one of the wealthiest and most progressive on Earth . Yet decades of misrule have made_it a place of misery and desperation -- and a threat to its neighbors and the U.S. military . Indeed , like Haiti and North_Korea , Iraq is a wake-up call : It says peace is a full-time job and we have work to do_in the world .</TEXT>
