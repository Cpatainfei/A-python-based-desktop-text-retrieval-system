   <HEADLINE> VALLEY PERSPECTIVE ; BERNSON DOES THE RIGHT THING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last August , the Los Angeles City Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission exposed an intricate money_laundering scam that was designed to hide the source of contributions to politicians ' campaigns . The case led to the largest penalty of its kind in U.S. history -- an $ 895 # 000 fine against Evergreen America Corp . That left the not-so-insignificant matter of $ 170 # 000 in tainted campaign contributions to more_than 20 state and local candidates . In response , the city ' s Ethics Commission rightfully ordered local candidates to pay to the city treasury the money they had received from Evergreen . One of only two local politicians to balk was L.A. City Councilman Hal Bernson , who said he deserved a hearing , had already spent the money , and had satisfied the spirit of the law by contributing to charity an even larger amount_of_money . He also said that he should not have to raise funds to cover money that he had accepted in good_faith . But Ethics Commission officials had already removed the taint of suspicion from the candidates by stating that the Evergreen contributions had been accepted unwittingly . The commission ' s goal was reasonable : riding the political_system of tainted money . We ' re pleased to note now that Bernson has decided to donate an amount equal_to the Evergreen money he received ( $ 11 # 000 ) to police in his district . That sounds like an excellent way to meet the Ethics Commission demand . We only wish that Bernson had acted_as quickly as the other candidates so ordered .</TEXT>
