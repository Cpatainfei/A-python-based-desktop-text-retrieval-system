   <HEADLINE> THE WAR THAT HAS NO WINNERS ; HOW TO AVOID A WINGDING TRADE WAR WITH JAPAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The truism to keep_in mind as the United States and Japan square_off in their latest crisis over export and import policies is that trade wars have no winners . A trade war is a mutually destructive game of economic chicken . Consumers are always the biggest losers because trade sanctions , like protectionism , invariably lead to higher prices . For that reason if for no other , Washington must move prudently in this confrontation . Two other truths need repeating . The first is that Japan clearly restricts access to certain key markets , including in greater or lesser degree the four -- autos and auto parts , medical technology , telecommunications and insurance -- on which the United States last week failed to win market-opening concessions . The second is that even if Tokyo were to lift all_the barriers to market access it now imposes , America ' s trade_deficit with Japan would shrink by only 20 % to 30 % . Those are Clinton_Administration figures . What they underscore is that , however Japan may rig the rules of the trade game , the biggest reason for the U.S. deficit now as in years past is that Americans simply continue to spend too_much and save too_little , to consume much more_than they produce . The difference is made_up with imports , with Japan -- because of the quality and sometimes price of many of its products -- a preferred supplier . that ' s why it ' s absurd to look_to Japan to unilaterally right the trade imbalance . At the same time it ' s proper to ask -- to insist -- that Japan live_up_to its earlier market-opening agreements while moving to ease other unfair restraints , such_as those in the four areas noted . The Motorola cellular_phone case is an example of how an earlier market-opening agreement , this one dating to 1989 , was not kept . U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor , in a move that was coincidental with but is now inescapably linked with the market-opening talks that failed last Friday , has found that Japan has not kept its bargain to allow Motorola Inc. , a recognized world leader in cellular technology , one-third to one-half of the cellular_phone business in the lucrative Tokyo area . Undisclosed sanctions are likely to follow . Consider the Motorola finding a warning shot , an earnest of U.S. intentions , with other steps -- ranging from complaints before the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to a big boost in tariffs on Japanese minivans and sport-utility vehicles -- being threatened . But consider also the self-wounding effects that indiscriminate sanctions can have . The delicate task facing the Clinton_Administration is to keep_up legitimate market-opening pressures on Japan while avoiding the more extreme and ultimately debilitating measures that some domestic pressure_groups are calling_for in their self-interests .</TEXT>
