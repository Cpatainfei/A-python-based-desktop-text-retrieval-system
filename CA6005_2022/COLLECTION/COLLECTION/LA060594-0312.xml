   <TEXT> Protesters chained and cemented themselves to cars blocking an abortion clinic Saturday and claimed to be the first to break a federal law against such demonstrations . Legislation signed by President Clinton on May 26 prohibits protesters from blocking access to women ' s health clinics or threatening patients and employees.The measure -- the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act -- has been dubbed &quot; FACE. &quot; &quot; It is wrong for any law to penalize lifesaving action , &quot; said Monica Migliorino Miller , the protesters ' spokeswoman . &quot; Milwaukee pro-lifers are the first in the nation to break FACE for the sake of protecting the defenseless unborn , &quot; she said . At least five protesters used concrete and chains to fasten themselves to two vehicles blocking the doors of the clinic . Firefighters freed them . Across the street , other protesters erected three-foot-high white crosses , sang hymns and prayed . Police Sgt . Paul Smallish said eight people were arrested on charges of disorderly_conduct . The FBI is investigating whether to file federal charges against them . Twenty to 25 demonstrators from several area anti-abortion groups gathered at the site . The clinic , Affiliated Medical Services , was closed for about 90 minutes because of the protest .</TEXT>
