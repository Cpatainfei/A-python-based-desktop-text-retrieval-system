   <HEADLINE> 911 TAPE TELLS OF STORMY SIMPSON RELATIONSHIP ; INQUIRY : DEFENDANT ' S EX-WIFE PLEADS FOR HELP AS OBSCENITIES ARE SCREAMED . DEFENSE REVIEWS FORENSIC EVIDENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On tapes released Wednesday by the Los Angeles Police_Department , O.J. Simpson ' s ex-wife is heard crying and pleading for help as a man identified as Simpson furiously screams obscenities in the background after breaking_down her door . &quot; Can you get someone over here now ? . . . He ' s back . Please . He ' s O.J. Simpson . I think you know his record . . . . He showed_up again . Could you just send somebody over here ? He ' s in a white Bronco . But first of all , he broke the back_door down to get_in . . . . He ' s f------ going nuts . . . . He ' s going_to beat the s--- out of me , &quot; Nicole Brown Simpson says on the tape of her 911 call -- made Oct . 25 , 1993 , eight months before she was killed . &quot; He broke the whole back_door in . . . . He came and he practically knocked my upstairs door down , but he pounded it and he screamed and hollered and I tried to get him out of the bedroom because the kids are sleeping_in there. &quot; In the background , a man says : &quot; I don ' t give a s--- anymore. &quot; Nicole Simpson responds : &quot; Would you just please , O.J. , O.J. , O.J. , O.J. . . . Please leave. &quot; The man screams back : &quot; I ' m not leaving ! &quot; On the tape , she describes Simpson as &quot; ranting and raving &quot; and &quot; crazy. &quot; The tape offers a chilling peek into the tumultuous union between the former high_school homecoming princess and the Heisman Trophy winner -- a relationship that prosecutors contend ended brutally when he killed Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman 11 days ago . According to Nicole Simpson ' s account on the tape , the incident began after O.J. Simpson became upset over a picture of an ex-boyfriend in her photo album . In response to press requests , police also released a tape of the 1989 incident that led to Simpson ' s no-contest plea to misdemeanor wife-beating . On that tape , the phone is apparently off_the_hook and a female at the Simpsons ' North Rockingham Avenue address can be heard screaming . There is no dialogue , and a police log of the incident says only : &quot; Female being beaten . . . could be heard over the phone. &quot; Authorities took no action after the October , 1993 , emergency call because Nicole Simpson declined to press charges . However , during the same month , she contacted the unit of the city attorney ' s office that prosecuted her 1989 battery case against Simpson , saying she was terrified and in fear for her life . According to authorities familiar_with that contact , Nicole Simpson said there were &quot; many , many incidents &quot; in which Simpson had threatened her . &quot; It has been an ongoing , chronic , severe problem , &quot; said one authority familiar_with that conversation . &quot; It wasn ' t one time or five times . It was many times . &quot; It was before 1989 , it was_after 1989 -- it was no secret , &quot; said the authority , who spoke on the condition of anonymity . &quot; She was completely terrorized . It was not exclusively hitting her . ( It was ) other things . She was extremely frightened and in fear for her life . Chronically . She was terrified ; she believed he was going_to kill her. &quot; Deputy City Atty . Alana Bowman , head of the city attorney ' s office domestic violence unit , said Nicole Simpson was treated like other victims of spousal battery . Although unable to provide specifics about Simpson ' s encounter with her office , she said Nicole Simpson &quot; talked to one of our victim advocates over the years , but . . . never brought_forth any criminal violations that we could proceed on &quot; besides the 1989 case . The tapes released Wednesday , though not specifically linked to the murder case against Simpson , appeared to add a sobering emotional dimension to the public ' s understanding of the stormy marriage at the heart of the investigation . O.J. Simpson ' s lawyer , Robert L . Shapiro , could not immediately be reached for comment . Earlier in the day , Shapiro and other members of the defense_team were allowed to examine detailed evidence in the double-murder case against Simpson including coroner ' s photos , tissue and blood samples and tapes of an unusual three-hour interview that Simpson gave investigators the day after the killings . At a courtroom hearing Wednesday , the prosecutor in the case_shot down one of the more sensational reports in the torrent of coverage of the murders : that investigators had recovered a bloody ski_mask and booked it into evidence . &quot; There is no ski_mask , &quot; Deputy Dist . Atty . Marcia Clark said . Millions of Americans , already drawn to the strange , twisting saga via the unrelenting eye of the news media , were zoomed into the courtroom and inadvertently allowed to eavesdrop on a private exchange between the jailed sports legend and the bailiffs . &quot; I ' ll do anything to stay out of that cell , &quot; Simpson said in a plaintive , personal aside picked_up by a television microphone that the judge later sternly ordered removed . The comment -- the first personal reaction by Simpson broadcast since the sensational case exploded -- came as the officers tried to usher him from the courtroom during a break_in the proceedings . In a dark , pin-striped suit and tie-less shirt open at the collar , Simpson appeared more attentive and relaxed than during his first court appearance Monday . He said little , but no longer seemed dazed and groggy as his eyes scanned the spectators and reporters packed into the courtroom of Municipal Judge Patti Jo McKay . Immediately after the procedural hearing , the defense_team , including two forensic pathologists , went_to the coroner ' s office to examine evidence under the supervision of the coroner , Dr. Lakshmanan Sathyavagiswaran . The coroner looked_on but declined to answer any defense_team questions about the evidence , said his spokesman , Scott Carrier . After a four-hour review of material in a secured , subterranean area of the coroner ' s complex , the lead pathologist for the defense_team , Dr. Michael Baden , emerged and immediately disputed chilling reports that Nicole Simpson had been nearly decapitated . &quot; No , no . There is none , &quot; Baden said of the near-decapitation reports as he made his way to a waiting cab . Joining the defense_team at the coroner ' s office and in the courtroom was a new co-counsel , retiring Santa Clara University School_of_Law Dean Gerald Uelmen . Shapiro described Uelmen , 53 , as &quot; the foremost constitutional scholar in California &quot; and said Uelmen would explore &quot; statements that could prejudice or preclude a fair trial &quot; for his client . Uelmen , a former federal prosecutor in Los Angeles who is considered an expert on the death_penalty , has known Shapiro for 20 years and the two worked together on another high-profile slaying involving Marlon Brando ' s son . In other developments : * The Los Angeles judge widely criticized for giving Simpson allegedly lenient treatment in a 1989 domestic battery case involving Nicole Simpson called a news_conference to defend his handling of the case , saying that the athlete had received no special treatment . Judge Ronald R . Schoenberg said the city attorney ' s office agreed with a sentence that included no jail time . * A Los Angeles detective wrapped_up an unsuccessful hunt for the murder weapon in Chicago , saying he had recovered useful evidence and witness statements , leaving open the possibility that investigators could return to the city where Simpson headed after the slayings . Among the items collected by investigators were a broken glass and bloodstained washcloth . Simpson has maintained that a cut on his hand came from a broken glass_in the hotel_room where he briefly stayed . * Divorce_court records offered new details on the financial and personal_relationship between Nicole and O.J. Simpson . Nicole began dating the former sports star when she was 18 and just out of high_school and moved_in with him when she was 19 , according to papers filed by her attorneys in the 1992 divorce case . Seeking large alimony payments to maintain a lavish , bi-coastal lifestyle , her attorneys portrayed Nicole Simpson as a community_college dropout who sacrificed her own career to be a devoted companion of her high-profile husband , who &quot; required that she be with him. &quot; * The Los Angeles County Grand_Jury on Wednesday continued -- for a fourth day -- hearing evidence in the O.J. Simpson case in secret . Jurors are_due to return today to hear more testimony that prosecutors apparently hope will lead to an indictment against Simpson and eliminate a preliminary hearing on June 30 , the day the grand_jury ' s term expires . In court , the most significant development was the acknowledgment that a bloody ski_mask is not among the evidence against Simpson gathered by police . ( The existence of the mask was widely reported , but the Los Angeles Times could not verify those reports and did not publish them. ) Shapiro extracted the ski_mask disclosure when he said in court that it was one of two items that had been reported by some journalists , but were not on a list of evidence given to him by the prosecution . Later , when asked , he would not say what the second item is . In her remarks to McKay , Clark noted that statements that Simpson gave police the day after the slayings were made voluntarily and that he had waived his right to remain silent . She said she would turn_over a tape-recording of those statements to the defense_team along with any other evidence or reports the defense requested , including some raw notes . Clark lost her bid , however , to videotape the defense_team as it examined physical evidence gathered from the autopsies . But McKay allowed_for someone from the coroner ' s office be_on hand during the examination . In other rulings , McKay ordered that Simpson be provided with a cervical pillow to ease his discomfort from what his lawyer said is an old football injury .
