   <HEADLINE> WORLD SPORTS SCENE / RANDY HARVEY ; IOC TAKES STRAIGHT AND ARROW IN EASTON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the wall outside U.S. Olympic Committee Executive_Director Harvey Schiller ' s office in Colorado Springs , Colo. , is a display of arrows donated by Jim Easton , president of archery ' s international federation . When Easton was elected Monday in Paris as one of two International Olympic Committee_members from the United States , it must have felt to Schiller as if one of those arrows had pierced his heart . Several candidates had been mentioned for the position since Robert Helmick resigned in 1991 , but no one pursued it as aggressively as Schiller . The IOC is often suspicious of those with so_much ambition , wondering whether they are more interested in promoting themselves than the Olympic movement . As one member said , when a campaign is perceived as one , it is doomed to failure . But even if there is no reason to suspect that Schiller ' s motives were anything but the purest , he was never considered a serious candidate because of his philosophical and personal differences with the senior member of the IOC from the United States , Anita DeFrantz . DeFrantz has been an IOC member for eight years and gained admission into the inner_circle , the executive board , two years ago . If she was not comfortable with Schiller as a potential member , then neither was IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch . Schiller underestimated DeFrantz ' s influence . Even though she , as an IOC member , sits on the USOC ' s executive committee , she sometimes is treated as an outsider there . Now that Schiller is leaving on Oct . 1 to become president of TBS Sports , perhaps there will be an improvement in the relationship between the USOC and DeFrantz . * There is little question that DeFrantz can work with Easton . Both are from Los Angeles , both were officials with the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee and both are actively involved in the Amateur Athletic Foundation , DeFrantz as president and Easton as a member of the board of directors . Easton ' s election also helps fulfill Samaranch ' s goal of giving international sports federations more representation within the IOC . But Samaranch is relaxing on his promise to do the same for women . All of the 12 new members named Monday are men . * If the IOC ' s evaluation commission were asked to name its final four candidates for the 2002 Winter_Olympics today instead of next January , insiders say that the survivors would be Salt_Lake_City , Oestersund , Sweden ; Sion , Switzerland , and Graz , Austria . And if the final vote by the IOC were today instead of next June , they say that the clear winner would be Salt_Lake_City . So , naturally , the most nervous of the nine bid committees formally presenting their candidacies before the start of last week ' s IOC Congress in Paris was the one from Salt_Lake_City . Members of that city ' s committee are aware that at least three considerations -- their second-place finish to Nagano , Japan , by only three votes_in the bidding for 1998 ; their firm financial position and , with the recent start of construction on a bobsled and luge track and a speedskating oval , their November , 1995 , target date for completion of all venues -- have placed them in an unenviable position as the favorite . The IOC tends to get bored with favorites . * Salt_Lake_City also could be vulnerable if Quebec_City , Canada , is among the four cities selected to appear before the IOC voters on June 16 in Budapest , Hungary . Although many IOC members concede that Salt_Lake_City ' s bid for 1998 was technically better than Nagano ' s , they were reluctant to vote for another U.S. city so soon after awarding the 1996 Summer Olympics to Atlanta . They could decide in Budapest that 2002 would be a good time to return the Winter Games to North_America -- as long as it is not to a U.S. city . Quebec_City supporters already are aiming at Salt_Lake_City . Richard Pound , an IOC executive board_member from Montreal , said last week that the Canadian Olympic Assn . did not designate Calgary as its official candidate because the world is not ready for another Winter_Olympics in the Rocky Mountains so soon after the 1988 Games in that city . Salt_Lake_City , of course , is also located amid the Rockies . Perhaps Pound was merely retaliating for recent remarks by the U.S. Olympic Committee ' s interim executive_director , John Krimsky , who said that Quebec_City underestimated costs in announcing a proposed operating_budget of $ 540 million . That is $ 260 million less than Salt_Lake_City ' s forecast . &quot; Canada made that mistake in 1976 in Montreal , &quot; Krimsky said , referring to the gigantic deficit left_behind by the Summer Olympics . &quot; The Olympic movement in North_America and the world cannot afford another city to make that kind of mistake. &quot; * Why does any city want to stage the Winter_Olympics ? Lillehammer , Norway , which took_on that responsibility in February , reaped a $ 58-million surplus , 500 new jobs and such favorable publicity worldwide that it broke all_of its tourism records this summer . * Nagano officials thought they had gone above and beyond the call of duty by agreeing to accept curling and women ' s ice_hockey in their program , but Samaranch surprised them by asking if they believed snowboarding might be another valuable addition . They told him that they have never given the sport much thought but promised that they will now .</TEXT>
