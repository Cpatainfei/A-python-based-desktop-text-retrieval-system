   <HEADLINE> HEAT , HUMIDITY BAKE O.C. ; LITTLE RELIEF IN SIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The sauna that is August in Southern California set_in with a vengeance Thursday , baking Orange County in a haze of record-breaking heat from the inland canyons to the beaches . A sweltering 100 degrees was recorded at Irvine Ranch , 99 degrees in Lake Forest and 98 degrees in Tustin -- all surpassing the 96 recorded in Orange County on Aug . 11 , 1933 , a day highlighted by a meteor_shower that was seen in the county , according to an almanac compiled by local historian Jim Sleeper . Ironically , a meteor_shower was expected late Thursday night into early this morning . &quot; It was like an oven , &quot; Fullerton Police Cadet Dan Allen , 21 , said . &quot; It was warm . I was running my air conditioner. &quot; And forecasters say there is little relief in_sight , with highs in the hottest parts of the county today nearing triple digits : 97 in Anaheim and Irvine and 95 in Lake Forest . It was expected to top out at 93 in Santa Ana ; San Juan Capistrano , 86 ; Laguna Beach , 83 ; Dana Point , 80 ; and Newport Beach 75 . Temperatures climbed into the mid-90s throughout much of inland Orange County on Thursday , the fourth straight day the mercury has passed the 90-degree mark , said Marty McKewon , a meteorologist for WeatherData , which does forecasts for The Times . Other highs included 92 in Santa Ana and 76 in Newport Beach . Even beach-goers seeking breezy respite up and down the Southern California coast were greeted instead with blasts of 90-degree-plus heat . Temperatures in balmy San Diego hit 86 degrees , breaking the second local heat record in two days . In Dana Point , it was 84 degrees on the water , and hotter on land , where laborer Jose Salcedo toiled on Pacific Coast Highway . Amid the record-breaking heat and almost intolerable humidity , Salcedo was comforted by two best_friends : his baseball_cap and a water_jug . &quot; You just have to keep drinking_water , &quot; said Salcedo , 35 , a Santa Ana resident who was helping to repair a crumbled hillside at the southern tip of Dana Point . His fellow_worker , Jerry Salgado of Orange , added another heat-beating device -- a bandanna hugging his scalp . &quot; It keeps the sweat out of my eyes , &quot; said Salgado , 34 . &quot; The only shade we ' ve got is the visors on our caps. &quot; The moisture from tropical storm Hector that was bringing clouds into the county &quot; has all moved to the east , &quot; McKewon said , adding that the thunderheads seen above the San Bernardino Mountains Thursday were evidence of scattered showers in the eastern deserts . &quot; It ' s going_to stay hot , &quot; he said . Hector not only brought clouds and humidity to the county , but a south swell that was increasing Thursday , particularly in Newport Beach . For surfers , the point breaks at 18th Street and 56th Street were breaking best , said Newport Beach lifeguard Lt . Jim Turner . &quot; The surf is about three to five feet today , and it ' s been good for the last couple of days , &quot; Turner said . But the waves kept lifeguards busy with more_than 80 rescues a day Wednesday and Thursday , he said . The combination of the increasingly heavy surf and a strong southerly current caused Huntington Beach lifeguards to execute several mass rescues throughout the day Thursday , said Lt . Mike Beuerlein . As_many as a dozen people were rescued at a time , although no one was seriously hurt , he said . &quot; The side current pushes quite a_few swimmers into rip_currents , &quot; Beuerlein said . &quot; We just had five lifeguards in the water at one time between towers 3 and 5 . And that wasn ' t the first time today. &quot; The humidity that lingered throughout the county Thursday is expected to subside today and this weekend , McKewon said . Thursday started_out at 85 % humidity in the county at 7 a.m. and , by 2 p.m. , had tapered_off to a more typical 27 % , McKewon said . For those wilting in the heat , the good news is that an increasing onshore wind should cool the coasts today , perhaps three or four degrees , McKewon said . But anyone traveling inland should expect to be using the air conditioner or a portable fan . Places like Burbank , Lancaster and Palmdale , where the Mercury topped 100 degrees Thursday , are expected to be in the upper 90s today , McKewon said . Van Nuys , where it was 107 degrees Thursday , will again jump over 100 today , he said . &quot; The air_mass is basically stagnant right now . You ' re just getting intense heating , &quot; McKewon said . Over the weekend , it will remain warm and sunny with patchy low clouds at the coast in the morning and at night , McKewon said . Highs will stay in the 70s to low 80s at the coast , and up into the mid-90s inland , he said . Unlike areas of the San Gabriel Valley , where air quality hit hazardous levels Thursday , smog levels were generally low throughout Orange County , according to the South Coast Air Quality Management District . McKewon said the heat_wave is_due to a strong high_pressure system . The system is supposed to be over the Texas Panhandle this time_of_year , but instead has migrated westward . Because the system suppresses the down flow of air , it inhibits the formation of clouds , &quot; allowing full solar heating over the Southern California area , &quot; he said . To make matters worse , the offshore airflow that normally moderates temperatures is almost nonexistent . &quot; It ' s common in the summer to have a low-pressure system over the deserts , and this causes air to blow in from the ocean toward the lower_pressure , &quot; McKewon said . &quot; This cools_off the coast and , to a certain extent , the valleys . &quot; But the air_mass is basically stagnant right now . You ' re just getting intense heating. &quot; It ' s Hot , Hot , Hot While the thermometer hit a record 100 degrees at an Irvine Ranch weather_station , the combination of temperature and humidity--measured by the heat index--made it feel hotter . Here is how the temperature recorded this week at WeatherData ' s Tustin station compares to record highs in previous years : 04 # 11 , 10 # 13 , 22 Humidity Temperature Recorded high ( date ) Monday 55 % 84 97 ( Aug . 8 , 1950 ) Tuesday 41 % 93 97 ( Aug . 9 , 1965 ) Wednesday 35 % 94 95 ( Aug . 10 , 1965 ) Thursday 28 % 98 90 ( Aug . 11 , 1971 ) Today * 31 % 98 98 ( Aug . 12 , 1991 ) Saturday * 25 % 94 100 ( Aug . 13 , 1983 ) Sunday * 35 % 92 97 ( Aug . 14 , 1983 ) * Forecast Heat Index : Here ' s How Hot It Feels The heat index is derived from a formula that involves air temperature , relative_humidity and the body ' s ability to cool itself . For example , today the temperature in Tustin is expected to reach 98 degrees with 31 % humidity . That makes you feel as though the temperature is really 101 . 12 # 10 , 05 # 05 , 05 # 05 , 05 # 05 , 05 # 05 , 05 # 05 , 06 Humidity * 11 * Temperature 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100 25 % 88 89 91 93 94 95 96 97 98 100 102 26 % 88 89 91 93 94 95 96 97 98 100 102 27 % 88 90 91 93 94 95 96 98 99 101 103 28 % 89 90 91 93 94 95 96 98 100 101 103 29 % 89 90 91 93 94 95 96 98 100 101 103 30 % 90 91 92 94 95 96 97 99 101 102 104 31 % 90 91 92 94 95 96 97 99 101 102 104 32 % 90 91 93 94 96 97 98 100 102 103 105 33 % 90 91 93 94 96 97 99 100 102 104 106 34 % 90 91 93 94 96 97 99 100 102 104 106 35 % 91 92 94 95 97 98 100 101 103 105 107 36 % 91 92 94 95 97 98 100 102 103 106 107 37 % 91 93 95 96 98 99 101 102 104 107 108 38 % 91 93 95 96 98 99 101 103 105 108 109 39 % 91 93 95 96 98 99 101 103 105 109 109 40 % 92 94 96 97 99 100 102 104 106 108 110 Source : WeatherData ; Researched by APRIL JACKSON / Los Angeles Times</TEXT>
