   <TEXT> So you ' re feeling a little pang of guilt for something you did , or said , or bought , or thought . There it is , that creepy emotion that nibbles at your gut , flattens your smile and bombards your brain with conflicting commands to atone and deny . But before you write_off this experience as a distasteful form of self-punishment , keep this in mind : Feeling guilty can be good_for_you . In a new study that analyzes years of guilt research , and confirms what mothers have known all along , psychologist Roy F . Baumeister of Case Western Reserve University in Ohio , and colleagues , found that guilt usually benefits someone -- sometimes even the guilty party . &quot; The cultural stereotype is that guilt is a waste or a worthless emotion , that there is no point in feeling guilty , &quot; he says . &quot; But guilt seems to have a purpose. &quot; For example , he says : &quot; You would n ' t want to have someone with no sense of guilt as a roommate or spouse or business partner . Guilt seems to benefit relationships . I think the bad reputation comes from the idea that the person feeling guilty doesn ' t benefit. &quot; But that person does , and so does everyone else , he says . The guilt research is noteworthy in the study of psychology because many theories on emotion suggest that feeling guilty is an individual experience that holds no consequence for others . &quot; Psychologists have tended to think_about guilt in terms of the individual psyche , &quot; Baumeister says . &quot; But the evidence shows guilt depends_on the interpersonal context . Guilt tends to be a two-person kind of thing. &quot; Guilt usually serves three main functions , the researchers found : to maintain relationships , to exert influence and to redistribute emotional stress . &quot; We found the single biggest cause of guilt people have is not spending enough time with their families or their loved ones , &quot; Baumeister says . &quot; So guilt is a big force to make people pay_attention to other people. &quot; Sherry , a Los Angeles business_executive , knows guilt both as an inflicter and a sufferer . She says she often felt resentful years ago when her husband would come_home late because of a business meeting . At home all day caring for the couple ' s children , she would refuse to cook his dinner if he missed the normal mealtime . But now that she has her own frenetic career -- which often requires those same late-night commitments -- she feels guilty . &quot; If I have a dinner meeting or have to meet someone for drinks , and he is not invited , I feel guilty , &quot; she says . &quot; The next day , I feel that I have to make nice-nice . I might pick_up his laundry or make breakfast for him. &quot; The special attention lets him know she cares about him , Sherry says , and makes her feel better too . Guilt also helps people in close relationships control each other ' s behavior , Baumeister says . One example is someone who employs the phrase , &quot; If you loved me , you would n ' t do that. &quot; &quot; The person with less power can get his or her way by using guilt , &quot; he says . &quot; Guilt is a good strategy for the weaker person in the relationship . Guilt is a power-equalizing strategy. &quot; Finally , guilt can redistribute emotions . If you feel guilty over not taking_out the garbage , chances are your spouse -- who wanted the garbage taken_out -- will feel better knowing that . &quot; In this way , emotional equity is restored because bad feelings are restored to the person who caused them , &quot; Baumeister says . &quot; Feeling guilty is a way of showing that one cares. &quot; The researchers also found evidence that guilt arises from the emotions linked to relationships . &quot; What are the roots of guilt ? The data are converging on two sources . One is empathy . You feel bad when someone else is hurting . That starts early in life . One study showed it starts the second day of life , &quot; he says . &quot; The other ( cause ) is anxiety over the loss of a relationship : being rejected or excluded . When you are doing something that may drive someone away , that can produce guilt. &quot; This anxiety may even be a reason that women feel more guilty over extramarital affairs than men . According to the new book &quot; Heterosexuality , &quot; by Williams Masters , Virginia Johnson and Robert Kolodny , women more often than men break_off an extramarital affair because they feel guilty . &quot; That is because extramarital_sex means different things to men and women , &quot; Baumeister says . Women in affairs tend to become involved in deep relationships but men often say their affairs are casual and that they still love their wives and want to remain married , he says . &quot; Women tend to ( have affairs ) more as an intimate investment that would threaten their relationship , &quot; he says . &quot; The guilt is based on the wrong to your partner . Having an intimate , ongoing relationship is a threat , so it should provoke more guilt. &quot; Even though guilt may do_good , people don ' t like feeling guilty . &quot; People do try to avoid it , &quot; Baumeister says . &quot; They will rationalize what they did_in their own mind or they will try to make_it up_to the person they wronged. &quot;</TEXT>
