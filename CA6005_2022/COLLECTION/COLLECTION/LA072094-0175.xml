   <HEADLINE> BLOODIED CROWBAR FOUND AT MURDER_SUSPECT ' S HOME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A search of the country_club home of John Joseph Famalaro -- who has been charged with the murder of Denise Huber , a former Northridge woman -- turned_up a bloodied crowbar Tuesday that police consider a possible murder weapon . Still fearing other victims , authorities were successful in tracking_down at least five of nine women in Southern California and Phoenix whose names appeared on a list seized at Famalaro ' s home . Detectives planned to appeal for the public ' s help today in locating the remainder of the names on the list , which included Huber ' s . Court documents filed Tuesday in Arizona indicated that police have seized numerous items from Famalaro ' s home , including articles of women ' s clothing , some of which appear to be stained with blood , a blood-tainted tarpaulin and the crowbar that police suspect might be the murder weapon . Robert Shoults , whose wife , Gloria , was_on the list , expressed surprise because their only connection with Famalaro was that they had sold him a van two years ago . The police , who called to check on Gloria ' s well-being , &quot; said that her name had turned_up on some papers they had found , &quot; said Shoults , of Dewey , Ariz . &quot; Having somebody like that in your neighborhood I guess does make your hair stand_up a little bit , because this is generally a quiet area. &quot; The revelations came days after the body of Huber , 23 at the time of her disappearance , was found in a freezer in the back of a stolen rental truck parked in Famalaro ' s driveway . Huber , who had moved to Newport Beach , vanished three years ago after she became stranded on the Corona Del Mar Freeway after a flat_tire . Famalaro , 37 , is being held_in lieu of $ 250 # 000 bail . Huber was believed to have been bludgeoned to death , and a crowbar would be consistent with the type of weapon used , authorities said . In other developments Tuesday : * Authorities , who have not ruled_out additional suspects , said they want to question Famalaro ' s brother-in-law , Duane Thobe , and Famalaro ' s brother , Warren , in connection with the case . Warren Famalaro is a convicted child_molester . * Police concluded a comprehensive search of Famalaro ' s home , and expanded their search in Orange County , where Famalaro had rented several storage_lockers and kept the freezer before moving to Arizona . Using axes , rakes and shovels , authorities Tuesday dug as far down as 10 feet below the surface in three areas of Famalaro ' s home where cadaver-sniffing dogs had signaled the possible presence of something , but no new bodies were discovered . Police visited at least three storage facilities in Orange County Tuesday . Costa Mesa Det . Sgt . Jerry Holloway said investigators &quot; are finding some items of evidence that we can use , &quot; but he declined to elaborate . Investigators have also learned that people had been curious about the Ryder truck and the extension_cord running to it , but that when neighbors and acquaintances of Famalaro asked what was in the the freezer , he would reply : &quot; Meat. &quot; * Investigators are focusing_on reconstructing how Famalaro and Huber may have come_into contact the night of her disappearance , June 3 , 1991 , and his movements since . Although police said Tuesday they believe she was killed in Orange County shortly after her abduction and then transported via freezer , it may be difficult to fix a time and place of death because of the condition of her body . The freezer was purchased June 10 # 1991 , a week after Huber disappeared , at a Montgomery Ward &amp; Co . store in Orange County , according to documents filed by the Yavapai County Attorney ' s Office . Investigators are unable to explain why the corpse would have been carted around for years after the crime . &quot; that ' s what makes this case bizarre -- the way he moves a body around like this , &quot; said Costa Mesa police Lt . Ron Smith . &quot; It doesn ' t make any sense. &quot; Piecing together what little they have , police suspect Huber was killed , stored in the freezer in a Laguna Hills storage bin for a year , then moved to a San Clemente storage facility , where it was kept_in about a year and a half , before being transported to Famalaro ' s Prescott Country_Club home . * Law_enforcement sources alternately discounted and were intrigued by the theory that Famalaro may have lured Huber to her death by posing as a law_enforcement officer . Two phony Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department shirts were among the numerous items seized from his home . Both shirts had hand-made replicas of the Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s official patches sewn on them . Costa Mesa ' s Lt . Smith said he thought Huber was &quot; too smart to fall_for such a thing. &quot; &quot; One thing that weighs against that theory is that it ' s very unusual to have a uniformed officer with long hair and a beard , &quot; Smith said , adding that everyone police have interviewed said Famalaro has sported a beard and mustache for years . Other law_enforcement sources found the bogus-police theory credible , as did Huber ' s family . &quot; I couldn ' t believe that Denise would get_in a car with a stranger , &quot; Ione Huber , Denise ' s mother , said . &quot; This makes_sense . She would trust someone in a uniform. &quot; Discovery of the list of names initially fueled speculation that the murder of Huber could be one in a string of multiple killings . &quot; This case is far from over , &quot; said Yavapai County Sheriff ' s spokeswoman Laurie Berra . &quot; We have to make_sure we don ' t have additional victims. &quot; Famalaro ' s attorney , Lawrence William Katz , attacked the strength of the case against his client and the media coverage . &quot; We don ' t have a serial_killer here , &quot; Katz said . &quot; This coverage has been completely overdone. &quot; Katz said he fully expects a grand_jury to indict Famalaro by Thursday . He vowed that he would immediately seek to overturn the indictment on the basis that excessive publicity has compromised the grand_jury -- the same tactic used by O.J. Simpson ' s lawyers in his murder case . * Times staff writers Anna Cekola , Leslie Berkman , Michael Granberry , Greg Hernandez , Matt Lait , Mark Landsbaum , David Reyes , Rebecca Trounson and Jodi Wilgoren and correspondents Bob Elston , Shelby Grad and Jeffrey Bean contributed to this report .</TEXT>
