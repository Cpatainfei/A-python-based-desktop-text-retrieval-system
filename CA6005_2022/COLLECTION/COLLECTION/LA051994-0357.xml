   <HEADLINE> OUT AND ABOUT / SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS : A RANGE OF OUTDOOR ENJOYMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It may_not be Mt . Kilimanjaro or the_Swiss Alps . But as Jost Rhodius has discovered , the Santa Monica Mountain_range offers its own array of breathtaking vistas . Since he founded his business , &quot; Hiking in L.A. , &quot; a year ago , Rhodius has been conducting tours in English , German , French and Italian through the Santa Monica Mountains . Three-hour trips take visitors along trails to provide an overview of the plant_life , animals , geology and topography of the area . He also devotes a great_deal of time to discussing the history of the mountains and the culture of native inhabitants such_as the Chumash Indians . It ' s an ideal family excursion , Rhodius said . &quot; I say , ' Enjoy Disneyland but also experience the wondrous beauty of God ' s nature , ' &quot; said Rhodius , 37 , of Sherman Oaks . Tourists and local residents alike have found these hikes to be a great way to learn about and enjoy the wilderness . &quot; A lot of people don ' t realize there is hiking in Los Angeles , &quot; said Lynn Lewenberg , 22 , a senior at UC Santa Barbara . &quot; I am very interested in ( learning about ) the geography , plants and animals in this pristine area. &quot; Rhodius , a native of Dueren , Germany , developed an interest in hiking as a child and attributes his love of nature to his parents , who encouraged him to explore the outdoors . He has hiked in countries such_as Germany , Switzerland and Nepal . After graduating from the University of Zurich with a degree in economics , he went_to work for the_Swiss Bank Corp . A transfer five years ago brought Rhodius to the company ' s L.A. office . Instead of heading to the beach , the avid hiker looked_up_to the Santa Monica Mountains . Two years ago , Rhodius traded_in his briefcase and three-piece suits to pursue a longtime dream : running his own business . In preparation , he studied the history of the Santa Monica Mountains , hiked terrain along the Pacific_Ocean from Ventura County to Griffith Park , and visited libraries and museums . &quot; I think ( hiking ) is a little bit in my blood , &quot; Rhodius said . Tours are Monday through Friday , and by appointment on weekends . Cost : $ 25 for adults , $ 15 for children 11 and younger . Information : ( 818 ) 501-1005 . CHRISTINA V . GODBEY</TEXT>
