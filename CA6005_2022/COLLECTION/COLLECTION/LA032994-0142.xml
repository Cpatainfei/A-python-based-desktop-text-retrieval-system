   <HEADLINE> 48 CALIFORNIA FIRMS RANK IN FORTUNE 500</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the first time , California edged out New York as home to more of the nation ' s 500 biggest industrial companies than any other state , Fortune magazine reported . California is home to 48 companies in the 1993 edition of the magazine ' s annual ranking of the top 500 corporations , with previous leader New York falling to third with 43 . Among the California-based companies joining the Fortune 500 are : Solectron , based in Milpitas ; Synoptics Communications , Santa Clara ; Cisco Systems , Menlo Park , and 3Com , Santa Clara . The biggest California-based company on the list is Chevron of San Francisco , which fell to 11th from 8th the previous year . It was followed by Hewlett-Packard of Palo Alto , which rose to 19th from 24th . The biggest Southern California-based company was Atlantic Richfield of Los Angeles , unchanged at No . 22 . It was followed by Lockheed of Calabasas , up_to 35th from 45th , and Rockwell International of Seal Beach , down to 45th from 43rd . Also , after losing money in 1992 , the Fortune 500 as a group earned $ 62.6 billion in 1993 while slashing thousands of jobs , Fortune said . The profit figure would be enough to wipe_out the 1993 U.S. trade_deficit with Japan . Fortune attributed the improvement largely to &quot; American industry ' s steady , relentless drive to raise productivity , improve quality and boost competitiveness. &quot; Also helping were a decline in long-term interest_rates that lowered the cost of borrowing , a broad pickup in the U.S. economy and the expensive Japanese yen , which made U.S.-built products ranging from cars to computers more affordable than comparable Japanese goods . The improvement didn ' t benefit the U.S. job picture , however . Total employment among the 500 fell_for the ninth straight year , to 11.5 million from 11.8 million . The trend confirms a pattern of dwindling employment opportunities as businesses get more efficient with fewer workers . Fortune said the earnings improvement was especially significant because it was achieved despite stagnant growth in sales .</TEXT>
