   <HEADLINE> PARALEGALS STATE THEIR CASE ; ' LEGAL TECHNICIANS ' OFFER A LOW-COST ALTERNATIVE , BUT ARE STILL THE TARGET OF LAWYERS , BAR ASSOCIATIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It wasn ' t that long ago , perhaps a little more_than a decade , that Lois Isenberg used to keep her mouth shut at parties . Not about everything , just about what she did for a living . It seemed that whenever she mentioned that she was an independent paralegal , an attorney would step_forward and begin a nasty verbal assault . &quot; Up until the 1980s , it was always an underground movement , &quot; Isenberg said . &quot; We had to be quite circumspect about what we did. &quot; Isenberg may still be cautious , but she is no longer so circumspect . As president of the California Assn . of Independent Paralegals ( CAIP ) , and head of a mid-Wilshire paralegal firm , Isenberg fronts a growing movement to grant independent paralegals greater authority to provide legal services . She has faced powerful opposition from local , county and state bar associations , which view her and her compatriots as engaged in the unauthorized practice_of_law and a threat to business , and which have prosecuted independent paralegals in the past . To some attorneys , Isenberg and her colleagues are_better suited to their traditional roles of typing or doing research under the supervision of lawyers , where the paralegals don ' t run the risk of overextending their legal expertise and where they don ' t pose an an economic threat to them . Yet despite such opposition , independent paralegals -- or &quot; legal technicians , &quot; as they are also called -- are flourishing , and in the past decade have greatly expanded their portfolio and presence . In 1985 , paralegals -- both independent ones and those who work for lawyers -- were projected by the U.S. Department_of_Labor to make_up the nation ' s fastest-growing profession . Today , there are more_than 3 # 000 independent paralegals statewide , in addition to the more_than 10 # 000 traditional paralegals working in law_firms . And whereas 20 years ago few Californians got divorced or declared bankruptcy without lawyers , 70 % of divorces and bankruptcies in some smaller counties are now filed without attorneys . &quot; It made great sense to do_it this way , &quot; said Culver City financial planner Gael Kennedy , who used independent paralegals for two divorces . &quot; ( The divorces ) were just a matter of , ' How do you do the paperwork ? ' &quot; Kathy Love , a Rancho Cucamonga fund-raising executive who with her husband arranged an adoption , a child custody_case and his divorce from a previous spouse through paralegals , agreed . &quot; As long as you don ' t try to do something complicated , you really don ' t need legal representation. &quot; Much of the newfound prominence in the use and number of independent paralegals has been fueled by one simple factor : economics . At $ 150 an hour and up , most people find lawyers ' fees out_of_reach and overpriced for simple legal needs such_as divorces , landlord-tenant disputes , guardianships and immigration matters . When a client knows what he or she wants , Isenberg said , such matters usually can be resolved by having an independent paralegal type and file the proper documents and then letting the legal_system take its course , often for about one-third the cost of a lawyer . According to Kennedy , her divorces cost one-fifth of what they would have if she used attorneys . Love ' s paralegal fees for all three services totaled about $ 700 . &quot; You can ' t get an attorney for less than $ 150 an hour and with a $ 2 # 000 retainer , you can use that up overnight , &quot; said Richard Lubetzky , a Beverly Hills attorney and a director of CalJustice , a nonprofit consumer legal reform association . For Isenberg , the role of paralegal activist is not one she had envisioned when she entered the profession in 1973 . A producer of educational films , Isenberg was asked to lend her marketing skills to a paralegal opening a divorce firm in Santa Monica . But after a week , Isenberg said , the paralegal &quot; got_up from her desk , walked to the door and said , ' I don ' t want to do this . This business is yours. ' &quot; Isenberg , who was between films , grabbed at the chance to enter the emerging profession . After learning the basics of divorce form preparation from attorneys and other paralegals , she opened a business in her Los Angeles home , operating for several years on referrals . In 1980 , Isenberg moved to her present offices on Wilshire Boulevard , but still kept a low profile , fearing reprisals from local and state bar associations , which have prosecuted paralegals for &quot; UPL , &quot; or unfair practice_of_law . &quot; I had a little ad in the Yellow Pages and that was it , &quot; Isenberg said . &quot; It was difficult at that time to be doing what I did. &quot; But with the help of sympathetic attorneys who were promoting mediation as an alternative for divorcing couples , Isenberg cautiously expanded into other types of legal assistance . Now , in addition to child_support , custody and marital settlements , Isenberg ' s office prepares paperwork for adoptions , paternity suits and quitclaim_deeds . Two years ago , Isenberg became president of CAIP , a 6-year-old organization that has since doubled its membership to 200 paralegals . Yet while lawyers and representatives of bar associations say they regret that attorneys ' fees have become prohibitive , they also say that paralegals are not the answer . &quot; If the mission is to deliver low-cost legal help for the middle-class and poor , there are better solutions than this one , &quot; said P . Terry Anderlini , a San Mateo attorney and a past president of the state bar . &quot; We don ' t need to set_up a bureaucracy to license mini-lawyers who don ' t deliver a quality product to their clients. &quot; Anderlini says that while independent paralegals may have knowledge in narrow fields of the law , the problems of clients can invoke a larger web of legal complicity . A simple divorce , he said , may involve other legal issues , such_as trusts and estate planning , which may or may_not be in the purview of paralegals . &quot; People don ' t come_into your office and have their problems in a nice , neat legal box , &quot; said Anderlini , who proposes the introduction of low-cost legal clinics staffed by paralegals and overseen by attorneys in lieu of paralegals being given greater autonomy . &quot; You have to be cross-trained to know and identify legal issues. &quot; With this , Isenberg says she has little disagreement . Paralegals , she said , are bound by law not to provide any information other_than what forms to use to proceed in certain civil matters . If matters become more complicated , said Isenberg , she refers clients to a trusted cadre of lawyers , and indeed , good paralegals know when they need to step back . Isenberg herself supports the notion of having paralegals pass qualifying tests before they can begin practicing . However , the muddy issue of what constitutes legal advice is what has entangled independent paralegals with bar associations . In fact , one state bar committee charged with examining the role and possible regulation of &quot; legal technicians &quot; concluded that the concept was &quot; undefinable. &quot; Yet the upshot , Isenberg said , is that the door is open for qualified paralegals to be prosecuted on an array of technicalities . In one instance , she said , a paralegal was accused of giving legal advice because , among other things , she instructed a client to sign documents in black ink . In others , paralegals have been sued by bar associations for providing forms and legal self-help guides . To Isenberg , the real source of attorneys ' ire is the same reason clients use paralegals : the paralegals ' relatively low fees . Isenberg says lawyers fear losing business if independent paralegals are allowed to operate freely in the marketplace . &quot; It ' s totally a turf war , &quot; she said . &quot; They just see it as someone taking their ( business ) . &quot; That notion is disputed by Anderlini , who says that the fields paralegals work in do not usually appeal_to many attorneys . &quot; I think ( a turf war ) is the way independent paralegals would like to see it , &quot; Anderlini said . &quot; But the vast majority of practitioners I know don ' t see these matters as moneymakers. &quot; But Don Fischbach , president of the state bar , concedes that while some of the complaints he fields from fellow attorneys regarding paralegals concern the unfair practice_of_law issue , other lawyers do &quot; see it solely as a turf war. &quot;</TEXT>
