   <HEADLINE> U.S. COOL TO N . KOREA ' S A-PLANT PROPOSAL ; DIPLOMACY : PERRY SAYS OFFER TO ALLOW INSPECTORS TO MONITOR REFUELING AT NUCLEAR REACTOR DOES NOT GO_FAR ENOUGH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States reacted cautiously Friday to North_Korea ' s offer to allow international inspectors to monitor the refueling of its Yongbyon reactor , saying it was not clear they would get enough access to tell whether Pyongyang is building nuclear_weapons . At a press_conference Friday , Defense_Secretary William J . Perry said the North_Korean proposal did not spell_out important details about what kinds of conditions might be imposed on the inspectors , such_as whether they could take test samples of the spent fuel rods . The offer came_in a letter from Pyongyang to the International Atomic Energy Agency , which conducts the inspections . Agency experts said Friday that they were discussing the offer with North_Korean officials over the next few days to iron_out the details . However , in another move_in its long-running cat-and-mouse game with the West over the nuclear issue , Pyongyang said it plans to refuel its reactor in May , about two months earlier than expected . Refueling is a critical operation in producing weapons-grade plutonium . The mid-May refueling is expected to heighten pressure on the West , and could derail a crucial report that the IAEA was scheduled to issue at about that time declaring once and for all whether Pyongyang is complying with its nuclear-inspection obligations . &quot; We regard that as a step_in the wrong direction , &quot; Perry told a press_conference in Japan after a week ' s visit to discuss the situation in North_Korea with his counterparts in Seoul and Tokyo . He returned to Washington late Friday . Perry said it was critical that the IAEA inspectors be permitted to sample and test the fuel rods that are removed from the reactor because that is the only way they can measure the radioactivity of the spent fuel and determine whether it is being recycled for atomic weapons . &quot; It ' s very clear that the IAEA believes that you need more_than just physical presence in Yongbyon , &quot; the site of the reactor , for it to carry_out its inspections properly , he told a press_conference . Perry said reprocessing the spent fuel into plutonium , using facilities that North_Korea already has constructed , could provide enough fissionable material to manufacture between four and five nuclear_warheads . The defense chief warned that unless North_Korea gives IAEA inspectors the free_rein they need by the time it begins removing the spent fuel from its reactor , the United States , Japan and South_Korea will press for imposition of economic sanctions by the United Nations . And he said that if the Security_Council turns_down such a request , the allies might well act_on their own . &quot; I believe we would then seek a way of imposing some sort of international sanctions &quot; outside the U.N. structure , he said . The Yongbyon facility , which houses a 25-megawatt reactor , was built_in 1986 , but Western authorities suspect that it may have been refueled clandestinely three years later , with the spent fuel being reprocessed into weapons-grade plutonium . The CIA has estimated that North_Korea may already have manufactured one or two nuclear bombs and is in the early stages of developing longer-range missiles that could deliver nuclear_warheads . The refueling planned for May is important to Western authorities because the Yongbyon reactor contains enough spent fuel to enable North_Korea to expand a nuclear arsenal substantially . U.S. officials are worried that if Pyongyang is allowed to expand a nuclear_weapons program , it not only will threaten South_Korea and Japan , but it may export warheads around the world . The IAEA demand for access to North_Korea ' s nuclear plants actually involves three separate parts : The organization wants first to complete the inspections that it began in March , but had to break_off because of restrictions that the North_Koreas imposed ; monitor the refueling at Yongbyon , and visit other nuclear sites .</TEXT>
