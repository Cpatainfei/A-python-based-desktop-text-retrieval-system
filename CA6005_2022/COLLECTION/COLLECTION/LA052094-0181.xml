   <HEADLINE> SCIENTIST LEARNS TOXIC ALGAE HEALTH THREAT FIRSTHAND ; RESEARCH : HE SUFFERS SERIOUS MENTAL IMPAIRMENT WHILE STUDYING ORGANISM . HEALTH RETURNS AFTER ENDING EXPOSURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Howard Glasgow ' s mental collapse began one night last December when he nudged his wife awake and flew into a rage about how she had left the vacuum cleaner cord draped loosely over the handle . &quot; Why didn ' t you coil it ? &quot; he screamed . When he awoke the next morning , Glasgow refused to believe his outburst had happened . A few days later , Glasgow got lost for two hours on his way home from work -- even though he has lived_in the same house for seven years . When he tried to call his wife for help , he couldn ' t remember his phone_number . At work , the 37-year-old scientist started missing appointments and then insisted he never made them . He had long conversations with co-workers he instantly forgot . In time , he couldn ' t complete a short sentence without losing his train_of_thought and , although he had never suffered a speech impediment before , started to stutter so severely that he quit talking . Perhaps most painful of all , Glasgow -- who has college degrees in biology and chemistry and is a whiz at complex math formulas -- saw his reading comprehension plummet to match his 6-year-old daughter ' s . &quot; I would start reading something and I couldn ' t retain it . Absolutely none of it , &quot; said Glasgow , a research associate at North Carolina State University ' s aquatic ecology laboratory in Raleigh . &quot; It was like I was looking_at Chinese writing and couldn ' t make any sense of it . And this was pretty simple stuff. &quot; After a barrage of medical tests in December and January , Glasgow learned his body was under siege . His heartbeat and blood_pressure were wildly erratic , his liver enzymes had shot_up , he was prone to infections and his kidneys were excreting unusual amounts of phosphate . Physicians and marine scientists who studied Glasgow ' s case now suspect toxic marine algae , known for killing millions of fish off the Atlantic Coast , had slowly poisoned Glasgow while he worked in the laboratory . Invisible to the naked eye , the dinoflagellate -- a phantom-like half-plant , half-animal microorganism -- thrives in shallow bay waters along the East Coast that are polluted with phosphates , a widely dispersed nutrient in sewage and farm runoff . For two years , Glasgow studied the one-celled creature , mostly working alone in the lab next to rows of 2 1 / 2-gallon fish_tanks containing water from North Carolina ' s Pamlico Estuary , a coastal bay inhabited by the organism . The creatures apparently excreted a powerful toxin into the aquarium water -- and eventually the laboratory air -- that jumbled Glasgow ' s brain simply by sharing the same room with him , scientists and physicians believe . Glasgow , who took two months off to recover , now seems nearly normal and has returned to work . Apparently , the damage to his brain was gradually reversed once he distanced himself from the organism . North Carolina State aquatic botanist JoAnn Burkholder , who directs the laboratory , called her research associate ' s ordeal an amazing story about &quot; an organism that seems to have dropped_out of some Stephen King movie. &quot; Although some marine algae , including red tides , are known to be toxic to fish and contaminate shellfish , this is the first known instance of a human poisoned directly by them . Glasgow ' s ordeal is especially alarming because the dinoflagellate has been found in large concentrations from Delaware to Florida in bay waters that are popular_with millions of swimmers , fishermen and boaters . No one knows yet if the organism inhabits estuaries along the Pacific coast . Burkholder and other scientists and neurologists caution that research into Glasgow ' s syndrome is in the fledgling stages and that they cannot prove the organism was to blame until the damaging toxin is isolated . Even so , they call the medical evidence overwhelming , and Burkholder says she is &quot; personally dead certain. &quot; Two other researchers who worked with the organism reported similar but less severe symptoms , including Burkholder , who said she suffered an eight-day bout of disorientation and short-term_memory loss last year . Others reported vague problems such_as nausea , eye irritation and breathing difficulties that may be related . &quot; I can ' t say for_sure there are chronic , insidious effects on human health , but I think there are , &quot; said Burkholder , who discovered the dinoflagellate in 1988 after striped bass died in a colleague ' s aquarium . &quot; I think it ' s real , considering everything that ' s happened to people who work with it . We have a lot of strange , anecdotal information . Everyone who works with this organism seems to have problems. &quot; Dr. Donald Schmechel , a neurologist who heads Duke University Medical_Center ' s Memory Disorders Clinic , declined to talk_about Glasgow ' s case because of patient confidentiality . But in March 31 medical_records , Schmechel said Glasgow seems to have suffered a &quot; toxic encephalopathy , &quot; or brain disorder , apparently caused by &quot; exposures in the workplace due_to biological toxin. &quot; The part of his brain deep within the left temporal_lobe was damaged , wiping_out his memory , especially his verbal memory -- which means he could not recall what he said or what was said to him -- and triggering &quot; episodic rage as well as depression , &quot; according to the medical_records . The toxin also may have suppressed his immune_system . &quot; This was not a functional or psychiatric disorder but was clearly organic , and apparently a mostly reversible injury presumably secondary to marine biological toxin based on your exposure and symptoms , &quot; Schmechel reported . Glasgow ' s syndrome adds a bizarre twist to a new phenomenon of poisonous algae blooms that have been found in increasing numbers around the world . Before the mid-1980s , only a handful of poisonous algae species were known to kill fish . But since then marine researchers have discovered 10 species around the world , including one in 1987 that killed sea_birds in California ' s Monterey Bay and sickened people who ate shellfish in Oregon and Washington . Burkholder has found the dinoflagellate that apparently poisoned Glasgow in every state she has looked -- North Carolina , Delaware , Alabama , Virginia , South Carolina , Maryland and Florida . In 1991 , it was linked to a massive fish kill in North Carolina ' s Pamlico Estuary . Worried about public health , North Carolina environmental officials last month began exploring whether shrimpers and other fishermen who frequent Pamlico Estuary are suffering unusual neurological symptoms and other ailments . Some fishermen have told researchers about periodic memory lapses and sores that don ' t heal . &quot; I don ' t think people need to be scared , but they need to be made aware that there is a potential for human health_problems as far as the estuary goes , &quot; Glasgow said . &quot; Along the Atlantic seaboard , at this point , everywhere we ' ve had fish kills , we ' ve had these organisms present. &quot; The health worries are a legitimate concern , said Don Anderson , a senior scientist at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute who specializes in toxic algae . &quot; When you ' ve got so many big fish kills caused by this organism , it is very possible there is a danger to a fisherman or a passerby or scientist sampling the water , &quot; Anderson said . &quot; If the winds blow_over the dead fish and there are all these ( toxic ) cells there , you could imagine ( someone being harmed ) . &quot; Daniel Baden , a marine toxicologist at the University of Miami who is trying to isolate and identify the poisonous substance in the dinoflagellate , agrees . &quot; If you have acute problems in the laboratory , you probably have chronic effects in the environment where people are exposed naturally , &quot; Baden said . The biggest mystery is how the creature poisons humans and fish . Baden is trying to isolate the toxin by extracting bits of matter from the organism and testing each one for toxicity to fish . Then researchers can explore how the culprit interacts with fish and humans . Does_it attack through the respiratory_system or the skin ? Does_it target certain nerves ? Until recently , little has been known about how toxic forms of algae function . &quot; There is a consensus that this whole problem of red tides and what we are now calling harmful algae is worse all_over the U.S. , &quot; Anderson said . &quot; Where the line is starting to split , though , is whether this is a reflection of some fundamental coastal change such_as pollution , or whether it is many different things. &quot; Researchers suspect that the surge in toxic algae is related to nitrogen and phosphorus , nutrients in sewage and farm runoff that feed algae blooms and deplete oxygen in a process called eutrophication . Many marine experts believe the nutrients are causing a slow environmental shift in coastal waters to make them more hospitable to toxic organisms . Others , however , say some of the new toxic species may be turning_up because of more sophisticated research techniques . &quot; It is an open question of how many of the blooms are new and how many just hadn ' t been discovered before . It makes_good sense that nutrients have something to do with it , but that is hard to prove , &quot; said David Garrison , a National Science Foundation oceanographer who studied toxic blooms in Monterey Bay and the Pacific Northwest and found no link to nutrients . The creatures in Glasgow ' s case act like phantoms in the sea , hiding in sediments and waiting for fish or shellfish -- any species or size -- before they attack . They excrete a toxin that attacks the fish ' s nervous_system , devour the fish , then quickly mutate into 15 other stages and retreat to the sediments to await their next prey . They often wait for years . &quot; It is the worst-behaved dinoflagellate we have seen , &quot; Burkholder said . &quot; It absolutely zeros_in on fish . We shove a piece of fish tissue toward it and it starts to go crazy . It is more sneaky , more insidious and we don ' t really know how much damage it is causing yet. &quot; Burkholder said the organism is probably expanding in scope because nutrient contamination that feeds algae blooms is worsening due_to population growth along the shoreline . The highest algae concentrations are found near sewage outfalls , and laboratory tests show the algae grow rapidly in waters containing phosphates but not other pollutants . Marine experts suspect the organism inhabits coastal estuaries worldwide , particularly shallow , turbid bays with warm water that are prone to algae buildup . &quot; You probably have fish kills all_over the place because of this organism , &quot; said Karen Steidinger , a senior research scientist at Florida Marine Research Institute . &quot; My gut feeling is these things are fairly common in back bay shallow areas which tend to be high in nutrients. &quot; The creature ' s habit of altering its appearance and lying_in_wait for prey is so unusual that few marine researchers believed it existed until Burkholder filmed it and Steidinger , a nationally known algae expert , confirmed her discovery . &quot; It was such a ' Star Wars , ' alien scenario , &quot; said Raymond Alden , director of a marine research laboratory at Old_Dominion University in Virginia . Glasgow ' s first hint of something wrong dates_back to 1991 , just a_few months after he began working with cultures of the organism . He was reaching toward a tall shelf to gather materials when he realized his mind was racing but his hand was moving_in slow_motion . He went outside for fresh air and the feeling quickly passed . For months , bouts of dizziness , moodiness and forgetfulness occurred off and on , even after his research was switched twice to different sites . The signs were so subtle that his wife and friends wrote it off to the vagaries of a scientist under stress . Then , the Monday after last Thanksgiving , Glasgow accidentally dropped some cultures on his arm , producing a huge , festering sore that quickly became infected . His wife Aileen , watched her good-natured and intelligent husband of 20 years fall_apart before her eyes within two weeks . &quot; Howard got_worse and worse , &quot; Aileen Glasgow said . &quot; There were times where he would virtually give_up speaking at all . He would get one word out , and then stutter , then forget what he was saying . Bless his heart . He was very frustrated , because he realized something was happening. &quot; At first , she feared her husband was suffering from Alzheimer ' s disease or a brain_tumor . But Duke University neurologists quickly linked his symptoms to exposure to some type of biological toxin . &quot; We were really concerned because he was forgetting literally everything that was said to him . He would go absolutely berserk about trivial things , &quot; Aileen Glasgow said . Glasgow , who took_off work from mid-December until late March , now seems nearly normal mentally and physically , although no one knows whether he will suffer further problems such_as liver damage . &quot; He has cleared_up so remarkably , but they don ' t think he will ever have his memory back , &quot; Aileen Glasgow said . &quot; The memories during that period simply didn ' t imprint on his brain , just like you took a photograph that didn ' t turn out. &quot; Although he has returned to his research lab , Glasgow will never again be able to work directly with the organism because doctors fear his exposure has left him ultra-sensitive to its toxin . Worst of all , he says , is the knowledge that the organism is still out_in the environment . &quot; I try to concentrate_on the science and what we can do about it from an environmental standpoint , &quot; Howard Glasgow said . &quot; If something can be learned from my exposure , all_the better. &quot;</TEXT>
