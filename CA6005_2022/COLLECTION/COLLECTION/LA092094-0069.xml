   <HEADLINE> GETTING OUT ALIVE , BEARLY ; NEIGHBORHOOD RALLIES TO PREVENT THE KILLING OF FREQUENT VISITOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An avocado-poaching , patio-prowling , 400-pound black_bear that had been trapped in a Monrovia neighborhood won a last-minute stay_of_execution Monday -- from Gov . Pete Wilson , no less -- after homeowners launched a campaign to save their intrusive friend . The last-minute reprieve came more_than a year after residents of Norumbega Drive first spotted &quot; Samson &quot; lumbering into someone ' s back yard . Residents said he had become a fixture in the upscale area , and some claimed even to have spotted his mate and cub . But this summer , officials said , his visits became more regular -- the bear would show_up at some houses like clockwork every night , lumbering into pools , dipping his backside into hot tubs , swiping avocados from the trees , even stopping by regularly at one family ' s back patio to watch TV through the glass door . Most of the locals said they did not fear the animal , believed to be about 9 years old , and knew enough to keep their distance . But when some residents caught him on videotape soaking in a spa , the spectacle -- aired on the local news -- captured the imagination of animal lovers , who feared the bear ultimately would be captured and destroyed . Indeed , by summer ' s end at least one homeowner , fearful of the wild animal ' s unpredictable nature , had complained to the California Department of Fish and Game , whose policy is to euthanize animals that stalk neighborhoods or show no fear of people . As the pro-bear contingent launched an appeal_to Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy ( R-Arcadia ) and Monrovia Mayor Robert T . Bartlett , state game_wardens methodically laid traps for the animal . On Sunday , Samson was finally trapped near a Norumbega Drive_home and taken_away in a massive cage . The development was relayed to Mountjoy and Bartlett , who on Monday appealed_to the governor for help . The governor , acknowledging that &quot; the bear has captured the imagination of well-wishers throughout the state , &quot; sent a letter to Fish and Game Director Boyd Gibbons , urging him to find some alternative to ending the bear ' s life . &quot; I would like you to personally review the situation and assure yourself that all reasonable alternatives to euthanization are pursued , &quot; Wilson wrote . That , however , may be a challenge , authorities said , because the bear ' s teeth have been &quot; ground down , &quot; which could mean that he might have difficulty feeding himself in the wild , said Patrick Moore , Fish and Game spokesman . * However , Moore promised , the bear will not be destroyed . He said the animal was being held at an undisclosed location for medical evaluation and will be moved today to a Fish and Game facility in Sacramento . Because Samson made himself too_much at_home in a populated area -- where he posed a threat to humans -- his next destination probably will be some form of captivity , Moore said . &quot; I doubt very much they ' re going to turn it loose , &quot; he said . Moore said the public outcry contributed to the decision not to destroy the bear , which had been spotted as recently as Friday night frolicking for two hours in the Norumbega Drive_back yard of Bonnie Forte . Forte said she did not bother Samson and the bear did not bother her . &quot; He ' s not endangering anyone ' s life , &quot; noted the resident of the foothill community , who was considering making &quot; Save Samson &quot; T-shirts . But Craig Bonholtzer , an animal rights activist who helped organize the Samson campaign , pointed to the fate of the bear that lumbered into an Azusa neighborhood in May . It was shot and killed by police . &quot; No one wants to see a repeat of the Azusa incident , &quot; Bonholtzer said . Assemblyman Mountjoy , who has lived near the foothills for more_than 30 years , said the incident was of particular interest to him . As a Monrovia resident , he said , he has had his own back yard encounters with bears , coyotes , raccoons and other animals . Close encounters with the wild , he said , are a fact of life in California ' s suburbs . &quot; Don ' t forget , &quot; he said . &quot; We moved_into their country . They didn ' t move_into ours. &quot;</TEXT>
