   <HEADLINE> THE STYLE FILES : THE PLAYERS ; MORE PEOPLE WHO NEVER MAKE HEADLINES ; THE CUSTOMS OFFICIAL ; JOHN HEINRICH , ENFORCER OF IMPORT RESTRICTIONS : &quot; THERE ' S A LOT OF MONEY IN THIS BUSINESS. &quot;</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than $ 140-billion worth of two-way trade flows through the Los Angeles and Long_Beach seaports and LAX in a single year . John H . Heinrich , district director for the U.S. Customs Service , heads the department responsible_for documenting and approving it all . &quot; Typically , the reaction you get when you say you work for customs is someone ' s story about coming_through the airport , &quot; he says . Like the recent case of the tourist who swallowed a condom filled with heroin . It leaked , says Heinrich , causing the man to go_into convulsions . &quot; He turned_around and sued us for false search , which he lost. &quot; Less titillating but just as big a concern is the illegal entry of textiles and apparel . &quot; Our main responsibility is to enforce trade agreements between the U.S. and foreign countries as well as check quotas and visa restrictions. &quot; Quotas are limitations on certain garments , such_as cotton T-shirts and silk blouses , or on raw_materials , imposed by the government to protect U.S. interests . Cheats are easily caught , he says , either through faulty documentation or through paid informants , locally and abroad . Suppose no one squeals ? &quot; Suspect merchandise can easily be examined under a microscope to determine its original point of origin , &quot; Heinrich says .</TEXT>
