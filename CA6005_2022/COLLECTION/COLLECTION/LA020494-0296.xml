   <HEADLINE> STRIKING OILS ; A CUSTOM CONCOCTION OR PERSONAL POTION FROM ONE OF O.C. ' S SPECIALTY SHOPS MAKES A ONE-OF-A KIND GIFT , SCENT WITH LOVE , FOR THAT ONE AND ONLY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Valentine ' s Day is coming , and love is in the air -- along with the scents of banana , watermelon , magnolia , cucumber and other exotics used to make custom-blended products that pamper the body . A growing number of specialty shops in Orange County offer shampoos , body lotions , oils and after-shaves custom-made with scents of their customers ' choosing . Many prefer these do-it-yourself body care products because they ' re more personal than the pre-formulated lotions and oils sold in department and drug stores . Would-be cupids can concoct massage oils and other love potions specifically for their beloved . Mixing_up your own shampoo or lotion is like playing scientist . Most shops offer customers a fragrance counter where they can sample the different scents by pulling wands from test_tubes filled with perfume oils . Once they ' ve picked a scent ( anything from almond to ylang-ylang ) , they wait while the unscented lotion or other body product they ' ve chosen is blended with a_few drops of the oil . Often choices don ' t stop at the nose . Sometimes a shopper can pick the color of the shampoo or the thickness of the lotions . He can even select the size of the bottle , which usually can be returned for a refill at a small discount . &quot; You can get our body lotions in the thickness you want , the size you want , the scent you want . Sometimes by the time people are done making all_of their choices , they hate me , &quot; jokes Patti Werrlein , owner of Scents of the Soul in Irvine . Her customers can choose from lotions in six thicknesses , foaming bath and shower gel in five colors , shaving gel and after-shave , massage oils and two kinds of shampoo and conditioner . Each product can be scented with any of the 160 perfume oils . There ' s coconut , orange blossom , cucumber ( &quot; it ' s great in a shower gel &quot; ) , passion_fruit , mango , vanilla , daffodil , blueberry , wisteria and watermelon . When a customer smells more_than three perfume oils , Werrlein offers them a whiff from a tin of coffee_beans to cleanse the nasal palate . Oatmeal is usually popular_with children , Werrlein says . Patchouli oil is one of her more popular scents , but she can ' t stand it . &quot; I think it smells like oil and dirt , &quot; she says , wrinkling her nose . Yet five minutes later , a woman walks into her boutique requesting a half-ounce of patchouli oil -- straight . Werrlein also offers &quot; designer duplicates &quot; that mimic brand-name fragrances . The copy-cat oils come_in 40 women ' s fragrances ( Chanel No . 5 , Giorgio ) and 20 fragrances for men ( Obsession , Eternity ) . They ' re less expensive than the real_thing ; most products come_in four sizes , from two ounces to 16 , and average $ 1 an ounce . &quot; Often they can get a fragrance in a really light lotion that isn ' t sold over the counter , &quot; Werrlein says . Custom-blending allows buyers to control the amount of scent they want in a product , says Heidi Blanton , manager of Millefleurs in Dana Point . &quot; They can have a light or heavy fragrance by adjusting the amount of oil , &quot; she says . Millefleurs carries lotions in three colors , body sprays , bath gels , shampoo and conditioners and body and massage oils that can be scented in one or more of 65 fragrances . The products come_in four- and eight-ounce bottles and cost about $ 1 an ounce . While fragrance oils might smell like orchids , honeysuckle and other plants , they ' re mostly synthetic . &quot; Computer_technology can copy the scent of any plant , &quot; Blanton says . A rose extract might cost $ 200 an ounce if it were a true essential_oil , Werrlein says . A half-ounce of her rose petal oil is $ 10 ; she says they smell identical , and a whiff of the sweet stuff is convincing . For purists interested in the therapeutic properties of scents , Bare Escentuals in Fashion Island Newport Beach offers more_than 15 pure plant extract oils , such_as eucalyptus , rosemary and chamomile , to flavor their line of massage oils and lotions , Vitamin_E body lotion , shampoo , conditioner and shower gel . The rest of the 70 scents offered in the shop are synthetic . Products average $ 1 per ounce and come_in different sized refillable bottles . Adding the extract oils costs extra -- from 5 cents to 33 cents a drop depending_on the herb . Most products require a_couple_of drops an ounce . &quot; This gives people their own special identity . When you go_into a department_store you ' re limited , &quot; says Vanessa O ' Connor , vice_president of stores for Bare Escentuals in San Francisco . &quot; Here you create your own scent . If you like floral and cinnamon , you can mix them together. &quot; Scents should be tried_on the body before buying , suggests Amanda Smart , manager of the Body Shop in South Coast Plaza , Costa Mesa . Fragrances smell differently than in the test_tube because the skin absorbs the oil , she says . The Body Shop stores in South Coast Plaza , Brea Mall and MainPlace / Santa Ana offer foaming bath_oil , lotions and massage oils that can be blended in 22 fragrances . Customers can visit the stores ' perfume tester bars and use glass dippers to choose from an earthy masculine scent such_as sandalwood or a sweet fragrance such_as rose or lilac . Their products also fall_in the $ 1-an-ounce range . &quot; It makes you feel unique when you ' re choosing your own scent rather than wearing what other people are wearing , &quot; Smart says .</TEXT>
