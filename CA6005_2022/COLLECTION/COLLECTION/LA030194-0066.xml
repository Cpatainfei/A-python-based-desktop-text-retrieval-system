   <TEXT> * The Feb . 19 article concerning gas leaks in the Red_Line subway tunnels is the latest in reports about problems plaguing the system . Why does the Metropolitan Transportation Authority insist on building subway tunnels under Los Angeles ? The high costs , ever-present gas hazards and long construction time are just not worth it . Instead , the MTA should be planning and building aboveground aerial systems . An aerial system uses elevated tracks supported by steel reinforced concrete columns . In an aerial system , there is no danger of poisonous or explosive gases and no problems of thin tunnels and leaking stations . When compared to a subway , an aerial system is much safer , has fewer problems , costs about half as much and could be built_in two-thirds the time or less . DENNIS A . PIERCE Los Angeles</TEXT>
