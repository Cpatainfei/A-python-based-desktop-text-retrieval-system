   <HEADLINE> SENATE OPPOSES ' RACIAL JUSTICE ' MEASURE ; EXECUTIONS : THE NON-BINDING VOTE SAYS THE CHAMBER IS AGAINST LETTING DEATH ROW INMATES CHALLENGE THEIR SENTENCES ON THE BASIS OF RACE BIAS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Senate on Wednesday expressed its opposition to a controversial provision contained in a House-approved crime bill that would allow persons convicted of capital crimes to challenge the death_penalty on the basis of racial bias . By a vote of 58 to 41 , the Senate passed a non-binding resolution opposing the &quot; racial justice act &quot; that the House narrowly approved as part of its comprehensive crime legislation . California ' s Democratic senators split on the issue . Sen . Dianne Feinstein , who faces reelection this year , voted for it . Sen . Barbara Boxer voted against it . The outcome in the Senate -- virtually identical to a vote on a similar bill in 1991 -- makes_it less likely that the House provision will survive in the final version of the crime bill to be worked_out by a Senate-House conference committee . However , Sen . Joseph R . Biden Jr . ( D-Del. ) , the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman who will lead the Senate delegation in the conference , said before the vote that he hoped to preserve a modified version of the provision . Studies have shown that blacks and other minorities are more likely to receive the death_penalty than whites and the death_penalty is imposed much more often when the victim is white . The racial justice act would have overturned a death_penalty if the defendant could prove by statistical evidence that racial bias was a factor_in imposing the sentence . In an unusual show of support for the House provision , several members of the Congressional Black Caucus took_to the Senate floor during the vote_in an effort to persuade senators to vote against the resolution . The Clinton_Administration has not taken a position on the issue . The provision was retained in the House crime bill by a narrow , 217 to 212 , vote after intense lobbying by Speaker Thomas S . Foley ( D-Wash. ) and his lieutenants . Its leading sponsors were Rep . Don Edwards ( D-San Jose ) and Rep . John Conyers Jr . ( D-Mich. ) , dean of the Black Caucus . Opponents , bolstered by strong statements against the provision by prosecutors and state_attorneys general , called it a sneak attack on the death_penalty that would halt executions . Advocates , however , said it was an effort to stop the persistent racial bias that has been documented in some parts of the South and West , where the death_penalty is sought disproportionately in cases involving black or Latino defendants . Sen . Orrin G . Hatch ( R-Utah ) , ranking GOP member of the Judiciary Committee , has indicated that Republicans may filibuster final passage of the crime bill if it contains any version of the provision , which he derided as a &quot; Death_Penalty Abolition Act. &quot; &quot; It would convert every death_penalty case into a massive sideshow of statistical squabbles and quota quarrels , &quot; Hatch declared . Biden , however , said the provision would allow capital_punishment to continue and would apply only to cases in which the defendant could prove that he or she was discriminated against on the basis of race . Sen . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) declared : &quot; The simple fact is that a black defendant is more likely to be given a death sentence than a white defendant and criminals who kill white_persons are more likely to receive the death_penalty than those who kill blacks. &quot; Sen . Carol Moseley-Braun ( D-Ill. ) , the only black senator , put it more strongly : &quot; The administration of the death_penalty is truly one of the last vestiges of apartheid left in our system . In far too many jurisdictions , race is the primary factor -- perhaps even the sole factor -- in determining whether a defendant in a capital case will be put to death. &quot;</TEXT>
