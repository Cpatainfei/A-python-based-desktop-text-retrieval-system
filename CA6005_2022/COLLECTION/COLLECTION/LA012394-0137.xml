   <HEADLINE> TRICKY PIT STOP ON INFORMATION HIGHWAY ; WHY PUBLIC ACCESS IS SUCH A KEY PUBLIC-POLICY QUESTION FOR AMERICA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The information revolution is hurling us into unknown economic and social challenges . The high-tech wiring of America is changing how we communicate , work and shop . Those who can afford to tap into the fast-expanding hodgepodge of communications services , E-mail and consumer electronics already enjoy the many benefits . Those who cannot are being left_behind . A widening gap between the technology haves and have-nots is not in the public interest . Closing the gap is . The Clinton_Administration recognizes the need ; as a result , it has made access to and affordability of the nation ' s emerging information superhighway a major priority in its National Information Infrastructure project . The acronym NII may soon become a familiar one . The grand vision is to have all classrooms , libraries , hospitals and clinics in the United States connected to the NII by the year 2000 . Vice_President Al Gore outlined the need for &quot; universal service &quot; during his speech on telecommunications earlier this month at UCLA . The Administration wants affordable access to information services for everyone . With technology increasingly defining jobs , lifestyles , entertainment and even education , those without access may be deprived of social and economic opportunities . In principle , then , universal service is desirable , much like rural electrification and telephone_service , over-the-air broadcast services and the interstate highway_system . But how is universal service to be financed ? Ah , that is the tricky question , one the Administration so far has deftly sidestepped . It is indeed difficult to craft accessibility rules , especially when existing on-line information services have yet to merge into the envisioned seamless web of communications networks , computers , databases and consumer electronics that will put vast amounts of information at a user ' s fingertips . Complicating the process is the scramble among telephone , cable , computer and media companies to get_into each other ' s businesses and markets . Should government ' s role be one of high-tech cop in directing universal service ? Should it be a federal investor , as in the electrification of rural America ? Should it guarantee the private sector a rate of return in exchange for making access affordable ? Or should the private sector provide universal service pro bono ? These questions are arising as the Clinton_Administration readies a legislative package on telecommunications . The goal is to encourage investment , promote competition and provide universal service within a flexible regulatory framework . As the vice_president aptly put it : &quot; It is easy to see where we need to go . It ' s hard to see how to get there. &quot; But get there we must .</TEXT>
