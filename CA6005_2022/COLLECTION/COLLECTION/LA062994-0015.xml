   <HEADLINE> IT ' S TIME FOR THEIR ' LUCK ' TO END ; CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS ' PURCHASES OF NEW STOCK OFFERINGS SHOULD BE BANNED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Apologists for the practice keep reciting , like a mantra , that there ' s nothing in the law or in the rules of the House or Senate to prevent a member of Congress from accepting first crack at buying usually lucrative new stock offerings . True , though this is really a shamelessly pathetic defense for something that is so transparently corrupting . A senator or representative who is invited to profit through the purchase of a hot new initial public stock offering ( IPO ) incurs an obligation to whoever arranged the deal : You did me a favor , now I owe you one . Even someone with the most rudimentary sense of what constitutes ethical behavior , say a child of 4 , can figure that out . It ' s insulting to argue that just because there ' s no specific ban in law , or in the ethical standards Congress writes for itself , such flagrant influence-buying therefore deserves to be seen as right or permissible . All that the absence of a ban shows is that the law and the standards both need toughening . Sen . Alfonse M . D ' Amato ( R-N.Y. ) made a quick $ 37 # 000 profit buying and selling the initial_public_offering in a small California computer company . Was he just lucky ? He was lucky indeed to be the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee , which among other things oversees the Securities and Exchange Commission . At the time that D ' Amato scored so big his stockbroker happened to be under investigation by the SEC for fraudulent sales practices and stock manipulation . Quelle surprise ! , as Miss Piggy would say . D ' Amato has plenty of company in the shady glades of congressional ethics . In the last two years Sens . Howard M . Metzenbaum ( D-Ohio ) , Barbara Boxer ( D-Calif. ) and Dale Bumpers ( D-Ark. ) have reported profiting from IPOs . So , among others , have Reps . Robert G . Torricelli ( D-N.J. ) , Gary L . Ackerman ( D-N.Y. ) and Nancy Pelosi ( D-San Francisco ) . House Speaker Thomas S . Foley ( D-Wash. ) made 42 trades_in IPOs in less than four years , earning more_than $ 100 # 000 . Some of the people named above would argue that as major investors they would be cut_in on IPO deals even if they weren ' t in Congress . Such offers are regularly made by brokers to favored customers , to the annoyance of small investors . But that argument ignores the self-evident fact that as soon as they took their oaths of office their private financial affairs became subject_to a degree of public scrutiny , the object of which was to detect any potential interest conflicts . Whenever anyone in government participates in a lucrative IPO deal such a conflict occurs . that ' s the problem . The remedy is apparent : A flat ban on IPO trades for anyone in government who remotely could be influenced by such acts of favoritism .</TEXT>
