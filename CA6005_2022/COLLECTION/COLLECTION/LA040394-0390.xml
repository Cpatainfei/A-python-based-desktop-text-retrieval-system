   <HEADLINE> TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS / ROBERT EISNER : CONCEPT OF A ' NATURAL RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT ' IS GROSSLY INFLATED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Economics long has had a reputation as the &quot; dismal science. &quot; We economists are_full of such aphorisms as &quot; There is no free lunch &quot; and &quot; No gain without pain. &quot; Some of the great classical economists insisted that we could not permanently raise the wages of workers living at the brink of starvation . If we tried to , they argued , we only would permit them to live longer , reproduce and increase the number of mouths to be fed from limited supplies of food . Real wages then would be forced down further , until enough people died of starvation for the shares of food -- and real wages -- of survivors to return to their original levels . There was a remedy proposed -- the 19th-Century original of the &quot; Just Say No &quot; injunction : Just say no , said the eminent Thomas_Malthus , to early marriage and sex to hold_down the population . No wonder economists were considered a dismal lot ! But all this is not just ancient history . Dear to the hearts of many economists working today -- and underlying the decisions of all too many policy-makers -- is the infamous concept of a &quot; natural rate of unemployment &quot; that we cannot over the long_run escape . According to this notion , if we try to get unemployment below the natural rate , we will bring_on increased inflation . And worse , as long as we stay below the &quot; natural &quot; unemployment_rate , inflation will keep accelerating . Only if unemployment is at the natural rate will inflation , whatever it is , stay constant . The natural rate is thus called the &quot; NAIRU &quot; -- the acronym for that mouthful , &quot; non-accelerating-inflation rate of unemployment. &quot; Getting and trying to keep unemployment even one percentage_point below NAIRU will presumably give us not just more inflation -- say , an increase from 2 % to 3 % . Rather , proponents of this view contend , it will mean inflation going first to 3 % , but then to 4 % and then 6 % and then 10 % and so on . Before long we will have hyperinflation , as in Germany between the world_wars , with people carrying wagons full of money to the bakery to buy a loaf_of_bread . The only way to stop inflation from increasing is to allow unemployment to get_back to its natural rate . But by then we will have a high -- if constant -- rate_of_inflation . To get inflation down again , the NAIRU theorists say , will require excess unemployment ; that is , unemployment higher than the natural rate . Since we presumably will not permit inflation to stay sky-high , accepting more inflation to reduce unemployment now would necessitate more unemployment later . But this is a doctrine with little or no consistent factual support . Unemployment in the United States has bounced all around its so-called natural rate with no indications of permanently accelerating inflation from our episodes of low unemployment . And if unemployment is natural , God has certainly treated his children differently in different times and places . Much of Western Europe used to have unemployment_rates well below ours , in the 2 % or 3 % range . But Europe has been experiencing double-digit rates for years -- without the accelerating deflation NAIRU doctrine calls_for . Japan ' s rate remains under 3 % -- with little or no inflation . * None of this seems to phase at least some &quot; natural raters. &quot; I have quipped , on the basis of fairly solid observation , that the difference between conservatives and liberals is that conservatives put the natural unemployment_rate around 6.5 % -- if they don ' t go_to the extreme of arguing that the actual unemployment_rate , no matter how high , is natural -- while liberals put it at 5.5 % . Of course we cannot expect the unemployment_rate to be zero . Economists allow_for some &quot; frictional &quot; unemployment . Even under conditions that we would call full_employment , some people may be briefly unemployed looking_for the right new job when they lose their old one . But we have had unemployment as low as 1.2 % , amid the huge government spending of World_War_II . If business can sell all it can produce , it will try to hire everyone available . During the Vietnam_War , from 1966 to 1969 , unemployment was in the 3 % range while inflation &quot; accelerated &quot; over the years 1968 to 1971 all_the way from 5.0 % to 5.4 % . From 1988 to 1990 , unemployment in the United States remained under 5.5 % , again below the presumed NAIRU , and the rate_of_inflation moved from 3.9 % in 1988 to 4.4 % in 1989 , remained at 4.4 % in 1990 and came_back down to 3.9 % in 1991 -- hardly evidence of dangerously accelerating inflation . Yet a minority of senators succeeded last year in blocking President Clinton ' s stimulus plan , which was designed to reduce unemployment . Their underlying objection was that stimulus could not work to reduce unemployment below its natural rate . And now Alan Greenspan shocks the financial world , and the economy , by moving to raise interest_rates -- in_order to combat an inflation that nobody can find . The justification ? The economy is doing too well ! If we don ' t slow it down and hence keep unemployment from getting below the current 6.5 % -- which Martin Feldstein , chairman of President Reagan ' s Council of Economic Advisers , is quoted as calling &quot; . . . essentially full_employment &quot; -- we shall have that accelerating inflation ! In deference to that dogma , more_than 8 million Americans remain totally unemployed , millions more can find only part-time jobs and still more millions are not even counted because they have given_up looking_for jobs . There is nothing natural or necessary about all this misery , or the damage to the economy .</TEXT>
