   <HEADLINE> ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS / LILLEHAMMER ; A GREAT ONE FOR CANADIANS ; HOCKEY : EMOTIONAL TEAM DEFEATS FINLAND , 5-3 , AND SETS_UP GOLD-MEDAL DUEL AGAINST SWEDEN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Defenseman Brad Werenka , the last addition to the Canadian Olympic team , arrived too late on Feb . 12 to attend the opening ceremony . But on Friday , he made_sure he will be in the event that closes the competition -- the gold-medal hockey_game . Werenka ' s wrist shot , set_up on a perfectly timed pass from the right-wing corner by Greg Johnson , broke a 2-2 tie and propelled Canada to a 5-3 semifinal victory over Finland and its second consecutive try at Olympic gold . Cutting diagonally toward the net from the right point , Werenka took the puck from Johnson and flicked it over the shoulder of Finnish goaltender Jukka Tammi at 4 minutes 27 seconds of the third_period , giving Canada ( 5-1-1 ) its first lead of the game and dealing Finland ( 6-1 ) an emotional blow it couldn ' t absorb . &quot; If I hadn ' t scored , I would have been in big trouble , &quot; said Werenka , who was so deep in the offensive zone that he would have been trapped if Canada had lost the puck . &quot; But that ' s the nature of the game . You ' ve got_to put your neck on the line sometimes . No guts , no glory. &quot; No problem for Canada , which pulled_out to a 5-2 lead before 5 # 237 at the Gjovik Cavern Hall before Finland stirred again . &quot; After the third goal we scored , there was only one team playing_on the ice , &quot; Canadian center Petr Nedved said . So now Canada will play Sweden for the gold Sunday . The Swedes fended off a late Russian rally in the other semifinal game , at Lillehammer , for a 4-3 victory . Sergei Berezine scored with 1:11 to play and Ravil Gusmanov scored with 1:01 to go , but Sweden ( 5-1-1 ) avenged its loss to Russia in last year ' s World Championships and advanced to the final . Sweden has never won an Olympic gold medal . Canada last won the gold in 1952 at Oslo . Canada lost the 1992 Olympic final to the Unified Team , successor to the Soviet_Union ' s powerhouse teams . &quot; To be in this position is just incredible , &quot; said Johnson , who is_on leave from the Detroit Red Wings and is forfeiting about $ 40 # 000 of his salary to play here . &quot; We ' re just a bunch of 20-year-old kids having fun . We ' re not ( Wayne ) Gretzkys or ( Mario ) Lemieuxes . We ' re a bunch of no-names , proud to be Canadians and playing hockey with a lot of emotion and desire to win. &quot; That emotion enabled them to beat a Finnish team that probably has more skill and certainly has more speed . The Finns , who had not trailed in their previous six games -- and had not given_up more_than two goals in any game -- appeared ready for another rout when they scored two quick goals early in the second_period . Sako Koivu scored first , when his slap shot bounced off the skate of Canadian defenseman Brad Schlegel and past goalie Corey Hirsch at 2:08 , during a power_play . Esa Keskinen extended the lead to 2-0 on a hard shot through Hirsch ' s pads at 3:48 . But instead of building on that lead , the Finns sat_back . &quot; We got those two goals and we started to play an easy game , take the easy way_out , &quot; wing Mikko Makela said . Said Nedved : &quot; We knew it was going_to be a tough game , but we didn ' t quit . They had always gotten the early lead and after the first_period in their other games , the game was over for them. &quot; Not this time . Canada broke_through at 15:59 of the second_period , when Todd Hlushko sliced a backhander past Tammi for a goal . The Finns complained about offside on the play , although no infraction was obvious . Then Nedved tied the score with 36 seconds left in the period on a play set_up when 5-foot-11 , 165-pound Paul Kariya shook_off two defenders and floated a pass to Chris Kontos in the slot . Kontos ' shot bounced off Raimo Helminen ' s foot and over to Nedved , who whipped it past a helpless Tammi . &quot; Ultimately we felt we were in a position to win when it was 2-2 , &quot; Canadian Coach Tom Renney said . &quot; We felt we had to be close to Finland , and if we ' d go_into the third even or down a goal , we had a chance. &quot; They made the most of it when Werenka , who had been playing only sparingly this season for the Edmonton Oilers , lifted his 30-foot shot over Tammi . Kariya initiated that play , too , looking over his shoulder_in the left-wing corner , finding Johnson and sliding a pass behind the net . &quot; I saw two guys coming_to me , so I knew Greg would be open , &quot; Kariya said . &quot; Greg made a great play to Werenka . . . . This was probably the best passing game I ' ve played . I was really seeing the ice well . It ' s funny , because today it was just situations where I had to pass because I didn ' t have a good shot. &quot; And because of that goal , and Jean Yves Roy ' s power-play slap shot at 7:30 and Greg Parks ' shot5 that beat Tammi on the glove side , Canada has a shot at the gold . &quot; All the people had expected that Team Finland should win this game , &quot; said Curt Lindstrom , Finland ' s coach . &quot; We came_to the tournament and were not favorites , but after we won in the quarterfinals ( a 6-1 victory over the United States ) , everybody talked too_much about Finland being the favorite team . It was very even and the two teams played very good defense . &quot; I ' m not sure it was the nerves today ( that hurt the Finns ) . It was the tactics from Team Canada . The result is fair . It was Canada ' s day today. &quot; It will bring_about the day Werenka has long dreamed of . &quot; The U.S. winning the gold medal in 1980 had the biggest impact an Olympic moment has had_on me , &quot; Werenka said . &quot; that ' s really been an inspiration to me. &quot; Said Kariya : &quot; I ' ve been dreaming of this for ages . Facing Sweden is what I ' ve been thinking_about for some reason . I always imagined myself playing in the ( final of ) the Olympic Games against Sweden . This is just unbelievable for me. &quot;</TEXT>
