   <HEADLINE> MAGEE GLAD TO BE BACK IN THE U.S.A. ; BASKETBALL : FORMER UC IRVINE STANDOUT IS READY TO ENJOY THE FRUITS OF HIS SUCCESSFUL 12-YEAR PRO CAREER IN EUROPEAN LEAGUES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How long has it been since Kevin Magee spent an autumn at_home in Southern California ? Apparently , a very , very long_time . &quot; This is the most exciting time of my life , &quot; said the former UC Irvine All-American who recently retired after 12 years of playing pro basketball in European leagues . &quot; I can ' t wait to see the leaves turn colors on the trees. &quot; Uh , Kevin , you might be in_for a disappointment there . But you can ' t deter his enthusiasm . He ' ll settle for watching Buddy Ryan ' s face turn colors . &quot; Then Monday Night Football , &quot; he said . &quot; Isn ' t Monday Night Football great ? &quot; Twelve years ago , Magee was deeply disappointed that he wasn ' t a first-round pick in the NBA , then hurt when the Phoenix Suns didn ' t offer him a guaranteed contract . He finally decided to take his chances in Verase , Italy . For 12 years , he fought his crusade in Italy , Spain , Israel and France , and has returned home with a capitalist ' s version of the Holy_Grail -- a string of investments that will allow him to live a life of leisure . Today , Magee is a very wealthy_man of 35 , sending his children off to school , having lunch with the contractor who is landscaping his new Rancho Santa Margarita home and pondering what to do with his spare_time . Today , Magee smiles a lot . Twelve years ago , he didn ' t . At UC Irvine , Magee was unstoppable , indefatigable and simply incredible . Game after game , he faced special defenses , double- and triple-team schemes and game after game , he foiled them . During his two seasons at Irvine , he twice was a first-team All-American and twice he was in the top 10 nationally in field-goal percentage , scoring and rebounding , a feat never before accomplished . Regarding Magee ' s chances to make_it in the NBA , Jerry West said , &quot; He ' s a great rebounder and a tremendous runner and that ' s what this league is all about. &quot; In March , 1982 , West predicted Magee would be drafted in the first_half of the first round . Three months and a less-than-inspired performance in an NBA pre-draft camp later , Magee ended_up going_in the second round , the 39th selection . &quot; I always counted_on playing in the NBA , but I really have no regrets , &quot; he said . &quot; At first , I was hurt that they didn ' t think I was worth a guaranteed contract_in the NBA and I thought I got the raw end of the deal . &quot; But in the NBA , I just would have been another player , another number . In Europe , I was almost like a Michael Jordan . I was voted most_valuable_player six times in three different leagues . I won eight rebounding titles in 12 years . I had an illustrious career. &quot; Magee made more_than $ 600 # 000 playing in Paris during his second-to-last season . In the mid-1980s , he signed a four-year , $ 1.2-million deal with Maccabi Tel Aviv that included a rent-free , five-bedroom home_in an upscale suburb , a new car , the hefty tuition for his kids to go_to a private American school , travel expenses for his family and a clause that paid all foreign taxes . Who needs the NBA ? &quot; My wife and kids had the chance to experience different countries and different cultures , &quot; he said . &quot; I did what I wanted to do , I had fun and I made a lot of money . &quot; Now , I would n ' t change nothing about my basketball career. &quot; The money was always guaranteed , but each move was a bit of a gamble nonetheless . Magee usually only had a notion of what he was getting_into . &quot; Israel ? &quot; he says , smiling . &quot; I expected nothing but sand and people riding camels. &quot; After a year in Italy , Magee signed a contract with Zaragosa of the Spanish League . He and his wife , Melanie , stayed in a hotel for the first two months . &quot; Jeremy was 10 months old then , &quot; Melanie said , &quot; and we didn ' t have a refrigerator so we either had to keep the formula in the sink or go_to the kitchen downstairs . It was pretty depressing. &quot; Said Kevin : &quot; We weren ' t used to being overseas , we both were crying like babies all_the time . You go_to the grocery_store , you can ' t read what anything is . You turn_on the TV , you can ' t tell what anyone is saying . &quot; I called Dennis ( Harwood , Magee ' s attorney / agent ) and said , ' Get me out of this contract . I ' ll come_home and get a job at McDonald ' s. ' I just didn ' t think I could take it . But Dennis told me to just hang_in there because it will get better . I figured it couldn ' t get_worse . And we hung_in there . . . we hung_in there for 12 years. &quot; Magee ' s next stop was a stint in Israel where he immediately endeared himself to the Tel Aviv fans by telling reporters how &quot; damned rude &quot; the people were and how bad the food was . &quot; Kevin ' s kind of opinionated , &quot; Melanie said , smiling . &quot; The journalists were really ( angry ) when he complained about the food and said the only reason he was in their country was to make money for his family. &quot; Magee tried to explain that &quot; I didn ' t mean no harm , &quot; but his rebounding and ability to flash the numbers on the scoreboard did more to soothe the fans ' anger than his semi-retraction . &quot; After I played a_few games , everything changed . But if I had been a ( lousy ) player , they probably would have ran me and my family out of the country. &quot; The Magees stayed six years and Maccabi played in the European Cup finals three times . By the time Magee decided to move_on and signed a contract with a team in Torino , Italy , one would figure he would be a seasoned traveler . &quot; I ' d been in the city two weeks and went_out to a restaurant with some guys from the team , &quot; Magee said . &quot; It was only 10 minutes from my apartment , so I figured I ' d be macho and drive myself . &quot; I left and started driving and driving and suddenly I was outside the city_limits . I said to myself , ' Let me turn_around . If I ' m going_to be lost , I ' m going_to be lost in Torino. ' I didn ' t have a number to call anybody or anything so I just kept driving and driving_in circles . It was foggy and cold and it was scary . &quot; Finally , about two hours later , I made_it back home . And for a month afterward , I didn ' t go anywhere without somebody who knew their way around. &quot; Just how good of a college player was Kevin Magee ? That depends_on who you ask . Pick your favorite hyperbole : * During his first season at Irvine , the Anteaters played Texas A &amp; M , which featured a towering front_line called &quot; The Wall. &quot; Magee went_over it like a low hurdle . He scored 31 points and grabbed 14 rebounds in a 91-74 upset . &quot; It was like a man came_into the YMCA to play with the boys , &quot; A &amp; M Coach Shelby Metcalf said afterward . * &quot; Bill ( Mulligan , then Irvine ' s coach ) would call timeout at a crucial spot , &quot; said Chapman Coach Mike Bokosky , then an Anteater assistant . &quot; Maybe we ' d make a little adjustment , Simple-Simon stuff , and then Bill would grab Kevin with both arms on his shoulders and look straight in his eyes and say , ' Kevin , go dominate. ' &quot; And Kevin would go_back out , grab a rebound , dunk on somebody , run the floor , block a shot , run the floor , catch_it back and finish . And then he ' d run_by the bench and look_at us like , ' Is that enough ? ' &quot; * &quot; I ' ve played with and against a lot of big guys who went_on to play in the NBA , ( Bob ) Thornton , ( Johnny ) Rodgers , ( Tod ) Murphy and others , and I always thought Kevin was the best , &quot; said Mark Spinn , a teammate at Irvine . &quot; The rule_in pick-up games was simple : The team that got Kevin won . If you needed a bucket , you dumped the ball into him and he scored . It was that simple . &quot; A few years ago , they set_up this game between some Irvine alumni and the South high_school all-star team . There were seven of us who showed_up , including Kevin and Wayne Englestad . I was talking to one of the ( high_school ) coaches before the game and he said , ' Gee , only seven guys , I hope you guys can give us a decent game because we ' re really going_to be running_up and down. ' I couldn ' t help but laugh . &quot; I think we beat them like 160-108 or something and Kevin had about 80. &quot; * &quot; I ' ve got a player now , &quot; said Mulligan , who coaches at Irvine Valley College , &quot; who is 6-11 , can run the floor like you ' ve never seen and shoot three pointers . &quot; He has a chance to be as_good_as Kevin . If he had Kevin ' s heart , he could be better than Kevin . But I don ' t think anyone will have Kevin ' s heart. &quot; In 1979 , when Mulligan was coaching at Saddleback College , he took under his wing a 255-pound steel worker from Mississippi on recommendation from a friend . In two seasons , Saddleback lost only twice with Magee in the lineup , in the State semifinals and final . When Mulligan took the coaching_job at UC Irvine , Magee went_with him . It is a fusion of loyalty that has never waned . &quot; This man is like a father to me , &quot; Magee said . &quot; I love him . I would do anything for him . I would dedicate my life to this man . &quot; He made me a man , made me accept responsibility and I love him for that. &quot; Magee was the fourth of six children born to Willie and Ina Mae Magee in the Ivanhoe Projects of Gary , Ind . When Magee was 12 , some gang members tried to persuade one of his older brothers to join , at gunpoint . Willie moved his family to Magnolia , Miss. , for safety reasons , but he stayed in Gary to keep his well-paying union job in the steel_mill . In their back yard in Magnolia , the Magee boys cleared a spot of dirt , punched a hole in the bottom of a metal wash basin and hung it on a fence post . By the time he attended South Pike High , basketball was second nature for Kevin Magee . The college recruiters came and were duly impressed , but Magee -- something of a momma ' s boy -- decided on Southeastern Louisiana , just 40 miles from home . Still homesick , he came_home every day . After three months , he came_home and never went_back . Then came a three-week stay_at the University of Houston before he was back home working_at a lumber mill . The late Jack Holly , then coach at College of the Ozarks in Clarksville , Ark. , persuaded Magee to give college basketball another try . Holly liked Magee , but Magee didn ' t like the school . Then came a call to Mulligan . Seems Magee had a sister in Oceanside and thought he might like California . Mulligan says the first time he saw him , Magee was nailing jumpers while wearing work boots . &quot; I wasn ' t rich , that ' s for_sure , &quot; Magee said , &quot; but I did have a pair of gym_shoes . The point is , my career was going_down the drain and the man saved my career . I would n ' t be where I am today without him . &quot; He was a breath of fresh air for me . He was understanding and fair . He may have shot from the hip sometimes , maybe you didn ' t want to hear what he had to say , but he was always honest with me . And that ' s all you can ask from a coach . . . or anybody for that matter. &quot; Mulligan can ' t help but shake his head when Magee suggests he is responsible_for his success . &quot; Kevin says that stuff about me , but it ' s really the other way around , &quot; Mulligan said . &quot; Kevin got me the job at Irvine . Kevin built the Bren Center . I owe a great_deal to him. &quot; Irvine ' s campus arena carries the name of the man who donated much of the money to build it , but Mulligan still calls it the &quot; house that Kevin built. &quot; Irvine officials may_not be ready to concede that , but on Saturday , Feb . 4 , during a game against New Mexico State , Irvine will officially retire No . 44 , &quot; the number of the best player ever to play_at UC Irvine , &quot; according to Coach Rod Baker . &quot; They ' re going to hang a banner up in the rafters , just like Boston Garden , &quot; Magee said , beaming . &quot; that ' s gonna be great. &quot; Each morning , Magee runs four laps around Lake Santa Margarita -- 4.4 miles -- and about once a week he shows_up at a South County gym and wows the gym rats in a pickup game . At 216 pounds , the 6-foot-8 Magee looks as fit as ever , but he doesn ' t have any regrets about his decision to retire . &quot; I was tired_of being overseas and the last couple of years Melanie and the kids weren ' t with me because the kids wanted to stay in school here , &quot; Magee said . &quot; But that wasn ' t really the biggest part . I was getting ( angry ) all_the time , upset with my teammates . I just didn ' t seem to love the game like I used to . I was just in it for the paycheck and when you ' re just in it for the paycheck , it ' s time to quit. &quot; And Magee has no illusions about a future in coaching . &quot; I don ' t have the patience , &quot; he says . &quot; Anyway , I ' ve been playing basketball since I was 12 and it ' s time to do something else . I ' m sick_of basketball. &quot; Still , Magee is aware that he needs to find something to do . Not the idle type and with no interest in golf or most other leisure pastimes -- and an acquired aversion to travel -- Magee admits he and Melanie are getting_on each other ' s nerves . &quot; I ' ve been off since April and I ' m going crazy , &quot; Magee said . &quot; I ' ve put a resume in at Converse , looking_for something in sales or promotions . I don ' t want to start my own business yet , because I don ' t want to throw a lot of money into something that two months down the road I might decide I don ' t want to do . &quot; But I ' ve got_to get_out of the house . What ' s the deal with all these talk_shows ? I told Melanie I ' m going_to go_out and pick_up cans if I don ' t get something else to do soon. &quot;</TEXT>
