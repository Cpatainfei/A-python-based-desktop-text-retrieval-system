   <HEADLINE> UNDER FIRE , BERLUSCONI DROPS DETENTION DECREE ; ITALY : ORDER LIMITING ARRESTS IN CORRUPTION CASES SPARKED UPROAR . CRISIS HAD THREATENED GOVERNMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bowing to public outrage and the likely collapse of his young coalition government , Italian Prime_Minister Silvio Berlusconi scrapped a controversial decree Tuesday that would have limited magistrates ' powers of arrest in corruption cases . Withdrawal of the decree represented a humiliating defeat for the billionaire media tycoon and political rookie , who was elected in March by an electorate in open rebellion against massive institutional corruption . Berlusconi said the decree , issued last week , was intended to protect the civil_rights of criminal suspects by ending pretrial detention for most white-collar crimes . Critics called it a bald attempt to short-circuit the work of magistrates investigating corruption and the Mafia . Opposition had mushroomed to encompass not only corruption-investigating magistrates who are some of the most respected public figures in the country but also Berlusconi ' s own coalition partners , thus seriously threatening his government ' s stability . On Tuesday , Berlusconi backed_away from a showdown he clearly would have lost and called a Cabinet meeting . Cabinet spokesman Giuliano Ferrara said the government agreed to withdraw the decree and resubmit the proposal as a bill for parliamentary approval . Ferrara , who has Cabinet rank , said that ministers agreed major cases of bribery and corruption should be restored to a list of offenses for which suspects could be remanded in custody . Berlusconi ' s two main coalition partners , Umberto Bossi of the Northern League and Gianfranco Fini of the National Alliance , opposed the decree and asked Berlusconi to scrap it in a letter made public Tuesday . &quot; The measure met with vast opposition in the country and the Parliament , with the result of a clear-cut division in the government majority , &quot; they said . Magistrates , who have used pretrial detention extensively against corruption and Mafia suspects , were among the strongest critics . A 30-month investigation into institutionalized corruption has netted more_than 3 # 000 political and business figures ; companies routinely paid kickbacks to individuals and political_parties in exchange for government contracts . The decree would have banned magistrates from using pretrial prison custody for suspects in about 30 types of crimes , among them offenses in public administration , more commonly known as bribery and corruption . The most dramatic reaction came from the judges themselves , chief of them Antonio di Pietro , the Milanese investigating magistrate who led the justice campaign against institutionalized corruption and rivals the Pope in the esteem in which he is held among Italians . Di Pietro and other magistrates discovered early on that a_few days in cells with &quot; common criminals &quot; was the quickest , surest way of enticing confessions from business people and politicians . On Friday , an outraged Di Pietro said he was resigning as the leading Tangentopoli ( Kickback City ) judge and asked_for a transfer in protest of the decree . Another threatened resignation came from Interior Minister Roberto Maroni , who claimed he was &quot; misled &quot; about the true content of the decree , written by Justice Minister Alfredo Biondi . As a quick result of the decree , scores of high-level politicians and business_leaders were freed from jail and remanded to house_arrest -- 124 of them , according to Italian newspapers . Speaking Monday on one of the three national television channels he owns , Berlusconi denied there was a threat the outcry could topple his government . But for the first time , his voice agitated and hoarse , Berlusconi did not rule_out a compromise , saying he was &quot; open_to improvements &quot; on the decree , from coalition members or the opposition . Italians tend to see pretrial detention as an aid to speedy justice in a country where cases typically drag_on for years , and his opponents accused Berlusconi of acting to support business allies and disgraced old-line political_parties and their scandal-tarnished leaders .</TEXT>
