   <HEADLINE> ON THE RECORD : CATCHING DEBUSSY ' S ELUSIVE ' PELLEAS '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> During the past quarter-century there have been seven or eight commercial recordings of Debussy ' s 1902 opera &quot; Pelleas et Melisande , &quot; to a text drawn from Maeterlick ' s dense , otherwise long-forgotten symbolist play of the same name . For one reason or another , all those recordings are unsatisfactory , either so heavily weighted toward the orchestra and a conductor ' s &quot; concept &quot; ( Karajan / EMI ) that the singers become mere props , or because of damaging mis- or under-casting ( Dutoit / London , Abbado / Deutsche Grammophon ) , or a lack of what is generally called &quot; atmosphere &quot; ( Jordan / Erato ) . Even in such a thoughtful effort as that led by Pierre Boulez ( Sony ) , one has to lament how much better things could have been with just a bit more sensitivity , at the very least on the recording producer ' s part . Obviously , &quot; Pelleas &quot; is fragile goods , whose air of beguiling mystery is shattered by flaws that might elsewhere be regarded_as negligible . What a joy , then , to welcome two recordings of the opera that treat the work with such thoroughgoing sympathy and understanding : Philips ' reissue of its 1953 Paris recording , handsomely remastered on two mid-priced CDs ( 434 783 ) , and what we used to call a &quot; pirate &quot; recording -- unauthorized , but not actionably so ( due_to lax Italian copyright regulations ) -- of a 1969 Rome radio_broadcast ( Great Opera Performances 711 , 3 CDs ) . The Philips entry has as its first advantage the authentically French ( as Debussy would have recognized it ) playing of the Lamoureux Orchestra , particularly its flavorfully vibrating brasses , exemplifying a national style we regarded_as dated and expendable a_few decades back , and which many of us sorely miss in our own age of orchestral homogenization . The conductor is the late Jean Fournet , a master of the idiom , leading an interpretation that stresses the score ' s dark , surging drama without slighting its mysteries . Outstanding in the cast is the Pelleas of the late Camille Maurane , a high , light baritone of the type specified by the composer , and for three decades among Europe ' s foremost interpreters of the role . As a vocal actor , Maurane projects an excitable guilelessness , within a context of optimum vocal refinement . His partner is the likewise recently deceased Janine Micheau , not the possessor of the ideally sweet and clean Melisande voice , but an artist of deep intelligence and verbal communicativeness . Michel Roux ' s very Gallic , nasal Golaud is explosive and winningly human as the opera ' s catalytic center . And in the by-no-means-inconsequential secondary roles , Rita Gorr is a Genevieve of uncommon vocal richness , Xavier Depraz a mellifluous Arkel and Annik Simon an incisive , non-cloying Yniold . The Rome radio transcription , in decent sonics , is led by Lorin Maazel , not today ' s fussbudget , but the vital , 25-years-younger conductor who could be relied_upon to seek_out and project the subtleties and dramatic potential of the most elusive scores , among which &quot; Pelleas et Melisande &quot; surely ranks high . The pacing is a good_deal slower than Fournet ' s and more traditionally &quot; impressionist &quot; in its moving about rather than zeroing_in on a phrase . But in its discursive way Maazel ' s interpretation is no less convincing than the Frenchman ' s . The Rome Radio Orchestra may_not be one ' s dream ensemble for this music , but the players -- notably the solo winds -- are consistently responsive to Maazel ' s hardly simple demands . Again , the cast is uniformly strong , with the sweet-voiced Henry Guy and the girlish-sounding Jeannette Pilou as the doomed titular couple . Gabriel Bacquier ' s towering Golaud is perhaps the most sympathetic and pitiable on recordings , and vocally at least a match for Roux ' s , while Nicola Zaccaria brings basso cantante warmth of tone and a wonderful feeling of_aged wisdom to his Arkel . The set , on three full-priced CDs , is uneconomical . There are no notes and the libretto is in French only , whereas the inexpensive Philips reissue gives us all_the printed material we could require . But these are two sides of a coin of inestimable value . It ' s difficult to imagine being without either .</TEXT>
