   <TEXT> MOVIES Director ' s Take : American filmmaker Oliver Stone , talking to 600 media representatives in Cairo , defended his use of violence in &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; and said that it ' s American news broadcasters who are guilty of excesses . &quot; Money is at the root of the TV networks , &quot; said Stone at the 18th Cairo International Film Festival . &quot; And their news is dictated by money and competition . To get the highest ratings , news must be presented in the most sensational way possible. &quot; Stone said he was referring not only to coverage of celebrated crimes , but also to basic news coverage . &quot; The invasion of Haiti was presented like a miniseries , &quot; Stone said . &quot; It was promoted around the clock_in order to incite a kind of Pavlovian reaction wherein people get excited about the potential of a violent showdown between U.S. troops and Haitian forces. &quot; The Oscar-winning director suggested that it would be better to make TV news nonprofit &quot; so that news can be presented in a sober , dignified fashion. &quot; As for &quot; Natural Born Killers , &quot; which got its first screenings in the Arab world at the festival this weekend , Stone said his intention was to hold &quot; a very harsh mirror to a very troubled society that is riddled with violence. &quot; Cinema in Havana : Mexican films were the surprise big winners at the close of Havana ' s annual Latin_American film festival Sunday , the first time in the 16-year history of the festival that one country had captured the three top awards .
