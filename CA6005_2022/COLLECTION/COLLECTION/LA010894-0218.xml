   <HEADLINE> O.C. TO GET_BACK FUNDS , CONTROL UNDER PROPOSAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the first time in three years , the release of the state budget proposal did not produce an immediate cry of fiscal distress from Orange County leaders . Rather , an unusual atmosphere of encouragement greeted the release Friday of Gov . Pete Wilson ' s plan to give local_governments more authority and money to manage critical services . At the root of this optimism is a budget plan that would actually transfer $ 1.1 billion in local property_taxes back to the counties , a stark reversal in policy and fortunes from previous years . The state would also pick_up a larger share of funding for trial_courts , about $ 387 million more statewide , under Wilson ' s plan . In return for the promise of more financial_support , the governor is asking local_governments to take_on more responsibility in managing an array of social_service programs , from welfare to child foster care . &quot; Just the fact that the state is not proposing a tax shift from the counties is a major victory , &quot; County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said Friday after returning from a late-night briefing at the governor ' s office . &quot; I can ' t predict what the Legislature is going_to do , but the governor is out of the gate with us . The practice of balancing the budget on the backs of the counties can ' t go_on . There just isn ' t any ( money ) left. &quot; Praise for the governor ' s plan was more mixed among local educators and students . Although Wilson has promised to give public_schools enough money to keep pace with enrollments , a proposal to increase student fees at community_colleges and state universities was not winning many plaudits . &quot; The fees have more_than doubled since I started back to college as a returning student two years ago , &quot; said Jan Clutter , a 51-year-old single mother and Orange Coast College_student . &quot; The increase in the fees twice in the last two years has made financial_aid even more crucial . If ( Wilson is ) intent_on increasing the fees , he ' s got_to find some way to increase grants , scholarships and financial aid. &quot; Added Jerry Keating , spokesman for Cal State Fullerton : &quot; About all we can say at the moment is the budget clearly portends another lean year for the university and yet another round of student fee increases . &quot; However , given the slowness of the recovery of California ' s economy , we are thankful for what the governor has proposed. &quot; But local_government leaders were expressing the most relief . Orange County Board of Supervisors Chairman Harriett M . Wieder noted that Wilson ' s promises for counties and cities fall_in an election year when the governor will be looking_for support from all quarters . &quot; I think the timing is great , &quot; Wieder said . &quot; People don ' t like the status_quo . People don ' t like the way government runs right now . I ' m glad the governor is moving to give us more responsibility for program management , but they have to give us the money too. &quot; The Wilson plan is based on a general restructuring of how basic services are delivered . For counties , the state is proposing that local_governments assume more management and operational responsibility for indigent health_care , mental_health services , alcohol and drug programs , in-home support services and child foster care . A key to that offer , however , is the governor ' s promise to provide $ 2.8 billion to counties to fund those new responsibilities . About $ 350 million of that total would pay_for local job retraining programs . Another $ 741 million would be distributed to local_governments to pay_for costs associated with the remaining social_service programs . Officials said Friday that it was too early to know how much of the funding would flow directly to Orange County . &quot; For the first time , it looks_like we ' re not going_to have to bail_out the state , &quot; Schneider said . &quot; All in all , the news is pretty favorable. &quot; But the scenario painted by Wilson ' s budget depends_on the state receiving federal grants to fund those social_services and a Legislature sympathetic to years of budget hardship in counties and cities . Friday , members of the Orange County state legislative delegation quickly pledged their support for Wilson ' s plan . &quot; The opportunity is there and the challenge is_on the Legislature to make this a reality , &quot; state Sen . Marian Bergeson ( R-Newport Beach ) told supervisors at a briefing Friday . &quot; It is a bold plan that has tremendous merit in giving more authority to local_governments . It ' s probably the most dramatic change in government structure since I ' ve been in the Legislature. &quot; Bergeson said the increased authority should give counties added incentive to see that the programs run efficiently and within the budgets allocated for their administration and operation . Bergeson acknowledged , however , that much of the proposal hinges_on the federal_government ' s decision to keep millions of dollars flowing to California to fund needed programs and to compensate for the influx of new immigrants . Last year , California received just $ 324 million of the $ 1.45 billion Wilson requested from the federal_government for the cost of educating the 400 # 000 illegal immigrants he says are in the public_schools , providing emergency medical_care to the undocumented population and imprisoning illegal immigrants convicted of felonies here . &quot; We must have a close relationship with the federal_government , &quot; Bergeson said . &quot; This is one of the few budgets I can get excited about . The opportunity is there. &quot; Assemblyman Curt Pringle ( R-Garden Grove ) said he would also work to ensure that counties get the authority and money promised by the governor . &quot; A lot of opportunity is in giving you more flexibility in administering these programs , &quot; Pringle told supervisors . On local college and university campuses , however , endorsements for the budget plan were harder to find . While the governor has promised to pump millions of dollars more into the state ' s community_colleges and two university systems , much of that cost is expected to be passed onto students in the form of increased fees . For the University of California system , the governor ' s budget promises a 3.2 % increase , the first_state funding increase for the system in four years . But later this month , the UC Board of Regents is expected to consider a proposed $ 620 general student fee increase per year . At the California State University system , student fees next year are expected to go_up by about $ 300 per year . &quot; The 3.2 % increase represents the best possible outcome given the state ' s fiscal situation , &quot; said L . Dennis Smith , UC Irvine ' s executive vice_chancellor . &quot; I don ' t know that the governor could have done any better for us at this time . &quot; There are lots of other demands for state funds , &quot; he said . &quot; I think this is a ray of hope. &quot; Of the proposed student fee increase , Smith said students would be paying &quot; about one-third of the cost of their education , with the state paying over 6 % of the cost. &quot; Community_college students are also certain to help finance a 3.4 % increase in funding from the state , officials said . Coast Community_College District Chancellor William Vega said he was concerned that the state has placed too_much emphasis on building prisons , at the expense of education . &quot; If we don ' t educate our Californians so they are capable of leading productive lives , we will only increase the number of homeless and criminals , &quot; Vega said .</TEXT>
