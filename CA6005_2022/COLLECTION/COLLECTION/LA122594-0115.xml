   <HEADLINE> MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI : HOW TO CLAIM EX-SPOUSE ' S BENEFITS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Q : I am 77 and was divorced in 1979 after 40 years of marriage . How do I go_about applying for benefits on my ex-husband ' s account ? - D.R.F . * A : A divorced person is entitled to receive Social_Security benefits accumulated by his or her ex-spouse if they had been married at least 10 years and the ex-spouse is already receiving benefits . ( If that spouse is not yet receiving benefits , the couple must have been divorced for at least two years and the working spouse must be at least 62. ) If your ex-spouse is alive , you may start collecting benefits at 62 , but the benefits will be just 37.5 % of the wage_earner ' s benefits . If you wait until age 65 to begin collecting , the payment is 50 % of the wage_earner ' s benefits . If your former spouse is dead , you may start collecting at age 60 , but your benefits will be just 71.5 % of what the wage_earner would have been entitled to receive . If you wait until age 65 , you can receive 100 % of what your ex-spouse would have received . If you are disabled , you may start collecting benefits at age 50 if your former spouse is dead . If your former spouse is still alive and you are disabled , 62 is the minimum age at which you may begin claiming benefits . You may apply for benefits by mail , telephone or in_person at your local Social_Security_Administration office . To apply by phone , call the nationwide Social_Security_number : ( 800 ) 772-1213 . No matter what method of application you choose , be sure to ask_for assistance in applying for &quot; divorced spouse benefits. &quot; Also , be prepared to present a marriage certificate , divorce decree , proof of_age , proof of death of the former spouse ( if applicable ) and both your Social_Security_number and that of your ex-spouse . For more information about ex-spouse benefits , order the Social_Security_Administration ' s pamphlet No . 05-10084 , &quot; Survivor ' s Benefits &quot; by calling ( 800 ) 772-1213 . New Yield Schedules for Savings Bonds Q : I purchased some EE Savings Bonds in February , 1993 . The following month , the government lowered the guaranteed interest_rate paid on bonds held a minimum of five years , from 6 % to 4 % . Once I have held my bonds for five years , what is the guaranteed rate I am entitled to receive ? -- J.F.R . * A : You are entitled to receive the 6 % guaranteed minimum rate because that was the rate in_effect at the time you purchased your bonds . Bonds purchased before March 1 , 1993 , and held at least five years earn at least 6 % ; bonds purchased after that date and held at least five years earn a guaranteed minimum of 4 % . You should also know that bonds held at least five years can yield more_than the guaranteed level ; they pay either the guaranteed minimum or 85 % of the average rate paid by Treasury_notes with five years left to maturity , whichever is higher . Interest Deductible Only on Recorded Lien Q : My father and I own the house where I live . He recently paid_off the mortgage and I now owe him half that amount . I expect to repay him next year when the house is sold . Meanwhile , I am paying him $ 530 a month , the agreed-upon interest on my outstanding loan balance . May I deduct this interest from income on my tax_returns ? -- N.K . * A : Your ability to deduct your payment to your father depends entirely on two key factors : how the note is secured and whether it was officially recorded . For the interest on your debt to be deductible , your note must be secured by your interest in the house . In other words , you must have signed a trust_deed . Further , that deed must have been recorded in your county recorder ' s office . If these two conditions are not met , the government does not consider the interest you are paying to be true mortgage interest , which is deductible , but merely personal or consumer debt interest , which is not deductible . Ordinary Income_Tax Due on IRA Yields Q : I am 68 . One of my individual_retirement_accounts contains $ 10 # 000 that is invested in a limited liability company investing in oil . Do I have to reinvest any of the money generated by that account back into the IRA , or may I spend it as I wish and pay taxes on it ? -- T.E . * A : Taxpayers older than 59 1 / 2 are entitled to make withdrawals from their IRAs without owing the 10 % federal_government penalty or the 2.5 % California penalty . The only proviso is that they pay ordinary income_taxes on any withdrawals . Since you are over the minimum age , you may spend the dividends generated by the oil investment and pay Uncle_Sam whatever ordinary income_tax you owe on the proceeds . Bank Has Own Rules on CD Withdrawals Q : My wife and I are both over 65 . We invested an IRA in a bank certificate_of_deposit . The bank says we can withdraw any interest the CD generates , but it will charge us a penalty if we withdraw any part of the principal before the maturity_date . I thought an IRA could be freely disbursed once the holder turned 59 1 / 2 . Am I correct ? -- J.R.C . * A : You have confused your penalties . Taxpayers older than 59 1 / 2 are not subject_to government early-withdrawal penalties , but they are still subject_to penalties imposed by banks and other investment programs . The penalty you were told about is imposed by the bank to discourage savers from withdrawing funds from term certificate_of_deposit accounts ; it has nothing to do with your age or the government . * Carla Lazzareschi cannot answer mail individually but will respond in this column to financial questions of general interest .
