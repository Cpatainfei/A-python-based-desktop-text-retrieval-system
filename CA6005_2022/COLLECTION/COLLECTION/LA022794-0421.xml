   <TEXT> In &quot; Putting the Official Stamp on Middle_East Border Crossings &quot; ( Feb . 13 ) , Christopher Reynolds recommends that prospective travelers to Israel and Syria , Jordan , Saudi_Arabia or one of several smaller Gulf states pursue one of three options to sidestep Arab countries ' unilateral boycott of travelers whose passports bear an Israeli stamp : Ask Israeli immigration officers to stamp a separate piece_of_paper ; get a temporary second U.S. passport , or make Israel the final stop on your itinerary . I would rather propose three substitute options more consistent with fundamental American values : Visit Israel and skip your trip to any of these Arab nations ; inform the local consulate of any Arab nation that you will visit as soon as their government lifts its unilateral travel and economic boycott of Israel , and inform the consulate that as an American who values freedom , you do not appreciate arbitrary and unsupportable restrictions upon your travel based on hatred of any people , race , ethnic_group or nation .
