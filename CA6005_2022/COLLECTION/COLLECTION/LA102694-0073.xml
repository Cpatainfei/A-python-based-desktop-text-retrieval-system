   <HEADLINE> DOES A KID NEED A DAD ; ANGUISHED PARENTS LOOK TO THE EXPERTS FOR ANSWERS . BUT STUDIES SHOW ONLY THAT THE DEBATE WILL CONTINUE TO RAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ilona Sherman was 43 and divorced when she set_about having a child on_her_own . &quot; Marriage did not answer my needs . But I wanted to have a child . I was getting older . I wasn ' t going_to wait to meet someone to do it. &quot; She opted for artificial_insemination and gave_birth to a son , Adam Robert , 16 months ago . &quot; I think a father is very important , and I would like to get_married at some point . But I ' m a big believer that if you give a child enough attention and love , that ' s what is important , &quot; says Sherman , who owns a public relations firm in Los Angeles . Henry Biller , however , takes_issue with mom-alone types like Sherman . &quot; There are lots of ( women ) who say that fathers are the disposable parent , &quot; says Biller , a psychologist and well-known researcher on fatherhood at the University of Rhode Island . &quot; They say , ' Just give us enough money and we ' ll put the child in a good school. ' I don ' t agree with that . I think you are putting kids at risk without a regular , quality , consistent relationship with a man. &quot; But , he notes , with a hint of resignation : &quot; Despite mounting evidence for the importance of the father-child connection , many people still believe that Dad just provides a little extra and that kids get what they really need from Mom. &quot; Indeed , if you look_at childbirth in 1994 in the United States , you might conclude that , after the sperm , the presence of a father is optional . Births to unwed mothers have jumped a shocking 70 % since 1982 , according to the 1993 census , with 27 % of children under 18 living with a single parent who had never married . And when divorce or death is figured in , about 55 % of children will spend some portion of their lives in a single-parent household , almost always headed by the mother . Clearly , fatherlessness is a social trend to be reckoned with , experts note , especially with so many public policy issues -- from welfare reform to child custody judgments -- being hashed out with a closer look_at what the father contributes to the nuclear_family . Notwithstanding Dan Quayle ' s point_of_view , society needs to know : Does a kid need a dad ? * Single , divorced or widowed mothers tend to cling_to the view that a child ' s overall environment matters more_than the presence of a father -- and research backs them up , to some extent . Barbara Gale was a toddler when her parents divorced , and her father faded_out of her life . So at age 42 and single , she thought long and hard about her desire to raise a child on_her_own . But she is confident about her decision . She did fine without a father , Gale reasoned , so would her daughter , Gabriella , who was adopted at birth in June , 1993 . Gale , who has her own entertainment company in Los Angeles , is irritated by the frequent theme of politicians who point to single-parent families -- which are headed by mothers 86 % of the time -- as the root of many social problems . &quot; Have them come_to my house , &quot; she scoffs . &quot; I don ' t think my child will lack for anything -- emotionally or otherwise. &quot; Other mothers point_out that even with the potential drawbacks , life without father is sometimes better than with him . Bonnie Owens walked_out_of her home 22 years ago with her toddler , a suitcase and $ 32 in her pocket . She wasn ' t concerned about leaving her baby ' s father behind . &quot; I thought her being with me and not with a father was more emotionally healthy than being in a two-parent household where there was discontent and a lack of respect , &quot; says Owens , a Los Angeles talent_agent . &quot; But I had a really great support_system . My point_of_view is that a child will be well-adjusted if they have a good environment . And a good environment doesn ' t have to be a mother and father. &quot; Zulma Garcia , 16 , tried living with the father of her baby for about a year after the child ' s birth . After they broke_up , he stopped seeing the child , who is almost 2 years old . And Garcia is relieved . &quot; I don ' t worry about her not having a father , &quot; says Garcia , who lives_in Los Angeles . &quot; At this point , I think it ' s best to let_it_go because of the kind of person he is . I think I ' m doing the best for her with him not being around . What ' s the use of having a father and a mother in the house if they don ' t get_along and there is always mental and verbal abuse ? That doesn ' t mean this child will grow_up very healthy. &quot; Research is not clear on whether a stable , secure , loving environment can fully compensate for the lack of a father . But some recent studies indicate that if a mother has other , supportive adults to lean_on , the child fares well . &quot; It ' s beneficial for children to live with two adults , but they don ' t necessarily have to be two parents and they don ' t necessarily have to be people of the opposite sex , &quot; says Helen Wintrob , an assistant_professor of psychiatry at the State University of New York , who has studied father absence . She is a single mother of an adopted child . Studies of families headed by homosexual couples , moreover , have found few negative effects on the children . &quot; There is no evidence of adverse effects on kids raised by two women , &quot; says Ross Parke , director of the Center for Family Studies at the University of California , Riverside . &quot; That raises the issue that constantly occurs in this field : Is it the effects of the father per se or the effects of having an additional person around to be supportive ? There is some evidence that fathers are important . But there is still a question of what unique roles they play. &quot; * Because fathers have long been viewed solely as breadwinners , little research has been done to pinpoint their emotional , spiritual , moral and intellectual contributions to their children . But that doesn ' t mean that fathers don ' t greatly influence a child ' s development , say a growing legion of social_scientists studying fatherhood . Research has shown that while a child may_not become a felon or societal outcast simply because he or she is fatherless , there is a distinct &quot; two-parent advantage , &quot; says Biller , the University of Rhode Island psychologist . For example , children with fathers tend to get_along better with their peers and display more social confidence . They face new situations better , adapt to change more easily , and score higher on intelligence and aptitude tests . They are typically more independent and responsible . &quot; A man and woman raising a child together will present a child with a broad range of experiences , &quot; Biller says . &quot; They treat children differently , and by doing so , provide them with different ways of approaching life. &quot; The fatherless child lacks something in a purely emotional sense , too , argues Dr. Martin Greenberg , a San Diego psychiatrist and the author of several books on fatherhood . &quot; There is an absence of images , thoughts and stories related to fathers , &quot; he says . &quot; There is an absence of a role_model , but worse than that is the absence of a spiritual structure ; an image based on feelings and memories. &quot; Since mother-only families often translate to economic hardship , too many Americans think_of fatherlessness only in terms of the dollars lost , Greenberg says . But you can ' t put a price on a father . &quot; There is still very little recognition of the importance of a father , &quot; he says . &quot; There is a tendency to see the father as the bringer of money . There is not a sense of how a father provides spiritual meaning and values. &quot; Fathers who participate fully in child-rearing enrich their children ' s lives immeasurably , Biller says . Independence , assertiveness , attitudes about femininity and masculinity , and choice of occupation are all areas in which fathers tend to be more influential , studies show . &quot; ( Fatherless children ) are less likely to actualize their potential , &quot; he says . &quot; They are more likely to succumb to peer pressure and less likely to take_on responsibility . But they may_not have severe problems ; some studies have not found big differences . The problem in these studies , very often , is that you are not defining what you mean. &quot; For example , Biller and others point_out , studies of fatherless children may_not consider whether the child has one or more &quot; father figures &quot; or supportive adults in their lives . &quot; Obviously , many people who were deprived of their fathers grow_up to be normal , healthy adults who lead normal , healthy lives and are more_than adequate husbands and wives , mothers and fathers , &quot; notes Biller in his book &quot; The Father Factor : What You Need to Know to Make a Difference &quot; ( Pocket Books , 1994 ) . &quot; They may have benefited from having the kind of mother who could cope_with the challenges of single parenthood . Or they may have had older brothers , uncles , stepfathers , or male teachers who filled_in the gaps in their lives . &quot; Many of the disastrous results predicted for children who grow_up without fathers are based on studies of the most extreme cases of father absence , abuse or neglect. &quot; * Despite the strong feelings on both sides , the bulk of the research provides no clear answer on whether a child needs a father . Much of the research on fatherlessness has focused_on children whose parents divorced or whose fathers died , showing that the circumstances surrounding fatherlessness matter greatly . that ' s why the question , &quot; Will a child suffer from not having a father ? &quot; is so very difficult to resolve , Parke says . &quot; People aren ' t sure if the effects on a child are from the lack of a father or the conditions surrounding it . It ' s tricky. &quot; What seems to matter is economic security , the presence of an extended_family , the security of a neighborhood , the child ' s gender and whether the mother has ever been married . For example , children who lose contact with their fathers after a divorce tend to show some problems depending_on their age and gender . &quot; There is a fair bit of consistent evidence on this , &quot; Parke says . &quot; One is that girls seem to do_better than boys . After a couple years , girls , particularly younger_girls , seem to settle_down and do fairly well compared to non-divorce families . The boys , however , do not seem to fare as well . There is more tension between the mothers and boys . Mothers seem less effective at controlling the boy . That tends to translate into not doing as well in school , not getting_along_with peers. &quot; Moreover , a classic study found that fatherless boys often develop &quot; hyper masculinity &quot; to compensate for the loss . &quot; We think it has to do with the fact that a male_child who didn ' t have the advantage of having a father would tend to identify with the mother and her feminine characteristics , &quot; says the study ' s author , Dr. Allan Barclay of the University of Missouri , St . Louis . &quot; In order to adjust to the masculine role , they had to adopt a more high-powered masculinity. &quot; Other research has revealed that problems for girls may occur later in life . &quot; Although a lot of girls who grow_up fatherless seem to develop without problems , so many of them run_into difficulties later in life because they now are having to deal more with men , &quot; Biller says . Research on children born to unwed mothers paints another , generalized picture of children handicapped to some degree . &quot; These kids generally don ' t do very well , &quot; Parke says . &quot; For boys , there tends to be behavioral problems . But again , it ' s not clear if that is just father-absence . It could be the mothers ' lack of education or poverty. &quot; The bottom_line in all_of the research , Biller says , is that &quot; we have to preface things in individual differences . There are always exceptions . To make a statement that every child will be affected in a particular way is impossible . We can only talk_about probabilities. &quot;</TEXT>
