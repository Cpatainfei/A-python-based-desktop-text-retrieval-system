   <HEADLINE> CHALLENGES MEAN NO HONEYMOON FOR ZEDILLO ; MEXICO : ON FIRST DAY IN OFFICE , THE NEW PRESIDENT FACES NEWSPAPER PROTEST , CHIAPAS TENSIONS , CRIME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As President Ernesto Zedillo settled into Day One of his six-year term Friday , an open_letter appeared in an influential newspaper demanding the immediate dismissal of the man Zedillo had just appointed mayor of this capital city . Three of the newspaper ' s journalists had been injured , along with dozens of anti-government protesters , when riot police attacked a stone-throwing mob hours after Zedillo ' s inauguration Thursday . The workers union of the daily Jornada said in the letter that it deplores the &quot; contradictory images &quot; of &quot; provocation and repression &quot; at a time when Zedillo is promising a presidency of &quot; tolerance , unity and transparency. &quot; &quot; Less than 24 hours after having taken power , ( Mexico_City ) Mayor Oscar Espinoza Villareal broke the presidential promise of negotiation and tolerance , &quot; the union declared . &quot; Therefore , we demand his immediate dismissal. &quot; The swift condemnation of a police_action that the government justified as self-defense by a riot squad that had endured nearly an hour of stoning illustrated the immediacy , and depth , of the challenges facing Mexico ' s 63rd president . At a time of great expectations and high popularity ratings for Zedillo , there were other examples in the Mexican_capital and countryside . The young criminal lawyer whom Zedillo appointed from the opposition to serve as his attorney_general -- and point_man for the creation of an independent and honest judiciary -- defined one of the new administration ' s biggest challenges . Antonio Lozano declared at his own swearing-in ceremony that the powerful law_enforcement institution he is inheriting &quot; is in a serious credibility crisis , which no one can hide. &quot; In the embattled southern state of Chiapas , tensions continued to mount as a statewide network of indigenous organizations threatened massive civil_disobedience next week if the governor-elect from Zedillo ' s ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party tries to take_office . And in isolated incidents nationwide Friday , it was clear that the violent street crime and narcotics trafficking that Zedillo had denounced as among the greatest threats to Mexico ' s national security appeared to continue unabated . Police in the southern state of Oaxaca reported that unidentified gunmen attacked a religious procession on a pilgrimage , killing three . The motive was unknown . In the western state of Michoacan , 15 family members opened_fire on another family , killing five , in what police said was a feud . And in Chiapas , security_guards for a private rancher battled militant farm_workers who returned with arms after the guards expelled them from the land as squatters . But as new , independent polls showed the new president starting off with the support of nearly 60 % of the Mexican people , he and his Cabinet_ministers also began the hard task of forging solutions that Zedillo , in his inaugural speech , had cautioned will take time . After diplomatic sessions at Los Pinos presidential estate Friday with Latin_American presidents and prime_ministers , Zedillo met with Mexico ' s top bankers and business_leaders . As a study disclosed that just 61 % of all students complete elementary_school , new Education Ministry staff_members began laying the groundwork for plans to fulfill Zedillo ' s promise of full secondary_education for all Mexicans . And Zedillo ' s new secretaries_of_agriculture , land_reform and finance also started looking_for ways to , as Zedillo phrased it , &quot; break the vicious_circle of ignorance , unemployment and poverty in which many Mexicans are trapped. &quot;</TEXT>
