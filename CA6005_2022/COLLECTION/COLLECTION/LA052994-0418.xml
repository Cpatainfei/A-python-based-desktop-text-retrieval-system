   <HEADLINE> SPECIAL REPORT / ELECTION PREVIEW ; DECISION ' 94 / A VOTER ' S GUIDE TO STATE AND LOCAL ELECTIONS ; PROPOSITIONS ; PROP . 178</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What it is : Like Proposition 177 , this measure would grant an exemption from the taxes on new construction added_on to existing property . In this case , the exemption would be allowed on installation of water-saving equipment used in agriculture -- adding_to property value by replacing a sprinkler irrigation system with a more expensive drip system.Analysts estimate that the exemption could save farmers and ranchers $ 7 to $ 10 per acre . * Arguments for : Tax savings available under Proposition 178 would encourage the installation of equipment requiring less water for crops and thus help conserve water . Particularly in a state subject_to drought , it is unfair and counterproductive to extract a higher tax_based on improvements to property that cut_back on water consumption . * Arguments against : Tax losses from this measure would leave a hole in revenues needed for local_governments to fund critical services and for schools . Farmers who install water-saving devices will automatically enjoy a reduction in their costs , in the form of reduced water bills . They don ' t need a tax_break to boot . * Who supports it : Sen . Mike Thompson ( D-St . Helena ) ; heads of the California Farm Bureau Federation , the Planning and Conservation League and the Assn . of California Water Agencies . * Who opposes it : Assemblyman Gil Ferguson ( R-Newport Beach ) ; Assemblywoman Debra Bowen ( D-Marina del Rey ) .</TEXT>
