   <HEADLINE> WARTIME KING HONORED FOR SAVING 50 # 000 BULGARIAN JEWS ; HOLOCAUST : ORANGE COUNTY RABBI SAYS HE WAS ONE OF THOSE KING BORIS III OF BULGARIA REFUSED TO HAND_OVER TO HIS ALLY , ADOLF HITLER . THE KING ' S SON , SIMEON II , ACCEPTS THANKS FROM SURVIVORS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A rabbi who was among 50 # 000 Bulgarian Jews saved from the Nazis by the late king of Bulgaria read thankful passages of Scripture here Sunday in the presence of his rescuer ' s son and heir . Nearly 2 # 500 worshipers at the Crystal Cathedral heard Rabbi Haim Asa declare , &quot; God has blessed us with salvation. &quot; And to the deeply moved King Simeon II , son of the late King Boris III , Asa said , &quot; We thank_you for the gift of life that your father gave my people. &quot; Asa , the spiritual_leader of Fullerton ' s Temple Beth Tikvah , fled from wartime Europe with his family , one among the estimated 50 # 000 -- virtually the country ' s entire Jewish population -- saved from almost certain death at the hands of the Nazis by the courageous actions of King Boris . This weekend , the rabbi and other grateful former subjects are honoring the late king . The festivities included Friday dinner at Sephardic Tifereth Israel Temple in Los Angeles , Sunday ' s &quot; Hour of Power &quot; internationally televised show , and a tour set for today at the Simon Wiesenthal Center Museum of Tolerance in the company of Branko Lustig , the Academy Award-winning producer of &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; and a Holocaust survivor . In a ceremony tonight in Beverly Hills , King Boris will be posthumously awarded the Jewish National Fund ' s Medal of the Legion of Honor , the first non-Jew to receive one of the Jewish community ' s highest honors . King Simeon , who seemed near tears during Sunday ' s service , said he is deeply moved by the recognition of his father ' s efforts . &quot; For a son to see such genuine and good-hearted recognition is gratifying , &quot; he said in an interview , &quot; but what my father did was only what any decent person would have done. &quot; In 1943 , King Boris -- whose country was officially aligned with Germany -- refused Hitler ' s direct orders to deport Bulgaria ' s Jews to Germany for extermination . Instead the king urged the Jews to move to the countryside and blend_in with the general population . And he told the Fuehrer that he needed them to help build roads . On Aug . 14 , 1943 , Boris was summoned by Hitler to Germany , where the two had a meeting described by eyewitnesses as a tense and angry showdown over the Jewish matter and his refusal to send Bulgarian troops for the Russian front . Two weeks later , the 49-year-old king died under mysterious circumstances ; some believe he was poisoned on Hitler ' s orders . Six years old at the time , the new King Simeon II was deposed by the Communists after the war . He has lived_in exile in Spain ever since . Asa ' s efforts to gain recognition for King Boris began 32 years ago when he wrote his master ' s thesis on the subject . In his crusade , the rabbi says he kept running_into two obstacles : Bulgaria ' s Communist regime ' s reluctance to glorify the monarch it had deposed , and certain elements of the American Jewish community , which were unwilling to admit or unaware that an ally of Germany could have saved so many . That resistance eroded , the rabbi said , after two recent events : the end of Bulgaria ' s Communist regime in 1990 , and the success of &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; a film about a German who rescued Jews under the Nazis ' noses . &quot; When you find a man who saved 50 # 000 Jews , how can you not honor him ? &quot; said David Horne , Los Angeles chairman for the Jewish National Fund . &quot; It ' s critical for people to know that someone who was the head of a state did something so important. &quot; Jack Mandel , president of the American Congress of Jewish Concentration_Camp Survivors , based in Los Angeles , agrees . &quot; He should have been recognized a long_time ago , &quot; Mandel said of King Boris . Unfortunately , he added , human nature &quot; is never to find somebody who saved , but only to persecute the ones who did wrong. &quot; For Asa , &quot; this is important because history has to be made an instrument of good , not only evil . History must teach that there was as much good in certain places as there was evil in others. &quot;</TEXT>
