   <HEADLINE> TAX ON BATTERIES WOULD SNARL ELECTRIC_CAR PLANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I read with interest Robert A . Rosenblatt ' s Feb . 2 article ( &quot; New Juice for Electric_Cars &quot; ) regarding the vote by eastern states to endorse in principal the stringent California-style vehicle-emissions rules that are supported by environmentalists nationwide . The irony is that these same environmentalists are supporting a tax on lead-acid batteries -- the very energy source that will power no-emission electric vehicles . Lead-acid batteries are increasingly viewed_as the most viable power source for electric vehicles because they are the most readily available , safe and reliable battery technology . The bill , which calls_for a 45-cents-per-pound tax on lead , would increase the cost of batteries for electric vehicles significantly . If passed , the tax will price electric vehicle technology out of the range of virtually all Americans . Equally ironic is the fact that recycling remains the environmental community ' s battle_cry , yet lead-acid batteries are the most recycled commodity in the United States , at more_than 90 % annually . Tough rules are only one key element in improving our environment . Feasibility and fairness should be two others .
