   <HEADLINE> WHO KNOWS WHAT SLEEPER LURKS . . . ? ; MOVIES : THE FUN IN THESE SHADOWY HITS IS IN THE SURPRISE . THEY ARE USUALLY MODERATELY BUDGETED FILMS THAT OPEN SMALL AND THEN BENEFIT BY GOOD_WORD OF MOUTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A few months ago , the special-effects-laden action-comedy &quot; The Mask &quot; might have been considered a bona_fide summer sleeper . But now the New Line Cinema film_starring a green-faced Jim Carrey has developed such buzz in Hollywood that it is projected to be one of the summer ' s hits . &quot; Speed , &quot; starring Keanu Reeves as a SWAT cop trying to save a careening busload of passengers , also might have been considered a summer sleeper earlier this year . Now advance screenings have created positive word_of_mouth for the 20th Century Fox film , leaving some to question whether the term &quot; sleeper &quot; applies anymore . The real fun in Hollywood these days is predicting what movies without big expectations will become box-office hits , along the lines of last summer ' s surprise hits , &quot; Free Willy &quot; and &quot; Sleepless in Seattle. &quot; If you listen to the studio publicity departments , you might believe anything other_than their biggest summer films are potential sleepers . Two baseball movies are now being hyped as summer sleepers : &quot; Angels in the Outfield &quot; with Danny Glover from Walt Disney / Caravan and &quot; Little Big League &quot; with Jason Robards from Columbia . Another touted sleeper is &quot; The Shadow , &quot; a Universal film about the caped crime-fighter of radio lore , starring Alec Baldwin ( &quot; Who knows what evil lurks in the hearts of men ? The Shadow knows &quot; ) . But there are those who argue that all this talk_about summer sleepers is often designed by studios to start an undercurrent of hype for certain films . &quot; They want you to believe that we made_it for $ 80 million , but it ' s a sleeper , &quot; said entertainment attorney David Colden , adding sarcastically : &quot; Yeah . . . &quot; John Krier , president of Exhibitor Relations Inc. , a motion_picture research company , is another who believes that when you look_across the landscape of films this summer , most really don ' t qualify as sleeper candidates . How can &quot; Angels in the Outfield &quot; be considered a sleeper , Krier asked , when &quot; exhibitors are expecting big things from it ? &quot; And he doesn ' t see how anyone can still say that &quot; Speed &quot; is a summer sleeper , no matter what Fox executives might say . &quot; A sleeper is something that is unheralded and then pops_up all_of a sudden , &quot; Krier said . It has a low to moderate budget , no big stars , usually opens small , but benefits from good_word of mouth and has &quot; legs , &quot; is either critically praised or trashed , has no heavy advance promotion by the studio , does more at the box_office than is initially expected , and is usually not given the most_advantageous playing time . Some current examples , Krier said , would be &quot; Ace Ventura : Pet Detective , &quot; which came_out of nowhere with comedian Carrey earlier this year to gross $ 70 million , and &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral , &quot; which has grossed $ 34 million . &quot; The Mask &quot; was a sleeper , he said , until exhibitors viewed the trailer at the ShoWest exhibitors ' convention in Las Vegas earlier this year and loved it . Now , it would be a shock if it didn ' t succeed . A film does not necessarily have to be devoid_of stars to be considered a sleeper . Take &quot; Sleepless in Seattle , &quot; which last year grossed $ 126 million for TriStar Pictures . &quot; It was a movie which had a fairly well-known cast with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan and , given its cost and the subject_matter , would normally be expected to do about $ 20- $ 40 million at the box_office , &quot; said one source . Some recent examples of sleepers , Krier said , include : &quot; Cool Runnings &quot; ( $ 68 million ) , &quot; Sister Act , &quot; ( $ 139 million ) , &quot; The Crying Game &quot; ( $ 62 million ) , and &quot; My Girl &quot; ( $ 58 million ) . So , what are the real potential sleepers this summer ? If &quot; Andre &quot; -- a film about a 9-year-old girl and a lovable seal -- makes a big splash at the box_office for Paramount Pictures , it would be a bona_fide sleeper , just as the killer-whale movie &quot; Free Willy &quot; was for Warners when it grossed $ 77 million . They might also include &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; the Quentin Tarantino paean to criminals starring John Travolta and Uma Thurman , which on Monday won the Golden Palm award at Cannes ; the super-hero adventure comedy &quot; Blankman &quot; starring Damon Wayans ; and , &quot; Airheads , &quot; a tale of an unknown band that takes a radio_station hostage to get some airplay . Or perhaps &quot; Fear of a Black Hat , &quot; a comedy rap version of &quot; This Is Spinal_Tap &quot; from the Samuel Goldwyn Co . will be the real summer sleeper . Or maybe it will be an Andrew Bergman movie from Castle Rock called &quot; It Could Happen to You &quot; ( Nicolas Cage , Bridget Fonda ) .</TEXT>
