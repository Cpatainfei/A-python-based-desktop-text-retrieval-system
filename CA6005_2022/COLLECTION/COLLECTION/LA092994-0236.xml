   <HEADLINE> CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN ; IN CONTRAST TO SOMALIA , WHITE_HOUSE IS LETTING MILITARY CALL SHOTS IN HAITI ; OCCUPATION : OFFICIALS SAY ADMINISTRATION ' S APPROACH DOES NOT AFFECT MERELY TOP COMMANDERS . IT MEANS MORE IMPROVISING BY TROOPS ON THE GROUND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton is doing something in Haiti that he did not do during the U.S. intervention in Somalia : He is letting the military be the military . U.S. officials say that in marked contrast to the Somalia venture , Washington is stepping back and leaving the military operation to its generals and admirals . Although that may cause some nervous moments for top Clinton_Administration officials , it has given the military far more latitude than it has had in previous operations not only at the top levels of command but also among squad leaders and sergeants . That , in turn , has meant far more on-the-spot improvisation , both by senior commanders and by soldiers and Marines in the field , concede officials familiar_with the Haiti operation . Last week , for example , after the Port-au-Prince police beat a Haitian civilian to death , it was Army Gen . Hugh Shelton , the U.S. commander in Haiti , rather than Administration officials , who decided to assign U.S. military_police to oversee the Haitian forces . The White_House and the Pentagon ' s civilian leadership essentially went_along . And this week , the military delayed the departure of a contingent of Marines until next month , to avoid giving the appearance that Washington agreed with accusations by the Haitian army chief , Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , that U.S. troops had been committing &quot; atrocities. &quot; Military officials say the broad latitude for the generals stems from several factors : * Unlike the U.S. venture in Somalia , the Haiti operation is entirely American-run , so U.S. commanders have not had to tailor their actions to fit the demands of U.N. officials -- which had been a major constraint in Mogadishu . * Planning for the Haiti venture was meticulous , with major units and their weapons packaged as separate components that could be interchanged and shifted as the situation required , giving field commanders added flexibility . * Many of the U.S. troops now in Haiti -- particularly the Army ' s 10th Mountain Division -- served in Somalia and have experience with such peacekeeping operations . One lesson that the Army learned : Keep ordinary combat troops away from day-to-day policing duties . To be sure , the wider discretion now being afforded to military commanders -- combined with the rapidly changing situation in Haiti -- has led to occasional confusion and a_few inconsistencies in the way U.S. troops respond . During the beating incident last week , for example , while U.S. troops in that part of Haiti were forced to do nothing more_than watch , American soldiers in another part of the island nation , using the same rules of engagement , were permitted to step_in and halt such excesses . Generally speaking , however , the effort has gone fairly well . Typical of the broad autonomy being given U.S. troops is the case of U.S. Army Staff Sgt . Tony Campbell , whose contingent of MPs was assigned to &quot; build a rapport &quot; with the Haitian police in an effort to curb their abuses and turn them into a professional force . Campbell ' s orders were so vague they were almost unmilitary . &quot; I was pretty much told I could do anything I want to improve relations with them , &quot; he recalls . He says his commander told him : &quot; If you guys need to use some ingenuity to bond with these people , just go and do it. &quot; As a result , Campbell threw_away the manual . On Tuesday , it was lunch : The MPs and their Haitian counterparts shared a midday meal prepared by the wife of the Haitian commander . On Wednesday , it was a volleyball_game between Campbell ' s men and the Haitians . And each day since , the 11-year veteran said , he has tried to &quot; share ideas &quot; with the Haitians that truly are foreign to a force accustomed to enforcing the orders of a dictatorship rather than maintaining order in a democracy . &quot; It ' s not to say their approach is wrong and ours is right , &quot; Campbell says , choosing his words carefully . &quot; It ' s just to show that this is the way it is done_in an open society where the police and army are there to serve an elected government. &quot; But the U.S. MPs -- who are assigned to serve as a buffer between the Haitian forces and the people until a U.S.-led multinational U.N. police_force forms here -- do , of course , have their limitations . Officially , they are not an occupation force . They are not authorized to enforce Haitian law or arrest Haitians . And , for now , U.S. commanders have decided not to deploy joint patrols , largely to avoid painting U.S. troops as comparable_to the Haitian policemen . Short of that , Campbell and others at the front_line of the Haiti operation said they were specifically urged to improvise . &quot; I ' ve never done . . . or seen anything like this before , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s going_to be very interesting to see how it all works out. &quot; The case-by-case approach is expected to undergo even more-stringent tests over the next two weeks , when military planners fear increased looting and violence as the deadline approaches for the transfer of power to exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide . Fineman reported from Port-au-Prince and Pine from Washington .</TEXT>
