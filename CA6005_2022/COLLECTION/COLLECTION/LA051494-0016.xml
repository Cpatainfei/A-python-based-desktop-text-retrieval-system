   <HEADLINE> RECONCILIATION TURNS FATAL ; GARDEN GROVE OFFICER IS HELD IN WIFE ' S SLAYING ; SHE HAD SOUGHT NEW START TO MARRIAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just last week , 21-year-old Simona Tucker moved_back into the Moreno Valley home she shared with her husband , Garden Grove Police_Officer Derrick Tucker , hoping for a fresh_start to their troubled marriage . Five days later -- on her first Mother ' s Day -- the 21-year-old Romanian immigrant was dead , and her 32-year-old husband was later booked into jail on suspicion of her murder . The couple , who were parents of a 9-month-old daughter , had separated several times since their 1991 Las Vegas wedding , and Derrick Tucker was &quot; terrified of losing &quot; his wife , said Simona Tucker ' s mother , Irina Cornea . &quot; He loved her , but he was crazy jealous , &quot; Cornea , who was surrounded by relatives , said Friday from her Anaheim home . The Riverside County Sheriff ' s Department received a frantic 911 call from Derrick Tucker at 1:09 p.m. Sunday . The police_officer told a dispatcher that his wife had been shot in the head with a handgun . &quot; We were both playing with the gun , &quot; he can be heard saying on a tape of the 6 1 / 2-minute call , released by the Sheriff ' s Department on Friday . Tucker told the dispatcher the couple had been &quot; hugging and kissing &quot; before his wife was shot and that she was no longer breathing . He said that they had not been arguing . The couple ' s baby , Rebecca Doris Tucker , was sleeping_in another room and was not injured . Tucker , a patrolman with Garden Grove since 1990 , was taken_in for questioning on Sunday and released pending further investigation , Sheriff ' s Deputy Mark Lohman said . Lohman said Tucker remained a suspect , and that investigators discovered &quot; several discrepancies in his account , &quot; which he would not specify . Tucker turned himself in to authorities Thursday and is being held at the Robert Presley Detention Center in Riverside on suspicion of murder . His bail has been set at $ 250 # 000 . He is_due to be arraigned Friday in Riverside Municipal Court . He has been placed on administrative leave from his job . Simona Tucker ' s death has left her close-knit family , who emigrated from Romania to Orange County six years ago , angry and devastated . &quot; Nobody expected to come_to the United States and have this happen , &quot; said the victim ' s uncle , Mike Palcu . &quot; We expected bad things to happen in Romania when ( dictator Nicolae ) Ceausescu was in power . We came here to escape oppression and to be free. &quot; Simona Tucker was the youngest of four children born to Ioan and Irina Cornea , who are from Medias , a small_town in Transylvania . Family members said she spoke excellent English and often served as a translator for them and other members of the Romanian community . &quot; She was a very good daughter who was very friendly and had good relationships with everyone , &quot; Irina Cornea said . &quot; She ' s an angel now who is in heaven , and I hope that one day we will meet her again. &quot; The family said the couple met in February , 1991 , when Tucker was called to the Garden Grove home of a relative who was having a domestic dispute . Tucker left his telephone_number with Simona , then began aggressively courting her , family members said . The couple were married three weeks after that first meeting , relatives said . &quot; He was very possessive , &quot; said the victim ' s sister-in-law , Corina Cornea , 21 . &quot; He would call her several times a day . He would call her in the middle of the night . He would call her from work. &quot; Family members said Tucker was not physically abusive to his wife , but sometimes punched walls and kept a gun under their bed . They said he also tried to keep her away from her family . Simona Tucker had left her husband at least five times during their marriage , her family said , and had no plans to return after the last separation . But eventually , she did return with their child . &quot; He told her he was going_to make_it work and buy her a house closer to her family , so that ' s what made her go_back to him , &quot; Corina Cornea said . The family said Simona Tucker ' s death was only the beginning of what has been a weeklong nightmare . Family members learned of her death 12 hours after the shooting , when they were contacted by the coroner ' s office . They immediately drove to the Moreno Valley home and spoke with Tucker . &quot; He hugged us and cried , &quot; said 24-year-old Ioan Cornea Jr. , the victim ' s oldest brother . &quot; I asked him why he didn ' t call us , why did we have to be called by the coroner . I told him that I thought he killed my sister. &quot; During the four days that Derrick Tucker remained free , he began planning his wife ' s funeral without their knowledge , the victim ' s relatives said . They feared that he &quot; would have her body cremated and go free , &quot; Ioan Cornea Jr . said . They said they were relieved to learn that Tucker was in jail . The family then began planning Simona ' s funeral , which will be Monday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Cypress . Family members said they have also not seen the couple ' s daughter , who remains with Tucker ' s relatives . They said they plan legal_action to get custody of the girl . Meanwhile , the mood was somber at the Garden Grove Police_Department on Friday . Officials there said they were unable to discuss the case but some expressed their shock . &quot; It ' s all so bewildering , &quot; Officer Richard Morales said . &quot; It would seem to be extremely out of character. &quot; Officials said Tucker had not had any disciplinary problems while at the department . He last worked_on May 7 , the day before the shooting . &quot; He was even-tempered and always willing to perform , &quot; Sgt . Joe Johnson said . &quot; He hadn ' t had any problems internally and was thought of as a very likable young_man . There ' s a lot of disbelief around here . This is definitely a first for this department. &quot;</TEXT>
