   <HEADLINE> U.S. , UKRAINE IN ACCORD TO SHUT CHERNOBYL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Chernobyl nuclear_reactor plant , site of the world ' s worst nuclear accident and still a major source of electric_power , will cease operations under an agreement struck between the United States and Ukraine , U.S. officials announced Saturday . Deputy Energy_Secretary Bill White told reporters that a delegation from the U.S. Department_of_Energy , working with Ukrainian officials over the course of several days , secured a &quot; commitment in principle &quot; to shut_down Chernobyl ' s two remaining nuclear_reactors &quot; at the earliest possible date. &quot; The closure would follow a U.S.-Ukrainian study of options for replacing the lost energy . American officials said that energy conservation and more efficient technologies , including cleaner , coal-burning power-plant designs , could more_than make_up the difference . &quot; This public statement puts Ukraine unalterably on the path to a shutdown , &quot; White said in Washington within an hour of his return from Kiev , Ukraine ' s capital . He called the decision &quot; courageous and creative. &quot; While acknowledging that previous efforts to close the plant had failed , White expressed confidence that the combination of Western technical assistance and Ukraine ' s changing political climate would allow Ukrainian officials to follow_through on the accord . But the two governments left unresolved significant differences over how quickly the Chernobyl plant should be shuttered . White declared flatly that the reactors should halt operations no later than mid-June , when the joint study is expected to be complete . His Ukrainian counterpart , Vice Prime_Minister Valery Shmarov , has argued that the plants could not be decommissioned until alternative sources of energy are secured -- no sooner than 1998 or 1999 . The conflicting timetables suggest that Ukraine , which bargained hard before recently giving_up Soviet-era nuclear_weapons on its soil , may seek more concessions or guarantees from the West before it shuts_down the reactors . The Chernobyl power_station seized the world ' s attention in April , 1986 , when an explosion in one of its four reactors sent clouds of radioactive_dust spreading across Eastern Europe and Scandinavia and much of the former Soviet_Union . Although the death toll at the time was officially put at 32 , Ukrainian authorities have since claimed that up_to 8 # 000 people subsequently died from illnesses brought_on by the explosion and its aftermath . The inoperative reactor involved in the incident remains entombed in a leaky casement of sand and concrete . But two other reactors in the complex -- No . 1 and No . 3 -- continue to generate electricity . Ukraine , seeking reliable sources for additional energy , had planned to repair and recommission the remaining reactor . White said that Washington will provide technical assistance and funds for the shutdown through the World_Bank and the European Development Bank . The Clinton_Administration plans to explore whether a pool of funds earmarked by Congress to help the former Soviet republics retire their nuclear_weapons could be used to help take the Chernobyl plant out of operation . If implemented , the agreement could mark the end of a long and frustrating effort by much of the world community to persuade the Soviet_Union -- and , later , independent Ukraine -- to decommission the reactors , which sit in an eerie , depopulated wasteland north of Kiev . No one except the plant ' s 4 # 500 employees is allowed to travel within roughly 20 miles of the blown-out radioactive core of Reactor No . 4 . Experts said the shutdown would mark the end of operations for a pair of reactors that are among the world ' s most dangerous and unstable . The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency , a U.N. body that monitors the safety and security of nuclear materials worldwide , concluded in late March that &quot; numerous safety deficiencies &quot; remain at the Chernobyl nuclear_power station . It suggested that the entombed reactor involved in the 1986 accident could collapse . Such an event &quot; would have serious consequences , &quot; the IAEA noted . And White predicted that it would create a significant obstacle to the orderly shutdown of the remaining reactors . White told reporters that a visit to the plant provided unsettling indications of the continuing hazard involved in operating the Chernobyl reactors . The average age of plant employees is under 30 , and there have been two full turnovers of personnel there , leaving relatively inexperienced workers to manage any emergency . Hallways were lined with flammable plastic material , and White said he saw one plant operator light a cigarette in a control area . Smoking would be strictly forbidden in such an area within a U.S. nuclear plant . Still , Ukrainians have argued that the reactors must be permitted to continue operations or the country ' s beleaguered economy will founder further . In December , as Ukraine faced a harsh winter and had no hard currency to pay Russia for oil and gas to run its factories , a decision to close the power_station was canceled by the Ukrainian Parliament . While the two operational reactors at Chernobyl supply roughly 7 % of Ukraine ' s electricity needs , the cost of operating them has been an onerous burden for the cash-strapped government . Continuing cleanup efforts and public-health programs designed to treat victims of the disaster consume 12 % of the former Soviet republic ' s annual budget . White said conservation measures in a country that uses energy as inefficiently as Ukraine could be applied easily and quickly . He added that the recent Russian decision to accept barter , rather than hard currency , for its oil and gas would make_it easier for Ukraine to find alternative_energy supplies beyond its border .</TEXT>
