   <HEADLINE> U.S. COURT OKS LAGUNA CANYON TOLLWAY PROJECT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a stunning blow to Laguna Canyon environmental groups , a federal_court Friday cleared the way for construction to resume on the final phase of the 17-mile San Joaquin Hills tollway . A three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco unanimously affirmed a 1993 lower court decision allowing the project to proceed . A coalition of environmental groups had won an injunction from the appeals court in June to stop bulldozers from grading along an environmentally sensitive 4.7-mile section of the road that would cut_through the canyon . Friday ' s decision &quot; means we can start construction on the tollway in that area as soon as we get the ( court ) mandate , &quot; said Lisa Telles , a spokeswoman for the San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency . The ruling , she said , &quot; is fantastic. &quot; Environmentalists , about 30 of whom gathered at the proposed grading site in Laguna Beach to protest the decision , expressed deep disappointment and vowed to keep fighting . &quot; It ' s not over until I ' m physically moved_out of the way , &quot; said Marion Pack , a Riverside County resident who drove an hour to join the other protesters . &quot; We are prepared to block the bulldozers and do whatever it takes_to stop this. &quot; Construction began more_than a year ago at both ends of the tollway , which will run between San Juan Capistrano and Newport Beach . The June injunction halted the work while the two factions argued whether the project ' s environmental studies were adequate . The area includes eight coastal canyons , the county ' s only natural lakes , and habitat for several rare species , including the California coastal gnatcatcher , a bird listed as threatened under the federal Endangered Species Act . The ruling means that grading can resume within 21 days , Telles said . But Joel R . Reynolds , senior attorney for the Natural_Resources Defense Council in Los Angeles and attorney for Laguna Greenbelt Inc. , said the environmental groups may seek a rehearing or other legal remedy . If that happens , he said , grading would not resume for at least 45 days . The appeals judges said that the tollway does not violate the National Environmental Policy Act and that the roadway ' s main builder does not need a supplemental environmental impact report to proceed . Environmentalists had argued unsuccessfully that a supplemental EIR was needed after last year ' s devastating Laguna Beach wildfire , which damaged or destroyed 441 homes or businesses , charred 16 # 682 acres and caused $ 528 million in damage . The protesters who gathered Friday vowed to be relentless in their efforts to halt development in the picturesque canyon . &quot; This means a disaster , &quot; said Robert King of Save Our San Juan , a 550-member group fighting the tollway route through San Juan Capistrano . &quot; It is a roadway that isn ' t needed , that will never pay_for itself and will end_up destroying the unique canyon and unique community of San Juan Capistrano. &quot; Elizabeth Leeds , who co-founded the Laguna Canyon Conservancy , said , &quot; What is lost ? Everything. &quot; But Laguna Beach residents know how to &quot; pop back_up after a major blow , &quot; Leeds said . &quot; The citizens of Laguna Beach in 1990 passed a bond issue for $ 20 million to help leave the canyon in its natural_state by buying the land . They voted against development and the toll road. &quot; The activists , some of whom were arrested for trespassing in September , 1993 , when they chained themselves to heavy earth-moving equipment , said they will monitor the canyon regularly to ensure that no grading is done before all legal means of halting the tollway are exhausted . The opposition of environmentalists has focused_on the 4.7-mile middle section of the road , known as the Laguna Greenbelt . In an injunction issued in September , 1993 , to block construction there , U.S. District Judge Linda McLaughlin described the area as the last significant open space in Orange County . McLaughlin lifted the injunction in June , however , and bulldozing proceeded for a day . But the appeals court immediately imposed a new order that has stopped further work . Lawyer Reynolds said Laguna Greenbelt has a federal lawsuit pending that contends the tollway violates the endangered species law because it could destroy or severely alter the gnatcatcher ' s habitat . A federal judge in Washington has postponed that case until next year while another case involving the gnatcatcher is heard , Reynolds said . &quot; Obviously , we will try and activate our case on an emergency basis , if we need to , to protect the greenbelt. &quot; Reynolds said the tollway route could be altered so that it would be consistent with the area ' s ecology and landscape . That possibility was proposed to the Transportation Corridor Agency , he said , but &quot; it was ignored , and the 9th Circuit Court didn ' t buy_it . Unfortunately , the decision today sends a message to the agency that they can do_it their way. &quot; The ruling stated that an environmental study &quot; need not consider every conceivable alternative , &quot; rejecting environmentalists ' contention that the government had failed to take seriously their proposal to minimize the effect of the road by using bridges and tunnels . One plan offered by the environmentalists would not have left enough space in the middle of the roadway for a proposed rail_line , the court said . The official study examined all feasible alternatives , the court said , including the option of not building a road , in light of the potential effect of traffic congestion on the environment . Although the tollway could encourage population growth , the evidence supports federal_officials ' conclusion that the project would not affect the amount and pattern of growth in the county , the court said . &quot; The county ' s population probably will grow in the coming years &quot; even without the road , the court said , citing population growth of 2.1 million between 1950 and 1989 with little new highway construction . The corridor agency had estimated that it stood to lose $ 5 million in revenue for each month the tollway was not completed as scheduled . It is_due for completion in March , 1997 . Construction delays caused by numerous lawsuits have added $ 8.9 million to the original $ 793-million cost of the project . In addition , the tollway agency has paid more_than $ 2.9 million in court-related legal_fees . Times staff writer Tina Nguyen contributed to this report .</TEXT>
