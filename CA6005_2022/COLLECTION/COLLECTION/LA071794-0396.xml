   <TEXT> The problem facing Brazilian Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira today is not an easy one to solve . His midfield ' s performance is key to the game ' s outcome but his midfield is clearly the team ' s weak_point . Blasted by the Brazilian media for their lack of creativity , the midfielders will have to lift their game to new heights , both offensively and defensively , against an Italian team whose midfield , on paper , is stronger and more attack-minded . Parreira has the edge_in forwards , where Romario and Bebeto will be going_against a makeshift Italian defense , but if Italy wins the midfield battle , the two strikers will be left searching in vain for the ball . The Brazilian defense is sound enough , with Aldair and Marcio Santos having performed better than expected in their fill-in roles at the center once Ricardo Rocha and Ricardo Gomes were injured . Brazil superiority fullbacks in Jorginho and Branco , with another surprise package waiting in the wings in the shape of Cafu . All three like to attack . In goal , Taffarel will have to keep a sharp eye open for the long-range Italian shots , especially from players such_as Dino Baggio and Demetrio Albertini . GRAHAME L . JONES</TEXT>
