   <HEADLINE> EUROPE : FIVE YEARS LATER ; GORBACHEV ' S DAWN : ' FREEDOM OF CHOICE FOR EVERY NATION ' ; LAST SOVIET LEADER IS OUT OF LIMELIGHT NOW . HE RECALLS BEGINNING OF CHANGE IN EASTERN EUROPE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The walls of Mikhail S . Gorbachev ' s office are eerily bare , as though he does not plan to stay there long . On one wall hangs a color photograph of Mt . Fuji , a gift from Japanese environmentalists , and in a corner stands a grandfather_clock presented to Gorbachev , the last leader of the Soviet_Union , by a group of visiting South_Korean legislators a_few weeks ago . His tidy desk has a small lamp with a green shade , a modern version of the green glass lamp that graced the desk of the first Soviet leader , V.I. Lenin . There are no photographs of Gorbachev with other world leaders , no holy relics of the history he helped reshape , no personal memorabilia , no sign that he was the central figure in Europe ' s drama of five years ago . At 63 , he looks fitter than his old rival , Boris N . Yeltsin , full of energy and anxious to end what amounts to an internal political exile in Moscow . Aides say he is an unreformed workaholic whose days routinely end at 2 a.m. In addition to running the Gorbachev Foundation , a combination think_tank and presidential library with about 120 employees , Gorbachev is also president of the Green Cross , the Russian branch of an international environmental group . Recently , he completed a 1 # 000-page , two-volume memoir that will be published in five languages next year . After his fall from power , Gorbachev was allowed to move_back into the dacha in the western suburbs of Moscow that he occupied when he first came_to the city in 1978 as Central Committee secretary for agriculture , aides said . There he takes a long daily walk with his wife , Raisa . She has slowly regained her health , which was damaged during the failed coup of August , 1991 . Relations with Yeltsin remain poor . Gorbachev , who abhorred violence , denounced Yeltsin for resorting_to shelling the Russian Parliament building last year to quash a hard-line revolt . For his part , Yeltsin has stripped Gorbachev of most of his office space , almost all_of his perks , and according to Gorbachev ' s aides , much of his access to the media . Television correspondents tape interviews with the former Soviet leader that mysteriously never air . Aides blame an increasingly tame media for complying with an unofficial ban by the Yeltsin government on giving Gorbachev too_much press . Gorbachev won ' t say whether he will run_for elected office in Russia . But he has called_for the formation of a centrist coalition of social democrats to provide a reformist alternative to Yeltsin . In an interview with Times correspondent Sonni Efron , Gorbachev recalled the events that led to the fall of the Berlin Wall . * Question . What were you thinking as it became clear that Eastern Europe was falling_away from the Soviet_Union , and how do you see those events now ? Answer . This was a time when our rejection of the Brezhnev doctrine ( which declared Moscow ' s right to intervene militarily to rescue a Communist regime under threat ) was already being tested most severely . It began in the first days when I was organizing ( Konstantin U. ) Chernenko ' s funeral ( in March , 1985 ) , and immediately after I became the general secretary of the Communist_Party Central Committee . I called_for a meeting . It was not reported to the news media . We discussed -- I told them -- that we would make a statement firmly supporting the position that we had declared more_than once before : equality , independence and non-interference in the domestic affairs of other countries . Every ( Communist ) party is responsible_for what it does_in its own country . I think my colleagues were not paying proper attention to these words . Perhaps it was because at that time there had been so many similar statements and everything had remained as before : strictly controlled . From that time on , this was our policy . Yes , of course we interacted . We took the initiative on many issues , especially on disarmament . But at_the_same_time , we supported proposals from the other Warsaw Pact countries . Of course , this was a novelty . Until then , usually initiatives had come from the Soviet_Union . Well , except for an occasional eccentric move by ( Romanian President Nicolae ) Ceausescu . Sometimes , in_order to demonstrate his independence , he would make some moves , as you remember . Yes , he made some proposals , but this was rather an exception , eccentric behavior . In general , everything was canonized and directed by the Soviet_Union . Not anymore . But that was the beginning , the recognition of freedom of choice for every nation . The other element of the new thinking was not to meddle . That a nation , whether it be the United States , the Soviet_Union , China or any other country , should not impose its will , its interests , its model , on other nations , but should seek a balance and harmonization of interests , however difficult or complex that might be . These are two elements of new thinking : recognition of freedom of choice for every nation and a balance of interests . This was the revolution . From the beginning , people said it was a revolution . This opened the way for people to make use of their natural rights . Yes , it was a very difficult choice , and people accepted this . They were influenced by perestroika ( restructuring of Soviet society ) and influenced by the changing situation in the world , and most of all , by the mutual_understanding and cooperation between the United States and the Soviet_Union . . . . The most critical moment was when , in Poland , the government had problems with Solidarity . I should say this was not a command , an order , or instructions from me to ( the Polish leader , Gen . Wojciech ) Jaruzelski . We were , by the way , great friends . We were friends , and we remain friends . Very great friends . I have a very high opinion of the general . I think the Poles were very lucky that he headed their government at that decisive , difficult moment . He was a real Pole , but at_the_same_time he was a man of a new background , with new views . For that reason , he did not use force ( against Solidarity ) and did not even introduce martial_law . He tried to defuse the situation quickly and then open the road to democracy and changes and reforms . This was a testing ground for perestroika . * Q . Was Jaruzelski surprised when you told him he had to come_to terms with Solidarity ? A . No . It came most of all from him . He understood that he had to find common_ground . How else could he resolve the conflict with Solidarity ? Even if one of their political_leaders irritates you or displeases you , still , this is the working class ! These are the narod , the people ! Jaruzelski understood this maybe even before I did . We had a real discussion . We talked . We didn ' t need translators , he speaks wonderful Russian , and we didn ' t waste time . As for the other cases . . . I could not order East_Germany to do exactly what we did . Do perestroika ! They needed it , I ' m sure . But they did not accept perestroika . ( East_German leader Erich ) Honecker rejected it , and so did most of his close entourage . And they lost . The process could have gone a different way if the GDR ( East_Germany ) had changed , had opened_up to the world , and allowed free contacts ( with other nations ) . Then the process of rapprochement with West Germany also would have been different . But that ' s water under the bridge now . But I remember how they resisted reform even though we did not demand anything of them . This was the very nature of perestroika , that we should teach them by our example , the example of perestroika . I did tell them that , in politics , latecomers lose . And I cited my own experience , of how we failed in the course of perestroika when we acted too late . I said this after I was at a candlelight march , when I saw young East_German men demonstrating against the regime . As for the fact that you noted , referring to ( then-Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula ) Horn , he ' s an old friend of mine . The issue was not that Horn had to consult with me . These contacts were conducted between our two foreign ministries . But nevertheless , we discussed the situation all_the time . We were in constant contact , not only with the Hungarians but with East_Germany and others as well . We were all worried about how to untie the knot . So many people were gathering , they demanded resolution of the conflict . What , should we kick them out with force ? We continued to be involved with the problem , but it caused a lot of tension in Hungary itself . And it put the Hungarian leadership in a peculiar position , as if it were dependent , not sovereign , as if it could not make its own decisions on its own soil . This problem had to be resolved . So at a certain moment , they decided to open their borders to the Germans . Yes , they did not consult with us . The situation had already changed . They probably thought_about it and decided not to put us in a very difficult spot , not to trap themselves in a situation where they consulted us and suddenly we might be against it ( opening the borders ) , and then they would still have to find a way to solve the problem . It was nothing dramatic . There were no sudden misunderstandings or any such thing . No , life had already changed . New winds were blowing and new flags were flying . This was the political context . The most important thing was our loyalty to our ideals . To the very end , we were faithful ( to our ideals. ) We did not interfere in their domestic affairs . We discussed the situation , we exchanged opinions , but we did not give anyone any ultimatums . Including the Czechs . The only thing we told the Czechs was that they should find a political solution and reject any use of force . But that was not a demand . It was friendly advice . We told them that any other policy would not have been accepted in Czechoslovakia or in the rest of the world .</TEXT>
