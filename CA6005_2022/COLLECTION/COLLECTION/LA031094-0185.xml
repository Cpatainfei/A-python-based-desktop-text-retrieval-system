   <HEADLINE> MIFFED YELTSIN SCRAPS TALKS WITH NIXON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A furious President Boris N . Yeltsin snubbed Richard Nixon on Wednesday , declaring he will not receive the former U.S. President now that Nixon has met with Yeltsin ' s archenemies . Yeltsin ' s sudden outburst , the latest jolt to U.S.-Russian relations , apparently took not only 81-year-old Nixon but also Yeltsin ' s own government by surprise . Yeltsin sent no private messages of warning or disapproval after Nixon met with former Vice_President Alexander V . Rutskoi on Monday and then with Communist_Party leader Gennady A . Zyuganov on Tuesday , Nixon adviser Dmitri K . Simes said . As late as Wednesday morning , Yeltsin ' s chief_of_staff twice confirmed that a Yeltsin-Nixon meeting would take_place , Simes said . Yeltsin was apparently especially infuriated by Nixon ' s meeting with Rutskoi , who was released from jail against Yeltsin ' s will only 12 days ago . He had been charged with treason for leading last October ' s violent parliamentary revolt . &quot; Former American President Nixon met Rutskoi and Zyuganov here , while the most interesting thing is that he had been coming here to meet me , &quot; an angry Yeltsin said Wednesday afternoon . &quot; Russia is still a great country , and you cannot just play with it like that. &quot; The Russian president also canceled meetings that had been scheduled for Nixon with Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin and Chief_of_Staff Sergei A . Filatov and announced that no other government officials will see him . &quot; Nyet ! After this , no ! &quot; Yeltsin told reporters after laying a wreath on the Kremlin grave of Soviet cosmonaut Yuri A . Gagarin . In case Nixon failed to appreciate the insult , a security detail consisting_of a car with three bodyguards that the Russian government had provided him was abruptly taken_back , said Simes , a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington who has arranged Nixon ' s recent trips to Russia . He added that the former President , who voluntarily gave_up his U.S. Secret_Service protection several years ago because he felt he did not need it , already had his own private guard service , arranged with a Russian company . And late Wednesday , Yeltsin ' s press service denied that the security detail had been removed , saying Nixon himself had said he did not require their services . At a hastily called news_conference , Simes said that both the U.S. and Russian governments had been told in_advance that Nixon was_on a private fact-finding mission , not an official state visit . Both sides knew that Nixon would meet with opposition figures , including ultranationalist lawmaker Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , who was shunned by President Clinton and Vice_President Al Gore during their official visits to Moscow . In Washington , Clinton said he had telephoned Nixon before the former President left on his 10-day visit to Russia . &quot; And I said he should meet with whomever he wanted and I ' d be interested to hear his reports when he got_back , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; President Yeltsin should not assume that Mr. Nixon is not friendly toward his administration and toward democracy and toward reform because , quite the contrary , he ' s been a very strong supporter of our policy for the last year , &quot; Clinton said . Clinton suggested that Yeltsin should not &quot; overreact &quot; to Nixon ' s meetings with opposition leaders and urged him to reconsider meeting with Nixon &quot; because I think they ' d enjoy talking to each other. &quot; Although the incident is probably not as serious as the recent tensions between the United States and Russia over policy toward the conflict in Bosnia-Herzegovina or over the Aldrich H . Ames espionage case , it once again demonstrates a new Russian determination not to tolerate what it considers demeaning treatment by the West . &quot; I don ' t know whether it was a mistake or a deliberate attempt to insult Russia , &quot; said Yeltsin spokesman Alexander B . Arfyonov . &quot; If one comes_on a visit , not to a banana republic but to Russia , one should thoroughly balance his actions and intentions. &quot; But as one of Yeltsin ' s earliest , most ardent supporters , Nixon is an odd target for the 63-year-old Siberian ' s ire . On a visit to Russia in April , 1991 , Nixon met Yeltsin against Gorbachev ' s wishes ; Nixon later urged Washington to forge better ties with Gorbachev ' s rivals . It also was Nixon who persuaded the George_Bush Administration to invite Yeltsin to the White_House when the State_Department had a dim view of the future Russian President , Simes said .</TEXT>
