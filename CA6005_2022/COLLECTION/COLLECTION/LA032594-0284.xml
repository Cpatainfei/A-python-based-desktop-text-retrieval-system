   <HEADLINE> SMALL AD_AGENCY IN O.C. PROVES BIG ON CREATIVITY ; ADVERTISING : SAKOL MONGKOLKASETARIN ' S ONE-MAN SHOP SNAGS FOUR OF THE INDUSTRY ' S ANNUAL BELDING AWARDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an industry that calculates its annual billings by the millions , 27-year-old Sakol Mongkolkasetarin , a graphic designer who runs a one-person advertising_agency from his Santa Ana apartment , figures that his billings for all_of 1994 will probably total $ 200 # 000 . But Thursday night , he competed with some of the big-money ad firms of Southern California and came_away with four of the industry ' s Belding awards . That was twice the number bestowed on hip Venice Beach agency Chiat / Day , creator of the Energizer Bunny campaign , and Mongkolkasetarin was the third-biggest winner of the night . &quot; I don ' t think I want to miss it now , &quot; he said with a huge smile Thursday afternoon as he paid a visit to his biggest client and prepared to car-pool with friends to Los Angeles for the posh awards ceremony . This ad whiz drives a white 1981 Toyota Corolla . Mongkolkasetarin and his firm , Acme Advertising , were honored for his work for Pacific Snax , a Newport Beach snack_food company that makes puffed rice in the shape of popcorn , flavored with caramel or Cheddar_cheese . &quot; Imagine if Uncle Ben married Orville Redenbacher , &quot; says one of the winning ads . The company also makes Jurassic Snacks , to be released with the video version of the movie later this year . Mongkolkasetarin ' s newspaper_ads for the dinosaur snacks will tout them as &quot; 65 million years in the making . But don ' t worry , they ' re vacuum-packed. &quot; He will also begin working later this spring on a snack package linked to the upcoming &quot; Flintstones &quot; movie_starring John Goodman and Rosie O ' Donnell . The designer said he stumbled upon what makes_good advertising after he was laid_off by one of Orange County ' s most prestigious ad_agencies , Cochrane Chase , Livingston &amp; Co. , when it shut_down in 1991 . &quot; I couldn ' t find a job , so I decided to find my own clients . I had friends who needed ads , &quot; Mongkolkasetarin said . &quot; When the client happens to be someone I know personally , there is a connection . You have a chemistry , and good work happens that way. &quot; Featuring cherubs , halos and corncobs , the designs for Pacific Snax ' s packages &quot; give an image of a higher plane of eating &quot; that the company desired for its health-conscious snacks , said Jerry H . Ludeman , senior_vice_president of sales . Mongkolkasetarin has one other client , computer_peripherals maker Triam . Together with Thursday ' s top two winners , also small agencies , Mongkolkasetarin ' s victory supports a popular belief that the very best advertising ideas in the Los Angeles area are being created by small agencies . Mongkolkasetarin also employs old-fashioned courtesy . &quot; He is always polite and on_time , and when he says he will have the work done , it is done , &quot; said Roya Cuentara , chief financial_officer of Pacific Snax . &quot; He takes criticism very well. &quot; A native of Thailand , Mongkolkasetarin moved to Southern California when he was 6 and has returned to Bangkok just once , to attend his grandfather ' s funeral in 1991 . He asks that people call him Sakol ( SAY-koh ) rather than attempt his last_name ( Mon-GOL-ka-say-TAR-in ) . Though he says his Thai background remains an important influence , Mongkolkasetarin identifies himself primarily as a Southern Californian . Until recently , he said , he jogged , surfed and rode his bike to an office where he briefly sublet space . But life has gotten more hectic , Mongkolkasetarin said . &quot; I gave_up running , sold my board , and my bike is hanging_in the closet , &quot; he said . He comes from a family of creative people . Father Stitaya Mongkolkasetarin , a free-lance architect , emigrated from Bangkok in 1968 with his Chinese Vietnamese wife , Am , a dressmaker who has a shop in the Little Saigon area of Westminster and Garden Grove . Their children came_to the United States four years later . Stitaya Mongkolkasetarin was laid_off from a job with Fluor Corp . in 1991 , and Sakol , the oldest son , decided to start a family_business . His father took a second loan out on their house to pay_for $ 10 # 000 worth of computer equipment . The four brothers -- Sakol , Jsada , Kreangsuk and Sumith -- turned the living room of the family ' s Fountain Valley home into a studio and opened for business in January , 1992 . During their first year , the brothers , who called themselves the M Group , billed about $ 42 # 000 . The brothers have since gone_on to other ventures , Sakol has renamed the firm Acme Advertising , and he has repaid his parents , in part by designing award-winning direct-mail ads for his mother ' s business . Mongkolkasetarin has also done design work for Balboa Bay Beverage Inc. and Pacific Mutual Life_Insurance Inc. in Newport Beach . His agency ' s reputation spread after it developed a creative series of public-service ads for the local chapter of the American Cancer Society . One ad compares the dangers of cigarettes to those of drugs by picturing marijuana , tobacco and poppies . In 1993 , the M Group won gold , silver and merit awards from the Orange County AdClub . It was a finalist last year in the Advertising Club of Los Angeles ' Belding awards . And it won merit awards from the Art_Directors Club of Los Angeles and the New York Art_Directors Club . Mongkolkasetarin graduated from Cal State Long_Beach in 1990 with a degree in graphic design . He was an assistant art_director for 18 months at Cochrane Chase , where he met Richard Damian , chief_executive_officer of Pacific Snax . &quot; The reason I got_into this , &quot; he said , &quot; is that not just one person sees my work . Millions of people see it . that ' s what satisfies me. &quot; * GROWING THREAT : Tiny ad shops ' coups send message to giant rivals . D14</TEXT>
