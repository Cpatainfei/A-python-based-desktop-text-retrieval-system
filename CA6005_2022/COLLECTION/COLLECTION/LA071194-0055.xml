   <HEADLINE> WASHINGTON OUTLOOK : IS THE GOP TOO TIMID TO SAY NO TO THE RELIGIOUS RIGHT ? ; A PARTY CAN ONLY ARTICULATE THE NATIONAL INTEREST WHEN IT IS WILLING TO TEMPER THE DEMANDS OF ITS SUPPORTERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Scam may be too strong a word , but there ' s an undeniable element of mutual self-interest in the recent skirmishes between Republicans and Democrats over the political role of religious conservatives . Both sides are primarily aiming their invective at their own partisans . Democrats are trying to invigorate their activist liberal base by raising the specter of a &quot; radical &quot; fringe using &quot; subterranean tactics &quot; to engineer a &quot; stealth takeover &quot; of the GOP , as Rep . Vic Fazio ( D-West Sacramento ) breathlessly declared in a recent speech . Republicans are trying to stoke their activist Christian base by accusing the Democrats of a jihad against all Americans of faith . This hothouse holy war is less a genuine debate than a conspiracy to rouse the faithful . that ' s too_bad , because there is a legitimate issue in the growing prominence of religious conservatives -- not whether Christians are &quot; taking_over &quot; the Republican_Party , but how the GOP deals with the kind of insistent interest-group demands that have long bedeviled Democrats . Fazio and other leading Democrats are trying to portray religious conservatives as God ' s fifth_column -- an insidious force_out to subvert not only the GOP but the separation of church and state itself . But conservative Christians are not a new , singularly threatening movement that needs to be uniquely segregated from American politics . To the contrary : They are a force entirely familiar in American politics -- an interest_group systematically organizing to expand its influence within one of the national political_parties . In fact , together with the anti-abortion movement , religious conservatives are rapidly becoming the most powerful interest_group in the GOP -- the equivalent of organized labor within the Democratic Party . Republican pollster Bill McInturff says about one in five GOP primary voters nationwide -- and one in three in the South -- are religious conservatives . Those figures are comparable_to the numbers that unions can marshal in key Democratic primaries . That parallel points to the real issue raised by the ascent of the religious right : Are Republicans willing to stand_up for the national interest when it conflicts with the narrow agenda of_their_own party ' s most powerful special_interest ? For a political_party , that ' s a dangerous test to fail -- as Democrats well understand . For years , Republicans battered Democrats by arguing they lacked the will to say no to powerful constituencies like organized labor and civil_rights groups when their demands didn ' t serve the nation as_a_whole . But Democrats began to stiffen their backbone after the disastrous 1984 presidential campaign , when Walter F . Mondale lost 49 states . In retrospect , the turning point came_in an early primary debate when Gary Hart asked Mondale to name a single issue on which he disagreed_with organized labor . Mondale refused -- and indelibly stamped himself the candidate of &quot; special interests. &quot; That was a defining moment , not only for Mondale but also for the party , which increasingly took Hart ' s message to heart . Although President Clinton has excessively deferred to liberal interest_groups on some issues -- such_as the racial justice measure now senselessly stalling the crime bill -- he has stared_down civil_rights groups to withdraw the nomination of C . Lani Guinier ; defied feminist groups with his welfare plan , and , most dramatically , gone_to the mat against organized labor to pass the North_American Free_Trade Agreement . Where are the comparable examples today of prominent conservatives standing_up to the demands of the religious right ? When former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp was asked an updated version of the Hart question recently on NBC-TV ' s &quot; Meet the Press , &quot; he hemmed , hawed , filibustered -- and couldn ' t produce a single instance in which he disagreed_with broadcaster Pat Robertson and his Christian Coalition . Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) promises to face down Clinton on health_care , but he ' s shown less resolve in bucking Robertson . The day after Virginia Republicans nominated Oliver L . North for the U.S. Senate last month , Dole signaled his reluctance to embrace a man who has admitted misleading Congress during the Iran-Contra affair , and hinted he might endorse independent J . Marshall Coleman . Dole quickly heard objections from a number of voices , but perhaps most powerfully from Robertson -- who informed him that support for North would be &quot; symbolically important from a 1996 point_of_view &quot; to Christian conservatives , according to one source familiar_with the events . Within days , Dole had endorsed North . Most revealing has been the Republican silence on the Rev . Jerry Falwell ' s distribution of a videotape in which , among other things , Clinton is accused of complicity in murder . Paul Begala , a top Clinton political adviser , says that just as Democrats are pressured to denounce black nationalist Louis Farrakhan ' s anti-Semitic creeds , Republicans should now be required &quot; to either embrace or denounce Jerry Falwell ' s accusation of murder against the President. &quot; Hardly any Republicans have stepped_up to that bar . Former Education_Secretary William J . Bennett has condemned Falwell , and Kemp coughed_up a milder objection when repeatedly squeezed in a television interview . But most other leading Republicans have ducked the issue . Asked recently about Falwell ' s video , Dole , House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) and likely 1996 presidential candidate Dick Cheney all said through spokesmen that they hadn ' t personally seen the tape and couldn ' t comment on it -- even though the video ' s contents have been widely reported . When convenient , these same Republicans have been less scrupulous in their standards of evidence : They have not hesitated to rely_on newspaper accounts to condemn the attacks on religious conservatives from Fazio , Democratic National Committee Chairman David Wilhelm and Surgeon_General Joycelyn Elders . It is a measure of the GOP ' s timidity that even some prominent religious conservatives consider it morally untenable to denounce the Democrats while absolving Falwell . Richard Cizik , a policy analyst for the National Assn . of Evangelicals , says the President should disavow the sweeping accusations against evangelical Christians from Fazio and Elders . But he has no objection to Clinton ' s recent outburst against Falwell . &quot; I think he ( Clinton ) needs to draw distinctions , and because I ' ve asked him to do so , it ' s incumbent_on me to do the same , &quot; said Cizik , a Presbyterian minister . &quot; I don ' t think Falwell should do_it . It ' s not becoming of him as a minister , and I say that as a minister. &quot; The reason Republicans should draw such distinctions is not because religious conservatives have any less inherent right to press their agenda than any other group . It is because Hart was right : A party can only articulate the national interest when it is willing to temper the demands of its supporters , not just the groups allied_with its rival . The Republicans are facing that test now on Falwell . They will confront it again as the GOP begins its 1996 debates on issues such_as equal rights for homosexuals , and whether to rewrite the party platform on abortion to reflect the conflicting views of the overall GOP electorate more closely than the rigid anti-abortion plank now in place . &quot; The principle is the same , &quot; Hart said in an interview . &quot; The first test of leadership is whether you are able to take_on elements of_your_own party who are not operating in the best interest of the party and the country . Those who try to skirt around it sacrifice their credibility as leaders. &quot; Where the Born-Again Vote Has Gone Estimates of the number of Americans who consider themselves evangelical , or born-again , Christians vary from about 12 % to 25 % of the total population , depending_on the definition . Exit polls from the past four presidential elections show that white born-again_Christians have become a critical element of the Republican political coalition : 1992 : George_Bush ( R ) : 55 % Bill_Clinton ( D ) : 26 % Ross Perot ( I ) : 19 % 1988 : George_Bush ( R ) : 71 % Michael Dukakis ( D ) : 27 % 1984 : Ronald Reagan ( R ) : 78 % Walter Mondale ( D ) : 22 % 1980 : Ronald Reagan ( R ) : 63 % Jimmy_Carter ( D ) : 33 % John Anderson ( I ) : 3 % Sources : Los Angeles Times exit polls 1992 , 1988 , 1984 ; NYT / CBS 1980</TEXT>
