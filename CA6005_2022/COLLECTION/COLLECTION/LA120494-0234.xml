   <HEADLINE> PROP . 187 OPPONENTS USE DOUBLE_STANDARD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I am getting more_than a little upset at the constant trivializing in The Times and other media of the Holocaust in Germany and Europe by opponents of Proposition 187 . The latest , the wearing of yellow stars by people who have no concept of the suffering brought upon the Jewish people , has me particularly appalled . If your readers really want to see what the Holocaust was like I can send some pictures . For your uninformed readers and editors , here are some important facts . * The Holocaust sent over 6 million people to death . * The Holocaust was directed primarily against Jews , who were legal citizens of their countries . * Proposition 187 seeks to control illegal immigration by people of every race , color , religion and nationality , which every_other country on Earth does . * Mexico was one of the biggest protesters against 187 , primarily because it does not wish to take_care of its own poor and uses us as a safety_valve -- while vigorously defending their own southern borders against illegals . * If the U.S._government had meddled in the Mexican election , it would have created an international incident leading to unanimous cries against Yankee imperialism . Explain to me the constant railing about the illegality and theoretical unconstitutionality of 187 by foes of the measure , but the total disregard for the law by these same people as it applies to the illegal immigrants who by definition are law-breakers . JON E . CURRIE Agoura Hills * The people of California have overwhelmingly approved Proposition 187 . It is time for the &quot; No on 187 &quot; citizens to accept reality , initiate the will of the people and join forces to make 187 work . To complete what 187 started , our borders must be secure , illegal aliens immediately deported and the process for legal immigration streamlined , organized and made fair and available equally to people of all nations . Politicians who still oppose 187 will have short political careers . Organizations that mount legal battles will only increase the cost to the taxpayers who approved this measure . Unconstitutional ? If anti-187 people are concerned with the law_of_the_land , then they should define illegal immigration . Racist and anti-Latino ? What about claiming illegal acts_as justifiable if they are committed by &quot; their own &quot; and for &quot; their cause ? &quot; Have they forgotten about the people of the rest of the world who would also like to immigrate to the United States , but don ' t have the geographical advantage that the people of Mexico are exploiting ?
