   <HEADLINE> AT THE BIRTH OF A NEW -- AND YOUNGER -- LATINO ACTIVISM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On Election_Day , a friend of mine , a Mexican American school administrator , called me . Earlier that day , one of his students , a 12-year-old girl , had approached him before class and cautiously asked him if she was still allowed to come_to school the next day . As an educator , my friend has seen drug_abuse , child_abuse and classroom neglect . Still , he told me , in a voice choked with emotion , this was his most painful experience yet . Is this the intention of Proposition 187 , which would , among other things , deny a public education to illegal immigrants ? Is this the message that Gov . Pete Wilson , and all who voted for the initiative , wanted to send to Washington concerning the nation ' s fastest-growing ethnic_group ? Was it , &quot; stop growing ? &quot; I was not really surprised that some Latinos -- presumably , some of my fellow Mexican Americans -- would vote for such a spiteful initiative . Indeed , a Los Angeles Times exit poll found that 22 % of them voted to &quot; save our state. &quot; But from whom ? From those who share our surnames , skin_color and Catholic saints ? For months , Mexican Americans op- posed to 187 had been confessing their anger and frustration that some of our gente would tacitly support it . The diagnosis was amnesia . It was said that , in our eagerness to be accepted by the white mainstream , we had forgotten where we come from and the significance of those old black-and-white photographs in Grandmother ' s dresser drawer . But on Election_Day , we did not forget where we come from ; more times than not , we remembered . Just a_few weeks earlier , a Times poll had revealed that up_to 52 % of surveyed Latinos favored Proposition 187 , a figure that was cut_in half when the generic &quot; illegal alien &quot; assumed a brown face and , thanks to Gov . Wilson , a name , &quot; Pedro. &quot; That is only part of the silver_lining to this black cloud . Finally , scores of angry Mexican Americans are realizing that , in times of crisis , the sidelines are an irresponsible place to stand . My phone rings endlessly with people asking , &quot; What should we do now ? &quot; The school administrator assures that even if 187 is upheld in the courts , he will not enforce it . &quot; They can fire me . They can arrest me . But I won ' t do_it ! &quot; A young Mexican-American surgeon tells me the same thing . &quot; I hope the jail_cells are big enough for me to operate in . . . because that ' s where they ' ll have to put me. &quot; The Mexican-American Christian youth minister is rambling_on about some higher law , and preparing meetings of young people to invent creative ways to &quot; circumvent &quot; what he considers an immoral man-made law . The signs are everywhere . La resistance is forming . Look beyond the Mexican flags in the newspaper photographs . There ! That young_girl , barely 15 , speaking with such passion about an issue that hit close to home . Disproving the myth that Generation X lacks a political soul , she is the answer to the dreams of scores of Latino grandmothers . She is also the nightmare of old_guard Mexican American leadership , teetering on irrelevancy at the brink of a new century . She is our 21st Century mayor , our governor . All this has been her political baptism -- her Chicago Democratic convention , her Kent State . If she becomes naturalized , if she registers , if she votes , the fire in her belly will warm us all . Of course , the road to political empowerment is a bumpy one . Without much of a blueprint to follow , such youngsters are sure to make mistakes . They may revert to the familiar apathy -- Latin_American fatalism -- that paralyzed those who came_before them . They may assume , wrongly , that there are no allies to be found among non-Latinos . They may follow their elders down the narrow path of devotion to only one political_party , cutting_off important avenues of communication and cooperation . They may even cannibalize themselves , turning_on one another instead of working together toward common ends . In short , these political novices will stumble along in much the same way older politicos did years ago . Inevitably , along the way , the paths of the old and the young will meet . Expect hotly contested political races -- Latino vs . Latino . Expect a shifting of power away from Gloria Molina and Mike Hernandez and Richard Allatorre and toward a new crop of charismatic immigrant leaders with youth and energy . When I was a child , my father used to tell me stories about a Sleeping Giant . Look_at a map : Latinos are 40 % of this city , 60 % of that one . So_much political dynamite , he ' d lament , and no spark to light it . For much of my lifetime , people have teased the Giant ; knowing he would n ' t wake_up , they poked and prodded . Last year , in Fresno , when the City_Council rescinded an earlier order to rename a street after the late Cesar Chavez , there were complaints and grumblings . Old politicos cursed the council for its gesture of political disrespect but , in the end , they reverted to their familiar cynicism and the Giant slept on . Somehow , as I study the pictures in the morning paper and hear the passionate testimony of young people savoring their first taste of politics , I cannot imagine that a new generation will continue to be as resigned to insult as previous ones . Make no mistake . No matter how many champagne corks were popped_in celebration last week , this is not the end . What distinguishes the new Latino activism from that of previous generations is , among other things , fierce immigrant identity among the young , who seem more interested in a devout nationalism than in the lofty American traditions of assimilation . The new activists want not so_much to be accepted as_to be respected . They seem to have already learned the first lesson of American politics : Power concedes nothing without demand . At the threshold of a new century in which the population of Latinos will continue to grow -- as Jack Kemp and William Bennett noted &quot; with or without immigration &quot; -- this is , for a new and more politically active generation , a new beginning. *</TEXT>
