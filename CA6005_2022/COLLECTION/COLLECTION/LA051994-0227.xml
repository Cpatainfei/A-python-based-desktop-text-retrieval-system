   <HEADLINE> PALESTINIANS IN GAZA SAVOR FIRST TASTE OF FREEDOM ; AUTONOMY : TROOPS GET FAREWELL SHOWER OF STONES AND LOB TEAR_GAS IN RETURN . BUT OPPOSING COLONELS SHARE A LAUGH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just hours before this area exploded in celebration of Israel officially ending 27 years of military occupation , an Israeli colonel and his Palestinian counterpart stood_in the darkness early Wednesday discussing the last-minute logistics of the historic transfer of power . Suddenly , the Israeli stopped in mid-sentence . He looked_up at Col . Faisal Fahoum , the Palestinian brigade commander who had just set foot on his home soil for the first time since he left as a child when modern Israel was created in 1948 . &quot; I can ' t believe we ' re standing here next to each other talking like this ! &quot; the Israeli said . Fahoum , a warrior once committed to destroying Israel , smiled and replied : &quot; If you came_to me two years ago and said we would be here together like this , I would have laughed and called it the Eighth Wonder of the World ! &quot; The two lifelong enemies then laughed together . They clasped hands . And before the sun was up , they helped usher_in the dawn of a new era of Palestinian autonomy , as Israeli commanders turned_over the last of their bases . Thus ended a two-week transition to Palestinian rule_in Gaza . It was accompanied by farewell showers of Palestinian stones , retaliatory grenades of tear_gas and thousands of rounds of joyous Palestinian gunfire . The encounter between the two colonels was but one of many scenes that captured the irony and incredulity of Gaza ' s first_moment of freedom -- and the Israeli military ' s first taste of relief . &quot; Thank God we ' re gone ! &quot; said a young Israeli soldier flashing the V-sign from a jeep crossing the border into Israel , where a young Palestinian soldier who lived his life in exile flashed V-signs on his way in . When the last Israeli soldier left just after sunrise from the border post of the Israeli army spokesman ' s office , which issued the only official accounts of the hundreds of Palestinians and scores of Israelis who were killed during the decades of occupation , he threw his rucksack over his shoulder , slammed a door scrawled with the large Hebrew word for &quot; Closed ! ! ! &quot; and declared : &quot; Finally , it ' s really over. &quot; Inside a third-grade classroom of a Palestinian school at the refugee village known as Beach Camp , deep inside Gaza , an 8-year-old Palestinian boy reflected just how dramatic this week ' s transformation has been for the nearly 1 million Gazans . The boy ' s eyes grew wide with disbelief when he spotted through his classroom window the first armed Palestinian patrols . &quot; Look ! &quot; he shouted to his teacher . &quot; They are our Jews ! &quot; &quot; No , &quot; his teacher explained gently and with cautious pride . &quot; They are Palestinians . They are our new Palestinian security_force , and today we are celebrating them . We are celebrating our new flag , our new freedom , the beginning of our new state. &quot; But for most Gazans , it was just that -- a beginning . And after the sun rose on the newly autonomous Gaza -- which will be governed along with a small enclave around the West_Bank town of Jericho by a Palestinian Authority -- the celebrations quickly gave_way to the realities of the limited self-rule agreement between Israel and Palestine Liberation Chairman Yasser Arafat . The accord allows almost 5 # 000 Jewish settlers to remain in 13 sprawling enclaves throughout Gaza . There Israel merely redeployed many of its soldiers to protect the settlers during the coming years of continuing negotiations . Israel also will control Gaza ' s borders , its airspace and territorial_waters . The settlements , in particular , are problematic . The Israeli military was forced to cancel a ceremony pledging their future in Gaza when leaders of the settlement where the event was to occur said they wanted no part of it . And foreshadowing how the Israeli enclaves are likely to become flash_points for violence , a Jewish settler was wounded at the Gaza settlement of Nitzarim in a Wednesday night drive-by_shooting . Even Gen . Nasser Yussef , commander of the new Palestinian security_force -- the symbol of the first real change here since Israel began making_peace with the Palestinians and its Arab neighbors almost three years ago -- said he told his Israeli counterparts early Wednesday : &quot; This is a partial agreement , and it needs more. &quot; He insisted that the settlers ultimately must leave Gaza . Yussef spoke with cautious pride when he met with reporters at the Gaza City Governor ' s Mansion -- the headquarters of Israel ' s military_governor and the Egyptian and British occupation commanders in the Gaza Strip before him . &quot; This is the kind of feeling that was paid_for with thousands of lives of our people , &quot; he said , describing Wednesday . &quot; This is an immortal day . This is a day we have all dreamed of . This is a day of great joy . . . . But it is just a first step. &quot; He quickly turned_to more practical matters . As his ragtag force fanned_out into military bases that the Israelis had stripped bare , other Palestinian officers began directing traffic . And Yussef established his goals , saying , &quot; Our first priority is security. &quot; He said his new force has no plans to confiscate weapons from Gaza ' s many well-armed resistance groups , including Islamic fundamentalists and leftist underground militias that oppose Arafat ' s autonomy plan . He said he hopes that owners will quickly register their weapons and that the arms ultimately will be brought under his commanders ' control . &quot; Hamas is part of our nation , &quot; he said of the best-organized , most potent fundamentalist opposition to Arafat ' s PLO faction . &quot; They are our brothers . We have had a lot of contacts and meetings . . . . We will work together. &quot; But Brig . Gen . Doron Almog , Yussef ' s departing Israeli counterpart and the last Israeli to leave the autonomous Gaza Strip , was less certain . He was reacting to vows by Hamas and other radical Palestinian groups to continue their attacks on Israeli targets until the last Jewish settlement is out of Gaza . &quot; I ' m walking on tiptoes , &quot; he told Israel Radio . &quot; I estimate there will be terrorist activities , and we , as any army , have to be prepared. &quot; But Almog also found reasons for optimism Wednesday . &quot; The Palestinian police are very motivated for peace , and that gives us great hope , &quot; he said of the force reassembled from Palestinian brigades that have served under half_a_dozen Arab armies for the last three decades . &quot; And also they are disciplined -- not organized , but disciplined. &quot; Most Gazans , especially after the celebrations had died_down later Wednesday , shared Almog ' s concern about the security in the Gaza Strip in the days to come . Consider the views of Nasser Dajany . He owns the Jala Theater , which was shut by the Israelis , along with every_other movie_theater in Gaza , seven years ago . &quot; We want very much to start_up again , but we will wait two or three months . It depends_on how secure the situation will be , &quot; Dajany said . He said he has complete confidence the new Palestinian police can keep order . But he fears opposition to his enterprise from Islamic fundamentalists , who have condemned movies as a sinful and decadent form of entertainment . Meantime , he and other Gazans found great happiness in a simpler pleasure : They again can stroll the streets after 8 p.m. For seven years , since the start of the intifada , the Palestinian uprising , the Israeli military imposed a strict nightly curfew . Tuesday night and Wednesday night , however , the streets of Gaza City were jammed with families . &quot; It ' s such a great joy just to be able to walk in these streets at night , &quot; one young_woman said . * MISSING BLUEPRINT : Palestinians worry about lack of guidelines from PLO .
