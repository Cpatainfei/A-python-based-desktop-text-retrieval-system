   <TEXT> Victor Crawford ' s story is sadly familiar , that of a man who started smoking in his early teens and now is dying of cancer . But Crawford stands_out among the thousands who share his predicament , because he is a former lobbyist for the Tobacco Institute and has turned_on his former client -- speaking out against youth smoking and the tactics of the industry . &quot; I ' ve got_to make some amends , &quot; the 62-year-old Maryland lawyer said in an interview . &quot; And I have heard back from my former employers that they don ' t think it ' s quite kosher to bite the hand that fed you -- and they have a good point . . . . It ' s just that I think my point ' s more important. &quot; Besides , &quot; What are they going_to do , give me cancer ? &quot; A veteran Maryland state_senator , Crawford later cashed_in as a lobbyist , helping the tobacco_industry gut public smoking curbs . Wearing a wig to hide the baldness caused by cancer treatments , Crawford earlier this year returned to his old statehouse stomping grounds to urge support for tough workplace smoking rules . He joined former Surgeon_General C . Everett Koop in radio ads calling_for a higher federal tax on cigarettes to discourage youth smoking . &quot; I don ' t work for the tobacco_industry anymore , &quot; he said in one ad . &quot; I was diagnosed with throat cancer , caused by smoking . It ' s too late for me , but not for our kids. &quot; Crawford also weighed in against California ' s Proposition 188 , warning that the industry-drafted measure to repeal local ordinances would &quot; set the anti-smoking movement back 30 years. &quot; It was defeated in November . And while struggling to maintain his law_practice , Crawford has made time for activists and officials seeking advice in the smoking wars . Mississippi Atty . Gen . Mike Moore , who has sued tobacco firms to recover state health-care costs , was a recent visitor . * Tall and gaunt , with a trial_lawyer ' s instinct for theater , Crawford betrays little self-pity , and seems more angry at himself than the cigarette makers . &quot; What the hell , it ' s my own fault , &quot; he said . &quot; I was well-paid , and paid right on_time . . . . I took their money , and I knew it was bad , ( but ) it was the great American_Dream -- who cares as long as you ' re making money ? &quot; Crawford ' s dramatic conversion has made him something of a hero to the anti-smoking cause . &quot; This is his finest hour , &quot; said Bruce Adams , a member of the Montgomery County , Md. , county council and a tobacco foe who previously fought Crawford over anti-smoking legislation . &quot; Here ' s a guy who has obviously suffered tremendously . . . and anyone could completely understand if he wanted to be doing things for himself , &quot; Adams said . Yet , &quot; He decided he was wrong and he spoke out. &quot; For their part , industry officials seem loath to criticize . &quot; He has the right to say what he believes , &quot; said Brennan Dawson , spokeswoman for the Tobacco Institute . Calling Crawford a &quot; dear friend , &quot; Bruce C . Bereano , a veteran lobbyist for the institute in Maryland , said he understood &quot; what ( Crawford ) is doing and why . . . . It is not a reckless , knee-jerk reaction. &quot; But &quot; I guess the way to put it is , I wish he were not doing_it , &quot; Bereano said . The institute &quot; was his client once , and I just have different views about . . . a lawyer having a client ( and ) taking a conflicting position with that client subsequently. &quot; Crawford , Bereano said , also may be &quot; being used by groups and the media in terms of_their_own public policy agendas. &quot; * Crawford , a Democrat , served 16 years in the Maryland legislature before retiring in 1983 . He resumed a full-time law_practice and began lobbying for a_few white-hat clients . But Crawford knew the big bucks came from rich , embattled industries . &quot; I was_on the lookout for that , and when ( the Tobacco Institute ) first approached me ( in 1986 ) , I said sure , I was real , real interested. &quot; During the next six years , Crawford went_to battle against smoking restrictions . The industry was determined &quot; to fight everything , stall everything . . . ( to ) buy_time until the Third_World countries are flooded , &quot; he said . When the argument seemed hopeless , as it often did , Crawford changed the subject -- portraying his adversaries as &quot; health Nazis &quot; bent_on destroying freedom of choice . &quot; You never attack the message . You attack the messengers , &quot; Crawford said . &quot; You can ' t attack the message . . . because it ' s obvious . I mean , for example , ' Is it addictive ? ' Ask anybody who smokes a pack or more a day , especially if they started in their teens , to just stop and see what they go_through . . . . &quot; Even now , after all I ' ve been through , I ' d still love a cigarette . Sitting here , drinking a cup of coffee , a cigarette would be so great . And if that ' s not an addiction , I don ' t know what is. &quot; When Crawford was a kid , Bogart and Cagney were chain-smoking heroes of the silver_screen . &quot; You weren ' t a real man unless you smoked , &quot; he recalled . And so he did -- starting with cigarettes at age 13 and later switching to pipes and cigars . Crawford learned he had throat cancer in January , 1992 . &quot; Victor , &quot; he said the doctor told him , &quot; You ' re right out of a medical textbook -- you ' ve got a lesion on your throat , and it ' s from smoking. &quot; Surgeons saved Crawford ' s voice , but removed the lymph_nodes and all_the muscle from the left side of his neck . He had radiation treatments and thought he was doing pretty well -- until he learned last year that the malignancy had spread . Crawford was disgusted that he , like so many others , had fallen_into the trap of believing it could not happen to him . &quot; It ' s always the other fellow , &quot; he said . &quot; How do you get an 18- or 19-year-old to charge_up a hill to a machine-gun nest ? It ' s the other guy who ' s going_to get it. &quot; Then , when it happens to you , &quot; you feel_like a bit of an ass. &quot; At the oncology center , seeing the suffering of fellow patients , he also thought , &quot; Did I help cause some of this ? Sure . Am I now paying the price for it ? Sure. &quot; * Still , Crawford did not experience a lightning conversion . He did not want to make a spectacle of himself , nor be seen as disloyal . For a long_time pride and caution held him back . But for a remarkable encounter , he might never have spoken out . Crawford practiced t ' ai chi ch ' uan , the Chinese exercise regimen , and on Saturday mornings joined other t ' ai chi devotees in a park . Another in the group was Michael Pertschuk , former head of the Federal Trade Commission and co-director of the Advocacy Institute , an anti-smoking group . Pertschuk knew Crawford only as one of the more flamboyant practitioners of t ' ai chi . Otherwise , the men were strangers . Then one Saturday in the fall of 1993 , &quot; I noticed he had gotten very thin , and I thought , ' uh-oh , ' &quot; Pertschuk recalled . Several in the group went_to breakfast that morning , and Pertschuk and Crawford talked for the first time . &quot; I used to be a tobacco lobbyist , &quot; Pertschuk remembered him saying . &quot; Now I ' ve got throat cancer , and I guess I got my just deserts. &quot; It was the wildest coincidence . Like others in the anti-smoking movement , Pertschuk had marveled at how well the industry had kept its minions in_line . A business so large and controversial would be expected to produce its share of moles and defectors -- yet rarely had any come_forward . If insiders were carrying around delicious secrets or a sense of guilt , they had kept them to themselves . And yet here was Victor Crawford , voicing such regrets . Crawford , however , was not ready to go public . &quot; He wasn ' t sure he wanted to turn_on people who had been good to him , people he had worked with , &quot; Pertschuk said . But later , at Pertschuk ' s suggestion , Crawford agreed to an off-the-record meeting with the writer of a profile on tobacco executives . After they talked last winter , the writer , Roger Rosenblatt , urged Crawford to step into the light . &quot; Washington is_full of these nameless , faceless , well-placed sources who are journalists talking to each other , &quot; Crawford recalled Rosenblatt saying . Crawford gave permission , and his story became the powerful conclusion of the article , which ran last March in the New York Times Magazine . * Crawford since has been much in_demand . &quot; Suddenly , here I am , sort of like Topsy . I seem to have growed , &quot; he said . But &quot; somebody ' s got_to do_it , and I seem to have been elected. &quot; &quot; The wonderful thing ( Crawford ) does is to expose their hypocrisy in a way that no one else can , &quot; Pertschuk said . &quot; He ' s got incredible courage , and he just faces cancer and death with an insouciance that I hope I have . But beyond that , this has given him meaning. &quot; With his sense of irony and self-effacing wit , Crawford seems like a man who would be tickled by the turn his life has taken , if only his prospects weren ' t so dim . He talks_of his treatments with taxol , an experimental cancer_drug derived from the bark of the yew , found in the dwindling old-growth forests of the Pacific Northwest . In the past , when Crawford read about an endangered minnow or weed blocking a highway project , he thought the world had gone mad . His attitude adjustment has been such_that he now gives to the Sierra Club . &quot; I like to say that I owe my life to the spotted owl , &quot; Crawford joked . &quot; There ' s nothing like being directly affected. &quot;</TEXT>
