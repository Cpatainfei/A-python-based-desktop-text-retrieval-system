   <TEXT> Terence de Vere White , an Irish novelist and critic , has died of Parkinson ' s disease . He was 82 . White died Friday at his London home , according to a death notice published in Saturday ' s Daily Telegraph . White attended Trinity College in his native Dublin and planned to become a lawyer , like his father . But he left the law in 1961 to become the literary editor of the_Irish Times . He went_on to write 26 books -- the last of them , the novel &quot; Chat Show , &quot; seven years ago . &quot; Lucifer Falling &quot; in 1967 was the first of his books to be published in the United States as well as in Great Britain . Reviewing the novel , The Times ' critic noted that White &quot; fascinatingly treads the shoals and devious paths of the Dublin university he creates with surety , nimble wit , biting humor , sardonic description , and , oftentimes , compassion. &quot; White was made a member of the_Irish Academy of Letters in 1968 . In 1977 , White left Dublin and moved to London to be near the biographer and novelist Victoria Glendinning , whom he married in 1982 . The author is survived by his wife and by three children from his first marriage .</TEXT>
