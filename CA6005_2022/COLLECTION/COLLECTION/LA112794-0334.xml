   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; BOSNIA PEACEKEEPING ROLE MAKES U.N. FORCES PAWNS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The see-no-evil neutrality embraced by the United Nations in the midst of savage nationalist bloodletting has step by step transformed the 50 # 000-strong U.N. Protection Force in the Balkans from a peacekeeping mission into an army of pawns . The international community ' s determination to limit its involvement in the war-torn region to humanitarian ventures -- instead of military intervention to stop the fighting -- has increasingly put the men and women of a misguided mission in harm ' s way . Hundreds of U.N. troops are being held hostage by angry Serbian rebels in Bosnia-Herzegovina as a hedge against further use of NATO air_power . The 1 # 200 Bangladeshi soldiers in embattled Bihac in northwestern Bosnia are battened_down in their quarters to escape the artillery siege raining death onto the local civilians they were deployed to protect , just as U.N. contingents assigned to besieged eastern enclaves became fellow captives with the Muslims in their care . From the rebel-encircled enclaves of Srebrenica , Gorazde and Zepa , to the mission headquarters here that Croatian Serbs have threatened with Frog missiles , U.N. soldiers and statesmen are at the mercy of the Serbian warriors who have always had the upper_hand and now show no restraint in their will to use it . By steadfastly refusing to take sides , the U.N. mission is seen by its intended beneficiaries not as neutral so_much as indifferent . Symbolic displays of NATO resolve to protect U.N. &quot; safe areas &quot; have failed to impress the rebel forces attacking them or to convince the civilian victims that the outside world even cares . With its choice of a peacekeeping mission over military intervention at the start of the conflict in Bosnia more_than 2 1 / 2 years ago , the international community gambled that ignoring injustices would facilitate a pragmatic settlement and at least a tentative peace . But with the relentless rebel assault on Bihac -- one of six purported U.N.-protected safe zones -- it has become clear that the often-brandished but little-used sword of North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization air_power is not taken seriously by the advancing Serbian forces . Nor are the international community ' s vows to prevent the fall of Bihac being given much weight by Bosnian government forces , who have been given an ultimatum by the surrounding Serbs to surrender or die . The deterioration of U.N. and NATO authority in the Balkans has been gradual but steady , starting with the proclamation of a &quot; no-fly &quot; zone over Bosnia more_than two years ago that is violated almost daily . The alliances ' lack of respect accelerated with the non-enforcement of other so-called safe areas in eastern Bosnia , and more recently with the failure to enforce weapons exclusion zones around Gorazde and Sarajevo . Four Serbian planes caught_on a Feb . 28 bombing_run in central Bosnia were shot down by NATO in the only enforcement action of the flight ban , and several pinprick air strikes have been launched against antiquated artillery in the two exclusion zones . But Serbian nationalist rebels who have been the targets of the few punitive NATO actions have concluded that neither the U.N. mission nor the military hierarchies making_up NATO have any intention of getting any more deeply or effectively involved . &quot; The Serbs know now that the price for shooting at U.N. troops or at U.N. planes is that they lose a rusted , 40-year-old gun or a derelict tank , &quot; said a Western diplomat in this Croatian capital . &quot; that ' s not likely to constitute much of a deterrent. &quot; Compounding the U.N. mission ' s lack of credibility with any of the warring factions is the piecemeal approach to negotiating local cease-fires that has taken precedence over a comprehensive strategy for combatting the aggressive nationalism at the root of the regional conflict . The mission is also hampered by the revolving door of administrative leaders and commanders , with virtually none of the major players having more_than a year of familiarity with the complex region that began its slide toward violent confrontation in the late 1980s . There is little recognition among the mission leaders or their legion of information officers of the deja_vu quality of the Bihac crisis , a carbon_copy of the humiliating contest of wills the U.N. peacekeeping force lost to Serbian rebels in Gorazde in April . In both deadly Serbian offensives , the U.N. commander for Bosnia , British Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , disputed the significance of the safe-area violations , then blamed the Bosnian government for spurring the attacks by trying to recover homes and territory lost to the Serbs at the start of the war . When diplomatic appeals for respect of the safe areas were ignored by the advancing gunmen , U.N. officials claimed they were unsure exactly what territory was to be protected . Even after the mission succeeded in shrinking the area of its responsibility to the immediate vicinity of Bihac city -- encompassing only 32 square_miles of the 800-square-mile &quot; Bihac pocket &quot; -- moves to enhance security for the embattled populations were slowed by the arthritic bureaucracies of both NATO and the United Nations . Serbian rebels had already conquered one-third of the Bihac safe area by Saturday and were threatening a rout of the entire haven , yet the United Nations had still not acted_on NATO recommendations that the area be declared a demilitarized zone . The U.N. mission has been assuring the international community that neutrality continues to be the best of its few bad choices for influencing the Balkan conflict . And the outside world ' s reluctance to consider the alternative to a failed peacekeeping mission -- military intervention -- bolsters the U.N. hierarchy ' s determination to keep its fig_leaf in place over the unraveling Balkans .</TEXT>
