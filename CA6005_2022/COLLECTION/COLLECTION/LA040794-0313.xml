   <HEADLINE> AMES MAY AID PROBE IF WIFE IS GIVEN LENIENCY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With the CIA and FBI determined to learn whether Aldrich H . Ames had confederates inside the intelligence agency , the accused spy is showing his first willingness to cooperate with investigators -- but only if they recommend leniency for his wife , The Times learned Wednesday . Ames has virtually no chance of negotiating leniency for himself , however , considering the damage investigators believe the 31-year CIA veteran caused to American intelligence interests and his possible complicity in the deaths of U.S. intelligence operatives in Russia . Ames , 52 , and his Colombian-born wife , Rosario , 41 , were arrested on espionage conspiracy charges on Feb . 21 . The deadline for a grand_jury indictment , typically 30 days after an arrest , was extended an additional 30 days to give defense_attorneys time to examine the voluminous documents recovered by the FBI in searches of Ames ' home and CIA office . Ames allegedly was paid at least $ 2.5 million by the Soviets and later the Russians to spy for them since 1985 -- an amount that the FBI has characterized as extraordinary in intelligence circles . Prosecutors are intent_on putting Ames in prison for life , according to sources close to the case . But the prospect of a possible deal for Mrs . Ames is more complicated . She has been suffering emotional distress since her incarceration , a factor said to be adding_to Ames ' desire to strike a deal for her . Sources said that she is being seen by a Washington psychologist , whose employment was approved Monday by U.S. District Judge Claude M . Hilton . Hilton sealed the motion seeking appointment of the psychologist , A . John Kalil . In a brief interview , Kalil acknowledged that he has been assigned to assess Mrs . Ames ' condition . Asked whether her distress was related to her 5-year-old son , Paul , who was sent to Colombia to stay with his maternal grandmother , Kalil said : &quot; In a sense , it is. &quot; But he declined to elaborate , saying that he was &quot; not at_liberty to discuss &quot; his assignment and was &quot; reticent to even converse &quot; about the subject . Government officials must weigh whether they can justify allowing Mrs . Ames to go free after some period of imprisonment if , in return , they obtain Ames ' firsthand insight into who else in the CIA -- if anyone -- may have helped him carry_out the alleged espionage and the degree to which it may have compromised some still-existing intelligence_operations overseas . Ames ' cooperation would help intelligence officials conduct a detailed damage assessment , which they regard_as critical . A plea agreement with Ames also would avoid a public trial that could expose U.S. intelligence sources and methods . Plato Cacheris , Ames ' attorney , declined comment on any discussions with U.S. officials . He said that he is &quot; tooling up &quot; to try the case in court because &quot; there are a lot of challenging legal issues here. &quot; Some of these issues could complicate the government ' s effort to bring Ames to trial , legal sources said . Among them , Cacheris said , was the use of a search_warrant against Ames before his arrest . It was authorized by Atty . Gen . Janet Reno , who bypassed normal federal_court approval for such a warrant and depended instead on the authority of an executive order on national security that dates_from the Ronald Reagan_Administration . This authority has not been tested in court . Other legal questions have arisen , he said , over the FBI ' s seizure of documents in Ames ' personal_computer . The seizure was carried_out under the authorization of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which permits surveillance of electronic_communications . But Ames is likely to contend that he was only storing the material in his home computer and did not electronically send it anywhere , thus not actually communicating with anyone . Government officials revealed in court last month that they had found more_than 100 classified CIA cables on computer diskettes in the Ameses ' house , a violation of agency regulations against keeping such material at_home . Because much of the material was outside Ames ' jurisdiction at the CIA , officials want his cooperation in determining how he obtained it and who , if anyone , among his colleagues helped him . The agency prides itself on &quot; compartmentation , &quot; or granting access to information to employees on a need-to-know basis . The apparent breakdown in security procedures -- and the effort to determine who was responsible -- is the subject of an independent inquiry by the CIA ' s inspector_general , Frederick Hitz . The question of whether to recommend leniency for Mrs . Ames could be influenced by evidence indicating that she was a driving force in persuading her husband to participate in espionage . According to court records , telephone_conversations overheard by the FBI include one in which she cautioned him against carelessness in carrying sensitive documents or cash , apparently from his Russian handlers , in suitcases that he was checking as airline baggage . In another , she berated him , allegedly for failing to leave a timely signal for the Russians , saying : &quot; Well , honey , I hope you didn ' t screw up. &quot; FBI officials have said in court that after her arrest , Mrs . Ames volunteered a series of damaging statements about her husband ' s receipt of millions of dollars from Russia . But they said she stopped cooperating after she was given a court-appointed lawyer . Her attorney , William E . Cummings , did not return telephone_calls Wednesday . But previously he attacked the accuracy of FBI wiretap excerpts depicting her as an active participant in a conspiracy . Justice_Department officials declined comment on the case . Both defendants could benefit by agreeing to guilty pleas before the grand_jury returns an indictment . Under the federal sentencing guidelines , judges can take into consideration all counts with which a defendant is charged . A plea bargain before indictment could permit the defendants to plead guilty to less-sweeping charges .</TEXT>
