   <HEADLINE> DEBATE OVER PROP . 187</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Prop . 187 Is Sore Subject for Illegal Immigrant Students &quot; ( Sept . 17 ) hits the nail right on the head . If for no other reason , Prop . 187 must be defeated for the scholastic assassinations it would inflict on innocent children of undocumented residents and the disruption that would ensue in the education of our youth . The U.S. Supreme Court has firmly established that laws denying education to classes of children in the U.S. are unequivocally unconstitutional . California has severe problems , to be sure , but to enact racist , xenophobic and misdirected legislation as a political remedy will never serve this state . Prop . 187 would turn teachers and health-care providers into secret_police , forcing them to look_at a child ' s skin_color and accent , instead of looking_into the mind . No less cruel , Prop . 187 would force innocent children to learn to lie_in order to protect their family ' s existence . CLARK D . LEDGER San Diego * The Times writers who wrote this article know very well that the students they interviewed will have graduated and presumably illegally obtained jobs by the time Prop . 187 is resolved in court , should it pass . It is the as-yet-unarrived illegal immigrant students who may_not get a free education . There is no doubt that the provisions in Prop . 187 will cause hardship to illegal aliens . That is its intent . It is hoped that it is the first of many propositions that will make life much , much harder for them , thereby discouraging others . Prop . 187 may_not be humane or generous . The humane and generous policies of past decades didn ' t work . MICHAEL GREENWALD San Diego * All I had to do was read the photo caption , &quot; Belmont High_School , with about 2 # 000 illegal immigrant students , could be hard-hit by Proposition 187 , &quot; to realize that Prop . 187 must pass . REID CAMPBELL Culver City * Regarding the commentary &quot; Make_it ' SOS ' for Snake-Oil Salesmen &quot; by Carl Shusterman ( Commentary , Sept . 15 ) : I am again baffled by the argument that immigration laws should be enforced by sanctions against private employers spending their own money to hire workers without adequately investigating their immigration status , while government employees spending taxpayers ' money should be free from this burden . If we expect private citizens to enforce the immigration laws by verifying legal residence before hiring people , why shouldn ' t our government exercise the same diligence when dispensing taxpayer supported services ? JOSEPH AREEDA Los Angeles * Consider the following : ( 1 ) The district is forced to hire special teachers ( ESL ) to teach the non-English speaking illegal immigrants ; ( 2 ) Each one of these students may qualify for free or reduced price meals while at school ; ( 3 ) The tax money used to pay_for all this must come from somewhere . Any wild guesses ? ( 4 ) With all_the emphasis given to these &quot; non-English speaking students , &quot; what about the concern for the remaining students ? FRANK P . LEWIS Diamond Bar * As the first-generation son of immigrant parents , with four children in the LAUSD , I was deeply disturbed in reading James Coleman ' s commentary , &quot; Illegal Immigrants Are , by Definition , Criminals &quot; ( Sept . 12 ) . For him to relegate a whole segment of the children , whom he is responsible_for in some official of semiofficial capacity , to the category of the &quot; criminal class &quot; was itself criminal . Are those who have helped dig a financial hole for the school district now looking_for a scapegoat ? He seemed to be keen with his selective use of historical analogies , but he forgets that the Nazis of the ' 30s used Jews , leftists and homosexuals as the reason for Germany ' s economic weakness during the world Depression , much like their modern brethren use the Turkish immigrants as scapegoats for the shrinking German bounty . He calls any historical claim to the Southwest territories as counterproductive , citing that &quot; humanity has seen the ownership of land change hands countless times , &quot; yet forgets that humanity has historically migrated from country to country , continent to continent . &quot; Criminal &quot; is the new code word for &quot; those who are expendable. &quot; Why should &quot; criminals &quot; receive emergency health_care allowing more &quot; criminals &quot; to be born in our country ? Why give these young &quot; criminals &quot; an education ? Why should real Americans feed these &quot; criminals &quot; by letting them work ? With the use of this one word Coleman tried to strip a whole group of people of their humanity , but it seems he only succeeded in exposing his own moral and political decay .
