   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : YOUTH OPINION ; COMPUTERS ' OPEN A WHOLE NEW_WORLD '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More and more young people -- as well as adults -- are communicating by computer . This is happening at_home , in the workplace and at school . Will it have a negative affect on interpersonal relationships ? We asked some young computer &quot; nerds &quot; to comment . HIROMI HASEGAWA Senior , cognitive_science major , Occidental College I spend eight or nine hours every day on the computer and I don ' t really know much about computers . The computer is part of my life ; it ' s really crucial to me . Pretty much all my friends at this point I got_to know through IRC ( Internet Relay Chat ) , e-mail and &quot; news groups &quot; ( Internet computer bulletin_boards ) . I have a computer in my room and when I ' m done with classes , I come_back here and sign_on . To be honest , I am not really outgoing on campus . I don ' t really talk to a lot of people . I spend so_much time on the net . People log_on , they talk . Every night is like going_to a party . From the normal definition , I ' d say I ' m being cut_off from people . But Internet has expanded my horizons so_much . I ' ve gotten_to know other people I couldn ' t have met otherwise . School is such a small place . With Internet , ( a worldwide computer_network ) you can reach far out into the world . VIRAPHOL CHAIYAKUL Graduate_student , computer_science , UC Irvine I got interested in computers about 10 years ago , when I was 17 , because I thought with computer knowledge that I could get a better job . Now I can ' t stop using it ! I probably spend about eight to 12 hours a day on the computer . There are so many things to do with computers . You can play interactive games , talk to people , even check on the news . A lot of people don ' t read newspapers anymore because they can get their news from a network . For example , I ' m always interested in what is going_on in Thailand . The newspaper doesn ' t carry stories about Thailand every day but I can always find_out what ' s happening there through Internet . I do have a normal social life , though , and don ' t think I ' m missing out because I spend so_much time on the computer . STEWART STREMLER Senior , computer_science , San Diego State I generally spend a_couple_of hours a day on the computer . It varies , but there are times I ' ll spend six hours a day for a week straight . It annoys my wife because when I ' m on the computer I tune out the rest of the world , including her . I try not to come_home and jump_on the computer first thing . When I moved_out here I didn ' t know anybody . So I called around to a_few of the bulletin_boards . I eventually met some of the people I was talking to . They became my first friends . Some of us eventually got_together for pizza and it ' s become a semi-regular occurrence . ROGER ANG Graduate_student , computer_science , UC Irvine I spend eight to 10 hours a day on the computer and I ' ve developed some relationships that are basically electronic . I ' ve gotten_to know people , without meeting face-to-face , from a wide geographic_area . Actually , networking with computers is just a different method of social interaction . The network is a different world and people develop a different personality when they ' re on the network . It ' s kind of subtle . Even I think I have a different personality when I ' m on the network . You become a little more opinionated . This is just a different form of communication . For example , the best_man at my wedding graduated from school and went_to work for a defense_contractor . He wasn ' t into e-mail as much there . Then he came_back to graduate_school and now we send each other e-mail all_the time . We ' re in contact more now and we know more about each other ' s lives . CHARLES JORDON Senior , cognitive_science , Occidental College I became interested in computers in the fourth grade , when my parents brought_home a Texas Instruments 99-4A . The company had stopped making that type of computer and they paid $ 50 for it . I took_out a book on BASIC and figured it out_in two days . By the fifth and sixth grade , I was tutoring younger kids . There was no doubt that I would go_into computers . I spend a good portion of my time , at least four to six hours a day , on the computer . Part of that is because I have a full-time job as a computer software salesperson . You have your computer and it seems like a little block on a desk . When you hook_up to a local bulletin_board or talk to someone in Germany or Sweden , it makes the computer seem global or bigger than it is . ALISE PINTO DUARTE Senior , computer_science , UC Irvine I met my husband in a computer_science class . People walk into our apartment , though , and they think we ' re nerds because we have two computers in our living room . My husband and I do communicate a lot through the computer . If I call home and the line is busy , I just log_on and message him . I think computers can have a positive effect on communications . They open a whole new_world for people to interact .</TEXT>
