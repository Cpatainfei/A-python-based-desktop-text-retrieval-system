   <TEXT> As the U.S. struggles with its military strategies to deal with the rogue nations that are now capable of nuclear terrorism ( &quot; Nuclear Dominoes , &quot; May 8 , 9 , 10 ) it ' s time to recognize our failed strategies that brought us to this point in the first place . The facts of history have proven that the aerial tanker for in-flight refueling is the single greatest technology in aviation today . The global reach , global power , go-anywhere capability of the modern Air_Force is the direct result of tankers . This technology was proposed in 1943 as a means to bomb a then-unreachable Japan . Luddites in the Air_Force , comfortably seated in their armchairs overlooking the Potomac , could not see the potential in this technology and turned it down for the then-rapidly failing strategy of daylight formation bombing in the Pacific . Had the Air_Force accepted tankers and in-flight refueling , when proposed , and had long-range single airplane nighttime bombing , so successful late in the war , been introduced in 1943 , Japan ' s surrender would have occurred long before the introduction of the atomic_bomb that brought the Soviets rushing to our &quot; aid. &quot; The costly ( 100 # 000 casualties ) march up through the Central Pacific for the sole purpose of obtaining airfields closer to Japan could have been avoided . Our present nightmare in the North Pacific is a direct result of the Air_Force ' s reluctance to change its strategy and allowing the Soviets to claim hegemony over North_Korea and the Kurils after only five days of &quot; fighting &quot; on our side . WILLIAM J . SPELLISCY Orange The strategic missile submarine was a major contributor to winning the Cold_War . Since 1960 , our 41 Polaris ballistic_missile submarines have made literally thousands of deterrent patrols . The SSBN ( Submarine Ballistic Nuclear ) is the most complicated machine ever made by mankind and yet one of the most effective , both militarily and economically . All 41 older Polaris-type missile submarines will be retired by the end of this year and just our Trident submarines will remain ; 14 of the 18 authorized have been commissioned . The Trident carries 24 missiles , whereas the Polaris carried only 16 missiles . Each Trident has the capacity to launch and deliver a staggering 240 warheads . A weapon_system of such awesome power will definitely make an adversary think_twice before nuking the United States . The SSBN continues to play a vital role in maintaining a stabilized nuclear deterrence against present and future threats to U.S. security . Incidentally , the U.S. will have 50-55 nuclear attack_submarines on_duty by the end of the decade -- not 18 attack_submarines as noted in the May 10 article . We will have 18 Trident strategic missile submarines . DAVID D . SEMRAU Naval Submarine League Mission Viejo Thirty-one billion dollars for &quot; strategic nuclear_weapons , &quot; this year ' s welfare for the Defense_Department , is only one aspect of America ' s insidious investment in nuclear_weapons . But The Times goes_on to report , &quot; To be sure , no one is advocating that the U.S. nuclear arsenal be scrapped &quot; ( May 10 ) . What part of &quot; No Nukes &quot; don ' t you understand ?
