   <HEADLINE> POLITICAL BRIEFING : DIAMOND ' S REFORM PROVES NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> ANY REGRETS ? : Back in 1972 , when Roger Jon Diamond last ran_for state Assembly , the Santa Monica attorney went_to court to challenge California ' s system of ranking candidates on the printed ballot . Diamond felt it unfair that the incumbent was listed first and that other candidates followed in alphabetical order . Being_on top of the list gave the incumbent an advantage that translated into extra votes , Diamond contended . In fact , Diamond lost that election to then-GOP incumbent Assemblyman Paul Priolo , whose name was listed above his Democratic opponent ' s on the ballot . Diamond took his beef all_the way to the California Supreme Court -- and won , forcing the secretary_of_state ' s office to discard the old system and come_up with a random method of listing the candidates . Hence , the secretary_of_state ' s office dreamed_up a way to reinvent the alphabet each election cycle . Officials now randomly draw letters and the candidate whose name starts with the first letter picked gets_to appear at the top of the ballot . On Thursday , Diamond became a victim of_his_own success . Now a candidate for the 41st District Assembly seat being vacated by Assemblyman Terry Friedman ( D-Brentwood ) , he flew to Sacramento to attend the secretary_of_state ' s drawing . Lo and behold , the letter D did not fare well in the pickings . Had he left well enough alone , Diamond would have ranked first in a simple alphabetical listing of the six candidates running_for the seat . ( There ' s no incumbent. ) Instead , as a result of his pleadings before the Supreme Court , he came_up last . &quot; I went from the top to the bottom -- on my own case . It ' s ironic , &quot; Diamond noted . * MOUNTAIN_MAN : Rich Sybert protests that he ' s only being a conscientious member of the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy . But others , including the office of U.S. Rep . Anthony C . Beilenson ( D-Woodland Hills ) , have suspected that Sybert has concocted a taxpayer-funded dog-and-pony show to advance his plan to oust Beilenson from office . Here ' s the situation . Sybert is running in the GOP primary and aiming for Beilenson ' s seat , and he sits as Gov . Pete Wilson ' s appointee on the 10-member governing board of the conservancy . Recently , Sybert , the president of a toy-design firm , has asked the parks agency staff to organize , publicize and pay_for seven public hearings to be held throughout the west San Fernando and Conejo valleys . Sybert would preside over these hearings , which would be held_on top of the conservancy ' s normal bimonthly meetings . The purported purpose of the meetings would be to give Sybert -- who only recently moved to Woodland Hills from Pasadena -- a chance to educate himself by soliciting the public ' s views about the conservancy and its work . Parks agency staff_members say such one-man hearings are apparently unprecedented . Nor did the uniqueness of the hearings escape the attention of Susan Little , Beilenson ' s environmental deputy . Little said she called conservancy staff to inquire about the hearings in part because , she said , there was a political concern . &quot; He ' s playing a role there that we ' re keeping somewhat of an eye on , &quot; Little said . After reviewing the_matter with conservancy officials , Little concluded that &quot; it sounded legitimate ( but ) it was curious that ( the hearings ) were being held outside the well-attended bimonthly conservancy meetings. &quot; Laura Plotkin , conservancy press secretary , said the agency ' s staff had been warned to be &quot; very careful &quot; that the meetings not be turned_into political events . &quot; It was all on the up and up , &quot; said Plotkin , offering her view of the first meeting , held_in Calabasas this week . Besides , only nine people showed_up at the Calabasas confab . Meanwhile , the campaign manager of another Republican primary candidate said he saw the whole_thing as a transparent attempt to use a public agency to gain free exposure for Sybert ' s candidacy . &quot; I ' m surprised the parks agency would allow itself to be used this way . I assumed it was more nonpartisan , &quot; said Chris Carter , who runs the campaign of Mark Boos Benhard , a Conejo Valley businessman who was previously an aide to former U.S. Rep . William Dannemeyer . Those questioning his motives are just &quot; cynics , &quot; said Sybert , who was a former Cabinet-level official in the Wilson Administration . His intent is only to educate himself , he said , on conservancy issues . &quot; I ' m actually taking time_out from the campaign so I can do a better job on the conservancy , &quot; he said . * JOINING FORCES : Al Dib , community activist , retired green grocer and perennial candidate , said this week that he has hired the controversial Manny Fernandez to run his campaign to recall state Sen . David Roberti ( D-Van Nuys ) . Dib is one of five candidates seeking to oust Roberti in the April 12 vote . Fernandez was purged from the group that organized the recall because of his flamboyant and embarrassing statements . The most notable of these was his claim that the recall was nothing less than a bid by the gun lobby to avenge itself for Roberti ' s authorship of the state ' s 1989 ban on military-style semiautomatic weapons . It was , to say the least , a quote made in heaven for Roberti , who is trying to rally the gun-control movement behind his cause . The leaders of the Coalition to Restore Governmental Integrity , the group that officially sponsored the recall , also have bristled_at Fernandez ' s boast that the recall movement is really his creature . In any event , the desire to distance itself from Fernandez reached the point where the coalition finally issued a press_release effectively announcing its estrangement from Fernandez . But Fernandez now has surfaced as Dib ' s top campaign adviser . &quot; He just called and said he thought I could win , so I ' m running , &quot; said Dib , who has run four times in 20 years for Los Angeles City_Council seats . In 1989 , he came_in third running against then-Councilman Ernani Bernardi . One of the inducements Fernandez offered him to run was the endorsement of the National Rifle Assn. , Dib said . &quot; This is what he promised. &quot; Has Fernandez delivered ? Not yet , Dib said . Fernandez , on the other hand , denies that he gave Dib any reason to believe that if he ran , the NRA would get involved . &quot; I couldn ' t in good_faith make such a promise because I ' m not an agent for the National Rifle Assn. , &quot; Fernandez said recently . Despite Fernandez ' s colorful history of involvement in gun issues , including a 1983 guilty plea to possession of a machine_gun , Dib claims that his candidacy is not gun-driven . &quot; I wish everyone would stop talking_about guns , &quot; Dib said . * TEAM EFFORT : In pursuit of federal earthquake-relief funds , various Valley business groups have joined forces to form the nonprofit Regional Economic Development Council of the San Fernando Valley to help rebuild the area ' s fractured economy . The United Chambers_of_Commerce , the Valley Industry &amp; Commerce Assn . and the Valley Economic Development Center Inc. got_behind this venture at the recommendation of U.S. Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown . They have proposed a detailed program to retain and expand businesses in the wake of the Jan . 17 temblor as well as attract and establish new enterprises . The proponents hope to win some of the earthquake contingency funds that Commerce is seeking through its Economic Development Administration . The earthquake aid bill passed_by Congress contained $ 550 million to be dispensed at the discretion of President Clinton . In the first $ 90.8 million released Thursday , Commerce received $ 5 million to assist municipalities in developing long-term economic development plans . Commerce is seeking as much as $ 200 million in such funds but is competing against other federal_government agencies . The EDA funds cannot go directly to businesses but must be channeled through nonprofit vehicles . The Valley coalition is one of many groups in Los Angeles and Ventura counties that have been asked to submit a comprehensive economic plan . It emphasizes the need to aid quake-damaged businesses that may_not qualify for the usual government loan programs because they had already accumulated significant debt due_to the economic downturn . &quot; We could lose a lot of good , high-paying jobs and see further decline , &quot; said Benjamin Reznik , an Encino attorney and immediate past chairman of VICA . &quot; We are making the pitch that we are the most important ( applicant ) and we ' re putting_together a more innovative program. &quot; A Commerce official said that the department is particularly interested in combining earthquake aid with creating new jobs through defense conversion . He said that this linkage could benefit the San Fernando Valley . &quot; The Valley , which is the epicenter of the earthquake , is also the epicenter of defense conversion because so many of the businesses in that area are defense-dependent , &quot; the official said . &quot; We see this as an opportunity to begin the recovery phase and begin the transition. &quot;</TEXT>
