   <HEADLINE> NATURAL WONDER ; AT HEART , EDWARD WILSON ' S AN ANT MAN . BUT IT ' S HIS THEORIES ON HUMAN BEHAVIOR THAT STIR_UP TROUBLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a boy in Alabama , Edward O . Wilson hated fistfights . But he never ran from a scrap . Beaten and bloody , he wore his scars with pride . Lord knows he tried to ignore the bullies who taunted him . Yet the ritual of fighting to prove himself seemed to haunt him wherever he went . &quot; Perfect training for a scientist , &quot; quips Wilson . &quot; It ' s especially good if you travel a lot in strange territories like I have . When you take_on foreign tribes , there ' s trouble. &quot; Today , the kid who came_home black-and-blue is one of the world ' s premier biologists and a Pulitzer Prize-winning author . More comfortable in front of a microscope than a microphone , he ' s been drawn into one nasty controversy after another during a 43-year career at Harvard_University , much of it spent on the cutting edge of scientific thought . Wilson is the world ' s leading authority on ants , yet he ' s gained more attention for his work in sociobiology -- the genetic and evolutionary roots of animal behavior -- and for his support of biodiversity in tropical_rain_forests . A reluctant warrior in wingtip shoes , he ' s a hero to many but a perennial target for critics , who call him everything from a Nazi to a knee-jerk liberal . Long before the current debate over race , genetics and intelligence , Wilson sparked an uproar by suggesting that biology shapes human traits , ranging from the sexual division of labor and religion to love and aggression . While many of his conclusions are now mainstream , he ' s been blasted by colleagues , heckled by demonstrators and had water dumped on his head in a public forum . Such loathing is hard to imagine when you first meet Wilson in his quiet campus laboratory . In one corner , a collection of Central_American ants scurry back and forth , carrying leaves to a makeshift colony . Across the room , a wall of awards , photos and certificates reflect the man ' s achievements . And then there ' s Wilson himself : A tall , retiring fellow whose long , bony fingers look_like chromosomes . Dressed in an Oxford shirt , rumpled tweed sport coat and dark gray slacks , he ' s the scientist from Central Casting , hardly the kind to ignite controversy . Yet appearances are deceiving . &quot; This man is a landmark in science , a pioneer in the areas he ' s explored , &quot; says Paul Ehrlich , a population biologist at Stanford_University . &quot; Ed doesn ' t seek_out conflicts , but he ' s paid a price for his courage. &quot; Wilson tells the story in &quot; Naturalist &quot; ( Island Press ) , a newly published autobiography . It ' s an eye-opening memoir of intellectual growth , showing how he evolved from a reclusive boy hooked on bugs into a scientist who ' s duked it out on the world stage . For those who shun science writing , Wilson ' s vivid prose can be a revelation . He ' s long had the knack of making complex biology seem relevant to a general audience , and students rate him one of Harvard ' s top lecturers . He displays the same skills in his latest book . Listen to him dissect an egotistical colleague : &quot; He was friendly indeed , but supremely self-possessed and theatrically condescending . On the few occasions we spoke , I could not escape the feeling that he was actually addressing an audience of hundreds seated behind me . At the height of the campus turmoil at Harvard and elsewhere ( he ) was the speaker of choice . . . the kind of elegant , unworldly intellectual who fires_up the revolution and is the first to receive its executioner ' s bullet. &quot; Academic warfare fills the book , and Wilson loves to filter it through a biological lens . Look_for the roots of human behavior in the past , he says , whether you go_back 50 years or 50 million years . His boyhood fights and faculty clashes may seem anecdotal , but aren ' t we really talking_about Paleolithic man , male initiation rites and tribal warfare ? &quot; I can ' t help but look_at the world this way , because the past always repeats itself , &quot; Wilson says with a grin . &quot; We all fight battles , but the roots are buried deep in our biological past . . . deep in our genetic makeup. &quot; Think you understand sports and politics ? Think again . &quot; If we didn ' t have this deep biological drive to root on warring groups , we would n ' t have million-dollar baseball_players , &quot; Wilson suggests . &quot; Or multimillion-dollar Senate_races where victory parties look_like V-E day. &quot; As for O.J. Simpson , Wilson says those who have rushed to prejudge the defendant are re-enacting an evolutionary drama much older than tabloid TV . &quot; We find here one of the most basic conflicts in ( prehistoric ) society , which is ownership of the female , &quot; he ventures . &quot; There are truly dire conflicts when the female struggles to break_away or is claimed by another male. &quot; * A vigorous 66 , Wilson has spent decades studying ants , and he was one of the first to discover that the insects communicate with each other by secreting chemical trails . His path-breaking research has also shown evolutionary links between ant behavior and mammals , including human_beings . The pursuit of these links led Wilson to sociobiology and , with it , the controversy that has dogged him much of his career . He ' s also been attacked for his views on species extinction . Based on intensive research and mathematical projections , Wilson suggests that more_than 20 % of all species could become extinct by 2010 if mankind continues to destroy ecological systems in the rain_forests and elsewhere . If the pace of destruction continues , he adds , the toll could rise to 50 % within 60 years . That projection is accepted by many biologists , and Wilson has written widely on the subject . But lately a political backlash has developed against his call to arms . Where ' s the proof of such extinction ? some critics ask . &quot; It is such a sweeping generalization , &quot; wrote journalist Stephen Budiansky in U.S. News and World Report last year . &quot; Yet the political climate has made_it difficult for scientists to challenge the more politically correct view of Wilson. &quot; Privately , some colleagues grumble at Wilson ' s ability to command media attention . But the spotlight isn ' t always flattering . In 1978 , left-wing demonstrators opposed to his sociobiological theories shouted him down at a crowded Washington , D.C. , forum . Then they dumped ice_water on his head . &quot; Most_unpleasant , most disagreeable , &quot; says the biologist , sipping a cup of coffee in his office . &quot; I never wanted any of this conflict. &quot; Just don ' t cross him . Wilson can be courteous to a fault , but he rarely forgets an insult . In his book , he offers a crash course in the viciousness of Harvard politics , and lavishes strong but ironic praise on his enemies . &quot; My critics served me well , &quot; Wilson says . &quot; They forced me to make myself intellectually tough and to make_sure I had the facts to support my work. &quot; Running his fingers through a thatch of thinning hair , Wilson leans forward and smiles . Always look_to the past , he says . The playground bullies of his youth didn ' t wear lab coats or pin-stripe suits -- but they played the same role . * Born in Birmingham , Wilson stood_out from the other kids in one key respect : He never outgrew his bug phase . &quot; Sonny , &quot; as he was called , loved the creatures that filled the forests and streams of sub-tropical Alabama . Looking_back , he chalks_up his insect love to family upheaval . His parents divorced when he was 7 , and Wilson ' s father moved from one job to another . Attending 16 schools during his first 12 years of public education , it was hard to make lasting friends , he recalls , but animals were always there . Wilson says he was shaped by three American institutions . Southern Baptism gave him an unflagging faith in good works . Military school , which he briefly attended , imbued him with an old-fashioned sense of manliness . And the Boy_Scouts , which he adored , left him with respect for honor and courtesy . &quot; Let ' s see you do_better in 54 words or less , &quot; he says , reciting the Boy_Scout oath . &quot; I drank_in and accepted every word . Still do , as ridiculous as that may seem to my colleagues in the intellectual trade. &quot; Wilson ' s love of insects grew , and mentors at the University of Tennessee steered him to Harvard , with its world-class ant collection . He was accepted in 1951 and has been there since . Currently , he ' s Pelligrino University Professor and curator in entomology at the Museum of Comparative Zoology . He married Irene Kelley , a poet , in 1955 , and the couple had a daughter , Catherine , in 1963 . Notoriously private , Wilson says little about his family life in &quot; The Naturalist. &quot; But the book contains painful disclosures . Just before Wilson began his doctoral studies , his alcoholic father committed suicide . Crushed with grief then , the author now sees it as a turning point . Suddenly , he was free to pursue his calling without family distractions . &quot; There are times when suicide liberates , and I ' m sure that ' s happened to quite a_few people , whether they admit it or not , &quot; Wilson says . &quot; I guess you reach a certain point in life when you can admit that . For me , it ' s time. &quot; * Wilson ' s early work focused_on evolutionary biology , the study of how animals change_over time . His first crisis erupted in the mid ' 50s , when James Watson -- an influential Harvard scientist who would later win the Nobel Prize for his role in discovering DNA -- accused Wilson and other faculty biologists of pursuing obsolete studies . At one point , it seemed they might lose their jobs . Although he survived the scare , Wilson was challenged as never before . Now a tenured professor , he began exploring sociobiology during a 1956 trip to Puerto Rico . Observing rhesus_monkeys , he wondered how ant and primate societies might be compared , as part of a larger theory of animal behavior . Years of intense study led to a second crisis , with the 1975 publication of his &quot; Sociobiology &quot; ( Harvard-Belknap ) . In the controversial book , Wilson probed the genetic roots of all animal behavior , including human_beings . Most of its findings , dealing with lower forms of life , won praise . But Wilson set_off alarms when he suggested that biology shapes human nature as well . Although he won a National Medal of Science in 1977 , criticism was fierce and some faculty_members shunned him . Indeed , his opponents insisted that culture is more influential in determining human nature . In 1975 , anthropology professor Stephen Jay Gould and 15 other colleagues wrote a blistering letter about Wilson to the New York Review of Books , saying he provided a &quot; genetic justification of the status_quo and of existing privileges for certain groups according to class , race or sex. &quot; These arguments , they said , led to the rise of Adolf Hitler . &quot; I had no interest in ideology , &quot; Wilson says , &quot; yet I had to fight_back . I felt keenly betrayed , because my colleagues were politicizing science. &quot; Twenty years later , many of Wilson ' s conclusions have been accepted as mainstream . He has since clarified his theories to argue that human behavior is a product of cultural and genetic evolution . The great challenge facing science , he says , is to probe the way those two influences interact . Meanwhile , he ' s received numerous honors , winning the 1979 Pulitzer Prize for &quot; On Human Nature &quot; ( Harvard ) , a response to sociobiology critics , and the 1991 Pulitzer Prize for &quot; The Ants &quot; ( Harvard ) , a 700-page opus written with Bert Holldobler . Yet memories of his bitter conflicts have eased only slightly . The day he was doused with ice_water &quot; may be the only occasion in recent American history on which a scientist was physically attacked , however mildly , for the expression of an idea , &quot; he writes . &quot; How could an entomologist with a penchant for solitude provoke a tumult of this proportion ? &quot; * The answer is politics . Once a scientist speaks out , Wilson suggests , the niceties of academic discourse and professional courtesy can quickly disappear . His experience with the biodiversity crisis is a good_example . Wilson couldn ' t help but notice the inexorable destruction of tropical_rain_forests during research trips he took_to Asia and Latin_America as far back as 1956 . Urban sprawl , pesticides and overpopulation were wiping_out the precious habitats , and it wasn ' t simply an aesthetic problem . Rain_forests contain more flora and fauna than any other part of the world , he notes . They ' re a gold mine of medicines , such_as cyclosporin -- a valuable immune-suppressant that comes from a fungus -- and taxol , a drug from the Pacific_yew that ' s used to treat cancer . More miracle drugs are waiting to be discovered , yet as the rain_forests shrink , these resources are threatened . &quot; What we need is a citizens ' wake-up call_for the planet , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s a genuine emergency . Nothing should distract us from this task. &quot; But politics intervene . Along with other biologists , Wilson testified before Congress , urging passage of an expanded Endangered Species Act to protect entire ecosystems , not just individual animals . He also pushed for congressional ratification of the 1992 Rio Pact on Biodiversity . Both measures are currently blocked by Washington gridlock , however , and Wilson has been attacked for his efforts . The notion that he has exaggerated the rate of species extinction in shrinking rain_forests exasperates him . &quot; These are not smart criticisms , &quot; he says tartly . &quot; They ' re absurd. &quot; Reciting what he calls an ironclad law of ecology , Wilson says the more you reduce the area in which a species lives , the more its numbers will decline . He cites evidence from studies in the Philippines , Madagascar , Brazil , Florida and the forests of the eastern United States to prove his point . And then . . . weary of the debate , drained by the endless back and forth , Edward O . Wilson stretches his long legs and allows a smile to cross his face . It ' s late in the afternoon , and an autumn chill settles_on the campus outside . &quot; Some people may find it odd , but I never forgot the upbeat attitudes of the Southern Baptist experience , &quot; he says . &quot; And that really comforts me . It ' s a rock , especially when you deal with all these conflicts. &quot; Has the ant-chasing biologist found God in his twilight years ? &quot; I would n ' t phrase it that way , &quot; Wilson says . &quot; But Southern Baptism is a good-news faith , and I always try to stress the positive in science . So sure , put me down as a good news secular humanist . Let the word go forth. &quot; * In a packed lecture hall , he spreads the word . Here , biodiversity is more_than an abstract concept . Dimming the lights , Wilson shows students a dramatic slide -- a nighttime photo of Earth taken by satellites -- and points_out eerie flames stretching across the Equator , across Latin_America and Asia . They ' re fires burning_out of control in the rain_forests on any given evening . It ' s a disturbing sight , yet Wilson says there is still time to save the planet . On another morning , he compares human_beings to ants . Consider man ' s selfishness and ambition versus the insects ' drive to help their community . They ' ll sacrifice their lives for the common_good , if need be . Biology doesn ' t get more basic than this , and Wilson ends the lesson amid gales of laughter by raising the subject of Marxism . Why did_it fail ? &quot; Good ideology , &quot; he says dryly . &quot; Wrong species. &quot;</TEXT>
