   <HEADLINE> HISTORY WATCH ; SUGIHARA ' S LIST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In chronicling its World_War_II history , Japan long has edited_out various incidents , both good and bad . Chiune Sugihara , Japan ' s version of Oskar Schindler , was one of those left_out until well after his death eight years ago.Like the German industrialist Schindler , he is remembered gratefully for following his heart and conscience to save thousands of lives . Sugihara , while consul general in Lithuania , defied the Japanese Foreign Ministry ' s order not to help Jewish refugees , personally writing an estimated 1 # 600 exit visas for Jews fleeing Poland . The transit visas , many covering whole families , enabled 2 # 000 to 6 # 000 people to flee the Nazis from the eastern port of Vladivostok to Japan and , from there , to other countries . For his defiance , Sugihara was reassigned to Berlin . Upon his return to Japan in 1947 he was fired by the postwar government . He was a modest man and for nearly 50 years was virtually unknown in his own country , even though in 1985 he was given Israel ' s version of the Nobel Peace Prize . Not until 1991 did Japan officially praise Sugihara . There is no acclaimed movie such_as &quot; Schindler ' s List &quot; to tell the world of Sugihara . The Japanese Education Ministry , however , recently approved the first textbook that includes his case . Robert Barram , a Boston University communications professor , is leading an effort to broadcast on U.S. television a 1992 Japanese docudrama about Sugihara called &quot; Visas for Life &quot; and to circulate it among colleges , libraries and study groups . Sugihara should not be forgotten in his country , or here .</TEXT>
