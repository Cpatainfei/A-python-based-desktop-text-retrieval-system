   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / DONELLA H . MEADOWS : 300 M.P.G. IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION ; ALL THE TECHNOLOGY FOR A FUEL-EFFICIENT ' SUPERCAR ' IS IN USE NOW , BUT IT WILL TAKE A NEW MIND-SET TO BRING IT TOGETHER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A year ago , with considerable fanfare , President Clinton entered into an agreement with the Big Three U.S. auto_makers to develop within 10 years cars that can double or triple the 30 miles per gallon that the average new American car gets now . In fact , many auto_companies have had for years demonstration models that get 60 to 100 miles to the gallon . I used to listen with amazement when engineers claimed they could get 120 to 130 m.p.g. Then my friend Amory Lovins , the energy-efficiency guru of Rocky Mountain Institute , turned his attention from saving electricity to saving gas . He started talking_about 150 miles per gallon . That number crept_up to 200 . Now he ' s confident of 300 m.p.g. , he ' s done calculations that yield 600 , and on his expansive days , he stuns his own staff by mentioning 1 # 000 . And he ' s not talking puny jazzed-up bicycles or high-tech jewels made of rare metals . He ' s talking safe , peppy , comfortable , quiet , beautiful , affordable family cars . They are , however , a wholly different kind of car . In today ' s most efficient cars , only 15 % to 20 % of the energy in the gas gets_to the wheels . Only about 2 % actually moves the driver ; the rest hauls the ton of metal around the driver . Because of that ton of metal , engines have to be enormous . The key to the &quot; supercar &quot; is to make_it much lighter and much more aerodynamic , which would then allow it to have a much smaller , more efficient engine . The lightness comes from getting_rid_of the steel . The supercar will be made of composite_materials -- carbon-fiber , fiberglass and plastic specially designed to absorb far more crash energy per pound than metal . You ' ve watched these materials at_work if you ' ve ever seen an Indy-500 driver hit a wall at 200 m.p.h. and walk away . Race_cars are made of carbon-fiber . This material can be reclaimed and recycled and it doesn ' t rust . Lovins estimates that cars could be made two to six times as slippery as they are now ( in terms of energy lost to air drag ) by , for instance , reducing the frontal_area and making the underside as smooth as the top . A lighter , sleeker car can have a lighter suspension and needs to carry less fuel . It puts less weight on the tires , so it loses less energy to road friction . The supercar engine will be &quot; hybrid-electric. &quot; The hybrid-electric car will carry fuel to make its own electricity on board . It will recapture about 70 % of the energy lost in braking by using a small battery or a flywheel , which can deliver extra push for acceleration and hill-climbing . Says Lovins , &quot; With its power so boosted , the engine needs to handle only the average load , not the peak load , so it can shrink to about one-tenth the normal size . It would run very near its optimal point , doubling its efficiency , and turn_off whenever it ' s not needed. &quot; Such an engine could run_on any fuel , from gasoline or natural_gas to solar-generated hydrogen . Except for that last bit about hydrogen , none of these ideas -- composite body , advanced aerodynamics , hybrid-electric engine -- is impossibly futuristic . Each one is already in_use somewhere . What ' s new is putting them together to reap their reinforcing benefits . The combination will revolutionize the automobile_industry . Lovins envisions assembly_plants that mold lightweight , easy-to-handle car pieces , combining in one step 10 to 100 parts that now have to be pounded out of steel and welded together . The pieces would n ' t have to be painted because the color could be added in the mold . The molds would be simpler and far less expensive than tool-steel dies . It would take weeks or months , not years , to change a design . Factories could be small and widely distributed . Lovins imagines buying a car the way he now buys a home computer , out of a catalogue , or after a demonstration of the options , making his choice and having the car delivered to his door two days later , freshly turned_out in a local plant . If you think the purpose of life is to maximize the gross_national_product , you might see the supercar as a disaster . It would certainly downsize the car-making , petroleum and steel_industries . If , however , you understand that the GNP is the cost we pay to lead life , you ' ll rejoice . There can be nothing wrong with using less oil and steel , generating less pollution , mining and drilling less wilderness , transporting less material , being less dependent_on imports , and not having to defend the Persian_Gulf . No new technology solves every problem . Supercars won ' t unclog traffic_jams or reduce the need to cover the land with asphalt . If that ' s what we want , we ' ll have to do even more advanced thinking .</TEXT>
