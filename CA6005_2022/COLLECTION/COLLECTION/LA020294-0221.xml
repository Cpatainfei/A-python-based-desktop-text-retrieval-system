   <HEADLINE> NAVY GETS OK TO USE UNDERWATER EXPLOSIVES ; ENVIRONMENT : FISHERIES PANEL APPROVES OFFSHORE EXERCISES TO TEST STRENGTH OF WARSHIPS . ACTIVISTS CONDEMN PLAN THAT ALLOWS FOR DEATHS OF PROTECTED SPECIES DURING BLASTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Navy plan to detonate underwater explosives west of the Channel Islands to test the strength and durability of warships was approved Tuesday by the National Marine Fisheries Service , a decision that could prompt legal challenges from environmental groups . Beginning March 3 , the Navy will have the authority to conduct the tests that could involve the &quot; incidental take &quot; or killing of some federally protected sea_lions , seals and whales . The Navy plans to detonate the explosives -- some as large as 10 # 000 pounds -- in waters of the Outer Sea Test_Range , about 60 miles west of the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station in Ventura County . The Navy will be able to conduct as_many as 10 tests a year for a period of five years but must seek reauthorization yearly from the fisheries service . Fisheries officials said they decided to grant the Navy ' s request because of safeguards in the testing procedure that call_for extensive pre- and post-test aerial observation flights . The Navy also agreed that testing would be halted if marine mammals are found in the test zone . The test zone is in the migratory path of gray_whales , and marine biologists have noted four species of seals and sea_lions and 17 species of whales in the area . All of these species are protected by federal law and some of them are listed by federal_officials as endangered . &quot; We are pleased to be of assistance in providing additional monitoring and checkpoints so that our obligation to provide environmental protection for marine mammals is carried_out appropriately while balancing our national defense obligations , &quot; fisheries service director Rolland Schmitten said in a statement . Schmitten added that fisheries service biologists have spent more_than a year surveying the Point Mugu test_range and have pinpointed three sites where marine mammals are least likely to be . But representatives of local environmental groups say the approval of the testing program shows the federal agency ' s disregard for protecting the marine environment . &quot; I saw this coming_down the tracks , &quot; said Alan Godley , a Ventura environmental activist . &quot; I ' m disappointed because I think this shows the Clinton_Administration ' s real disregard for protecting the marine environment. &quot; Maris Sidenstecker , co-founder of Venice-based Save the Whales , called the Fisheries Service decision &quot; disgusting &quot; and vowed to seek a legal injunction against the Navy before testing can begin . &quot; We are prepared to do what we have to do legally to try and stop this awful program , &quot; Sidenstecker said . &quot; There is too_much on the line out there. &quot; Alan Alpers , a Point Mugu spokesman , said the fact that the Navy ' s permit provides_for the incidental deaths of marine mammals does not mean that large_numbers of deaths will occur . &quot; Just because we have that authorization doesn ' t mean that there will be a lot of animals killed , &quot; Alpers said . &quot; We have designed the testing procedure to very carefully prevent harming animal life. &quot; Lt . Cmdr . Frank Thorp , a Navy surface fleet spokesman in San Diego , said the test is part of a $ 35-million Naval trial program . He said that initially the Navy will conduct the testing on one of its high-tech Arleigh Burke-class destroyers , the John Paul Jones . The Jones is equipped with the Navy ' s Aegis weapons_system -- a computerized system capable of tracking and engaging multiple targets . Navy officials say that the testing program is of critical importance in determining the &quot; survivability &quot; factor of new vessels before they face combat -- specifically , testing ship hulls , electronic systems and the vessels ' ability to protect their crews .</TEXT>
