   <HEADLINE> CENTER PLAN TO BE UNVEILED AT NIXON SALUTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Shortly before noon today , 25 years after he stood on the steps of the nation ' s Capitol and swore to uphold the Constitution , former President Richard Nixon will stand_in the shadow of his boyhood home and celebrate the part of his past that was glorious . Amid much fanfare and souvenirs from that day when he became the nation ' s 37th President , Nixon will hear accolades about foreign_policy achievements , be hailed as the sage from whom world leaders seek advice , and pose for a commemorative photograph with one of his former vice_presidents and about two_dozen members of his Cabinets . And in tribute to Nixon -- the only American President forced to resign after being disgraced by political scandal -- the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace will mark the anniversary of his inauguration with the unveiling of plans for the Center for Peace and Freedom , a think_tank dedicated to Nixon ' s principles of &quot; enlightened national interest in foreign_policy and pragmatic idealism in domestic affairs. &quot; Or as one library official said Wednesday , the center ' s policy studies will use as a guide Nixon ' s &quot; hardheaded , pragmatic , realistic focus_on what can be accomplished , rather than what we hope to be accomplished &quot; on foreign and domestic issues . About 1 # 000 invited guests are expected to attend the event , which is closed to the public but will be broadcast later in the day on C-SPAN . * An ongoing fund-raising_drive for the library and new policy center , which is scheduled to open in 1997 , was boosted with the announcement Wednesday that the Annenberg Foundation will make a $ 5-million challenge grant . As of Wednesday , the &quot; Legacy for Peace &quot; campaign had raised $ 13.5 million of its $ 25-million goal . The Annenberg Foundation is named for former Ambassador Walter H . Annenberg , who announced during a White_House ceremony last December that the foundation would donate $ 500 million for U.S. schools . &quot; His personal support for our campaign and for the Center for Peace and Freedom is the surest indication we could have that we are engaged in a profoundly worthy cause , &quot; library Chairman George L . Argyros said in a statement Wednesday . Of the $ 25 million to be raised , $ 20 million will be used to fund an endowment , with some of the income used to defray the operating_costs of the Nixon library , as well as programming at the policy center . While officials say the library is financially sound , federal tax documents filed by the facility last November showed it had lost $ 1.5 million during two years of operation . It is the only presidential library in the nation to operate without federal funds . In 1974 , Congress refused to turn_over to Nixon the papers and tape_recordings from his presidency , making the library ineligible to become part of the National Archives system until the law is amended . * Headquartered in Yorba Linda , the new policy center will establish eight endowed chairs -- six in the area of foreign_policy and two focusing_on domestic issues -- reflecting the primary focus that the Nixon Administrations paid to foreign relations . It is in the area of foreign_policy that Nixon achieved his greatest success , Nixon observers said . &quot; Nobody would want to hear what he has to say &quot; on domestic issues , said Stephen E . Ambrose , a Nixon biographer and history professor at the University of New Orleans . &quot; It was not an interest of his and certainly not a strength. &quot; Perhaps Nixon ' s greatest foreign_policy achievement was in the re-establishment of relations with China after two decades of isolation , followed by the beginning of detente with the Soviet_Union and the &quot; shuttle diplomacy &quot; of his Secretary_of_State Henry A . Kissinger in an attempt to negotiate peace in the Middle_East . Although Nixon had campaigned for the presidency in 1968 with the promise that he had a &quot; secret_plan &quot; to end the Vietnam_War , it took him five years to accomplish only a withdrawal of American troops from the war . The foreign_policy chairs will be titled : &quot; Russian and the Other Post-Soviet States , &quot; &quot; Sino-United States Relations , &quot; &quot; United States-Japan Relations , &quot; &quot; The New Europe , &quot; &quot; The Mideast , &quot; and &quot; The Moslem World. &quot; The two domestic policy chairs planned so far are in &quot; Representative Governance &quot; and &quot; Morality , Freedom and National Renewal. &quot; Also , the policy center ' s program will include the Richard Nixon Foreign Policy Institute to be established in Washington . Part of its mission will be to prepare &quot; an annual assessment of each incumbent Administration ' s conduct of national security policy , &quot; library officials said .</TEXT>
