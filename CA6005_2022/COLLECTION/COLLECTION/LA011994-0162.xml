   <HEADLINE> APARTMENT COLLAPSE PROBE RAISES QUESTIONS ON CODES ; SAFETY : PLYWOOD CONSTRUCTION WAS NOT REQUIRED WHEN COMPLEX WAS BUILT . BUILDER SAYS RULES WERE FOLLOWED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The San Fernando Valley apartment complex that collapsed and killed 16 people Monday was built like thousands of other structures throughout Los Angeles -- without plywood reinforcement that gives extra strength to walls during earthquakes , according to preliminary reports from city and state building officials Tuesday . Plywood reinforcing has been used to meet city and state building_codes that were strengthened after the 1971 Sylmar earthquake , but it was not required when the apartment complex was built , officials said . City officials have not pinpointed the cause of the building ' s dramatic failure , but they said they will evaluate whether it was an isolated incident or one that indicates a widespread problem . They also said they will examine whether old wood-frame buildings should be required to meet more stringent standards , as is now required of unreinforced masonry buildings . Brian Heller , whose company built the apartment_building that collapsed , said the building was constructed according to existing codes then and with &quot; every earthquake device that was required . . . and I think that included plywood. &quot; &quot; It ' s just awful , &quot; he said of the collapse . &quot; I really have no idea what happened. &quot; In a published report , the building ' s designer also said that he was at_a_loss to explain the collapse , but speculated that a violent upward thrust from the quake was to blame . &quot; I feel terrible . . . . As far as I ' m concerned , there ' s no way to attach blame to anybody , &quot; he said . When construction got under way in 1972 , the 163-unit Northridge Meadows Apartments met existing codes , officials said Tuesday . Experts said the three-story wood-frame complex relied only on its exterior stucco and interior walls to withstand lateral shaking from an earthquake . &quot; What struck me more_than anything else was that the building used stucco and plaster or drywall inside , which provided the lateral resistance , &quot; said Richard Renous , senior structural engineer with the state Office of Emergency Services , after visiting the collapsed building . &quot; I didn ' t see any plywood , &quot; Renous said . &quot; There may_not be any plywood in that building at all. &quot; Bob Harder , manager of the city building_department ' s office in Van Nuys , said : &quot; The preliminary report ( on the building ) is that there was no plywood. &quot; But Harder said he was unable to locate architectural drawings . The code , he said , now requires 50 % more lateral strength in walls , resulting in &quot; extra use of plywood throughout most buildings . . . . You can ' t build a three-story building without plywood. &quot; The building ' s architect , Morris Brown of Lompoc , told Newsday that the building was designed to conform_to the codes in_force at the time and recollected that plywood was required . But he said that even the most stringent codes and modern construction techniques cannot protect a building hit by the full force of an earthquake . &quot; There ' s no such thing as earthquake-proofing them , only making them earthquake resistant , &quot; Brown said . &quot; If you ' re on an epicenter , who knows what will happen ? &quot; City officials say that although most apartment_buildings survived Monday ' s 6.6. temblor , the collapse of the Northridge Meadows apartments underscored the need to evaluate whether older buildings should be upgraded to meet modern earthquake standards . &quot; The codes are totally inadequate , &quot; said City Councilman Hal Bernson , whose district suffered the brunt of Monday ' s damage . &quot; Maybe we can save some people in the next one. &quot; Councilman Richard Alarcon separately introduced a motion Tuesday directing building officials to assess any damage across the city that may have resulted from code violations and recommend ways to prevent it . Building officials said that inspecting all apartment_buildings built before 1973 would be a massive undertaking . Requiring owners to add plywood would be costly , they said , because walls would have to be opened . Officials said they will not immediately investigate why the Northridge complex collapsed . &quot; that ' s a forensic problem , &quot; said Nick DelliQuadri , senior structural engineer for the city of Los Angeles building_department . &quot; Right now we ' re trying to sort_out what other buildings are ready to fall down. &quot; He said inspectors Tuesday morning ordered evacuation of six or seven buildings in the Northridge area , but he declined to describe them or identify them by address . Renous cautioned that only a detailed investigation will determine the exact cause of collapse of Northridge Meadows . Soil condition may have been a factor_in the building ' s failure , he said . He pointed_out that the vast majority of similar structures did not collapse . &quot; There are lots of three-story buildings built about the same time , probably built the same way , and they did not fail , &quot; he said . A similar building next-door to the Northridge Meadows complex , built about the same time by the same developer and architect , remained standing after the earthquake , though it was damaged by severe cracking . &quot; This is how we experience damage , &quot; said Steve Kiefer , senior building inspector with the Building and Safety Department . &quot; You can have one block that ' s totally devastated , and an adjacent block where the pictures are still standing ( on the walls ) . &quot; Conventional wisdom is that wood-frame buildings , especially apartments , tend to survive earthquakes . &quot; It was not the type of building that you would have expected to fail , &quot; said Warren O ' Brien , head of the city Building and Safety Department . &quot; Apartment_buildings are pretty resilient to earthquakes because they have so many walls. &quot; But fire officials said the first_floor of the Northridge building , built partly over carports , moved several feet and collapsed , bringing the second and third stories down . &quot; It must have been some torque kind of force that moved the front about six feet north and the rear about six feet south , &quot; said Fire Battalion Chief Bob DeFeo . &quot; When it did that , the bottom floor went like a house of cards. &quot; Bodies of 16 residents were pulled from the wreckage by special search-and-rescue teams using electronic_devices to detect victims . Records show that on July 30 , 1970 , Heller Construction Co . of Tarzana took_out a permit to build Northridge Meadows on Reseda Boulevard . The city granted a certificate of occupancy on the building in March , 1973 , records show . Bernson said the city should consider taking measures to require apartment complexes like Northridge Meadows to meet stiffer seismic safety standards , just as the council has required for old reinforced masonry buildings . In 1981 , a city ordinance was passed that compelled owners of the brick structures to reinforce their properties to meet tougher earthquake standards . A similar effort involving pre-1974 wooden frame buildings , he acknowledged , may encounter political opposition from owners reluctant to make costly repairs . Bernson said he is concerned that the Northridge Meadows apartments were constructed partially over carports , which may increase the danger of collapse . &quot; I was the same type of construction they had problems with after the Loma Prieta collapse , &quot; he said of the 1989 quake in Northern California . Current codes in Los Angeles allow carports under apartment_buildings but the construction standards are stiffer than during the early 1970s . Bernson also called_for an investigation into the collapse of relatively new parking structures in his district -- one on the Cal State Northridge campus and two at the Northridge Fashion Center . Mall officials could not be reached for comment . But George Snead , principal architect for California State University , said the Cal State Northridge parking structure that collapsed in the quake had met all building requirements then in_force . In fact , Cal State officials said the 2-year-old CSUN parking structure served as the model for a systemwide seismic inspection program . Several sections of CSUN ' s four-story parking structure fell_in a pile of cement rubble . No one was in the 2 # 447-car structure when it fell . The parking garage was built with a combination of precast and cast-in-place construction methods , CSU officials said . Renous , with the state Office of Emergency Services , said the parking complex collapsed like a pancake , but pointed_out : &quot; It was right over the epicenter of the earthquake. &quot;</TEXT>
