   <HEADLINE> JAPAN ' S BESIEGED PREMIER LIKELY TO RESIGN , RUN AGAIN ; ASIA : HATA , BATTLING A NO-CONFIDENCE MOTION , MAY ACCEPT SOCIALISTS ' DEMAND HE QUIT TO DRAW THEM BACK TO COALITION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata , who is battling a no-confidence motion , indicated Thursday that he will resign and run again for prime_minister to meet a face-saving demand of the Socialist_Party , if the Socialists return to his coalition government . The Socialists renewed the demand in bargaining that is continuing today on terms for a new coalition that would remain under Hata ' s leadership . If the demand is not accepted , Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama said his party would support a no-confidence motion against Hata and insist on holding the vote today . Television commentators called the demand &quot; hard to understand. &quot; But analysts said the Socialists need the gesture of contrition to justify their return to a government they bolted only eight weeks ago after voting for Hata as prime_minister . They then accused him of betraying them for failing to consult them about a shuffle in the makeup of the coalition . Hata ' s resignation would wipe_out the no-confidence motion , which was certain to pass without Socialist support of the prime_minister . A Socialist return to the coalition would give the ruling group_a razor-thin majority of only one seat in the lower house and would offer no assurance that Hata would win a new election , which would have to be held to pick a prime_minister . As_many as 20 Socialists intend to vote against Hata if their party rejoins the coalition , said Minoru Morita , a respected political commentator . Hata offered to resign in a news_conference conducted less than an hour after the upper house approved the 1994 budget and the opposition Liberal Democratic Party submitted its bid to oust him . Coalition opponents had pledged to uphold a political truce only until the long-delayed budget was enacted . The Socialists ' offer underscored Hata ' s desperation and the peril to his continued rule . Emphasizing the political crisis , Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa canceled plans to meet U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor in Los Angeles this weekend to conduct trade talks . Admitting that his Cabinet controlling only 37 % of the seats in the lower house was &quot; very weak , &quot; Hata declared that Japan needs a strong government &quot; more_than anything else &quot; to tackle a host of urgent issues . Among them , he named tax reform , trade frictions with the United States , suspicions of North_Korean development of nuclear_weapons and reforms of politics , economics , and the government administration . &quot; Japan cannot avoid dealing with these issues . . . ( that ) will fix the direction for the nation ' s future , &quot; he said . He belittled the suggestion that he should seek an alliance with the Liberal Democrats , rather than with the Socialists . That move , he said , would turn the clock back to a time when the political structure was conservative and concerned with preserving the status_quo . &quot; We ( the coalition ) came_into power seeking change , &quot; he said . * It remains unclear who would run against Hata if an election for prime_minister were held . But Morita named Liberal defector Masayoshi Takemura , leader of the splinter New Party Harbinger , as a likely prime_minister in any coalition involving the Liberal Democrats and part or all_of the Socialists . Takemura , he said , is the only &quot; bridge &quot; figure who could link the two disparate parties without causing splits in both of them . Takemura ' s party joined the ruling coalition in August and voted for Hata in April but refused to join Hata ' s Cabinet . Since then , Takemura , a former prefectural ( state ) governor , has become increasingly critical of the coalition . In a bid Thursday to sabotage talks between the Socialists and Hata ' s followers , Takemura offered to support Socialist Chairman Murayama as prime_minister . Takemura is an archenemy of Ichiro Ozawa , Hata ' s chief strategist . While Ozawa supports Japan playing a larger role in international politics and U.N. peacekeeping efforts , Takemura advocates Japan assuming the posture of a &quot; small country that sparkles , &quot; shying_away_from both overseas military activities and a global leadership role . Socialist and coalition leaders met three times Thursday and agreed to hold another session this morning . Should the talks break_down and the Socialists join the Liberal Democrats in passing a no-confidence motion , Hata is expected to dissolve the lower house and call a general_election for either July 24 or July 31 , Morita predicted . Morita said a July election would be an unpredictable , nip-and-tuck battle between Hata ' s coalition on one side , and the Liberal Democrats , all or part of the Socialists and Takemura ' s New Party Harbinger on the other . More_than any argument over policy , he said , the core of the present political uproar centers_on a &quot; generational dispute. &quot; His view is that the aging Liberal Democrat bosses -- in_league with elder Socialists -- struck_out against Hata now to hang_on to the old system of multi-seat election_districts , in which candidates have focused_on pork-barrel promises .</TEXT>
