   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP COACHING ISN ' T STABLE ; SOCCER : NINE OF 24 POSITIONS HAVE CHANGED SINCE TOURNAMENT ENDED , BUT GERMANY ' S VOGTS IS STILL EMPLOYED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Berti Vogts failed , but he still has a job . Carlos Alberto Parreira succeeded , but he quit anyway . Soccer coaching , it seems , is an uncertain and unpredictable profession . Success is no guarantee of continued employment , while failure does not mean instant dismissal . Take World Cup ' 94 . In the month since it ended , nine of the 24 national teams have changed coaches . Some left voluntarily . Others were pushed_out . Brazil won the World Cup , but Parreira wasted no time in resigning , citing the pressure of the job and the continued criticism from fans and media . Greece finished last among the 24 teams ; Alkis Panagoulias will stay until his contract expires Aug . 31 and then move_on . After the Italia ' 90 tournament , the post-World Cup housecleaning affected virtually every team . This time , the brooms have been more selective . Europe , for instance , has been the model of stability and continuity , with 11 of the 13 national team coaches retaining their position . But South_America and Africa have been just the opposite , with all seven World Cup participants making changes . Some big names have fallen by the wayside . Argentina ' s failure in the second round meant that Alfio Basile ' s days in_charge were numbered . He knew it as soon as his team was beaten by Romania . &quot; Argentina ' s record since I took_over ( after the 1990 World Cup ) is excellent , &quot; Basile said . &quot; We ' ve won two Copa America tournaments and we worked really hard and put everything into this World Cup campaign . &quot; But , in Argentina , second place is not good enough. &quot; Think then , how Argentine fans must have felt about finishing 10th . No successor has been named , but the favorite is Daniel Passarella , a member of Argentina ' s 1978 World Cup-winning team . In Germany , Vogts , too , might have been expected to resign or be kicked_out after the Germans were upset by Bulgaria in the quarterfinals . The cries_for Vogts ' head raged , but the German federation , the DFB , decided to keep him without as much as a slap_on the wrist . Vogts had threatened to quit if a single word was uttered against him by the DFB . The federation remained silent , but that didn ' t stop others from voicing their opinion . &quot; Whether Vogts stays or goes is not important , &quot; said former national team player Felix Magath . &quot; Whoever ' s in_charge faces a tough job . Success comes and goes_in cycles , and we ' re on the ( downward ) slide . &quot; I think Berti made a mistake by relying_on experience . He didn ' t introduce enough new blood . Now that ( Rudi ) Voeller , ( Guido ) Buchwald , ( Andreas ) Brehme and perhaps ( Lothar ) Matthaeus have played their last internationals , we ' re left with a huge gap to fill . I ' m worried . Continuity has gone_out the window. &quot; Well , not quite . Vogts is still there , even though he bristles_at the negative press he has received . &quot; It may have been easier just to get_rid_of me , but then they ' d have had no focus for their criticism , &quot; he said . Parreira knows all about criticism and , having held_firm in the face of an onslaught of negative publicity during Brazil ' s qualifying campaign and its triumphant World Cup run , he decided enough was enough . He resigned to become coach of Valencia in the Spanish first division , where one of his opponents will be Atletico Madrid , coached by Colombia ' s World Cup coach , Francisco Maturana , who also resigned . Shortly after leaving , Parreira fired some parting shots at his critics , including the fans . &quot; The population ( of Brazil ) is an echo without its own opinion , &quot; he said . &quot; It only reflects what it hears . &quot; Your average fan goes_to Maracana ( Stadium ) and watches the game but always listens to a transistor radio . It is important that somebody tells him what he is seeing . He can ' t analyze the game himself. &quot; Parreira also lashed_out at former national team coach Tele Santana , who led Brazil in the 1982 and 1986 World Cup campaigns and who was one of Parreira ' s most astringent critics . &quot; Nobody has ever had a team as_good_as his and failed to win , &quot; Parreira said . Replacing Parreira will be Mario Zagalo , 63 , who played left wing on Brazil ' s winning 1958 and 1962 teams , coached its winning 1970 team and was technical director of the 1994 team . Zagalo , whose first task will be to build a team for the 1995 Copa America , or South_American Championship , in Uruguay , says winning the gold medal in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics is his real goal . Taking_over for Maturana in Colombia , meanwhile , is assistant Hernan Dario Gomez , who was given the position even though he earlier had said he was not interested in it . Gomez is a relative of Colombian national team midfielder Gabriel Gomez , the player whose family was the target of death threats during the World Cup . Among the other coaches who have stepped_down or been forced aside are Bolivia ' s Xavier Azkargorta , who cited the chaotic state of Bolivian soccer for his decision to resign , and Russia ' s Pavel Sadyrin , who might have said much the same thing . Sadyrin has been replaced by Oleg Romantsev , formerly coach of Spartak Moscow , the country ' s most successful team . Russia failed to make_it out of the first round , but it did succeed in defeating Cameroon , a 1990 quarterfinalist , 6-1 , with Oleg Salenko scoring a World Cup-record five goals . Salenko is now playing for Parreira at Valencia , while Cameroon has dismissed its World Cup coach , Frenchman Henri Michel . In Michel ' s place , the national soccer federation has appointed Jules Nyongha , the first Cameroonian to hold the position in two decades . Another African team , Morocco , also hired a local coach to take_over its national team , with Mohammed Ammari replacing Abdellah Ajri . Nigeria has not renewed Dutch coach Clemens Westerhof ' s contract and has not appointed a successor . In Europe , meanwhile , stability reigns as the national teams prepare_for the qualifying campaigns for the 1996 European Championship in England . Arrigo Sacchi , the Italian coach whose team was beaten by Brazil in the World Cup_final , has perhaps the easiest of tasks . Italy has been drawn_in a group that includes lightweights Ukraine , Croatia , Lithuania , Estonia and Slovenia . Given Sacchi ' s luck in 1994 , he should be able to book Italy ' s ticket to England right now . One slip , though , and they ' ll be calling_for his head . Soccer coaching is like that .
