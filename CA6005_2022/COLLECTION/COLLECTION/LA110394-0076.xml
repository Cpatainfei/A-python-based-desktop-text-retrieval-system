   <HEADLINE> COLUMN LEFT / ALEXANDER COCKBURN : IN HONOR OF CHARLATANS AND RACISTS ; ' THE BELL CURVE ' PAYS TRIBUTE TO SOME OF HISTORY ' S MOST NOTORIOUS PSEUDOSCIENTIFIC HATEMONGERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The authors of &quot; The Bell Curve &quot; and the immigrant-haters behind Proposition 187 all drink from the same polluted stream that has watered race hygienists and ethnic cleansers back to the founder of the pseudoscience of eugenics , Darwin ' s half-cousin Francis Galton ; and back to important begetters of the sister pseudoscience of IQ testing . Open_up Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray ' s &quot; The Bell Curve &quot; and glance at the introduction , where the authors list their intellectual ancestry . There on the opening page is Galton , cited in blandly respectful terms . Galton was a charlatan whose scientific procedures are_well exhibited in his 1873 essay &quot; Hereditary Improvement. &quot; He wrote that , after the great famine of the 1840s , &quot; The Irish type of face seemed to have become more prognathous , that is , more like the Negro in the protrusion of the lower jaw ; the interpretation of which was that the men who had survived the starvation and other deadly accidents of that horrible time were more generally of a low or coarse organization. &quot; Today , Murray travels the talk_shows arguing that the welfare_state should be dismantled because expenditures designed to improve the condition of the poor are wasted , since the poor -- particularly poor blacks -- are congenitally impervious to such efforts . Murray wants children of welfare mothers to be placed in orphan-ages where , as he confidently predicted in testimony before Congress this summer , there would be takers not only for &quot; flawless blue-eyed blond infants &quot; but also for &quot; babies of all colors and conditions. &quot; Given honorable_mention in &quot; The Bell Curve &quot; is Henry Goddard , who first adapted the tests of intelligence developed in France by Alfred Binet ( who himself had strong doubts about their premises and utility ) . Goddard used his IQ_tests at Ellis Island in 1917 to &quot; prove &quot; what he , like Galton , already believed : that Jews , Catholics and southern Europeans belonged_to inferior races . Goddard strove to persuade Americans -- with considerable success -- that 83 % of Jews were feebleminded , sharing this trait with 80 % of all Hungarians , 79 % of all Italians and 87 % of all Russians . His work_at Ellis Island helped pave the way for the 1924 Immigration Restriction Act . Herrnstein and Murray try mightily in their book to protect Goddard and his associates from connection to this law , because it was precisely that the pseudoscience of eugenics and IQ began to cash out as genocide . Hitler took the 1924 U.S. law and the pseudosciences behind it as models for Nazi efforts in applied eugenics . Indeed , many excluded from the United States by the law were later murdered by the Nazis on the ground that they were &quot; dysgenic. &quot; Today ' s nativists promoting Proposition 187 are nourished by an ideology and by &quot; scientific &quot; rationales kindred to the intellectual lineage of &quot; The Bell Curve. &quot; One organization with a keen interest in Proposition 187 , though keeping a low profile for political reasons , is the rabidly anti-immigrant Federation of American Immigration Reform . One of FAIR ' s top lobbyists , former INS Commissioner Alan Nelson , helped draft Proposition 187 in 1993 , the year he was paid $ 70 # 000 by FAIR , which he listed as his only client . A review of IRS documents shows that between 1982 and 1992 , FAIR received just under $ 1.1 million from the New York-based Pioneer Fund , making_it the second-largest of Pioneer ' s 22 grant recipients . The original aim of the Pioneer Fund , established in 1937 by textile magnate and Nazi admirer Wickliffe Draper , was to promote breeding of &quot; white_persons who settled in the original 13 colonies. &quot; Its first president was the eugenicist Harry Laughlin , who in the 1930s lobbied to prevent Jews fleeing Germany from entering the United States . He called Nazi sterilization laws &quot; a most exciting experiment. &quot; Many of Pioneer ' s leading grant recipients are cited amiably in &quot; The Bell Curve. &quot; Among them is J . Phillipe Rushton ( $ 656 # 672 from 1982 to 1992 ) of the University of Western Ontario , who believes that there is an inverse relationship between genital size and intelligence . Herrnstein and Murray , conceding that Rushton &quot; paints with a broad brush , &quot; assert he is neither &quot; a crackpot nor a bigot. &quot; When it comes_to theorists and practitioners of IQ- or gene-based theories of race inferiority , or nativist defenders of the gene pool from alien intrusion , there is no &quot; respectable &quot; sector . They ' re all down there in the gutter , paddling in the vilest tradition of Western thought and political history .</TEXT>
