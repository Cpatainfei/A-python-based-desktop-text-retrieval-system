   <HEADLINE> O.C. NOBLY UNITES IN SPIRIT OF GIVING ; THE HOLIDAY SERVES AS REMINDER OF CONCERN FOR OTHERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The boats in Newport Bay are decorated and so are the churches in Mission Viejo . Tons of food have been collected and distributed . Finally , it is Christmas . The Orange County bankruptcy stunned county residents and occurred at a time when most people gladly would have been turning their thoughts to the holidays , to spiritual concerns and to families , and to wondering where the year went and whether to put flocking on the tree . It was more difficult this year , but the important concern for others at the core of the season did shine through . In Anaheim , more_than 100 police and firefighters , Salvation_Army representatives and volunteers from community groups drove through neighborhoods singing carols and collecting food for the needy . The day of caroling and collecting has become an annual tradition . In Costa Mesa , the Philharmonic Society and the Orange County Performing Arts Center had their first Christmas celebration for children . It deserves to become an annual event . Children watched gleefully as Mexican folk_dancers and mariachi bands entertained ; performers staged Las Posadas , the traditional Mexican processions portraying Joseph and Mary ' s journey to Bethlehem . Some were children of recent immigrants ; others were the sons and daughters of AIDS patients . Local companies and volunteer groups provided toys . In Santa Ana , a retail_store donated a Christmas_tree , the Fire_Department delivered it and parents planted and decorated it to symbolize new hope in a neighborhood plagued by gangs until a police sweep last fall . The parents have done_good work all year , banding_together to walk children to school safely along streets that too often echoed with gunfire . Their actions reflected the need to help police and other government_agencies stop a neighborhood ' s decay . The Orange County chapter of the American Red_Cross brought Santa Claus along to help pass_out toys collected from high_schools and businesses . The recipients were children from elementary and intermediate schools in Santa Ana who one volunteer said , &quot; might not have a Christmas otherwise. &quot; The Red_Cross wisely enlisted more_than 100 youth volunteers to help pass_out the gifts and work with_children to fashion crafts . That helps build a sense of community , which is especially needed in tough times . In Westminster , volunteers also helped Abrazar Inc. , which conducted its 15th annual food giveaway , but which also required something from the recipients . Each family receiving a shopping_cart filled with $ 125 worth of food had to contribute $ 25 . The director of Abrazar ( Spanish for &quot; to hug &quot; ) said families showed_up on_time when they had a financial stake in the donation . There were ceremonies , too , at the homeless shelters , food distribution centers and other locations where workers labor year-round to help those needing it . The Salvation_Army said it expects to give Christmas food and gifts to 10 # 000 families in Orange County , the most ever . The charitable organizations deserve thanks and support . Last year the county marked Christmas less than three months after the devastating Laguna Beach fires . This year it came only weeks after the bankruptcy that caused many to wonder if they would lose their government or teaching jobs . For Christians , today is a religious_holiday . For everyone , regardless of belief , it can be an occasion to remind us of our concern for others . And the decorations and trees all around can help spur optimism , and sustain a spirit of sharing and giving that goes so well with the season .</TEXT>
