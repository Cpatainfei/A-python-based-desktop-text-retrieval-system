   <HEADLINE> PCS LICENSE AUCTION GETS GOING TODAY ; TELECOM : BIG PLAYERS DOMINATE WHAT ' S EXPECTED TO BE THE BIGGEST FCC WIRELESS PERMIT SALE YET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After weeks of publicity and financial jockeying , a surprisingly large_number of companies will sit_out today ' s start of the federal_government ' s multibillion-dollar auction of licenses for a new generation of wireless phones . But the absence of numerous prospective bidders is unlikely to dim the luster of an event that will be presided over by Vice_President Al Gore and Federal Communications Chairman Reed E . Hundt , and has attracted many of the biggest names in telecommunications . Today ' s auction of 99 broad-band licenses to launch an affordable mobile phone network for the masses will be by far the largest and most important in a series of controversial license sales that began this summer and have so far widely exceeded financial expectations . &quot; This could be one of the defining moments for wireless communications , &quot; said Todd Wolfenbarger , a spokesman for McCaw Cellular , the nation ' s largest cellular_phone operator . The personal communications services , or PCS , license auction will offer a rare opportunity to get_in on the ground_floor of what some predict will become a booming $ 40-billion-a-year market for wireless communications by early in the next century . PCS holds the promise of go-anywhere mobile communications that will permit consumers to send and receive phone_calls , computer data and faxes through devices as small and as unobtrusive as a wristwatch . They could be available in major cities within a_few years at a monthly rate below that for cellular_phones . &quot; From the nation ' s perspective , the auction is important in paving the way for vigorous hand-to-hand competition in wireless markets , &quot; FCC Chairman Hundt said . &quot; In the very near future , mobile communications is going_to be ( as commonplace ) as the sale of bread . . . . &quot; The auction , which will likely last several days , is expected to generate more_than $ 10 billion over the next five years -- more revenue than Uncle_Sam has raised over the past half a century selling offshore oil-drilling rights to private companies . Although 74 applicants met a registration deadline to bid on licenses for the wireless_telephone technology , just 30 later submitted the hefty cash deposits to qualify them to bid . The last-minute no-shows in the FCC auction include such prominent players as the computer data giant EDS of Plano , Tex. , Radio-fone Nationwide Paging Services of Matarie , La. , and U.S. Airwaves , headed by a former US West executive . Although a recent Standard &amp; Poor analysis determined that some of the biggest auction participants could borrow as much as $ 5.6 billion to pay_for PCS licenses , the large_number of no-shows has added_to concern that bidding in the FCC ' s richest auction may_not be as spirited as the first one in July . That event drew $ 800 million in bids -- about 10 times more_than expected -- for 10 nationwide licenses for a new wireless paging service . The Justice_Department has been investigating whether some recent alliances formed to bid in the PCS auction could violate federal antitrust_laws . The probe was launched after several big telecommunications companies -- including three of the regional Bell telephone_companies as well as two of the nation ' s biggest long-distance carriers , AT &amp; T and Sprint Corp . -- began forming partnerships or acquiring rivals to fortify their financial war_chests for bidding . The competitiveness of the bidding might be further undercut by the fact that the FCC has already awarded -- at below-market prices -- three lucrative PCS licenses covering Southern California , New York City and Washington , D.C. , under a controversial preference policy to reward PCS technology innovators . &quot; I don ' t think that the average PCS price will be all that high , &quot; said Betty Massick-Columbo , a telecommunications analyst at S.G. Warburg &amp; Co . in New York . &quot; The alliances that are being formed dramatically reduce the number of bidders for each market ( and ) . . . the business case for the financial viability of PCS is unclear enough that the companies will be very careful in their bidding strategies. &quot; Amy Damianakes , a spokeswoman for PSC Primeco , the PCS limited partnership of Bell Atlantic , Nynex , US West and AirTouch Communications , would not comment on the strategy of her partnership , but agreed that bidding could be cautious . &quot; I think you have to be very clear on your strategy and price points , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s going_to be a long chess game. &quot; The FCC has spent nearly $ 400 # 000 to outfit a vacant postal_service room near the Capitol with more_than 20 bidding booths and a dozen operator phone banks to field bids from auction participants . Bids will be entered on the computer terminals and conducted in three-hour-long rounds , and participants will be allowed to re-evaluate their initial bids or drop_out of competition for 20 minutes after each bidding round . Exhausting bidders ' financial resources could take some time , however , since the 30 participants include many telecommunications heavyweights . All seven of the regional Bell companies are bidding , for instance . Three of them -- US West , Bell Atlantic and Nynex -- are part of a consortium headed by cellular provider AirTouch Communications and have plunked_down a deposit of $ 55 million to bid on 26 PCS licenses . Another consortium made_up of long-distance carrier Sprint Corp . and three of the nation ' s largest cable TV companies is also bidding on more_than two_dozen licenses . Other deep-pocket bidders include AT &amp; T and its recently acquired McCaw Cellular unit , GTE , Pacific Telesis Mobile Services and a new company called ALAACR Communications , which is headed by cellular_phone mogul Craig McCaw . Several PSC applicants that dropped_out of competition said they were deterred by the financial firepower of these big players . Vitelcom , the wireless subsidiary of the_Virgin Island telephone_company , said it applied to bid and was financially prepared to submit a multimillion-dollar deposit but was scared_off by the competition . &quot; It was not the deposit but the financial commitment overall and what it would take_to play seriously against these other companies , &quot; said John W . Hunter , a Washington communications lawyer who represents Vitelcom . The absence of a diverse PCS ownership pool for the large licenses , however , could thwart development of the kind of intense competition that drove down long-distance phone rates following the breakup of the AT &amp; T monopoly , some critics say . Even some auction participants now concede that PCS won ' t compete head-on with the cellular_phone network but , rather , will compliment it because so many PCS bidders are made_up of cellular firms looking_to fill holes in their coverage areas with new wireless technologies . &quot; I think more and more people are not looking_at PCS as replacement technology , but looking_at it as an extension of cellular at a different ( radio ) frequency , &quot; said Wolfenbarger of McCaw . That synergy , he added , is what attracts companies like McCaw to PCS .</TEXT>
