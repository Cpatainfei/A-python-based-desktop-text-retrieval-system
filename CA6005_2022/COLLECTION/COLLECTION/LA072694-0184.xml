   <HEADLINE> EXTRADITION COULD TAKE MONTHS ; LAW : TO HAVE JOHN J . FAMALARO STAND TRIAL IN ORANGE COUNTY , PROSECUTORS MUST FOLLOW A SERIES OF LEGAL PROCEDURES THAT WOULD BE DELAYED IF HE OBJECTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Blood_tests may settle a debate over jurisdiction by week ' s end , but officials said Monday that it could take months to extradite John J . Famalaro if he is to stand trial in Orange County in the killing of Denise Huber . Defense_attorney Thomas K . Kelly has said he believes it would be &quot; advantageous &quot; for his client to be tried in California , where he said prosecutors would have a tougher time seeking the death_penalty against Famalaro . But the attorney has declined to say whether he would waive or fight extradition . &quot; If ( Famalaro ) doesn ' t waive extradition , then we will need a governor ' s warrant from California to send him back to Orange County , &quot; said Yavapai County Sheriff ' s Department spokeswoman Laurie Berra . &quot; that ' s normally a 90-day process . If he waives extradition , we ' ll just give him to the Costa Mesa detectives. &quot; Orange County officials and Costa Mesa police would be in_charge of arranging transportation for Famalaro , who would likely be handcuffed or shackled during the trip back by air or car . Berra said Yavapai County uses a small , propeller-driven plane to transport prisoners and said it could be made available to Orange County officials . Officials from the Orange County district_attorney ' s office are expected here today to discuss the jurisdictional question with Yavapai County authorities . Berra said she expected the issue to be settled by the end of the week . If Orange County authorities were to seek Famalaro ' s extradition , they would file a criminal complaint in Orange County Municipal Court and ask a judge to issue an arrest_warrant . Arizona authorities would then be notified of the warrant and would place a &quot; hold &quot; on Famalaro that would prevent him from being released , Orange County Assistant Dist . Atty . John L . Conley said . Next , Famalaro would be brought into court in Arizona and asked whether he wanted to waive or fight the extradition . If he chose to fight it , Orange County prosecutors would have to bring the complaint to Gov . Pete Wilson , who would then forward an extradition complaint to Arizona Gov . Fife Symington . Famalaro would then be arraigned in Arizona on a &quot; governor ' s warrant. &quot; A hearing would be held before an Arizona judge on the merits of the extradition request . Legal authorities said there are only a_few grounds , such_as mistaken identity , on which a judge could deny extradition . If the judge approves the extradition request , Famalaro would be transferred to Orange County , where he would be arraigned in municipal court on a murder_charge . &quot; It starts as if it were Day One and he was just arrested , &quot; Conley said . Either a preliminary hearing or grand_jury indictment would have to occur before Famalaro could be bound over to superior_court to face trial . &quot; Practically speaking , it ' s very rare that we have a problem with extradition , &quot; Conley said . He added that a person who fights extradition is generally &quot; putting_off the inevitable. &quot; Most states routinely abide_by the Uniform Criminal Extradition Act , but in rare instances a state refuses to comply , said Jack Luellen , adjunct professor of law at Western State University College of Law in Fullerton . New York , for example , has been embroiled in controversy in instances where it has refused to extradite an individual who faces the death_penalty in another state . New York Gov . Mario Cuomo is a staunch death_penalty foe . &quot; A lot of it depends_on the parties involved , &quot; Luellen said . Officials said there is no reason to believe Arizona would object to efforts to bring Famalaro back to California to stand trial . Arizona officials could either dismiss the indictment against Famalaro or stay the proceedings , the latter a precautionary measure in the event the case were later returned to Arizona , he said . Famalaro ' s case has highlighted differences between Arizona and California laws regarding the death_penalty . Kelly has said he believes it will be more difficult for Orange County prosecutors to secure a death_penalty conviction against Famalaro , but even if they were to do so , it is unlikely he would ever be put_to_death in California . There are 396 men and women on death row in California , but only two men have been put_to_death in the gas_chamber since the death_penalty was reinstated in 1977 . Arizona ' s death_penalty guidelines are seen as more lenient than California ' s . Arizona prosecutors must only prove a defendant committed a &quot; depraved , heinous &quot; killing before seeking the death_penalty . In contrast , California prosecutors must prove the slaying took_place during one or more so-called special circumstances , such_as rape or kidnaping . Orange County prosecutors admit that they do not have enough evidence yet to proceed with a death_penalty case against Famalaro .
