   <HEADLINE> GUARDS HUNT , KILL PREMIER IN RWANDA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Marauding presidential guards terrorized tiny , crowded , hapless Rwanda and killed its prime_minister and almost a dozen Belgian peacekeepers Thursday in a chaotic , murderous frenzy of revenge for the deaths of two Central African presidents . Shortly before she was hunted_down , Rwandan Prime_Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana told Radio France International : &quot; There is shooting . People are being terrorized . People are inside their homes lying on the floor . We are suffering the consequences of the death of the head of state. &quot; According to confusing , conflicting reports trickling in here and into U.N. headquarters , Kigali , the Rwandan capital , seemed caught in two ethnic battles : * An onslaught by extreme nationalists among the Hutu people taking_out their revenge on moderate Hutus for trying to reach a peace agreement with rebels of the minority Tutsi people . * A confrontation between the presidential guard and Tutsi rebels who had broken_out of their U.N.-protected camp to take_on the Hutu avengers . The turmoil endangered a U.N.-brokered peace process in Rwanda and raised fears of reigniting conflict in the interrelated , adjoining country of Burundi -- the site of terrible tribal slaughter , some of it akin to genocide , in the last two decades . Although numerous reports described the deaths of Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana and Burundian President Cyprian Ntayamira as assassinations , this could not be confirmed by official U.S. or U.N. sources . The two leaders , both Hutus , were killed when their plane burst into flames while landing at the Kigali airport Wednesday night . Two Burundian ministers , five Rwandan senior officials and a French air crew died with them . A Rwandan government official was quoted as insisting that two rockets had downed the plane . The Rwandan Ministry of Defense issued a statement describing the plane as &quot; shot down by unidentified elements in circumstances which are still not clear. &quot; But in Washington , State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry said , &quot; We don ' t know the cause of the crash . . . . Those reports have not been confirmed at this point. &quot; The United Nations has a force of 2 # 500 peacekeeping troops in Rwanda , and Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali offered its help in investigating the crash and restoring order . But the United Nations said Rwandan authorities had refused to allow the peacekeepers to examine the wreckage . U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said members of the presidential guard broke_into the presidential palace to seize the prime_minister , but she slipped_away while her hunters disarmed a U.N. guard . Members of the presidential guard are widely regarded_as extreme Hutu nationalists . Most Rwandans regarded the prime_minister as a moderate Hutu . The prime_minister , according to Eckhard , tried to take refuge in the compound that houses U.N. Development Program workers and U.N. Volunteers , a group of young people much like the Peace Corps . But the presidential guard broke_into the civilian U.N. compound and seized her before she could flee again . Eckhard said that some sources reported that she was shot on the spot while others reported her killed outside the compound . The United Nations said the presidential guard had also rounded_up several ministers and their families . Their fate was not known , but President Clinton , in a statement condemning the killing of the prime_minister , said , &quot; I am equally horrified that elements of the Rwandan security_forces have sought_out and murdered Rwandan officials. &quot; The husband and children of Prime_Minister Uwilingiyimana , however , were in U.N. protective custody , Eckhard said . Amid the violence , there were reports monitored in Nairobi , Kenya , that three Cabinet_ministers were abducted and 17 Jesuit Rwandan priests were killed . Amnesty International , the London-based human_rights organization , reported that two Rwandan human_rights activists -- Monique Mujawamaliya and Charles Shamukiga -- had been abducted . The Washington office of another international_organization , Human_Rights Watch , said Mujawamaliya was_on the phone with its staff_members when she reported that government troops were scouring her neighborhood . &quot; Please take_care of my children . I don ' t want you to hear this , &quot; she said before she hung_up . Human_Rights Watch said it fears she is dead . During the turmoil , 500 members of the mostly Tutsi Rwandan Patriotic Front broke_out of their U.N. camp in Kigali to battle the presidential guard . The battles were described as violent , although the number of casualties was not known . The RPF was in the camp as part of a peace agreement worked_out between the Hutu government and Tutsi rebels in Arusha , Tanzania , last August . In New York , U.N. spokesman Joe Sills reported that 10 Belgian peacekeepers had been killed during the fighting and an 11th body had not yet been identified . Rwanda and Burundi -- part of the German Empire before World_War I , then ruled by Belgium until independence in 1962 -- have emerged only recently from a feudal_system in which the tall Tutsis , only 10 % of the population in Rwanda and 15 % in Burundi , ruled as lords over the far more numerous Hutus . For centuries , Hutus farmed the land in exchange for protection from Tutsi masters . In Rwanda , a country of 8 million , Hutus have dominated the political_system since independence . But Tutsis , accusing President Habyarimana of repression since he took_over the government in a coup more_than 20 years ago , organized the RPF and provoked turmoil throughout the country in the last few years . In Burundi , a country of 6 million , the history of the Tutsi-Hutu conflict has been far more bitter . Tutsis ruled from independence until last June . In one of the most depressing eras of African history , Tutsis put_down a Hutu rebellion in 1972 and 1973 by trying to slaughter every Hutu with more_than a primary_school education . Perhaps 150 # 000 Hutus died in this terror . An election in June installed Melchior Ndadaye as the first Hutu to serve as Burundi ' s president . But the Tutsi-dominated army assassinated him last December , setting_off murderous waves of Tutsis and Hutus against each other . The death toll has reached 50 # 000 .</TEXT>
