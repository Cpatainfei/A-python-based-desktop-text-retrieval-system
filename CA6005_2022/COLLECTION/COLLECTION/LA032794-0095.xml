   <HEADLINE> THERE ' S MORE TO U.S.-CHINA TIES THAN HUMAN_RIGHTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The debate evoked by Secretary_of_State Warren M . Christopher ' s visit to Beijing has been too concerned with whether his mission had &quot; failed &quot; to promote human_rights . The issue is not whether the United States should abandon its pursuit of human_rights altogether , but how to pursue its values in balance with other aspects of the U.S.-China relationship . The fundamental motivation of U.S. human-rights policy rests deep within American tradition . No other nation has been so explicitly founded to vindicate liberty or been populated as extensively by refugees . This experience has infused U.S. foreign_policy with a missionary quality . Other nations need to take this attitude seriously ; to most Americans , the national interest cannot be separated from some concern for human_rights . Still , America ' s perception of itself as the defender of global human_rights is so ingrained that we too often forget how unique this perspective is compared with the way other nations view foreign_policy . Every other major country conceives foreign_policy as the balancing of risks and rewards to affect the actions of others . What Americans call human_rights has generally been deemed to fall within domestic jurisdictions . While the State_Department insists that it is only pressing the Chinese government to live_up_to the Universal Declaration of Human_Rights , the fact remains that no other signatory of that document has invoked it in its China policy . In short , the U.S. human-rights approach to China elicits next to no support from most other governments . Not a single Asian_nation supports it . A prickly insistence on sovereignty is a particular attribute of the Chinese government . In China , Western intervention is perceived as an uninterrupted humiliation since the Opium Wars . To base Sino-American relations entirely on Chinese progress toward human_rights will thus mortgage both the underlying relationship as well as progress on human_rights . It is also a distortion of reality , since U.S. objectives go beyond human-rights promotion . It has become commonplace to point_out that China has the world ' s fastest-growing economy and that its population of more_than 1 billion represents the single largest market . To exclude the United States from these prospects is not a trivial decision . More important , Asia is both the most dynamic region of the world and the one with the greatest potential to threaten world peace . Its nations have not developed the patterns of cooperation that emerged in Europe after World_War_II . Fostering an Asian equilibrium is therefore central to world peace and must be a key objective of U.S. diplomacy . The United States and China have a parallel interest in equilibrium . China wants the United States to help balance its relationships with powerful neighbors -- Japan , Russia and India -- until it is strong enough to do so on its own . The United States needs Chinese cooperation on these matters and on a peaceful evolution of the future of Taiwan , on nuclear proliferation in North_Korea and on the transfer of weapons technology . These are the sort of issues that should be key elements of the Sino-American dialogue . If they moved to the center of Sino-American relationships , they would facilitate human-rights issues by providing a strategic context . In the course of their history , China ' s leaders have frequently taken_account of the special needs of their counterparts provided such an action also served Chinese interests . The basic challenge remains : If the United States ' interest in China is primarily human_rights , the tactic of public pressures is appropriate . And it may even work . There is , however , a high risk of trapping both sides in a choice between capitulation and confrontation . The Administration may be tempted to continue watering_down its demands and its penalties until its apparent victories are largely public-relations exercises . The Chinese may repeat their self-inflicted wounds of the 1950s , when they expelled all Soviet advisers for being too intrusive . The victim of such a process will be the American-Chinese political relationship that is key to Asian stability . An alternative approach would not require the United States to abandon its reduced list of human-rights objectives , though some may have to be modified in the course of negotiations . It does , however , call_for clear presidential leadership outlining U.S. purposes and strategy with_respect_to China . Such a statement needs to set_forth the importance attached_to U.S.-China cooperation in specific areas and on specific topics ; it cannot merely be a shopping list of U.S. priorities . At the same time , such a document could emphasize the need for each side to take_into_account the special concerns of the other -- a phrase Beijing will surely understand as referring to U.S. human-rights concerns . A reduction of public pressures and a broadening of the dialogue will produce a solution compatible with the self-respect of both sides . Specifically : * China should understand that a concern for human_rights in some form is not an Administration idiosyncrasy but inherent in the American value system as expressed in congressional pressures . * The Administration should recognize that China ' s interest in U.S. relations is based on its expectation of cooperation on global or at least Asian strategy . For that objective , it may well be prepared to make human-rights concessions , provided they can be presented as having emerged from its own choice . * Congress should understand that , beyond a certain point , public pressures tend to produce the opposite of what is intended . Congressional concern has been clearly demonstrated ; the Administration should be permitted to pursue it quietly on its own . * The short-term objective of a renewed Sino-American dialogue should be to achieve sufficient progress_to enable the Administration to de-link human_rights from most-favored-nation trading status , once and for all . Afterward , the United States would pursue human-rights objectives in a manner compatible with Chinese dignity and via normal diplomatic processes within the context of an overall political and strategic dialogue . These goals are within reach provided the focus remains on fundamentals , especially on the importance of a constructive , long-term Sino-American relationship for both countries. *</TEXT>
