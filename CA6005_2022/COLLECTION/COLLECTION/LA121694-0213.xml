   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY ; A BIT OF GOOD NEWS ; DROP IN RATES HELPS GET BOND LIQUIDATION OFF TO STRONG START</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The liquidation of $ 7.96 billion in bonds owned by Orange County ' s bankrupt investment fund got_off to a strong start Thursday , helped by rising expectations that the Federal_Reserve_Board will defer further credit-tightening moves until next year . Salomon Bros. , the brokerage managing the liquidation , said it sold county-owned U.S._government bonds with a face_value of $ 483 million in a wide-open auction that attracted $ 7.5 billion in bids . A sharp decline in shorter-term market interest_rates Thursday gave Salomon a tail wind in unloading the bonds , which were conventional issues maturing in 2 1 / 2 to four years . Analysts said the bond market was cheered by two economic reports suggesting that the pace of growth is slowing . That may allow the Fed to delay another hike in short-term interest_rates , which many analysts had expected would come when central_bank policy-makers meet next week . As shorter-term market interest_rates eased Thursday , bidders for the county ' s bonds were willing to accept lower yields than they would have demanded a_few days ago , traders said . Lower yields translated into higher prices paid_for the bonds , which puts more cash back into the devastated investment fund . Salomon said the bonds fetched between 89.5 cents and 94.5 cents per dollar of face_value . &quot; We were very pleased with demand , &quot; one Salomon trader said . However , those prices were below the average value of 95.5 cents on the dollar that Salomon ascribed to the &quot; conventional &quot; part of the bond portfolio on Monday . At the time , many Wall_Street analysts said Salomon ' s valuation of the portfolio seemed optimistic . Nonetheless , Wall_Street traders at rival brokerages said the prices paid in Thursday ' s auction were far better than the market had expected . &quot; These prices are_on the moon , &quot; a trader at a Salomon competitor said . The bonds ' prices were at a discount to their face_value of 100 cents on the dollar because the securities had been issued at significantly lower interest_rates over the last two years . When purchased by the county fund , the annualized fixed-rate yields on the bonds were in the 4 % -to-5.7 % range . On Thursday , the discounted prices paid by the buyers translated into annualized yields of 7.90 % to 8.02 % , returns that take_into_account the interest coupon and the capital_gain when the bond matures at full face_value . Wall_Street ' s measure of the success of such an auction is the extent to which yields on these U.S._government agency_securities top the yields available on bonds issued directly by the U.S. Treasury . Because U.S._government agency_securities , such_as bonds issued by the Federal Home_Loan_Bank System , are considered slightly riskier than direct obligations of the Treasury , the former pay yields above those on comparable-maturity Treasury_bonds . But that yield spread can vary . In Thursday ' s auction , the average yields demanded by buyers ranged from 0.24 point to 0.365 point above the market yield on the three-year Treasury_note , which Salomon set at 7.657 % at midafternoon . Traders said investors ' willingness to buy the bonds at those spreads represented a significant improvement in the market from last week -- when the county fund ' s creditor brokerages were liquidating $ 11.5 billion in similar government_agency bonds they held as collateral for loans to the fund . Yields on U.S. agency bonds shot_up to as much as 0.65 point above comparable Treasury yields last week , at the height of the collateral selloff , traders said . &quot; Anyone who bought last week now is looking_like a genius , &quot; one bond trader said . The implication is that the brokerages that dumped the collateral bonds last week were doing so at &quot; fire_sale &quot; prices , some traders said . That could boost the county ' s legal case against the brokerages : The county has sued one brokerage , Nomura Securities , and has pledged to sue the others on the grounds that they illegally seized and sold the collateral bonds . The brokerages argue that they were within their rights to sell the collateral after the county defaulted_on loan payments . Traders said a big reason Thursday ' s sale went well is that the market trusts that Salomon ' s auction of the Orange County portfolio will be orderly , as has been pledged by former state_Treasurer Thomas W . Hayes , who is overseeing county finances . In contrast , the bond market was fraught with uncertainty last week as the collateral bonds were liquidated and as traders guessed about the future of the rest of the portfolio . Salomon officials said Thursday that they plan to sell another $ 566 million of county-owned bonds today . Like the securities sold Thursday , those auctioned today will be conventional fixed-rate bonds , though they mature further in the future : 1999 , 2001 and 2004 . Salomon ' s biggest challenge lies ahead : unloading the $ 4.7 billion in complicated derivative bonds that make_up the bulk of the remaining portfolio . Sources say those securities could be sold via auctions -- with the most likely buyers major brokerages such_as J.P. Morgan Securities -- but are more likely to be unloaded through restructurings negotiated with the government_agencies that issued them . Analysts say that by renegotiating or liquidating the bonds with those agencies , such_as the Federal Home_Loan_Bank System and the Student Loan Marketing Assn. , Salomon should be able to wring more value out of the bonds than it could by selling on Wall_Street . The agencies themselves , all_of which say they have already been contacted by Salomon , are expected to cooperate in renegotiations , though they have indicated they will not offer the county fund any type of deal that could be construed as a bailout . * BROAD INVESTIGATION SEC probes possible influence peddling in county government .
