   <HEADLINE> SECURITY PLAN DRAWS SKEPTICISM FROM THE BATTLE-WEARY IN HEBRON ; MIDEAST : STILL REELING FROM MOSQUE MASSACRE , MANY CONSIDER OUTSIDE OBSERVERS ' USELESS. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mustafa Tamimi ' s gnarled fingers moved faster and faster over his prayer beads Thursday as he sat outside his curfew-bound fruit shop . The 50-year-old Palestinian ' s voice grew thin and his anger boiled_over as he recalled each detail of the morning five weeks ago that thrust this desperate , seething town onto the center stage of the Mideast peace process . Tamimi recalled how he was there , kneeling in prayer in the first row of Ibrahim Mosque , when more_than 100 bullets from a Jewish settler ' s assault_rifle tore_into his relatives , his friends , his fellow worshipers and very nearly him . This was the massacre committed by Baruch Goldstein , the Brooklyn-born physician who killed about 30 Palestinians before Tamimi ' s eyes in Hebron ' s Cave of the Patriarchs . And then , Tamimi laughed . Against such firepower , such hate and such helplessness , he concluded , the 160-member international observer force that Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization agreed to send here Thursday -- part of a breakthrough agreement aimed at &quot; creating a feeling of security among Palestinians in Hebron &quot; -- was , in fact , a joke . &quot; It is useless that they ' re coming here , &quot; Tamimi said of the force of Norwegians , Danes and Italians , who the agreement states will be armed with revolvers yet no mandate to act . &quot; I am the first one who will say they are welcome . But this is not enough . This is not what we want . Against these settlers , against their machine_guns , against the Israeli army , this will not help us. &quot; No sooner had Tamimi finished saying that than reality caught_up_with him again . An Israeli army patrol , which was stoned as it sped past his shop , slammed_on its brakes . Half a dozen soldiers waved M-16 assault_rifles as they scoured the street . Within seconds they led a single Palestinian off to prison , with Tamimi chasing behind . &quot; Hamzeh ! Hamzeh ! Hamzeh ! &quot; Tamimi shouted through tears as he ran after the speeding van . The prisoner was , in fact , Tamimi ' s youngest son . He is 7 years old . Such were the scenes and the mood of rejection , anger and despair as Hebron ' s more_than 100 # 000 Palestinians reacted with fury , laughter and lament to an unprecedented compromise -- the first time in more_than two decades of occupation that Israel agreed to Palestinian demands for an international , U.N.-sanctioned presence in the West_Bank or Gaza Strip . The security agreement for Hebron broke new ground for the PLO , its leaders and the peace process as_a_whole . It cleared the way for Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat to send negotiators back to formal talks on Palestinian autonomy for the first time since the mosque massacre . And it brought vows from both sides to speed the process of implementing a long-delayed promise for Israeli withdrawal and Palestinian self-rule in the occupied Gaza Strip and the West_Bank town of Jericho . But for Hebron , where the Feb . 25 massacre left wounds that remain as deep as they are fresh , the prospect of an observer force hardly allayed fears . For most Palestinians and Jews in Hebron , the security plan served only to deepen the sense of foreboding here , where residents , for more_than a month , have lived with heavy curfews and a constant threat of revenge . Hebron is , after all , a hotbed of Palestinian radicalism , where 415 heavily armed Jewish settlers live_in an enclave surrounded by more_than 100 # 000 mostly unarmed Arabs ; the Arabs , in turn , live adjacent to a sprawling settlement of more_than 4 # 500 more heavily armed Jews . But in a city overwhelmingly opposed to Arafat and the peace process , a handful of local PLO leaders struggled to find victory in Thursday ' s agreement . Chief among them was Mustafa Abdul Nabi Natshe , Hebron ' s former mayor , whom Arafat reappointed to his post on Thursday . The latest accord &quot; is a good step_forward , &quot; he said in an interview in his Hebron home . &quot; It is a first step. &quot; He reflected the universal sentiment of his city that Arafat was wise_to drop his demand for a Palestinian police contingent that would have served under Israeli command here , noting : &quot; If there is a Palestine police_force here , I don ' t want it to be a show. &quot; Although leaders of Arafat ' s Islamic fundamentalist opponents , in parties such_as Hamas , declared the international force was &quot; like a watchdog in chains , &quot; its most virulent opposition came from the Jewish settlement on the_hill high above , from the heart of the former home of the doctor who staged last month ' s bloody massacre . There , at the fiercely ideological settlement of Kiryat Arba , as_many as 20 # 000 extremist Jews from settlements and towns throughout Israel marched a mile -- in celebration and in protest . In an afternoon rally to commemorate 26 years of Jewish settlements in a city that the Bible records as the first capital of the Israelite community in Canaan , and to protest any government effort to evacuate Israeli settlers from the center of town , speakers denounced the new international force . &quot; It ' s an un-Zionist act to bring a foreign force into Hebron , &quot; Benjamin Netanyahu , chairman of Israel ' s right-wing opposition Likud , shouted to a cheering audience waving Israeli flags and posters declaring Hebron part of Israel . &quot; There will be much blood spilled here ! Jewish blood will be spilled ! &quot; screamed Shlomo Goren , a former chief rabbi of Israel who pushed for a controversial religious ruling this week instructing Israeli soldiers to disobey any orders to evacuate Hebron settlers by force -- a plan now before Rabin ' s Cabinet as a more permanent solution to Hebron ' s security woes . &quot; We won ' t move ! We won ' t move from the heart of Hebron ! &quot; In the crowd , Ephraim Ziv , a Brooklyn-born lawyer , explained the settlers ' opposition to the new foreign force . He did so in terms remarkably similar to those of Palestinian critics . &quot; This international force reminds us of the ( U.N. ) force in Lebanon -- they ' re going to need soldiers to protect them , &quot; Ziv said , adding that he believes the planned Hebron contingent is too small , too lightly armed and too powerless to be anything more_than a target . &quot; They invite Arab terrorists to put_on a show for them . This new force won ' t calm_down the situation . They incite the situation. &quot; Radical Palestinian leaders echoed the arguments against the force made by settlers , who the Palestinians demand must be moved before any permanent security is achieved in a city sacred to Muslims and Jews . &quot; People here were looking_for a real force to protect them and separate the two communities , &quot; said Abdul Aziz Dweik , a U.S.-educated Hebron geology professor who was deported by Israel as a suspected Hamas leader and spent a year of exile on a barren hillside in a no-man ' s-land in South Lebanon until he was permitted to return home_in December . &quot; These people ( the international observers ) will just watch and report what happens , but they will have no mandate to actually protect the people. &quot; On Hebron ' s streets , where scores of Palestinian youths have been killed or injured in almost daily clashes with Israeli troops since the massacre , many Palestinians said the observer force will undermine security and stability here rather than safeguard it . &quot; When these guys come here , they will not help the situation ; they will aggravate it , &quot; said a 20-year-old factory_worker who asked to be identified only as Bassam . &quot; Look , we don ' t want international forces . We don ' t want Israeli forces . We don ' t want Arafat . We don ' t want anybody . All of this only means more massacres and death . We only want all_the settlers to leave Hebron . We want the Israeli troops out of the occupied lands . And then we can take_care of ourselves. &quot;</TEXT>
