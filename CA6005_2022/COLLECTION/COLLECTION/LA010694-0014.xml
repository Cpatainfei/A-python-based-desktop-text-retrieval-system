   <TEXT> The U . S . Department_of_Agriculture , the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers_for_Disease_Control and Prevention have issued numerous recommendations for the general public on how to avoid food-borne bacteria .

Several additional recommendations were added for high-risk groups . * General Public Advisory : * Select dairy_products , raw_meat , poultry , eggs and seafood last when grocery shopping . Go directly home after food shopping and store perishables in the refrigerator or freezer immediately . * Keep raw foods and cooked foods separate when shopping and during refrigeration , preparation and cooking of foods .
