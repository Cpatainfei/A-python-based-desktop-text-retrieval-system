   <HEADLINE> AIRLINER MAKES EMERGENCY LANDING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Southwest Airlines plane made an emergency_landing at Burbank Airport on Saturday morning after the pilot reported mysterious fumes that forced several passengers to be treated for irritation in their eyes and throats , an airline spokesman said . Some of the 54 passengers aboard Flight 1067 , which originated from Oakland Airport , noticed fumes toward the rear of the cabin about 10:50 a.m. , while the aircraft was 30 miles north of Burbank , its destination.The pilot then radioed to request clearance for an emergency_landing . &quot; It ' s a mystery , &quot; said Tim Myers , a spokesman for Southwest Airlines . &quot; At this point , we do not know what caused the fumes. &quot; After the 737-300 model carrier landed safely , airport paramedics treated an undisclosed number of passengers with oxygen and several others for reports of chest_pain or burning eyes and throats . No one was hospitalized . While first reports described smoke in the cockpit of the airliner , technicians checked the equipment and found no irregularities , Myers said . Ground officials speculated that a passenger might have been carrying a Mace or aerosol-spray container that discharged during the flight . &quot; That is why aerosol containers aren ' t allowed on board aircraft in the first place , &quot; said Jim Mayfield , operations supervisor for the Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport Authority . &quot; There are constant pressure changes during flight , and if these containers leak , their contents can be spread through the craft ' s air-conditioning system. &quot; Airline officials said the plane would remain grounded Saturday while investigators looked_into the origin of the fumes .</TEXT>
