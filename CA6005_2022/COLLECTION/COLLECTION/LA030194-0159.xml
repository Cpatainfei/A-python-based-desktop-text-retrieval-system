   <HEADLINE> ISRAELI MILITARY CLAMPS_DOWN LID ON 1.25 MILLION IN OCCUPIED LANDS ; CURFEW : UNREST CONTINUES IN WEST_BANK AND GAZA , HOWEVER , LEAVING TWO DEAD . PROTESTS ALSO ERUPT IN ISRAEL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Israeli military authorities , trying to curtail Palestinian protests over the massacre of Muslim worshipers in Hebron last week , on Monday ordered more_than 1.25 million residents of the occupied West_Bank and Gaza Strip to remain in their homes . But the sweeping curfew , imposed on almost every Arab city , town and refugee camp in the two regions , failed to halt the unrest as youths attacked army patrols , blocked roads with burning tires and stoned cars . Two men -- one a 65-year-old walking to a Hebron mosque to pray , the other a young lawyer going_to court in Nablus -- were killed as Israeli troops opened_fire in clashes with demonstrators . Violent protests also continued in Israel itself as Israeli Arabs in Nazareth and towns in the Galilee region demonstrated for the third day in solidarity with the Palestinians . Police arrested 52 people in Nazareth after rioters attacked Jewish motorists and stoned government_offices and banks . Thousands of Israeli Arabs attended the funeral , conducted under Palestinian flags and anti-Israeli slogans , of a Bedouin killed by police Sunday , the first Israeli Arab to die in clashes with police since 1976 . Police were ordered out of the town in the Negev_Desert for the funeral , and no violence was reported . Israel ' s Parliament , the Knesset , overwhelmingly approved a resolution strongly condemning the Hebron massacre carried_out by an Israeli settler , a Brooklyn-born physician from the extremist Kach movement , who killed 48 Muslims as they knelt in prayer before he was overpowered and killed himself . &quot; As a Jew , as an Israeli , as a man and as a human_being , I am ashamed for the disgrace imposed upon us by a degenerate murderer , &quot; Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin told the Knesset as he provided details on the incident , the government ' s crackdown on Kach and other extremist groups and its efforts to salvage the peace talks with the Palestine Liberation Organization . &quot; This murderer came_out of a small and marginal political context , &quot; Rabin said . &quot; He grew in a swamp whose murderous sources . . . are foreign to Judaism -- they are not ours . &quot; To him and those like him , we say : ' You are not part of the community of Israel . You are not part of the national democratic camp . . . . You are not partners in the Zionist enterprise . . . . Sensible Judaism spits you out . You placed yourself outside the wall of the Jewish law . You are a shame on Zionism and an embarrassment to Judaism , ' &quot; Rabin said . With detention orders authorized by the Cabinet , security police are searching for four leading figures in Kach and its affiliates ; one settler has already been detained without trial for three months . The army is preparing to restrict the movements and activities of 15 other settlers and to disarm 20 more . Kach will probably be outlawed as well , Rabin said . &quot; We are proud_of our democracy -- there are few like it in the world , &quot; he said . &quot; We will not allow anyone in Israel or in the territories under its control . . . to determine or change the policy of the government by blackmail or the trigger and false messianic claims . &quot; No political_movement , secular or religious , no pressure_group will dare raise its hand against democracy here , &quot; he said . &quot; We as a government will stand like a wall and will vigorously employ all legal means , even if it requires force , to resist such an attempt. &quot; But some Cabinet members believe that even stronger measures are required .</TEXT>
