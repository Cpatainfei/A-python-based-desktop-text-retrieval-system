   <HEADLINE> FUTURE LOOKS CLOUDY FOR BELEAGUERED CHINA AIRLINES ; TRANSPORTATION : OVERCAPACITY IN THE REGION AND TOUGHER COMPETITION ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE IN ' 95 , THE CARRIER SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When a group of war veterans set_up Taiwan ' s China Airlines 37 years ago , all they had was $ 10 # 000 and contacts with former air_force comrades in the government . &quot; They didn ' t even have a license to fly down the coast to Hualien , &quot; said Lodge Lo , the airline ' s spokesman . &quot; They thought they were running a taxi company. &quot; The airline was to become one of the most profitable in the world . But now , at the end of a disastrous year , shareholders may wish they had invested in something less risky . &quot; It ' s been a very , very bad year , &quot; Lo said , shaking his head . &quot; We don ' t think we will go_into the red , but profits will be very , very small. &quot; In 1993 , CAL made $ 119 million after taxes on revenue of $ 1.67 billion . Its 1994 profit may fall to $ 15.3 million on revenue of about $ 1.53 billion , Lo said . * The bad_luck started in November , 1993 , when a CAL Boeing 747 crashed in Hong Kong Harbor during a landing attempt . Miraculously , no one was killed . Then last April , a CAL Airbus exploded on landing at Nagoya , Japan , and 264 of the 271 people on board died . The airline set_aside $ 156 # 000 for each family in compensation . A different kind of disaster struck in March , when 24 Taiwanese tourists were killed in an arson and robbery in China . The crime prompted Taiwanese tour groups to boycott China , and traffic levels on the airline ' s highly lucrative Hong Kong route took a steep dive . CAL says the problems are likely to continue next year because of overcapacity in the region and tougher competition . &quot; All we can say is that we are confident we won ' t be in the red , &quot; Lo said . Analysts warn that the worst may be yet to come when , in 1997 , the_British colony becomes part of China again . The Taiwanese government bans direct transport links and official relations with mainland_China , so CAL could be hard-pressed to continue the Hong Kong route , analysts say . CAL flies that route 204 times a week . * &quot; The Hong Kong-to-Taipei route accounts_for 15 % of their revenue , but 25 % to 30 % of earnings , &quot; said Christine Lee , who follows the airline for Barings Securities . Flights to and from Japan accounted_for 20 % of revenue , the airline reported last year . Flights to Hong Kong , Singapore , Bangkok and other Southeast_Asia cities accounted_for 42 % . Taipei has said it will consider Hong Kong a special region of China after 1997 , and will attach special conditions to dealing with Hong Kong . Nevertheless , Taiwan ' s legislators will need some fancy footwork to maintain the myth of no direct transport links with China while allowing CAL and other carriers to fly into Hong Kong after 1997 . They will also have to get_around the current ban on official talks if they are to negotiate with China on landing rights for Hong Kong after 1997 , analysts said . Lo said Hong Kong plans to extend the current landing rights , due_to expire in 1995 , until 1997 only . The crucial post-1997 rights for Taipei will have to be hammered_out with Beijing . &quot; All these rules have to be untangled and we have to find a way through , &quot; Lo said . * Paradoxically , behind the bleak prospects in Hong Kong lies a tantalizing scenario : Taiwan may open_up direct links with Chinese cities on the mainland . Some tentative steps_in this direction have already been taken , with Taipei commissioning non-government reports on the subject . CAL has sent teams to survey facilities at airfields in Beijing , Shanghai , Guangzhou and Chengdu , Lo said . Up-and-coming rival EVA Airways , a subsidiary of the huge Evergreen shipping group , is also positioning itself for a shot at what promise to be highly profitable direct mainland routes , analysts said .</TEXT>
