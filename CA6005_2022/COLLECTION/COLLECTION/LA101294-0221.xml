   <HEADLINE> DOCUMENT VIEWERS MAKE IT EASIER TO SHOW AND TELL_ON THE INTERNET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For all_the chatter about information superhighways and how communications technologies are changing the world , cyberspace today remains a &quot; words only &quot; domain . You want to send e-mail via Prodigy ? No problem . You want to exchange memos on the Internet ? Fine . But as soon as you try to view pictures or graphics -- never mind videos or animation or sound clips -- on a public communications network , everything slows to a crawl . To make matters worse , there is little agreement on formats for viewing pictures and graphics . Some would argue that this won ' t be solved until that ubiquitous workhorse of on-line communications -- the phone_line -- is replaced by fiber-optic cable or a two-way cable TV hookup . But several emerging technologies offer more immediate hope . A class of &quot; portable-document viewer &quot; software , which allows you to view documents as they would appear on a printed page , has gained great popularity in the past year , and some of the products are beginning to migrate to the Internet . A small Huntington Beach company called Telegrafix Communications is having great success with a program called Ripscrip ( for Remote Imaging Protocol Script Language ) , a simple language for transmitting graphics over a variety of networks . It already enjoys wide support on electronic_bulletin_boards , which often serve as on-ramps to the Internet , and businesses are putting it to work . &quot; Realtors can show houses with it , &quot; says Wendy Erdtsieck of Telegrafix . &quot; Imagine sitting in Connecticut , looking_at houses in California . Catalogue stores -- home shopping -- are also using it. &quot; Ripscrip ' s claim to fame lies_in the speed at which it shuttles big graphics files , thanks to a crafty and highly efficient compression scheme . But to use Ripscrip , both the sender and the receiver must have the software . By contrast , the portable document viewers permit any document to be converted into the format for transmission over networks , and the receiver need only have simple viewing software , which is often free . Adobe System ' s Acrobat Exchange is perhaps the best known of these , although No Hands Software ' s Common_Ground and Farallon Computing ' s Replica share most of Acrobat ' s capabilities . Last year , the Clinton_Administration released its federal budget across the Internet using Acrobat . Apple Computer is trying to introduce its own standard for portable documents in its latest Macintosh system software . Hundreds of businesses would welcome any standard at this point . Ideally , insurance_claims adjusters would be able to calculate a damage estimate anywhere by browsing through a catalogue of parts located in a central_office . And doctors could review surgical_procedures from medical libraries on a different continent . The investment house J.P. Morgan , for example , uses Acrobat on its network to share analyst reports among executives . Were Acrobat to become the Internet standard , for example , it could share those reports electronically -- with clients , anywhere in the world -- at enormous cost savings . Because those reports contain proprietary , often highly_sensitive information , analysts won ' t transmit them to public or corporate fax machines . But even Acrobat does not solve the speed problem . That may have to wait until cable TV systems -- or a far more advanced type of telephone transmission service -- can be used for computer communications . Cable can traffic data 50 times as fast as a phone_line , and 60 million U.S. homes already subscribe .</TEXT>
