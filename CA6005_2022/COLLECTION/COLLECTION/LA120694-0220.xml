   <HEADLINE> NO INJURIES AS 3 QUAKES HIT VALLEY ; AFTERSHOCKS : SEISMOLOGISTS RECORD THE TEMBLORS ' MAGNITUDES AT 3.5 , 3.0 AND 4.5 AND PLACE THE EPICENTERS EAST OF THE CITY OF SAN FERNANDO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three aftershocks of the Jan . 17 Northridge quake bumped and rolled through the San Fernando Valley within minutes of each other Monday night , sending_out shock_waves felt throughout the Los Angeles area . No serious damage or injuries were reported . The first quake , a magnitude 3.5 , was centered three miles east_northeast of San Fernando at 7:36 p.m. , said Caltech seismologist Kate Hutton . The second , a magnitude 3.0 , struck the same area at 7:48 p.m. , followed seconds later by a magnitude 4.5 , centered three miles east of San Fernando , Hutton said . The temblors occurred &quot; in a very active part of the Northridge aftershock zone , &quot; she said . She characterized the temblors as a &quot; sequence within a sequence , &quot; meaning that while all_of them were aftershocks of the Northridge quake , the smaller quakes Monday night were &quot; foreshocks , &quot; a prelude to the third and biggest one . &quot; Anytime we have a quake in Southern California , there is a 5 % chance that it will be followed by a bigger quake , &quot; Hutton said . Although there has been a &quot; fairly steady decline &quot; in frequency of aftershocks since the initial series ended in January , such aftershocks could continue for at least two years , she said , &quot; so it ' s not surprising to us at all to find this kind of activity going_on right now. &quot; Monday ' s was the 57th aftershock of 4.0 or greater since January , she said . The quakes were felt from the Santa Clarita Valley on the north to Venice and into southeastern Los Angeles County and westward through Ventura County to Oxnard , authorities said . The strongest quake emptied the 600-seat theater of the Television Academy of Arts and Sciences in North Hollywood , where several hundred people rushed_out of a special Disney anniversary screening , said Jerry Ough , who was there . Some theater patrons returned a_few minutes later , he said . The temblor also shook_up Christmas shopping crowds at Northridge Fashion Center , where repair work_on heavy damage by the January quake is still under way . &quot; The place was packed , &quot; one woman told television_station KCAL . &quot; When the earthquake hit , I just started shaking and everyone just headed for the doors. &quot; Some reported the strongest quake as sharp . Others said it had a rolling , wavy effect . Emma-Ruth Nehus of Granada Hills , a_few miles from the epicenter , said the second aftershock felt much larger than the scientists said . &quot; It felt_like at least a 5.0 here . My chandelier was swinging at least eight inches , &quot; Nehus said . &quot; We had $ 100 # 000 worth of damage from the last earthquake . I ' m 70 years old I don ' t want to spend the rest of my life rebuilding the house from the earthquakes. &quot; However , she said her house was not damaged Monday . In Winnetka , Pamela Castruita filled her flashlight with batteries and checked on her family ' s water_supply as soon as the first shaker hit . &quot; My husband thought I was nuts , but I was scared , &quot; said Castruita . &quot; Then the next one hit and we all ran outside and checked with the neighbors. &quot; Telephone_service in the San Fernando Valley was briefly interrupted after the temblor but the problem was too many people trying to make calls , not mechanical damage to the system , said Linda Bonniksen , spokeswoman for Pacific Bell . &quot; Everyone picks_up the phone and we get heavy network congestion , &quot; said Bonniksen . &quot; It happens after every earthquake. &quot; There were no reports of problems with any Metrolink trains or stations , said Peter Hidalgo , Metrolink spokesman . Because the temblor was less than a 5.0 , &quot; there will be no significant evaluation of the rail system. &quot; &quot; Only when it is 5.0 will all trains cease and all our inspectors inspect the entire 346-mile network , which takes about three hours to do , &quot; he said . Two late evening trains , one traveling from Los Angeles to Santa Clarita , and the other from Los Angeles to San Bernardino , continued with no delays . Southern Pacific Railroad officials also reported no problems or delays in their schedule . Burbank Airport reported no interference with normal operations .
