   <HEADLINE> MORE PROSECUTORIAL FIREPOWER ; L.A. REGION GAINS 18 FEDERAL ATTORNEYS , BUT MANY MORE STILL ARE NEEDED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Overworked federal prosecutors finally are going_to get a little help . Atty . Gen . Janet Reno has authorized 18 additional attorneys and six new support staff_members for the Central California office , which is based in Los Angeles and serves a massive jurisdiction -- Los Angeles , Orange , Riverside and four other counties . The new hires are long overdue . U.S. Atty . Nora M . Manella made a good case for the additional prosecutors . Her request received backing in Washington from Sen . Dianne Feinstein ( D-Calif. ) and Rep . Gary A . Condit ( D-Ceres ) . The two were successful in lobbying Reno to boost the number of prosecutors across the state . A few more were designated for Sacramento and San Diego , but it was Los Angeles that benefited most . Based on population , the amount of crime and just plain fairness , even more are needed in the Los Angeles jurisdiction . The jurisdiction also requires a boost because of the tough and complicated cases frequently prosecuted , such_as the Charles Keating investment fraud , the civil_rights case stemming from the police beating of Rodney G . King and the case involving a white separatist plot to blow_up Los Angeles ' First African Methodist Episcopal Church and Orange County synagogues . Add_to those challenges the region ' s huge increase in drug cases . New York and Miami have similar crime problems and similarly rigorous federal case lists filled with drug trafficking , bank fraud , tax_evasion and immigration abuse . But those jurisdictions boast one prosecutor for every 25 # 000 people , while the L.A. district must make_do with one prosecutor for every 91 # 000 people . That disparity discourages equal enforcement of the law . The newly approved increase in prosecutors is also a recognition of the numerous cases that the Los Angeles office had been forced to decline because of the severe staff shortage , among them repeat violent offenses , environmental crime , health_care fraud and financial scams . Equal justice requires an equal potential for prosecution across the nation . That will require still more federal prosecutors in Los Angeles .</TEXT>
