   <HEADLINE> DAMAGED DNA IS KEY TO TANNING , SCIENTISTS SAY ; HEALTH : REPORT IS KEY STEP IN UNDERSTANDING THE PROCESS . RESEARCHERS HOPE TO BEGIN TESTING A CHEMICAL THAT COULD TRIGGER DARKENING OF THE SKIN WITHOUT HARMING CELLS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For sun-worshiping Southern Californians , there is bad news and good news about tanning today . The bad news is that a so-called &quot; healthy &quot; tan is actually strong evidence that DNA in the skin has been severely damaged , researchers have found . The hitherto little-understood tanning process is actually triggered when the body begins repairing DNA damaged by ultraviolet_radiation , a team from Boston University reports today in the_British journal Nature . That repair process initiates the production of melanin , the chemical that causes skin to darken protectively . Although much of the damage is successfully repaired , defective DNA accumulates over time , leading eventually to the development of skin_cancer , including its most deadly form , a tumor known as melanoma . Skin_cancer is by far the most common form of the disease , with 700 # 000 cases per year in the United States , compared to 1.2 million cases for all other forms combined . Melanoma , accounting_for 27 # 500 cases per year , is the fastest-increasing form of cancer , with experts predicting that by early in the next century , one in every 90 people will develop it . All forms of skin_cancer are closely associated with exposure to sunlight and tanning . The good news is that the team has found that a simple DNA fragment spread on the skin can trigger melanin production -- at least in mouse and guinea_pig skin -- and for the first time produce a natural tan without damaging DNA in cells . Existing tanning lotions simply stain or dye the skin , providing a cosmetic tan but no protection against the sun . The Boston University researchers hope to begin testing the preparation on humans early next year after they receive approval from the university bioethics committee . Despite Americans ' fascination with a good tan , almost nothing has been known about how tans develop . Today ' s report marks a major step toward understanding the process , even though the precise details are not known , said Dr. Barbara A . Gilchrest of Boston University . What the researchers were able to show , in mouse skin_cells and guinea_pig skin grown in the laboratory , is that tanning is not triggered until DNA damage is produced by sunlight and repair of the damage has begun . &quot; It may_not be the only trigger for tanning , but it is certainly the most important one , &quot; said Gilchrest ' s colleague , biologist Mark S . Eller . &quot; Our finding suggests that tanning may be part of an SOS response of the skin to UV damage , &quot; Gilchrest said . While the researchers were attempting to tease out the mechanism for tanning , they began looking_for other , safer ways to trigger the process . Reasoning that it began in response to broken DNA , they tried applying a small DNA fragment -- called dipyrimidine dithymidylic acid -- to the cells . Sure enough , the cells began producing melanin and got darker . Although the chemical has never been tested on humans , &quot; we have no reason to think that it would be unsafe , &quot; Eller said . And because it is not part of the cell ' s own DNA , there is no risk of cancer .</TEXT>
