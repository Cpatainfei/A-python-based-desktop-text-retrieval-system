   <TEXT> PEOPLE WATCH Happy Birthday , Sir John : British actor Sir John Gielgud celebrated his 90th birthday Thursday at_home in his elegant 17th-Century mansion northwest of London . He turned_down a proposed West_End theatrical tribute that had included talk_of naming a theater after him , and instead spent the day quietly with his longtime companion Martin Hensler . Earlier this week , Gielgud , who made his theatrical debut in 1921 and was knighted in 1953 , said : &quot; I ' d much rather work and show I can still do a bit , rather than just get congratulations on the past . ( Such congratulations ) would rather sound like my obituary. &quot; Gielgud recently played King Lear in a new radio version of the Shakespeare play broadcast last Sunday by the BBC . He won an Academy Award in 1981 as the butler to Dudley Moore ' s &quot; Arthur. &quot; POP / ROCK Nirvana Sales Soar : As expected , last Friday ' s news of Nirvana leader Kurt Cobain ' s death by a self-inflicted shotgun blast triggered a sales run_on Nirvana ' s music at retail outlets across the nation . The Seattle power trio ' s &quot; In Utero &quot; album , released last summer , shot to No . 27 on this week ' s pop chart , selling more_than 40 # 000 copies -- twice what it sold the previous week . And sales of the group ' s 1991 breakthrough &quot; Nevermind &quot; album tripled to 20 # 000 units , as did sales for its first album , &quot; Bleach , &quot; which sold 9 # 500 copies . Nirvana ' s &quot; Incesticide &quot; EP sold 8 # 300 copies -- quadruple what it sold the week before Cobain ' s suicide . The figures are for the week ending last Sunday , and reflect only those units sold during the three days immediately following news of Cobain ' s suicide . Industry insiders expect next week ' s Nirvana sales figures to jump even higher . Also expected to do_well next week is the new album by Cobain ' s widow , Courtney Love , and her band Hole . * Justices Reject Lyric Ban : A Washington state law designed to keep children from buying recordings that contain &quot; erotic &quot; lyrics is unconstitutional because it infringes on the free-speech rights of adults , that state ' s Supreme Court ruled Thursday . The law was approved in 1992 but never went_into effect because of a lawsuit filed on behalf of dozens of musicians , record companies and the Recording Industry Assn . of America . The law proposed that county prosecutors ask judges to rule on individual recordings , which would then be labeled &quot; adults only &quot; if they were found to appeal_to minors ' prurient interests and offend community standards . The court found the law unconstitutionally broad because distributors across the state would be subject_to injunctions whenever a recording was challenged . Such injunctions would amount to prior restraint and violate the music sellers ' right_to_due_process , the court ruled . * Eagles to Play MTV : The Eagles will kick_off their much-publicized summer reunion tour with two shows to be taped April 25 and 26 at Burbank ' s Warner Bros . Studios for a late summer MTV special . The televised &quot; intimate concert performance &quot; will feature Glenn Frey , Don Henley , Don Felder , Joe Walsh and Timothy B . Schmit performing classic Eagles hits , plus some new material .

The orchestra will also vacate the Music Center ' s Dorothy Chandler Pavilion for two weeks in November for stops in Mexico_City , Washington and New York . TV &amp; RADIO New Quake Reporting Technology : KTTV Channel 11 will be the first TV_station in the country to use a new system of immediate earthquake notification . Beginning at the end of this month , the Fox station ' s news department will use the California Institute of Technology / U.S. Geological Survey Broadcast of Earthquakes , known as the CUBE , in an effort to &quot; distribute responsible information faster. &quot; If an earthquake hits , a computerized paging system would immediately transmit data collected at Caltech ' s Seismological Laboratory to the station ' s newsroom . * Young Talk Bats Out Sports : Now that the sale of KMPC-AM ( 710 ) to Capital Cities Communications is final , the all-sports station is believed to be changing in May to a youthful-oriented talk format .
