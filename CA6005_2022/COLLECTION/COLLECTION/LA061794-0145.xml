   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; GOAL IS TO GAIN FOOTHOLD HERE ; VIEWPOINT : INTEREST IN SOCCER DEPENDS_ON WHETHER AMERICAN SPORTS FANS CAN BE WEANED FROM THEIR OBSESSION WITH STATISTICS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The world ' s most popular sport is holding its world championship in one of the world ' s most sports-mad nations -- which , unfortunately , has not cared much for the sport in the past . By the time the champion is decided , 52 games will have been played , watched by nearly 4 million spectators in nine cities and by billions on television . The final alone will draw a television audience of 2 billion . None of this guarantees what some fans hope for : that soccer will join the list of national American sports . Whether it does depends_on many factors , primarily whether soccer can overcome its defensive orientation and whether American audiences can be brought_to like a game not susceptible to statistical analysis . In baseball , purists claim to relish 1-0 games ; for non-purists , they tend to be boring . In soccer , few Americans are purists , yet low-scoring games have multiplied . The massed defenses , the offside rule , the emphasis on avoiding a loss at all costs have made high-scoring games ( say , more_than three goals a game ) increasingly rare , and even three-goal games are infrequent . In the last World Cup , the_Irish team that reached the quarterfinals by scoring only two goals is an extreme example of this style . FIFA ' s rules changes -- granting an additional point for victories , not permitting the goalkeeper to handle the ball if it is passed back to him by his own side , and ejecting players who trip an opponent breaking clear -- have not been in_effect long enough to permit a conclusive judgment . They have surely opened_up the game ; whether they lead to more goals will be tested during the championship which , at least after the group of 16 is reached , will pit quite evenly matched teams against each other . More scoring certainly will help the American spectator . But the question remains whether he can be weaned from the obsession with statistics . The major American sports involve a series of discrete plays that in turn can be broken_into their components and given a statistic . Though the three hours of a typical baseball_game rarely have more_than 30 minutes of real action , the spectators are kept busy working_out batting , fielding and earned-run averages , to name a_few . Similarly , in football , which has twice as much action as baseball , spectators can concentrate_on pass_completions , sacks , tackles and a bewildering variety of different set plays . Soccer , with its marvelous fluidity and its ever-changing patterns , must be enjoyed for its crescendos , not its segments . We hope the television broadcasts show some of this rather than concentrate only on the man with the ball . In any event , the American spectator will see a rich smorgasbord of styles and tactical concepts . The European teams whose players are drawn from very competitive national leagues represent the school of hard knocks . They play_on the whole a tough defensive game with priority given to thwarting the opponent . The Germans try to overcome the defensive walls by total football , with all players except the goalie going_on offense -- or on defense if required . With this style , Germany has reached the finals in four of the last five World Cups . It could do so again , though it is getting a bit long in the tooth , lacks effective strikers ( it had to call one back from semi-retirement ) and , in the games Kissinger saw , looked steady rather than brilliant . Italy , champion with a marvelous team in 1982 and just as defensive , plays a more intricate game -- partly because its players rarely can be induced to undergo the regimen of the Germans . They relate their play to time and try to wreck their opponent ' s style . Favoring short passes , they can be beautiful to watch when they are_on and maddening when they lose interest . A young team , it could go_far or flame out early . Another traditional powerhouse is the_Netherlands , which had been improving from game to game . But it has lost Ruud Gullit , at one time the world ' s best footballer , who walked_off the team in a dispute with the coach . His absence might well damage the team ' s beautiful if somewhat stereotyped passing_game and could ruin the chances for the Dutch . Europe has supplied an unprecedented number of teams that rarely reach the final Cup competition . Norway has not been in a World Cup since 1938 . Its mixture of amateurs and professionals has to substitute a tough defense for the skills of the full-time pros . But it has beaten good teams and recently tied England on its home ground , which is not easy . It still would be amazing if it could go beyond the round of 16 . Switzerland might not reach even that . Ireland will go as far as its rugged defense will take it , which should not be beyond the quarterfinals . That it is tough was shown by its recent defeat of Germany in Hanover -- the first Irish defeat of Germany since 1988 . The Latin_American teams emerge from a less-brutal competition in their native leagues . They are therefore more prone to take chances . This makes them more fun to watch but also causes them to be much more vulnerable to counterattacks . Of these , Brazil is always the most fun . Its acrobatic players , its good-natured fans with their samba drums turn games into riotous fiestas . Alas , in all recent World Cups , Brazil was vanquished by sudden thrusts from an outplayed opponent . Nothing would popularize American soccer more_than a Brazilian victory in the World Cup . Argentina has been in the finals of three of the last four World Cups and won twice . Its style is less playful than Brazil ' s but more deadly . It prefers the open Latin_American style but is capable of playing a ruthless , brutal defense . It was a deadly defense and an otherwise mediocre goalkeeper who was a genius in penalty shootouts that got Argentina to the final last time . But it is to be hoped that we see the Argentina of 1978 and 1986 , not the Argentina of 1990 . The sleeper team of South_America is Colombia . Kissinger saw it , on television , beat Argentina , 5-0 , in the qualification round . The offensive wizardry of the Colombians was astounding . If they can play_at this tempo twice a week , they could go at least to the semifinals . The last South_American team is Bolivia . It qualified by dominating its opponents on its home ground of La Paz , which has an altitude of 12 # 000 feet . Unfortunately for Bolivia , the World Cup will be played_at sea_level . Without doubt , the teams that will be most fun to watch together with the Brazilians are the two African teams , Nigeria and Cameroon . In 1990 , Cameroon was within a hair of beating England with its free-wheeling style . We were looking_forward to Cameroon ' s impact on the methodical Germans in the semifinal match . Alas , it lost concentration , was tied near the end and lost in overtime . We haven ' t seen Nigeria , South_Korea , Morocco and Saudi_Arabia even on TV . We will comment as the Cup progresses . Now for the United States . In the Cup without having to qualify because it is the host country , the United States has some strong players and an experienced though enigmatic coach in Bora Milutinovic . But it does not have any players of the very first rank and it lacks , fatally , we are afraid , the underpinnings of a professional soccer league . Nevertheless the United States looked steady when it beat Mexico , 1-0 , in its last tuneup before the Cup . Its nicely set_up goal was a thing of beauty . Nearly all_of the 91 # 123 spectators in the Rose Bowl were passionate fans of Mexico . Their dejection was palpable . No host nation of the World Cup has failed to make_it into the second round . It will be an achievement to be proud_of if the United States does .</TEXT>
