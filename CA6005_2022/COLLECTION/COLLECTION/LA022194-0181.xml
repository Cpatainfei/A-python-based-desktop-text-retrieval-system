   <HEADLINE> JEWELRY INDUSTRY SEES BIG TURNAROUND IN SALES ; GEMS : AS ECONOMY IMPROVES , CONSUMERS FIND ITS POLITICALLY CORRECT ONCE AGAIN TO WEAR FINE STONES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The sparkle has returned to the jewelry industry after years of lackluster sales . An improved economy , repeal of the luxury tax and new marketing options , such_as home shopping on television , are behind the turnaround , which began a year ago . &quot; I think the confidence in wearing jewelry is coming_back , &quot; said Simon Teakle , who heads the U.S. jewelry division of Christie ' s auction_house , where 1993 sales rose 25 % over the previous year . &quot; In recessionary times , it wasn ' t socially correct to wear a tremendous amount of jewelry , &quot; he said . Teakle says consumers are not only buying more baubles and bangles , but have become more savvy about what ' s available . Many may know , for instance , that the finest red rubies come from Burma , that Mexican opals are fiery orange and that diamonds occur naturally in nearly every color of the rainbow . Yet distinguishing a ruby from a red spinel , an emerald from a garnet , or even 10-karat gold from 14-karat gold can be extremely difficult . This lack of expertise -- along with the availability of lab-grown synthetics and imitations resembling the real_thing -- can leave the average buyer vulnerable to unscrupulous dealers and suppliers . &quot; For every color you like , there are probably five or six gemstones in that color , &quot; said Antoinette L . Matlins , co-author of &quot; Jewelry &amp; Gems , The Buying Guide. &quot; &quot; What you see with the naked eye may_not be reality when you buy gems and jewelry. &quot; Also making jewelry buying difficult is that such purchases often are anchored by emotions , particularly during holidays like Valentine ' s Day . Madison Avenue is largely responsible . Advertising_campaigns portray diamonds and other gems as the ultimate gift of eternal love . * The most successful of these campaigns comes from the De Beers ' cartel , which markets 80 % of the world ' s diamonds . De Beers has successfully perpetuated the illusion of the diamond as a rare and valuable stone . In reality , diamonds are plentiful but tightly distributed . &quot; There ' s a tremendous exploitation of consumers based on the allure of gemstones and the mythology of them , &quot; Matlins said . &quot; Someone on the TV shopping network may mention diamonds or rubies or sapphires or emeralds and a certain image instantly comes_to_mind . . . of a highly valuable jewel . But in fact , it doesn ' t escape the fact that it could be garbage. &quot; Steffan Aletti , president of the Jewelry Industry Council in New York , said he has received few complaints about the discounted jewelry sold on home-shopping programs . But he acknowledges that some dealers do misrepresent what they sell . &quot; There are some emeralds that are more appropriate to grace the bottom of a fishbowl than a ring , &quot; he said . &quot; The more desperate people are in looking_for a deal , the most likely they are to get stung. &quot; * One way to avoid getting stung is to shop reputable dealers who have trade group affiliations and experts on their payroll . &quot; You don ' t need to be a gemologist to buy a ring , &quot; Aletti said , &quot; just as you don ' t need to study a schematic to buy a Sony or a Panasonic &quot; television_set . Still , there are some basic rules to keep_in mind when buying jewelry . For diamonds , size is not the most important factor . Diamonds are graded and priced based on the cut , color , clarity and carat weight , with a flawless , colorless stone considered the most valuable . A half-carat , round-cut diamond that is nearly flawless and with excellent color can cost far more_than a three-carat diamond of poor color and with noticeable imperfections -- about $ 13 # 400 versus $ 7 # 200 , Matlins ' book says . Fancy shapes usually sell for 5 % to 15 % less . Matlins says the four rules for gemstones are &quot; color , color , color and color ! &quot; If a gemstone ' s color is good , she says , the presence of flaws usually won ' t detract from its value as significantly as with diamonds . Keep_in mind , however , that many stones are treated with heat or oils to enhance their color , a process that is legal as long as the dealer discloses that to the customer . * The availability of the stone also is crucial . A chrome tourmaline may have a color similar to a green zircon , but because there ' s less supply , the tourmaline costs more -- about $ 300 to $ 1 # 400 for one to three carats versus $ 240 to $ 680 for the zircon , says &quot; Jewelry &amp; Gems. &quot; Precious_metals vary in price based on their purity . Sterling_silver costs more_than silver_plate . An 18-karat gold setting is more valuable than 14-karat or 10-karat because it contains more gold -- 75 % , vs . 58 % and 41 % . Platinum is costlier still because it is rarer and heavier than the others . The standard markup for retail jewelers is about 100 % above the wholesale price , said Aletti , though it can go higher . &quot; Some are willing to sell more and make less . . . . Some want more per sale . It depends_on the overhead the jeweler has , &quot; Aletti said . &quot; Tiffany and Cartier have a higher markup because of their enormous overhead . But they sell only the very best of materials. &quot; Because of the huge markups , along with the difficulty most individuals have in reselling pieces , jewelry should not be thought of as an investment . &quot; The material from which it ' s made has to go_up a great_deal for you to realize any kind of profit , &quot; Aletti said . that ' s especially true of diamonds . &quot; There are thousands of categories of diamonds . Some are more easily sold than others , &quot; said Lloyd Jaffe , chairman of the American Diamond Industry Assn . &quot; ( And ) no stone will have the same emotional value for one person as the next. &quot; Buyer Beware Some tips for buying jewelry : * Select a reputable dealer . Suggestions from family or friends may be helpful . Otherwise , visit several stores and compare the quality of products , prices and services . Is there a gemologist on staff ? Have there been any complaints to the Better Business Bureau ? * Beware of bogus sales . Some dealers constantly hold &quot; 70 % off &quot; sales , but you don ' t know what they ' re discounting from if the promotions don ' t end . A sale is a true sale if the merchandise is discounted for a period_of_time , then returned to the higher , regular price . * Put it in writing . A purchase should be described in a bill_of_sale just as it was explained by the salesperson . For diamonds , the carat weight , color and flaw grades should be noted . For colored gemstones , it should be stated whether the stone is genuine or synthetic , among other things . Some dealers may make a sale contingent_on verification by a gem-testing lab . * Get an independent appraisal . Besides verifying facts about the piece , an appraisal is needed for insurance . Trade groups such_as the American Gem Society in Los Angeles can provide lists of appraisers . Auction_houses such_as Christie ' s in New York also offer free verbal appraisals . * Get insurance . Since standard homeowners ' policies cover only a portion of jewelry losses , additional coverage is needed . But not all policies are equal . For instance , many companies won ' t reimburse the &quot; full value &quot; of the item but rather exercise a &quot; replacement &quot; option . * Beware of telemarketers . Gemstone investments can be profitable , but millions of dollars have been lost in sophisticated telemarketing schemes . The pitch may seem legitimate : Gems offered at &quot; wholesale prices &quot; and shipped in sealed containers with convincing reports from gem-testing labs .</TEXT>
