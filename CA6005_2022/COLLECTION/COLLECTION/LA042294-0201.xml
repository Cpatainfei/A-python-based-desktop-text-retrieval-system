   <HEADLINE> THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON : SANS HOLLYWOOD , IS CANNES KAPUT ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Now that it ' s confirmed that mainstream Hollywood will have virtually no presence at next month ' s Cannes Film Festival , European movie_makers have achieved a modified version of the cinematic purity they ' ve sought since last year ' s GATT discussions . &quot; Les Patriots , &quot; &quot; Grosse Fatigue &quot; and other home-grown movies can command center stage at this year ' s festival without the distractions of a half-naked Madonna ascending the red-carpeted steps of the Palais des Festivals , Sylvester Stallone being sucked into a Cote d ' Azur mob or an oversized Arnold Schwarzenegger balloon symbolically deflating on a barge . But with America relegated to a supporting role this year , Cannes may also find its own cachet deflated , much as the European theatrical business could be undercut if the European Union follows_through on threats to enforce tough restrictions on the inflow of American films . Cannes regulars have acknowledged for decades that the festival derives much of its international media appeal and pizazz from Hollywood -- the most definitive book on Cannes is titled &quot; Hollywood on the Riviera &quot; -- no matter how many prestigious films the organizers showcase . That explains why the controversial &quot; Basic Instinct &quot; got the coveted opening slot at Cannes two years ago and why the taut but vacuous &quot; Cliffhanger &quot; received a special screening last year . This year ' s Hollywood lineup consists_of independently produced films such_as Quentin Tarantino ' s &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; low-budget studio releases such_as Paramount ' s &quot; The Browning Version &quot; and Columbia ' s &quot; I Like It Like That , &quot; and movies that have already failed domestically , such_as &quot; The Hudsucker Proxy &quot; from Warner Bros.-PolyGram and &quot; Serial Mom &quot; from Savoy Pictures . After the selections were formally announced Thursday , sources suggested that festival director Gilles Jacob may still have a surprise up his sleeve , such_as a glitzy last-minute addition . But Jacob said he ' s satisfied with the lineup . He noted that &quot; Hudsucker Proxy &quot; was produced by Joel Silver , &quot; one of the greatest producers in Hollywood , &quot; and that &quot; Serial Mom , &quot; which he identified in writing as &quot; Serial Mother , &quot; stars the well-known Kathleen Turner . Besides Turner , the stars committed to Cannes so far are few . They include Clint Eastwood , president of the 47th annual festival jury , &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; co-stars Bruce Willis and John Travolta , Tim Robbins , Jennifer Jason Leigh and Gerard Depardieu . A salute to director Robert Altman ( &quot; MASH , &quot; &quot; Nashville , &quot; &quot; The Player &quot; ) could also turn_up some big names . Yet even the chronically dull MIP-TV market recently produced such A-list celebrities as Prince Edward and the Duchess of York . * Hollywood will be_better represented behind the scenes , where the usual amount of international deal making will take_place , and on billboards and walls throughout Cannes , where low-budget American films tend to be shamelessly promoted . A number of those Hollywood deal makers believe top studio films are being withheld from Cannes in retribution against the_French , who successfully lobbied for the entertainment_industry ' s exclusion from protection under the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . No one would publicly fess up_to such collusion , and a Motion_Picture Assn . of America representative in Paris denied the rumor Thursday . But it ' s curious , at least , that no major studio has stepped_forward with a star-studded picture , especially since Cannes has been called the world ' s greatest promotional vehicle by no less an authority than Schwarzenegger . He ' s one of many regulars who will not be_on hand this year . The superstar ' s publicist says he ' s unable to attend because he ' s gone directly from filming &quot; True Lies &quot; to filming &quot; Junior. &quot; Pat Kingsley , who represents stars such_as Tom Cruise and Jodie Foster , said none of her major clients are expected to be there . Asked why , she said she had to take another call . The studios , for their part , claim they ' ve little to gain from Cannes this year . Some say it ' s because the festival is too expensive . Others insist their best films won ' t be ready in time , or that the crush of publicity at Cannes often undercuts their marketing efforts on the home front . In fairness , participants point_out that Hollywood ' s presence at Cannes has seesawed in the past . Only eight of the 62 films at last year ' s festival were American , though some of the titles were mainstream . The number was roughly double that of the year before . * In a written response to questions from The Times , Jacob said one problem is that release dates for major Hollywood films often conflict with the mid-May staging of Cannes . He also hinted , without saying it outright , that the available films this year were disappointing . Jacob denied that GATT played any role in determining the quality of American films available to him . He refused to share his own opinion on the quota issue , saying , &quot; I have my personal feelings concerning the problem of quotas , but at the post where I am , we have in France that which one calls the obligation of reserve. &quot;</TEXT>
