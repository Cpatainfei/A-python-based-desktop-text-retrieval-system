   <HEADLINE> MUSIC REVIEWS ; SWANN SHOWS THE POWER , GLORY OF CATHEDRAL ORGAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The 16 # 412 pipes and 268 ranks of the Crystal Cathedral ' s Hazel Wright organ -- which reportedly make_it the second-largest fully functional organ in existence -- can easily seduce a performer into a gratuitous display of power . Friday night , however , director of music and artist-in-residence Frederick Swann returned briefly from a summer sabbatical in a recital that avoided this pitfall , and tapped the potential of the instrument without compromising the musical integrity of his program . The agenda highlighted the versatility of its mammoth vehicle . &quot; Postlude for the Office of Compline , &quot; by Jehan Alain -- the_French organist and composer who died at age 29 , in World_War_II -- floated its Gregorian melodies and romantic harmonies , all delicately registered , in quiet reverie . Among the strongest works in terms of effect and sonic forcefulness , Cesar Franck ' s B-minor Chorale received an intelligent , deliberately paced and rhythmically precise performance that came_to an exciting , yet stylistically attentive , reed-dominated climax . Judging by the degree of earth-shaking volume , though not necessarily of musical merit , the Franck work was bested by the last programmed piece : Healey Willan ' s Introduction , Passacaglia and Fugue . Generally recognized as the Canadian composer ' s most notable composition in this genre , it is bound to leave a lasting impression through an almost relentlessly growing density that culminated here , in its final variation , with a massive encircling aural assault . Swann achieved particularly tense excitement as he unraveled the intricacies of the fugue that preceded it . Variations comprised a major part of the evening . Calvin Hampton ' s thorny , sometimes eerie set , his Prelude and Variations on &quot; Old 100th , &quot; offered the most technical challenges . Still , although Swann informed the audience that he had played it in public only once before -- as part of International Organ Week , in Nuremberg last month -- he worked his way capably through a thick fabric of wandering obbligatos and emerging countermelodies and managed to surround his listeners with a big enough wall of sound that they apparently forgave him the moments of bitonality in an otherwise traditional-minded program .</TEXT>
