   <HEADLINE> CHIP MANUFACTURER IS DENIED PATENT BY JAPANESE COURT ; COMPUTERS : RULING THAT FUJITSU CHIPS DON ' T INFRINGE ON TEXAS INSTRUMENTS ' PATENT MAY IGNITE TRADE CONCERNS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a decision that could reignite concern over Japan ' s willingness to protect American inventions , a Japanese court ruled Wednesday that computer chips made by Japan ' s Fujitsu Ltd . don ' t infringe on Texas Instruments ' basic semiconductor patent . The Tokyo District Court said Fujitsu ' s most advanced memory_chips are made with a different method than the one described in TI ' s pioneering patent , and thus rejected TI ' s request for an injunction blocking Fujitsu from manufacturing the chips . TI said it was disappointed with the ruling and would immediately appeal it to the Tokyo High_Court . &quot; The net effect of this decision is that our invention of the integrated_circuit was never accorded patent protection in Japan , &quot; said Richard J . Agnich , general counsel at Texas Instruments . The decision highlights American complaints that Japanese courts interpret patents too narrowly , allowing firms to essentially copy American inventions if they make minor , incremental changes to the invention . &quot; It ' s a very serious problem , one of the most serious we have with Japan , &quot; said a senior U.S. trade official . He said U.S. companies are more likely to hold important patents than Japanese companies and are more likely to be hurt by courts ' narrow interpretation of such patents . &quot; The recent ( bilateral ) agreements we made are procedural and easy to implement , &quot; the trade official said . &quot; It ' s much more difficult when you are dealing with the courts and subtle issues of interpretation. &quot; The Tokyo ruling will weaken TI ' s bargaining position when it negotiates licensing deals worth hundreds of millions of dollars with more_than a dozen Japanese semiconductor companies in 1995 and 1996 . Jack Kilby , a TI engineer , helped launch the modern electronics_industry in 1958 when he came_up with the idea of shrinking down complex electronic circuits and placing them on a single , flat semiconductor wafer . TI filed a patent_application for the invention in the U.S. in 1959 and in Japan in 1961 . The Japanese patent_office granted TI a patent on one aspect of the Kilby invention in 1977 -- just two years before it expired and too late for TI to obtain any benefit from the patent . The patent_office granted another patent in 1989 that was good until 2001 . That patent helped TI negotiate big increases in royalty payments from Japanese chip makers in 1990 . The negotiations were part of TI ' s strategy of milking patents for royalties -- one that netted the company about $ 1 billion but infuriated rival U.S. and Japanese chip firms . Fujitsu , alone among the major chip makers , refused to cut a deal with TI and the two firms went_to court in 1991 .</TEXT>
