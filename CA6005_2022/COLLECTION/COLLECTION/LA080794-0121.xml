   <HEADLINE> THEY LEFT THE LIGHT ON ; DURING SUMMER IN THIS REMOTE ALASKAN FRONTIER TOWN , THE FISHING ' S GREAT AND THE DAYS NEVER SEEM TO END</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> My problem in Homer wasn ' t the jaywalking moose or the cult of the halibut or the spit rats . It wasn ' t the lady who accused me of being Tom Bodett . All these things I came_to understand as facets of life in what may be the most celebrated small_town on America ' s last_frontier . My problem was the summer light . I felt obliged to keep exploring as long as it shone , and it just kept_on shining . This was late July , and every day , dawn would arrive around 5 , casting a gray glow onto the smooth stones , bleached driftwood and silvery tides at Bishop ' s Beach , a block from my bed at the Driftwood Inn . Then the sun would inch its way across the sky , the wind would snap and ease , and the 4 # 200 rumpled and sweater-wrapped residents of Homer would go_about their busy summer lives : hauling in hundred-pound halibut , throwing pots , steering seaplanes over glaciers , tidying their bed and breakfasts , piloting ferries across Kachemak Bay to Halibut Cove or the old Eskimo and Russian settlement at Seldovia . On their way , they ' d pass messages to each other via the five-times-daily &quot; bush line &quot; of the public radio_station , KBBI-AM 890 . To Natasha : Bears are_on the trail between the head of the bay and town . Take the low road . From Boris . To Bethany : Reminder that you have an appointment Tuesday at Dr. Todd ' s office . Ten hours would go_by this way , then 15 , giving me plenty of time to hit the usual tourist highlights . But then I ' d find myself passing time , happy but unfocused , at just about anything . Combing the shoreline in search of a perfectly round stone . Hiking randomly amid the green shrubs and purple flowers atop Ohlson Mountain , which overlooks town . Taking a census of boat names in the Homer Small_Boat Harbor . Watching the dock dogs snap for fish scraps . One morning -- or maybe it was afternoon -- I was back at Bishop ' s Beach looking_at driftwood and stones , and found Mandy Ewald , 13 , Sarah Ewald , 14 , Tara Guhn , 16 , and Crystal Loop , 12 , splashing in the chilly surf . But for them and me and a_few distant specks about a mile along the shore , the beach was empty . Beyond the bay , peeking through swirling clouds , lay jagged peaks , monumental fiords , Kachemak Glacier , Dinglestadt Glacier , Dixon , Portlock , Grewingk , Wosnesenski and Doroshin glaciers . The girls had come_by car from Fort Wayne , Ind. , and this , they agreed , teeth chattering , was the best place yet -- even better , they said , than the big mall in Edmonton , Alberta . Late that night -- or maybe it was early the next morning -- I sat hunched in the din of the Salty Dawg ( founded 1957 , open until 4 a.m. ) , my shoes scraping in sawdust , my head surrounded by wall-mounted life_preservers , my ears ringing with beer-fueled accounts of the day ' s fishing . &quot; Today was a big day , &quot; charter deckhand Dan Prisaznuk told me . &quot; A friend of mine , the first fish on his boat was a 208. &quot; That would be 208 pounds . The crew needed three shots to kill it . Large halibut are often subdued aboard ship by gun shots , lest their twitching tails break someone ' s legs . Someone else had a story about another guy , a_few days before , who didn ' t bother to spend the $ 5 it takes_to enter the Homer Jackpot Halibut Derby , then went_out and caught a 300-pound fish . His fish was the biggest of the summer so far , which means the $ 5 the fellow saved might end_up costing him a jackpot of something like $ 18 # 000 . Hate it when that happens . In this way I floated through the days and nights . Finally , each day , after 18 or so hours of light , around 11 p.m. , the last direct rays of the sun would throw a warm pink glow onto the line of ragged peaks across the bay . Anglers would still be slouching around the Fishing Hole , and pre-teen kids were out riding bikes along the shoulder of East End Road , still sun-drunk . Then would come a_few hours of twilight , with the moon gleaming over the mountains and the still waters of the bay glowing like a great pane_of_glass , gas-jet blue . Then , around 2 a.m. , a blink of darkness , under cover of which a high-living crew_member could crawl home , change clothes , grab a bite and a quick nap , and head back_out on another charter . Which could account_for the bumper sticker I saw in the harbor lot : &quot; Have you flogged your crew today ? &quot; Homer , which lies on the Kenai Peninsula about 2 # 200 miles north of Los Angeles , is southern by Alaskan standards . As the eagle flies , it sits about 100 miles south of Anchorage , and more_than 500 miles south of Fairbanks . Though the mountains along the horizon never lose their snow , and the 3-million-year-old Harding Icefield behind them never melts , Homer ' s location on the waters of Kachemak Bay keeps its temperatures moderate : around 60 degrees in summer , around 20 in winter , with regular runs of rain , clouds and wind to keep things interesting . ( On my last_day in town , the winds were so interesting that my &quot; flight-seeing &quot; expedition , to see glaciers and such by seaplane , was canceled. ) Moose roam freely . Bears across the bay swat at salmon in the cold river runoff . Whales , otters , puffins and scores of other birds live_off the sea and shoreline , often within the protected territory of Kachemak Bay_State Park . The halibut and salmon fisheries draw anglers by the thousands and sustain more_than a dozen charter companies , which usually charge summer rates around $ 150 per person a day . In winter , eagles gather here in startling numbers , perching outside the flower-festooned trailer-residence of a woman named Jean Keene , who has been feeding them for years . Mary Rollins , a Homer resident for most of the last 11 years , tells the story of a Christmas_Eve a_few years ago when she and a companion drove_out on the Spit and counted 159 eagles . &quot; Then , four days later , &quot; Rollins adds , &quot; we counted 254 . Well , we quit at 254. &quot; ( I saw no eagles , though other folks did report sightings during my July visit . I did encounter my first moose about 20 minutes after arrival , at an intersection one block from the airport . She yielded right_of_way and bounded into the woods. ) This raw landscape brings_in plenty of visitors , nearly all_in summer . Some of them take_a_look around at the rich , unfinished nature of the place , decide this is where the next chapter of their lives should begin and cease to be visitors . &quot; I ' m going_to die here , &quot; John Redman told me one afternoon or evening . Redman , 71 years old and bent from arthritis , moved_up from the Lower 48 four years ago , gave_up his hair-cutting business and started sharpening knives for charter companies on the Spit . &quot; I like the cold , &quot; he explained . Besides , he said , in his new business he has &quot; no overhead , and no dirty necks to contend with. &quot; More often , of course , strangers spend a_few days in Homer on the way to someplace else . About 115 # 000 tourists pass_through Homer yearly , which puts tourism second only to fishing among local industries . ( Sometimes , the two industries overlap more_than folks here would like : The National Car Rental outlet levies $ 100 fines against customers who bring_back cars with interiors reeking of fish. ) But there ' s a whiff of culture in Homer ' s air too , and here and there the twinkle of New Age crystals . More_than a dozen galleries fill their shelves and walls with the work of resident artists and craft workers . The Smoky Bay Co-op stocks mango chutney and various organic wares for a large and devoted clientele . In October , 1989 , voters declared the city a nuclear-free zone . Just across Kachemak Bay lies Halibut Cove , an artists ' community of about 160 residents ( 40 in winter ) . Halibut Cove is reachable only by ferry , but nevertheless pulls_in dozens of travelers daily , most of whom leave the Homer harbor at noon and return at 5 p.m. ( adult round-trip fare : $ 35 ) . Crossing the bay , passengers get a close-up view of the murre , puffin and other birds on Gull Island , then watch as the ferry pulls into a charming inlet with houses on pilings connected by a winding boardwalk . On my day trip there , I admired the locally produced pottery , jewelry and sepia-toned octopus-ink paintings , and ate a spectacular lunch of Halibut Veracruz , beans , rice and fresh bread at the Saltry restaurant . After the meal , I found myself standing on the boardwalk in the middle of a truly strange and pleasant scene : Snowy mountains rising above , green lagoon sprawling before me , idle boats bobbing here and there , and next to the Experience Art_Gallery entrance , a freckle-faced 9-year-old named Nicky Riordan , practicing his cello . Minuets , mostly . He ' d been playing for three years , he told me , and he liked playing in summer best because he was_on vacation from mandatory daily practice . Finally I had to go_back to catch the ferry back to Homer , but all_the way down the boardwalk , I could hear Nicky ' s bow strokes echoing across the inlet . For such a small place , Homer looms large in popular culture . Or at least facsimiles of it do . Cicely , a tiny , quirky and fictional Alaskan town not entirely unlike Homer , has been the setting of the television series &quot; Northern Exposure &quot; for more_than four years . And there are the folksy books and Motel 6 radio commericals ( &quot; we ' ll leave the light on for ya &quot; ) of Tom Bodett , a Michigan-bred , 12-year resident of Homer who has set many of his fictional stories in a tiny Alaskan community he calls &quot; The End of the Road. &quot; Before I left for Homer , I called Bodett and solicited , from the voice that promises to leave the light on for you , a quick insider ' s take_on his town . Homer is like most small_towns , Bodett said , in that &quot; people know each other ' s business , and people tend to care about each other a little more because they know each other a little better than they do_in bigger cities. &quot; But he also pointed_out a compound distinction that does make Homer different : &quot; The people who settled this land are still around , &quot; but now they ' ve been joined by well-educated , simplicity-seeking immigrants from the Lower 48 . &quot; There are more unused college degrees in Homer , &quot; said Bodett , &quot; than I ' ve seen anywhere. &quot; Homer ' s tourism and fishing industries both begin with a geographical oddity called the Spit , which reaches 4.5 miles into the waters of Kachemak Bay . From the lookout point by the satellite dishes on Skyline Drive , the Spit looks_like a long finger of sand . To a walker on its millions of tide-worn rocks , it can sound as brittle as glass breaking underfoot . Some stretches of the Spit sunk six feet into the bay in Alaska ' s 1964 Good_Friday earthquake , but by then the local economy was built around it , and it continues to be the busiest place in town . It houses five boardwalks bristling with fishing charter services , tacky souvenir stands and seafood restaurants . Nearby lie scores of RV camping spots , the Salty Dawg bar , a hotel called the Land ' s End Resort , Jean Keene ' s trailer and , in summer , hundreds of tent campsites along the beach . Most of the tent pilgrims , who also call themselves &quot; spit rats , &quot; arrive with the warm weather after Memorial_Day , and many take jobs with charter companies . Eager to underline the Spit ' s informal status as End of the Road , they tack up mileage signs announcing distances -- to Paris , to Riverside , to Oconomowoc ( Wisconsin ) -- and give their settlements names like Freedom Beach . &quot; I had a little money saved_up , so I figured , ' Ah , well , I ' ll go_down to Homer and live like a bum all summer , ' &quot; said Scott Wales , a 32-year-old spit rat , erstwhile waiter from Scottsdale , Ariz. , and apparent mayor of Freedom Beach . Another night -- I think it was night -- while taking pictures a_few hundred yards up the shore from Freedom Beach , I met another pair of spit rats as they stoked a bonfire , barbecued some fresh cod and sucked Budweisers . One of them , who gave the name Smitty and punctuated his sentences with the exclamation &quot; Arrrgh , &quot; proposed that we steal a Coast Guard_ship and pirate our way to Hamburg , Germany . He was serious , in a stinking drunk sort of way . The rest of town is built_on meadows and hillside among sandstone bluffs , overgrown by spruce , birch , alder and elderberry , and arranged around the main_drag of Pioneer Avenue . Pioneer runs a mile through town and , in the improvised , spread-out fashion of Alaskan development , sustains enough businesses to fill about one-half mile of main_drag in the Lower 48 . City_Hall , the library , the Smoky Bay Co-op , and the Ptarmigan Arts and Homer Artists galleries are all along Pioneer . One afternoon -- or perhaps evening -- I ducked into the Homer Public_Library and wound_up comparing the Homer News ' police reports with those of its upstart rival , the Homer Tribune . The News scored a clear scoop , and offered a strong clue to the volume and depth of crime in the city , with its account of the escaped goat discovered &quot; eating flowers and harassing customers &quot; at the Wolf Sculpture Gallery . The goat ' s owner got_off with a warning . The Pratt Museum , just off Pioneer Avenue , traces the region ' s natural_history , admirably paying particular attention to recent events . Downstairs , at a standing exhibit called &quot; Darkened Waters : Profile of an Oil Spill , &quot; visitors press a button and hear the low , laconic voice of Capt . Joseph Hazelwood , calling a Coast Guard dispatcher on March 24 , 1989 , to report a problem . &quot; Yeah , Valdez back , we should be_on your radar there . We ' ve fetched_up , hard aground , north of Goose Island , off Bligh Reef , and evidently leaking some oil , and we ' re gonna be here for a while , and , if you want . . . so , you ' re notified. &quot; The spill amounted to more_than 10.8 million gallons of crude_oil dumped into Prince William Sound , the largest spill in United States history . Exxon agreed in 1991 to a $ 900 million civil settlement payment to state and federal_officials , but several other spill-related lawsuits are still in_progress . Though no traces of oil are visible on Homer ' s beaches five years later , the city ' s shores were among the 1 # 500 miles of directly affected Alaskan coastline . Cathy Godfrey , who moved to Homer just in time to experience the spill , remembers sitting at the Land ' s End restaurant , a plate of clams before her , while beyond the window on the beach , clean-up workers strolled the beach in contamination suits . For all_the natural wonders that surround it , urban Homer is not a postcard place . Mark Turner , who arrived from Tucson four years ago and serves as editor and publisher of the Homer News , says he loves the place and has no plans to leave it , but he describes much of the local architecture as the &quot; Ugly Alaska &quot; school of design -- buildings raised of necessity from resources at_hand , and neighbored by stray materials that might someday come_in_handy . Junked old cars , for instance , and odd pieces of lumber . This may scare_off aesthetes , but it ' s a direct expression of how recently and roughly the town rose from the dirt and weeds . Non-native settlers , who came_to exploit coal and other mineral deposits , didn ' t try to establish any kind of community here until the end of the 19th Century , and then they failed . ( One of them was a gold prospector from New York named Homer Pennock , who gave his name to the place before he gave up. ) After close to 20 years of deterioration , the town was rebuilt in the 1920s , ' 30s and ' 40s by fishermen and homesteaders who arrived and departed by boat and plane . Homer ' s future was assured in 1950 , when a state crew completed Sterling Highway , the first road connection to Anchorage and the outside world . Locals say that by then , Homer ' s salt-of-the-earth , head-in-the-stars , end-of-the-road character was probably already set . &quot; When I grew_up , &quot; says artist Asia Freeman , who was raised here in the 1960s , &quot; it was the fundamentalists and the anarchists. &quot; ( Some of the city folks up in Anchorage apparently have another word for those who live here : Homeroid. ) These days , Freeman and her partner , carpenter Kurt Marquardt , are trying to put their own stamp on the new Homer . The focus of their efforts is a boxy old building at Main_Street and Bunnell . Fifty-seven years ago , the building was put_up to hold a boarding house upstairs and a general mercantile store below . Now it houses the Bunnell Street Gallery ( founded 1991 ) downstairs , the Old Inlet Trading_Post B &amp; B ( founded 1993 ) upstairs , the Two Sisters Espresso Bakery ( founded in 1993 ) next door , and boatwright Gregor Welpton ' s shop next door . A vintage clothing shop , about a year old , stands brightly hued across the street , and an informal guild of home beer brewers meets in the basement . It feels_like a place where things are going_to happen . It was about three blocks from there , however , that the Tom Bodett thing happened . I was eating a late dinner alone near the rear of Cafe Cups on Pioneer Avenue , and an assertive woman from out of town was leading her party of seven into a discussion of Homer ' s leading author and radio host . First she asked the waitress where Bodett was . Getting no satisfactory answer , she pivoted in her seat , spied me in the back , and announced to her friends , to me , and to the rest of the restaurant , &quot; I ' ll bet that ' s him . Are you Tom Bodett ? &quot; The real Tom Bodett , I knew , was_on vacation in Hawaii . This was one of those wondrous Alaskan opportunities , my chance to adopt a drawl , say whatever I pleased , and add a Tom Bodett chapter to my life . Alas , Mr. Bodett can rest easy . I just shook my head , finished_off my scallops , and stepped_out of the restaurant into the late-night lazy afternoon light of summertime Homer . A true Homerite , I suspect , might have done otherwise .
