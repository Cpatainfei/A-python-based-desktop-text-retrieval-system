   <HEADLINE> SAFETY PANEL OKS RULES ON TRAILING 757 JETS ; AIRCRAFT : GUIDELINES SEEK TO AVERT CRASHES LINKED TO WAKE TURBULENCE , WHICH APPARENTLY DOWNED A PLANE IN SANTA ANA IN WHICH FIVE PEOPLE DIED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The National Transportation Safety Board on Tuesday approved a detailed set of recommendations designed to prevent airplane accidents caused by wake turbulence -- the presumed cause of a crash that claimed five lives when a twin-engine corporate jet went_out of control while landing about two miles behind a Boeing 757 at John Wayne Airport in December . The board ' s action sent a strong message to the Federal Aviation Administration that the minimum distances between landing airplanes should be increased and that its 20-year-old weight classification_system for larger aircraft be overhauled to reflect a new generation of commercial jetliners . The board also urged that air controllers provide more detailed information to pilots about wake turbulence and that training manuals be updated to emphasize the dangers of such airborne encounters , particularly when the trailing plane is smaller and more vulnerable to the miniature cyclones produced by rapid air movement across the larger aircraft ' s wings . Safety board records show that 51 wake turbulence incidents or accidents have occurred over the last decade , killing 27 people and damaging or destroying 40 airplanes . The FAA has been reluctant to increase separation distances between 757s and trailing aircraft . But only a week after the crash of the corporate jet in Santa Ana two months ago , FAA Administrator David Hinson issued a directive requiring air traffic controllers nationwide to warn pilots of the turbulence caused by 757s . The safety board ' s action Tuesday , although not binding on the FAA , is expected to put more pressure on federal regulators to adopt the preventive procedures adopted unanimously by the board ' s five commissioners . FAA spokesman Paul Steucke said the agency would review the safety board recommendations immediately . &quot; We ' re aware of the problem and we ' re taking measures to make_sure there is not another occurrence , &quot; Steucke said . Besides the fatal_accident in Santa Ana , four other incidents related to 757 turbulence have occurred in the last 14 months , including a Dec . 18 , 1992 , crash in Billings , Mont. , that killed eight people . Although many of the wake turbulence accidents involve Boeing 757 jetliners , the commissioners did not cite any particular flaw in the airplane ' s design . The heart of the problem , they said , is revising the FAA ' s plane classification_system to ensure the proper separation between airplanes . &quot; There may be some unique characteristics of the 757 , &quot; Commissioner John . K . Lauber said , &quot; . . . but it is clear that the fundamental problem goes_back to the outdated weight categorization scheme that needs to be fixed. &quot; The board found that &quot; inadequacies in the current airplane weight classification scheme . . . air control procedures . . . and pilot knowledge . . . of wake vortices were more important factors_in the five recent accidents investigated by the safety board than any specific characteristic of the B-757 wake vortex. &quot; Under the present system , the 757 is considered a large aircraft , but industry experts have previously urged the FAA to reclassify it as a heavy aircraft and require smaller planes to stay farther behind . The board took action on both fronts Tuesday . It recommended that the separation distances be lengthened for smaller planes trailing 757s -- even for jetliners such_as Boeing 737s , MD-80s and DC-9s . And it also urged that the three-tiered U.S. airplane weight classification_system be revised to narrow the weight ranges_in some categories . Under present U.S. rules , the 757 is the heaviest aircraft in the middle weight class . The commission also recommended that 757s and other large aircraft conduct landings on a more standard flight_path angle . The board ' s study of wake turbulence incidents showed that trailing airplanes are in more danger of being thrown_out of control when they are below the larger plane ' s descending flight_path . Because 757s and other newer jets can slow_down more quickly than older jetliners , trailing aircraft can inadvertently close too quickly and wind_up in the danger_zone . Safety board staff_members made_it clear that maintaining a higher relative position to larger landing aircraft is the key preventive factor . &quot; The flight_path is ( the ) critical factor ) , but maintaining proper distance is the best solution , &quot; said John Clark , an aircraft performance specialist for the board .
