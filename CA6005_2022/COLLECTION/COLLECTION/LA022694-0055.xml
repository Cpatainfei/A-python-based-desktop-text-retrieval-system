   <HEADLINE> OUTRAGED CLINTON SUMMONS PLO , ISRAEL FOR TALKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a dramatic bid to prevent the Hebron massacre from destroying the Middle_East peace process , President Clinton on Friday summoned Israeli and Palestinian negotiators to Washington for nonstop talks until they complete an agreement on limited Palestinian self-rule in the West_Bank and Gaza Strip . Clinton , who called the slayings &quot; a gross act of murder , &quot; has been wary of hands-on participation in the volatile Arab-Israeli negotiations throughout his 13-month tenure . But he threw his own prestige behind a demand for results at the bargaining table after learning of the blood-spattered scene in Hebron ' s Ibrahim Mosque , where an American-born Israeli doctor killed 48 Muslim worshipers in a fusillade of automatic weapon fire . Asserting that the killer ' s objective was to derail the delicate negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization , Clinton called_for redoubled efforts to complete the troublesome details blocking implementation of the self-rule accord signed with such fanfare on the White_House lawn last September . He said that would be the best way to thwart the anti-peace extremists in both the Jewish and Arab communities . PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat , who earlier in the day threatened to pull_out of the talks to protest the killings , and Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin immediately agreed to send their delegates to Washington for negotiations beginning next week . &quot; On behalf of the American people , I condemn this crime in the strongest possible terms , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; I am outraged and saddened that such a gross act of murder could be perpetrated , and I extend my deepest sympathies to the families of those who have been killed and wounded . &quot; Extremists on both sides are determined to drag Arabs and Israelis back into the darkness of unending conflict and bloodshed , &quot; he added . &quot; We must prevent them from extinguishing the hopes and the visions and the aspirations of ordinary people for a life of peaceful existence. &quot; Israeli and PLO negotiators have been haggling over the fine print of Palestinian self-government since they signed their broad general_agreement in September . The talks have been taking_place in Cairo , Oslo , the Sinai resort of Taba and a variety of other venues . According to both camps , agreement is close , but final details have proven difficult . The United States generally has kept its distance from the negotiations , in part at least because Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher considers the September pact to be so loosely drawn that it amounts to a legal minefield . But in the wake of the Hebron killings , Administration officials concluded that an arm ' s-length attitude was no longer good_enough . &quot; The parties have , in discussion with us , agreed that it would be helpful to move these discussions here , for the United States to play a role that . . . at this point ( is ) somewhat undefined , but at least to use our offices and our facilities here to try to help the parties make progress , &quot; State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry said . He said that more active U.S. participation &quot; might change a bit of the dynamics. &quot; A senior Administration official , briefing reporters at the White_House , said the United States decided to step_in to make_it easier for Rabin and Arafat to persuade the Israeli and Palestinian publics of the need to keep negotiating despite the killings . &quot; You needed to have a kind of focal_point for these negotiations that both the prime_minister and the chairman could respond to , so that the focus could again be_on negotiations and not just on the consequences of this event , &quot; the official said . The Israeli-PLO talks on the details of self-government are separate from the broad Israeli-Arab negotiations that have been going_on in Washington for more_than two years . The September agreement called_on Israel and the PLO to complete their negotiations in time to begin Palestinian self-government by last Dec . 13 . But as that date came and went , Rabin asserted that it was more important to tie_down all loose_ends than it was to meet an artificial deadline . On Friday , however , Israeli Ambassador Itamar Rabinovitch said speed was now very important to head_off further violence . &quot; This was an act meant to derail the peace process , &quot; Rabinovitch told a news_conference . &quot; It only reinforces our determination not only to keep to the peace process but to expedite it and to accelerate it . There is no comfort and consolation in this , but even such a tragic event can be the catalyst for movement toward agreement and toward finding a political solution to what has always been and remains to be a very violent and a very tragic conflict. &quot; In his statement at the White_House , Clinton described the killer as a lone madman . And he praised the Israeli government for its handling of the aftermath of the murders . At the United Nations , Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali called_on Israeli authorities &quot; to take all necessary measures to ensure that settlers refrain_from such criminal acts. &quot; Boutros-Ghali appealed for calm , noting that he was &quot; deeply concerned by the unrest generated in the occupied territories . . . and the impact that this may have_on negotiations between the Palestine Liberation Organization and the government of Israel. &quot;</TEXT>
