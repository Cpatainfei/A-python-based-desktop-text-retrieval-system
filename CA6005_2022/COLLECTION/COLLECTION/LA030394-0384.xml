JUST ABOUT ANYTHING GOES IN THE QUEST FOR FOREIGN SALES ; MOVIES : AT THIS YEAR ' S AMERICAN FILM MARKET , INTERNATIONAL BUYERS AREN ' T LOOKING FOR ART FILMS . THEY WANT -- AND FIND -- FLYING FISTS , NUDE WOMEN WITH GUNS , CAR CRASHES AND LOTS OF STUNTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While debate rages in America over the level of violence in entertainment programming , Hollywood continues to spew out a steady stream of graphic movies to the world , many that end_up on video in foreign countries . For months Hollywood has been under siege by the White_House , the Justice_Department and segments of the public to clean_up its act , forcing TV networks to tone_down the content of shows and movie studios to boost production of family films . Yet , for the past week in sun-drenched Santa Monica , hundreds of international buyers are trekking to the Loews Hotel for this year ' s American Film Market , on the hunt for product to fill their theaters , video outlets and air_waves in their respective nations . The sellers at the market are not the major studios but by and large small , low-end independent product suppliers , who are hawking such action / erotic titles as &quot; Teenage Catgirls in Heat , &quot; a wacky comedy from the people at Troma , Inc. , Crown International ' s &quot; Housewife From Hell , &quot; &quot; Skinner , &quot; an exploitative &quot; Silence of the Lambs &quot; wanna-be directed by Ivan Nagy of Heidi Fleiss fame . Look down any hallway at the Loews , enter any guest suite , survey any display at the AFM -- and the chances are good you ' ll see movie posters and slick brochures depicting actors brandishing guns . Show a seductive woman gripping a gun and you have the ultimate sales pitch . Bob Kronovet pops a videocassette into the VCR and invites a guest to watch the trailers from a trio of low-budget films his company has produced . It doesn ' t take long for the action to commence . * Fists fly . Guns fire . People fall_down dead . A partially-nude woman gets sliced_up the belly by a madman named Jack . Two lifeless women sit side_by_side , their blood-smeared necks slit from ear to ear . &quot; I don ' t believe any of these films are violent just for violence ' s sake , &quot; Kronovet explains -- perhaps a little tongue-in-cheek -- over the sounds of women screaming and guns blazing in &quot; Deadly Eyes , &quot; &quot; L.A. Task_Force &quot; and &quot; Blind Vengeance. &quot; Kronovet is president of Gun for Hire Films , a small production company that is selling its product to foreign buyers at AFM . &quot; At Gun for Hire Films , we have a moral in our stories . The moral is very simple . The good_guy wins , the bad_guy loses hard , &quot; he says in an interview at which he hands a guest a complimentary key chain with a dangling miniature revolver . To be sure , there are companies like Capella International , Miramax or Ciby 2000 that offer quality films with A-list actors and directors at the AFM , but most buyers come_to find gunplay and sex . For discerning buyers , they can purchase such higher-quality films as &quot; Nell &quot; with Jodie Foster from PolyGram Film International , Jack Nicholson in &quot; The Crossing Guard &quot; from Miramax and &quot; Two Bits &quot; with Al Pacino and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio from Capella . In addition , there are nine films for_sale that were well-received at the Sundance Film Festival . But whether it ' s the promise of an action film_starring Jean-Claude Van Damme , which Imperial Entertainment is pre-selling months before the untitled film is even shot , buyers know they aren ' t necessarily coming_to AFM to purchase art-house pictures . Those film companies that have artsy dramas and comedies for_sale , find that they just don ' t sell like hard action movies or erotic thrillers . &quot; Dogs Bark Blue , &quot; a family drama about two boys trying to work_through the death of their father , proved to be a tough sell , according to Scott Wiseman , executive_vice_president of Falcon Arts &amp; Entertainment . On the other hand , he has had success with &quot; Hard Evidence , &quot; which he describes as &quot; a ' Lethal Weapon ' kind of action film -- car chases , explosions , gunshots. &quot; Wiseman said foreign buyers rarely want to know about the plots of his movies . &quot; I had some buyers from Brazil who came_in and said they wanted erotic pictures with a story line , &quot; Wiseman recalled with a laugh . &quot; I looked_at them and said , ' Yeah , one or the other , which one do you want ? I got them both. ' &quot; Knowing that censorship varies from country to country , some sellers shoot several versions of their films . &quot; Improper Conduct , &quot; a story of sexual_harassment in the workplace from Everest Entertainment , was filmed in three versions : G-rated for American television , an R-rated version for late-night cable , and an even stronger version for video outlets . &quot; Japan would like a lot of sex but not violence and sex combined , &quot; said Jag Mundhra , president of Everest . &quot; But many European markets want stronger films. &quot; Buyers from Eastern Europe , where communist governments once prevented gratuitous violence or erotic entertainment , now want both , AFM vendors say . &quot; We distribute to Eastern Europe and they do not want films that are cut , &quot; said Arthur Schweitzer , president of Cinevest Entertainment Group . &quot; They ' ll take gratuitous violence . . . . On the other side , we deal with Islamic republics and these countries , whether they be Malaysia or Pakistan or other countries , have strict censorship of gratuitous violence. &quot; Ginka Andreeva , president of Multi Video Centre in Sofia , Bulgaria , said action and science_fiction films are particularly popular in her country , and added that there is no restriction on violent content in films shown there . &quot; People like to see them , &quot; she said of action films . &quot; Personally , I prefer melodrama. &quot; Not every country wants shoot-em-ups . Arni Samuelsson , a theater-owner from Reykjavik , said moviegoers in his native Iceland want to see the level of violence in films toned_down . &quot; They are asking us if possibly we would not bring them this type of film anymore , &quot; he said . Sometimes it isn ' t the violence itself that attracts foreign buyers , filmmakers say , it ' s any action on the screen . &quot; It could be a chase film , there doesn ' t have to be violence and death , &quot; said Shauna Shapiro Jackson , executive_vice_president of Showcase Entertainment . &quot; The foreign buyers like stunts , &quot; Jackson said . &quot; It ' s not necessarily how many people get killed in the movie . I tend to not pick_up films that are too bloody because that film does tend to be a censorship problem. &quot; Cinequanon Pictures International is featuring &quot; Skinner , &quot; from Nagy , the ex-boyfriend of alleged Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss who single-handledy scandalized Columbia Pictures last summer . Nagy even tossed a cocktail_party the other night at Tatou in Beverly Hills , bringing along &quot; Carlotta , &quot; who an aide to Nagy said was once one of Heidi ' s girls . Asked the premise of &quot; Skinner , &quot; the aide replied : &quot; Basically , it ' s about a serial_killer who , after murdering his victims -- all_of whom are women -- he skins them and wears the skin as a trophy . It ' s a very dark version of ' Silence of the Lambs ' with a Nagy twist to it . He made the film to exorcise the demons from his relationship with Heidi. &quot; The dilemma for some sellers at AFM is how do you compete with companies that are offering films filled with sex and violence ? One company that faced that dilemma was Live Entertainment , which has the foreign rights to a small-budget film called &quot; The Beans of Egypt , Maine. &quot; The movie_stars Martha Plimpton , Rutger Hauer and Kelly Lynch and is based on the critically praised novel of the same name . While the film will be released domestically under that title by I.R.S. Media , Live Entertainment has been marketing the film at AFM under the racier title &quot; Forbidden Choices. &quot; That has producer Rosilyn Heller upset . &quot; It sounds like an exploitation movie , practically , &quot; Heller said . &quot; We said ( to Live ) , ' We ' ve got such a unique title , why change it to something that is so totally forgettable ? &quot; ' A spokeswoman for Live Entertainment said &quot; Forbidden Choices &quot; is only a working title . &quot; We feel the picture is a commercial picture , &quot; she said . &quot; Our goal is to market it in the best way possible . For this market , we decided this was the strongest way to market this picture . No final_decision has been made on the release name of the title . This is simply how we are selling it. &quot;</TEXT>
