   <TEXT> To hide from an ex-boyfriend she feared , Yvette Miller used to spend weekends at the homes of friends and relatives . But on Monday mornings , there was no escaping . By her account , Miller would arrive_at her job as a department_store security_guard in San Francisco , only to find the ex-boyfriend waiting there . Mainly he would taunt and threaten , she says , but sometimes he slapped and choked her . A stalker knows , Miller said , &quot; if they can ' t catch you at_home , they can catch you at work. &quot; Miller ' s story illustrates the way domestic violence and romantic disputes are spilling into the workplace . Long before the O.J. Simpson murder case put a spotlight on the issue , employers and employees were coping_with the fallout of domestic violence . When these disputes erupt , &quot; you don ' t just declare a free_zone or a neutral zone at the workplace , &quot; said Los Angeles Police Lt . John Lane , an expert on stalking cases . In fact , the workplace often is a vicious battleground . That is particularly true for people who , like Miller , leave their homes and hide with friends or in battered women ' s shelters to escape abuse . In those cases , &quot; the one place where the spouse or significant other knows where to find her is at_work , &quot; said Assemblywoman Dede Alpert ( D-Coronado ) , former chairwoman of the Legislative Women ' s Caucus . Statistics show that in this form of workplace violence , it ' s almost always a case of men attacking women . Boyfriends and husbands , both current and former , commit more_than 13 # 000 acts of violence against women in the workplace every year , according to estimates in a U.S. Justice_Department report released two weeks ago . Most of these incidents are non-rape assaults , but the figures also include robberies and rapes . Some employers deal with the issue simply -- and frequently illegally -- by firing or suspending the workers dogged by domestic problems . Other firms struggle to craft a fair balance between keeping the company safe for all employees while protecting the rights of the worker who is being stalked . Partly because of a lack of research and partly because many battered women do not want to acknowledge spousal abuse because of the stigma , the economic toll of domestic violence may be impossible to measure . Experts say , however , that employers face substantial costs in the form of medical_bills , legal_fees , increased absenteeism and lower productivity linked to workers dealing with domestic abuse . At their worst , disputes that invade the workplace are deadly . One much-cited tragedy was the murder of seven people at a Sunnyvale defense firm in 1988 when a computer engineer -- obsessed with a female employee who had long spurned his advances -- went_on a shotgun rampage . ( The woman was shot but survived. ) Last year in California , there were similar homicides or attempted homicides , including shootings in the Dana Point post_office , at an Escondido dental_practice and outside a Sacramento office_building . But the vast majority of the crimes are far less sensational . Sometimes an angry husband comes_in and strikes a wife working_at a fast-food restaurant or factory during the night_shift , when fewer guards and supervisors are_on duty . Other times , on-the-job harassment consists mainly of barrages of nasty phone_calls , often intended to humiliate the victim in front of bosses or co-workers . One woman , who asked not to be identified , said her ex-boyfriend sends faxes -- realizing they will first be seen by her co-workers -- accusing her of allowing a male acquaintance to sexually abuse her 6-year-old daughter . Even when the problem is kept private from co-workers , domestic clashes take a toll on the careers and job performance of the workers suffering the abuse . They sometimes lose out on promotions -- or get fired . Battered women frequently miss work or arrive late . Their appearance and self-esteem can worsen , destroying their ability to gain the confidence of co-workers . They often seem distracted . &quot; You can ' t concentrate . You can ' t focus_on anything , &quot; said Sheila Hazlett , a job placement specialist from North Hollywood . She speaks from personal experience : Her former husband pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor assault charge after she told police that he repeatedly beat her . Long after the violence ends , Hazlett says , the emotional scars of spousal abuse still may plague an employee ' s working life . For more_than one year after leaving her husband , with whom she ran a weekly newspaper , Hazlett paid her bills doing free-lance graphics design and editing . Looking_for a full-time job was out_of_the_question . &quot; I just could not face going_out into the work_force , &quot; she said . &quot; It takes a long_time to get the self-confidence back to even look_for a job. &quot; Hazlett , 55 , also avoided returning to the job market because she feared interviewers might pry into why she left the newspaper . &quot; I would feel myself getting frightened they would ask more ( questions ) , and I didn ' t feel ready to talk_about that with a stranger , &quot; she said . Today , more_than three years since she quit living and working with her ex-husband , Hazlett says she sometimes is &quot; still fearful , constantly looking over my shoulder , feeling very vulnerable. &quot; But with the help of supportive colleagues , Hazlett is working for a nonprofit agency . But Linda , a secretary and office manager who asked that her last_name not be used , says she has been able to perform her job well most days . That , she says , is despite years of beatings and psychological abuse by her husband , whom she is divorcing . Work , she said , &quot; was my salvation . Being away from him was a pleasure. &quot; Still , there have been many days when her work suffered . For instance , she said , her husband would sometimes call her five to 10 times in the course of an eight-hour working_day to badger and threaten her . On other occasions , Linda said , he would take her keys in the morning so she would arrive late to the office , or he would keep her up all night , leaving her exhausted for work the next day . Among employers and employees alike , the potential for deadly domestic violence arouses deep fears . Workplace murderers &quot; not only kill the person they ' re after , but they may kill many others as well , &quot; said Alpert , the legislator from Coronado . These tragedies are far less common than nonfatal assaults . In 1992 , the most recent year for which data is available , 31 women were slain at_work by current or former boyfriends , husbands or other relatives , according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics . Homicides surpassed traffic accidents that year to become the leading killer of women in the workplace , but many_more women were murdered by unknown assailants in robberies than by ex-lovers . In any case , to try to prevent future tragedies , Alpert sponsored a bill that would enable employers to obtain restraining orders to protect employees stalked or threatened on_the_job . The bill , approved by the Assembly and awaiting a state Senate vote , is designed for employees who will not seek the restraining orders themselves , perhaps out of fear that it would further antagonize their harassers . Meanwhile , women ' s advocates say that many employers do little to protect or counsel victims of domestic abuse . Karen Nussbaum , director of the U.S. Labor_Department ' s women ' s bureau , urges employers to provide the same type of help for victims of domestic violence that they offer to people with drug and alcohol problems . &quot; These are not just personnel problems you avoid by getting_rid_of an individual , &quot; she said . Many workers fail to tell their bosses about their fears of violence at_work because &quot; they ' re afraid their job may be jeopardized , &quot; said the LAPD ' s Lane . &quot; Most employers are very aware of the problem of workplace violence , and if they feel a real danger is presented , the easiest way to deal with it is to terminate the employee , &quot; Lane added . As for Miller , the retail security_guard , she said she got_into trouble at_work and wound_up quitting because of several incidents involving her ex-boyfriend . One of the worst moments , she said , was when the ex-boyfriend came_through her store &quot; ranting and raving &quot; as he looked_for her . She said her supervisors told her , &quot; ' You ' re a good_person . We like you . But we don ' t want problems to be brought_in here. ' &quot; Miller has moved to another retail security job and , in a June court hearing , won a three-year restraining order against her ex-boyfriend . Workers who are unfairly fired by domestic violence-wary employers can sue for reinstatement or damages under state and federal laws , including statutes barring wrongful discharge and discrimination on the basis of gender or marital_status . As a practical matter , though , it ' s hard for many women to pursue such cases in court . &quot; They ' ve got a lot of problems in their lives besides this , &quot; said Garry Mathiason , a San Francisco management lawyer who specializes in workplace violence . On the other hand , employers must weigh the ethical and practical questions involved in keeping workers whose lives -- along with the lives of co-workers and customers -- are threatened by stalkers . The legal equation , Mathiason said , is : &quot; Do I keep the person employed , let someone get shot and then get sued for negligent retention ( of an employee ) ? Or do I let the person go and get sued for wrongful dismissal ? &quot; Mathiason says that , on two or three occasions , he has advised clients to suspend employees whose lives appear to be in danger on_the_job as a way to protect the safety of others at the work site . He says he counsels his clients , however , to continue paying the workers and to bring them back when the danger fades . Employers also use other options . For instance , when employers suspect violence is possible , they sometimes add security_guards and relocate the employee to make_it harder for a potential assailant to find her . Also , many employers offer employee assistance programs for staff_members with personal problems including domestic violence . The specialists -- typically outside psychologists and other counselors on contract -- give advice on dealing with the emotional consequences of spousal abuse along with , when necessary , tips on finding a shelter . One of the benefits of these programs , at least in theory , is that employees can get help confidentially -- an important consideration for a problem as stigmatizing as domestic violence . Supervisors , meanwhile , avoid getting directly involved in messy family disputes -- unless there is a threat of workplace violence and they need to take action to protect staff_members . &quot; Everyone knows if you get sucked into the middle of a spousal dispute , there ' s no end to it , &quot; said Frank Cronin , a Los Angeles management lawyer who specializes in employment issues . Rod Libbey , Bank of America ' s manager of employee assistance programs , added that &quot; these kinds of problems are highly personal and it ' s more_than likely that someone will follow_through and get help with a confidential resource &quot; than with a supervisor . Besides , Libbey said , &quot; you really don ' t want managers getting_into areas where they aren ' t competent , because they might give bad advice. &quot; At Bank of America , employee assistance counselors indicate that domestic violence caseloads have risen noticeably in recent years , a trend Libbey attributes to increasing media attention . However , problems involving drug and alcohol_abuse , along with issues related to divorce and raising teen-agers , still come_up more frequently than does domestic violence , say Libbey and other employee assistance specialists . For employees such_as Kimberly , an accountant for a retailing company who did not want her last_name used , frequent support from her employer has been a huge help in protecting her from an ex-boyfriend . The company ' s security_staff and receptionists have been given descriptions of her ex-boyfriend and are_on the alert to make_sure that he does not sneak into her office . Her bosses let her change her work schedule to make her routine less predictable and make_it more difficult for her ex-boyfriend to follow her . Kimberly also was given permission to repeatedly take_time_off to go_to court hearings and file police complaints , without losing vacation or sick days . Still , even at a supportive company , problems emerge . To stop her ex-boyfriend from leaving threatening messages on her voice mail , Kimberly asked if all_of her incoming calls could be routed through the switchboard . When her boss balked , she dropped the idea . Kimberly says her work performance has held_up well despite her concerns but sometimes , when she becomes preoccupied with her ex-boyfriend ' s threats , mistakes find their way into her calculations . And on the week when a judge sentenced her ex-boyfriend to jail for violating a restraining order protecting her , Kimberly said , &quot; I just sat at my desk . I couldn ' t do anything. &quot;</TEXT>
