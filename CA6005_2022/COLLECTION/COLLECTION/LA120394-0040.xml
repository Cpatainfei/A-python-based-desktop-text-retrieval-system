   <HEADLINE> NEW CONTRACT MAY SPICE_UP LAX FOOD ; TRAVEL : AIRPORT PANEL IS EXPECTED TO APPROVE TRANSFER OF SOME DINING SERVICES TO SUCH OPERATORS AS WOLFGANG PUCK AND MCDONALD ' S . DISNEY WOULD HELP WITH DESIGN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thirty-four years of culinary hegemony is expected to end soon at Los Angeles International Airport , as officials plan to transfer restaurant operations from a single concessionaire to an eclectic mix of operators headlined by Wolfgang Puck , McDonald ' s and the Disney Co . Among the proposed innovations is the transformation of the airport ' s landmark Theme Building into a &quot; Space_Age cafe , &quot; of Disney design which would offer food created by some of the city ' s finest restaurants . If an evaluation panel ' s recommendations are approved Tuesday by the Airport Commission , about 40 % of the food service at the airport will be taken from long-time operator Host International Inc. and placed in the hands of seven restaurants or partnerships . City officials are so sure that the commission will approve the proposal that they have already scheduled a news_conference , before the vote , to introduce the partners in the food plan . The gastronomic revolution for the airport ' s 46 million annual passengers is supposed to be completed in early 1996 , with some outlets opening sooner . Previous timelines for the project , however , have proved overly optimistic . Mayor Richard Riordan ' s appointees on the Airport Commission have pledged to make the nation ' s fourth-busiest passenger airport more accommodating to passengers . They also said they want to maximize profits and would not institute a price limit on food , as the airport staff had proposed . John Wayne Airport in Orange County and other airports have such price_controls . The Riordan team projects that , once all new leases for the airport ' s restaurants and bars are final , the minimum annual rent should at least double , to $ 10 million annually . An eight-month search focused_on adding pizazz to airport fare that has been dominated by boxed sandwiches , vending machine pizzas and steamed hot dogs . A panel of airport employees and commissioners sought proposals with a distinctly Southern California flair and those that reflected Los Angeles ' cultural diversity . * The most unusual proposal , though , is the L.A. Encounter Restaurant , which would extend the Theme Building ' s spaceship design to its interior , complete with waiters in space garb , interactive displays , holograms and other high-tech entertainment . Disney Imagineering would design the restaurant ; the food operation would be in the hands of CA One Services , which has food operations at 37 other airports . The food service_firm , in turn , would contract with some of the city ' s best-known restaurants to provide their signature creations for the &quot; L.A. Encounter &quot; menu . The Theme Building ' s perennial problem in attracting visitors to its isolated location would be attacked by shuttling patrons to and from the restaurant in a space probe-style van , perhaps with a driver wearing a space alien costume . &quot; L.A. Encounter &quot; would provide a &quot; campy and fun &quot; greeting for visitors and a destination even for locals who would not otherwise be at the airport , predicted lawyer Lisa Specht , who is helping to put the deal together . &quot; It ' s phenomenal . It ' s the kind of thing you look_at and say ' Wow ! ' &quot; said Airport Commission President Ted Stein , who has guided the remaking of the food concessions . Elsewhere in the airport , the Daily Grill chain would bring its menu of American fare to a soon-to-be-expanded mezzanine in the Tom Bradley International Terminal . The restaurant would seat 283 . The other half of the international mezzanine would be devoted to foreign foods -- Mexican , Japanese and Chinese . Elsewhere in the terminal , the Chatsworth-based Rhino Chasers micro-brewery would expand into the bar business , offering obscure beer brands in surfing safari surroundings . * Puck would expand his Wolfgang Puck ' s Express concept , now at a handful of locations , at Terminal 2 . The restaurant would serve gourmet pizzas and salads in the mode of Spago , one of the celebrity chef ' s signature restaurants . The plan also calls_for five McDonald ' s outlets and for new coffee and Haagen Dazs ice_cream shops . The striking success of a Starbuck ' s coffee outlet in Terminal 5 has triggered plans for even more designer coffee businesses -- possibly including coffee pushcarts in all terminals . A general operator remains to be chosen for most of the remaining restaurant and bar space at the airport . Host International is a candidate to operate those 23 facilities . What would be done with the projected new earnings at the airport remains in doubt . Riordan continues to hold_on to his hope that airport revenue can be diverted to the city ' s general fund , perhaps to help hire more police_officers . But so far , federal law has prohibited transfer of airport revenue to activities outside of the airport .</TEXT>
