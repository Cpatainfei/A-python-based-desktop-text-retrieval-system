   <TEXT> FBI Director Louis J . Freeh is calling_for tighter controls on student visas and alien marriages as part of an intensified effort to curb terrorism by aliens in the United States , it was learned Thursday . Freeh made the recommendations to Deputy Atty . Gen . Jamie S . Gorelick , who asked him to review policies and practices on immigrants entering and leaving the United States in response to the World Trade Center bombing and killings outside CIA headquarters -- both linked to aliens . The recommendations , now under review by the Justice_Department , also proposed strengthening investigative powers against suspected &quot; undesirable aliens , &quot; accelerating deportation appeal proceedings and limiting U.S. participation in a visa waiver pilot_program under which 9 1 / 2 million foreigners entered the country in fiscal 1994 . &quot; Aliens coming_to the United States to engage in illegal conduct know that one of the easiest ways to enter and remain in the country is by requesting asylum , &quot; Freeh told Gorelick . Under current procedures , they are asked either to post a small bond guaranteeing their appearance at a future hearing or are released on_their_own recognizance . &quot; Any legal procedures devised to address such aliens will fail unless they include provisions for the detention and removal of the alien , &quot; Freeh said . &quot; At present , too many of these aliens simply blend into American society and never return for their immigration hearing. &quot; Freeh was acting in his capacity as director of the Office of Investigative Agency Policies , a Justice_Department unit created a year ago to end interagency conflicts between the FBI , Drug Enforcement Administration , Marshals Service and Immigration and Naturalization Service . He made the recommendation Sept . 26 in a four-page memorandum to Gorelick , which was then included in the Nov . 18 annual report of the new Justice_Department office . A copy was provided to The Times . A Justice_Department official said that the Freeh proposals are part of a larger government-wide review of steps to prevent terrorism in the United States . Freeh said that two categories of foreigners requiring &quot; additional scrutiny &quot; are those who enter the country on student visas but do not abide_by the terms of the visa and those who &quot; engage in ' sham marriages ' with American citizens or permanent resident aliens &quot; solely to become legal residents . Immigrants seeking entry on either grounds &quot; should undergo thorough scrutiny at the outset , as well as some form of continuing scrutiny , &quot; Freeh said . Follow-up investigation of students would include reviewing their academic records . &quot; Obviously , the intent is not to harass an alien who lawfully opts either to study in this country or to marry an American , &quot; Freeh said . &quot; Instead , the intent is to ascertain which aliens are using these avenues as a means to remain in this country indefinitely . . . to engage in unlawful conduct . I recognize that certain legitimate privacy interests are implicated. &quot; In deportation or other proceedings against aliens , Freeh noted that government_agencies do not use &quot; protected or classified information , &quot; including that from electronic eavesdropping and confidential sources , because existing law does not provide adequate means to protect that information . Its disclosure , he said , &quot; could compromise ongoing investigations. &quot; He called_for establishing a special closed court hearing on the use of such sensitive information at which only the government would appear . Freeh urged the Justice_Department to reconsider &quot; terrorist alien removal &quot; legislation that would create a court to conduct &quot; special removal hearings &quot; against immigrants who take_part in international terrorist activities . That legislation , backed by the Administration , was passed_by the Senate in a 1993 crime bill that did not become law . Freeh criticized deportation appeal procedures on grounds that they often delay action for many years . &quot; Failure to remove them swiftly from the United States simply exposes our country to needless risks , &quot; he said . Under present practices , some parts of an immigrant ' s asylum file at the INS are not available to other law_enforcement agencies , Freeh noted . &quot; The FBI has noted that , in terrorist investigations , those unavailable portions of an alien ' s asylum file could prove invaluable , &quot; he said . &quot; Indeed , those portions could provide sufficient leads to prevent the commission of further terrorist acts or crimes. &quot; He called_for considering full or expanded disclosure of immigrant asylum files . Freeh also endorsed giving terrorism investigators &quot; roving authority &quot; under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to intercept communications . That authority , now available in certain criminal investigations , would allow targeting an individual ' s telephone_conversations over any phone , rather than limiting surveillance to specific telephone_numbers . &quot; Such authority would enhance the FBI ' s ability to investigate aliens ' terrorist activities in the United States , &quot; Freeh said .</TEXT>
