   <HEADLINE> IN THE GARDEN : FALL IS THE BEST TIME TO PLANT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While working in the front_yard the other day , a neighbor told me about the new raised beds he ' d built over the summer in his back yard , sadly concluding , &quot; Too_bad it ' s too late to plant. &quot; Whoa ! Not true ! Why do you think I ' m digging_up the yard right now ? It ' s actually the perfect time to plant , and the perfect weather to do_it in . It ' s sunny , warm and breezy , and usually pleasant enough at this time of the year to keep you from working_up a sweat , even if you ' re trying to dig_up tree roots the size of Volkswagens in preparation for planting . In fact , from October through December is the best time to plant just about anything . Not just seasonal things like lettuce and pansies , but trees , shrubs , ground_covers , herbs , bulbs and especially native plants and drought-resistant things . It ' s far easier to list the exceptions to the &quot; fall is the best time &quot; rule -- roses and fruit_trees are more plentiful and considerably cheaper in January , and some tropicals , such_as bougainvillea , citrus and hibiscus , are_better planted as the weather warms_up in May or June . And , of course , there are those seasonal things , many planted in fall , but others , such_as petunias and tomatoes , planted in spring . Planted now , trees and shrubs have the time to grow a substantial root system in the warm autumn soil , and a low sun and winter rains will help , making life easier because you won ' t have to water as often . So_much easier that it ' s just about the only time of the year I do plant ( except for those seasonal things ) . When spring comes the plant is able to sustain the growth that naturally explodes at that time of the year . If you wait until spring to plant , growth will be less sure-footed , and there will be less of it . You also will need to spend a lot more time watering , and use a good_deal more water in summer because the roots of new plants won ' t reach very far into the soil , so they ' ll still be dependent_on you or the sprinklers . The benefits of fall planting are especially true for native and other drought-resistant plants . Without all_the root growth made in fall and winter , the plants are going_to need frequent watering in summer , which makes them susceptible to various root_rots brought_on by over-watering . You will be walking a thin line between too_much and too_little water , a line too easily crossed . that ' s why you ' ll see so many native plant sales listed during the autumn months . Don ' t be discouraged by what you see at nurseries or plant sales . Most plants do not look their best right now , but put them in the ground and give them a_few months and they ' ll burst_forth come spring . Seasonal plants , listed in the box on this page , can only be planted in the fall because they require cool weather to grow in and they bloom or mature during spring ' s warming days . The vegetables are called the &quot; cool-weather crops &quot; and the flowers are called &quot; spring flowers , &quot; as opposed to &quot; summer flowers. &quot; Thanks to modern nursery practices , you can also plant these flowers in very early spring ( late February and March ) from larger nursery containers and still get a respectable show , but it will be short . Planted now , some of these fall-planted flowers will bloom all winter and spring . Flowers sold in small packs are the best buy now because they have plenty of time to grow in fall and early winter , though if you are really in a hurry for color , you can plant from the larger &quot; color packs &quot; or from 4-inch pots ( these are the best bets in early spring ) . Don ' t overlook sowing things from seed . There are many handsome spring flowers unattainable any other way . Wildflowers , for one . You can also plant bulbs and some nurseries are brim full of them . All can go_into the ground right away , except tulips . In our mild climate , tulips need some chilling in your refrigerator . About six weeks should do_it , though many good tulip growers wait until the end of December to plant , doing the work over the holidays . Remember that tulips and many other traditional East Coast bulbs bloom for a very short time in Southern California , a week , or two at the most , while many of the unusual mild climate bulbs , such_as freesias and sparaxis , or ranunculus and watsonias , bloom for a month or more . Tulips are also a one-shot bulb ; they will not bloom a second year and , after they bloom , you should pull them out before the foliage disappears and you can ' t find them . The mild-climate bulbs , on the other hand , are quite at_home here and bloom year after year and even multiply ( though many gardeners start fresh with ranunculus each fall since they are likely to rot if left in over the summer ) . The cole crops are king of the fall , winter and spring vegetable_garden -- broccoli , Brussels_sprouts , cabbage and cauliflower ( and kohlrabi ) . All are easy enough to grow and do_best planted from nursery packs or from transplants that you ' ve raised yourself . that ' s because broccoli and cauliflower , in particular , tend to have a crook between roots and leaves that should be buried underground when you plant , or the plants will not stand_up straight . Pull_off the bottom two leaves and plant so that crook is underground . It ' s similar to planting a tomato deep . It ' s a good idea to dust on some B.T. , a non-poisonous biological control for the cabbage worms that relish all_the cole crops . Do_it right after planting if you ' ve seen the white butterflies , the adults , fluttering around your garden laying eggs . Snails also love these fall-planted vegetables , so watch for them . You can also plant most of the leaf and root_crops , such_as spinach or beets ( and most Oriental vegetables ) . All are_best grown from seed that sprouts quickly in the warm autumn weather .
