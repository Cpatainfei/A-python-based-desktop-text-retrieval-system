   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : GARDEN GROVE ; ASTRONOMY PROGRAM GETS STELLAR MARKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Peering through a telescope for the first time , Betty Vang , 14 , gasped as the moon , magnified 125 times , jumped into view . &quot; Oh , it ' s so cool ! It ' s so big ! &quot; she exclaimed as she squinted into the eyepiece on a recent weekday night . As dozens of other students jostled for their turn , Betty added , &quot; It looked_like a big piece of Swiss_cheese , but there ' s more holes in the moon. &quot; She was one of about 100 students and parents who attended a special program at James Irvine Intermediate School designed to involve parents in school activities and their children ' s education . During the hourlong program , Bruce Crowe , a member of the Orange County Astronomers Society , showed color slides of the planets and their moons , which were taken by the NASA probe Voyager . Describing the planets , Crowe pointed_out that not all_of them have rocky surfaces like Mars and Venus . For example , Saturn , Jupiter , Uranus and Neptune are composed of gas . He also showed slides of Halley ' s Comet and told the audience that comets are essentially dirty balls of gas and ice . As they approach the sun , they shed minute particles that can form tails millions of miles long that can be seen from the Earth . &quot; You could take a comet ' s tail , stretched over millions of miles , and pack it up into a suitcase and walk away with it . that ' s how thin it is , &quot; he said . Afterward , members of the audience lined_up for a close-up view of the bright half-moon overhead . Through the 10-inch reflector telescope , the countless craters that mottled the moon ' s gray and white surface were easily visible . Shadows that spilled across the moonscape made ridges and craters stand_out in sharp relief , offering an almost three-dimensional image . Crowe also aimed the telescope at the constellation Orion , providing a view of a small cluster of stars as well as a nebula , a wispy halo of interstellar gas . Parents and students alike praised the program , saying that it generates interest in learning outside the classroom . &quot; It ' s great for students to come here and see things like that , &quot; said Hector Hernandez , 38 . &quot; It ' s good . I found_out that the planets are not like Earth and that they ' re made of gas . They ' ve got moons and rings and stuff. &quot; &quot; It was fun . I got_to see the moon up close . It looked_like a mountain with a lot of holes , &quot; said Jose Alba , 12 . Learning about the stars by using a telescope , instead of learning facts through a textbook , &quot; makes_it more fun , &quot; he said . The experience left Betty a little philosophical . With a glance toward the stars twinkling overhead , she said : &quot; Maybe someone ' s looking_at us too. &quot; JON NALICK</TEXT>
