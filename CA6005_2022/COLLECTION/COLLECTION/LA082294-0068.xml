   <TEXT> &quot; What beasts our civil_servants are ! &quot; -- Nikolai Gogol , &quot; Diary of a Madman &quot; In this birthplace of V . I . Lenin , the most noxious reminder of the Communist past is not the giant bald statue still towering above the Volga_River , or the ration coupons still doled_out for meat and butter . It is the fact that many people still live_in fear . They don ' t fear the KGB , they don ' t fear the Communist_Party ; those days are truly gone . They fear their own local leaders , the men who hold livelihoods in their hands , and the petty officials with rubber_stamps and metal seals who do their bidding . &quot; In essence , we live under an overblown form of bureaucracy , &quot; an Ulyanovsk businessman said . &quot; This power is still extremely strong ; it still has the ability to repress and control. &quot; Then he asked that his name not be used , for fear his business would suffer . As if the entire country didn ' t recognize the phenomenon he was describing at its most extreme . As if the president himself had not recently growled publicly about &quot; nasty little officials. &quot; In the old Soviet_Union , the Communist_Party controlled nearly everything , and &quot; the apparatus &quot; carried_out its orders . In the new Russia , the ideological component is gone , but the overweening power of officialdom remains , embodied in the bureaucratic obstacle course that even the simplest of transactions can often still entail , and in the nearly unchecked power of local bosses . Where else does a woman need a note from a gynecologist confirming her feminine health to get a driver ' s license ? Where else does the recipient of an overseas parcel end_up standing_in 16 different lines at the airport customs office to pick it up ? It is a more subtle affliction , this bureaucratic yoke , than the old monolithic Communist tyranny , but it is one of the main reasons -- in addition to the generalized lawlessness and old habits of thought -- why it will take Russia so very long to make its new society run Western-style . If it ever does . &quot; We have a very strong bureaucracy and a weak state , &quot; author Alexander I . Solzhenitsyn concluded recently after a two-month odyssey across Russia . Solzhenitsyn would have particularly noticed officialdom ' s might in the backwaters he passed_through . The Kremlin may proclaim privatization and free_trade and land_reform , but if it then takes years to implement those decrees , it is because greater_power than ever lies_in the hands of officials &quot; in the places , &quot; as Russians refer to their far-flung provinces . &quot; On the local level , there is dictatorship , &quot; said Nikolai Povtarev , former head of the regional council in Ulyanovsk . &quot; If a person suddenly takes a different position , and , say , he ' s the director of an enterprise , suddenly he ' s being checked by the fire inspectors , by the tax inspectors , construction is frozen and so on. &quot; If , during the perestroika era , the bureaucracy was blamed for &quot; braking &quot; Mikhail S . Gorbachev ' s reforms , now it is reviled for pursuing its own venal interests rather than advancing Russia ' s transition to a civilized free-market system . In the popular perception , it is slowly giving_up its death grip on state property only in exchange for a river of bribes . The main difference between the old bureaucracy and the new , said Alexei Golovkov , former chief of the Russian government apparatus , is that now , along with the simple pleasure of power , bureaucrats have a tremendous new incentive to keep procedures tangled and difficult : money . &quot; A class of people have appeared who are ready to pay_for everything , &quot; Golovkov said , &quot; and if , before , a bureaucrat had a_few little privileges , now a normal bureaucrat can afford 10 times more_than he did 10 years ago. &quot; The great challenge of painstakingly building a normal civil society , one in which people know and defend their rights , hinges in part on whether Russian democracy can stamp_out the trait known as proizvol -- arbitrariness , rogue power , clout wielded irresponsibly . Rooted deep in Russian life , official proizvol is perhaps best depicted in literature by the 19th-Century tragicomic genius Nikolai Gogol . In his classic story &quot; The Overcoat , &quot; a timid clerk named Akaky Akakievich is given such a merciless dressing-down by an &quot; Important Person &quot; that the trauma , coupled with the loss of his overcoat , kills him . &quot; Where do you think you are ? &quot; the Important Person demands of Akakievich . &quot; Don ' t you know how things are conducted here ? It ' s high_time you knew that first of all your application must be handed in at the main_office , then taken_to the chief clerk , then to the departmental director , then to my secretary , who then submits it to me for consideration . . . . &quot; Soviet founder Lenin ran_into what is ironically referred to here as &quot; the deathless bureaucracy &quot; when he returned to work after a four-month illness and found that his 16 government committees had metamorphosed into 120 . And President Boris N . Yeltsin has run_up against a similar phenomenon . He has repeatedly demanded cuts_in the government staff and publicly berated his administration chief , Vladimir Kvasov , but to little avail . The newspaper Kuranty disclosed this month that the Russian government is actually supporting an administrative machine that costs proportionately half again as much as its Soviet counterpart . No one gives_up power voluntarily , Ernst Cherny notes in the Kuranty article , which carries the headline , &quot; The Official Can Devour Russia. &quot; In Ulyanovsk , an aviation and agricultural region renowned as possibly the most Old_Guard bastion in Russia , no one seems to give_up power at all . Local journalists and officials cite a game of political musical chairs that results in a permanent stasis : The former head of the regional Communist_Party is now the regional governor ; the city Communist_Party head is now a deputy governor ; a former second secretary of the city party now heads Ulyanovsk ' s biggest commercial_bank ; former ideology chieftains now handle the region ' s foreign economic ties ( what few there are ) and its pension_fund . &quot; After the 1991 coup there was such euphoria that now there would be a new life , &quot; said Alexander Kuznetsov , editor of Skify , or Scythians , a business newspaper . &quot; Nothing of the kind . The bureaucrats all act_as they did . Only the ideological character is different ; what was under an ideological cover before -- Lenin , the party -- is now revealed as pure power , pure officialdom . &quot; In the last 10 years , the country has changed phenomenally , &quot; he added . &quot; But as for bureaucratic principles and orders , they don ' t change as fast as_many would like. &quot; Especially in Ulyanovsk . Like the old Soviet_Union , Ulyanovsk , home to 1.5 million people , is still a place where you feel as if just about anything can happen to you . Entrepreneur Oleg Berlent got_the_best restaurant in town up and running , doing all_the renovation and investment to make the Registan a luxurious watering_hole the_likes_of which Ulyanovsk had never seen . And may never see again . As local journalists and politicians tell it , Berlent somehow got_on the wrong side of the Ulyanovsk administration and was informed that his restaurant would have to be turned_over to the local police_station to be used in an expansion of its detention_cells . A similar fate befell many of the city ' s kiosk owners , who were suddenly informed last spring that they would have to relinquish their licensed spots at the center of town or close_down . And vendors at Ulyanovsk ' s main &quot; Thing Market &quot; -- a flea-market-like institution common to most Russian cities -- were abruptly moved to a remote spot near the airport . Then there were the entrepreneurs who shipped 8 million rubles -- about $ 4 # 000 -- worth of candy and cookies from a neighboring region , only to be told they would have to pay 2 million rubles for an Ulyanovsk &quot; certificate of quality. &quot; They ultimately avoided the certificate , but it required a month of running from official to official . The examples go_on and on . The victims of proizvol are not totally without recourse . They can appeal_to a new system of arbitration courts ; they can sue ; they can bribe . In the extreme , they can try to get help from Moscow reform chiefs , and sometimes the Kremlin will intervene , as it did when it leaned_on recalcitrant Ulyanovsk leaders to privatize more shops and enterprises . But Moscow is far away , and the real power in Ulyanovsk is Yuri Goryachev , the backward-looking governor who still believes universal ration coupons are the best defense for the poor and still makes whistle-stop tours of farm towns like the Communist chiefs of old . When Georgy Stupnikov , Yeltsin ' s official representative in Ulyanovsk , calls Goryachev on their special government line , Goryachev often just hangs_up when he hears Stupnikov ' s voice , Stupnikov said . So_much for Moscow . Despite repeated requests , neither Goryachev nor several top Ulyanovsk officials would agree to even a brief interview with The Times . So_much for America . Still , it would be unfair to say Goryachev and the Ulyanovsk apparatus resist reform full force . Their attitude , said Kuznetsov of Skify , is : &quot; Go_ahead , own something , but you should know that if I decide I don ' t like it , I ' ll close you down with a decree or a resolution or taxes or some_other way. &quot; Sitting in his modest office , Kuznetsov , a sizable , mop-headed man with a friendly , bespectacled look , mused aloud : &quot; If they shut us down tomorrow . . . &quot; &quot; We ' d be sad , but we would n ' t make a fuss , &quot; finished his general director , Nikolai Frolov . &quot; We ' d look_for something else to open . . . , &quot; Kuznetsov said . Like the kiosk owners , they would not go_to court because local officials could always find some violation of tax laws or the building_code or some_other excuse to justify the closing . Kuznetsov and Frolov , though they are natural entrepreneurs , have a long way to go before they can fit Yeltsin ' s vision of a Russia composed of &quot; a_million owners , instead of a_few millionaires. &quot; An even more disturbing product of Ulyanovsk bureaucracy is Sergei Kruglov , who runs a small commercial store in the center of town . The store is a hole-in-the-wall , with the usual shoddy mix of shoes and radios and doodads , and Kruglov does not plan to fix it up or expand it because he cannot own the space it occupies . He can only lease it . &quot; I invest money , and tomorrow they say , ' It ' s not yours , ' &quot; he said as a saleswoman looked_on disapprovingly and hinted at the trouble he could get_into for speaking out . &quot; Why should I invest ? Even if they give you something for 20 years , they can take it away. &quot; A year ago , Kruglov had started_up a similar small store in a medical clinic , stocking it and investing about $ 300 -- then the equivalent of six months ' salary . After two months , a decree came_out prohibiting shops in &quot; social and cultural buildings &quot; such_as clinics , and he was kicked_out with no compensation . He could have fought the officials who did_it , he said , &quot; but that means you go here , you go there , you may find the truth , but you ' ll lose your health. &quot; Without basic security regarding what they own , it is hard to expect Russians to invest the work and money needed to make things better . And investment is what economists say Russia now needs most . The solution , Russian politicians hope , is a new civil code that will finally regulate most commercial transactions and contracts , giving citizens a better idea of what rights they can brandish when they face overbearing bureaucrats . &quot; The main principles of the sacrosanct nature of private_property are reinforced in the civil code , &quot; said Sergei Alexeyev , one of its authors and main advocates . Of course , there are plenty of pretty rights codified in Russia ' s new constitution , passed last December , but that charter has proved of little help in Ulyanovsk . Ultimately , believes former Russian government administration chief Golovkov , what will change the bureaucrats of Ulyanovsk -- and their counterparts around the country -- is the dawning realization that by maintaining too tight a grip , they are only hurting themselves . In a year or two , he said , Ulyanovsk bureaucrats will look_at the prosperity of their progressive counterparts in Nizhny Novgorod or Chuvashia and understand that when business is allowed to flourish , the entire region can prosper with it . &quot; And then they ' ll face a choice , &quot; Golovkov said : &quot; to live as they are or to live like their neighbors. &quot; That may be questionable , however ; former council chairman Povtarev said that many Ulyanovsk officials are creating &quot; state commercial structures &quot; that let them use the local_government ' s virtual monopoly on trade , commerce and property to turn healthy profits for themselves . Many bureaucrats also openly charge exorbitant rates to give permits or licenses in a reasonable amount_of_time . &quot; I ask them , ' Tell me one thing : What jurisdiction are you , state or private ? ' &quot; Povtarev said . &quot; ' If you ' re commercial , why do you have governmental functions ? ' &quot; The apparatus is becoming an owner , &quot; he said . Golovkov noted that Parliament is also beginning to pass laws that take_effect rather than act_as declarations that need follow-up rulings by ministries and local administrations -- the spaces between the lines that allow_for proizvol -- to come_into force . But chipping_away_at the bureaucratic empire takes time -- months , even years . Povtarev compared officialdom to a hydra ; others call it a swamp or a virus . The activists of Ulyanovsk ' s Anti-Bureaucratic Center , a small group of former anti-Communists who remain a focus of the weak anti-Goryachev opposition , rejoice that the Communist_Party is more or less dead but see officialdom as the great remaining block to freedom . &quot; Especially in Ulyanovsk , with our mentality , officials will be ruling for a long , long_time , &quot; history professor Vladimir Zerkalov said . &quot; That it ' s accomplished its first task is a start , but I won ' t live to see the day that the Anti-Bureaucratic Center can be dissolved. &quot; NEXT : How Russians are slowly mustering the independence of mind that is the key to real self-rule . Opening a Company , Russian-Style Opening a bicycles business in Russia can mean going_through a bureaucratic maze than can take entrepreneurs a month to five months to complete . Here are the steps involved in starting a business : 1 ) GATHER NECESSARY DOCUMENTS Protocol Sobraniya ( meeting protocol ) : The document confirming intention to start a company . It includes a list , complete with addresses , of directors and general director of the company . Ustav ( charter ) : The document specifying what your firm will do . It ' s very lax : A limited_liability company can sell bananas or build missiles . Financial Statement : A letter stating , among other things , that the firm has raised at least half of its founding capital . Separate documents are needed to certify that all applicable dues and charges have been paid . Landlord guaranty letters : Three original letters from the landlord where the company will maintain its legal address . Also , the landlord must provide written proof of the right to lease the premises . Landlords often charge substantial fees for providing these documents , and there is sometimes more_than one person claiming the right to lease premises . 2 ) GET TEMPORARY REGISTRATION An application for must be filled_out at the Registration Chamber of the administrative region . An official will give the application and other required documents to a lawyer who works_at the Registration Chamber . The lawyer informs the applicant what mistakes have been made in the documents . If an error is found , a new set of documents must be made . The documents are brought_back to the chamber and a small fee is paid_for a temporary registration . About a week later , the Registration Chamber issues a card officially proclaiming the temporary registration . The applicant now has 30 days to complete the registration process . 3 ) GO TO POLICE Permission from the local police is needed to obtain an official stamp . No document in Russia is considered legitimate without a stamp . 4 ) GET REGISTRATION_NUMBER The State Statistics Committee will issue a &quot; code , &quot; which is like an official registration_number of your company . They put your code in a computer containing the numbers of all firms . 5 ) GET STAMP With permission papers from the police , a printing_company will agree to make the company ' s stamp . It will take about a week to make the stamp . 6 ) NOTARIZE SIGNATURE CARD To open a bank_account , a signature card is needed with the signatures of all co-founders attested to by a notary_public . 7 ) OPEN BANK_ACCOUNT Choose a bank and open an account.Some banks will not open an account without proof of a tax registration ( see step 9 ) . 8 ) REGISTER WITH PENSION_FUND The company must be registered with a pension_fund and be given a document attesting to the fact that you registered . 9 ) REGISTER WITH TAX AUTHORITIES To avoid tax_evasion , Russia requires that all businesses register with the Tax Inspectorate . Also , some banks will not let you open an account without proof of tax registration . If steps 3-9 are not completed in 30 days , the temporary registration expires and the company will have to go_through the process again . 10 ) GET PERMANENT REGISTRATION All accumulated stamps and documents must be taken_back to the local Registration Chamber , where they are examined . If everything is in_order , the company is issued a permanent registration certificate . Congratulations . You can now sell bicycles .
