   <HEADLINE> FOR SOME FIRMS , TEMBLOR MEANS A JOLT TO PROFITS ; DISASTER : DAMAGE VARIES FROM STRUCTURAL TO LOSSES IN SALES . MORTGAGE LENDERS AND INSURERS WILL BE GRAPPLING WITH IMPACT INTO THE FUTURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just as the physical force of the Northridge earthquake hopscotched around the Valley , picking and choosing the victims of its worst punishment , some local companies are taking_a_hit to their bottom_lines because of lost business . The problems cited include damage to facilities and merchandise , and lost sales in the days after the quake . Some insurance_companies face big payouts for claims . Financial institutions could suffer if homeowners walk away from their mortgages . Datametrics Corp. , a Chatsworth maker of computer printers and communications products , was one of the first to announce that because of earthquake-related setbacks it will post a loss for its fiscal first_quarter ended Jan . 31 . A year earlier , Datametrics earned $ 300 # 000 on revenue of $ 5.3 million . The company was shut_down for four days after the quake because it had no electricity . Later , shipments of materials used in Datametrics products didn ' t arrive . The delays were particularly damaging because they came at the end of the quarter and because the recession has forced companies like Datametrics to time shipments very tightly . &quot; It ' s like the nail in the horse ' s shoe that makes you lose the war , &quot; said Datametrics Chief_Executive Sidney E . Wing . &quot; You can ' t ship because of a 50-cent component. &quot; The company also suffered , Wing said , because workers needed time_off to deal with personal problems . And every time an aftershock rattled , &quot; they wanted to get_out of the building , &quot; even though city building inspectors deemed the structure safe . Beverly Hills Fan Co . in Woodland Hills estimated that as much as $ 200 # 000 of its $ 2-million inventory of ceiling fans was destroyed when it fell_off shelves and was soaked by water . None of those products were earthquake-insured . &quot; There will be an impact on quarterly earnings , &quot; Controller Neil MacDonald said . Fortunately for Beverly Hills Fan , before the earthquake it had already rung_up $ 1.6 million in sales , double the total sales for the first_quarter a year earlier . The company said that if it posts a profit this quarter it will be a small one . Art publisher and retailer Martin Lawrence Limited Editions Inc. in Van Nuys also said its first-quarter sales would probably be &quot; significantly &quot; lower because of the earthquake as well as the severe cold in the Midwest and East Coast . The firm hopes to recover at least some quake-related losses from its insurer . Martin Lawrence said that quake damage has kept its galleries closed_in the Northridge Fashion Center and Sherman Oaks Fashion Square shopping_malls . Also , the company ' s headquarters was shut_down for two weeks after the temblor . In the quarter ended March 31 last year , Martin Lawrence lost $ 1.7 million on $ 4.7 million in revenue . Computer software distributor Kenfil Inc. in Van Nuys said that $ 3 million to $ 4 million of uninsured inventory was destroyed in the quake , and its operations were halted for about two weeks afterward . That will hurt profits , said Chief Financial Officer Peter Grubstein , although he would n ' t say by how much . Among those companies likely to feel an earnings bite from the earthquake are property-casualty insurers . 20th Century Industries , the Woodland Hills parent of 20th Century Insurance Co . and 21st Century Casualty Co. , estimated its quake claims at $ 160 million . After taxes and reinsurance , that total will drop to $ 62.9 million . &quot; The vast majority of that will be in the first_quarter , &quot; said Richard Dinon , senior_vice_president at 20th Century , the state ' s sixth-largest carrier of earthquake insurance . In the first_quarter of 1993 , the company earned $ 23.9 million on $ 263.1 million in revenue . However , at Amwest Insurance Group Inc. , the earthquake &quot; is going_to be immaterial &quot; to earnings , said Steven R . Kay , chief financial_officer . that ' s because the Woodland Hills company specializes in writing surety_bonds guaranteeing construction and other projects . In fact , said Kay , Amwest might benefit if the earthquake spurs rebuilding . &quot; that ' s what you need surety_bonds for . It could be an opportunity for us. &quot; Banks and savings and loans also stand to feel some pain from the earthquake . American Pacific State_Bank in Sherman Oaks , one of the nation ' s largest Small Business Administration lenders , cited the Northridge earthquake as one reason it added_to its loan-loss reserves for 1993 . As a result , its earnings declined 54 % in its fourth quarter ended Dec . 31 , to $ 197 # 899 from $ 430 # 556 a year earlier . Great Western Financial Corp . said it did not expect a &quot; material loss &quot; from the quake . Two buildings at its large Chatsworth complex were badly damaged , but rebuilding costs should be covered by the savings and loan company ' s insurance , said spokesman Steve L . Hawkins . &quot; So there won ' t be a huge financial hit in the first_quarter because of that. &quot; A bigger problem would be if large_numbers of homeowners who can ' t afford to rebuild their quake-damaged houses abandon their mortgages , Hawkins said . The company is hopeful that scenario won ' t come_to pass because most borrowers who are taking_advantage of Great Western ' s offer to place a 90-day moratorium on mortgage payments do not have severe structural damage on their properties -- and many have earthquake insurance . Glendale Federal Bank estimated that it has $ 1.5 billion in real_estate loans in earthquake-affected areas . But Judy Cunningham , a spokeswoman for the Glendale-based thrift , said the extent of any losses would n ' t be known for &quot; another week or two. &quot; She said that Glendale Federal was calling all its borrowers and depositors and inspecting properties . &quot; There are still so many variables. &quot; Other companies also said it was too soon to tell what impact , if any , the earthquake would have_on profits . Steven M . Besbeck , president of Creative Computer Applications Inc. , a provider of information_systems for laboratories and pharmacies , said his company didn ' t resume full operations until a_few weeks after the quake . Its Calabasas offices were drenched when sprinklers went_off during the shaking . Besbeck has hired specialists to determine if the company ' s electronic_equipment is salvageable . &quot; It may have an effect on the quarter that ends Feb . 28 , &quot; he said , &quot; but I ' m not even sure about that yet. &quot; Newhall Land &amp; Farming Co. , a Valencia real_estate developer , said its Valencia Town Center shopping_mall and its office and apartment_buildings were operating within a_few days after the quake . But Newhall Land spokeswoman Marlee Laufer said the company can ' t yet gauge the effect of closures of earthquake-damaged freeways leading into the area . &quot; There may be an impact on the first_quarter , &quot; she said . &quot; The long-term impact is difficult to assess because of transportation issues. &quot; Harman International Industries Inc. , a maker of audio speaker_systems , suffered no major damage at its Northridge manufacturing_plant despite its proximity to the quake ' s epicenter . Chief_Executive Sidney Harman also credited the plant ' s 2 # 000 employees for returning the facility to full operations by the Sunday after the quake . There was some lost inventory and building repairs needed , Harman said , but that should be covered by insurance . &quot; There ' s no impact on earnings. &quot;</TEXT>
