   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : RESIDENTS ' COMMENTS URGED_ON FARM ISSUES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Officials of the U . S . Department_of_Agriculture are urging Ventura County residents to submit written comments on agricultural issues that will be addressed when Congress begins debate on the 1995 farm_bill early next year . Particularly vital to county growers are the federal conservation programs that prevent erosion and low-interest loans to beekeepers that ultimately benefit citrus growers , said Frank Van Brocklin , county executive_director for the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service . The period for comments ends Oct . 1 . The current 1990 farm_bill , which is soon to expire , allows_for federal subsidies to farmers for erosion-prevention measures , such_as pipelines in irrigation_ditches , that help keep drinking_water supplies free_of soil sediments and chemicals , Van Brocklin said . For beekeepers , the bill provides low-interest loans that enable them to hold onto their honey until they can receive higher prices , he said . Beekeepers ' welfare is important to Ventura County citrus growers because bees help pollinate their crops , Van Brocklin said . &quot; It ' s doubly important for California growers ( to give input ) because the legislation usually reflects a Midwest slant , &quot; Van Brocklin said , referring to the political clout of the farm states in the nation ' s breadbasket . He urged the public to submit written comments to the Ventura County ASCS Committee at 254 E . Highway 246 , Suite D , Buellton , CA 93427 . Among other things , respondents could address whether they think that current programs should continue , be revised or be curtailed , particularly in light of the possibility of budget_cuts , Van Brocklin said .
