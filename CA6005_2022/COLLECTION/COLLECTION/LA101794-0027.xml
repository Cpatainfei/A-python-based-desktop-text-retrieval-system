   <HEADLINE> OFF BEAT THERAPIES GO TO WASHINGTON ; FLAP DEVELOPS OVER EFFORT TO VALIDATE ALTERNATIVE TECHNIQUES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Established medicine has long been slow to recognize the potential value of unconventional therapies . When acupuncturists from Asia first introduced that technique in this country , they were shunned and reviled by most doctors . Today acupuncture is widely accepted as a means of treating pain and other symptoms . But the current uproar in Washington over how to validate so-called alternative medical therapies gives us concern . Leaders of the National Institutes of Health are under intense pressure from Congress to study bee pollen , shark cartilage , special diets and other unproved remedies for a variety of diseases and conditions . With an angry blast at what he called improper pressure from Congress to bypass the rigors of science to validate alternative remedies , Dr. Joseph Jacobs resigned Sept . 30 as director of the NIH ' s Office of Alternative_Medicine . That office was formed two years ago largely at the behest of a powerful Democrat , Sen . Tom Harkin of Iowa , who claims to have cured his allergies by taking capsules of bee pollen recommended by a friend who is a businessman . PRAYER AND DIETS : The potential value of alternative remedies has been underscored by the scourge of AIDS and certain cancers , which have shown the limitations of conventional medicine . Even if the afflicted find only better quality_of_life rather than a cure , it is worth studying whether meditation , yoga , massage , hypnosis , imagery , macrobiotic_diets and prayer can be useful adjuncts to traditional treatments . There are some good studies suggesting that such techniques , although offering no cures , can extend life . However , there are dangers . Alternative_medicine has provided fertile ground for all manner of snake-oil salesmen and other scam artists who prey on the desperate and gullible . At best , the patients lose their money ; at worst their lives . There is a crying need for an agency like the NIH to separate the wheat from the chaff . Harkin , chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that controls the NIH budget , asserts that Americans spend $ 13 billion a year on various unconventional therapies and that the federal_government has done little to try to determine which are valid . He complains that the NIH office under Jacobs was poorly managed and the agency was slow to change . The issue seems to boil_down to how to validate the alternative therapies . Jacobs wanted to create several university-based centers where the therapies could be tested by people who have no emotional or financial stakes in the outcome . Harkin ' s backers preferred &quot; site investigations &quot; whereby the NIH would help alternative practitioners devise proper clinical trials of their techniques so they could qualify for approval by the Food and Drug Administration . BEES AND SHARKS : The NIH ' s alternative_medicine office plans to support site investigations of a number of alternative therapies , including the use of bee pollen to treat asthma , a urine extract called antineoplastons to combat brain_tumors and shark cartilage to treat cancer . Harkin says he favors a combination of the center and site approaches and disputes suggestions that he is hostile to scientific_method , which relies_on controlled replicable experiments . But the problem is that many of the practitioners of alternative_medicine are skeptical of scientific_method and are not good candidates to enlist to study and evaluate their own work . Even though the Office of Alternative_Medicine accounts_for only a tiny fraction of the NIH budget , the issue has presented the NIH director , Harold Varmus , with a particularly sticky issue as the search goes_on for a new alternative_medicine director . The NIH should realize it has given inadequate attention to offbeat and perhaps even weird regimens . But both the agency and Harkin will be embarrassed if it lets_down the guard against medical charlatans .</TEXT>
