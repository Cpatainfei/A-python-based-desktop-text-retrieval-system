   <TEXT> * As authors of a study cited in the article published in the recent Philip Morris ad , &quot; Were You Misled ? &quot; we wish to correct misleading statements about our work in the ad . Philip Morris ' stated intent was to publicize the &quot; flaws in the EPA ' s use of science &quot; in the EPA report &quot; Respiratory Health Effects of Passive Smoking : Lung_Cancer and Other Disorders. &quot; Evidence presented to support Philip Morris ' contention relied heavily on one finding of our study of exposures to environmental tobacco smoke ( ETS ) which , in fact , was never used as evidence in the EPA report . In fact , the only finding from our study cited by EPA was that &quot; 42 % of children 5 years of_age and under are estimated to live_in households with current smokers. &quot; Our study did not address respiratory conditions and , therefore , was not used as evidence of respiratory damage from ETS . However , the EPA report was meticulous in presenting descriptions from other studies that demonstrated scientific evidence of the respiratory effects of ETS . Philip Morris states , &quot; We believe that both smokers and nonsmokers should consider these facts and draw their own conclusions about the issue of secondhand smoke. &quot; If other studies cited in the EPA report were as &quot; misrepresented &quot; as was our study , then the &quot; facts &quot; presented in the Philip Morris ad are highly suspect .
