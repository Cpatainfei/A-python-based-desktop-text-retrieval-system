   <HEADLINE> A RETURN TO NORMANDY , ' WHERE IT ALL BEGAN ' ; MOVIES : A SEGMENT OF THE WEEK-LONG FESTIVAL OF AMERICAN CINEMA FOCUSES ON ' FILMS FOR THE FIGHT , ' A REMEMBRANCE OF HOW HOLLYWOOD DEPICTED WORLD_WAR_II .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nazi bombs were exploding in the stage-set streets of Paris when Ingrid Bergman leaned close to Humphrey Bogart . &quot; Is that cannon_fire , &quot; she asked , &quot; or is my heart pounding ? &quot; Ah , yes , World_War_II was a memorable , even glorious time , for a very patriotic Hollywood . And this week in Normandy , just down the coast from the beaches where thousands of Americans died to liberate Europe 50 years ago , Hollywood dug_into its film vaults to pay tribute to its own role in the war . At a Sunday night celebration , as the 20th annual Festival of American Cinema opened this week in Deauville , the Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences honored &quot; Films for the Fight &quot; in a nostalgic soiree that included that scene from 1942 ' s &quot; Casablanca &quot; and dozens of clips from &quot; The Longest Day , &quot; &quot; Twelve O ' Clock High , &quot; &quot; Mrs . Miniver , &quot; &quot; A Guy Named Joe , &quot; and other movies of -- and about -- that era . This week , as the_French media is introduced to &quot; Forrest Gump , &quot; &quot; Wolf , &quot; and other films that open soon in France , festival screens also are showing such war-time movies as &quot; Follow the Boys , &quot; a 1944 feature with Marlene Dietrich ; &quot; 13 Rue Madeleine , &quot; 1946 , with James Cagney ; and the 1945 Office of War Information film , &quot; True Glory. &quot; &quot; Normandy is where it all began , &quot; explained Jack Valenti , 72 , head of the Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences . Like some still in show_business today , Valenti was a soldier in World_War_II , commanding a B-25 bomber and flying 51 combat_missions . &quot; Of course , the movie_industry was vastly different then , &quot; Valenti said . &quot; Louis B . Mayer and Jack Warner were ferocious patriots . They really believed their movies were contributing to victory . &quot; Some of those movies were wonderful , &quot; he added . &quot; But movies don ' t only celebrate the past . They reflect the mood and ambience of the time . And that was a war in which there were no doubts . Honor . Duty . Service . Victory . I guess we were living_in an age of innocence then. &quot; World_War_II certainly provided plenty of heroes and villains for Hollywood . And it also gave actors , directors and screenwriters the kind of stories with passion and tragedy that can only come from true-life drama . Some of Hollywood ' s stars enlisted as soldiers , of course . But the film_industry also sponsored &quot; canteens , &quot; where soldiers could meet their favorite stars , and entertainers toured the world in USO shows for the troops . But it was the stories of valor and sacrifice on the big screen that helped inspire a generation of Americans , and , perhaps more importantly , captured the memories of that war for later generations . Among Hollywood ' s biggest boosters was Gen . Dwight D . Eisenhower , who encouraged film_makers to use their craft to build morale among American troops stationed abroad . &quot; The stories and the sets . . . bring_home their home country vividly to their memories , &quot; Eisenhower said in 1942 . &quot; Let ' s have more motion pictures. &quot; Col . W . Mason Wright Jr. , chief of the Army ' s Pictoral Branch in 1942 , put it this way : &quot; In times of peace , motion_pictures are a luxury , but in times of war they are a necessity. &quot; And there was no better time or place to recall those contributions than here in Normandy at the end of a summer of anniversaries that began with worldwide telecasts of ceremonies on the beaches nearby and ended with parties in the streets of Paris last month . For festival-goers in France , living so close to the events that Hollywood brought_to the screen , the retrospective of &quot; Films for the Fight &quot; was an often-poignant reminder of why the Allied soldiers are still hailed in Normandy as &quot; the liberators. &quot; &quot; When memory fails , art becomes memory , &quot; said Ruda Dauphin , an American official with the Deauville festival . &quot; Artists give meaning to suffering and complete history. &quot; But the retrospective also suggested just how important France was to Hollywood , which used its back lots to re-create the Occupation in Paris , in Normandy and in the small villages that dot this country ' s splendid countryside . &quot; Hollywood was kept good and busy during 1940 to 1945 , &quot; said Robert Osborne , host of the Movie Channel cable_television network and emcee for the academy tribute . &quot; And no country got as much attention from Hollywood as France. &quot; About 1 # 000 people turned_out for the tribute at the beachside convention center in Deauville . Among the guests were the children and grandchildren of Gens . Eisenhower and Omar Bradley ; Pamela Harriman , U.S. ambassador to France and former daughter-in-law of Sir Winston Churchill , the war-time British prime_minister Hollywood was also well-represented , from director Arthur Hiller , whose 20 feature_films include &quot; The Americanization of Emily , &quot; to Roddy McDowall , whose credits include &quot; The White Cliffs of Dover &quot; and &quot; The Longest Day. &quot; Also on_hand was Jean-Pierre Aumont , who starred in &quot; The Cross_of_Lorraine &quot; and who earned France ' s highest military decoration in the Free French Army . Maxine Andrews , who appeared with the Andrews Sisters in &quot; Hollywood Canteen &quot; in 1944 and toured with the USO , showed she has retained her vigor as she belted_out &quot; Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy of Company B. &quot; Recalling the Andrews Sisters ' first USO mission , she said she had been surprised by the tender age of the soldiers . &quot; I did a lot of growing_up back then , &quot; she said . &quot; I realized that what we were doing back in Hollywood was playing . What these boys were doing was real . It made me think_of the folly of war. &quot; Van Johnson , 78 , climbed onto the stage as the audience applauded his romantic scenes with Elizabeth Taylor beneath the Arc de Triomphe in the 1954 film , &quot; The Last Time I Saw Paris. &quot; A stage and screen veteran , Johnson first gained fame in wartime classics such_as &quot; Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo , &quot; &quot; Battleground &quot; and &quot; Two Girls and a Sailor. &quot; Johnson joked that his part in the war had included &quot; flying 200 missions over June Allyson ' s dressing room . It wasn ' t easy in those days , &quot; he said . &quot; I had to get_up at 5:30 in the morning , go_to the studio and kiss Elizabeth Taylor all day . It was tough. &quot;</TEXT>
