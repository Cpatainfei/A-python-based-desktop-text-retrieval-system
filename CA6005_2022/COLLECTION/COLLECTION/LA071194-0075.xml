   <HEADLINE> BIOLOGISTS WORKING_ON PLAN TO PROTECT PARK ' S RARE SPECIES ; CONSERVATION : THE AGREEMENT WILL LIKELY REMOVE SOME LIVESTOCK AND WEED OUT NON-NATIVE PLANTS ON THE CHANNEL ISLANDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an effort to keep more_than 30 rare species of plants and animals from vanishing in Channel Islands National_Park , federal biologists are developing a new strategy to protect the native flora and fauna before it ' s too late . Scientists from the U . S . Fish and Wildlife Service and Channel Islands National_Park are crafting a conservation agreement designed to prevent further decline of the native species on four of the park ' s northernmost islands . As the plan is being developed , officials are considering removing or restricting some livestock and game animals that had been placed on the islands , and eventually weeding_out non-native plants . Biologists may also nurture native species with some plantings . A similar plan is being developed for the four southern Channel Islands by Fish and Wildlife ' s office in Carlsbad . Much of the disturbance on the islands has been caused by grazing and browsing of game animals imported for hunters or livestock , including cattle , elk , deer , pigs and sheep , said Connie Rutherford , a botanist heading_up the agreement development for Fish and Wildlife . While most of the large grazing animals have already been removed from Anacapa and San Miguel islands , the other two islands covered by the conservation agreement , Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa , still host the large grazers . The animals denude rare shrubs and disrupt top soil with their hoofs , allowing the more aggressive invasive plants and weeds to crowd_out native grasses and plants , she said . That reduces the vegetation available to native animals as well . &quot; In a_couple_of decades , you can undo what nature took thousands of years to create , &quot; Rutherford said . &quot; Putting the pieces back together is not so easy. &quot; The new conservation plan will try to take a broader look_at protecting species than the government has taken_in the past . &quot; This is a much more comprehensive approach , &quot; Rutherford said of the conservation agreement . &quot; We ' re looking_at the whole habitat or the whole ecosystem rather than just isolated portions of it. &quot; The developing agreement reflects the U . S . Department of Interior ' s new direction for implementing the 20-year-old Endangered Species Act , which comes_up for congressional reauthorization this year . Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt has instructed the Fish and Wildlife Service to avoid &quot; train wrecks &quot; and &quot; crisis management &quot; in part through conservation agreements among agencies overseeing public lands . Those agreements should help protect habitat and preclude the need for placing species on the endangered list , the department said . When completed next year , the Channel Islands National_Park conservation agreement should prevent species from becoming extinct . &quot; All plants and animals have a value in nature , and we don ' t want to take the risk of causing the extinction of a species before we know what the value is , &quot; Rutherford said . Among the measures considered for the agreement include sparking controlled fires or selective use of herbicides to rid the islands of some weeds introduced by Europeans in the last century . Officials are also thinking_about re-vegetation programs to bring_back the native plants , using fences to keep non-native animals out of certain areas or restricting grazing to certain times of the year critical to plant growth . But eliminating non-native grazing animals is by far the most important measure to preserve native species , Rutherford said . &quot; Those animals are the main concern , &quot; she said . The conservation agreement could call_for gradually scaling back the ranching operation on Santa Rosa Island , where Vail &amp; Vickers Co . runs about 4 # 500 head of cattle , said C . Mack Shaver , superintendent of Channel Islands National_Park . The company also has a herd of 100 elk and 100 deer , which may be hunted for a fee . But Shaver disputed that the grazing animals are an immediate threat to native species of plants and animals . &quot; Before we change radically the grazing on Santa Rosa , we need to understand those problems to be sure we don ' t end_up with a worse problem than we started with , &quot; he said . Shaver referred to an unexpected problem that arose on Santa Cruz Island when the Nature Conservancy , which owns 90 % of the island , pulled all_the cattle and sheep off the island as soon as it took possession . Instead of native grasses beginning to flourish , weedy , bamboo-like fennel grew in abundance , choking out native plants , Shaver said . Feral pigs still roam much of the rest of the island . The National_Park_Service is negotiating to buy the final 25 % of the 10 % of the island that is still privately owned . If the Park Service is successful , it will remove the sheep kept there by the Gherini family . Shaver said that when money allows , the Park Service will also remove the feral pigs from all_of Santa Cruz Island . On Santa Rosa Island , the problems with non-native animals will take longer to resolve , Shaver said . Three years ago , the Park Service hired professional hunters to kill the feral pigs on the island . But under the agreement to purchase the island from Vail &amp; Vickers in 1987 , the cattle ranching and deer and elk hunting operations will be allowed to continue until 2012 , as long as they don ' t interfere with park management . Shaver said he sees no such interference , but that the conservation agreement will outline measures to prevent any further decline of native species until the agreement expires . &quot; The land is in transition from ranch to park and eventually we will have all_the non-native animals off the land , &quot; he said . &quot; In the meantime , we need to learn as much as we can about the ecosystems so we don ' t end_up with a catastrophe when we pull the animals off. &quot; But other interested parties , such_as the California Native Plant Society , say the operations need to be curtailed now . The society ' s staff botanist , Mark Skinner , said he realizes that the Park Service would not have been able to acquire Santa Rosa at all without the agreement to operate the cattle_ranch , but he said the native species could be irreparably damaged if the Park Service waits until 2012 to act . Skinner said that the Native Plant Society brought_up the urgency of the_matter in a lawsuit and that the Fish and Wildlife Service is in the process of proposing that 18 plants on the Channel Islands be added_to the endangered species list . &quot; Impacts from introduced herbivores are overwhelmingly the No . 1 threat to these plants , &quot; he said . &quot; The vegetation and rare plants are in really bad shape now , and some of them will undergo additional decline in the next couple of decades , and it ' s possible some may disappear. &quot; The same may be true for another 20 species of plants and animals that are candidates for the endangered species list , biologists said . Skinner said the National_Park_Service tries to abide_by its mandate to be a good steward of the land , but that it also wants to honor its agreement with ranchers . &quot; But those two objectives are mutually_exclusive , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s the ranching operations on Santa Rosa that are having such an adverse impact . The Park Service is not taking sufficient initiative to change the practices to protect rare and endangered plants. &quot; It was the California Native Plant Society that sued the Fish and Wildlife Service in 1991 for failing to propose for listing 159 species statewide that were identified as candidates . As part of the suit settlement , the Fish and Wildlife Service agreed to propose the plants for the endangered species list by September , 1996 . Skinner said the society hopes to avoid any future legal_action against the federal_government to force it to take_care of the Channel Islands . But the islands are far to valuable to ignore , he said . &quot; The Channel Islands are a very special place , &quot; he said . &quot; The Channel Islands have a number of endemic species found no place else in California or in the world . From a biological standpoint , they ' re priceless. &quot;</TEXT>
