   <HEADLINE> JOHAN J . HOLST ; LED PLO-ISRAEL PEACE TALKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Johan Jorgen Holst , the Norwegian foreign_minister who led secret talks that forged the Israel-PLO peace accord and who pledged to pursue peace &quot; as long as there is life in me , &quot; died Thursday after a stroke . Holst , 56 , was discovered dead in his hospital_bed after suffering his second stroke in two months . He had been foreign_minister for less than 10 months . Israeli and PLO leaders mourned Holst ' s death and praised his contribution to their historic agreement for limited Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho area of the West_Bank . The accord was signed Sept . 13 , but the Israeli withdrawal has been delayed by disputes over control of borders and security of Jewish settlers . &quot; The moment he entered the peace process , it was in the center of his life until his last breath , &quot; Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said of Holst ' s role in bringing the sides together . &quot; The entire nation of Israel bows its head to the memory of this man. &quot; PLO leader Yasser Arafat called Holst &quot; a great peacemaker who engraved the name of Norway in the book of world peace. &quot; He promised to name a street and square in Jericho after Holst , the PLO news_agency Wafa said . Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin also praised Holst , saying he laid the foundations for Middle_East peace . &quot; His contribution and role in the efforts for peace will be a beacon for us in the continuation of the effort to bring an end to war and bloodshed , &quot; Rabin said in a condolence message . U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , in Moscow for the U.S.-Russia summit , issued a statement expressing &quot; deepest sorrow &quot; at Holst ' s death . &quot; Mr. Holst ' s contributions to world peace were historic , &quot; Christopher said . &quot; His personal commitment to reconciliation and peace in the Middle_East will stand as a work of hope and life for the people of the region. &quot; Holst was first hospitalized in November for exhaustion , after hectic months of travel and work during the negotiations , which were held_in Norway . He was hospitalized again after suffering a stroke in December that affected his ability to walk and speak . Norwegians were surprised when Holst , a former defense minister , was named foreign_minister in April . He was not known for his political savvy , and many doubted that his talents would measure_up to those of Thorvald Stoltenberg , his predecessor who resigned to become a U.N. negotiator for the former Yugoslavia . The son of a shipwreck investigator , Holst studied Russian in military college and was a research fellow at Harvard_University in 1961 . He studied political_science at Columbia University in New York and the University of Oslo , graduating in 1965 . He was a visiting professor at Carleton University in Ottawa in 1970 . In addition to his wife and their son , Holst is survived by four children from his first marriage .</TEXT>
