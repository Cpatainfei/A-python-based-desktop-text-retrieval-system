   <TEXT> Property_owners in the garment and flower districts say a pilot_program that hires the homeless to clean and help patrol the streets has been a success in sprucing_up the area and reducing crime . Organizers hope the program ' s success will persuade more property_owners to contribute money to keep the program afloat . The newly formed Downtown Property_Owners Assn . initiated the Clean and Safe program in August in the hope that by cleaning_up the area and providing a more visible presence , it could improve the area ' s image , promote safer streets , revive the neighborhood and prevent flight of businesses . The program has employed 43 former or currently homeless people to pick_up litter , paint over graffiti and steam-clean sidewalks in a 10-block area bounded by 7th , 12th , San Julian and Main_streets . Clean and Safe organizers also hired their own bicycle patrol team by contracting security_guards through Wells Fargo Guard Service to cycle daily through the streets and help the Los Angeles Police_Department officers by reporting crimes . The 10 uniformed security_guards are equipped with radios to communicate directly with police . Police Sgt . Robert Villarino credited Clean and Safe and other similar improvement programs initiated by local organizations for a marked drop_in Downtown crime . Overall crime decreased 21 % from Jan . 1 to Feb . 7 compared with the same period last year , Villarino said . The number of robberies dropped_by 18 % last month , compared with last year , while auto thefts dropped 49 % , he said . One area with room for improvement is funding , said Marianne Giblin , associate director of the Downtown Property_Owners Assn. , which formed last May . Of the organization ' s 250 Eastside members , only about 65 % donated money to the Clean and Safe program , Giblin said . Their $ 105 # 000 in contributions funded the program for six months . The city Community Redevelopment Agency contributed $ 25 # 000 , and City_Council members Rita Walters and Richard Alatorre found funds to provide $ 25 # 000 each . But that $ 75 # 000 in city donations has been used , Giblin said . The association hopes to form an assessment district in which each property_owner would pay a mandatory assessment toward public-improvement projects . The association and Chrysalis homeless assistance agency , which hired the workers , are seeking local and federal grants , Giblin said . IRIS YOKOI</TEXT>
