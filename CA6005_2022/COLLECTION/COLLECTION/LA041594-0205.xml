   <HEADLINE> LATIN_AMERICA ; U.S. MILITARY IN EL_SALVADOR AT CENTER OF ANOTHER SCANDAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The civil_war is over , and the presence of U.S. Army advisers is being substantially reduced . Yet suddenly , for the second time in three months , the U.S. military here finds itself at the center of scandal . First , an American defense attache leaving a party shot and killed his Salvadoran bodyguard ; the army major was whisked out of the country but may be court-martialed . Next , an American lieutenant_colonel tried to prove to Salvadoran police that a grenade he was holding was a dud . He pulled the pin , and the explosion killed him and wounded four Salvadoran policemen and bodyguards . During the long war that the U.S._government helped fight against El_Salvador ' s Marxist guerrillas , such incidents probably would have been kept quiet . But now , in a sign of how times change , the cases are being widely publicized and criticized -- by the left , to be sure , but even more vociferously by the right and the institutions of a government long bolstered by the U.S. Suggesting that alcohol or drugs were involved in the cases , the head of the Salvadoran police -- a force built largely with U.S. money -- went so far as_to demand that all U.S. Embassy personnel submit to drug tests . &quot; Many of these people were once in Vietnam , &quot; said Jose Maria Monterrey , chief of the National Civilian Police , &quot; so I think it would be appropriate for them to take dope-detection tests. &quot; Monterrey based his comments on a report from chief coroner Juan Mateu Llort , who claimed that U.S. Army Lt . Col . Julio Rivera was under the influence of three drugs when he detonated the grenade . This week , however , the U.S. Embassy said drug tests were negative . When questioned , an agitated Monterrey responded , &quot; The courts , not the embassy , are the authority here. &quot; Since El_Salvador ' s civil_war formally ended in 1992 , members of El_Salvador ' s right-wing government have become increasingly angry at the Clinton_Administration , which has released incriminating documents about the right ' s war-time involvement in death squads . Police say Maj . Ismael Lopez , an assistant army attache assigned to the U.S. Embassy , killed his bodyguard , Jose Crescencio Diaz , on Jan . 21 after becoming drunk at a party . Diaz had taken_away Lopez ' s gun , but then returned it and was shot . What most rankled Salvadorans was that Lopez , who enjoyed diplomatic immunity , was immediately put_under the protection of the U.S. Embassy and sent_out of the country in a U.S. military aircraft . * Police_Chief Monterrey accused embassy personnel of interfering with the investigation . Supreme Court President Mauricio Gutierrez Castro , who himself has been accused of botching cases in the past and is under international pressure to resign , suggested that laws were broken_in spiriting Lopez away . The Salvadoran Foreign Ministry demanded an explanation of the procedure used in arranging his departure . Embassy officials deny tampering with the investigation but have agreed to more formal clearance of military air traffic in the future , according to sources . They also sought to assure the Salvadorans that Lopez would be submitted to U.S. military justice . A hearing is scheduled next Wednesday to decide whether Lopez will be court-martialed on a charge of unpremeditated murder , according to a spokesman at U.S. Southern Command headquarters in Panama . Just as the Lopez case was fading from public awareness , Rivera was killed April 3 . Three Salvadoran guards were stopped by police for speeding and jailed when police found a hand_grenade and other weapons on them . Rivera was summoned to the police_station to take them into custody , but he first tried to prove that the grenade was a dud . When it exploded , it killed him and wounded two policemen and two of the Salvadoran guards . The embassy , expressing &quot; dismay &quot; over the accident , flew the two police_officers who were most seriously wounded to Texas for treatment .</TEXT>
