   <HEADLINE> TRIP PICKS ; IN THE EVER-EXPANDING WORLD OF VIGOROUS VACATIONS , A SAMPLER OF SOME OF THIS YEAR ' S MOST PROMISING NEW EXCURSIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Adventure outfitters are no slouches when it comes_to innovation -- as their mushrooming numbers ( more_than 5 # 000 at my last count ) would seem to prove . And 1994 promises to be a full year . Slick new catalogues from dozens of companies have been weighing in weekly , with hundreds of domestic and international itineraries ranging from the merely vigorous to Iron Man endurance tests . Take an easy hike or climb a killer mountain , paddle along gentle ripples or crash through raging rapids . And when it comes_to bedding_down for the night , snuggle under the covers at a posh inn , or find a relatively soft piece_of_ground in a wilderness survival hut . A few things are missing this year in the adventure travel universe . Expeditions for active travelers mirror the changing world , and several once-popular destinations have become out-of-bounds because of internal strife and political upheaval . Say goodby for now to Rwanda , where the famous mountain_gorillas and their dwindling habitat are hostage to fierce civil_war , and research and visitor programs have been suspended . Ditto for Egypt , which has had the Nile and pyramids virtually to itself as attacks on Westerners by Muslim fundamentalists continue to keep the country off the tourist map . Peru , meanwhile , remains iffy , despite government progress in neutralizing political terrorism by guerrillas who have frightened away potential pilgrims to Machu Picchu and environs . But some locales long considered taboo are opening_up , and adventure companies are moving_in to provide options . Gorilla seekers can visit the big apes in Zaire . Ancient ruins in Belize and nearby Tikal , Guatemala , offer a rich setting for archeology buffs disinclined to venture into the Middle_East . Villages in northern Vietnam now welcome trekkers who might formerly have favored Peru . On tamer fronts , companies are offering new twists on familiar themes . Already cycled California ' s Napa-Sonoma wine country ? How about doing_it again on a bicycle built for two ? Spent a fortune attending Rio ' s elaborately choreographed Carnival ? Why not experience a more soulful version in Bahia , where the Brazilian pre-Lenten festival was born ? Had your fill of trendy European resorts , such_as Spain ' s over-developed Costa del Sol ? Head instead to the country ' s untrammeled north , where a hike amid the peaks and valleys of the stunning Picos de Europa mountains will be infinitely more refreshing than sunburn on a crowded southern beach . Want more ? Kayak around Australia ' s Great Barrier_Reef , or try a women-only ( if you are ) cross-country ski adventure in Yellowstone_National_Park or rock-climbing excursion in California ' s Joshua_Tree National_Monument . * I ' ve watched , fascinated , as adventure travel has grown from a handful of companies set_up for group trips 15 years ago , to the current thousands of outfitters . And I ' ve taken dozens of adventure trips . The following eight trips are new excursions from some of the most experienced outfitters in the field , all with reputations for delivering full value for your vacation dollar . Many of the itineraries are substitutes for locales no longer available . Except where indicated , prices_listed are per person , double occupancy and do not include air fare . Some meals and hotel nights also may cost extra , so check_in advance with the outfitter : Gorillas of Zaire and Uganda wildlife : Brad Goodhart , who has been leading natural_history trips to Africa for 20 years , will guide a maximum of 11 individuals on treks among the gorillas of Zaire ' s Virunga National_Park and Bukima wildlife sanctuary during a 20-day exploratory safari run_by Wilderness Travel of Berkeley . The group also will visit that country ' s Pygmy community in the Ituri rain_forest , and chimpanzee colonies in Tongo . In neighboring Uganda , peaceful after long years of civil strife under former president Idi Amin , the group will tour game parks and waterfalls , and take a launch trip among the hippos of the Kasinga Channel . Accommodations range from camping to basic hotel_rooms . Participants should be in good physical condition . Jungles , reefs and ruins in Belize and Guatemala : Butterfield &amp; Robinson , a Canadian company that specializes in upscale walking and cycling trips at an easy pace , has introduced a hiking , canoeing and snorkeling trip to Belize that includes an excursion over the border into Guatemala to explore the 2 # 000-year-old ruins of Tikal , the most celebrated Mayan archeological site . Participants spend two nights at the luxe jungle lodge , Chaa Creek Cottages , where they can canoe Chaa Creek , explore the rain_forest with a local medicine woman who uses jungle plants for their curative powers , and tour Belize ' s Mayan ruins at Xunantunich . After driving to Tikal and spending the night at the archeological site in the rustic Jungle Lodge , the group flies to Belize ' s northwest , spending two days at a private nature reserve known for its bird life . The last three days are spent at Blackbird Caye in the country ' s Turneffe Islands , for swimming , snorkeling and kayaking around Belize ' s 195-mile barrier_reef , the longest coral_reef in the Western_Hemisphere . Trekking in northern Vietnam : A maximum of 15 participants will explore the farming villages and mountain reserves west of Hanoi during two-week treks run_by InnerAsia Expeditions , a San Francisco company that emphasizes cultural interaction . Village-to-village hikes ( about four to six hours a day ) are along rice_paddies and up forested hills , with accommodations in traditional bamboo village long houses and tents . Luggage and other heavy gear is carried by porters . While the United States still does not have formal diplomatic relations with Vietnam , private individuals are free to visit , and tourism has been growing steadily since the country opened its doors to Western vacationers in the late 1980s . Tandem biking across the U.S. : Backroads , which runs bike tours throughout the United States and abroad , has created new five- and six-day tandem-only bike trips . Rent one from Backroads or bring your own . The trips are meant to appeal_to couples and others who think they might enjoy pedaling in pairs . Both inn stays and camping trips are available . Among destinations included in the tandem program are California ' s wine country , southeastern Vermont , the Oregon coast , Colorado ' s San Juan Mountains and coastal Maine . Hiking the mountains of northern Spain : Mountain Travel / Sobek , the country ' s largest adventure outfitter , has designed a trip to northern Spain that combines treks amid the jagged peaks and narrow canyons of the Picos de Europa mountains , 20 miles from the Atlantic Coast , with hikes through oak and pine forests , and visits to seaside fishing villages . The group also will explore some of the key religious and historical sights in this relatively untouristed region of Spain . Accommodations are in rustic mountain huts and simple country hotels . Carnival like a native in Bahia : Brazil_Nuts , a Connecticut company that is much respected for its music and cultural tours of Brazil , is embarking_on its second annual Carnival in Bahia program , which offers participants a chance to experience the annual pre-Lenten extravaganza in its Brazilian birthplace . Sprawling along the Atlantic coast of the state of Bahia , a two-hour flight from Rio , the city of Salvador was Brazil ' s original colonial capital . It was also the point_of_entry for 3.5 million slaves , mostly from Angola and West Africa , between the 16th and 19th centuries . They labored in the sugar plantations and mines of the emerging colony , and today their descendants still occupy the town of narrow cobbled streets , whitewashed houses with red tile_roofs and stunning seaside stretches . Carnival here is in the streets , where groups of celebrators , called blocos , dance and sing behind bands playing atop giant flatbed trucks . This people ' s party is a far_cry from the expensive , restrictive celebrations in Rio ' s Sambadrome and private clubs . Participants in Brazil_Nuts ' &quot; Carnival Like a Native &quot; tour get_to march with one of Salvador ' s blocos , and are given costumes for the occasion . While this trip is not designed as an escorted group tour , the company does provide a representative at each hotel to assist participants with arrangements and handle any problems . Diving and kayaking Australia ' s Great Barrier_Reef : REI , a Washington cooperative that is a major manufacturer and distributor of outdoor gear , several years ago began offering rugged adventure trips . The company ' s excursion to northeastern Australia ' s Great Barrier_Reef includes diving , snorkeling and kayaking around the world ' s largest barrier_reef , using a 65-foot motor / sailing ketch as a base . The group also will explore the inland Eungella rain_forest . Scuba novices can take an introductory dive course at an extra price . Women-only , skiing Yellowstone or rock climbing in California : Woodswomen , a Minnesota company created to help women gain self-confidence and practical wilderness skills , runs outdoor adventures year-round , mainly in the West and Midwest . Among upcoming trips are a cross-country ski excursion to Yellowstone_National_Park , which is overrun_with tourists come summer , but blissfully peaceful in winter , and a rock-climbing program amid the desert landscape of California ' s Joshua_Tree National_Monument . ( The trip is geared to novice and intermediate rock climbers. ) The emphasis in all Woodswomen trips is_on self-improvement and teamwork , with guides specifically trained to help women conquer fears about traveling alone and coping_with nature .
