   <HEADLINE> GETTING THEIR WORDS ' WORTH ; THEY ' RE 30 YEARS INTO IT AND SOUTH COAST REPERTORY ISN ' T BROADWAY , BUT IT IS REGARDED AS A ' PLAYWRIGHT HEAVEN '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Jason Robards had never been to South Coast Repertory . He also had only a vague idea of where it is and couldn ' t get its name quite right . But with great charm and sincerity the actor was touting the theater one day last year to a roomful of would-be actors gathered at Kennedy Center in Washington for the American College Theatre Festival . Though Robards kept calling it &quot; West Coast Repertory out there in Los Angeles , &quot; he got South Coast ' s reputation right . He knew that the theater is committed to staging new plays . He knew that many of them have been noticed in New York , because they get second productions there . And so his career advice was simple . &quot; Go west , &quot; he said , echoing Horace Greeley . &quot; Go_to West Coast Repertory. &quot; New York playwright Richard Greenberg , who had the way to South Coast pointed_out to him in 1986 by its longtime dramaturge , Jerry Patch , understands the confusion of names . &quot; It ' s hard to keep any of them straight , &quot; Greenberg said in a recent interview at the Costa Mesa theater , where his new play , &quot; Night and Her Stars , &quot; premieres Friday on the SCR Mainstage . &quot; My parents still call this place West Coast Repertory , and they ' ve actually been here . Before I became part of it , all I knew was it was very generous . I ' d heard it liked to take_on playwrights , give commissions and put_on first productions by a lot of interesting writers . that ' s all I knew . I never knew what was San Diego ( Repertory Theatre ) , what was La Jolla ( Playhouse ) , what was South Coast. &quot; Even Craig Lucas , probably the New York playwright most closely identified with South Coast , recalls never having heard of the now-29-year-old Orange County theater_company before being contacted by Patch for the first time in 1984 . &quot; I remember asking Christopher Durang about them , &quot; he said . &quot; Thank God , I did. &quot; Lucas ' plays quickly came_to dominate the SCR schedule with five productions in four consecutive seasons , 1985 to 1988 . There were revivals of &quot; Reckless &quot; and &quot; Blue Window , &quot; world_premieres of &quot; Three Postcards &quot; ( with music by Craig Carnelia ) and &quot; Prelude to a Kiss &quot; ( before it went_to Broadway and became a Hollywood movie ) and a reprise of &quot; Marry Me a Little &quot; ( a chamber musical created from trunk songs by Stephen Sondheim ) . &quot; I received a commission from South Coast when nobody was paying much attention to me , &quot; Lucas , 43 , recounted in a recent interview from his home_in Putnam County , just north of New York City . &quot; I was not a known writer at all when we talked_about a commission . &quot; The New York Times had completely lambasted my first play , ' Missing Persons. ' I couldn ' t even get_it published . Unfortunately , theater in New York lives and dies by their reviews . ' Reckless ' went unreviewed by them . And ' Blue Window ' received an absolutely scathing review . . . . So I was terribly grateful for the support I got_at South Coast. &quot; David Margulies says a commission for &quot; Sight Unseen &quot; turned his career around . When South Coast decided to back him , he was seriously thinking_of giving_up on theater . He ' d already written a dozen plays , many produced but not much noticed ( including one at the late , lamented Los Angeles Theatre Center and one at the Back Alley Theater ) . &quot; I owe it to South Coast that the script for ' Sight Unseen ' exists at all , &quot; Margulies , 39 , said from New Haven , Conn. , where he teaches at the Yale School of Drama . &quot; Their commission came when I was getting involved in screenwriting and wondering if I would continue with plays . It was quite a boon , a vote_of_confidence . It ended_up changing my life. &quot; Soon after its South Coast premiere in September , 1991 , &quot; Sight Unseen &quot; was remounted by the Manhattan Theatre Club in New York and transferred to a commercial house , where it ran_for seven months in 1992 as a smash hit of the Off Broadway season . The play , about the travails of a successful painter , was also nominated for the Pulitzer Prize . Moreover , this season &quot; Sight Unseen &quot; is second only to David Mamet ' s &quot; Oleanna &quot; as the most-produced new American play , with 16 professional stagings at theaters across the country , according to Dramatists Play Service , which licenses the rights for both plays . ( &quot; Oleanna &quot; has 21. ) * Veteran South Coast playgoers -- there are 19 # 730 subscribers for this season , the theater ' s 30th -- have gotten used to seeing productions polished to a high sheen . Technical excellence , underwritten this season by a $ 5.8-million budget , has long been one of the theater ' s hallmarks . The core acting company of five founding and two resident artists is top-notch and is regularly surrounded by guest performers of equal caliber . The resident and guest designers brought_in from all_over the country also rank among the best working anywhere . But when South Coast won a special Tony Award for regional theaters in 1988 , it was largely in recognition of its commitment to new plays . Of 296 productions since its first ramshackle touring show , staged from the back of a station_wagon in the fall of 1964 , no fewer than 53 productions have been world_premieres . The overwhelming majority of those premieres -- 45 -- have come during the last 15 seasons , basically since South Coast moved_into the sleek theater complex that houses its 507-seat Mainstage and 161-seat Second Stage . The numbers are more revealing when compared with those of Southern California ' s other three largest not-for-profit theaters -- all regional Tony winners , as well -- the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles ( with a $ 10.8-million budget ) , the Old Globe Theatre ( $ 8.4 million ) and the La Jolla Playhouse ( $ 4.6 million ) , both in San Diego . The Taper has produced 48 world_premieres since its founding in 1967 , including 29 during the last 15 seasons . The Old Globe has produced 31 world_premieres since its founding in 1935 , including 22 in the last 15 seasons . The La Jolla Playhouse has produced 15 since current operations began in 1983 . * For Greenberg , &quot; Night and Her Stars &quot; represents his second South Coast commission . The play dramatizes the TV quiz-show scandals of the late ' 50s and their chief real-life protagonists , contestants Charles Van Doren and Herb Stempel and producer Dan Enright . Written in prose but disguised on the page as blank_verse , it is a cautionary tale about the twin seductions of money and fame and the corruption of basic moral values by corporate greed and all-too-human venality . Greenberg ' s first commission , in 1987 , resulted in &quot; The Extra Man , &quot; a very different kind of work about a group of unhappy Manhattanites buffeted by urban Angst . It premiered at South Coast in 1991 . By then he had already gained national attention with his best-known play , &quot; Eastern Standard , &quot; a witty comic satire about the post-crash ' 80s that bowed at Seattle Repertory in 1988 and made a well-publicized journey to Broadway . &quot; This theater has been like my convalescence , &quot; said Greenberg , 35 , who wrote &quot; Night and Her Stars &quot; while recovering last year from Hodgkin ' s disease . &quot; I think_of my convalescence as being the way I always wanted to work . It was a utopian environment . I had no responsibilities , except to get chemo and write. &quot; &quot; For us , theater is about creativity , &quot; said producing artistic director David Emmes , 56 , who co-founded South Coast with artistic director Martin Benson , 55 . &quot; It ' s about transforming a play from a piece of dramatic literature into something alive on the stage , and there ' s nothing more fulfilling than doing_it with a new play . You ' re there at the inception . The form hasn ' t been created before . It ' s exciting to be part of it. &quot; To that end , alone among comparable resident theaters anywhere in the country , South Coast has built_up a $ 1.4-million endowment for exclusive use by its play-development program . Each year , income earned by the endowment helps underwrite the Collaboration Laboratory and its offshoots , the Hispanic Playwrights Project and the NewSCRipt readings for unproduced plays . A total of 45 commissions have been awarded to 36 writers largely since the mid- ' 80s , all financed by the endowment . Amounts vary , but the commissions generally range between $ 6 # 000 and $ 10 # 000 . &quot; They ' ve been very smart about how to support their commissioning process , &quot; Taper producing director Robert Egan said . &quot; We allocate money and try to commission four or five writers a year . But a more formalized program with a budget has existed for only the last five or six years. &quot; The Old Globe generally does not offer commissions . &quot; We have done some , but it ' s not a regular thing , &quot; spokeswoman Charlene Baldridge said . The theater supports emerging writers through a Play Discovery Program that invites scripts and provides public readings . The La Jolla Playhouse commissions plays &quot; when the money is available , &quot; spokesman Josh Ellis said . &quot; We have done_it in the past and we expect to continue doing_it in the future. &quot; * By all accounts , South Coast ' s commitment to new plays comes not just from Emmes and Benson ( the longest-running partnership among leaders of the nation ' s resident theaters ) , but from a behind-the-scenes team that may fairly be dubbed &quot; The Jerry and John Show. &quot; It stars dramaturge Jerry Patch and literary manager John Glore and is one show South Coast playgoers rarely get_to see except in playbill essays . They are the ones who scout the talent , recruit the writers , and deal with their scripts and their agents , sometimes going so far as_to get them agents when they don ' t have them . And the duo ' s performance earns them raves . &quot; Jerry and John are fabulous , &quot; said Helen Merrill , an independent New York agent who represents Christopher Durang . &quot; I ' m a fan of both of them . They really serve the artist , and they ' re exceedingly well-informed. &quot; Gil Parker , the William Morris agent who represents Beth Henley , concurs : &quot; They ' re two of the best literary managers in the country. &quot; Said Emmes : &quot; They deserve much of the credit for what happens at this theater. &quot; Patch , 51 , joined South Coast in 1967 . Tall and lanky , he has an outgoing manner , loves tennis and says he wishes &quot; people would just as soon forget I was born and raised in Burbank. &quot; For the last 14 years South Coast has staged his adaptation of the Charles Dickens classic &quot; A Christmas Carol. &quot; Glore , 38 , came_to South Coast in 1984 from Washington ' s Arena Stage , where he spent three years after graduating from the Yale School of Drama . Tall and taciturn , he too is a writer . In 1990 his 10-minute play &quot; What She Found There &quot; won the Heideman Award at the Actors Theatre of Louisville . And earlier this season South Coast produced the world_premiere of his first full-length play , &quot; The Company of Heaven. &quot; &quot; I take great pride that we do a lot of new plays , &quot; Patch said . &quot; It has become fashionable in the last 15 years , more so than it was in the late ' 70s , when David started sending me around the country to go find writers and tell them we wanted to be their theater . David and Martin make the ultimate decisions on what gets produced . But I have to tell you , at most theaters you don ' t get the kind of leeway John and I get here. &quot; Said Greenberg : &quot; What ' s great about Jerry is that there ' s never an edge of superiority in the way he deals with you . He doesn ' t infantilize you . that ' s just what they don ' t do here . They don ' t treat you like the idiot playwright who somehow accidentally managed to generate something that interests them . &quot; Sometimes in my early exposure to ' development ' at other theaters , I found that it was a euphemism for giving people with no specific talent something to do . Everybody had an opinion . I ' ve seen people whose plays have been ' developed ' to death . They ' d been given so_much authoritative and contradictory advice that they had their instincts trampled . I haven ' t seen that happen here. &quot; Chicago playwright Roger Rueff goes further . He calls South Coast &quot; playwright heaven. &quot; Rueff , 37 , never had a play produced before South Coast premiered his &quot; Hospitality Suite &quot; in 1992 . At the end of last season the theater promptly gave him another premiere for his second play , &quot; So Many Words. &quot; Then , in January , South Coast offered Rueff his first commission before it even learned that &quot; So Many Words &quot; had been named the 1993 winner of the Ted Schmitt Award by the Los Angeles Drama_Critics Circle . That accolade honors the best play to receive its world_premiere in Los Angeles and Orange counties . &quot; Actually , part of the reason I call South Coast playwright heaven has a lot to do with something Jerry Patch told me the very first time we met , &quot; Rueff said from his home_in Naperville , Ill. , a Chicago suburb . &quot; When I got_off the plane , he picked me up at the airport . I got_into his car , and the first thing he said to me was , ' I just want you to know that at South Coast Rep the playwright is king. ' &quot; That meant nobody was going_to try to force me to write anything I didn ' t want ( during rewrites ) . He said , ' We ' re going to be very , very frank with how we feel . But ultimately the decision is yours . Nobody is going_to piss and moan if it doesn ' t turn_out the way they want. ' That really relaxed me. &quot; * Some playwrights have objected to their treatment , though . Ellen McLaughlin did_it most conspicuously in 1988 when South Coast canceled a scheduled world_premiere of her play &quot; Infinity ' s House &quot; on the grounds that she hadn ' t done the rewrites they wanted . She cried foul in the press . But South Coast stuck_to its decision , although it meant returning a $ 64 # 000 grant from the Fund for New American Plays that was to help finance the production . South Coast also has been criticized for the fact that the theater has never produced the work of an African American playwright . Says Benson : &quot; I must confess we ' ve never had an agenda to go_out and find black writers . . . the way we have , say , with Hispanic writers. &quot; But that may change . &quot; It ' s something we ' re going to have to take_a_look at , &quot; he adds . Meanwhile , some agents sniff that South Coast is too parochial about its role as a not-for-profit theater . Despite its evident success , they would like it to follow the lead of the Taper , the Old Globe and La Jolla when it comes_to participating in the commercial arena . The artistic directors of those theaters often work in New York , directing plays they first staged at_home . This has earned them a following among commercial producers , who not only can give new plays an extended life on the stage but can attract lucrative offers from other media . The Taper ' s Gordon Davidson just directed an Off Broadway production of &quot; Unfinished Stories , &quot; which opened Feb . 16 . He initially directed it at the Taper in 1992 . The Old Globe ' s Jack O ' Brien is directing &quot; Damn Yankees &quot; on Broadway , with an opening date set for Thursday . He directed it last fall at the Old Globe . La Jolla ' s Des McAnuff won the 1993 Tony for directing &quot; The Who ' s Tommy &quot; on Broadway , after staging it at La Jolla the year before . Emmes and Benson have never directed at any professional theater except South Coast . And though they are pleased when a play first mounted in their theater gets a second production elsewhere , the play must make the journey on its own . They do not involve themselves or the theater ' s resources in becoming a launching_pad . &quot; Nobody really knows who those two gentlemen are , &quot; said one agent who spoke on condition of anonymity . &quot; They don ' t have a strong image in the business . Everybody knows who Gordon Davidson is . They know the Old Globe is Jack O ' Brien . They know who Des McAnuff is. &quot; Michael Peretzian , a William Morris agent in Los Angeles , concurred . &quot; South Coast is happy to stay in its little corner , &quot; said Peretzian , who sold the movie rights to Craig Lucas ' &quot; Prelude to a Kiss &quot; for $ 1 million . &quot; They put_on fine productions for their community . But , of course , Craig ' s play didn ' t sell until it went_to New York. &quot; * For his part , Emmes flatly rejects the imputation that unless South Coast helps serve commercial interests it is doing anything less than it should . &quot; When you get involved with commercial producers , you end_up four-walling your theater , &quot; he said . &quot; The money people come_in and tell you to get lost . It becomes the out-of-town tryout . All you have to do is turn_out the lights when you leave . We ' ve never sought validation in New York , and we don ' t need it now. &quot; Both Emmes and Benson are also opposed to staging co-productions with other nonprofit theaters . &quot; Inevitably , &quot; Emmes said , &quot; decisions are taken not for the best production here , but for the best production wherever it ' s going . that ' s not good enough. &quot; Still , no rule is made to go unbroken . South Coast ' s most ambitious project for next season will be the world_premiere of Lucas ' &quot; God ' s Heart , &quot; to be done_in cooperation with Lincoln Center Theater in New York . The Lincoln Center company , which was instrumental in developing the play , will stage the subsequent production . Emmes and Glore have attended recent workshop readings in New York , and Glore has been giving Lucas advice on the script . Said Benson : &quot; We ' re excited about working_on another premiere with Lucas . Our relationship with Craig is a prime example of what we always wanted South Coast to be -- the artistic home for great writers . It will be a great way to celebrate our second 30 years. &quot; *</TEXT>
