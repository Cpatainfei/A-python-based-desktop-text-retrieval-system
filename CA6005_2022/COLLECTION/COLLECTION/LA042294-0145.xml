   <HEADLINE> U.S. TRADE EXPO IN HANOI DRAWS 5 # 000 ON 1ST DAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> More_than 5 # 000 people flooded an exhibition_hall here Thursday for the first trade expo to feature exclusively U.S. companies since Vietnamese Communists won control of the country 19 years ago . But after pushing their way past the booths of nearly 45 exhibitors and sweating in a building cooled only by ceiling fans , many left the long-awaited event disappointed , complaining that there were too many industrial products and too few goods for average people to buy . &quot; There isn ' t anything here for me , &quot; said Nguyen Thi To Anh of Hanoi . &quot; Pepsi has drinks and food , but only for show . Hong Kong and Taiwan companies had at their exhibitions things like women ' s purses , which people could buy immediately , or they gave_away samples of hand_lotion , or whatever . The Americans didn ' t give anything away. &quot; Even Vietnamese business professionals , hoping to buy industrial goods , said the selection was too narrow at &quot; Vietnamerica Expo ' 94 , &quot; sponsored by Vietnam Investment Information &amp; Consulting of San Diego . &quot; I ' ve been looking_forward to buying construction materials directly from U.S. manufacturers , but there are only several of such companies here , &quot; said Tran David , president of APC Ltd. , a distributor of construction supplies based in Ho Chi Minh City . He had taken a two-hour flight north just for the trade show . &quot; Our builders still prefer American products after all these years because the equipment lasts longer , &quot; Tran said . Half an hour before the 9 a.m. opening ceremony , thousands already had gathered_in front of the Giang Vo Exhibition_Hall . Organizers had reserved the first two days of the four-day fair for government officials and business professionals , but many curious citizens filtered into the crowd , some wearing conical straw_hats , others with_children in their arms . The United States ' stars and stripes and Vietnam ' s flag of a single gold star on red background flew side_by_side at the ceremony . &quot; I never thought this day would happen , &quot; said George Dang , an Irvine business consultant who attended the expo with his client , Tran . &quot; I have to take a picture of the flags. &quot; But Hanoi resident Nguyen Van Huynh said he had predicted that the Americans would return . &quot; In 1973 , American soldiers left without fanfare . Several years ago , I was telling my friends that the Americans would come_back in 1993 and we ' ll be rolling_out welcoming carpets for them . You see , I was off only four months , &quot; Nguyen said , smiling . Red_carpets were rolled_out , and dignitaries cut ribbons and received flowers from young_women wearing pastel-colored ao dai , the traditional Vietnamese dress worn over flowing pants . VIIC ' s managing director , Giang Tran , told the crowd in his opening speech : &quot; You will always be a member of an exclusive club that has been present at an historic event. &quot; When the doors of the exhibition_hall opened , organizers set_off firecrackers . Amelia Fendell , a sales agent for Fosanna Furniture in New York , stared in amazement at the wall of people crowded around her booth , which featured solid mahogany furniture made in Vietnam and kiln-dried to withstand humidity anywhere in the world . The furniture attracted attention because the new kiln-drying technology makes_it much stronger than the brittle goods the Vietnamese are accustomed to now . &quot; I don ' t know how to explain why there are so many people here . I think it ' s sheer fascination for U.S. products , &quot; Fendell said . Digital Equipment Corp . International , which has a plant in Costa Mesa , exhibited computers and was scheduled to hold a seminar this morning to introduce its products . &quot; We just opened an office in Hanoi two days before the expo , &quot; said Norris L . Hickerson , business manager for Digital ' s Asia region . Consumers examined Gillette razors , Kraft ' s Cheese Whiz and Frito-Lay potato_chips -- though none of the chips were available at the booths for visitors to sample . Similarly , PepsiCo representatives brought packages from the company ' s subsidiaries , Pizza Hut and Kentucky Fried Chicken , but the cardboard boxes were devoid_of actual pizzas and fried chicken . &quot; Pizza ! , &quot; Dang exclaimed as he walked by the Pizza Hut booth . &quot; But our people aren ' t used to cheese , so it will be interesting to see how they market this. &quot; Otis Elevator Co. ' s booth had a sample elevator , while Vector Venture Corp . displayed water purification equipment for industrial companies . As he passed organizers on his way_out of the expo , Nguyen Van Huynh left them with this advice : &quot; Next time , try to bring more U.S. products people could buy right away . Things like fashionable clothes . I guarantee you people will buy . Let us soak in goods we can use every day before bringing all this industrial stuff. &quot;</TEXT>
