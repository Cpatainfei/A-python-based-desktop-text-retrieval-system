   <TEXT> Fears for what was once dubbed the &quot; special relationship &quot; between Washington and London prompted this week ' s visit of British Prime_Minister John Major to President Clinton . What ' s at stake is nothing less than an extraordinary bilateral alliance that has fought two world_wars together and has in so many other ways contributed to world order . In the hands of Winston Churchill and Franklin D . Roosevelt -- or even , for that matter , in those of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan -- that relationship was special . But the current thought among the respective foreign_policy establishments is that it would be better to bury the adjective special and replace it with something less elevating . That would be a mistake . Each of the two nations needs an ally on which it can count in the crunch , and neither Washington nor London is likely to find anyone better for quite a long_time . The relationship ran_into serious trouble even before Clinton ' s election ; during the U.S. presidential campaign operatives from the_British Conservative_Party helped the Bush reelection effort , an outrageous intervention in the internal political affairs of the United States that angered Clinton ' s people . Neither is London entirely happy with Clinton , of course . His decision to grant a visitor ' s visa to the head of the_Irish Republican Army ' s political wing evoked bitter criticism from the_British government -- further evidence that the personal chemistry between Clinton and Major is not what it might be . However , chemistry is irrelevant : Thatcher and George_Bush did not get_on well , as her memoirs reveal , but bilateral relations were excellent . Both Clinton and Major are masters of non-ideological common_sense , which is the linchpin of the special British-American alliance . It is their job to get_along : Too_much depends_on it .</TEXT>
