   <HEADLINE> HMO WINS MEDI-CAL PACT DESPITE CRITICAL AUDITS ; HEALTH : SEN . WATSON WAS LISTED AS BOARD_MEMBER WHEN CONTRACT WAS AWARDED . OFFICIALS DENY RECEIVING FAVORS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> State health officials recently awarded a no-bid contract potentially worth more_than $ 400 million to a Long Beach-based HMO that serves the poor , even though state audits repeatedly have found significant deficiencies in the health plan ' s quality of care . The contract with Molina Medical_Centers to treat Medi-Cal mothers and their children throughout the state was awarded in May , one month after the newly licensed health_maintenance_organization put state Sen . Diane Watson ( D-Los Angeles ) on its board of directors . Watson , who as chairwoman of the Senate Health Committee oversees health programs , said she had helped guide Molina in securing its HMO license from the state . Although she said she did nothing to influence the contract , Watson pointed_out that the company probably got_it because she was listed as a board_member . &quot; It ' s really great if you can snag the chair of the committee , &quot; she said in an interview . &quot; Somebody who can really help you. &quot; However , Watson said that Molina officials used her name without permission and that she resigned from the board as soon as she found_out . State officials said Molina got no special treatment , and company officials denied that they misused Watson ' s name . Licensing officials said they have a signed document from Watson indicating that she was willing to serve as a board_member . The Molina contract was awarded as the California Department of Health Services is preparing to channel billions of dollars into a program that will make sweeping changes in_services for the poor by moving about half the 5.4 million Medi-Cal enrollees into managed care by mid-1996 . The decision to select Molina as a prime contractor has prompted health_care advocates to question whether the state in its rush to expand the managed-care program has adequately screened providers and whether political intervention has influenced the process . The criticism drew an angry response from the company ' s owner , Dr. C . David Molina , who said state auditors have misjudged his clinics ' medical_care . Molina , who opened his first clinic to serve Medi-Cal patients in 1980 , said no legislator has done him any favors , and he attributed his rapidly growing company ' s success to hard work . His son Dr. Joseph M . Molina , vice_president of quality assurance , said the company has thrived by providing readily accessible medical_care with a multilingual staff to &quot; a patient population that many have shied_away_from &quot; treating . The Medi-Cal managed-care program -- a cornerstone of Gov . Pete Wilson ' s cost-saving proposals -- has set_off a scramble among HMOs for the multimillion-dollar contracts that health officials are awarding without competitive bidding . At the same time , health_care advocates are demanding closer scrutiny of private providers . &quot; Californians pay_for the medical_care provided the poor through state and federal taxes , &quot; said Geraldine Dallek , executive_director of the Center for Health_Care Rights . &quot; The state needs to be much more vigilant that our taxes are spent only on providers giving high-quality care. &quot; Dallek , whose organization analyzed the annual audits of Molina and six other Medi-Cal managed-care providers under a grant from the Irvine Foundation , is scheduled to release a report this week on the findings . For four years in a row , state audits have found a &quot; significant deficiency &quot; in Molina ' s quality of care , records show . In 1992 , the health officials uncovered such a potential threat to patient care at one facility that they considered halting Molina ' s enrollment of new patients , but decided against it because the problems were not systemwide . The next year , health officials temporarily suspended Molina from signing_up patients in the Hmong community as a sanction for marketing violations involving that Southeast Asian group in Sacramento . This September , six months after the Department of Corporations licensed Molina as an HMO , auditors from that agency cited the company for violating licensing requirements in six categories , including quality assurance , accessibility of care and handling of patient grievances , according to a confidential audit obtained by The Times . Auditors Visit Clinics Responding to complaints , auditors visited three clinics in the Sacramento area and examined the treatment of 40 patients . Records show they concluded that Molina Medical was systematically denying patients necessary care to boost the company ' s profits . They cited more_than a dozen cases , including the following : * Molina ' s medical director canceled emergency surgery for a 12-year-old girl whose appendix then ruptured . * A 5-year-old boy with a shattered shinbone waited 18 hours to have his leg set_in a cast while his pain medication ran_out and an orthopedic surgeon tried in vain to get authorization from Molina Medical to treat the boy . * A 5-year-old boy who displayed the speech_patterns of an infant was not provided speech_therapy . * A 10-year-old boy suffered a ruptured eardrum while he waited two years for &quot; definitive treatment &quot; of ear infections . &quot; Medical decisions are being influenced by financial considerations or , if not , by medical misjudgment , &quot; the auditors reported . &quot; There is far more concern with the expense of the care than the quality. &quot; The medical director declined comment , but Dr. Martha Molina -- David ' s daughter and associate medical director -- said emphatically : &quot; Financial decisions do not drive medical decisions. &quot; David Molina declined to comment on the audit because it is a confidential document . But he defended the quality of the health_care that his 40 clinics provide to the poor in seven counties , including Los Angeles , Orange , Riverside and San Bernardino . &quot; I think we do a pretty damn good job frankly , contrary to what some of these audits look_like , &quot; he said . The audits are based on &quot; one-tenth of 1 % &quot; of the company ' s 62 # 000 patient files , producing an inaccurate picture , he said . His son John C . Molina , chief financial_officer , produced state statistics showing that in 1993 Molina Medical did an equal or better job of screening children for preventive health_problems than nine other licensed HMOs , even though prior state audits had faulted Molina in this area . Company officials also pointed to their patient surveys that give them high marks for service , including trust in the doctors . Health officials said Molina , like other managed care providers , has had problems , but nothing severe enough to keep them from getting additional contracts . Joseph Kelly , chief of the Medi-Cal Managed Care Division , said Molina ' s audits do not show &quot; the kind of situation where . . . people are dying in the street because of poor care. &quot; He acknowledged that it is unusual for a provider to be cited year after year for &quot; significant deficiencies &quot; in its quality of care . But he said Molina Medical deserves credit for promptly filing plans to correct problems . &quot; We don ' t want a Band-Aid put_on , &quot; he said . &quot; They have always made . . . a systemic fix. &quot; On Blue Shield Board Watson , whose South-Central Los Angeles district has a high percentage of Medi-Cal beneficiaries , has been closely associated with the health_care industry and health issues for many years . She served nine years on the board of directors of Blue Shield of California and reported receiving $ 5 # 700 during her last year of service in 1986 . In 1988 , the state Fair Political Practices Commission fined Watson $ 2 # 000 for failing to publicly disclose a $ 5 # 000 personal_loan given to her by a health_care lobbyist . During the last several years , Watson ' s committee has passed legislation that has helped mold the state ' s Medi-Cal managed-care program . Last summer she carried a bill that creates a commission in Los Angeles to award a contract worth about $ 450 million to serve Medi-Cal patients in this county . Molina officials said they intend to compete for it . Fueled by government contracts and aggressive door-to-door marketing of its services , Molina has mushroomed from three clinics treating 5 # 000 patients in 1989 into a statewide chain that has received more_than $ 63 million from the state during the last 2 1 / 2 years . In its latest contract , awarded May 1 , Molina officials were authorized to enroll up_to 148 # 000 patients ; the state has set a cap of $ 423 million on payments to Molina to treat these patients through 1997 . What opened the door to this major contract award , and other contracts too , was an HMO license granted to Molina by the Department of Corporations . For Molina , the license enlarged the company ' s scope of services and made_it eligible for more money and higher reimbursement rates from the state . But there were many hurdles . Watson said Molina officials came_to her office early this year asking_for help in guiding them through the bureaucratic maze . &quot; I told them how to work the system , &quot; Watson said . Time Was of Essence The senator said she called the Department of Corporations to advise them that Molina ' s application was_on its way . &quot; Don ' t put it over on the shelf and let it sit there all year , &quot; she said she told them . Time was of_the_essence for Molina officials , who say they were in a rush to get licensed by the April 1 starting date of a new contract to serve 20 # 000 people in the Sacramento area . The license was approved in mid-March , the same month that the company distributed $ 15 # 500 in political contributions to 23 state legislators , according to LegiTech computerized campaign records . None went_to Watson , but her campaign had received $ 500 from Molina several months earlier . Although a number of other HMOs make substantial contributions , it was an unprecedented outpouring of largess for Molina . &quot; We thought it was a wise thing to do at that time , &quot; said David Molina . Department of Corporations officials said the contributions did not have any impact on their decision to grant the license , and neither did their receipt of a disclosure statement listing Watson as a member of Molina ' s board . Department senior counsel Anita Ostroff said Molina met all licensing requirements . She said she reviewed all &quot; relevant information &quot; regarding Molina but had not seen copies of the health department ' s audits . Ostroff said she relied_on verbal assurances by Kelly of the health department that the Molina clinics &quot; were in compliance , with no outstanding deficiencies. &quot; Kelly said he had not read the audits either but relied_on staff summaries when he briefed Ostroff . Attorneys at the National Health Law Program who have critiqued Molina ' s licensing application blasted Ostroff ' s failure to use &quot; common_sense &quot; and review critical audits that point to a &quot; track record &quot; of problems with access and quality of care . Records do show that Ostroff had many reservations about Molina ' s licensing proposal , but her fundamental concern was a potential conflict_of_interest within the family-run company that could result in medical decisions being dictated by financial concerns in violation of state regulations . She questioned whether the company ' s top_executives -- Molina ' s children -- would be sufficiently independent of their father to make the proper medical decisions without regard for his pocketbook . Three of David Molina ' s children serve in key posts ; the company also employs two other children and his wife . This question was resolved , Ostroff said , when the company revealed that it was expanding its board beyond the family by adding four financially disinterested outsiders , including Watson , to serve without compensation . &quot; We are not blind , &quot; Molina wrote the Corporations Department , &quot; to the possible perception that a conflict exists when numerous family members hold key positions in a health_care service plan. &quot; Watson said she thought the reason Molina officials put her on the board was because they were &quot; really pleased that I helped them &quot; with their licensing . The senator said she believes the chief advantage of this for Molina would be her political clout with the bureaucracy . &quot; They thought , ' Oh , what better person to have_on the board than the chair of the Senate Health and Human Services Committee , ' &quot; Watson said . &quot; They wanted me to sit on the board so I could help them. &quot; Watson noted that Molina ' s offer was &quot; not an unusual request . I could be_on 1 # 000 boards right now if I wanted , &quot; she said . She agreed to consider Molina ' s offer but never formally accepted a board post , she said , because it would have posed a conflict with her legislative oversight responsibilities . &quot; For God ' s sake , get me off that board , &quot; she remembered telling her chief_of_staff after a television_reporter inquired last spring about her membership on the panel . However , her resignation letter was not sent_for four months -- and during that period , Molina was awarded the state contract potentially worth $ 423 million . Molina officials said Watson was the company ' s first choice as an outside board_member because &quot; she was very knowledgeable_about what was happening in health care. &quot; John Molina expressed shock that Watson now says she had not agreed to serve on the board . He said all board_members filled_out and signed forms giving identifying information to the Department of Corporations as part of the company ' s licensing application . But when asked about this , Watson said she never signed any forms : &quot; Oh , no . No , no , no , no , no. &quot; Ostroff , the Corporations Department attorney , refused to release the confidential forms but confirmed that all board_members signed the documents under penalty of perjury . She said Molina ' s license would not have been granted without the documents and added that Watson has not complained that her name was used without her knowledge . As of last week , Ostroff said , the department had not received notification that Watson had left the board . In her Aug . 24 letter of resignation to Molina , Watson did not mention that she had been placed on the board without her knowledge . She resigned &quot; with sincere regret , &quot; citing scheduling conflicts that had prevented her from attending the board ' s only meeting . Watson said she believes that the health_care group &quot; probably &quot; got its contract because she was listed as a board_member . &quot; They ( health officials ) look and they see who the board is and they ' re willing to give it , &quot; she said . Kelly of the health department said Molina never notified his department that Watson was_on the board . On April 25 , when David Molina sent health officials a letter , he advised them he was sending a copy to Watson . The letter , addressed to health department chief Kimberly Belshe , thanked department officials for speeding_up his new contract award , among other things . Molina said in an interview that he sent copies to Watson and two other legislators in hopes that his letter would get more attention . Belshe , who met with Molina at least twice this year , said the department did nothing for Molina that it would not do for any other contractor . Officials said that at Molina ' s request , the agency did some &quot; technical things &quot; to accelerate the contract award , including drafting the language in_advance of the HMO license approval and streamlining the application process . Once Molina had secured the license , the contract was virtually assured because health department procedures require the department to contract with any willing , qualified HMO that accepts the department ' s non-negotiable reimbursement rate . Kelly said Molina joins 14 other HMOs that provide managed health_care to the poor -- the largest is Cigna Healthplans of California , with 114 # 000 enrollees . For Molina to reach its enrollment goal of 148 # 000 patients , Kelly said , the company will have to prove it has the resources and personnel to treat them . ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Watson Resignation Letters In this letter , Sen . Diane Watson ( D-Los Angeles ) resigns from the board of directors of Molina Medical_Centers , a managed health_care group that received its HMO license this spring and then got a contract potentially worth $ 400 million to serve Medi-Cal patients throughout the state . Watson has said that the HMO put her on the board without permission , which company officials deny .</TEXT>
