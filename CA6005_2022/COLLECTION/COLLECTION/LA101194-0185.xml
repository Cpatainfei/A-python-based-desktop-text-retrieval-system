   <HEADLINE> HOWARD ROSENBERG / TELEVISION : ONLY ON TV : RETHINKING FDR . . . AND ROSEANNE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dueling Rosies . that ' s tonight ' s exotic television matchup as PBS opens a two-part biography of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Fox premieres its one-nighter quickie about Roseanne ( the former Roseanne Arnold and Roseanne Barr ) . The latter is a Fox crotch job , with &quot; Roseanne : An Unauthorized Biography &quot; doing to its subject pretty much what she did to the national_anthem a_few years back . Much more melodic is &quot; The American Experience : FDR , &quot; a 4 1 / 2-hour documentary about the nation ' s 32nd chief_executive , whom many historians regard_as having redefined the presidency while leading the United States through the Great Depression and horrific World_War_II . Charismatic and commanding despite being disabled by polio , Roosevelt was a &quot; President like no other , &quot; narrator David McCullough notes tonight . Yet it ' s Roseanne , star of tabloid headlines , of squabbles with her estranged spouse , Tom Arnold , and of_her_own hit ABC sitcom , who ' s much the better known today . Such is our obsession with boisterous celebrities who are ultimately devoured by the very media they spend much of their careers manipulating . * Not that there wasn ' t a broad streak of show_business in Roosevelt , whose own epic manipulation of the press is arguably unmatched in modern presidential politics . &quot; You and I are the two best actors in America , &quot; he ' s recalled saying to Orson Welles in tonight ' s &quot; FDR , &quot; a memorable documentary from David Grubin , whose impressive PBS credits include a grand 1992 biography of Lyndon Johnson and &quot; Marshall , Texas ; Marshall , Texas , &quot; an extraordinary chronicle of Bill Moyers ' return to his hometown a decade ago . And now , happy days are here again , so to speak , for despite offering little that appears new , Grubin ' s &quot; FDR &quot; is a fascinating , meaningful rendering of history , stylishly crafting diverse data into an irresistible narrative that has great relevance for a 1994 audience . After all , it was Roosevelt whose bold signature in the 1930s and early 1940s was the kind of big government that today is increasingly reviled by outspoken politicians , reformers and others who insist that only through federal smallness can a troubled United States ever achieve salvation . &quot; FDR &quot; shines a light on the complex man behind the caricatured broad grin and long cigarette_holder . By and large , it ' s a warm light -- one that also leaves some shadows , for , as we ' re told here , he was a &quot; charming but a distant figure &quot; even to those who were closest to him . They included his controlling , ever-looming mother , whom we meet here as matriarch of the Hyde Park estate that symbolized young Franklin ' s cocooned upbringing as a product of old-monied New York royalty , a family that was already represented in the White_House by FDR ' s cousin , Theodore Roosevelt , when Franklin graduated from Harvard with his own aspirations for the presidency . In 1905 , he marries his distant cousin , Eleanor , who will also have an enormous influence on him while much later becoming a renowned political figure in her own_right , her independence growing after she discovers his affair with her social_secretary , Lucy Mercer , in 1918 . After this , Eleanor moves to a separate cottage two miles from Hyde Park , and the couple never again &quot; shared the intimacies of married life , &quot; McCullough says , a political union supplanting their marital partnership . This relationship continues through Franklin ' s dozen years in the White_House , which ended with his death in 1945 . The uniqueness of that relationship is described here , as are FDR ' s famed Depression-era policies , the tactics he used to aid England even before the United States was drawn into World_War_II and his special relationship with another epic figure of history , Winston Churchill . Roosevelt was &quot; flawed , inconsistent and often deceitful , &quot; McCullough says . But , most agree , he was very good at being President . Of special_interest here are unusual old photographs and home-movie footage that relate a separate story about an FDR whose paralysis was much more severe than most of the public ever realized . There he is in 1921 , at age 39 , after contracting the dreaded polio , the last time he is seen standing alone on_his_own feet . And there he is cavorting in a pool with_children at the Warm Springs , Ga. , clinic he established for victims of the disease . And quite stunningly , there he is in a four-second sequence , played in slow_motion , appearing to walk even though he couldn ' t . Knowing that to be disabled in those days was &quot; political poison , &quot; he devised a rocking-motion technique -- one hand pushing_down on a cane , the other on the arm of one of his sons -- that gave the illusion of him walking . &quot; I don ' t think five in 100 Americans even knew he was paralyzed , &quot; says observer Alistair Cooke . Wearing black braces that blended in with black pants and black socks helped , as did a &quot; conspiracy of consent &quot; on the part of White_House photographers -- which would be unthinkable in the 1990s -- to not reveal the extent of the President ' s disability . For whatever reason , &quot; FDR &quot; has its own information blackouts -- never telling us how Roosevelt felt about his paralysis , for example , or his feelings about civil_rights for blacks , an issue on which Eleanor apparently pressed him . The program also dismisses in a_couple_of inadequate sentences FDR ' s approval of Japanese Americans being rounded up and interned after Pearl_Harbor and his decision not to intervene in the Nazi death camps . What does come_through is the personal_magnetism that he relied_on . &quot; Meeting Roosevelt , &quot; Churchill said at a eulogy for the President , &quot; was like uncorking your first bottle of champagne. &quot; * Fox ' s film on Roseanne ( NBC has another scheduled later this month ) is the cork minus the champagne . Despite Denny Dillon occasionally locating glints of humanity beneath her subject ' s shrill veneer , and David Graf persuasively cloning Tom Arnold ' s mannerisms , &quot; Roseanne : An Unauthorized Biography &quot; is as dispensable as all those self-serving photo ops and talk-show appearances these two orchestrated en route to their noisy breakup . If there is anything new_to say about them -- given the clanging media music that has accompanied every aspect of their volatile lives -- this mishmash of flashbacks and flash forwards doesn ' t say it . Roseanne moves through her troubled adolescence ( she ' s institutionalized after blindly walking in heavy traffic with a towel over her head ) , then through her teen pregnancy , until one day , a year later , she wakes_up looking_like Denny Dillon , who , in some of the wigs she ' s given to wear , looks_like Meat_Loaf in drag . Fox says certain characters and events in its movie ( directed by Paul Schneider and written by Karen Harris ) have been &quot; fictionalized , &quot; so take it literally at your own risk . Dillon ' s Roseanne is part witch , part victim , miserable as a kid in a dysfunctional environment , later miserable in a marriage with her first husband -- a beer-guzzling , belching good old_boy . More misery awaits at the end of her marriage to Tom , whom she meets at a comedy club in Minneapolis . By this time she ' s already lived to the hilt , doing guys for money while working as a cocktail waitress . Tom does drugs . Then he ' s in rehab . Then Tom and Roseanne are in a mansion . Then Roseanne ' s chewing_out someone . Then Tom and Roseanne are chewing_out each other . Then Roseanne chews_out her family , accusing her father of molesting her after Tom says he was molested as a kid . Then they chew each other out again . Then Roseanne locks Tom out . Then Tom pounds on the front_door . Then Roseanne hides under the sheets . This gets you to the end credits . Meanwhile , if you really haven ' t had your fill of Roseanne , she ' s available playing herself on Wednesday ' s season finale of HBO ' s &quot; The Larry Sanders Show. &quot; The script has Roseanne helping poor Larry recover from his own prescription-drug addiction . If he reveals he ' s in rehab , Larry ' s producer warns him , &quot; Fox will make a TV movie about you before the end of the year. &quot; That you can take literally . * &quot; The American Experience : FDR &quot; airs at 9 tonight on KCET-TV Channel 28 and KPBS-TV Channel 15 , and at 8 p.m. on KVCR-TV Channel 24 . &quot; Roseanne : The Unauthorized Biography &quot; airs at 8 tonight on Fox ( Channels 11 and 6 ) . &quot; The Larry Sanders Show &quot; airs at 10:30 p.m. Wednesday on HBO .</TEXT>
