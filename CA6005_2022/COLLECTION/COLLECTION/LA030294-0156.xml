   <HEADLINE> MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL OFFICIAL SPIED FOR BRITAIN , RUSSIANS SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A senior Russian official in the military-industrial complex has confessed to spying for Britain and has been charged with treason , Russian officials announced Tuesday . The bombshell , widening the espionage war between Moscow and the West , comes just when U.S. officials thought the exchange of unpleasantness over the alleged spying of CIA official Aldrich H . Ames for the Kremlin was over . On Monday , Russia expelled a U.S. diplomat it said was the CIA station chief here in retaliation for the expulsion last week of the alleged Russian intelligence chief in Washington . Both sides had expressed hope that the diplomatic tit_for_tat would end the spat triggered by the Feb . 22 arrests of Ames and his wife . But Tuesday , the Federal Counterintelligence Service , the KGB successor agency responsible_for rooting_out foreign spies on Russian soil , suddenly announced the espionage arrest . The alleged spy , an unnamed top official &quot; within a military-industrial complex organization , &quot; had been given special spy equipment for writing invisible messages and had been delivering military and economic secrets to the_British Embassy in Moscow for more_than a year , the agency said . The British Embassy in Moscow and the_British Foreign Office in London had no comment Tuesday . One noteworthy aspect of the announcement was that officials said the man was arrested Jan . 15 and confessed 10 days later , nearly one month before Ames and his wife were arrested . The Federal Counterintelligence Service did announce in January that 20 Russians had been arrested for spying for foreign countries last year . But it did not give any details . Mikhail P . Lyubimov , a former KGB station chief in Copenhagen , said the_British spy flap is in the &quot; vintage Soviet style of leaving no blow unanswered. &quot; &quot; I would n ' t yet call this a revival of the Cold_War , &quot; said retired KGB Gen . Oleg D . Kalugin . &quot; But it demonstrates at minimum that some of those still in or close to power who are interested in reviving the Cold_War are very active , jumping at the opportunity to flex muscles the world hoped were gone. &quot; Kalugin faulted the United States for provoking the conflict but said Russia should have limited its retaliation to Monday ' s expulsion of U.S. Embassy counselor James L . Morris . The arrest announcement is in keeping with the harder foreign_policy line that President Boris N . Yeltsin struck in his first_State of the Nation address to Parliament last week . But a spokeswoman for the Foreign Intelligence Service , the agency that would have directed Ames if he was in fact a Russian spy , struck a conciliatory note . Tatyana V . Samolis noted that Russian intelligence wants to continue to cooperate with its Western counterparts in fighting arms proliferation , international organized crime and terrorism . Sergei L . Loiko in The Times ' Moscow Bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
