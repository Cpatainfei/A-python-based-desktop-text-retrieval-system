   <HEADLINE> NATIONS WILLING TO SPEND MORE TO CUT POPULATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As debate drew to a close Thursday over the divisive issue of abortion , the world ' s donor nations signaled that they are ready to consider tripling their spending on population programs to pay_for an ambitious new strategy of family_planning , reproductive health and women ' s programs . A drafting committee at the International Conference for Population and Development took_up the financing issue Thursday morning , and committee chairman Nicolaas Biegman said donor nations have indicated their readiness to pay about a third of the $ 17 billion a year envisioned for new population programs . The $ 2.1 billion a year now allocated by foreign donors finances only about a fourth of the costs for family_planning programs , which will rise to unprecedented dimensions under the new , 20-year global population plan being reviewed this week in Cairo . The plan calls not only for expanding traditional contraceptive programs but instituting a wide variety of related programs aimed at reducing birthrates by improving the health and social and educational status of women . They include everything from maternal health_care to early education programs for girls , AIDS prevention and vocational_training for poor women in the developing world . The United States recently raised its annual family_planning allocation from $ 425 million to $ 585 million , &quot; and there is the likelihood it will go_up again , &quot; said J . Brian Atwood , administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development . &quot; we ' ll be doing a lot more of what we ' ve been doing , a lot more intensively , with very specific indicators in mind , &quot; said Atwood , whose agency is the single largest funder of family_planning programs in the world , with total expenditures of $ 5.8 billion since 1965 . &quot; We need to increase in real terms what we ' re providing , and we need to encourage others to do more , &quot; Atwood said . Along with the annual increase to $ 585 million , President Clinton before this week ' s conference said U.S. spending on family_planning programs would increase to nearly $ 2 billion by 2000 . Throughout the week , U.S. , European and World_Bank officials have been noncommittal but upbeat about prospects for funding the global plan , whose costs will escalate to $ 21.7 billion a year by 2015 . &quot; Strangely enough , I don ' t think resources are an issue , &quot; said World_Bank President Lewis T . Preston . &quot; The reality is that a lot of what we ' re talking_about is not really very high cost . . . . Reallocation , I think , will take_care of the resource question. &quot; * World_Bank estimates say a new preventive health_care package , including maternal and child_care , can be provided at an annual cost of only about $ 8 per person in the poorest countries . Raising girls ' primary_school enrollment rates to equal boys ' would cost slightly less than $ 1 billion -- about 2 % of annual education spending in the developing world . Japan recently announced it will increase its family_planning spending tenfold , from $ 40 million a year to $ 400 million . Germany said this week it will spend $ 2 billion over the next seven years ; several other countries have also announced funding boosts during conference discussions this week . In a study of future financing needs , the independent , nonprofit Population Action International_Organization estimated that the United States would have to increase its family_planning allocation to $ 1.85 billion over the next six years , and $ 2.35 billion a year by 2015 , to meet its share of the need . That analysis is based on a formula in which developing and industrialized nations share the costs based on their average wealth . The United States has resisted any formula for cost sharing that would commit it to future appropriations . &quot; We strongly prefer not to use quantitative or percentage targets , but operate in the spirit of best effort , &quot; said a member of the U.S. delegation to the conference . U.S. officials concede that funding major new aid programs will be difficult , and say new money for population programs will probably have to be reallocations from other programs . &quot; We are going_through a period , if not of donor fatigue , ( then ) of post-Cold War reassessment , including the area of foreign_aid , &quot; said the U.S. delegate . Ten countries -- the United States , Germany , Japan , Norway , Britain , Sweden , the_Netherlands , Canada , Finland and Denmark -- now account_for 90 % of all donor contributions to family_planning programs worldwide . Conference delegates predicted they would move quickly through the remaining resource allocation issues to be discussed , and a final resolution of the abortion debate was expected this morning . Seeking to break a logjam that developed when several Latin_American nations joined the Vatican in opposing wording on abortion in the program of action , conferees circulated a new amendment substantially similar to an earlier compromise . It removes all references_to &quot; legal &quot; abortion . In response to complaints about terming some abortions &quot; unsafe , &quot; since some regard all abortions as unsafe , a World_Health_Organization definition of unsafe abortion is appended . The drafting committee broke for an overnight recess and was scheduled to make a final_decision today . But Biegman made_it clear that he was not prepared to continue the argument for long . &quot; It is exceedingly improbable that in the end the Vatican will take_part in the final consensus on the document , which does not detract very much from the document . I ' ve never heard anyone say on the part of past U.N. documents , ' But the Vatican doesn ' t agree. ' The trend rolls along , &quot; said Biegman , who is part of the Dutch delegation . &quot; We have to try as long as we can to accommodate them . And then the moment comes , it may be at a very late stage , that we say , ' This is the text. ' &quot;</TEXT>
