   <HEADLINE> HOPE RISES AMONG WEARY SRI LANKANS FOR CIVIL WAR ' S END ; ASIA : EVEN IN DISTRICT WHERE 57 WERE KILLED IN ATTACK BY SUSPECTED SUICIDE BOMBER , ' A GOOD TIME HAS COME. ' CREDIT FOR OPTIMISM GOES TO NEW PRESIDENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On the streets of Grandpass , the scruffy district where vendors hawk wriggling fish plucked from the Indian_Ocean and boys square_off in the hot sun for a pickup game of cricket , hope has come again . It hasn ' t been a frequent visitor of late . This is the working-class neighborhood of Colombo , after all , where a_few weeks ago , as best the police can determine , a woman strapped explosives tightly to her body and detonated them at a nighttime political rally . She snuffed_out 57 lives , blowing_off her own head in the process . But that was then , and this , people in Grandpass tell you , is now . &quot; A good time has come , &quot; plump , white-haired Narayani Gopalan , 71 and missing her two front_teeth , said one recent morning with total and simple conviction . &quot; God has opened his eyes. &quot; Members of Sri Lanka ' s educated , ruling elite use more complex explanations . But , in_general , they concur : Their island , whose ancient name of Serendip was refashioned by a whimsical 18th-Century Englishman to denote the facility of stumbling across something wonderful by chance -- &quot; serendipity &quot; -- may be having a run of luck itself . Yes , reasons for caution remain , the politicians , observers and journalists note . But at no time over the past 11 years have hopes been so high that a peaceful end could be brought_to one of the world ' s longest-running civil_wars , the armed struggle by some of Sri Lanka ' s minority Tamils for a homeland of_their_own . An obscure , exotic conflict for the rest of the world , the ethnic dispute has traumatized this lushly beautiful land that unfurls across the dark waters to the southeast of India like an emerald leaf . The country ' s integrity has been broken , with the rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam controlling tracts of the north and east . A quarter of revenue collected by the Colombo government is expended on fighting them , one minister says . The belligerents have battled to a stalemate , and the population as_a_whole appears to have had enough . &quot; We ' re now in a situation where the vast majority of the people in Sri Lanka -- Sinhalese , Tamil , Muslim -- are looking_for peace , &quot; said Jayadeva Uyangoda , senior lecturer in political_science at Colombo University . &quot; It wasn ' t so a year ago. &quot; Proof incarnate of this change , as well as one of the causes , is the ascension of a dark-eyed widow and single mother to the highest office in the land . Shattering a political taboo , Chandrika Kumaratunga declared that the use of force to suppress the insurgency has failed and that it is time to negotiate . To the astonishment of many , such frankness struck_a_chord with most Sri Lankans , including members of the Sinhalese majority , who have grown increasingly impatient to see an end to the bloodshed in which , by varying estimates , 30 # 000 to 50 # 000 people have died . On Nov . 9 , just 1 1 / 2 years after Kumaratunga first stood as a candidate in a provincial election , her people made her the country ' s president by a historic majority . The day she took_office , she mixed what sounded like Kennedyesque New Frontier rhetoric with lyrics from the old Broadway musical &quot; Man of La Mancha &quot; to hold_out the possibility of a brighter tomorrow . &quot; Let us together climb those unreachable heights , let us realize that difficult but beautiful dream , &quot; she said . Neelan Tiruchelvam , a lawyer and human_rights activist who represents a moderate Tamil party in Parliament , observed of Kumaratunga , &quot; She believes very much that this is her moment in history and that it needs to be grasped with firmness and resolution. &quot; But such sunny optimism could vanish as quickly as the southwest monsoon blows in each May to blanket the sky with rain_clouds , because the new president is dealing with an uncertain interlocutor . She wants to end the war . The goals of the Tigers , who are led by a ruthless guerrilla and Clint Eastwood fan who just turned 40 , are still a matter of speculation . Radio intercepts indicated that after Kumaratunga ' s election , Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran ordered his units to observe a weeklong truce unless attacked . But he and his men have generally kept their opinion of the island ' s new leader to themselves . &quot; My feeling is that the Tigers don ' t want peace , &quot; said Regi Siriwardena , a veteran Colombo journalist . &quot; After all , they now have a de_facto state . Why give it up ? &quot; This modern-day parable of the lady and the Tigers is especially dangerous for the lady . If Kumaratunga doesn ' t make significant concessions , the Tigers will dismiss her promise of &quot; peace and prosperity &quot; as campaign rhetoric . If she seems too conciliatory , or the Tigers give nothing in return , she risks a backlash among the Sri Lankan people and the army . And if she can ' t deliver the improvement in the situation that people throughout the island are intensely hoping for , she will see public support melt away . &quot; When you have large expectations , you have to fulfill them quickly or there will be a reverse movement fairly rapidly , &quot; said Ajith Samaranayake , editor of the state-run Observer and Sunday Observer newspapers . The bloody events of Oct . 24 in Grandpass underline the need for caution . The suicide bomber , a young_woman in her mid-20s who most Sri Lankans believe was an agent of the Tigers , wiped_out the main opposition candidate for president and other leaders of his United National Party . Significantly , this massacre came_after , and not before , preliminary talks had begun between envoys sent by Kumaratunga , who was then prime_minister , and the rebels . &quot; They came , they talked , and they killed , &quot; Uyangoda of Colombo University summed_up . Kumaratunga and her government avoided pinning the blame on the Tigers as the election approached . But if a police_investigation finds that the rebels were responsible , or if more bombing and terrorist attacks occur , she will face mounting doubt and hostility among the Sinhalese , the predominantly Buddhist group to which she and nearly three-quarters of Sri Lanka ' s 17.2 million people belong . Some are already downright suspicious of her &quot; peace process. &quot; &quot; Tamils have absolutely no right here as a separate entity or group , &quot; said Sinhalese hard-liner Harishchandra Wijayatunga , who ran in the presidential election as candidate of the nativist Sons of the Soil . &quot; If any Indian wants to go_home , fine . If he wants to stay , he has to be part and parcel of our culture. &quot; Kumaratunga has held_out the carrot of &quot; extensive devolution &quot; of power and the possible redrawing of provincial borders to tempt the Tamil rebels to lay_down their arms and accept something less than Tamil eelam -- a Tamil nation . In light of her country ' s long history , those are weighty concessions . &quot; Federalism in Sri Lanka is a political four-letter_word , &quot; Uyangoda said . One reason , perhaps the main one , lies_in the national mythology . Throughout the centuries , Buddhist monks doubling as historians portrayed Sri Lanka as the last bulwark of Buddhism against the rising tide of Hinduism . Although the Sinhalese were transplants from India themselves and the Tamils are believed to have begun arriving no later than the 3rd Century BC , or about the same time that Buddhism reached these shores , they went_down in the chronicles , still used in classrooms today , as invaders and profaners . British authorities further muddied the demographic picture of the tea-growing colony they called Ceylon by importing even more Tamils from India in the late 19th Century to work the plantations in the central highlands . Today , Tamils make_up about 18 % of the population . Arabs , Malays , Muslims from India and Portuguese and Dutch colonists also arrived over the centuries and put_down roots . The desires of the Muslims , 7 % of the population , also must be part of Kumaratunga ' s calculations , because many of them live_in the eastern lands where the Tigers operate . Unlike many other ethnic protest movements , the Tigers actually hold territory that they have transformed into an economic and military power base . On the northern Jaffna peninsula , they effectively control administration , courts and taxation . They may be the only guerrilla force in the world to boast a navy . In their prisons , they hold an estimated 4 # 000 prisoners . &quot; This is not a guerrilla force in mountains somewhere , &quot; human_rights activist Tiruchelvam said . &quot; This is a de_facto state. &quot; Little wonder , then , that Kumaratunga ' s proposal of a more federalist Sri Lanka has elicited no ringing public endorsement from the Tigers ' Prabhakaran and his subordinates . &quot; They ' re already in power , &quot; said Siriwardena , the Colombo journalist . Moreover , unlike the_Irish Republican Army or the Palestine Liberation Organization , the Tigers have not yet made any dramatic gestures to open the door to peace . It is true that they might have , had talks_about a cease-fire gone_ahead as scheduled . Kumaratunga broke_off those contacts within hours of the Grandpass explosion . Last Monday , Sri Lankan officials said Kumaratunga sent a message to the Tigers regarding a new date to resume peace talks . The guerrillas offered a new truce in exchange for an inquiry into the mutilation of one of their top intelligence_agents , who was beheaded after being shot by security_forces . Government troops also went_on red alert as the Tigers launched &quot; Heroes ' Week , &quot; the annual commemoration of their thousands of comrades in arms slain in the protracted battle for independence . While the hesitation waltz toward the negotiating table continues , Kumaratunga ' s intention seems to be the winning of the hearts and minds of the civilian population . Her government has already softened an economic embargo of Jaffna to allow shipments of milk , food , gasoline , cement and other commodities to reach the Tigers ' beleaguered haven . The electricity grid is being repaired . Some observers scoff at the apparent naivete of attempting an end_run around the Tigers . The joke has been that civilians in Jaffna are allowed by the tough , disciplined rebels to open their mouths for only two reasons : to brush their teeth or yawn . &quot; The Tamil people want peace . But they can ' t be allowed to have it by the Tigers , &quot; said Daham Wimalasena , an official in the United National Party . The last time the government and rebels held serious peace talks , ending in 1991 , the Tigers used the 14-month lull to rearm and regroup . When the peace talks collapsed , they went_back to fighting . The country ' s president , Ranasinghe Premadasa , was blown to bits on May_Day of last year in a bombing much like the Grandpass attack . The Indian prime_minister who dispatched a peacekeeping force here , Rajiv Gandhi , was also killed by a woman wearing a concealed explosive_charge as he campaigned in 1991 . The Tigers are blamed for both assassinations , but deny responsibility . Kumaratunga and her supporters are clearly betting that on the other side of the lines in Jaffna , there are many people who share their desire for peace . &quot; It will take a long_time , &quot; Tiruchelvam predicted . &quot; But we believe that there is probably a new generation emerging in Sri Lanka who want to look_at problems differently , who feel the previous government made mistakes and who -- dare I say ? -- are more tolerant of diversity . They don ' t feel diversity is an impediment to nationhood , and I think Chandrika ( Kumaratunga ) symbolizes that new generation. &quot;</TEXT>
