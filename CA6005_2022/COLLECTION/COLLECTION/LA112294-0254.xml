   <HEADLINE> HUMAN ERROR RULED_OUT IN FERRY DISASTER AFTER BOW DOOR IS CHECKED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The crew wasn ' t to blame for the Estonia ferry disaster , but metal fatigue or poor design might have been , investigators said Monday . &quot; We can forget the theory of human error , &quot; said Tuomo Karppinen , a Finnish member of the commission that is investigating the disaster. &quot; The crew had not left the bow door open. &quot; More_than 900 people died when water flooded the Estonian ferry ' s deck after the 56-ton door was torn_off during a storm . Investigators had been unsure whether the door came_off because it wasn ' t shut properly or because there had been a technical malfunction or design flaw . Metal fatigue has not been ruled_out , Karppinen said . Salvagers raised the door from the Baltic seabed Friday , hoping for definitive evidence of why the ship sank Sept . 28 while traveling from Tallinn , Estonia , to Stockholm . Of the 1 # 049 people on board , only 136 survived . &quot; It ' s very clear now that all_the hydraulic locks on the door were closed at the time of the accident , &quot; Karppinen said . &quot; The locks were broken , with some of the pins still left in the hinges. &quot;</TEXT>
