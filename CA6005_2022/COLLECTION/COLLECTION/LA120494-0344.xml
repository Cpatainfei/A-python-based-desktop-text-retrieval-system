   <HEADLINE> MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI : GETTING BANK TO PAY CHECK CHARGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Q : I recently lost my wallet , which contained a single blank , unsigned check . I reported the loss to my bank , which advised me to close the account and reopen a new one . The following day , the wallet was found with the check intact . I immediately notified the bank ; no new account was opened . However , four checks which I had written before the incident were returned to the payees with the notation that they had been stolen . Now I am facing significant returned-check fees . Am I responsible_for these charges ? -- A.H.J . * A : Robin Leonard , an author and lawyer specializing in consumer_credit issues , recommends that you immediately contact the bank ' s vice_president for customer relations or consumer affairs and explain your story clearly and forcefully . The bank , Leonard says , should be persuaded that it acted improperly in handling your matter and should help you by reversing the returned-check fees . A representative of one of the state ' s largest banks concurs with Leonard ' s advice , noting that consumers are always well served to communicate directly with their financial_institution when problems like this arise . Be sure to note that you informed the bank that just a single check was potentially lost , stressing ( if this is true ) that you provided the number of that missing check . Also remind the bank official that you reported the check found within 24 hours of the first report , thus eliminating the need to close the account and open a new one . Your bank_account was in a state of limbo for a matter of a single day . When did those returned checks get_to the bank for payment ? Within that 24-hour period ? Or later ? If they arrived after your account had been returned to normal status , the bank can be faulted for poor internal communications and should be willing to make amends . At the same time , you should realize that banks try hard to protect their customers from check forgeries , which unfortunately are_on the rise . Even a single stolen check_in the hands of a determined thief can lead to dozens of forged copies that could fool all but a highly trained professional . Banks have to walk a fine line between protecting their customers from fraud and allowing them the easiest possible access to their accounts . When the normal routine is broken , as in your case with a misplaced check , the system is taxed to its limit and unfortunately can fail . You need to understand that you are in part responsible_for your situation because you did misplace the check . Taking your share of the responsibility when you talk to bank officials would be appropriate . How to Restore Your Good Credit Q : I filed for bankruptcy in October , 1985 . It was finalized by court_order in January , 1986 . Since that time , I have had no credit_cards because every time I apply for one , I am rejected . Now I am getting_married . What can I do to clean_up my credit history ? -- W.E.G . * A : The period during which bankruptcies appear on a credit history usually expires on the 10th anniversary of the bankruptcy filing . Your credit history should be wiped clean in about 10 months . However , having a clean_slate is not the same as having a good credit history . Potential creditors want to see a history of steady credit repayment before they extend credit to a new customer . How can you show you can responsibly handle credit when no one will extend you any now ? With what is known as a &quot; secured credit card. &quot; Although these cards look and spend like other charge_cards , holders are required to deposit an amount in a bank_account at least equal_to the amount of their card ' s credit limit . For more information about banks offering these cards , contact Bankcard Holders of America . This nonprofit organization also publishes a report detailing the interest_rates and annual fees charged by many ( but not all ) credit_card issuers in the United States . Each pamphlet costs $ 4 and is available by writing Bankcard Holders of America , 524 Branch Drive , Salem , VA 24153 . Nasdaq : By Any Other Name . . . Q : Can you give me the full name of Nasdaq ? -- D.P. * A At one time , the initials NASDAQ stood_for the National Assn . of Security Dealers ' Automated Quotation system . However , now Nasdaq is simply the name of the nation ' s busiest stock_exchange , which is owned and operated by the National Assn . of Securities Dealers . At its inception in 1971 , NASDAQ offered a price quotation system for over-the-counter stocks by gathering information over a network of telephone_lines from the multiple market makers who are expected to post competing prices for buying and selling shares of the stocks they handle . The system has evolved into a full-fledged stock_market . It now lists 5 # 600 stock_issues from about 4 # 800 public companies . But unlike the New York Stock_Exchange , where a single &quot; specialist &quot; firm is the sole market maker for each stock_listed , the Nasdaq still has multiple market makers for each listed stock , in the hope of generating competing prices . However , in October the Justice_Department opened an antitrust investigation into Nasdaq ' s operations , looking_into allegations of price fixing and other illegal practices that might rig Nasdaq trading against small investors in favor of large , institutional traders . The investigation is still in a preliminary phase . The NASD has vigorously denied the existence of collusion in its operations . Last month , the market proposed new rules designed to give small investors a better chance to buy stock shares at more competitive prices . * Carla Lazzareschi cannot answer mail individually but will respond in this column to financial questions of general interest .
