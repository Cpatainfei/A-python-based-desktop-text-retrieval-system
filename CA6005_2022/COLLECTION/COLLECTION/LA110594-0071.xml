   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ; CLOSE-UP ; GROANS AND GRIPES AS THE CAMPAIGN GRINDS TO A CLOSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The end of the 1994 gubernatorial contest is finally in_sight and here is what it ' s come_to : Gov . Pete Wilson ' s campaign is struggling to keep its underwear clean , while Kathleen Brown ' s staff is having trouble buttoning its pants . The other day , H.D. Palmer , Wilson ' s communications director , was aboard a northbound plane when he got a call from campaign headquarters asking him to head south . He politely declined . &quot; I said , ' Number 1 , I ' m taxiing down the runway . Number 2 , I have no clean socks and shorts and I think we would all be_well served if I did , ' &quot; he recalled . &quot; I flew to Sacramento and did my laundry. &quot; Julie Buckner , Brown ' s deputy press secretary , uses a different yardstick to measure the stress of a campaign ' s countless 14-hour days : the waistline . An informal poll of 23 staffers at Brown ' s Los Angeles headquarters found a net weight gain of 147 pounds , and Buckner admits that a chunk of that can be found on her slight frame . &quot; Here ' s the problem : no exercise , bad food , and you eat late at night , sometimes in mass quantities -- takeout pizza , takeout Indian food , takeout Thai food , takeout pasta , &quot; said Buckner , who worked for Sen . Barbara Boxer ' s campaign before Brown ' s . &quot; I haven ' t been to an aerobics class since the 1992 election cycle. &quot; Especially during these final days , campaigns are unforgiving creatures . To work for one is to be pulled into another world -- a world where winning comes first , even if that means your own chores don ' t get done and your body is less a temple than a temporary storage facility for cold pizza . Lately , some people have been wearing their campaign-induced troubles like badges of honor . A Brown staffer grimaces when he says he has gained 40 pounds -- and yet he seems to tell everyone he meets . A Wilson employee laments that the campaign has left no time for romance -- but there ' s a hint of pride in her voice , as if loneliness is proof of commitment . Such is the perverse pleasure that shared suffering brings . In all_the analogies people use for a campaign staff -- a team , an army , a family -- togetherness is the common thread . If nothing else , the people who do Wilson and Brown ' s scheduling , who arrive_at their campaign stops in_advance , who type up their press_releases and answer their phones can all say they survived campaign ' 94 . And the worse the ordeal , the more impressive that sounds . To be fair , reporters are the same way . For weeks , members of the news media have greeted one another at campaign events by shouting_out how many_more days remain before Election_Day . &quot; Is it over yet ? &quot; they ask each other with a sigh that says : It sure is tough doing such difficult and important work as ours . Dan Schnur , Wilson ' s chief campaign spokesman , has tapped into this vein in the fax newsletter he sends to reporters , Schnur Shots . Every one of these missives ends with a tally of &quot; HOURS TO GO &quot; till the polls close . &quot; Hang_in there people ! &quot; Schnur writes . &quot; I think we can make_it ! &quot; For his part , Schnur says that after several years working in politics , he ' s got his family trained not to expect much from him during a campaign . &quot; My grandparents know I ' m only going_to celebrate the High_Holy_Days with them on odd-numbered years , &quot; he said , referring to the Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur . But the daily grind still takes a toll . To let_off steam , Schnur may be the only person on either campaign staff who has stuck_to an exercise regimen -- but not for the reasons you might think . &quot; I have a secret : I ' ve named each different weight machine after a different newspaper or newspaper reporter . I use them to work_out my aggressions , &quot; he said . &quot; The ( Los Angeles ) Times is the overhead curl . The ( San Jose ) Mercury ( News ) is the shoulder press . The ( San Diego ) Union-Tribune is the leg extension and L.A. TV generally is the Stairmaster . A Northern California newspaper that shall remain nameless has to be rotated ( to different machines ) , otherwise I ' d be deformed by now. &quot; * &quot; What is that phrase from the ' 60s ? ' War is not good for children and other living_things ' ? &quot; asked Steven M . Glazer , an aide to Brown . Before Glazer joined Brown ' s campaign , he extracted an unusual promise from campaign chairman Clint Reilly . Glazer wanted to be home every night between 7 and 9 to spend time with his children , ages 3 and 7 months . Reilly agreed , but Glazer has rarely been able to make_it happen . &quot; Campaigns are perennially understaffed . If you recognize what needs to be done . . . and you ' re trying to produce quality work , then it ' s very difficult to ever go_home , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s worth the sacrifice to work for someone you really believe_in . But it ' s never easy to say that when you ' re still at_work at 9 o ' clock at night and you haven ' t tucked your kids into bed. &quot; Palmer , Wilson ' s communications director , has spent the last five months far from his fiancee , who is in graduate_school in Chicago . He consoles himself by remembering that even if she were here , he would n ' t see her . Recently , his diet has consisted largely of frozen macaroni_and_cheese , and diet cola . &quot; In a campaign , caffeine is your friend , &quot; he said . &quot; You get_up in the morning , you read the paper , you eat breakfast , you come_in , you work 12 or 13 hours . . . you microwave something , you go_to_bed . Repeat . Repeat . Repeat. &quot; So how to recuperate ? Hawaii and Jamaica are among the favored destinations for those who have planned post-election vacations . Also on the schedule : exercise , and lots of it . &quot; I ' ve been_on the staff since Jan . 3 and I ' ve gained double_digits , &quot; said Buckner , Brown ' s deputy press secretary . &quot; My goal is to lose the weight twice as fast as I gained it. &quot; More on Elections ' 94 : The Times ' special election package is available through TimesLink and Times on Demand .
