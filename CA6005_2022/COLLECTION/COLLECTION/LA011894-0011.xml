   <HEADLINE> BUT WHAT ABOUT MICHELLE KWAN ? ; WHY PENALIZE THE TORRANCE GIRL ? PETITION THE OLYMPICS FOR AN EXCEPTION TO ALLOW ALL THREE SKATERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No matter what happens , Michelle Kwan is Olympic material . She and her family deserve gold medals for graciousness and good sportsmanship . As the bizarre events unfold , the 13-year-old Torrance figure skater may yet strut her triple jumps and double axels on the Olympic ice_rink in Lillehammer , Norway . But whatever the outcome , why was Kwan asked to step aside ? Earlier this month , Kwan competed in Detroit , Mich . at the U.S. Figure_Skating Championships , which served as the Olympic trials . She was the youngest competitor there , with the technically most difficult freestyle program . First- and second-place winners earn the right to go_to the women ' s skating competition at the Winter Olympic Games . Despite a fall during her routine , Kwan took second place to Tonya Harding . There are only two Olympic berths in women ' s figure_skating this year . According to the rules , Harding and Kwan should go_to Norway next month . But the 45-member international committee of the U.S. Figure_Skating Assn . asked Kwan to relinquish her rightfully earned spot . They offered Kwan first alternate and voted unanimously to offer Kwan ' s berth to Olympic champion Nancy Kerrigan , the bronze-medal winner in the 1992 Olympics . As everyone reading or watching the news knows , Kerrigan , 24 , was unable to skate in the trials after she was injured by a baton-wielding assailant . Arguably , if Kerrigan had competed , Kwan probably would have come_in third and cheerfully wished Kerrigan and Harding well on their Olympic journey . Skating officials justified their decision citing Kerrigan ' s favored status among experts . And Harding , 23 , from Portland , Ore. , was cause for high medal hopes as well . But what guarantee is there ? What crystal ball says an uninjured Kerrigan would have won first or even second ? All it takes is a bad fall , a crucial jump deferred or missed , a stumble , a wobble , even the insidious flu bug . In the world of competitive sports , as in life , anything can happen . So why was Kwan asked to make the sacrifice ? Why were Kwan ' s dreams of Olympic competition postponable ? Why should she , and not Harding or Kerrigan , be asked to wait until the next Olympics ? Are Kwan ' s ambitions less valued ? Are they not as valid as Kerrigan ' s dreams ? As Harding ' s dreams ? In trying to justify the decision , Kwan ' s youth has often been cited -- &quot; she ' ll see another Olympics. &quot; No doubt she will . Kwan is young , intelligent , self-possessed and healthy . She ' ll probably have her day to bask in the glow of the Olympic torch , if not this year then in the next Olympic year . But who can guarantee it ? And what about the potential loss to Kwan ' s financial future , the thousands of dollars from possible endorsements she might have garnered , as Kerrigan or Harding undoubtedly will if they win the gold ? Was it easier to defer Kwan because she and her family would make no waves , cause no violent protest , lodge no formal complaint ? And why couldn ' t the U.S. committee simply petition the International Olympic Committee to expand the women ' s team to include the rightful winners as well as Kerrigan . Why penalize Kwan , who did nothing wrong except work hard , skate beautifully and make no loud protest . Can winning a medal be more important than fulfilling the promise of a young Asian-American girl ?</TEXT>
