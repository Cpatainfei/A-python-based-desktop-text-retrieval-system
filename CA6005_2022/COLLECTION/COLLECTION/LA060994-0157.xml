   <HEADLINE> REGIONAL REPORT ; SOUTH BAY ; CHEMICAL_REACTION ; DISCOVERY OF DDT IN THE BACK YARDS OF TWO LOCAL HOMES HAS REKINDLED CONCERN AND FEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> At first , federal_officials spoke cautiously about the white chunks unearthed in a South Bay back yard . This mysterious material , they said , could be something as harmless as construction debris . But just to make_sure , they shipped a_few clumps to a laboratory for testing . And on the May morning after the results came_back , the white chunks were suddenly a hot news_story . Television vans jammed the alley leading to the excavation site . Reporters took turns holding_up a vial of the material as cameras zoomed_in . It was a startling find : DDT had been dug from the yard of an unsuspecting couple_on West 204th Street in the Harbor Gateway area of Los Angeles . No one -- not the residents , not their neighbors , not even the experts at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency -- could say where it came from . &quot; It ' s scary . Stuff like this should not be happening . This is the 20th Century , &quot; said Robin Hatch , 30 , a mother of two who lives only three doors from where the DDT was found . Chunks of DDT as big as bowling_balls simply are not supposed to be buried in yards where one resident grew tomatoes and another held family barbecues . In a society that has grown ever more wary of pesticides -- even to_the_point of diligently scrubbing its organic vegetables -- the back-yard discovery on West 204th Street seems like an American nightmare . EPA officials say they have no evidence that the chunks came from a DDT factory once located nearby . Yet the drama is a disconcerting reminder that DDT ' s legacy looms large in the South Bay . For years , federal_officials and consultants have been quietly measuring the DDT content of neighborhood soil , attic dust , ground_water , storm drains and even crabs and fish . Their mission : to analyze the effects of the DDT manufacturing_plant operated by Montrose Chemical Corp . from 1947 to 1982 on Normandie Avenue , just east of Torrance in Harbor Gateway . The task resembles some long but engrossing detective novel , with numerous plot twists and many chapters still unwritten . It illustrates the Gargantuan job that government_agencies , companies and residents confront as they try to identify and clean_up industrial pollution . Montrose became one of the world ' s leading DDT producers in an era when the white powder was hailed as a magic potion . But as Americans ' enthusiasm for the pesticide cooled , Montrose ' s fortunes faltered . Today , the former factory site is one of 1 # 200 on the federal Superfund list of the most hazardous toxic-waste sites in the United States . Its impact has been felt far beyond the 13-acre site , now a vacant_lot . Thousands of pounds of DDT are trapped in sediment inside a local sewer_line , and still more pollutes water underground . Health experts emphasize that although DDT is a suspected carcinogen and , in large doses , can affect the human nervous_system , most deposits detected around the Montrose site are too small to threaten human health . Besides , there are only a_few routes by which residents could be exposed to the DDT , health officials say . Contaminated soil could be eaten by children . Adults could consume home-grown produce sprinkled with tainted soil or eat DDT-laden eggs laid by back-yard chickens . People could ingest attic dust , which experts say is unlikely . Or they could eat DDT-contaminated fish , which is one reason the state recommends against eating white_croaker caught at places such_as White ' s Point and Los Angeles Harbor . Government experts say they have no evidence that such exposure has caused health_problems in the area . Still , some residents wonder if the pesticide could be the source of the rashes , nausea , dizziness and aching joints that they say are prevalent in the West 204th Street neighborhood . The outpouring of public concern in recent weeks has lent new urgency to the ongoing federal studies of how DDT affected the South Bay environment . Montrose ' s neighbors say they just want the government to hurry in its cleanup efforts . &quot; It ' s not just hurting human_beings . It ' s hurting our planet , &quot; Hatch said . &quot; I want them to have whoever is responsible clean it up. &quot; The goal of the 14-year-old federal Superfund program is supposed to be exactly that : to pinpoint which companies polluted a site and require them to investigate and , as much as possible , finance the cleanup . At Montrose , the scope of that project is enormous . To date , Montrose and its insurance_companies have spent at least $ 17 million for studies and initial remediation , and that ' s only the beginning . A Montrose study estimates that cleanup costs for ground_water alone could range from $ 30 million to $ 359 million . And although the Montrose site was first proposed as a Superfund candidate in 1984 , an overall cleanup plan has yet to begin or even be announced . Montrose says it broke no laws and notes that industrial practices changed_over the past several decades . Throughout , the firm did its best to operate within industry norms and follow legal requirements , said attorney Karl S . Lytz of Latham &amp; Watkins , a law_firm representing Montrose . Meanwhile , despite years of costly studies and legal haggling , no one can say when the South Bay ' s DDT inheritance will be cleaned_up for good . Even after DDT was banned for most uses in the United States in 1972 , Montrose continued making_it for export to Africa , India and elsewhere . By the late 1970s , the South Bay plant was the only American DDT plant still operating . It finally shut_down in June , 1982 , and the building was torn_down soon after . Yet the environmental drama was just beginning . Investigators concluded that rainwater had carried some DDT from the plant into the storm drains . Montrose installed an asphalt cap over much of the property , and testing continued . The site officially attained Superfund status in 1989 . By then , monitoring wells had detected ground_water tainted with monochlorobenzene , a chemical used in DDT manufacturing that can cause liver and kidney damage . The testing went_on , unnoticed by many residents living nearby . Then the trouble started on West 204th Street , and DDT again became a household word in the South Bay . It was almost by happenstance that DDT was spotted in the back-yard soil . The EPA was screening soil from 14 yards along West 204th Street to make_sure it was not tainted by chemicals from the proposed Del Amo Superfund site to the north , where a synthetic_rubber factory once operated . With Montrose in mind , an agency official decided to add a test for DDT . When the tests came_back last winter , Del Amo chemicals were barely detectable -- but DDT showed_up in samples from two back yards on the street ' s north_side . More tests , taken beneath the surface in the two yards , found the pesticide at 45 times the level considered safe . Frightened residents formed a committee and fought successfully to have 25 families temporarily moved to hotels while federal crews removed toxic soil and took it to a hazardous-waste landfill in Nevada . Cleanup was supposed to take only two weeks , but a glitch developed May 6 when workers uncovered the first of the DDT chunks . In response , EPA officials agreed three weeks ago to keep residents in temporary housing for up_to six months during an investigation . The DDT deposits appear to be scattered in fill soil that goes as deep as seven feet in one back yard . Investigators now hope to trace where the fill came from -- and determine if it extends under homes to the east of the two excavated yards . That probe , which could last through the summer , will help decide how much cleanup is needed and if residents should be permanently relocated . That would be an unusual step -- taken only once before in the EPA ' s four-state Western region -- but one that the agency has promised to study . &quot; We don ' t necessarily think there ' s an acute health risk out there , &quot; said Nancy Lindsay , chief of the Superfund enforcement branch for the EPA regional office in San Francisco . Although residents can choose to return to West 204th Street during the investigation , gardening or even allowing children to play in their own back yards is not advised . Nearly four weeks after the discovery of the first DDT chunks , the EPA says it is still perplexed about how they got there . Montrose ' s attorney says he is not aware that the DDT came from Montrose . &quot; We have no idea of where the material came from , &quot; attorney Lytz said . Because of the uncertainty , the federal_government is not charging Montrose for the back-yard cleanup . The cost to date : more_than $ 500 # 000 . For many neighbors , an underground soup of monochlorobenzene and talk_of 60-year timelines to clean it up are simply too colossal to dwell upon . Much more immediate -- and more alarming -- are the white chunks of DDT . For many , that simple image has poisoned the sense of security that once characterized their neighborhood . Now they worry less about cleanup schemes than about how to avoid returning to West 204th Street . Dunia Ponce feels_like a fool for having ever bought her two-bedroom house there . &quot; I worked very hard to buy my American_dream , &quot; said Ponce , 33 , a registered nurse . &quot; I know it ' s not a mansion , a palace . But it ' s everything to me. &quot;</TEXT>
