   <HEADLINE> RETURNING TO HAITI ; THE MILITARY OPTION IS FRAUGHT WITH RISKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> ' No , I don ' t despair , I don ' t believe_in despair , but our problems won ' t be solved by the Marines . I ' m not sure I would n ' t fight for Papa Doc if the Marines came . At least he ' s Haitian . No , the job has to be done with our own hands . We are an evil slum floating a_few miles from Florida , and no American will help us with arms or money or counsel . We learned a_few years back what their counsel meant. ' - Graham Greene , ' The Comedians ' 1966 * Once again , the American public is being prepared_for an impending , if not imminent , military operation in Haiti . What might such an operation entail and at what cost ? Some senior military people I know are perplexed by what it is they will be called_on to do if ordered into Haiti . They are confident that any operation will be thoroughly professional . But they are troubled by what appears to be a lack of a clear military objective . There are only two possible missions that the military can accomplish . The President could order U.S. forces to enter Haiti and take_over the government , installing the exiled , democratically elected president , Jean-Bertrand Aristide , by force . Or Bill_Clinton could order forces to protect , and perhaps to evacuate , U.S. citizens whose lives may be endangered . Both types of missions have been carried_out before . The protection mission widely hinted at by the Administration would not be a simple one . The Marines fear that any evacuation of Americans living_in Haiti may result in a long-term occupation . The last time such an operation was mounted -- in 1915 -- it was 19 years before the Americans left the island . Although the plan_of_attack is undergoing revision as conditions change , it probably calls_for the seizure of the airport at Port-au-Prince and the establishment there of a secure base for subsequent operations to evacuate U.S. Embassy personnel , business people and journalists in the Haitian_capital . To round_up the hundreds of Americans , mostly missionaries and aid workers , scattered at dozens of remote locations and small_towns in Haiti , the Marines would have to fan_out into the countryside . Many of these Americans would have to be told that they were indeed being rescued and need to move to an area from which they could be picked_up by helicopter or small_boat . This rescue mission -- known as a Non-combatant Evacuation Operation , or NEO -- is fraught with risk , because it would take time to get_to the sites where Americans are known to be and because military authorities could not possibly know all_the locations where Americans might be in danger . The second mission that may be assigned to U.S. forces is restoring the &quot; legitimate &quot; government to power in Haiti . U.S. troops have recently performed this mission . It was , in large part , what Desert Storm was all about -- taking Kuwait from the Iraqis and returning it to the Kuwaiti government . But any such operation in Haiti would be more like those undertaken by U.S. forces in Grenada and Panama . The thugs surrounding Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras would probably have to be captured or killed before Aristide could be safely returned to power . These kinds of operations are called Coups_de_Main . They can be quite bloody . They require extensive preparation and rehearsal . They always demand the use of overwhelming force , because all centers of power have to be stormed . In a country like Haiti , this would be a tall_order , since armed bands of thugs , many not under Cedras ' control , may welcome the opportunity to try to take_control and militarily challenge the Americans . Of course , there is a good possibility that the Cedras gang would simply run when faced with the prospect of doing battle with a Panama-like U.S. military_campaign involving 22 # 000 soldiers . Certainly , neither the Haitian armed forces nor the elite presidential guard , which is loyal to Cedras , would be a match for a suitably sized and equipped U.S. invasion force . The entire Haitian army numbers no more_than 7 # 000 , with about 1 # 000 of them armed and equipped for fighting with small arms only . It has about a dozen armored cars , a_few dozen light guns , a tugboat and two traffic-cop airplanes . One Marine can do more damage than the entire Haitian military . The more difficult problem for U.S. forces would be to deal with the well-armed citizenry , which makes Haiti more like Somalia than Grenada . For example , what will the rules of engagement be if a U.S. soldier comes_upon a threatening teen-ager with an Uzi ? Most Haitians , in or out of uniform , will not warmly embrace invading Americans . And taking a shot at a low-flying helicopter is an easy way to express such displeasure . Even the environment will be hostile . Most of the time , it ' s hot and humid in Haiti . Worse , the hurricane season is about to begin , and Haiti sits in the zone of greatest danger from killer storms . Finally , the Administration must consider in its military calculations the price to be paid in U.S. personnel . While ours is the most highly trained and effective military_force in the world , it is also one of the least rested . The Marines now waiting offshore Haiti had only two weeks of leave before being deployed there . They may have to wait some more . Certainly , they will have to engage in more dry-run training exercises before being committed to battle . It will be a supreme challenge to the motivation of these troops and to the skills of their leaders to get mentally prepared_for battle in Haiti . Pentagon leaders call it the &quot; Optempo &quot; problem . The fact is , that since the end of the Cold_War , more U.S. forces have been deployed for longer periods away from their home bases than ever occurred during the long face-off with the Soviet_Union . Operations such_as those in Somalia and in the former Yugoslavia cost millions in additional deployment and maintenance costs . This has produced a severe strain on readiness rates , with the Army and Air_Force currently experiencing serious shortfalls in the mission-capable rates of much of their combat equipment , according to recent congressional testimony by the logistics chiefs of the services . The political_leaders in Washington are locked_in a policy dilemma of immense proportions when it comes_to Haiti . Faced with distasteful diplomatic and political options for dealing with the thugs in Port-au-Prince as a result of an irresolute Haitian policy , they are turning_to the military to create an option to bail them out . The armed forces may find a way to do_it , but it is a risky enterprise that is probably not worth the likely costs. *</TEXT>
