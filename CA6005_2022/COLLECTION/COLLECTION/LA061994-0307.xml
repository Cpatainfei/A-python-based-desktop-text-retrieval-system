   <TEXT> During the 1984 Olympics , no one expected a third-place battle between Yugoslavia and Italy to stir much interest . But , following a run_on the ticket_office , 100 # 374 people packed the Rose Bowl that night . Maybe , thought Alan Rothenberg , Olympic soccer commissioner , the United States could someday host the World Cup . Rothenberg , now the CEO of World Cup USA , worked behind the scenes to bring World Cup soccer to America . On July 4 , 1988 , the United States won the right the host the 1994 event . Rothenberg , a Los Angeles attorney , was elected president of the U.S. Soccer Federation in 1990 . He brought professionalism to the organization , which just a_few years before was a disjointed group that raised some funds with bake sales and car washes . He organized the federation along the lines of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee -- of which he had been a part . As expected , Rothenberg expertly maneuvered Los Angeles into the central role of the event . On July 17 , they ' ll play the World Cup_finals at the Rose Bowl , the eighth cup game played there -- more_than in any other U.S. city . BILL DWYRE</TEXT>
