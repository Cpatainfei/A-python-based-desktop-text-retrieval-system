   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 : SEMIFINALS ; TEARING_DOWN THE WALL ; SUCCESS OF BULGARIA , ROMANIA MARKS ONLY BEGINNING OF CHANGE IN WORLD SOCCER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Don ' t feel bad for Dimitar Penev just because he has to work_on his birthday . Penev , who turns 49 today , has reason enough to celebrate . In the last month he has gone from almost complete obscurity to worldwide fame . In fact , it would be fair to say that when he blows_out the candles today , his name will be recognized by more people than that of Zhelyu Zhelev . Penev is Bulgaria ' s soccer coach . Zhelev is Bulgaria ' s president . Amazing what a little thing like a World Cup victory can do for a man . And for a country . After Bulgaria had knocked defending champion Germany out of the tournament on Sunday , both Zhelev and Lyuben Berov , the country ' s prime_minister , immediately were_on the phone to Giants Stadium , calling to congratulate Penev and his players . As every politician knows , it never hurts to tie your name to a winning team . This is Bulgaria ' s moment in the sun . After never having won a World Cup game in 16 attempts dating_from a 1962 loss to Argentina in Chile , the Bulgarians find themselves in the 1994 semifinals . And not as the underdogs , either . Having already beaten two-time champion Argentina and three-time champion Germany , Bulgaria is at least even money to do as well against three-time champion Italy . And after that ? Three-time champion Brazil in the final ? It ' s not too_much to dream , as Penev is finding_out this summer . But Bulgaria is not alone in celebrating this World Cup . Had it not been for the heroics of Swedish goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli , Romania , too , would have been taking_part in Wednesday ' s semifinals . For a long_time Sunday , there were comments , only half in jest , about the possibility of a Bulgaria-Romania final at the Rose Bowl . What ' s going_on here ? Why are the supposed &quot; unknowns &quot; from Eastern Europe suddenly in the limelight ? Sportswriters -- and not only Americans -- who earlier would not have known Basarab Panduru from Plamen Nikolov , have been tripping over themselves in the last few weeks , trying to learn the life_stories of such players as Ilie Dumitrescu and Borislav Mihaylov . You know things have gotten_out of hand when the balding dome of Bulgarian midfielder Yordan Letchkov becomes the subject of postgame questions . Is it a case of -- you will pardon the expression -- hair today , gone tomorrow ? Will the Bulgarians and Romanians fade into obscurity once the World Cup is over , or is there a new order to the soccer world ? The truth is , European soccer is undergoing a huge change . The end of communism and the breakups of the Soviet_Union and Yugoslavia have profoundly altered the international sporting landscape . Call it the fall and rise of Eastern European soccer . Communism ' s fall and soccer ' s rise . To better illustrate the point , consider the 1996 European Championship in England , qualifying for which gets fully under way in autumn . Always before , the qualifying competition was a fairly straightforward affair . But when the preliminary draw was held_in Manchester , England , earlier this year , organizers found they now had 49 countries seeking a place in the final tournament field of 16 . It once seemed as if Europe consisted_of only a_couple_of dozen countries . Now there are 50 . A host of new or resurrected nations are_on the scene , many of them from what used to be called &quot; behind the Iron Curtain. &quot; Every one of those countries has a national team . Every one of those national teams aspires to be the best in Europe . And many of them have players who , if they are given half a chance , can rise to international stardom . Romania ' s Gheorghe Hagi and Bulgaria ' s Hristo Stoitchkov are but the tip of the iceberg , the most recognizable Eastern European stars in this World Cup . There could have been more . Had Yugoslavia not degenerated into a civil_war , it would have provided a much better team in the tournament than Greece , whose feeble effort showed that it had only qualified because Yugoslavia was banned from international competition . Similarly , had Russia ' s soccer federation not become embroiled in an unseemly internal squabble pitting the players against the coach and federation , it could have brought its first_team to the United States and we would have seen such legitimate stars as Andrei Kanchelskis , Igor Shalimov and others . Then , too , the former Czechoslovakia , a World Cup quarterfinalist in 1990 , has officially split into two separate states , Slovakia and the Czech Republic . Once each of them puts its soccer house in_order , they will be back challenging Europe and the world ' s best . Croatia demonstrated Eastern Europe ' s potential this spring when it traveled_to Spain and scored a deserved 2-0 victory over the Spanish , who came very close to reaching the semifinals of this World Cup before bowing to Italy . Ukraine , which once provided most of the Soviet_Union ' s national team players , is sure to discover its own strength in the not-too-distant future . The same applies to former powers Hungary and Poland . The difficulty facing Eastern European teams , on both the club and national team levels , is money . With their nations ' economies strapped for cash , it is no surprise that their soccer federations are , too . The Bulgarian federation , for example , was_on the verge of bankruptcy and was saved only by Emil Kostadinov ' s last-minute goal against France that qualified Bulgaria for the World Cup . The federation stands to earn $ 1-2 million from the tournament , enough to give the players sizable bonuses and restore solvency to the federation . Others federations are not so fortunate . National teams are made_up of the best club players . But clubs with no money can ' t buy top players and therefore can ' t qualify for or compete well enough in European competition to earn the money that such competition brings . As a result , these clubs have to raise what money they can by developing promising young players and then selling them to wealthier clubs abroad . Such capitalistic ventures were not permitted under the old communist regimes , but now there is a lively market in Eastern European soccer talent , a market that will only become more frenzied because of the success of Bulgaria and Romania in World Cup ' 94 .
