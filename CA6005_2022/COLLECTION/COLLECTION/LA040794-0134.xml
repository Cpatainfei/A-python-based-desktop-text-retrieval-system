   <HEADLINE> BRITISH PULL_OUT OF MATCH ON HITLER ' S BIRTHDAY ; SOCCER : ENGLISH FOOTBALL ASSN . CANCELS GAME SCHEDULED FOR APRIL 20 IN BERLIN ON GROUNDS THAT IT WOULD ATTRACT NEO-FASCIST ELEMENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A controversial soccer match scheduled between the_British and German national teams in Berlin on Adolf Hitler ' s birthday was called_off Wednesday . The game , which was to have been played_on April 20 , was canceled by the_English Football Assn . on the grounds that it would attract neo-Fascist elements from Britain and Germany , and perhaps from elsewhere in Europe , to the stadium built by Hitler for the 1936 Olympic Games . German soccer authorities were furious over the cancellation , declaring that it played into the hands of far-right-wing groups by showing their power to stop a game between soccer superpowers . Germany is the current World Cup holder , and the game was considered an important warm-up before Germany defends its title this summer in the United States . England ' s soccer team is still enduring the humiliation of not having qualified for the 1994 World Cup_finals . Sports commentators in Britain said late Wednesday it seemed inexplicable that the &quot; friendly &quot; match had been scheduled for a day recognized as the birth date of Hitler , who was born in 1889 . A friendly match is one played outside of competition for qualification for the World Cup or the European Championship , each held every four years . Sir Bert Millichip , F.A. chairman , confirmed in announcing the decision that government intelligence reports indicated the match could be the focus for both right-wing and left-wing demonstrations . &quot; We have been fully aware of the risk of disorder for the past few months , &quot; he said Wednesday , &quot; but we had hoped that those risks might recede . Unfortunately , they have not , and it was the executive committee ' s decision that those risks were too high. &quot; Millichip said British authorities had offered the Germans a change of venue to Wembley Stadium in London , but this was declined . &quot; It ' s sad news , but I do feel that in the circumstances , it ' s the correct decision , &quot; British Coach Terry Venables said . A new date for the match -- dubbed the &quot; Hitler match &quot; by the_British press -- has not been set . Graham Kelly , the F.A. chief_executive , denied that his organization had handed a victory to the neo-Fascist organizations . &quot; We understand that viewpoint , &quot; he said . &quot; But in our opinion , even small risks are too great. &quot; In Germany , former team manager Franz Beckenbauer said he agreed with the &quot; sensible &quot; decision . But the decision came as a slap in the face to Berlin ' s sports and security authorities . Before the decision , Egidius Braun , president of the German Football Assn. , had declared : &quot; We are not going_to chicken_out . If we capitulate , the negative consequences for the sport and society would be far-reaching. &quot; The match was originally scheduled for Hamburg , but that city , realizing the implications of the date , pulled_out , and Berlin offered to stage the game instead . German neo-Nazis already had been calling their members to arms with the slogan : &quot; The Battle of the Century. &quot; And a pro-Nazi rally was reportedly scheduled for April 18 . Leftists smashed windows and threw acid into the offices of the Berlin soccer authority two weeks ago .</TEXT>
