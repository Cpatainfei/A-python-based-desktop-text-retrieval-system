   <HEADLINE> INSIDE OUT / NOTES FROM THE STYLE FRONT : HOW MR . B OUT CHICS THE TRES CHIC</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bravo , Mr. Blackwell . All the tres handsome , tres chic Frenchmen at the Yves Saint Laurent party Monday night couldn ' t compete with your . . . presence . Whatever possessed you to drape that mink car coat so saucily off your shoulders ? Or smoke a cigarette , Bette Davis-style , in a holder ? &quot; I wanted to run_up to him and say , ' Do you know you ' re wearing a dead_animal ? ' &quot; sputtered an outraged guest . But of course , she didn ' t -- because , well , Mr. B just might have responded with a cruel crack about her ensemble . Meanwhile , Saint Laurent ' s delicious , Fruit Loop-colored spring menswear -- orange-orange jackets , lemon-yellow gingham check suits and blue-blue tapestry pants -- was paraded before an audience that included butler-turned-millionaire Bernard Lafferty . The pony-tailed heir to the Doris Duke fortune arrived_at the Rodeo Drive store with an entourage that included an attractive Swedish woman and a personal bodyguard . &quot; He ' s a customer , &quot; we were told . The show ' s finale -- an embroidered Levi ' s jacket emblazoned with a sunflower and the words &quot; Love 1994 &quot; -- will go_to the highest bidder June 18 at the DIFFA ( Design Industries Foundation for AIDS ) auction at the Century Plaza Hotel . By the close of Monday ' s party , $ 1 # 200 had already been pledged . Do we hear $ 12 # 000 , Mr. Lafferty ? It Is Fun to Have Fun , but You Have to Know How The announcement Wednesday that San Francisco-based Esprit clothing company will make shoes , clothing and accessories decorated with Dr. Seuss characters didn ' t surprise us a bit . We ' d noticed a weird nostalgia for Dr. Seuss in our own Gen-X offspring and among those not of our womb . Like the young_man who lovingly read &quot; Green Eggs and Ham &quot; to his sweetheart in the children ' s section at Brentano ' s late one Saturday night . That Sam I Am , That Sam I Am , I Do Not Like That Sam I Am . . . . Dr. Seuss : the Kahlil Gibran of the ' 90s . And wasn ' t it just a year or so ago that &quot; Cat in the Hat &quot; hats were the rage at all-night raves ? Esprit has clearly tapped into a deep wellspring of post-adolescent kinship with the subversive creatures that populate the Seussian landscape . Uh , not really . &quot; Character-driven apparel has become a vital part of the business as evidenced by the sales of Warner Brothers and Disney , &quot; said Andy Cohen , president of Esprit Apparel . &quot; We believe this licensing_agreement is a great opportunity to expand our business. &quot; So_much for social theory . Duncan Lines Speaking of character-driven apparel , actress and Wheat Thins enthusiast Sandy Duncan will sell her own line of fashions for petite women starting March 17 on the Home Shopping Network . Duncan is particularly fond , she says , of a jumpsuit in soft crepe rayon available in black or peach -- just $ 69.95. &quot; The waist hits just where it should and it doesn ' t pull_through the torso , &quot; she said . Cinema Paradiso As usual , Giorgio Armani ' s show of fall clothing Wednesday in Milan was one part high_fashion , one part Hollywood . Robert De Niro flew in from London . Actress Jeanne Tripplehorn made the trip from the States with fiance Ben Stiller ( &quot; Reality Bites &quot; ) . Sophia Loren came all_the way from Rome . Armani ' s show and post-show dinner_party marked the designer ' s 20th anniversary in the business , and the event was celebrated accordingly : All 500 seats in the designer ' s fashion theater were re-covered in red velvet , and his Peter Marino-designed apartment was swathed in Moroccan fabric for the night . that ' s kind of the effect we were going_for when we Super Glued our beloved leopard-print chiffon scarf to an old lampshade . Portrait of the Artist With a Four-in-Hand Ties and scarves silk-screened with images from Picasso paintings are proving to be as popular as the exhibit -- &quot; Picasso and the Weeping Women &quot; -- that spawned them . As a rule , says a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Museum of Art , the museum gift_shop doesn ' t carry clothing . But the $ 35 ties and $ 55 scarves have been so coveted by visitors to the popular exhibition that perhaps a new tradition may be born . Fashion Perpetrators London isn ' t talking_about fashion victims anymore -- they ' re more interested in fashion criminals . Or at least the new denim collection that inmates of Full Sutton prison near York launched last week . The Keyhole Clothing Project is being backed by the Red or Dead clothing line , whose founders were impressed by the workmanship of the women ' s jeans , jackets and skirts made in denim . Profits from the line , made entirely by the prison staff and inmates , will go directly back to the project . Red or Dead has plans to take the collection to Paris , New York and Los Angeles . Inside Out is published Fridays .</TEXT>
