   <HEADLINE> WASHINGTON IS BEST CHANCE FOR PEACE IN MIDDLE_EAST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the face of extremist violence and undisciplined international diplomacy following the Hebron massacre , President Bill_Clinton should be commended for his low-key efforts to advance peace talks in the Middle_East by resisting pressure to negotiate on behalf of Palestinians . His diplomatic strategy seeks to achieve two fundamental and related goals : to work closely with Israelis and the Palestine Liberation Organization to implement their declaration of principles at the earliest possible date , and to reinvigorate Syrian-Israeli negotiations . Israelis and Palestinians must regain their confidence in each other ' s desire to make_peace in_order for the U.S. strategy to succeed . To rebuild Israeli confidence , the PLO must live_up_to the commitments it made last September when it accepted the Declaration of Principles . It must exercise leadership in the occupied territories to reduce the violence against Israelis and other Palestinians . However much the PLO might now want to deviate from the agreed-on principles to gain political advantage , this would only undermine Yitzhak Rabin ' s negotiating mandate . External pressures on Jerusalem would force the prime_minister , for domestic political reasons , to adopt a less conciliatory posture to avoid the appearance of weakness . It is equally important to rebuild Palestinian confidence , as well as Yasser Arafat ' s political strength , by beginning Palestinian self-rule in the Gaza Strip and Jericho . This will enhance security and transform the psychology of the Palestinian people , which will help propel the process forward . Once these confidence-building steps are taken , U.S. diplomacy can steer Israeli-Palestinian negotiations toward resolving those issues that threaten to block implementation of the principles by the April 13 deadline . Though it may prove difficult to achieve full implementation by this date , it is important that the negotiating be completed and the process well under way . How two symbolic issues were being negotiated before the Hebron massacre gives a flavor of how formal talks could proceed once resumed . Israelis worry that the uncontrolled movement of people and goods across the Allenby Bridge , which links the West_Bank to Jordan , could threaten their security or economy . The Palestinians argue that some control over such movement would demonstrate they were taking_charge of their lives . To resolve this issue , negotiators were close to agreeing on a formula that would place a modest Palestinian presence on this and other bridges and at border-crossings . Another nearly resolved symbolic issue with practical implications is the size of the Jericho district the Palestinians would control . As a result of Clinton ' s prodding , both parties had moved toward a compromise that would leave more land under Palestinian control than Israel had hoped to cede . In the end , Rabin and Arafat will have to sign_off on any agreement . Security issues will remain the most vexing problem . Although agreement had been reached on the establishment of a 10 # 000-man Palestinian police_force in Jericho and Gaza , its command structure , liaison arrangements and responsibility for protecting Israelis , as well as Palestinians , were still to be negotiated . To restart formal negotiations , a change in Israeli policy on Hebron is crucial . A number of Jerusalem ' s proposals to restore civil_order in the West_Bank city are being discussed in Tunis and Cairo . Among them are the establishment of a municipal Palestinian police_force and joint Israeli-Palestinian patrols . But despite the best of intentions , outside intervention cannot resolve these issues . Although pressure on Israel to accept a Bosnia-like international force to protect Palestinians continues , Washington opposes the idea . Israel has agreed to a temporary presence of lightly armed international observers , which would enhance security and bolster the confidence of Palestinians . Talks are under way to determine who should be invited , how many , and what would be their mission . More difficult for Rabin is what to do about the settlers in Hebron . Outlawing extremist settler groups was a necessary first_step . But more decisive actions are required . Rabin has asserted that imposing a curfew on 110 # 000 Arabs to protect 450 Israelis has produced violence and civil unrest , not stability . Accordingly , the Israeli prime_minister is trying to build domestic support for the more drastic measure of removing the settlers . A pledge from him to do so down the road may satisfy Arafat ' s need for an Israeli concession on this issue . The second goal of U.S. diplomacy -- promoting negotiations between Israel and its other Arab negotiating partners , most notably Syria -- also must clear many diplomatic hurdles . Following the Declaration of Principles , Rabin told Clinton that the Israeli public could not accommodate the psychological strains that parallel negotiations with Syria over the Golan Heights would produce . But during his meeting with Clinton on March 15 , Rabin signaled that he is now ready to engage in serious negotiations with the Syrians . U.S. diplomats have passed along Rabin ' s remarks to their Syrian counterparts . During their recent meeting , Syrian President Hafez Assad went_a_long_way toward persuading Clinton that his country is ready to negotiate and conclude a full treaty with Israel . But Assad ' s continuing acquiescence to Hezbollah ' s attacks against Israeli positions in southern Lebanon raises questions about Syria ' s true intentions . The United States is trying to persuade Damascus that its statements and behavior are key to creating a political atmosphere in Israel supportive of a trade of land for peace in the Golan Heights . If implementation of the Declaration of Principles helps restore stability and calm in the occupied territories , Israel ' s propensity for risk-taking in negotiations with Syria will increase . Conversely , failure could easily lead to the fall of the Israeli government . In such circumstances , the only winners would be the opponents of peace . To avoid this outcome , Washington must work to preserve the process that began in Madrid and lead the parties back to the negotiating table . This policy , which Clinton is pursuing , offers the best hope for achieving a lasting resolution of the Arab-Israel conflict. *</TEXT>
