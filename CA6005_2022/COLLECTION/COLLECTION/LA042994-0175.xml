   <HEADLINE> AUDITS URGED TO FIND MEXICAN PUPILS ILLEGALLY IN U.S. SCHOOLS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A bipartisan group of lawmakers from San Diego on Thursday urged Controller Gray Davis to conduct an audit to determine how many children who live_in Mexico might be crossing the border to attend school in California . Davis , in an audit completed late last year , found widespread irregularities in the attendance procedures of one border school district , but then declined to review attendance records at seven other border-area districts . Republicans have critized Davis , a Democrat running_for lieutenant_governor , for failing to follow_through . Now 12 legislators who represent parts of San Diego County -- six Republicans , five Democrats and an independent -- have signed a letter urging Davis to go_forward . &quot; The affected school districts have had every opportunity to be aware of their responsibility to establish proper procedures for verifying residency , &quot; the lawmakers wrote . &quot; The taxpayers have every right to be assured that their money is being properly spent. &quot; The issue is separate from the controversy over illegal immigrants attending school in California . Those immigrants , whether they have legal_status or not , are entitled to public education under a U.S. Supreme Court decision because they are residents of the state . The students at_issue in this case live_in Mexico and cross the border every morning to go_to school , then return home at night . Many may be U.S. citizens whose parents moved south of the border because they could not find affordable housing in the United States . Whether or not they are citizens , however , they are not entitled to an education unless they reside in the school district . Although long whispered about in education circles along the border , the practice was exposed last fall by Republican Assemblyman Jan Goldsmith of Poway , who released a videotape showing a Mountain Empire School District bus picking_up students at the border for trips to school . A controller ' s audit of that district found that hundreds of students were enrolled without providing proper documentation that they were residents of the district . In one case , several students listed a vacant_lot as their home . Others used post_office box numbers , which state regulations say are unacceptable proof of residency . In December , Davis sent letters notifying seven more districts that they would be subject_to similar audits . But the audits were never done . Now Davis says the letters were sent by mistake . Davis said in an interview that his office could not afford the $ 500 # 000 the additional audits would cost . He said he is obligated to conduct audits for the federal_government and to complete other audits that could result in savings of $ 30 million for the state Medi-Cal program . Davis said he hopes to do one or two additional border school district audits in the next fiscal_year , which begins July 1 , to confirm the findings from the Mountain Empire district . If the Legislature gives him the money he needs to do all_the audits , he said , &quot; we ' ll do them in a heartbeat. &quot; Claudia Smith , a lawyer for California Rural Legal Assistance , said her group interviewed the families involved in the Mountain Empire controversy and found that 90 % of the children who were crossing the border said they were U.S. citizens . She said the controller ' s audit was flawed and led to the harassment of some Latino students who were eligible to attend school . &quot; It ' s very , very worrisome , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
