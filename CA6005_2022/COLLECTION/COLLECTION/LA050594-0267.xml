   <HEADLINE> THE FRENCH HAD A NAME FOR IT : FILM NOIR ; MOVIES : ' DARKNESS , DESPAIR , DECEIT AND ICE IN THE VEINS ' ARE_ON DISPLAY IN A UCLA SERIES SHOWCASING LITTLE-SEEN GALLIC GEMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Though the title may be questionable , the films definitely are not . &quot; French Film Noir , &quot; the tasty but misnamed UCLA Film and Television Archive series opening tonight at Melnitz Theater , offers a rare chance to see some exceptional work by directors whose underappreciated films are almost never available for American viewing . And given that an accurate title , something like &quot; Terrific Films by Directors You ' ve Barely Heard of , &quot; doesn ' t exactly have the marquee value of &quot; French Film Noir , &quot; we can forgive the fact that some of these can be considered dark , fatalistic noirs only by the broadest definition of that admittedly elastic term . And though the noir genre is as intrinsically American as the Western , it ' s indisputable that the_French , who after all first recognized and named it , have a certain genius for what the program notes call &quot; darkness , despair , deceit and basic ice in the veins. &quot; Even the most humanistic of French directors , Jean Renoir , could walk down that road , as he did_in &quot; La Chienne &quot; ( screening Tuesday ) . Renoir ' s first sound_film and , dating_from 1931 , the oldest in the series , &quot; La Chienne &quot; stars the great Michel Simon as a mercilessly henpecked clerk who falls hopelessly in_love with a duplicitous prostitute , aggravating her ruthless pimp . Remade as &quot; Scarlet Street &quot; by Fritz Lang and Edward G . Robinson , &quot; La Chienne &quot; is enlarged by Simon ' s delicate performance as the archetypal timid soul , one of the most memorable fools in_love ever put_on film . But if Renoir is well-known , the four directors who give this series most of its excitement are not as celebrated in this country . Between them , Henri-Georges Clouzot ( whose &quot; L ' Assassin Habite au 21 &quot; plays with &quot; La Chienne &quot; ) , Jacques Becker , Jean-Pierre Melville and Georges Franju have five films in the eight-film series , and each is as entertaining as it is largely unseen . Clouzot ' s masterful &quot; The Raven &quot; opens the series tonight , playing with Bertrand Blier ' s absurdist 1979 &quot; Buffet Froid. &quot; Characterized by French critic Georges Sadoul as a filmmaker known for &quot; pessimism and the taste for neurotic passions , &quot; Clouzot is sometimes called France ' s answer to Alfred Hitchcock , a Gallic master of suspense most remembered for the classics &quot; The Wages of Fear &quot; and &quot; Les Diaboliques. &quot; Only his second film , the deliciously misanthropic 1943 &quot; Raven &quot; is breathtaking in its scabrous portrayal of the depths of human nature . A small French town is flooded by anonymous letters , signed &quot; The Raven , &quot; which spitefully spread discord and bring_on what one character calls &quot; a whirlwind of hate and calumny. &quot; And the worst of it is , almost everyone in town is a potential suspect for this awful deed . Made during the German occupation and advertised in the rest of Europe as &quot; a typical small French town , &quot; &quot; The Raven &quot; was promptly denounced by the Resistance as detrimental to national morale . After Liberation , the film was banned for a time , the death_penalty was suggested for its key personnel and , despite support by the_likes_of Jean-Paul Sartre , Clouzot was unable to direct again for four years . It ' s that nasty a piece of business . * Closest to American film noirs are the gangster films of Becker and Melville . And the Saturday-night double bill of the former ' s &quot; Touchez Pas au Grisbi &quot; and the latter ' s &quot; Le Doulos &quot; is the most satisfying program of the series . A former assistant to Jean Renoir , who was one of the few traditional French directors the iconoclastic New Wave filmmakers admired , Becker ' s Simone Signoret-starring masterpiece &quot; Casque D ' Or &quot; is so well-loved in France that they put it on a stamp . &quot; Grisbi , &quot; an underworld slang word meaning loot , follows a world-weary gangster ( its the only kind they have in France ) as he tries to balance the demands of loyalty to his pals with his interest in millions of dollars of stolen gold . Played with peerless sang froid by French superstar Jean Gabin , who can make Robert Mitchum seem expressive , &quot; Grisbi &quot; deals with a near-mythical French world of chic cabarets and elaborate wrought-iron elevators . It also stars a young , dark-haired Jeanne Moreau , whose scenes with Gabin have a fine passing-the-torch quality to them . If Becker was a filmmaker the New Wave favored , Melville , whose one-man operation served as a kind of role_model , was so well-liked he appeared as a celebrated director in Godard ' s &quot; Breathless. &quot; An admirer of all things American ( his last_name is not his own ) , Melville is_best known for &quot; Bob Le Flambeur &quot; and a trio of mythological gangster films starting with &quot; Le Doulos , &quot; and followed by &quot; Le Deuxieme Souffle &quot; and the knockout &quot; Le Samourai. &quot; Starring Jean-Paul Belmondo in hat , trench_coat and a cloud of cigarette smoke , &quot; Doulous &quot; is a tale of greed and revenge crawling with double and triple-crosses and assorted hard guys . Told in Melville ' s trademark cool , laconic manner , it is stylish and fatalistic in a way even the classic American noirs would have trouble matching . Georges Franju ' s marvelous &quot; Judex &quot; ( showing Sunday with Jean Gremillon ' s &quot; L ' Estrange Monsieur Victor &quot; ) belongs_to another tradition entirely . A tribute to and , in fact , a remake of Louis Feuillade ' s inventive 1914 super-hero serial by a director whose credo was &quot; what pleases is what is terrible , gentle and poetic , &quot; &quot; Judex &quot; is surreal , romantic and sweetly disturbing . Like many of the other films in this captivating series , it will make you wonder how you ' ve survived so_long without it . * Screenings are at 7:30 tonight , Saturday and Tuesday , at 7 p.m. Sunday . Admission is $ 5 , $ 3 for students and seniors . Parking , $ 5 . Information : ( 310 ) 206-FILM or ( 310 ) 206-8013 .</TEXT>
