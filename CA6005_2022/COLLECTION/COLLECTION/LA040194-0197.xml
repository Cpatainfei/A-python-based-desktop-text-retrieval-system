   <HEADLINE> GENE THERAPY USED ON CHOLESTEROL DISORDER ; MEDICINE : THE TREATMENT HAS SLOWED THE PROGRESSION OF HEART_DISEASE IN A WOMAN WITH A RARE MALADY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gene therapy has dramatically slowed the progression of heart_disease in a woman with a severe inherited cholesterol disorder , and surgeons have already applied the technique to four other victims of the disorder , Pennsylvania researchers said Thursday . Although the 30-year-old woman still has dangerously high cholesterol , the gene therapy probably will prolong her life , perhaps by years , said Dr. James Wilson of the University of Pennsylvania . &quot; I feel much better in the sense that I can do more physical activities now , such_as skiing and dancing . I was limited before , &quot; the seamstress and part-time bank teller from Quebec_City , Canada , said Thursday . The woman , who insisted on anonymity , has a severe form of a disease called familial hypercholesterolemia , in which the liver lacks the gene to produce a normally functioning protein that removes cholesterol from the blood . About one in a_million people lack the gene . Because of the disorder , cholesterol clogs the arteries of victims , most of whom die in their teens . The Quebec_City woman had a heart_attack at age 16 and underwent a coronary_artery bypass graft at age 26 . Wilson ' s team surgically removed about 15 % of the woman ' s liver . In the laboratory , they used viruses to shuttle copies of the missing gene into liver cells . About one-fifth of the cells took_up the gene . The corrected cells were then put_back into the woman ' s liver . &quot; I had nothing to lose , &quot; the woman said of the experimental treatment , whose results are reported today in the journal Nature Genetics . In addition to helping the woman ' s liver clear cholesterol from her blood , the gene therapy also made her more sensitive to the beneficial effects of a cholesterol-lowering drug called lovastatin , thereby increasing the overall efficacy of the procedure , Wilson said .</TEXT>
