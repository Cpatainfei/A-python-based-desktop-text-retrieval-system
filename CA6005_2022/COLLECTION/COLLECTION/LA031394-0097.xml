   <TEXT> She Could Not Go_Back To The Way She Was . Breast_Cancer Had Changed Her Life For Ever . Now She Knew How Little Control She Had Over Her Life . -- Hollis Sigler , artist , 1993 Hollis Sigler has not let her battle with breast_cancer diminish her creativity . To the contrary : After the Chicago artist was first diagnosed with the disease about eight years ago , her paintings began to directly address breast_cancer . &quot; She makes these really strong , not just political but emotional statements . They are real personal , &quot; said Marian Winsryg , an adjunct art professor at Santa Monica College and a friend of Sigler ' s for almost 20 years -- ever since Sigler was her student at Moore College of Art in Philadelphia . After seeing Sigler ' s work , Winsryg began thinking_about organizing an art show on the subject of breast_cancer . The clincher , she says , came when she learned that two other artist friends , Susan E . King and Barbara Foster , also had the disease . The result is &quot; One in Eight : Women and Breast_Cancer , &quot; an exhibit by 12 artists who have had breast_cancer . The show opens Friday at the Santa Monica College Art_Gallery , with a reception from 6 to 8 p.m. The &quot; One in Eight &quot; in the exhibit ' s title refers to an estimate that one in eight American women will get breast_cancer in their lifetimes . &quot; Nobody wants to deal with illness , &quot; Winsryg said . &quot; Half the reason women die of breast_cancer is because nobody talks_about it . Not that a mammogram or breast self-exam is going_to save you , but they alert you . And like any disease , the earlier it ' s caught , the better chance you have for a longer life. &quot; The art exhibit has been organized in conjunction with two free panel_discussions on the subject on Friday . Among the speakers are renowned breast_cancer expert Dr. Susan Love ; P.J. Viviansayles , a breast_cancer survivor and coordinator of the Women of Color Breast_Cancer Survivors Support Project ; Esther Dreifuss-Kattan , author of &quot; Cancer Stories : Creativity and Self Repair &quot; , and artists Sigler and King . * &quot; I didn ' t want to just do a show of women who have breast_cancer and leave it at that , &quot; said Winsryg , 53 , who has not had the disease . &quot; I didn ' t want it to be just political , but to make_it useful . It got real exciting to think_about a dialogue with different health practitioners talking_about their fields of expertise. &quot; Not all_of the work by the ethnically diverse group of artists in the show deals directly with breast_cancer . Bonnie Frankel presents completely abstract paintings . Della Rossa has contributed photographs of young Latino gang members . But artists who have confronted the disease head-on in their art have found the effort essential and rewarding . &quot; I was compelled to do this work for myself and for other people , too , &quot; said Lavialle Campbell , 40 , who had a mastectomy six years ago and went_through chemotherapy . Among her works_on view is the assemblage , &quot; Left Breast , No Nipple , &quot; which displays her old breast prosthesis on a saw blade on black velvet . &quot; I lost friends . I don ' t know if it was because I had cancer or ( specifically ) breast_cancer . One friend , when she found_out I had breast_cancer , she completely cut me off , &quot; she said . King was diagnosed in 1989 as having breast_cancer . &quot; I went_in for a mammogram , and it just started me on this whole medical odyssey , &quot; said King , 46 , who had a partial mastectomy and radiation treatment . King ' s &quot; Treading the Maze : An Artist ' s Book of Daze , &quot; intertwines images and text of a European trip and her medical ordeal . * The images include a photo of a statue of Hebe , the cup bearer of the Gods who was connected to the Tree of Life ; a photograph of the rose window at Chartres Cathedral in France ; a sketch of a similarly patterned array of lasers on a radiation room wall , and a doctor ' s drawing of invasive cancer . Campbell said that in some respects , having breast_cancer was a positive experience . &quot; As bad as it was , it ' s one of the best things that happened to me , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' ve always had a lot of feelings that I didn ' t deal with . Now , I live the way I want to live. &quot; Said Della Rossa , who had a mastectomy at 60 and is now 73 : &quot; I ' ve survived breast_cancer and gone_on with my life. &quot; Other artists in the show are Vida Hackman , Rosalyn Mesquita , Keiko Nelson , Betsy Noorzay , Annabelle Simon Cahn and Ruth Weisberg . &quot; One in Eight : Women and Breast_Cancer &quot; opens tomorrow with a reception from 6 to 8 p.m. at Santa Monica College Art_Gallery , 1900 Pico Blvd. , Santa Monica . Panel_discussions in the Concert_Hall will take_place from 9:30 to 11:30 a.m. and 1 to 4 p.m. Reception and panel_discussions are free and open_to the public .
