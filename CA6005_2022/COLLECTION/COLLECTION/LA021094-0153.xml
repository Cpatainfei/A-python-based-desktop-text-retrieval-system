   <TEXT> &quot; Bare stomachs , bare arms and unnecessarily bare skin. &quot; What about them ? They &quot; will not be permitted &quot; in Olympic figure_skating , one of the judges said Wednesday . Sigrun Morkeseth , a skating judge from Norway , said rules have been tightened , and competitors can lose points if judges consider their costumes to be indecent . Female skaters must always wear skirts , and no fringes on costumes will be tolerated . Although Morkeseth singled_out no individual , German skater Katarina Witt ' s costumes have been criticized by some as unduly provocative . Also , Tonya Harding ' s costume at the recent U.S. Championships was sleeveless , bare in front from armpit to armpit and exposed in a deep V almost to the waist . Although she won the competition , published reports claimed that Harding ' s scores were lowered by certain judges because of her costume . * First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is scheduled to arrive Friday in Oslo , then attend Saturday ' s opening ceremony here along with other American luminaries , among them former Olympic gold medalist sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner . According to Greg Crouch , press attache from the U.S. Embassy in Oslo , the First_Lady has not yet decided which events she will attend . He said Mrs . Clinton has expressed interest in speedskating and Sunday ' s men ' s downhill , and he expects her to attend the hockey_game between the United States and France . MIKE DOWNEY</TEXT>
