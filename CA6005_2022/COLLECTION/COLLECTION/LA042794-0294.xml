   <HEADLINE> RICHARD NIXON : 1913-1994 ; THE BOOK ON NIXON : NO BIOGRAPHER HAS HAD THE LAST WORD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Richard Nixon decided to have a secret recording_system installed in the White_House , he figured the tapes of important meetings would prove invaluable in preparing books he might write after leaving_office . &quot; From the beginning , &quot; Nixon wrote in his memoirs , &quot; I had decided that my Administration would be the best chronicled in history. &quot; But the now-infamous tapes , which helped lead to his downfall , wound_up providing more of a presidential chronicle than he bargained for . The man one historian describes as being &quot; heroic , admiring and inspiring while simultaneously being dishonorable , despicable and a horrible example , &quot; ranks as the third most-written-about American President -- behind Abraham_Lincoln and Franklin_Roosevelt . From Theodore H . White ' s &quot; The Making of the President , 1960 &quot; to Roger Morris ' &quot; The Rise of an American Politician &quot; to Stephen E . Ambrose ' s three-volume biography , &quot; Nixon , &quot; the 37th President of the United States has been the subject of scores of biographies and historical volumes . USC political_science professor William Lammers says there are about 120 books on Nixon and his political life in the university library alone . But while Nixon ' s role in opening relations with China , detente with the Soviet_Union and ending the Vietnam_War assured his place in history , it is the drama of Watergate and his subsequent resignation to avoid impeachment that opened the floodgates on Nixon books . Says former CBS diplomatic correspondent Marvin Kalb , who covered Nixon and is now director of a press-politics center at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard_University : &quot; All Presidents generate biographies -- even Herbert Hoover . But Nixon ' s capacity to generate copy . . . relates primarily to Watergate and then . . . to a number of diplomatic initiatives toward China and Russia. &quot; Ambrose , Lammers , Kalb and several other historians and political_scientists recommend the following books for those who want to learn more about Richard Nixon : The Memoirs Start with the Nixon memoirs , suggests Ambrose , referring to &quot; RN : The Memoirs of Richard Nixon ( Grosset &amp; Dunlap , 1978 ) , the 1 # 120-page opus Nixon wrote while in exile in San Clemente . &quot; It absolutely is the place to start . . . and he makes the best case for himself that can be made in_regard_to the Watergate . Nixon , of course , basically claims innocence. &quot; In a book Nixon wrote 12 years later , &quot; In the Arena : A Memoir of Victory , Defeat and Renewal &quot; ( Simon and Schuster , 1990 ) , Ambrose said Nixon also claimed he had nothing to do with any payoffs to the Watergate burglars . &quot; I point_out in my third volume that . . . ( in ) the tape of his meeting with ( White_House counsel ) John Dean , Nixon orders Dean to see_to_it that the money -- $ 160 # 000 -- would be gotten_to the burglars as hush_money and it be done_by the morning , and it was . He ( Nixon ) just lies . . . &quot; Watergate Titles Other Watergate titles include Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein ' s &quot; All the President ' s Men &quot; ( Simon and Schuster , 1974 ) and &quot; The Final Days &quot; ( Simon and Schuster , 1976 ) , &quot; Breach of Faith : The Fall of Richard Nixon &quot; by Theodore H . White ( Atheneum , 1975 ) , and &quot; Silent Coup : The Removal of a President &quot; by Len Colodny and Robert Gettlin ( St . Martin ' s Press , 1991 ) . Many of the key Watergate figures also wrote books : H . R . Haldeman ' s &quot; The Ends of Power &quot; ( Hall , 1978 ) , John Dean ' s &quot; Blind Ambition &quot; ( Simon and Schuster , 1976 ) , John Ehrlichman ' s &quot; Witness to Power &quot; ( Simon and Schuster , 1982 ) . Recommendations Lammers : &quot; One of Us &quot; by Tom Wicker ( Random House , 1991 ) : &quot; It represents , to some extent , a more favorable view of Nixon than you would have expected , given Wicker ' s long history of supporting generally Democratic causes. &quot; &quot; The Nixon Presidency : Power and Politics in Turbulent Times &quot; ( Greenwood Press , 1990 ) : &quot; a fairly scholarly book by Michael Genovese . It ' s substantially about ( Nixon ' s ) time in power and not so_much his early political career. &quot; Kalb : &quot; Richard Milhous Nixon : The Rise of an American Politician &quot; by Roger Morris ( Holt , 1990 ) : &quot; It ' s an excellent book -- the richness of detail and of scholarship ; it ' s just beautifully written . And in class I still go_back to ' The Final Days. ' I think that is about as good a book as you can get written in the heat of the moment and ( on ) a subject like Watergate. &quot; James Schmidt , professor of political_science and sociology at Boston University : &quot; Nixon Agonistes : The Crisis of the Self-Made Man &quot; by Garry Wills ( Houghton Mifflin , 1969 ) : &quot; It ' s still the one to read , as it were . It ' s not a scholarly biography like Ambrose ' s volumes , but it attempts to talk_about Nixon in the context of American liberalism , and he uses Nixon to talk_about the tensions in America as a liberal society. &quot; Jonathan Schell ' s &quot; The Time of Illusion &quot; ( Vintage , 1975 ) : &quot; It does the best job of tying together the Watergate period with the secret war in Vietnam. &quot; Joan Hoff-Wilson , a professor of history at Indiana University : &quot; Richard Nixon and His America &quot; by Herbert Parmet ( Little Brown , 1990 ) and Wicker ' s &quot; One of Us &quot; : &quot; Both of these books . . . attempt to place his life and career within the context of American culture by showing he was a normal American and not the aberration that Watergate made many people think he was. &quot; &quot; Nightmare : The Underside of the Nixon Years &quot; by J . Anthony Lukas ( Viking Press , 1976 ) : &quot; An early good study of Watergate . that ' s the best account of Watergate that exists , contrary to the fact that everybody cites Woodward and Bernstein . Lukas is a superb example of investigative reporting done at the time. &quot; * More books will undoubtedly be written_about Nixon . Kalb , in fact , just turned_in the manuscript for his own Nixon book , &quot; The Nixon Memo. &quot; The book , to be published by the University of Chicago Press in October , was prompted by a 1992 &quot; private &quot; memo Nixon circulated in Washington criticizing what he termed then-President George_Bush ' s &quot; penny_ante &quot; approach to sending financial_aid to Russia . Kalb says Nixon sent the memo , knowing it &quot; would galvanize the press to apply pressure on the government &quot; to affect U.S. public policy regarding Russian aid . Another book is_due out from Basic Books in May . &quot; Nixon Reconsidered &quot; by Hoff-Wilson , who says that &quot; unlike all_the other books about him , and unlike these eulogies we ' re currently hearing , his foreign_policy turned_out to be much weaker than conventional wisdom suggests. &quot; Even Nixon will have his 10th volume published posthumously next month . In &quot; Beyond Peace &quot; ( Random House ) , he analyzes America ' s &quot; urgent foreign and domestic issues &quot; and offers his proposal for &quot; the renewal of our national purpose. &quot;</TEXT>
