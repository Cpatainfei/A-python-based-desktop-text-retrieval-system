   <HEADLINE> COUNTERPUNCH : ' RAPA NUI ' MISUSES ITS LITERARY LICENSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In his recent review of Kevin Reynold ' s unfortunate film &quot; Rapa Nui , &quot; critic Kenneth Turan is rightfully amused by the &quot; goofy &quot; dialogue and &quot; giddy South_Seas &quot; fantasy quality of this &quot; throwback to Cinemascope epics of a simpler time &quot; ( &quot; ' Rapa Nui ' Presents a Fantasy Island of a Simpler Past , &quot; Calendar , Sept . 9 ) . The extremely small audience of which I was part hooted and jeered , not only at the cliched dialogue but at the transparently phony melodrama . In fact , I thought New Zealand actor Eru Potaka-Dewes as the silly ariki mau was hilariously funny , and some of his scenes with George Henare ( the evil priest ) approached the unintended level of Three Stooges comedy . I concur with Turan in his negative view of the film , but write to take_issue with him on two points . First , I think his willingness to view some of the footage as &quot; good fun in a Saturday-matinee way &quot; is generous but inappropriate and uniformed . The footage he is most impressed with portrays the ancient tangata manu or &quot; birdman &quot; rite . This profoundly sacred ritual ordeal is totally misread by director-writer Reynolds , who treats it as a crassly undertaken , viciously competitive &quot; ironman &quot; contest . While dramatic and daringly filmed , this ridiculous sequence betrays a profound ignorance of Polynesian ritual and Rapa Nui belief . Second , Turan fails to note the pseudo-documentary disguise this film wears . At the beginning we are told , in a voice-over thick_with dramatic import , of the Polynesian settlement of Rapa Nui . At the end , a tagline states unequivocally that &quot; archeological evidence &quot; proves that Pitcairn , lying some 1 # 400 kilometers westward , was settled from Rapa Nui . This is a patent falsehood that cannot go unchallenged . * Pitcarin Island was once inhabited and then abandoned by Polynesians , as were several other Pacific islands . There is virtually no hard evidence of any kind to demonstrate that Pitcairn or any other East Polynesian island was settled from Rapa Nui . While we may rationalize away , if we choose , the &quot; artistic license &quot; this film ' s creators have taken with Rapa Nui history ( &quot; Does ' Rapa Nui ' Take Artistic License Too Far ? , &quot; Calendar , Aug . 26 ) , such deliberate distortion of scientific fact ( or ignorance of its existence ) is totally indefensible . Much ink has been spilled in the concerned scientific community about this film ' s huge negative impact on the island ' s natural and cultural environment . In some ways , all_of the turmoil would have been bearable if a good film had resulted , a film that did_justice to the sacrifices made and gave honor to the past . Rapa Nui , which is an especially artistic culture , had a right to expect more . Rapa Nui has always inspired artists , writers , adventurers and scientists . Thor Heyerdahl sailed the Kon-Tiki on a wave of publicity into the imagination of two generations of travelers . No less a talent than Robert Frost wrote a poem about one of the monolithic statues . But the island , because of its incredible megalithic accomplishments and dramatic isolation , also has been the reluctant center of fantastic speculation , bad research and pseudoscience . This film not only contains most of the discredited and discarded myths once advanced about the island , but some of the newer unreasonable and unproven speculations as well . It is but the latest in a long and lamentable history of drivel written_about Rapa Nui .</TEXT>
