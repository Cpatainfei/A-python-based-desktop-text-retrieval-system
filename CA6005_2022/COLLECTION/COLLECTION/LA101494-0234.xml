   <HEADLINE> A VOICE OF POSTWAR JAPAN WINS NOBEL FOR LITERATURE ; ASIA : KENZABURO OE ' S PROSE MARKS A DEPARTURE FROM TRADITIONAL AESTHETICS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Kenzaburo Oe , a Japanese enfant_terrible who gave voice to a generation set adrift by the destruction of their values and dreams after World_War_II , won the Nobel Prize for literature , the Swedish Academy announced Thursday in Stockholm . Oe , 59 , whose fiction is staunchly modern in both style and substance , marks a clear break from Japan ' s traditional aesthetics , represented by such celebrated writers as Yasunari Kawabata . The nation ' s only other Nobel laureate in literature , Kawabata won the award in 1968 for such masterpieces as &quot; Snow Country &quot; and &quot; The Izu Dancer &quot; and has defined Japanese literature to the rest of the world for the last 25 years . Oe , however , infuses his prose with such Western techniques as long sentences dense with adjectives , shunning the delicate simplicity favored by Kawabata and others . He also rejects the elements of Zen mysticism and other trappings of ancient culture found in their works , instead tackling such contemporary topics as nuclear destruction and the cultural dislocation of postwar Japan . He has described his writing as a way of exorcising Japan ' s past . He is outspoken in his criticism against racism , Japan ' s military buildup and a national lack of responsibility in the world , especially toward Asia . &quot; Kawabata represented what came_to be packaged as Japanese tradition as exotic differences for a Western reading audience , &quot; said Norma Field , a University of Chicago professor of East Asian studies and author of the highly acclaimed &quot; In the Realm of the Dying Emperor. &quot; &quot; You don ' t have rice fields in Oe . You are able to begin thinking_of Japan and postwar society without the immediate baggage of Japanese aesthetics , the special relationship to nature and ancient traditions. &quot; Ian Hideo Levy , the first Westerner to write a novel in Japanese , who won the prestigious Noma Prize for New Writers last year , said Thursday ' s award marks a milestone in Western literary understanding of Japan . &quot; While Kawabata is great , it always struck me as a crime against Japan that the writer who was grappling with modern society was not recognized , &quot; he said . &quot; In a sense , this award signifies Western recognition of Japan as a modern culture for the first time. &quot; In announcing the prize , which carries a cash award of $ 930 # 000 , the Nobel committee hailed Oe ' s works for &quot; creating an imagined world where life and myth condense to form a disconcerting picture of the human predicament. &quot; The novelist , who has often said he writes not for the world but for his fellow Japanese , thanked his literary colleagues in brief remarks outside his home_in Tokyo ' s upscale Seijo section . &quot; I think the Nobel Prize committee appreciated the achievements of ( all ) Japanese writers , &quot; Oe said . Oe was born Jan . 31 , 1935 , in a village on the southern island of Shikoku as the third of seven children from a distinguished family . He received a degree in French literature at the University of Tokyo in 1959 . He burst onto Japan ' s literary scene in the late 1950s with a series of short_stories . Oe was the first Japanese writer to draw heavily on American literary traditions , in contrast to the European bias of most of his contemporaries , Levy said . His favorite American authors were those whose heroes search for &quot; personal freedom beyond the borders of safety and acceptance , &quot; according to his translator , John Nathan . His greatest inspiration has been Mark Twain ' s &quot; Huckleberry Finn. &quot; In 1958 , Oe was awarded the prestigious Akutagawa Prize for his novella &quot; The Catch , &quot; about the experiences of a Japanese boy with a black American pilot shot down and captured by villagers . The prize catapulted the then-23-year-old into fame as Japan ' s most important young writer . Two events in life most dramatically shaped him and his literature . The first was_on Aug . 15 , 1945 , when then-Emperor Hirohito -- whom Oe and his contemporaries regarded_as divine -- announced over the radio that Japan had surrendered to the Allies . &quot; How could we believe that an august presence of such awful power had become an ordinary human being_on a designated summer day ? &quot; Oe wrote plaintively in his &quot; Portrait of a Postwar Generation. &quot; The obliteration of his nation ' s values virtually overnight , as the Allied occupation firmly demystified and secularized the nation ' s supreme spiritual symbol , was to become a major theme of his work . Oe also became known as a staunch leftist , actively demonstrating against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty . His second transforming event was the birth in 1964 of a brain-damaged son , Hikari ( Light ) . The tragedy inspired him to write one of his best-known novels , the dark and poetic &quot; A Personal Matter , &quot; about a man faced with the existentialist choice of killing his deformed child to win his freedom . The book ' s protagonist gets fired from his job for drunkenness , takes a mistress and plots his child ' s death . Another important work , &quot; The Silent Cry , &quot; in 1967 , described the spiritual pilgrimage of two brothers back to their birthplace and the awareness they gain about their nation ' s wrenching social changes . Oe ' s career changed drastically after Hikari ' s birth . &quot; He began expressing what his brain-damaged son could not and began delving into the very private and primitive realm , &quot; Levy said . The works never regained his earlier originality and raw power , critics say . But his son turned_out to have musical talent as a composer ; he won a prize for it last year . Last month , Oe shocked the literary world by announcing he would give_up writing , since his son had found his own expression . But the Nobel laureate still plans to complete his final project , a three-volume novel titled &quot; A Green Tree in Flames. &quot; Amid Japan ' s current climate of &quot; impoverished &quot; social debate , as people steadily lose interest in literature , Field said she hopes the prize will inspire a new generation to rediscover Oe ' s works . &quot; I hope they will recover the sense of urgency Oe brought_to society with so_much three-dimensional vividness , &quot; she said . Selections From Oe Excerpts from the work of Kenzaburo Oe : * From the 1964 novel &quot; A Personal Matter , &quot; translated by John Nathan . They were watching the midnight news , Bird in bed on his stomach , lifting only his head like a baby sea_urchin , Himiko hugging her knees on the floor . The heat of day had departed and like primeval cave-dwellers they were enjoying the cool air in nakedness . Since they had turned the volume way down with the telephone_bell in mind , the only sound in the room was a voice as faint as the buzzing of a bee ' s wings . But what Bird heard was not a human voice endowed with meaning and mood , nor was he distinguishing meaningful shapes in the flickering shadows on the screen . From the external world he was letting_in nothing to project its image on the screen of his consciousness . He was simply waiting , like a radio_set equipped with a receiver only , for a signal from the distance , which he wasn ' t even certain would be transmitted . * * From the 1967 novel &quot; The Silent Cry , &quot; translated by John Bester : Even before the eye injury I was already showing more and more clearly a quality of ugliness that often reminded me how mother had prophesied that , when we grew_up , my brother would be handsome and I would not . The lost eye merely emphasized the ugliness each day , throwing it into constant relief . My born ugliness would have liked to hang_back , silent , in the shadows ; it was the missing eye that continually dragged it out into the limelight . Not that I neglected to assign a role to this eye : I saw it , its function lost , as being forever trained on the darkness within my skull , a darkness full of blood and somewhat above body heat .</TEXT>
