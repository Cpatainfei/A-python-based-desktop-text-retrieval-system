   <HEADLINE> HOMETOWN JINGLES ; BUY LOCALLY , STRAPPED O.C. CITIES SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This South County city will use a light_touch when its shop-near-home campaign debuts next month , but the message will be clear : Residents who buy their gas , groceries and holiday gifts in nearby cities are economic traitors . Shop-where-you-live campaigns historically have been little more_than thinly disguised chamber_of_commerce gambits designed to drum_up hometown support for local merchants during the important holiday shopping season . Even before the unprecedented bond crisis threatened to force service cuts at cash-strapped cities , municipal officials were embracing shop-where-you-live campaigns as a painless way to raise sales tax receipts to pay_for police , safety and recreation programs , among other services . &quot; It ' s critical now , &quot; said Mary Kluver , a banker and president of the Laguna Niguel Chamber_of_Commerce , which is sponsoring the shopping campaign . &quot; Nobody knows right now what the implications are ( of the bankruptcy debacle ) but this campaign is a way to put dollars into the city budget immediately. &quot; Local_governments view today ' s shop-near-home campaigns as a way to plug sales tax &quot; leakage &quot; -- when residents bypass hometown merchants in favor of out-of-town businesses . Leakage is most harmful during the holiday season , when the average retail operation rings_up 19 % of its annual sales . Laguna Niguel , for example , generates nearly $ 800 # 000 of its annual $ 3.8 million in revenue in the weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas . The efforts are increasingly attractive because , at a time when revenue sources are drying_up , shop-near-home programs promise increased municipal revenue at no additional cost to taxpayers . Several cities have implemented them : * Phoenix council_members responded to a four-year drop_in sales tax receipts by going_on television to remind residents that out-of-town holiday shopping trips result in less funding for police and fire services . * El Cajon used newspaper_advertisements that detailed how much each city department receives when a shopper dropped $ 100 at a local clothing_store . * Cupertino , Calif. , hopes to bolster sales tax receipts by routing any increase in excess of last year ' s total to a popular local library branch . * Laguna Niguel ' s upcoming shop-near-home campaign will tie its nearly $ 4-million sales tax receipts directly to cops on the beat . &quot; We ' re trying to let people know that , in Laguna Niguel . . . shops equal cops , &quot; City_Manager Tim Casey said . &quot; We ' re making a direct connection between sales tax_revenue as our most important General Fund revenue source and public safety. &quot; that ' s an easy case to make because Laguna Niguel ' s current sales tax receipts are equal_to the $ 3.8-million bill for police services provided by the Orange County Sheriff ' s Department . More_than 30 Sheriff ' s Department personnel work in Laguna Niguel , and about a dozen squad_cars patrol within the city ' s boundaries . The upcoming 13-week , shop-near-home campaign will tell the city ' s 54 # 100 residents that they can further improve the quality of their lives by shopping where they live . The campaign is being funded in part by a $ 35 # 000 city grant . But most of the $ 250 # 000 marketing and advertising_campaign will be paid_for by local businesses . It will include heavy newspaper , television and radio advertising as well as banners and a contest to draw consumers into participating stores . The campaign will begin after the holiday season , partly because Laguna Niguel lacks a major regional mall for holiday shoppers . And merchants agree that they could use help drumming_up business in the traditionally slow first_quarter . &quot; We wanted to do something that was above what every_other city seemed to be doing , &quot; said Laguna Niguel Chamber_of_Commerce President Mary Kluver , who is manager of the Monarch Beach branch of Mariners Bank . &quot; We didn ' t want some bumper sticker or slogan . We really want to make people aware that where they shop is important to their city. &quot; Five years ago , Laguna Niguel ' s affluent residents accounted_for about 2 % of Orange County ' s overall 2.6-million population -- but the city was collecting just 1 % of countywide tax receipts . Sales tax receipts were hurt by the fact that the relatively young community lacked stores , theaters and restaurants . But as Laguna Niguel added warehouse stores , major discounters and theaters , annual sales tax receipts rose to $ 3.8 million from $ 2 million . There ' s still plenty of room for improvement , though , because residents still are spending an estimated $ 400 million , according to a city estimate , on out-of-town goods and services . A recent poll showed that 70 % of Laguna Niguel residents said they would be willing to change their shopping habits if it would help maintain or improve safety services . City officials agreed , however , that it ' s still up_to hometown retailers to match the prices , quality and service available elsewhere . While city officials are eager to boost tax receipts , few shoppers seem to know where their taxes go . &quot; It ' s something I ' d never considered before , &quot; said Stacey Nunz , a 12-year Mission Viejo resident who has patronized many out-of-town shops . &quot; I used to just head_off to wherever it was convenient to shop. &quot; Nunz changed her shopping patterns after reading a letter that Mission Viejo ' s Economic Development Commission recently mailed to 80 # 000 households . The letter reminded residents that part of the sales tax levied on holiday gifts returns in the form of improved city services . &quot; Whether you purchase something as large as a car or as small as a teddy_bear , you can feel good knowing you are making our community an even better place to live , &quot; wrote Ben Meharg , chairman of Mission Viejo ' s Economic Development Commission . Meharg ' s letter sat well with Nunz . &quot; At first I thought , here ' s another piece of junk mail , but it turned_out to be one of the most intelligent , well-penned of letters , &quot; Nunz said . &quot; In effect , they were courteously reminding me to do something that will benefit me , my family and neighbors. &quot; Nunz was an easy sell , but marketing experts agree that it will take longer to change most shoppers ' habits . When Cupertino agreed earlier this year to use sales tax receipts to support a cash-strapped library , civic and business_leaders thought the campaign would have an immediate impact among residents . Sales during the first_quarter , the most recent data available , were generating less tax_revenue than a year ago , leading officials to acknowledge that it will take time to change people ' s patterns . &quot; We ' re realizing that shopping habits do not change overnight , &quot; said Greg Sellers , whose Cupertino-based marketing company helped design the campaign . &quot; The message we ' re getting is that it takes a lot longer for this kind of thing to sink in. &quot; While shop-near-home campaigns aren ' t a quick_fix , they ' re appealing tools for cash-strapped cities with few available alternatives to replace rapidly shrinking sources of federal and state funding . &quot; We ' re all trying to stem retail sales tax leakage , &quot; agreed John Statton , executive_director of the Cupertino Chamber_of_Commerce , which supported the use of sales tax receipts to help revitalize the local county library branch . Municipalities also are competing with each other for new retail development . &quot; We all want those sales tax dollars , &quot; Statton said of the prospect of new stores . Mission Viejo ' s sales tax receipts are expected to rise noticeably during the holiday season thanks to sales at Mission Viejo Freeway Center , a new shopping_center near Interstate 5 that ' s home to Comp USA , Borders Books and Music , and Toys R Us . &quot; Those retailers rushed to open their stores before Thanksgiving because they know so_much of their annual sales come during the Christmas season , &quot; Mission Viejo Deputy City Treasurer Josephine Julian said . &quot; Well , it ' s also very important to the city to have them open before Thanksgiving . We ' re already penciling in those anticipated revenues in the next budget. &quot; Mission Viejo credits an ongoing shop-near-home campaign for helping to boost sales tax receipts by 17 % to $ 7 million for the fiscal_year ended June 30 , up from $ 6 million a year earlier . Sales tax receipts account_for about a quarter of the city ' s $ 27-million operating_budget . Proposition 13 , a law that requires two-thirds vote_in a general_election to increase property_taxes , is pushing California municipalities to fight for_sales tax receipts , but other states are feeling the pinch as well . Phoenix cited slumping sales tax receipts last year when it abandoned a longstanding policy that prohibited the use of city tax dollars to provide financial incentives for retail redevelopment projects . But neighboring municipalities had already used aggressive subsidies to ring Phoenix with new , attractive shopping_malls . &quot; The irony in all_of this is that , the way the tax structure works , retail development doesn ' t increase the economic pie in the community as_a_whole the way , say , a manufacturing_plant does when it moves here from California , &quot; said Dave Krietor , director of the Phoenix Community and Economic Development Department . &quot; We ' re all forced to compete with each other for our parochial needs. &quot; It ' s a competition that continues long after the last holiday wreath is taken_down because consumers spend billions of dollars each year during daily shopping trips for milk , bread and gasoline . Those gallons of milk add_up , said Casey , who each year drafts a list of the top 20 sales tax generators in Laguna Niguel . The list &quot; really opens your eyes , &quot; Casey said . &quot; You ' ve got your real obvious ones , the HomeBase and ( Price Costco ) , but you ' ve also got gas_stations and drug stores , &quot; Casey said . &quot; It ' s the little things . . . . if you fill your gas_tank before you leave town , you can have a dramatic impact on your local tax base. &quot;</TEXT>
