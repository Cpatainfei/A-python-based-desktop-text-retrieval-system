   <HEADLINE> THIS SIDE OF HELL ; TRINITIES , BY NICK TOSCHES ( DOUBLEDAY : $ 23.95 ; 435 PP. ) ; CHINA WHITE , BY PETER MAAS ( SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER : $ 23 ; 270 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a recent Associated Press story ( picked_up in this newspaper ) on the threat to American cities from Asian organized crime , one federal prosecutor said : &quot; It ' s the worst of both worlds . They have an international_organization that gives them access to information and commodities throughout Asia -- and then they have local gangs. &quot; This is the threat addressed , fictionally , in these two accomplished thrillers . Both writers are seasoned reporters , authors of respected nonfiction works ( Maas ' &quot; King of the Gypsies , &quot; &quot; The Valachi Papers &quot; and &quot; Serpico &quot; ; Tosches ' &quot; Hellfire , &quot; the Jerry Lee Lewis biography , and &quot; Dino &quot; ) . Surely they ' ve been aware of each other , as they race toward the retail shelves ( and the cinemas , with both trumpeting their sale to major studios ) , with what might be seen as the same bucket of goods . On closer examination , however , the books are quite different ; Tosches has more rude energy and eloquence -- shading often into grandiloquence -- and a full-scale Mafia subplot . Maas ' steelier , serviceable prose goes_about its business with a nod to the Mafia he ' s cogently depicted in the past , then coasts through_with a by-the-numbers love_story and a predictable , screenplay structure . Tosches is in fact raking his way toward higher ground , toward something like Robert Stone ' s or Russell Banks ' incident-rich novels of moral quandary . With Tosches , it ' s a dark night of the soul , as he feverishly follows his reluctant Mafioso ; with Maas , it ' s a great night at Elaine ' s Restaurant , as he glibly displays the knack that ' s made him , as the jacket attests , &quot; author of many bestsellers. &quot; Each book ' s story ranges from New York to Asia . We begin Tosches ' book in the company of two anonymous hit_men in an East Harlem Italian joint , pull_back to the grumpily aging Mafia boss , Giuseppe &quot; Joe &quot; DiPietro , and , in the third chapter , meet his Chinese counterpart , the aging Chinatown junkie and gang boss Chen Fang . These quickly sketched portraits give_way to a scene at the Brooklyn home of our hero , Johnny DiPietro ( who turns_out to be one of the hit_men ) and his alienated wife Diane . This Johnny , who advises her to bring_home his usual video fare ( &quot; Tits . Blood . Monsters. &quot; ) is a far_cry from the story ' s later Johnny , who becomes almost Nabokovian is his complexities . Tosches takes Johnny there in small steps , with the hinge point being a pact with his Uncle Giuseppe . The aging don , sick_of seeing the Chinese infringe on his turf , has cooked_up a plan to usurp their drug profits . Such ambition is quixotic in the post- &quot; Godfather &quot; world the tattered Mafia hierarchy inhabits , but compelling . In the way Francis Ford Coppola ' s ambivalent Al Pacino ( or later , a zealous Andy Garcia ) had to take_over from the weaklings who ' d forgotten how to wield ice_picks and spread terror , Johnny takes_to the task , nonetheless fearing ( in Tosches ' overheated style ) that &quot; the reverberations of this baptism in evil would be inexorable , that no amount of wealth could bribe Charon to ferry him back from hell. &quot; Along Johnny ' s path , Drug Enforcement Special_Agent Bob Marshall , Nigerian smuggler Alhaji Shehu Musa , New York Chinese mobsters Billy Sing and scattered cameo players get embroiled in what becomes a war between the Mafia and the Chinese Triad gangs ; all but the most major players tend to get suckered and killed as the body_count colorfully rises . ( Marshall gets involved in a bit of sexual intrigue that would seem implausible had Tosches not prepared the ground so well , and rendered the moment so artfully. ) Along with a group of fine minor characters , what Tosches gives us with the extra space he takes is lots of story , and lots of details : how to cook squid , how to assassinate by acid , knife , gun , fire , bomb and virus ( and how to cover one ' s tracks ) , how to launder money through bearer_bonds , how to tell if your Thai wife is cheating ( &quot; Usually she will cut her hair and treat you better &quot; ) and -- in a description Maas also provides -- how to cook_up commercial quantities of the highly pure heroin ( No . 4 , or &quot; China White &quot; ) that is the lynch-pin of the Triads ' grasp for U.S. street territory . By bearing_down_on the resurgent Mafiosi in the person of Johnny , Tosches hovers comfortably between a good pulp fiction read and something nobler . Here ' s a typical musing from Johnny : &quot; The world itself seemed to be growing dimmer , more magical , more vibrant , but more ominous too , a region of unspeakable possibility , sorrow , fear and doleful shades , as in the haunted black_forest of a dream , disturbing and enchanting and fatal , in the blood. &quot; Yes , a William Kennedy or an E . L . Doctorow summons such things up with less perspiration , but Johnny sees ( and partakes of ) enough human beastliness to lend weight to such earnest underpinnings . These two authors may have been somewhat distressed to realize that each of their books , in nearing its climax , features twin cargo_ships heading for American ports . One of the quietly effective passages in Maas ' book is his enumeration of the container traffic in Port Newark -- 50 # 000 merchant_ships per year , a_million and a half steel containers , with just 1 % of them subject_to random inspection . Maas ' key figure is Hong Kong businessman and gang-lord Y . K . Deng , who fled mainland_China and Mao ' s murderous revolutionaries in 1949 , emerging in Hong Kong as a CIA informant and eventually as one of five &quot; dragon heads &quot; of the secret_societies : &quot; In the annals of organized_crime , the power of these five men was unparalleled . . . . Only a handful of officers at the highest echelon knew the identity of those seated around the teak table . . . . &quot; In fact , a consistently distracting element in both novels is the very mysteriousness of the Triads , who are center stage as villains . If Maas ' imagining posits &quot; old Fong &quot; as the 77-year-old Cantonese lung tao ( &quot; dragonhead &quot; ) of the 14K Society , is he closer to some real-life bad_guy than Tosches ' central bad_guy , Ng Tai-Hei , also identified as leader of the 14K Society ? Both books take a healthy stab at illuminating the Triads ' history , yet both leave one thirsting for the real scoop on the actual societies . Instead , we get sophisticated variations on the myth of the &quot; inscrutable Oriental. &quot; Ng ' s face &quot; revealed nothing &quot; under stress , until a moment later , &quot; he allowed himself a slight , ambivalent smile. &quot; Yeng , meanwhile , although in_general a more interesting creation , also has &quot; eyes that never smiled &quot; -- though later , his expression , all too typically , is &quot; an enigmatic smile. &quot; Maas fares better with Deng than with his white-bread characters . We spend a good_deal of time with priggish former prosecutor Tom MacLean , whose CIA-operative Dad ( he ' ll come_to find_out ) once helped Deng traffic in drugs . Thanks to that connection , Tom is hired by crusty Manhattan lawyer James B . Needham , an aging preppy boor who showcases the book ' s tin ear for &quot; character-revealing &quot; dialogue : &quot; Two daughters is what I ' ve got , but one them has given me a grandson . In law_school , he is . . . . &quot; Tom , fortuitously for the plot , falls_for Shannon O ' Shea , an ex-nun who happens to be spearheading the FBI crackdown on Asian drug_traffickers . They have the obligatory , maladroitly rendered sex scene and many quarrels , in a romance that ' s tested , TV-drama-style , by the book ' s painfully hackneyed conclusion . Tosches , by comparison , is remarkably light-footed . His richness of incident and detail and his prolix descriptiveness intertwine in an undeniably appealing whole . We live through plenty with Johnny DiPietro -- and his leitmotif of a breeze , which carries both scary ghosts and promise , ultimately works . Like Tosches ' haunted nonfictional subjects , Johnny sticks_with you , along with the credo he comes_upon midway through his tangled story : &quot; I feel_like a season in hell is a small price to pay to get_to the other side in this life. &quot;</TEXT>
