   <HEADLINE> PROBE OF PRI OFFICIAL ' S ASSASSINATION SUGGESTS POSSIBLE DRUG CARTEL LINK ; MEXICO : DEVELOPMENTS LEND CREDENCE TO EX-OFFICIAL ' S CHARGE THAT TRAFFICKERS WERE INVOLVED IN COLOSIO SLAYING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> All three suspects in the alleged plot that led to the assassination of a prominent Mexican politician are linked to the northeastern state of Tamaulipas , officials confirmed Friday , pointing the finger at a drug cartel that until this year had been overshadowed by more flamboyant Pacific Coast narcotics gangs . Television_news also reported the arrests of dozens of people in Tamaulipas , an area said to be controlled by the notorious &quot; Gulf cartel , &quot; which is believed to supply two-thirds of the cocaine that enters the United States . Law_enforcement officials had said previously that the murder weapon used to kill Francisco Ruiz Massieu , the reform-minded No . 2 official in the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI , came from the Rio Grande Valley in Texas , an area that borders Tamaulipas . Mexican investigators would not confirm either the report on the source of the guns or the Tamaulipas arrests . But officials at the Chamber of Deputies confirmed Friday that Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez -- one of two men accused of paying Daniel Aguilar Trevino $ 17 # 000 to kill Ruiz Massieu -- was a technical secretary of the Hydraulics Affairs Commission . Manuel Munoz Rocha , chairman of that commission , is from Tamaulipas and was said to be answering police questions . The attorney_general ' s office denied reports from the government news_agency , Notimex , that Rodriguez Gonzalez had been arrested . Aguilar Trevino , who was captured at the scene of Wednesday morning ' s killing , told police that he was hired by Rodriguez Gonzalez and Carlos Angel Cantu . Cantu is from Aguilar Trevino ' s hometown , Corralejo , Tamaulipas . Developments in the investigation of the Ruiz Massieu assassination have given new credence to assertions by Eduardo Valle Espinosa , a former justice official , that the Gulf cartel was somehow involved in the March 23 killing of Luis Donaldo Colosio , the presidential candidate from the PRI , which has ruled this nation for 65 years . Valle has also said that drug dealers have infiltrated Mexican politics . The Gulf cartel -- so named because it is believed to operate mainly in states along the Gulf_of_Mexico -- is thought to be directly connected to Colombia ' s Cali cartel , law_enforcement sources say . The cartel specializes in cocaine , unlike other gangs that trade_in a variety of illegal narcotics . Through Cali , the Gulf cartel also has contact with Colombia-linked drug dealers in Mexico_City . The cartel ' s kingpin is believed to be Juan ( The Doll ) Garcia Abrego , a broad-faced , 50-year-old with a mustache . He is variously said to have been born in either the violent border town of Matamoros or in Las Palomas , in Texas ' Rio Grande Valley . He developed a reputation for violence in the mid-1980s , when he was accused of the murders of Matamoros journalists Ernesto Flores and Norma Moreno ; they were investigating drug trafficking in the city . Garcia Abrego is wanted in the United States and in Mexico . While Pacific Coast drug gangs have been killing each other off in a turf war in recent years , the Gulf cartel is believed by some to have been cultivating political influence . Valle resigned in May from his position as adviser to the attorney_general because he said the Gulf cartel ' s political pull made the criminal group impossible to penetrate . &quot; I recognize that I am not capable of apprehending the public head of the Gulf cartel , &quot; he said in his letter of resignation . &quot; I did all I could with the instruments at my disposal . I failed. &quot; He has since linked the drug dealers to hard-liners in the PRI -- a faction of the ruling party believed to have been the most threatened by Ruiz Massieu . Ruiz Massieu , the PRI secretary_general , is said to have been a moderate reformer who served as a bridge between the Old_Guard and the Young_Turks advocating democratic reform . Despite Valle ' s frustration , Deputy Atty . Gen . Mario Ruiz Massieu -- brother of the slain man -- has made remarkable strides against the Gulf cartel . In the last four months , he and other authorities have arrested : * Raul Valladares del Angel , accused of being a Garcia Abrego lieutenant . * Carlos Resendez , who is believed to have led the cartel ' s money-laundering operations . He was said to be its financial brain , as well as one of its top traffickers . * Antonio Abrego , Garcia Abrego ' s nephew ; and Alejandro Diaz , who was caught in a police raid in Mexico_City . Police said only that they were important members of the cartel and had been fugitives since 1988 . After those arrests , a month ago , Mario Ruiz Massieu vowed that &quot; the arrest of Juan Garcia Abrego and the dismantling of his criminal organization is a fundamental task &quot; for police . The day before Francisco Ruiz Massieu was assassinated , federal police arrested four suspected members of the Gulf cartel and took from them cocaine with an estimated value of $ 100 # 000 . Between them , the Ruiz Massieu brothers thus managed to irritate both the drug_traffickers and politicians that Valle accuses of having formed an alliance with the traffickers , analysts note .</TEXT>
