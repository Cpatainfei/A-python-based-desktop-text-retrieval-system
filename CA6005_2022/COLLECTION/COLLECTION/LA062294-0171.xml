   <HEADLINE> JORDAN ' S KING HOPES FOR OPEN TALKS WITH ISRAEL ; MIDEAST : HUSSEIN SAYS HE WILL PRESS AHEAD WITH PEACE NEGOTIATIONS WITHOUT RELYING_ON SYRIA ' S LEAD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After decades of alleged secret meetings with Israeli leaders , Jordan ' s King Hussein said Tuesday that he hopes the revival of peace talks next month will lead to an open meeting between the former enemies , perhaps even before the signing of a full treaty . &quot; It is very possible ; I ' m quite flexible , &quot; he told a news_conference here . &quot; When there is a reason , then we ' ll meet . ( There ) is nothing to prevent that. &quot; The king is in Washington for meetings as Jordan and Israel prepare_for their first peace talks in the region next month . The talks will alternate between their respective ports of Aqaba and Eilat , which face each other on the northern Red_Sea coast . The Jordanian leader ' s comments reflect the depth of change in the region as the peace process accelerates after the signing of the Israel-Palestine Liberation Organization accord in May . &quot; We are_on the verge of beginning the serious negotiations that we need to establish peace between us , &quot; he said . The Jordanian monarch also said he is prepared to plunge ahead with Israel no matter what Syria does . While noting that all parties are hoping for a &quot; comprehensive peace , &quot; he said that Jordan ' s position &quot; is not linked to anything that may or may_not happen on any other track. &quot; He said that he and Syrian President Hafez Assad have been in touch and &quot; understand each other very well. &quot; But he made_it clear that Damascus would not call the shots . &quot; In this situation , we feel that nobody has the right to ask us what we do , and we have the responsibility towards ourselves , our land , towards our rights , to do whatever we can to safeguard our interests , &quot; he said . After the PLO pact , mediation between Israel and Syria was given priority , with the help of shuttle diplomacy by Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher . Both Jordan and Lebanon were expected to defer to Syria . But after the initial exchange of positions in May and a follow-up shuttle last month , the Syria track stalled . Israel , looking_for another partner to sustain the momentum , turned_to a willing partner in Amman . Hussein , who has ruled Jordan for more_than four decades , said pointedly that the major Arab players have never fully coordinated their strategies in dealing with Israel . But overall , he added , the peace process has now reached a point where it is &quot; irreversible. &quot; Throughout dozens of earlier peace efforts , Hussein had distanced himself publicly from open meetings with Israeli leaders , though he is reported to have spent hundreds of hours with assorted Israeli government officials , including prime_ministers , from both the Labor and Likud parties . He allegedly even has piloted his own helicopter to secret rendezvous . The king first indicated his willingness for talks shortly before he met with Christopher on Monday . In response , Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin said he would &quot; be happy to meet with King Hussein and with Jordanian officials at any time , anywhere , for the good of peace between the two peoples. &quot; Rabin also called Tuesday for direct talks with Syria . During his U.S. visit , Hussein also underwent a medical_checkup . Two years after cancer surgery , he said he was given a clean bill_of_health .</TEXT>
