   <HEADLINE> MICHIGAN COMMISSION FAVORS LEGAL PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As the trial of Jack Kevorkian resumed in Detroit , a deeply divided citizens ' commission narrowly recommended Monday that Michigan become the first place in the world to legalize physician-assisted suicide . By a vote of 9 to 7 with four abstentions , the Michigan Commission on Death and Dying asked the Legislature to authorize the practice but also called_for an elaborate set of restrictions to safeguard against abuse . The draft measure would authorize physician-assisted suicide for people 18 or older who suffer from a &quot; terminal condition &quot; likely to result in death within six months or who have an &quot; irreversible suffering condition &quot; involving &quot; subjectively unbearable or unacceptable suffering from a physical condition. &quot; It would require a physician to be present for the suicide , after a detailed process involving consultations with another physician , a psychiatrist or psychologist , a social_worker and an expert in pain management . The non-binding vote_in a conference_room at Michigan State University here climaxed a year of deliberations by the commission , which was created by the same law under which Kevorkian is being prosecuted for his role in the suicide of a 30-year-old , terminally ill Detroit man last August . The retired pathologist ' s trial resumed Monday with the presiding judge rejecting a defense motion to dismiss charges , wire_services reported . The defense had argued that the case was being conducted in the wrong county . No country or state has legalized assisted suicide , although the practice is common in Holland and is being discussed in Oregon and Washington state . Wayne County Dist . Atty . John O ' Hair -- a member of the suicide commission and the official who charged Kevorkian -- said that some of the people Kevorkian was involved with would not have qualified under the two tests set_out in the panel ' s proposal and that Kevorkian ' s procedures &quot; don ' t even approach the standards that we have recommended. &quot; The commission also recommended by a vote of 9 to 5 with six abstentions a proposal regulating the role of physicians in assisting suicide . It would authorize only the person who wished to die -- not the physician -- to initiate the act .</TEXT>
