   <HEADLINE> PINNING HOPES ON COMPUTER BULLETIN_BOARDS ; PEOPLE ARE STARTING HOME BUSINESSES BY OFFERING SERVICES THAT HELP HI-TECH AFICIONADOS REACH THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thousands of Southern Californians have discovered a route to the information superhighway through a spare bedroom in Greg Gooden ' s Van Nuys home . As_many as 60 people convene there at once . Some socialize or play games , others use a library , some pick_up their mail . Most stay for hours and many linger far past midnight . Gooden doesn ' t actually see these people . Instead that visitor traffic communicates over computers and through his own local computer bulletin_board company called The Annex . &quot; You can get almost any kind of information you need straight through your computer , &quot; Gooden said . &quot; It ' s like going_to the library without leaving the house. &quot; Nationwide , the big on-line computer_systems include Prodigy , CompuServe and America Online ; this trio alone has nearly 10 million subscribers . Their customers , via computers , can buy and sell stocks , play games , do library research , book airline tickets and read newspapers . But computer enthusiasts also pay to use tiny computer bulletin_board_systems ( BBS ) such_as Gooden ' s . Nationally there are more_than 57 # 000 bulletin_board_systems operating today , according to Boardwatch Magazine , and many are run_out of garages , basements or spare bedrooms . So many new systems are going on-line every month that a reliable count is impossible . &quot; We ' re still not exactly sure how many bulletin_boards are operating in our area , &quot; said Myla Harris , account_executive with Pacific Bell . For customers , part of the lure of small computer bulletin_board_systems is price : Many services are cheaper than the major on-line systems . And smaller systems give customers the chance to communicate more with more local computer users . Despite the boom in small bulletin_board firms , however , the industry suffers from profitless prosperity . It ' s been estimated that nationally only 5 % of the bulletin_board_systems are profitable , maybe another 15 % break_even , and the rest lose money . Dale Porter , 31 , quit his job to run a bulletin_board firm called KBBS out of his home_in Northridge . He started it six years ago with a $ 2 # 000 IBM computer , plus $ 4 # 200 for software , computer modems and installation of 16 telephone_lines . * Three years ago he was excited enough to quit as a computer_programmer with Blue Cross of California to devote all his time to KBBS . More_than 8 # 000 computer users regularly log_on to KBBS , Porter says , and while limited access is free to any caller , only his subscribers get full use of his programs . About 25 % of those callers eventually subscribe , and they pay an average of $ 10 per month . Although he took a substantial pay_cut to run his own business , Porter believes that its growth potential will eventually pay_off . &quot; Running KBBS isn ' t as lucrative as my old job was , but ( it ' s ) growing , &quot; he said . &quot; As with most small businesses it takes a_few years to get a decent return on your investment. &quot; So 24 hours a day , subscribers throughout the San Fernando Valley and surrounding areas simply dial a local telephone_number to link up with KBBS , The Annex and other computer bulletin_boards . KBBS and The Annex provide several channels where users can engage in live trivia games , group conversations or private chats . There are public discussions where users post questions or comments covering topics that range from horticulture to Howard Stern . They can obtain free games , spreadsheet and word_processing programs and even buy products from an on-line shopping service . Subscribers can also send electronic_mail to others , including to anyone outside the system who has an Internet address . The Internet is a worldwide computer_network that was designed in the 1960s to link computers at government research labs and universities . Today it ' s the basic infrastructure of the fledgling information superhighway . Tens of millions have access to the Internet and their ranks are mushrooming . One of Porter ' s customers is Sharon Landers , 32 , who has been a KBBS subscriber for two years . She subscribes_to several local on-line services , and CompuServe because it has access to a hard-to-find medical database . But she increasingly spends her computer time on small bulletin_boards like KBBS . &quot; One big attraction of a board like KBBS is its social character . I enjoy chatting with other users . Basically it ' s an on-line community. &quot; There are also in-person bulletin_board meetings &quot; that allow you to get_together with people you ' ve been interacting with &quot; only on computers . Landers added that she met her current boyfriend while communicating on-line through KBBS . &quot; Big services like CompuServe aren ' t chat-oriented , &quot; she said . &quot; And KBBS doesn ' t tack_on any extra per hour charges like CompuServe does. &quot; * CompuServe charges users $ 20 to join the system and then levies a monthly fee of $ 8.95. The subscription gives users unlimited access to their basic services , such_as on-line publications and news files , but it allows only 60 electronic_mail messages per month . Additional messages cost extra . Subscribers of KBBS and The Annex are allowed full use of all system features for a flat rate . Porter ' s KBBS has a one-year subscription , which limits users to 90 minutes of on-line time each day , at $ 9.50 a month . A comparable subscription at Gooden ' s The Annex costs $ 8 per month . &quot; When you buy a modem , it usually comes_with a trial subscription to one of the national services like Prodigy , &quot; Porter noted . &quot; But when the trial period ends and Prodigy sends you this big bill , you realize it ' s time to start shopping around . that ' s how a lot of my customers find me. &quot; On-line chat and interactive games are the most popular features on local computer boards . &quot; In a sense my main product is the people who use my system , &quot; Porter said . &quot; A lot of computer users subscribe_to KBBS just so they can interact with those people. &quot; One popular game offered by The Annex and KBBS is TradeWars 2002 in which a user assumes the role of a space ship captain who forms alliances or does battle with other players to accumulate cargo , money and power . Another popular game , Trivia , is similar to the TV game_show &quot; Jeopardy ! &quot; ; contestants try to be the first to correctly answer questions posed by the computer . Porter ' s next plan to grow is to attract small businesses to log_on with KBBS . &quot; Most ( customers ) access the system at night , so I have a lot of idle phone_lines during the workday . With that excess capacity I can offer small businesses across Southern California an inexpensive way to communicate as an alternative to phoning and faxing , &quot; Porter explained . &quot; Employees can have teleconferences , exchange documents and files , and send E-mail . It ' s a perfect telecommuting set up. &quot; People who run their own computer bulletin_board service better like the job , because the hours required are enormous . In a room no more_than 15 feet square , Greg Gooden logs 18-hour days surrounded by an array of computers , monitors and technical reference_manuals . Formerly an office manager , he was laid_off last November and then decided to work full-time on The Annex . Since then , Gooden claims , his company would have been quite profitable , had he not plowed most of his revenue back into the system . &quot; Los Angeles is probably the most competitive market in the country , &quot; he explained . &quot; If you want your board to survive , you ' ve got_to keep upgrading the system. &quot; The Annex has just increased its phone_lines and can now accommodate 72 callers simultaneously . &quot; And they ' re begging me to add more , &quot; Gooden said . Customers &quot; don ' t like busy signals . If they get them too often , they ' ll just subscribe &quot; somewhere else . With more_than 2 # 000 active users , The Annex generates about $ 7 # 000 in subscription revenue each month , but Gooden typically reinvests $ 5 # 000 of that in his system . &quot; I ' m in this business for the long_haul , &quot; he said . Gooden says his revenues have increased almost every month since January , 1992 , when he started The Annex as a rudimentary system capable of handling only eight callers at once. &quot; So far , ( it ) has surpassed all my expectations , &quot; Gooden said . &quot; It may_not be outrageously profitable at this point , but I ' m making a living and the subscription revenue is paying_for the growth of the system. &quot; * Indeed , Gooden intends to expand The Annex ' s call-in capacity to 100 lines and to increase his slate of the Internet ' s features , including being able to communicate overseas , by summer ' s end . Gooden also sees growth potential by setting_up a children ' s computer bulletin_board filled with games and educational files . He ' s also now moving the business out of his bedroom and into a recently leased office on Van Nuys Boulevard . Another bulletin_board entrepreneur , who concedes he ' s undergoing some financial strains , is Eric Higgins . He owns BrainStorm , based in Simi Valley . &quot; After four years . . . I haven ' t come_close to breaking_even , &quot; Higgins said . &quot; Last year BrainStorm grossed $ 7 # 000 . But I spent $ 14 # 000 upgrading and adding new features. &quot; Higgins , 32 , has a full-time job as an engineer with MagneTek , a defense subcontractor in Simi Valley -- although MagneTek recently announced it was moving most of its operations to Tennessee . Higgins started his own computer bulletin_board after trying various on-line services and finding their quality disappointing . &quot; I thought I could put_together a more user-friendly setup , &quot; he said . To start , he spent $ 2 # 000 on an IBM clone PC , and another $ 800 on software , modems and getting two telephone_lines installed at his home . So far Higgins has regularly tapped his defense_contractor paychecks to subsidize BrainStorm ' s expansion from two phone_lines to eight . He expects to do so again soon when he increases to 16 lines . Today Brainstorm logs almost 200 calls a day and has about 630 regular callers . But Higgins said only 180 are paid subscribers . So far this year he ' s grossed about $ 3 # 400 in subscription revenue , but Higgins said BrainStorm needs 80 new subscribers each month to break_even . &quot; I really don ' t mind dipping_into my own pocket to improve the system , &quot; Higgins said . &quot; I ' m convinced that the BBS industry has a big future , and I want to be a part of it. &quot; To attract more business , he puts free ads in computer publications and he attends local computer club meetings and trade shows . More_than anything else , an expanding user base -- and the subscription revenue it provides -- are the lifeblood of a successful bulletin_board . As Higgins put it , &quot; He who gets the most callers wins. &quot; One thing this trio of bulletin_board operators has in common is a conviction that their industry will keep growing . &quot; In the 1980s , people asked you for your fax number , &quot; Porter said . &quot; In the 1990s , they ' re going to be asking_for your Internet address. &quot;</TEXT>
