   <HEADLINE> 29 IN EXILE AFTER E . TIMOR PROTEST AT EMBASSY ENDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After holding_out for nearly two weeks on the grounds of the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta , 29 protesters from the disputed territory of East Timor left Indonesia on Thursday for political exile in Portugal . &quot; Our political decision is to let them all go , &quot; Foreign Minister Ali Abdullah Alatas said , according to the official Antara news_agency . The government had earlier hinted that one of the group might be detained in a murder investigation . The bedraggled protesters were given new clothes at the embassy and then taken_in a Red_Cross bus to the airport for the flight to Lisbon . As they left the embassy grounds , the protesters waved at journalists outside . The group brought worldwide attention to their cause by scaling an iron fence outside the embassy on Nov . 12 as political_leaders from Asia and America were arriving in Jakarta to hold regional trade talks . The demonstrators , who remained in a parking_lot adjacent to the main embassy , asked_for a meeting with President Clinton or Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher to press their demands for the freedom of Jose ( Xanana ) Gusmao , leader of the East Timor independence movement , who is serving a 20-year prison_term . While no senior U.S. officials met with the group , Christopher said Clinton raised the East Timor issue in his talks with Indonesian President Suharto . But there was no progress_reported in efforts to find a political solution to the problem . East Timor is a former Portuguese colony that was seized by Indonesia in 1976 , an annexation never accepted by the United Nations . The territory has been the subject of numerous accusations of human_rights violations by the Indonesian military . As the protesters left the embassy complex , calm was reported returning to the university campus in Dili , the capital of East Timor . Security_forces fired tear_gas on the campus grounds Thursday after students pelted police with stones . Dili has been in turmoil for two weeks , with frequent and violent clashes between Timorese protesters and Indonesian security_forces . Most Timorese are Roman_Catholic , while the Indonesians are predominantly Muslim . The Indonesian government announced Wednesday that 30 Timorese arrested during the unrest will be brought_to trial for their involvement in the disturbances . The London-based human_rights group Amnesty International said in a statement that it was concerned about the fate of 200 demonstrators reported missing in East Timor in the past two weeks .</TEXT>
