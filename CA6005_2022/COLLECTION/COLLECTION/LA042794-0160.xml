   <HEADLINE> JAPAN ' S PREMIER FACES PROSPECT OF MINORITY GOVERNMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japanese Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata faces the prospect today of forming a minority government lacking authority at_home and credibility abroad . Rejected on one side by the Socialists , who bolted the nation ' s ruling coalition early Tuesday , and condemned on the other by the Liberal Democrats , Japan ' s rulers from 1955 to 1993 , Hata failed for a second day to form a Cabinet and participate in a ratification ceremony in the presence of Emperor Akihito . A policy speech he had been scheduled to deliver also was postponed indefinitely . Without the imperial ceremony , limited power to implement routine business remains in the hands of former Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and his Cabinet_ministers , all_of whom resigned Monday before Parliament elected Hata prime_minister . In effect , Japan -- a nation that , with the same party controlling the government for 38 years , enjoyed such stability that critics charged it was not a real democracy -- had no functioning government . And a return of stability and credible government was nowhere in_sight . Stripped of assured support from its former partners -- the Socialists and the New Party Harbinger , which earlier declared it would not join the new Cabinet -- the four parties and three splinter_groups now in the coalition hold only 37 % of the seats in the lower house and 24 % in the upper house . Such a government would be able to pass legislation only with help from its opponents and would lack international credibility to carry_out promises . A plan to present to the United States in June a program of economic_policies to substantially reduce Japan ' s trade surplus appeared threatened . Supporters and opponents of the coalition agreed that the 1994 budget must be enacted quickly , offering hope that opponents might not try to throw the coalition out of office until the budget is passed , probably in June . The Yomiuri newspaper today reported a growing possibility that the lower house will be dissolved and a general_election held after the budget is passed . Budgets normally are submitted to Parliament in late January and approved by late March before the fiscal_year begins April 1 . Japan is operating_on an interim budget , and deliberations on the spending bill have not begun . Yoshiro Mori , the Liberal Democrats ' secretary_general , urged Hata to decline his designation by Parliament as prime_minister . Meanwhile , the party ' s president , Yohei Kono , offered to cooperate with the Socialists and the New Party Harbinger , while Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama made the same offer to the Liberal Democrats and Harbinger . Hata continued his efforts to persuade the Socialists to rescind their decision . But his pleas fell on deaf ears . Murayama declared that the Socialists ' former partners had broken faith with his party , which holds 74 seats in the lower house , by secretly establishing a 130-member &quot; parliamentary negotiation bloc &quot; -- which acts like a single political_party in Parliament . Establishment of the bloc , &quot; which must have been planned some time ago , &quot; was an attempt to &quot; contain the Socialists &quot; through &quot; the power of numbers , &quot; he charged . Socialist Vice_Chairman Jun Oide declared : &quot; We won ' t go_back . The only path is to create a new political structure. &quot; Coalition hopes that a rebellion might develop within the Socialist_Party also faded . The party ' s central committee , a caucus of its members_of_Parliament and even its most conservative faction all officially approved Murayama ' s decision to withdraw from the coalition . Party executives also rejected a coalition offer to abolish the controversial negotiating bloc if they would return to the government .</TEXT>
