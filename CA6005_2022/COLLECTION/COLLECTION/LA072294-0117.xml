   <HEADLINE> ARGENTINE , ISRAELI DIPLOMATS VOW TO FIND BOMBERS OF JEWISH CENTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Standing shoulder to shoulder at a memorial to Jewish victims of terrorism , diplomats from Argentina and Israel vowed Thursday in Los Angeles to find those responsible_for this week ' s bombing of a Jewish center in Buenos Aires that killed more_than 45 people . &quot; We hope the truth comes very soon , &quot; said Luis Maria Riccheri , consul general for Argentina . &quot; Argentina needs that . The world needs it. &quot; Uri Oren , consul general for Israel , said : &quot; The enemies of peace will not deflect Israel from its way , &quot; adding that his country is &quot; gratified &quot; by Argentina ' s swift reaction to Monday ' s bombing . The consuls ' unusual meeting at the Simon Wiesenthal Center ' s Museum of Tolerance came as rescue workers in Buenos Aires continued digging for 73 people thought to be missing in the ruins of a building that housed the_Argentine Jewish Mutual_Aid Assn . and the Delegation of Argentine Jewish Assns . Nearby , about 150 # 000 Jews and others filled a Buenos Aires plaza to protest and listen as prayers and messages from Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres were read . At the Museum of Tolerance , Riccheri and Oren met privately with about two_dozen Los Angeles-area Jews who have friends or relatives who may have been in the attack . Officials of the Wiesenthal Center said they have set_up an information hot_line in conjunction with the two consulates to relay news of victims . Twice-daily updates of the names of those killed , missing or injured are available at ( 310 ) 553-9036 . Although Argentina has long had a reputation as a haven for Nazis who fled Germany after World_War_II , security experts have blamed a pro-Iranian guerrilla group for the bombing . They speculate that Argentina was targeted because of its relatively lax security and large Jewish population . Rabbi Abraham Cooper , associate dean at the center , said the Museum of Tolerance -- which recognizes the 6 million Jews killed in the World_War_II Holocaust -- was picked for Thursday ' s meeting to underscore that Jews will not ignore terrorist acts against them . The message should go_out that Jews will pursue those responsible_for the attack even &quot; if it takes half a century &quot; to bring them to justice , said Rabbi Marvin Hier , dean and founder of the center .
