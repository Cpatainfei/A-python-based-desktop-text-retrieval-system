   <HEADLINE> CLINICS SEE FEWER PATIENTS AFTER PROP . 187 ; HEALTH : OFFICIALS AT O.C. FACILITIES SAY FEAR CONTINUES TO KEEP PATIENTS AWAY . MANY AREN ' T AWARE THAT ENFORCEMENT IS_ON HOLD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Physicians at the East Los Angeles clinic became concerned when Lilian Morales uncharacteristically missed an examination for precancerous lesions on her uterus . Reaching her by telephone at_home , health workers soon ascertained what had happened : Morales , an illegal immigrant from Mexico , feared she would be reported to immigration authorities . So she stayed away . &quot; We had to convince her to come_in , &quot; said Dr. Rene Sanchez , a staff physician at the Community Health Foundation of East Los Angeles , a nonprofit facility that serves a largely immigrant clientele . The scenario , although not universal , has become familiar in some largely immigrant communities , many health providers say . Since the passage of Proposition 187 , according to administrators at many clinics , many fearful immigrants such_as Morales have skipped appointments for routine examinations , both for themselves and their children -- the latter often U.S. citizens . In Orange County , visits to some clinics serving immigrants took a dramatic dive after passage of the proposition and in some communities , health officials said , fear continues to keep patients away . Overall , however , officials said patients now are showing_up in steady numbers -- thanks largely to the educational efforts of the Latino media . &quot; What I ' m hearing from the community is that the word is getting_out &quot; that Proposition 187 is not being enforced , said Russ Inglish , executive_director of Orange County ' s Coalition of Community Clinics . &quot; I don ' t know if ( patient visits ) have reached previous levels , &quot; Inglish said . Margot Hughes-Lopez , executive_director of the South Orange County Community Clinic in San Juan Capistrano , where about 60 % of the patients are Latino , said the initial decline in patients has leveled_off . &quot; There ' s been no further decrease , &quot; she said . &quot; I think the Spanish ( media ) , which I watch every night , does a good job of enforcing the positive message. &quot; Still , Hughes-Lopez said , many patients ask warily upon coming_in whether they need documentation of their legal_status to obtain treatment . &quot; We ' ve had many , many inquiries , &quot; she said . &quot; They literally walk up_to the person in the window and say , ' Am I going_to be asked_for papers ? ' &quot; When patients have been seen before at the clinic , they generally are more trusting and will risk an inquiry , she said . But the clinic official said she is concerned about people who are not plugged into the medical system and feel they have no one to ask . In some quarters , physicians and health officials said the fear of being reported under Proposition 187 still is keeping undocumented patients from seeking basic care . &quot; Our clinic is having a high incidence of no-shows &quot; said Jean Forbath , who sits on the board of Share Our Selves , a Costa Mesa clinic . &quot; I think that people are afraid to come. &quot; Forbath said the clinic ' s staff , which typically sees 30 patients daily , recently had 14 no-shows in one day . The usual number is four or five , she said . &quot; The illegal Hispanic community is afraid , &quot; said Dr. Fernando Montelongo , a general_practitioner in Orange and president of the California Hispanic Group , a group of board-certified doctors . &quot; The rumors are out there that they are going_to be deported. &quot; OrNda HealthCorp , an organization that owns about a dozen Southern California hospitals , sent_out a news release Monday saying many Latino patients are shying_away_from medical attention for themselves and their children . &quot; We ' ve had calls including those from women whose babies are suffering extremely high_temperatures or have been injured , and they are afraid to visit the hospital because they believe they will be reported , &quot; Roseann Gonzalez , the company ' s Latino community liaison for Orange County , is quoted as saying . &quot; We are trying to communicate that they have nothing to fear . It is not our position to police our patients. &quot; OrNda hospitals include Chapman General in Orange , Coastal Communities in Santa Ana , Mission Hospital in Mission Viejo , Doctors Hospital of Santa Ana , Santa Ana Hospital Medical_Center and Fountain Valley Regional Hospital and Medical_Center . Failure to identify and treat diseases at an early stage &quot; could be a public health hazard , &quot; said Dr. Juan Ruiz of the Clinica Oscar Romero near downtown Los Angeles . &quot; Disease could be really advanced if people wait until the last minute to come_to us . That could put the entire community at risk. &quot; In the insular neighborhoods where many recent immigrants live , word has often not filtered down that court challenges have blocked implementation of Proposition 187 -- which , among other things , would deny non-emergency public health_care to illegal immigrants and require that providers turn_in those suspected of being undocumented . &quot; People don ' t know exactly what ' s going_on and they ' re being scared_away , &quot; said Ruiz , chairman_of_the_board of Clinica Oscar Romero , which serves a large Central_American population in the Pico-Union neighborhood . &quot; As a physician , it really concerns me. &quot; Hospital outpatient clinics and nonprofit community facilities -- often favored by an undocumented population that is leery of contacts with government -- have reported a steady 10 % to 20 % decline in patient visits during the last two weeks , according to the Hospital Council of Southern California . &quot; Very few people understand what a temporary restraining order is , and what they ' ve heard is that the overwhelming majority of Californians voted to turn ( undocumented ) people in , &quot; said David Langness , vice_president of the council , which represents 250 health-care facilities across Southern California . &quot; That frightens many folks and keeps them away from health care. &quot; To be sure , some Los Angeles clinics , such_as the South-Central Family Health Center , have continued operating at capacity since Proposition 187 was approved . &quot; We ' re not turning anyone away these days , but we are keeping ourselves busy , &quot; said Sue Scott , director of the South-Central center . At Los Angeles County health_facilities -- probably the nation ' s largest care providers for illegal immigrants -- there is no definitive indication that residents are avoiding health_care facilities in large_numbers . Anecdotal reports that prenatal visits or immunization rates dropped at some county facilities after Proposition 187 ' s passage do not necessarily signal a trend , officials caution . &quot; There has been nothing that has popped_up and smacked us against the face , &quot; said Toby Staheli , a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services , which operates six hospitals , six comprehensive health centers and 39 public health centers . &quot; It ' s just too early to tell. &quot; Yet at some inner-city private clinics , workers have been busily attempting to contact missing patients and otherwise let residents know that nothing has changed for illegal immigrants , pending resolution of a court case in Los Angeles concerning the legality of Proposition 187 . &quot; My sense is that there has been an impact , but it varies from clinic to clinic , &quot; said Yolanda Vera , a staff attorney in the Los Angeles office of the National Health Law Program , a legal services support center that works_on health issues . &quot; There ' s a lot of confusion out there , and there are people who are fearful of coming_in , whether for clinic appointments or for treatments of something that may become an emergency down the line. &quot; The possibility that Proposition 187 may be having an effect was publicly spotlighted in the last week when 12-year-old Julio Cano of Anaheim died . His parents said they had avoided taking him to a hospital because they feared being asked about their immigration status . Both parents are illegal immigrants from Mexico , as was the boy . Coroner ' s officials said Julio had acute_leukemia , a childhood cancer that can lead to aggressive infections and cause death in a matter of months or even weeks . But whether Julio ' s life might have been saved by an earlier diagnosis of acute_leukemia remains uncertain , medical experts said . The vast majority of hospitals and clinics in California receive some public funding , meaning virtually all state health_facilities would be required under the dictates of Proposition 187 to deny services to anyone who could not demonstrate lawful immigration status . Experts say the requirement could jeopardize the existence of some private clinics , particularly those serving poor immigrant communities . This may be one reason , according to Proposition 187 advocates , that clinic operators have been so vociferous in pointing_out the early impacts of the measure . &quot; Follow the money , &quot; said Barbara Coe , a founding member of the Proposition 187 movement . &quot; Of course , they don ' t want to lose patients -- that ' s why we ' ve been attacked so viciously -- it ' s a threat to their coffers. &quot; Proposition 187 ' s opponents -- who included most professional medical associations -- have long warned that implementation of the wide-ranging measure could result in a sharp decline in preventive care and a consequent rise in emergency_room cases and preventable deaths . Many physicians also cited the potential for epidemics , as immigrants would likely avoid immunizations , screening and treatment for tuberculosis ( still widespread in many immigrants ' homelands ) and treatment for sexually transmitted ailments and other infectious_diseases . &quot; Our biggest concern is that we ' re going to see a drop-off in things that aren ' t emergencies , &quot; said Dr. Shirley Fannin , director of public health disease control programs for Los Angeles County . &quot; Immunizations are preventive , and most people will put them off with the slightest excuse. &quot; In comments after approval of Proposition 187 , however , Gov . Pete Wilson pointedly sought to quell the fears of a health disaster and made clear his intention to continue providing everyone -- regardless of immigration status -- with government-funded services considered essential to public health , presumably immunizations and contagious_disease screening and treatment . Although such a policy would seem to violate the intentions of Proposition 187 ' s framers , Wilson has indicated that his obligation to protect Californians ' health is paramount . As part of his executive order after passage of Proposition 187 , Wilson directed officials of the Department of Health Services to issue emergency regulations &quot; which provide_for the continued availability at all levels of government , independent of citizenship or immigration status , of such public health services as they deem necessary to protect the general public from threats to the public health. &quot; Now , all is_on hold pending the resolution of the court challenges . But the sense of worry is evident at many clinics . Prenatal examinations at the Community Health Foundation of East Los Angeles have dropped about 60 % since just before the election , administrators say . Immunizations against infectious childhood diseases such_as measles , polio and diphtheria have nose-dived more sharply . Clinic physicians administered 72 immunizations during the first 15 days of November , compared to a normal rate of 400 child immunizations for that period . &quot; It ' s directly tied to the fear of Proposition 187 , &quot; said Rodolfo Diaz , executive_director at the federal- and state-funded facility , which logs about 150 # 000 patient visits annually . &quot; The undocumented parents , the parents of mixed undocumented and resident families , are not bringing their kids in . People are fearful . They think we ' re going to start reporting them. &quot; At the Clinica Oscar Romero in Pico-Union , patient visits declined more_than 50 % during the first five days after the election , Ruiz said . Activity has since rebounded to about 70 % of the pre-election clientele , he added , thanks to an aggressive advertising and outreach campaign notifying residents that no one would be denied services or turned_in . Some clinics in Ventura County have also reported a dip in client visits , with the Clinica Vista seeing half its normal patient load , according to Dr. Chris Landon , who runs the prenatal facility Clinica Vista in the city of Ventura . Landon attributes the decline at least partially to concerns over Proposition 187 . In Simi Valley on a recent weeknight , the normally bustling Free Clinic was empty . &quot; I don ' t know why no one is here , but I fear it is because of Prop . 187 , &quot; said FredBauermeister , director of the clinic , which provides medical_care to about 4 # 700 clients . Alarmed at the decline of patients at some inner-city health_facilities , a new coalition of organizations that opposed Proposition 187 plans to tape public_service announcements in Spanish and English next week to advise illegal immigrants to continue seeking health_care . The message &quot; will be especially targeted to pregnant mothers -- we ' ll tell them to continue to seek prenatal care , &quot; said Langness , whose organization is co-sponsoring the announcements along with the Hollywood Women ' s Policy Center , Asian-Pacific Planning Council , Community Clinics Assn . and the Los Angeles Unified Board_of_Education . The drop-off in immigrant patients is more notable in urban clinics than at rural sites , said Arnoldo Torres , a Sacramento-based policy consultant who represents 15 nonprofit clinics statewide . In rural facilities , Torres said , workers cited no significant decline in patient visits since the passage of Proposition 187 . &quot; You don ' t have as much media attention in the rural communities , &quot; he said . In Los Angeles , no definitive statistics are available on November patient levels . However , some initial data and anecdotal evidence indicates a drop-off in some segments of the massive government-operated system . In comparing election week of 1994 with the same week during 1993 , administrators found that prenatal visits systemwide were down 4.2 % . However , officials cautioned that such a decline did not necessarily indicate a trend . At the El Monte Comprehensive Health Center , which provides everything from dental services to prenatal checkups , a sharp reduction has occurred in immunizations administered since October , according to Edis Callejas , who manages the immunization clinic .
