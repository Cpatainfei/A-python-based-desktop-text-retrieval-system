   <HEADLINE> THE SHOCK JOCK OF TELEVANGELISM ; WITH SAVVY PHILANTHROPY AND AN IN-YOUR-FACE STYLE , DR . GENE SCOTT HAS GENERATED A LAVISH LIFESTYLE , POWERFUL FRIENDS IN LOS ANGELES AND A FIERCELY LOYAL GLOBAL FOLLOWING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> ON ANY GIVEN NIGHT , MILLIONS OF weary souls plop down on the family-room couch , pick_up the remote and scan the airwaves in search of infotainment . They skip past snapshots of Roseanne raiding the refrigerator and the Bundys swapping insults until a close-up of The Face flashes on the screen . Partially obscured by cigar smoke , the face appears puffed with rage and ready to explode . Piercing blue eyes stare through half-framed reading specs and gold-rimmed shades , worn one on top of the other . A mouthful of perfectly aligned , pearl-white teeth sneers behind a wispy beard . Shocking white hair stands_out each night from under assorted head wear -- a Stetson , a Stanford cap , a crown , even a sombrero . This bizarre visage lures television viewers to Dr. Gene Scott , pastor and supreme leader of the Los Angeles University Cathedral . But it is his provocative , profanity-laced monologues that keep them tuning_in . Scott ' s eclectic broadcast mixes high-voltage Scripture and obnoxious solicitations ( for money , naturally ) with taped footage of his church ' s world-champion American saddlebred show horses prancing to the tunes of Sinatra and Springsteen . Toss_in heavy doses of call-in hero_worship from South_Africa to Santa Barbara along with amusing commentary on current events and the result is a sort of religious Rush Limbaugh . &quot; Nuke ' em in the name of Jesus ! &quot; Scott ranted during the Gulf War , boasting that he was the only minister urging President Bush to bomb Iraq . Recently , after three years of extensive dental work , Scott joked to his congregation that &quot; there ' ll be fewer weeks in 1994 that I come here wanting to kill . So , get_on the telephone ! &quot; &quot; Get_on the telephone ! &quot; is Scott ' s favorite bark . It ' s his way of ordering the faithful to send cash . And send they do , more_than $ 1 million a month , according to some estimates . Through the years , the collections have helped support Scott ' s lavish lifestyle -- chauffeured limousines , Lear jet travel , a Pasadena mansion , ' round-the-clock bodyguard protection and scenic horse ranches in Kentucky and the San Gabriel Valley . At first blush , w . euGene Scott , as he spells his name , seems miscast as God ' s renegade salesman . The 64-year-old preacher ' s son holds a Stanford Ph.D. , fancies himself an intellectual , a philosopher , an avid bibliophile and philanthropist . But a closer look reveals a fascinatingly complex character : Scott has no formal education in theology , an enormous ego , eccentric personality and extraordinarily diverse interests . He is a world-renowned stamp_collector , an equestrian , painter and hunter , and a saxophonist who pokes_fun at &quot; honkers &quot; like President Clinton . He has been lampooned on &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; by comic Robin Williams , profiled in the documentary &quot; God ' s Angry Man &quot; and feted by some of California ' s prominent personalities . Scott is hailed by some community leaders for reviving the Christian spirit in the City of Angels . While crime , homelessness , graffiti and the stench of the inner_city have pushed other congregations to the outer suburbs , Scott relocated his Glendale church Downtown in 1986 . Every Sunday he attracts hundreds of worshipers from all_over Southern California to hear his message in the historic United Artists Theater at Broadway and Olympic . His church spent $ 2 million to renovate the classic Spanish Gothic theater , established in 1927 by Hollywood luminaries Mary Pickford , Charles Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks , and today , the cathedral rooftop carries the same neon red &quot; Jesus Saves &quot; signs that for decades towered over the city ' s skyline a_few blocks away on Hope Street . For all his achievements , Scott remains misunderstood and the subject of much ridicule . His wealth and notoriety , coupled with his spirited defense of the Resurrection lead skeptics to dismiss him as just another greedy , Bible-thumping televangelist . But nothing infuriates Scott more_than to be lumped with the_likes_of Jerry Falwell , Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart . &quot; In every way possible within the boundaries of God ' s word , I have tried to separate from the television evangelists ' image , &quot; Scott tells his congregation . Television evangelist &quot; has become a word that can only become analogized to nigger , kike , beaner and other epithets designed to demean and create a perceptual set of a lesser-quality being. &quot; Few quarrel with Scott ' s insistence that he occupies a planet all his own in the universe of electronic ministry . Within the mainstream of religious broadcasters , largely made_up of conservative evangelicals like the Rev . Billy Graham , Scott is regarded_as unique . Indeed , he is unusual even among the many zany characters who operate_on the fringe of televangelism . Who else spreads God ' s word so fervently while smoking a fat cigar and cursing his rivals ? Or advises his followers that they don ' t have to go_to church on Sunday to be a Christian ? Now that his church ' s broadcasting enterprise -- the University Network -- spans the globe , Scott claims the world as his parish . It comes as no surprise that Scott attracts more_than his share of critics . They portray him as a paranoid , vindictive iconoclast who leads a flock of rebellious followers . Scott , they are quick to point_out , is accountable only to himself , tolerates zero dissent and exerts a frightening level of control over his followers . &quot; He refuses to put himself in a position where he can be criticized , &quot; says David Gill , a professor of Christian ethics at North Park College in Chicago , who has observed Scott . &quot; Instead , he surrounds himself with all these sycophants and weaklings who are just looking_for somebody to submit to. &quot; Scott provides a form of drive-by religion for the ' 90s to a transient population that needs only to watch television and send_in cash to be counted among the faithful . But Scott preaches no easy gospel ; the fiery pastor guides his congregation each Sunday through two hours of intense analysis that focuses_on his own distinctive interpretation of Scripture . &quot; I came_to town 18 years ago and said I ' m looking_for the uncommon man or woman , &quot; Scott explains . &quot; I ' m not here to transplant saints . If you just want an ordinary church , pick_up the Yellow Pages and find the closest one to you. &quot; ON A GORGEOUS FEBRUARY AFTERNOON , NINE top officials from the Glendale Adventist Medical_Center arrive_at a lavish estate in Pasadena with no idea what awaits behind the heavy iron gates . Upon entering the meticulously landscaped grounds , they are screened by a guard who carefully checks each of their names against a formal guest list . Scott is entertaining the Adventists to show his appreciation for the care his 82-year-old mother received after falling and breaking both wrists and a leg . The hospital staff had accommodated Scott ' s daily midnight visits and his entourage of security men , personal physicians and other aides . During the next three hours , Scott conducts a tour of his church ' s &quot; Sistine Chapel &quot; -- an underground , climate-controlled museum that includes an original Rembrandt and Monet displayed among the pastor ' s own paintings . The visitors are treated to an exquisite five-course luncheon catered and served by trendy Marino ' s of Melrose Avenue . They are left speechless when Scott offers to contribute $ 20 # 000 to a hospital fund-raising_drive to obtain new surgical equipment . They are dazzled by Scott ' s riveting life_story , witty charm and encyclopedic mind , later describing him as &quot; sensitive , &quot; &quot; urbane , &quot; &quot; humorous , &quot; &quot; thoughtful &quot; and &quot; humble. &quot; For some guests , it is difficult reconciling this version of Scott with the same personality who appears so wacky on TV . &quot; People started walking away feeling they had been in the presence of a Renaissance_man , &quot; extols David R . Igler , a hospital vice_president . &quot; It was kind of like being with a Leonardo da Vinci . I don ' t think I ' ve ever had an encounter or experience like that in my life. &quot; Igler offered to recount his impressions of the visit at the request of L.A. City Councilman Richard Alatorre , a close friend of Scott and a loyal supporter . &quot; Have you talked with him ? &quot; Igler inquired , the amazement in his voice suggesting that I , too , would be in awe after meeting the Renaissance_man . For months , I had tried to interview Scott . I had called his church ' s toll-free hot_line to make a mandatory reservation for his Sunday service . A volunteer , called a &quot; Voice of Faith , &quot; answered , and she noted my name and asked_for my &quot; King ' s House &quot; number , which identifies all dues-paying members . She also asked whether I had ever attended Scott ' s service . When I told her I had no ID number and that I had never been before , she apologized and said it was unlikely a visit could be arranged . ( But others have easily made reservations. ) I drove to the University Cathedral anyway , parking in a vacant_lot across the street from the rear of the church . I couldn ' t help but notice several middle-aged men in polyester suits with worried looks painted on their faces and two-way radios plugged into their ears . They were members of the church ' s vaunted security detail , which includes off-duty Los Angeles cops paid to protect Scott , his congregation and their Downtown property . The heavy security is necessary , Scott contends , because the church &quot; has a lot of valuables , including my life. &quot; Within minutes , one guard retrieved a pair of binoculars and began looking my way . Another guard walked up_to my car and jotted_down the license_plate number . A third , with long red hair tied_in a ponytail , approached and stood within a_few feet of the driver ' s side_door , watching_over me . I left my car and walked_around the block to the front_entrance of the cathedral , where I encountered the same ponytailed guard , arms crossed and chest expanded . I kept walking . The church ' s lawyer had cautioned me against sneaking into the cathedral if I wanted to land an interview with Scott . On a subsequent Sunday , the security crew threatened a photographer who showed_up outside the church to take photographs for this article . Police were called to the scene when one of the guards repeatedly shouted obscenities . I never did get_to meet Scott , shake his hand or pose a question in_person despite repeated attempts . &quot; Gene Scott has no intention of responding to any questions regarding church finances and Dr. Scott personally , &quot; the pastor comments . All the quotations from Scott in this article come either from taped broadcasts of his programs or written responses passed_through a church lawyer . At my request , Scott furnished five references for me to interview . All were certifiable big_shots who used superlatives to describe Scott while glossing_over his idiosyncrasies . A &quot; brilliant fellow , &quot; raved Lodwrick Cook , the ARCO chairman . &quot; Extraordinarily bright , &quot; glowed Mark Pisano , executive_director of the Southern California Association of Governments . &quot; He is a very , very bright , intelligent man , &quot; lauded Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs . &quot; He is caring . He is committed to the city . He is honest , &quot; praised Alatorre . None could top the gushing of California Assembly Speaker Willie Brown : &quot; I think he is one of the most interesting public figures in California . He is an extraordinarily brilliant person . His skills at communicating are probably equal_to anybody that we currently know and may ever know. &quot; Each of the five men had been exposed to Scott ' s charm and witnessed his extreme generosity . When Cook helped lead the &quot; Save the Books &quot; campaign after the Downtown Central Library fires , Scott organized a telethon that raised $ 2 million in pledges . As a fellow director of the Rose Bowl Aquatics Center in Pasadena , Pisano appreciated Scott for rescuing the nonprofit swim facility with cash donations exceeding $ 430 # 000 . When Wachs wanted to rally support for his mayoral candidacy last year , Scott arranged for him to address his congregation on television . Whenever Alatorre needs a contribution to a worthy cause in his district , Scott is &quot; always there &quot; to chip_in . And when Brown ' s VIP friends visit Los Angeles , Scott gladly furnishes a church limo . A relentless self-promoter , Scott adroitly uses his church ' s charitable contributions and his association with personalities to boost his ministry . Compliments from Cook and former L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley , among others , have appeared in full-page newspaper_ads touting the minister and his church . When Scott wanted to establish his good character during a 1990 court battle , he did not hesitate to drop the names of Bradley and others in legal papers . Scott maintains that his church contributes only to charities that city officials recommend for the community good . Asked whether he uses friends in high places to help legitimize his church , Scott responds : &quot; The question is an insult to me , the ( church ) and my friends . We were never illegitimate. &quot; Nonetheless the hard_sell does not make a believer of everyone . The Rev . Dale O . Wolery became acquainted with Scott in 1985 before the Church of the Open_Door , of which he was assistant pastor , sold its historic Downtown cathedral to Scott ' s congregation for $ 23 million . Wolery had spent a good_deal of time in Scott ' s company . But after Scott reneged_on the deal , involving the church in protracted lawsuits , Wolery came_to view Scott as a manipulator and a showman . &quot; I don ' t like what he stands_for , &quot; concludes Wolery , currently senior pastor at North Community Church in Yorba Linda . &quot; A side of him is engaging , warm . He knows how to make you feel good . He is dangerous primarily because he really comes_off as a straight shooter . He is the ultimate hypocrite. &quot; AT AN EARLY AGE , SCOTT BECAME WELL VERSED IN THE HIGHER POWER OF religion . The son of a traveling preacher and his teen-age wife , he was born_on Aug . 14 , 1929 , in Buhl , Ida . When Scott was 6 , his mother gave_birth to premature twins , and the girl died within hours . The following month , the baby boy was asleep and young Gene was suffering convulsions when their mother had a vision of angels coming . &quot; I saw a stairway begin to roll_down from heaven and come right down to the side of my bed , &quot; Inez Leona Graves Scott recalled in a 1980 interview . &quot; Two angels walked down and they stopped in front of Gene . I said , ' Oh no , Lord , you can ' t take Gene ! ' and they just went_around him and picked the baby up. &quot; The infant died but Gene was spared . From then on , his parents knew their surviving child was special . Shortly thereafter , the family moved to the Northern California town of Gridley when W.T. Scott agreed to head an Assemblies of God church . He succeeded a pastor who crucified himself on a tree trying to imitate the marks of Christ . &quot; At that time , the people like my dad were the cults , the kooks and the nuts , &quot; Scott once told an interviewer . In elementary_school , Scott proved to be an exceptional student . Accompanying a straight-A , seventh-grade report_card was a teacher ' s note to his parents : &quot; Do you know you have a genius for a son ? &quot; He played_on the high_school basketball_team , though his father ' s congregation did not approve of the boy exposing his legs in public . The caption under Scott ' s photo in the 1947 Oroville Union High_School yearbook read , &quot; Always a good-natured fellow. &quot; Scott married his high_school sweetheart , Betty Ann Frazer , in the early 1950s . They had no children and were divorced 23 years later . On his program , Scott has portrayed her as the &quot; devil ' s sister . I hate her . If I go_to heaven and she ' s there , I ' m going_to another planet. &quot; Scott ' s second wife , Christine E . Shaw , a stunning woman 20 years his junior , can be seen nightly on his program riding the church ' s champion show horses . Trained in ballet for 16 years , Shaw shares Scott ' s passion for art , stamps , coins and other collectibles . A pivotal point in Scott ' s life came when he enrolled in a doctorate program in philosophy of education at Stanford_University . One professor was a leading disciple of Reinhold Niebuhr , and Scott ' s dissertation on the American philosopher left an indelible mark on him . Quoting Niebuhr , Scott described his life ' s goal : to &quot; descend from the anthill of scholastic hair-splitting to help the world of men regulate its common life and discipline , its ambitions and ideals. &quot; Like Niebuhr , Scott believed that this could not be accomplished without religion . At Stanford , Scott stood_out as a loner who was almost single-minded in his quest to excel academically . After earning his doctorate in 1957 , he taught briefly at a Midwestern Bible college , helped Oral Roberts establish a university in Tulsa , Okla. , and joined the Assemblies of God movement , a fundamentalist Christian denomination , where he quickly established himself as a rising star . Scott traveled all_over the world preaching salvation to rapt audiences and designed a Sunday_school curriculum that significantly boosted church membership . &quot; He had one of the sharpest , keenest minds of anyone I have ever known , &quot; recalls the Rev . William Vickery , superintendent emeritus of the Assemblies of God Northern California and Nevada District . But it was only a matter of time before the restless Scott would &quot; go free in_order to be creative and relevant to today ' s world. &quot; In 1970 , Scott resigned his Assemblies of God credential in good standing and returned to Oroville to launch his own ministry with his father . Today , Assemblies of God officials are stunned by what they see and hear on Scott ' s program . &quot; I just can ' t imagine someone with his brilliance and abilities allowing his energies to be diverted the way they have been diverted , &quot; says a perplexed Vickery . &quot; I don ' t understand it . I think it is such a waste. &quot; It was while serving his Oroville ministry that Scott was approached about taking_over the 45-year-old Faith Center Church in Glendale along with its four broadcast stations and $ 3.5-million debt . Scott , who also had established himself as a shrewd entrepreneur , agreed to serve as Faith Center pastor provided that church leaders resign and approve a reorganization plan that gave him control . To Scott ' s amazement , the church accepted . Faith Center since has expanded and prospered . A congregation that numbered 500 when Scott took_over in 1975 has mushroomed to more_than 15 # 000 members in the Los Angeles area , according to church estimates that are difficult to confirm . The church acquired the ultimate power address : P.O. Box 1 , Los Angeles . And in 1983 , the University Network launched 24-hour-a-day broadcasts of Scott sermons via satellite to North_America and much of Mexico and the Caribbean . But soon after , Scott endured two financial disasters that would have placed most pastors in peril of losing their jobs . In 1983 , the Federal Communications Commission stripped the church of three broadcast stations , worth approximately $ 15 million , after Scott refused to turn_over financial records as part of an investigation . ( The church sold the fourth station. ) In 1987 , the church lost a $ 6.5-million deposit when Scott sought unsuccessfully to renege_on a deal to buy the historic Church of the Open_Door building in Downtown Los Angeles , which was later demolished after its owners sold it to developers . The church then pumped more_than $ 2 million into renovating its current location , the United Artists Theater . The setbacks only made Scott more determined to succeed . After the church lost its broadcast licenses , Scott continued to air his program by buying_time on local and cable TV_stations locally and nationally . Scott ' s church not only offered programming to an already-established network of outlets , but continued to air its program on some of the same stations that were taken_away by the FCC . The church also beamed its programming nationwide via satellite . By 1990 , it reached 180 countries . Two years later , his ministry could be picked_up anywhere in the world in four languages on medium- and short-wave radio . ( His program is now seen nightly in greater Los Angeles on cable. ) Scott claims that he did not seek_out an electronic ministry , but happened to rescue the first church in the nation to own a Christian TV_station . In a three-piece suit , the clean-cut Scott looked the part of the stereotypical televangelist when he first hit the airwaves . But it did not take long for him to realize that he needed a shtick . Enter the long hair and beard , crazy hats and cigars . &quot; The cigar lets you know I ain ' t no Jimmy Swaggart , &quot; he howls . He quickly earned a reputation as a colorful preacher whose blunt tactics both attract and offend his audience . He bragged over the air that he could &quot; probably teach Hugh Hefner a thing or two &quot; about sex and told those who refused to send money to &quot; vomit on yourself with your head_up in the air. &quot; This unconventional approach , while widely chastised in religious broadcasting circles , impressed people like the Rev . Jess Moody , a Baptist minister and pastor of Shepherd of the_Hills church in Porter Ranch . Moody is an unabashed Scott admirer who wishes he had such nerve . &quot; The man is not a fool , but he acts like one from time to time , &quot; Moody observes . &quot; That , I think , is designed to get attention from people he wants to reach . Apostle_Paul said , ' I am all things to all men that I might win some. ' Gene is trying to win people to Christ , and he is not doing_it in the standard way. &quot; To attract new viewers , Scott later decided that his church needed a TV sports franchise , something comparable_to Ted Turner ' s Atlanta Braves . Enter the equestrian team . &quot; There are so many horses ' asses on television that I wanted to show the world what a whole horse looked_like , &quot; Scott is fond of saying . Using proceeds from the sale of his art prints , Dr. Gene Scott Inc. acquired the Silver_Oaks Ranch in Bradbury , valued at $ 11 million in 1989 , and a stable of more_than 100 show horses that are now believed to be worth millions . First-time viewers &quot; stop to see the horses because they are a class act , &quot; Scott told viewers in January . &quot; And before they know it , this cigar-smokin ' preacher is talkin ' about something a little different than a rantin ' -and-ravin ' , hellfire-and-brimstone hypocrite preacher . And they stop to see the horses and end_up hooked on the teachin ' . that ' s it . All you get_on this network is me and the horses and the music . Clear ? &quot; &quot; Clear ! &quot; his volunteers shouted obediently from behind studio phone banks . &quot; Just thought I ' d say that . Get_on the telephone ! &quot; In response , callers from around the globe phone in to applaud their pastor . Scott delights in selectively reading the laudatory messages aloud . &quot; From Manchester , Ohio : I love the teachin ' , the horses and the music . It ' s the best on TV . Apple Valley , Calif. : Pastor , God ' s word , you and the horses are all I need . Klamath Falls , Ore. : We got the No . 1 pastor smokin ' the No . 1 cigar on the No . 1 television_program showin ' the No . 1 horses. &quot; IN JANUARY , 1991 , MEMBERS OF THE LOS ANGELES University Cathedral received an urgent appeal in the mail . Their pastor needed them to dig deep for a special fund-raising_drive so critical to the church ' s future that it could not be revealed how the money would be spent . It was not the first time . Scott has instructed his followers to give generously to anonymous fund-raisers on at least six other occasions . This one , called &quot; Secret V , &quot; was the church ' s most ambitious fund-raising mission yet . By Easter , Scott wrote , his ministry had to receive $ 10 # 000 apiece from 700 followers and a minimum $ 1 # 000 apiece from 3 # 000 supporters , for a total of $ 10 million . Estimates vary on the total amount_of_money Scott brings_in . During a recent sermon , he claimed that his members set &quot; the world_record in per-capita giving &quot; by donating $ 350 per person per month . He also has said that his weekly budget of $ 300 # 000 does not come_close to meeting the rent , payroll , broadcasting and other operating expenses . Scott insists that he only accepts financial_support from individuals who respond to his sermons . &quot; People are taught to give based on what they think the teaching they receive is worth , &quot; he stresses . The price of membership is steep . For starters , Scott expects the usual 10 % of his followers ' income in weekly tithings . Since 1988 , at the start of each year , Scott has reminded his followers that he is collecting &quot; firstfruits &quot; above and beyond weekly donations . Firstfruits , according to Scott , is spelled_out in Scripture as &quot; the firstfruit of the new year belongs_to the Lord. &quot; The firstfruits check includes the first returns on any form of income -- an investment , a pay raise , a second job , a tax refund , even Lotto winnings . What if you ' re out_of_work ? &quot; Well then , you give the first week ' s unemployment check , &quot; Scott advises . For non-givers , Scott warns : &quot; If you get too smart with God , He might let you live this next year without Him so you can see the difference. &quot; While raking_in uncounted millions , Scott refuses to open his church ' s books to the scrutiny of independent auditors or follow accounting safeguards required by the 700-member National Religious Broadcasters , a group Scott derides as &quot; Not Real Bright &quot; for inviting as a speaker televangelist Jimmy Swaggart , who was disgraced by a sex scandal in 1988 . Such devastating scandals had cast a pall over televangelists nationwide , but the industry appears to be_on the rebound . Former NRB chairman David Clark says he is encouraged by recent trends in religious programming that emphasize ministry and teaching in place of &quot; glitz , glamour and hype. &quot; &quot; This year marks the end of the televangelist scandals and the impact from them is basically over , &quot; Clark says . A recent study of religious programming found that on-air fund-raising and promotional activities have fallen to the same levels as before the Swaggart scandal . Scott , like a number of other televangelists around the country , is not rushing to join the NRB , which requires organizations to undergo independent financial audits annually , publish a yearly report of income and expenses and disclose total compensation packages of top church officials . He is , says Clark , one of a fading breed . &quot; I see a move away from the entrepreneurial , Lone Ranger guy like him ( Scott ) . I think the next generation will be pastors of mega-churches with thousands of members and budgets of $ 8 ( million ) to $ 10 million a year , minimum. &quot; Still Scott thrives , with a church he says is accountable to God , his congregation , a board of directors he declines to identify and the Full Gospel Fellowship of Churches and Ministries , of which he was president . Such lax financial accountability -- combined with Scott ' s lifestyle -- has , in the past , attracted the attention of state and federal investigators . The California Attorney_General ' s Office in 1978 investigated allegations of fraud at Scott ' s church and 11 other religious organizations . The probe , launched after complaints by church_members , was dropped_in 1980 when the state Legislature passed a law preventing the attorney_general from prosecuting cases of civil fraud against tax-exempt religious organizations . In 1977 , the Federal Communications Commission opened an exhaustive investigation after former employees accused Scott of diverting donations of cash , furs , jewelry , stock and other valuables for his own use and concealing assets in Swiss bank_accounts . The allegations were never proved , and Scott adamantly denies any improprieties . He stymied repeated attempts by the federal_government to scrutinize his church ' s financial operation by directing contributors to sign pledge slips that specifically stated Scott could spend the money however he pleased . This arrangement did not appear to affect the church ' s flow of funds . &quot; He can do anything he wants with the contributions I send him , &quot; allows Mike Parker , the former mayor of Tacoma , Wash. , who has been watching Scott for a decade and donates weekly . It is virtually impossible to know how financial resources are divided among Scott , the church and their many corporations . The church ' s financial empire consists_of a complex web of dozens of interlocking companies , among them Bishop Dr. Gene Scott Corp. , Dr. Gene Scott Inc. , Dr. Gene Scott Consultants Inc. , Gene Scott Travel Inc. , W . Eugene Scott , Ph.D. , Inc. , Gene Scott Evangelistic Assn . and Wescott Christian Center . Scott ' s second wife , for example , received a $ 190 # 000 finder ' s fee when Dr. Gene Scott Inc. purchased the Silver_Oaks Ranch in Bradbury . At the time , Christine Shaw ' s personal fortune included several million dollars worth of horses , stamps , art and vintage cars -- the same items accumulated by Scott and his church . For his part , Scott maintains that he has no property , investments , stocks or bonds and that everything he owns is in the name of the church . His contract calls_for a $ 1 annual salary , plus unlimited expenses . &quot; God knows how much money he has raised over the years soliciting funds , &quot; complains Chuck Dziedzic , the FCC administrator who spearheaded the investigation of Scott ' s church . &quot; We never came_close to finding_out . I don ' t think anybody knows but him. &quot; RON CAREY REGULARLY ATTENDS CATHOLIC MASS AT CHRIST THE KING Church in Hancock Park . But the 58-year-old actor , known best for his role as Levitt in the television sitcom &quot; Barney Miller , &quot; often attends services on Saturday evenings . that ' s because Sundays belong_to Gene Scott . &quot; I have learned more from him than anybody , &quot; Carey says . &quot; He is probably the authority on St . Paul . We just read the Bible and look_at it . He will go right down to the word . This is interpretation . This is knowledge. &quot; Like Carey , many of Scott ' s followers belong_to other denominations . They assert that no one on the religious scene today approaches Scott ' s intellect and expertise when it comes_to interpreting God ' s word . His analysis of Scripture relies heavily on Greek , Hebrew and German studies to clarify inaccuracies in the_English translation . This is evident on Easter_Sundays , when Scott presents a defense of the Resurrection that is rich_in detail , well researched and supported by historical facts , followers say . Scott ' s quarrel with those who deny the Resurrection is that they don ' t spend enough time looking_at it . &quot; If this is true , this is the central fact of history ! &quot; he fumes . &quot; You gotta be a fool among all fools of mankind to not think it ' s worth at least 30 hours of study in your whole life . that ' s why I ' m doing this. &quot; During his Sunday sermons , Scott often admonishes his congregation not to seek God ' s blessing from a priest , the Pope or a place_of_worship . &quot; And you ' re sure not going_to get_it from a motel with Jimmy Swaggart , &quot; he cracks . Rather , these blessings flow through God ' s word as interpreted by Gene Scott . His is a &quot; word-based church &quot; offering intelligent Christianity , Scott emphasizes . In February , Times reporter Ralph Frammolino visited the University Cathedral for a glimpse into Scott ' s appeal . No expense has been spared in restoring the historic theater . The lobby , with gold-backed mirrors and a vaulted ceiling finished in fresco murals , is half a block long . The massive auditorium , almost medieval in appearance , features large murals depicting the motion_picture industry . Onstage , a huge curtain bears the letters &quot; UA &quot; in a coat of arms with the words &quot; The Picture ' s The Thing &quot; -- a fitting slogan for Scott ' s television ministry . Reservations are required to enter the cathedral . &quot; I ain ' t beggin ' converts , &quot; Scott scolds . &quot; You don ' t get_in here without a pass . I don ' t want anybody in here that doesn ' t have an appreciation for that smallest hunger in your heart to pursue the revelation of God ' s word. &quot; First-time visitors like Frammolino are escorted into the auditorium , assigned a seat and closely observed by the church ' s security_force . A buddy system within Scott ' s congregation also keeps a watchful eye on strangers . &quot; We want to make_sure our pastor stays alive , &quot; whispers one follower from Orange County , who identifies himself only as Duane . The 2 # 000-seat theater is filled with people from a variety of ethnic backgrounds . Dressed in casual attire , the churchgoers look as if they could just as easily be going_to Dodger Stadium or a Sunday matinee . No one under age 12 is in_attendance ; children of churchgoers ride air-conditioned buses every Sunday to one of 43 museums within a half-hour of the cathedral . &quot; We don ' t lock our kids in a little cubbyhole and teach them to hate God until they get the first chance to leave the church , &quot; Scott says . When the curtain begins to rise , congregation members leap to their feet and cheer wildly . Before them appears their master , clad in a priest ' s collar , a teal-and-black windbreaker and gray slacks , seemingly unmoved by the adulation . After several seconds of enthusiastic applause , a rock_band belts_out praise to Jesus as Scott sits impassively on a blue-cushioned stool until the singing ends . Among the tunes Scott occasionally orders up is &quot; Kill a Pissant for Jesus. &quot; Scott strives to conduct his service as if it was a postgraduate lecture in religious studies . He is fond of boasting that his congregation consists mostly of college graduates . Unlike most university courses , though , there is no room for discussion of any kind in Dr. Scott ' s classroom . With the exception of not-so-spontaneous laughter at Scott ' s one-liners , not a peep is heard from members during the teaching , not even an &quot; Amen &quot; or a &quot; Hallelujah. &quot; Scott insists that his two-hour service goes uninterrupted and gets angry if people seated in the front get_up , even to go_to the restroom . As he delivers his message , Scott pauses every few seconds to allow an interpreter to repeat his words for the benefit of dozens of Spanish-speaking members in the audience and others listening worldwide . He illustrates the day ' s lesson on a glass rectangle with the intensity of an agitated football_coach marking Xs and Os at halftime . While reading aloud scattered verses in Ephesians , Scott scribbles Greek words on the glass . Hagyois is for sainthood , Dike for righteousness and Logos for the word . He writes in red , blue , green and black felt pens , using the different colors to strike previous markings instead of using an eraser . Within an hour , the board is streaked with arrows , circles , lines and indecipherable words that become nearly impossible to follow . The lecture suddenly is reduced to a mind-numbing blur of Greek nuances that virtually force the class to accept a relentless tightening of the instructor ' s ecclesiastical monopoly . But the underlying message of &quot; basic Christianity &quot; is clear . While other pastors denounce homosexuality , abortion , adultery , profanity and drinking , Scott refuses to condemn such sinful behavior . He leaves worshipers free to make their own choice without coercion . &quot; I don ' t ask you to change when you come here , &quot; he instructs the congregation . &quot; I take you as you are , as God takes me as I am. &quot; Scott preaches that , if people listen to him and start practicing faith , &quot; God is going_to change you in spite of yourself. &quot; He finishes his sermon and vanishes offstage without shaking a single hand or meeting his congregation . Herein lies a startling contradiction : Scott promotes himself as a friend to sinners who have been shunned by other churches , yet his cathedral doors are sealed_off to the general public . Even highly devoted followers are not permitted to approach him in the name of security . Scott ' s retort : &quot; I am more accessible and contactable than the Pope. &quot; Most worshipers seem not to care that they are prohibited from seeing their pastor in_the_flesh . They can tune him in 24 hours a day , seven days a week , reveling in the rediscovery of their faith under the guidance of a shepherd who acts like a rebel and still is elected by God . Frank Anderson , a middle-aged aircraft mechanic who sports an unkempt gray beard , is a typical Scott devotee . He attended church as a child but eventually strayed from religion . That was before he became hooked on Scott ' s television_program while working the night_shift at Northrop . Now he and his wife , Tracy , drive_in every Sunday from Torrance to hear Scott . At first , Anderson found Scott &quot; exasperating &quot; because the minister jumps from subject_to subject during his lectures . But the teachings began to fascinate him , especially the anti-religious-Establishment thread of Scott ' s message . &quot; He teaches that we ' re free , &quot; Anderson notes . &quot; We ' ve been made free and people who are teaching that you are not supposed to do this ( and ) not supposed to do that are voiding that freedom. &quot; Wes Parker , the former Dodger first_baseman , recalls the day in 1980 that he first listened to Scott on television . Within 20 minutes , Parker was_on his feet , pointing at the screen and screaming , &quot; He ' s right ! My God , this guy is right ! &quot; The next day , Parker plunked_down $ 500 for Bible study materials and has been a regular supporter since . &quot; This man has saved my life , &quot; Parker exclaims . He readily admits that some of his friends don ' t hold Scott in such esteem . &quot; They don ' t like a two-hour service . They don ' t like that he occasionally uses a swear word . They don ' t like the fact that he gets angry . They don ' t like that he spends a lot of time railing against people on his staff that he doesn ' t think are doing a good job . Some of those things I don ' t like either , but it is worth it to me to sit through to get the message. &quot; GENE SCOTT WAS LIVID . AFTER successfully courting the vote of flamboyant City Councilman Gilbert W . Lindsay to prevent the Church of the Open_Door from being demolished in 1987 , Scott sensed that he was about to be double-crossed . Lindsay , a religious man whose district included the church site , had assured Scott ' s congregation one Sunday that &quot; hell ' s gonna freeze over &quot; before the building , which Scott ' s church had moved_into , would be torn_down . But when Lindsay began to waver about preserving the 72-year-old church , Scott did not hesitate to remind viewers that Lindsay , then 86 , was in his &quot; senior years &quot; or &quot; 16 years past the biblically appointed allotment &quot; -- three score and 10 . &quot; Now if you ' ve had an illustrious career , and you ' re in your eighth decade , do you want to meet your Maker saying , ' I decided to do one in_for you , God ? ' &quot; Scott thundered . &quot; Gilbert Lindsay ain ' t dumb enough to face his Maker reneging_on a sacred commitment in a platform of a church before 5 # 000 people and an onlooking nation. &quot; In the end , Lindsay got religion and supported the project . He died at age 90 , presumably at_peace with the Lord for keeping his word to Scott ' s church . But Scott could not keep the wrecking ball away . After he ' d unsuccessfully tried to renegotiate his deal for the property , its original owner sold it to developers . Scott lost his $ 6.5-million down_payment , but acquired the church ' s &quot; Jesus Saves &quot; signs . He then moved his church to the United Artists Theater . Scott ' s willingness to invoke the wrath of God against Lindsay demonstrates the lengths he will go_to intimidate an adversary . Friends say Scott is a fierce street_fighter who strives to obliterate an opponent , be it Satan or a competitor . At horse shows , Scott is not content when his equestrian team captures a medal . He wants a sweep of all_the top places . Nowhere has Scott incurred more battle scars than in the courts . Since coming_to Southern California , his church ' s far-flung enterprises have been tangled in more_than 100 lawsuits . At times , Scott and his lawyers have drawn criticism for their litigation tactics . A federal judge in 1987 called a desperate bid by Scott to retain the Church of the Open_Door a &quot; reprehensible &quot; abuse of the legal process . In 1990 , in a lawsuit on behalf of the American Horse Show Assn. , attorneys for the O ' Melveny &amp; Myers law_firm accused Scott of hiding behind corporate fronts to overturn his suspension by the association . In that case , Scott was banned from competition for calling a judge a &quot; prejudicial , incompetent nincompoop &quot; on his television_program after one of his horses lost a competition . Scott argued in legal papers that his suspension should be overturned because the horses were owned by Gene Scott Inc. , which he contended was not run_by Gene Scott . While the suits do not always succeed in court , apparently they are effective in helping to intimidate Scott ' s adversaries . Dozens of people refused to speak about Scott for this article because they expressed fear of being sued . Over the years , Scott ' s followers occasionally have resorted_to verbal threats and physical violence to defend their minister . In 1985 , a musician in Scott ' s band who criticized the preacher reported to officials that he was jumped , punched and tossed through a plate_glass window by two church followers . The musician , Donald Vladimir Nicoloff , was treated for facial and leg cuts . In the months leading_up to a trial on assault charges against his alleged attackers , Nicoloff claimed he received harassing , late-night phone_calls from Scott ' s disciples , some threatening bodily harm . The trial against the two church followers ended in a hung jury when the key witness , the church ' s former head musician , fled to Tennessee because he feared reprisals from Scott ' s disciples , prosecutors maintained . Glendale police were so concerned about a potential outbreak of violence by Scott ' s devotees that the prosecutor assigned to the case , Los Angeles County Deputy Dist . Atty . Herb Lapin , was issued a gun permit and assigned a police_officer for protection during the trial . &quot; I ' m not going_to call his followers fanatics or lunatics , &quot; Lapin says . &quot; But whenever you have a group that has strong followers , I find they are easily led by their leaders , whether they are good or bad. &quot; ADMIRE HIM OR DESPISE him , Gene Scott has attained the kind of fame , lifestyle and influence that most people only dream about . &quot; Only in America , &quot; sighs Clark of the National Religious Broadcasters , &quot; can people like this get_on television , attract an audience and collect enough money to stay_on television. &quot; And only in Southern California , it seems , can a long-haired , loud-mouthed preacher pack a cavernous movie_house each Sunday with followers eager to hear the word_of_God from him . In a city that attracts people seeking the good life , a pastor with a free_spirit , a stable of horses , a chauffeured limo and an answer_for everything can be an attractive role_model . &quot; Gene Scott offers you all_the advantages of Christianity with none of the inconveniences except tithing , &quot; says Rabbi William Kramer , a religious studies professor emeritus at Cal State Northridge and an admirer of Scott . &quot; You don ' t have to put that in cellophane to sell it. &quot; Yet others feel strongly that Scott has no business preaching in a church . The Christian Research Institute , an international religious center based in Irvine that monitors controversial religious_movements , goes so far as_to advise Christians not to attend Scott ' s services . &quot; During the last few years , Scott has become more and more outrageous and offensive , &quot; a CRI analysis concludes . &quot; His language is crude , abusive and profane , clearly violating God ' s standards for Christians. &quot; Such condemnation drives Scott up a wall . At a recent service , Scott groused that he is fed up with outsiders who have the nerve to question his conduct . &quot; They never stop ! &quot; Scott protested to loud applause . &quot; These judgmental asses ! &quot;</TEXT>
