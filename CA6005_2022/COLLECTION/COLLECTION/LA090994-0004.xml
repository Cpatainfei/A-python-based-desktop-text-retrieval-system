   <HEADLINE> KEVORKIAN CHALLENGES STATE LAW , SEEKS LICENSE REINSTATEMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dr. Jack Kevorkian -- the Michigan doctor dubbed &quot; Dr. Death &quot; for involvement in 20 suicides , including those of two Californians -- went_to court this week in Los Angeles , challenging the state ' s prohibition on physician-assisted suicide and seeking to have his medical license reinstated . In a set of lawsuits filed Wednesday in state and federal_courts , Kevorkian charged that the state statute making_it a crime for one person to help another commit suicide is unconstitutional . &quot; This irrational law tortures people instead of trying to relieve their suffering , &quot; the physician said in a prepared statement issued by his lawyer , Lawrence Silver . Kevorkian also challenged the revocation of his license to practice medicine in California . The Medical Board of California voted July 29 to revoke Kevorkian ' s medical license , citing the suicide of 44-year-old Orange County real_estate_agent Jonathon Grenz as evidence of Kevorkian ' s incompetence . Grenz was found to have cancer in 1992 , and doctors removed his voice_box and tongue . But at the time he committed suicide with Kevorkian ' s help , he had recovered from the cancer and was grieving over the loss of his mother , according to testimony from Grenz ' s friend Linda Healy , a Newport Beach real_estate_agent . Grenz was one of two Californians who journeyed last year to Michigan , where Kevorkian lives , so that the 65-year-old former pathologist could assist in their suicides , California Deputy Atty . Gen . Thomas Lazar told the medical board . The other , a 40-year-old cancer patient named Martha Ruwart of the San Diego County community of Cardiff by the Sea , took her own life at a home_in Waterford , Mich. , with Kevorkian by her side . In revoking the license , the state charged that Kevorkian had violated his Hippocratic oath and national medical ethics standards that ban physician-assisted suicides . Under state law , Kevorkian had 30 days in which to appeal the revocation of his license . Wednesday was the last_day in which he could go_to court , Silver said . The lawyer said the appeal is based on the argument that the state ban is unconstitutional and that California ' s decision to punish Kevorkian for an act committed in another state is an unlawful &quot; export &quot; of state law beyond jurisdictional boundaries . Neither Lazar nor representatives for the state medical board could be reached for comment . The state medical board now has 30 days in which to respond to the state court action and 20 days in which to respond to a twin complaint filed_in federal_court , Silver said .</TEXT>
