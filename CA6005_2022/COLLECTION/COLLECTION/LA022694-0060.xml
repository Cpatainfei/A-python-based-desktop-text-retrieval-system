   <TEXT> Riots broke_out across the Israeli-occupied West_Bank and Gaza Strip on Friday , leaving at least a dozen people dead , as Palestinians protested the dawn massacre by a Jewish settler of 48 Muslims as they prayed in a mosque in Hebron , south of Jerusalem . More_than 300 people were wounded throughout the day , scores during the massacre at the mosque and the rest in clashes that followed there , in other West_Bank towns , the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem ' s Old City , according to figures compiled from hospital reports . The day was the bloodiest in the occupied territories since Israel captured them during the 1967 Middle_East War , and the carnage put_in jeopardy the negotiations between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on limited Palestinian self-rule . Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin called the attack &quot; a loathsome criminal act of murder , &quot; and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat warned of &quot; a very negative backfire on the whole peace process. &quot; Baruch Goldstein , a Brooklyn-born physician in Kiryat Arba , an Israeli settlement on the outskirts of Hebron , burst into the Ibrahim Mosque in the Cave of the Patriarchs during the early morning service Friday and opened_fire on the more_than 600 Muslims praying there . The shrine is holy to both Jews and Muslims as the burial place of Abraham . Methodically reloading his assault_rifle with extra magazines , Goldstein fired for more_than 10 minutes , according to witnesses , and killed or wounded more_than a third of the congregation , including a number of children . Unchecked by the five Israeli soldiers guarding the shrine , Goldstein was finally subdued by survivors and beaten to death with an iron bar , witnesses said . Anticipating his likely death , Goldstein had left a farewell note at the Kiryat Arba municipal offices , declaring his &quot; love of Israel. &quot; Active in the extremist Kach movement , Goldstein had apparently come_to view Palestinians as &quot; Arab Nazis &quot; determined to destroy Israel . &quot; We were in the midst of the prayers when I heard shots and saw the head of the man in front of me explode , &quot; said Hamad abu Shareh , 52 , a hardware_store owner . &quot; Then I saw others hit -- in their backs , in their heads , in their chests as they turned -- and blood was spraying everywhere . &quot; As I turned , I saw this Jew with a kippa ( skullcap ) , a black beard like those that settlers wear and in an army uniform , and he was firing and firing and firing , using his gun like a hose. &quot; Suleiman abu Saleh , 33 , the guard of the mosque , said the gunman &quot; was trying to kill as_many as possible . He would fire until his ( ammunition clip ) was empty , come_out and reload and go_in again to fire. &quot; After the attack , Rabin telephoned Arafat to express his sorrow . &quot; As an Israeli , I am ashamed of this deed , &quot; he told the PLO leader . &quot; This is a difficult day for all those , Jews and Arabs , who seek peace , &quot; Rabin said in a statement . &quot; However , the crazed actions of disturbed individuals will not prevent the reconciliations between citizens of the state of Israel and the Palestinian people . &quot; We will do everything necessary to advance the peace talks , to prevent misunderstandings , to remove obstacles in the way and to reach , together , the day of peace -- the day on which extremists on both sides will lose all hope of damaging the peace process. &quot; Palestinian leaders in reply demanded that Rabin disarm the 130 # 000 Israeli settlers in the West_Bank and Gaza Strip , pull his forces_out of the areas that will become autonomous under the peace accord and accelerate the transition to self-rule . The PLO also called_for an international peacekeeping force for the region . &quot; This atrocity proves there is no need to defend the settlers from the Palestinians but a need to defend the Palestinians from the settlers , &quot; said Faisal Husseini , the principal PLO figure on the West_Bank . He warned that the Hebron massacre would have &quot; a very negative impact &quot; on the peace talks . At an emergency Cabinet meeting in Tel Aviv , dovish ministers from Rabin ' s Labor_Party and its leftist partner , Meretz , also called_for disarming the settlers , outlawing Kach and other extreme right-wing groups , dismantling Israeli settlements in and around Hebron and pulling Israeli forces_back to their bases to avoid further clashes . Rabin ordered that Kiryat Arba residents not be allowed to enter or leave their community without military permission , and he put Jewish residents of Hebron under round-the-clock curfew ; he said he will consider the other suggestions over the weekend and raise them at the regular Cabinet meeting Sunday . &quot; I warned for months that eventually something like this ( massacre ) would happen , &quot; said Immigration Minister Yair Tsaban , a Meretz member , renewing his demand that Kach be banned . &quot; The writing was_on the wall. &quot; Kach leaders praised Goldstein as a &quot; holy hero who was killed for the glory of God. &quot; &quot; Dr. Goldstein , a Jew who treated dozens of victims of Arab terror with his sympathetic hands , saw and felt every day the savagery of the Arabs who wounded and murdered Jews whose only sin was their Jewishness , &quot; the group said , accusing the Rabin government of failing to protect settlers . Baruch Marzel , a Kach leader who lives_in Hebron , added , &quot; We would have been a lot happier with the whole_thing if Dr. Goldstein , a righteous man , was not killed . With him dead , we cannot be happy. &quot; The slain Palestinians &quot; were not innocent , &quot; Marzel said , accusing them of being in the crowd Thursday evening that had chanted &quot; Death to the Jews &quot; during services at the Cave of the Patriarchs marking the Jewish festival of Purim . In Kiryat Arba , the municipal council expressed its &quot; regret &quot; over the massacre but pointedly did not condemn the attack . &quot; The blame must be directed at the government of Israel and its head , Prime_Minister and Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin , who is abandoning security , ( leading to ) all_the unending acts of murder in Gaza , Judea and Samaria , especially since negotiations with the PLO began , &quot; the council said . Goldstein ' s friends in Kiryat Arba and Hebron suggested that the father of four had suffered an emotional breakdown after members of a fundamentalist Islamic group , Hamas , gunned_down a close friend , Mordechai Lapid , and his son in December . &quot; After the murders of the Lapid family , he was in crisis , a mental crisis , &quot; Noam Arnon said . &quot; We could see that this incident took him out of his normal balance. &quot; Several groups , all previously unknown , claimed in telephone_calls to Israeli and international news organizations that they had executed the attack . One said the intent was to drive Palestinians out of Hebron , another said it was to avenge the 1990 New York murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane , Kach ' s founder , and a third said it was a response to recent murders of settlers . But most Israelis , including those sympathetic to the settlers ' efforts to reclaim all_the territory that was part of the biblical Land of Israel , reacted with horror to the Hebron killings and the subsequent violence . Benjamin Netanyahu , leader of the opposition Likud Party , strongly condemned the attack as &quot; a terrifying and abominable crime. &quot; &quot; I call_for restraint by all ( in Hebron ) , Jews and Arabs , Muslims and Christians , everyone , &quot; he said . &quot; We are all sitting in the same boat . We cannot drill_holes in the bottom. &quot; Angry protests broke_out almost immediately in Hebron as relatives and friends besieged the city ' s two hospitals , townspeople said , and clashed with troops . One man was shot and killed by soldiers in front of one of the hospitals , according to the Palestine Human_Rights Information Center here . Three men were killed in refugee camps in the Gaza Strip , according to military sources , as troops sought to curtail protests . The region was closed by the Israeli military commander , preventing Palestinians from crossing into Israel . In Beit Jala , south of Jerusalem , settlers shot and killed a Palestinian after their bus was stoned . Two deaths were reported at the Kalandiyeh refugee camp north of Jerusalem , another in Nablus and four in a clash in Kufr Qaleel , a town south of Nablus . In Jerusalem , police battled rock-throwing Palestinian youths in the Old City for more_than six hours after midday prayers at Al Aqsa mosque . The clash began as youths pelted Jews praying below at the Western Wall of the old temple with rocks , driving them away . Police responded with volleys of tear-gas grenades and rubber bullets . An 18-year-old Palestinian was fatally wounded during police pursuit of demonstrators through the Old City ' s maze of narrow streets , alleys and stairways , and more_than 60 others were treated at Jerusalem hospitals for gunshot wounds and other injuries . In the Israeli town of Kfar Sava , an elderly American immigrant , Morris Eisenstat , 80 , a retired New York policeman and a member of Israel ' s volunteer civil guard , was hacked to death with an ax as he sat in the sun on his customary park_bench reading the paper .
