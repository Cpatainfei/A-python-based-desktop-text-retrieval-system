   <TEXT> CIVIL WARS From L.A. To Bosnia by Hans Magnus Enzensberger ( The New Press : $ 18 ; 144 pp. ) &quot; Violence has freed itself from ideology &quot; writes the poet Enzensberger , who was born in Nuremberg in 1929.According to him , civil_wars have several common_denominators , primarily &quot; the autistic nature of the perpetrators , and their inability to distinguish between destruction and self-destruction. &quot; Participants must be &quot; selfless , &quot; exhibiting what Freud called a &quot; death drive , &quot; and youth is &quot; the vanguard. &quot; Television and newspapers advertise civil_wars , with television depicted as a &quot; huge piece of graffiti , an artificial replacement for the autistically-shrunken ego. &quot; We ought to stay out of the affairs of other countries ; &quot; we ought to mop_up the civil_war in our own country. &quot; If you think that civil_wars have anything to do with &quot; hopeless economic situation ( s ) , &quot; you ' re wrong . Country by country , it ' s just a bunch of thugs with a death wish . Oddly , the book ends on this note : &quot; If the state refuses to protect them , threatened individuals or groups will have to arm themselves. &quot; This voice , so clearly the furious voice of an ordinarily gentle man , implodes in the end , condoning the very activity he ' s deplored throughout the book . It ' s the saddest ending of all .</TEXT>
