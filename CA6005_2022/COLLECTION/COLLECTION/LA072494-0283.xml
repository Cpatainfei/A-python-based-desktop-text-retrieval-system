   <HEADLINE> YELTSIN ADVISERS URGE 2-YEAR DELAY IN ELECTIONS ; RUSSIA : AIDES SAY SCHEDULED 1996 VOTE COULD BRING ZHIRINOVSKY TO POWER IN THE MIDST OF PAINFUL REFORMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Close advisers to President Boris N . Yeltsin are publicly urging that elections mandated by Russia ' s new constitution be postponed and that Yeltsin stay in office at least two years longer than his elected term . Holding presidential elections as scheduled in 1996 would be &quot; untimely and destabilizing , &quot; the advisers warn . To bolster their case , they flash the threat that holding elections in the midst of painful economic reforms could bring_to power neo-fascist lawmaker Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky or another would-be dictator . Parliamentary elections should also be postponed for two years to give the 6-month-old legislature more time to learn its business , advocates say . &quot; I would be very much surprised if elections were held_on schedule , &quot; one senior Moscow-based diplomat said . The Kremlin has kept a polite distance from the initiative . However , since its proponents include such Yeltsin loyalists as Vladimir F . Shumeiko , chairman of the upper house of Parliament , and former State Secretary Gennady E . Burbulis , the idea is presumed_to be a political trial_balloon floated with the president ' s approval . Taking_up the challenge , one pro-business parliamentary faction has promised to collect a_million signatures to hold a referendum on delaying elections -- although early polls show that public_opinion is against the idea . The proposal has already divided Russia ' s democratic forces and could threaten the delicate political stability that has been achieved in recent months . &quot; It ' s usurping power ; it ' s a step toward dictatorship , &quot; lawmaker Boris G . Fyodorov , the former reformist finance_minister , said last week in an interview in the cavernous halls of the Duma , or lower house of Parliament . &quot; The whole idea of democracy is at_issue , &quot; Fyodorov said . &quot; In one_thousand years , power has never changed hands in Russia in a democratic way . . . . Let ' s look_into the eyes of some democrats , like Mr. Yeltsin , and see what he really thinks_about democracy. &quot; Fyodorov himself vows to walk_out_of the Duma on Dec . 13 , 1995 -- the day on which his two-year term expires -- whatever transpires in the meantime . But he put the chances of the elections being postponed at &quot; 50-50 today , &quot; because both president and Parliament have a vested_interest in staying_put . &quot; Listen , 75 % of the people in this hall support it secretly , &quot; Fyodorov said in a comment echoed by many of his fellow lawmakers . &quot; These people are not democrats . They want to live_in Moscow , they want to get flats , they want to make connections , they want to get jobs here , enjoy privileges. &quot; Fyodorov also scoffed at the notion that Zhirinovsky , whose popularity already appears to be dropping , is likely to seize the presidency if elections are held_in 1996 . &quot; Zhirinovsky is an export item for the West , &quot; the economist said . &quot; We show him whenever we want some more money. &quot; However , the suggestion that elections be postponed is a political gold mine for Yeltsin ' s enemies . Reactionary filmmaker and parliamentarian Stanislav S . Govorukhin said last week that the president ' s men would hasten to delay because &quot; they have money , power , and no chance of winning democratic elections. &quot; The democratic forces ' abysmal showing in last December ' s elections , as well as the upset presidential victories last month of Alexander Lukashenko in Belarus and Leonid Kuchma in Ukraine , testify to the anti-incumbent sentiment sweeping the former Soviet_Union and make the idea of postponing elections more attractive to both president and lawmakers . Yeltsin has already postponed elections once . When he dissolved the old Supreme Soviet last September and called new parliamentary elections in an attempt to end the power struggle that had paralyzed Russian politics , Yeltsin promised to hold presidential elections this June . But after the bloody October revolt by hard-liners , Yeltsin abandoned that promise and said he would serve out his five-year term , which is to end in June , 1996 . At the time , President Clinton defended that decision , noting that Yeltsin had been elected by a huge margin in 1991 and had won a popular referendum on his policies in April , 1993 . It is not clear whether extending Yeltsin ' s term would raise the hackles of his Western backers -- especially if Parliament agreed to the deal . &quot; I don ' t think anybody cares , &quot; said Harley Balzer , director of the Russian Area Studies Program at Georgetown University in Washington . &quot; As long as it ' s not a nasty , saber-rattling police_state , I think we ' re willing to deal with all kinds of quasi-democracies . . . . &quot; There ' ll be a little hand-wringing but nothing major , &quot; he predicted . Yeltsin had also repeatedly promised that he would be a one-term president . But in March his spokesman , Vyacheslav V . Kostikov , said the public may demand that Yeltsin run again in 1996 . Despite the 63-year-old Siberian ' s admitted bouts of depression and back pain -- and unsubstantiated rumors of more serious ailments -- Yeltsin remains the most popular politician in Russia , and perhaps the only one with the charisma to bring a semblance of unity to this fragmented giant land . Possible candidates to succeed him include Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin , economist Grigory A . Yavlinsky , Zhirinovsky , Communist_Party leader Gennady A . Zyuganov , Deputy Prime_Minister Sergei M . Shakhrai , ousted Vice_President Alexander V . Rutskoi and Moscow Mayor Yuri M . Luzhkov . Burbulis , Yeltsin ' s old friend and adviser , proposed last week that the president stay in office until 1998 but promise not to run_for reelection after that . &quot; Elections in 1996 will be untimely and destabilizing and will add no democracy to the country , &quot; Burbulis said . The idea is a sure winner with Yeltsin ' s powerful Kremlin entourage , which will lose its power and perquisites when its meal ticket retires . &quot; What we have is a ' nomenklatura democracy , ' &quot; said political analyst Andrei V . Kortunov of Moscow ' s USA and Canada Institute . &quot; The new political elites are trying to consolidate their positions , and they don ' t want to risk having elections . The question is whether they will be able to reach consensus amongst themselves. &quot; According to the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper , Kremlin strategists have already drafted a memo entitled , &quot; On possible steps to stabilize the situation in Russia , &quot; which scripts a scenario for postponing both presidential and parliamentary elections . The first_step was taken last month , when Shumeiko announced that the president and Parliament had already agreed &quot; in principle &quot; to postpone parliamentary elections from 1995 to 1997 . Yeltsin spokesman Kostikov called the idea &quot; interesting , but debatable. &quot; &quot; Russia is tired_of the acute political fever , &quot; Kostikov said . &quot; More_than anything else it now needs to preserve peace. &quot; However , Duma Speaker Ivan Rybkin , who initially was quoted as favoring the idea , changed his mind after hearing the howls from constitutional purists , who called such a deal &quot; immoral. &quot; Two days later , Yeltsin ' s chief_of_staff said the president does not favor postponing parliamentary elections , because it would give the impression that politicians are trying to hold_on to power . Yeltsin has not commented on the_matter . The Kremlin memo calls_for &quot; initiating debate on this suggestion this summer and creating an atmosphere of support &quot; through speeches and statements of regional leaders , according to Nezavisimaya Gazeta . In September , all_the parliamentary factions that signed Yeltsin ' s treaty of civic accord will be asked to support postponing the elections . As an amendment to the constitution , such a move would require approval by three-quarters of the Duma and two-thirds of the Federation Council , the upper chamber of Parliament -- a difficult majority to muster . If the measure does not receive enough votes , it will be decided at a referendum in spring , 1995 , the Kremlin memo reportedly says . &quot; Maybe the majority of Russians will find the proposal to give_up their democratic principles for the sake of stability quite convincing , &quot; the newspaper said sadly . A new poll shows that the Kremlin is in_for a tough fight , however . The July 15 survey of 4 # 000 Russians in eight regions found 65 % were opposed to extending Yeltsin ' s term , and only 23 % favored the idea . Those surveyed were slightly more sympathetic to the newly elected Parliament , but only 29 % of those polled favored extending its mandate , while 41 % were opposed , and the rest were undecided .</TEXT>
