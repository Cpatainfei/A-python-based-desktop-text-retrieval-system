   <HEADLINE> GUN EXCHANGES CATCH_ON -- BUT ARE THEY EFFECTIVE ? ; WEAPONS : NEW YORK ' S FIREARMS-FOR-MERCHANDISE PLAN WILL BE TRIED IN L.A. SKEPTICS DOUBT IT WILL CUT CRIME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Guns were good for concert tickets last month . In the near future they might be exchangeable for sneakers , boots , toys , jeans and even cars . Amid mounting frustration with the urban arms race , a new gun_control technique has emerged in Los Angeles and nationwide that sidesteps the legislative process and plucks guns off the streets one by one . The gun exchanges are rounding_up firearms by the hundreds -- 412 over a five-day period in Los Angeles last month , 68 in one day in Oakland and more_than 1 # 000 so far in a guns-for-toys program in the gritty 34th Precinct of New York City . Representatives from the National Assn . for the Advancement of Colored People joined top Los Angeles officials Tuesday in announcing that New York City ' s version , which started with $ 100 gift certificates for toys and has grown to include other merchandise , will be expanding to Los Angeles in the coming months . &quot; Kids are killing other kids for things they need , &quot; said Fernando Mateo , a carpet store owner who spearheaded the New York program . &quot; We need people who have weapons to look_at that weapon and say , ' I ' m going_to exchange this for something I need. ' &quot; Organizers said that Toys R Us and Foot Locker have already agreed to join the proposed &quot; guns-for-goods &quot; project . During a news_conference Tuesday , they sought to persuade other companies , from McDonald ' s to the Gap , to sign_on . The gun swaps come as Washington is also grappling with the gun issue . The White_House proposed a huge increase in licensing_fees for gun dealers Tuesday and Congress recently imposed a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases . Some congressional leaders are also pressing for a ban on assault weapons and stiffer sentences for criminals who use guns . Some experts who study violence describe the gun exchanges as one small step_in the right direction , while others dismiss the swaps as little more_than publicity stunts in a county where one in five people owns a gun . &quot; Something is better than nothing , &quot; said Ronald K . Barrett , a professor at Loyola Marymount University who studies homicidal violence . &quot; In a small way it will contribute something to moving us in the direction we should be going . But it ' s not going_to solve the problem completely. &quot; Barrett likened the exchanges to other peripheral efforts to reduce violence -- such_as the announcements by radio_stations that they will not play violent rap songs and efforts to reduce the amount of violence on television and in the movies . The exchanges attract huge amounts of attention to the issue of guns -- there were 15 television_cameras at Tuesday ' s news_conference in City_Hall -- and that helps the fight against violence , other observers said . &quot; Is this the best way to approach the problem ? Of course not , &quot; said Malcolm W . Klein , director of the USC Center for Research on Crime and Social_Control . &quot; But is this a step ? Yes . It ' s making a statement . It ' s saying that getting guns off the streets matters_to us. &quot; At the Pueblo del Rio Housing Project , which Mateo and others toured to gauge community sentiment , many residents expressed skepticism . Shortly before the officials arrived , a mail_carrier had been robbed by a man armed with a shotgun . &quot; You have to have a gun around here , &quot; said Lamont Gooden , 35 , who keeps a . 357 magnum for protection . &quot; The criminals aren ' t going_to turn_in their guns . They ' d be thrilled if all_of us innocent people weren ' t armed. &quot; Gooden said there is no way he would turn_in his gun for tickets , jeans or toys . He said he might consider surrendering the weapon for a full refund of his $ 200 purchase_price . Then , he said , he would go_out and buy another . Matthew Brown , one of the tenant leaders at Pueblo del Rio , said he doubts there will be an outpouring of guns among those in the projects who rely_on guns for safety and know the value of their guns on the street . &quot; You have to guarantee these people ' s safety , &quot; Brown told Mateo and Benjamin F . Chavis , executive_director of the NAACP . &quot; If they are going_to give_up their protection , what are you going_to give them ? &quot; Gun exchanges are not new , although the idea has received a burst of renewed interest in recent months . Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti , Police_Chief Willie L . Williams and Mayor Richard Riordan have all embraced the concept in the past month . In recent years , numerous police_departments across the country have held brief amnesty programs to round_up guns from those who might otherwise be reluctant to surrender them . Small monetary incentives were sometimes included . During the Los Angeles mayor ' s race in 1989 , Councilman Nate Holden pledged to buy back military-style assault weapons for $ 300 apiece . A radio_station then offered a $ 1 # 000 reward to the first_person to surrender such a weapon . At the time , even though more_than 100 Uzis and AK-47s would be eventually collected , some dismissed the buyback as a publicity stunt . &quot; It ' s spitballs at battleships , &quot; said then-Mayor Tom Bradley ' s spokeswoman , Dee Dee Myers , who dismissed the plan as a &quot; distraction ( from ) the real solution. &quot; Myers is now President Clinton ' s spokeswoman . Last month ' s guns-for-tickets swap in Los Angeles -- which brought_in 110 rifles , 251 handguns , two assault_rifles and 49 shotguns -- was declared a success by top police officials . Williams is reviewing the results before deciding whether to sponsor a similar effort . But some officers grumbled that it was primarily law-abiding citizens with extra weapons lying_around who turned them in . The criminal element stayed home . The New York program began when Mateo ' s 14-year-old son told his father that he would give_up his Christmas_gifts if he could get someone to surrender a single gun . Mateo bought_up $ 5 # 000 worth of Toys R Us gift certificates but then the concept caught_on and numerous other benefactors came aboard . New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani even kicked_in $ 5 # 000 of his campaign money for the effort . Now , gun donors get their choice of a $ 100 gift certificate from Kaybee Toys , Foot Locker , Dial-a-Mattress or Toys R Us . After the program expands citywide , organizers in New York hope to increase the incentive still further by raffling_off a car to donors . * GUN LICENSE FEE : Treasury_secretary urges tenfold increase for dealers .
