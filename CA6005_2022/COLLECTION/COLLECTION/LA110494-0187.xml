   <HEADLINE> SHUTTLE LIFTS OFF ; ASTRONAUTS BEGIN STUDYING ATMOSPHERE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Space shuttle Atlantis and its six astronauts blasted into orbit Thursday and quickly began surveying Earth ' s atmosphere , including the ozone_layer and its gaping hole over the Antarctic . The weather at the shuttle emergency_landing site in Morocco improved enough to allow Atlantis to lift_off at 9 a.m. PST . &quot; The Earth looks just as beautiful as it always did , &quot; commander Donald McMonagle said upon reaching orbit . By Thursday evening , the five Americans and one Frenchman aboard had begun atmospheric observations from their 190-mile-high orbit . The shuttle holds seven instruments from the United States and Europe that will scour the stratosphere for ozone and other chemicals and examine solar_energy during the 11-day voyage . Scientists are particularly interested in the ozone_hole over the Antarctic that forms every fall . The hole is 9 million square_miles this year , about the size of North_America . To study the hole , the shuttle will fly just below Cape Horn , at the tip of South_America . The ozone_layer is essential to life on Earth . It protects humans and other organisms from the sun ' s ultraviolet rays . The mission is the seventh and final shuttle flight of the year , but the first by Atlantis since 1992 . The ship underwent extensive modifications , including installation of wiring needed for Atlantis to dock with Russia ' s space_station Mir next May . Atlantis also is carrying a German satellite with infrared telescopes for studying the atmosphere . The astronauts locked onto the satellite with the shuttle robot arm Thursday for a system check ; they were startled to discover increasing pressure in a helium tank on the spacecraft . &quot; We ' re keeping a close eye on this , &quot; Mission Control said . The crew is supposed to release the satellite today and retrieve it eight days later .</TEXT>
