   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA SMOKING BAN EFFECTIVE MONDAY ; LAW : THE ORDINANCE WILL AFFECT MOST PEOPLE WHO WORK INDOORS , THOUGH RESTAURANTS , BARS AND SMALL BUSINESSES GET SOME LEEWAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Workers taking cigarette breaks here will have to go outside beginning Monday when the city ' s new smoking law goes_into effect . The hotly debated tobacco control ordinance , approved by the Santa Clarita City_Council in June , bans smoking at most indoor job sites . It also prohibits cigarette vending_machines in the workplace . But restaurants , bars and small businesses were given some leeway under the new law . Restaurants and bars may establish their own smoking policies as long as they are posted for customers . Any small business that is operated away from the public and that doesn ' t share its ventilation_system with another office may set its own policy as well . Copies of the ordinance , with an explanatory letter from Mayor George Pederson , have been mailed to Santa Clarita ' s two chambers_of_commerce and the business association that represents the Valencia Industrial Center . &quot; It is important that each business understand completely the requirements included within the ordinance before it becomes effective , &quot; Pederson said . &quot; We don ' t want there to be any misunderstanding. &quot; Although the ordinance has been debated in Santa Clarita for several months , city officials don ' t expect an uproar when it goes_into effect . &quot; We went_through a lot of public participation to come_up with a plan the people in the city want , &quot; said Ken Pulskamp , assistant city_manager . * The regulation is less restrictive than one the City_Council nearly put_in place seven months ago . Council_members had approved a ban in December that applied to restaurants as well , with few people having come_forward either to support or oppose the ban . The issue was reopened when nearly 200 people packed the council_chambers in January -- some calling smoking a health issue and supporting the ban and others saying businesses ' rights were being infringed upon and opposing it . Six months of subsequent public meetings uncovered support for smoking controls by many residents , but also complaints from restaurant owners that customers might go_to eating establishments in the unincorporated county area where they can smoke . But the law governing restaurants and bars may change Jan . 1 because of state legislation . Earlier this month , Gov . Pete Wilson signed a statewide smoking prohibition that affects virtually all enclosed workplaces , including restaurants . All cities and counties will be affected by the state ban , removing the complaint that patrons might avoid one restaurant to eat_in another that allows smoking . Santa Clarita ' s ordinance will be replaced when the state ban takes_effect Jan . 1 , unless California voters approve a softer ordinance put_on the November ballot by cigarette maker Philip Morris Inc. The measure , Proposition 188 , would allow all businesses to set their own smoking policies .</TEXT>
