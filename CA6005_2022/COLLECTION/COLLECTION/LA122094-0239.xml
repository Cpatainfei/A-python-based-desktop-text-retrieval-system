   <HEADLINE> EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : THOUSAND OAKS ; TELLER SUES OVER BANK HOLDUP POLICY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A former teller at a Bank of America in Thousand Oaks has filed a lawsuit against the bank , saying its policy of giving_out as little money as possible during holdups endangered her life during an armed robbery a year ago . In the suit filed_in Ventura County Superior_Court , Suzanne Schneider said she thought she was going_to be killed when the operations manager at her bank repeatedly gave a robber less money than he asked_for during a Dec . 15 , 1993 , holdup . The unidentified robber pointed a gun at Schneider throughout the holdup , and he threatened to kill her and two other tellers when the manager gave him less cash than he demanded , the suit said . The complaint says Schneider later was told of a bank policy to give_out as little cash as possible in a robbery , meaning that &quot; the lives of bank employees . . . were to be bargained away in_order to conserve funds. &quot; News_reports at the time said the robbery occurred at the Bank of America on Lindero Canyon Road . The robber handed a teller a checkbook that contained a note saying : &quot; This is a robbery . I want $ 20 # 000 in $ 100 bills . Don ' t push the alarm. &quot; Schneider ' s lawsuit said the manager twice went_into the bank ' s vault to get the man cash . Schneider says she has suffered from anxiety and panic_attacks since the robbery and is unable to enter a bank for any reason , even to conduct personal_business . The suit alleges that Schneider was denied her request for another job at the bank . It also says a bank-paid psychiatrist called Schneider several times at her home and demanded that she return to work . Schneider is seeking unspecified damages for infliction of emotional distress . Bank officials could not be reached for comment . BARBARA MURPHY</TEXT>
