   <HEADLINE> LAWYERS THREATEN TO TAKE RIGHTS DISPUTE TO CAIRO STREETS ; EGYPT : THE DEATH IN CUSTODY OF AN ISLAMIC ATTORNEY AND DETENTIONS OF DOZENS MORE SPARK DEMAND FOR INVESTIGATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Abdel Harith Madani had made a name for himself as a young Islamic lawyer , defending clients accused of battling to overthrow the government of Egypt and successfully challenging a public_school ban on young_women wearing the black face veil of strict Islamic modesty . He had also experienced more_than his share of scrapes with police in his native village in southern Egypt , getting himself arrested a_few years ago for trying to keep mourners out of graveyards , a practice viewed_as pagan by Islamic fundamentalists . Then , on April 26 , more_than a dozen police_officers stormed Madani ' s law offices , searched his files and led him , blindfolded , back to his tiny apartment in the dusty slums of Qunaissa near the foot of the Pyramids . There they searched him again . Then they took the 32-year-old lawyer away . His wife heard nothing more until May 6 , when the police phoned and told her to collect her husband ' s body . His coffin had been sealed . His grave has since been put_under armed police guard . Authorities say Madani died of an asthma_attack . His family and colleagues say he was tortured to death . The dispute threatens to unfold on the streets of Cairo today , when thousands of lawyers , who paralyzed the Egyptian courts in a nationwide strike Sunday , have threatened to rally to demand a full investigation and the release of 34 of their colleagues detained in Egypt ' s prisons without charge or trial . While countries like China and Haiti are receiving the bulk of recent U.S. expressions of concern about human_rights , Egypt -- America ' s key Arab partner in the Middle_East peace process -- has quietly arrested 20 # 000 to 30 # 000 political_prisoners , activists here say . They say the Egyptians have executed more_than 35 convicted extremists after widely criticized military trials since 1992 and launched a law_enforcement crackdown against Islamic terrorism . It has led to the deaths of dozens of suspects in blazing raids on their hide-outs . Almost every major human_rights group in the world has criticized Egypt ' s widespread use in its prisons of torture and inhumane treatment , including dog attacks , rape , electric_shock and reports of filthy water being injected into prisoners . Lawyers for the fundamentalist-controlled Egyptian Lawyers Syndicate say their own interviews with doctors who examined Madani found signs that he had been subjected_to electric_shocks , hit on the head and hanged by the feet . His case is by no means the first in which a professional has died in police custody . But because Madani was a lawyer for Islamic fundamentalists , the stage has been set for a confrontation between the government and one of Egypt ' s largest professional_associations . The controversy also underscores the government ' s increasing suspicion of lawyers who represent Islamic extremist defendants . It raises many issues similar to those that have long dogged American lawyers who represent those in organized_crime : Are they merely defending suspects accused of extreme crimes ? Or are they acting_as the legal facade for organizations banned because of their determination to overthrow the government and install an Islamic state in Egypt ? A hint of what may be in_store today -- if the planned protest here occurs -- arose Sunday , when truckloads of riot police surrounded the lawyers syndicate headquarters and prepared at one point to lob tear_gas into the courtyard as angry demonstrators shouted : &quot; What a shame ! The Interior Ministry is run_by a donkey ! &quot; Under Egypt ' s controversial 13-year-old state of emergency -- in place since the 1981 assassination of President Anwar Sadat by Islamic extremists -- virtually all public demonstrations are illegal . Protests are quickly , often violently , curtailed . &quot; This is not negotiation . This is not bargaining . We will go_out into the streets unless the state complies with our request . We will face security , even if it meets us with bullets , &quot; declared Mokhtar Noah , a prominent Islamic lawyer who is leading the campaign for an investigation into Madani ' s death . The Interior Ministry , the agency responsible_for internal security in Egypt and overseer of its police_forces , has said Madani developed breathing difficulties and fainted during a search of his second home . He was taken_to the prison ward of a hospital in downtown Cairo , where he died of respiratory failure linked to asthma . He &quot; died of an asthma_attack , and it has nothing to do with torture , &quot; Interior Minister Hassan Alfi said . The government says Madani was acting_as a conduit between imprisoned members of the Gamaa al Islamiya , the outlawed Islamic Group , and their terrorist agents outside . It said Madani is believed to have received more_than $ 15 # 000 from the alleged leader of the Gamaa ' s military wing , Talaat Yassin Hammam . Hammam , sentenced to death in absentia in a case involving several former fighters in the Afghanistan civil_war , was killed along with six colleagues during a dawn raid on his hide-out at dawn on the day before Madani ' s arrest . But Kamel Khaled , a lawyer and member_of_Parliament , said Madani had recently been trying to negotiate a truce between Gamaa al Islamiya and the government . Khaled said Madani ' s message was that the group had realized it was being manipulated by countries outside Egypt and was ready to call a truce .</TEXT>
