   <TEXT> Holiday Cheers and Jeers : The five-day Thanksgiving holiday weekend is far from over , but Universal Pictures may have reason for indigestion . Its new comedy , &quot; Junior , &quot; starring Arnold Schwarzenegger , Danny DeVito and Emma Thompson , appears to have stumbled out of the starting_gate . After two days of release ( Wednesday and Thursday ) , the Ivan Reitman-directed film about a man who becomes pregnant is running in fourth place behind films that have been playing for weeks . In first place so far is Disney ' s Tim Allen holiday comedy , &quot; The Santa Clause , &quot; which had two-day grosses approaching $ 7 million . In second place is Paramount ' s &quot; Star Trek : Generations , &quot; followed by Warner Bros. ' &quot; Interview With the Vampire. &quot; Industry sources say that &quot; Junior , &quot; which is playing_on fewer screens than the top three , still could climb higher as moviegoers finish_off their leftovers and venture out for the long holiday . Still , they note , the film will likely not be a blockbuster as some had predicted , perhaps because Schwarzenegger is not playing his usual action-filled role . The total five-day weekend gross could beat_out the biggest Thanksgiving holiday weekend take ever , 1992 ' s $ 134 million . Last year , movies brought_in $ 106 million for the period . CLASSICAL MUSIC Vatican Recordings : Previously unknown solo recordings by famed Polish pianist Mieczyslaw Horszowski , who died in 1993 at the age of 100 , have been released in a two-CD anthology by the label Pearl Gemm . The selections , including an hourlong 1940 recital from the Vatican , coupled with live American recitals from 1957-1979 , represent some of the virtuoso ' s earliest known recorded performances . The recordings , miraculously saved from a Vatican trash_heap , were discovered after Horszowski ' s death , when his wife , Bice , 61 , uncovered a diary dating_back to 1940 and detailing the pianist ' s Vatican recital for Pope Pius XII . The diary also revealed that Horszowski had made recordings for Vatican Radio . The Vatican later acknowledged that it had the recording , and that the tape had been saved from a trash_heap a year earlier when a visiting musician happened to notice it and pleaded that it be saved .
