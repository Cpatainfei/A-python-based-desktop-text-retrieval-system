   <HEADLINE> HOPSCOTCH PATTERN OF DESTRUCTION IS FOUND ; AFTERMATH : QUAKE CAUSES $ 1 BILLION IN DAMAGE TO VALLEY STRUCTURES . SOME AREAS ARE RELATIVELY UNSCATHED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Northridge earthquake created a hopscotch pattern of destruction , hammering neighborhoods as far away as Sherman Oaks but sparing densely packed rows of apartment_buildings much closer to the epicenter . Altogether , the quake caused more_than $ 1 billion in structural damage to the San Fernando Valley , half of the estimated total citywide . About 5 # 300 Valley structures were damaged , including 3 # 600 single-family homes , 285 condominium buildings , 842 apartment_buildings and about 570 non-residential structures , according to city records . But some communities fared much better than others . Damage estimates in adjacent ZIP_codes vary dramatically throughout the Valley , according to a Times computer analysis of Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety lists of structures rendered unsafe , or safe only for limited use . Why the damage was greater in some neighborhoods miles farther from the epicenter is the big question facing scientists . &quot; Those questions will be answered , but you must be patient , &quot; said Mihailo Trifunac , a USC professor of civil_engineering . &quot; Obviously , the damage was where the motion was severe. &quot; Building construction , soils , geography -- even luck -- may account_for wide differences in damage suffered by Valley neighborhoods during the Jan . 17 earthquake . Trifunac said there may also be some discrepancies in the damage estimates because of differences in judgment among city inspectors . Many were hired temporarily from municipalities across the country to help tally the damage . Even so , scientists say it may take months or years to understand why the 6.8-magnitude earthquake caused at least $ 160 million in damage to Sherman Oaks , but only a tenth as much to high-density neighborhoods east of the San Diego Freeway and much closer to the earthquake ' s epicenter . The communities of North Hills , Panorama City , Arleta and Van Nuys -- identified by ZIP_codes 91343 , 91402 , 91405 , 91411 and 91401 -- were not even among the 20 hardest hit in the Valley , although the areas are much closer to the quake ' s epicenter than Sherman Oaks . With few exceptions , the neighborhoods north of Magnolia Boulevard and east of the San Diego Freeway were spared the worst damage . As expected , the most destruction was in Northridge , where building inspectors have so far estimated a total repair cost of $ 163 million to homes and businesses in the 91324 and 91325 ZIP_codes . At least $ 150 million more will be needed to fix buildings on the Cal State Northridge campus , bringing the Northridge damage total to more_than $ 300 million . But less than two miles east of CSUN , in the North Hills ZIP_code of 91343 , damage is estimated to be under $ 10 million . About three miles north of CSUN , however , in the Granada Hills ZIP_code of 91344 , damage has been estimated to be more_than $ 70 million . Thomas L . Henyey , a geology professor at USC ' s Southern California Earthquake Center , said one reason the quake may have caused such havoc in Sherman Oaks is because of proximity to the Santa Monica Mountains . The amplification effect of thinning sediments may be to blame , he said . The closer to the mountains , the thinner the underlying sediment , causing the force of the earthquake to become more focused , he said . The result , usually , is more shaking on the surface . But Henyey said more information is needed to explain the pattern of destruction . &quot; A whole variety of factors cause the ground to shake differently ; the force doesn ' t radiate evenly , &quot; he said . &quot; As the waves travel through the earth , it is like a hall of mirrors and lenses , where forces can be focused and defocused , amplified in certain places. &quot; Damage in the 91367 ZIP_code of Woodland Hills is estimated to approach $ 30 million . But south of Ventura Boulevard in the same area , in neighboring ZIP_code 91364 , city inspectors estimate about $ 10 million in damage . Encino neighborhoods in the 91436 and 91316 ZIP_codes escaped , in comparison to Sherman Oaks , with only $ 6 million in damage . But Tarzana ' s 91356 , just west , sustained an estimated $ 13 million in damage . Also hard hit was the Chatsworth ZIP_code of 91311 , the high-tech industrial center of the Valley , with nearly $ 50 million in damage . As a result , many research and development firms there are fleeing to available space in eastern Ventura County , said Jeffrey M . Woolf , vice_president of Beitler commercial realty services . &quot; I predict that most would come_back , but some won ' t , &quot; Woolf said . David Keim , principal inspector for the Department of Building and Safety , said that for all_the damage to buildings -- totaling about 61 # 000 structures -- only half_a_dozen or so buildings have been ordered demolished . But about 11 # 000 structures citywide have sustained enough damage to warrant immediate repair , city records show . About 9 # 000 of those are posted with yellow notices , which allow limited use , and 2 # 000 have red notices , which means that they are unsafe to enter . Commercial buildings account_for 1 # 000 of the yellow-tagged buildings and about 500 of the red , Keim said . &quot; In most cases , even red-tagged buildings are , in fact , repairable , &quot; Keim said . &quot; The variable will be cost . Owners have to decide whether it is worth it. &quot; So far , the city has issued 26 permits to rebuild , 848 to repair and 28 to demolish as a result of the earthquake , according to a report issued Monday by the Department of Building and Safety . Richard O ' Reilly , director of computer analysis for The Times , assisted with this story . * VALLEY BRIEFING : A map breaks_down Valley destruction by community .
