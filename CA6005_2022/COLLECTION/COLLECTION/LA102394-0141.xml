   <HEADLINE> SOMETHING FOR SINGLE PEOPLE TO CHEW ON . . . ; FOOD : WHEN YOU LIVE ALONE , IT ' S EASY TO DISREGARD A HEALTHY DIET . BUT A LITTLE CONTROL AND SOME WORK CAN MAKE_GOOD NUTRITION A PART OF YOUR DAILY LIFE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You eat a light lunch and get home late from work . You ' re tired and famished , so you grab dinner -- cheese , crackers and a_couple_of glasses of wine . And since you live alone and nobody ' s looking . . . well , what the heck , why not polish_off the pint of Cherry Garcia ? Many people who live_by themselves find it difficult to shop , cook and pay_attention to good nutrition . As a result , single people sometimes have the tendency to overeat , says Melanie Polk , nutritionist with the American Institute for Cancer Research . &quot; Nobody ' s watching . The only person they have to account_for is themselves , which for some people is a real problem. &quot; Others eat while reading or watching television -- good for keeping you company but bad for mindless bingeing . &quot; If you ' re not paying_attention , you could down 500 to 1 # 000 calories without tasting a bite , &quot; says Katherine Tallmadge , a Washington , D.C. dietitian . &quot; You also don ' t get the psychological satisfaction of eating a meal. &quot; As a result , Tallmadge encourages her single clients to turn_off the TV and put_down the paper when they eat dinner . &quot; When you eat , sit_down , take a_few deep breaths and relax. &quot; What ' s more , some go-it-aloners eat_out of loneliness . Food is comfort , company and a reward . Tallmadge advises her clients to seek_out non-food rewards every day . It could be any activity that makes you feel good , even if it lasts only a_few minutes , says Tallmadge . Watch a sunset , take a bath , talk to a friend , flip through a favorite magazine . But when the going gets_tough , just remember that living alone has many dietary advantages . &quot; If you think living alone is hard , &quot; says Polk , &quot; just think_about how hard it would be if you had a saboteur offering you the choice of going_out for a hot fudge sundae. &quot; Single people also have more control over their schedules and mealtimes . &quot; You don ' t have a husband who ' s going_out for a business meeting or a kid with emergency band practice , &quot; she says . So take_advantage of it , stresses Polk . Plan ahead . Do a weekly shopping trip . Make healthful selections . &quot; Otherwise , eating becomes haphazard , and when that happens , it ' s an invitation to disaster. &quot; Here are some quick tips from Polk and others for avoiding disaster : * Have a snack late in the afternoon . If you eat lunch between noon and 1:30 , no wonder you ' re starving by dinner time . Buy a piece of fruit from a street vendor and eat it at 4 or 5 or just before you leave work . Then you won ' t walk in the house hungry enough to eat the rugs . * Control portions of carryout and delivery food . Out of sight , out of mind . Before you eat the whole pizza , freeze half of it . &quot; Manage what you ' re eating , rather than let the food manage you , &quot; says Polk . * Explore foods that are perfect for one serving . Microwave a giant sweet_potato . Top a salmon steak with lemon pepper . Combine tortellini with frozen vegetables ( keep a big bag of vegetables in the freezer , and take_out just what you need ) ; boil together and serve with a little marinara sauce or grated Parmesan . Make a French_bread pizza : Split a baguette and spread with sauce , low-fat cheese and sliced mushrooms ; cook in the toaster oven . Use the salad_bar for making stir-fries , or add a small can of tuna to the bean or pasta_salads . * Eat breakfast for dinner . There ' s nothing wrong with having cereal and fruit for dinner , says Rosemary Clifford , wellness coordinator of International Telecommunications Satellite Consortium ' s health promotion program . And don ' t forget about pancakes . Serve them with sliced bananas and blueberry syrup , or plain with a side_dish of apples , sauteed in a non-stick pan with a dash of vanilla and cinnamon .
