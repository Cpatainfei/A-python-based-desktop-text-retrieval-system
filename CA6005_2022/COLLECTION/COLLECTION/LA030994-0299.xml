   <HEADLINE> O.C. CALIFORNIA LEARNING ASSESSMENT SYSTEM SCORES ; SCHOOL TESTS : A GUIDE TO TABLES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The performance of California public_schools and their students is being measured in a new way . Students still take a test given statewide , but there are some major differences from past tests . For the first time , student work is being compared to new standards in reading , writing and math . The standards are intentionally high , and the same for all schools -- rich and poor , whether in Los Angeles or Anaheim or Salinas . Tests are no longer mainly multiple choice and scored by machine . They include open-ended questions and require students to write their answers . Scoring is done_by panels of trained teachers . The California Learning Assessment System , or CLAS , was developed by the state_Department of Education , which released the results to school districts and posted them electronically on America OnLine and Compuserve . California Learning Assessment System tests were given to almost every fourth- , eighth- and 10th-grader last spring . The first results are being released today . ( Main story , A1. ) HOW TO FIND YOUR SCHOOL As a public_service , The Times is publishing the results for local schools . * To look_up scores for your district , begin with the grade level . Turn_to B4 for fourth grade , B6 for eighth grade and B7 for 10th grade . Districts are listed alphabetically by grade in reverse type . Schools follow in alphabetical order . District totals have been omitted when there was only one school at that grade level in the district . HOW TO READ THE RESULTS After locating the school , begin at the center column of the table under the category &quot; Score. &quot; This center column shows the scale ( 1-6 ) used to score student performance in each subject . Six ( 6 ) , at the top , indicates the highest level of performance . One ( 1 ) , at the bottom , is the lowest score . The three columns on the left of the table show the percentage of students at the school who achieved each score in three categories : R ( reading ) , W ( writing ) and M ( math ) . Read the columns vertically under each category . The three columns on the right of the table allow you to compare the school to similar schools . Average percentages are shown for the 100 schools judged by the state_Department of Education to be most comparable in student demographics and socioeconomic status . * When zeros appear in an entire vertical column , it means that fewer than 10 students took the test . * Percentages do not necessarily total 100 % because of rounding and statistical variations . THE STATEWIDE STANDARDS Here are shortened versions of the statewide performance standards used to score the tests . The standards are written to apply to all three grades tested . READING * Level 6 : Students demonstrate insight as ( they ) consider a whole text . . . are confident and willing to take risks . . . open_to considering and developing new ideas ; explore complexities in_depth ; revise their interpretations ; expand on the possible meanings of a text ; connect ideas to their own experiences and to the world at_large . * Level 5 : Students demonstrate perception and thoroughness in considering a whole text . . . are confident and willing to take risks . . . consider new ideas about a text and use the text to check their understanding ; explore complexities and expand on the possible meanings ; often revise their interpretations . . . connect some ideas to their own experiences and to the world at_large . * Level 4 : Students demonstrate thoughtful understanding of a whole text ; are confident in their interpretation , but have little willingness to take risks . . . usually connect their understanding of a text to their own experiences ; when directed , use a text to check their understanding in a general or limited way ; identify some general significance or wider application of their understanding of a text . * Level 3 : Students demonstrate a plausible , general understanding of a whole text . Make superficial connections among the parts of a text ; are safe readers , unwilling to take risks , with little tolerance for difficulties ; rarely question a text , and when they do the questions are likely to be simple or superficial ; do not revise their first interpretation or explore other possibilities . * Level 2 : Students demonstrate superficial understanding ; may_not see a text as_a_whole , tending to focus only on portions ; occasionally recognize ideas without connecting them ; seldom ask questions of a text or offer meaningful evaluations of what they have read ; and may_not read a complete text . * Level 1 : Students demonstrate an understanding of only an individual word , phrase or title in a text . These readers do not demonstrate any understanding of the ideas or experiences offered or developed . Reading at this level is an act of recognizing a word or phrase rather than a process of constructing coherent meaning . WRITING * Level 6 : Students respond creatively and effectively to the demands of a writing assignment . Writing is confident , purposeful , coherent and clearly focused , conveying the writer ' s knowledge , values , insights and clarity of thought . Language is clear , distinct , varied and precise . Support ideas with appropriate reasons and well-chosen examples , skillfully using a variety of sentence_structures , committing few if any errors . * Level 5 : Students respond well to the demands of a writing assignment . Writing is purposeful , coherent and focused , clearly communicating the writer ' s knowledge , values and thoughts . Establishes an appropriate tone and uses effective language to support ideas with relevant reasons and examples . The writing employs a variety of sentence_structures with few errors . * Level 4 : Students respond to the demands of a writing assignment , generally communicating the writer ' s knowledge , values and clarity of thought . Writing is appropriately adapted to its audience , purpose and subject ; coherent , adequately organized and developed , and supported by reasons and examples . Uses suitable language and employs some variety of sentence_structure . Occasional errors . * Level 3 : Students respond inconsistently to the demands of a writing assignment , usually addressing all parts of the task , but having difficulty communicating knowledge and values . Writing may contain some insights , but also demonstrates confused , superficial or illogical thinking . Writing often limited in development . . . predictable vocabulary . . . simple , repetitive sentence_structures and noticeable errors . * Level 2 : Students partially meet the demands of a writing assignment . Seriously limited in communicating the writer ' s knowledge and values , and may address all or parts of a writing task , but with lapses in coherence . Writing is typically brief , disorganized and undeveloped , or may be vague and difficult to understand . . . frequent errors . * Level 1 : Students do not meet the demands of a writing assignment . Extremely limited in communicating the knowledge and values , and exhibit little or no concept of an audience . The writing is brief , incoherent , disorganized and undeveloped , and exhibits only a rudimentary facility in_using language . Many errors in grammar , punctuation , capitalization and spelling . MATHEMATICS * Level 6 : Rigorous mathematical thinking and in-depth understanding of essential mathematical ideas . Responses meet and often exceed expectations ; they are consistently correct and complete . . . . Generalizations and connections are supported by precise , logical_arguments . * Level 5 : Solid mathematical thinking and full understanding of mathematical ideas . Responses fully meet expectations ; are usually correct and complete . . . although sometimes containing minor flaws . Some of the student work contains generalizations and connections supported by effective arguments . * Level 4 : Substantial mathematical thinking and understanding of essential mathematical ideas , including appropriate representations ( for example , words , diagrams , graphs , pictures ) . Responses are usually correct although the work may contain flaws . Student work exhibits appropriate use of mathematical tools and techniques . * Level 3 : Partial mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical ideas . Some responses are correct ; however , gaps in conceptual understanding are evident and representations ( for example , words , diagrams , graphs , pictures ) need elaboration . * Level 2 : Limited mathematical thinking and understanding of mathematical ideas . While responses are sometimes correct , student work often falls_short_of providing workable solutions . Tools and techniques are rarely used or are used inappropriately . * Level 1 : Little or no understanding of mathematical ideas . Responses show little or no progress toward accomplishing mathematical tasks . There is little correct or appropriate use of tools , techniques or representations .

It is designed to compare student work to statewide performance standards . The first exams in reading , writing and math were given to 1 million students in fourth , eighth and 10th grades . The reading and writing portion of the test took three class periods to complete . Students read a passage and answered questions about it , met in small groups to clarify their thoughts , then completed a writing task . The math section took one class period and asked students to solve two open-ended problems and answer a series of questions .
