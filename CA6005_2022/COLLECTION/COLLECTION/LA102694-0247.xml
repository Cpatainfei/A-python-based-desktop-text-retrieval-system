   <HEADLINE> IN DEVELOPMENT / KATHLEEN WIEGNER : THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; ' INK EATERS ' COULD HELP RECYCLE PAPER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Office workers who faithfully toss waste paper into company-provided recycling bins may_not know that a vast amount of that paper still ends_up in landfills . that ' s because the toners used in copying machines and printers actually melt the printed images into the paper , and it ' s impossible to remove them in an economical way through the usual recycling processes . Tom Jeffries , a University of Wisconsin-Madison bacteriology professor , has a chemical-scrubbing enzyme that could be used to recapture paper fibers . Jeffries and his research team focused_on cellulases , enzymes that are used in everything from pet_food to acid-washed jeans . Because the enzymes are commercially available as well as biodegradable , using these &quot; ink eaters &quot; could cut recycling costs and greatly reduce the amount of chemicals used in the paper-cleaning process . Voith Inc. of Appleton , Wis. , which tests_paper technologies , will begin trials of the new process next month . Smog in a Box : As every schoolchild knows -- especially if she grew_up in Southern California -- smog is produced when sunlight interacts with industrial emissions and auto exhausts . At Pennsylvania State University , researchers at the Applied Research Laboratory have developed an air_pollution control_system based on the same photochemical process that causes smog . In the Advanced Oxidation Technology being examined at Penn State , the reactions occur in a series of treatment modules and are allowed to continue until the potential pollutants are turned_into harmless hydrocarbons , carbon_dioxide and water . In effect , the researchers have found that by first creating smog they can better clean the air of the chemicals that cause it . The process involves three steps : irradiation with ultraviolet_light , that part of the solar spectrum that produces smog ; &quot; scrubbing &quot; the air with ozonized water , and moving the scrubbed air over activated carbon to remove any remaining smog-producing elements . The ultraviolet rays , supplied by UV lamps , are more intense than those contained in sunlight . Advanced Oxidation Technology systems are already being used at 10 military and industrial facilities in the United States , but the Penn State researchers hope their work_on &quot; smog in a box &quot; will help bring the cost of these systems down and make them more effective , allowing_for broad industrial applications . ( The process cannot be used with automobile emissions. ) A Fontana company , Terr-Aqua Enviro Systems , is participating in the research . Face to Face : A new way to map facial features , developed at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign , may lead to cheaper rates for video telephone_calls . The researchers have developed algorithms that synthesize images of facial_expressions from the movement of the features rather than the entire face . Thus , the complete facial image need be transmitted only at the beginning of a call . To update the image , the algorithms select only the facial motion that is occurring at the most expressive points on the face , such_as the eyes or lips . This speeds_up transmission , meaning the call can be cheaper . The researchers used a video scanner to map the expressions of a live model onto a three-dimensional coordinate_system displayed on a computer monitor . Then they created algorithms to define and locate the model ' s key facial features and mapped them onto the coordinate_system . Other algorithms measured how much the facial features moved when the model ' s expression changed . The tracking algorithms can be applied to video images of any face . In the future , a person ' s head image might be recorded on a telephone credit_card and the information sent with every call . The technique can also be applied to hands to speed_up sign-language recognition on video phones . Kinder , Gentler Military Maneuvers : Anyone who has watched a 54-ton tank tear_up the terrain will find the idea of environmentally friendly military maneuvers oxymoronic . But managing the land on military_training bases is a concern of the Army , and software developed at Houston Advanced Research_Center ' s Environmental Information_Systems Laboratory may make the job easier . Using the center ' s advanced software database and an easy-to-understand visual display with icons and windows , military environmental managers can now summon up a detailed look_at base conditions . The base is divided into areas , and a manager can look_up the condition of each area , when training exercises last took_place there and the degree of erosion evident from using various pieces of equipment . The database is already being used at the Army ' s training center in Hohenfels , Germany . The software may prove useful not only for other military sites , but for U.S. Forest Service lands and other branches of government concerned with conservation .</TEXT>
