   <TEXT> A modern port is a maze of wharfs handling different types of ships and cargo , with computers doing more and more of the work . Los Angeles and Long_Beach are among the world ' s biggest container ports . Sitting side_by_side , they compete for traffic . Container_Ships Containers are standard-sized aluminum boxes , either 20 or 40 feet long by 8 feet by 8 feet . They are loaded with goods -- everything from perfume to electronic products -- and then stacked directly onto trucks or railroad_cars and moved to ports . At the port , giant cranes moving along rails on the docks hoist the containers and then lowers them one upon the other onto the ship . A clerk , working with a computer mockup of the hull , devises a plan for loading . Numbered and computer chip on each container help track contents , destination and shipper . Oil Tankers The first ocean-going tanker was launched in 1866 . Today , oil supertankers may measure more_than 1 # 300 feet long and carry more_than 500 # 000 short_tons of oil . Although most tankers carry oil , some haul cleaning fluids , fruit_juices , vegetable_oils , wines and other liquids . These are loaded and unloaded in a slightly different manner than is the oil_tanker shown here . Hydraulically controlled loading arms on the dock are levered into place , connecting to pipelines on the ship . Oil is then pumped into or out of the tanks . Los Angeles Vs .
