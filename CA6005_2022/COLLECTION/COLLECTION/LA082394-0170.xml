   <TEXT> On-Line Auctions : Mitsubishi Motors Sales of America said it will begin holding satellite car auctions so that its dealers can bid on Mitsubishi cars and trucks coming_back from rental and corporate fleets without having to physically travel_to an auction site . The program , a joint production of Cypress-based Mitsubishi and Aucnet USA in Atlanta , will enable Mitsubishi dealers to use computer_screens in their offices to view photos of the cars and read the condition reports prepared_for each vehicle.They will be able to enter their bids via computer as well . Previously , dealers who wanted to buy low-mileage Mitsubishi vehicles to resell in their used car operations had to travel_to one of the importer ' s super auctions where 1 # 000 or more cars are put_on the block every few weeks . The computer_program will debut in Mitsubishi ' s Northeastern territory in mid-September , with national expansion expected to follow once the kinks are worked_out . Aucnet is a Japanese company that has been running satellite auctions in Japan for about nine years . This is its first U.S. program .</TEXT>
