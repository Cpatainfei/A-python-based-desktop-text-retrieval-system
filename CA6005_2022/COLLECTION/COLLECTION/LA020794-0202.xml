   <HEADLINE> CAREERS ; SHIFTING GEARS ; INTERACTIVE PROMISED LAND ; THERE ARE FEW CAREERS NOW IN MULTIMEDIA , BUT GROWTH IS COMING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Meet Paul Drexler , antique dealer turned comedy writer turned corporate scriptwriter turned software marketer . And Chris Lathrop , video director and producer turned pay-TV executive . And Tim Bigoness , TV production assistant turned high-tech publicist . Despite their disparate career paths , Drexler , Lathrop and Bigoness have converged on common_ground : interactive_multimedia , the hot new industry that merges pictures , sound , graphics and text , and has enlivened the market for video_games , educational computer software and corporate presentations . The field of interactive_multimedia is suddenly all_the rage , attracting such high-powered types as fallen Wall_Street maven Michael Milken , an investor in multimedia start-ups , and Hollywood ' s Strauss Zelnick , who left as president of 20th Century Fox Film Corp . to head a small video_game company . All the hype about interactivity and free-flowing digital data on the Information Superhighway makes multimedia sound like the career for the 1990s and beyond . But keep_in mind that the hubbub has been way_out of proportion with the fledgling industry ' s size . If you ' ve been bitten by the multimedia bug and wonder whether you have the right credentials , here ' s a dose of reality : Getting a job won ' t be easy , or especially lucrative , unless you ' re one of those rare people with computer skills , creativity , vision and experience . On the other hand , there is broad agreement that the industry is poised for a hiring boom . Multimedia is &quot; exciting and fun , &quot; but at the moment it ' s &quot; like a TV job -- everybody wants one but there are not a lot to go_around , &quot; said Bigoness ( pronounced Bee-jho-nay ) , vice_president of marketing at Morph ' s Outpost , a multimedia magazine in Orinda , Calif . ( The industry does have its rewards : He spoke by phone from Cannes , where he was attending a multimedia conference. ) &quot; It ' s a relatively small market right now , &quot; said Bruce Ryon , multimedia analyst at Dataquest Inc. , a San Jose research firm . Even so , he added , it ' s packed with potential , as the public embraces CD-ROMs , the compact_discs that come loaded with video and sound to make interactivity possible on computers . Consider that 2.4 million systems with multimedia capabilities were shipped in the United States last year , up from 700 # 000 the year before . Dataquest projects shipments of three million this year and 30 % annual growth for the next few years . Half the computers shipped for home use this year will have CD-ROM_drives , and by 1998 , practically all machines are expected to come equipped with them . Although some giant companies -- including Paramount , Viacom , Microsoft and Apple -- have started multimedia divisions , the industry is mostly concentrated in cottage ventures with fewer than five employees . Fast-growing players in California include Compton ' s NewMedia of Carlsbad ; Electronic Arts in San Mateo , and Knowledge Adventure in La Crescenta . The staff at Compton ' s , which produces an interactive encyclopedia , has doubled every year for the last three years and now numbers 200 . Electronic Arts , which has several top-selling sports and game titles , has grown to 1 # 050 from 450 workers two years ago . Both companies expect to boost staff by 10 % to 20 % this year . Most of the work to develop and produce multimedia titles is being done on a contract basis . Especially in_demand for full-time and contract work are experienced content developers : graphic_artists , writers , animators and producers . There is also a big need for contract programmers , who earn $ 60 to $ 70 an hour . ( Very &quot; hot &quot; programmers and producers can make as much as $ 80 # 000 a year , but salaries of $ 40 # 000 or less are typical. ) Getting a foot in the door of any company , large or small , is tricky . The industry requires long hours and high energy , so it ' s no surprise that most of its practitioners are_well shy of 50 . &quot; We ' re looking_for people who were successful in traditional media and want to work for half as much , &quot; said Bing Gordon , a co-founder of Electronic Arts . For newcomers , professionals advise taking classes to learn the language of multimedia and the dizzying scope of an interactivity project . Programs are sprouting at universities such_as USC and UCLA and at the American Film Institute . At San Francisco State University ' s extension , a multimedia program that started with two classes 18 months ago enrolled more_than 900 students last semester . And in the first week of the most recent sign-up period , 452 students snapped_up classes in interactive filmmaking , writing for multimedia and 3-D . At USC , Apple Computer , Viacom and Warner Bros . joined to establish the four-month-old Entertainment Technology Center to train the multimedia experts of tomorrow . With advantages like that , you ' re certainly more likely to find a home_in multimedia in California than if you lived_in , say , Alabama . California has three thriving multimedia incubators -- San Francisco , ( known as Multimedia Gulch ) ; Los Angeles , with its Hollywood connection , and northern San Diego County . Drexler , the former antique dealer , got started in multimedia thanks to a contract with Apple Computer that led to a stint in the computing pioneer ' s multimedia lab . Three years ago , he started InterWorks with his wife , Julie Marsh , a veteran video producer and director . From two offices in their San Francisco home equipped with five computers and some audio equipment , they are developing children ' s interactive fairy tales , with occasional coaching from their twin 5-year-old daughters , Lily and Michelle . Drexler and Marsh are scouting out investors : Developing and publishing a title can cost $ 300 # 000 or more .</TEXT>
