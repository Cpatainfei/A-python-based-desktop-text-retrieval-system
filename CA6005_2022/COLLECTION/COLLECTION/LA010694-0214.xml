   <HEADLINE> FRANCE MAY LIMIT ARTIFICIAL PREGNANCIES ; MEDICINE : CONTROLS SOUGHT BY GOVERNMENT WOULD BE AMONG WORLD ' S STRICTEST . ' WE WANT TO STAY VERY CLOSE TO NATURE , ' ONE OFFICIAL SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> France ' s conservative government said Wednesday that it will seek to impose strict controls on artificial impregnation , including a requirement that infertile couples have the consent of the sperm donor and a judge ' s permission before receiving an embryo implant . The government was spurred by a growing national debate this week following the birth of twins to a 59-year-old , post-menopausal British woman , who received an embryo implant at an Italian clinic . The doctors who did that implant say a 62-year-old Italian woman , Rosana Della Corte , now is three months pregnant after a similar treatment . A bill that easily passed France ' s National Assembly a year ago , and awaits approval by the Senate , calls_for a ban on embryo implants for women after menopause . But the new package of bills , if approved , will subject couples seeking artificial impregnation in France to some of the world ' s toughest restrictions . &quot; We are in a situation where the state has to take its responsibilities , &quot; said Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur . The prime_minister ' s spokesman , Nicolas Sarkozy , said Balladur knew the issue would be controversial and &quot; that all efforts to legislate in such complex , touchy and changing areas must be made in a spirit of great intellectual modesty. &quot; The government ' s plans were revealed by Social_Affairs Minister Simone Veil after the Cabinet ' s regular weekly meeting . She told her fellow ministers that medical advances in assisted procreation and transplants have made stricter rules necessary . &quot; We want to stay very close to nature , &quot; Veil said . &quot; But one must introduce some kind of framework , without stopping all women from benefiting from medical progress and having children when they wish if they are sterile. &quot; Veil said the government plans to fine-tune the medical ethics bill that the National Assembly passed earlier before submitting it to the Senate . The new laws would impose new barriers to artificial_insemination and embryo implantation , especially in cases where there are no biological links between the embryo and the couple who receive it . Under the government ' s proposals , a judge would be asked to consider a variety of factors_in each case , including the biological connection of the embryo to the prospective parents and whether the sperm donor consented to the procedure . The package of legislation already approved by lawmakers would allow &quot; medically assisted procreation &quot; only to remedy sterility or to avoid the transmission of disease to the child . It could not be used for women without partners , homosexuals or women past menopause . Although analysts foresee a lively debate in Parliament , they say the government majority is likely to prevail unless it is persuaded to withdraw the legislation . And even a restrictive law in France , doctors say , would not prevent French couples from seeking treatment in other European_countries . Leading French doctors are divided on the proposed law . Jacques Testart , head of one of France ' s leading in_vitro research laboratories , said the ability &quot; to totally change our way of living is a daring gesture that belongs , not to medicine , but to politics in its noble sense. &quot; But Claude Sureau , a member of the_French National Academy of Medicine and president of the ethics committee of the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics , said , &quot; I don ' t think a law forbidding such things is good . &quot; How does one define the normal age of menopause ? &quot; he asked . &quot; And if one allows the law to interfere in such a private domain , one is in a dangerous ethical situation of genetic totalitarianism. &quot;</TEXT>
