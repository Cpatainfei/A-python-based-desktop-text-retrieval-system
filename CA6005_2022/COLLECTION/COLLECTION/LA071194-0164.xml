   <HEADLINE> PCS TAP INTO HOLLYWOOD ' S STORY LINE ; CD-ROM SYSTEM GIVES AUDIENCE AN INTERACTIVE ROLE IN PLOTTING MOVIES , BUT IS IT REALLY DRAMA ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On Wednesday -- 27 years after a cumbersome two-projector system allowed the audience to vote on the ending of a movie at the Montreal Expo ' s Czech Pavilion -- the interactive CD-ROM version of a feature_film will premiere at the Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences . Digitized images of Margot Kidder , Brian Keith and Russell Means in &quot; Under a Killing Moon &quot; propel the action on 25 17-inch screens as viewers make choices by computer . Tapping into the increased storage capacity of CD-ROMs ( each of which stores the equivalent of 300 # 000 typewritten pages or 1 # 100 floppy discs ) , the $ 2.5-million adventure-mystery thrusts people into a 3-D &quot; virtual world &quot; in which they search for clues and influence the course of dialogue and narrative . Though the picture image has yet to equal videotape quality , it ' s a cut above the computer imagery of the past . &quot; Technology is now powerful enough so we can show ' acting ' instead of cartoons , &quot; says Chris Jones , executive_vice_president of the Salt Lake City-based Access Software , which produced the project , scheduled for an August release at video , computer and retail_stores at a suggested price of $ 99 . &quot; We ' re crossing the line from video_games into interactive movies that can be serious contenders in the entertainment marketplace. &quot; * While some still fail to see the distinction between an &quot; interactive movie &quot; and a technologically sophisticated video_game , the premiere does testify to the increasing cross-pollination between the Silicon_Valley and Hollywood -- two parties bonded by commercial symbiosis . The video-game industry milks the recognition value of movies such_as &quot; Aladdin &quot; and &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; by offering these blockbusters on a CD-ROM format . Feature filmmakers -- as well as the unions and agencies representing them -- are looking_to the new technology to extend the bounds of traditional movie-making and provide new sources of revenue . &quot; It ' s the 1990s version of the 1848 Gold_Rush , &quot; says Michael Prohaska , senior administrator of the Screen Actors Guild ' s year-old Industrial and Interactive Contracts Division . &quot; No one knows if there ' s a future there . But everyone ' s panning for gold. &quot; Last week , Clint Eastwood announced that he would team_up to develop a CD-ROM on his life and career , citing the potential of the medium to &quot; entertain and inform. &quot; Chuck Norris is beginning production on the first of three live-action video_games lined_up in a multimillion-dollar deal , following Steven Seagal , who licensed his name and likeness for use in an original CD-ROM project . And , taking a cue from Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes , who shot extra scenes for a &quot; Demolition Man &quot; video_game , filmmakers are now trying to amass this footage during regular production schedules . On the studio front , Viacom New Media is releasing video_game versions of Paramount Television ' s &quot; Star Trek : Deep_Space Nine &quot; and the short-lived &quot; Viper. &quot; And other entertainment giants such_as Sony , Walt Disney and Time Warner have set_up interactive divisions in-house . &quot; A lot of creative people -- directors , actors , musicians , writers -- are interested in working in the medium , &quot; says Dan Adler , a Creative Artists agent specializing in new media . &quot; Though there ' s always some resistance to change , as artists they ' re intrigued by the promise of another canvas on which to work. &quot; Still , the new technology also poses a new set of creative challenges . Shooting actors individually against a &quot; blue screen &quot; -- a process through which characters can be superimposed on a variety of backgrounds -- can be painstaking and static . And recording &quot; conversation trees &quot; -- multiple versions of scenes to permit for a variety of interactive choices -- works against continuity and character development . Margot Kidder , best known as Lois Lane in the &quot; Superman &quot; movies , says she spent six months just learning how to block and move . &quot; It really wasn ' t acting , &quot; she maintains . &quot; I felt_like a frog leaping over moats in those video_games since everything was motivated by computer logic . Interactive movies are a fascinating way of working without compromising your morality while you wait for parts that appeal on an artistic level . But they have too many variables to correspond to the age-old rules of ' drama. ' &quot; * Others in the industry agree , insisting that the &quot; stop-start &quot; nature of the format interrupts the flow and that the public prefers its entertainment spoon-fed . Involving people in video_games is_well and good , the argument goes , but movies necessitate a suspension of belief . &quot; People want to be told stories . . . not create them , &quot; says a leading developer of entertainment software . &quot; Even writers find the creative process to be work . When was the last time you read an interactive novel ? Technology can ' t create new behavior . It just allows existing behavior to happen more readily. &quot; Tom Zito , president of the San Mateo-based Digital Pictures , acknowledges the hurdles but cautions against judging a product in its infancy . Since 1987 , he ' s produced 18 interactive movies and , in five years , he predicts , we ' ll be seeing interactive news broadcasts , game_shows and soap_operas as well . &quot; Comparing an interactive movie to a linear one is like comparing ' The Kiss ' -- one of Thomas_Edison ' s first films -- to ' Sleepless in Seattle , ' &quot; says Zito , whose outfit just signed contracts with the Directors Guild and SAG . &quot; When CD-ROM hardware becomes more available , our budgets will go_up and we ' ll attract A-list talent . For now , though , we can ' t spend more_than $ 2 million to $ 3 million -- the price of a TV movie -- on a project if we ' re interested in making a profit. &quot; The challenge , according to SAG , is helping the fledgling industry to fly while protecting the legal and financial interests of its membership . No likenesses can be used without authorization . Actors must command a decent wage . Currently , the contract specifies that a performer gets $ 485 for an eight-hour day plus 12.65 % for pension and health benefits . As the industry matures , the union suggests , residuals and royalties based on unit sales should be part of the package . In part , the growth of the market is linked to CD-ROM hardware , currently available in 3 % to 4 % of American homes -- far behind the 62 % that subscribe_to cable and the 77 % that own VCRs . Still , industry_analysts expect the number to soar now that the cost of upgrading a computer with a sound board and CD-ROM_drive is less than $ 200 ( down from over $ 1 # 000 three years ago ) and the hardware is included in most new computers . * Nearly twice as_many American households had CD-ROMs this year compared to 1993 , according to the market research firm Dataquest . That figure should more_than double by 1996 . &quot; The technology is changing every day -- and that ' s what ' s scary , &quot; says Frank Loverme , executive_director of CD-ROM sales at WEA Manufacturing , a Time Warner company . &quot; Five years from now , watching ' Under a Killing Moon ' will look_like ' Superman ' in the ' 50s . Part of the frontier mentality is that no one knows what ' s going_on . There are no rules . No one is sharing information . Everyone has his own agenda -- and the person who guesses right will win. &quot; &quot; Killing Moon ' s &quot; Chris Jones is optimistic , nonetheless . &quot; Sure it ' s a bit of a high-wire act , but much less so than when we started two years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; We threw_out the floppy ( disc ) , closed our eyes , and bet that ( CD-ROM ) technology would drive the marketplace . It was the smartest thing we could have done. &quot;</TEXT>
