   <HEADLINE> TEACHING THE FRENCH ABOUT TASTE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> About 15 years ago , I watched a chef in Paris demonstrate dipping candied orange_peel strips into chocolate when another student asked how to make chocolate-dipped strawberries . The chef ' s immediate response was : &quot; Why would you want to do that ? &quot; To him , the tangy taste of strawberries did not seem to complement the flavor of chocolate . Still , to please the student , he proceeded to dip strawberries into chocolate . Most of the students liked them . Even the chef admitted that they were &quot; pas mal &quot; ( not_bad ) . I discussed this flavor combination with other French chefs , who reacted as our chef originally had . Chocolate and strawberries were simply not a popular pair in France . Yet they had become a favorite combination in restaurants and pastry shops in the United States , and magazine_articles featured chocolate-strawberry shortcakes , chocolate_cake rolls with strawberry filling , chocolate_ice_cream topped with strawberry sauce and chocolate cheesecake with strawberries . Personally , I find chocolate a delicious partner for ripe strawberries . There ' s another advantage -- a_few of these chocolate-dressed berries turn_out to be a fairly light low-calorie dessert . After all , only a thin , delicate coating of chocolate clings_to each berry . Chocolate-dipped strawberries are very easy to prepare . Just make_sure that the berries are not wet ; moisture from one berry could cause the bowl of chocolate to harden before you finish dipping the other berries . Pat the rinsed berries dry with several changes of paper_towels before you dip them in the chocolate . I always use fine French , Belgian or Swiss chocolate for dipping strawberries . Since the chocolate is not mixed with other ingredients , choose the best chocolate you can get . Good-quality chocolate contains a generous proportion of cocoa_butter , which gives the chocolate the desired fluidity for easy dipping . You can dip the berries in either dark or white chocolate . For an especially festive dessert , I like to prepare double-dipped strawberries : I dip a berry in white chocolate , let it harden , then dip its tip_in dark chocolate . Long-stemmed berries are sold at the market for dipping . The green stems are pretty and helpful when you dip the berries , but I prefer smaller strawberries because they are often sweeter . Besides , with large berries , you feel_like you ' re eating so_much berry that you hardly taste the chocolate . By the way , the_French seem to be coming_around : On a recent trip I came_across a patisserie window displaying chocolate_mousse cake with strawberries . * For an even quicker dessert , dip the berries in fine-quality melted chocolate at the table and eat them while they ' re still warm . CHOCOLATE-DIPPED STRAWBERRIES 10 large or 20 small or medium strawberries with stems and leaves 3 ounces bittersweet , semisweet or white chocolate , chopped Rinse strawberries , leaving stems on . Pat completely dry with paper_towels . Let dry on paper_towels on rack 30 minutes . Melt chocolate in small , deep bowl set over hot water over low heat , stirring often with rubber spatula . Remove bowl of chocolate from pan of water . Cool chocolate , stirring very often , until it still flows but is thick enough to adhere to berries . White chocolate should feel cooler than body_temperature . On instant-read thermometer , it should reach 84 degrees . Dark chocolate should feel slightly cooler than body_temperature , or 88 degrees . Pat 1 strawberry dry again with paper_towels . Dip pointed end of each berry in chocolate , so that half berry is coated . Gently shake berry and let excess chocolate drip back into bowl . Set berry on tray lined with foil or wax_paper . Dip remaining berries . If chocolate thickens , set briefly over hot water so it becomes fluid . Refrigerate berries 30 minutes or until chocolate sets . Carefully lift berries from foil to loosen , then replace on tray . Dipped strawberries can be kept uncovered 2 to 3 hours in refrigerator . Remove from refrigerator about 10 minutes before serving . Makes 10 large or 20 small dipped berries . * This is a delightful three-tone confection to serve as dessert after a rich meal . It ' s also a lovely accompaniment for ice_cream , or a fresh , colorful addition to a tray of petits fours or chocolates . Use fine-quality chocolate . DOUBLE-DIPPED STRAWBERRIES 10 large or 20 small or medium strawberries with stems and leaves 5 ounces white chocolate , chopped 2 ounces bittersweet or semisweet chocolate , chopped Rinse berries , leaving stems on . Pat completely dry with paper_towels . Let dry on paper_towels on rack 30 minutes . Melt white chocolate in small deep bowl set over hot water over low heat , stirring often with rubber spatula . Remove bowl of white chocolate from pan of water . Cool white chocolate , stirring often , until it reaches 84 degrees on instant-read thermometer , or cooler than body_temperature . Pat 1 strawberry dry again with paper_towels . Holding by stem end , dip pointed 2 / 3 of berry in white chocolate . Gently shake berry and let excess white chocolate drip into bowl . Set berry on tray lined with foil or wax_paper . Dip remaining berries . If white chocolate thickens , set briefly over hot water so it becomes fluid . Refrigerate berries 30 minutes or until white chocolate sets . Carefully lift berries from foil to loosen , then replace on tray . Melt dark chocolate in same manner as white chocolate . Cool until slightly cooler than body_temperature , or 88 degrees on thermometer . Dip bottom 1 / 3 of each berry in dark chocolate . Set berries on prepared tray . Refrigerate about 15 minutes or until set , or keep_up to 3 hours . Remove from refrigerator about 10 minutes before serving . Makes 10 large or 20 small dipped berries . * In this colorful dessert , strawberries and cream are encircled by kirsch-scented chocolate_mousse . You can make the mousse up_to two weeks ahead and keep it in the freezer .
