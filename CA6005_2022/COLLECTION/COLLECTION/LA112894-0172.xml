Jordan thus became the second Arab country to open diplomatic ties with the Jewish state after Egypt , which signed a treaty with Israel in 1979 . A party of Jordanian schoolchildren were to go_to Israel today to attend celebrations in Haifa , becoming the first group of Jordanians to formally enter Israel since Nov . 14 , when both countries opened the way for visits , border officials said . Hundreds of Israeli tourists have flocked to Jordan in the past two weeks . The joint statement said that both countries hope the move will promote comprehensive peace , development and cooperation . They will now formally exchange letters nominating ambassadors . King Hussein personally chose Marwan Muasher , 38 , Jordan ' s former Middle_East peace team spokesman and an affluent U.S.-educated computer entrepreneur , as Jordan ' s first envoy to Israel .
