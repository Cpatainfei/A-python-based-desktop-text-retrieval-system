   <HEADLINE> GOLF / PGA AT SAN DIEGO ; LOWERY SHOOTS 66 TO MOVE INTO LEAD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Steve Lowery , an unfamiliar face in an unfamiliar place , shot a 66 Saturday to take a one-shot lead after the third round of the Buick Invitational . Never before has he been the leader going_to the final round of a PGA Tour event . &quot; I ' m going_to have to make birdies , &quot; he said . &quot; These guys aren ' t going_to back up. &quot; And Lowery , a 33-year-old journeyman from Alabama , has plenty of company . Three shots separated second-round leader David Toms from second place Friday , but those same three shots blanketed 10 players after Saturday ' s round . Toms had an even-par 72 and slipped into a four-way tie for second with Craig Stadler , Ronnie Black and Kirk Triplett . Also within three shots of Lowery , who stands at 15-under 201 , are Hal Sutton and Lennie Clements at 203 and Payne Stewart , Bob Estes and Mark Wurtz at 204 . These contenders figure to be a hungry bunch , at least when it comes_to tasting victories . Six of the 10 -- Lowery , Toms , Triplett , Clements , Estes and Wurtz -- have never won a tour event . Stadler is a local who has never won at_home . Black has not won in 10 years . Sutton has not won since 1986 . Even Stewart has had a bit of a dry spell , winless since the 1991 U.S. Open . For Toms , the 27-year-old from Louisiana , the day started like he was going_to have this tournament in his bag by sunset . He made a 35-foot putt to birdie the first hole and a 15-foot putt to birdie the second . He was at 16 under and no one was an imminent threat . Lowery , playing two groups ahead , also birdied the first two holes , but that got him only to 11 under . Things began to come undone for Toms on the third hole , when he had a three-putt for a bogey . He was haunted by three-putts before he was finished , four of them , all for bogeys , his first of the tournament . &quot; It gets you wondering whether you have to hit it dead-center to get_it into the hole , &quot; he said . &quot; I had three of them lip all_the way around the hole and come_back looking right at me . Tomorrow , the course owes me . They have to lip in rather than lip out. &quot; Meanwhile , Lowery , Stadler and Black were stalking him . Both Stadler and Black had shares of the lead during the back nine , but Stadler rode a rollercoaster ride_out of the lead and Black lost his share with a bogey on the 17th . Lowery was 14-under as he went_to the 13th green and , behind him , Toms was bogeying the 10th and Stadler the 12th . Lowery ' s second shot on the par-five 13th skipped_over a bunker and rolled onto the green toward the pin . The crowd gasped , but it stopped three feet short . He missed the eagle putt , but he had caught Toms for a share of the lead . &quot; I was glancing at the leaderboard , &quot; he admitted , &quot; because my goal was to be leading when I finished today. &quot; Another birdie on the 15th hole got him to 16 under , but he missed the green from the rough next to the par-three 16th hole and settled for a bogey . He finished at 15 under and left it for the last two groups to shoot at him . Neither Toms nor Black could get the birdie they needed on 18 to tie . Stadler and Triplett birdied the 18th , but those birdies got them to 14-under . Stadler had been firing and falling_back for the last nine holes , carding three birdies , three bogeys and three pars . &quot; My round was fun at the start , &quot; Stadler said , &quot; but boring at the end. &quot; Black was perplexed by his 69 , which followed rounds of 65 and 68 . &quot; I played better today than the first two days , &quot; he said , &quot; and had my worst score. &quot; He would have equaled Friday ' s 68 , and tied for the lead , but for a succession of difficulties on the 17th . His tee shot found the right rough and his second shot carried wide into a downhill lie_in deeper rough . He chopped at the ball and barely made the green , leaving him with a bogey . Lowery , having accomplished his goal of leading after Saturday ' s round , obviously has a new goal . &quot; I know I ' ll be all keyed up , &quot; he said , &quot; dealing with nerves , the situation , the golf_course . I ' ll deal with it . Heck , I ' d be nervous trying to win a club championship. &quot; He has a lot of company in the same situation with the same feelings .</TEXT>
