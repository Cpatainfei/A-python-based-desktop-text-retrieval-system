   <HEADLINE> U.S. PRESENCE IN SOUTH_KOREA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chalmers Johnson ' s commentary on North_Korea , &quot; A Spark That Might Ignite &quot; ( Dec . 20 ) , is ill-timed and ill-advised . Johnson ' s assertion that the downing of a U.S. army helicopter by North_Korea may be an incident that may ignite a full-scale war is a grossly exaggerated fear . Furthermore , his call_for the withdrawal of the American ground troops from South_Korea before they become &quot; hostage &quot; to &quot; hair-trigger &quot; hostilities is reckless and dangerous . His apprehension may stem from his lack of understanding and appreciation of the genesis of the artificial division of Korea by the former Soviet_Union and United States at the end of the World_War_II . Hence , the United States has borne a moral and political responsibility in the Korean problem . The fact of the_matter is that the presence of the American ground troops in South_Korea for the past 41 years has played a crucial role of preventing possible outbreak of another Korean_war ever since the signing of the armistice agreement in July of 1953 . Their military and psychological impact should be neither underestimated nor ignored . Given the history of enmity and mistrust between the two Koreas , it would be ill-advised and irresponsible for the United States to leave and let the two well-equipped armies totaling more_than 1.5 million people confront each other across the demilitarized zone . Although the Korean_peninsula has not yet seen the end of the Cold_War , there have been some encouraging movements for the past several years in the direction of detente and peaceful cooperation , namely , South_Korea ' s normalization of diplomatic relations with two archenemies , Russia and China . At this critical juncture , it is extremely important that we do not send wrong signals to the North_Korean leadership as they are engaged in the succession process following the death of their paramount leader , Kim Il Sung . For the United States and South_Korea now , it is critically important to maintain a steady course along with Japan to encourage North_Korea to faithfully implement all_the provisions of the U.S.-North Korea nuclear agreement in exchange for economic assistance and diplomatic rapprochement . However , the question of full diplomatic recognition and ambassadorial exchanges between the United States and North_Korea should proceed along with meaningful progress in North-South dialogue for peaceful coexistence and cooperation . Meaningful progress must include reunification of separated families between North and South_Korea , mutual verification of non-nuclearization , economic and cultural exchanges , and an eventual peace agreement and disarmament .
