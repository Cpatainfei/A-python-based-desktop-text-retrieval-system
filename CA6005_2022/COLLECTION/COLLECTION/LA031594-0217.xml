   <HEADLINE> REGIONAL OUTLOOK ; 2 BALTIC NATIONS LOOK WEST AND EAST FOR THEIR FORTUNES ; ESTONIA AND LATVIA ARE RISING FROM THE SOVIET WRECKAGE , LEAVING RUSSIA AND LITHUANIA BEHIND .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What would you expect from Europe ' s youngest prime_minister -- a man who recruits Cabinet members from among his fraternity brothers ? Who used to ride from village to town on a bicycle , collecting stories of Stalinist oppression and thumbing his nose at the KGB ? Who relaxes to the music of Guns ' N Roses ? Radical reform . Here in Estonia , a country of forests and swamps about the size of West_Virginia , Prime_Minister Mart Laar , 33 , and his team have raised their young country from the economic wreckage of the Soviet_Union , putting a spotlight on the Baltic region , where Latvia is also pressing forward . Although the Estonian economy shrank 20 % in 1992 and 2 % in 1993 , the International Monetary Fund has predicted 6 % growth this year . That would make_it the fastest-growing economy of any in Europe or the former Soviet_Union . World_Bank officials have told the U.S. Embassy in Tallinn , the Estonian capital , that &quot; they would not be surprised to see 5 % ( annual growth ) from this year to the year 2000 , &quot; said Ingrid Kollist , the embassy ' s economic officer . &quot; They ' re very bullish on Estonia. &quot; Estonian officials say unemployment runs 2 % nationally , and here in Tallinn -- a charming European village turned boom_town -- it is virtually zero . The newspapers are_full of help wanted_ads . Thousands of new businesses crop_up annually , and Estonian exports doubled in value from 1991 to 1993 , from 5 billion kroons to 10 billion ( $ 725 million ) . Much of the credit goes_to the cruelly conservative policies of the Laar government : Social programs have been butchered , while state-owned factories have been told to turn a profit or fold . That and conservative monetary policies have kept the Estonian kroon stable and held inflation to 33 % for 1993 . In Russia , by comparison , annual inflation pushing 1 # 000 % is the norm . &quot; If you look_into history , we have done exactly what Germany did after World_War_II , only Estonia is doing_it without the Marshall Plan , &quot; Laar said in an interview in Toompea Castle , the government seat . The chubby-cheeked leader and his ministers developed their game_plan in college , poring over economics textbooks at Estonia ' s elite Tartu University -- the school Estonians with political aspirations dream of attending . Laar , a historian , still attends the occasional fraternity party at the Estonian Students Society . He grins boyishly as he recounts his not-so-distant college days : He seems to have spent half his time hanging_out with underground rock musicians , the other half gathering oral histories about resistance to the Soviet occupation of Estonia in the 1940s and 1950s . &quot; Who in this country has the experience for today ' s problems ? No one , &quot; remarked Juri Luik , Laar ' s 27-year-old foreign_minister . &quot; We at least gathered our experience from Western books , and we ' re now trying to implement those ideas , &quot; he said . And not without complaint . Many Estonians say life is harder than ever . Average monthly salaries are about 1 # 200 kroons ( $ 87 ) , while senior_citizens scrape_by on monthly state pensions of 500 kroons ( $ 36 ) . Surveys suggest Estonians spend 40 % of their income on food alone . The budget is balanced , but government salaries and pensions are so low that Tallinn ' s firemen frequently picket the Parliament . Approval ratings for Laar ' s government hover around 10 % . Farmers , who make_up a surly , subsidy-fattened lobby throughout the former Soviet_Union , are particularly unhappy . Yet when farmers gathered earlier this month for an angry conference to demand more subsidies , Laar coolly suggested they package their products more attractively and hope Estonians will buy them . &quot; Of course we are not very popular , &quot; Laar said in his office . &quot; People complain that we don ' t like the elderly , we don ' t like children , we don ' t like sports . &quot; This is the toughest moment for any government : when the economy zooms up but there ' s no money in people ' s pockets. &quot; Such nonchalance , according to 28-year-old Estonian Defense Minister Indrek Kannik , is the prerogative of youth . &quot; Younger people have their whole lives ahead of them , &quot; he said . &quot; They are more willing to make unpopular decisions. &quot; Popular or not , Laar ' s program works . Two years ago , there were 2 # 000 private companies in Estonia . Today , estimates range from 40 # 000 to 60 # 000 . Thirty percent of the population last year switched jobs -- usually leaving the state sector for the private . No other former Soviet republic has enjoyed such success . In nearby Lithuania , for example , a largely Communist government elected in 1992 and the powerful farmers lobby have gummed_up efforts at reform . Inflation in 1993 was 183 % , while salaries are about half those in Estonia . Russia and Ukraine , drifting politically , have only fitfully tried to wean inefficient state-run factories from government money . Former Russian Economics Minister Yegor T . Gaidar had advocated Estonian-style radical reform , but the Russian Parliament thwarted his efforts and engineered his downfall this winter . Indeed , among the former Soviet republics , only Estonia ' s neighbor Latvia is doing half so well . Its numbers don ' t look good , but they ' re better than the rest . Latvia ' s economy shrank by 40 % over the past two years , mostly , according to Economics Minister Ojars Kehris , &quot; in the unproductive agricultural and industrial sector. &quot; Kehris added that &quot; many enterprises will go bankrupt in the near future , and that is normal and necessary. &quot; Latvia ' s unemployment is 8 % , and the government stands on a tenuous coalition of farmers and free marketers . Prime_Minister Valdis Birkavs , aware of an implicit comparison with Estonia ' s Wunderkind , laughed wryly when asked his age . &quot; I ' m 51 , but I feel much younger , &quot; he said , and then defended his competence not by citing his distinguished law career -- Birkavs was president of Latvia ' s Lawyers Society , which in 1988 became the first freely elected lawyers society in the Soviet_Union -- but with a long discussion of his passions for tennis and sailing . But Birkavs has a commendable record managing his country ' s economy as well . Latvia ' s 1993 inflation was an acceptable 35 % , while aggressive bank reforms have made the capital , Riga , a blossoming financial_center . &quot; We are not just the Switzerland of the former Soviet_Union . We are in a position to compete with Switzerland itself as a world financial_center , &quot; Birkavs said . &quot; Russians , Belarussians and other Soviets like to bank here , because they have old ties , and they don ' t have a language_barrier since we speak Russian. &quot; In January , 1993 , Latvian banks held deposits of about 99 million lats ( $ 174 million ) ; by January , 1994 , that figure had quintupled to 492 million lats . &quot; You have a wave of money flowing over this country , &quot; said Jonathan Bemis , economic officer for the U.S. Embassy in Riga . Riding the crest of that wave is Latvia ' s new currency -- the handily named lat -- introduced two years ago . The Estonian kroon , adopted at about the same time , was pegged to the German mark at 8 to 1 and has been one of Europe ' s steadiest currencies . But the Latvians -- out-free-marketing even the Estonians -- let their currency find its own value . The result has been astonishing . While the Russian ruble and the Ukrainian karbovanets have tumbled , the lat has steadily climbed . One lat was valued at $ 1.17 in January , 1993 , and at $ 1.70 in January , 1994 . &quot; Today , the lat gains about two U.S. cents against the dollar every month , &quot; said Economics Minister Kehris proudly . Latvia is sandwiched between Estonia to the north and Lithuania to the south . Riga , a city of 900 # 000 , is the largest Baltic port and the closest thing to a regional metropolis . Tallinn , a city and port half the size of Riga , looks quaint in comparison , while the Lithuanian capital , Vilnius , is a sleepy , landlocked town . Riga ' s size and location make_it the commercial center_of_gravity . Foreign firms with an eye to doing business in Russia -- Kellogg ' s , for example , which is building a $ 22-million cereal factory -- choose Latvia and Riga as headquarters . &quot; There ' s an attitude in the business world here that it is Latvia ' s future to act_as a gateway to Russia , a Hong Kong , a stable platform for business with a large , troubled but economically interesting neighbor , &quot; said Bemis . Kellogg ' s aside , however , most headquarters so far are largely symbolic offices . Uldis Vitolins , director of a government_agency charged with courting foreign capital , said 1993 brought a mere $ 50 million in foreign investment . Estonia is only now beginning to make_noises about playing Hong Kong to the Soviet market . So far the Estonians have prided themselves on , in the words of President Lennart Meri , &quot; cutting the colonial links &quot; with the Soviet_Union and forging new links with Finland . Most of the $ 65 million in foreign investment Estonia enjoyed in 1993 came from Finland , while 80 % of the tourists visiting Estonia last year were Finns . Estonian and Finnish are similar languages , and Estonians , who could tune_in Finnish TV even in the pre-Gorbachev era , had a huge head_start on glasnost . Thanks to Finnish TV , for example , Estonians understand that when it comes_to selling , a pretty wrapper is crucial . For instance , Estonian yogurt , fancily and brightly decorated , would look_at home on the shelves of an American grocery_store ; Latvian yogurt is wrapped in a faded label . While local business magazines hail the Renaissance of Estonian design , Estonian products have poured into northwest Russia in the past six months . Russians who would never buy anything &quot; Soviet &quot; snatch them up , convinced by the fancy packaging that they are buying Finnish . &quot; I have an Estonian toothbrush and Estonian toothpaste , &quot; said George Shabad , 24 , a sales representative for the Baltic News Service who travels often between Moscow and Tallinn . &quot; My suit jacket is Estonian , my shirt , my tie . Estonian products are cheap and good ; Russian products are expensive and bad. &quot; So who ' s ahead -- Estonia or Latvia ? Latvian Economics Minister Kehris parries the question by noting a free-trade agreement all three Baltic_states signed last fall . The 200-page pact creates a single Baltic market of 8 million people and ultimately envisions open borders and a single visa regime . According to Kehris , the Baltics will rise and fall together . The Estonians , for their part , prefer a different question : Who ' s ahead -- Estonia or Finland ? Most Estonians believe that the Soviet annexation of the Baltic_states under the infamous Molotov-Ribbentrop pact sidetracked them from their rightful destiny as an economic superpower . &quot; If we had not been occupied , I think we would have displayed the same growth tendencies as those countries we were level with in the 1940s , &quot; said Deputy Chancellor Peeter Tohver . &quot; Countries like Finland , Sweden , even Germany. &quot; At least one important economic indicator puts Latvia ahead . Riga will get the first McDonald ' s , tentatively scheduled to open in December . Tallinn ' s McDonald ' s should follow a month later .
