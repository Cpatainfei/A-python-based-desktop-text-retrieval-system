   <HEADLINE> FRENCH OPEN ; MEN : BRUGUERA DEFEATS COUNTRYMAN BERASATEGUI TO WIN SECOND CONSECUTIVE TITLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Alberto Berasategui had the crazy grip and feral forehand , but like so many others before him he did not have the stamina to withstand his friend Sergi Bruguera . In the first all-Spanish Grand_Slam tournament final , Bruguera , 23 , turned a close match into a routine victory Sunday to win the men ' s French Open title , 6-3 , 7-5 , 2-6 , 6-1 . It happened with the flick of a wrist in the second set when No . 23 Berasategui took a 4-1 lead but was broken twice and lost , 7-5 . Berasategui , who hits his forehand with a backhand grip , could not find the lines that he so effectively hit in reaching the final without losing a set . &quot; I got too tired , &quot; Berasategui said . Bruguera tamed the game ' s most feared forehand by running it into the ground with his inclination to turn clay court_tennis into a marathon . &quot; To control the forehand of Alberto is impossible , &quot; Bruguera said . &quot; But you don ' t have to be afraid of it . The others might have lost even before they played him . I know how to play him . I know his weaknesses. &quot; Thus , No . 6 Bruguera won his second consecutive French Open championship to become Spain ' s first two-time French champion since Manuel Santana in 1961 and ' 64 . In winning the first set after taking a 3-1 lead , Bruguera roamed the baseline trading groundstrokes with the hard-hitting Basque . The rallies were long . It was not unusual for them to exchange 26 strokes before an error . That was fine with Bruguera , who can stay_on the clay all day batting the ball . He lost only one set -- to Jim Courier in the semifinals -- as he advanced to Sunday ' s championship . Although Bruguera becomes the world ' s best clay-court player with his convincing victory , he still has to prove himself as one of the sport ' s greats . Except for losing in the first round of the U.S. Open last August , Bruguera had not played in a Grand_Slam tournament since winning the_French Open last year by defeating Courier in five sets . Some have suggested he isn ' t a true star because of his lack of major tournament victories , but Bruguera has dismissed such criticism . Agusti Pujol , president of the Spanish Tennis Federation , said the_French Open is the most important Grand_Slam tournament for his players because they grow_up playing_on clay . &quot; Concerned we are not , &quot; he said of the criticism . &quot; We don ' t have to justify why Bruguera did not go_to Wimbledon ( last year ) . &quot; Bruguera will make an appearance on the lawn later this month , but he already is downplaying his chances . Berasategui , however , will skip Wimbledon . But then , few thought he could advance so far in Paris . His coach , Javier Durate , tried to drum_up publicity for the 20-year-old from Arrigorriaga by taking him around to newspaper and television_reporters this spring . &quot; Now everybody talks_about him , &quot; Durate said . &quot; I knew his moment would arrive. &quot; It did indeed , although he had to share it with Bruguera and all_of Spain . Notes Bryon Black and Jonathan Stark won the men ' s doubles title by defeating Sweden ' s Jan Apell and Jonas Bjorkman . . . . Kristie Boogert and Menno Oosting of the_Netherlands won the mixed doubles title .</TEXT>
