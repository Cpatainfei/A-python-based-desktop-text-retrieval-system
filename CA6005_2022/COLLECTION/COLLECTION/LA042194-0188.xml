   <HEADLINE> ASSEMBLY PANEL OKS REVIVAL OF QUAKE AID</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An Assembly committee on Wednesday reversed itself and approved legislation to revive a state-operated earthquake insurance program to help homeowners repair damage caused by major temblors . A 6-3 vote -- the minimum required for approval in the Housing and Community Development Committee -- sent the bill , sponsored by Assemblyman Rusty Areias ( D-San Jose ) , to the Insurance Committee for further screening . There was no debate . The same committee rejected the measure by a one-vote margin last week , but Areias received permission to seek reconsideration . The former state earthquake insurance program was repealed last year after critics claimed it was bordering_on insolvency and giving the public a false sense of security . If the program had been in existence Jan . 17 when the Northridge quake occurred , Areias estimated , it would have contained about $ 350 million , enough money to give each of the estimated 60 # 000 to 70 # 000 Los Angeles-area homeowners who had damage a check for about $ 5 # 000 . The new program is designed to provide homeowners with up_to $ 15 # 000 to repair homes damaged by earthquakes . It would cost homeowners a mandatory $ 25 to $ 75 a year , depending_on where they live and the type of home construction .</TEXT>
