   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; POSTCARDS FROM CYBERSPACE ; EXPLORING THE DEPTHS OF THE INTERNET</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you want to explore the bottomless depths of the Internet , a gopher might serve as your guide . Gopher is a ubiquitous Internet program so named for its usefulness in burrowing beneath mound upon mound of data ( and also because it originated at the University of Minnesota , home of the Golden Gophers ) .Gophers are useful because they let you find what you want with easy-to-use menus . A simple way to gopher is just to type &quot; gopher , &quot; since most systems have a default gopher available . But different gopher sites can serve as more direct gateways . One of the biggest such animals lives at Washington and Lee University in Lexington , Va. , and offers a master list of more_than 4 # 000 Internet resources ; just pick one and gopher takes you to it . To connect , type &quot; gopher honor.uc.wlu.edu 1020 &quot; at your command_prompt . Another interesting gopher resides at Pipeline , a new Internet service provider in New York . The gopher menu here is very simple : Internet Highlights , the Reference Desk , Arts &amp; Leisure , Weather Everywhere and Libraries On Line are a_few choices from the top menu . To connect , type &quot; gopher pipeline.com &quot; at the prompt . Remember that you don ' t need any gopher software on_your_own computer ; gophers live mainly on Internet servers . ADAM S .
