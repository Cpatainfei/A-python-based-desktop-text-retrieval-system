   <HEADLINE> FOOD PRESERVATIVES FOUND TO BOOST CANCER FIGHTERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two widely used food preservatives boosted levels of a natural cancer fighter in laboratory animals and appear to do the same thing in humans , a researcher reported Thursday . Advocates of natural foods have long decried the use of preservatives , but Dr. Andrew Dannenberg of Cornell Medical College found that the preservatives BHA and BHT &quot; revved_up &quot; the gene for an enzyme that helps destroy carcinogens before they trigger tumors . When the genes are cranked_up , they produce more of the enzyme , providing better protection against cancer-causing substances in the environment , Dannenberg reported at the International Conference on Cancer Prevention at Rockefeller University in New York . BHA and BHT are synthetic additives used as preservatives in cookies , crackers and a wide variety of other foods . The results do not mean that foods should be pumped up with even more preservatives , Dannenberg said . The findings are important because they uncover a cancer prevention mechanism that appears to be part of the explanation for the well-known anti-cancer properties of broccoli , cauliflower and brussels_sprouts . His research shows that at least part of the effect of those compounds comes from revving_up the same gene affected by BHA and BHT . The gene produces an enzyme with the long name UDP-glucuronosyltransferase , or UGT . The study found elevated levels of the enzyme in the liver , kidneys and small_intestines of rats fed higher doses of BHA and BHT than are normally found in foods , Dannenberg said . He then found preliminary evidence that the substances do the same thing in humans . Dannenberg said he has also found that sulforaphane , an anti-cancer agent recently isolated in broccoli , exerts its action partly in the same way , by revving_up the gene for UGT . The results appear at a time when researchers have become widely convinced of the value of fruits and vegetables in preventing cancer but have made little headway at figuring_out exactly why that ' s true . One problem is that many people avoid the foods with the most potent anti-cancer effects , said Dr. Walter Willett of the Harvard School of Public Health .</TEXT>
