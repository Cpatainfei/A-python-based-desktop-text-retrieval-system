   <HEADLINE> EARTHWATCH : INSURANCE_FIRMS MAY JOIN POLLUTION FIGHT ; THE INDUSTRY FEARS POTENTIAL CATASTROPHES , SUCH AS FLOODS , BROUGHT ON BY SMOG-INDUCED CHANGES IN THE CLIMATE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Before Christmas , Earthwatch reported that the ocean off our coast commences a process of &quot; upwelling &quot; water from its deepest reaches to take_on oxygen before flowing back around the globe . Over eons , this process has left sediment on the sea_bottom that is now being studied as a long-term record of the planet ' s health . The new data suggests that global climate can frequently &quot; turn_on a button , &quot; changed by little things -- even human_activity -- according to Dr. James Kennett , leader of the UC Santa Barbara Marine Science Institute . There ' s more to the story than last week ' s column could cover . Here ' s the rest : In about 90 days , the sun and the sea are soon going_to be linked in a big environmental story because of the global-warming issue . Historic climate and weather changes , recorded in the sea_bottom , along with recent episodes of severe air_pollution trapping the sun ' s light , may be impacting a major world industry : insurance . This spring , the United Nations is convening a major powwow on climate change , with large delegations expected from both the fossil_fuel and insurance industries . The only tribe as powerful as the coal and oil interests , insurers are weighing the possibility that recent weather catastrophes are the first real results of human-induced climate change . Fearing that the worst is yet to come , they see their interests conflicting directly with those of the fossil_fuel industry in the controversy over carbon emissions , that cause smog . The president of the Reinsurance Assn . of America , Franklin Nutter , said recently , &quot; The insurance business is first in_line to be affected by climate change . . . it could bankrupt the industry. &quot; Last time something like this happened , the issue was shoddy , dangerous building practices . So the insurance_companies fought for strict building_codes . They might have to stand_up for strict pollution standards this time . This month they convened a National Hazards Group . We will see its handiwork in March . Meanwhile , while the titans square_off , ordinary California homeowners are already finding notifications of flood-insurance rate hikes in their mail . In some cases , mercifully not yet in our county , it ' s a 50 % increase . In south Los Angeles County , along the Los Angeles and San Gabriel rivers , whole towns are having rates increased and the locals are fighting it because it ' s affecting real_estate values . Insurance actuaries are recalculating risk factors that had been stable for decades . This has also triggered new , complex federal requirements that flood insurance be obtained prior to mortgage transactions . Purchases and sales are being impeded . It ' s like a reverse neutron_bomb -- an environmental problem that , regardless of whether it might harm people ' s health , is affecting their property . This sort of thing could spawn legions of anti-smog activists . &quot; It ' s quite easy to change the climate . A volcanic_eruption , a lot of rain altering oceanic salinity , increased carbon emissions , &quot; explained UCSB ' s Kennett . So far , according to his latest calculations , the planet ' s climate has &quot; flickered , &quot; as he termed it , 21 times over the eons , going from hot to cold , from ice to typhoon . Only the most recent flood has been recorded by eyewitnesses : Both the ancient Hebrews and the Chumash put_out news releases 11 # 000 years ago . You know the one preserved in Genesis 7 , 8 and 9 , but perhaps not the one attributed to the 19th-Century tribal chronicler , Maria Solares . Since the unveiling of data such_as Kennett ' s , and the arrival of the insurance industry in the middle of these environmental goings on , Solares ' version no longer seems merely quaint . Now , it evokes a sensibility more and more people share as we all enter the 25th Earth Year . Here ' s what the Chumash chronicler says : &quot; Spotted Woodpecker , Sun ' s nephew , was the only one saved in the flood . We don ' t know why the flood came or how it started , but it kept raining and the water kept rising higher and higher until even the mountains were covered . &quot; All the people drowned except Woodpecker , who found refuge on top of the tallest tree in the world . The water kept rising until it touched his feet . He cried_out to Sun , ' Help me , Uncle ! I am drowning ! Save me ! ' Sun held his torch down low and the water began to go_down again. &quot; That was when the world was smogless -- and all power was solar . There now seems to be hope this can happen again . Happy New Year .</TEXT>
