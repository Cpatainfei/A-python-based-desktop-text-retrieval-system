   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVES ON THE U.N. POPULATION CONFERENCE ; . . . IT ' S VOODOO SCIENCE ; SOMALIA HAS NO SYSTEM FOR REGISTERING BIRTHS , YET THE WORLD_BANK LISTS ITS POPULATION DOWN TO A 2 % MARGIN OF ERROR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> We all know that chemistry grew out of alchemy , just as astronomy developed from astrology and medicine from witchcraft . What , one wonders , will grow out of &quot; population science ? &quot; The question is not flip , nor the analogy irrelevant as the International Conference on Population and Environment opens in Cairo today . The conference ' s U.N. managers , like the Clinton_Administration and private-sector population-controllers who dominated pre-Cairo U.S. policy-planning , will insist that their prescription for radically expanding coercive state power in the name of &quot; population stability &quot; and &quot; sustainable development &quot; is scientifically grounded . But given what &quot; population science &quot; does not know about the present and cannot tell us about the future , doubts on this score are not merely obscurantist . Consider : * &quot; Population science &quot; cannot predict the growth_rate of human populations over long periods . Because there is no scientific_method for predicting birth or death rates with precision , past projections often look ludicrous ( one U.N. study famously misprojected India ' s population by 100 million ) . But population projections may become even more difficult in the future . Public-health improvements can change mortality_rates rapidly , even if countries remain poor . Birth_rates can drop quickly and sharply , even absent anti-natalist governmental policies ( as in Japan between 1948 and 1958 ) . * &quot; Population science &quot; cannot tell us when ( much less how ) fertility_rates will decline , not least because serious scholarship has determined that the relationship between lower fertility_rates and economic , social and cultural conditions is extraordinarily complex . Does fertility decrease as income increases ? In some cases , yes . But then why does Tadjikistan have both a birth_rate and a per-capita output rate twice that of Sri Lanka ? Yet another myth -- that high levels of health correlate with low fertility -- is contradicted by the fact that life_expectancy in Kenya today ( with a fertility_rate of 6.5 births per woman ) is about the same as in Germany in the 1920s ( fertility_rate : 2.3 ) . * The pretense that Harvard demographer Nick Eberstadt calls &quot; false precision &quot; helps explain why projections in population studies are so difficult . According to Eberstadt , only one-tenth of the Third_World ' s population is covered by reliable registration systems for vital statistics . Somalia , for example , never had a national census until 1985 and has no system for registering births . Yet the World_Bank ' s prestigious World Development Report blithely claims a 2 % margin of error for its Somali population and birth-rate statistics . Given such hard realities , as Eberstadt notes , numbers like these are simply &quot; guesses dignified with decimal points. &quot; * Finally , &quot; population science &quot; has no scientifically precise definition of &quot; overpopulation &quot; -- a shibboleth sure to be invoked repeatedly at Cairo . How would we know when a society was &quot; overpopulated ? &quot; When its &quot; natural increase &quot; ( birth_rate minus death rate ) was unusually high ? Then the United States between 1790 and 1800 had serious overpopulation problems . What about high birth_rates as a measure of &quot; overpopulation ? &quot; That won ' t work , either : the U.S. birthrate in the 1790s was 25 points higher than the latest World_Bank estimates for India , Indonesia and the Philippines . Does &quot; population density &quot; -- the ratio of people to land -- define &quot; overpopulation &quot; precisely ? By that measure , and using 1991 U.N. figures , France is more overpopulated than Indonesia , Japan is much more overpopulated than India and Singapore ( whose government is trying to raise its birth_rate ) is far more overpopulated than Bangladesh . Then what about the &quot; dependency ratio &quot; : the proportion of people under 15 and over 65 to the &quot; working age &quot; population ? On that index , Ireland and Nepal are about equally overpopulated and the least overpopulated places on Earth are Hong Kong and Singapore . Can &quot; overpopulation &quot; be determined by rates of emigration ? Then Mozambique , Angola and Cuba are overpopulated today , as East_Germany would have been before the Berlin Wall went_up in 1961 . The images connoted by &quot; overpopulated &quot; -- disease , hunger , overcrowding -- are not phantoms . But they describe realities that are more accurately denoted as poverty and material deprivation . The Cairo conference might have helped alleviate those problems and the human suffering they cause . It seems unlikely to do so -- it may even make matters worse -- because its planners are in thrall to &quot; population science. &quot; Which suggests that the policies proposed in its name should be treated precisely as we would treat the fantasies of any contemporary astrologer or alchemist .</TEXT>
