   <HEADLINE> COMMENTARY ; HARDING ' S ACTION / INACTION IS ANYTHING BUT OLYMPIAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two weeks from Saturday , during the opening ceremony of the 1994 Winter Games in Lillehammer , Norway , one of the host country ' s cross-country skiers , Vegard Ulvang , will step_forward to deliver the athletes ' oath : &quot; In the name of all_the competitors , I promise that we shall take_part in these Olympic Games , respecting and abiding_by the rules which govern them , in the true spirit of sportsmanship for the glory of sport and the honor of our teams. &quot; If figure skater Tonya Harding is allowed the privilege of participating in the Winter_Olympics , I cannot believe it will be possible for her to recite that oath without words such_as sportsmanship , glory and honor getting stuck_in her throat . With her admission Thursday that she learned afterward that persons close to her had been responsible_for the attack Jan . 6 on Olympic teammate Nancy Kerrigan but chose not to report the information to law_enforcement authorities , it became clear that she had failed in her responsibility as a citizen . More_than that , she failed in her responsibility as an Olympian . Even in a cynical age in which many athletes are running as fast as they can to distance themselves from the idea that they should be role_models , becoming little more_than highly paid shoe salesmen , the public perceives that there still is something special about Olympians . Track_and_field athletes often complain that the media report abuses of anabolic_steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs in that sport as scandals while paying relatively little attention to the same abuses in sports such_as football . My answer is that track_and_field , because of its connection to the Olympics , is -- and should be -- held to a higher standard . As someone who might eventually be called_upon to contribute to a ruling on Harding ' s Olympic status , Anita DeFrantz , a member of the U.S. Olympic Committee ' s executive committee and the International Olympic Committee ' s executive board , was unwilling Thursday to offer either personal or professional opinions about the specifics of this particular situation . Speaking generally , however , she said , &quot; The Olympics work because people believe_in them . If people stop believing_in them , they ' re going to cease to exist . They ' ll become just another track meet. &quot; To assure that people continue believing is the obligation of the IOC , the USOC and other governing bodies associated with them , including the U.S. Figure_Skating Assn . Each has a code_of_conduct , which enables it to take action against athletes or others associated with the team , such_as coaches , trainers or doctors , whose behavior is contrary to that expected of Olympians . According to the USOC ' s code , &quot; All members of the official delegation shall conduct themselves in conformity with the traditions of the Olympic Games and in such a manner that you bring credit and honor to yourself , your teammates , your national governing body , the United States Olympic Committee and the United States of America. &quot; The USOC has used its code_of_conduct to discipline athletes for a wide variety of offenses , from testing positive for banned drugs to stealing a decorative mask from the wall of a hotel lobby in South_Korea . USOC officials said Thursday they could use the code_of_conduct to remove Harding from the team . They should . She said Thursday that her lawyers advised her that failing to report her knowledge of a crime is not a crime . The district_attorney of Multnomah County , Ore. , might argue otherwise . Some lawyers contend that obstruction-of-justice issues could be raised . But regardless of the legal ramifications , she committed a crime against the tenets of sportsmanship and fair play . She said that her action , or non-action , was motivated in part by fear , but part of being an Olympian is having the courage to do the right thing . After Harding won the women ' s title in the recent U.S. championships , she said her motivation for wanting to become the Olympic gold medalist was &quot; the dollar_signs in my head. &quot; If she was willing to accept the potential riches that come_with being associated with the Olympics , she must also accept the responsibilities . * HARDING ' S ADMISSION : Skater says she didn ' t tell authorities what she learned about the attack on Nancy Kerrigan . U.S. Olympic Committee is &quot; deeply concerned. &quot; A1</TEXT>
