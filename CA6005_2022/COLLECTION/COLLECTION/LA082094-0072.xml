   <HEADLINE> CHINA , VIETNAM HOLD FORMAL TALKS ON LONGTIME LAND AND SEA DISPUTES ; ASIA : OIL DRILLING RIGHTS IN THE SOUTH_CHINA_SEA ARE MAIN ISSUE . DIALOGUE MAY HELP EASE ANCIENT CONFLICT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The narrow valley that cuts_through the sheer cliffs and rugged limestone outcroppings on the border separating China and Vietnam is known today on both sides of the frontier as Friendship Pass . But for centuries , China ' s most important southern pass , only 100 miles northeast of Hanoi , carried more belligerent names , such_as Conquering Barbarian Pass and Conquering South Pass . This was the traditional route for invading Chinese armies . No other place better symbolizes the long-standing enmity between China and Vietnam , which has never forgiven 1 # 000 years of Chinese rule that ended in 939 A.D. Chinese and Vietnamese officials met in Hanoi this week to discuss their land and sea boundaries , agreeing to disagree but to keep_on talking . &quot; These talks have brought_about better understanding of each other ' s positions , &quot; Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Ho The Lan told reporters . &quot; However , it is impossible to reach agreement on such complicated questions within one or two negotiations . The two sides agreed to continue their study and negotiations. &quot; Few specifics were reported as_to points that the two sides discussed . But China ' s official news_agency reported that the parties &quot; reached some common views , &quot; including not using force to settle their dispute and keeping_up a dialogue . They apparently reached no consensus on what was clearly their hottest topic : their feud over oil drilling rights in the South_China_Sea . Both countries claim the same stretch of water . Both have hired American oil_companies to exploit it . Although there may have been few immediate results , the meeting was significant , if only because it was the first time that the two Communist countries have held formal negotiations on the difficult question of maritime boundaries . U.S. Assistant Secretary_of_State Winston Lord recently listed the dispute between China and Vietnam over the South_China_Sea as one of the three main threats to peace in Asia , along with the nuclear threat in North_Korea and civil_war in Cambodia . Nearby Southeast Asian_countries see the negotiations as a ray of hope in the effort to resolve one of Asia ' s most intractable problems . But the talks took_place against a backdrop of mutual suspicion and mistrust , which have marked relations between Asia ' s traditional enemies for centuries . Two previous negotiations , in 1974 and 1977 , called to discuss land border issues both ended in failure . Adding_to the difficulty are fears in Vietnam that whoever tries to succeed China ' s ailing , 89-year-old leader , Deng Xiaoping , may need a military adventure to win the support of the powerful Chinese army factions that are the heart of the country ' s power_structure . &quot; It ' s what happens after Deng dies that worries us most , &quot; said a military official in Hanoi . They remember that in 1979 , only one year after he was recognized as the successor to Mao Tse-tung , Deng launched a brief , bloody war against Vietnam -- China ' s traditional foe -- that helped him consolidate his power . Never mind that the invasion was a military failure , thwarted by Vietnamese forces here in Lang Son , that cost the lives of several thousand Chinese soldiers . Vietnamese fears of Chinese ambitions in the region have been stoked by recent front-page articles in the Chinese People ' s Daily newspaper praising the heroic dedication of Chinese soldiers &quot; serving the sacred territory of our great motherland &quot; in garrisons stationed on the disputed Spratly Islands . According to Nghia Le Xuan , chairman of the Vietnam Border Committee charged with negotiating territorial disputes with the visiting Chinese , the Vietnam government is also alarmed by the recent publication in China of several books detailing proposed strategic battle_plans for the capture of the Spratlys -- which the Chinese call the Nansha Islands -- and even the invasion of the Vietnamese mainland . In addition to Vietnam and China , the chain of minute atolls and spits of land that make_up the Spratly Islands is also claimed by four other countries -- Malaysia , Indonesia , the Philippines and Brunei . Although marked as &quot; classified , &quot; the books detailing the Chinese strategies are readily available in bookstores in Guangzhou ( formerly Canton ) and other southern Chinese cities where the feeling of Chinese manifest_destiny is strongest . Chinese officials , meanwhile , contend that Vietnam ' s fears are unfounded . To demonstrate their good_faith , the Chinese have proposed to temporarily &quot; shelve &quot; territorial disputes in the South_China_Sea so that the mineral resources can be developed jointly and cooperatively . Foreign military experts contend that , in fact , China does not yet have the long-range military resources needed to enforce its claims in the Spratlys and adjacent areas . Chinese claims on the Spratlys , some diplomats contend , are part of a complex lobbying effort by factions of the military to upgrade its equipment . Important senior officers in the Chinese military have argued in recent years for the creation of a &quot; blue water &quot; navy , including aircraft_carriers and long-range naval aircraft to defend their vast claims in the South_China_Sea . On the agenda for negotiators , led_on the Chinese side by Deputy Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxue and one the Vietnamese side by Deputy Foreign Minister Vo Quang , were three areas of dispute -- the 690-mile land border , territorial disputes in the Gulf of Tonkin and issues involving the South_China_Sea . Regarding the land border , both sides have agreed in principle to observe the boundaries set_in an 1897 treaty signed between the Qing Dynasty and the_French colonial government in Vietnam . But according to the Vietnamese there are 236 places on the border where China has crossed the 1897 line , including territory never returned after the 1979 invasion . Talks on the Gulf of Tonkin are still at a preliminary stage . The most bitter dispute centered_on the South_China_Sea . Here the two sides cannot even agree on a name . The Chinese call the body_of_water Nan Hai ( South_Sea ) , and the Vietnamese term it Bien Dong ( East Sea ) . The two names clearly reflect the different geographic perspectives . In particular , the Vietnamese are infuriated with the Chinese for granting an oil exploration concession to Colorado-based Crestone Energy Corp. , in an area they claim is_on their continental_shelf . The Chinese call the area Wan ' An . To the Vietnamese it is known as Tu ' Chinh . The Chinese claim that the territory belongs_to them on the basis of their claim to the nearby Spratlys . They claim that Vietnam , in fact , has violated Chinese territory by granting an adjacent area for exploration to Mobil Oil Co . But Chinese officials say they are willing to compromise and work jointly with Vietnam to develop the 25 # 155-square kilometer body_of_water 168 miles off the Vietnamese coast . So far the Vietnamese have reacted icily to the Chinese proposal to share the area . &quot; The Chinese say they want to ' shelve ' the dispute , &quot; Nghia snapped , &quot; but they are aimed at our continental shelf. &quot;</TEXT>
