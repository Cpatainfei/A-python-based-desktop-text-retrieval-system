   <HEADLINE> BERNARDI IN GUARDED CONDITION AFTER HEART_ATTACK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Former San Fernando Valley City Councilman Ernani Bernardi suffered a heart_attack Thursday morning as he was being treated for unrelated health_problems at a Panorama City hospital , authorities said . The ailing 81-year-old saxophonist-turned-politician is in &quot; guarded condition &quot; at Kaiser Permanente Medical_Center ' s cardiac care unit , said hospital spokeswoman Magdalena Beltran-del Olmo . She said it was too early to tell how serious the attack was or to make a prognosis for his recovery . Bernardi was admitted Feb . 11 for treatment of other problems , but Beltran-del Olmo said Bernardi ' s family requested that no additional information be released . However , friends and former colleagues said Bernardi has appeared sickly since his wife of 60 years , Lucille Bernardi , died in October after a bout with Alzheimer ' s disease . They said he was being treated at the hospital for an unspecified prostate problem . Maria Fant , president of the North Hollywood Residents Assn . and a close political ally , said Bernardi ' s family told her that the heart_attack was very serious . Bernardi , who became the longest-serving council_member , has also been the city ' s fiercest foe of community redevelopment programs , which he views_as wasteful . In fact , he sued the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday over a community redevelopment program that he has spent years fighting . The lawsuit accuses the board of violating state open-meeting laws when it held a closed-door session in December to discuss lifting a spending cap on a downtown redevelopment project . Bernardi has filed a similar suit against the city of Los Angeles for private meetings that two city panels held_on the same subject in December . Fant said that despite his health_problems , Bernardi has continued to be a devout advocate for eliminating wasteful spending . Bernardi , who represented the East Valley , was elected to the City_Council in 1960 . He retired in June . Staff writer Julie Tamaki contributed to this story .</TEXT>
