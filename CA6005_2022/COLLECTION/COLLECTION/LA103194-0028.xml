   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : TODAY ' S TOPIC ; HAS THE INITIATIVE PROCESS , WHICH WAS INTENDED TO LET THE PEOPLE BE HEARD , GONE AMOK ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With Election_Day a week away , there is fever-pitch campaigning not only by the candidates but for the five initiatives as well . The stakes in this election are high as these measures will likely be around long after any of the politicians leave_office . Consider the tax-slashing Proposition 13 , which the voters approved in 1978 at a time of budgetary surplus in Sacramento . &quot; Proposition 13 is emblematic of what the initiative process is about , &quot; says H . Eric Schockman , a political_science professor at USC . &quot; It ultimately represented the will of the people at that time and they determined the future of California and how it developed , &quot; Schockman says . &quot; Proposition 13 was a Draconian piece of legislation that started the decline of California . We ' re paying now for the greed of the past. &quot; Some worry that , if passed , the initiatives will have a negative effect on the prison system , immigration and local control over limiting smoking . &quot; There are not an overwhelming number of initiatives on the ballot this year but those that do appear are very hot-button political issues , &quot; says Ruth Holton , executive_director of Common Cause . &quot; The public is frustrated . They ' re angry . They feel they haven ' t seen the Legislature take action , particularly with immigration and crime. &quot; Ironically , the Legislature did act_on one issue : crime . Earlier this year , the state passed a &quot; three strikes &quot; law that requires mandatory sentences for repeat offenders . In today ' s Community Essay , former Glendale fire Capt . John L . Orr , who is serving a prison_term for arson , argues that the &quot; three strikes &quot; law is having a chilling effect on inmates . With a &quot; three-strikes &quot; law already on the books , why have another , especially one that would require a two-thirds vote of the Legislature to change ? The answer most likely lies_with understanding the initiative process . Begun at the turn_of_the_century by a former governor , Hiram Johnson , initiatives were designed to overcome legislative gridlock by allowing any citizen to propose a law and take it directly to the voters . &quot; Lately , we have seen special_interests usurping the political process and we ' ve seen craven politicians back initiatives for political advantage , &quot; says Harvey Rosenfeld , a public interest lawyer . &quot; Rather than initiatives being an exercise in democracy , we are using the process to bring_out the worst in people , &quot; adds Rosenfeld , who was the force behind Proposition 103 in 1988 , which was aimed at controlling automobile_insurance rates . The result of next week ' s election may_not be greater restrictions on immigration or a massive prison system for the growing inmate population . The long-term effect may be whether ordinary citizens still believe that initiatives speak_for them . &quot; This country has never been able to function as a direct democracy , &quot; Schockman says . &quot; This particular anomaly is a Frankenstein creation that has come_back to haunt us. &quot;</TEXT>
