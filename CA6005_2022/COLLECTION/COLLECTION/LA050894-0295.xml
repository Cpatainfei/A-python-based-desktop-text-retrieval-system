   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : BEVERLY HILLS ; CITY HOPING TO CASH IN ON WORLD CUP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dismiss the fact that the World Cup soccer games this summer will be played miles away in Pasadena . City officials have some goals of_their_own in mind : They want Beverly Hills to be the social hub of the festivities . Other cities may have plans to woo tourists , too , but surely none will try with chimpanzees , enough paella to feed 500 people or a Swiss tradition involving 35 wooden cows . &quot; Beverly Hills stepped_out , realizing there is an opportunity with international tourists coming_to the Los Angeles area , &quot; said Mayor Vicki Reynolds . &quot; And Beverly Hills is one of the top -- if not the top -- tourist destination in Los Angeles County . We ' re going to take_advantage of the opportunity to promote Beverly Hills. &quot; The city ' s monthlong series of special events , &quot; Beverly Hills Salutes the World , &quot; is aimed at cashing_in_on the estimated 800 # 000 visitors whom World Cup organizers predict will spend $ 621 million in Southern California during the June 17 to July 17 tournament at the Rose Bowl . The city has earmarked $ 70 # 000 for street banners and other expenses to organize the event in which each day will honor one of 24 countries participating in the World Cup . The events range from the exotic to the excessive . Organizers of Nigeria ' s day , for instance , hope to bring a baby elephant , cheetah , lion and chimpanzees to Rodeo Drive to highlight the country ' s wildlife . Spain is going_to lead a cook-off with the preparation of a 2 # 200-pound paella -- stirred with a shovel . On Switzerland ' s day , to symbolize the tradition , there will be a re-enactment of leading cows up the Alps for grazing . In this case , 35 life-size wooden cows adorned with flowers will be posed as if walking through the faux-European shopping_mall of Two Rodeo . City eateries hope to get a piece of the action , said restaurateur David Slay , who predicted Beverly Hills will top tourists ' lists of places to visit . &quot; Sure , tourists will want to see the ocean , and will visit Santa Monica . But I have friends in the restaurant business there , and they have never been contacted by anyone about the World Cup , &quot; said Slay , who is organizing fellow restaurateurs to promote the eateries during the World Cup . Representatives of the West_African country Cameroon said they were thrilled when Beverly Hills approached them to join in the events . &quot; It certainly boosted our morale , &quot; said Sequoia Mercier , the local spokeswoman for JEMEA , a group of about 200 Cameroon artists who will promote their country ' s culture during the games . They will hold an art_exhibition in Beverly Hills . Pasadena officials said Beverly Hills would not be cornering the market on entertaining visitors . &quot; We really don ' t see ( Beverly Hills ) as competition . We believe more people will want to stay here since we ' re the venue city , &quot; said Denise Nelson Nash , the city ' s World Cup coordinator . She said it has been estimated that 1.6 million people will visit Pasadena -- 100 # 000 spectators per game in the Rose Bowl . Nine games have been scheduled for the stadium . Pasadena will hold 30 events for residents and visitors during the monthlong tournament , which culminates in the championship match July 17 , she said . &quot; Beverly Hills is quite a trek for some people , &quot; said Nash . &quot; But the more activities and excitement surrounding World Cup , the better for all_of us. &quot; Reynolds agreed , up_to a point . Beverly Hills , she said , is simply better known around the world than Pasadena . &quot; With the numbers of tourists they expect , there is plenty for everyone . But I just think that with so many international tourists , their natural focus is here in Beverly Hills. &quot; SUSAN STEINBERG</TEXT>
