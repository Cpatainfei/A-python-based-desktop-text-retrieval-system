   <HEADLINE> LIBRARY TO HONOR NIXON ' S INAUGURAL ; POLITICS : PLANS WILL BE UNVEILED FOR THINK_TANK FOCUSING_ON EX-PRESIDENT ' S PRINCIPLES IN FOREIGN_POLICY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Shortly before noon today , 25 years after he stood on the steps of the nation ' s capital and swore to uphold the Constitution , former President Richard Milhous Nixon will stand_in the shadow of his boyhood home and celebrate the part of his past that was glorious . Amid much fanfare and surrounded by memorabilia from his inauguration as the nation ' s 37th President , Nixon will hear accolades about foreign_policy achievements , be hailed as the sage from whom world leaders now seek advice , and pose for a commemorative photograph with his former colleagues . And in tribute to Nixon -- the only American President who resigned after being disgraced by political scandal -- the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace will mark the 25th anniversary of his inauguration with the unveiling of plans for the Center for Peace and Freedom . The think_tank will be dedicated to Nixon ' s principles of &quot; enlightened national interest in foreign_policy and pragmatic idealism in domestic affairs. &quot; Or as one library official said Wednesday , the center will use Nixon ' s &quot; hard-headed , pragmatic , realistic focus_on what can be accomplished , rather than what we hope to be accomplished &quot; as a model for making policy on foreign and domestic issues . About 1 # 000 invited guests are expected to attend the event , which is closed to the public but will be broadcast later in the day by C-SPAN . A fund-raising_drive for the library and new policy center , which is scheduled to open in 1997 , was boosted with the announcement Wednesday that the Annenberg Foundation will make a $ 5-million challenge grant . As of Wednesday , the &quot; Legacy for Peace &quot; campaign had raised $ 13.5 million of its $ 25-million goal . * The Annenberg Foundation is named for former Ambassador Walter H . Annenberg , who announced during a White_House ceremony in December that the foundation would donate $ 500 million for U.S. schools . Of the $ 25 million to be raised , $ 20 million will be used to fund an endowment , with some of the income used to defray the operating_costs of the Nixon library , as well as programming at the policy center . * Although officials say the library is financially sound , federal tax documents filed by the facility in November showed it had lost $ 1.5 million during two years of operation . It is the only presidential library in the nation to operate without federal funds . In 1974 , Congress refused to give Nixon the papers and tape_recordings from his presidency , making the library ineligible to become part of the National Archives system until the law is amended . Headquartered in Yorba Linda , the new policy center will establish eight endowed chairs -- six in the area of foreign_policy and two focusing_on domestic issues -- reflecting the primary focus that the Nixon Administration paid to foreign relations . It is in the area of foreign_policy that Nixon achieved his greatest success , Nixon observers said . &quot; Nobody would want to hear what he has to say ( on domestic issues ) , &quot; said Stephen E . Ambrose , a Nixon biographer and history professor at the University of New Orleans . &quot; It was not an interest of his and certainly not a strength. &quot;</TEXT>
