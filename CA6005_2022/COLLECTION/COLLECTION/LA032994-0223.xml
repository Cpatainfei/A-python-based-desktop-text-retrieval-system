   <HEADLINE> AIRLINE TICKETING COMPANY IS BANKRUPT ; LIQUIDATION : JUDGE ISSUES CHAPTER 7 ORDER BECAUSE IRVINE FIRM OWES $ 2.2 MILLION TO CREDITORS AND EMPLOYEES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Airline Computerized Ticketing in Irvine , which just months ago promoted the success of its electronic airline ticketing machines , was recently ordered into bankruptcy liquidation by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge William R . Greendyke in Houston . In 1987 , JoAnne Stewart founded the company that specialized in electronic ticketing of flights after plans had been arranged by a travel_agent . &quot; It ' s not the end of the world , &quot; said Stewart , who said Monday that she plans this week to petition the court to reorganize her company ' s debts under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act . &quot; We ' re picking_up the pieces and moving_on . I don ' t die easily. &quot; Greendyke made the Chapter 7 order Wednesday against J.E. Marion Inc. , the parent company of Airline Computerized Ticketing . Court filings estimated the company owed nearly $ 2 million to nearly 70 creditors , in addition to nearly $ 200 # 000 owed to eight employees , seven of whom worked in Houston . &quot; We just simply wanted to get paid , &quot; said Jeff Hoffman , former chief operating officer and company president from Houston , one of the creditors in the case . Hoffman said he was owed $ 51 # 000 in salary and vacation pay . He was not paid_for three months because his paychecks either bounced or never arrived , he said . &quot; I don ' t know what happened . All the money and all_the accounts were maintained in California , &quot; Hoffman said . Arthur Morello , an attorney with Pettit &amp; Martin in Newport Beach , said the parent company was placed in Chapter 7 after former creditors and employees petitioned the U.S. Bankruptcy Court Southern District in Texas Jan . 5 . Morello represents several creditors and Debbie George , Airline Computerized Ticketing ' s former marketing manager , who said she is owed $ 12 # 000 in back salary and $ 12 # 000 in_stock options . &quot; Are my clients going_to get their money ? We are very hopeful that they will , &quot; Morello said . On Dec . 7 , Stewart allegedly let_go a group of Houston employees and operations staff as part of a cutback . &quot; There were some disgruntled employees who did not want the company to continue on without them , &quot; Stewart , the company chairman , said Monday . &quot; My company is not over , we ' re just beginning. &quot; In a Feb . 3 written court response to the creditors claims , Airline Computerized Ticketing said the &quot; petition has been brought_in bad faith . The dispute involved disgruntled employees who resigned upon notice that they were to be terminated in December , 1993 , as a result of a planned downsizing of &quot; company operations . The company also admitted that it was &quot; not paying its debts as they came due. &quot; Last year , Airline Computerized Ticketing had installed ticket machines in downtown Los Angeles at 725 S . Figueroa St . and at 3 MGM Plaza in Santa Monica . Another was operating in New York ' s Rockefeller Center . In an interview last September , Stewart said she started her business with $ 5 million from her own savings and from friends and family . She predicted that 300 ticket machines offering both discount and full-fare tickets would be placed nationwide by the end of 1993 . She also predicted 5 # 000 machines would be in hotels , banks and shopping_centers by 1998 . &quot; When you are trying to follow someone ' s dream , there comes a time when that dream has to become a reality , &quot; said Pam Stutes , a former customer service representative in Houston who said she is owed $ 884.55 in back salary . &quot; But I think she ( Stewart ) thought she was losing_control over her Houston staff . She didn ' t realize we were trying to make her company successful. &quot; Computerized Ticketing * Founded : 1987 * Status : Forced into Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation by unpaid employees Wednesday * President and founder : JoAnne Stewart * Headquarters : Irvine Concept : Dispenses airline tickets via electronic vending_machines Source : Times reports ; Airline Computerized Ticketing ; Researched by JANICE L .
