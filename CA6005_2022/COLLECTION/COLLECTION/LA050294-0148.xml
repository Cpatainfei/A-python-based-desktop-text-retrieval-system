   <HEADLINE> CLINTON , CHINA OFFICIAL TO MEET AS TRADE DEADLINE NEARS ; DIPLOMACY : THE WHITE_HOUSE REFUSES TO DISCUSS UNANNOUNCED MEETING WITH ZOU JIAHUA . IT MAY BE LAST HIGH-LEVEL TALK BEFORE A DECISION ON TRADE BENEFITS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A senior Chinese emissary will have an unannounced White_House meeting with President Clinton today in what will probably be the last high-level talks before the Administration decides whether to renew China ' s trade privileges in this country , senior officials said Sunday . The visitor is Chinese Vice Premier Zou Jiahua , who arrived in Washington over the weekend . For the last week , Zou has been traveling in Canada and elsewhere in the United States , and was present at former President Richard Nixon ' s funeral in Yorba Linda . The White_House refused to say anything about Zou ' s meeting with Clinton or what its purpose is . But it is the latest sign that there may be some high-level secret diplomacy under way between the United States and China as Clinton nears a June 3 deadline for deciding what to do about China ' s trade benefits . Over the last few weeks , the Administration has been showing signs of increasing volatility and nervousness in its dealings with the Beijing government . On Saturday , the Administration apparently reversed a decision reached the previous day by putting_off plans to target China on the separate trade issue of pirating U.S. movies , music and software . &quot; We ' re in a very delicate time in terms of our engagement with China , &quot; U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor observed over the weekend . Zou is in a position to tell the Administration how much the Beijing government intends to do over the next few weeks to satisfy U.S. complaints about China ' s human_rights policies . For example , Zou could tell the White_House officially , as other Chinese emissaries have informally , that China will finally stop its jamming of Voice of America broadcasts inside China . And Zou might be able to tell the Administration whether the Chinese regime intends to release any more political_prisoners . For his part , Clinton will have a chance in the meeting with Zou to tell the Chinese government directly whether he plans to cut_back on China ' s trade benefits this year and whether he plans to phase_out the linkage between human_rights and trade privileges in coming years . Like almost all other countries , China enjoys &quot; most favored nation &quot; trading benefits , which permit Chinese products to be exported to this country under low tariff rates . In the years after the 1989 Tian An Men Square crackdown , Congress repeatedly passed legislation that would have required China to improve the human_rights climate to win annual renewals of MFN , but former President George_Bush always vetoed such legislation . During his 1992 presidential campaign , Clinton heaped criticism upon Bush for &quot; coddling dictators &quot; in Beijing . After coming_to the White_House , Clinton issued an executive order spelling_out a series of human_rights improvements that China should make in_order to keep receiving MFN benefits . However , throughout the last year , the Administration has had trouble persuading the Chinese regime that it is serious about the threat to revoke trade benefits . Chinese officials , such_as Premier Li Peng , have said repeatedly that they do not believe the United States will revoke MFN status for China because such action would hurt U.S. companies as well as Chinese ones . Over the last two months , the Chinese regime has seemed to be going_out of its way to adopt a defiant posture toward the United States and other Western countries . Chinese security officials rounded_up dissidents during visits to Beijing by Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher and by French Premier Edouard Balladur . The Clinton_Administration has been exploring a number of options for cutting_back partially on China ' s trade benefits without revoking them entirely . For example , one possibility would be to lift the MFN trade privileges for China ' s state-run enterprises but to preserve the benefits for private enterprises . &quot; There ' s a lot of contingency planning for a lot of potential outcomes , &quot; one senior U.S. official said Sunday . Ordinarily , Zou would be an unlikely candidate to be handling what could be the future of relations between China and the United States . He is responsible_for Beijing ' s state planning apparatus , the still-socialist elements in the Chinese economy . But Zou is a useful emissary because he enjoys close ties to the more conservative elements of China ' s leadership . He is closely identified with Chen Yun , the octogenarian leader who ranks as the second most senior figure in the Chinese Communist_Party after the ailing Deng Xiaoping . Zou will be the first senior Chinese official whom Clinton has met since he held talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Seattle last November .</TEXT>
