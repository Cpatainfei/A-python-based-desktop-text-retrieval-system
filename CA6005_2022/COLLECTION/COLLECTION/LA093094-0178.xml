   <HEADLINE> SWEDES ENDURE HEARTACHE OVER FERRY DISASTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Police were writing tickets , patrolling the streets and making arrests , but the Stockholm police_department , like much of Sweden , was finding the heartache Thursday nearly too_much to bear . Sixty-eight employees of the police_force were among the passengers aboard the ferryboat Estonia , which sank_in the turbulent Baltic Sea early Wednesday in one of Europe ' s worst maritime disasters . Five employees survived , but the others are among the more_than 800 people still missing and presumed dead . &quot; It is like a whole generation has vanished , &quot; said a teary-eyed Lotta Eriksson , who like the victims is a civilian employee of the department . &quot; There is an enormous emptiness everywhere , in the canteen , in the corridors. &quot; The police employees , who were attending a union seminar aboard the Estonia , were among a handful of large groups from communities across Sweden that made_up much of the passenger list . In a country where ferry cruises are a favorite national pastime , images of pajama-clad corpses being snatched from the sea have created a deep sense of agony not felt since the assassination of Prime_Minister Olof Palme eight years ago . &quot; People are exhausted both physically and emotionally , &quot; said Soren Carlsson , chief nurse at Stockholm ' s Sodersjukhuset , a hospital where some of the 140 survivors have been treated . &quot; There is sadness today . Maybe the anger comes tomorrow. &quot; In the central Swedish town of Jonkoping , anguished church officials were at_a_loss to explain why 15 evangelists returning from a Bible trip to Estonia were consumed by the sea . Six members of the group survived , but the loss was so great to the Pentecostal Church ' s Bible school that officials expect to have to cancel the program . &quot; The headmaster and another teacher are among the missing , &quot; said Bo-Eric Malmvall , a church board_member who was comforting distraught relatives Thursday . &quot; Hope is very small right now . The church has been open day and night , but we don ' t have answers. &quot; The mood was equally melancholy in the eastern town of Norrkoping , where none of the 56 members of a retirement club have turned_up alive . The club had organized one of its many getaway excursions , this time to the Estonian capital of Tallinn for some shopping and sightseeing . For about $ 120 each , members got meals , lodging and transportation for three days . The sense of horror in the industrial town southwest of Stockholm was made worse by accounts Thursday of the panic aboard the sinking vessel . Some survivors hospitalized in Finland spoke_of desperate efforts to get_off the ship , with some frail and elderly passengers , knowing that they could not make_it , giving_up and dropping to the floor in tears . &quot; People here are seeing pictures in their minds of their relatives and friends trapped in the ferry at the bottom of the sea , &quot; said Gert Forge , a psychiatric nurse at the Norrkoping senior_citizen center . &quot; The biggest problem here is that none of the 56 has been found. &quot; Finnish Coast Guard Capt . Raimo Tiilikainen , who is in_charge of the rescue effort , said 65 bodies had been retrieved from the sea by late Thursday . Although accounts continue to vary on the number of people on board , authorities say there are as_many as 800 still in the sunken boat or lost at_sea . Finnish forensic pathologist Antti Jaaskelainen said the job of identifying the bodies was under way , but the effort has been difficult because the victims were exposed for many hours to the cold seawater . Family members have been asked to provide photos , medical_records and , in some cases , personal objects that might be used for DNA matching tests . In Stockholm , owners of the ferry apologized for the disaster and said they were eagerly searching for one of the craft ' s two captains , who was reported by Finnish authorities to have survived . Officials from Estline , the ferry ' s part owners , said they have not been able to locate Estonian Capt . Ahvo Piht . &quot; I am sure he will be able to provide valuable information , &quot; said Sten-Crister Forsberg , executive_vice_president of Nordstrom &amp; Thulin , Estline ' s Swedish parent company . &quot; I can assure you , in that weather he was probably on the bridge. &quot; Forsberg said the cause of the sinking was still unknown , but he hinted that the investigation was focusing_on eyewitness accounts of water flooding the large car deck . Although Forsberg insisted that the seals on the deck ramps were not faulty , he said the flooded deck was probably &quot; the main cause of the accident. &quot; Per Forsskahl , managing director of the Finnish Ship Owners Assn. , also said water leaking into the ship probably caused the accident , and he pointed an accusing finger at the crew . &quot; There must have been something wrong with the way the crew handled the situation , &quot; he said . Swedish and Finnish news_reports have speculated that the Estonian crew was not up_to the job , was hired on the cheap and may have contributed to problems because of inexperience and some language_barriers . Estline officials said the Estonian crew_members were qualified to run the vessel . The magnitude of the disaster -- and the level of exasperation -- grew Thursday when the Finnish coast guard reported that the ferry had apparently been carrying 1 # 049 passengers and crew_members , instead of 964 , as it had previously said . But in Stockholm , Estline officials said 982 people were_on board . There was even disagreement over who belonged on the passenger list . Above flowers and candles left by grieving friends and relatives in Tallinn , a long tally of victims was taped to a ferry terminal wall . Among them was 26-year-old Kulli Tanava . But Tanava had not been_on the ferry . She had taken it two days earlier . &quot; No , I am not calling from the ship , &quot; she told Tallinn ' s KUKU radio Thursday . &quot; I am alive and well. &quot; Murphy reported from Stockholm and Walsh from Turku , Finland . Times special correspondent Eva Tarm in Tallinn , Estonia , also contributed to this report .
