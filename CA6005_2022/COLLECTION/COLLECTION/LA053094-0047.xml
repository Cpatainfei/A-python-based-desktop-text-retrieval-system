   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP GIVES ARTIST CHANCE TO SEND MESSAGE ; ART : WILLIE HERRON ' S MURAL SALUTING THE SOCCER TOURNAMENT WILL WELCOME LAX ' S DIVERSE VISITORS WITH A CALL FOR UNITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For Laguna Hills muralist Willie Herron , the part of the World Cup soccer tournament that will be played in Los Angeles represents far more_than just the ending of an international ball_game . It ' s an opportunity for him to capture , symbolically through art , the uniting of hundreds of ethnically and racially diverse players -- many on the same teams -- from around the globe in the struggle to achieve a single goal . In his giant World Cup mural , which was unveiled in a San Juan Capistrano studio Sunday in its nearly completed form , Herron conveys his greatest hope : that , like the soccer players , the people of the world will unite , then struggle to cure their mutual ills . The title of his banner-like mural is &quot; Solo Unido Un Mundo Vencera &quot; ( Spanish for &quot; only united can one world be victorious &quot; ) . It is one of five that will welcome long-distance travelers to Los Angeles and commemorate the World Cup . &quot; I like to take a problem and create something positive from that in an image , &quot; Herron said of his mural , referring to the inability of many nations to work together . The mural reflects his vision of a better world . &quot; This mural was inspired more_than anything else by a futuristic kind of feeling. &quot; The painting is an image of a group of nondescript athletes -- Herron intentionally leaves nationality out of the picture -- helping one another reach up toward a globe and a World Cup trophy . This week , the 50-foot-high , 40-foot-wide mural will be rolled_up and then trucked to Los Angeles International Airport , where it will hang from a parking structure facing the International Terminal . Travelers will be greeted by Herron ' s work for the next 4 1 / 2 years . &quot; It ' s a great way to welcome people from around the world to Los Angeles , &quot; said Mission Viejo resident and bus_driver Mark Andrews , who spent an hour Sunday gazing at and photographing the mural . &quot; I see a message we should all seriously think_about : ' One world , one people. ' As long as we ' re working against each other we won ' t make it. &quot; Herron is a Los Angles native who is_best known for his public art work in East Los Angeles . Those murals , painted on buildings or structures , deal with Latino and social issues . Herron was one of five painters commissioned to paint murals across Los Angeles for the World Cup soccer tournament , which begins in June . Eight games -- the finals -- will be played in Pasadena ' s Rose Bowl . The other four World Cup murals have been hung along freeway routes between LAX and the Rose Bowl . The mural program was commissioned by the Social and Public Resource Center in Venice . Herron , who usually earns about $ 30 a square_foot for the murals he paints , will earn just $ 5 a square_foot for his World Cup project . He ' ll split that with his partner and protege , Umberto Caiafa . &quot; It ' s nothing ; we ' re basically doing_it for free , &quot; Herron said of the commission . The two have worked 12- to 20-hour shifts over the last seven weeks to complete the mural . Utilizing the stimulative effects of coffee , jazz and various forms of upbeat Latin music , they have meticulously painted the 2 # 000-square-foot mural one tiny section at a time . About 30 different colors of acrylic_paint were used . Herron and Caiafa rushed to complete the work by Sunday ' s public reception , but were unable to finish painting the World Cup trophy that will be situated toward the top of the mural . &quot; We were up until 5 a.m. this morning trying to finish . I ' m very tired , &quot; said Caiafa , 29 , in a heavy Italian accent . &quot; I feel empty now. &quot; Wearing dark sunglasses to hide his tired and bloodshot eyes , 42-year-old Herron bounced from one guest or reception-related duty to another inside the warehouse during the public viewing . The consensus among dozens of local residents who dropped_by to view the mural Sunday was that the artists ' long hours of work had paid_off . &quot; The color work and the texture are good and the movement of the athletes is very exciting , &quot; commented artist Connie King , who lives_in Irvine , as she viewed the mural . &quot; I can ' t wait to see it all stretched_out at the airport. &quot; Herron said the mural should be hanging at LAX by the end of the week .</TEXT>
