   <HEADLINE> UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES HAUNT WELFARE REFORMERS ; BENEFITS : ATTEMPTS TO OVERHAUL PROGRAMS RESULTED IN UNEXPECTED SOCIAL PROBLEMS . CLINTON TRIES TO AVOID PITFALLS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the federal_government established its first broad public assistance program as part of the New Deal reforms of 1935 , its authors saw it primarily as a way to support needy widows and their children . No one could have predicted that nearly six decades later , more_than half of the recipients would be unwed mothers , and Aid to Families With Dependent Children would be widely blamed for subsidizing out-of-wedlock childbirth and destroying families . Likewise , when Congress created a generous medical plan for welfare families during the Great Society of the 1960s , no one expected that it would leave parents feeling trapped in the system , reluctant to take jobs for fear of losing their Medicaid benefits . And when President Ronald Reagan tightened the rules governing the maximum earnings and assets that welfare recipients could have without losing their benefits , the last thing he wanted was to encourage welfare over work . &quot; There ' s no greater gap between our good intentions and our misguided consequences than you see in the welfare system , &quot; President Clinton said as he introduced his welfare reform package last week in the lobby of a Kansas City , Mo. , bank . &quot; It started for the right purpose of helping people who fall by the wayside . . . . But for many , the system has worked to undermine the very values that people need to put themselves and their lives back on track. &quot; Mindful of the lessons of the past , the Clinton_Administration hopes it has seen the potential pitfalls clearly enough to avoid creating its own unintended consequences . Nonetheless , welfare specialists warn that despite their good intentions , the President ' s reformists still could produce a range of undesirable repercussions -- from an increase in the ranks of homeless children to the development of a public works program much larger and costlier than the Administration anticipates . It is difficult to accurately foresee the effects of major social change when political concerns are forcing the policies to be put_in place so rapidly , said Mark Greenberg , a senior attorney at the Center for Law and Public Policy . In a different political climate , most of the initiatives in the Administrations ' s plan probably would have been tested first , he added . The President ' s plan would offer welfare recipients born after 1971 a new_deal . The government would provide job training or education to people who are not &quot; job ready. &quot; But after two years , participants would have to find work in the private sector or spend 15 to 30 hours a week in a government-subsidized job . Child_care would be offered as a further inducement . Those who refuse to participate would lose their welfare benefits entirely . The proposal also would enforce laws requiring unwed mothers to identify the fathers of their children and would tighten child-support collection procedures . The reform plan also calls_for a national campaign designed to discourage teen-age pregnancy and a new requirement that teen-age mothers live with a parent or guardian to qualify for government assistance . Some Democrats in Congress and liberal welfare experts believe that by cutting all cash assistance to parents who refuse to get jobs , the government could hurt children , the very people the program was created to protect . &quot; I ' m particularly concerned about the two-year time_limit , &quot; said Rep . Robert T . Matsui ( D-Sacramento ) . &quot; If it ' s enforced strictly , it could result in orphanages being set_up and children being taken from their parents and put there or in the bankrupt foster-care system. &quot; Administration officials argue that given the stark choice between going without and having to work , parents will think_about what ' s best for their children and report to their jobs . But Doug Besharov , a welfare expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute , said this view &quot; seriously underestimates the inertia factor. &quot; Even some Administration officials who worked_on the plan quietly expressed their own worries about the time_limit . &quot; My biggest fear is that the sanction gets applied quite punitively and the reform does not provide the help we intended it to provide , so welfare becomes an even more adversarial place than it is now , &quot; said one Administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity . The time_limit is not the only part of the Clinton plan that bothers experts . Robert Greenstein , executive_director of the liberal Center_on Budget and Policy Priorities , said the President ' s plan would turn welfare into the &quot; biggest training_program ever mounted , &quot; with 900 # 000 people in mandatory education and training by 1997 . In Iowa , where a new state law requires everyone receiving welfare benefits to participate in education or training_programs aimed at preparing them for jobs , local officials complain that they are quickly running_out of slots . Another part of the President ' s plan , subsidized work for those who cannot find positions in the private labor_market , also lies_in uncharted territory . If states are forced to create large_numbers of subsidized jobs , they could unintentionally drive down wages for unskilled workers . &quot; The whole structure is untested , &quot; Greenstein said . &quot; We really do not know until we try what it will work like in the real_world . It would have been better if the Administration was proposing major demonstrations before phasing it in. &quot; Other specialists said the states are unlikely to create enough jobs , thereby producing an entirely different accidental effect . &quot; Creating jobs at a local level is hard work , and most states have shown very little interest in it , &quot; said Demetra Nightengale , a welfare expert at the Urban Institute , a Washington-based , nonpartisan research_center . Administration officials agree that many aspects of the Clinton-style welfare reform are untried , but insist that the plan is flexible enough to be adapted if problems arise . Theda Skocpol , a Harvard_University sociology professor , argues that the sloganeering the Administration uses will have an undesired impact of its own . &quot; The heightened rhetoric creates greater resentment when these people do not disappear , &quot; she said . &quot; Welfare reform is its own biggest enemy . First there was the War on Poverty , now it ' s end welfare as we know it . The public comes_to expect results and does not get them and then resents any attempts as wasted money . The rhetoric has far outrun what they are going_to be able to deliver. &quot; The history of welfare reform is_full of examples of good intentions gone awry . When Congress last considered welfare reform , it was inspired by a growing public sentiment that welfare recipients should work . But because both funding and follow-through were inadequate , the 1988 Family Support Act put few people into the work_force , even though tens of thousands more welfare recipients entered education and training_programs . &quot; The jobs program turned_out to be more of an education program than Congress intended , &quot; Nightengale said . In 1981 , the Ronald Reagan_Administration changed AFDC rules , lowering the level of assets welfare recipients could possess and still qualify for AFDC . The percentage of AFDC families who worked dropped from 14 % to 15 % before 1981 to 4 % to 5 % afterward . &quot; The goal at the time was to target assets to the truly needy , &quot; Greenberg said . &quot; They increased the penalties on work , savings and marriage , and the effect of that has been to decrease the percentage of people on AFDC working_at any time. &quot; Conservatives and liberals alike agree that one of the clearest unintended consequences of welfare policy was to encourage women to become dependent_on the benefits and to stay that way . The current caseload has hit a record 14.3 million , with more_than 30 % of recipients remaining on the rolls for eight years . One in seven children benefits from AFDC . A key reason for that dependency , according to the President and many welfare experts , is that the program , especially its medical benefits , is so attractive that many recipients feel that they will lose by taking low-paying jobs that often do not include medical benefits . Clinton highlighted this dilemma in his Kansas City speech : &quot; Today you have this bizarre situation where people on welfare , if they take a job in a place which doesn ' t offer health_insurance , are asked to give_up their children ' s health_care and go_to work , earning money , paying taxes , to pay_for the health_care of the children of people who didn ' t make the decision to go_to work and stayed_on welfare . . . . That does not make sense. &quot; Even worse than encouraging dependency , some conservative welfare specialists argue , AFDC has encouraged out-of-wedlock births by enabling young_women with_children to set_up housekeeping . They note that the proportion of never-married women on AFDC has grown from 21 % in 1976 to 52 % in 1992 . Now , 30 % of all babies are born to unwed mothers . The system also makes_it difficult for two-parent families to qualify for aid . At the same time , it has taken poor women out of the mainstream . &quot; It almost forced poor women to stay out of the work_force while their middle-class and upper-middle-class sisters were entering the work_force , &quot; said Barbara Blum , president of the Foundation for Child Development , a former welfare administrator for New York State and past president of the American Public Welfare Assn . &quot; We were paying women to be at_home with their children . It did not reflect what was going_on around them. &quot;</TEXT>
