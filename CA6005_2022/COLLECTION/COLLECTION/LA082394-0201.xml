   <HEADLINE> RULING PARTY ' S ZEDILLO CLAIMS VICTORY IN MEXICAN ELECTION ; POLITICS : PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE GETTING LESS THAN 50 % OF VOTE IN NARROWEST MARGIN EVER FOR THE PRI . IRREGULARITIES ARE REPORTED , BUT OBSERVERS DETECT NO WIDESPREAD FRAUD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Economist Ernesto Zedillo claimed victory Monday , apparently retaining the ruling party ' s six-decade hold_on the Mexican presidency but without the absolute_majority that his predecessors have enjoyed . His triumph -- with almost 48 % of the vote_in partial returns -- was the narrowest ever recorded by a modern candidate of his Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) . But with 35.59 % of the precincts reporting , Zedillo still held a big margin over his major rivals : Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the National Action Party ( PAN ) , who had 30 % of the vote ; and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Democratic Revolutionary Party ( PRD ) , with 16 % . The PRI also captured a significant lead in Senate elections nationwide and in the two governorships at stake Sunday . The ruling party ' s apparent win came as Mexico recorded a 70 % voter_turnout , the highest in this nation ' s history . A high turnout had been expected to favor opposition parties . In retrospect , analysts said , the turbulence of the past year -- which began with an Indian uprising in the south and other violence , including the assassination of Zedillo ' s predecessor , Luis Donaldo Colosio -- persuaded voters not to risk a change . Zedillo -- at 42 , one of the youngest and least experienced politicians to lead Mexico in this century -- campaigned heavily on the issue of security . PRI bumper stickers , for example , proclaimed , &quot; I vote for peace. &quot; Several Mexican observer groups and international teams indicated that they had detected no widespread fraud in Sunday ' s voting , although all reported irregularities in spots across the country . Still , the elections that President Carlos Salinas de Gortari had pledged would be the cleanest in Mexican history generated sporadic protests Monday , particularly by Cardenas supporters , who asserted that there had been massive cheating . &quot; This is a victory for the PRI of tomorrow , &quot; Zedillo said in a speech early Monday , when the first returns showed him with a comfortable lead . &quot; For the PRI we are building with firm conviction and determination. &quot; Zedillo ' s seeming victory was widely seen as a guarantee that the free-market economic reforms of the past decade will continue for the next six years of his administration . On Monday , Zedillo promised to work for &quot; economic_growth , social advances , the abatement of poverty. &quot; He pledged that his government will spend more on social programs , admitting that the restructuring that has drawn billions of dollars in foreign investment to Mexico has yet to touch many of the country ' s poor . As budget minister , Zedillo -- who earned a doctorate in economics at Yale but had never held elected office -- was an integral part of the economic team that sold_off state-owned companies , slashed government subsidies and negotiated the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , solidifying this nation ' s commitment to open international markets . On Monday , Mexican investors and the business_community reacted strongly to his declaration of victory , sending stocks soaring 51 points and driving the peso to its strongest position against the dollar in three months . Economists , brokers and investors were in broad agreement Monday that the orderly elections , whose results also seemed to please stock_markets throughout Latin_America , will hasten bricks-and-mortar investment in Mexico ; there were indications that dollars have already been sprung loose . Cardenas , who is widely believed to have been cheated of the presidency in 1988 , cried fraud again Monday to a gathering of supporters in the capital ' s main square . But the group of 20 # 000 who cheered him in the historic Zocalo was far smaller than the massive crowds that rallied behind Cardenas six years ago . &quot; An uncommon fraud has been committed , &quot; Cardenas said with his usual deadpan delivery , urging his supporters to attend another demonstration Saturday after the final , official returns have been announced . &quot; We still do not know the results , &quot; he said . &quot; I will leave the judgment of the outcome to the Mexican people , not to the Congress or the ( Federal ) Electoral Tribunal. &quot; Meantime , a potentially explosive showdown was brewing in the southern state of Chiapas , where Cardenas ' party refused to recognize the official results giving victory to the PRI gubernatorial candidate . Instead , the opposition announced a campaign of civil_disobedience and declared the governor-elect to be Amado Avendano , a newspaper_editor who narrowly escaped death in a suspicious traffic accident during the campaign . Chiapas was the site of a guerrilla uprising last January by Indians and peasants calling themselves the Zapatista National Liberation Army . The rebels had vowed to resume their struggle if the ruling party tried to win the elections fraudulently . Members of the Democratic Convention -- a grouping of about 30 Indian , peasant and social_organizations -- said that , based on their monitoring of Sunday ' s vote , Avendano had won . They said a sample of 15 % of the vote gave Avendano an advantage of 1 percentage_point over Eduardo Robledo of the PRI , with areas of Avendano ' s strongest support yet to be included . Official results , however , gave Robledo 49 % of the vote to about 31 % for Avendano , with just over half the ballots counted . It was not immediately clear whether the proclamation of Avendano as governor-elect was merely the opposition ' s attempt to strengthen its bargaining position with the government . But it was clear that many Chiapans were angry at the way Sunday ' s elections were carried_out . That was true especially among Avendano supporters , who complained of numerous irregularities that they said prevented thousands from voting , including a shortage of ballots , omissions of names from voter-registration lists and fraudulent tallies . But nationwide , Sunday ' s election seemed to lack the blatant , widespread cheating that has become a part of Mexican electoral folklore : stolen and stuffed ballot_boxes , burned ballots and polling_places that never open but still report returns when the polls close . The most widespread irregularity reported by observers was polling_places that opened late . The most heated protests occurred when special polling_places set_up for voters in transit ran_out of ballots . And the most serious threat remaining , according to independent analysts , is the possibility of violent confrontations between police and opposition protesters . Further complicating Sunday ' s scenario was the reality that many voters , especially from Indian communities , cast ballots for the first time and were bewildered by the process . Illiteracy is high in many places in Mexico , and many voters relied_on relatives -- in the more benign cases -- or employers and political_bosses to tell them how to mark the ballot . &quot; There might be some unfortunate violence , but I think they ' ll weather it , &quot; said one diplomat serving as an election observer . &quot; Credibility hinges_on one question : Did the PRI from the top down engineer massive , organized fraud ? And I think the answer to that is no. &quot; Doubts about this election focused_on broader questions of fairness , as broached in a somber , early morning speech by Fernandez , the PAN candidate who was running second in early returns . &quot; This was a profoundly inequitable and deeply unfair process , &quot; he said . &quot; Once again , the National Action Party has confronted the machinery of the state . Once again we have seen with pain and shame the waste of huge resources on the campaign of the ruling party candidate. &quot; Fernandez then recited the sort of complaints that opposition candidates have lodged throughout the campaign , speaking_of : * Crowds drawn to rallies with the promise of T-shirts and lunch or the threat of losing their union membership . * Massive expenditures , in the weeks before the election , from government programs to subsidize farmers and alleviate poverty . * Unbalanced media coverage , particularly from television and radio_stations dependent_on government licenses to use the airwaves . Broadcasters did not announce Cardenas ' plans for the rally in the Zocalo here ; cable companies that carry U.S. networks blacked_out American television coverage of the election , broadly interpreting a Federal Electoral Institute request . Elsewhere , opposition reaction to the election reflected Fernandez ' s charges of unfairness , which were confirmed by several observer groups and international visitors . Two U.S. groups expressed concern about &quot; the pre-election environment &quot; that favored the ruling party . Still , their overall assessment was positive , stressing that they were struck by &quot; the peaceful and orderly conduct of the polls. &quot; Some diplomats and analysts said Cardenas supporters may be ignoring an unpleasant reality in insisting that they lost simply because of electoral foul_play . These observers said the elections may be offering a different , clear signal -- a defeat for the political left . &quot; Whether you like it or not , &quot; one diplomat said , &quot; the left is being taught a lesson here. &quot; As for Zedillo , he made a conscious effort Monday to downplay his apparent victory . He made no public appearances after his early speech ; senior advisers said that to avoid inflaming the opposition further , Zedillo deliberately spent most of the day closeted in the PRI ' s downtown headquarters , thanking party rank_and_file . Until late last year , Zedillo was a little-known , seemingly dull Cabinet member , an able economist who helped draft Salinas ' economic strategy and served for a time as education minister , where he was noted for bungling the introduction of new textbooks . The son of a Mexicali electrician who once worked as a shoeshine boy , Zedillo has an image that is more that of Yale_University , which he attended on scholarships , than of the dusty streets of Baja California . Earlier this year , Zedillo was named coordinator for the presidential campaign of Luis Donaldo Colosio , apparently to help give him political seasoning . Instead , that post pushed him into the presidency . The March 23 assassination of Colosio left the PRI in shock and with limited prospects for a presidential contender , as Mexican law barred any serving Cabinet member or governor from replacing him as candidate . Salinas , however , employed his unique privilege as Mexico ' s president , tapping Zedillo from a limited field to be the PRI presidential candidate . He began his campaign in Colosio ' s shadow . But he gradually emerged as his own man , drawing larger and larger crowds . His infamous wooden speeches and gestures grew animated . He sometimes abandoned his suits for shirt sleeves and even appeared to enjoy mingling with crowds . As for Fernandez on Monday , he also removed himself from the public_eye after his midnight television address . His senior aides said PAN Chairman Carlos Castillo planned to spend Monday night with party statisticians and analysts , examining official results in detail to determine whether they jibed with their random poll samplings . The party offered no comment on returns indicating that the PAN was trailing the ruling party in the three states where it has governorships .
