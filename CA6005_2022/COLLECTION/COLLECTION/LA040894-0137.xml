   <TEXT> Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa , beleaguered by a controversy over his personal finances , announced today that he intends to resign . Hosokawa , who took_over last August after 38 years of unbroken rule by the Liberal Democratic Party , said he will step_down because of an impasse in Parliament over charges that he received an illicit $ 952 # 000 payment from a gangster-tainted parcel-delivery firm . Hosokawa called the transactions &quot; something for which I must take moral responsibility. &quot; &quot; I apologize and ask_for your understanding , &quot; he said . Hosokawa would be the fourth of Japan ' s last five prime_ministers to step_down because of scandal . Hosokawa , 56 , insisted that he received the money in 1982 as a loan and that he had repaid the money in full by 1991 . Liberal Democrats , however , began a boycott of parliamentary proceedings to demand that Hosokawa allow his former secretary to testify in Parliament to clarify details . The prime_minister had been trying to win approval of an already overdue budget_for the fiscal_year that started a week ago , but the scandal had paralyzed parliamentary business . In a nationally televised news_conference , Hosokawa revealed that he had just discovered an incident that occurred more_than 10 years ago in which staff_members in his office had entrusted Hosokawa ' s own personal funds for &quot; investment &quot; to a friend . The prime_minister said he could not reveal the details now but admitted that the incident involves &quot; legal problems. &quot; &quot; As a politician , I must straighten my collar , &quot; Hosokawa said . He also admitted for the first time that he had not paid interest on the controversial loan . Instead , funds represented by the interest payments were reported , legally , as political contributions , he said . Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told reporters that &quot; with the Parliament this stagnated and no outlook in_sight for movement , Hosokawa said he felt he had to assume responsibility. &quot; Yuichi Ichikawa , chairman of the the Buddhist-backed Komei ( Clean Government ) Party , said the prime_minister told the leaders he had no problems to face on the loan from the Sagawa Kyubin Co . But he quoted Hosokawa as admitting that he had discovered &quot; some legal problems &quot; with &quot; the management of my political funds. &quot; Murayama and Ichikawa were interviewed as they emerged from &quot; consultations &quot; that Hosokawa called with coalition party leaders . When Murayama said the prime_minister told the leaders that he intended to resign , reporters exclaimed : &quot; The prime_minister resign ? ! &quot; Shortly after the meeting with his coalition partners , Hosokawa convened a meeting of his Cabinet_ministers to inform them of his decision . Masayoshi Takemura , chief Cabinet secretary , said no date has been set for a resignation by the Cabinet as_a_whole . A Cabinet resignation , required any time a prime_minister quits , could precipitate a general_election . However , reports that Hosokawa is accepting personal responsibility did not point toward an election . The approval of the lower house of Parliament is needed to elect a new prime_minister . The announcement , although it came_after a series of mishaps and failures by Hosokawa , left politicians so astonished that no one was yet making predictions of what will happen . At the least , Hosokawa ' s resignation was expected to seriously impair the government in its efforts to work_out a market-opening package of measures to lift government regulations on business by June and further spur a faltering economy that achieved only 0.1 % growth last year . Hosokawa had promised the action before a Naples , Italy , summit of the Group of Seven advanced industrialized democracies , at which he was to have met President Clinton . Hosokawa and Clinton met in February but failed to agree on measures to cut Japan ' s growing trade surpluses . The episode brought U.S.-Japan economic relations_to a new level of tension . In the first five minutes after Hosokawa ' s resignation became known , the Tokyo Stock_Exchange fell 150 points . The yen also dipped on the foreign_exchange market . In 1989 , when then-Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita suddenly resigned in the midst of the Recruit Co . stocks-for-favors scandal , the process of selecting a new prime_minister consumed more_than a month , even though it only involved selecting another Liberal Democrat as the leader . This time , with a coalition backed by eight parties in the upper house and seven in the lower chamber of Parliament , the process promises to be more complicated . One possibility is Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata , leader of the Japan Renewal Party , the second-largest in the coalition . Late last July , Hosokawa patched together his coalition under a banner of political reform and opposition to the perennial rule of the Liberal Democrats and a chain of scandals under their governments . Although left-wing Socialists sabotaged the coalition ' s political reform bills in the upper house in January , Hosokawa hammered_out a compromise with Yohei Kono , who took_over the leadership of the Liberal Democrats after former Prime_Minister Kiichi Miyazawa resigned . Bills to put into force the reforms and a new electoral_system were passed last month . This year , Hosokawa has stumbled on one issue after another . In February , he announced a plan to raise a 3 % consumption tax to 7 % three years after cutting income_taxes by 20 % -- without informing his coalition partners . A day later , after the Socialists threatened to withdraw from the coalition , he rescinded the plan . Unprepared because of preoccupation with the political reforms , Hosokawa said no to Clinton ' s demands for market opening -- a move that initially brought him praise . But his failure to come_up with substantial counterproposals later subjected him to criticism . The prime_minister ' s troubles reached_a_peak , however , when his repeated attempts to explain the money he received from Sagawa Kyubin fell on increasingly skeptical listeners . His opinion poll ratings fell as low as 47 % , compared to more_than 70 % last summer . And the mass media , which had backed him solidly , began writing ever more critical editorials , urging him to clear_up the facts of the loan . In the last few days , newspapers began running summaries of Hosokawa ' s administration -- as if they were writing political obituaries .</TEXT>
