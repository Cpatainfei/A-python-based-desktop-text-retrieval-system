   <HEADLINE> RICHARD NIXON : 1913-1994 ; REFLECTIONS ON NIXON ' S LEGACY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Leaders in statecraft and students of international affairs will long look_for guidance to President Nixon ' s tremendous accomplishments . He suffered defeats that would have ended most political careers , yet he won stunning victories that many of the world ' s most popular leaders failed to attain. &quot; -- President Bill_Clinton &quot; To Nancy and I , he was a cherished friend and brilliant counselor . Richard Nixon understood the world . He understood politics , power and the fragile yet undeniable force of history . There is no question that the legacy of this complicated and fascinating man will continue to guide the forces of democracy forever. &quot; -- Former President Ronald Reagan &quot; As President , his foreign_policy accomplishments laid important groundwork for efforts of the presidents who have succeeded him . . . . President Nixon continued to share his insight through his writings and travels throughout the 20 years since he left_office , and each of his successors has benefited from his counsel. &quot; -- Former President Jimmy_Carter &quot; History will give Richard Nixon enormous credit for his accomplishments. &quot; -- Former President George_Bush &quot; The Watergate tragedy ought to be closed at the present_time and I hope it will be . It was one of the most unfortunate incidents in the history of the American political scene . The book ' s closed . Let ' s look_forward to the future. &quot; -- Former President Gerald Ford &quot; His work to clean_up the environment , change our nation ' s welfare system , improve law_enforcement , and reform health_care serves as an inspiration to us today as we seek to place the ' American_dream ' within the grasp of all our citizens. &quot; -- President Bill_Clinton &quot; If there ' s a fair opportunity to evaluate , he ' ll be seen as a terribly flawed leader , to be pitied because of his loneliness and his insecurity and his bellicosity and his vindictiveness. &quot; -- Ramsay Clark , attorney_general under President Lyndon B . Johnson &quot; Richard Nixon , with his great strategic mind and intelligence , was always in the arena , even when he was out of office . And he always rose above his defeats . He devoted his energy and mind to issues that were central . He took positions , he was not afraid of controversy . He is known for his brilliance in foreign_policy , but history will recognize his immense contribution to domestic policy , most especially in the area of civil rights. &quot; -- George P . Shultz , labor and treasury_secretary during the Nixon administration and secretary_of_state in the Reagan_administration &quot; Long after Watergate is forgotten , his opening to China , his creation of an Environmental Protection Agency , his commitment to a strong America and to containing the Soviet empire will be remembered. &quot; -- Rep . Newt Gingrich ( R-Ga. ) &quot; What history will remember is that Nixon was the only President who could go_to China without being redbaited by Richard Nixon . People have been talking_about how hard it was for him to govern when he was elected in 1968 , because the country was so divided . But history will note it was divided largely because Nixon himself deliberately divided it. &quot; -- David Halberstam , Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and author who has written extensively about the Nixon era &quot; There are really two Richard Nixons . There is the paranoid politician , a man who picked_at every sore he could find on the body_politic , and there in the same body was this overarching geopolitical thinker . You ' ve got_to find a way to weigh them together. &quot; -- Richard Lamm , former governor of Colorado and currently director of the Public Policy Institute at the University of Denver &quot; It is very difficult to think_of our party and our country ' s politics without him . There will be a hollowness , a vacuum , a void created by his absence that I don ' t know , really , who will be able to fix or replace. &quot; -- Tom Fuentes , chairman of the Republican_Party in Orange County &quot; At some point we ' ll have generations of people who are not bearing the baggage of scandal , or Watergate , or whether he was guilty of this , or guilty of that . we ' ll see him in a broader perspective . Eventually , I think he will have been seen to have this vision , the ability to project Americans ' interest into a different time frame. &quot; -- Ken Khachigian , a San Clemente political consultant &quot; I think history will treat him very kindly as they realize how very , very right he usually was . All of the Presidents that have come_after him have recognized this and would seek his counsel. &quot; -- Lois Anne Lundberg , chair of Orange County GOP 1977-84 &quot; Nixon ' s life and the media are intertwined . He was made by the press and destroyed by the press. &quot; -- Cal State Fullerton professor Tony Fellow , who says Nixon ' s presidency helped shape the history of American media &quot; He left a great legacy in civil_rights . But he hasn ' t gotten credit for it because he was conservative . He created affirmative_action programs . In the Great Society , ( President Lyndon B. ) Johnson came_up with social programs that would train blacks , but then after the money ran_out , their jobs ran_out , too . Under Nixon , affirmative_action was created and that gave blacks a real opportunity to become employed in jobs with a future. &quot; -- J . Owens Smith , professor of political_science at Cal State Fullerton &quot; I ' m amazed after he served as Vice_President he came_home and tried_for the governorship , and he didn ' t succeed , people said that ' s the end for Richard Nixon . But he came_back -- and looking down the road from now , Orange County will say with pride that one of_our_own went all_the way to the presidency and back , and his library will be a testament to that. &quot; -- Jim Miller , professor of history , English and comparative_literature at Chapman University and member of committee to establish the Nixon Library in San Clemente in the 1970s &quot; The American people will recognize President Nixon was a man who was seeking peace for all. &quot; -- Walter Annenberg , philanthropist and former ambassador to the United Kingdom &quot; Though he did some great things in foreign_policy , he was still scary in that he devoured government and was almost a despot. &quot; -Sid Davidoff , an aide to former Mayor John Lindsay of New York , a liberal Republican &quot; This is the end of an era . The man who made several decisions about Vietnam and Vietnamese life has disappeared . Now there are no more American politicians who were involved deeply in Vietnam left. &quot; -- Yen Do , editor of Nguoi Viet Daily News</TEXT>
