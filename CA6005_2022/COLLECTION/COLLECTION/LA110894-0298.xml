   <HEADLINE> EX-COMMUNIST DECLARED VICTOR IN DISPUTED TAJIK RACE ; CENTRAL ASIA : OPPONENT SAYS RESULTS FALSIFIED . VOTE DOES NOTHING TO ADVANCE TALKS WITH EXILED GUERRILLAS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Emamali Rakhmonov , who came_to power by force two years ago in one of the former Soviet_Union ' s bloodiest civil_wars , was declared the winner Monday of a controversial presidential election in this Central Asian republic . An electoral commission picked by Rakhmonov ' s government gave the 42-year-old former Communist 60 % of the vote_in Sunday ' s two-man race . His former prime_minister , Abdulmalik Abdulajanov , was given 35 % and charged that the result had been falsified . The contest between two former allies on the winning side of the war did nothing to advance peace negotiations between the government and a still-outlawed coalition of exiled Islamists and democrats , whose guerrillas have kept_up sporadic , crippling attacks from bases in Afghanistan . It came a day after the guerrillas failed to show_up at a border town with 27 captured government soldiers for a scheduled prisoner exchange , prompting the government to take an equal number of opposition activists back to jail in Dushanbe . But Rakhmonov and the exiled coalition , which opposed holding the elections , called_for continuing the peace talks and a temporary cease-fire that has been in_force since Oct . 20 . &quot; There is no alternative , &quot; Rakhmonov said after casting his ballot . The fighting , which erupted after the Soviet_Union collapsed in 1991 , is a power struggle among ethnic Tajiks divided into regional factions by mountainous geography . At its peak the fighting turned a tenth of the country ' s 5.2 million people into refugees ; it has killed more_than 20 # 000 . In late 1992 , Communist warriors of Rakhmonov ' s southern rural Kulyabi faction , backed by the Russian army , drove the Islamic-democratic coalition from power , along with its fighters from the Garm and Pamir mountain regions . At first the well-armed Kulyabis shared the government with Abdulajanov and figures from his northern , industrial Khodjent region , then muscled them aside . Some officials in Russia , whose 25 # 000 troops defend the Tajik-Afghan border from rebel attacks , appeared to favor Abdulajanov . The wealthy 45-year-old businessman , who is ambassador to Moscow , was viewed_as more of a peacemaker than Rakhmonov , whose regime stands accused by international human_rights groups of murdering opposition leaders and journalists . But in the final month of the campaign , the Russian government delivered 15 billion rubles , or about $ 5 million , to help Rakhmonov ' s bankrupt government pay long-delayed wages , undermining his opponent ' s strongest campaign issue . Four bombs exploded at government buildings here Friday in an apparent attempt to intimidate voters , but election officials reported a 95 % turnout . People ate free servings of plov , a traditional rice dish , at the polls . Voters gave 90 % approval to a new constitution creating the presidency , with power to appoint and dismiss government_ministers and judges . Rakhmonov had been chairman of Parliament , the most powerful post under the old constitution . Official observers from Russia , four other former Soviet republics and Turkey told reporters Monday , after visiting 120 of the 2 # 469 polling_stations , that they had detected no irregularities in the voting . But journalists and Western diplomats here noted that Rakhmonov ' s campaign had dominated state television and was openly supported by the armed security_forces , who tacked up his campaign posters and often spoke in his favor . One diplomat said that armed men visited a camp for returning war refugees and threatened to kill anyone who voted against Rakhmonov . &quot; All government machinery was mobilized in favor of one candidate , &quot; said Friederike Adlung , who represents the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe here . That group and the United Nations declined to send observers because of the ban on most opposition parties . Rakhmonov , who campaigned as the man who brought peace , said the election outcome had turned &quot; a new page for Tajikistan &quot; by showing it to be &quot; really democratic. &quot; &quot; People in Tajikistan still have a totalitarian psychology , &quot; countered Otakhon Latifi , a spokesman for the exiled opposition . &quot; They vote for whomever they are told to vote. &quot; * Abdulajanov asserted that some ballots were distributed without his name on them and that his partisans were beaten_up at one polling_station . He accused the government of falsifying returns from districts where his supporters , bowing to threats , did not show_up as observers . &quot; Rakhmonov simply took_advantage of the fact that we have no armed units at our beck and call and decided to win by force , &quot; said Babajan Ikramov , a spokesman for the runner-up .</TEXT>
