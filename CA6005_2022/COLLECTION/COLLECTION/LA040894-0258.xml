   <HEADLINE> NEW RESEARCH TO SPARE SIMI LAB FROM CLOSURE ; SCIENCE : THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY , WHICH HAD PLANNED TO SHUT DOWN THE SITE , WILL STUDY A NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR ELECTRICAL GENERATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Department_of_Energy announced Thursday that it will keep_open its Energy Technology Engineering Center near Simi Valley to do research on a promising new technology for electrical_power generation , known as the Kalina Cycle . The center had been scheduled for closure in September , with a loss of 200 high-tech jobs . It is operated by the Rocketdyne division of Rockwell International , which for decades tested components for nuclear_power plants at the site . &quot; The issue in my mind was that we cannot lose this resource , &quot; Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary said Thursday at a news_conference in Los Angeles . The center , part of the Department_of_Energy ' s Santa Susana Field Laboratory , is now assured funding through 1995 and will get a budget hike of $ 11.6 million , most of it to test the new technology , a prototype of which is already in place . Community groups and proponents of an advanced transportation industry in Southern California have been lobbying hard to keep the site open . In December , DOE successfully sought_out industrial partners to help support the center ' s continued operation . &quot; The future of ETEC really gives us something positive to look_forward to , &quot; said Bonny Matheson , president of Valley Industry and Commerce Assn. , which represents more_than 350 businesses in Ventura and Los Angeles counties . Matheson also spoke at Thursday ' s news_conference . The energy technology center ' s mission to develop cleaner and more efficient energy systems could also help create more jobs and give local businesses a much-needed boost , said Matheson , who met with O ' Leary in February to talk_about saving the $ 1-billion lab . &quot; Businesses have been so battered after years of tragedy and disaster that this is just a wonderful ray_of_light , &quot; Matheson said . Rep . Anthony Beilenson ( D-Woodland Hills ) helped arrange the meeting between O ' Leary and business_leaders . &quot; We hope we can look_back in a_couple_of years and see that this not only saved jobs but created other jobs , &quot; Beilenson said . O ' Leary said Thursday that future funding will depend_on how successful the center is in attracting private businesses interested in working with the facility . Southern California Gas Co . has already expressed interest in working with the center to develop new uses for natural_gas , and Caltrans is also interested in_using the lab . &quot; We still think that a focus_on transportation technologies is a premiere use of the site , and we will be working to get DOE ' s additional support , &quot; said John Slifko , special assistant for technology policy to Rep . Howard L . Berman ( D-Panorama City ) . But so far , plans focus_on development of the new electricity-generation process , Robert LeChevalier , DOE site manager , said Thursday . &quot; This is a really significant event , &quot; LeChevalier said . &quot; It ' s the first new thermodynamic cycle that ' s been invented since 1895. &quot; The new concept was devised by Alexander Kalina , an engineer from the former Soviet_Union now living_in Northern California . Potentially , it could use almost any heat source -- fueled by natural_gas , coal or geothermal or solar_energy -- to produce electricity 20 % more efficiently than current turbine technology . An improvement of this magnitude could mean billions of dollars in energy savings in this country and internationally . The technology center has the world ' s sole operating model of the device . &quot; We ' ve demonstrated the principles of the cycle , &quot; LeChevalier said , &quot; and a number of large utility suppliers are very interested . . . one is General Electric. &quot; The center also has ongoing projects in renewable technologies , energy conservation and earthquake-effects testing . Researchers there can test the effects of seismic events on components used to isolate buildings and bridges from earthquake impacts , or such utility structures as pipe systems in power_plants .</TEXT>
