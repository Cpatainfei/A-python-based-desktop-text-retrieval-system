   <HEADLINE> ON CALIFORNIA : A ROLL CALL OF SECOND OPINIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So these two out-to-pasture immigration officials and an Orange County businessman with a grudge got_together and agreed it would be swell to run all undocumented people out of California . They drafted a ballot proposition that would require schools and hospitals to report any suspected &quot; illegal. &quot; Kindergartners . Pregnant mothers . No matter . No papers , boom , out the door . Everyone loved the idea , at first . Not only was it perfectly mean , and thus in keeping with the times . It also gave Californians someone else to blame for their statewide slump . The governor was the most enthusiastic supporter . He seemed convinced that this Proposition 187 could reelect him . He would pretend that California was Alabama , circa 1960 , that his name was Wallace , not Wilson -- and ride anger to victory . As Election_Day drew_closer , though , opponents began to emerge , as if from caves . They ranged from the President of the United States to police_officers , from preachers to farmers to schoolteachers to doctors to Chamber_of_Commerce directors to editorial writers -- a wide and deep coalition of the sort of people traditionally trusted by Californians to provide political guidance . These opinion leaders disagreed on why they disliked Proposition 187 . Some thought it bad politics , others bad policy . Some worried about the loss of billions of tax dollars , others warned of disease or unpicked crops . What they agreed on was this : If illegal immigration was a disease , Proposition 187 was the wrong medicine . Listen to just a_few of them : * &quot; I don ' t think as a matter of practice , &quot; said President Clinton , &quot; it ' s a good thing to condition an election referendum , much less other elections in California , on a measure that even the supporters say is unconstitutional. &quot; * &quot; I won ' t be mincing words on this one , &quot; said the Rev . Richard C . Kennedy , an Orange County priest &quot; . . . Proposition 187 is immoral . This thing is completely godless. &quot; * &quot; Profoundly anti-conservative , &quot; wrote Jack Kemp and William Bennett , two of the tallest trees in the GOP forest . &quot; It relies_on a Big Brother approach and imposes expensive regulatory burdens . It is also a mandate for ethnic discrimination . Does anyone seriously doubt that Latino children named Rodriguez would be more likely to appear to be illegal than Anglo children named , say , Jones. &quot; * &quot; The Proposition 187 tax_bill , &quot; said Mel Katz , a director of the Greater San Diego Chamber_of_Commerce , &quot; is like an arrow aimed right at the heart of California ' s business climate. &quot; * &quot; An ill-conceived and punitive measure , &quot; said Dr. Matt Harris , president of the California Academy of Family Physicians , &quot; that could significantly add_to , not reduce , the cost of caring for undocumented persons by denying needed preventive and primary care services. &quot; * &quot; This nativist abomination , &quot; thundered William Safire of the New York Times , arguably the nation ' s most influential conservative columnist , &quot; would deny education to children of illegals and turn teachers into government informers , and for what -- to put hard-working immigrants in costly jails. &quot; * &quot; The proponents claim they drafted Proposition 187 to test education requirements before the Supreme Court , &quot; stated Pete Mehas , a Fresno County educator . &quot; I say we don ' t deserve to be part of some grand legal experiment. &quot; * &quot; This initiative , &quot; said Max Turchen of the Congress of California Seniors , &quot; requires Americans to report to the authorities people they ' suspect ' of being illegal aliens . But what are the criteria ? The color of your skin ? The way you talk ? Your last_name ? &quot; &quot; We ' re going to be in_trouble , &quot; said Ray Lopez , a Fowler raisin packer . &quot; If you removed every illegal from this state tomorrow , you ' d see the businesses -- and not just the agricultural businesses -- start to crumble. &quot; * &quot; A bandage approach to a major problem , &quot; said Ernie Gustafson , who for decades ran INS_operations in Southern California , &quot; dreamed_up by politicians and wanna-bes . . . . It will solve nothing . It will take the innocence of children and make them the scapegoats of a failed policy. &quot; * &quot; Imagine , &quot; argued a Wall_Street Journal editorial , &quot; telling hundreds of thousands of teachers , nurses and bureaucrats that they now must report nationality suspects . Maybe California could hire former East_German and Soviet neighborhood spies to demonstrate how to perfect such a hearsay reporting system. &quot; * &quot; A fraud , &quot; said L.A. County Sheriff Sherman Block , &quot; and a hoax. &quot; And so on . This week the testimonials at last seem to have broken_through the anti-immigrant hysteria . Polls are finding Proposition 187 ' s support in sharp decline -- along with its aura of inevitability . The measure drafters , meanwhile , have been busy explaining away reported links to a white_supremacy organization . And what of Gov . Wilson , who once perched himself so eagerly on the Proposition 187 limb as king of the immigrant-bashers ? Well , perhaps he ' s heard the sound of sawing . A new TV ad of his opens with warm , fuzzy shots of the Statue_of_Liberty .</TEXT>
