   <HEADLINE> DON ' T SKIMP ON MILK LABELING ; JUST TELL CONSUMERS WHETHER IT ' S FROM COWS THAT WERE FED BIOTECH HORMONES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dairy_cows , with the blessing of the Food and Drug Administration , are becoming &quot; supercows. &quot; Farmers may inject them with a genetically engineered version of a natural growth_hormone that prompts a milk production increase of up_to 20 % . The FDA says the milk is indistinguishable from that of untreated cows and thus no safety issue exists . Large dairy_farmers find the product , developed by Monsanto Corp. , a boon that will reduce milk prices to consumers worldwide . The U.S. biotech industry sees an enormous new market . And fatherly former U.S. Surgeon_General C . Everett Koop assures us it ' s perfectly safe . But not everyone is happy . One acknowledged side_effect of the product , known as recombinant bovine somatotropin , is an increase in udder infections , requiring more use of antibiotics , which , even if no traces are left in the milk , can contribute to overall bacterial drug resistance . In addition , some scientists are unwilling to accept the FDA ' s interpretation of test data on the absolute safety of the biotech hormone . So consumers should just make their own decisions as_to what kind of milk to drink , right ? Well , that ' s not easy . Currently , labeling is scarce ; indeed , milk companies that tried simple labels saying that their milk and cheese come from untreated cows find themselves being sued by the growth_hormone ' s manufacturer . And the FDA ' s proposed &quot; guidelines &quot; on labeling are anything but helpful . The agency invites each state to make its own label laws . And the label itself , says the FDA , can ' t be just , &quot; This milk comes from cows not treated with genetically engineered hormones. &quot; It has to include disclaimers saying there ' s no detectable difference from untreated milk , that the producer is not implying anything about quality or safety , and on and on . This is ridiculous . While the FDA is still pondering the final guidelines , here ' s our advice : Require a label that ' s brief and clear to those of us who may lack a Ph.D. in biology . A competently done federal model for the label would give legal cover to the firms that use it and probably would be accepted by the states . And that would reassure milk drinkers .</TEXT>
