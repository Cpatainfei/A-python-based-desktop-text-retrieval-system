   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : MAKING A DIFFERENCE ; ONE ORGANIZATION ' S APPROACH : ADVOCATE FOR COURT DEPENDENT CHILDREN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The number of abused , abandoned or neglected children under court jurisdiction in Los Angeles County has grown from 16 # 000 to 42 # 000 over the past 15 years . Each month , about 1 # 000 children who have committed no crime are added_to the county ' s Dependency Court system where they rely_on services from overburdened social_workers , lawyers and other court professionals . Modeled after similar programs nationwide , the Los Angeles Child Advocates Office was established in 1978 to recruit , screen , train and supervise community volunteers to assist the court on behalf of these children . Volunteers become Court Appointed Special Advocates charged with helping children while Dependency Court officials work to find them safe , stable and permanent homes -- a process that can take as long as two years and a half_a_dozen court appearances . Today , volunteers at more_than 400 CASA programs in 47 states accompany children to court , prepare reports used to determine where they should live and give children the type of consistent one-on-one contact and support that court officials seldom can . THE NEED FOR VOLUNTEER ADVOCATES Los Angeles County Child advocate volunteers : 227 Child court dependents : 43 # 000 Orange County Child advocate volunteers : 230 Child court dependents : 3 # 900 San Bernadino County Child advocate volunteers : 62 Child court dependents : 4 # 000 San Diego County Child advocate volunteers : 111 Child court dependents : 6 # 300 Ventura County Child advocate volunteers : 75 Child court dependents : 1 # 000 Source : CASA offices of Los Angeles , Orange , San Bernadino , San Diego and Ventura counties ONE VOLUNTEER ADVOCATE ' S EXPERIENCE Carolina Oaxaca Lives in Rancho Palos Verdes . A CASA volunteer since 1982 , she was selected by the National CASA Assn . as 1992 Child Advocate of the Year . I learned about CASA through a friend of mine . She said , ' I ' m working for this great organization , and we really need bilingual volunteers. ' I thought , ' Why not ? ' She sent me an application_form , I went_into training and here I am 12 years later . We learn how to make independent investigations for the judge who eventually makes the final_decision about what is to happen to these children . You have to sift through a lot of information about a child ' s life and make_sense out of it . As a volunteer , I can make a recommendation to the court with back-up data to support my position -- dates , conversations , observations . Evaluations are done to find_out where a child should be placed -- with the parents , with mother or dad or grandma or someone else . My job is to see the whole picture , to plan ahead for the child while listening to the child . We are an independent voice to the court on behalf of the child . We may_not always agree with Department of Children ' s Services or with the therapist . I have a letter from the court allowing me to review school records , doctors ' records , psychiatric records , medical and hospital records and police reports so that I can make an assessment about the child ' s treatment , incorporate it into my report and help in other ways . I have a case now where the child has a speech impediment and is a slow learner . I insisted that the child receive testing for learning disability . I asked the people who evaluated him if his problems could be a combination of teeth missing and a hearing problem . We learned that he has a hearing problem and that he ' ll need surgery . Most of the children come from lower-income families , many of them are minority children , many have learning disabilities . They are sometimes coke babies or HIV positive babies . Some have physical disabilities . These children have been abused , and they lose trust -- especially in adults . I never touch a child initially . I sit_down and I let them come_to me . Then if they want to sit close to me , fine . Eventually , when they see that you are not a threat , they will open_up . Some open_up right away ; with some it takes years to reach them . A CASA volunteer brings understanding and closeness to the child that the child may_not receive at_home or in foster care . The child may want to talk to a social_worker or an attorney , but they may_not be there or have time . Maybe the child is in a group home and there ' s no one who listens to him or her . Maybe a telephone_call or visit from a CASA volunteer can make a difference . A CASA volunteer offers support to a child by going_with the child to court . It can make quite a difference to a child to know that he or she is not alone . Depending_on the case I may devote about about four or five hours a week per case . I make telephone_calls , make home , hospital and school visits . I may meet with the children , counselors , teachers , principals . Especially with teen-agers , I check that they are going_to classes , that they are not into gangs and if they are , then we have resources to help with that . As the years have gone_by we are more and more recognized in court . People know who we are and what we can do . And they ' re supportive . In fact on court_orders I see now CASA volunteers are requested -- some even by name .
