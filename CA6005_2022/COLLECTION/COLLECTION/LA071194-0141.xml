   <TEXT> Why did_it happen ? Why did Germany , the defending world champion , fall ? Was it , as Coach Berti Vogts insists , the result of only two errors ? Or was there something deeper behind Sunday ' s 2-1 quarterfinal loss to Bulgaria in front of a stunned crowd of 72 # 416 at Giants Stadium ? Certainly , the Germans were to blame for Andreas Moeller ' s stupid foul on Hristo Stoitchkov , barely outside the penalty area . Certainly , the Germans were to blame for building a wall that failed to stop Stoitchkov ' s subsequent free_kick . The wall was big enough , it just was not mobile enough . The players , fearing a deflection , failed to leap high enough to block the immaculate shot . Certainly , the Germans were to blame a short while later when Zlatko Iankov ' s cross was powered past goalkeeper Bodo Illgner by an excellent header from Yordan Letchkov . They should never have allowed the much shorter Thomas Haessler to be left alone to guard Letchkov , no matter how competent a player Haessler is . Those were the two errors to which Vogts pointed : the non-jumping wall and the mismatch of Haessler against Letchkov . That he would single them out is only natural , because neither mistake could be laid at his door . They were decisions the players had to make . In short , Vogts was saying : Don ' t blame me , I ' m only the coach . But there were other factors_in Sunday ' s defeat to which Vogts could have pointed but did not . He was handicapped , for instance , by the unavailability of Matthias Sammer , who had played exceptionally well in the tournament but was lost to injury . It turned_out to be a crucial loss . Vogts ' choice of starters was further limited by the absence of Stefan Effenberg , whom he had sent home for insulting the fans ; and Mario Basler , who returned to Germany to be with his wife , who was having difficulty with her pregnancy . So Germany ' s bench was not deep enough . The talent was not there to step_in when needed , and for that Vogts must bear at least a share of the blame . He selected the team . To his credit , he did not blame the referee , Colombia ' s Jose Torres Cadena , for disallowing the goal that would have put Germany ahead , 2-0 . &quot; We can discuss this forever , &quot; he said , &quot; but we have to accept the referee ' s decision , and we have accepted it. &quot; He could hardly have done otherwise , considering that Germany benefited from an earlier bad refereeing decision in its second-round victory over Belgium . So now Vogts and his players will be flying back to Germany , where a hostile reception is likely . Some will retire from the national team . Whether Vogts , who won the World Cup as a player in 1974 , will stay_on as coach is debatable . All of his predecessors won either the World Cup , the European Championship or both . Vogts ' Germany was beaten by upstart Denmark in the final of the 1992 European Championship in Gothenburg , Sweden . And now there is this startling loss to unheralded Bulgaria . History could have been made had Germany won this World Cup . Vogts would have joined Brazil ' s Mario Zagalo and Germany ' s Franz Beckenbauer as only the third_person to win the World Cup as a player and as a coach . That won ' t happen now . German captain Lothar Matthaus , who on Sunday played in a record-tying 21st World Cup game , could have broken that record on Wednesday . Had Germany won the tournament , he could also have become the first player in history to captain two World Cup-winning teams . That won ' t happen now . Juergen Klinsmann , had he scored one more goal , could have tied Russia ' s Oleg Salenko for the scoring lead and perhaps gone_on to win the title . That won ' t happen now . Instead , Germany will have to go_through post-tournament analysis and begin building a team capable of winning the 1996 European Championship in England and qualifying for the 1998 World Cup in France . This time , Germany qualified automatically as the defending champion . That , in the long_run , might have been its undoing . That and a Bulgarian team that refused to accept defeat .</TEXT>
