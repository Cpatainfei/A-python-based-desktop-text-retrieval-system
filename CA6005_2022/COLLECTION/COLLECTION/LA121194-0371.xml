   <HEADLINE> IN A BREAK FROM PAST , POOL HALLS GO UPSCALE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The image of the smoke-filled pool hall filled with hustlers seeking an easy_mark is giving_way to the swanky upscale &quot; billiard center &quot; that is fast becoming the hot club of the ' 90s . &quot; Pool halls were previously synonymous with a bunch of bums sitting around all day , &quot; said Daniel Gauci , a past president of the Billiard Congress of America . &quot; We are crushing the old image of sleazy pool halls and creating a new one. &quot; The new clubs are combining pool_tables with tony restaurants and hip discos to provide a sporting alternative to bars and dance clubs . Orange County is no exception . Pool players and people watchers can choose from Irvine ' s Metropolis , Plush Pockets in Lake Forest , Classic Q in Newport Beach and Orange County ' s newest upscale pool hall , On The Break Grille and Sports Club , at the former Golden Bear site in Huntington Beach . The Shark Club billiard pub in Costa Mesa combines California cuisine , progressive music , shark tanks and pool_tables in an &quot; industrial renaissance &quot; atmosphere . And people , unlike those at other pool halls , are not there to practice their pool skills . If they were , they would be in_for a surprise . On weekend nights , at all_of Orange County ' s highbrow pool halls , patrons can wait several hours for a table . And the price to play can be as much as $ 12 per hour . Indeed , the 500-year-old sport has had a revival , helped by the 1980s hit movie &quot; The Color of Money , &quot; which focused_on the high-stakes betting side . It is no longer a frowned-upon activity . In fact , it is now the world ' s fastest growing sport . Pool is now ranked the No . 2 participation sport for men behind soccer and is among the top 10 for women . One new club that is part of the revolution sweeping the country is The Ball Room , a 10 # 000-square-foot complex in Houston ' s center-city night life district . Similar clubs have opened throughout the country in cities such_as Chicago , Los Angeles and New York amid industry projections that two to three upscale billiard_parlors are opening every week in major cities . A typical club could cost millions to get started , including interiors and equipment . The Ball Room combines a pool hall with bar and restaurant that attracts well-heeled people willing to pay $ 10 for an hour of pool and $ 30 for a bottle of wine . Inside the building , which underwent about $ 700 # 000 in renovations , are reproductions of Renaissance masterpieces and a fireplace . The interior , painted in jewel colors , has plush furniture . The pool_tables are surrounded by lamps covered in crushed velvet . &quot; We ' re using pool as a means of social interaction . This is a very non-threatening environment , but it ' s a place where boys still want to meet girls and girls want to meet boys , &quot; said Ken Wales , co-owner of The Ball Room . &quot; Pool is not a fad , it ' s always been around , but it ' s definitely undergoing a revival. &quot; Hotshots can even compete with each other at a $ 2-per-game challenge table , but people don ' t line_up quarters on the table as is done_in traditional pool halls . Here , a hostess keeps track of contenders on a gold-framed chalkboard , racks the balls and even referees any disputes . For those looking_for a quiet atmosphere , people can shoot pool in the Green Room , closed by emerald velvet theatrical curtains , on two ornately carved $ 30 # 000 Renaissance Royal George tables , complete with tassels and leather pockets . And for those looking_to meet someone special , the new clubs are providing an environment where women and men can compete at a sport on a relatively level playing_field . &quot; To just hit the balls around and have some fun doesn ' t require a lot of skill , dexterity or practice , &quot; said Dina Langone , who visited the bar recently with a group of friends . &quot; And it ' s easy to meet people without pressure. &quot; Times Orange County correspondent Hope Hamashige contributed to this report .</TEXT>
