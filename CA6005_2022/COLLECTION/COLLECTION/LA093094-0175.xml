   <HEADLINE> FOX , NBC YANK THREE SHOWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Only 10 days into the fall season , both Fox and NBC yanked shows out of the prime-time lineup to shore_up obvious ratings weaknesses . Sent to the bench were NBC ' s &quot; The Martin Short Show &quot; and Fox ' s &quot; Fortune_Hunter &quot; and &quot; Wild Oats. &quot; NBC said Short ' s Tuesday night sitcom will definitely be given another shot in December , after the producers have had a chance to overhaul it -- again . The show had been revamped after the pilot that was shot to sell the series . The future of &quot; Fortune_Hunter &quot; and &quot; Wild_Oats &quot; is not so certain , particularly with the ouster on Wednesday of Fox programming chief Sandy Grushow . Whether his replacement , John Matoian , will want to keep them or cancel them was uncertain Thursday , a Fox spokesman said . &quot; Fortune_Hunter &quot; and &quot; Wild_Oats &quot; were two key factors that apparently led to Grushow ' s dismissal -- part of the Sunday lineup that has been trounced by ABC , CBS and NBC despite the expensive addition of NFL football as a lead-in to the prime-time fare . &quot; Wild_Oats , &quot; a sex-oriented sitcom at 9:30 p.m. , ranked 89th among last week ' s 92 prime-time network programs , and &quot; Fortune_Hunter , &quot; a spy drama slotted at 7 p.m. opposite &quot; 60 Minutes , &quot; was 92nd . &quot; Fortune_Hunter &quot; will air again this weekend , then will be replaced by &quot; Encounters : The Hidden Truth , &quot; a magazine-style series about &quot; strange and unexplained phenomena &quot; that Fox tried_out this summer . The 9:30 slot will be filled for two weeks by reruns of &quot; Married . . . With Children , &quot; then by &quot; The George Carlin Show , &quot; a sitcom returning from last season . Ratings for &quot; The Martin Short Show &quot; declined nearly 10 % this week and were lower than for shows on either side of it , &quot; Wings &quot; and &quot; Frasier. &quot; NBC will fill the next three Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m. with repeats of &quot; Wings &quot; and &quot; Mad About You , &quot; with plans after that still to be determined .</TEXT>
