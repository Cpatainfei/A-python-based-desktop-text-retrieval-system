   <HEADLINE> PRISON ' S SUDDEN CHANGING OF THE GUARD ; PICKING A NEW WARDEN FOR THE PROBLEM-PLAGUED LANCASTER FACILITY IS A GOOD IDEA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A significant management change was definitely in_order at the California State_Prison in Lancaster . Otis Thurman , it seems , has been given a_few future employment options by the state_Department of Corrections . Those suggestions apparently do not include staying_on as warden of the year-old , problem-plagued prison . Lancaster residents and elected officials undoubtedly recall that the $ 207-million , 252-acre , 4 # 000-inmate facility in west Lancaster was billed as being state-of-the-art and as escape-proof as possible . But the welcome_mat also was out because of the effects that the prison ' s construction and operation would have_on a beleaguered local economy . Since the facility ' s opening , however , there have been four escapes , two of them involving maximum-security inmates . All the escapees were recaptured , but not without some luck . One inmate who fled by stowing away in a garbage_truck , for example , was compacted in a bale of trash and unceremoniously dumped in a local landfill . And there have been sufficient problems inside the prison to lead to at least a_few questions about how well inmates are being managed and controlled . So far , guards have shot and wounded four maximum-security prisoners . Two of those incidents involved fights between inmates who could not be controlled . Yet another February fracas occurred when nearly a third of the 159 inmates who were being subjected_to body and cell searches decided to resist . Some of the latter might have been adequately explained by prison or corrections officials , but the early months of the Lancaster facility also have been marred by one horrendous public relations problem after another . You ' ll recall , for example , that it took prison officials two hours to notify local sheriff ' s deputies about the escape of an inmate serving a life sentence for murder without possibility of parole . Another nine hours passed before the Lancaster City_Council was informed . Equally disconcerting was the report released by Warden Thurman explaining why convicted killer Eric Rene Johnson was able to escape in the first place . Thurman blamed , in part , prison construction deficiencies and the fact that the supervising officer was distracted . No and no , responded Tip Kindel , state corrections department assistant director , who contradicted the warden and instead blamed staff negligence and procedural inadequacies . We ' re not sure which was worse , the gross discrepancy between explanations or the loud silence from the prison following Kindel ' s remarks . Consider it one more reason why picking a new warden is an eminently sensible idea .</TEXT>
