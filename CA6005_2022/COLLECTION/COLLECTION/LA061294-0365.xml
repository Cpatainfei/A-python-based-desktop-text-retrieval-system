   <HEADLINE> DESTINATION : EUROPE ; THERE ' S ALWAYS A FIRST TIME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Of the 8 million or so Americans who board jets for European vacations this year , a goodly number will be first-timers : Eurailpasses at_the_ready , guidebooks in_hand , too_much luggage and acute writer ' s cramp from signing all those travelers checks . The novice independent traveler may_not know just what to expect on arrival , but most are convinced that a combination of high-school French and Davy Crockett determination will see them through just about anything the Continent can throw at them . And , bless their abiding faith , it usually will . Herewith , however , is a small and random collection of hard-core facts , assorted trivia and blatant personal opinion gathered during our five years of living in Europe , plus returning several times yearly since 1957 . None of it will armor first-timers against occasional culture shock , but it may help you maintain a sense_of_humor on_the_road . And that ' s half the battle right there . Just bear_in_mind that things can be very different over there , often startlingly so . For example , brace yourself for the bedside lighting in many European hotels . It usually falls_into two categories : 5- and 10-watt . We ' ve seen feeble fireflies that radiate more lumens than a Continental reading light . Thomas_Edison would roll_over at the state of his invention , but there ' s nothing to be done short of carrying a good flashlight for studying your maps after sunset . Hotel showers can be just as mystifying . Demented engineers have designed hot-and-cold shower controls that may resemble the instrument_panel of a 747 , yet no two seem to be alike . The result can range from liquid icicles , to what seems very much like live_steam , almost instantly . It really gets you going . Then , take money : Let ' s start with the chiseled-in-stone fact that most of Europe is now very expensive , and that ' s only an estimate . Take_away Eastern Europe , Greece , Portugal and the absolute boondocks of a_few other countries and , despite the dollar ' s recent modest revival , dining and lodging costs in much of Europe can curl your hair . But don ' t despair . we ' ll try to lessen the financial jolt with a_few suggestions , plus a tip or two on how to make any European trip more enjoyable and rewarding . Get Prior Help : One of the most inane notions held by many first-time European visitors is that they will simply step off the plane and all_the spectacular scenery , innumerable joys and cultural attractions of Britain and the Continent will unfurl like a pageant before their eyes . Nothing could be further from the truth . So get_in_touch with the national tourist offices nearest you for the countries you plan to visit . ( Most countries with well-developed marketing efforts maintain foreign government tourist offices in Los Angeles and New York. ) Ask them for brochures and other information on your itinerary , say , of France ' s Loire Valley or Cote d ' Azur , Austria ' s glorious Salzkammergut lake region , the_hill towns of Tuscany or the delightful fishing villages of England ' s Cornwall . It ' s a marvelous travel tool and one that even veteran travelers often fail to take_advantage of . Get Train Facts : Rail Europe ( 800-438-7245 ) will send along a 44-page brochure outlining all_the Eurailpass , Flexipass and individual countries ' rail passes , including costs , for a no-toll telephone_call . It ' s your ticket to travel_by train , bus , ferry and lake steamer in 17 European_countries . Some will still prefer to travel_by rental car , and our very strong suggestion is that rentals be booked before leaving home , since the rack rate at the overseas counter will certainly be considerably more_than the pre-booked cost . Another sensible idea is to select nothing larger than a mid-size car , since a huge sedan can be nothing but trouble on many European roads and most city streets . And gas is still hovering in the $ 3.50-per-gallon range wherever you tank up . Avis , Hertz and Budget also have toll-free 800 numbers for comparing rates or booking . Check them out at 331-1084 , 654-3001 and 527-0700 respectively . Pack Super Light : If there is one thing that has ruined more trips than bad_weather , the common_cold and assorted other adversities , it ' s too_much luggage . The Grand_Tour days are over , and with them the steamer trunk , so try to make_do with one medium-size suitcase ( hard or soft ) and a generous shoulder_bag . With a careful selection of contents , this will get you through several weeks of European travel dressed as appropriately as anyone you ' ll meet , not counting those in Queen Elizabeth ' s box at Ascot or at the Vienna Opera Ball . No matter how sensibly you pack , make room for a_couple_of downright necessities . Purloin at least a dozen of those flimsy plastic vegetable bags from your friendly supermarket . They ' re great for soiled and damp clothing , perhaps for gathering film rolls or wrapping the special herbal shampoo that could end_up lathering your luggage if it leaks . The second must is a roll of your favorite T-paper , pressed flat to save space . While European scientists are making great headway in this vexing tissue technology , some of the stuff you find in the loos of budget hotels and on trains still resembles Johann Gutenberg ' s original parchment . So let the fastidious be forewarned . Two other staples in our personal kit_bags have long been the oft-praised Swiss Army knife and a one-liter plastic flask . The latter ( ours is an indestructible and leak-proof hospital I.V. bottle ) allows a relaxing draft in your hotel_room after a hard day of travel or sightseeing prior to sprucing_up for dinner downstairs . Our decades-old knife ' s uses are daily and innumerable , and tuning a piano is just about the only thing we ' ve never tried with it . Shun the Movie : Never , but never , watch a movie when flying to Europe . When the meal is over and the lights go_down , that ' s your cue to slip_on the eye shades , get as comfortable as possible and put a_few hours sleep_in the bank before arrival . Jet_lag being what it is , this won ' t make you feel_like going discoing on your first night in Europe . But you also won ' t be walking into doors for the first two or three days . Dawn Patrol : Leave an early wake-up call and be off on your city sightseeing right after a fast cafe_au_lait and croissant . Athens ' Acropolis is practically deserted before 10 a.m. , when the first phalanx of tour buses arrive . The Louvre , British Museum and other culture stops become equally inundated by mid-morning . With an early start , you may_not have the Elgin marbles , Rosetta stone and Mona Lisa to yourself , but the noontime hordes won ' t stand 15-deep before them either . Our favorite crash-course introduction to a city is an early morning visit to one of its markets . An hour or so in London ' s Smithfield or Leadenhall markets , perhaps the same in Barcelona ' s colorful La Boqueria at city_center , will tell you more about a country and its people than a library of guidebooks . Just look , listen and learn about local food and folkways from the colorful costermongers and their customers . If you know_nothing about a large city on your itinerary , or are overpowered by it all , don ' t hesitate to take a half-day American Express or other local tourist company ' s morning tour . It will highlight the city and give you numerous points_of_reference for later navigation on_your_own . Vienna , Madrid , Athens or Istanbul will slip into focus a lot faster this way , so don ' t feign the sophisticated-traveler guise by ignoring this time-saving tip . Trains in Europe are marvelous , and the Eurailpass surely the best thing to happen to European travel since World_War_II . Yet few people know how they can save even more money with the pass : Just book a couchette . A couchette is a no-frills bunk in a second-class compartment for overnight travel , complete with clean blankets and pillow . The cost is $ 24 this year , no matter the distance traveled . For instance , a crack express leaves Paris every evening and arrives early the next morning in Munich , just in time for a hearty Bavarian breakfast of wurst , black_bread and beer in the train_station . Compare the $ 48 cost for two persons with the price of a double room in a moderate hotel in the pricey cities of Paris and Munich , and you ' ll see the savings , which of course include transportation across Western Europe with your Eurailpass . Diners in Mediterranean countries , particularly in Spain and Greece , prefer their vegetables at room_temperature rather than steaming hot . Flavors and freshness become more pronounced as plates cool , and it begins to grow on you . So don ' t send the tepid turnips back until you ' ve tried them . On the other hand , sensible Southern Europeans often chill their red table_wines during summer . Gourmets and oenophiles may blanch , but it ' s very refreshing and wards_off the afternoon blahs after a long lunch . English Everywhere : While that high_school French could stand you in good stead at times , the lingua_franca all_over Europe today is English . It ' s very difficult to find a Scandinavian , Swiss or Hollander who isn ' t near-fluent in our language , and plenty of English rises from the polyglot in hotels , restaurants , train_stations and the_like all_over Europe . This isn ' t to say that it ' s not a good idea to learn a_few civilities in the language of the country , such_as please , thank_you , good_morning and so forth . Anyone anywhere is likely to appreciate your giving their language a shot , even a short one , and their smile is your reward . By and large , people throughout Europe are very friendly and helpful to their visitors . The waiter , cabdriver or hotel_clerk with the disposition of a wounded leopard is a distinct rarity these days . Terrific Trams : Taxi_fares in major European cities can burn through a budget as fast as anything we know . Yet trams offer a quick and economic way of getting_around without going broke . Amsterdam ' s hum along at just under the speed of sound and will get you anywhere in town within minutes , albeit sometimes skewering a pedestrian or unwary Volkswagen along the way . Paris ' Metro system and London ' s Underground are also time- and money-savers and , contrary to misbegotten tales of woe , very simple to use . While our itineraries are usually fairly firm , we almost never nail_down the exact dates we will be in a city or town . What if a London play or favorite Vienna opera opens the day after our planned departure ? A layover can present problems for the next town ' s hotel reservations , hence the telephone . Long distance rates are reasonable in Europe , so just call ahead for a room . Or , if languages aren ' t your forte , have your present hotel ' s desk make the call_for you . We ' ve done this dozens of times and always with success . Summer Scarcities : This is particularly important during the June-through-August tourist months , when everything from hotel_rooms to Venetian bel_canto gondoliers are at a premium . Now throw_in a large city ' s trade fair , music festival or convention , and seeking a place to lay your head can be , as Zorba said of his marriage , &quot; the full catastrophe. &quot; Sure , some first-timers pull_off a trip that ticks along like a fine Swiss watch , with nary a glitch in_sight . Others come_home aware that a first trip to Europe should be one of life ' s most exhilarating and rewarding adventures , yet they are vaguely dissatisfied . Planning beforehand can ' t guarantee your inclusion in the first group , but it will go_a_long_way toward keeping you out of the second . One last suggestion for a successful trip . If it ' s for three weeks or longer , make every effort to take a two- or three-day break around midpoint and relax from the heady pace . Just pick a small_town or village that suits your fancy and hang_out with the locals , with no thought to maps or guidebooks . A few days in a rustic village of Belgium ' s Ardennes forest , on a small Greek isle or amid the wildflowers of Italy ' s lovely Abruzzi hills will bring_home the true meaning of recreation : to re-create one ' s strengths and lift one ' s spirits . Chances are very , very good that it will also be the most memorable part of your trip .</TEXT>
