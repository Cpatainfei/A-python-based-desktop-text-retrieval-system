   <HEADLINE> LAWMAKERS REJECT YELTSIN ' S ANTI-CRIME PLAN AS TOO HARSH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russia ' s Parliament sent President Boris N . Yeltsin a resounding nyet Wednesday , voting overwhelmingly to reject a presidential anti-crime plan that foes say would wipe_out many hard-won new constitutional rights . Despite a crime_wave that has terrorized and enraged many Russians , lawmakers protested that Yeltsin ' s harsh cure smelled too_much of the odious practices of Soviet days . His June 12 decree would allow police to detain suspects for 30 days without charges ; search offices , cars and passengers without warrants , and inspect bank records of those suspected of organized_crime without obtaining a court_order . It would also make evidence gathered by wiretapping admissible in court . &quot; This is exactly how it all began in the ' 30s , &quot; said radical nationalist lawmaker Sergei N . Baburin , referring to Soviet dictator Josef Stalin ' s reign_of_terror . &quot; We all know what this finally led to. &quot; The Stalin-era terror was heralded by a 1934 law-and-order decree that made_it easier to convict criminals . The campaign is believed to have claimed the lives of at least 20 million people . On Wednesday , outnumbered democrats in the 6-month-old Duma , the lower house , found themselves -- to their astonishment -- agreeing with Communists and nationalists in the 279-10 vote . Parliament lacks the power to override a presidential decree , but Yeltsin ' s staunchest allies voted to ask him to suspend the anti-crime measures . The rebuff came even as Yeltsin scored big international gains . In Washington , Russian officials announced that a Clinton-Yeltsin summit will be held_in September ; in Brussels , Russia at last signed the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization ' s &quot; Partnership for Peace &quot; accord -- with a side treaty that gave the fallen superpower bragging rights to much of its lost prestige . Meanwhile , in what appeared to be a trial_balloon , Vladimir F . Shumeiko , leader of Parliament ' s upper house , told various news organizations that Yeltsin and parliamentary leaders had agreed &quot; in principle &quot; to postpone the 1996 elections for two years . Ivan Rybkin , leader of the lower house , initially said he liked the idea but on Wednesday told Russian television that it should be treated with caution . The constitution that Yeltsin begged voters to adopt six months ago calls_for presidential and parliamentary elections in 1996 . Shumeiko has supported Yeltsin ' s most unpopular decisions . When Yeltsin dissolved the old Supreme Soviet in September and promised to run_for reelection this month -- then changed his mind after his foes were defeated -- Shumeiko took_to the hustings to defend the president . There was no immediate reaction to Shumeiko ' s statements from the Duma , which was preoccupied with forcing Yeltsin to revise his crime plan . Former dissident Sergei Kovalyov , chairman of the Human_Rights Committee , called the president ' s decree an intolerable violation of the civil_rights guaranteed by the new constitution . Kovalyov , who was sent to labor camp for defending Andrei D . Sakharov , the late Nobel laureate and human_rights activist , said Russia has a bad tradition of letting doctors , not patients , write laws on health_care -- and police , not citizens , draft criminal codes . He cited an instance , in the Volga republic of Bashkortostan , in which police were recently permitted to detain suspects for 30 days after a state official was slain . &quot; Five hundred suspects were detained in a town of 35 # 000 , &quot; Kovalyov said . &quot; Three of the suspects tried to commit suicide , and two quite independently of each other pleaded guilty. &quot; But Nikolai I . Travkin , leader of the conservative Democratic Party of Russia , called Kovalyov one of &quot; God ' s fools. &quot; &quot; They would let half the country be shot in the street but not a single criminal ' s human_rights may be violated , &quot; he said . &quot; Today we will not conquer crime by normal , civilized methods . It is overwhelming us. &quot; Yeltsin ' s decree took a drubbing in Moscow ' s most influential newspapers . One of its only backers was Alexander I . Solzhenitsyn , the famed , Nobel Prize-winning author who returned to Russia last month from exile in Vermont and is now lamenting the moral decline of his homeland . Neo-fascist lawmaker Vladimir V . Zhirinovsky , predictably , denounced the Yeltsin decree as insufficiently tough . He said he would introduce his own Draconian plan Friday . Yeltsin ' s promise to crack_down on &quot; criminal filth &quot; followed a bloody spring of bombings , killings , kidnaping , hostage-taking and hijacking , as well as street crime -- which has grown all too common here . One Yeltsin aide warned lawmakers not to discredit themselves by appearing to be soft_on crime ; both sides promised to seek compromise . The Kremlin and Duma are each at_work revising the unwieldy Soviet-era criminal code .</TEXT>
