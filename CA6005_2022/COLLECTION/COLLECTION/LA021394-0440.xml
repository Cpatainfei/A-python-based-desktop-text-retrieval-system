   <HEADLINE> THE NEXT L.A. / REINVENTING OUR FUTURE ; HEALTH_CARE ; MEDICAL CENTRAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Health_care in the Southern California of the future would , in the vision of experts , be delivered in an entirely different manner than today . A highly coordinated network would replace the current fragmented system . The network would function as well in times of disaster as it would in meeting people ' s day-to-day medical needs . The Network Health_care would be organized around geographic sectors , each with a hub . Such a system would ensure that ambulances are where they need to be , that supplies are stockpiled and that patient load is distributed most effectively . 1 . Acute-Care Hospital These super hospitals would act_as the hub of each geographic network . They would provide basic emergency services , general surgery and intensive care and would have some transitional beds for patients prior to discharge home or to outlying facilities . Most would have about 150 beds , but a_few would be designated as major trauma centers with as_many as 500 beds . 2 . The &quot; Sub-Acutes &quot; The next level down in this system would be &quot; sub-acute &quot; hospitals . Functioning much like today ' s community hospitals , they would be spaced around the main hospital and would take patients for short recuperative stays . 3 . The Satellites Physician groups would be based in medical office satellites . Such facilities would be equipped to treat minor injuries and dispense medication . Each facility would have on-site storage or generation capacity for electricity , fuel , water and medical gases for at least a week . Ambulances would be based at the medical office satellites . The Super Hospital Some of the acute-care hospitals would be larger , with up_to 500 beds , and specially equipped to handle major disasters . * Special procedures : Trauma center backup , extra beds * Surgery : Full-capability operating_rooms * Sterile supplies : Protected storage * Imaging center : X-rays , MRIs , EKGs , etc . * Trauma center : Emergency_room and communications center Helipad : Ambulance helicopter would be stationed at acute-care hub hospital , with a triage area nearby The Lifeboat Concept Traditional hospitals are sitting ducks in a disaster . In the health_care network of the future , all medical facilities -- the super hospital , the sub-acutes and the satellites -- would be constructed to remain fully functional after a magnitude 8 earthquake . Each would act_as a &quot; lifeboat &quot; for the community in times of disaster , with backup generating capacity for electricity , fuel , water and medical gases for at least a week . Ambulances would be based at satellite medical_centers , while an ambulance helicopter would be based at each hub hospital . The medical facilities would be directly linked to the police , fire and civil_defense communications networks . Among the features : * Security safeguards , including limited entry points , a minimum number of windows and metal detectors * Expansion joints to keep entire building from collapsing if one section gives_out * Microwave dishes placed on top for communication with the city ' s emergency command bunker and other hospitals * Independent ventilation and exhaust_system Sources : Stephen Gamble of the Hospital Council of Southern California ; Erich A .
