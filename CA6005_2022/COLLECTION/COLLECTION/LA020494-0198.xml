   <HEADLINE> BORLA REVS UP PERFORMANCE ; TRANSPORTATION : EXHAUST-SYSTEMS COMPANY MAKES A NAME FOR ITSELF WITH CAR BUFFS . THEY SPEND BETWEEN $ 330 AND $ 3 # 000 FOR ITS PRODUCTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sell American high-performance auto mufflers to the Japanese on their home turf ? It ' s not just a pipe_dream for Borla Performance Industries . Last month the Oxnard company introduced its first product for the Japanese , an exhaust_system for Corvettes , at a Tokyo auto show . Alexander Borla , president of the 11-year-old company , said marketing his exhaust_systems in Japan is a sound move . &quot; We ' re riding the wave of American automobiles that are winding_up in Japan . Every year I see more and more , &quot; as jeeps , sports_cars and Harley-Davidson motorcycles are getting popular . Borla ' s company , which he claims did $ 3 million in sales last year , has made a name for itself with a line of stainless-steel exhaust_systems . The systems extract more power from an auto or truck ' s engine because they work more efficiently at getting the hot gasses out of the engine than conventional exhaust_pipes , mufflers and catalytic_converters . Most of his customers are baby_boomers who remember the &quot; muscle cars &quot; of the ' 60s and are willing to spend more to squeeze extra power out of their cars . When Ford , General Motors or Chrysler produces a vehicle , the mufflers are designed to be as quiet as possible , Borla said . But about 10 % of the owners are willing to put_up with a bit more noise to improve acceleration , he said . Instead of spending $ 60 at Midas for a new muffler , these car buffs will spend from $ 330 to $ 3 # 000 for a Borla exhaust_system . About 50 small companies in the U . S . make high-performance exhaust_systems that they sell through specialty auto parts shops and the mail . Borla and its competition have thrived , independent experts say , because the exhaust_system &quot; is the cheapest , most effective way to get a rear-wheel horsepower increase in any kind of vehicle , &quot; said Dick Gazan , owner of Spectra Racing &amp; Engine Development in San Dimas . Joe Sherman , a Huntington Beach racing-engine builder , said he uses less expensive exhaust_systems that &quot; perform as good or better &quot; than the Borla models , but credits Borla with offering a quality product . &quot; He makes everything out of stainless_steel . Right away the price goes_up , &quot; Sherman said . &quot; But it should last about three times as long . You might say he has the Cadillac line of mufflers. &quot; Borla Industries and its Japanese distributor , Startline Inc. , hope to offer exhaust_systems for the American vehicles most popular in Japan , including Camaros , Firebirds , Jeep Cherokees and Chevrolet Astro vans . &quot; The Japanese are . . . heavily into the American auto scene so they want American parts on their cars and motorcycles , &quot; Borla said . To meet Japan ' s emissions laws and other requirements , Borla recently became the first company based outside Japan to join the Japan Automotive Sports Muffler Assn . On his trip to Japan last month , Borla said he met with U . S . Ambassador Walter F . Mondale , who complimented him on working his way into the Japanese market . &quot; He was very interested in how we became successful in Japan and interested in_using the same formula to help other companies , &quot; Borla said . Borla said that , within five years , Europe and Asia , which now account_for 10 % of his company ' s sales , will increase to 25 % . With the expansion into Japan , his goal is $ 600 # 000 in foreign sales in 1994 . The company sells currently in Australia , England , Canada , Germany and New Zealand , the Arab Emirates , Brunei , Holland and South_America . What makes Borla ' s mufflers stand_out ? &quot; You can take any of our mufflers and look right through it , &quot; he said . &quot; Other mufflers have baffles -- or what I call ' mazes and rat traps. ' The hot exhaust gasses have to go all_over the place , &quot; which diminishes engine power . Borla has two patents and a third pending for a combination muffler and catalytic_converter that enhances performance and reduces emissions . A big auto_maker , Borla claims , has expressed interest in utilizing the technology under license for its exhaust_systems . Having a fast , agile set of wheels has always been a priority for Borla , a Romanian immigrant who was fascinated with autos as a teen-ager . In 1976 he started a New York company that made replacement exhaust_systems for Rolls-Royces and Bentleys . But his heart remained with sports_cars and racing . &quot; I got bored with the stodgy , old people who owned Rolls-Royces . I wanted to get involved in performance vehicles , &quot; Borla said . He sold the East Coast operation and moved across country , leased space and , starting with $ 7 # 000 and 10 new employees , opened his company in 1983 . Over the years he got publicity by developing exhaust_systems for the auto_makers ' &quot; concept cars &quot; exhibited at auto shows . He also advertises in about 30 auto magazines , including Car and Driver , Road &amp; Track and Motor Trend . Borla offers exhaust components for about 200 vehicles , from exotic Ferraris and Lamborghinis to more subdued Chevrolet Suburbans . When Borla started , he was in the highbrow Mercedes-Benz , BMW and Porsche market . But he saw that the money was in volume , so he shifted the product_line to the larger American market and started making exhaust equipment for Corvettes and full-size pickup_trucks . Today his list_prices range from $ 332 for a Chrysler Eagle Talon exhaust_system to $ 3 # 048 for a Lamborghini Diablo . &quot; European cars have gotten so expensive . You can go_out and buy a $ 20 # 000 American car and blow away an $ 80 # 000 Mercedes , &quot; said Borla , who drives a 1993 Ford Mustang Cobra equipped , naturally , with Borla mufflers . By the time he ' s through tweaking and adding a supercharger , he figures he ' ll have about 450 horsepower under the hood . Last fall the company , which now has 50 workers , moved to a five-acre site that will include an emissions lab , an eighth--mile drag strip , a slalom course and a skid pad to test cars fitted with Borla mufflers To diversify , the company plans to eventually sell a turbocharging system for Harley Davidsons in Japan . But Borla ' s growth has been fueled by aggressive marketing . Sales of the company ' s mufflers and exhaust_systems , which he said are available as dealer-installed options at Ford dealers nationwide this year , could produce another $ 800 # 000 in sales this year .</TEXT>
