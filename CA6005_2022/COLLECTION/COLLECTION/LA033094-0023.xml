   <TEXT> When it comes_to dysfunctional families , neither the Oedipus clan nor even the Reagans offer a more intriguing case_history than Osiris and Isis , a pair of ancient Egyptian_deities who were &quot; not only sister and brother , but also wife and husband , queen and king , goddess and god. &quot; The story of these star-crossed siblings , as recounted by Jonathan Cott in &quot; Isis and Osiris , &quot; features incestuous love , matricide , dismemberment , anal rape , necrophilia , tragic death and miraculous rebirth . And , as Cott shows us , the myth of Isis and Osiris continues to exert a powerful and almost magical influence on seekers and believers . &quot; Astonishingly , some five thousand years after the first recorded acknowledgment of her existence , &quot; Cott writes , &quot; the Mother of All and her brother / husband / consort are still being worshiped today in many countries of the world. &quot; Cott introduces us to Isis and Osiris by recounting their story in solemn , measured , almost sacral tones -- but the story itself is so full of strange passion that the narrative almost catches_fire . Indeed , Cott ' s book shows us exactly why the old myth is so enduring and so beguiling . Osiris and Isis are twins who fell_in_love in their mother ' s womb and grew_up as &quot; a couple whose love passed understanding. &quot; But a jealous brother murdered Osiris and sliced his body into 14 pieces . The grieving Isis summoned her dead lover from beyond the grave to impregnate her with the child who will be &quot; his son , heir and avenger. &quot; And thus Isis and Osiris achieve a kind of immortality , and their myth offers &quot; the promise of eternal_life and resurrection. &quot; &quot; I am life rushing on , &quot; declares Horus , the child of their mystical union , &quot; born from the egg of the world , from the belly of a magic woman , born of my father ' s dreams . . . . A man forgets , but his heart remembers -- the love and the terror , the weeping , the beating of wings. &quot; The tale of Isis and Osiris is virtually an encyclopedia of mythic imagery , and so we are hardly surprised when Cott argues that its meanings can be traced into such far-flung spiritual manifestations as the passion of Christ and the doctrine of chakras in the Kundalini system of yoga . &quot; Except for who knows what vagaries , &quot; observes curator Robert S . Bianchi , &quot; we in the West might today be Isis devotees instead of Jews , Christians or Muslims. &quot; Indeed , much of &quot; Isis and Osiris &quot; is an account of Cott ' s quest_for the linkages between the ancient Egyptian myth and its renaissance in the contemporary_world . Along the way , Cott introduces us to the sages who study Isis and Osiris -- and , more to_the_point , the seekers who continue to venerate them . At the heart of the now-fashionable &quot; goddess worship , &quot; Cott suggests , is the enduring figure of Isis : &quot; Mother of All , Ruler of the Elements , Progenitor of Worlds , Chief of All Deities. &quot; The adepts and aficionados whom Cott profiles in &quot; Isis and Osiris &quot; range from dispassionate scholars to wildly inventive psychotherapists to self-styled arch-priestesses . They perceive and interpret Isis and Osiris in starkly different ways , but all_of them are drawn to the exotic light of their myth . For example , James P . Allen , a curator of Egyptian art at the Metropolitan Museum of Modern Art , argues that the god myths of ancient Egypt are the functional equivalent of our concepts of quantum physics , a way of explaining the world to ourselves in sometimes richly metaphorical language . &quot; Those who worship Isis and Osiris have simply singled_out one aspect ( of ancient Egyptian religion ) to identify with , &quot; Allen says , &quot; although to me , it ' s the same as worshiping electromagneticism or gravity. &quot; By contrast , Cott finds his way to a hidden community of so-called Ammonites in Cairo who submit themselves to the &quot; Forty-two Laws of the Saints &quot; drawn from the Book of the Dead and worship the pantheon of ancient Egyptian gods , including Isis and Osiris . &quot; Since the days of the first Ammonite kingdoms outside Egypt , we ' ve been wandering as freaks of the earth , &quot; says the mysterious woman who claims to occupy the Lotus Throne of the Pharaoh and who regards her 9-year-old son as a living incarnation of Horus , the offspring of Isis and Osiris , &quot; but by being freaks we have kept the seed of truth alive. &quot; At moments , the Isis worshipers come_across as charming eccentrics . For example , we spend a good_deal of time in the company of a brother-and-sister team who preside over the so-called Fellowship of Isis at Clonegal Castle in Ireland -- but Isis is only one of the passions of &quot; archpriestess and hierophant &quot; Olivia Robertson , a ripping good raconteur who also believes_in UFOs , reincarnation and ghosts , and who says she was once visited by Mary Magdalene : &quot; She had a face like Vanessa Redgrave ' s , &quot; Olivia recalls . But , mostly , Cott appears to take his subject quite seriously . He ' s an accomplished chronicler of myth and legend whose work has appeared in journals as diverse as Rolling Stone and Parabola , and he approaches his subject with both a subtle sense_of_humor and a profound sense of compassion . And he is utterly free_of sarcasm and condescension toward the men and women whose zealous beliefs he is exploring . In fact , at the end of his quest , Cott leaves us with an epiphany of_his_own that suggests a visitation by Isis herself . &quot; Adorned with every star of heaven / mirror on your forehead / serpents by your side , &quot; goes the poem that Cott wrote to capture his dreamy encounter with the goddess , &quot; one breathes your perfumed air / through nights of sweetest sleep / until your mirror becomes the sun . . . . &quot;</TEXT>
