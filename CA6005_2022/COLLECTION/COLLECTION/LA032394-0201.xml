   <HEADLINE> BESIEGED CITY GETS PLANELOAD OF FOOD , MEDICINE ; BOSNIA : IT IS THE FIRST HUMANITARIAN AID TUZLA HAS SEEN SINCE THE SERBIAN REBEL BLOCKADE BEGAN TWO YEARS AGO . SPIRITS ARE LIFTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A single U.N. plane carrying food and medicine broke_through rain_clouds and a Serbian rebel blockade Tuesday to launch a humanitarian airlift to this crowded city , which has evaded shelling and &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; only to become a magnet for the homeless , hungry and maimed . The first flight into Tuzla ' s airport since the Serbian insurgency began two years ago lifted spirits among the dejected people here who have watched their multicultural city crumble into embittered factions as half a_million Muslim refugees flooded_in . &quot; We have nothing . We ' ve been starved by the aggressors , and our city has been ruined , &quot; complained Azra Nisic , a wizened 41-year-old who blames the international community for leaving Tuzla so_long at the mercy of the Serbian blockade . &quot; But maybe God is helping us now ; maybe we will finally get enough to eat. &quot; Only 22 tons of wheat_flour , medicine and school supplies accompanied the U.N. officials ferried in by the first flight to Tuzla for a day of inaugural fanfare . That first delivery also might be the last for weeks to come . Bickering over the number and nationality of U.N. troops needed to inspect incoming cargo has blocked an agreement between Serbian rebels and Muslim-led government forces to allow daily flights by the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees ; the Tuzla shipments are to be like those that have kept Sarajevo from starving during two years of blockade and bombardment . But Serbs contend that the U.N.-operated airport , which is in government-held territory , could become a conduit for weapons smuggling . They have insisted that Russian members of the U.N. Protection Force be posted at the airport , which is within Serbian artillery range . Serbs see the Russians as allies , which prompts the government to object . For the time being , said Yasushi Akashi , civilian head of the U.N. mission , only military flights to resupply 1 # 000 Scandinavian peacekeepers deployed to the Tuzla area will be allowed to land at the airport . Akashi said he hopes humanitarian aid flights can begin within a_few days and &quot; certainly within three weeks. &quot; The limited achievement of opening the airport only for U.N. military use reflected the two-steps-forward , one-step-back nature of recent peace efforts in the Balkans . A cease-fire has held_in Sarajevo for six weeks , and Muslims and Croats have reconciled after a year of deadly fighting over what land was left after Serbs conquered 70 % of Bosnia . Yet war dangers still plague most of the country , and prospects for a negotiated settlement seem as distant as ever . The search for peace in Bosnia inevitably leads to the suspended conflict in Croatia , where Serbian rebels grabbed one-third of the country in 1991 and proclaimed their own state , the Republic of Serbian Krajina . Nationalists in Belgrade , the Serbian capital , want to link Krajina and Serb-occupied areas of Bosnia into a Greater Serbia . Russian-mediated talks in the Croatian capital , Zagreb , between Krajina rebels and Croatian government officials got under way with the aim of drafting a final settlement of the conflict frozen by the U.N. deployment in early 1992 . But the sides remain polarized , with the rebels insisting on independence and the Croatian leadership refusing to consider anything other_than full sovereignty over Krajina . John Mills , an aide to mediators at the first Serb-Croat talks aimed at a peace_treaty , described the opening session as &quot; detailed and purposeful &quot; but reported no progress . Signs of tension also arose in Bosnia , with Serbs resuming efforts to block humanitarian aid to the Muslim enclave of Maglaj and ignoring demands by U.N. officials to remove a cache of tanks and guns discovered near Sarajevo , in violation of a NATO deadline for withdrawal of all artillery around the capital . Officials of the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees , which supplies Bosnia ' s nearly 3 million needy , further deflated the significance of the Tuzla airlift by noting that a genuine breakthrough for peace would be restoration of trade and transport . &quot; Humanitarian aid is not the solution ; let ' s not fool ourselves , &quot; said Manoel de Almeida e Silva , spokesman for the aid agency . &quot; What is needed is for the situation to return to normalcy , and one element of that is the resumption of commercial traffic. &quot; Since Serbian nationalists rebelled against Bosnia ' s proclaimed independence from Yugoslavia , the country has been carved_up by the warring factions and studded with roadblocks . U.N. officials said months ago that opening an air corridor to Tuzla was vital to ensure that aid got_through to the region ' s 800 # 000 people , more_than half of whom are dependent_on foreign handouts . Threatened NATO air strikes and diplomatic pressure from Russia compelled Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic to agree to the airlift . Tuzla was getting as little as 12 % of the aid targeted for the region late last year because of Serbian barricades on some convoy routes and because Muslim-Croat fighting blocked others . With the Muslims and Croats now reconciled and some Serbian factions relenting amid the better atmosphere generated by the string of successful cease-fires , at least 45 % of the needed food is expected to reach Tuzla this month , said Robyn Ziebert , the U.N. aid agency ' s Tuzla representative . Akashi presented Tuzla Mayor Selim Beslagic with a box of vegetable seeds as a symbolic gift , saying he hoped &quot; like these seeds , the seeds of peace and hope will keep growing in this city and the whole country. &quot; &quot; These dark days are almost over , &quot; Akashi told Tuzla and Sarajevo officials assembled on the airport tarmac in driving rain . He toured Tuzla ' s main hospital and a refugee reception center during his five-hour visit , praising the ethnically mixed city for its &quot; indomitable spirit &quot; amid conditions he described as subhuman . &quot; It will take some time , but already positive change is in the air and we will capitalize on that , &quot; Akashi promised . Times special correspondent Danica Kirka in Zagreb contributed to this report .</TEXT>
