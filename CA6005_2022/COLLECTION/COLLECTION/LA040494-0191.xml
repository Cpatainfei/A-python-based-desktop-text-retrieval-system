   <HEADLINE> PRACTICING FOR PARENTHOOD ; OK , SO HE WAS WRONG . A DOGGY DADDY DISCOVERS THAT HAVING PETS IS A LOT LIKE RAISING KIDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So it took my wife and me exactly one week after our honeymoon to participate in one of America ' s great newlywed rituals . We adopted a_couple_of puppies -- a 10-week-old female shepherd mix named Kasmir and an 8-week-old male German_shepherd named Iggy Pup . It ' s like this : A couple gets_married . They think they might want children , but it ' s a bit too soon . So why not ease into parenthood by practicing on other needy little nippers ? Before becoming a doggy daddy , I was skeptical of all this . Kids and dogs seemed to have very little in common . After all , kids are something you have ; dogs are something you own . Kids grow_up and make enough money to buy you stuff ; dogs grow_up and still expect you to pay_for their dinner . If you want a child , you have at least nine months to wait after you make your decision ; if you wake_up one morning and want a dog , you can have one in your home before dinner time . Taking_care of a puppy is also quite different from tending to your child . It may be necessary to bring_in a trainer to teach your pet some discipline . The idea of getting a trainer for your baby might not look so good to the neighbors . Meanwhile , it ' s OK to set a little wooden hut , a_couple_of rawhide bones and a big bowl of water in your back yard and leave your dog out there all day while you ' re at_work . This is a somewhat less socially -- and legally -- acceptable thing to do with your child . * Now that I am a proud puppy papa , my views have changed . All the above are still true , but they pale in comparison to the ways in which owning dogs really is a dry_run for having children . For example , judging from what I ' ve learned from friends who have become parents , having kids totally disrupts your daily routine . Life is no longer about &quot; me , &quot; it ' s about &quot; us. &quot; It ' s the same deal with dogs . Every night must be spent at_home bonding with the family_unit . Every day must be spent thinking_about getting home to bond with the family_unit . These days , it ' s matinee movies and takeout dinners . And even if we do go_out for an evening , it generally isn ' t much fun because we spend every minute wanting to call home and check on the dogs . Too_bad they have yet to learn how to answer the phone . Even when we ' re not home playing with the pups , we ' re talking_about them . Any conversation I have eventually comes_around to describing the cute faces they made when I scratched their bellies that morning or the horrors of housebreaking . Kind of like the way a new parent can ' t wait to tell you his or her child ' s first words or the first time the babe slept through the night . And you know the way new moms and dads seem to bond in the park on Saturday afternoon ? Well , being a dog owner similarly changes your social circle . The only difference is you stand_in a park for hours on a Saturday afternoon conversing freely about breeds and bowel_movements instead of preschools and bowel_movements . Then there ' s the way the pups slowly start turning you into your parents . Suddenly , you have to be the one dishing_out the very sort of discipline you hated to receive as a child . Lately I ' ve found myself telling the dogs such things as , &quot; Stop tracking mud into the house &quot; and &quot; No treats until you finish your dinner. &quot; As if they ' re going to listen to what I ' m saying . Adding_to the whole parent-child relationship is the sibling rivalry that has erupted between our dogs and the two cats , which have pretty much had the run of the house for years and aren ' t too happy to have a_couple_of stepdogs moving_in . Whenever they ' re in the house together , the dogs chase the cats . The cats slap at the dogs . A major ruckus ensues . Then they all come running to Daddy for protection from each other . I end_up scolding them all with some time-honored parental retort like , &quot; You wait until your mommy gets home ! &quot; It ' s frightening . Driving a paneled station_wagon and voting Republican can ' t be far behind . But at least now I sympathize_with friends who complain that being a parent has left them feeling tired all_the time . Dogs wear you out , not only physically but emotionally as well . As with a child , you become attached for life from the first_moment you clutch that warm little body to your chest . For better and for worse . In our case , it was the latter . Both dogs were taken from a pound , and little Iggy Pup acquired a bad cough there . Then he developed parvo , a virus that ate_away at his stomach lining . After four days in the hospital , he came_home only to contract an upper respiratory infection . * There were more vet visits , special diets and even a trip to a pet herbalist . We were willing to do anything to save our little guy . But just when he seemed to be_on the mend , he passed_away . This was less than a month after we ' d brought him into the family . On a calendar , that isn ' t much time to get_to know anyone or anything . In the heart , it was a lifetime . Since he died , I ' ve talked to people who can ' t understand why we ' d still be mourning the death of something that has now been dead for a longer period_of_time than we knew him . It ' s not like he was your kid , they say . But he was . Anything that requires your constant care and attention , that pays you back simply with a pair of happy eyes and unconditional devotion is your offspring . Losing that connection is something you never completely get_over . Of course , it ' s easier to deal with the loss of a dog . You can simply go_out and get a new one right away to fill_up that hole in your life . that ' s how we ended_up adopting Stax ( named for Otis Redding ' s record label ) , a beautiful and very healthy year-old vizsla . She ' s already stepped_in to become Daddy ' s new little_girl . Soon Stax and Kasmir ( named for the dog Mohammed allowed into Paradise ) will be all grown_up , and before we know it , they ' ll be off to obedience school . They ' ll prefer seeing their friends to hanging_out with us . They ' ll want to stay_up past their bedtime . And what do I say when our little_girls start bringing_home their new boyfriends , Pete the_Pit Bull and Ratso the Rottweiler , for Dad ' s approval ?</TEXT>
