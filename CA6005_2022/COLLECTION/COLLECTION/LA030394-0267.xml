   <HEADLINE> SUCCESSES ON BOSNIA BOOST U.S. FOREIGN_POLICY TEAM ; BALKANS : PRESIDENT CAN BOAST OF A NON-ECONOMIC INITIATIVE IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS . CHRISTOPHER IS SMILING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The praise heaped on the United States by officials from Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina as they signed a preliminary peace agreement Tuesday night was enough to bring a smile even to the usually dour face of Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher . After a year in which the news from Bosnia has come_in only two varieties -- bad and worse -- Christopher , President Clinton and their deputies suddenly can cite a string of successes . Moreover , for the first time , observers can point to something that can legitimately be called a Clinton_Administration plan for Bosnia -- Clinton ' s first non-economic initiative in foreign affairs in his 13 months in office . On most foreign_policy issues -- the Middle_East , Haiti , Somalia , Korea -- Clinton ' s team has basically continued policies of the George_Bush Administration or kept a careful distance . By contrast , the emerging Clinton approach to Bosnia -- cajoling the Bosnian government and Croatia into a working alliance while using North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization force to intimidate Serbian separatists -- marks a sharp departure from Bush ' s policy of not taking sides among the combatants in Bosnia ' s three-sided war . Clinton ' s initiative , which he launched last month after the deaths of 68 people in the bombing of an open-air_market in Sarajevo , could provide a valuable boost in the public perception of Clinton ' s foreign_policy team . But it also puts the Administration more directly on the spot in case anything goes_wrong . &quot; In our judgment , that ' s worth risking , &quot; an Administration official said . &quot; The effort in the next few weeks is going_to be critical. &quot; The Administration ' s efforts continued to draw praise from both Bosnians and Croats on Wednesday . At a news_conference , Bosnian Prime_Minister Haris Silajdzic complimented U.S. efforts and said American diplomats had pledged to &quot; remain committed to this . We welcome that commitment. &quot; As efforts now turn toward drawing the Serbs -- the third_party to the warfare -- into an agreement , Silajdzic said he expects Russian pressure will be needed to bring the Serbs to the table . He dismissed criticism that the agreement he and Croatian representatives signed Tuesday night is merely a piece_of_paper that cannot stop the bloodshed . &quot; All wars ended with a piece_of_paper and an agreement , &quot; Silajdzic said . &quot; A piece_of_paper can be very important. &quot; Still , he added , the de_facto alliance between his government and the Croats will provide greater leverage if the Serbs do not agree to talk . &quot; What happens if they attack ( is that ) we will have to defend ourselves , &quot; he said . Croatia ' s ambassador to Washington , Peter A . Sarcevic , echoed that sentiment . &quot; There is important international pressure &quot; on the Serbs now , he said . As a result , &quot; we can see that there are changes in their behavior. &quot; Testifying on Capitol_Hill , Christopher said he believes the agreement will help &quot; create a balance_of_power more likely , I think , to make the Serbs willing to negotiate seriously. &quot; Christopher plans to meet next week with Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V . Kozyrev in Vladivostok for talks that are expected to concentrate_on the next steps_in Bosnia . So far , the Administration and the Russians have loosely coordinated their actions , with Washington working_on the Muslim-led Bosnian government and the Croats while Moscow has cajoled the Serbs . If the effort to draw the Serbs into an agreement succeeds , the Administration will face two new political risks . First , Clinton has pledged that once an agreement is reached , the United States will provide troops for an international peacekeeping force . Gen . David Maddox , commander of U.S. forces in Europe , told reporters here Wednesday that he expects such a force to eventually consist_of between 20 # 000 and 30 # 000 soldiers . &quot; I ain ' t goin ' in with two squads , &quot; he said . &quot; We won ' t go_through that operation and not lose an American soldier. &quot; The prospect of American troops in the Balkans drew nervous comments from several senators Wednesday as Christopher testified on Capitol_Hill . The second area of risk involves money . Even as they signed the peace agreement Tuesday , the Bosnian and Croatian representatives talked_of the need for reconstruction aid -- a point that Croatian ambassador Sarcevic repeated . Much of the Muslim-Croatian fighting in central Bosnia has been caused by the destabilizing impact of tens of thousands of refugees fleeing hostilities elsewhere in the region , he said . To prevent the bloodshed from starting anew , &quot; a plan of economic recovery for this region &quot; is &quot; very important , crucial , &quot; he said . Given the unpopularity of all forms of foreign_aid , those demands could become difficult for the Administration if a peace agreement is reached . But for now those risks remain in the distance , and Administration officials have been concentrating_on how to build_on their recent successes . In the last three weeks : * A U.S.-instigated NATO ultimatum forced Bosnian Serb forces to withdraw or surrender their heavy_weapons around Sarajevo , bringing a relative peace to that capital city . * NATO planes shot down four Bosnian Serb aircraft , breaking the powerful inertia that had prevented the alliance from actually using military power in the conflict . * A U.S.-brokered set of negotiations resulted in the federation agreement between the Bosnian government and Bosnian Croat forces . * And Russian pressure caused the Serbs to agree to the opening of the airport in Tuzla , which will allow relief supplies to reach Bosnia ' s second-largest city . In the view of Administration planners , those events -- plus the overall fatigue of two years of fighting -- have brought all_the parties in the Bosnian conflict to_the_point at which they are willing to talk . After months of inconclusive warfare , there now is &quot; a remarkable convergence of interests &quot; that makes the time ripe for a settlement , an Administration official said . Faced with the idea of continued fighting , the official said , the Bosnians and Croats &quot; couldn ' t answer the question , ' For what ? ' &quot; * U.S. ACCUSED OF BIAS : A Bosnian Serb leader says U.S. can ' t mediate fairly . A11</TEXT>
