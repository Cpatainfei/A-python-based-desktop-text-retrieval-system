   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY ; FINANCIAL MARKETS FEAR THE CRISIS WILL HAVE SEVERE REPERCUSSIONS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Financial markets are bracing for what could be severe fallout from Orange County ' s bankruptcy filing and from Tuesday ' s first_step in the liquidation of the county ' s massive bond portfolio . Analysts said the scope of the crisis is so broad -- encompassing the municipal_bond market , the market for U.S._government securities and the mutual_fund industry -- that it presents a monumental challenge to Wall_Street and to federal and state regulators . &quot; This is going_to shake confidence in the entire bond market , &quot; said Richard Lehmann of the Bond Investors Assn . in Miami Lakes , Fla . &quot; Everybody is in shock , &quot; said one Southland muni bond trader . Moreover , the solution that markets often look_to in times of crisis -- for the Federal_Reserve_Board to quickly ease interest_rates , reducing strain on the financial system -- is not an option for the central_bank because of the economy ' s continued strength , experts say . Indeed , the Fed ' s decision to tighten credit this year for the first time since 1989 in_effect sowed the seeds of Orange County ' s financial disaster by driving all interest_rates higher and by narrowing the spread between short- and long-term rates . Orange County , which has used its $ 18.5-billion investment fund to bet heavily on lower interest_rates , is just the latest big investor to be ruined by the Fed ' s turnabout . But the list of losers has lengthened as the year has progressed , and Wall_Street ' s great fear is that the county ' s unraveling now will prompt new losses for a host of other teetering investors -- or bring_to light the heretofore hidden portfolio problems of other municipal investment funds . The only good news for Orange County and for other owners of longer-term bonds is that the bond market has been trying to rally over the past two weeks , pushing long-term interest_rates somewhat lower . The yield on 30-year Treasury_bonds slid to 7.87 % on Tuesday from 7.92 % on Monday , and down from 8.13 % two weeks ago . Whether that rally can continue , however , may depend_on investors ' response to the Orange County bankruptcy filing and to the potential for a new round of bond liquidations by institutional and individual investors . Here ' s what analysts are most concerned about : * U.S._government securities . Bonds issued by the Treasury and government_agencies such_as the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp . make_up the bulk of securities in the Orange County fund . If Wall_Street begins to fear that the fund will be liquidated -- dumping $ 18.5 billion in securities on the market -- other bond investors may attempt to sell ahead of the fund , driving interest_rates up again . Although $ 18.5 billion in bonds is relatively small given the multitrillion-dollar size of the government_bond market , it still is a formidable portfolio to digest , bond pros say . &quot; If the market perceives there ' s a lot more to come , the implication becomes a snowballing effect , &quot; said one major Southland bond investor . Worse , the county ' s bankruptcy comes at a time when many other big investors that had bet_on lower interest_rates also are throwing_in towel , liquidating bonds in the same two- to 10-year maturity range that comprises the bulk of the county fund ' s portfolio . Many of those investors , like the county , had borrowed using short-term loans to buy longer-term bonds . It was a profitable transaction while short-term interest_rates remained low in 1993 . But in 1994 , as short-term rates have moved ever higher , the cost of the loans has come_to exceed the yield earned on the longer-term bonds . Over the past two months the market yield on two-year Treasury_notes has soared nearly a full percentage_point , to about 7.5 % currently , in part because banks and other large investors have bailed_out of those securities . The problem for the U.S._government bond market is that &quot; we don ' t know where we are in the ( unwinding ) process , &quot; said Jim Grant , editor of Grant ' s Interest_Rate Observer newsletter in New York . &quot; The banks have been trying to get_out in front of the problem , but we don ' t know how much more short-term stuff is left to be sold. &quot; Although brokerage CS First Boston was able to unload $ 2 billion of Orange County ' s bonds in a surprise sale late Tuesday , analysts said the market ' s ability to digest those came_before investors fully understood where they were coming from , or that the county ' s bankruptcy was imminent . Of particular concern nationwide is whether other municipal investment funds , like the Orange County fund , have waited until now to acknowledge their bond market losses and troubles with complex &quot; derivative &quot; securities . &quot; It makes the market now wonder who else that we don ' t know about has one foot in bankruptcy , &quot; Lehmann said . * Municipal_bonds . Wall_Street is terrified that the county ' s bankruptcy , which had not been considered even a remote possibility as recently as last weekend , will so stun institutional and individual investors that many will seek to bail_out of any and all muni bonds -- even those far afield from Orange County and California . Although most analysts say that wholesale dumping of muni bonds would be illogical -- because most municipal_bond issuers are certain to come_out of this crisis without any financial difficulties -- that is unlikely to stop some fearful investors from selling . The muni bond market , like the U.S. Treasury_bond market , had been rallying in recent weeks , pushing yields lower . But some analysts said Tuesday that the rally could end for now , especially in California muni bond issues . The mutual_fund industry is especially concerned . Because the funds have become such important players in the muni bond market over the past five years , a slew of redemptions by fund shareholders could quickly slam the muni market and the funds , because portfolio managers may find there are few other big investors on which to unload bonds . Mutual_funds that own any Orange County bonds or related securities fear that they are particularly vulnerable to selling -- even if they own a relatively minuscule amount of the county ' s paper , and even if their bonds are covered by private insurance or other enhancements that will guarantee that interest payments are made . &quot; Just about everybody owns some of it , &quot; said one mutual_fund manager , referring to Orange County debt . And the managers stuck_with a public relations problem could include those managing short-term funds , such_as muni money_market funds , as well as those managing longer-term funds . But if investors sell_out of munis and perhaps out of longer-term U.S._government bonds , where would they put their money ? Many Wall Streeters expect a &quot; flight to quality &quot; -- meaning that investors will rush into very short-term U.S. Treasury securities , such_as three- and six-month T-bills . That could drive down yields on those securities . But many economists say that would not affect the Federal_Reserve_Board ' s stance on credit . The best the markets can hope for , experts say , is that the Fed will decide against any additional increases in short-term rates until the current crisis blows_over . But Philip Barach , a bond portfolio manager at Trust Co . of the West in Los Angeles , sounded a hopeful note late Tuesday , noting that peaks in interest_rates often occur around financial crises . &quot; This is usually when you see a market turn , &quot; Barach said , recalling the Latin_American debt crisis in the early 1980s and the stock_market crash in 1987 . Piling Up Debt America ' s local_governments have piled_up more_than $ 1.2 trillion in debt , an increase of more_than 250 % over the last 15 years . Orange County ' s financial crisis has raised doubts about the safety of municipal debt and the integrity of public finance .
