   <HEADLINE> ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER , HIT_MAN ; THE CRITICS HOWL , THE TICKETS SELL AND THE MAESTRO JUST KEEPS GOING ( AND GOING AND GOING ) .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> DID YOU NOT KNOW ABOUT THE horse ? &quot; Anthony Pye-Jeary is inquiring excitedly . &quot; His name is . . . is . . . Frank Rich . &quot; Frank Rich was , until recently , the New York Times ' lead drama_critic and the pundit who most bedeviled composer Andrew Lloyd Webber . Frank Rich is also a racehorse owned and christened by Lloyd Webber , a four-legged repository of his private revenge . Pye-Jeary chuckles . He ' s an old friend of Lloyd Webber and so is in on the Frank Rich joke , one part of which is that Lloyd Webber ' s mount is a gelding , it has been -- you know , ha ha -- desexed . The other part is that Frank Rich -- the horse -- had been running poorly until , as Pye-Jeary recounts , &quot; They put a tongue strap on him . They tied the tongue down . So Frank Rich runs_for the first time with a tongue strap . And wins ! Really , really ! This is true ! It sounds like a joke ! But he had his tongue strapped down and the horse won ! &quot; Pye-Jeary ' s rising glee attests to just how satisfying pay-back can be . To fathom his joyful hysteria , one must consider this : From the perspective of Lloyd Webber ' s crowd , Frank Rich -- the man -- is a pen-wielding bully who has been using wittily phrased insights to beat_up on their long-suffering chum for years . In 1988 , for example , Rich wrote that &quot; The Phantom of the Opera &quot; was &quot; a victory of dynamic stagecraft over musical kitsch. &quot; And just this past July , when Lloyd Webber ' s latest concoction , &quot; Sunset Boulevard , &quot; had its world_premiere in London , Rich complimented the composer on his &quot; surprisingly dark , jazz-accented &quot; music but suggested that Lloyd Webber and company go_back to the drawing board on everything else : &quot; Its creators have the time . . . to search for means other_than hydraulics to make their show lift off. &quot; And it ' s not as if Frank Rich has been alone in his scorn . Lloyd Webber is fair_game for the Fourth_Estate and , it seems , anyone else who cares to comment . Take &quot; Cats , &quot; for example . This Lloyd Webber revenue mill has become an equal-opportunity gag-line . It ' s big , it ' s bourgeois and it won ' t go_away . David Letterman can exploit it for yuks with the same ease that playwright Paul Rudnick did when he inserted a running goof on &quot; Cats &quot; in his off-Broadway hit &quot; Jeffrey. &quot; &quot; Have someone come_out in a cat suit , &quot; Rudnick says , and the next thing you know , &quot; there ' s this roar of laughter . This is very useful in a comedy. &quot; Of course , not all Lloyd Webber-bashing has such harmless intentions . Several years ago , Malcolm Williamson , the Master of the Queen ' s Music , explained to reporters how he assessed his countryman ' s mass appeal : Lloyd Webber ' s music is &quot; everywhere , &quot; he said , &quot; but then so is AIDS. &quot; For his part , Lloyd Webber doesn ' t tell Frank Rich stories -- not about the man and not about the horse . Indeed , with his accumulation of successes , he shouldn ' t have to care what any critic thinks . Lloyd Webber ' s 11 productions include best-sellers like his first hit , &quot; Jesus_Christ Superstar , &quot; in 1971 , &quot; Evita , &quot; &quot; Cats &quot; and &quot; The Phantom of the Opera &quot; -- the last two alone have been worth $ 3.5 billion worldwide . Now comes &quot; Sunset Boulevard , &quot; which set advance-sales records in London and has been selling_out the Shubert Theatre in Century City since its American premiere there last month . Among his many believe-it-or-not career statistics is the fact that on this very night , tickets will be available for a sanctioned Lloyd Webber production at 37 different locations on our planet . In London ' s West_End , six Lloyd Webber shows are running concurrently ; on Broadway , three . Nevertheless , today , sitting in the cool shade of the stone veranda at his rented Beverly Hills estate , Lloyd Webber is talking ( and talking and talking ) about his critical notices . &quot; As an artist , I ' ll always pick_up something if I feel it is constructive. &quot; Lloyd Webber ' s distinctive delivery combines plummy English diction with sentences that conclude in a mumble . &quot; I mean , what you should be reading is , ' This is a really interesting direction . I wish there was more of it. ' that ' s what criticism should be about. &quot; He utters this last statement as if he truly believes it ' s the job of reviewers everywhere to assist in the refinement of an Andrew Lloyd Webber production . When he ' s relaxed , Lloyd Webber can be a self-deprecating charmer . When he ' s uncomfortable , he ' s a bundle of nervous tics , given to bouts of head-bobbing , foot waggling , stomach rubbing or hiccuping . On this afternoon , this is how his anxiety is expressing itself : Into his mouth goes the tip of his thumb , which is milky white , very clean and well-manicured . Later , he briefly licks his middle_finger , his index_finger , then his pinky . Nothing on Lloyd Webber ' s face indicates that he ' s aware of performing these small ablutions . And all_the while , he is politely holding forth about his detractors , about their pretense and their pack mentality . He seems to take_pride in always having run against the elitist grain . Even when he was a dweeby teen , he ' d boldly defend Victorian paintings and Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals to his stuffy headmasters . &quot; They were always considered sentimental rubbish , &quot; says Lloyd Webber , who happens to own one of the world ' s most valuable Pre-Raphaelite art_collections . It ' s in this spirit that Lloyd Webber hears his work dismissed as hopeless schlock and reconfigures the assaults into a badge of honor : &quot; I ' m the least politically correct composer in the world , &quot; he declares . &quot; I am . &quot; The bad rap he gets , he theorizes , comes from the spontaneity of his creative process . So_much of his work &quot; has been done_in public , &quot; he says , that people think it just materializes &quot; without , um , the pain of creation that really , um , has to go on. &quot; ( His no-sweat reputation might also come from his own past admissions that &quot; Evita &quot; was re-orchestrated during previews and that he dashed_off a 35-minute musical called &quot; Cricket &quot; in three days. ) &quot; It ' s been very easy to have a go at my music , &quot; he admits weakly . &quot; I ' ve been , uh , very lucky and very popular . And I think people don ' t always realize just how much you try and put into everything . I mean , to the best of your ability. &quot; Glancing at his watch , Lloyd Webber regretfully excuses himself . It ' s several weeks before &quot; Sunset Boulevard &quot; will open in Los Angeles and he must dash_off , with his driver , on one of his myriad rounds . Just as he readies himself to leave , he furtively moistens a forefinger . And for some reason , one half expects Lloyd Webber to hoist his glistening digit into the warm California air to see in which direction the wind is blowing . VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE NEWS MEDIA ARE SQUISHED THREE DEEP against a dingy wall_in a Hollywood rehearsal hall . Four feet away , and too close for comfort , what looks_like the entire &quot; Sunset &quot; chorus_line is vocalizing and briskly hitting its marks . The numbers are adroitly executed but one can ' t help noting that some of the ensemble members are tossing panicky smiles over their shoulders . Who would n ' t get the jitters , performing without the security of a proscenium , just blasting away like a giant singing telegram , in the faces of the gawking press ? And where are the big stars in this musicalized remake of the Billy Wilder film classic ? Where is Glenn Close , who will play Norma Desmond ? Or George Hearn , who plays Desmond ' s gloss-topped driver Max ? It is later explained that Close wasn ' t &quot; ready &quot; for this mini-preview ; nobody ever mentioned where Hearn was hiding out . The event bumps along awkwardly , perhaps because of its quaking but determined host . Lloyd Webber ' s quick brown eyes never really meet anyone ' s gaze . The best he can do is stand alongside a baby_grand piano , rocking back and forth , his hands twitching nervously at his hips , while silently mouthing love ballad lyrics that two cast members are singing . He is nothing if not 100 % invested in his work . &quot; I worry about the content of my shows , &quot; he confesses , &quot; to_the_point that I think_about them all_the time . &quot; He frets so_much over his vast network of productions that it drives him to make spot-check visitations to any city on the map where a show of his is playing . Just to make_sure everything is running in tip-top shape , he ' ll -- surprise ! -- appear unexpectedly and frighten everyone right out of their Flexatards . As a case_in_point , he has visited the Las Vegas production of &quot; Starlight Express &quot; four times , even though , having licensed the rights away , he isn ' t even involved in it . With &quot; Sunset Boulevard , &quot; Lloyd Webber ' s perfectionist bent has been greatly tested . Every news clip on the making of the London production included documentation of all that went awry . First there was the malfunctioning main set , a high-tech 18-ton prop that would , without human provocation and rarely on cue , shift forward or rise toward the rafters like the Starship Enterprise , occasionally with startled stagehands on board . Then the reviews rolled in , and like Frank Rich , most of the critics gave with one hand and took with the other . Almost immediately , Lloyd Webber began to institute endless alterations for the Los Angeles opening . He fiddled not just with the score ( which he &quot; very arrogantly &quot; calls &quot; my best &quot; ) , but also with every detail imaginable . The London reviews found the stage characters lacking all chemistry , when the film was all about the creepiness of a sordid love triangle formed by a fading film_star , her paid honey-boy and his girlfriend . So Lloyd Webber , with Christopher Hampton and Don Black , who worked together on the book and lyrics , came_up with hundreds of minute script adjustments . The notices had also said the tunes were agreeably hummable , but where was a showstopper like &quot; Memory &quot; or &quot; The Music of the Night &quot; from &quot; Cats &quot; and &quot; Phantom &quot; ? Lloyd Webber added a zotzy number &quot; Every Movie ' s a Circus &quot; -- &quot; for the younger people. &quot; John_Napier ' s gilt-splashed set was dazzling , according to the papers , but inappropriately glitzy . In Los Angeles , Norma Desmond ' s shut-in environment became more claustrophobic . Lloyd Webber indulged his own second-chance desires as well . He can barely contain himself when describing the incorporation of some of his trademark flash -- a reproduction of an antique touring_car -- into the L.A. action . It was Billy Wilder ' s idea ( Wilder has been serving as the Lloyd Webber team ' s unpaid oracle ) . &quot; I mean , we physically couldn ' t ( include the automobile ) in London , &quot; says Lloyd Webber peppily , &quot; but we ' ve found a way ( in Los Angeles ) that we can . We ' re going to do_it . It ' s going_to happen ! The old car will be there ! &quot; But most of Lloyd Webber ' s uncapped fix-it enthusiasm was devoted to the casting . In London , the press corps found the square-shouldered belter Patti LuPone too invincible to capture Norma Desmond ' s cracked fragility . So Lloyd Webber tapped five-time Academy Award-nominated actress Glenn Close as the pivotal female lead . She is a Serious Actress , so she fits into Lloyd Webber ' s time-honored formula of gilding fluff with substance . And she is also a movie_star , which usually has sure-thing drawing power . Weeks later , when the revamped &quot; Sunset &quot; opens , Lloyd Webber ' s new casting pays_off . For the most part the critics coo over Close . &quot; Stunning , &quot; says The Times ' Sylvie Drake , and -- miracle of miracles -- the New York Times , in the form of Vincent Canby , raves : &quot; Ms . Close ' s performance is ravishing &quot; on its way to delivering a glowing thumbs-up . Time , USA Today and radio and TV also hand_out mostly positive notices . Even so , there is plenty of Lloyd Webber blood drawn . &quot; Grandiose camp , flashy but surprisingly dull , &quot; says David Ansen in Newsweek . &quot; More confident . . . but no better , &quot; complains Daily Variety . &quot; Wildly overblown , &quot; admits Drake . And the disparaging rumbling never quite dies_down . The word , at one point , is that Close , singing at the edge of her range , won ' t hold_up to eight larnyx-punishing shows a week : Broadway trouper Betty Buckley , they say , has already been placed on 24-hour red alert . ( &quot; This absolutely isn ' t true , &quot; insists Lloyd Webber ' s media consultant , Peter Brown. ) Tongue-waggers point_out that the double-CD cast album has so far loitered drowsily on the racks . ( An L.A. cast album may be in the offing. ) Some even predict that &quot; Sunset &quot; will never make_it to the Great White Way : New York audiences are notoriously picky , thus the risk-factor of staging such a pricey show is greater there . Certainly all_of this chit-chat might yet come true . On the other hand , it might just be more of the flop-lust that grows stronger with the birth of each new Andrew Lloyd Webber production . Back in 1974 , he came_out with an effort called &quot; Jeeves , &quot; which even Lloyd Webber says was &quot; a complete disaster &quot; and &quot; catastrophically received. &quot; But it didn ' t sidetrack his campaign toward world domination -- the source of so_much of what irritates the legions of Sir Andrew bashers . What they all seem to wish most for him is a huge bomb , the kind of failure that could bring the Lloyd Webber machine to a grinding halt . IN ENGLAND , LLOYD WEBBER ' S HEADQUARTERS IS A 10-BEDROOM , SIX-STORY townhouse in London ' s exclusive Belgravia district ( not to be confused with his English country mansion , his villa in the south of France or his Trump Tower apartment in New York ) . When he is there , he can find no peace . The switchboard blinks constantly . Even in the upholstered depths of his chauffeur-driven , midnight blue Mercedes 600 SEL with the VCR , satellite-informed traffic monitor and fully stocked fridge , there is a back-seat car phone to distract him . Life must have been simpler for Lloyd Webber when he was a newly minted phenomenon . Back then , he had his first partner , Tim Rice , in his corner , towering protectively over him , sharing the burdens . When the two aspiring songwriters met , in 1965 , the 17-year-old Lloyd Webber was so sure of their future together that he dropped his history studies at Oxford and moved Rice into his family ' s South Kensington flat . By that point , Lloyd Webber had already composed eight musicals . It was a family thing -- his father , William Lloyd Webber , was a skilled pianist who eventually became the director of the London College of Music ; his mother , Jean , was a piano_teacher and his brother , Julian , is a cellist . Bill Lloyd Webber had gotten Andrew ' s first creation , &quot; The Toy Theatre Suite , &quot; published when he was 9 . Apparently this was a rare display of fatherly support : According to Michael Walsh ' s coffee-table Lloyd Webber biography , when young Andrew informed his dad of his professional intentions , he merely grumbled back , &quot; If you ever write a song as_good_as ' Some Enchanted Evening , ' I ' ll tell you. ' &quot; After a_few false starts , Rice and Lloyd Webber turned &quot; The Wonder Book of Bible Stories &quot; into &quot; Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat , &quot; first produced in 1968 . Big-time success came_with &quot; Jesus_Christ Superstar. &quot; &quot; Superstar &quot; rode the rock-opera trend and introduced Lloyd Webber ' s sack of tricks -- catchy pop songs , broad-stroke dramatic arcs , open-throated arias and , later , special_effects . From the onset , what Lloyd Webber has delivered is entertainment designed to overwhelm . His musicals guarantee not just jaw-dropping staging , but crescendo after string-filled crescendo as the heart-swelling backdrop to an easily readable story line . And Lloyd Webber hammers the hooks home , making_it impossible for theatergoers to walk_out onto the street without at least one melody stuck_in their heads . In other words , Lloyd Webber treats his customers as if their enjoyment meant more to him than anything . The package took American musical_theater by surprise . &quot; In a way , everyone writing_on Broadway was so aware of the back catalogue they couldn ' t crawl out from under it , &quot; explains Mark Steyn , musical_theater correspondent for the Independent in London . &quot; They knew too_much . Andrew and Tim were so ignorant of it they could more or less get_away with anything . They managed to do what Broadway failed to do , which was to keep faith with the pop quality that American musicals always had 50 or 60 years ago. &quot; In the early ' 70s , Lloyd Webber liked to mention publicly that his and Rice ' s names would soon be inextricably linked , &quot; like Rodgers and Hart. &quot; But , in fact , Lloyd Webber seemed to get an adrenaline charge from attempting to prove that Rice was dispensable . In 1974 , the ill-fated &quot; Jeeves &quot; was his first Rice-less venture . They temporarily reconciled for &quot; Evita , &quot; which was one of Rice ' s ideas , then Lloyd Webber tried_out other lyricists to medium-cool results . Finally , along came &quot; Cats , &quot; Lloyd Webber ' s first genuine post-Rice triumph . To launch the production , based on T.S. Eliot ' s &quot; Old Possum ' s Book of Practical Cats , &quot; he mortgaged one of his houses and withstood the belly_laughs his concept got_on both sides of the ocean . He says he was snubbed by every major American choreographer : &quot; Twyla Tharp said it was not possible . Bob Fosse said no way. &quot; After that , the Rice-Lloyd Webber team tried several short-lived reunions . There was &quot; Cricket &quot; in 1986 , their gift to Queen Elizabeth on her 60th birthday . ( Later , Lloyd Webber shanghaied several tunes from &quot; Cricket &quot; for &quot; Aspects of Love , &quot; which rendered Rice ' s lyrics worthless and ensured that the piece would never be produced again. ) Their relationship now seems to exist only contractually , through shared credit and royalties on &quot; Joseph , &quot; &quot; Superstar &quot; and &quot; Evita. &quot; Rice has moved_on to Disney , writing pretty lyrics for animated features like &quot; Aladdin. &quot; When asked to comment on his ex-partner , Rice merely sighs and offers_up this freighted remark : &quot; It ' s not my dream way of spending an hour , talking_about Andrew. &quot; So now Lloyd Webber goes it alone -- not counting , of course , his phalanx of gentle publicists , assistants and assorted suits . He commissions the lyricists he wants to work with and he retains the final say-so over what they write . He has a hand in casting every touring group . And Lloyd Webber is also the near-absolute ruler of his jumbo business-side fiefdom , the Really Useful Group . In the ' 80s , Lloyd Webber took the Really Useful Group public ; but by 1990 , dismayed over having to please stockholders and market forces instead of just himself , he was determinedly buying back stock . It was a financially bruising proposition . A year later , he bartered off one-third of the newly privatized RUG to PolyGram , the_British entertainment mega-corporation , for roughly $ 130 million . The London press called it a &quot; sweetheart deal &quot; -- a top-of-the-market sale that took him out of debt , kept him in the majority position and put all those precious creative details squarely back into his own well-manicured hands . These days , his staff says , he ' s worth in the neighborhood of $ 450 million . His friends brag about his entrepreneurial craftiness ; his critics are not so sanguine . Lloyd Webber ' s far-flung productions , says the Independent ' s Steyn , are the theatrical equivalent of fast food . &quot; McDonald ' s can maybe introduce one new item every two years because they ' re so busy ensuring that a Big Mac tastes exactly the same in Reykjavik as it does_in Kuala Lumpur . But they can ' t be as inventive and fresh as they might be , and that ' s a similar thing with Andrew , &quot; Steyn says . &quot; This is musical_theater on a scale undreamt_of by anyone before -- identical productions in every major town in the world . It sounds like a nightmare and it is a nightmare , because it ' s boring . You get_off the plane and go , ' Well , here I am in Budapest -- what ' s there to see ? ' And there ' s ' Evita ' and ' Cats. ' But in sheer business terms , you ' ve got_to give him credit. &quot; David Mason , his pal and appointed art acquirer , says Lloyd Webber is famous for calculating the angles on everything . &quot; He ' s got an animal instinct , &quot; he says . &quot; He ' s like Rasputin . Shrewd isn ' t the word for it. &quot; Ask Lloyd Webber ' s intimates for some_other descriptors and they ' ll paint the affectionate portrait of a man who must make_for a complicated buddy . At one moment , he is the instigator of no-sleep trips , city-hopping with his wife , Madeleine , and various cohorts in his chartered 12-seater jet . At the next moment , he is the lover of baroque practical_jokes , the type that are hysterical to those in the know and not as funny to those on the receiving end . He is at his most beguiling , they say , when sharing his most recent score , hunched_over a piano , swaying to the chordal progressions and narrating the scenario to a one-person audience . Then there are his bleaker traits : The downside of being a king-hell businessman is incorrigible competitiveness , everyday stinginess and a potentate ' s ability to desert longtime compatriots without so_much as an explanation . In December press_conferences , Lloyd Webber said he was baffled -- baffled ! -- by rumors that he was displeased with Patti LuPone ' s Norma . ( LuPone was his megastar in &quot; Evita. &quot; ) Out of the TV lights , however , he edges a little closer to poison . Glenn Close , he says , &quot; is a joy and fun to work with . Which I must say is a change from , shall we say , another Norma we ' ve had. &quot; Later , when reminded of this not-so-subtle dig , Lloyd Webber angrily recants : &quot; I will be cross with you , &quot; he says , pale-faced and just this side of supremely ticked-off , &quot; if you don ' t quote me properly on this . I ' m a great admirer of Patti ' s ; she ' s a superb performer . But what she must do is to understand not to be threatened . Patti just needs to just relax a bit . that ' s all . And not worry. &quot; That said , his frail shoulders relax , and just as swiftly as his barely bottled rage bloomed , it dissipates . His temper tantrums are legendary , and his friends claim the best prescription for them is to start creeping toward the exits . It is Gillian Lynne , who choreographed &quot; Cats , &quot; &quot; Phantom &quot; and &quot; Aspects , &quot; who suggests that it ' s in the aftermath of his vitriolic explosions that the essential Lloyd Webber makes a rare cameo appearance . This she learned from a &quot; Cats &quot; -in-progress confrontation , where a scarlet-faced Lloyd Webber furiously informed Lynne that her work was so dreadful that he was withdrawing his score . It was their first collaboration , and Lynne didn ' t know that he &quot; sort of does this once a show. &quot; Lynne sassed him back -- &quot; If Jerry Robbins can do a ballet without music , so can I &quot; -- and then retreated to her dressing room to await her pink_slip . But when summoned back to the stage , Lynne discovered that it wasn ' t her head that Lloyd Webber wanted , but a conciliatory bearhug from his Gilly . In the deserted theater stalls , Lynne found him &quot; sitting and looking miserable . He put his arms around me and said , ' It will be all_right , won ' t it ? ' &quot; &quot; ARE YOU LISTENING ? &quot; PETER BROWN WANTS TO KNOW . Brown is Lloyd Webber ' s friend of 23 years , as well as his media consultant . He is standing_in the green-carpeted study of Lloyd Webber ' s temporarily roofless 16th-Century country mansion , Sydmonton Court , in Berkshire , England . Lloyd Webber is off in Holland , attending the opening of yet another &quot; Phantom , &quot; so Brown has arranged for some quality time with just the house . Despite the owner ' s absence , the place is filled with distractions . Right next to the front_door is a freshly grouted indoor jacuzzi that looks big enough to accommodate the bewhiskered cast of &quot; Cats. &quot; On the periphery of the missing roof , there are muddy-booted workmen replacing the Victorian blue tile . Deep within the dark corridors , where the walls are decorated busily with gothic stars and angels , there are rosy-cheeked maids vacuuming their way through an off-season spring cleaning . Every window_frames yet another grassy perspective of this 4 # 000-acre-plus estate , and as far as you can see , every element on the landscape -- the bare-limbed cedar and ash_trees , the fat grazing sheep , the husk-beige cornfields -- is the property of Lloyd Webber . So is the nearby stone church where the annual Sydmonton Festival is staged : Every summer , in this damp little space , Lloyd Webber likes to consumer-test his work_on a house packed with urban swells and locals . On the roster for this year ' s 20th anniversary festival is the return of &quot; Jeeves , &quot; which Lloyd Webber , in his compulsive mender-of-botched-projects way , has expressed the urge to &quot; have another go at. &quot; The tour covers a maze of showcase chambers , such_as the formal dining_room with a mahogany table that seats 36 . It also reveals many signs that a family actually lives here . From the look of things , the oversized kitchen and a tatty-looking television nook are the central hangouts ; the claw-footed furniture has comfortably dented cushions . Propped_up on every available surface are photographs of the clan , Andrew and Madeleine , his 31-year-old third wife , smiling their tentative smiles , and the distinctly Lloyd-Webberish-looking offspring -- Imogen , 16 , and Nicholas , 14 , from the first marriage , and Alistair , 18 months , and William , 4 months , from the third . But tabloid readers who ' ve tracked Lloyd Webber ' s love life would instantly be captivated by the group shots , specifically the ones that include Sarah Tudor Hugill , Lloyd Webber ' s first wife , or his Eliza Doolittle second spouse , Sarah Brightman , the ingenue whose voice inspired &quot; Phantom. &quot; It ' s often been said that what horsewoman Madeleine Lloyd Webber brings_to her power-marriage is the calming effect her presence has_on her husband . ( &quot; He was far more thermonuclear pre-Madeleine , &quot; says a friend. ) And while Lloyd Webber is still an insecure mixer , you ' d never know it from reports that during weekends and holidays Sydmonton ' s guest rooms are routinely filled with happy visitors . A proliferation of celebrity snapshots , like the one of Madeleine with former President Ronald Reagan and wife Nancy , sit on Sydmonton ' s drawing room mantlepiece . But what gets top_billing among the objects on display here is Lloyd Webber ' s invaluable Pre-Raphaelite art_collection . His interest in art began while gazing at the 19th-Century stained glass that surrounded him as a student at London ' s Westminster School . From there , he drifted to the Pre-Raphs , which he decided to start purchasing because , as he blushingly admits , &quot; they were so cheap. &quot; When he made his first acquisition , the Victorians were so far out of favor that a Rossetti drawing cost him only 15 pounds . Since then , he ' s snapped_up so many masterworks that they form a thick racing stripe of gold-framed paintings that runs_through almost every room at Sydmonton . Everywhere , there are pieces by artists such_as Burne-Jones , Brett , Hughes and Leighton . In the drawing room is his latest prize , Rossetti ' s &quot; A Vision of Fiametta , &quot; a full-length portrait of a pale-skinned , red-haired beauty over whose head circles the Angel of Death . It cost a reported $ 4.5 million . His most expensive painting -- $ 17.7 million -- is not a Pre-Raphaelite , but an 18th-Century Canaletto , &quot; The Horse Guard ' s Parade. &quot; He bought the painting because he found it &quot; a thumpingly good picture. &quot; And these are just a fraction of what he adoringly refers to en masse as &quot; the love of my life. &quot; The following afternoon , Lloyd Webber , back from Holland , is chatting amiably in a clangorous Picadilly restaurant about his future agenda . He is ready to dive back into movie-making , even though his lucky streak with film adaptations began and ended in 1973 with Norman Jewison ' s antic &quot; Jesus_Christ Superstar &quot; ( which Lloyd Webber had no real ties to and didn ' t much care_for ) . As usual , Lloyd Webber plans &quot; to be involved with everything artistically. &quot; But he also readily admits that he doesn ' t &quot; know anything about films at all. &quot; ( In just a_few weeks , word comes_down that he has chosen Gary Lucchesi , who most recently was head of production at Paramount Pictures , to serve as his show-biz teacher and Hollywood point man. ) Still , he enthusiastically ticks_off the projects in the works : PolyGram is developing a feature version of &quot; Aspects of Love , &quot; possibly with John Schlesinger as director ; Warner Bros . is ready to cash_in_on &quot; Phantom &quot; groupies ; &quot; Evita &quot; is an on-again , off-again Oliver Stone / Disney project . ( At press time , Disney announced that it is definitely back on. ) And Lloyd Webber also has hired British playwright Tom Stoppard to write a screen version of &quot; Cats. &quot; T.S. Eliot ' s creation , he says , will become a &quot; dark &quot; full-length animated feature . He also shares the story of a recent meeting with Sarah Brightman , his second wife . ( Their marriage was a scandal -- when their affair started , she was a wild-haired chorine in &quot; Cats. &quot; He was still wed to Sarah Tudor Hugill , whom he had met at an Oxford party. ) Though their messy divorce after six years of marriage filled the_British gossip rags , the two remain so friendly that Lloyd Webber has decided to produce an album of her warbling rock versions of his songs . So , in Amsterdam , they met for lunch right under the noses , he says , of neglectful paparazzi . &quot; In theory , &quot; he insists , &quot; that would have been one of the great pictures of all time , &quot; and , because he is an inveterate businessman , you can almost see him toting_up photographers ' lost income . He adds one more element to the Lloyd Webber agenda -- an expanding art_collection . He heads the Andrew Lloyd Webber Art Foundation , a charitable organization that purchases artworks intended for public exhibition in Britain and , he hopes , at the museum he would like to construct at Sydmonton . It would be in a modern building , he says , that could also house the theater for the annual festival . &quot; You can ' t open the family house to the public , &quot; he explains . &quot; It ' s not that big . Also , people would probably be coming for the wrong reasons anyway. &quot; In the meantime , Lloyd Webber is making moves to expand his personal collection , looking_away from the Victorians and at early Picassos and Medieval paintings . For all_the injurious wisecracks he hears about everything else he attempts , few question the breadth and importance of his art_collection . And perhaps with the foundation and the museum , Lloyd Webber envisions himself , finally , being swept toward unqualified respect from the aesthetes . When he is asked which he values more -- his art or his music -- he says , with obvious passion , that he loves his art , but his &quot; music has got_to be first. &quot; But not long ago , David Mason , Lloyd Webber ' s art_dealer , posed to him the very same question . The collection , he answered , is &quot; the most important thing in my life. &quot; &quot; Nonsense , &quot; returned Mason , &quot; your music must be the most important thing. &quot; &quot; No , &quot; Lloyd Webber assured him . &quot; One day , you ' ll see . The music is the means to an end , and the end is my art collection. &quot; AT THE THURSDAY NIGHT American premiere of &quot; Sunset , &quot; the early returns are definitely favorable . To begin with , the gala actually is , well , fun . In London , the expected horde of above-the-title celebrities never materialized , but in Los Angeles , Lloyd Webber has pulled_in old-time Hollywood royalty : Ronald and Nancy Reagan , Lana Turner , Angela Lansbury , Carol Channing . So what if Sarah Brightman , drifting languidly up the long red_carpet to the Shubert ' s entrance , gets a much bigger_hand than her tuxedoed ex-spouse ? By the closing notes of the first number , the audience is already applauding ( which will be repeated after nearly every song ) -- and the set gets the expected oohs and aahs . But during intermission , the lobby buzz starts to rub a bit of the shine off the evening : &quot; Well , &quot; remarks one grim-looking fan , &quot; it ' s not as bad as I thought it would be. &quot; As the reviews trickled in over the next few days , Lloyd Webber had this comfort : Frank Rich -- the man -- wasn ' t there to kick him around anymore . Not that there is much question what Rich might have said , if he ' d had the chance . As Peter Brown has advised his client , &quot; He doesn ' t like what you do . He doesn ' t like what you ' ve done to the American theater . Therefore he is never going_to like anything you do . Why don ' t you just let_it_go ? &quot; Forty-eight hours after the Los Angeles &quot; Sunset &quot; debut , Lloyd Webber seems to have taken his old friend ' s emotional advice and run with it . His butler , Isaac , moves quietly through the Beverly Hills rental , organizing his employer ' s imminent departure . Madeleine , dressed in blue leggings and a thick sweater , waves hello as she dashes upstairs . Outside , a cold , hard rain splashes down , and Lloyd Webber , sitting on an overstuffed floral couch , professes total contentment . No matter that most of the reviews are decidedly mixed -- Lloyd Webber wants to accentuate the positive . The score overall , he says , is &quot; certainly an eight or a nine out of 10. &quot; &quot; I ' m done , &quot; Lloyd Webber says with finality -- &quot; Sunset &quot; is complete . In a_few hours , he and his family will board their private jet to return to England and , after a rest , his next move will be to decide what exactly will happen next with his rejiggered &quot; Sunset. &quot; How can he incorporate the changes in London ? Will the next version end_up in New York ? &quot; We ' re looking_at all_of the theaters in the United States which could take it , &quot; he says . And if that location happens not to be Broadway , he hastens to add , it ' s &quot; not because we don ' t want to go_to New York , it ' s because we can ' t find the theater in which to put it. &quot; Nearby , on a long , low coffee_table , an immense arrangement of white_lilies is turning brown at the edges and starting to droop . Whenever he falls_back into contemplation , Lloyd Webber looks a little worse for the wear as well . The post-curtain partying on Thursday night went_on and on , with 20 of his closest friends ( some of whom he had flown in from England ) , staying until 5 a.m. And occasionally , his face crumples completely -- his mother died just days before &quot; Sunset &quot; opened after a long illness , having given orders that no one upset their plans in the event . Mostly , however , Lloyd Webber remembers to smile . He indulges in just one minor nervous gesture , tugging repeatedly at the bottom of his nose . And he comes_back again and again to the &quot; reviewers &quot; who almost never let him down -- his fans . The day after the opening , they were out_in force . &quot; We took ( in ) more_than half a_million dollars . that ' s unbelievable . And I ' ve just been told that there ' s a queue around the corner at the Shubert -- with umbrellas and everything. &quot; He perches himself right at the edge of the cushy sofa . &quot; I would say it ' s a much better set of reviews than I ' ve ever had , &quot; he says one more time . &quot; We could put_together , really , the best quote-ad of any musical I ' ve ever done. &quot; And then his fingers move upward , grab his nostrils , and tug .</TEXT>
