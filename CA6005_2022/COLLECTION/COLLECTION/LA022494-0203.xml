   <HEADLINE> FROM JUDGE TO DEFENDANT ; CAREER IS THREATENED BY FATAL ACCIDENT THAT WENT UNREPORTED FOR 4 HOURS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Albert Garcia was an East Los Angeles success story . He was raised in poverty by a single mother , worked his way through college and then law_school and eventually was named a Municipal Court judge in Compton where he quickly earned a reputation for courtesy and impartiality . But his saga of success was derailed Monday night on an Eagle Rock side street . He totaled his Mercedes-Benz , leaving his passenger dead -- a 35-year-old woman who had told friends she hoped Garcia would divorce his wife and marry her . Garcia wandered away from the accident and waited four hours to turn himself in . He was then booked on charges of suspected vehicular manslaughter and drunk driving . Josie Smith , 35 , died at the scene of the accident and leaves three children , ages 7 , 12 and 14 . She co-managed a popular Highland Park restaurant , founded by her parents 30 years ago , which has been deluged with condolence calls all week . &quot; The customers all loved her because she was so bubbly and full_of_life . . . . If anybody was ever down she would tell a joke and make them laugh , &quot; said her sister , Angie Montes . &quot; Her downfall was picking the wrong kind of man. &quot; Garcia ' s once promising career is now in_question . On Wednesday , he requested two weeks leave , but it is not clear if and when he will be returning to the bench . He began seeing Smith about two years ago , Garcia ' s friends say , when he was separated from his wife . After he tried to break_up with Smith last summer , there was a fight in his chambers and Garcia called court security to have her removed . Smith later told Compton police that Garcia had assaulted her . According to the police report , the two had a stormy lunch at a San Pedro restaurant . They ordered seven glasses of wine and , after an argument , each tossed a drink_in the other ' s face . They then returned to the judge ' s chambers and , according to the report , &quot; had an argument over victim ' s past relationship with a Los Angeles police_officer , which produced a daughter . . . . Victim said Judge Garcia pushed her against book shelves . . . grabbed her by the throat , putting fingers in her mouth and said : ' You ' re messing with the wrong person. ' &quot; After Compton police filed the report , Smith dropped her complaint and prosecutors refused to file charges , Lt . Joe Flores said . &quot; I told her she should file charges against him , and she agreed but later changed her mind , &quot; Montes said . &quot; She ' d say : ' I can ' t do that to his career . It would ruin him. ' She just cared_for him too much. &quot; The two ended_up reconciling and had been seeing each other steadily since the incident , her sister said . But the relationship continued to be tumultuous , Montes said . &quot; I had no respect for the man , &quot; said Montes , who co-managed the El Arco Iris restaurant with her sister . &quot; He didn ' t respect his wife . He didn ' t respect my sister . He didn ' t respect himself. &quot; But attorneys were impressed with Garcia because of his conscientious approach , said Craig Hum , a deputy district_attorney who has argued a number of cases before Garcia . Hum thought so highly of the judge that he asked Garcia to swear him in after he passed the Hawaii Bar exam . Hum was extremely surprised when he heard that the judge had been involved in an altercation with a woman in his chambers last August . &quot; He was incredibly fair . . . that ' s what I was impressed with , &quot; Hum said . Garcia rarely missed civic functions or social_gatherings with the South Central Bar Assn. , friends said . But Garcia , who presided over criminal preliminary hearings and has been a judge in Compton for seven years , always appeared alone . If Garcia ' s case reaches the stage of a preliminary hearing and he is charged with a felony , he will be suspended , without loss of salary , while the case is pending , according to officials at the state Commission on Judicial Performance . If he is convicted and the conviction stands under appeal , Garcia will be removed from the bench . The night of the accident , Garcia and Smith had dinner and drinks at a Pasadena restaurant , Montes said , and were probably on their way back to Smith ' s apartment . Montes plans to raise Smith ' s two older children and the younger one will live with her father . Garcia left the accident scene and waited so_long before contacting police because &quot; he went_into shock . . . he was totally out of it , &quot; said his attorney , Robin J . Yanes . &quot; He saw her lying_in the street and her head was in pieces . . . it was a horrendous scene , &quot; Yanes said . &quot; He went_into a state of shock and just wandered off. &quot; After about an hour , Garcia called a friend from a phone_booth but was incoherent and &quot; could only say : ' Help me , ' over and over , &quot; Yanes said . The friend &quot; got_out of him what happened &quot; and they went_to the LAPD ' s Northeast station , where Garcia turned himself in . Garcia , who grew_up in East Los Angeles , was raised by his mother , who worked two jobs as a domestic and a file_clerk , after his father died when he was young . His path to the bench had a number of unusual stops along the way . He attended four colleges before graduating from Cal State Los Angeles with a degree in music . He pursued his interest in music , playing the trumpet in Latin nightclubs , then attended graduate_school in library_science at UC Berkeley . He worked as a librarian before enrolling in law_school at the University of Illinois . He transferred to USC and received his law_degree in 1976 . After eight years in his own practice , he was appointed to the bench by then-Gov . George Deukmejian . Garcia is up for reelection in June but is unopposed .
