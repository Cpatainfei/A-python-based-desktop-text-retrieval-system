   <HEADLINE> JULIAN SCHWINGER ; NOBEL PHYSICIST , PROFESSOR AT HARVARD AND UCLA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Julian Schwinger , a Wunderkind of physics who earned his doctorate at 21 , was a full_professor at Harvard at 29 and won the Nobel Prize when he was 47 , died Saturday . A spokesman for the UCLA physics department said Monday that Schwinger -- who came_to the university full time in 1972 -- was 76 when he died of pancreatic_cancer at his Bel-Air home . Schwinger , who was then teaching at Harvard , shared the 1965 Nobel with Richard Feynman of Caltech and Shinichero Tomonaga of Japan for work_on the theory of quantum electrodynamics . The exceedingly complex theory deals with the fields and interactions of elementary_particles . Mildly eccentric , Schwinger in his early years was known for preferring to sleep during the day and work_at night . At a 60th-birthday tribute to him in 1978 , a colleague recalled that when everyone else working_at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ' s radiation laboratory during World_War_II was leaving at 5 p.m. , &quot; Julian was just arriving. &quot; Schwinger was working_on radar projects at MIT and later joined the Manhattan_Project , which developed the first atom_bomb . His awards were numerous . In 1964 , President Lyndon B . Johnson presented him the newly created National Medal of Science . In 1951 he was one of two young scientists selected for the first Albert Einstein award , established by the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton , where Einstein was in residence . And the National Academy of Sciences , to which he belonged for 45 years , awarded him its Nature of Light prize in 1949 . Schwinger , the son of a dress manufacturer , was a child_prodigy who skipped three grades of public_school and entered City College of New York at 14 . He transferred to Columbia University and received a bachelor of arts degree when he was 17 , then studied at the University of Wisconsin and Purdue University before earning his doctorate at Columbia . He moved to Berkeley , where he worked with J . Robert Oppenheimer before returning to teach at Harvard . When he became a full_professor there , he was one of the youngest to have achieved that rank in the 300-year history of the campus . Beyond his contributions as a scientist , Schwinger was considered one of UCLA ' s best and most beloved teachers . &quot; He directed more_than 70 doctoral theses and is the ancestor of at least four generations of physicists , &quot; said David Saxon , UCLA professor emeritus of physics and president emeritus of the University of California . Three of those students went_on to win their own Nobel Prizes . &quot; Julian was a gentle , cultivated man and one of a handful of scientists whose magnificent contributions made science the great intellectual adventure of the 20th Century , &quot; Saxon added . UCLA Chancellor Charles E . Young said Schwinger &quot; will be remembered as one of the great intellectual leaders of UCLA. &quot; Schwinger ' s friends said he loved music as well as physics . He was an ardent pianist who studied for most of his life . &quot; If something is worth doing , it is worth doing badly , &quot; he once said of his playing . He is survived by his wife , Clarice .</TEXT>
