   <HEADLINE> THE FAMILY FILE : ' 90S FAMILY ; LINKING GRANDPARENTS AND GRANDCHILDREN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dr. Arthur Kornhaber calls it the &quot; vital connection , &quot; the special link between grandparent and grandchild . But in a world where grandparents and grandchildren may live miles and miles apart -- and where grandparents may be living lives as full and as demanding as their adult children -- maintaining that tie is sometimes complicated . As founder of the Foundation for Grandparenting ( Box 326 , Cohasset , Mass . 02025 ) , Kornhaber runs multi-generational summer_camps that promote the relationship between grandchildren and grandparents . Campers , he notes , range_in age from 3 to 90 . Kornhaber , a psychiatrist , is also the author of a new book on the subject , &quot; Grandparent Power ! &quot; ( Crown ) . With 60 million grandparents in this country , the grandparent ' s role in the family is evolving , Kornhaber points_out . Grandparents live longer , more energetic lives , and often are_better educated and more financially independent than in past generations . Divorce , day_care and geographical separation also are changing the rules of grandparenting , he contends . &quot; Find your grandparenthood among all your diverse identities , &quot; Kornhaber counsels . &quot; Try to give it priority . &quot; That , after all , is what a long life is for. &quot; Setting the Stage for Better Communities The Children ' s Bureau of Southern California ' s Inglewood office has received a $ 150 # 000 grant from the James Irvine Foundation to assist with its &quot; Build Caring Communities &quot; project . This program focuses_on encouraging parents to help other parents living_in the same community -- in this case , to establish a Family and Community Development Center . The grant will also promote development of Children ' s Bureau family support and child_abuse prevention strategies . Giving Preschoolers a Healthy Outlook The Florida-based John S . and James L . Knight Foundation will invest $ 1.7 million over the next two years to raise immunization levels among preschool children in 25 cities across the country -- among them , Long_Beach and San Jose . Although 80 % of all vaccinations are required by a child ' s second birthday , the Knight Foundation points_out that national statistics show that between 40 % and 60 % of 2-year-olds have not received such vaccinations , making them vulnerable to such preventable diseases as measles , mumps and whooping_cough . This immunization project will target specific communities . In San Jose , for example , a poster in English , Spanish , Vietnamese and Cambodian will feature pictures of babies from one of the city ' s neighborhoods . Exploring the World of Adoption Vista Del Mar Child and Family Services in West Los Angeles is offering a two-part Orientation to Adoption for families . The orientation will present an overview of adoption , covering such issues as the emotional impact , various avenues of adoption ( open , international , agency and collaborative ) , and consent and relinquishment . The cost is $ 75 for couples , $ 45 for singles . Vista Del Mar also offers pre- and post-adoption workshops . For more information , call Joan Apt , ( 310 ) 836-1222 , Ext . 280 .</TEXT>
