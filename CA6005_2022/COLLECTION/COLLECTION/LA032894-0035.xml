   <TEXT> Two teen-age college_students from Japan who came_to the United States to pursue their dreams of becoming filmmakers , only to be gunned_down in a carjacking , died after being taken_off life support_systems Sunday , the day their parents arrived from Japan . Takuma Ito and Go Matsuura , both 19 , died Sunday evening , said Harbor-UCLA Medical_Center spokesman Randy Foster . Both had been declared brain-dead after being shot in the back of the head in a carjacking in the parking_lot of a San Pedro supermarket Friday night . Also late Sunday , Los Angeles police said they had found the compact_car that was stolen from the pair after they were shot . An anonymous caller alerted police , who found the white 1994 Honda Civic in the San Pedro area where the students were shot , police said . The car was taken Downtown to be tested for fingerprints and other evidence , an LAPD spokesman said . In Tokyo early today , U.S. Ambassador Walter Mondale issued a statement on behalf of the President , extending condolences to the families and stressing that such crimes do not represent everyday American life . In Los Angeles on Sunday , the families expressed no bitterness , saying they were grateful for the good experiences their sons had had here . &quot; He loved America , &quot; Akihiro Ito said . On Sunday , Harbor-UCLA Medical_Center was crowded with Japanese camera crews and reporters , who were covering the shooting as a top story -- one that followed on the heels of several other high-profile shootings of Japanese students in the United States . The shootings have raised the fears of many Japanese parents about sending their children abroad . At a news_conference in Tokyo , Mondale said : &quot; This is the saddest day in my time here as ambassador. &quot; He said he hoped that the Los Angeles shootings would not diminish the desire of Japanese to travel_to the United States . &quot; There are over 3 million Japanese who travel_to the United States each year , many of them tourists , and we have over 50 # 000 young Japanese studying in schools . . . . Practically every one of them has a wonderful experience . &quot; These tragedies -- such_as this one over the weekend in Los Angeles and the killing of ( Hattori ) in Louisiana -- they are just tragic from every standpoint . They give an entirely distorted picture of life in the United States . Most everyone lives a safe and fulfilling life . . . and are untouched by such horrible criminal behavior. &quot; Mondale noted that President Clinton had telephoned the parents of Yoshihiro Hattori , a Japanese high_school student shot to death in Louisiana in 1992 , and had received the Hattoris at the White_House . Mondale said he was sure that the President would contact the families of the carjacking victims . At the news_conference were a group of officials and students from the Baton_Rouge high_school where Hattori had studied . The group had planned the trip to express their sorrow to the Hattori family . &quot; We want the Japanese people to know that overall , the American people are a good people and that all_of us aren ' t violent and prone to kill , &quot; Principal Clarence Jones said . At Harbor-UCLA , the students ' Marymount College friends , both Japanese and American , had kept a vigil during the weekend . The Japanese students gathered quietly and told reporters they preferred to keep their grief private . Many American students wanted to express anger at the violence , and spoke with fondness of the two young_men they described as fun-loving and dedicated to becoming filmmakers . After improving their English at Marymount , Ito hoped to go_to UCLA and Matsuura to USC to pursue their filmmaking studies , friends said . &quot; ( Ito ' s ) hobby was becoming American , &quot; said fellow student Erica Stenta . Joshua Escandon , Ito ' s roommate , said the Japanese student was a fan of Steven Spielberg ' s work , especially his &quot; Indiana Jones &quot; movies . &quot; He was a great guy . He had a wonderful personality . He was very , very funny , &quot; Escandon said . Matsuura ' s roommate , Clayton Blocker , said he and Matsuura hit it off right away when they were assigned to share an apartment last fall . &quot; I didn ' t think it was his time to go . I don ' t think he deserved to die , &quot; Blocker said . Ito and Matsuura ' s parents flew here to be at their sons ' bedsides and to make the decision about terminating life support . Dr. Curtis Doberstein , acting chief resident in neurosurgery at Harbor-UCLA , said both were shot at close range . The bullets did not exit their heads . The fathers of the victims , speaking at a news_conference at the hospital , struggled to convey happy memories of their sons ' dreams . Akihiro Ito , an executive with a subsidiary of Japan Air Lines , said in Japanese that his son had told him since junior_high_school that &quot; I like America . I want to go_to America . I want to make movies. &quot; Ito said that before his son came here , he was &quot; a little worried , &quot; but what happened was &quot; my child ' s fate. &quot; &quot; For eight months , he had an enjoyable , enjoyable experience in America . Now , we must make an effort that this kind of sad event won ' t happen to Japanese young people again , &quot; he said . Go Matsuura was born in the United States and was in first_grade when he went_to Japan with his family , his father said . &quot; He thought America was a place where you could realize your dreams . So he came_to America , &quot; Shuji Matsuura said . &quot; He was always saying he liked it here . We were glad . &quot; Then this happened . It ' s too_bad that his dream was broken_in the America my son loved. &quot; His eyes downcast , Matsuura asked_in Japanese : &quot; Isn ' t there something we can all do so that this doesn ' t happen again ? &quot; Spring break had emptied much of the campus of Marymount College in Rancho Palos Verdes , where flags remained at half-staff on the picturesque grounds set high above the Pacific_Ocean . &quot; It ' s a spot where no one even thinks_of crime at all because it ' s not a problem , &quot; said Kevin O ' Connor , assistant director of admissions . &quot; This is a shock to everyone. &quot; At the Ralphs supermarket on Western Avenue in San Pedro , where the shootings occurred about 11 p.m. Friday , several bouquets of flowers had been laid_in the parking_lot . With no suspects , Los Angeles police have appealed_to the public for help in finding the gunman or gunmen . Detectives with the robbery-homicide unit of LAPD ' s Major Crimes Section can be reached at ( 213 ) 485-2129 or ( 213 ) 485-2504 . American friends of the two young_men said that this episode made them realize just how dangerous Los Angeles has become -- and how the danger is taken_for granted . &quot; I want you to put something in your article , &quot; Stenta insisted . &quot; We have to stop accepting this as a normal , everyday part of life . Everybody has to stop it -- don ' t allow it . It can ' t go_on like this . &quot; Why doesn ' t Japan have problems like this ? They don ' t have guns on the street . We ' ve got_to have stronger laws or we ' re going to kill each other off. &quot; Times staff writers Jeffrey Rabin and Ann W . O ' Neill in Los Angeles and Sam Jameson in Tokyo contributed to this story .</TEXT>
