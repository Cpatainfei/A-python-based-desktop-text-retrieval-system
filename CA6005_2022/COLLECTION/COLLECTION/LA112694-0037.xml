   <HEADLINE> MILITARY SEEKS TO GIVE MORE ACTIVE ROLES TO RESERVISTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. armed_services , in a step endorsed by Defense_Secretary William J . Perry , are looking_for ways to make more use of reservists in carrying_out the military ' s work , a Defense_Department spokesman said Friday . &quot; Expansion is the right word to use &quot; because no new roles are being considered , the spokesman , Maj . Tom Schultz , said in a telephone_interview . Military_reserves and the National_Guard already perform more_than one-third of the military ' s daily activities , ranging from administrative support to airlift , Schultz said . Greater use of reservists would make_it easier for the U.S. military to meet global commitments at_the_same_time the size of the U.S. armed forces is being scaled back . There are 1.03 million people in the six Reserve and National_Guard wings under Defense_Department control . About 1.6 million men and women are_on active duty in the armed_services . &quot; We ' re not looking_at doing anything new . . . just looking_at things we ' re already doing and finding ways to expand that , &quot; Schultz said . Perry has endorsed the concept of greater use of reservists , Schultz said . The Army , Navy and Air_Force are engaged in determining how it could be done , he said . In its Friday editions , the New York Times said officials were considering having reservists use annual training to carry_out real operations , including overseas peacekeeping assignments . Backers of the plan say it would give reservists valuable experience while reducing the strain on regular troops . The Army plans to send a battalion of 430 reservists and 110 active-duty soldiers for a six-month rotation in a multinational observer force in the Sinai , the first time since the Army began sending troops there in the early 1980s that it was sending reservists .</TEXT>
