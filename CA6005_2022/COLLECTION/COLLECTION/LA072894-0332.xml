   <HEADLINE> BRIEFING BOOK / CAROL J . WILLIAMS : INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS ; CROATIA ' S SHIPBUILDING INDUSTRY : OPPORTUNITIES FOR RISK_TAKERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> ISSUE : Inspired by the numerous natural harbors along the Adriatic coastline that stretches 400 miles past 1 # 000 islands , Yugoslavia built an impressive network of shipyards and marine repair facilities before the federation was destroyed by nationalism and war . The now-independent Republic of Croatia has inherited most of the coast and the entire shipbuilding_industry , and investors are pondering whether the former workhorses can be revived in the capitalist era as the country seeks to revamp a thoroughly shattered economy . However , a global shipbuilding slump , the looming menace of another war and Zagreb politicians ' penchant for interference in business matters have combined to cast doubts on the likelihood of a rescue . BACKGROUND : After tourism , shipbuilding was the most important economic activity in Croatia during the Yugoslav era . It produced more_than 30 # 000 jobs , 5 % of the gross_domestic_product and more_than $ 800 million in exports at the mid-1980s peak . Worldwide recession and the virtual standstill that gripped Croatian industry after its 1991 war with Serbian nationalist insurgents meant a drop_in construction contracts . Banking disorder that resulted from the breakup of Yugoslavia have exacerbated the crisis , as potential buyers find it difficult to get the necessary loans and credits to finance their projects . The shipbuilding crisis mirrors the general economic catastrophe in Croatia . The unemployment_rate , at 20 % , is among the highest in Europe . Military spending continues to drain national resources , and the program of privatizing state industries has been discredited by corruption . Shipyard jobs have been reduced by more_than half , to about 15 # 000 today , and many of those positions are at risk unless the major yards lure foreign investors . OUTLOOK : Hyperinflation has been brought under_control in less than a year by severely limiting the money_supply , but most statistics indicate further contraction of the economy . Also , the 3-year-old standoff between the Croatian government and the Serb rebels , who hold about a third of the country , has been heating_up , stirring fears that the government may push to recpature the lands . Western diplomats say they see little chance of Croatia ' s coastal industries being directly affected by the fighting , because the disputed territory lies inland . Of greater concern to most foreign analysts is the Croatian government ' s tarnished record on privatization . Independent economist Drazen Kalodjera estimates that less than 5 % of industrial assets have been transferred to private hands since the undertaking began three years ago . Evaluations and bidding are controlled by senior members of the ruling Croatian Democratic Forum , and this often results in sweetheart deals for political backers . &quot; We have again today an amalgamation of state , ruling party and economy , just as we had four years ago , &quot; Kalodjera complained , comparing the present to the former Communist order . A Zagreb-based diplomat agreed : &quot; If I were a foreign investor , I would hate to have to go_to the Croatian court system. &quot; STRATEGY : Croatia ' s shipyards are judged by industry_analysts to be well-equipped with skilled_workers who are more affordable since the crisis has depressed the average wage to $ 120 a month . On a strictly economic basis , joint_ventures with Croatian companies would appear to offer good long-term prospects for investors , Western economic attaches say . They cite a large backlog of orders at one Rijeka yard , hints from Iran and other Islamic oil-producing countries that they might bankroll major tanker projects if Croatia cooperates with Bosnian Muslims , and suggestions that the shipyards might be suitable for servicing U.S. naval vessels . Still , area conflicts increase risks . And as one Western diplomat noted , the Croatian government ' s current willingness to revise laws and remove impediments to foreign investment should be viewed_as a double-edged sword . &quot; They ' re being very flexible now , and my guess is that the Croatian government would pave the way for foreign investment in shipbuilding sooner than any other industry , &quot; the diplomat said . &quot; But politics can change priorities. &quot;</TEXT>
