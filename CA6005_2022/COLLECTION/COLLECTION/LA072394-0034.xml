   <HEADLINE> ENTREPRENEUR TAKES_AIM AT FASHION TREND ; BUSINESS : NEW HAMPSHIRE MAN SELLS BULLET-RIDDLED CLOTHING AS A LARK . BUT HE ' S UNDER FIRE BY THOSE WHO OBJECT TO HIS HIGH-CALIBER STYLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was an especially hot summer day , and Frank Allgeyer had worked_up quite a sweat out there at the sandpit , shooting holes in T-shirts with his MAC-10 automatic submachine_gun . Oh , and there also were bullet-riddled jeans and jackets , all victims this scorching Friday of Allgeyer ' s unerring trigger finger and shrewd fashion marksmanship . &quot; Who ' d have thought ? &quot; said the 44-year-old carpenter , now the corporate sharpshooter behind the sights of Drive-By Fashions , a one-month-old enterprise that will &quot; custom-perforate &quot; your favorite jeans , T-shirts or denim jackets . &quot; I mean , this whole_thing started_out as a goof. &quot; But some Granite_State politicians were less than amused . New Hampshire Atty . Gen . Jeffrey R . Howard called a news_conference Wednesday to denounce what he feared was a potentially dangerous teen-age fashion trend . He was joined by a Democratic state_senator , Barbara Baldizar , who worried that children might &quot; take guns and try to shoot their own holes in clothing. &quot; Little did the two state officials realize that Allgeyer and his best_friend , Steve Holden , also a carpenter , had dreamed_up Drive-By Fashions on a fishing day when nothing was biting . Talking_about how ridiculous it was that people actually paid good money for pants with holes and slashes in them , the pair began speculating about the limits of couture correctness . &quot; It was like a ' Saturday Night Live ' skit , &quot; said Holden , 42 . &quot; We were out there in a boat , and we ' re thinking , ' Yeah , maybe we should throw some grenades at a pile of T-shirts. &quot; ' Holden went so far as_to dare his friend to run with what both admitted was a ludicrous idea . In a black-bordered two-by-four-inch advertisement in the Manchester Union Leader , Allgeyer proved he was a better fiction writer than fisherman . &quot; Looking_for that unique gift for the person who has everything ? &quot; he wrote . &quot; Clothes with bullet_holes are big on the West Coast now. &quot; A mailing_address and price_list followed . So did a firestorm that Allgeyer said he was completely unprepared for . Along with his political strafing , Allgeyer was shrapneled in a Boston Globe editorial Friday berating him for a &quot; tacky , tasteless fashion scam &quot; that promotes violence in a country where every day 42 people are killed by firearms . San Francisco psychologist Ross E . Goldstein , president of a trend-watching organization called Generation Insights Inc. , termed those reactions &quot; another example of people trying to set social_policy by quick and easy sloganing. &quot; &quot; It ' s like magic , &quot; he went_on , &quot; this idea that we will ban the most visible symptom and thus stop the cause . The problem is not fashions with bullet_holes , the problem is much deeper. &quot; Alan Millstein , a fashion analyst in New York , said bullet-riddled clothing no more condoned violence than military surplus attire could be viewed_as &quot; a statement of support for the armed forces. &quot; &quot; There is no doubt in my mind that in Beverly Hills or the East Village , they would find a host of fashion flakes and fashion savants who would want to wear these kinds of things , &quot; Millstein said . Allgeyer , a native of a state where green flies pose a greater menace than gang warfare , said he could not understand why anyone in Southern California would want to buy his product anyway . &quot; In L.A. , from what I understand , all you have to do is hang a bag of laundry on your porch in the morning , and by afternoon , you ' ll have drive-by fashions , &quot; Allgeyer said . &quot; ' Course , &quot; he added , tongue planted firmly in cheek , &quot; then you would n ' t have the certificate of authenticity. &quot; Pointing_out that if current projections hold true , New Hampshire will have an annual homicide rate of 12 for all_of 1994 , Allgeyer stressed that &quot; this was never meant to be mean-spirited or to promote gang violence or anything like that . I can ' t emphasize that enough. &quot; He said he found it ironic that in a state known for its panther-like protection of individual liberties , his T-shirt company would suddenly become a cause_celebre . New Hampshire takes seriously the phrase &quot; Live Free or Die &quot; emblazoned on its license_plates , Allgeyer noted . &quot; Here we have the attorney_general , the defender of peoples ' rights , and he ' s walking all_over my First_Amendment rights , &quot; Allgeyer said . &quot; We don ' t even have a line of clothing in_stores , and he ' s trying to get us banned from schools in September. &quot; The venture has hardly been a financial gold mine , either . In one month , Allgeyer has &quot; custom-perforated &quot; about 35 garments that have been sent to him . Prices range from $ 15 to $ 35 , and customers can select how many rounds of ammunition they want , as well as the type of firearm . Most , he said , opt_for &quot; the flagship of the fleet , &quot; the machine_gun . All of his weapons are fully licensed , Allgeyer said , explaining that after he has paid_for the ammunition and the gas he uses to drive_out to the local sandpit , where the shooting is conducted , &quot; I ' m probably making about $ 6 an hour . I make more_than that pounding nails. &quot; But if Drive-By Fashions does turn a profit , Allgeyer has pledged to donate some of his earnings to anti-violence groups or drug rehabilitation_programs . But he expressed amazement that even three dozen people would spend money on the shoot- ' em-up look . &quot; Look , I started_out goofing on everybody , &quot; Allgeyer said . &quot; I ' m still goofing on everybody . And now the politicians are goofing on themselves. &quot;</TEXT>
