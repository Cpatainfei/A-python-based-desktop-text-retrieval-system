   <HEADLINE> SURVIVING CANCER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * Of the more_than 8 million Americans who have a history of cancer , 5 million are living five years past their initial diagnosis . * Patients who are disease-free for five years have an 80 % chance of being cured . * By 2000 , at least 10 million Americans will be cancer survivors . Once perceived as a diagnosis of death , cancer today has higher survival rates , especially in children and young adults . The result is a growing group of long-term survivors who often need help readjusting . According to Susan Nessim , president of Cancervive , the population that had childhood cancer has the most problems after treatment ' s end . &quot; They have no work history , no health_insurance and no support of a husband or wife , &quot; Nessim says . &quot; They have to get_out there and date , often can ' t have children and when they try to adopt , they ' re discriminated against. &quot; * For information on Cancervive , call ( 800 ) 486-2873 .
