   <HEADLINE> THE WEEK AHEAD : BRUSSELS ; EU MEETS ON ACCESS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The European Union ' s executive commission meets here Wednesday to confront one of the Continent ' s most important long-term challenges : how to facilitate the integration of the fragile new democracies in the former Communist eastern countries into the developed markets of the 12 West European_countries . The test for the affluent western members of the EU will be their willingness to throw open their own highly protected markets in agriculture , steel , textiles and other politically sensitive areas . Relatively advanced post-Communist economies such_as those in Poland , Hungary and the Czech republic are pressing for more market access . They also want full EU membership far sooner than the union ' s western leaders foresee . The western countries speak vaguely about admission in the year 2000 .</TEXT>
