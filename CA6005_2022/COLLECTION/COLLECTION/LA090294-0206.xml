   <HEADLINE> THE KING OF CONTROVERSY ; ONCE , WILLIAM KUNSTLER EPITOMIZED MOVEMENT LAWYERS : FIGHTING FOR CIVIL RIGHTS , AGAINST VIETNAM . HE HASN ' T CHANGED MUCH SINCE THEN . BUT HIS CLIENTS HAVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As he drove down a darkened highway into Manhattan one night , William M . Kunstler clicked on the radio and learned that he was dead . &quot; The body of famed radical attorney William Kunstler was found in his home this afternoon , an apparent suicide , &quot; the announcer said . &quot; we ' ll be gathering reaction from the political world as this story develops. &quot; Intrigued , Kunstler turned_up the volume and heard more details of his life and untimely death . The report was only corrected hours later , with the news that one of his nephews with the same name had killed himself instead . &quot; I guess they were guilty of wishful_thinking , &quot; Kunstler cracks , recalling the bizarre 1976 broadcast . &quot; Some folks don ' t hide it very well. &quot; It wasn ' t the first or last time that America ' s most prominent left-wing lawyer has been written_off for dead . For years , his bushy sideburns and abrasive politics have seemed as dated as the 1960s themselves , his flamboyant courtroom style a throwback to earlier , more innocent times . Once , Kunstler was the king of movement lawyers . Brash , self-serving and often brilliant , he epitomized a generation of white , middle-class attorneys who raised_hell over civil_rights , police brutality and the Vietnam_War . Best known for his role in the Chicago Seven conspiracy trial of 1969 , Kunstler joined with such lawyers as Charles Garry , Gerald Lefcourt , Leonard Weinglass and Ramsey Clark in a saber-rattling crusade against Fortress Amerika . Now 75 , Kunstler hasn ' t changed much . But his clients have . He used to represent people like Abbie Hoffman and Tom Hayden -- radicals with national followings -- yet lately he ' s become the pariah ' s attorney of choice . A man who turns terrorists , rapists and murderers into political causes celebres . It ' s brought him new life in the ' 90s , as well as scathing criticism . Indeed , Vanity_Fair dubbed him &quot; The Most Hated Lawyer in America , &quot; and there ' s no shortage of pundits who call him a hypocrite . But Kunstler couldn ' t care less . &quot; My agenda is the same as 25 years ago , &quot; he insists . &quot; It ' s just that these are rougher times and the folks I deal with now aren ' t the same. &quot; In recent years , Kunstler has handled clients ranging from El Sayyid Nosair -- the man accused of murdering Rabbi Meir Kahane -- to Larry Davis , a black_man charged with killing four men and wounding six New York cops . He defended Yusef Salaam , one of several youths who participated in the rape and attack on the Central_Park jogger , and he represented mob killer John Gotti . This fall , he ' ll defend Colin Ferguson , a Jamaican immigrant who killed six people and wounded 19 in a wild shooting spree on the Long_Island Railroad . Kunstler plans an insanity defense and has sparked a national controversy by suggesting that &quot; black rage &quot; triggered Ferguson ' s attack . &quot; Ever since the Chicago trial , I realized that America ' s criminal justice system is bankrupt , &quot; says Kunstler , his trademark bifocals perched on a mane of unruly hair . &quot; My focus is_on people who can least defend themselves . On African Americans , on followers of Islam , who are_on the margins of society . These folks have a constitutional right to a lawyer like anyone else. &quot; Until recently , he represented three of 13 men charged with plotting to blow_up the United Nations and other New York City landmarks . Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman -- the alleged ringleader -- has sought his services , as have three of the four Muslims convicted earlier this year of bombing the World Trade Center . The New York conspiracy trial might have given him his biggest platform yet . But U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey removed Kunstler ' s law_firm from the case last week , citing a conflict_of_interest . Two defendants he once represented in the_matter now have different attorneys , Mukasey ruled , and it would be ethically difficult for the lawyer to cross-examine them as witnesses . Kunstler , who expected the decision , blasted Mukasey for caving_in to government pressure , adding : &quot; The state has wanted to kick our asses off this case so bad , they could taste it . They just can ' t keep_up with me. &quot; He ' s come a long way from his days as a quiet suburban attorney , and Kunstler celebrates the odyssey in &quot; My Life as a Radical Lawyer &quot; ( Birch Lane Press ) , a provocative new autobiography . As he sees it , there ' s an ideological line running from the streets of Chicago in 1969 to the wreckage of the World Trade Center . The argument baffles many friends , who view Kunstler ' s evolution with dismay . Yet they seem just as concerned for the future of progressive politics . What happened to him , in a sense , reflects the lack of direction on the American left . &quot; He ' s a mirror of the times , because the ' 60s was an era of hope and change , &quot; says Lynn Stewart , an attorney who ' s worked with Kunstler . &quot; As that disappears you get involved with things that aren ' t as pure . You make excuses and see political righteousness in cases where it ' s not quite so clear. &quot; It hasn ' t made him rich . Kunstler could have cashed_in_on his celebrity but instead earns $ 100 # 000 annually , working_out of an office in his Greenwich_Village home . Along with Ron Kuby , a ponytailed 37-year-old disciple , he handles many cases pro bono and only rarely takes_on cash-rich clients . &quot; There is no need to say , ' Who is Mr. Kunstler ? ' &quot; wrote Mohammed Salameh , one of four men convicted of bombing the World Trade Center , in a letter to the U.S. Court of Appeals asking that Kunstler be named his lawyer . &quot; He is as a mountain on the ground . I think all lawyers are kids compared to him. &quot; * Outside New York City , however , Kunstler has fallen_off the media radar screen . These days , some folks are amazed he ' s even alive when they run_into him , reacting as if they ' d seen a ghost . Tall , garrulous and still bristling with indignation , he remains every prosecutor ' s worst nightmare : a smooth-talking lefty who gets maximum press for his political clients . &quot; Bill Kunstler has never been effective by the standards of the Harvard Law Review , &quot; says Norman Dorsen , former chief of the American Civil Liberties Union . &quot; He ' s been very effective , however , as a radical lawyer . You just want to tell him that it ' s not 1969 anymore . People can ' t live_in a time warp. &quot; Yet it ' s unavoidable , when his very name conjures_up a trip down memory lane : To the South , where he bailed_out freedom riders . To Chicago , where his seven clients were acquitted of conspiring to disrupt the 1968 Democratic convention . To Attica , where he counseled inmates during the 1971 uprising . To Wounded Knee , where he joined Native_Americans in a tense standoff with FBI_agents . His friends and clients in those years read like a Who ' s Who of change and upheaval , including Lenny Bruce , Martin_Luther_King Jr. , Malcolm X , Stokley Carmichael , Adam Clayton Powell Jr. , the Berrigan Brothers and Jack Ruby . Even his worst enemies concede Kunstler ' s place in the history books . But he can never get enough recognition . By his own admission , the aging lawyer has an insatiable craving for approval , even from strangers . &quot; How did I do ? &quot; he asks a frail woman in a wheelchair , who ' s just heard him talk_about crime prevention at a Connecticut event . &quot; Was I OK today ? &quot; Seconds later , he asks the same question of other startled listeners . Narcissism is an occupational disease among lawyers . Yet Kunstler has a conflicting impulse as well -- an instinct for controversy that offends many . The two spirits have been at war in him for years , with disastrous results . &quot; There ' s an odd hunger in him , &quot; says ACLU colleague Henry Schwarzchild . &quot; I don ' t think Bill has any ideology as such . But he has a powerful need to make waves , to constantly get_in your face . And he pays the price. &quot; * Since 1980 , Kunstler has received a stream of death threats and obscene calls . Gunman have fired at his office and demonstrators have marched in front of his home . He ' s been beaten_up , jailed and cited by judges for contempt . By now , friends wonder why he bothers . Kunstler is a cultured man who writes sonnets in his spare_time and brings his wife breakfast in bed . He has two teen-age daughters from a second marriage , a busy lecture schedule and a film career with credits in movies by Oliver Stone , Spike Lee and Ron Howard . Shouldn ' t he begin to close_down the office early and relax ? &quot; It ' s time to say goodby , &quot; says a New York State Supreme Court judge , who dismisses Kunstler as an anachronism . New York Daily News columnist Jim Sleeper calls him a &quot; public fraud &quot; over the Ferguson case , and Bronx Dist . Atty . Paul Gentile attacks him as a racist for excluding whites from criminal juries . &quot; This man ran_out of causes a long_time ago , &quot; says attorney Alan Dershowitz , a frequent critic . &quot; And he ' s veered into dubious areas. &quot; As the attacks mount , friends stress Kunstler ' s integrity . Gerald Lefcourt , once a prominent left-wing attorney and now a criminal defense_lawyer , says his colleague had it easier 30 years ago , when the issues were simpler . &quot; He was doing God ' s work , &quot; Lefcourt says . &quot; It was important. &quot; But memories are short . Some Jewish critics suggest that Kunstler , who is Jewish , has deliberately sought_out Muslim terrorists as clients . They ' re angry that he got Nosair acquitted in the 1990 murder of Meir Kahane , suggesting he couldn ' t possibly believe his client was innocent . &quot; Listen , &quot; Kunstler snaps , &quot; they called me a nigger-lover down south when I worked with civil_rights activists , and now up north they call me a self-hating Jew . Believe me , this is one Jew who loves himself. &quot; * On that much , most agree . Kunstler ' s vanity is legendary , and it fills the chapters of his new book . For 609 pages , the author lets his enemies have it . He calls Dershowitz reprehensible for representing Leona Helmsley , and criticizes John and Robert Kennedy as power-mad , saying their deaths were in some ways good for the country . Angered that Marlon Brando removed him from the legal team defending his son , Christian , Kunstler ridicules the Los Angeles attorney who replaced him -- Robert Shapiro , now representing O.J. Simpson -- as &quot; a wheeler-dealer . . . not really a trial lawyer. &quot; Beyond gossip , the book relates Kunstler ' s own story in rich detail . Born into a family of doctors , he grew_up in Manhattan , the oldest of three children . Unlike his quieter siblings , he was always the extrovert . Tellingly , the rebellious boy tried to befriend blacks , but was forbidden by his parents . He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Yale , won the Bronze_Star in World_War_II and got a law_degree from Columbia University . By 1948 , Kunstler had married Lotte Rosenberger , a childhood flame , and the couple had two daughters . Soon , he formed a law_practice with his brother , Michael , and the two made a living handling wills and estates . It all changed in 1961 , when an ACLU friend asked Kunstler to stop in Jackson , Miss. , on his way home from a Los Angeles trip . Civil rights protests were erupting , and the Freedom Riders -- a group of activists trying to integrate bus systems in the Deep_South -- were being sent to prison . Kunstler went_to offer moral support . But he stayed longer than expected , rocked by his encounter with racism . He drifted away from his law_practice and became more politically involved . Eventually , Kunstler served as counsel to Dr. Martin_Luther_King Jr. , and he helped form the Center for Constitutional Rights , a pioneering advocacy group in New York . His star was rising , but the Chicago Seven case put him on the map . When prosecutors failed to win a conspiracy conviction , Kunstler got much of the media credit . Imagine a trial where one defendant is gagged , another hurls Yiddish curses at the judge and the prosecutor attacks his rivals as homosexuals . It happened in Chicago , after Kunstler and others turned the proceedings into political theater . When the dust settled , there were contempt sentences for all , including a four-year prison penalty for Kunstler . He was later cleared . &quot; Bill ' s always shown great courage , &quot; says attorney Leonard Weinglass , who worked with Kunstler on the Chicago trial . &quot; And when you think that he was once a Hubert Humphrey liberal who dabbled_in politics , the change is amazing . His cases are the stuff of history. &quot; * Kunstler ' s autobiography lists them all , but its most revealing passages focus_on his personal life . With painful honesty , he recounts the sexual infidelities that led to the breakup of his first marriage in 1973 . &quot; Young_women pursued me , most likely because I was something of a celebrity and , the more well known I became , the more aggressive the woman got , &quot; he writes . &quot; For someone with my vanity and ego , it was gratifying. &quot; Kunstler married his second wife , attorney Margaret Ratner , in 1975 . He speaks effusively about her , saying she has made him more considerate . Asked about his first wife , Kunstler says he and Lotte have &quot; a very decent relationship. &quot; She , however , offers a different view . &quot; His belligerence on behalf of what he believes is sincere , &quot; the former Mrs . Kunstler suggests . &quot; But it ' s also exaggerated , because he wants to impress people , too . . . . He has this incredible need to be understood and liked . And I don ' t think he ' s all that mature at 75 . That part of him is suspect. &quot; So is his memory . In her introduction to Kunstler ' s book , co-writer Sheila Isenberg says the lawyer told her stories about himself that turned_out to be untrue . In many cases , she adds , &quot; he is the principal embellisher of_his_own myth. &quot; * At 6 on a cool Monday morning , Kunstler is heading for Hartford , Conn . It ' s Law Day and the man who has been slapped with more contempt citations than he cares to remember will be a featured speaker before 22 judges . &quot; Can you believe this ? &quot; he mutters outside his office . &quot; It ' s kind of strange . But if they want me , they want me. &quot; They want him at 10 a.m. sharp , and Kunstler is known for being late . This morning he wants to be_on time and his chariot awaits -- a beat-up van with a canoe on top that looks_like a hippie bus from 1967 . Inside , it ' s a mess . The driver , a young law_student and ardent Irish_Republican_Army sympathizer , has a bumper sticker taped to the roof that reads : &quot; Strip Search the Queen. &quot; Almost immediately , Kunstler starts yakking . &quot; Will you get_to the goddamned point ! &quot; he barks , as the driver tries to cut_in with a long , complicated joke . &quot; We don ' t have a lot of time. &quot; Not when Kunstler wants the floor . Seizing an opening , he starts a daylong , stream-of-consciousness rap that ' s almost impossible to interrupt . It begins with the Patty Hearst case , which Kunstler brings_up for no apparent reason , then skips to the time he hugged Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun . Digressing altogether , Kunstler recalls a dinner with John Gotti and then describes the girls he made_love to during a 1936 trip to Spain . As the van chugs into suburban Westchester County , he complains about his former home , saying : &quot; Not one black_person lived_in my town . It was unreal. &quot; When his van reaches the Hartford courthouse , Kunstler is greeted by John Brittain , a black law professor . He recalls how the New York lawyer helped bail_out Freedom Riders . Long before most whites discovered civil_rights . &quot; Bill is special , &quot; Brittain says , hugging him . &quot; We don ' t forget. &quot; * Inside , Kunstler sits on a dais in a courtroom . It ' s a bizarre sight that grows more incongruous when 22 black-robed judges file_in , solemnly nodding at the long-haired lawyer . Amazed , he nods back . &quot; No one here should dispute this man ' s commitment to justice , even though we may_not agree with him , &quot; says Matthew Gordon , a local lawyer who helped select Kunstler as the day ' s speaker . Casing the crowd , Kunstler gives them a polite tongue-lashing . He notes that Law Day is a counterpoint to May_Day in socialist countries . Then he blasts corrupt officials -- including judges -- who &quot; set_up &quot; innocent blacks . &quot; I don ' t think I ' ve ever been in a room with so many judges without wanting to hide , &quot; he jokes . &quot; But it ' s OK , I can get_out of here fast. &quot; Kunstler rushes_out of the courthouse when the speech is over , heading for his next appointment 50 miles up the road . He ' s representing Moonface Bear , the Golden Hill Paugeesukq tribal_chief , who is battling state officials over the right to sell cigarettes tax-free on a reservation . &quot; Wait ! &quot; says Gordon , running_up to Kunstler . &quot; Can I come too ? &quot; It ' s a painful moment : Gordon , a middle-aged lawyer with a ' 60s hangover , would like nothing more_than to climb into Kunstler ' s magic bus . He ' ll call his secretary . He ' ll clear his schedule . He ' ll get_to touch Indians . &quot; Maybe I could follow you . . , &quot; he says , his voice trailing off . &quot; Or maybe we can do_it next time. &quot; The two shake hands and Kunstler ' s van rolls north . Lost in thought , he begins shuffling anxiously through legal papers . &quot; Now what the hell are we doing_up there on the reservation today ? &quot; he grumbles to himself . &quot; I don ' t really know what the program is yet. &quot; It ' s a recurring complaint about Kunstler . During the conspiracy trial , critics say , his rhetoric was compelling , but he didn ' t do his legal homework . The lawyer remembers it differently , and his war stories are surreal . Like the time he called Paul Krassner , editor of the Realist , to the stand . Unbeknown to the defense_team , the witness had taken a megadose of LSD before appearing . Here ' s how Kunstler describes the encounter : &quot; Tell the jury when you came_to Chicago in 1968 , &quot; he asked . &quot; I was born in Albany , &quot; Krassner answered . Perplexed , Kunstler asked : &quot; What did you do_in Chicago ? &quot; &quot; I was_on the high_school football_team , &quot; Krassner responded . By now spectators were stirring . Kunstler asked a final question : &quot; When did you leave Chicago ? &quot; &quot; I told you , I was_on the football_team , &quot; Krassner answered . At this , Abbie Hoffman whispered : &quot; He ' s freaked_out ! Sit him down ! &quot; Thinking quickly , Kunstler slammed his hand_down on the lectern and boomed : &quot; Thank you , Mr. Krassner ! No further questions ! &quot; As if his witness had delivered the most damning testimony in the trial . The prosecution team , which hadn ' t been paying_attention , impatiently waved Krassner off the stand . It ' s a great story . Except it ' s not quite true . In his memoirs , Krassner admits taking LSD , yet recalls a completely different exchange . The official transcript provides a third version . &quot; These are details , &quot; says Kunstler , asked about the discrepancies . &quot; I mean , the man was stoned out of his mind . that ' s all you need to know. &quot; * With a shudder , the van comes_to a halt on a dirt road in rural Connecticut . Easing his big frame out , Kunstler greets Moonface Bear , an unsmiling , solidly built man who welcomes him to the small reservation . Wandering down a forest trail , the lawyer outlines his client ' s case . But then he ' s overwhelmed by the past . There had been a tense confrontation here last summer between Native_Americans and police , he explains , and violence seemed imminent . &quot; This place , &quot; Kunstler says , &quot; had the smell of Attica. &quot; In September , 1971 , some 1 # 500 inmates at a prison in Upstate New York seized 42 hostages , demanding improvements in living conditions . Kunstler and others were called_in to help mediate the crisis . When talks stalled , state_troopers stormed Attica , killing 29 inmates and 10 civilian hostages . It was the bloodiest prison disaster in American history . The memory is crystal_clear . Or is it ? In Kunstler ' s book , he recalls a dramatic moment when he told inmates that they weren ' t going_to get a better deal than the final offer made by state negotiators . Tempers flared in the prison courtyard , then subsided . In the aftermath , he writes , New York Times reporter Tom Wicker -- who was also called_in to mediate -- came_up_to him and whispered : &quot; Bill , you ' ve saved all our lives. &quot; It ' s a great story . Except it isn ' t quite true . Wicker never said those words because he wasn ' t in the courtyard at that moment . He was 10 miles away in a motel bar , according to his own book , &quot; A Time to Die. &quot; He does , however , credit the attorney with great courage . &quot; I thought we were in danger of dying at one point , &quot; Kunstler says , heading for court with Moonface Bear . &quot; that ' s what I remember. &quot; * The next morning , Kunstler is in Manhattan federal_court . He ' s seeking permission from a three-judge panel to represent three of the men convicted in the World Trade Center bombing . A trial_judge had refused the request and Kunstler attacks his decision , saying : &quot; It makes the law look_like an ass. &quot; After a testy hearing , the panel also denies his plea , saying Kunstler could face a conflict_of_interest between these new defendants and others he represents . Angered , the lawyer strides outdoors to a phalanx of TV cameras . &quot; The United States_government is putting Islam on_trial , &quot; he says . &quot; We ' re going to fight them all_the way. &quot; Three hours later , he jets to Ohio for the 24th anniversary of the shooting of four students at Kent State University . It ' s an emotional event , and Kunstler ' s eyes fill with tears when he recalls how the families still grieve . &quot; They never got_over this , &quot; he says . &quot; Neither did I. &quot; But there ' s no time for nostalgia . As he speaks the next morning , Kunstler is in yet another courtroom , waiting for a client to be sentenced . Solomon Mengstie , a black Ethiopian Jew , was convicted of armed robbery and faces_up to 25 years in prison . He and others robbed two people of $ 9.99 , but friends say Mengstie is a soft-spoken man who simply fell_in with the wrong crowd . &quot; I never saw a person who inflicted so little pain and is about to receive so_much pain , &quot; Kunstler tells the court . &quot; To some he ' s just another black_man going_in . But this system is filled with racism. &quot; The judge listens impassively , then gives Mengstie 5 to 11 years . Kunstler makes his way_out of the crowded courts building , stifling a yawn . &quot; I ' m beat , &quot; he says , suddenly looking every one of his 75 years . * Back in the office , Kunstler is_on the phone with Ferguson , the Long_Island Railroad gunman . The lawyer rolls his eyes , as partner Kuby watches intently . &quot; I know , Colin . . . . Listen to me . . . Colin , please , &quot; he begs , as the client shouts about jail conditions . Soon , Kunstler loses patience and delivers his message : It would be good for Ferguson to appear on &quot; 60 Minutes &quot; in the fall and speak_to an audience of millions . &quot; Just be yourself , Colin , &quot; Kunstler says . &quot; that ' s all you have to do. &quot; Kuby , in a playful mood , jumps to his feet . &quot; Yeah , Colin , &quot; he says , spraying the room with imaginary gunfire . &quot; Just be your usual wacky self. &quot; It ' s getting late , and Kunstler steps outside for fresh air . He rubs his eyes and a visitor asks if he has a headache . The answer is automatic : &quot; When Charles Garry , the radical lawyer , was dying , they asked if he had a headache , &quot; he says . &quot; And he said : ' I don ' t have headaches . I give them. ' &quot; Kunstler laughs , but he can ' t steal another man ' s epitaph . What he has_in_mind for himself is more cinematic : A dramatic trial summation , perhaps , then a fatal collapse at the lectern . He ' ll breathe his last on the evening news . &quot; What a story ! &quot; he says , with a vainglorious grin . &quot; Now that ' s an obituary I can live with. &quot;</TEXT>
