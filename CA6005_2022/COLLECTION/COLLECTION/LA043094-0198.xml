   <HEADLINE> A FESTIVE SUNDAY OF LATIN POP ; POP BEAT : MORE THAN 100 PERFORMERS ARE SET FOR ' L.A. FIESTA BROADWAY , ' ' PRIMERO DE MAYO ' FEST AND A CINCO DE MAYO FIESTA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It may or may_not be the best , but in terms of sheer size Sunday ' s musical triple-header will undoubtedly qualify as the largest showcase of Latin pop ever staged in the United States . Organizers expect more_than 750 # 000 people to see more_than 100 performers -- including such big names as La Mafia , Los Tigres del Norte and Ricky Martin -- in performances stretching from downtown Los Angeles to South El Monte . The fifth annual edition of &quot; L.A. Fiesta Broadway , &quot; rivaled in scope only by Miami ' s annual &quot; Gran Festival de la Calle Ocho &quot; ( &quot; Eighth Street Fiesta &quot; ) , will take_place on nine stages on the portion of Broadway between First Street and Olympic Boulevard , with 60 artists performing before an expected crowd of 500 # 000 . Two other major celebrations will take_place at_the_same_time : The banda and nortena showcase &quot; Primero de Mayo &quot; festival on the grounds of the Los Angeles Sports Arena , sponsored by radio_station KLAX ( 97.9 FM ) and Fonovisa Records , is expected to draw 200 # 000 . And the Cinco de Mayo fiesta at Whittier Narrows in South El Monte , sponsored by sister radio_stations KLVE ( 107.5 FM ) and KTNQ ( 1020 AM ) , is hoping for a crowd of anywhere from 35 # 000 to 70 # 000 . The scheduling of the three events on the same day was a coincidence , according to organizers , but all parties involved are confident that each event ' s uniqueness will ensure the expected success . &quot; These are three different events targeted to three specific types of audiences , &quot; said Tom Castro , president of El Dorado , a company that is a major sponsor of &quot; L.A. Fiesta Broadway. &quot; Other major sponsors are All Access Entertainment , Miracle on Broadway , AT &amp; T and the City of Los Angeles . Miami-based television network Univision , which sponsored the four previous editions , this time will film the event and produce two separate programs for national and local airing later in the year . El Dorado owns Los Angeles ' new Spanish-language radio_station KMQA ( 98.3 FM ) , known as La Maquina . While &quot; L.A. Fiesta Broadway &quot; has the more eclectic lineup -- banda , romantic ballads , salsa , pop , folkloric ballets and even rock en espanol -- the fiesta at Whittier Narrows has a more limited musical range , emphasizing solo singers and pop groups . KLAX ' s event at the Sports Arena concentrates_on the banda and nortena sound that has kept the station in the No . 1 spot in the Arbitron ratings since the fall of 1992 . Both &quot; L.A. Fiesta Broadway &quot; and KLVE ' s Whittier Narrows show are free events , but don ' t count the Sports Arena out : Despite the $ 7 ticket price , last year the event ' s 16 bandas attracted an estimated 200 # 000 . This year there will be 21 bandas . &quot; We expect a similar or even greater turnout , but even if 50 # 000 show_up it will be a tremendous success , &quot; said Alfredo Rodriguez , KLAX ' s general_manager . How do the talent rosters compare artistically ? Don ' t expect to see a sample of the finest Latin artists in any one of the three events . But mixed among good sellers , hot new faces and local unknowns are some truly significant artists . None of the organizers can claim to have the strongest lineup . &quot; L.A. Fiesta Broadway ' s &quot; bill offers salseros Marc Anthony and Colombia ' s exciting Grupo Niche , arguably the best of a long list that also includes the legendary Cruz Lizarraga ' s traditional Banda del Recodo , among others , performing from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. The Sports Arena event has nortena heroes Los Tigres del Norte as its main headliners , but the act to watch is up-and-coming nortena group Los Tiranos del Norte . The event will take_place on the outdoor grounds of the Sports Arena , with the performances also being shown on a giant TV screen inside the arena . The music starts at 9 a.m. and will last until 7 p.m. The fiesta at Whittier Narrows , the smallest of the three , has booked such major stars as Venezuelan Jose Luis Rodriguez , Ricky Martin , Los Mier and Pandora . The event , scheduled to run between 11 a.m. and 7 p.m. , also offers free parking . Beyond the music , some are looking_to the triple-header to prove that the Latino market in Los Angeles is even larger than assumed . &quot; It will show the incredible potential of our market , &quot; said Humberto Hernandez , station manager of La Maquina . &quot; Only in Los Angeles can you have three events like these , and you can rest assured all three will be packed. &quot;</TEXT>
