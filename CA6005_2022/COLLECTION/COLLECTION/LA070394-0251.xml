   <HEADLINE> PHILIP MORRIS CHALLENGES FLORIDA ' S ANTI-TOBACCO LAW</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Philip Morris is challenging what is considered the nation ' s toughest anti-tobacco law on grounds it is unconstitutional and was rammed through the state Legislature by a cabal of greedy lawyers . &quot; These attorneys stand to gain financially from the act_as much or more_than the state , &quot; says the lawsuit filed by the cigarette maker and other businesses late Thursday , the day before the law took_effect . The law allows the state to sue tobacco companies for the costs of treating Medicaid patients who have lung_cancer , emphysema or other smoking-related illnesses . The state has spent an estimated $ 1.2 billion to treat Medicaid patients with smoking-related illnesses since 1989 . The law , signed by Gov . Lawton Chiles last month , also prohibits companies from arguing that some of the blame rests with the smoker . It allows courts to impose judgments based on the companies ' market share rather than their percentage of fault . &quot; It ' s typical of those acts that pass without proper deliberation , &quot; said Barry Richard , a lawyer who represents those filing suit . &quot; In a lot of minds , it was drafted to do one thing . In effect , it does much more. &quot; The suit claims the law is unconstitional and arbitrary , and could expose virtually any industry to a lawsuit . Chiles spokesman Ron Sachs said Friday that the law will be used to sue only the tobacco_industry . &quot; A challenge was anticipated and it will be defended , &quot; Sachs said . Joining Philip Morris Inc. in the lawsuit were Publix Supermarkets Inc. , the National Assn . of Convenience_Stores , and Associated Industries of Florida , one of the state ' s top business lobbying groups . Messages seeking comment were not returned Friday from the offices and homes of officials with Publix , Philip Morris and Associated Industries . The lawsuit accuses a group of about 100 trial_lawyers that it called the &quot; inner_circle &quot; of masterminding the legislation and helping steer it through the state ' s House and Senate . &quot; There was no public notice , no legislative debate and no meaningful explanation of the amendment ' s contents , &quot; the lawsuit says . &quot; Both houses passed the act unanimously , with only the act ' s few drafters and sponsors having an understanding of its actual content. &quot; The suit says the law would benefit trial_lawyers because it allows the state to enter into agreements with private attorneys and pay them up_to 30 % of the amount it collects in a successful lawsuit .</TEXT>
