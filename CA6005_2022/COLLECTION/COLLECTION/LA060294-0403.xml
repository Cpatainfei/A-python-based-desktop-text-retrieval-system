   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; WHICH WAY LONG_BEACH ? ; MAYOR ' S RACE IS A STUDY IN CONTRASTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Long_Beach voters pull the curtain shut and confront their mayoral choices next Tuesday , their decisions could hinge_on a matter of style . Unquestionably , the two candidates offer a distinct contrast . Beverly O ' Neill is the genteel academic , a former community_college president known for employing a personal touch to win_over critics and forge coalitions . City Councilman Ray Grabinski is the blunt , blue-collar politician praised by supporters for his straight talk and unflagging energy . Both claim to be exactly what Long_Beach needs as it weaves through an urban minefield of racial tension , shrinking revenues and a changing self-image . At forums across town , each candidate has returned time and again to the issues raised by voters : crime and the city ' s troubled economy , which has been hit hard by shrinking defense and aerospace industries . O ' Neill promises to add 150 police_officers over three years , saying they are necessary to quell crime and residents ' fears . Grabinski focuses instead on the need for gang prevention programs and after-school recreation . Grabinski says existing businesses are his first concern ; O ' Neill talks_of wooing out-of-state corporations to town . * Although they have positioned themselves differently on the issues , they do agree on one thing : Long_Beach government needs a fresh approach . The 63-year-old O ' Neill , who is making her first bid for elected office and garnered the highest number of votes among 13 candidates in the April primary , talks_of breaking_away from &quot; policies mired in the past. &quot; She paints Grabinski as part of a sleepy government that has failed to address the city ' s pressing crime problems . &quot; My opponent has been a member of the City_Council for eight years , &quot; she said during a recent forum . &quot; Crime has increased in the last eight years . And there haven ' t been substantial recommendations forwarded to deter this violence . We need a direction , new leadership . We need new answers. &quot; Grabinski , 50 , brushes_aside suggestions that eight years on the City_Council have made him an insider , and he attempts to portray himself as the true outside candidate . &quot; I am one of the merchants of change . I think the Old_Guard sees me as a threat , &quot; he said . &quot; ( O ' Neill ) is more of an insider than I am. &quot; * To bolster his argument , Grabinski points to his political origins . He came_to elective office from the California Heights Action Group , which he co-founded 14 years ago to fight a proposed oil_refinery about a mile west of Long_Beach Municipal Airport . He says his grass-roots work made him independent of the elite insider power_structure . &quot; My independence can look_like stubbornness or something else , but I don ' t have to call anyone to find_out how to vote , &quot; he said . It ' s a delicate dance that Grabinski does , presenting himself as both an outsider and a well-connected man of experience . His contacts on county and state levels -- gained mostly through his seven years on the now-defunct Los Angeles County Transportation Commission -- are necessary for a mayor , he says . But raising his ties to the transportation commission also has political risks . Grabinski points to the Long Beach-to-Los Angeles Blue Line as a gleaming success . Yet during his tenure , the commission also faced turmoil surrounding the Norwalk-to-El Segundo Green Line . The light rail project suffered costly delays and has yet to open because the transportation board waffled when choosing a contractor to build the cars . Responding to criticisms of the commission , Grabinski contends that problems with the Green Line project were caused by traditional insider politics -- the result of officials from Los Angeles , the county and state pressuring the board to choose different contractors . * Grabinski ' s supporters hail his unflagging energy on the city ' s most pressing issues . For example , during last summer ' s effort to save the Long_Beach Naval Shipyard from closing , Grabinski was a vocal presence at almost every community meeting . Grabinski also counts himself at front of the effort to solve the city ' s violent gang problem and says he was the first city official , in 1986 , to call_for a citywide response . While on the council , he also pressed for more police and helped organize new Neighborhood Watch groups . &quot; He sees what needs to be done and goes_out and does_it , &quot; said Dave Denevan , who co-founded the California Heights group with Grabinski in 1980 . &quot; He takes_on a lot , but he ' s got big shoulders. &quot; Although O ' Neill does not have any connection to elective politics , she has no shortage of connections to civic_leaders . During her 31 years at Long_Beach City College -- where she went from music instructor to college president -- she helped establish a fund-raising foundation that taps prominent citizens for scholarships and grants . Over the past 16 years , the foundation has raised more_than $ 14 million . She also instituted monthly meetings and campus tours for business_executives , Navy officials and top city leaders . &quot; Whether she meant to or not , Beverly O ' Neill has laid the groundwork for political office , &quot; said Paul Schmidt , a political_science professor at Cal State Long_Beach . &quot; She is well-known among people in Long Beach. &quot; * It is unclear whether O ' Neill ' s lack of experience in city government will hurt her . Supporters say she comes_to the job well-prepared , with polished administrative skills earned while overseeing a $ 62-million budget , 30 # 000 students and 1 # 300 employees . &quot; My service to the community has been my entire career , &quot; she said . &quot; There isn ' t anything that prepares_for mayor as well as the position I have just held. &quot; It is_on this point -- her experience -- that Grabinski and his supporters level their most frequent attacks against O ' Neill . Describing City_Hall as a labyrinth of intrigues and competing political interests , they question whether a newcomer could effectively deal with nine council_members , a budget of almost $ 400 million , redevelopment , crime and the harbor . &quot; It ' s not easy to come_down here without any background and step into the role of a leader , &quot; said Councilman Thomas J . Clark , who has endorsed Grabinski . &quot; It does take a while to fill_in that void. &quot; Despite their differences , O ' Neill and Grabinski come from similarly modest beginnings . Grabinski was raised on Chicago ' s South_Side and in Oakland , Compton and North Long_Beach . He started working early , with his own pool-cleaning business at age 14 . O ' Neill grew_up not far from her current campaign headquarters on East Anaheim Street . Injuries to her father during World_War I left her mother as the family breadwinner , and O ' Neill worked her way through high_school as a department_store clerk . But here their histories diverge . Grabinski never finished college , instead becoming an Army sergeant ; O ' Neill studied music and art in Vienna . She earned a master ' s degree in counseling and a doctorate in education . She is married to a retired professor and has one grown daughter . * Grabinski , who sometimes still refers to himself as &quot; the pizza man , &quot; owned three Long_Beach restaurants ( one pizza_parlor , two delicatessens ) over 17 years . The last deli was closed four years after he was elected to the council in 1986 -- two years after his wife died of cancer . He has four adult sons . From community activist to councilman , Grabinski developed a reputation as a man of the people , a street_fighter on the issues he cares about . On the council , he is known for having a firm grasp of the issues and for a tendency , which he readily admits , to lengthy speechmaking . &quot; I think I ' m pretty simple , &quot; Grabinski said . &quot; I ' m not any kind of intellectual . I ' m goal-oriented and a hard_worker . I don ' t usually take no for an answer. &quot; O ' Neill , on the other hand , is described by many former employees as an administrator with a velvet touch . O ' Neill calls herself a coalition builder and says her strength lies_in her ability to bring competing factions together . Several administrators and teachers at Long_Beach City College say O ' Neill helped usher_in an era of unity on campus when she took_over as president in 1988 -- especially after expanding a council that brought_together leaders of the school ' s employee unions , students and administrators to discuss problems . Perhaps most important , she was a visible president , often showing_up at student plays and concerts -- a dramatic change from her predecessors , who were often accused of being aloof . O ' Neill was known to attend faculty baby showers and to send flowers to those who had suffered a loss . &quot; She was revered at this school , &quot; said Bob Kariger , a former vice_president of academic affairs . &quot; She was about as close as a president could be to being_on a pedestal. &quot; * Some political observers say the O ' Neill-Grabinski race could come_down to an east_side versus west_side contest . O ' Neill , who lives_on the Alamitos Bay peninsula , captured east_side districts in the primary , whereas Grabinski , a central Long_Beach resident , won_over the western and northern parts of the city . If the same holds true on Tuesday , O ' Neill might have the advantage because there are more registered voters in the city ' s wealthier east_side districts . The two were the top vote-getters in the April primary . O ' Neill captured 23 % of the vote while Grabinski garnered 21 % . The winner will replace Ernie Kell , who has been the only mayor since Long_Beach voters made the job a full-time elected position in 1988 . Kell finished fifth in April . He has not endorsed a candidate . Former candidate Frank Colonna , a Belmont Shore businessman who placed a close third in the primary , has backed O ' Neill . For his part , Grabinski has the support of the police_officers union . Some political insiders predict that O ' Neill may have an edge because voters are weary of incumbents . But most observers say the race is still too close to call , and that it could remain that way into election night .</TEXT>
