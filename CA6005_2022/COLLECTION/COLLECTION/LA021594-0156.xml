   <TEXT> Aretha Franklin ' s name doesn ' t buy her much luck with automobiles . Twice in the past year , this 25-year-old single mom from Lake Forest -- no relation_to the famous rhythm and blues singer -- has found herself by the side of the road , broken down , alone . Then came the Northridge earthquake , and Franklin decided it was time to buy a cellular_phone . &quot; I saw those cars stranded , and I thought , ' They should have a phone in the car , ' &quot; said Franklin , who is a marketing representative for the credit_union at El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station . &quot; I ' ve shown my 7-year-old son how to use it. &quot; Cellular phones are growing in popularity as emergency lifelines , according to electronics dealers . Regular telephone_service was knocked_out for more_than 12 hours in parts of Los Angeles County following the Jan . 17 quake . Ken Swain , a manager for West Coast Auto Sound in Tustin , said that 50 % of his cellular_phone sales are for emergency use now , compared with about 20 % at this time last year . Most of the others are used in business . Subscribers can order either emergency or business phone_service -- emergency service requires a lower monthly payment , but higher per-minute charges than phones used for business . Usually , emergency service carries a $ 25-per-month charge and costs 90 cents per minute for daytime use . There is no charge for calls to 911 on the PacTel Cellular system . One of the company ' s most popular plans for business users is based on a $ 70-per-month basic payment , which entitles the user to 80 free minutes ; beyond that , the cost is 41 cents per minute in the daytime . The phones themselves run from about $ 100 to more_than $ 500 . Sales of cellular_phones are up by 35 % since the Northridge quake , said Ray Khorramian , owner of Converse Connections in Lake Forest . While beepers are popular among less affluent customers seeking to stay in touch -- basic models are $ 20 to $ 120 -- they don ' t provide the flexibility of a cellular_phone . The beepers have not proven as popular , Khorramian said , because a person cannot use them to dial immediately for a call . &quot; Most people want to be able to reach emergency services , &quot; he said . He said many customers are women , or men who say they are buying them for the women in their lives . Steven L . Schandler , professor of psychology at Chapman University in Orange , observed that people don ' t want to be out of touch . &quot; What we have now is a tremendous swelling of insecurity , &quot; he said . &quot; Being in a period of constant crisis is not normal for Californians. &quot; PacTel Cellular , which serves the greater Los Angeles area from its Irvine office , has awakened to the use of cellular_phones as emergency tools . &quot; It used to be a tool for improving ( business ) productivity , &quot; spokeswoman Melissa May said . She said her company has organized a system of cells on wheels . These can be brought into a disaster_area when the regular cells , which are like broadcast towers that relay signals , are damaged . Just a ( Cellular ) Phone_Call Away Consumers have discovered that cellular_phones are good for more_than wheeling and dealing . Families are buying them for the ability to reach loved ones in an emergency , regardless of location . Here is a short course in cellular basics : THE PHONE Equipment is sold at small retail shops specializing in cellular equipment and at_large consumer electronics stores . Most stores are also authorized agents of PacTel Cellular or L.A. Cellular and will activate , program and repair the phones . -- Makers : Top manufacturers include Motorola , Nokia , AudioVox , Oki , Fujitsu , Panasonic and Mitsubishi . -- Price : $ 100- $ 700 -- Activation : Before a cellular_phone can be activated and assigned a number , the buyer must get approval from PacTel Cellular or L.A. Cellular . A $ 200- $ 1 # 000 deposit may be required , depending_on credit history . There is also a onetime activation fee of about $ 50 per phone , but some stores include this in the purchase_price . MONTHLY SERVICE A variety of plans are available . Here are some PacTel examples : 04 # 25 , 16 # 17 , 19 Monthly access Peak period * Off-peak period * * Plan charge rate per minute rate per minute Personal Communications $ 25 90 cents 20 cents ( Emergency ) Plan Basic Plan $ 45 45 cents 27 cents Premium Plan * * * $ 239 45 cents 27 cents Discount Plans A variety of plans are available for high-volume users , but most require a 12-month subscription agreement .
