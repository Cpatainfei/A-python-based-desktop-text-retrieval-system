   <HEADLINE> SIMI SCHOOL PANEL TO DISCUSS CHARGING FOR BUSING_SERVICE ; EDUCATION : BOARD WILL ALSO DEBATE MOVING ATHLETICS FROM SIXTH PERIOD TO AFTER SCHOOL SO PLAYERS CAN BE CHARGED FOR OUT-OF-TOWN GAMES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Faced with the need to cut $ 2.5 million from next year ' s budget , Simi Valley school_board members tonight will discuss becoming the second district in Ventura County to charge parents for home-to-school busing . Under the plan , parents would pay $ 300 per year to bus one child and $ 200 , $ 100 and $ 50 for subsequent children . The move would reduce busing ' s nearly $ 500 # 000 drain on the general fund by $ 194 # 250 , officials said . The transportation fees will be considered among several proposed changes . Another significant proposal would move athletics from sixth period to after school so officials could legally charge those students extra for transportation to out-of-town games . Removing varsity sports from the regular school_day would save the district $ 175 # 000 in teacher costs . Requiring parents or booster clubs to pay_for extracurricular busing would shave another $ 98 # 500 , officials said . Board_members have been holding special budget meetings in the last few months to come_up with reductions that a majority could support . More proposals will be brought_to regular board_meetings as they are hashed out , officials said . &quot; Basically , we ' re taking it in bite-size pieces , &quot; said board_member Judy Barry . The district needs to cut about $ 2.5 million to refill its empty savings account and balance next year ' s general fund budget at $ 77.1 million . Reserves have been depleted because the state has not granted cost-of-living increases for four years , officials said . &quot; These are difficult choices to make , but it ' s a matter of determining priorities , &quot; Supt . Mary Beth Wolford said . &quot; We would like to keep doing all_of the things we ' re doing now , but we can ' t . that ' s where the frustration comes in. &quot; * If the board agrees on cuts tonight , the proposals would be brought_back for a formal vote at the next regular meeting Feb . 1 , said Assistant Supt . Ralph Wilson . He said anyone interested in the budget_cuts up for review is encouraged to speak_to the board tonight , Wilson said . &quot; This board discussion is basically to give the community a chance to react a little bit , &quot; Wilson said . Other cuts_up for review would eliminate the student welfare and attendance counselor , a position created this school_year to work with students who have unexcused absences or are_on the brink of dropping_out . The cut would save $ 61 # 456 . Another proposal would cut teacher advisers , who spend one or two class periods a day working with students showing behavioral problems . If all teacher advisers positions were eliminated , the district would save about $ 400 # 000 . If the transportation fees are approved , officials estimate that ridership would drop from 1 # 439 students to 1 # 150 as parents choose to car-pool or find less expensive alternatives to busing . However , a survey several months ago did not show significant community opposition to busing fees , officials said . If too few students pay to ride the bus , officials might have to consider eliminating transportation , said board_member Doug Crosse . &quot; We ' re doing this as a first_step , &quot; Crosse said . School districts are mandated to bus special_education students to school . In addition , officials say a legal challenge to bus fees for athletes could be made if sports stays part of the regular school_day , Wolford said . Students could argue that they cannot be charged for bus trips to athletic_games because they are entitled to a free public education in all subject_areas studied during school hours , Wolford said . The Conejo Valley Unified School District is the only other school_system in the county to charge parents for bus transportation . Additional cuts are being explored in negotiations with various employee groups , including early retirement and a cap on overtime , Wolford said . Future proposals could call_for reducing office workers at junior_high and high_schools ; lowering salaries and cutting counselors and psychologists .</TEXT>
