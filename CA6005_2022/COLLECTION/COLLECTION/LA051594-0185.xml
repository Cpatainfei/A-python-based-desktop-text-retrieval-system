   <HEADLINE> BAHAI PERSECUTION AS GLOBAL AS FAITH ' S REACH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> They ' ve been branded as infidels and executed . Even their graves have been desecrated . Among all world religions , the Bahai faith is one of the most geographically widespread and most persecuted . Bahai communities are found in more_than 200 countries and island territories . The 5.5 million Bahais believe_in the equality and unity of the human family ' s 5.5 billion people and their religions . The largest Bahai community , about 1.2 million , is in predominantly Hindu India . The second-largest group , 300 # 000 to 350 # 000 , forms the biggest non-Islamic religious minority in Shiite Muslim Iran . Nowhere are the Bahai more oppressed than in this Persian land , where their religion was born in the mid-19th Century . Followers of the prophet-founder Baha ' Allah , Arabic for the &quot; Glory of God , &quot; were persecuted from the beginning . Baha ' Allah , born in Tehran , is revered as the latest of a series of divine_messengers that includes Jesus , Mohammed , Zoroaster and Buddha . The Bahai are targets of religious persecution to this day , in the judgment of the U.N. human_rights commission and the U.S. State_Department . &quot; Their leaders have been killed or forced to leave the country , &quot; says Andrew Whitley , director of the New York-based Middle_East Watch . Bahais are barred from jobs in government and state-owned industries , Iran ' s largest employers . It is illegal for infidels to receive money from an Islamic government . Pensions are confiscated and revoked . Higher education is forbidden . Travel and passports are restricted . &quot; If these conditions continue for a century , it would turn the people into paupers . The Bahais would become the Iranian untouchables , &quot; says Firuz Kazemzadeh , professor emeritus of Russian history at Yale_University . Kazemzadeh was born into a Bahai family and has been an elected member of the Bahai ' s U.S. governing body for 31 years . &quot; The Bahai faith is under pressure in much of the Muslim world , &quot; Kazemzadeh says . &quot; The religion was completely destroyed in Iraq over the last 25 to 30 years. &quot; In Iran , organized Bahai activities are prohibited . No Bahai structure is left . Since 1979 , when the Islamic fundamentalist regime seized power , 216 Bahais have been killed in Iran . Most of them were religious_leaders . &quot; These weren ' t random killings , &quot; Kazemzadeh says . &quot; It was a deliberate attempt to behead the community , like shooting all_the Roman_Catholic bishops of a country . The persecution is the worst since the mid-19th Century , when 20 # 000 Bahais died for their faith . This steady , determined campaign to destroy the Bahai community I have called genocide by attrition. &quot; Because of pressure and publicity from the United Nations and international human_rights organizations , large-scale executions and street killings have stopped , Whitley says . The last confirmed execution was in 1992 . &quot; They have been persecuted in every conceivable way , &quot; says Robert Henderson , secretary_general of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahai of the United States , whose only North_American temple is in Wilmette , Ill . Worldwide , religious persecution is most severe in Iran and other Islamic fundamentalist nations , says the State_Department ' s 1993 human_rights report on 193 countries . In Iran , the penalty for converting to Christianity is death . Christians also suffer major obstacles to freedom of worship in Iraq , Sudan and Somalia . The seven Bahai houses_of_worship span the globe . They are in such diverse places as Panama , Germany , Uganda , Australia and Western_Samoa . The Bahai international center sits in Haifa , Israel , which was part of Palestine when the exiled prophet Baha ' Allah spent the last 24 years of his life there , dying in 1892 . &quot; Although our numbers are still small , our spread throughout the world is intentional . The principles of our religion are universalist , &quot; Kazemzadeh says . The Bahai have no organized hierarchy of clergy , no sects or divisions . Everyone follows the written , unchanged teachings of the divine_messenger . The most vital challenge facing the 120 # 000 U.S. Bahais , Henderson says , is eliminating racism in this country . Bahais set_up communities without cultural barriers . They work hard at achieving integration that is more_than just acceptance . Twenty years ago there was a deliberate campaign to reach rural black communities in the South . Today the largest U.S. Bahai communities are in California and South Carolina . Whether at the United Nations or on a Pacific island , says Kit Bigelow Cosby , deputy director of the Bahai external affairs office in Washington , D.C. , &quot; every Bahai is dedicated to establishing peace on the planet. &quot;</TEXT>
