   <HEADLINE> UKRAINE WILL TRY TO REVIVE WEAPONS INDUSTRY , LAWMAKERS SAY ; ECONOMY : NEW PRESIDENT MAY WORK WITH RUSSIA TO IMPROVE SHARE OF EXPORT MARKET . DEAL WITH IRAN IN ' 93 REPORTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President-elect Leonid Kuchma will try to boost this nation ' s moribund economy by reviving its military industries and teaming_up with Russia to grab a bigger share of the arms export market , Ukrainian lawmakers said Tuesday . Experts here say Ukraine ' s weapons industry , which largely ground to a halt after the collapse of the Soviet_Union , has revived somewhat and that new automatic_rifles and highly accurate short-range missiles are being built at Yuzhmash , the gigantic rocket factory in Dnepropetrovsk that Kuchma headed before becoming prime_minister in 1992 . Kuchma , 55 , defeated President Leonid Kravchuk in Sunday ' s elections to become independent Ukraine ' s second president . Kuchma , who is_due to take_office next Tuesday , campaigned against a &quot; suicidal course of isolation from Russia &quot; and courted Ukrainian military support . A report released last month by the campaign of Ivan Pliushch , a rival presidential candidate and former Speaker of Parliament , asserted that in May , 1993 , during Kuchma ' s tenure as prime_minister , Ukraine gave Iran 50 MIG-29 fighter-bombers , 20 tanks and eight &quot; super-modern &quot; anti-ship missiles in exchange for Iranian oil . After the Soviet breakup , former CIA Director Robert M . Gates warned that Iran had a long shopping list of Soviet-made weapons , including MIG-29 planes . Ukrainian officials have made a series of contradictory and Delphic comments about whether weapons were sold to Iran . Before the oil deal , some Ukrainian officials said the swap might involve military supplies , while Pliushch said that Ukraine would not swap weapons for the oil but would give Iran commodities instead . Afterward , Kravchuk neither confirmed nor denied a weapons swap and other officials were equally evasive . &quot; Ukraine does not trade arms with U.N.-sanctioned countries , &quot; Deputy Foreign Minister Boris Tarasiuk said in December . &quot; I can ' t say there are grounds for distress over massive sales of arms to Iran . But rumors of anti-ship missiles for the Iranian navy are not true. &quot; A 1993 Ukrainian government decree made information about weapons sales a state secret . A U.S. source said the government had &quot; no evidence &quot; of Ukrainian arms sales to Iran . * Russian analyst Andrei V . Kortunov of Moscow ' s USA-Canada Institute said Ukraine is believed to have sold &quot; a_few dozen tanks &quot; to Iran . But Russia got_wind of the deal and elbowed Ukraine out of a deal for several hundred more tanks by promising Iran parts and service , he said . Though more expensive , the Russian deal gave Iran vital maintenance guarantees that Ukraine could not offer . A Clinton_Administration official and other experts said Iran has bartered with Russia and other former Soviet republics for weapons , including MIGs and tanks . But these sources said the figure of 50 MIGs was probably too high . As of 1993 , Iran ' s air_force consisted_of 210 planes , including at least 30 MIG-29s . With its economy in a shambles , Ukraine may find it difficult to turn_down buyers that the West considers troublesome . The Pliushch report states that India , once one of the biggest clients for Soviet weapons and still on an arms-buying spree , is offering Kiev a long-term credit of up_to $ 7.5 billion to &quot; orient its military exports on India and cooperate in the production of strategic weapons , particularly fighter-bombers , submarines , tanks and rockets. &quot; Last year , Russia reluctantly abandoned a deal to sell commercial satellite technology to India because of U.S. insistence that the launch-ballistics technology could help India deliver missiles . Ukraine ' s military-industrial complex , which includes tank factories , naval_shipyards , aerospace and missile plants and other high-tech military research and development facilities , employs 2.5 million of its 52 million citizens . During the presidential campaign , Kuchma often noted that 70 % of this vast industrial net once relied_on supplies , parts , fuel and orders from Moscow . With overall industrial production plunging 40 % last year , Ukraine cannot afford to lose its profitable weapons markets and must team_up with Russia to sell its wares , Kuchma said . &quot; Most of Ukraine ' s economic ties with Russia were through the military-industrial complex , &quot; opposition lawmaker Ivan Zayets said . &quot; Renewing those ties means building weapons. &quot; Russian officials also see their arms and aerospace industries as the sectors that are most competitive on the world market -- and they are unlikely to want to share their arms clients with Ukraine . By stressing cooperation , not competition , with Russia , Kuchma may be hoping to get a piece of the lucrative market from which Ukraine might otherwise be shut_out . Now that Kuchma has been elected president , Kortunov said it is possible that Ukraine and Russia will shelve their competition and work together to boost arms sales . &quot; Naturally there are forces in Russia quite interested in such cooperation , &quot; he said . Few Ukrainians are likely to complain . * &quot; This could fill our budgetary holes , &quot; said economist and lawmaker Volodymyr Pylypchuk . He complained that Ukraine ' s excess arsenal -- the Soviet_Union left it with 6 # 300 tanks -- is not being sold but turned_into scrap metal to comply with treaties reducing conventional forces in Europe . &quot; We sawed up 140 tanks last year , &quot; Pylypchuk said . &quot; Even if we had sold them at bargain prices , we would have no budget deficit. &quot; In fact , the Pliushch report viewed arms sales as objectionable only if they gave Russia too_much leverage over the Ukrainian economy . &quot; Ukraine will become an appendage of the Russian military industry and will lose the chance to independently enter the international weapons market , &quot; the report warned . * Times staff writer Efron reported from Moscow and Times special correspondent Mycio from Kiev . Times staff writer Robin Wright in Washington contributed to this report .</TEXT>
