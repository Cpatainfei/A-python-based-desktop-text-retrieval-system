   <HEADLINE> U.S. PROPOSES MASSIVE EFFORT TO SAVE EVERGLADES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The federal_government Wednesday proposed a massive replumbing of much of South Florida to save the Everglades . In a 1 # 945-page report , the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers laid_out options for restoring the hydrologic conditions that existed before urban and agricultural development decimated one of the world ' s largest marshes . The Corps did not endorse any of the six complex options for re-engineering water flow . All aim to re-create conditions similar to those that existed when the &quot; River of Grass &quot; flowed unimpeded in a 60-mile-wide swath , creating rich habitat for millions of birds , reptiles and mammals . But environmentalists hope that the Corps and other federal and state agencies involved in Everglades restoration , a Clinton_Administration priority , will endorse the most ambitious plan . That blueprint , in addition to rearranging levees and canals , calls_for a broad &quot; flowway &quot; of water through the Everglades Agricultural Area and the construction of large water-reserve areas .</TEXT>
