   <HEADLINE> CASTING LIGHT ON A NEW LIFE ; THE UPBEAT ABSTRACT PAINTINGS BY HIDEO NODA BELIE THE DARK DAYS BEHIND HIM . HE SAYS , ' WHEN I PAINT , I FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hideo Noda ' s art doesn ' t really tell his story . The bright , colorful , cheery paintings of flowers and trees set against ocean and sky in his exhibit at New Canyon Gallery don ' t betray a hint of the turmoil of his early years . There ' s no sense of the two years he spent doing hard labor in a prisoner-of-war camp in Siberia after World_War_II . They don ' t reflect life in late-1940s Japan , when he went_back to his home on an island near Hiroshima . &quot; As a POW , you ' re just like a slave , &quot; said Noda , 71 . In snow up_to his knees , he was forced to build houses and work in the mines and on the railroad . &quot; Everything in my life was so dark , &quot; he said . In his art , as demonstrated in the exhibit &quot; Hideo Noda : Abstract Japanese Paintings , &quot; he tries &quot; to get another side , which is light . Most of it is imagination . You have to have imagination , &quot; he said . Noda was born to Japanese parents in Phoenix , Ariz. , in 1922 . When he was 9 years old , his father died in a car accident . After that , Noda ' s mother moved with her six children to Japan . In 1943 , Noda was drafted into the Japanese army and sent to fight in China . Two years later , as the war was coming_to an end , his unit was captured in Manchuria by the Russian army . After his release in 1947 , Noda returned to his home near Hiroshima and began to paint , something he had enjoyed doing since he was a grammar_school student . He remembers &quot; only a concrete building here and there &quot; on devastated Hiroshima , with nothing in-between , he said . In 1951 , Noda moved_back to the United States , going_to work as a &quot; house boy &quot; in San Francisco . He also took painting classes at San Francisco City College . In 1955 , he moved to Los Angeles and got a job washing dishes at Lawry ' s Prime Rib restaurant . A year later he became a landscape_gardener . Noda , a Westside resident , still tends gardens four days a week . The other three days he paints . &quot; You get_to his age and lose a little drive . He hasn ' t seemed to lose any drive , &quot; said Howard Craig , president of New Canyon Gallery and a member of the committee that juried Noda into the gallery cooperative and gave him the opportunity to do a show . &quot; We liked his enthusiasm , his style , and we were really impressed by the fact that he had been painting for 50 years. &quot; Although many artists who live_in temperate climates enjoy painting outdoors , Noda takes that activity to unusual heights . He hauls his canvases and paint up onto the roof of his house by ladder and works there . The splashy , splattering painting techniques he uses in his works would mess_up the studio , he said . &quot; I don ' t have the space in the back yard . And I have a dog , &quot; he said . Besides , &quot; the paintings dry much faster on the roof. &quot; After finishing the abstract backgrounds of his compositions on the roof , he brings the canvases into his studio to paint the detail of the foregrounds . He works_on five to 10 canvases at one time . Noda has 500 paintings in storage , many of them done_in styles significantly different from the 20 hanging_in the gallery . One can get a sense of his diverse painting abilities from two books of color photographs of his work that accompany the show , the first public display of his work . &quot; I thought I was going_to keep them all , &quot; he said . &quot; They ' re like your children. &quot; He decided to begin showing his paintings when a landscaping client bought one and encouraged him to share his work with others . But it is not the potential for_sales that motivates Noda to continue to paint . It is the sheer joy of doing_it . &quot; When I paint , I forget about everything , &quot; he said . Where and When What : &quot; Hideo Noda : Abstract Japanese Paintings. &quot; Location : New Canyon Gallery , 129 S . Topanga Canyon Blvd. , Topanga . Hours : 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Wednesday , Friday and Saturday ; 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Sunday . Ends July 17 . Call : ( 310 ) 455-3923 .</TEXT>
