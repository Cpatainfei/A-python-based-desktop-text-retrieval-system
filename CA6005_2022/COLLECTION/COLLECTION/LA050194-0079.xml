   <HEADLINE> GOOD TO KNOW LOVE CAN SURVIVE THE BIG FIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Making_up is Hard to Do &quot; by Elizabeth Mehren in Life &amp; Style ( April 25 ) was interestingly written and probably comforting for many couples who now know they are not alone in their major conflicts . But I want to assure young couples just beginning what they hope will be a lifelong relationship that &quot; the five-alarm fight &quot; is not a nasty fact of life . My first marriage of about 15 years , although ending in divorce , was free from such conflicts , and my present 19-year marriage is most satisfying and conflict-free . So , for those of you looking_forward to a long , satisfying relationship free_of dramatic ups and downs , take_heart -- it can and does happen . BEVERLY E . ADAIR Los Angeles</TEXT>
