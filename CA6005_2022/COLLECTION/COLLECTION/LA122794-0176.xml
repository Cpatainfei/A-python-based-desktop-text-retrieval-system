   <TEXT> Carla Stumpf sat on her back_porch , feeling the first jolts of labor pain . It was then that she sensed her husband ' s presence nearby , as if he had returned to tell her how he had died . &quot; I was a man and I was a soldier and I was fighting a war within myself , &quot; he seemed to say . &quot; I died in combat. &quot; When he died , Sgt . Richard Edward Stumpf Jr . was 24 , six years a member of the U.S. Marine Corps , a veteran of the Persian_Gulf_War and for two years a drill_instructor . He was brash and he sought adventure and he loved derring-do . He liked to swim and to cook and , oh , how he loved to drink beer . He was a happy torrent of a man , broad-shouldered and blue-eyed , with a booming voice that could shake a barracks full of Marines . But Stumpf had a darker side . He pushed himself unforgivingly . He pulled long hours on the drill field . He was tortured by even the smallest mistake . He feared he could not handle the added responsibility of a child ; he anguished over separation from his family and betrayal by the Marine Corps . And so crumbled the once rock-hard Marine that was Rich Stumpf . One morning in October , he walked into the Indoor Combat Training Pool at Parris Island , S.C. He climbed atop the diving_board . He tossed his hat into the water and he placed an M-16 service rifle under his chin . Before 200 Marines and Marine recruits , in his Marine uniform on a Marine base , Stumpf pulled the trigger . Who was he ? For the nation ' s military , he became another statistic , another line on a press_release about the high number of suicides among service members , particularly Marines . His death and others are being examined by Pentagon officials hoping to determine whether , by improving psychological and other support programs , future suicides might be prevented . &quot; Each one is investigated very , very carefully to get a sense of what may have caused it , &quot; said Undersecretary of Defense Edwin Dorn . Making_sense of Stumpf ' s journey to life ' s end will not be easy . He was complex and sometimes rash , often inexplicable in his sudden turns of emotion . Even after his body was lowered into a grave in the national cemetery in Bourne , Mass. , his death baffles . To some , he died making an angry statement against the Marine Corps , a sort of &quot; Here ' s to you for driving me to do this. &quot; &quot; He was obviously striking back at something he loved the most , &quot; said Carl Peterson , a former career Marine and a municipal judge who visited Stumpf on his last weekend , in a jail drunk tank . But Depot Sgt . Maj . James E . Moore , who supervised Stumpf ' s drill instruction , said it was impossible to &quot; really , really tell who he was angry at. &quot; He thinks_of Stumpf and he asks : &quot; My God , what could cause a person to do that , and to do_it in that way ? &quot; Lt . Cmdr . Charles Quarles , a chaplain who counsels troubled Marines , tried to draw Stumpf out of his depression in his last month at Parris Island . &quot; It ' s very possible he was mad at the Marines , &quot; Quarles said . &quot; It ' s extremely possible . It makes_sense . It ' s logical . But is it the truth ? Who knows ? I think he was a man in a lot of pain for a lot of reasons. &quot; In Arcadia , where his widow and 2-month-old son now must build their life without him , they will always suspect that the military , combined with Stumpf ' s own desire to be the best Marine , sent him to an early death . &quot; If I ' m angry at the Marines , it ' s only because they put the weapon in his hand , &quot; Carla Stumpf said . &quot; They could have prevented that . But ultimately , the decision to do what he did was his. &quot; She met him in high_school . He had moved to Florida with his family from Connecticut . He loved to swim and hunt seashells . He performed magic_tricks . He liked movies with plenty of action and food with lots of garlic . He learned to cook and to bake bread . He had a Doberman_pinscher named Drock , said his father , Richard E . Stumpf Sr . He and Carla began dating at age 15 in Sarasota , Fla . Like all things , he threw himself completely into their courtship . He painted &quot; I Love Carla &quot; across his bedroom wall . He also discovered beer , fast cars and a knack for ditching school . He graduated from Riverview High only after repeating his senior year . &quot; He was looking_for the biggest challenge he could find , &quot; Carla said . &quot; Some guidance and a place to fit_in . He wanted to go where he could find some adventure . And once he joined the Marines , he knew that was his destiny. &quot; Enlisting in 1988 , he was sent to boot camp at Parris Island . He excelled_at swimming . To toughen him up , they made him march_on all fours . He loved to push his body , the building of a man , the long hours , the long march and always the challenge . He graduated 13th in a class of 85 recruits . Seemingly overnight , the kid was a Marine . A year later , he married Carla in a ceremony at the Ringling Circus Museum in Sarasota , the bridegroom resplendent in his dress_uniform . But his dedication , even then , tilted more to the Corps . He had her name and a rose tattooed on his left arm , but on his right shoulder_in big letters was &quot; USMC. &quot; And below that , the Marine Corps symbol : the eagle , globe and anchor . Inside Carla ' s wedding_ring , he inscribed the Marine Corps motto : Semper fidelis . It was always the Marines , and Carla would often feel second in her husband ' s devotion . It was a situation she would have to cope_with during their long periods apart . Just a year into their marriage , he volunteered for the Persian_Gulf_War . For eight months , he served as a squad leader in the Marine infantry but still found time to play the mischievous boy in a man ' s war . He refused to take drugs to ward_off chemical illnesses . Once his squad ran_off with an Iraqi ambulance . He passed_out M &amp; Ms sent from home . &quot; He was one of the first to go and one of the last to come_back , &quot; Carla remembered . &quot; If he hadn ' t served there , he would have been even more tortured . He was not afraid to die . Through my entire life with him , he made that clear to me and everyone . He was going_to die with that uniform on. &quot; He came_home not a casualty , but a hero nonetheless . At his parents ' First Methodist_Church in Meriden , Conn. , he stood_up in uniform to the applause of the congregation . He gave a brief speech about duty and honor , and vowed that as long as there were Saddam Husseins in this world , he would always be a Marine . He cried that day , a crack in his tough Marine armor . &quot; He wanted to be the picture-perfect Marine , &quot; said his mother , Mary Stumpf . &quot; He strove . He was never content with any particular rank . He had to just go_for the next and the next and the next. &quot; He and Carla would separate again . He went_to the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo , Cuba , for three months to help process Cuban and Haitian refugees . When he returned , they bought a house at Camp Lejeune , N.C. Then came another separation when he left Carla at_home for a choice assignment as a drill_instructor 100 miles down the coast at Parris Island . To make_it through training_school , he learned 75 pages of drill movement , proved himself again on the field , underwent a dozen uniform inspections and memorized countless Marine Corps rules and regulations . But the rewards could be high . Two years as a drill_instructor would mean a shot at meritorious promotions and special consideration for assignments . He would be gone all day and many nights , working , training , drilling boys into men . He would love it . &quot; The only thing I want to do is better the Marine Corps , &quot; he told the Navy Times in an interview last February . &quot; I wanted to come_down here and put 110 % into these kids so that when they get_out in the streets , they ' ll have a role_model to look_back at and be able to keep that esprit de corps flowing through their veins. &quot; And drill school wasn ' t that tough , anyway . &quot; I ' m not a scholar or anything , &quot; he said . &quot; I had my few beers during the week and did what I had to do. &quot; For 20 months he was alone with his Marines . In July , his relatives attended a recruit graduation . One recruit , Pfc . Joseph L . Gillick , suddenly broke_down in tears in front of his drill_instructor . Asked later why he was so moved , Gillick barked back in Marine cadence : &quot; That man is Sgt . Richard Stumpf . He changed my life. &quot; Carla was pregnant by then . They decided that in September she would move to Arcadia to be with her mother , Judith Leipold , to await their first baby . Stumpf would join them on the due_date . But by the end of summer his mood began to darken . In phone conversations , he would not tell Carla why he was depressed . Instead , he rambled , once suggesting that they legally separate , several times hinting that she would have to raise the baby alone . And then he began to doubt the Marine Corps . &quot; He knew what the Marine Corps expected of him , and he pushed himself even further , &quot; she said . &quot; We were talking every day . It was all about him and his state_of_mind . He was constantly saying he was overwhelmed . He felt he had let himself down . He said he wanted out of Parris Island , something I never thought I ' d hear from him . He called it a hellhole. &quot; She begged him to seek counseling , but Marines mask their emotions . He was drinking more , and , when only the happy-go-lucky Stumpf shined forth , no one suspected any problems . &quot; He was very fun-loving , he liked to have fun , &quot; said Michelle Russom , a bartender at the Port Royal Pub , an after-hours spot for Parris Island Marines . She had met him in those last weeks and never once thought he was depressed . Others missed it too . &quot; On two occasions that I spoke with him , he said nothing , &quot; Moore said . Added Staff Sgt . Troy Stables , who once supervised Stumpf at Parris Island : &quot; The week before , he was fine . He was laughing and joking. &quot; On Friday , Oct . 28 , he slammed his yellow Volkswagen Beetle into another car in Beaufort , S.C. , near the base . He was arrested for driving while intoxicated . The accident occurred at 10:30 p.m. , and he told police he had had &quot; eight beers before leaving Parris Island at 4:30 and had been drinking ever since. &quot; At the police_station , he couldn ' t understand the simplest directions for taking a Breathalyzer test . Finally , he tested at a blood-alcohol level of . 22 , more_than double the legal limit . He was jailed overnight . Judge Peterson visited him the next day to set bail . He saw a Marine at the end of his career . A retired Marine himself , Peterson knew all too well how a drunk driving charge could end a career in today ' s military . Looking_at Stumpf in his cell , in his orange jail jumper rather than his shiny Marine uniform , he saw &quot; a guy who was a sergeant , who had been_on the selection list for staff_sergeant , who probably had once been_on the right track. &quot; Stumpf called Carla shortly before he was released on Saturday , Oct . 29 . He was paranoid about his Marine superiors . &quot; They ' re watching me , &quot; he told her . &quot; They ' re waiting for me to screw_up . They ' re trying to get me. &quot; Carla was frantic . &quot; I think by that point his mind was made_up . There were tears in his voice. &quot; Three times she called the base and urged his commanders to immediately send him to counseling . She said they did not understand him , that he would not be able to cope_with the arrest , that he needed help now . She said she was told that counseling would begin first thing Monday , Oct . 31 . But on Monday morning , Stumpf went instead to the base armory and checked_out the M-16 rifle . Then to the pool and the diving_board . One shot under the chin , and his body toppled into the water . None of the startled Marines realized at first what had happened . Then the water turned red . Stables prepared him for burial in his dress blue uniform and white gloves . He shined Stumpf ' s shoes and brass , and he escorted the coffin to the cemetery in Massachusetts . Carla never saw her husband ' s body . She had gone_into labor , and , on the day of the funeral , at the moment taps were sounded over the grave , she gave_birth to their son , Asher Richard Edward Stumpf . Asher , from the Bible , means &quot; happy one. &quot;</TEXT>
