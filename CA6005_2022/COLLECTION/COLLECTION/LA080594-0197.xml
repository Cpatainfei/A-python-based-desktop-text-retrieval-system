   <HEADLINE> ARTICLE REINFORCED A MISCONCEPTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> I am a science_teacher who constantly attempts to dispel myths concerning evolution and how organisms change_over time . Therefore I was disappointed in your July 28 article concerning the pygmy mammoth fossil found in the Channel Islands.The article said that once the woolly_mammoths were_on the islands &quot; they began to shrink. &quot; A paleontologist was quoted as saying , &quot; When large animals stay_on an island they usually become smaller. &quot; People need to understand that animals do not just &quot; shrink &quot; and &quot; become smaller &quot; for lack of anything better to do on a small island . In reality , if it is beneficial for the smaller of the species to survive , they will reproduce with their small genes and create more small animals . The larger ones will become extinct as will their large genes , thus creating a new population of smaller organisms over time . This simple concept is the basis of evolution and natural_selection . I am positive Jim Mead , the paleontologist quoted , was speaking in layman ' s terms . But the article should have clarified his statement . The idea that organisms spontaneously modify themselves is such a common misconception that as an educator I am frustrated to see it constantly reinforced . DEBRA LEITER Ventura</TEXT>
