   <HEADLINE> CHINA FLOUTS NUCLEAR MORATORIUM WITH TEST ; ASIA : UNDERGROUND EXPLOSION HAD BEEN DELAYED UNTIL U.S. RENEWED ITS FAVORED TRADING STATUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the second time in eight months , China defied an international moratorium on nuclear testing by setting_off an underground nuclear_explosion Friday at a remote site in western China . The blast -- estimated by seismologists to be of medium yield , 10 to 60 kilotons -- had been predicted for weeks by U.S. and Japanese intelligence agencies , which spotted preparations under way for the test at Lop Nor in Xinjiang province . The Chinese government delayed the test until after the June 4 deadline set by President Clinton for renewal of most-favored-nation trading status for China . Despite objections from human_rights organizations , Clinton authorized the renewal in late May . Ironically , the test Friday was conducted at_the_same_time the Chinese leadership was being urged by the United States and other countries to take a leading role in pressuring North_Korea to allow international inspections of its nuclear facilities , where many fear Pyongyang has an embryonic nuclear_weapons program . Earlier this week , Chinese leaders met with North_Korean army Chief_of_Staff Choi Gwang and , separately , with South_Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung Joo in an effort to resolve the crisis over North_Korea ' s refusal to allow international inspection of its nuclear facilities . Japanese Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa arrives Sunday for similar discussions . In a break_with tradition , China announced the test itself . In an official release , the government said it will continue to participate in negotiations with other nuclear_powers seeking a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty . Patricia Lewis , director of the Verification Technology Information Center in London , a nuclear proliferation watchdog organization , said the Chinese test &quot; could set_back comprehensive nuclear test ban talks by months. &quot; &quot; It will also strengthen the hand of hard-liners in France who are pushing for a resumption of nuclear testing in the Pacific , &quot; Lewis said . The test , China ' s second since Oct . 5 , 1993 , threatened to disrupt the fragile moratorium on nuclear testing established by the United States , France and Russia in 1992 when they began talks seeking a comprehensive test ban agreement . In January , China joined with the other powers in talks in Geneva seeking a test ban treaty by 1995 . In its news release Friday announcing the test , the Chinese government said it still &quot; supports the conclusion of such treaty no later than 1996. &quot; Western military experts have downplayed the significance of China ' s nuclear program , which they say is still in the early stages . In its history , China has conducted 40 nuclear tests , compared to more_than 1 # 000 by the United States . Its arsenal , estimated at 250 to 300 nuclear_warheads , is smallest of the five main nuclear_powers . The United States staged its last test in 1992 , France and Britain conducted their last in 1991 and Russia in 1990 . Since 1992 , China has been the only nuclear_power to continue testing . Clinton_Administration officials expressed U.S. displeasure at the Chinese action . &quot; The United States deeply regrets this action , &quot; White_House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said in a statement . &quot; We urge China to refrain_from further nuclear tests and to join the other nuclear_powers in a global moratorium as we work to complete a comprehensive test ban treaty , &quot; White_House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said in a statement .</TEXT>
