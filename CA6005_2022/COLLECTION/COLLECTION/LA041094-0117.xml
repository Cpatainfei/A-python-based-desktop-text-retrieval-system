   <HEADLINE> THE FINANCIAL MARKET ' S SHADOWY NEW RISK ; DERIVATIVE DEALING ATTRACTS WASHINGTON ' S ATTENTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The world ' s financial markets are complicated enough these days , what with the lightning speed of computer trading . Now along comes a relatively new wrinkle called derivatives . These are special financial tools that only the biggest investors can use to hedge their bets and protect their portfolios . In some respects the world of derivative dealing is a scary one . Even Washington is starting to pay close attention to the growing use of these arcane , highly sophisticated financial instruments . Although derivatives are little understood or used outside of Wall_Street , some companies , banks , brokerages and even mutual_funds seem to love them ; the face_value of derivatives in_play today is an awesome $ 15 trillion . Derivatives are financial contracts that derive their value from another asset , such_as stocks , bonds or commodities . Their purpose is to diminish risk . They do this by offering all sorts of contracts -- swaps , options , forwards , caps or collars , to name a_few -- that can be used to hedge against fluctuations in interest_rates , foreign_exchange rates and stock and commodity prices . Small investors can ' t use derivatives -- only huge institutions like large banks , high-flying brokerage_houses , mutual_funds . The possibility that unregulated derivatives could , in extreme cases , pose a systemic risk to world financial markets is prompting Congress to consider safeguards , especially oversight and disclosure . In introducing a bill in January to create a Federal Derivatives Commission , Rep . Jim Leach ( R-Iowa ) described them as &quot; the new wild card in international finance. &quot; Last Wednesday Rep . Edward J . Markey ( D-Mass. ) called_on the Securities and Exchange Commission to study the link , if any , between derivatives and the current volatility in the stock and bond markets . The House Banking Committee will hold a hearing on derivatives Wednesday . Used intelligently and with care , derivatives provide immense benefits by creating a vast pool of financial resources worldwide . Through computers , they allow money to grow in new ways . In some practical_applications , derivatives -- which amount to speculative side bets -- enable businesses to improve their ability to secure financing and various other benefits . However , they also pose huge risks that disclosures and better accountability might help to at least mitigate . Few if any of the companies , banks , brokerages , insurance_companies , mutual and pension_funds and other institutions that deal in derivatives break_out these transactions on income_statements or balance_sheets . It is this woeful lack of accounting that is worrisome . Derivative dealing must be moved_into the light . After all , consider the downside : the huge risks involved when interest_rates shift sharply or international events intervene to trigger derivative defaults that then might panic financial markets . So far , thankfully , derivatives ' losses have been contained and isolated . The giant German company Metallgesellschaft lost $ 1.3 billion last year on a bet_on oil futures . Financier George Soros lost $ 600 million in February in mistakenly projecting a rise in the U.S. dollar against the yen . The thought that a series of such derivative losses might have a devastating domino effect is a chilling one . Common_sense calls_for disclosure , accountability and maybe some sensible if limited regulation .</TEXT>
