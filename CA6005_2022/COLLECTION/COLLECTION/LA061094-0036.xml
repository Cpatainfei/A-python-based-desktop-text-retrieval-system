   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEWS ; ' SLICKERS II ' : SEARCH FOR SEQUEL GOLD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In &quot; City_Slickers , &quot; Billy Crystal ' s Mitch Robbins was instructed by his wife to join a cattle drive and &quot; go and find your smile. &quot; Mitch did more_than that : He bonded with everything in_sight and delivered a calf . So you have to wonder -- what could &quot; City_Slickers II : The Legend of Curly ' s Gold &quot; do to top that earlier film ' s huggy buddy-buddy bathos ? Will Mitch deliver twins this time ? Will the film go sci-fi and have Jack Palance ' s Curly return from the dead to be delivered of a mewling infant ? Nothing so baroque , alas . With several years to ponder a way to honorably recycle &quot; City_Slickers , &quot; the filmmakers responsible_for the sequel -- director Paul Weiland and scripters Crystal , Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel -- have come_up with a buried-treasure plot that would barely pass muster as an old Republic Pictures Western . The only things missing are the singing cowboys . Mitch , having located his smile , sets_out to locate a cache of hidden gold outlined in an old treasure map he accidentally uncovers in the brim of Curly ' s hat . ( He ' s been keeping the hat as a keepsake of his cattle-driver chum ; he ' s also held onto the calf he delivered , now a full-grown steer. ) Accompanying Mitch into the valleys and buttes are his depresso buddy Phil ( Daniel Stern ) , a repeat offender from the first film , and his loafing black-sheep-of-the-family brother Glen ( Jon Lovitz ) , who , at the drop of a Stetson , mimes scenes from &quot; Godfather II. &quot; ( Now there was a sequel. ) Curly , inconveniently dead , is resurrected -- sort of -- in the person of his twin brother Duke ( Palance ) , who is also on the gold trail . The real gold chasers are the filmmakers , who keep pilfering moments from the first film to garland the sequel in_order to repeat their success . There ' s something a bit unseemly about the way &quot; City_Slickers II &quot; keeps fluffing our memories of &quot; City_Slickers , &quot; as if that film was some great classic worth recapping . It was far less than a classic -- a sitcom on the range with a heavy helping of midlife-crisis sensitivity jags . It turns_out that all that bonding / birthing stuff , more_than the jokes , was probably what made the film a smash . It played_out the audience ' s desire to chuck their boring jobs and get_up on a horse and yell , &quot; Yee-Ha . &quot; * &quot; City_Slickers II &quot; has its own variation on that film ' s squishiness . Mitch and his brother rediscover their love for each other , although Crystal in his &quot; sincere &quot; mode is enough to spook the cattle , and Lovitz on the level resembles nothing so_much as his &quot; Saturday Night Live &quot; character The Liar . As if this weren ' t enough , Mitch and Phil rediscover their friendship , which is put to the test when Mitch is required to suck rattlesnake venom from Phil ' s posterior butte . Most of the comedy is_on this level , which makes you long -- well , almost -- for a_few more midlife mouthings from the first film . With most of the film taken_up with these city dudes , &quot; City_Slickers II &quot; has a skimpy , arid feeling , despite the Utah vistas . Only Palance returns with a flourish . He ' s as gnarled and critter-like as ever , and he gives his dumbest lines an orotund looniness that makes them hang_in the air . Palance would be great playing Long John Silver in a newfangled &quot; Treasure Island. &quot; He ' s a tall_tale in motion . What &quot; City_Slickers II &quot; is really all about is movie_stars play-acting cowboys . It ' s a boy ' s fantasy we ' re asked not so_much to applaud as anoint . The first film roused a_few laughs by showing how inept its city_boys were_on the range , but narcissism seems to have kicked_in for the sequel . Crystal , who also produced the film , likes the way he looks_on a horse . He likes the way he gazes steely-eyed at the horizon . He can be a highly inventive comic actor but , as long as he ' s being bathetic and legendary , is it OK if we don ' t come_out to play ? * MPAA rating : PG-13 for a comic sex scene and off-color humor . Times guidelines : It includes a hissing rattlesnake , a character being shot in the chest and a stampede .
