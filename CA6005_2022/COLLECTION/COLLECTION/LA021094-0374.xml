   <HEADLINE> THE 66TH ACADEMY AWARD NOMINATIONS ; COMMENTARY ; SOMEHOW , THE FILM ACADEMY GETS IT RIGHT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Periodically derided for being ossified , provincial and worse , the Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences did more_than hand_out a slew of nominations Wednesday , it struck a blow for its own reputation . No , the actors ' branch didn ' t come_up with the nerve to nominate David Thewlis for &quot; Naked , &quot; indisputably one of the top male performances of the year , but the academy did demonstrate notable discernment in picking its way through the hundreds of films eligible to find diamonds glittering in the rough . Both Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne , exceptional in &quot; What ' s Love Got to Do With It , &quot; got tapped for best actress and best actor even though their film was not that broadly seen . The same goes_for youthful prodigy Leonardo DiCaprio , a best supporting actor nominee for the even less-seen &quot; What ' s Eating Gilbert Grape. &quot; And the actors resisted the temptation to go_with Anthony Hopkins ' showier performance in &quot; Shadowlands &quot; and picked his more subtle work in &quot; The Remains of the Day &quot; instead . Other academy branches were equally discriminating . The directors recognized what an accomplished piece_of_work &quot; Short Cuts &quot; was for Robert Altman , the cinematographers picked_up on the virtuoso quality of Conrad Hall ' s photography in &quot; Searching for Bobby Fischer , &quot; and both the art_directors and costumers understood that those were the only elements of &quot; Orlando &quot; worth getting excited about . Similarly the writers ' branch , which has been accused of shortchanging both comedy and action scripts , nominated &quot; Dave , &quot; &quot; Sleepless in Seattle &quot; and &quot; In the Line_of_Fire &quot; for best original screenplay . And the academy as_a_whole showed itself not too snooty to appreciate the gangbusters ' charm of &quot; The Fugitive , &quot; picking it seven times , including best picture but not including director ( and DGA nominee ) Andrew Davis . For those nominated films that were not must-sees when they played in theaters , the role of videotapes shipped to academy members ' homes loomed once again as a potent weapon . Tapes were also probably critical for the powerhouse &quot; In the Name of the Father , &quot; which did not show_up in theaters until Dec . 29 but ended with seven nominations . The academy also showed notable restraint in the recognition it gave to &quot; Philadelphia , &quot; which opened_to a lot of buzz many moviegoers felt it didn ' t live_up_to . Aside from nominations going_to good soldier Tom Hanks for best actor and Ron Nyswaner for best original screenplay , the film ' s only other successes were for two original songs and best makeup . If any quality films had reason to feel that the academy was not nearly as discerning as it might be , &quot; Much Ado About Nothing &quot; and &quot; The Age of Innocence &quot; would fit the bill . Despite glowing reviews and a strong campaign , &quot; Much Ado &quot; did not manage a single nomination . And &quot; Age , &quot; though it did gather five , could not secure one for director Martin Scorsese , generally emphasizing the truth of the buzz that the film was not playing well in this town . Overall , though this year might superficially look_like a resurgent one for the Hollywood Establishment , a closer look_at the biggest winners underlines a trend -- first noticeable the last time around -- away from traditional studio product as Oscar contenders . First of all , several studios did not fare well at all_in Wednesday ' s announcements . The Disney organization , which probably released more films than any other major studio last year , can boast of only three nominations , ditto for Paramount , while all 20th Century Fox had to show for its trouble was a single nod for best makeup for &quot; Mrs . Doubtfire. &quot; Look now at the big winners . &quot; The Piano , &quot; with eight nominations , including best picture , was an independent French-Australian production using American stars . Two other best picture nominees , the Merchant Ivory &quot; Remains of the Day &quot; ( eight nominations ) and &quot; In the Name of the Father , &quot; had largely British casts and crews , came_to the studios that distributed them as tidy packages and did not go_through the usual development process . And with Steven Spielberg , like Clint Eastwood with &quot; Unforgiven &quot; last year , functioning pretty much as an independent duchy while shooting &quot; Schindler ' s List , &quot; that left only one film out of five , &quot; The Fugitive , &quot; to hold_up the flag for the old-fashioned Hollywood way of making pictures . The same international cross-fertilization that characterized the best picture nominees was also a factor_in the best foreign-language film nominees . In fact , three of the pictures named -- &quot; Farewell My Concubine , &quot; &quot; The Wedding Banquet &quot; and &quot; The Scent of Green Papaya &quot; -- had origins so multinational it took a special dispensation from the academy before they could be declared eligible . For once , the surprises in this category were minimal : the lack of a nomination for &quot; Germinal , &quot; the ponderous epic from France , and the inclusion of &quot; Hedd Wyn , &quot; a Welsh-language film from the United Kingdom . If the foreign-language selections looked mostly familiar to habitual moviegoers , the same could not quite be said for the feature documentaries , though there was progress in that area . Two of this year ' s choices , &quot; The War Room &quot; and &quot; Children of Fate , &quot; were good_enough to have earned theatrical releases , but the doc branch didn ' t see fit to nominate such fine work as &quot; It ' s All True &quot; and &quot; Something Within Me , &quot; a big favorite at Sundance last year . Maybe the three unknown films that were picked will turn_out to be dazzling , but if experience is any judge , don ' t hold your breath.ACADEMY OF MOTION_PICTURE A</TEXT>
