   <HEADLINE> DESTINATION : OMAN ; SANDCASTLES AND SKYSCRAPERS ; OLD TRADITIONS LINGER IN THIS PERSIAN_GULF SULTANATE , WHICH HAS LEAPED INTO THE 21ST CENTURY AFTER A LONG , XENOPHOBIC ISOLATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> With its oil wealth , the little Persian_Gulf sultanate of Oman has taken a bold leap into the 21st Century during the past two decades , but old Arab traditions linger . As I departed the Holiday Inn in Salalah , on the nation ' s southern coast , I was escorted to a corner of the lobby where exquisite rugs and pillows had been arranged as if in a Bedouin tent . There I was seated and served a basket of fresh , sweet Omani dates and a cup of kahwa , a strong aromatic coffee laced with cardamom powder , saffron and rose water that had been brewed over an ornate charcoal brazier . The scent of frankincense , which Oman has exported for centuries , perfumed the air . It was an odd moment , this ancient ritual of hospitality played_out slowly and graciously within full view of the bustling registration desk of a big American chain hotel . But no more odd , I suppose , than countless similar clashes of old and new I witnessed in this exotic country -- the legendary homeland of Sinbad the Sailor -- which until 1970 had been trapped for decades in a grim , xenophobic isolation that shunned even the most modest of 20th-Century advances . There were few schools , a single electrical_power plant , no newspapers , no radio or television -- and only a_few miles of paved roads . Oman was , as government officials concede , one of the most backward nations in the Arab world . This has all changed now , and Muscat , the capital -- draped across a dramatic landscape of desert , mountain and sea -- is a gleamingly up-to-date city of grand , landscaped boulevards , new office high-rises , swank beach-front hotels , blooming gardens , modern hospitals and schools as well as ornately embellished mosques and a lavish new seaside palace for visiting dignitaries . The absolute monarch , British-educated Sultan Zaboos bin Said al-Said , launched his people on their pell-mell race to progress after deposing his father in a bloodless coup in 1970 . So intent is he on polishing the nation ' s image that Omani motorists , many of them driving Mercedes limousines , can be ticketed if their cars are too dirty . And yet for all Muscat ' s dazzling freshness -- indeed , the many huge homes_in the city ' s lushly landscaped desert terrain reminded me of posh Palm Springs -- Oman ' s ancient Arab heritage as an adventurous seafaring and trading empire has not been abandoned entirely . Most men in the capital and elsewhere still wear carefully wrapped turbans and the sleek , white ankle-length tunics called dishdashas , and the women , whose faces generally remain uncovered , are wrapped in a riot of color that invariably includes a scarf across the head and lots of dangling silver and gold jewelry . To my Western eye , the sight of Omanis in their traditional garb , men and women alike , seemed curiously out_of_place in Muscat ' s modern , computer-furnished offices . As I was learning , the old and the new in today ' s Oman are intricately entwined . You don ' t have to go_far into the desert outside Muscat to spot a herd of camels , but they are now kept mostly for their milk or for camel racing rather than transportation . Fishermen on the Arabian_Sea still pull sardine-heavy nets ashore by hand -- although when the water is rough they may hook the net to the bumper of a pickup_truck and let it do the muscle work . And a visit to the tangled streets of the Muscat souk , the city ' s open-air marketplace , continues to be a journey into the past -- even if many of the old stalls sell fancy luggage , mechanical toys and practically anything else you might find in your local Kmart . Tucked_in odd corners , however , are stalls offering fresh spices , frankincense burners and hand-worked silver jewelry . I flew to Oman via London in late October , a 22-hour journey that proved exhausting . But I dismissed the drawback as a modest price for the chance to see a new and very different land undergoing rapid change . I toured Oman for five days , not nearly enough time to do_it justice . I scrambled through ancient mud forts ; waded in warm surf on beautiful empty beaches on the Gulf_of_Oman and the Arabian_Sea ; bounced in a Land Rover through an intimidating bleak and empty desert to visit the ruins of the fabled city of Ubar ; witnessed the busy morning fish market in Muscat ; admired good_examples of Arabic architecture old and new ; was mobbed by youngsters eager to have their photos snapped ; nibbled more dates than I ' ve ever eaten_in all my life , and dined quite nicely on such Omani specialties as viazi va nazi , which my English menu described as braised beef and potatoes layered and simmered in a coconut sauce and served with rice . And I met unfailingly friendly and courteous people , many of whom spoke English fluently . * As an independent traveler , I found Oman reasonably easy to explore . Almost every sign , whether it is a road marker or a shop marquee , appears in both Arabic and English . Detailed guidebooks and maps in English abound_in hotel bookstores . Even the license tags_on Omani autos are in both languages . Good paved roads extend_to much of Oman , although four-wheel drive is recommended for unpaved roads into the desert and mountains . Outside the city core , traffic is nonexistent -- as , apparently , are speed_limits . I ventured into the countryside on two half-day trips , one from Muscat and another from the southern seaside city of Salalah , accompanied by a guide whom the Ministry of Information had provided me as a foreign journalist . But both excursions can be duplicated by joining a commercial tour -- brochures are available in most hotels -- or renting a car . I had been warned about the summer heat and humidity of the Persian_Gulf area , but by late October the worst heat had abated , and I was fairly comfortable -- although drenched in sweat whenever I toured on foot . As desolate as this rugged land may seem , it nevertheless displays a wild beauty , like the Badlands of the American Dakotas , and I found the scenery fascinating . The red sand_dunes looming on the horizon make a vivid splash of color against the deep blue_sky , where I never saw a cloud during the entire week of my trip . To tour the mud fort at Nakhal , which dates_back before the 9th Century , I set_out one morning with a Portuguese political writer and an Omani government guide for the half-day drive into the mountains southwest of Muscat . Nakhal ' s is one of numerous Omani forts that are being preserved . As our driver sped out of Muscat on an express highway , I heard a pinging sound in our Land Rover -- a warning , I soon learned , required in all Omani cars to alert motorists that they are exceeding 75 m.p.h. The bell didn ' t faze our driver ; we pinged almost our entire way to Nakhal and back . Restored in 1990 , the fort is_well worth the trip . Ringed with high walls , it is perched on the rocks above the village , and mountains tower in the background . Inside , stair-step passageways lead to six cylindrical towers and several rooms furnished comfortably with rugs , pillows and ceramics as they might have been when the fort was in_use . In one large room , the wood beams of the ceiling were colorfully painted with quotes from the Koran -- a traditional form of Omani home decoration . From the parapets , I could see the village below , where dozens of schoolchildren played_at recess . The boys were dressed in youthful versions of the dishdasha , and girls wore bright scarves on their heads . * To visit Salalah at the southern tip of Oman , where the sultan maintains a summer palace , I could have taken one of the daily air-conditioned buses that cover the desert route in 12 hours over the new paved highway linking the two cities . But my time was short , so I flew_on Oman Air ( about $ 130 round_trip ) , which makes the flight with 737 jets in just over an hour . The lures of Salalah were its magnificent , miles-long white-sand beach , acres of frankincense trees growing wild and the archeological ruins of Ubar . The road to Ubar climbs steeply through the_hills north of Salalah , where herds of free-roaming cattle and goats graze on the thick grass , which turns brown at the end of the monsoon season . Suddenly our driver made a left turn_on a barely discernible path across the desert floor . For more_than another hour , we bounced over the hard-packed sand in the direction of the Rub al-Khali , the infamous Empty Quarter on the Saudi_Arabian border . I have never seen a more desolate landscape . The terrain was almost perfectly flat , except for an occasional rocky lump in the distance , and barely a blade of grass was visible anywhere . Sand devils whipped across the horizon . Twice on our excursion , our guide stopped for a_few minutes of private prayer . Ubar is celebrated in the Koran as a profitable center for the frankincense trade , I was informed , dating_back as early as 3000 BC . According to legend , it was a wealthy and powerful fortress city . But the stone city was mistakenly built above a limestone cavern , so the theory goes , and one day the cavern collapsed from the weight , swallowing Ubar like &quot; the Atlantis of the sands &quot; -- as T . E . Lawrence , the Lawrence of Arabia , dubbed it . Last year , it was announced that a team of California archeologists , using high-tech satellite imagery , had rediscovered Ubar buried beneath the sand . In truth , there is not much yet to see there , except for a_few crumbling walls and a deep sinkhole . I was just as intrigued by the adjacent oasis and the new village constructed nearby for archeological workers . Each small home , encircled by a wall , looks_like a miniature fort -- as do dwellings and other structures in Oman . For perhaps 5 # 000 years , as the Ubar site suggests , Oman has traded_in frankincense , shipped by sea and camel caravan to markets in India , the Middle_East and Europe . Since it is produced only in southern Oman and nearby Somalia , this famous gift may have originated from near Salalah . There in the souk , I bought a small , locally made incense burner of painted pottery , and the shopkeeper , an old_woman seated barefoot on a rug , filled it free with frankincense . In Oman , frankincense is burned in charcoal after coffee or after a meal , signaling that it is time for guests to leave . Men waft the aroma into their beards and hair and women perfume their skirts . In the departing coffee ceremony to which I was treated at my Salalah hotel , the aroma of burning frankincense filled the lobby . In much the traditional way , I too was enveloped in the fragrance and carried it away with me as I left Oman . GUIDEBOOK : Venturing to Oman Getting there : The best connecting service from Los Angeles to Muscat , Oman , is through London on United Airlines or British Air , or through Frankfurt on Delta ; current best round-trip fare is about $ 3 # 060 until the end of May , then about $ 3 # 320 until October . However , you may be able to trim that fare by $ 1 # 000 or more ( depending_on departure date ) if you are flexible in your travel_plans and make use of a consolidator offering off-price tickets . For consolidator fares , consult a travel_agent . Because of Omani immigration rules , if you fly into Oman you must fly out of that country ; you cannot fly into Oman and travel overland , for example , to the neighboring United Arab Emirates . American citizens must carry a passport and obtain visas in_advance to visit Oman . Where to stay : Oman offers a choice of excellent hotels ranging from moderately priced to expensive . In Muscat , I stayed_at the Muscat Inter-Continental , a splendid high-rise on the beach , where a room was about $ 110 a night . At the Al Bustan Palace hotel , another Inter-Continental beach-front property and one of the Persian_Gulf ' s most luxurious hotels , a room is about $ 260 a night . In Salalah , on Oman ' s southern coast , the principal hotel is the beach-front Holiday Inn , where a room is about $ 90 a night . Where to eat : Visitors should have little problem finding excellent , moderately priced restaurants in Oman . Every menu I was handed carried an English translation . Choices range from Middle Eastern , Persian and Indian cuisines -- which I favored -- to European menus , pizza and American fast food . Locally caught fish and locally grown fruit and vegetables are plentiful . I paid $ 18- $ 23 for a full dinner in each of my hotels and about $ 12 for a filling buffet breakfast .
