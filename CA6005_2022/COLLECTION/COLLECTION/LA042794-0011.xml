   <HEADLINE> PRESIDENT NIXON ' S DEATH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * How sad it is to lose a former President . Although I always backed President Richard Nixon ' s opponents , America has lost a senior foreign-policy expert . Some of the public policy statements he made during the last decade sounded rather reasonable compared with the previous 12 years of conservative Reagan-Bush policies . Back in the early 1970s I was upset with him for not including me on his &quot; enemies list. &quot; But time heals old wounds . DAVID HYMAN Sepulveda * A TV_reporter said in reference_to President Nixon : &quot; We are all victims of our successes and our strengths are determined by our weaknesses. &quot; President Nixon has always been my hero since I was a Nixonette on the Berkeley campus in the ' 60s . Since that time , and to this moment , President Nixon has been my inspiration for overcoming life ' s battles during periods of adversity and personal crisis . SUSAN LESLIE SMITH San Marino * Richard Nixon ' s keen mind was clearly demonstrated during a foreign-policy speech he delivered to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council in 1986 . Just prior to being introduced to the approximately 1 # 000 people on_hand , he asked that the podium be removed . His aide at the time , John Taylor , now executive_director of the Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace , had given me a copy of the text . I noted that it was 21 pages , double-spaced -- a probing examination of America ' s role in the post-nuclear age . The former President spoke extemporaneously , not using a single note . Towards the end of the talk , Nixon ticked_off 12 points outlining a new policy toward the then-Soviet Union . Looking_at my text from my place at the end of the dais , I noted that he skipped point 10 . Just prior to concluding , he paused and then deftly inserted the missing paragraph . He had included virtually every word in the text of that approximately 40-minute speech ! EDMONDE A . HADDAD Playa del Rey The writer is past president of the Los Angeles World Affairs Council . * What has caused the media and President Clinton to half-staff the flag for Richard Nixon ? Are we to mourn a fallen President , a statesman ? True , he has died and we don ' t say bad things about the dead . But should we distort history ? He was forced to resign the presidency or be impeached . He broke many laws . He betrayed the trust of the American people and the oath of office . He ruined the lives of thousands of citizens with his red-baiting and secret enemies list . He supported fascist dictatorships in Southern Europe and throughout the Third_World . He was elected by promising to end the Vietnam_War and instead escalated the killing . Nixon , the law-and-order President , thought like a criminal , authorizing robberies , break-ins and phone taps . Indeed , when a sacred trust to the American people is trampled by a President , when laws are broken which would have sent a poorer , less important_person to jail , then history should record it that way . HASKELL WEXLER Santa Monica * Shortly after Nixon resigned I was in London shopping at a discount_store . The sales clerk volunteered the following succinct observation : &quot; Nixon did_good things . He had bad character. &quot; LEE WEINSTEIN Inglewood * Shortly before he was questioned about his choice in underwear last week , an MTV audience of twentysomethings asked President Clinton what was the most important thing his mother had taught him . He replied , &quot; Never give up. &quot; Perhaps he could have learned that same lesson from Richard Nixon . No matter what you thought_of him or his politics , you could never call Nixon a quitter . Time after time , when pundits had written him off , Nixon was the proverbial phoenix that kept rising from the political ashes . Who could have imagined that a Republican President , who was forced to resign from office nearly 20 years ago , would be briefing a Democratic President after returning from a recent trip to Russia where he met with top opposition leaders ? In some countries , a Nixon figure would have been exiled or shoved_off to permanent obscurity . Instead , Nixon fought_back and began a long political comeback that would ultimately reward him with an elder-statesman mantle . Nixon ' s well-chronicled career had a long history of fighting_back and turning insurmountable tides . After losing the 1960 presidential election and then the California gubernatorial election , Nixon weakened only once publicly by proclaiming , &quot; You won ' t have Dick Nixon to kick_around anymore. &quot; But even then , after a short stint in private life , he did the impossible -- he came_back to win the presidency just a_few years later . All of these thoughts occurred to me back in 1983 when Nixon came_out of seclusion to begin his public rehabilitation with a speech on foreign_policy at Chapman College in Orange . Even then , speaking without notes and a podium , he kept an audience spellbound with a thoughtful analysis of world affairs . He received a standing_ovation . After being so publicly disgraced , Nixon could have hid and collected his presidential pension . But he seemingly had a genetic mandate to keep firing back and he did , by writing books , giving speeches and playing adviser to world leaders . He never gave_up . Maybe that could be one of Richard Nixon ' s greatest legacies . GARY C . SHERWIN Huntington Harbour * Sure , Watergate was a mistake , but getting us out of Vietnam was more_than politically correct . Thank_you , President Nixon ! CAREY LIVINGSTON Yucaipa * If Watergate began the period of national skepticism , the glowing reminiscences about Richard Nixon by some who knew him do nothing to change that Zeitgeist . The truth is that Nixon broke the law not only by obstructing justice in the Watergate investigation . His apologists seem to forget the burglary of the office of Daniel Ellsberg ' s psychiatrist . They ' ve apparently forgotten the enemies list and the wiretapping . Those are violations of the Fourth Amendment . Perhaps they ' ve forgotten , too , his abuse of power by illegal use of the IRS to harass his enemies . Conducting foreign_policy is one thing : You make your own rules . Domestic governance has quite different , more difficult ramifications . Now we shall have the spectacle of all_of those past presidents and the present one eulogizing Nixon . Either they are world-class hypocrites or they have forgotten that if this is not a nation of laws , not men , then it is not worth living here . MARY LOU WHITMORE Brentwood * Most of us agreed that President Nixon was an extraordinary man in foreign affairs . What about domestic affairs ? As a black female who has worked extensively in the federal environs of equal-employment opportunity , beginning with the program ' s inception in 1969 , I feel that it is time to give credit where credit is_due . Nixon was the first President to put teeth in equal_opportunity in employment in the federal_government through his Executive Order 11478 ( Aug . 8 , 1969 ) . But he didn ' t stop there ! More important , he was the President who signed into law the amendment ( PL 92-261 , March 24 , 1972 ) to the 1964 Civil Rights Law , which directed equal_opportunity in employment for not only federal employees but for state and local_government employees , too . These programs will forge an acquired skill forever in the manner that our government treats its citizens in equality of opportunity . I salute you , Mr. President , and thank_you ! SALENA GREGORY San Bernardino * I really don ' t understand the lionization of Nixon . Has everyone forgotten how much they hated him when he was President ? Has everyone forgotten about the countless deaths he caused in Southeast_Asia , or the fact that he resigned in disgrace after the Watergate fiasco ? A national day of mourning for Nixon ? You ' ve got be kidding me ! KENNY GOLDBERG Pasadena * When Hitler began conquering Europe , no one in the media accused any opponent of those events of &quot; anti-Nazi hysteria. &quot; Yet in 1946 , when Stalin gobbled_up East Europe and Richard Nixon ran_for Congress opposing this , he was accused of &quot; anti-communist hysteria. &quot; Communism lasted much longer than Nazism and has been responsible_for far more butchery and suffering in many_more countries . To this day , the media repeat the cliche of &quot; anti-communist hysteria , &quot; as though anyone who is against communism is some kind of a dangerous radical . The fall of world communism , I should think , would have validated those who were always against it rather than those who appeased it . It took TV about 40 years before it would show footage of Stalin ' s troops invading East Poland in 1939 , instead of just Hitler invading from the other side . I proudly join in honoring Nixon for his &quot; anti-communist hysteria. &quot; We &quot; hysterics &quot; were right . GEORGE DuBOIS Laguna Niguel Pasadena * Conrad comes not to bury Nixon but to belie him ( &quot; Here lies Richard M . Nixon , &quot; April 25 ) . RALPH HEAD Santa Barbara * Once again Conrad tops the nation with the most distasteful political cartoon of the day . The sadder thing is that you published it . Shame on you . ROBERT H . BOURGUET Cypress * Historians and media pundits will argue the pros and cons of Nixon ' s actions as President for years hence . No one , however , will dare question the down-to-earth brilliance of his forethought to draw_up a &quot; living will. &quot; He spared us the media sensationalization of the medical heroics to save a half-paralyzed , unable-to-speak human . I hope many people will consider the same legal course to preserve their dignity , as did he . JAMES A . GOETHEL MD Glendale</TEXT>
