   <HEADLINE> PRINCELY BOOTLEG ; SOME PEOPLE ' LL DO ANYTHING TO HEAR THESE SONGS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Purely for the perverse palette , Rhino Records has two CDs out_in its popular &quot; Golden Throats &quot; series , consisting_of misbegotten recordings by famous actors -- from William Shatner to Jack Webb -- who briefly thought they were singers , doing pop standards by Dylan , the Beatles and others . Now there ' s an entirely contemporary , de_facto &quot; Golden Throats Vol . 3 &quot; making the rounds of camp fans ' cassette_decks -- though it ' s not in_stores and never will be . It ' s the lost original soundtrack to &quot; I ' ll Do Anything , &quot; featuring Julie Kavner , Albert Brooks and Tracy Ullman doing Prince , and it ' s the most sought-after bootleg in town . The tapes being circulated include Prince ' s demos for the nine songs he wrote for the ill-fated musical incarnation of James L . Brooks ' film , followed by the actors ' renditions of those same songs , plus a lone Sinead O ' Connor contribution . All musical numbers were eventually cut from the finished product after disastrous test screenings , except for a snippet of a children ' s tune , written by Carole King and sung by young Whittni Wright , that remains . Many who ' ve heard the tape agree that director Brooks made absolutely the right decision to remove the Prince songs . &quot; No matter how bad anybody thinks the music would ' ve been -- and I was expecting it to be horrible -- it ' s worse , &quot; says one astonished professional songwriter who has played the tape for friends at parties . &quot; It ' s like ' Springtime for Hitler ' in ' The Producers. ' &quot; The main theme of the original musical was a Prince ditty called &quot; Wow , &quot; the lyrics of which are generic enough to pop_up in six different reprises throughout the movie : Sample chorus : * Wow ! This is crazy Wow ! This is wild If there ever was a time for reaction Baby the time is now Seems like we ' re spending most of our lives Just waiting for the big bang Extraordinary stuff that makes us say Extraordinary things like Wow ! * One of the reprises accompanies a trimmed childbirth scene , in which an actress moans and screams her way through the song , singing &quot; Ow ! &quot; instead of &quot; Wow ! &quot; Albert Brooks croons two songs : &quot; I ' ll Do Anything &quot; ( lyric : &quot; What good is a captain if he ain ' t got a crew / What good is a me if I AIN ' T . . . GOT . . . A YOU ! &quot; ) and &quot; There Is Lonely. &quot; Brooks ' singing voice has been described charitably as gravitating toward the Jimmy Durante or Tom Waits end of the gravelly scale , and less charitably as an Oscar the Grouch affectation . But there are two more torturous tunes that draw the greatest winces from illicit listeners . One is Kavner ' s &quot; My Little Pill , &quot; a sort of update of &quot; Mother ' s Little Helper &quot; related to the truncated drug subplot , and recited in a maddeningly childlike sing-song voice . The other is Wright ' s rendition of O ' Connor ' s mopey &quot; This Lonely Life &quot; that won ' t have anyone comparing her to the other singing Whitney . One track is mysteriously missing from the bootleg tapes : Nick Nolte ' s infamous singing debut on his sole number , &quot; Be My Mirror. &quot; Speculates one source , &quot; He probably spent his entire salary from the movie buying_up every single copy of his vocal. &quot; The tapes that do exist are hard to come_by , and have apparently come from inside Brooks ' company , Gracie Films . Though Warner Bros . Records had the soundtrack on its release schedule at one point , a source there close to top_executives says he doubts that any tape copy ever made its way inside the building . And a source with friends at Paisley Park Records ' recently disbanded L.A. office claims that Prince called there recently asking that all copies of the &quot; I ' ll Do Anything &quot; music be destroyed. *</TEXT>
