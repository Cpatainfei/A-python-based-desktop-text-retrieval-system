   <HEADLINE> BILL BOYARSKY : THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY ; IS THE SIMPSON CASE RELEVANT TO THE REST OF L.A. ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Even though it occupies much of my time , I often wonder if the O.J. Simpson trial has anything to do with the rest of Los Angeles . Is it just a sensational celebrity murder case ? Is it a tale of the lives of the rich and privileged who have no real connection with L.A. except as a place to touch_down briefly for a change of clothes during their jet-setting ? On the other hand , does the upcoming trial have anything to say about our society ? The other day , I discussed this point with John Mack , the longtime president of the Los Angeles Urban League and one of the African American community ' s most respected leaders . It turned_out he , too , often questioned the Simpson case ' s importance . &quot; It simply boils_down to two people brutally murdered and a fellow who happens to have been a big celebrity , &quot; he told me . &quot; But when you look_at the bread-and-butter issues that need to be addressed in Crenshaw , South-Central and throughout Los Angeles , it ' s a footnote in history. &quot; Well , I replied , it was important enough for you and other African American community leaders to discuss it with Gil Garcetti on July 19 in one of your periodic meetings with the district_attorney . Mack smiled , indicating that I had a point . That meeting turned_out to be a noteworthy development in the Simpson story . Garcetti ' s critics cited it as evidence that the D.A. bowed to these community leaders , who happened to be foes of the death_penalty . Instead , the district_attorney ' s office is seeking life imprisonment without parole for Simpson , who has pleaded innocent . Mack played_down the capital_punishment aspect of the session . He said the death_penalty discussion occupied just a_few minutes of a long session . &quot; I don ' t think Gil Garcetti made a decision not to go_to the death_penalty in_order to appease the African American community and its leadership , &quot; he said . What I found more interesting than Mack ' s impressions of the meeting were his views on the relationship between the Simpson case and the black community . As we talked in his comfortable Crenshaw-area office , I could see that the subject was complicated . * &quot; One of the things I have been very careful about , as have a number of my colleagues in leadership roles , was to avoid jumping_out there and screaming race . . . . The feeling of most of us was that it is really a complicated issue , &quot; Mack said . &quot; He was a privileged brother . . . who had been carefully packaged and marketed and he was not part of the African American community . . . . It was a contrast to the Rodney King incident where you had a young , poverty-stricken African American male who had no clout of any kind , who had been jacked around by the system . &quot; When we all first heard about it , the first reaction most of us had , since most of us didn ' t know O.J. , was . . . there was no way this guy could have done_it , this great guy . But . . . we discovered he was not the wonderful , caring , compassionate , loving husband that his handlers had portrayed . The spousal abuse business is bad . Clearly what happened in 1989 when he clearly had badly beaten Nicole Simpson and was allowed to get_away with no jail time , to pick his own psychiatrist . . . was clearly a case of class and privilege . &quot; Then there is the nagging reality we have to deal with . Yes , there are all those things , but it ' s an undeniable reality that in Los Angeles and in America , whenever you have an incident where an African American man . . . is accused of killing two white people , especially when one of them was his ex-wife . . . you have all_of the racial bigotry and baggage that people carry about interracial marriages. &quot; With this in mind , Mack said , &quot; I recognize Garcetti has a job to do . I recognize that some of my constituents are convinced that O.J. Simpson did not do_it , and do not want to be bothered with the evidence or the facts . I don ' t take that position . I take the position that if the evidence . . . would convict O.J. Simpson , then O.J. Simpson should be held accountable . &quot; But he added , &quot; I think he should receive a fair trial . It ' s very important that he not be treated above the law , but he should not be a victim of his celebrity status , either. &quot; * Afterward , I puzzled_over what Mack had said . Obviously , he did not see Simpson as a symbol , or his arrest as symbolic of the treatment of African Americans by the criminal justice system . Rather , he seemed to be giving a message to Garcetti , his deputies and the investigators : This man may_not be part of our community . He abused his wife . He ' s not a role_model . But the criminal justice system has treated African Americans badly . Blacks , rich and poor , have been abused . So we ' ll be watching to make_sure he gets a fair trial . In the end , that may be the importance of the Simpson case . It is not about race so_much as notoriety and the media and the public ' s obsession with all_the details . The real question is whether L.A. ' s strained criminal justice system can operate fairly under such extraordinary circumstances .</TEXT>
