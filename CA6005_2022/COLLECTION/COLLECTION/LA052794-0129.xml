   <HEADLINE> HOME ENTERTAINMENT ; AN INVASION OF WWII VIDEOS ON_TAP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Look_for the interest in old_World War II movies to skyrocket in the next few weeks . The inspiration is the celebration of the 50th anniversary of D-day , the Allied invasion of Normandy on June 6 , 1944 . Home-video retailers will be showcasing classic war movies to capitalize both on the media attention and the Father ' s Day ' s gift potential . The tape that ' s getting the most attention is FoxVideo ' s &quot; The Longest Day , &quot; which just came_out for the first time in a colorized version -- priced at $ 25 and featuring some Movietone newsreel footage of the invasion . This 1962 movie , probably the most elaborate war epic ever filmed , actually works better in_color -- adding grandeur that ' s missing from the black-and-white version . It includes nearly every male star of that era -- from John Wayne and Robert Mitchum to Sal Mineo . FoxVideo also repackaged two other movies . One is another first-rate but less heralded film about the Normandy invasion , &quot; D-Day The Sixth of June , &quot; made in 1956 and starring Robert Taylor . Priced at $ 15 , it also includes newsreel footage . The other is 1970 ' s &quot; Patton , &quot; featuring George C . Scott ' s Oscar-winning performance in the title_role , at $ 30 . The hidden gem in this repackaged collection is &quot; Twelve O ' Clock High , &quot; about American pilots in England during World_War_II . War-movie buffs love this 1949 film , which has been hard to find in recent years . It stars Gregory Peck . Jackie Tapes As you might expect , there are some Jackie Onassis videos on the way . Turner Home Entertainment , which markets CNN footage , is first out of the box with a video homage to the late First_Lady -- &quot; Jackie : A Life of Dignity &quot; ( Turner , $ 20 ) . You can order by mail , ( 800 ) 799-7676 , or wait until it shows_up in_stores in about a month . Turner is an old_hand at rush-releasing tapes . A few weeks ago , it marketed &quot; Richard Nixon : A Retrospective &quot; just after he died , for $ 20 , but through mail_order only -- that same 800 number . Onassis ' death spurred New Horizons Video to change the release date of &quot; A Woman Named Jackie , &quot; the 1992 ABC miniseries starring Roma Downey in the title_role . Originally scheduled for July 20 , it ' s now coming_out June 15 . Surprisingly , this three-tape set isn ' t bargain-priced for the sales market but will be available as a rental only . ABC Video , which rushed_out a tape about Nixon , has no plans to do the same with Onassis . Father ' s Day Tapes Sports videos on the market for Father ' s Day : A hot one for golfing dads is Monarch ' s &quot; Highlights of the 1994 Masters , &quot; due June 8 at $ 13 , including exclusive footage and interviews . . . .
