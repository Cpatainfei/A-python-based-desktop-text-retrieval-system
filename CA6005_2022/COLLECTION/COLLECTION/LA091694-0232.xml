   <TEXT> The days of penmanship class are over . Word_processing is in . More and more children use com puter keyboards at school and at_home , and teachers , as early as first_grade , accept homework printed out from a computer . In this brave new digital world , children are being taught touch-typing early . Although voice-command computers may eventually eliminate the need to type , we don ' t know when that will come_about . Meanwhile , nobody wants the kids to hunt and peck . Four outstanding children ' s typing tutors for home computer use are_on the market . Each program has unique strengths and weaknesses . For the littlest keyboarders ( ages 4 to 8 ) , a wonderful tutor is &quot; Kid Keys &quot; ( Davidson &amp; Associates ) . It ' s built around a silly theme involving monsters trapped in a castle by a purple dragon . Three winsome activities entice young hands and minds to the keyboard . The simplest is a letter-recognition game in which an on-screen keyboard hides a variety of animated characters . Press the letter and a voice recites it while a little cartoon illustrates the sound ( &quot; V is for volcano &quot; -- and a volcano erupts on screen ) . Each letter has a_few animations so kids don ' t get bored . In the second &quot; Kid Keys &quot; activity , children practice typing by playing tunes on the keyboard . The third , most demanding game challenges kids to touch-type to help four comical characters get_out of jail . &quot; Kid Keys &quot; is carefully calibrated to introduce touch-typing in gradual stages . It makes jolly work_out of learning a dull skill , a not inconsiderable feat . &quot; Mario Teaches Typing &quot; ( Interplay Productions ) isn ' t as conceptually winsome as &quot; Kid Keys , &quot; but it does weigh in heavily in the brand-name recognition department . Anyone whose child is addicted to a Mario video_game will have a walk on the beach getting the child to fool_around with this game . It ' s a lot like video-game play -- bouncing and popping along , this time bopping letters instead of objects . The challenge lies_in making_sure that your child uses the correct fingers on the keyboard ( on-screen gloves show the right move for every keystroke ) . Unmonitored , a kid will just try to go fast and ignore the tutoring aspect of the game . There are four graduated levels to &quot; Mario Teaches Typing. &quot; Adjustable features let you set_up practice so that your child gradually builds the skills involved in touch-typing . Certificates and special screens reward the player for meeting words-per-minute goals as well as completing levels . Although &quot; Mario Teaches Typing &quot; can ' t be used for letter recognition , it will take a child all_the way through to touch-typing at 50 words per minute . For the 7- to 10-year-old set , &quot; Kids ' Typing &quot; ( Bright Star ) is a witty , sophisticated typing tutor , particularly apt for the wisenheimer in your family . It ' s got a sly , tongue-in-cheek story line about a ghost named Spooky who ' s taken_up residence in the attic of a suburban home . Spooky is your typing tutor , and if you do_well at his lessons , he lets you infiltrate the house with him and haunt its inhabitants . You can go_into the den and levitate the television while Dad watches sports ( the sports-casting background_noise is witty and the faster you type , the higher the TV goes ; Dad , in his couch-potato mode , remains oblivious ) . Or you can run the blender in Mom ' s kitchen , eavesdrop while Sis trades inanities on the phone in her bedroom or play musical_instruments in the nursery . If you get tired_of Spooky ' s lessons , you can visit a library . There , a bookcase full of children ' s literature from &quot; Cinderella &quot; to &quot; Rumpelstiltskin &quot; lets you practice typing using real text ( always more fun than &quot; doing scales &quot; ) . Also , you can explore a 26-book &quot; encyclopedia &quot; set_in which each book focuses_on giving practice with a single letter_of_the_alphabet . The screens are gorgeous and the monitoring features excellent ( Spooky can even tell you which keys you are best and worst at hitting correctly ) . This is a powerful program whose economical price shouldn ' t be taken as a reflection on its quality . The all-time best-selling classic of touch-typing software is a program called &quot; Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing ! &quot; It ' s not designed for kids , although a child over 10 can certainly benefit from it . The news here is that the producers are coming_out with a kids ' version this summer called &quot; Mavis Beacon ' s Adventures : Typing for Kids &quot; ( The Software Toolworks ) . Designed for the 4- to 8-year-old market , it has six activities that include letter recognition , word recognition and typing activities . Although the software wasn ' t ready for review before deadline , I ' ve seen samples of how it looks . It ' s eye candy , waggish and fun . Fully animated and with the depth of the adult version ( which is by far the most comprehensive typing tutor I ' ve experienced ) , this could end_up being the best buy of all for the preschool to second-grade crowd . Which brings_up the question : Why should 4-year-olds -- who don ' t know how to spell or read -- learn to type ? Educators say there ' s nothing premature about learning the keyboard at 4 . With the right computer_program , letter recognition becomes part of the fun leading to keyboard comfort . As children move_into the world of spelling and reading , it can only thrill them to know that these magical new tools called &quot; words &quot; are at their fingertips . They ' re sitting inside their home computers , waiting to be tapped_out .
