   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; TAKING_CHARGE ; INVESTMENT CLUBS ARE GROWING AS MORE VALLEY RESIDENTS JOIN FORCES TO TAKE PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR FINANCIAL FUTURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s a ritual for Roz Rosin . As soon as the Encino woman gets the paper in the morning , she turns_to the stock tables . Five years ago , Rosin thought_of Blockbuster , if she thought_of it at all , as a place where she could rent videos . Today she and a group of her friends own shares_in the company . Like a growing number of Valley residents , Rosin belongs_to an investment club . Once a month , she meets with 10 of her friends and spends a_couple_of hours arguing the pros and cons of buying Cifra or some_other growth_stock . Not a great_deal of money hangs_in the balance -- $ 50 per person per month . But the debate is as serious as if millions were riding_on the women ' s ability to pick stock-market winners . The Magnolia Investment Group , as the women call themselves , includes an attorney , a real-estate agent and several teachers like Rosin . Most are married and have teen-age children . &quot; I really like the idea of a bunch of women getting_together to do something serious , &quot; says member Terry Snyder , who lives_in Encino and practices law in Sherman Oaks . Since Rosin started the club in 1992 , the women have put_together a portfolio of seven stocks , worth about $ 11 # 000 ( recent purchases include Marvel , the comics company ) . The group also has about $ 2 # 000 in cash . Because of the club , Rosin has become something she never expected to be -- a confident investor , proud_of her ability to parlay the money she earns as a substitute teacher into a growing nest_egg . &quot; It ' s given me the courage to invest on my own , &quot; says Rosin . But the club has had other surprising benefits as well . Now when she goes_to a party with her attorney husband , Rich , she often finds herself talking with his friends about the vagaries of the stock_market . &quot; I have a lot of self-confidence now that I didn ' t have before. &quot; Best of all , Rosin says , teen-age son , Kenny , and college-age daughter , Melissa , treat her with greater respect since she became the family expert on such weighty matters as whether to buy , sell or hold Telefonica de Argentina . Since Rosin got serious about stocks , she has been known to spend hours in the library , poring over price-earnings ratios and other data reported and evaluated in the investors ' bible , Value Line . She clips news_stories about companies she ' s following and keeps them in a loose-leaf binder dedicated to stocks that have piqued her interest . &quot; There ' s a gambling , fun part of me that loves the stock_market , &quot; she admits . Indeed Rosin says she only recently realized how profoundly the investment club had affected her . The occasion was a trip the group took_to South Coast Plaza for a day of power shopping . In the course of their outing , Rosin spotted a gorgeous St . John suit that she tried_on to the oohs and aahs of her fellow investors . The black knit suit was luscious , she recalls , but she decided to pass_on it . &quot; It was $ 800 with tax . And I thought , ' I ' m going_to buy McDonald ' s ! ' &quot; Like many others locally , Rosin ' s club is a member of the National Assn . of Investors Corp. , a nonprofit organization based in Michigan that has been encouraging and educating groups of small investors since 1951 . According to the NAIC , there are some 25 # 000 investment clubs in the United States , 12 # 000 of them members of the organization . NAIC clubs have slightly more women members than men , and , for reasons that have yet to be plumbed , all-female clubs tend to outperform all-male or mixed-gender ones ( 1993 was the exception , with men ' s clubs edging the women out ) . The average NAIC group has 17 members who invest an average of $ 37.23 a month . It holds 12 different stocks and saw its portfolio gain 13.9 % last year , significantly better than the S &amp; P 500 ' s gain of just over 10 % . Currently , the top five holdings of NAIC clubs are Aflac ( an insurance_company ) , McDonald ' s , AT &amp; T , Wal-Mart Stores and PepsiCo . Last year more_than 2 # 000 new clubs started_up under NAIC auspices . Clubs have been increasing by 10 % to 12 % a year . Indeed , the proliferation of investment clubs seems to be part of a larger trend , as more and more people take personal responsibility for their fiscal health , just as they have for their physical health . There ' s abundant evidence that financial planning is being democratized and demystified -- look_at the proliferation of magazines devoted to money management and the boom in mutual_funds , which individuals can buy without a broker . But this is a relatively recent phenomenon . Decades ago , before IRAs and 401 ( k ) plans appeared and encouraged modest earners to begin making investment decisions , picking stocks was largely the purview of the wealthy , or their stockbrokers . &quot; This was perceived as a rich , white , male-dominated endeavor , &quot; observes Barry Murphy , director of marketing for NAIC . If working people invested at all , they tended to eschew the market and put their money into super-safe United States savings bonds . Henry Bernard , who is NAIC ' s coordinator in the San Fernando Valley , remembers wanting to learn more about investing but not really knowing how to go_about it . Then he read an article about an investment club in Ebony magazine . An electrical_engineer and consultant in Lake View Terrace , Bernard decided that he would do what his own father had not been able to do -- teach his children about the stock_market . So Bernard and his wife , Melanie , started a family investment club . That was almost a decade ago when their now grown children were 12 and 14 . &quot; We named our club the Buttonwood Four because the stock_market started under a buttonwood tree in 1792 , &quot; Bernard recalls . &quot; We held our monthly meetings in our bedroom. &quot; In order to tweak the children ' s imaginations , the Bernards made one of their first investments in McDonald ' s . &quot; You ' ve got_to get that for the kids , that or Disney , &quot; Bernard advises other parents who want their children to catch investment fever . &quot; You tell them , ' You ' re going to own some of this company. ' &quot; Once the children were hooked , they lapped_up such investment truths as the value of dollar cost averaging -- the investing of a set amount at regular intervals , which results in the investor buying more shares when prices are low and fewer when prices are high . The Better-Investing-Through-Big-Macs approach worked like magic , according to Bernard . Both Henry Jr. , their 21-year-old son , and their 23-year-old daughter , Tanisha , have solid investment backgrounds , and they ' ve both begun investment programs of_their_own . For the last several years , Bernard has fielded any questions that members of the Valley ' s 30 or so NAIC investment clubs may have . Wayne Lipschitz of Sherman Oaks started his first investment club seven years ago , when he was a 22-year-old accounting major at Cal State Northridge . He and friend Alan Schnaid remember the very day . It was Oct . 19 , 1987 , the Black Monday on which the Dow Jones industrial average plunged 508 points . Lipschitz recalls that he and Schnaid , now 27 , had the same thought : &quot; Hey , this is a great time to get_into the market ! &quot; When they began , the young_men recall , they didn ' t even know how to read the stock tables in the newspaper . But within a year , Crusader Enterprises , as they called their club , had 36 members , each investing $ 30 a month ; a mentor in the person of a helpful stockbroker who kept steering them away from risky_ventures ; even a monthly newsletter . The club eventually accumulated a portfolio worth $ 70 # 000 and branched_out into non-stock investments , including half interest in a rental property in Las Vegas . The CSUN club was a great success in many ways , but its organizers were not happy . Too many members wanted to contribute their money but not their time or effort . So after five years the original club was disbanded , its assets distributed and Lipschitz and Schnaid started over with five other young_men who were as committed as they were . &quot; We found in our first group that three people were doing the work of 36 , and we wanted to avoid that with the second group , &quot; Lipschitz explains . Organized last year , the new Crusader Enterprises includes only members who have some professional expertise to offer the group and are willing to do their homework -- each of them researches a new stock for consideration at their monthly meeting . Club_member Gary Lieberman is an attorney and wrote the club ' s shareholders agreement ( the group formed a corporation ) . A computer consultant , Guy Nadivi worked with Lipschitz and Schnaid , who are both certified_public_accountants , to develop software tailored to the specific needs of the club . &quot; We ' ve built an infrastructure so if we have substantial growth , we ' re prepared_for it , &quot; says Lipschitz . All the members are on-line and can access and analyze stock data electronically . They also have their own seven-member users ' group so they can flash club-related messages to each other , which they often do daily . The seven men invest $ 110 each per month and meet , as most local groups do , at members ' homes . In just 18 months they have accumulated close to $ 25 # 000 in_stocks ( their biggest stake is in the electronics firm Novell ) and a no-load mutual_fund , Fidelity Asset Manager Growth . The men , who would like to add three more equally skilled and dedicated men or women to their club , take their investing very seriously . &quot; This is my 401 ( k ) plan , &quot; says Schnaid , who expects his club holdings to grow_over time into a significant part of his retirement_fund . Although the club is a member of NAIC , the seven often ignore the umbrella group ' s advice to invest for the long term in non-volatile stocks that are growing faster than the economy . &quot; We have a much more aggressive approach , &quot; says Lipschitz . Crusader Enterprises likes speculative technology stocks , such_as Micrographics . The group is also on the lookout for good real-estate buys to program into its highly efficient investment machine . Los Angeles real_estate is currently selling low , notes Nadivi , &quot; and land ownership is a historically successful way to build wealth. &quot; Lipschitz says he expects the new , improved club to continue indefinitely . &quot; It ' s probably something we ' ll always do , &quot; he says . The men like the networking aspect of the group , and they even have fun . &quot; We have barbecues on weekends , &quot; Lipschitz says . &quot; We ' ve developed friendships. &quot; Inevitably , members of investment clubs report that what they have learned through the group has encouraged them to build their own portfolios . According to the NAIC , the average club has stock holdings worth $ 83 # 000 , while members ' individual portfolios average three times their club holdings . Rita Veen is one of many who invests both through her club and on_her_own . Veen , who lives_in Sherman Oaks , is an enrolled agent , a tax specialist licensed by the U.S. Treasury_Department . She is also the founder of the Enrolled Agents Investment Club , which meets on the second Sunday of every month at Encino Glen . Veen is a savvy small investor who does not hesitate to preach the gospel of economic self-sufficiency to people , especially divorced and single women , she meets in the course of doing their tax_returns . When she encounters a woman trying to live_on a mingy divorce settlement and a low-paying job , she says , &quot; I try to get her to carry her lunch and to buy a $ 25 savings bond every week. &quot; Veen believes systematic investing and other good financial habits are all that stand between people , whatever their incomes , and the fiscal abyss . &quot; We have to make people understand it ' s what you do with what you get , not how much you make. &quot; One of Veen ' s favorite vehicles for individual investing is the dividend reinvestment plan , or DRIP . Many companies have these no-fee or low-cost plans that allow members of the public to reinvest stock_dividends and even buy additional stock directly from the company at a discount . Veen ' s strategy is to invest excess cash_in the stock of companies that offer products or services she likes and that also have DRIP programs . She has a personal portfolio of some 17 stocks , often chosen by tracking the consumer preferences of Clifton , her husband of 43 years . Explains Veen : &quot; My husband drinks Budweiser so I bought Anheuser-Busch . My husband likes to go_to Bowlerland so I bought Brunswick. &quot; Most DRIPs require investors to hold at least one share of stock in their own name before they can enroll . NAIC facilitates this by allowing members to buy a single share_in many companies for $ 5 over the cost of the share , much less than the cost through even a discount broker . Founded in 1991 , Veen ' s investment club is an efficiently run operation that coordinates its meetings with the continuing education courses every enrolled agent must take . Members invest each month in multiples of $ 25 , although , Veen points_out , &quot; You only get one vote no matter how much of the club you own. &quot; Should a member want to drop_out of the club , the group writes him or her a check for the value of his or her shares . Alternatively , another member may want to buy_out the exiting member ' s stake . If the member ' s exodus forces the group to sell stock , the departing member must pay the brokerage fee . The tax implications of investing through a club are a snap for Veen ' s group . The club files a partnership return , and each individual receives a K-1 form to file with his or her own tax_return , reporting any income , capital_gains or losses . Currently , the club has almost half its $ 40 # 000 in holdings in cash ( at the end of 1993 , Veen reports , the group unloaded a_couple_of dogs and one stock that had had a nice run-up but didn ' t look as if it would continue to appreciate ) . Now she would like to see the group buy shares of the local drug_company Amgen , based in Thousand Oaks . She thinks it is a well-run company , and she also likes the fact that it hires and promotes minorities . &quot; The way they handle their employees tells you a lot about a company , &quot; she says . &quot; I think if we get_in now while the price is low , it ' s a good buy. &quot; She knows , however , that each member of her club will vote his or her own mind . &quot; These are all self-employed entrepreneurs and they are used to making decisions , so it ' s a little different from other clubs. &quot; Although it ' s hardly the most important decision they make , choosing a name is often a club ' s first real challenge . Some groups opt_for names worthy of a stand-up comic . Judy Powell , who founded an all-female club that meets in Agoura and Westlake Village , reports that her group calls itself &quot; Moneywi , with a dollar_sign for the s . Isn ' t that clever ? &quot; Nationally , there is at least one Bag_Lady Prevention Society , and local groups sport such puckish titles as the Take_Stock Group and Virgin Investors . When new investment clubs start_up , they often turn for advice to Don Shorkey , who is president of NAIC ' s Los Angeles Council , which oversees 350 groups from Santa Barbara to Orange County . Shorkey , who lives_in Hacienda Heights , is a forklift operator for Nestle Corp . in Mira Loma and a man who taught himself how to invest with help from the national organization . &quot; Each club has a uniqueness about it , &quot; says Shorkey , whose current group of nine men and women is called the Wanna-Be Investment Club . Members of Shorkey ' s club invest a minimum of $ 20 a month ( one contributed $ 200 at the last meeting ) . Made a realist by experience , Shorkey urges clubs to screen prospective members for compatible people . His own group asks people who want to join to attend three meetings , then to make a presentation on a stock . Present members must vote unanimously to accept a newcomer . &quot; You want to have compatibility in your group or you ' re not going_to make any headway , &quot; he counsels . &quot; You ' ll just sit there and argue. &quot; Shorkey thinks part of the reason tensions sometimes roil groups is because the subject is a sensitive one -- money . &quot; You start getting involved with money and , boy , you can have a lot of hard feelings. &quot; As to what to do with a disruptive club_member , Shorkey doesn ' t hesitate a nanosecond . &quot; If you ' re not comfortable with someone in the club , &quot; he advises , &quot; throw them out. &quot; Starting Up a Club * If you want to join a club , you will probably have to start one yourself . that ' s not difficult , according to the National Assn . of Investors Corp . Talk to two or three of your friends and suggest that they contact several of their friends who may be interested . You might also find prospective members at your church or temple , at_work , even among your neighbors . The NAIC advises looking_for three things in prospective club_members : people whose company you enjoy , people who can agree on an investing philosophy and people who are willing to study and report on stocks the group may want to invest in . * Hold a first meeting to discuss creation of the club , at your home if you wish . Make_it clear to prospective members that this is a preliminary meeting , not a commitment to join . If you plan to go the NAIC route , make_sure that you and two or three others have read the Investors Manual and are prepared to answer questions . * After the group has discussed investment philosophy and other fundamental issues , ask_for a show of hands by those who want to proceed with creating a club . Decide how the club will be organized ( most form as partnerships ) . Other matters that can be taken_up at the first meeting : election of officers , setting a regular meeting time and place , deciding how much individuals will invest each month , choosing a name and deciding whether to join NAIC , ( 810 ) 583-6242 . The Los Angeles Council of NAIC will hold an all-day investors fair Oct . 1 at the Proud Bird restaurant , 11022 Aviation Blvd. , near Los Angeles International Airport . The cost for non-members is $ 30 . For further information , call ( 310 ) 326-8150 .</TEXT>
