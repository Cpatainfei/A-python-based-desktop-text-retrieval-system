   <HEADLINE> ON THE ROAD AGAIN ; CABLE AND TELEPHONE_COMPANIES RESUME INFO HIGHWAY RIVALRY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The feud has resumed between the nation ' s cable TV operators and regional telephone_companies . The industries -- the Hatfields and McCoys of the telecommunications world -- briefly laid_down their arms last fall_in the interest of building the information highway . Bell Atlantic Corp . led the way , agreeing to pay $ 33 billion for Tele-Communications Inc. , the nation ' s largest cable firm . Then Bell Canada struck a deal to buy_into Jones Intercable Inc. , and Southwestern Bell Corp . proposed a $ 4.9-billion venture with Cox Enterprises Inc. Wall_Street cheered the new alliances , which promised to fuse the cable industry ' s entrepreneurial spirit with the financial resources and experience of the phone_companies . But the truce was short-lived . In late February , cable stocks plummeted , reflecting anticipation that the firms ' cash flow would dip after the Federal Communications Commission decided to cut cable rates for the second time in six months . Bell Atlantic and TCI scrapped their deal , blaming a clash in corporate cultures as well as the FCC . Southwestern walked away from Cox and Jones reopened its talks with Bell Canada . Only Time Warner Inc. -- which had sold a 25.5 % stake in its entertainment unit to U.S. West Inc. in 1993 -- emerged with a telephone_company ' s money in the bank . In the aftermath , cable TV operators and regional telephone_companies find themselves squared_off again in the costly race to build high-capacity systems to the home . Experts estimate that the two industries could spend $ 80 billion to $ 180 billion over the next decade constructing networks that will enable them to compete in each other ' s traditional businesses . Faced with such staggering costs , it is likely that the two industries may once more look_for ways to combine their efforts down the road . But for now , consumers and investors can only guess when the new services will reach their homes , and how much they ' ll cost . The outcome of the horse_race can be handicapped by looking_at publicly disclosed plans of the top cable operators and regional phone_companies . On a market-by-market basis , the winner is expected to be the first company in the neighborhood to offer the broadest service . &quot; The guy who gets there second is at a disadvantage because the penetration rates go_down , &quot; says Geoffrey W . Holmes , the Time Warner senior_vice_president overseeing the company ' s ambitious Full Service Network under construction in Orlando , Fla . &quot; From our perspective , you ' ve got_to build now. &quot; The feisty cable business claims an inherent advantage , because it has already completed the most labor-intensive part of its installation : stretching coaxial_cable to each subscriber ' s home . Although cable operators may spend $ 1 # 000 per home to upgrade their networks with fiber and two-way technology , telephone_companies will have to spend hundreds of dollars more per home to replace copper wires with coaxial_cable or upgrade their networks with compression technology that allows video signals to go_over existing phone_lines . &quot; We can do_it faster , &quot; Holmes says , &quot; and we can do_it cheaper. &quot; But the phone_companies are in a strong position to take_on cable . They see their rivals as vulnerable in financing , technology and marketing . &quot; People are not completely satisfied with cable providers , &quot; says Jay Bennett , director of broad-band infrastructure policy at Pacific Telesis , comparing cable ' s poor public reputation to the highly reliable telephone_companies ' . In the financial arena , the phone_companies tower over the cable operators . Collectively , the seven regional Baby Bells will spend $ 17 billion on capital_expenditures this year , compared to the $ 2.3 billion budgeted by 10 leading cable companies . Only two cable companies -- TCI and Time Warner -- have the resources to spend $ 500 million or more in a single year for construction of their networks . Smaller cable operators recognize their vulnerability at a time when cash flow is depressed and banks are unlikely to lend more money . The telephone_companies are &quot; just going_to swoop into our markets , &quot; moans one beleaguered cable executive who asked not to be named . Highly leveraged companies &quot; could be bludgeoned in just six to nine months , &quot; he says -- a message that could persuade some cable operators to sell_out rather than fight . Telephone_companies &quot; could pick_up a slew of the smaller guys , &quot; he concludes . &quot; The cable companies are dead meat and they know it , &quot; says Bill Davidson , a USC professor who has consulted for the Bells . For cable operators , salvation lies_in tapping the lucrative $ 90-billion telephone market and providing pay-per-view and other services that fall outside FCC price_controls . Some are wagering that within eight years , telephone_service could account_for 50 % of cable operators ' revenue , with 25 % coming from unregulated services . The telephone_companies , meanwhile , want to protect their core business by using new technology to slash operating_costs . And they want to barrel into the $ 21-billion cable TV business . Both industries , of course , expect to profit from the emerging information and retailing services made_possible by high-speed , two-way networks . They intend to vie for the $ 11-billion video rental business , take pieces of the $ 7-billion video_game industry and grab a chunk of the $ 50-billion to $ 70-billion catalogue sales business . Already , the phone_companies are_on the march . In a series of filings with the FCC , they have asked_for approval to install equipment over a three-year period that will give them the capability to offer interactive TV services to about 5 million customers in 20 metropolitan areas -- including Los Angeles , Orange County and San Diego -- at an estimated cost of $ 7 billion . But how fast -- and indeed , whether -- the phone_companies go_through with these plans depends_on a host of technological , economic and political factors . The rollout will depend_on the reception given to prototype systems , such_as Time Warner ' s Full Service Network in Orlando ; Viacom ' s test in Castro Valley , Calif. , and a U.S. West experiment under way in Omaha , Neb . &quot; It doesn ' t make_sense to make huge , multibillion-dollar investments too far ahead of the market , &quot; says Richard Holzopfel , a Bell South strategist , who suggested consumer demand for interactive TV may be years away . Despite such reservations , the phone_companies have little choice but to upgrade their systems and begin offering new services . &quot; If they just sit still , they will be sitting ducks , &quot; says Eli Noam , director of Columbia University ' s Institute for Tele-Information . Congress is weighing three bills intended to foster cable and phone_company competition . In the House , one measure would allow the Baby Bells to compete with long distance companies ; another would permit competition between cable TV and telephone_companies . A Senate bill would allow Baby Bells into cable TV but deny them entry to the long-distance business until they passed a &quot; threshold &quot; of substantial local competition . Passage has looked uncertain in the face of Baby Bell opposition . U.S. West Chairman Richard McCormick , for one , vowed early this month that his company would &quot; stop building the information highway within our service territory &quot; if the Senate bill passed unchanged . But Vice_President Al Gore -- a leading proponent of the infobahn -- is working behind the scenes , urging the Bells and long-distance companies to compromise . At the same time , cable and telephone_companies are skirmishing in court and regulatory_agencies . Bell Atlantic , for example , won a federal judge ' s permission last year to enter the cable business , and other phone_companies are trying_for similar rulings in their own regions . But the cable industry has retaliated with a spate of petitions asking regulators to impose tough rules to assure that the Baby Bells don ' t finance their cable TV onslaught with income from telephone customers . Last week , for example , the California Cable_Television Assn . asked the FCC to closely scrutinize Pacific Bell ' s application to offer video services in parts of California . And cable operators are pushing ahead in the phone business . Teleport Communications Group -- owned by four cable firms -- on Friday asked the California Public_Utilities Commission for permission to compete with local phone_companies in offering access to computer-based information resources . Both industries have found state regulators receptive to their construction of superhighway prototypes . In Omaha , U.S. West will soon begin a market test in an area with 60 # 000 residents . It expects to attract only about 9 # 000 subscribers initially , though the service will offer standard cable as well as interactive shopping and movies-on-demand . Its set-top boxes will double as game machines by using technology from Silicon_Valley game maker 3DO Co . In Orlando , Time Warner says it will offer its Full Service Network to 4 # 000 homes by year ' s end . FSN , as it ' s called , will allow subscribers to use hand-held remote-control devices to call_up movies on demand or order stamps from the post_office . But such high-tech wizardry will not come without a price . Time Warner predicts it will cost $ 250 per subscriber to upgrade the lines that carry its cable_systems into homes . The company then will install expensive computer_systems and switching devices in its facilities , as well as powerful set-top boxes and Hewlett-Packard printers in every home . Once perfected , the package is expected cost an additional $ 750 per household . To recoup that investment in four years , the company says , it will need an additional $ 14 per month in cash flow per subscriber , to be obtained from customers using new services and the retailers providing them . Even before the Orlando experiment begins , Time Warner staunchly vows to upgrade 85 % of its service nationwide by the end of 1998 to be &quot; FSN-capable , &quot; at an estimated cost of $ 5 billion . This month , Time Warner said it would cut its capital spending budget by $ 100 million -- to an estimated $ 650 million -- by imposing a hiring freeze and reducing maintenance . But the company is not delaying construction of FSN . Industry sources say Time Warner is wise_to move quickly , because its cable_systems are clustered in large population areas such_as New York , Houston , San Diego and Tampa , Fla. , that are likely to attract competition first from telephone_companies . Denver-based TCI has far more subscribers , but they are scattered across the country in smaller systems and may escape the first wave of stiff phone competition . So TCI may feel more comfortable with its threat to suspend $ 500 million of its $ 1-billion allocation for capital_expenditures this year in the wake of the rate rollback . Los Angeles-based Falcon Cable_Systems Co . -- the 12th-largest cable company -- said it will slash its capital budget to as little as $ 15 million . All told , the cable industry ' s cash flow could plunge to $ 7 billion or $ 8 billion this year , down from $ 10 billion in 1993 , according to Paul Kagan Associates , a cable TV research firm . Based on what cable companies can usually borrow from banks or raise in public_debt markets , the cable industry could be out $ 12 billion in capital . Yet some investors remain doggedly committed to cable TV . Gordon Crawford , senior_vice_president of Los Angeles-based Capital Research Group , says , &quot; The potential of capturing 20 % of the $ 90-billion telephone business more_than offsets the possible loss of some of its video business to the telephone companies. &quot; Indeed , Oppenheimer &amp; Co . analyst Jessica Reif recently declared that investors had overreacted in selling cable stocks . &quot; Time Warner will still be spending double what they did_in 1993 , &quot; she said . Reif remains hopeful that TCI will spend the $ 1 billion it initially allocated for 1994 . So the construction continues . At a minimum , both the cable and telephone industries say they are determined to benefit by slashing the costs of their traditional businesses with fiber-optic upgrades.- &quot; We are not counting_on an instant shift to a video revolutionary age , &quot; says Steve Harris , vice_president for external affairs at Pacific Bell . &quot; The real driver is building a more efficient telephony network. &quot; When the new_lines are laid , the phone_company won ' t have to send_out a technician to add a second phone_line or start service . Pacific Bell says 60 % to 70 % of the return on its $ 1 # 000 investment per household will come_in the form of lower costs . Still , there are staggering costs projected into the next century if phone_companies and cable operators build competing networks in a market-by-market battle . &quot; Economically , one wire would be cheaper , and we would get_it done faster and save billions of dollars , &quot; Harris says . &quot; But public policy is pushing for two wires. &quot; Skeptics insist that the head-to-head battle is unlikely to last . &quot; It ' s a game of liar ' s poker , &quot; says Ron Altman , an analyst at Furman Selz , a New York brokerage . &quot; Telephone and cable companies will compete in multimedia programming , but they will call a truce in their core businesses. &quot; Building the Superhighway Pending Federal Communications Commission approval , five of the regional Bell telephone_companies plan to rewire portions of their territories with upgraded networks able to carry the video , audio and data streams dubbed &quot; the information superhighway. &quot; Company : Ameritech Service_areas : Chicago ; Detroit ; Indianapolis ; Milwaukee ; Troy , Mich. ; Cleveland Approximate completion date : 1996 Planned investment ( billions ) : $ 2.4 Households potentially served : 1.26 million * Company : Bell Atlantic Service_areas : District_of_Columbia , other , unspecified cities Approximate completion date : 1996 Planned investment ( billions ) : 2.5 Households potentially served : 2.5 million * Company : Nynex Service_areas : Boston ; Warwick , R.I.
