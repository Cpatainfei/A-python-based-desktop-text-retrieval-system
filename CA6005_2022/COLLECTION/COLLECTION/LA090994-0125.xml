   <HEADLINE> POPE PLEADS IN BROADCAST MASS FOR BOSNIA PEACE ; BALKANS : FORCED BY THE CONFLICT TO CANCEL HIS VISIT TO SARAJEVO , THE PONTIFF DENOUNCES ' ABSURD , FRATRICIDAL WAR. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Enough war ! Enough destructive rage ! &quot; the Pope implored Thursday from an altar that should have been in Sarajevo . Preaching to faithful he didn ' t meet in a city he couldn ' t reach , Pope John Paul II lamented &quot; the desolate spectacle of a sinking humanity &quot; and prayed for peace in the Balkans . &quot; The dead of Sarajevo pray with us , &quot; the Pope said in Serbo-Croatian . &quot; All the victims of this cruel war in the light of God are praying for the survivors ; that they may have reconciliation and peace. &quot; Forced by unflagging war to abandon a trip to the Bosnian capital scheduled for Thursday , John Paul nevertheless delivered the homily he had prepared_for his hoped-for Mass there . &quot; A just peace should be reached as soon as possible . Peace is possible , if the priority of moral values over the claims of race and force are recognized , &quot; he said . John Paul ' s stage Thursday was not , as had been planned , an Olympic skating rink in range of snarling artillery batteries , but a Baroque courtyard in the summer papal palace at Castel Gandolfo near Rome . Still , at an emotional Mass transmitted live to Bosnia , John Paul changed not a comma . &quot; Our Father . . . , I , Bishop of Rome , the first Slav Pope , kneel before you crying_out , ' Deliver us -- from plague , hunger and war ! ' I know that many are united with me in this plea . Not only here in Sarajevo , in Bosnia and Herzegovina , but in all_of Europe and beyond , &quot; the Pope said . Since Bosnia ' s war began in 1992 , John Paul has repeatedly appealed for peace in Sarajevo , the urban vortex of Balkan bloodshed that he called Thursday an &quot; absurd , fratricidal war. &quot; * Bosnian Serbs whose forces are besieging Sarajevo charge that the Vatican sides with predominantly Roman_Catholic Croats in the Balkan caldron . John Paul will begin a weekend visit to Croatia on Saturday , but his own sympathies were manifest in Thursday ' s homily : &quot; God is_on the side of the oppressed , &quot; he said . &quot; He is beside the parents who cry_for their murdered children ; he hears the impotent cry of the defenseless and downtrodden ; he is in solidarity with women humiliatingly violated ; he is near to refugees forced to leave their land and their homes . Do not forget the sufferings of families , of the elderly , widows , the young and children . It is his people who are dying. &quot; The Pope ' s advisers had begged him for weeks to abandon the Sarajevo trip . But John Paul stubbornly refused , backing_out Tuesday only after he became convinced that his presence might stir violence . John Paul ' s determination to go_to Sarajevo someday is unslaked , though -- and so is his anger . &quot; There must be an end to a barbarism of this kind ! Enough war ! Enough destructive rage ! &quot; he thundered . &quot; It is not possible to any longer tolerate a situation that produces only the fruits of death : killings , destroyed cities , disrupted economies , hospitals lacking medicines , the sick and elderly abandoned , families in tears and torn apart. &quot; John Paul pleaded for the warring factions to forgive one another and to rebuild peacefully . At the end of Thursday ' s Mass , John Paul offered &quot; the kiss_of_peace &quot; to the patriarch and bishops of the Serbian Orthodox church , and sent a greeting to Serbs : &quot; I want . . . to embrace spiritually the entire Serbian people of Bosnia-Herzegovina to whom I offer my heartfelt wishes of prosperity in_harmony and in solidarity. &quot;</TEXT>
