   <HEADLINE> EUROPE ; A CENTURY-OLD SCANDAL HAUNTS FRANCE ' S ARMY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s been a century since the_French army framed Alfred Dreyfus , a young Jewish captain , on a charge of passing secrets to the Germans , convicted him in a closed-door court-martial and shipped him off to Devil ' s Island with a life prison sentence . Everyone involved in that shameful episode died long ago . Dreyfus himself was eventually exonerated and returned to active duty , fighting alongside his son in World_War I and receiving the_French Legion of Honor medal . But the Dreyfus Affair , which polarized the country at the time , refuses to go_away , much to the dismay of the_French army and the conservative government . Just a_few days ago , it claimed yet another military_officer ' s career . Col . Paul Gaujac , a reservist who headed the army ' s historical service , was summarily fired by Defense Minister Francois Leotard and given one hour to clear_out his desk and his government-paid apartment . His offense ? He published an article in the army ' s weekly magazine that did not completely accept the verdict of history ; it called Dreyfus ' innocence merely &quot; a thesis now generally accepted by historians. &quot; The article also characterized the furor over Dreyfus ' being railroaded as an assault by leftists and radicals on the army that led to the dismantling of French military intelligence . The article was seen by many in France as evidence of persistent anti-Semitism in the army and a growing trend toward historical revisionism on the political right . &quot; The army institutions suffer a deep ill , &quot; said Madeleine Reberioux , president of the League of Human_Rights , which was originally created to defend Dreyfus . &quot; And it is a long-lasting one. &quot; Gaujac ' s abrupt dismissal , along with suggestions that other heads may roll , has been a reminder of just how sensitive any mention of the late 19th-Century affair remains for many in France . &quot; It ' s very embarrassing for the military , &quot; said Denis Lacorne , a political analyst with the National Political Science Foundation . &quot; In fact , all_the historical evidence shows he was framed . But there are long family traditions in the military , and the majority are from the anti-Dreyfus camp. &quot; The specter of the mild-mannered , bespectacled Dreyfus has long haunted the country . Until the mid-1970s , radio and television_stations were forbidden to discuss the affair . And , during the 1980s , the army refused to allow a bronze statue of Dreyfus to be displayed at the Ecole Militaire , where the captain had been ceremoniously stripped of his symbols of rank after his conviction . The Dreyfus affair occurred during a period of intense nationalism and anti-Semitism in France . It began when a cleaning woman , working as a spy for the_French army , discovered some classified military secrets on a desk in the German Embassy . Dreyfus was implicated , mainly because of prejudice against him , because he was both Jewish and a native of German-speaking Alsace . When the army command realized that its case against Dreyfus was weak , it manufactured evidence , reasoning that the honor of the army was more important than one man ' s life and career . As Dreyfus began serving his sentence for treason on Devil ' s Island , the dreaded prison off the coast of French Guiana , France quickly divided into Dreyfusards and anti-Dreyfusards . The most famous Dreyfusard was the writer Emile_Zola , who fled to England after a court convicted him of slandering the army in his open_letter , titled &quot; J ' Accuse &quot; -- &quot; I accuse &quot; -- which was published in a newspaper . A swell of public support led to Dreyfus ' release after more_than four years . When a new army intelligence chief discovered the real culprit , Maj . Ferdinand Walsin-Esterhazy , Dreyfus received a presidential pardon and a court declaration of his innocence . But the army never reversed its verdict . For the anti-Dreyfusards still in France , the high-level reaction to Gaujac ' s article may have confounded any hopes of rewriting history . Leotard , the defense minister , recently gave permission to a French film director to use army locations for a documentary about Dreyfus ' ordeal . It is not one that will please many in the military . Guilty Until Proven Innocent A century after Alfred Dreyfus , a Jewish captain in the_French army , was framed , the scandal has resurfaced with accusations of lingering anti-Semitism in the military . THE DREYFUS CASE 1894 -- A cleaning woman in the German embassy , employed by the_French secret_service , finds document proving the treason of a French officer . Oct . 10 , 1894 -- The Minister of War accuses Capt . Dreyfus of being the author of the document . Oct . 15 , 1894 -- Dreyfus is arrested . The army decides his writing is similar to that on the document . Dec . 12 , 1894 -- Dreyfus sentenced to life in prison . Jan . 5 , 1895 -- Dreyfus is stripped of his rank in the courtyard of the Ecole Militaire . March , 1895-June , 1899 -- Dreyfus imprisoned on Devil ' s Island . Jan . 13 , 1898 -- Emile_Zola publishes &quot; J ' Accuse &quot; in the newspaper l ' Aurore . June 3 , 1899 -- The military_court sentence is annulled . Sept . 9 , 1899 -- The War Council again convicts Dreyfus , sentencing him to 10 years in prison . July 12 , 1906 -- The Supreme Court of Appeal annuls the sentence . July 13 , 1906 -- Dreyfus is reintegrated into the army with the rank of commander .</TEXT>
