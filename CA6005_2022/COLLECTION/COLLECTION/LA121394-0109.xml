   <TEXT> Why can ' t a woman be more like a man ? -- Prof . Henry Higgins in &quot; My Fair Lady &quot; * Prof . ' Enry ' Iggins should have hung_around a while . Women race_cars , ride thoroughbreds , make putts , serve aces , play point guard , hit_home runs , go_into space , direct movies , run corporations , even run countries nowadays . They not only play sports , they write them . They go_into battle , sit in the Senate , make our laws , judge them and set our policy . Santa Claus might turn_out to be a woman next . One of the secrets of the sports world for a long_time was that women were often the biggest and most dedicated group of fans in any sport . Baseball put &quot; Ladies_Day &quot; into the scene early in the game and those of us on the sports desk who checked our daily mail were_well aware women made_up the bulk of the readership some days . It was women , really , who first embraced pro basketball and it was nothing to see fully half the spectators courtside at the Forum female . Doris Day and Dyan Cannon were Hollywood representatives at games long before Jack Nicholson and Billy Crystal . It wasn ' t long before they wanted to do more_than watch and cheer . They wanted to comment , advise , second-guess , be a part of the sports scene . It wasn ' t long before women were as familiar a sight circulating in a sports locker_room as trainers . They had first cracked the barrier of sports journalism giving the &quot; woman ' s angle. &quot; Turned_out the woman ' s angle on a home_run or an end_run or an Olympic run wasn ' t significantly different . A home_run was a home_run , a goal was a goal , and , of course , an adverb was an adverb . Also , a &quot; No comment ! &quot; or a &quot; Get_out of my face ! &quot; knew no sex . There were some contretemps . Some athletes had as much trouble with gender equity as some editors . Some lawyers had to find court rulings that were conspicuously sexless but , of course , lawyers have no trouble finding what suits them or their clients . So , it ' s altogether appropriate that a colleague , Ron Rapoport of the Daily News , should see fit to collect and publish an anthology of sportswriting by women and show the craft is in good hands . Ron ' s collection is not &quot; You ' ve come a long way , baby. &quot; It doesn ' t treat the subject as Barbie Doll journalism . He notes that Mary Garber , who was to sportswriting what Amelia Earhart was to aviation , once presented several articles at a seminar of sports editors and asked them to identify the authors by sex . No one could . The book is called &quot; A Kind Of Grace &quot; and it offers a compilation of 73 pieces from the women ' s side of sports viewing . It is good stuff . For example : -- On Page 223 , Joan Ryan of the San Francisco Examiner begins her piece , &quot; Nine years before Mary Bacon put a bullet in her head at a Motel 6 in Ft . Worth , Tex. , she had already begun to die. &quot; Runyon ever say it better ? John Lardner ? -- On Page 104 , Claire Smith of the New York Times is holding forth : &quot; Steve Palermo and Dr. Lonise Bias would not seem to have a lot in common , one being a major_league umpire ( shot and paralyzed by an armed robber ) , the second being a doctor of religion . &quot; Bias has also suffered grievous wounds in her life , having lost two sons , one to a drug overdose , one to murderous gunplay . Len Bias , Bias ' talented basketball_player son , died of a drug overdose on the eve of a professional career with the Boston Celtics . &quot; She speaks_to athletes , most recently to major_league rookies who gathered_in Dallas last weekend . ' You have a responsibility on this earth . Will you cause other young_men to be a curse upon this earth or will you cause them to be a blessing ? For , you see , good advice with poor example is very confusing . You are educators whether you want to be or not . You will influence the decision of someone sitting at the table with you or someone who will be sitting in a ballpark looking_at you . Either you will lead them to a life of prosperity or one of death and destruction. ' &quot; Who needs Dickens ? Take another Joan Ryan piece on page 332 on the other side of the Super Bowl : &quot; Wendy Kusuma walked last Sunday afternoon through downtown San Francisco , which was_quiet and nearly empty . So many people were home watching the 49ers-Dallas Cowboys game . ' I had this feeling of dread : Before the night ' s over we ' ll have more battered women in either Dallas or San Francisco , ' she said . &quot; Football Sundays are heavy workdays for battered women ' s shelters . A woman is battered by a husband or lover every 15 seconds of every day . One-third to one-half of all female murder victims die at the hands of spouses or lovers . &quot; Next week ' s Super Bowl Sunday could be the worst day of the year for battered women . It usually is . A wife or girlfriend steps_in front of the television . She doesn ' t fetch his beer quickly enough . She can ' t keep the children quiet . She contradicts him in front of his friends . Anything can trigger the beating . But it ' s usually the beer , the betting , the bruising and banging of players on TV that lead the way . The athletes on screen -- men often admired to_the_point of reverence -- reaffirm the batterer ' s belief of what it takes_to_be a man : aggressive , dominant , physical. &quot; Go , Raiders ! On Page 114 , Michelle Kaufman of the Detroit Free Press zeroes_in on a familiar figure . &quot; Her father bought her a . 22 rifle when she was in kindergarten and chopped_off the stock so it would fit her tiny hands . Her mother has been married seven times . A drunk half-brother once tried to kiss her ; she retaliated by burning him in the neck with a curling iron . Twice in the past two years , she filed for divorce and sought restraining orders against her hot-headed husband . Three months ago , police seized a handgun from her after it went_off during an argument . &quot; Less than a month before the Winter_Olympics , Tonya Harding faces the toughest chapter of her tough life . &quot; Harding ' s background contradicts every image associated with figure_skating . The new U.S. champion enjoys drag racing , rebuilding engines , playing pool , hunting , fishing . She smokes cigarettes , despite a serious asthmatic condition . While other skaters choose classical_music , Harding has skated to such tunes as ' Wild Thing ' and ' Funky Cold Medina ' and her skating dresses are a far_cry from designer beauties. &quot; OK . How ' s that for who , what , when , where and why , the journalist ' s fab five ? On Page 360 , Helene Elliott of The Times takes the high road : &quot; When he was a rookie , and other players mocked his devout Christianity , and his decision to abstain_from sex until marriage , A.C. Green ' s steadfast faith helped him silence his doubters . ' One thing about me is , I don ' t feel I have many limitations . I feel I can really do anything . The Bible tells me -- and I really believe the Bible -- Philippians 4:13 says , &quot; I can do all things through Christ , who strengthens me , &quot; and this Scripture I take_to heart. ' &quot; Green runs a summer_camp for children and someday he ' d like to establish a home for unwed mothers . ' There has to be more emphasis put_on self-control and responsibility . If there ' s so_much sex education going_on in schools , why are teen-age birth_rates and abortion rates on the increase ? There ' s a lot of things that weigh_on my heart. ' &quot; Well , was Dr. Bob Schuller more eloquent at the Crystal Cathedral ? A powerful argument for gender equity is this book . Of course , these women never hit a major_league home_run , scored a touchdown in the NFL , served aces at Wimbledon or high-sticked Wayne Gretzky . Come_to think_of it , neither did we .</TEXT>
