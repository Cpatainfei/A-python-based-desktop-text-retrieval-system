   <HEADLINE> POP BEAT : NO APOLOGIES : KURT , BRUCE STAND_OUT IN ' 94 ; COBAIN ' S ' ALL APOLOGIES ' AND SPRINGSTEEN ' S ' STREETS OF PHILADELPHIA ' ACHINGLY PROJECT THE HUMAN VOICE IN THE YEAR ' S BEST SINGLES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nothing in pop_music can be more comforting or heartbreaking than the human voice -- and the voices that spoke most memorably in 1994 combined both qualities in remarkably tender and affecting works . In &quot; All Apologies , &quot; Kurt Cobain gave us an insider ' s view of a generation ' s alienation and doubt , while Bruce Springsteen ' s &quot; Streets of Philadelphia &quot; offered an outsider ' s gripping portrait of a man battling the ravages of AIDS . For all_the contemporary emphasis on techno razzle and production dazzle , these two gentle , acoustic recordings stand as the most compelling &quot; singles &quot; of the last 12 months . The term singles is employed out of a sense of tradition , although the reality in the ' 90s is that the songs and recordings that best define the pop pulse of a given year can be individual album tracks that never get released as formal singles . This has been true_to some degree for years , but it is becoming increasingly common . Three of the top five choices on my annual countdown of the most noteworthy pop moments of 1994 , in fact , haven ' t been released as singles because of marketing and other considerations . All three , however , have received the kind of mass exposure typically associated with hit singles -- either from MTV airplay or from being centerpieces in million-selling albums . This version of &quot; All Apologies , &quot; a song that first appeared on Nirvana ' s 1993 &quot; In Utero &quot; album , comes from Nirvana ' s &quot; MTV Unplugged in New York &quot; album that was released six months after Cobain ' s April suicide . Pearl Jam ' s &quot; Not for You , &quot; a blistering , youthful anthem that finishes third on today ' s list , is found on the Seattle rock_group ' s &quot; Vitalogy &quot; album , which has sold 2.1 million copies in just three weeks . Nine Inch Nails ' &quot; Burn , &quot; a volcanic_eruption of anger that is fourth on the list , is from the hit &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; soundtrack album . * Rock acts captured eight of the top 10 positions , reflecting rock ' s recapturing of the creative reins after seeing rap hold the artistic momentum through much of the ' 90s . Where four rap records , including Ice_Cube ' s &quot; It Was a Good_Day &quot; and Digable Planet ' s &quot; Rebirth of Slick ( Cool Like Dat ) , &quot; made my top 10 last year , only one rap record is represented this time . The annual Top 10 countdown begins with honorable_mentions -- formal singles or key album tracks that also touched_on some of the year ' s most important or engaging moments : * David Ball ' s &quot; Thinkin ' Problem &quot; ( Warner Bros. ) . Despite country_music ' s immense sales , few country records connect strongly with a pop audience , especially records as honky-tonk hard-core as this . Yet this wry tale of heartache , with its clever wordplay on barroom drinking_songs , is so lively that it spent almost three months on the national pop charts . * M People ' s &quot; Moving_on Up &quot; ( Epic ) . Dance hits with content are about as rare in the pop Top 100 as hard-core country , making this British trio ' s lively declaration of female independence all_the more welcome . It ' s in the spirited tradition of Gloria Gaynor ' s classic &quot; I Will Survive. &quot; * Snoop Doggy Dogg ' s &quot; Gin and Juice &quot; ( Death Row / Interscope ) . While rap didn ' t lose its commercial momentum during 1994 , few hits contained the biting social commentary that made rap such an explosive force in the late ' 80s and early ' 90s . The emphasis was again on party-minded bravado . Snoop and Dr. Dre delivered the best of the bunch with a record whose key grooves were as seductive as the best ' 60s soul . * All-4-One ' s &quot; So_Much in_Love &quot; ( Atlantic ) -- Speaking of classic soul , here ' s one of the dreamiest R &amp; B ballads in years . * Samuel L . Jackson and John Travolta ' s &quot; Royale With Cheese &quot; ( MCA ) . For something different , this snappy discussion about ordering a cheeseburger is from the &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; soundtrack album , and it will brighten any radio playlist . Given the success of the &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; and &quot; Natural Born Killers &quot; soundtracks , expect more albums to combine music and dialogue in fresh and inviting ways . Even if it lacks music , the track carries the spirit of the most disarming pop . * Offspring ' s &quot; Come Out and Play &quot; ( Epitaph ) . This tuneful single , with its exotic guitar lines , may sound like just any punk-edged hard-rock on first listening , but the theme about teens in conflict is surprisingly biting . * Elastica ' s &quot; Stutter &quot; ( DGC ) . Ready for a new_wave revival ? You will be once you hear this irresistible single from the most promising female-led band from England since the Pretenders . Justine Frischmann ' s singing is spunky and the guitar sound is glorious . Now , the year ' s 10 most memorable pop moments : 10 . Liz Phair ' s &quot; Supernova &quot; ( Matador / Atlantic ) . Rock ' s smartest and most tuneful songwriter in ages lusts_after her favorite guy with the kind of graphic detail that makes most of her male peers seem timid and tongue-tied . 9 . R.E.M. ' s &quot; What ' s the Frequency , Kenneth ? &quot; ( Warner Bros. ) . Is there a more consistent American rock_group ? This single -- which mixes the elusive lyric shading of R.E.M. ' s earliest records with its hardest musical textures yet -- is the fourth time in as_many years that an R.E.M. single has made the year-end 10-best list . 8 . Hole ' s &quot; Doll Parts &quot; ( DGC ) . It ' s easy to assume this story of emotional despair was written after Cobain ' s death , but Courtney Love , his widow , recorded it months before . &quot; Someday you will ache like I ache &quot; stands , in retrospect , as the most sobering line of the year in pop . 7 . Scarface ' s &quot; I Never Seen a Man Cry &quot; ( Rap-A-Lot ) . Who ever figured a member of Houston ' s notorious Geto Boys would come_up with the most sensitive rap single since Ice_Cube ' s &quot; It Was a Good_Day , &quot; the record that topped last year ' s 10-best list ? 6 . Me ' Shell NdegeOcello ' s &quot; If that ' s Your Boyfriend ( He Wasn ' t Last Night ) &quot; ( Maverick / Sire ) . This gifted new arrival uses her striking array of contemporary musical influences , from hip-hop to soul , to bring a ' 90s freshness to the age-old story of a romantic triangle . 5 . Beck ' s &quot; Loser &quot; ( DGC ) . With his cheeky sarcasm and oddball mix of folk and hip-hop , Beck startled the pop world as much as a bucket of cold water in the face . It even revived the old &quot; new Dylan &quot; cries_for the first time in almost a decade . 4 . Nine Inch Nails ' &quot; Burn &quot; ( Nothing / Interscope ) . From his spectacular appearance at Woodstock ' 94 to Nine Inch Nails ' extraordinary &quot; The Downward Spiral &quot; album , Trent Reznor was the artist of the year . More_than anything else in 1994 , this track reflected the restless aggression of young people who feel so victimized by an indifferent society that they ' re vowing to strike back . 3 . Pearl Jam ' s &quot; Not for You &quot; ( Epic ) . Eddie Vedder wrote it as an attack on the exploitation of youth by the media and the music business , but it stands as a battle_cry for anyone who feels abused by adult authority . Play this track for the next person who says they don ' t make rock ' n ' roll as stirring as they did_in the ' 60s and ' 70s . 2 . Bruce Springsteen ' s &quot; Streets of Philadelphia. &quot; ( Columbia ) . &quot; Streets , &quot; which won an Academy Award earlier in the year , expresses the helplessness and heartache of someone dying of AIDS as convincingly as Springsteen once conveyed the dreams and aspirations of youth . &quot; I walked the avenue ' til my legs felt_like stone / / I heard the voices of friends vanished and gone / / At night I could hear the blood in my veins / / Black and whispering in the rain / / On the streets of Philadelphia. &quot; 1 . Nirvana ' s &quot; All Apologies &quot; ( DGC ) . Does Cobain ' s death make the uncertainty and pain expressed in this song all_the more evocative ? Absolutely , but one of the joys of pop is that it doesn ' t exist in a vacuum . Just because one song may hold a special place in your heart because you first heard it the day you fell_in_love , another may always be especially poignant because it carries a darker memory . On &quot; In Utero &quot; before Cobain ' s death , &quot; All Apologies &quot; was clearly a great song -- perhaps Cobain ' s most nakedly confessional work . Listening to this version now adds_to the song ' s sad , melancholy tone -- causing us to reflect again on matters of why and what if . Another ' 94 Countdown : Here is colleague Dennis Hunt ' s list of the year ' s best singles , from 10 to 1 : Patty Loveless ' &quot; I Try to Think About Elvis , &quot; Warren G and Nate Dogg ' s &quot; Regulate , &quot; Ice_Cube and George Clinton ' s &quot; Bop Gun ( One Nation ) , &quot; Changing Faces ' &quot; Stroke You Up , &quot; Me ' Shell NdegeOcello ' s &quot; If that ' s Your Boyfriend ( He Wasn ' t Last Night ) , &quot; Crystal Waters ' &quot; 100 % Pure Love , &quot; Sheryl Crow ' s &quot; All I Wanna Do , &quot; Salt-N-Pepa and En Vogue ' s &quot; Whatta Man , &quot; TLC ' s &quot; Creep &quot; and Ahmad ' s &quot; Back in the Day. &quot;</TEXT>
