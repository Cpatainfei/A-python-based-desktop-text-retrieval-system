   <HEADLINE> 3-HOUR TOUR : FEAST ON NATURE IN PARK , THEN ON PERSIAN FOOD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If the antidote for civilization is wilderness , rugged Santiago Oaks Regional Park offers a good dose . The trail system seems to go forever , and to places with names like Robbers Roost . If you gotta go_back to civilization , it may as well be Persian , and the &quot; fine Persian cuisine &quot; at Darya ; start with a bite of raw onion and end with refreshing faloodeh -- &quot; shredded iced starch in sugar. &quot; 10 to 10:10 : Windes Drive wends its way among homes for the horsy_set and ends at the Santiago Oaks park office . Stop in to get a map and to admire the stuffed bobcat and great horned owl . &quot; Bob Bobcat is running_around out there , &quot; noted park ranger Kathy Vanderpool . &quot; I ' ve seen him , and he ' s beautiful . And on our campfire walk the other night we saw two juvenile great horned owls , two babies , just at the beginning of the dam trail. &quot; Must be some trail . Vanderpool was in fact referring to the path to County Historic Landmark No . 151 , a submerged dam built_in 1879 . She suggested a visit to the nature center , a hike to the dam and , energy permitting , a more demanding jaunt to Robbers Roost , called Robbers Peak on official maps . There , she said , &quot; once upon a time , robbers and outlaws hung_out , when they ' d stole the gold and run away. &quot; A fairy tale ? You decide . 10:10 to 10:30 : In the nature center are a stuffed redtail hawk with a snake , also stuffed , in its beak , and a stuffed opossum and badger . In the center of the center is a display of &quot; undifferentiated sespe and vaqueros &quot; rocks ; while they indeed seem undifferentiated , the vaqueros apparently contains &quot; fossil evidence of the past. &quot; A &quot; Gabrielenos Indian Nature Market &quot; exhibit shows how the county ' s indigenous people used mugwort instead of Bayer aspirin for headaches , poison_oak for Rit Dye Black 15 , amole instead of Ivory soap , and ground-up coast_live_oak acorns instead of Gold Medal All Purpose Enriched White Flour . &quot; Just the Bare Facts About Grizzly Bears &quot; includes the only known photograph of a Santa Ana grizzly -- oddly enough called &quot; Little Black_Bear &quot; -- and notes that famous bear hunter Jonathan Watson killed a grizzly at Robbers Peak . 10:30 to 10:45 : Outside the center are shaded picnic tables and places to tie your horse . Before hitting that dam trail , there are drinking fountains for people and remarkably similar fountains for horses . And note the posted warnings : &quot; Mountain_Lion Country a Risk , &quot; &quot; Rattlesnakes May Be Found &quot; and &quot; Ticks Occur. &quot; One rather large sign along the trail identified surrounding vegetation as poison_oak . Critters abounded . Lizards did pushups in the middle of the path , baby lizards skittered about , squirrels scurried , woodpeckers pecked , and other birds flitted from branch to branch . Arachnophiles would have admired fairly sizable , colorful spiders in amazingly engineered webs . Signs at the Carpenter Serrano dam say not to wade in the water , but the murky pool would dissuade most comers anyway . Dragonflies patrol the surface , only occasionally coming_to_light on the rocky shorelet . The use of the dam by people was discontinued in 1976 , but it now serves as a source of water for park animals . 10:45 to noon : Near the dam is a set of steps . I took them , and within minutes I didn ' t know where the heck I was . There are few directional signs_in the park ; if you have a destination in mind , the rangers in the office can mark your map , but that still might not help a whole_lot . I headed in what I felt might possibly be the general direction of Robbers Roost . Trails seemed to go nowhere , everywhere and anywhere , but by always taking the steepest choice possible , I eventually happened_upon what seemed an ideal roost for robbers . It was a dramatic 360-degree lookout , and at the points of a compass that I didn ' t have were stables , power_lines , the Villa Park dam and five ridgelines receding into the distance . Notorious bandits such_as Joaquin Murieta and Three Finger Jack , who terrorized local communities and preyed upon the Butterfield Stage in the late 1800s , easily spotted sheriff ' s posses from such a vantage . Noon to 1 : You can plan a takeout feast on the nature center picnic tables , or you can enjoy a complete change of scenery , and air conditioning , at newly remodeled Darya . Dough , a yogurt drink with mint , will cool you down from your hike . Eating those raw onions on the table may cause somewhat dubious breath , but the torshi appetizer -- aged pickles , carrots , cauliflower , eggplants and herbs in grape vinegar ( $ 2.50 ) -- will literally take your breath away . Kebabs are $ 7 to $ 13 , but &quot; daily dishes &quot; are $ 7 to $ 9 , and the same dishes served at lunchtime on weekdays are in the $ 6 range . Fesenjan is cooked walnuts in pomegranate sauce served with chicken and a huge mound of basmati rice . Baghali polo is rice mixed with dill_weed and lima_beans and comes_with lamb shanks . Adas polo , rice mixed with raisins , lentils , dates and saffron , came_with chicken unfortunately baked dry ; ask_for a little broth on the side . Squeeze a little lemon in your faloodeh ( $ 2.50 ) , a rose_water , shredded noodle dessert , and bring the meal to a delightful end . 3-Hour Tour 1 . Santiago Oaks Regional Park 2145 N .
