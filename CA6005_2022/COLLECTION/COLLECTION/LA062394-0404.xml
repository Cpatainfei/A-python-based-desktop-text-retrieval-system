   <HEADLINE> JAPAN ADMITS TO WWII LABOR ABUSES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Japanese government Wednesday acknowledged for the first time that it forced tens of thousands of Chinese to work in Japan under brutal conditions during World_War_II . Although the existence of the forced-labor program was widely known , the Foreign Ministry had refused to accept it , maintaining that documents with evidence were burned after the war . &quot; It is regrettable that it caused pain to the Chinese people , &quot; Foreign Minister Koji Kakizawa told a parliamentary committee . Japan ' s admission followed a Foreign Ministry investigation begun last year when a Chinese resident of Tokyo , Chen Kungwang , publicized documents given to him by a Foreign Ministry official . The official had kept the documents secret for 40 years , disobeying orders to destroy them . The documents showed 38 # 935 Chinese were forcibly brought_to Japan to work in mines and factories between 1943 and 1945 .</TEXT>
