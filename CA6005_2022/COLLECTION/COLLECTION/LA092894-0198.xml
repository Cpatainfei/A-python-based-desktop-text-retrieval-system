   <HEADLINE> COMPUTER_FILE / LAWRENCE J . MAGID : THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPONENTS , FALLING PRICES MAKE THIS A GOOD TIME TO BUY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you ' re thinking about buying a personal_computer for your home , you ' ve picked a good time . Prices over the next few weeks are expected to reach new lows as computer makers get ready for what looks_to be a blockbuster holiday season . About a third of American homes now have PCs , which means there are still plenty of potential first-time buyers , as well as those looking_to replace older machines . A key reason for the falling prices is the availability of lower-cost , high-performance components . Intel , which has defined the standard for IBM-compatible central_processing_unit chips , has come_out with faster , more energy-efficient and less expensive versions of its Pentium chip ( a CPU that can run_up to twice as fast as the 66-megahertz 486 DX2 , the leading CPU ) . Aggressive marketing of the Pentium has put downward pressure on 486 prices . I ' ve tested several Pentium-based machines and am now using a Dell XPS P90 , which features the 90-MHz version of the Pentium . In terms of raw processing speed , it ' s twice as fast as my 66-MHz 486 system -- but that extra speed doesn ' t show_up with most of the programs I run . If you ' re buying a new machine for typical business applications such_as word_processing , spreadsheets and communications , you ' ll save about $ 500 and still get excellent performance by getting a high-end 486 system instead of a Pentium machine . * If you ' re going to buy a Pentium , I recommend the 90-MHz over the 60-MHz version . They are considerably faster and more energy-efficient . Ironically , my kids and I do notice the Pentium ' s extra punch when we ' re using drawing and graphics programs and some multimedia CD-ROMs . It ' s been a big surprise to the PC industry that home computer users ( like my kids ) often need more power than office workers , especially if they ' re playing a lot of games . But I still think a 486 , for most people , represents a better value . Keep_in mind that all 486 CPUs are not equal . Usually there ' s another number -- such_as 33 , 50 or 66 -- that indicates the CPU ' s speed in megahertz . The higher the better , but a small difference in speed ( say 50 compared to 66 ) isn ' t a big deal . An SX after the number means there ' s no math co-processor , which usually isn ' t a problem unless you ' re a heavy spreadsheet user or plan to use computer-aided_design software -- or want top performance on one of a handful of games that take_advantage of the co-processor . Some PCs have &quot; Intel Inside &quot; stickers showing there is an Intel-brand CPU . It ' s clever marketing , but don ' t be afraid of non-Intel CPUs , such_as those from AMD and Cyrix . Major manufacturers , including Compaq and IBM , have found these CPUs to be reliable and compatible . Apple is now shipping Power Macintosh machines with the Power PC CPU . These are very fast , but only if you ' re using software designed for this chip . Older Mac programs may actually run a little slower on the PowerMacs than on other models . If you buy an old-style Mac , be sure it ' s a model that can be upgraded to the Power PC . * The CPU isn ' t the only chip that helps determine a computer ' s speed . The amount of random_access_memory is very important . Many low-cost home systems come_with four megabytes , but that ' s not enough if you want maximum performance with Windows or Macintosh software . You ' re much better off with eight or more megabytes : An extra four MB should add between $ 150 and $ 200 to the price of the machine . A large hard-disk drive is also important for home users . Graphics , sound and video files are much larger than the type of data files typically used by businesses , and some multimedia CD-ROMs copy several megabytes of information to your hard_disk . For your eyes ' sake , be sure to get a good monitor . Never buy a color monitor that has a dot pitch greater than 0.28 millimeters . ( The dot pitch is the distance between pixels -- the higher the number , the blurrier the image. ) There is also the issue of interlaced and non-interlaced monitors . The latter are less likely to flicker , but they tend to be more expensive . Don ' t be seduced by a flashy in-store graphics demo : A poor monitor can be disastrous if you ' re working with text , so test the monitor by looking_at normal-size text in a word-processing program such_as Windows Write . * A lot of home PCs come_with a modem , but be sure to ask about its speed . Don ' t settle for a 2 # 400-bit-per-second modem now that 14 # 400 bps is available for less than $ 100 . The faster modems make a very big difference when you ' re on line , and most 14 # 400-bps modems can also be used to send and receive faxes . You can now buy 28 # 800-bps modems for less than $ 200 , but very few on-line services currently support that speed . Also , make_sure there ' s room to grow . If the machine doesn ' t have a CD-ROM player , be sure there ' s an &quot; external_drive bay &quot; that will accommodate one . Also be sure to have at least two empty expansion_slots in case you want to add a scanner or other peripheral . Unless you have a PC guru in the family , you ought to buy from a company with a toll-free technical support line and a good warranty . I recently had a chance to test Dell and Compaq ' s 24-hour customer support and service and came_away impressed . You don ' t have to go_to a big company for a well-made machine . Don ' t overlook no-name &quot; clone &quot; builders in your community -- but make_sure they ' re reputable and able to stand behind what they sell . What to Look_for in a Home PC * CPU for standard PC ( IBM-compatible ) : A 50-megahertz or 66-MHz 486 DX2 is fine for most users . Get the 75-MHz or 90-MHz Pentium if you ' re willing to pay about $ 500 for faster performance . * CPU for Macintosh : A Power PC or 68040 that can be upgraded to Power PC * Memory : Eight megabytes * Monitor : A &quot; dot pitch &quot; of 0.28 millimeters or less ; non-interlaced is better * Hard disk : At least 200 megabytes ; 400 or more is better . Look_for an access_time of 12 milliseconds or less . * Modem : 14 # 400 bit-per-second with built-in fax capabilities * Support : Buy from either a reputable local builder or a brand that offers toll-free technical support and a warranty , including overnight delivery of replacement parts . * Extras : A double-speed CD-ROM_drive and sound_system</TEXT>
