   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; HEARING ON PIPELINE PLAN HELD ; OIL : THE $ 150-MILLION PROJECT WOULD CARRY CRUDE 130 MILES THROUGH THE SANTA CLARITA AND SAN FERNANDO VALLEYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first public hearing on plans for a $ 150-million , 130-mile crude_oil pipeline through the Santa Clarita and San Fernando valleys was held Monday night at Pyramid Lake . The California Public_Utilities Commission and U.S. Forest Service , which have to approve the plans before construction can begin , sponsored the meeting at the Vista Del Lago Visitors Center , the first of four hearings scheduled for points along the proposed pipeline route from Bakersfield to Long_Beach . Representatives from government_agencies began by describing the project -- a joint_venture of Chevron , Texaco and other oil_companies -- designed to deliver crude_oil to refineries in El Segundo and Wilmington . The oil would first travel from the Point Arguello offshore field near Santa Barbara via an existing pipeline to the Bakersfield area . If the new pipeline is built , it would provide an alternative to oil_tanker traffic along that coast . By law , all tanker travel_along that route is to end by Jan . 1 , 1996 . Before the meeting , some officials expressed at least limited support for the plans . &quot; We tried to stop the whole_thing in the beginning , &quot; said Santa Clarita City Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy . &quot; We wanted it tankered in , but that didn ' t turn_out to be safer either. &quot; A handful of residents from Kern and Los Angeles counties who attended the meeting raised concerns about the potential danger caused by a rupture from the 20-inch underground pipe . &quot; The earthquake danger in this area is extreme , &quot; said Sally Reed , a member of the Sierra Club ' s Kern Kaweah chapter . &quot; One of these days we ' re going to know that and have oil up and down the Grapevine for months , &quot; she warned . Pat Saletore , chair of the Santa Clarita Valley chapter of the Sierra Club , said before the meeting that the prospect of a pipeline makes her uneasy , especially in the wake of a spill from a pipe that ruptured in the Jan . 17 earthquake , spilling 190 # 000 gallons of crude_oil into the Santa Clara River . That spill killed about 700 animals and polluted 17 miles of the river . &quot; It concerns me that ( the new pipeline ) is going_to be crossing the river there , &quot; she said . &quot; Anytime you ' ve got something that ' s crossing a waterway , you ' ve got the potential for real problems . We saw that during the earthquake. &quot; Modern pipelines use steel and construction techniques that have improved significantly since pipes by other companies were installed decades ago , said Tom Rooney , an engineer for Pacific Pipeline System Inc. , a co-sponsor of the project . He said the new pipelines are strong , but flexible , allowing them to withstand the shock of earthquakes and other hazards . &quot; that ' s the very reason for a new one , &quot; he said . &quot; The one that got oil all_over the place was built back around 1925. &quot; The new 130-mile pipeline would generally follow The Golden State Freeway through the Angeles National Forest to Glendale , where it would turn south through Watts before reaching the refineries . It is the second proposed route for the pipeline . The original route called_for an entirely new 171-mile pipeline across Ventura and Los Angeles counties close to State_Highway 126 , but that plan was abandoned as too costly after the Los Angeles City_Council opposed it and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency raised questions . Construction of the pipeline is expected to take about 10 months and could be completed by the end of 1995 if approved , according to California Public_Utilities Commission documents . Additional meetings to discuss the project are scheduled today at Aragon Elementary School at 1118 Aragon Ave . in Los Angeles , Wednesday at the Wilmington Boys &amp; Girls Club at 1444 West Q St. , and Thursday at the San Fernando City_Council Chambers , 117 McNeil St . All meetings begin at 7 p.m .</TEXT>
