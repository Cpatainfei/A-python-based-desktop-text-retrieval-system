   <HEADLINE> U.S. TO REVIEW MEDICINAL MARIJUANA BAN ; HEALTH : HHS OFFICIALS STRESS THAT THE ACTION DOES NOT MEAN ITS USE WILL BE APPROVED . THE BUSH STAFF HELD THAT THE DRUG COULD BE HARMFUL TO SOME PATIENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Federal health officials said Wednesday that they are reviewing a Bush_Administration decision to prohibit the medical use of marijuana , but they stressed that their action does not necessarily mean the ban will be lifted . Dr. Philip Lee , assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services , said that the Administration agreed to take another look_at the ban after being asked to do so by several members of Congress , including Rep . Henry A . Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment . &quot; The review is in keeping with the practices of regularly reviewing policies and procedures but does not signal a change in the current policy , nor imply that current policy will be reversed , &quot; Lee said in a statement . One health official called the process &quot; fairly routine. &quot; Nevertheless , the issue could further fuel the uproar created by Surgeon_General Joycelyn Elders , when she suggested in recent remarks that the question of making drugs legal deserves more study . From 1976 until 1992 , the federal_government allowed a small number of individuals on a case-by-case basis to take marijuana for medicinal purposes . These included relieving the nausea and appetite loss that is often a side_effect of cancer and AIDS therapy , easing muscle spasms associated with spinal_cord injuries or multiple_sclerosis and lessening eye pressure in those suffering from glaucoma . But in a March , 1992 , ruling , the Bush_Administration discontinued the program , saying that the drug ' s therapeutic value was unproven and that it could cause harm to some patients . Its use has been associated with lung ailments and other problems . At the time , about 15 patients were taking the illegal drug under the special program and were allowed to continue . But hundreds of others who had applied for permission were denied . William Ruzzamenti , director of congressional and public affairs for the Drug Enforcement Administration , insisted Wednesday that -- despite the current review -- a reversal of the 1992 decision is not likely at this time . But Kevin Zeese , vice_president and counsel for the Drug Policy Foundation , a private nonprofit education organization , urged the Clinton_Administration to move quickly to end the ban . &quot; It ' s time we stopped making criminals out of seriously ill Americans by denying them a medicine that obviously helps , &quot; Zeese said . &quot; The ban on medical marijuana is inconsistent with the research of marijuana ' s effectiveness and inconsistent with the feelings of patients and doctors throughout the country. &quot; Marijuana is classified under federal law as a Schedule 1 drug , meaning that it has a high potential for abuse and has no acceptable medical uses in the United States . Nor is it considered safe for medical purposes . Nevertheless , some studies have found a certain measure of support within the medical_community for its medicinal use . A 1991 Harvard University-sponsored study , for example , found that 40 % of U.S. cancer specialists surveyed recommended that their patients smoke marijuana to relieve chemotherapy-induced nausea and 48 % said that they would prescribe it in certain cases if the drug were legal . At this time , the American Cancer Society does not support marijuana use for cancer patients to relieve the nausea associated with chemotherapy . &quot; There are other medications just as effective that will not have the side_effects of marijuana , &quot; said a Cancer Society official . According to the society , two forms of marijuana have been used to treat the side_effects of chemotherapy : cigarettes and compounds related to the active chemical constituent of marijuana taken orally . One such compound currently available by prescription is dronabinol ( Marinol ) , a synthetic form of the active marijuana constituent delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol ( THC ) . Smoking marijuana_cigarettes can result in other problems , such_as lung damage , the Cancer Society official said . Furthermore , many cancer experts believe that dronabinol , the oral medication , is not as effective as other drugs or drug combinations in controlling nausea and vomiting . It is not well absorbed by some patients and can cause a &quot; high &quot; that &quot; may be unpleasant for elderly patients and those inexperienced in marijuana use , &quot; she said .
