   <HEADLINE> THE THEOLOGIAN OF TALK ; THE QUESTION IS WHETHER JUSTICE EXISTS AND REASON CAN BENEFIT SOCIETY . IT ' S POSTMODERN TO SAY NO , BUT JURGEN HABERMAS , A GERMAN PHILOSOPHER , DISAGREES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A debate has been raging in the world of scholars and intellectuals . On one side are the &quot; postmodernists &quot; -- the thinkers whose ideas inspired the playful , hybrid buildings , outfits and artworks that now grace the American landscape ; the thinkers who encouraged a generation of graduate_students to &quot; deconstruct &quot; such long-treasured notions as &quot; reason &quot; and &quot; justice. &quot; The major figure on the other side of this debate is Jurgen Habermas . Habermas is a German philosopher -- &quot; the leading systematic philosopher of our time , &quot; Richard Rorty of the University of Virginia calls him . But Habermas comes_to this debate as much more_than just a philosopher . &quot; In terms of range and depth there is no one close to him , &quot; says Thomas McCarthy , a professor of humanities and philosophy at Northwestern University . &quot; Habermas has been able to go_into discussions in political_theory , in sociology , in psychology , in legal theory -- in a dozen different disciplines -- and become one of the dominant voices in each one. &quot; In the academic world nowadays , such range , depth and dominance attract an endless stream of conference invitations . Habermas accepts his share . And sometimes at these conferences , particularly if Americans are in_attendance , he ' ll find himself surrounded by postmodernists . Swords will be raised . The debate will resume . The postmodernists might begin questioning , for example , whether &quot; reason &quot; isn ' t just the name the powerful give to their rationales for holding power or whether &quot; justice &quot; isn ' t just an excuse for the majority to impose its morality on the minority . ( One such conference was dominated by legal theorists from Harvard Law School. ) Habermas , an aficionado of open debate , will fight_back , enthusiastically , aggressively . Whether he has been a voice of reason and justice is disputed in philosophic and political circles , but Habermas certainly has been a staunch advocate of the importance of these principles . He believes we can reason_out solutions to our problems , that just institutions can lead to a fairer society . And when irony-wielding postmodernists make light of these possibilities , Habermas responds with formidable barrages of scholarship and logic . This is high drama , or at least what passes for that in academia . Feet wiggle nervously under chairs . In the audience , students and professors furrow their high brows and jot_down each deft riposte . At stake in these confrontations is a crucial 20th-Century intellectual issue : Are there certain basic standards underlying our behaviors -- standards like reason and justice ? Or is the world a swampy , relativistic place , where we play our games or seek some power in the muck ? For Habermas , something else is at stake here , too : A crucial 20th-Century political issue . According to a number of those who have watched him at such conferences , Habermas sometimes grows exasperated with his cynical antagonists . When that happens , he might pull a microphone toward himself and suddenly silence the others on the panel by saying something like this : &quot; In the United States , you have a 200-year-old tradition of constitutionalism . You have the luxury of questioning those ideals . Where I come from , we don ' t. &quot; Where he comes from , Habermas is not just a star academic . For 40 years , he has been in the public arena fighting to keep Germany headed in the direction of reason , justice and other ideals he now hears postmodernists deconstructing . And that fight -- a political fight -- goes_on . Jurgen Habermas , as often happens when he reads the newspaper , was agitated . It was 1992 , and right-wing attacks on immigrants and foreign workers , which had begun in the former East_Germany , were continuing . &quot; Every week there were reports about another three or four incidents , &quot; Habermas recalls at his home outside Munich . &quot; And as you read the paper every morning , you could not help but get more and more angry -- not just at those who did_it , but at those who played it down , who turned their backs , who worried that talking_about it would hurt Germany ' s image in the world . And then , when a certain threshold was passed , you couldn ' t help but write an article. &quot; When Habermas writes such an article for a German newspaper , as he does three or four times a year , it usually causes a stir . &quot; He ' s a public figure , &quot; explains Peter Glotz , a leader of Germany ' s Social Democratic Party . &quot; His writings don ' t influence masses of blue-collar workers , but they are read by a lot of German party officials and journalists and so on . In this way he is very influential. &quot; Habermas is , in other words , that rare thing : a public intellectual -- &quot; the most visible of his generation , &quot; asserts Northwestern ' s McCarthy . Certainly , no contemporary American scholar has had such impact upon political debates . And Habermas ' political significance would be even greater were it not for an odd quirk : He is one of the few public figures today who refuses to go_on television . A cleft_palate gives a slightly asymmetric feel to Habermas ' square , strong face and has left him with a minor speech impediment . Might this be behind his reluctance to appear before the cameras ? &quot; The pragmatic reason why I refuse these requests is that I have to protect the time and rest ( I need ) for my professional work , &quot; he notes . Then Habermas adds , &quot; Maybe there are also reasons of a more personal nature. &quot; Print is Habermas ' medium : Books , of course , and he reads and writes a wide variety of them , including many difficult philosophic tomes . But not just books . &quot; I need to read a newspaper each morning to feel that I ' m still participating in the world , &quot; the philosopher declares . &quot; Reading the newspaper arouses passions. &quot; Those passions grow most intense when he sees evidence that Germany is backsliding . Habermas was 15 when the Allies defeated Germany in 1945 . He had been a member of the Hitler Youth and had been sent , during the last months of the war , to &quot; man the western defenses. &quot; His bourgeois father had been a &quot; passive sympathizer &quot; with Nazism . Nazi society was the only one the young Habermas had known . Then the Nuremberg war-crimes trials started , and the first documentary_films on the concentration_camps appeared . &quot; All at once we saw that we had been living_in a politically criminal system , &quot; Habermas has explained . His political life began with this awakening . It established what he labels the major &quot; motif &quot; of his politics : a vigilance against any recurrence of such &quot; politically criminal &quot; behavior . This &quot; motif &quot; was in_harmony with the beliefs of the &quot; Frankfurt School , &quot; an extraordinarily distinguished collection of leftist , mostly Jewish , philosophers and social thinkers gathered_in the Institute of Social Research at the University of Frankfurt . After the war , when most of its members returned from exile , the institute was led by two of the world ' s foremost intellectuals , Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer . The aggressively interdisciplinary way of thinking that the Frankfurt School developed -- &quot; Critical Theory &quot; it was called -- aimed to put philosophic ideas to the task of diagnosing social problems . There were years when it was difficult to get_through college in Europe without being drawn into debates about the success of this project . Habermas became Adorno ' s assistant in 1956 . He was given Horkheimer ' s chair in 1964 . Habermas quickly found his own voice as a theorist , but he has never stopped trying to apply philosophic ideas to social problems . Indeed , he has had as much to say about the perils of intolerance , repression and poverty as any other modern philosopher . Habermas subsequently became a political figure -- and a target . Student radicals attacked him in 1968 for being insufficiently sympathetic with their tactics . The right derided him and the other members of the Frankfurt School in the 1970s as the &quot; spiritual fathers of the terrorists. &quot; Habermas had denounced these young German kidnapers and bombers , but , his critics noted , many of them had read his calls_for a more free and equal society . Habermas continues to get_into squabbles -- with those who sped Germany toward reunification ( too quickly , in his view ) ; with those who want to take_apart his country ' s ambitious system of social_welfare , and with those he believes to be opponents of open debate or proponents of intolerance . In recent years , his most visible fight has been with German revisionist historians , who attempted , in his words , &quot; to make Auschwitz unexceptional &quot; by connecting it to other 20th-Century massacres . Habermas labeled their arguments &quot; astonishing &quot; and &quot; transparent &quot; as he took them on one by one in a series of newspaper_articles . Along the way he reminded his readers of &quot; the obligation incumbent upon us in Germany -- even if no one else were to feel it any longer -- to keep alive , without distortion and not only in an intellectual form , the memory of the sufferings of those who were murdered by German hands. &quot; Anti-Semitism is a subject on which Habermas has been particularly vigilant . &quot; I ' ve never met a non-Jew who is more sensitive to these issues -- intellectually and personally , &quot; says his friend Richard J . Bernstein , a philosophy professor at the New School in New York . The word conscience is used frequently , at least by those on the left half of the political spectrum , in describing Habermas ' role in German politics . &quot; He will always stand_up and say the right thing at the right moment , &quot; asserts Anselm Haverkamp , a literature professor from Germany who now directs the Poetics Institute at New York University . &quot; And he says it without the politicians saying , ' Well , this is just an idealistic philosopher. ' No one would say that about Habermas. &quot; * Habermas ' political ideas , he is happy to acknowledge , are connected to his philosophy . But when he is asked to sum_up that philosophy , he grows quiet for some minutes . &quot; I must say that I hate that question , &quot; he finally responds , a smile lifting the corners of his wispy mustache . &quot; I hate this idea that you have one great idea , as ( the German philosopher Martin ) Heidegger always maintained you should. &quot; Of course , Habermas has had a large_number of good ideas as he has sailed from one research area to another . But behind his contributions to all these different disciplines there seems to have been one central theme : his theory of &quot; communicative action. &quot; As Seyla Benhabib , a professor of political_theory at Harvard , explains : &quot; Habermas believes human social life rests_on our capacity to have more or less clear communication with each other. &quot; We communicate -- to paraphrase Descartes -- therefore our society exists . A rather antiquated , idealistic message to be spreading , some might think , in a world of abusive talk-show hosts , misogynistic rap_groups and earphone-encased teen-agers . Habermas is , to be sure , as concerned about pop culture as the next philosopher . But he continues to believe that somewhere behind the better of our attempts to communicate with each other , there have to be some shared values , shared respect and acknowledged equality . He sees the participants in conversations , in other words , as playing_on the same teams . And as they talk together , Habermas insists , they make an effort to employ reason . &quot; This may_not seem like a big deal , &quot; Benhabib acknowledges . &quot; But it has fundamentally changed our way of thinking_about society in the last 25 years or so. &quot; Habermas ' theory , she explains , calls into question a belief that is widely held by cynical and fashionable thinkers on the right and the left : the belief that human behavior should be seen as a battlefield upon which each of us is merely out for our own strategic interests . In our &quot; communicative actions , &quot; the right sees selfish individuals struggling to get a leg up_on each other ; the postmodern left sees the powerful exploiting the powerless ; but Habermas sees , of all things , a kind of cooperation . Indeed , he shares with Socrates an almost utopian belief in the wholesomeness of debate and discussion . His critics find this view a trifle rosy . Habermas persists , for example , in maintaining that &quot; in our everyday knowledge of how language is properly used we find a common_ground among all creatures with a human face. &quot; that ' s called &quot; humanism. &quot; that ' s called &quot; universalism. &quot; These are beliefs any self-respecting postmodernist rejected decades ago . Moreover , Habermas is convinced -- and this really gets the postmodernists calling_for the violins -- that through reasoned communication we humans can get beyond our biases . Habermas ' many acolytes share this faith . They have been pondering the glories of the impulse to communicate in philosophy and exploring the roots of that impulse in developmental_psychology . They have been refashioning political_theory and social theory -- to make room for more debate and discussion . And , fashionable or not , they have had considerable impact . &quot; Habermas is a world figure , maybe a planetary figure , in social theory , &quot; states sociologist Herbert J . Gans of Columbia University . Habermas ' formulations have even made their way into a debate about the U.S. Constitution . The question , as it always is , is should the Constitution referee in tag-team matches between hostile and competing interest_groups ? Or should this document , and the government it laid_out , serving as a facilitator , encourage chummy , reasonable citizens to exchange views and reach a consensus ? &quot; Habermas ' work has been of use for those of us who are trying to make_sense out of the latter view , &quot; says Frank Michelman , a professor at Harvard Law_School . Although Habermas bristled_at the presumption that he has had &quot; one great idea , &quot; the philosopher is willing , after some meditation , to admit to the existence of a &quot; thread &quot; that runs_through his work . This is it : &quot; I think that a certain form of unrestrained communication brings_to the fore the deepest force of reason , which enables us to overcome egocentric or ethnocentric perspectives and reach an expanded . . . view. &quot; This thread ties_in neatly with the values of the Enlightenment . Those of us who have been out of social studies class for a while may need to be reminded that the Enlightenment was a struggle , which began 200 years ago , in the name of reason , against tyranny , superstition and inequity . Voltaire and Thomas_Jefferson saw themselves as involved in that struggle . Habermas has contributed to it , too . The Enlightenment , you see , left open a crucial question : How does reason -- at whose behest so_much has been challenged -- justify itself ? Reason has undercut our belief in the spiritual , in the traditional . What is to prevent reason from challenging reason ? Why , in other words , should we believe_in reason ? In &quot; communicative action , &quot; Habermas thinks he has come_up with an answer . Reason , he maintains , is crucial to clear communication . So , to oversimplify a little , if we believe_in the importance of the universal human impulse to communicate , we have to believe_in reason . The Enlightenment , Habermas concludes , continues to have &quot; a sound core. &quot; * Those looking_for a 20th-Century movement in which to pigeonhole Habermas often settle upon &quot; modernism. &quot; His sympathy with the travails of reason and his fascination with the Enlightenment support that classification . So does his house . It stands , rectangular and devoid_of decorative flourishes , on a narrow , sharply sloping lot in Starnberg , a small lakeside town outside Munich . Habermas left Frankfurt for Starnberg in 1971 to become co-director of the Max Planck Institute for Research Into Conditions of Living_in a Scientific and Technological World . He and his wife , Ute , then built a spectacular , pure-white , Bauhaus-style house , filled with books and light . They were inspired by the great Viennese architect Albert Loos -- the quintessential modernist . Habermas returned to the University of Frankfurt 12 years later , but between academic sessions , he and Ute , with whom he has reared three children , continue to spend most of their time in Starnberg . &quot; There ' s no great reason for them to return there , &quot; suggests one colleague . &quot; I think they stay there because of that house. &quot; Of course , philosophical fashions , like architectural fashions , have changed in the last decades of this century . The Enlightenment , many contemporary scholars maintain , is over , modernism finished . &quot; Habermas is the leading defender of Enlightenment universalism , &quot; comments Rorty , probably the best-known American philosopher . &quot; I find his attempt very impressive . He does_it in a way nobody had thought of doing before , but I still don ' t believe it. &quot; In the postmodern age , of course , humans aren ' t seen as having universal impulses or sharing a common_ground . Postmodernists have no use for such generalizations . Human attitudes , they insist , vary as much as human cultures do . Japanese see things differently than Swedes . Metallica lovers probably see things differently than those who fancy Counting Crows . The world , postmodernists maintain , is_full of egocentric and ethnocentric biases , full of complexities . Attempts to squeeze it into smooth , rectangular packages -- in philosophy or in architecture -- are futile and foolish . In the postmodern age , those who create buildings , clothing , novels and world_views are encouraged to throw_in a little of this and a little of that -- without pretending that this or that , one perspective or another , is somehow correct . Reason is the tool we use to divine what is correct and construct those out-of-favor generalizations , so in the postmodern age it is particularly suspect . The late French philosopher Michel Foucault derided reason as just another instrument of oppression , just another weapon on the battlefield . Another French philosopher , Jean-Francois Lyotard , who teaches at UC Irvine , has argued that the &quot; triumph of reason , &quot; which we tend to credit for science or democracy or MacNeil-Lehrer , is merely a &quot; narrative &quot; we tell ourselves -- a bedtime story for those of us who haven ' t outgrown the belief in_progress . &quot; At the finish of this century , &quot; contends Lyotard , author of the book &quot; The Postmodern Condition , &quot; &quot; after the enormous massacres we have experienced , no one can any longer believe_in progress , in consensus , in transcendent values . Habermas presupposes such a belief. &quot; Stanley Fish , a professor of English and law at Duke University , has been particularly critical of Habermas ' work . Fish scoffs at the notion that we might talk our way past our biases . In order to enter into a conversation in which you might lose your prejudices , he argues , you ' d have to begin by putting aside your prejudices . &quot; The trouble with Habermas ' way of thinking , &quot; Fish asserts , &quot; is that you couldn ' t possibly take this first_step . This first_step is in fact the last step . &quot; I have always been mystified by the attention that Habermas receives , &quot; Fish says . &quot; His way of thinking_about these matters seems to me to be obviously faulty . The only way I can explain it to myself is that Habermas represents something that a lot of people would like to buy_into : He seems to offer a way_out of corrosive relativism. &quot; If Habermas ' thoughts provide some resistance to the potentially &quot; corrosive &quot; belief that such standards as justice and reason are merely &quot; relative , &quot; his ideas do not come from some sort of stainless idealism . His beloved reason is not a magic sword that can instantly slice away all biases . It is , instead , a late-20th-Century reason ; that means he sees it as fallible , as merely the product of imperfect human discussion and debate . Habermas doesn ' t pretend that prejudices can be instantly removed or discarded . He does believe , despite what the postmodernists say , that reasoned communication can , over time , weaken them . So the battle_lines have been drawn . Habermas , says Martin Jay , a history professor at UC Berkeley , is &quot; a bulwark against some of the more problematic strains in postmodern thought. &quot; Habermas ' book &quot; The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity &quot; defends modernism against the prefix that presumes_to outdate it and criticizes various postmodern demigods -- including Foucault and Mr. Deconstruction , Jacques Derrida . Rather than going beyond modernism , he argues , some of them have just wandered off on some of its more &quot; negative &quot; and &quot; empty &quot; byways . Tough criticism . Before Foucault died , he and Habermas had established a friendship and a dialogue . Habermas had thought he was_on his way to building a similar relationship with Derrida . Then he sent him a copy of this book . Habermas received a polite thank-you note and then never heard from Derrida again . Habermas ' unfashionable beliefs , particularly his attachment to reason , probably can be traced to a deep awareness -- where he comes from -- of the horrors of unreason . &quot; When you begin flirting_with irrationalism and nihilism , &quot; explains his friend Bernstein , &quot; for him it evokes horrible memories . It evokes the Hitler period. &quot; Habermas admits that there is a strong personal element in his thought . &quot; Philosophers live finally from their own intuitions , &quot; he suggests . &quot; And those intuitions are not acquired by reading philosophic texts . They are acquired in certain particular individual experiences while growing_up -- rather negative experiences of violation , indignation and Kra nkung . &quot; Habermas ' English is strong . He has taught at Berkeley , for example , and he is teaching at Northwestern University in Chicago this fall . However , Habermas can ' t think_of an English translation for this German word . What early experiences might have shaped the philosophy of this man , who grew_up sensitive , brainy and with a slight impediment in Nazi Germany ? &quot; I would n ' t like to talk_about my own intuitions , &quot; Habermas says . &quot; I don ' t like to talk_about that. &quot; Krankung , a dictionary later reveals , means &quot; insult , &quot; &quot; outrage &quot; or &quot; mortification. &quot; * Anselm Haverkamp recalls having spent the whole day with Habermas at a conference in Germany . &quot; It was a typical European conference , &quot; the New York University professor says . &quot; It began at 9 in the morning and went_on for eight or 10 hours. &quot; Then there was more talking_over dinner . At 2 a.m. Haverkamp , exhausted but jet-lagged and unable to sleep , went downstairs . &quot; And there was Habermas , still talking to a_couple_of people at the hotel bar . He grabbed my arm and would n ' t let me pass , and for yet another two hours we continued to discuss difficult problems in political philosophy. &quot; Habermas , in other words , not only believes_in reasoned communication , he practices it -- eagerly . Not on every subject , of course . Pockets of reticence certainly remain . ( Habermas has admitted that he failed to confront his father about his behavior during the Nazi years. ) But , for the most part , he throws himself into debate and discussion with passion . &quot; Habermas is someone who really has to be pulled_out of a restaurant at midnight , &quot; says Gertrud Koch , a German scholar and film critic who has spent many evenings with him and a group of professors and students at a Greek restaurant in Frankfurt . And the later the hour grows , &quot; the more the discussion turns_to politics , and the more lively it gets , &quot; reports Hauke Brunkhorst , a philosophy professor who has participated in these sessions . Even the waiters and the restaurant ' s owner sometimes join in . &quot; It ' s true , &quot; Habermas admits , &quot; I love it. &quot; His wife , he says , often has to remind him that he is teaching the next morning and not to stay too late . When the discussion does turn_to politics , Brunkhorst explains , Habermas stands , &quot; in American terms , somewhere between a radical and a liberal. &quot; He votes mostly for Germany ' s Social Democrats and is sympathetic to the Greens , the environmental party . He supports , what he calls without flinching , the &quot; welfare_state , &quot; which has come under renewed attack in Germany and elsewhere in Western Europe . The key_word in Habermas ' political vocabulary , however , is democracy . He often has_in_mind a more &quot; radical democracy &quot; than that with which most Americans are familiar . &quot; In the phrase ' government by and for the people , ' Habermas places much more emphasis on the ' by ' than most of us normally would , &quot; McCarthy explains . He wants less unthinking nationalism and more reasoned communication on public issues . He wants more participation by citizens in government processes , in political_parties , in economic decisions -- a larger &quot; public sphere &quot; than can be found in any existing society . He wants more debate and discussion . This prescription , too , sounds naive to many allies of the postmodernist camp . &quot; It ' s the liberal answer to everything , &quot; asserts Fish . &quot; Let ' s talk it to death . Habermas preaches the theology of talk -- the elevation of philosophy_department seminars to a mode of public life. &quot; Conservatives find Habermas ' political ideas disturbing for different reasons . &quot; His work is stimulating , intellectually challenging , &quot; concedes Wolfgang Pordzik , director of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Washington , D.C. , which is close to Germany ' s Christian Democratic Party . &quot; But Habermas is just dead wrong in terms of his political recipe. &quot; In the eyes of most of those on the other side of the political spectrum , that &quot; recipe &quot; includes too_much &quot; public &quot; -- which they read as &quot; state &quot; -- interference in economic matters . It places too_much emphasis on cooperation , not enough on old-fashioned , reliable competition . Nevertheless , Habermas ' strategies for increasing the scope and power of the &quot; public sphere &quot; have had a significant impact . Indeed , they were important to those who were fighting state communism in Eastern Europe before 1989 . &quot; In Eastern Europe , the Communists had crushed all public spaces , &quot; notes Jean L . Cohen , a political_science professor at Columbia University . Habermas demonstrated how important forums for public discussion outside of government were , and his theories helped dissidents imagine how these forums might be used -- as the Solidarity labor_movement was used -- to oppose the government . Adam Michnik , one of the leaders of Solidarity in Poland , had studied Habermas ' work while in jail . A large_number of Hungarian dissidents were also familiar_with it . &quot; Habermas ' book ' The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere ' played an extremely important political role in Hungary , &quot; explains Anna Wessely , a professor of sociology at the Eotvos University in Budapest . &quot; It helped to conceptualize the role of the society against the state. &quot; In at least one Eastern European_country , Habermas ' impact is spoken_of in the present_tense . Ivan Vejvoda is one of several members of the Belgrade Circle , a group of anti-war Serbian intellectuals , who say they have been influenced by Habermas ' work . &quot; One of the main concerns of the Belgrade Circle , &quot; Vejvoda says , &quot; is to try to broaden the scope of free speech , to create a public space out of which we can create the foundation of a democratic culture . Habermas ' ideas are absolutely not only useful but important in this process. &quot; * Opposite the bookcases in the living room of Habermas ' modern house is a wall of windows . It faces west , which is fitting . Over the years , Habermas has had one overriding political interest : not Eastern Europe , despite all_the attention his work has received there , but the Federal_Republic_of_Germany . And , over the years , Habermas has given himself to one overriding cause : keeping the Federal Republic oriented toward Enlightenment values , values that have been most at_home in the West . It is not clear to him that the fall of the Berlin Wall , glorious as it was , has helped that cause . Though Habermas is obviously happy for the former East_Germans , the new , reunited Germany makes him nervous . &quot; From the first minute , I argued that we should stress republican premises for reunification , not nationalistic premises , &quot; he notes . As Bernstein points_out , &quot; Any smell of Germany having a special destiny almost viscerally upsets him. &quot; Habermas wanted the East_Germans to have more time to discuss their own future . Now he worries about the resentment against immigrants that has been released by the dislocations of reunification . He worries , too , that this larger , potentially more powerful Germany will stray from the confines of the European Union , form separate relationships with its former communist neighbors and assume , once again , the role of leader of Central Europe . He worries , in other words , that the country in which he lives , which so conspicuously lacks a long tradition of constitutionalism , might now turn_away from the West . Indeed , Habermas has worried so_much , so publicly , that he has been attacked -- unfairly he says -- as a foe of reunification . The winds shifted in Europe just when Habermas felt that his great cause was going well . &quot; For almost 40 years , &quot; he explains , &quot; I struggled against what I thought was the dangerous tendency toward . . . continuations of those anti-Western traditions that prepared the German population for a rather strong support of the Nazis after 1933. &quot; But this nightmare did not come true . In the Federal Republic , Enlightenment values seem to have , for the most part , won out . ( Habermas believes these values are in some ways now more at_home in Germany than in France or America , whose phalanxes of postmodernists delight in deconstructing them. ) &quot; During the postwar period , particularly since the late ' 60s , the Federal Republic got more and more politically civilized , &quot; Habermas observes . &quot; And now I ' m defending a continuation of this process rather than hailing the break of 1989. &quot; The Western democracies still have great social and political problems . The danger that the Germany of his childhood might return can never entirely be dismissed . Habermas , undoubtedly , will have no difficulty getting sufficiently agitated to write more newspaper_articles . However , an additional benefit of remembering the past is gaining perspective on the present . And from the living room of his modern house in the heart of Bavaria , which is flooded by light from the west , Habermas sees reason , if not having triumphed , at least having made great progress . &quot; Why stop ? &quot; he asks . &quot; Why not continue ? &quot;</TEXT>
