   <HEADLINE> PROBE LAUNCHED INTO NASDAQ STOCK TRADING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Justice_Department has opened an antitrust investigation of the Nasdaq stock_market , looking_into allegations of price-fixing and other illegal practices by dealers in the nation ' s busiest stock marketplace . &quot; The antitrust division is looking_at the possibility of anti-competitive practices in the over-the-counter stock_market , &quot; said Justice_Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona . Talamona declined to answer questions about the probe , but sources who have been contacted by government lawyers said the investigation is examining the fundamental stock-trading practices of Nasdaq . The sources said the investigation appears to be in a preliminary phase . If the antitrust division decides to go_forward with the case , it could bring either criminal price-fixing charges or civil antitrust charges . The electronically linked national market is home to the shares of such familiar companies as Microsoft Corp. , Intel Corp . and Apple Computer Inc. In the first six months of 1994 , its average daily trading volume surpassed the New York Stock_Exchange for the first time . Questions have been raised this year about whether Nasdaq trading may be rigged against small investors . The Justice_Department inquiry follows the May release of a study by two business_school professors who said they found evidence of at least tacit collusion to fix investors ' trading costs among many of the 510 Nasdaq market makers . Major market makers and the National Assn . of Securities Dealers , which owns and operates Nasdaq , have strongly denied the existence of collusion in the marketplace . In a written statement , T . Grant Callery , general counsel of the Washington-based NASD , said : &quot; Neither the NASD nor the Nasdaq stock_market has been contacted by the Justice_Department regarding any investigation . We will cooperate fully with any such investigation when and if we are contacted. &quot; Market makers are the dealers who , committing their own capital , stand ready to buy or sell specific Nasdaq stocks at publicly quoted prices . They include such well-known Wall_Street firms as Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . Inc. and Morgan Stanley Group Inc. and lesser-known firms that do little besides trade Nasdaq stocks , such_as Troster Singer Corp . and Herzog , Heine , Geduld Inc. Unlike the New York Stock_Exchange , where a single &quot; specialist &quot; firm is the sole market maker for each stock , each issue on Nasdaq ( the name originally stood_for National Assn . of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation system ) has multiple market makers who are expected to post competing prices for buying and selling shares . Since the business professors ' study was made public , at least 24 class-action lawsuits have been filed against major market makers on behalf of investors , nearly all alleging violations of antitrust_laws . Leonard B . Simon , a lawyer in San Diego with the firm of Milberg , Weiss , Bershad , Specthrie &amp; Lerach , which filed one of the cases , said a judicial panel consolidated most of them Monday , assigning the suits to U.S. District Judge Robert W . Sweet in Manhattan . The sources said the Justice_Department has formed a task_force of staff lawyers and economists to scrutinize Nasdaq , with participation by at least one regional antitrust division office as well as the department ' s headquarters in Washington . The lawyers have interviewed several market makers who are anxious to cooperate in the investigation . They also have spoken with officials of the federal Securities and Exchange Commission , the business_school professors who wrote the critical report and several of the lawyers who filed class-action suits . Members of the task_force have also spent time sitting on Nasdaq trading desks in recent weeks , the sources said . In their paper , to be published in December in the Journal of Finance , William G . Christie of Vanderbilt University and Paul H . Schulz of Ohio State University found that for many of the largest Nasdaq stocks , dealers seemed to always quote prices in a way that maintained at least a 1 / 4-point , or 25-cent &quot; spread. &quot; These spreads -- essentially the market makers ' profit_margin -- are the gap between the &quot; bid &quot; price ( the price at which a market maker is willing to buy a stock ) and the higher &quot; asked &quot; price ( at which the firm is willing to sell ) . On the New York Stock_Exchange , by contrast , spreads for most stocks are 1 / 8 of a point , or 12.5 cents , an NYSE spokeswoman said . The professors found that for 71 out of 100 of the largest Nasdaq stocks , market makers seemed never to quote prices in &quot; odd eighths &quot; of a point . In other words , bid or asked prices could be 20 , 20 1 / 4 , 20 1 / 2 or 20 3 / 4 , but never 20 1 / 8 , 20 3 / 8 , 20 5 / 8 or 20 7 / 8 -- even though such quotes are common for other stocks . The direct result was that spreads in these stocks were never less than 1 / 4 of a point . And the wider spreads end_up costing investors , in the aggregate , millions of dollars every year . Christie and Schulz concluded that the only possible explanation for the spreads was &quot; tacit collusion &quot; among market makers . Shortly after their report was made public , spreads for a_few of the stocks they cited -- including Apple , Microsoft and Thousand Oaks-based Amgen Inc. -- suddenly narrowed to 1 / 8 of a point . The sources said the Justice_Department inquiry has broadened beyond looking_at possible collusion on spreads to other alleged anti-competitive practices . These include allegations that market makers refuse to honor their posted prices and that the dealers systematically prevent customers from finding_out about offers from fellow investors to buy or sell at prices better than those available from the market makers themselves . Although not the first time the antitrust division has gotten involved in securities matters , the inquiry represents an unusual foray_into an area normally left to the SEC . Anne K . Bingaman , appointed by President Clinton to head the division , has led the unit into a series of new initiatives after a long period of relative dormancy . SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr . has been moving to impose some new restrictions on Nasdaq , aimed at getting better prices for individual investors . But John C . Coffee Jr. , a Columbia University professor specializing in securities law , said the Justice_Department is_better equipped than the SEC to deal with any broad problems that exist in the market ' s operations . &quot; This is not the kind of case that the SEC specializes in , &quot; he said of the allegations of collusion , adding that the antitrust division is &quot; much more used_to dealing with a whole pattern and practice by a very large industry. &quot; Officials of several large Nasdaq market-making firms -- including Morgan Stanley Inc. , Charles Schwab &amp; Co . ( which owns giant Nasdaq market maker Mayer &amp; Schweitzer Inc. ) , Troster Singer Corp . and others -- either declined to comment or said their firms were unaware of an investigation .</TEXT>
