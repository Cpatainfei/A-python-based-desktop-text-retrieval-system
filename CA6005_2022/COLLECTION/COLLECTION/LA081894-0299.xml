   <HEADLINE> YELTSIN VOWS AID IN PROBING NUCLEAR CONTRABAND CASES ; RUSSIA : THE PRESIDENT ' S PROMISE IN A LETTER TO GERMAN CHANCELLOR KOHL CONTRASTS WITH MOSCOW ' S DENIALS THAT IT IS THE SOURCE OF SMUGGLED PLUTONIUM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin has written to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl promising Moscow ' s cooperation in investigating recent cases of nuclear contraband seized in Germany , a Bonn spokesman said Wednesday . The letter was the first direct offer of help from the Russian government , which has publicly denied German assertions that Russia is the source of nuclear materials seized in Germany over the last four months . The two leaders are friends , and Kohl had written to Yeltsin last weekend . Bernd Schmidbauer , Kohl ' s minister overseeing intelligence services , is to fly to Moscow this weekend with the results of scientific examinations of the samples to discuss the smuggling issue . The European Atomic Energy Commission in Luxembourg said on Wednesday that at least two of the plutonium samples almost certainly originated_in Russia and that at least one of them came from a nuclear_weapons facility . Wilhelm Gmelin , director of the European Safeguards Directorate at the commission , said an analysis of six grams ( 0.2 ounce ) of plutonium found in the garage of a salesman in the southwestern state of Baden-Wurttemberg last May showed &quot; the chances are very high that it is from weapons material. &quot; Gmelin said the plutonium was mixed with a substance called gallium , &quot; which normally is not used in any civilian application. &quot; Adolf Jaeckle , the salesman , originally was arrested on suspicion of counterfeiting . German television ' s NDR network reported that police found the cards of two Russian scientists from Moscow ' s Kurchatov Institute in Jaeckle ' s apartment . Gmelin and the Bavarian state interior minister have said 10.7 ounces of plutonium-239 seized in Munich also apparently came from Russia and was produced for use in weapons . That cache was discovered in a suitcase on a Lufthansa flight from Moscow , and three passengers , two Spaniards and a Colombian , were arrested . The sample proved to be 87.2 % pure plutonium-239 -- which , Gmelin said , &quot; rules_out any civilian use in the European Community. &quot; But Gmelin warned that , even as experts narrow the origins of the plutonium samples , they do not necessarily know how or from which facilities they made their way onto the black_market . Plutonium is used in Russia for making nuclear_weapons . It is also a byproduct of atomic_energy production in plants that use enriched uranium . Russia has specialized industrial uses for plutonium , such_as smoke detectors and pacemakers , and does civilian as well as military research with the radioactive element . In an interview with the weekly newspaper Die Woche , a Russian official charged with cleaning_up the Chernobyl nuclear_power station after it exploded in 1986 warned that more nuclear material than suspected may already have been smuggled out of Russia . &quot; Nobody can control this atomic smuggling , &quot; Vladimir Chernosenko told Die Woche . &quot; This industrial sector was traditionally controlled by the KGB . . . . Now those structures have fallen_away and there is no more control. &quot; In Moscow , the government continued to publicly deny that any plutonium is missing from Russian facilities and to charge that Germans have political motivations for exaggerating the smuggling issue . On the Munich seizure -- the largest illegal plutonium cache ever discovered -- Yuri A . Rogzhin , spokesman for Russia ' s Federal Inspectorate of Nuclear and Radiation Security , said , &quot; I think that this action is purely political . &quot; The passengers were detained before they approached customs . This shows that the German special services knew about the cargo , &quot; he said . &quot; The fact that the Germans did not get_in_touch with us proves that they do not want to settle and investigate this incident. &quot; But Valery F . Davydov , an independent Russian non-proliferation specialist , said nuclear security is the most sensitive issue in Russia and that an independent assessment of the problem is unlikely . &quot; All specialists are tied to secret and semi-secret ministries and are afraid to say something that will not be in_line with official policy , &quot; Davydov said . Some political commentators in both countries have suggested that the German government is using the issue to bolster Kohl ' s reelection campaign and strengthen his bid for a German seat on the U.N. Security_Council . Kohl ' s envoy , Schmidbauer , briefed the multi-party Parliamentary Control Commission on the smuggling issue behind closed doors Wednesday morning . German television ' s ZDF network reported that he told the legislators &quot; of offers and buyers , the involvement of former KGB connections and at least in one case of official Russian authorities. &quot; In Washington , Energy_Secretary Hazel O ' Leary said scientists with the U.S. National Weapons Laboratories have largely concluded that seized materials they have examined are of such high_quality and grade that they could have come only from research facilities -- not from the former Soviet arsenal . Times staff writer Melissa Healy in Washington and Andrei Ostroukh of The Times ' Moscow Bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
