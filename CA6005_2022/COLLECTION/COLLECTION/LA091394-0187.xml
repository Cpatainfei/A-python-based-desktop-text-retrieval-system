   <HEADLINE> ETHNIC CONFLICT ; KRAJINA TRADES PENSIONS FOR PRIDE ; REBEL SERBS ARE OWED BY CROATIA . BUT THEY ' D RATHER GO WITHOUT THAN ACKNOWLEDGE ZAGREB .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stevan Sovilj ' s lined face and spare frame speak_to his need for the $ 700 monthly pension he is owed for 41 years of work_on the abandoned Zagreb-Split rail_line , which passes_through this rebel Serb stronghold . He pulls_at the loose waistband of his snagged trousers to show that he has lost_weight on the $ 40 he and his family are forced to live_on each month amid the hardships of a prolonged rebellion and the haywire prices inflicted by war in the Balkans . Yet at the mere suggestion that his retirement income could be arriving regularly if Serbs in the disputed Krajina region made_peace with the Croatian government in Zagreb , the mild-mannered engineer erupts in a defiant , nationalist tirade . &quot; Serbs will never be part of Croatia . We cannot live there . We don ' t have any money , but we have our own country . It is my right to choose , and I choose to stay here and refuse their money , &quot; the silver-haired pensioner declares with ferocity . If any residents of this self-styled capital of the rogue Republic of Serbian Krajina can contemplate being governed as part of Croatia , they are keeping those thoughts to themselves . At the public market , on park_benches crowded with homeless refugees , in the dusty sidewalk cafes where the legions of unemployed idle away the daylight , Krajina Serbs insist they are determined to preserve their independence at any cost . Rather than being worn down by four years of oscillating battle and tension , they seem prepared to wait out the world ' s resistance to their claimed statehood and endure any suffering necessary during the standoff in this corner of the wars that have swept the former Yugoslav federation . Even the allure of pensions owed by the Zagreb government to 60 # 000 Serbs living_in the occupied Krajina region seems unable to sway the rebels to contemplate a compromise and peace . As recently as four years ago , all residents of today ' s Krajina were Yugoslav nationals who accrued pensions payable by the government of their republic within the Yugoslav federation , in this case Croatia . So retirees here in Knin should be collecting their monthly checks from Zagreb . But with their insistence that Croatia is a foreign country with no political relationship to occupied Krajina , the Serbs of this impoverished and isolated region have effectively renounced their claims to be beneficiaries of Croatia . Idealists like Zora Zelic , who worked 23 years as a hotel maid in the coastal resorts of Croatia , insist that Zagreb should pay the pensions to Krajina Serbs anyway , noting that retirees who move abroad in most democratic countries continue to receive the pensions they earned during their working years . In the case of Krajina , however , it wasn ' t the pensioners who moved , but the country . Croatia seceded from Serb-dominated Yugoslavia in June , 1991 , prompting the Krajina Serbs to grab a third of the Croatian republic ' s territory in a bid to form their own state . With all mail service , telephone communication , financial ties and transport severed by the rebels four years ago , Zagreb would be hard-pressed to pay the Krajina residents even if it wanted to . Authorities have told Western mediators that they would gladly resume paying the retired people of Krajina if the rebels would restore the banking , postal and political links with Croatia necessary to transact the payments . But implicit_in the integration of economic and social institutions would be acknowledgment that they are citizens of Croatia . And virtually no one here seems swayed by the offer of a paycheck to give_up the claim to independence . Pensions are one of seven economic cooperation themes that international mediators hope will entice Serbs and Croats in troubled Croatia to come_together for the mutual benefit of their war-weary populations . U.S. and Russian diplomats overseeing reconciliation talks had hoped the promise of a step-by-step return to normalcy would make both sides see reason . Other proposals that should be advantageous to both sides include reopening the blocked highway between Zagreb and Belgrade , capital of the Serbian-run rump Yugoslavia ; restoring the prewar utility networks now severed by the front_line ; repairing and sharing the proceeds of the Adriatic oil_pipeline that passes_through both territories , and allowing free movement on_the_roads and railways that once traversed the region , like the popular rail_line that Sovilj spent his career helping to administer . Yet even the most elementary moves toward cooperation have been rejected by both sides as they posture in negotiations and threaten another round of war . Croatian President Franjo Tudjman warned in a recent interview that he saw increasing signs &quot; the military option &quot; would be required to recover Krajina -- a euphemism for a bloody , all-out assault to conquer the heavily armed rebels . Milan Martic , the former police_officer whom Krajina Serbs elected as president in internationally unrecognized balloting in January , has also indicated to mediators that his people are prepared to resume combat rather than give_up their internationally spurned claim of statehood . The standoff has been destructive for both sides , with Croatia losing millions in unrealized tourist revenue from its empty Adriatic_Sea resorts and Krajina cut_off from the raw_materials and trade links needed to resuscitate its idled industries . &quot; It doesn ' t make any sense for either side to brandish the war sword when there are very real opportunities for cooperation , &quot; said a senior Western diplomat involved in the negotiations . &quot; One can only hope that the politicians will sooner or later act in the interest of their people instead of only for their own political power. &quot; But it is exactly that quest_for influence over a captive fiefdom that drove the Balkan states to war in the first place , with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic asserting Serbian domination over Albanians in the provinces of Kosovo , and Tudjman following_suit by trying to relegate Serbs in Croatia to a second-class status , which along with prodding from Milosevic encouraged them to rebel . Because both Tudjman and Milosevic have achieved their main political goals of , respectively , gaining international recognition for Croatia and seizing land for a Greater Serbia , neither leader is expected to seriously challenge the status_quo . Despite the logic of reconciliation and the financial boost it would provide both peoples , it remains a dim prospect amid the hostilities and political gamesmanship rampant in Croatia . And issues like pensions , unhindered travel and income from transporting oil have been made hostages of a political settlement few observers see any chance of emerging in this century . Balkan Breakdown After the collapse of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia , which began in 1991 , it broke_up into five independent republics -- Bosnia-Herzegovina , Croatia , Macedonia , Slovenia and the rump Yugoslavia , which consists_of Serbia and Montenegro . Each possesses a variety of ethnic concentrations . The breakdowns : Bosnia-Herzegovina Population : 4.6 million 44 % Muslim , 31 % Serbian , 17 % Croatian , 8 % other . Croatia Population : 4.7 million 78 % Croatian , 12 % Serbian , 10 % other . Macedonia Population : 2.2 million 67 % Macedonian , 21 % Albanian , 4 % Turkish , 2 % Serbian , 6 % other . Serbia and Montenegro Population : 10.7 million 63 % Serbian , 14 % Albanian , 6 % Montenegrin , 4 % Hungarian , 13 % other . Slovenia Population : 2 million 91 % Slovene , 3 % Croatian , 2 % Serbian , 4 % other . Source : World Fact Book , 1993 Compiled by Times Research Librarian Paul J .
