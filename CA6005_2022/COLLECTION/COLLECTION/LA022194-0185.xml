   <HEADLINE> MCDONALD ' S FINDING SUCCESS IN MIDEAST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> McDonald ' s Corp . says it is surpassing expectations in its bid to export its fast-food restaurants to the Middle_East . James Skinner , senior_vice_president in_charge of Middle_East development , declined to disclose sales figures or say how long after its opening a Middle_East restaurant begins to turn a profit . That McDonald ' s is doing_well there is no surprise to analysts familiar_with the company ' s success exporting its finely tuned fast-food delivery system to countries as diverse as Russia , Thailand and China . &quot; I can ' t think_of a single market where they haven ' t done a bang-up job , &quot; said Allan Hickok , an analyst with Piper Jaffray Inc. in Minneapolis . &quot; I ultimately think they will end_up colonizing the world with the Big Mac. &quot; Since opening its first restaurant in Tel Aviv last fall , the Oak Brook , Ill.-based fast-food giant has opened others in the Saudia Arabian cities of Riyadh and Jeddah . The company plans to open a second outlet in Tel Aviv this week and a restaurant in Oman in March . Restaurants are scheduled for Kuwait in June and Bahrain , United Arab Emirates and Egypt in November . One in Qatar is expected after that . In all , McDonald ' s expects to have 25 restaurants in the region by the end of 1994 , Skinner said . Worldwide , the company had nearly 14 # 000 restaurants at the end of 1993 . Of those , 4 # 710 were outside the United States . Skinner said its Middle_East expansion represents the first new foreign market McDonald ' s has entered in several years . And in a departure from previous practice , McDonald ' s is making a concentrated effort , opening outlets in eight countries in about 14 months . Some observers might question the wisdom of bringing a high-profile American icon such_as the golden arches into an area where the United States is sometimes called the &quot; Great Satan. &quot; However , industry_analysts say people in the Middle_East distinguish between American culture and its political dealings . &quot; They might not want anything to do with America or Bill_Clinton , &quot; Hickok said . &quot; But don ' t confuse that with a burger , fries and a Coke. &quot; that ' s not to say McDonald ' s doesn ' t have to modify its methods . Skinner said the restaurants in Saudia Arabia close four times a day for 30 to 40 minutes to accommodate Muslim prayer traditions . The Jeddah restaurant is about 7 # 000 square_feet -- considerably larger than typical U.S. stores that range from 2 # 000 to 3 # 500 square_feet , Skinner said .</TEXT>
