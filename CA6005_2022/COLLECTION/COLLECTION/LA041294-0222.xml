   <HEADLINE> PRESCRIPTION FOR SURVIVAL ; PHYSICIANS FORM GROUPS , ALIGN WITH HMOS IN NEW ENVIRONMENT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the fast-changing health-care business , many worried physicians in the region are banding_together and forming medical groups in the hope that being bigger will help them attract more patients . The mergers reflect an effort by physicians to tap into the surging number of patients who have signed_up with health-maintenance organizations , which contract with a select list of hospitals and doctors . HMOs typically don ' t contract with sole practitioners or physicians in small practices . So by combining practices , doctors believe size and geographical reach will give them clout to win more HMO contracts and get better rates from health insurers and hospitals . Although many physicians don ' t want to join big groups , health-care reform is expected to keep pushing managed-care plans like HMOs . That will continue to erode the number of traditional patients who can choose any doctor , which will make_it extremely tough for small physician practices to survive . Stewart Brooks , 49 , a Simi Valley pediatrician , figures he lost about 20 % of his patients in recent years because employers pushed many of them to join HMOs . After 18 years of working with only one partner , Brooks last May lumped his practice with four small physician groups in Simi Valley and formed_Family Health_Care Medical Group Inc. That group is now a corporation with 25 salaried doctors , annual revenue of about $ 14 million and 120 employees , including a chief_executive who negotiates contracts with HMOs and oversees the financial management of the corporation . &quot; To practice in the 1990s , you have to be willing to adapt , &quot; said Brooks , who is now seeing many of his former patients because they have signed_up with Family Health_Care through an HMO . Overall , Family Health_Care now has contracts with a dozen HMOs to see patients . Since joining the medical group , Brooks is working harder , seeing more patients and his income is about 10 % higher than a year ago . &quot; I ' m happy with the group , &quot; he said . Most medical groups in the San Fernando Valley area and Ventura County are still relatively small , with fewer than 50 doctors each . The biggest medical group in the area is one related to Kaiser Permanente , the state ' s biggest HMO . Kaiser has more_than 300 # 000 members , or patients , in the San Fernando , Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys , and they are seen almost exclusively by 535 doctors through the Southern California Permanente Medical Group . The other HMOs in the area do business with various medical groups , including several larger ones : Greater Valley Medical Group in Northridge with 30 doctors ; Community Medical Group of the West Valley with 36 doctors , and Facey Medical Group in the Valley with about 65 doctors . Size is critical because under managed care , HMOs in the area typically pay a medical group between $ 35 and $ 40 a month per patient no matter how often that patient comes_in_for treatment . Because no one knows exactly how many HMO members will make office visits , the larger the patient base , the more effectively a medical group can spread its risk . Greater Valley Medical Group in Northridge will get bigger this month when it merges with Simi Hills Family Medicine Group , a five-doctor practice in Simi Valley . Greater Valley approached Simi Hills last fall , wanting to expand in that area and drawn by Simi Hills ' 10 # 000 HMO patients . Alberto Odio , a family physician with Simi Hills , said his group was doing fine financially but decided to join Greater Valley Medical because Simi Hills didn ' t want to be forced into a merger later with a big group it didn ' t like . Odio said that the Simi Hills group will still maintain some independence , including being able to refer patients to specialists without having to go_through Greater Valley Medical ' s review procedure . The merger will also give Greater Valley Medical more_than 55 # 000 patients , most of them HMO members . Still , the group says it needs to get bigger and so is considering forging other alliances . &quot; There hasn ' t been anybody who hasn ' t knocked_on someone else ' s door , &quot; said Gail DellaVedova , Greater Valley Medical ' s administrator . &quot; What we ' re going through right now is a lot of churning , &quot; said John Edelston , a health-care analyst in Woodland Hills . Edelston predicted that in a_few years there would be just a_few major medical groups , with those that provide high-quality care to a large_number of people in the most cost-effective manner having_the_best chance of surviving . John McDonald , chief_executive of the huge Mullikin Medical Group based in Artesia , which also operates in the Valley , says a doctors ' group needs to have at least 75 # 000 HMO patients to be viable . And the bigger the medical group , he said , the more potential for savings by combining back-office work such_as record-keeping and billing . Mullikin , with annual revenue of $ 340 million , entered the Valley in 1992 , when it merged with Burbank Medical Clinic and Hawthorne Community Medical Group . Today , Mullikin has a half-dozen offices and 40 # 000 patients in the Valley . &quot; We certainly hope to expand and add other members , &quot; McDonald said . Big medical groups such_as Mullikin worry hospitals and health insurers , which have also been consolidating to battle in the new managed-care arena . As the number of medical groups shrinks while those that remain keep getting bigger , HMOs see themselves having less clout when it comes_to dividing up the HMO premium dollar , which roughly is split between HMOs , hospitals and doctors . CaliforniaCare , an HMO owned by Blue Cross of California and based in Woodland Hills , recently said it would no longer automatically accept a newly merged or acquired medical group into an existing contract . &quot; These mergers have resulted in giving a lot of leverage to these ( physician ) organizations , &quot; said Ferial Bahremand , CaliforniaCare ' s director of provider services . Bahremand said it ' s not clear if these mergers have reduced costs because of the extra layer of administrators that medical groups create . And in some cases , she said , there have been longer waits and more complaints about billing errors from HMO patients whose doctors belong_to bigger medical groups . CaliforniaCare currently contracts with about 30 medical groups in the Valley area and has no exclusive contracts . But health insurers are expected to seek leverage by contracting with a much smaller number of hospitals and medical groups in the future . Also , insurance_companies such_as Unihealth America of Burbank and some hospitals , including Glendale Adventist , through related foundations , have recently acquired medical groups to have better control of doctors ' practices . Other HMOs are contemplating purchases of medical groups . &quot; I would n ' t rule that out , &quot; said Sam Ho , medical director of Woodland Hills-based Health Net , the state ' s second-largest HMO . Though tensions between HMOs and medical groups are rising , some have very close relationships . Community Medical Group of the West Valley was founded in 1979 at the urging of Blue Cross of California , which wanted to enlist doctors to see its new Health Net patients . Community Medical started with nine doctors who saw only 500 HMO members , or 1 % of the group ' s practice . &quot; It was just an experiment in a new paying method , &quot; said pediatrician Marvin Kanter , one of Community Medical ' s founders and the group ' s chairman and chief_executive . But over the years , Community Medical ' s HMO clients outgrew its conventional patients as the group signed contracts with FHP , CareAmerica , PacifiCare and many other health plans . Today , Community Medical has 36 salaried doctors in a dozen offices in the Valley . Their HMO patients number 43 # 000 . Kanter , 56 , says he sees more physicians signing_up with medical groups , especially younger doctors such_as Robert Hanson , an internist who joined Community Medical in 1990 soon after getting_out of medical_school . Hanson , 36 , works about 40 hours a week and is_on call only one night a week plus every fifth weekend , allowing him ample time to spend with his wife and 4-year-old son . &quot; It was an easy decision , &quot; Hanson said . But many doctors are wary of medical groups and managed care , and past mergers suggest that future combinations of physician practices will be anything but easy . Before the five physician groups in Simi Valley could merge and form_Family Health_Care Medical Group , the 25 doctors met for four hours a week for a year with Jim Agronick , a health-care administrator they hired to merge the various groups together . Together , they had to wrestle with legal matters and set_up both a corporation and a partnership . They had to negotiate how much ownership each doctor would get -- in the end 20 physicians became equal owners . And they had to decide on salaries for each doctor , which varied depending_on their group ' s valuation of a doctor ' s existing practice . &quot; We had a certain amount of tension in some of the meetings , &quot; said Agronick , 34 , who had previously worked for five years as a vice_president at CareAmerica , the Chatsworth-based HMO . &quot; At any point , the whole_thing could have unraveled. &quot; Agronick , who is now the group ' s chief_executive , said the medical group had a small loss last year and is still working_out the problems of combining multiple record systems and staffs . But since the merger , Agronick said , the group has picked_up 12 # 000 new HMO customers . Still , &quot; we ' re not secure at all , &quot; he said . In fact , the next step for his Family Health_Care Medical Group is to think even bigger . &quot; Ultimately , we ' re going to be part of a larger network. &quot;</TEXT>
