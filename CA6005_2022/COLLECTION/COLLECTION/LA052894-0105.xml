   <HEADLINE> CHARGES FLY IN RANCOROUS JUDICIAL CONTEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A rancorous campaign for Downey Municipal Court judge has swerved from the genial path most judicial elections follow because one candidate is digging_into his opponent ' s past , clamoring about an attempted payoff not to run and trying to spark a debate over family values . The contest pits Roy L . Paul , a veteran civic_leader , against Benjamin R . Margolis , a political newcomer who has shown he is not afraid to cast stones . Paul , a court commissioner and former Bell Gardens City_Council member , accuses his opponent of probing into his personal life and spreading tales about him having multiple girlfriends . Margolis , a pharmacist and part-time attorney , concedes only that his campaign workers questioned Paul ' s ex-girlfriend and insists that he is the victim of underhanded tactics , including an attempted payoff to bow_out of the race . Margolis ' attacks have dismayed political observers accustomed to more dignified judicial races , including the retiring judge whom Margolis and Paul hope to replace . &quot; Very seldom are there attacks like this , &quot; said Judge Richard C . Cumming , who supports Paul . &quot; Judicial races tend to be of higher elevation. &quot; The winner of the June 7 election will represent the judicial district serving Downey , Norwalk and La Mirada , and will preside , for the most part , over minor civil cases and misdemeanor prosecutions for drug violations and petty thefts . It is one of the lower rungs in the judicial order , but the job does carry prestige , a $ 90 # 680 annual salary and a six-year term . * Margolis and Paul both promise to be tough on drunk drivers , drug offenders and other troublemakers who enter their courtrooms . They have spent more_than $ 65 # 000 apiece on flyers , cable_television commercials , newspaper_advertisements and political consultants to get their messages across . Margolis , 49 , is a self-proclaimed political outsider who says he refuses to accept political contributions , including an alleged $ 10 # 000 donation to bow_out of the race and pursue another office . Margolis said the offer came during a recent fund-raiser for a local hospital , but he cannot substantiate the allegation . A 25-year resident of Pacific Palisades , he became the chief pharmacist at Rancho Los Amigos Medical_Center in Downey in October . He also operates a part-time law_practice out of his home . Paul , 44 , campaigns hard on local ties . His mother was the first mayor of Bell Gardens in 1961 , and he took_over her law_practice when she died in 1978 . Paul served on the Bell Gardens City_Council from 1980 to 1984 , and on the Downey City_Council from 1986 to 1991 . He resigned from the council when he was appointed to the commissioner ' s post in Downey Municipal Court , where he tries accused traffic scofflaws and the_like . Paul questioned his opponent ' s qualifications because Margolis is a full-time pharmacist and lives outside the area . Margolis points_out that judges do not have to live where they serve . He suggests that his family values are superior to those of Paul , who has no children and whose 18-month marriage was annulled in 1974 . In a campaign flyer , Margolis describes himself as a married_man of 22 years with an 11-year-old son . Concerning Paul ' s family values , the flyer offers no specific details but advises : &quot; You be the judge ! &quot; &quot; If you have a family , you have stability ; you ' re not going_to do something erratic , &quot; Margolis said in an interview . * Although Margolis said he has no interest in Paul ' s personal life , he admitted that his campaign workers approached Gracie Gonzalez , Paul ' s ex-girlfriend . Gonzalez , a personal trainer who competes in national fitness competitions , said she was called once by Ruth Merchey , Margolis ' campaign manager , and four times by campaign volunteer Lucille Saunders . Gonzalez said that they &quot; wanted dirty laundry &quot; and that Saunders alluded to a reward . &quot; She said it would be worth my time , &quot; Gonzalez said . &quot; I said , ' I don ' t have anything negative to say. ' &quot; In separate interviews , Saunders and Merchey denied offering Gonzalez money . &quot; The word was that she had something on him , &quot; Saunders said . &quot; We wanted to get as much information as we could. &quot; Margolis said he only wanted to find_out whether Paul had ever misused city funds as a city councilman . Paul said the Margolis campaign &quot; is trying to use the fact that I ' m single as a weapon and insinuating that something is wrong. &quot; In a debate Thursday , Paul complained that Margolis supporters were taking pictures of people entering his house . The existence of one such picture has been confirmed . It reportedly shows a woman entering Paul ' s house with a key . The photo was taken by Paul ' s neighbor , a Margolis supporter . Merchey , Margolis ' campaign manager , says the woman in the photograph is someone Paul continues to see even while involved in another relationship . Paul identifies the woman as his housekeeper . Margolis also has publicly suggested that Paul &quot; might be guilty of a misdemeanor &quot; because he continues to advertise his law_practice in the phone_book even though he is a court commissioner . Paul said that his law_practice is defunct and that the purpose of the advertisement is to direct former clients to a new attorney who now holds their wills and other documents . The ad is legal , Paul said , because the new attorney pays_for it . The series of scuffles has thrust the campaign into the local spotlight . &quot; There ' s more lawn signs and heat about it than about the City_Council campaign , &quot; said Downey Councilwoman Joyce L . Lawrence .</TEXT>
