   <HEADLINE> RABIN ACCUSES ISRAELI RIGHTISTS OF SCARE TACTICS ; MIDEAST : PROTESTS AGAINST ARAFAT ' S RETURN CONTINUE IN JERUSALEM . PRIME_MINISTER CALLS CLAIMS HE WILL TURN CITY OVER TO PALESTINIANS AN ' OUTRAGE. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As hundreds of angry Jews clashed with police outside his office Sunday , Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin defended the Mideast peace accord and accused his opponents of inciting violence with scare stories of a Palestinian-controlled Jerusalem . &quot; I ' ll put it simply : It ' s a political outrage , &quot; Rabin told a caucus meeting of his Labor_Party . &quot; There is no disagreement regarding the unity of Jerusalem , our sovereignty over it or its continuation as the capital of Israel. &quot; Rabin ' s remarks were part of a government counteroffensive against rightist leaders who oppose the peace agreement and have used Friday ' s return of Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat , after 27 years in exile , to rally tens of thousands to their cause . Only hours before , one of the biggest anti-government rallies in Jerusalem ' s modern history had turned ugly as thousands of Jews took_to the streets late Saturday , some throwing rocks at Arab-owned shops , burning cars and defying riot police . Then , on Sunday , hundreds of shouting , flag-waving demonstrators gathered outside Rabin ' s office_building in an attempt to prevent government_ministers from attending the regular weekly Cabinet meeting . The government assigned bodyguards to the ministers , who entered and left the building by a side_entrance . The protesters taunted riot police from a makeshift &quot; tent city , &quot; which government opponents set_up opposite Rabin ' s office a month ago . Some blew whistles and banged cooking pans , hoping to be heard inside the Cabinet meeting . Police said 65 demonstrators were arrested and four were slightly injured . No charges were filed , and most of the protesters were later released , with some rejoining the protest . In their Cabinet meeting , Rabin and his ministers lashed_out at the protesters and right-wing leaders , accusing them of inciting violence with allegations that the government plans to turn Jerusalem over to the Palestinians . Rabin said the protests Saturday and Sunday , and the property damage that resulted , had &quot; gone beyond the bounds of legitimate political dissent. &quot; Some government_ministers accused the right_wing of trying to spark a &quot; Jewish intifada , &quot; a reference_to the militant Palestinian uprising that began in December , 1987 , and brought the Israeli government into negotiations on Palestinian self-government for the Gaza Strip and the West_Bank town of Jericho . &quot; It ' s a rebellion , &quot; said Shulamit Aloni , the communications minister . She added that the demonstrators &quot; are presenting a legitimate government as traitors. &quot; But the government received some good news Sunday from an opinion poll by the Begin-Sadat Center for Strategic Studies at Bar Ilan University . The poll indicated that 60 % of Israelis support continued dialogue with the PLO . More_than half , however , still say they do not believe that agreements with the Palestinians or the Syrians will solve the Arab-Israeli conflict . Ephraim Inbar , director of the center , said the results indicate the number of Israelis willing to make a deal for Palestinian autonomy in exchange for peace is growing . &quot; The Israeli public is exhausted by the conflict , and by the lack of an opposition which presents a clear alternative , &quot; he said . In fact , there is no consensus on an alternative solution to Israel ' s dilemma among Jewish Israelis who oppose the peace accord . Some militants say they want to drive all Arabs out of Israel and its occupied territories . Other , more moderate opponents acknowledge that is impossible . But they admit they have no alternatives . Nahum Barnea , a columnist for Yediot Aharonot , the country ' s largest newspaper , wrote Sunday that the protests are aimed more at Rabin than Arafat . &quot; The animosity toward Rabin is getting close to the hatred that the left felt toward ( former Defense Minister ) Ariel Sharon , &quot; Barnea wrote . &quot; In their minds , Rabin has insulted and humiliated them . The battle is over belief , property and honor. &quot; Until Arafat ' s return , the right_wing had been plagued by months of infighting . But the PLO chairman ' s arrival in Gaza focused attention on several still-undecided parts of the peace deal , which have left many Jews unsettled . &quot; The public is not stupid , &quot; said Zeev ( Benny ) Begin , a prominent member of the opposition Likud Party . &quot; The public knows the prime_minister has been lying to the Israeli people . He ' s been an expert at deception on the_matter of Jerusalem . We will defend Jerusalem -- not against Arafat , but against Rabin. &quot; Although Israel has handed Gaza and Jericho over to Palestinian rule , only future negotiations will determine what other territories will become part of the deal . Many of the more_than 100 # 000 Jewish settlers in the West_Bank and Gaza are worried about what will happen to them . Government opponents have used that uncertainty to draw broader public support . As Haaretz , a highly respected Hebrew daily newspaper , put it Sunday , &quot; If the government intends to continue with the same determination in the peace process , it must come_out publicly and tell the Jewish residents of the territories what their future will be . &quot; The government doesn ' t have to be impressed by the demonstrations , but it does have to give real answers , &quot; the newspaper said .</TEXT>
