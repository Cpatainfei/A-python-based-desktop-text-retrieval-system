   <HEADLINE> BARGAINS / GERI COOK : THE ROUTE TO RESALE ; SHOPS IN PASADENA ' S OLD TOWN OFFER DESIGNER GOWNS TO HOME FURNISHINGS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of the best destinations for a day of treasure-hunting is Old Town in Pasadena , where a cluster of upscale resale stores are within walking distance of each other . First , a word of warning about Pasadena parking meters : Take plenty of quarters because you only get 15 minutes for each one . If you ' re going to be more_than two hours , the public parking structures are cheaper . The American Cancer Society ' s Discovery Shop is a good place to start for some excellent deals on family apparel and home furnishings . All merchandise is donated , either by manufacturers , retailers or private citizens , and the quality is way above thrift-store fare . Whether your budget will allow $ 8 or $ 1 # 800 , the pickings are good . Four good sources for consignment goods are around the corner on Union Street . Silent Partners , a small but well-organized shop , was brimming with good buys on women ' s designer clothing . The focus is_on apparel for the professional woman , and a large selection of suits by Adolfo , Escada and Ellen Tracy reflects this . But there also is dazzling evening wear -- some by designers we rarely see in resale stores . We found an elegant yellow chiffon gown by Greek designer Stavropoulos . This one happened to be new , and was priced at only $ 189 . ( In a department_store , it would probably be $ 500. ) You ' ll find a wide selection of accessories here , as well . More_than three years ago , I wrote_about the great buys on men ' s designer apparel at Bailey ' s , next door to Silent Partners . The deals for men are still terrific , and a new department has been added -- designer resale for the larger woman , with such names as Tamotsu and Criscione on the racks at $ 80 or $ 90 , when they generally sell for around $ 300 . Next door to Bailey ' s is Resale Madness , which has the largest space of any store on the street . When we visited , it had only been open two weeks and the selection was slim . Owner Becky Ramey said the furniture &quot; flew out of here &quot; the previous week because prices were so low . Cross the street to Clothes Heaven , where top designer apparel is crammed onto the racks and tagged at about one-fourth of the original price . We found enough never-worn haute_couture treasures to make the whole day a success . Where to Shop What : Discovery Shop . Location : 77 N . Raymond Ave. , Pasadena .
