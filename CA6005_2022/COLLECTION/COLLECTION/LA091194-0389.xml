   <TEXT> &quot; How extraordinary ! &quot; wrote political_scientist Aaron Wildavsky in 1979 . &quot; The richest , longest-lived , best protected , most resourceful civilization , with the highest degree of insight into its own technology , is_on its way to becoming the most frightened. &quot; Extraordinary , indeed . Life_expectancy in the United States is 75.5 years , up almost 13 years since 1940 and more_than double what it was at the turn_of_the_century . Since 1970 , the infant_mortality_rate has been cut_in half , the death rate from heart_disease ( our No . 1 killer ) has dropped 27 % and the death rate from stroke ( our No . 3 killer ) is down 44 % . Death rates for emphysema , tuberculosis and other once-dreaded diseases have also declined . Polio and smallpox , long the scourge of childhood , have all but disappeared . Deaths from cancer ( our No . 2 killer ) have increased , but that increase is largely attributable to smoking -- which has led to a doubling of the lung_cancer death rate in the last 30 years -- and to two simple facts : ( 1 ) People are living longer . ( 2 ) The sharp decline in fatalities linked to heart_disease and stroke means that other causes of death are rising proportionally . Despite these enormous improvements -- and despite recent improvements in the health of our much brooded-over environment as well -- psychologists , sociologists and epidemiologists say we may well be the most anxious , frightened society in history . No reasonable person can deny that very real dangers lurk in all our lives -- in our air , in our food and water_supply and in other natural and artificial substances . Guns kill . Cigarettes kill . Toxic chemicals , high-fat diets and abuse of alcohol can kill . &quot; But the risks that kill people and the risks that scare people are different , &quot; says Peter Sandman , a risk communications consultant based in Massachusetts . Why are we so scared -- and so often scared by the wrong things ? Many people say the news media are largely to blame . The media , after all , pay the most attention to those substances , issues and situations that most frighten their readers and viewers . Thus , almost every day , we read and see and hear about a new purported threat to our health and safety . We are warned about benzene in our Perrier , Alar on our apples , and asbestos in our school buildings . We are told that popcorn , margarine and red meat -- as well as Chinese , Italian , French and Mexican food -- all contribute to heart_disease . Aluminum and zinc are reported to contribute to Alzheimer ' s disease . Alcohol is blamed for virtually every malady but the national_debt . And everything , it ' s said , causes cancer : Caffeine . Cellular phones . Dioxin . High-power lines . The hole in the ozone_layer . Hot dogs . Secondhand smoke . Silicone breast_implants . While we are fretting about the fat in our fettuccine_alfredo ( &quot; a heart_attack on a plate , &quot; according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest ) , we are also being bombarded by terrifying tales of violent crime , crashing airplanes , an AIDS epidemic among heterosexuals and a global warming trend . The media are supposed to serve as an early_warning_system for the public , and they have long fulfilled this function in alerting people to a range of risks , from high-fat diets to cars ( the Ford Pinto ) to medical devices ( the Dalkon Shield IUD ) . In fact , says Al Meyerhoff , senior attorney for the Natural_Resources Defense Council , an environmental group , the media &quot; almost do too good a job &quot; in sounding alarms . &quot; One of the political problems the environmental movement has had to deal with , particularly over the last few years , is simply getting_through the clutter of all_the different messages of gloom and doom that the public receives , &quot; Meyerhoff says . But for the media to &quot; not say anything at all is the worst crime , &quot; says Marlene Cimons , who covers federal regulatory_agencies for the Los Angeles Times . &quot; If there ' s a debate going_on , people need to know about it . My responsibility is to report it in a balanced way . I can ' t help the way people react. &quot; Many people -- a number of them journalists -- say that media coverage of risk issues is often un balanced , and that does make reporters responsible_for the way people react . Too often , critics say , the media provide not just essential information and legitimate warnings but unwarranted alarms for an increasingly susceptible audience , one willing to see risk in almost everything . In an effort to educate the public and attract readers and viewers , the media often overplay risks of dubious legitimacy . Scientific studies show that many of the alleged hazards the media trumpet are either misstated , overstated , nonexistent or that there just is not enough scientific evidence yet to yield reliable guidance on the true risk for the average American . David Ropiek , a longtime environmental reporter for WCB-TV in Boston , says risk coverage &quot; gets_to the most fundamental failing of the media today. &quot; In their zeal to have an impact , Ropiek says , journalists are &quot; seduced . . . into playing_up what is dramatic. &quot; But emphasizing &quot; overdramatized &quot; stories , suggesting that &quot; everything you eat will kill you , that every breath will kill you , . . . profoundly colors the public psyche , &quot; Ropiek says . &quot; We start living like Chicken Littles being told the sky is falling. &quot; Why did many Americans suddenly decide last fall , for the first time , to tell national pollsters that crime is &quot; the most important problem facing the country &quot; ? Could it have been because last year , for the first time , ABC , CBS and NBC nightly news_programs devoted more time to crime than to any other topic ? Several media critics think so ; as a Los Angeles Times Poll showed early this year , people say their &quot; feelings about crime &quot; are based 65 % on what they read and see in the media and 21 % on experience . Not everyone agrees that the media skew the degree of risk in our society . Howell Raines , editor of the editorial pages of the New York Times , says we live_in &quot; a dangerous world , &quot; and the media have been a major player in making people more aware of those dangers . &quot; Risk is not just about the statistical threat to health and life , &quot; Raines says . &quot; Risk is also about what kind of society you want to have . . . . I think we ' re probably doing a better job ( in the media ) if we ' re responding to the popular sense of risk rather than the scholarly side of risk. &quot; Michael Jacobson , executive_director of the Center for Science and the Public Interest -- which conducted the widely publicized studies of movie_theater popcorn and ethnic food -- says the media have done &quot; an excellent job of alerting people to problems roughly in_proportion_to the importance of the problems. &quot; But studies show just the opposite . &quot; A direct comparison between hazards as topics of news_stories and ( hazards ) as causes of death shows essentially no relationship between the two , &quot; said social_scientists Eleanor Singer and Phyllis Endreny in their study of risk coverage by national and local newspapers , newsmagazines and television_stations . The reason , says Sandman , the risk communications consultant , is that &quot; hazard and outrage are independent of each other , &quot; and the media are &quot; in the outrage business. &quot; &quot; Most media coverage of risk is about outrage , not about hazard , &quot; he says . Why ? Because people and their emotions generally make_for more riveting stories -- especially on TV -- than do dry , often tentative or conflicting scientific facts . &quot; It ' s a basic rule of journalism to get the human angle , &quot; says Jeff Greenfield , an analyst for ABC News . &quot; But with a complicated , technical story . . . the concerns , the worries , the fears of people . . . will always carry more weight than the disputes and the cautions of the experts . &quot; Human drama , human emotion is what works well on television , &quot; Greenfield says . &quot; Maybe sometimes too well. &quot; Pictures also work well on television . Pictures are television . Often dramatic pictures -- mothers sobbing at a toxic dump , for instance -- may get a story on the air even when the underlying science is shaky at best . In his studies on coverage of risk situations , Sandman has found that the media devote most of their space and time to &quot; opinions , not facts . . . to how upset people are ( about an alleged risk ) rather than about how likely this risk is to kill you. &quot; When he is hired to advise industrial clients involved in risk stories , Sandman says , he tells them not to waste time giving reporters facts on why they do not think their product or service is not dangerous ; instead , he tells them to &quot; get the compassionate stuff in . ( Say ) you ' re sorry , you made a mistake , you ' re going to do something about it. &quot; Only that approach , he says , can counter the outrage the media will report . &quot; The media don ' t create the outrage , &quot; Sandman says , &quot; but they cover it and , inevitably , they amplify it. &quot; No risk creates as much media outrage -- or attention -- as the threat of cancer , the disease that kills more_than half a_million Americans every year . Even though heart_disease kills 40 % more people -- more_than 700 # 000 Americans a year -- cancer evokes special feelings of dread . Cancer can be painful , debilitating , disfiguring ; it can drain your strength and spirit -- and your life ' s savings . Around the turn_of_the_century , cancer carried such a stigma that in some places , cancer cases were given other , less terrifying -- albeit incorrect -- diagnoses . The disease was not mentioned in polite company . Now , says Sharon Begley , a Newsweek senior writer who specializes in science and the environment , there ' s a &quot; cancer fixation in this country ; &quot; we can ' t stop talking_about it . In the media , this often translates into what Begley and others call &quot; the cancer-of-the-week syndrome. &quot; Most of these stories involve charges that this chemical or that pesticide causes cancer . But Bruce Ames , a biochemist and molecular biologist at UC Berkeley , says the three main causes of cancer are not the much-publicized pesticides or other chemicals developed since World_War_II , but &quot; smoking , dietary imbalances and chronic infections. &quot; Ames , who performs no consulting for private industry , is the director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences Center and the recipient of more prestigious awards than you could shake a test_tube at . He also invented the standard laboratory test for cancer-causing agents . The onetime darling of the ecology movement , he now makes such provocative statements as : &quot; I don ' t think pesticide residues have anything to do with cancer. &quot; But the media almost invariably focus_on pesticides and other artificial chemicals -- &quot; story after story , &quot; Ames complains . A 1992 study by researchers Robert Lichter , Stanley Rothman and Mark Mills supports Ames ' judgment . Their study of 1 # 147 stories on cancer over 20 years found that the major print and broadcast media gave the most attention to artificial carcinogens that scientists generally thought were low risk , while largely neglecting the often natural carcinogens that the scientists thought were higher risks . Ames says &quot; 99.99 % of the pesticides we consume are naturally present in plants to ward_off insects and other predators. &quot; One cup of coffee , he says , contains 10 grams of natural carcinogens -- the amount the average American consumes in pesticide residues in one year . The average American , Ames says , ingests 10 # 000 times more natural pesticides than artificial pesticide residues every day . But Ames thinks that fruits and vegetables , which contain carotenoids and antioxidant nutrients such_as Vitamins_C and E , suppress the cancer process -- despite two recent studies calling these conclusions ( and earlier studies ) into question . Thus , he argues -- and he wants the media to point_out -- pesticides actually help prevent cancer ; they lower the cost and increase the yield of produce , enabling more people to eat them . &quot; Pesticides , &quot; he says , &quot; are one of the public health advances of the century. &quot; But what of widely reported laboratory studies that have shown pesticides and some_other chemicals to be toxic ? What of the Delaney Clause , the 1958 law that prohibits any food_additive , including pesticide residues , that have been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals ? Ames says that the standard cancer tests -- feeding chemicals at high doses to rats , then extrapolating to lower doses for humans -- is not a good way to find_out if a substance will cause cancer in humans . He argues that large doses cause cells to proliferate and the new , mutated cells to form tumors . Under normal circumstances , a body repairs cell mutations before cancer develops . But a rat -- or any other animal -- cannot do this if its metabolism is overwhelmed by a massive dose of chemicals . Environmental activists say such chemicals should be banned anyway , on the theory that it is better to be safe now than sorry later . Ames thinks that that is bad science and bad public policy , and he says it is bad journalism for the media not to point it out . When pesticides are banned , he says , all that ' s left is organic or other pesticide-free produce , which is more expensive . That deprives many people , especially the poor , of a natural &quot; medicine &quot; and creates what Daniel Puzo , who covers food safety issues for the Los Angeles Times , calls &quot; an obvious inequity . . . in our system. &quot; Many scientists and risk assessment experts agree . &quot; The economics is at the most basic level , &quot; says John Graham , director of the Center for Risk Analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health . &quot; If the prices of fruits and vegetables go_up , people are likely to eat fewer fruits and vegetables , &quot; and there is solid evidence that eating more produce makes you healthier . &quot; This is not rocket science , &quot; Graham says . Journalists do not need &quot; advanced degrees from Harvard &quot; to make this connection . Despite the media coverage of and public anxiety about a &quot; cancer epidemic &quot; triggered by environmental pollutants , &quot; less than 5 % of human cancer can be traced to causes that are within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency , &quot; Graham says . Indeed , according to the National Cancer Institute , the age-adjusted mortality_rate for all cancers combined except lung_cancer has been declining since 1950 , except for those 85 and over . But one would n ' t get that impression from the news media . The same is true of a whole range of other &quot; risks. &quot; Violent crime ? Certainly , urban life is much more violent than it was 40 years ago . Random violence is far more prevalent . But despite what television says , FBI and Justice_Department statistics show that the national crime_rate , including violent crime , has been fairly level for 20 years -- and it dropped slightly last year . Silicone breast_implants ? The news media have been filled with tales of cancer and other diseases attributed to these devices . But in June , researchers at the Mayo Clinic reported that they could find no connection between silicone implants and the diseases that had been attributed to them . In August , researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital said preliminary tests in a small study suggested that silicone seeping from implants may actually help fight breast_cancer . Although some doctors have challenged the methodology and provenance of studies that seem to exculpate breast_implants , Elinor Brecher , who has written widely on the issue for the Miami Herald , says : &quot; There has yet to be a credible study supporting the women -- and their lawyers -- who claim they have this disease or any of those diseases. &quot; Brecher -- who had breast_cancer , a double mastectomy and two silicon breast_implants -- acknowledges that &quot; some women have had some problems &quot; with the implants , but she says she has been &quot; deeply disturbed . . . outraged &quot; by the way the media have overplayed the risk and underplayed studies repudiating the risks . &quot; It was pure horror , creating needless panic , &quot; she wrote . Heterosexual AIDS ? The disease has wreaked horrible devastation . It is a shattering , global tragedy that warrants government action , scientific_research and human compassion . But statistics from the Centers_for_Disease_Control make_it clear that the media -- which long ignored or underplayed the threat in the gay community -- have overstated the threat in the general heterosexual community . AIDS remains confined , by an overwhelming margin , to gays , bisexuals and intravenous drug_users . Although the number and percentage of heterosexual AIDS deaths have increased considerably in recent years -- especially among women -- only 6 % of all adult and adolescent AIDS cases have involved heterosexual contact , the CDC says -- and two-thirds of those involved people who had_sex with someone who already had ( or was in a known risk group for ) HIV infection . Only 2.2 % of AIDS cases have involved heterosexuals with no other known risk factor . In other words , AIDS is not presently a serious threat to the non-promiscuous , non-intravenous drug-using , North_American heterosexual -- notwithstanding the Time magazine cover stories ( &quot; How heterosexuals are coping_with a disease that can make sex deadly &quot; ) and Oprah Winfrey warnings ( &quot; AIDS has both sexes running scared . Research studies now project that 1 in 5 . . . heterosexuals could be dead of AIDS in the next three years &quot; ) . Secondhand smoke is probably the risk issue getting the most media , public and political attention right now , so its coverage -- and the controversy surrounding it -- is worth examining . Although virtually no one outside the tobacco_industry doubts that smokers run a much higher risk of lung_cancer and other diseases , the science on secondhand smoke is more problematic . Some critics have accused the EPA of distorting the findings in its landmark 1993 report alleging a link between secondhand smoke and lung_cancer and other diseases . Critics in science , medicine and the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service say the EPA ignored contrary studies , used unreliable methodology , failed to consider such &quot; confounding factors &quot; as diet , health_care , poverty , heredity and consumption of alcohol and caffeine and changed its statistical standards midstream to produce the politically desired result . &quot; I am adamantly opposed to smoking ; I completely agree about the magnitude of this health threat for people who smoke , &quot; says Michael Gough , senior associate in the congressional Office of Technology Assessment . &quot; But I think that the EPA played very fast and loose with its own rules_in order to come_to the conclusion that ( secondhand ) smoke is a carcinogen. &quot; Most mainstream media -- daily newspapers , weekly newsmagazines , the TV networks -- have ignored or given such short_shrift to suggestions that the EPA data was flawed and had been manipulated that the tobacco_industry bought full-page advertisements four days in a row in major newspapers across the country in June ; the ads reprinted criticisms of the methodology and integrity of the EPA report that were published in the quarterly journal Forbes MediaCritic . When a_few newspapers -- including the Los Angeles Times -- reported on the ads , they generally emphasized the tobacco_industry ties of critics quoted in the story and of major donors to the Reason Foundation , publisher of Reason magazine , whose former managing_editor was the author . But the stories did not address the substance of the criticisms of the EPA report . Investor ' s Business Daily , National Review and Consumers ' Research Magazine are the only national publications apart from Forbes MediaCritic that published detailed critiques of the EPA report . Science magazine also noted the EPA ' s &quot; fancy statistical footwork , &quot; and the Wall_Street Journal , Washington Post and New York Times , among ( very few ) others published stories on the controversy . The Los Angeles Times devoted several paragraphs to the controversy in a three-part series on secondhand smoke in May , a series that may be the most comprehensive discussion of secondhand smoke in the mainstream media . Although generally evenhanded , the ultimate impact of The Times_series seemed to support those who say secondhand smoke is hazardous ; one story was largely devoted to the plight of a 39-year-old cocktail waitress who &quot; never touched a cigarette but got lung_cancer after 11 years of serving drinks_in the blue haze of a smoky airport bar. &quot; But more_than most mainstream media stories , this series did acknowledge that critics of the EPA report -- and of the campaign against secondhand smoke -- might have some legitimate basis for their opposition . The series touched only briefly on specific criticisms of the EPA report because Sheryl Stolberg , the author , says she did not believe she could resolve that dispute herself , being neither a statistician nor an epidemiologist . Stolberg , a Times medical writer , did allow critics of the EPA to state their general case , and her series did say , at one point , that the evidence on deaths caused by secondhand smoke , &quot; while compelling , is not as complete &quot; as some anti-smoking crusaders insist . The series also noted that the nature of the campaign against secondhand smoke is &quot; a little bit of science -- still emerging , not all_of it conclusive -- shaping a lot of public policy. &quot; &quot; Secondhand smoke is bad for your health , &quot; Stolberg said in an interview , &quot; but I think if you really examine the overall body of evidence , you ' ll see that politics really comes_into play and that the medical evidence has been used to , in_essence , sell the notion to the public that secondhand smoke is bad for you , and it may have led some people to think it ' s a lot worse for the general public than it really is. &quot; Clearly , Stolberg says , &quot; the real health risk from tobacco smoke is smoking. &quot; The issue of secondhand smoke is &quot; more complicated than most people believe. &quot; One reason the media have generally minimized criticism of the EPA report -- and of the anti-secondhand smoke campaign -- is the widespread sense among journalists that spokesmen and apologists for the tobacco_industry have long lied_about the dangers of smoking . As a result , anyone who says anything that seems supportive of a tobacco_industry position is viewed with skepticism . The EPA says it &quot; absolutely stands_by &quot; its report , and in June , the agency released an eight-page , point by point rebuttal of its critics ' charges . The EPA and others in the anti-smoking movement also point_out that most independent scientists agree that heavy exposure to secondhand smoke can exacerbate respiratory illnesses in nonsmokers , can cause death and disease in some healthy nonsmokers and can contribute to respiratory ailments in children . But how much exposure is &quot; heavy &quot; and how great a contributor secondhand smoke is to death and disease -- and to which diseases -- is not incontrovertibly settled , many independent scientists say . &quot; There is a real problem estimating the quantitative effect of environmental tobacco smoke , &quot; says Sir Richard Doll of Oxford_University , one of the world ' s leading epidemiologists . Research on secondhand smoke and heart_disease is relatively new and incomplete . Yet activists say 70 % of the deaths linked to secondhand smoke -- 37 # 000 of the 53 # 000 total -- come from heart_disease . A much smaller number of deaths -- 3 # 000 -- are attributed to lung_cancer , but because of the dreadful power of the word cancer , it was cancer that the EPA emphasized in its report . The first major conclusion , listed at the top of Page 1 of its 137-page report , said secondhand smoke is &quot; a human lung carcinogen , responsible_for approximately 3 # 000 lung_cancer deaths annually in U.S. smokers. &quot; Not surprisingly , that statistic was the lead paragraph in virtually every major media story on the EPA report . Ironically , except for coverage of the U.S. surgeon_general ' s landmark 1964 report and , to a lesser degree , follow-up reports in 1982 and 1986 , the dangers of smoking did not receive widespread media attention until recent years , when activists seized_on the issue of secondhand smoke . Indeed , many medical experts long complained that if the media would cover the hazards of smoking even a fraction as aggressively as they covered many other , lesser hazards , thousands of smokers might quit and thousands of lives might be saved . Many journalists agree . &quot; For years , I think it was true that the risks posed by tobacco smoke were severely underplayed by the media , &quot; says Timothy Noah , an environmental reporter for the Wall_Street Journal . As Susan Okie of the Washington Post documented in 1985 , most magazines ignored the smoking story -- and some censored stories that might have offended the tobacco companies , who accounted_for about 9 % of magazine advertising at the time . Newspapers , which drew only 1 % of their advertising from tobacco companies , were not substantially better . It may be significant that , until relatively recently , many journalists smoked ; like most other smokers , they scoffed at the risks inherent in their habit . But today ' s better-educated journalists -- like their better-educated readers -- are much less likely to smoke . In contrast with previous generations of journalists -- many of them hard-living , hard-drinking news hounds whose only exercise was using a dull knife to cut a tough steak -- many journalists are now card-carrying members of the jogging , tofu-eating , Perrier-drinking , health club set , and they aggressively object to smoking anywhere around them . Responsible reporters try hard to prevent their personal feelings from unfairly influencing what they cover , but they are only human , and that ' s not always possible . As Noah says : &quot; The changing culture of the newsroom has probably affected the way the media cover &quot; the smoking issue . Besides , the growing sensitivity of many in the media to smoking has coincided with the development of secondhand smoke as a &quot; hot &quot; story . Time magazine was correct when it said this year that &quot; nothing has galvanized today ' s anti-smoking activities as much as the Environmental Protection Agency report released a year ago that classified environmental tobacco smoke as a Class-A carcinogen. &quot; That enabled anti-smoking activists -- like AIDS activists before them -- to say : &quot; Everyone is at risk. &quot; No longer could nonsmokers smugly say to themselves , &quot; OK , go_ahead , smokers ; you want to poison yourself , be my guest. &quot; Now , according to the EPA , everyone was being poisoned . The groundswell of opposition to smoking mushroomed , and the media moved_in : TV specials . Page 1 series . Newsmagazine cover stories ( Time : &quot; Is It All Over for Smokers &quot; ; U.S. News &amp; World Report : &quot; Should Cigarettes Be Outlawed ? &quot; ) The EPA report made smoking &quot; a political issue , not just a medical issue , &quot; says Cristine Russell , a special health correspondent for the Washington Post , and the media have always been more interested in politics than in medicine ; the former provides clear conflict while the latter is usually burdened by uncertain data . &quot; The No . 1 health story in the American media today is tobacco , &quot; Noah says . &quot; I think it ' s also the No . 1 health risk in America today . that ' s a happy convergence of circumstances. &quot; In fact , news media coverage of the hazards of smoking has become so aggressive that studies show Americans believe that more_than 40 % of the people who smoke heavily will die of lung_cancer . The real figure is less than 10 % -- and perhaps as low as 5 % . Next : The impact of risk coverage on society , government and the economy .
