   <HEADLINE> NORTH , SOUTH YEMEN SOLDIERS CLASH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hundreds of Yemeni soldiers were killed or wounded in fierce clashes between northern and southern troops at a joint military camp near the capital , southern authorities and Western diplomats said Thursday . But northern security officials put the casualty toll much lower -- at dozens killed and hundreds wounded.The conflicting estimates could not immediately be reconciled . Fighting has flared over the last two days at a camp about 40 miles north of this capital , where both sides have military_posts . The clash was the nearest to the capital since sporadic military confrontations began in February between troops loyal to President Ali Abdullah Saleh of the north and Vice_President Ali Salim Bidh of the south . The battles in the impoverished Red_Sea nation threaten to unravel a nearly four-year union of the conservative north and the formerly Marxist south . Merging of the two countries ' armies -- one of the last steps of the unification process -- has not been completed . In the heart of the capital , Deputy Prime_Minister Hassan Mohammed Makki , a prominent figure from northern Yemen , survived an assassination attempt Thursday , but three of his aides were killed , the Interior Ministry said .</TEXT>
