   <TEXT> Five years after the destruction of the Berlin Wall , killer of Cold_War freedom-seekers , its ghost has risen to cause more heartaches . In 1961 , the East_German Communists bulldozed , dynamited and burned whole neighborhoods in a 95-mile-long swath through the city and around West_Berlin to make space for the wall . People were given only hours to leave their homes . Some jumped from windows and fled to the Western sector , but most piled their belongings onto carts and moved_out of what would become a no man ' s land . Now that the Communists are gone and Germany is reunited , about 1 # 500 of those who owned their homes -- East_Germany had a mix of nationalized and private_property -- demand that their land be returned . But Chancellor Helmut Kohl ' s government , which inherited much of the property , says that it was seized under East_German law and that giving it back would set a dangerous precedent . Dispossessed owners say that ' s immoral . &quot; We thought we were through_with totalitarianism , but the federal_government is continuing a crime committed by the Communists , &quot; said one of them , 58-year-old Renate Saebsch . The dispute began soon after Germany was reunified in 1990 and has been heating_up since . A growing number of politicians and legal_experts are siding with the dispossessed . Berlin ' s municipal_government , usually a close ally of Kohl , opposes him in the property dispute and is blocking any plans by the federal_government to develop the real_estate . &quot; You can ' t criticize the wall for decades . . . and then refuse to give its victims satisfaction , &quot; said Elmar Pieroth , the city finance_minister . East_Germany built the wall_in August , 1961 , to stop its citizens from fleeing to the West . At least 172 people were killed trying to get_through or over it . The few remnants include a stretch not far from Checkpoint Charlie , the crossing in the old American sector , filled with ragged holes chopped out during celebrations of the wall ' s end in 1989 . A death strip that once bristled with machine_guns , guard towers and electric fences , guarded by snarling dogs , now is largely covered with grass . Children play where their elders died trying to flee . In a_few places , there are small monuments to victims . Decapitated tops of several guard towers , collected on one lot , resemble giant eight-sided mushrooms sprouting from the ground . New streets have been built parallel to the wall ' s route . Gypsy women sell Cold_War souvenirs from sidewalk tables : Soviet and East_German officers ' caps , Communist medals , chunks of masonry they say are pieces of the wall . American investors will be building a huge office complex where Checkpoint Charlie ' s barriers and soldiers once stood_guard against the East . Daimler-Benz and Sony plan big projects on Potsdammer Platz , a square that was once the heart of Berlin . But the ownership dispute , involving about half the lots seized to create the wall , is delaying development elsewhere . Matthias Weckerling , spokesman for the federal Justice Ministry , says the government would like to return the properties to their original owners , but cannot under the current legal conditions . East_Germany seized the land under its defense law . Weckerling said giving the real_estate back could call into question every legal property expropriation undertaken in four decades of Communist rule . Schools , fire_stations , hospitals , streets , army barracks and sewage plants were built_on expropriated real_estate in East_Germany . Berlin has proposed federal legislation stating specifically that only those whose land was taken_for the wall would be eligible to recover it . Some of Kohl ' s Cabinet_ministers support the idea , but others contend it is unconstitutional . Meanwhile , the property_owners are losing patience . Inge Bergk , 59 , accuses the federal_government of intending to sell the land and pocket the profits .</TEXT>
