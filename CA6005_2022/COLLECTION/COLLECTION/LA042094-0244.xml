   <HEADLINE> CHINESE PREMIER BEGINS GOODWILL TOUR OF CENTRAL ASIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Promising that China will not try to reassert its traditional influence in this region , Chinese Premier Li Peng has launched a 12-day tour down the ancient Silk_Road , which winds through the newly independent Central Asian_nations . &quot; Even when our economy is developed and our country becomes rich and powerful , we will never claim hegemony and will always maintain friendly relations based on equal rights , &quot; Li told officials in this Uzbek capital Tuesday , the morning after his arrival . Shen Guo Fang , a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman traveling with the delegation , added that closer Chinese ties to the former Soviet Central Asian republics will not affect relations with Russia . Li , 66 , is taking his five-nation tour at a leisurely pace . The visit , first planned for last year , was postponed amid rumors that the premier had heart problems . Li will visit four of the five former Soviet Central Asian republics -- Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan , Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan -- plus Mongolia . He is the first Chinese leader to pay a state visit to the new nations since independence in 1991 and the first to visit Mongolia in 34 years . Li will not visit war-torn Tajikistan , which includes a large chunk of mountainous territory in the Gorny Badakhshan region that China claims as its own . Beijing ' s biggest worry about its new neighbors on its northwestern flank is that the Muslim nations could fan the Islamic fundamentalist movements that have already taken_root in western China . Li is expected to try to build stronger ties with the secular leaders of Central Asia as well as reassure them that China has no designs on their land .</TEXT>
