   <HEADLINE> HOUSE OKS BILL ON VITAMIN BENEFIT CLAIMS ; HEALTH : MEASURE GIVES CONSUMERS CONTINUED ACCESS TO PRODUCTS BUT AFFORDS GOVERNMENT RIGHT TO OVERSEE NUTRITIONAL AND DIETARY SUPPLEMENT INDUSTRY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The House ended an intensely fought battle between the dietary supplement industry and its critics Friday by approving a measure that guarantees consumers ' continued access to the products but also preserves the government ' s right to regulate claims used to sell them . Passage of the House bill is regarded_as a victory for the Food and Drug Administration and members of the public health community , who wanted undisputed scientific evidence of a supplement ' s health benefits before claims of such benefits can be used to promote or sell it . The House bill differs from a more restrictive version passed earlier by the Senate but the Senate is expected to approve the House bill before Congress adjourns . The issue was one of the most hotly debated in Congress this session , prompting a multimillion-dollar campaign by the $ 4-billion industry and a widespread grass-roots letter-writing campaign by consumers who feared that they would lose access to their vitamins . &quot; This bill resolves an extremely contentious issue , &quot; said Rep . Henry A . Waxman ( D-Los Angeles ) , who was instrumental in drafting the House compromise . The House legislation , which passed_on a voice vote , would prohibit the makers of supplements from making health claims for their products for four years while the issue is under study by a special commission . After two years , the commission would make recommendations , which would be reviewed by the secretary of health and human services and possibly by Congress . During this time , manufacturers would have to comply with existing law , which requires &quot; significant scientific agreement &quot; before a vitamin or supplement maker can claim on a product ' s label that it prevents a certain disease or condition . Also , the measure would set the first specific safety standards for dietary supplements , requiring that they not pose a &quot; significant or unreasonable risk &quot; of harm if used as directed . But the bill slightly weakens current rules . Now , manufacturers have to provide the FDA with safety evidence 75 days before a product is introduced into the market and the FDA must approve the product before it can be sold . The bill changes that slightly , saying that if the FDA does not specifically disapprove the supplement within the 75-day period , the product can go onto the market . But the FDA could still later try to remove the product . In another concession to the supplement industry , manufacturers gained permission to make certain nutritional claims , such_as &quot; Vitamin_A is necessary for good vision. &quot; While such statements are medically accurate , industry critics fear that they would be used in a way that would imply nutritional supplements are necessary . Also , the House bill would allow supplement makers to distribute reprints of preliminary scientific studies that describe potential health benefits of supplements . All sides seemed pleased with the outcome . The legislation &quot; will help to keep our industry alive , &quot; said Gerald Kessler of the Nutritional Health Alliance , which represents the dietary supplement industry . &quot; We have made great progress . . . . Many compromises were made to achieve a workable bill. &quot; FDA spokesman Jim O ' Hara said that the agency &quot; will work hard to protect consumers from unsafe or deceptively labeled products. &quot; But he cautioned : &quot; We are concerned , though , that some dietary supplement manufacturers might try to interpret this legislation in a way that would let them make deceptive claims . Consumers need to exercise vigilance in judging the validity of many of the claims. &quot; Bruce Silverglade of the Center for Science in the Public Interest , a consumer advocacy group , called the compromise a &quot; win-win &quot; for consumers . &quot; The bill preserves access to supplement ingredients while protecting consumers from misleading health claims and unsafe products. &quot; But &quot; consumers should remain wary of other dubious marketing practices , &quot; he added .</TEXT>
