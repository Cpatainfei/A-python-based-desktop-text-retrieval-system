   <HEADLINE> PENTAGON ORDERS SERVICES TO PLAN FOR CUTS IN NEW WEAPON_SYSTEMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Pentagon ' s top leadership has ordered the military_services to plan for the possible cancellation or delay of nearly every large new weapon_system in the planning or development stages . In a memorandum Thursday , Deputy Defense_Secretary John M . Deutch asked the Army , Navy and Air_Force to draw_up specific alternatives for the major weapon programs planned by the services . The cost savings would pay_for &quot; improvements in other areas. &quot; Deutch ' s memo alarmed the military_services and defense_contractors , who said such cuts could weaken the nation ' s defenses . The memo was intended by Deutch to be &quot; a huge wake-up call &quot; to the military_services that they will have to delay or eliminate hardware programs or face deep cuts_in other areas , a Pentagon official said Sunday . Deutch is &quot; telling people to take_notice because we have very tough decisions coming , &quot; the official said . Top Pentagon officials received the memo Friday , and a number of military and industry officials expressed distress when they learned about it over the weekend . &quot; You ' re going to hear a lot of screaming &quot; by Air_Force officials over the proposed delay of up_to four years in producing the F-22 jet fighter , an Air_Force official said Sunday . Deutch , with the support of Defense_Secretary William J . Perry , is searching for budget_cuts because the Pentagon lacks funds to carry_out its missions . Last month , the General Accounting Office said the Defense_Department has underestimated its costs and exaggerated its savings , and will find it is $ 150 billion short over the next five years . The memo doesn ' t say how much money Deutch wants to save , so it cannot be determined how many programs could be affected . Deutch spared no military branch , and his list includes some of the services ' most treasured gems : The Army was ordered to &quot; develop a program alternative that terminates &quot; the only new programs under development , such_as the Comanche helicopter and the Advanced Field_Artillery System . It means the Army will have to settle for only upgraded versions of the Apache helicopter and the Paladin artillery system . The Air_Force , Deutch said , should prepare_for possible cancellation of the Tri-Service Standoff Attack Missile as well as for a four-year delay in the F-22 fighter and a seven-year delay in its Joint Primary Aircraft Training System . The Navy was told to submit plans for slowing production of Arleigh Burke-class destroyers and new attack_submarines , as well as for canceling the Marine Corps ' s V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft .</TEXT>
