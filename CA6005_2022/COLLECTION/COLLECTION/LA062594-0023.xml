   <HEADLINE> CORRUPTION FIGHTER LEADS BELARUS VOTE ; ELECTION : ALEXANDER G . LUKASHENKO , 39 , TAKES 45.1 % OF THE BALLOTS IN A POLITICAL UPSET . HE FAVORS CLOSER TIES WITH RUSSIA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a huge political upset , a dour young corruption fighter who favors closer ties with Russia was_on the brink Friday of winning an election and becoming this tiny country ' s first president . According to preliminary returns , Alexander G . Lukashenko , at 39 the youngest of six candidates , earned 45.1 % of the vote_in this sleepy , Utah-sized corner of the former Soviet_Union . Vyacheslav F . Kebich , the 58-year-old prime_minister and odds-on favorite , came_in a distant second with 17.4 % , despite backing from the government-owned press and predictions that he would do far better . Because Lukashenko failed to win a majority , he and Kebich will compete in a runoff election sometime in the next two weeks . Lukashenko is expected to win easily . As a deputy to the Supreme Soviet , the Belarus legislature , Lukashenko rose to national fame by accusing 70 government officials -- including Kebich and another candidate for president , Stanislav S . Shushkevich -- of stealing government money . In an interview a_few days before the election , Lukashenko said his first priority would be continuing the battle against corruption , or , as he put it , &quot; healing our syphilitic society. &quot; That battle , he said , had already put his life in danger : He told voters that his family was in hiding , while he himself was forced to switch cars three or four times a day to throw_off would-be assailants . Last week , he said a drive-by assassin had shot at him but missed . He accused Kebich of trying to kill him . Police authorities and government-run television dismissed those claims as an attention-getting hoax . Kebich called him a drunk . On the campaign trail , Lukashenko spoke only Russian -- which is similar to Belarussian and is universally understood here -- as a matter of principle . He also favored a treaty with Moscow to readopt the Russian ruble as the official currency . Belarus already has a currency , the Belarus ruble -- known locally as the rabbit , because the baby-blue one-ruble note sports a smiling hare . But it has gone_into a tailspin . In U.S. dollar terms , the rabbit today is worth a quarter of what it was three months ago . Under the monetary union treaty , Belarussians could trade weakening rabbits for stronger Russian rubles . But the deal -- worked_out between Kebich and Russian Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin -- would give Moscow control of Belarus monetary policy . Critics say it trades Belarus ' economic sovereignty for short-term gains . Lukashenko , a thin-faced , gravel-voiced collective_farm chief , told voters that Moscow would rather sign that treaty with him than with Kebich . &quot; The main idea of my campaign is ' new people , ' &quot; he said . &quot; In Moscow , they don ' t want to even speak with old people like Kebich or Shushkevich. &quot; He also pledged not to &quot; force ( privatization ) upon voters &quot; and reassured them that &quot; I ' m not an economist on the macro level , but on the micro level -- the level of people who work_on the farms and at the factories. &quot; Zenon S . Poznyak and Shushkevich -- independence-minded candidates who oppose the monetary union treaty and support fast-track economic reforms -- came_in third and fourth . Poznyak got 12.9 % of the vote , Shushkevich 9.9 % . Turnout was 78.9 % overall . Kebich and his government-run press fought an ugly campaign , accusing Poznyak and Shushkevich of wanting to stir tensions between the country ' s 8 million Belarussians and 1.3 million Russians . Kebich ' s claim that the election of either Poznyak or Shushkevich would mean civil_war -- strange-sounding rhetoric in this drowsy former Soviet republic -- was taken_to_heart by voters , who are frightened by the conflicts they see in neighboring Ukraine and Latvia . But his attacks on Lukashenko seem to have backfired . Government television reached a banal low earlier this week , broadcasting an interview with an Aeroflot flight_attendant who -- apparently reading a cue card -- accused Lukashenko of eating chocolates that had been in her purse ( and leaving the wrappers behind ) on a flight two years ago .</TEXT>
