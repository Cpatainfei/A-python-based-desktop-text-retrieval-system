   <HEADLINE> PLACE IN THE SUN ; NICE , SENSUAL CAPITAL OF THE FRENCH_RIVIERA , ALWAYS SEEMS WARMER AND BRIGHTER THAN WHEREVER YOU ' VE JUST COME FROM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> THE AIR FRANCE AIRBUS FROM gray , icy Paris changes key , eases down through the clouds and banks out over the Mediterranean . Suddenly , below us , Nice shines . Red tile_roofs burn dimly in the late winter sun ; white apartment blocks glow against brown and green hills . The Baie des Anges , or Bay of the Angels , around which Nice curves gently , is a patchwork of muted turquoise ( the shade of the veined ceramic balusters on villa terraces all_over this stretch of coastline ) , deep marine blue ( a blue that seems to have no bottom ) , pale sky blue , murky blue with notes of purple , avocado green , sea_green , seaweed brown and more . We swoop down close to the water and land at its very edge , on a runway built out into the bay at the Aeroport de Nice -- Cote d ' Azur . This is a typical arrival in Nice . One always seems to be approaching it from some place colder and less bright . And whether glimpsed first from the air or from the autoroute , it always looks warm , handsomely illuminated , welcoming . Its sunny , intensely colored , mild-tempered atmosphere is so immediately , sensually engaging that the visitor ' s first reaction , upon stepping onto local soil , is likely to be a smile , fueled by a suffusion of well-being . Nice is the capital of the Cote d ' Azur or Azur Coast -- the_French Riviera , the glamorous maritime extension of Provence . Bordered in the west by the Var River and in the east by a string of little mountains -- Mont Boron , Mont Alban , Mont Vinaigrier and Mont Gros -- running inland from the sea , Nice is the fifth-largest city in France , with a population approaching 400 # 000 . It is a city composed of vastly different quartiers , or neighborhoods , from sterile condominium communities to North African slums , from blocks of boring petit_bourgeois apartment blocks to clusters of elegant mansions hidden behind high walls and bougainvillea , from workaday shopping streets to grand boulevards and squares . It is a city full of art , with museums devoted to Matisse and Chagall , to naive and contemporary painting and sculpture , to local artists and the local past . It boasts a flashy casino and several major agglomerations of convention facilities . Its Promenade des Anglais , which curves right along with the coastline from the edge of the airport to the Jardin Albert 1er , is one of the most famous and graceful seafront esplanades in the world . ( The promenade was named in honor of the local English colony , which constructed it in 1820. ) The historic and sentimental heart of Nice , though , and the portion of the city likely to appeal most urgently to the senses , is a large , irregular wedge of real_estate in its southeastern precincts . The blunt end of this wedge is the far bank of the Vieux Port , or Old Port ; it tapers_off in the gardens just past the Place Massena . Within this area are not only that port and that square , but also the hilltop park known as Le Chateau ( though there hasn ' t actually been a chateau on the site since 1706 ) , the hilly pedestrian quarter of Vieux Nice ( probably the closest thing to an Italian hill town that exists on French soil ) , the famous flower and produce market on the Cours Saleya -- and a stylish continuation of the Promenade des Anglais called the Quai des Etats-Unis , or Quay of the United States . Within this wedge , as far as I ' m concerned , is the real Nice . The Old Port is sort of a deckle-cut rectangular basin , long and narrow . Its innermost portion , the Bassin Lympia , is crowded with modest pleasure_craft and a ragtag fleet of dinghies and outboards . A bit farther out , in the Bassin des Amiraux , six or eight small commercial fishing_boats still dock with their just-caught seafood -- turbot , red_mullet , monkfish , squid , octopus , occasional spiny_lobsters and the_like . On the quay behind the fishing_boats is the Marche aux Puces de Nice , or Nice Flea_Market , a little clapboard village of 33 stands , at which everything from crystal and lace to military badges and antique dolls can be found . A far better flea_market , though , arrays itself every Monday to the west of the port , around the Quai Rauba-Capeu ( the &quot; Hat Thief Quay , &quot; so named for its capricious breezes ) , on the Cours Saleya . This is an astonishing bazaar -- 100 or more stands and tables stretch down the length of this beautiful passage . Buildings in shades of ocher , terra_cotta , white , off-white and pink frame the tile-paved Cours . Through the center of it runs a line of yellow canopies . Beneath these and on every side , out_in the all-but-inevitable sun , a veritable panoply of goods is offered -- rusty old locks and keys , exquisite Lalique vases , antique cameras , miniature perfume bottles , lots of silverware and linen and glasses , books , old postcards , LPs ( remember LPs ? ) , lacy baby clothes , paintings , jewelry real and otherwise -- even albums full of clothing labels ( a 1950s Lacoste polo_shirt label , for instance -- for about $ 30 ! ) . Riches of another sort are sold in the same spot Tuesday through Sunday mornings -- flowers , vegetables , fruits and miscellaneous products from local farms . This market , renowned all_over France , is at once manageable in size and incredibly seductive , and is a must to visit -- even if you ' re staying in a hotel and have no place to cook . The stalls explode with color ; the scents of tuberoses , olives , fresh cheese and dried herbs fill the air ; the chatter of the market-goers -- punctuated by the often bawdy cries of the sellers -- is rough , beguiling music . The particulars vary with the season , of course . One day last spring , for instance , there were cherries everywhere -- morellos , pigeon hearts , reverchons -- and apricots and peaches . There were eggplants , some long and thin and purple , others round and white or off-white tinged with violet . Earth-brown mushrooms were heaped here and there , exuding their elemental fragrance . Tiny potatoes , bulbs of fennel , purple artichokes with long stems , fat asparagus , gnarled sweet carrots and great bushy bundles of fresh herbs accented almost every stand . I bought a juicy white peach , eating it messily as I strolled along . Then I bought a serving of the quintessential Nicois street food -- socca . Socca is a thin , crumbly , crepe-like thing made from chickpea ( garbanzo ) flour , olive_oil , salt and water . It is traditionally cooked over a wood fire in wide , black iron pans , dusted with black_pepper and cut_into triangular slices when done and wrapped in paper . It is sold at stands and shops and tiny restaurants all_over Vieux Nice , and elsewhere in town , but there ' s something particularly appealing about buying_it here in the market . The woman who sells it is fond of good-natured double-entendres ( &quot; You ' re my first man this morning , &quot; she once told me with a wink when I showed_up at her stand just after the first socca was done. ) . And her easy familiarity , coupled with the flavor and aroma of this hot , peppery , earthy local specialty , always makes me feel as if Nice has accepted me , or at least welcomed me back . Abutting the Cours Saleya and climbing gradually uphill is the old town , the warren of narrow stone streets called Vieux Nice . The real &quot; old Nice &quot; though -- where the city was born -- must be sought in two other locations , one nearby , one not . The farther site , a_few miles to the north , is the_hill of Cimiez -- where the Romans established their regional capital of Cemenelum in 14 BC . The nearer one , straight uphill from the old town and the Cours Saleya , is the_hill of Le Chateau . Here , about 350 years before the Romans , Phocean Greeks from Marseille had established a minor trading town called Nikaia -- &quot; She who brings victory. &quot; The two settlements developed simultaneously , but by the 5th Century AD , most of the inhabitants of Cimiez had moved to the more agreeable ( and more easily defended ) site nearer the sea . First on the hilltop and then spilling down the slopes to the bay , Nikaia became Nice . Though Cimiez is beyond the confines of my favored wedge of the city , I love going there . The Roman and paleo-Christian ruins are elegantly simple and evocative ; there ' s a superb archeological museum ; the city ' s newly improved and expanded Matisse Museum , in a 17th-Century villa with dark terra_cotta walls and trompe l ' oeil balustrades , displays an attractively miscellaneous collection of Matisse artifacts , early paintings and drawings , liturgical designs and more , and an architecturally spare but richly furnished Franciscan monastery , in whose cemetery Matisse and Raoul Dufy are buried , serves as a quiet spiritual anchor to the spot . From certain vantage_points here , it is possible to see Roman remains , the Matisse villa , the monastery ' s thin spire , an observatory dome across the way on Mont Gros and the ornate late 19th-Century Hotel Regina ( now turned_into luxury apartments ) , all_in one frame of vision . It feels_like an eccentric diorama of 2 # 000 years or so of Nicois history . The hill of Le Chateau , when seen from the quay at night , is an imposing , mysterious sight . It is selectively ( and skillfully ) spotlighted to fine effect , white or yellow beams exposing a patch of green here , vignettes of amber there -- and illuminating the course of a cascade spilling down the hillside . During the day , on the top of the_hill , mystery is replaced by scenes of outdoor domesticity -- children scrambling over playground gear , families spread_out with picnic lunches on the thick grass , couples sipping coffee , or pastis , at the little buvette , or snack_bar . Beyond occasional shards of ancient wall and a rather banal 16th-Century bastion called the Tour Bellanda ( which now houses a small naval museum ) , there isn ' t much to see here -- but this summit , rarely visited by tourists precisely because of its lack of attractions , offers wonderful views of the city and bay and welcome respite from the sometimes loud and crowded streets below . Facing the Quai des Etats-Unis , a staircase and an elevator lead_up to Le Chateau ; the tariff for the latter is about 65 cents one way , $ 1 round-trip . I always buy the one-way billet , then walk down the back side of the_hill , straight into Vieux Nice . I ' ve already compared this quarter to an Italian town . There ' s a good reason for its Italianate flavor : From 1388 until 1792 , and again from 1814 until 1860 , Nice and its region belonged_to the Italian dynasty of the House of Savoy . This heritage is evident all_over the city , but it is particularly vivid in the old town -- in architecture , language ( Nissart , a dialect of Provencal liberally peppered with Italian , is still heard frequently , especially in the markets and the port ) , family_names and , in a more elusive way , local sensibility . The streets curve almost imperceptibly , overhung with narrow iron balconies , open shutters , flower boxes , strings of laundry . The colors of the buildings are earthy but somehow distilled into memorable hues -- the yellow of certain kinds of clay , the beige of desert dust , the pink of flamingos seen though hazy heat . Occupying these structures are endless little shops , some prosaic and geared to locals ( newsstands , pharmacies ) , others are more exotic galleries or boutiques . Scattered through the quarter , too , are many small restaurants and bars . The shops , especially the more conventional ones , bear names like Fantino , Rossetti , Ricci-Gagliolo , Caprioglio , Fuscielli . The eating and drinking places are more international . There are certainly establishments specializing in Nicois cooking ( including socca and a sort of cheeseless pizza called pissaladiere ) , but then there are Scarlett O ' Hara ' s Irish Pub , Billy ' s Tex-Mex Restaurant , Pub Van Gogh , La Table Thai , Nick le Grec and Cafe de Klomp ( &quot; 12 beers on_tap &quot; ) . Some streets wind_off into dark alleys , silent , drab and damp . Others bustle with the bright signs of shops , with busy-bee tourists , strolling tourists , ambling dogs , scampering cats . The old town ' s main square is the cafe-filled Place Rosetti , onto which faces the politely baroque Cathedral of Ste . Reparate . The cathedral is worth a visit , especially for anyone who appreciates exquisitely carved wood paneling and choir stalls . Just before Christmas last year , I stepped into the place early one evening to hear a clutch of pure- if not particularly strong-voiced young_women in white blouses and dark skirts sing Bach , Mozart and a selection of Provencal carols . The church was chilly and packed full , the lights were dim , the feeling was almost medieval . After the concert , in need of both warmth and some measure of modernization , I stopped in a cafe on the Cours Saleya for a glass of wine . Then I walked down the Rue des Ponchettes , on the edge of the old town , just below Le Chateau , and had dinner at my favorite Nicois restaurant , Don Camillo . Here , a young Nice-born chef named Franck Cerutti applies sophisticated techniques to simple local cooking -- producing such wonders as tender baby octopus with plump white_beans , dried cod cooked with olives , pine_nuts and potatoes , red_mullet with socca crepes and tapenade ( olive-caper puree ) and stewed duck with homemade noodles . Cerutti lives a_few doors from his restaurant , which is only a_few yards from the Quai des Etats-Unis , and I encountered him one spring morning several years ago leaning_on the railing above the beach , just staring out at the Baie des Anges . &quot; What are you looking_at ? &quot; I asked . &quot; Just the bay , &quot; he said . And though he had been seeing that body_of_water probably daily for at least 30 years , I understood why he could still find something across its reaches worth gazing at . I stood there with him in silence . This time , the water was no patchwork at all . It was a single color , a subtle blue-tinged green , darkening ever so slightly toward the horizon . The sun , still traveling up from the east , was brilliant yellow -- a morning sun anticipating midday . The sky was bright_blue overhead , pinkish on the edges . &quot; It ' s not_bad , eh ? &quot; said Cerutti finally . &quot; No , &quot; I said , &quot; not_bad at all. &quot; GUIDEBOOK A Nice Place to Visit * Telephone_numbers and prices : The country code for France is 33 .
