   <TEXT> After learning about the hardships facing thousands of sick and orphaned Rwandan children living_in refugee camps , the youngsters at the Venice Boys &amp; Girls Club were determined to help . The youths wanted to raise money to donate to Doctors Without Borders and Operation USA , relief organizations providing assistance in Rwanda and other areas affected by the country ' s civil_war . Forty club_members were able to raise $ 400 in donations , and the group last week presented a $ 300 check to Christa Thorne , a 10-year-old Rwandan and a representative from Operation USA . The remaining money will be donated to Doctors Without Borders . At a meeting Wednesday , club_members listened attentively as Christa , who now lives_in Europe with her parents , spoke about Rwanda , where up_to 500 # 000 have died since a civil_war broke_out in April . Christa talked_about how her mother fled Rwanda to neighboring Burundi and how her uncle was killed &quot; fighting for freedom. &quot; Operation USA spokeswoman Roseanne Katon-Walden brought a detailed map of Rwanda to give club_members a brief history_lesson . The donated money will go toward purchasing medical supplies , specifically the rehydration solutions to combat cholera and dysentery , Katon-Walden said . &quot; The most important thing we got_across is that their money will help save lives , &quot; Katon-Walden said . &quot; We hope that some of the children think_about careers in international relief. &quot; DONNA BIRCH</TEXT>
