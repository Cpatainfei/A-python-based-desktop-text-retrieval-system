   <TEXT> * In response to Column Left , &quot; Face Up to Permanent Joblessness , &quot; Alexander Cockburn , March 15 : Cockburn at least has the honesty to quote Karl Marx and unabashedly argue some nonsense from the same old idiotic Comintern party_line . Cockburn still has not learned the most elementary things about economics . His understanding is still no more sophisticated than that of a Luddite . If job losses because of increased productivity produced &quot; permanent joblessness , &quot; then the Luddites would have been right . When 90 % of human_beings were engaged in subsistence agriculture , the thought of a society where only 3 % to 6 % were engaged in agriculture would have been absolutely horrifying . Obviously , we do not have 84 % to 87 % unemployment . All those extra people found jobs because there were new products and new industries . It evidently does not occur to Cockburn that any new things might be invented in the future , or that many present industries might still be expanding . Jobs are not &quot; found &quot; things . They are not a finite resource existing in a fixed quantity , which must be &quot; distributed &quot; in some fair and equitable manner ( through shorter workweeks and similar manipulations ) . The growth of human wealth and the secular increase in real wages can only occur because of increased productivity ; and increased productivity inevitably means that at some point some people , as with 87 % of subsistence farmers , get thrown_out of work . Marx was talking_about the &quot; industrial reserve army &quot; at a time when unemployment was often as low as 2 % or 3 % . It is the Marxist nostrums of people like Cockburn that have produced periods of unemployment from 10 % to 20 % , which is now standard in Europe . KELLY L . ROSS Van Nuys * Cockburn ' s prophetic commentary on the future of global downsizing and corporate irresponsibility trumpets the call that the working man / woman ( blue collar , white collar or no collar ) must heed . What happened in the Balkans with_regard_to geography is now happening to the working community : a breaking_up of family , communal , civic and economic unity . This Balkanization of the working community is not a product of governmental action but the unleashed force of crass capitalism without any moral or communal underpinnings . Capitalism for capitalism ' s sake ! We as a nation have enshrined a new nationalism : not defined as a group under philosophical and political ideas , but a hollow structure of economic well-being . An economic well-being that in turn is defined by statistics and statistical models . Where our schools , towns and cities are subsumed under the corporate well-being of what business might exist there . This can manifest with the weirdest of logic : Company X buys company Y in a small_town Z , where company X must either scale back company Y or break_up company Y in_order to pay_off the purchase of company Y ! The small_town Z is economically decimated for the well-being of company X . So where will this new nationalism lead us ? Balkanization of the working community will lead to an economic Bosnia where all sides involved are losers . MICHAEL RIDDER Claremont</TEXT>
