   <HEADLINE> VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : WILSON SIGNS MOBILE_HOME ' TIE-DOWN ' BILL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gov . Pete Wilson this week signed a bill requiring new mobile_homes in California to be tied to the ground , in an effort to help prevent the type of wreckage at mobile_home parks experienced during the Northridge earthquake . &quot; This bill will help reduce the damage and destruction that occurs to mobile_homes during earthquakes , &quot; said Wilson , who signed the bill late Wednesday night . The law , which takes_effect 60 days after signing , requires all new or relocated mobile_homes to be fastened to the ground with a system of &quot; tie-downs &quot; used in high-wind regions of the country . Mobile_homes installed before the law takes_effect will not be required to be fixed to the ground . That provision helped gain support for the bill from mobile_home owners , many of whom are senior_citizens living_on fixed incomes who had long opposed required safety devices because of the costs involved . More_than 10 % of the 51 # 062 mobile_homes in Los Angeles County parks were rendered uninhabitable within seconds of the Jan . 17 earthquake , most of which were jolted from their foundations . Another 184 burned to the ground in fires fueled by gas_lines ruptured when the homes shifted from their supports . One blaze resulted in the death of a 92-year-old Chatsworth woman . Six months later , more_than 1 # 700 of the severely damaged mobile_homes are still considered unlivable , according to the California Department of Housing and Community Development .
