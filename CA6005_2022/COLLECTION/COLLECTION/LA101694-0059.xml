   <HEADLINE> ROSEWOOD : A MASSACRE , THE MOVIES AND THE OBLIGATIONS OF MEMORY ; IT TOOK 70 YEARS , A CAST OF CONTENTIOUS HEROES AND THE ART OF THE DEAL , BUT JUSTICE CAME AT LAST TO THE BLACK SURVIVORS OF A RACIAL RAMPAGE IN NORTHERN FLORIDA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Minnie Lee Langley was 9 years old when the world as she knew it came_to an end . She had been born into an uncommonly independent African-American community on Florida ' s upper Gulf Coast just before World_War I . Langley lived with her grandparents , and her prosperous extended family had a fine two-story house nearby , with a piano in the parlor and books on the shelves . But in one week in 1923 , all that was gone . On New Years Day , and for six days afterward , white_men primed with moonshine and bent_on vengeance flocked to the tiny town after a black_man in the adjacent community of Sumner had been accused of assaulting a white_woman . At least 8 people were killed , and the homes , businesses , schools and churches of an entire town -- Rosewood , population 200 -- were leveled . Langley barely escaped . Half-naked , she fled with her family into the swamps . There they watched while Rosewood blazed . &quot; We seen the fires burning , &quot; she recalls , &quot; that fire just leaping over the railroad. &quot; To her young eyes it was like Judgment_Day . Eighty-one now and yard-rake thin , childlike once again with age , Langley is transported back to that place when she speaks_of it , her voice strained yet steady . She remembers watching as a white_man saved her uncle ' s life , wrestling him away from a lynching party . She can still see her 32-year-old cousin , Sylvester Carrier , as he pulled her into a closet under the stairway in the Carrier house . Cousin Syl told her to duck and propped a rifle on her shoulder . &quot; When the crackers burst the door open , &quot; she says , &quot; he shot the first one that came in. &quot; But &quot; the crackers &quot; didn ' t stop coming , some from miles away , some from out of state . Days later , in the swamps , Langley remembers , &quot; they were hunting for us . Anybody they saw in the woods , they just shot them down . They didn ' t care who they were killing. &quot; Langley ' s grandfather would die in the carnage ; her family was separated . She lost everything . For almost 70 years , the events that Minnie Lee Langley can recall so vividly lay half-buried . Whitewashed news account drew national attention for a time , even making the front page of the New York Times . But no one , black or white , was ever indicted for any crime . A local all-white grand_jury interviewed 35 witnesses but claimed there was a lack of evidence of wrongdoing . The survivors scattered quickly -- to Tampa , Jacksonville , Gainesville , Miami and beyond -- too afraid , battered or cynical to try to reclaim their property and their lives . Those who could bear to speak_of it passed down the story , telling their children about the terror and their losses . Local whites told their own version of the massacre behind closed doors , and there was talk_of grisly souvenirs -- body_parts -- kept_in Mason_jars and showed_off from time to time . &quot; I ' ve seen them , &quot; claims Robin Raftis , a writer and former editor of a small north Florida weekly newspaper . &quot; Penises , testicles , fingers , even a toe . You name it , they jarred it. &quot; But when it came_to outsiders , the victims and participants joined in a conspiracy_of_silence and shame . Rosewood had become a forgotten chapter of Southern history . Then last winter , the forgotten was finally officially remembered . Minnie Lee Langley and a handful of other survivors sat in a hearing room in the Florida state_capital in Tallahassee , and testified to what had happened to them and to Rosewood in 1923 . Two months later , Florida Gov . Lawton Chiles signed into law the Rosewood Claims Bill . In an unprecedented act of Southern contrition , the bill set_aside more_than $ 2 million in reparations for Langley and other survivors . The struggle to bare the secret , to dig_up the buried past , to bring Minnie Lee Langley and the others into that hearing room to gain a measure of belated justice is a story almost as compelling as the Rosewood saga itself . In it , the survivors stand with tragic dignity , but around them swirl ego clashes , competing self-interests , suspicion and charges of racism on all sides . As the survivors tried to tell their tale , and officialdom tried to figure_out what to do about it , a small group of men slugged it out on the sidelines to see who would be the hero of the contemporary drama . * Los Angeles was burning . A jury had just acquitted the four police_officers who had beaten Rodney G . King , and racial tensions were erupting there and across the nation . In Miami , police were out_in force as producer Michael O ' McCarthy nervously drove through an African-American neighborhood looking_for Lee Ruth Davis . O ' McCarthy thought it ironic : After having spent a year off-and-on searching for Rosewood survivors , he ' d finally found one -- was_on his way to see her -- and the backdrop was this new conflagration of race and justice denied . Like most Floridians , and the rest of the world , O ' McCarthy would have never heard of Rosewood had Gary Moore , a journalist with the St . Petersburg Times , not passed_through the nearby town of Cedar Key in 1982 and asked local residents why the area was all white . Shocked and intrigued by the answer , the reporter spent the next two years exploring the question full time . Moore ' s first painstaking account of the massacre , written with Faulknerian flourish , laid_out how Rosewood had come_to vanish . He told of the purported assault , which blacks insisted had been carried_out by a white_man . He told of the blood-lust that possessed the mob as it rampaged through the town , killing black people indiscriminately . And he told of Sylvester Carrier ' s courage in fighting_back when his home was besieged , which so infuriated the white attackers that they took the violence to another level . The story inspired a &quot; 60 Minutes &quot; segment in 1983 and was optioned for the movies . But then it sank again into obscurity . O ' McCarthy , an independent producer who ' d toiled without great success in Hollywood , first heard of Rosewood in 1991 , four years after returning to his home state . At the time he was packaging TV movies about serial_killers . At 48 , O ' McCarthy was starting to thicken around the middle , his dark hair turning gray . But he retained enough of his youthful good looks_to take modeling assignments . It was a good thing , too -- his movie earnings needed the help . When he learned from a producer colleague that the Rosewood film project had fizzled , O ' McCarthy drove immediately to the Gulf Hammock , the region of swamp and forest where Rosewood once had stood . A green highway sign marked the spot , but all he saw was a trailer_park , cow pastures and a restored Victorian house , which had been left standing in 1923 because its owners were white . Rosewood ' s other structures had been reduced to scattered brick foundations hidden by overgrowth . The red_cedars that gave the town its name crowded the landscape , as if trying to reclaim the land . O ' McCarthy headed into Sumner , where he asked questions at a general_store , and then on to Cedar Key , nine miles west . He sensed a reticence whenever Rosewood was mentioned . &quot; It was like incest in the family , &quot; he says . This was no mere historical event , he realized . People who participated in the violence still lived_in the area , he was warned , and asking about Rosewood could be dangerous . From Moore ' s article and a transcript of the &quot; 60 Minutes &quot; episode , O ' McCarthy came_up with a list of Rosewood survivors . When he returned to his home_in Miami Beach , he began working the phones . He would have to find people with first-hand knowledge of the massacre willing to sell him the rights to their stories . He tried to enlist the help of civil_rights organizations , such_as the NAACP , Jesse Jackson ' s Rainbow Coalition and the Southern Poverty Law Center . Their resources and reputations could only boost his efforts , and there was another other important consideration . O ' McCarthy knew that the first Rosewood movie had fallen_through partly because it was a period_piece . If these organizations were willing not just to investigate Rosewood but to take it on as a cause , it would give the story a contemporary framework and the narrative of a crusade , which , he figured , would make a movie much more salable . Not that O ' McCarthy was being entirely mercenary . He was a former political editor of the L.A. Free Press who had befriended Black Panthers and protested the Vietnam_War . In 1982 , he was the national spokesman for a veteran ' s hunger_strike designed to bring attention to their issues . From his perspective , the unresolved crimes of 1923 mirrored unresolved issues of the late 20th Century -- problems of race , sex and class . &quot; If you mix these elements together , &quot; he says , &quot; it sets_off a kind of nuclear_reaction , it triggers all_the madness in every participant ' s mind. &quot; At first , every organization he contacted for help turned him down . &quot; Your objectives are laudable , and we believe the truth should be pursued , &quot; an NAACP executive wrote in late 1991 . &quot; Unfortunately , our limited resources both in financial and staff terms rule_out our active participation. &quot; On his own , O ' McCarthy wasn ' t having much luck tracking_down cooperative survivors . He couldn ' t afford to devote full time to the project , and , like the residents of the Gulf Hammock , the victims of Rosewood weren ' t always anxious to talk -- they feared reprisals or simply didn ' t want to dredge_up the painful past . Gary Moore offered him one good lead -- a Tampa family directly related to Sylvester Carrier . But Moore also warned O ' McCarthy that the family was contentious -- one aged survivor had run him out of her yard rather than talk to an outsider about what happened . McCarthy decided to stay clear of them . Finally , about a year after he began working_on the Rosewood project , O ' McCarthy turned_up Lee Ruth Davis . He heard that she was living_in Miami , and he made contact through the simplest of research tools -- the phone_book . When he called , she sounded ready to step_forward , almost as if she ' d been hoping someone would ask her about what had happened in 1923 . Davis welcomed O ' McCarthy to her modest house , offered him iced_tea and then proceeded to describe her experience in the horrifying detail of first-hand experience . Davis was 8 years old in 1923 . Her father , forced to flee , left her and three of her siblings in the care of John and Mary Wright , a white family who saved many women and children . Mary Wright treated the young ones as if they were her own , feeding them , calming them . But the children panicked one day while left alone during the rampage and fled , taking refuge for a while in the swamps . &quot; This is a terrible story , &quot; Davis would say in a sworn statement in 1993 . &quot; It is the first time in my life that I see people with guns . . . . We all got_down on our bellies and crawled . I don ' t know how far we crawled on the stomach . We tried to keep people from seeing us through the bushes. &quot; Not only did Davis sign her rights over to O ' McCarthy the evening they met , but she also agreed to speak out_in any other forum necessary to win recompense . And she gave him what would turn_out to be another crucial lead : the phone_number of her cousin , Minnie Lee Langley . Langley was one of the few people still alive who had been in the Carrier house when Sylvester fought_back . Now O ' McCarthy had a human link to that pivotal part of the story , and one who like Davis was very willing to talk . By the time he was done interviewing Langley , he had &quot; a picture that was very concrete and very clear and at_the_same_time filled with conjecture , mystery , lies , deceit -- it had all_the things that we think_of in Southern history having to do with the races. &quot; All that remained was for him to somehow get the wheels of justice rolling , to get these women represented in a court of law and to get them a measure of justice they had so far been denied . Once again , O ' McCarthy ' s incessant networking on Rosewood paid_off . He wrangled an introduction to Steve Hanlon , a lawyer who was making a name for himself representing underdogs in high-profile cases at Holland &amp; Knight , Florida ' s largest law_firm and one of its most prestigious . When Hanlon agreed to represent Davis and Langley pro bono , it appeared for the first time that O ' McCarthy ' s crusade in behalf of the survivors -- and his movie -- wasn ' t just a pipe_dream . But there was one other thing : O ' McCarthy believed he ' d improve his film ' s chances of being made if its hero were white . Hanlon would have fit the bill . But O ' McCarthy had already decided to make himself the hero . He planned to model a character after himself , a white_knight out_to uncover the secret of Rosewood . * Arnett Doctor is angry . A stern and religious man with a gray goatee , a shaved , square head and a withering glare , he all but simmers in a perpetual state of rage . Perhaps it stands to reason . The 51-year-old retired Tampa businessman grew_up in the shadow of Rosewood -- his great-grandfather was Ed Goins , the second largest landowner in Rosewood and owner of a turpentine still that supplied up_to 50 jobs . Sylvester Carrier was his uncle , and Minnie Lee Langley his cousin . His mother , Philomena , was in the Carrier house the night of the attack , and her grandmother , Sarah , did not survive it . Although Doctor has done_well in life , he fumes about how much further ahead he would have been had Rosewood been left in peace . &quot; My great-grandfather was the major employer in Rosewood and his sons and his daughters were fairly well educated people , and then this atrocity occurred and bango ! My mother and her brother and her sister -- no education . My mother ' s generation was cut_off . All of a sudden my mother had to start scrubbing floors. &quot; Well before O ' McCarthy ever heard of the massacre , Doctor had had the idea that the &quot; Rosewood Family &quot; -- the survivors and their descendants -- should seek redress from the state of Florida . In 1985 , Doctor presented the notion at his family ' s annual reunion . &quot; I made an information packet and passed it out , &quot; he says . &quot; Most people threw it away. &quot; His own mother had made_it clear that she preferred her family not to mention Rosewood . She had been the one who ' d chased Gary Moore out of her yard . Doctor decided to honor her wishes as long as she was alive . She had been dead almost two years when Doctor first heard of O ' McCarthy in early 1993 . The producer was steadily trying to generate interest in his movie and the Rosewood issue , and he appeared with Langley and Davis on &quot; The Maury Povich Show. &quot; On national TV , O ' McCarthy did what comes naturally to a Hollywood producer -- he simplified the story . While he didn ' t exactly say that the two women with him were the sole survivors of the massacre , he implied that any others were scattered with the wind , their whereabouts unknown and unknowable . Langley and Davis , it was clear , were meant to be the beneficiaries of the legal case , and -- along with O ' McCarthy -- the stars of his film . Doctor ' s sister Yvonne fired off an angry letter to Cousin Lee Ruth , criticizing the &quot; lies &quot; that had been told_on the air . Playing_on the survivors ' old fears of white reprisals , she warned : &quot; You know Lee Ruth , we all have to be careful , because you never know to whom you ' re speaking and in fact , to whom they are acquainted . There is still alot ( sic ) of hate crimes being committed today. &quot; Doctor contacted Holland &amp; Knight after the telecast , demanding that his group be included in any legal_action . Doctor ' s Rosewood family would become the decisive majority in the legal machinations . Sometime later , Doctor and O ' McCarthy had a single telephone_conversation . Circling each other warily , they discussed the possibility of Doctor ' s group coming_into the movie deal . But the two men couldn ' t reach an agreement . As Doctor explained later , he had already written the producer off as someone out_to &quot; bamboozle &quot; the survivors and make a buck . While O ' McCarthy continued struggled to keep his movie on track , Doctor began to conduct his own negotiations with Hollywood . Slowly , O ' McCarthy was being frozen_out of a process he had set_in_motion . * Shortly after Hanlon met with Doctor , the Rosewood survivors ' legal strategy was set . They decided to get a bill introduced in the Legislature modeled after the federal act that had awarded reparations to Japanese Americans placed in World_War_II internment_camps . By early 1993 , the claims bill was ready to be filed . It asserted that state officials had known about the massacre yet did nothing to stop it , and it called_for erection of a memorial and for the payment of restitution to survivors and their children . But the sponsors missed a deadline for filing the bill . It would have to wait another year . Meanwhile , opposition to the idea of reparations was growing . It was all well and good to have considered reparations for two survivors , but where would it stop ? As the number of known survivors grew , opponents grumbled that restitution might bankrupt the state . And what about other historical injustices and other claims , from Seminole Indians , the descendants of lynching victims , and who knew what else ? All along , many north Florida whites had been quick to trivialize the violence as the work of &quot; rednecks &quot; who &quot; let booze get_the_best of them. &quot; Others repeated the stories handed_down by their parents -- that the trouble at Rosewood had been caused by armed blacks fighting a guerrilla war against stalwart whites . The claimants , it was said , were liars with dollar_signs in their eyes . Even those who believed the survivors ' side of the story weren ' t sure that payment was necessary : &quot; The people lost their land because they didn ' t maintain it and pay taxes , &quot; reasoned Robin Raftis . &quot; It was their choice not to come back. &quot; In the face of such contention , and under pressure to do something despite the bungled bill filing , Florida House Speaker Bolley L . Johnson in 1993 authorized a study to establish the details of the massacre and to determine what blame , if any , could rightly be laid on the state . As five historians opened their investigation , the age of those who could have witnessed or been involved in the event lent a sense of urgency to the task . Many of Gary Moore ' s original sources were dead and gone . Lee Ruth Davis had died in August of that year . The study team faced further difficulty when they approached Moore in hopes of gaining access to taped interviews now a decade old . Moore , who had been unable to get a book deal based on his research , reportedly demanded $ 10 # 000 in exchange for letting the government listen to his interviews . The investigators balked ; and Moore kept the tapes to himself . Nevertheless , the team soldiered on , talking to witnesses and studying contemporary accounts , finally confirming basic facts of the slaughter : that the alleged assault was the catalyst , that it was whites who started the killing . Various sources had put the number of people killed anywhere from seven to 200 . The study could find documented evidence of only eight deaths . It acknowledged , though , that the number could be higher . The report found that Rosewood may_not have been been a black heaven on earth , as some survivors have portrayed it , but it had been a stable community of 25 to 30 black families with three churches , a Masonic hall , a baseball_diamond and some businesses . Lives had indeed been saved by heroic efforts , including the actions of John and Mary White , and of white conductors who stopped a train that ran_through the swamp so that blacks hiding there could board it and be taken_to safety . The property the victims left_behind -- the land and belongings -- ended_up being acquired by some of the white landowners , including the Wrights . There was no evidence the blacks were ever compensated . Grisly murders and mutilations had certainly taken_place -- including the unprovoked killing of Minnie Lee Langley ' s crippled grandfather , James . During a lull in the shootout at the Carrier house , he had helped her and others escape into the swamp . He was later caught by the mob , taken_to the graves of his family members and shot to death , execution style . One thing that didn ' t hold_up was the often-told tale of Sylvester Carrier ' s survival . Langley claims to have heard his retreating laughter in the woods as she hid upstairs , and Arnett Doctor has always asserted that Sylvester survived into the 1960s , that he was spirited away from the carnage at the Carrier house in a coffin by black Masons . But the evidence turned_up by the state indicated that Sylvester was dead on the first_floor of the house when the mob finally took it . Most important , the study did lay a portion of the blame for the violence squarely on the state . Five days into the disturbance , before the town had been burned to the ground , Gov . Cary Hardee had considered calling_out the Florida National_Guard . Instead , he accepted the local sheriff ' s word that everything was under_control . Despite confirmed reports of deaths , and with a mob of between 200 and 300 armed white_men still roaming the countryside , Hardee went hunting . That inaction , said the study , allowed the steamrollering rampage to culminate in the total destruction of Rosewood . The report concluded : &quot; Rosewood was a tragedy of American democracy and the American legal system. &quot; * On the heels of the study , legislative sponsors last December sought $ 7 million in compensation for victims . The claims process provided just the forum O ' McCarthy had wanted . Before the Legislature could consider the bill , a government fact-finder , would hold hearings and then make a recommendation . The hearings , held late last winter , were extraordinary -- one by one , the elderly survivors told their stories . Minnie Lee Langley was among them , as was Wilson Hall , whose father had owned a sugar_cane mill , grist mill and smokehouse and operated a small store . After his family was forced to flee , Wilson , age 7 , was eventually reduced to scavenging on garbage_trucks . Opposing the claim were several whites whose fathers had been involved . They insisted that Hall , Langley and the others were lying . As in a court of law , Hanlon went head-to-head with Assistant Atty . Gen.James Peters on the issue of whether the state had a moral_obligation to compensate the victims . Although Chiles supported compensation , Peters questioned the thoroughness and accuracy of the study . He argued that even if the state had not taken proper action to halt the carnage , the events were too old for the current government to be held accountable . Ironically , his cause was aided by Gary Moore . It had been Moore ' s article that first publicly attached the word &quot; massacre &quot; to what happened in Rosewood . Now he appeared before the fact-finder , Richard Hixson , to bitterly blast the researchers ' findings . In his own writings , Moore had always emphasized the gaps in the available record , the distortions and myths that were propagated over the years by both blacks_and_whites . Since the appearance of his original story , he had become , if anything , more enamored of the notion that there was no knowable truth . It was in everybody ' s interest to embellish what happened , to say the town was more prosperous than it was , to exaggerate the number of deaths , to make this person or that more heroic than anyone possibly could have been . Only his tapes held the truth . And , since government researchers had not listened to the tapes , the bill under_consideration merely endorsed the myths of one Rosewood faction , he said . In the end , Hixson recommended payment , saying the state had a &quot; moral obligation. &quot; But he greatly scaled back the amount . In April , the bill passed the House 71-40 and the Senate 26-14 . The $ 2.1-million bill awards $ 150 # 000 for emotional trauma to each of four specifically named survivors -- Langley and Hall along with Arnett Goins and Willie Evans . Other survivors have until Dec . 31 to apply for compensation . In addition , money is being set_aside to compensate families who lost property and to fund scholarships for the descendants of victims . Relatives of the survivors cheered and hugged after the victory , even though the bill awarded much less than they had requested . In his comments after the bill passed , Doctor didn ' t mention O ' McCarthy at all . Just as the producer , in some of his statements to the press , had portrayed himself as a crusading white_knight , Doctor has implied that he , Arnett Doctor , had been the catalyst or that Lee Ruth had contacted Hanlon on_her_own . The producer had become the invisible man . While joyous Rosewood survivors and their supporters celebrated , O ' McCarthy , while pleased with the bill ' s passage , fumed over being left_out . &quot; I guess I was the wrong color , &quot; he says . * Rosewood , in the parlance of Hollywood , has become &quot; hot. &quot; Stories on the massacre and restitution have been featured on national television , in numerous newspaper_articles and in Esquire magazine . Suzanne DePasse , producer of &quot; Lonesome Dove , &quot; purchased an option on O ' McCarthy ' s rights and story package a year ago , but never went_into production with it . At press time , O ' McCarthy ' s agent at Creative Artists Agency was preparing to pitch it elsewhere . &quot; I ' ve put it into the hands of the two most powerful entities I know : God and CAA , &quot; says O ' McCarthy , who has been plugging_away on other TV and commercial projects with moderate success . At least two other Rosewood movies are said to be in development . After 71 years of bearing the burden and the pain of Rosewood alone and in obscurity , a handful of survivors has finally gotten recognition from the state and the world at_large that they suffered a great injustice , endured a terrible loss . But the depth of that loss , and the advanced age and health of the victims , makes the victory cause for muted celebration at best . For Minnie Lee , her years in Rosewood were a time of innocence , the last truly contented time of her life . She had planned to go_to school to become a nurse . Her grandmother , with whom she lived after her mother died in childbirth , was going_to help her . But after the massacre , her plans were derailed . She spent three or four days in the cold , swampy woods , staying out_of_sight of the gunmen . Her grandmother , Emma , who was slightly wounded in the siege on the house , got separated in the tumult . Langley was one of the lucky ones picked_up by the train conductors . She remembers them gently lifting her up into the stopped car . Of those who helped her toward the end of the ordeal , she says now , with a smile : &quot; Some of them were too good to be white. &quot; Word of the massacre had reached her relatives in Gainesville , 46 miles away , by the time the train arrived . She found them waiting at the station . She eventually was reunited with her grandmother , but Emma died within a year . Family members consider her an uncounted victim . Minnie Lee had to leave school to take a job . She worked most of her life in a brush factory . She cries , still , when she talks_about what happened . &quot; I ' ll tell you the truth : After what happened to my grandmother and my grandfather , it took my life , &quot; she says , &quot; because I loved them. &quot;</TEXT>
