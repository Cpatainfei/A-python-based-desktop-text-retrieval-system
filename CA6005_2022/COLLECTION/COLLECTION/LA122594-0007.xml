   <TEXT> Orhan Pamuk ' s braided mysteries coil around the story of a plodding husband who searches for his restless wife through Istanbul ' s serpentine streets and historical memory . Once it was the Ottoman Empire ' s Constantinople and before that , the Byzantine_Empire ' s , and long before that , the ancient_Greek Byzantium . For Pamuk , author of the warmly praised &quot; The White Castle , &quot; the city is a suffocating midden of 2 # 000 years of temporary victories and permanent defeat . Pamuk writes_of the defeat . His philosophical detective_story is , in fact , an evocation of the crippled consciousness and destructive reflexes of his fellow Turks : heirs of a traditional Eastern society , and engaged for three quarters of a century in a Westernizing project that still has not taken_root . &quot; In the land of the defeated and oppressed , to be is to be someone else , &quot; asserts one of the many figures -- at once enigmatic and hysterically overwrought -- whom the husband , Galip , encounters on his week-long quest . It is the underlying theme of a book of disguises and transformations . Personal identity is unattainable when a nation ' s identity has been lost , and in neither case -- so goes Pamuk ' s menacing comedy -- can it be recovered . Elaborated with a dizzying wealth of discursiveness , distraction and literary baiting and switching , it often bogs_down under its own abundance . It will dazzle and then , with an effect akin to snow-blindness , it goes indistinct . It disappears into its own virtuosity and reappears . It remains distant from the reader like someone who talks fast and well and doesn ' t look you in the eye , and suddenly , with disconcerting effect , looks you in the eye . It is a trying book and worth trying . Galip ' s quest is partly human and mostly allegorical . He is an undistinguished lawyer desperately in_love with Ruya , his long-haired , long-legged cousin and wife , who spends the day reading detective novels . We never see her and yet -- an example of Pamuk ' s gifted elusiveness -- she is vivid and oddly lovable . She vanishes suddenly , leaving a 19-word note in green ink . We are only told nine of the words -- an example of Pamuk ' s exasperating elusiveness -- but we are made to understand that she has gone_off with her half-brother Jelal , to whom she has always been attracted . Galip comically hides the disappearance from his family . When his aunt phones he makes footstep noises to signal that he has gone_to fetch her and found her asleep ; then he sets_off to try to track the pair down . So_much for the humanity , though it will return , movingly , at the end . In the quest , Ruya is all but lost sight of ; the real quarry is Jelal . He is as brilliant as Galip is obscure : Istanbul ' s most celebrated and controversial newspaper_columnist . Galip has always worshiped and envied him and lived_in his shadow . Even as children , when Galip and Ruya played hide-and-seek Ruya would never try to find him , but go_off instead to meet Jelal . The book proceeds by alternate chapters . One set tells of Galip ' s search ; the other contains Jelal ' s writings . Gradually the two converge ; finally Galip and Jelal will also converge . Eventually Galip will be living_in Jelal ' s apartment , wearing his pajamas , writing his columns and taking_over his lovers ' calls and his death threats . By this time the actual fate of Jelal and Ruya has dwindled . Eventually we will learn it and be touched when Galip momentarily comes_down to earth , as it were , and lets himself grieve . The Galip-Jelal quest is a wild , varied and sometimes stupefyingly arcane trip through Turkish history and culture , political battles , themes of individual and national alienation , portraits of extravagant and emblematic characters and beliefs , and Galip ' s own obsessions . He tramps the streets and neighborhoods of Istanbul as thoroughly as Leopold Bloom tramped Dublin ; stopping frequently to eat . Eating -- he buys from street stands and cafes and sticks_to the cheap traditional dishes -- is a way to assure himself that there is , in fact , a Turkish identity . There is a bravura chapter in which Jelal writes_of the Bosphorous drained , and sedimentary layers of history turning_up in the pestilential muck . There are the skeletons of galley-slaves chained to their boats , the skeletons of crusaders atop their skeleton horses , sackfuls of the Sultan ' s courtiers fallen_out of favor , strangled and ditched , an entire German battleship and a white Cadillac belonging_to a rich gangster . The gangster ' s skull and his girlfriend ' s are glued together in a kiss . Galip thinks for a moment of Ruya before returning to his intoxicating existential quest . Wandering through the city he visits two of Jelal ' s colleagues , each with his own mania . They question him fiercely , intrusively and outlandishly ; Galip is like Lewis Carroll ' s Alice undergoing impertinent questions from the_likes_of the Caterpillar and the Red Queen . He visits Ruya ' s first husband , an intellectual who has set himself against all foreign cultural influences and makes_a_point of living like a provincial middle-class Turk , with a doily over the TV and a dusty tray of cordials brought_out for visitors . He visits the premises of a failed mannequin artist who had insisted on portraying authentically Turkish figures -- bow-legged , short , mustached -- instead of the blond anonymous elegance required by Westernized commerce . He is shown wax models of those the artist despised -- writers and translators who import alien culture -- and those he admired -- police torturers whose careers suffered because they insisted on using traditional Turkish methods instead of newfangled methods brought_in from abroad . To be oneself , to reject outside influences : a national obsession that , for Pamuk , leads nowhere . He writes an allegory of a prince who sets his people an example by excluding anything that might dilute his own authenticity . He gets_rid_of his books ( though then , finding his mind empty , he brings a_few back ) . He gets_rid_of paintings , furniture , his wife . Not wishing to be influenced by memories , he banishes smells and music . Finally he dies in a room painted white ; its only furniture a white piano . His last words are : &quot; Nothing at all. &quot; Galip , however , illustrates an opposite national obsession . He wants only to be someone else ; he wants only to be the powerful and glamorous Jelal , free_of narrow Turkish prejudices and sought_out by foreign journalists and television teams as their sophisticated interlocutor . He wants above all to have the power that Jelal wields : to control the universe by writing_about it . By the end , he has to all intents and purposes become Jelal . As for the real Jelal : before a mysterious ambush that claims his and Ruya ' s lives , he has shown signs of abdicating his power and seeking something more authentic . What that will be , this intriguing , overnourished and maddeningly private attempt at a public novel , doesn ' t say . It is neither retreat into national solipsism nor dilution in a homogeneous world culture . All we have to hold_on to , at the end , is Galip remembering Ruya and the game they once played . They would try to describe what a day would be like when they reached the age of 73 . Now , alone , Galip lives_out that day in his imagination .</TEXT>
