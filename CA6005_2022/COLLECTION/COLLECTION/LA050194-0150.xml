   <HEADLINE> NASTY WAR ' S NASTY QUESTION : IS WEST BLINDED BY RELIGION ? ; MUSLIMS FEAR BIG POWERS WILL ACCEPT SLAUGHTER OF NON-CHRISTIANS IN BOSNIA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Are the major_powers , or at least some of them , more tolerant of genocide against a Muslim minority than they would be of the same against a Christian minority ? This suggestion , long whispered in connection with the slaughter of the Bosnian Muslims , is being spoken aloud since former President Richard Nixon included it in a book completed just before his death . It cannot be claimed , as the Muslim Public Affairs Council did two weeks ago , that the &quot; United Nations is effective only when it acts against Muslims. &quot; ( After the rape of Gorazde , the council called_on Muslim countries to withdraw from the United Nations. ) To mention the U.N. rescue of Muslim Somalia from famine and anarchy is to refute that claim , and other instances could be named . But Muslim distress over Bosnia is steadily rising . Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher faced an angry delegation of all six foreign_ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council last week , frustrated that their lobbying for bolder U.S. action has failed . In the United States , which has a relatively small Muslim population , there is virtually no history of major domestic problems involving this minority ; foreign conflict , such_as with the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein , has never been with Muslims as such . Bosnian leaders have occasionally named American religious pluralism as the reason that the United States has ended_up as the Bosnian Muslims ' least weak defender . Differing histories may be a better key . Virtually all_of Europe ' s historic victories were over Muslims . This is not to say that the greatest battles in European history were fought against Muslims . But on the rare occasions when Europeans were not fighting one another but were fighting as Europeans against a non-European enemy , that enemy was Muslim . Charles Martel stopping the Moors at Tours , France , in 732 ; Roland , slain fighting the Saracens in the Pyrenees ; El Cid , continuing the epic reconquest of Spain in the 11th Century ; John of Austria and his European armada destroying the Turkish fleet at Lepanto off the coast of Greece in 1571 ; Sobieski of Poland , stopping Muslims at the gates of Vienna in 1683 -- these are heroic names and fabled places that every European schoolchild memorizes . Do the memories matter in 1994 ? Do they bear_on relations between the_British and their Pakistani minority , the Germans and their Turks , the_French and their Algerians , the Spanish and their Moors , the Russians and their Central Asians ? And are Europeans likely to be affected by this broad cultural background as they view the Serb Christians fighting the Bosnian Muslims ? To the Serbs , their epic resistance against the Turks at Kosovo Polje in 1389 was as important for Christendom as was Tours , and the national epic that celebrates it is as immortal as the &quot; Chanson de Roland &quot; or &quot; El Poema del mio Cid. &quot; But the Serbian national epic has been generally ignored in the West and scarcely celebrated in Russia . In looking_at the continuing dithering of the West , many in the Muslim world see a rising question of whether a non-Christian minority is to be considered expendable . As this war drags_on , the question looms ever larger ; and the question in itself is of consequence . Christians and Muslims are fighting each other in disturbingly many places around the world , sometimes with words , sometimes with guns : Sudan , Lebanon , Armenia / Azerbaijan , Cyprus , Egypt , Pakistan and elsewhere . Some students of foreign affairs -- notably Samuel P . Huntington writing in Foreign Affairs last summer -- see the re-emergent Islam / Christendom line as a kind of new cold_war divide . If a new condition rather than a new superpower threatens world peace , that condition surely must be ( or include ) bloody intra-national competition among ethnic and religious groups . In that context , past history and present sociological reality in Europe make Bosnia seem a more fateful conflict than ever and one that may require the major_powers to examine themselves as closely as they do the combatants clashing in the Balkan hills .</TEXT>
