   <HEADLINE> STATE TO RECONSIDER MILK PRICE DECISION ; AGRICULTURE : CONSUMER GROUP CHALLENGES PRICING FORMULA . DAIRY_FARMERS DEFEND INCREASE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The state_Department of Food and Agriculture , in a rare move Thursday , reopened hearings on a year-old decision that has driven retail milk prices in California to their highest levels ever . Consumers Union , the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports , had requested the review , calling the state-imposed price increase a &quot; hidden_tax to consumers. &quot; It is the first time in memory the department has agreed to reconsider a pricing order . The department sets farm prices , which are what dairy_farmers charge processors for milk . Though retail prices are not regulated , changes in farm prices affect what consumers pay . In November , 1993 , at the urging of dairy_farmers , the department changed the formula it uses to calculate farm prices , boosting them by 15 cents a gallon . The department said a new formula was needed because half the state ' s 2 # 200 dairy_farmers weren ' t making enough money to cover production_costs . With the new formula in_effect , a state survey shows , the average retail price for a gallon of whole_milk hit $ 3.02 in the Los Angeles area in October , an all-time high . The amount is 14.3 % higher than in October , 1993 , when the average price was $ 2.64. Consumers Union wants the department to scrap the current formula and return to the old method of calculating milk prices , which was based in part on production_costs in California and consumer demand for milk . The current formula is linked to the price the federal_government sets for cheese in the Midwest . A return to the previous formula would lower farm prices by an estimated 12.5 cents a gallon , which translates to a reduction of about 25 cents retail . California ' s dairy_farmers have countered Consumers Union ' s request with one of_their_own . Arguing that farmers are not earning an adequate return , they are seeking an adjustment to the current formula that would boost farm prices by 1.6 cents a gallon . That translates into a retail price increase of about 3 cents a gallon . Under state rules , Food and Agriculture_Secretary Henry J . Voss must make a decision on the proposals within 62 days . There was no indication Thursday on how he might decide . The hearing again draws attention to the upward march of milk prices in the state at a time when there is a nationwide surplus of milk . Consumers Union argues that California has kept its milk prices &quot; artificially high , &quot; protecting dairy_farmers at the expense of consumers , especially the poor . The organization argues that the price hikes forced low-income families to allocate a bigger chunk of their food dollars to milk . Many physicians consider milk important to children ' s health , and there is no comparably priced substitute for it . Harry Snyder , co-director of the West Coast office of Consumers Union , said state-mandated prices have encouraged farmers to step_up milk production , though demand isn ' t growing . The surplus should be causing prices to fall , he said . Jay Goold , vice_president of Western United Dairymen in Modesto , said farmers need a price increase to help cover higher production_costs caused primarily by increased feed costs , a lingering result of last year ' s floods_in the Midwest . He attributed the increased production to more efficient farming methods that result in higher yields per cow . Goold said the impact of the Consumers Union proposal would be severe , putting farmers back to where they were more_than a year ago and possibly putting many of them out of business .</TEXT>
