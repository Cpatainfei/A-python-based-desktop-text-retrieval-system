   <HEADLINE> 2 AIRLINES HALT FLIGHTS , CITING SAFETY ISSUES ; TRAVEL : AMERICAN_EAGLE , KIWI SUSPEND SOME SERVICE DUE TO PILOT TRAINING CONCERNS . AND THE FAA PROBES SABOTAGE ABOARD 5 JUMBO JETS IN NEW YORK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two airlines suspended flights because of safety concerns Friday , and federal_officials said that a separate investigation was under way into five instances of sabotage aboard one company ' s jumbo jets at Kennedy International Airport -- all adding_to an increasingly nervous Christmas travel season . Some travel_agents reported passengers expressing fear and resistance to booking commuter flights in the wake of two crashes in six weeks that killed a total of 83 people . On Friday , American_Eagle grounded flights in Chicago serving 10 Midwestern cities as pilots demanded more training before taking_off in icy weather . Reservation agents sought to place travelers on other airlines . At Newark International Airport in New Jersey , Kiwi International Airlines voluntarily suspended most of its service Friday because of FAA questions about the carrier ' s pilot training records . The suspension will continue until Kiwi can persuade the FAA that its training meets government standards . The FAA did allow Kiwi ' s 6:10 p.m. flight to West Palm Beach , Fla. , to leave Newark after the crew proved it had the required training , said FAA regional administrator Arlene B . Feldman . Meanwhile , the FBI said that five Boeing 747 jets belonging_to Tower Air were sabotaged at New York ' s Kennedy International Airport in November . The sabotage wasn ' t subtle , and sources close to the investigation said the damage appeared to be the work of a disgruntled employee rather than terrorists . The damage was discovered after ground_crews received false readings from cockpit instruments during preflight checks . In each instance , wires were cut . At Chicago ' s O ' Hare International Airport , American_Eagle announced it was halting service until Jan . 4 between Chicago and the following cities : Champaign and Peoria , Ill. ; Ft . Wayne and South Bend , Ind. ; Columbus and Toledo , Ohio ; Lansing and Traverse City , Mich. ; and Green_Bay and Madison , Wis . American_Eagle also canceled some of its flights at Kennedy , starting Friday . The airline said it was acting after representatives of the Allied Pilots Assn . -- one of four unions representing pilots at American_Eagle -- questioned the level of cold_weather training that pilots recently assigned to Chicago and New York had received . The pilots were scheduled to fly Swedish-built Saab 340 aircraft after the FAA ordered French- and Italian-built ATR-42 and ATR-72 aircraft grounded during icy conditions . The FAA acted a month after an American_Eagle ATR-72 crashed on Oct . 31 in Indiana , killing all 68 on board . * On Tuesday , an American_Eagle Jetstream Super 31 crashed as it was approaching Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina , killing 15 people , although weather was not immediately suspected as a cause . American Airlines spokeswoman Mary Frances Fagan insisted Friday that the Saab 340 pilots -- who normally fly more southerly routes -- were amply trained for cold_weather . The airline hopes to resume service Jan . 4 with pilots from the three other unions , Fagan said , noting that &quot; the difference is that their union leadership has not raised the safety issue , &quot; Fagan said . APA President James G . Sovich said the majority of the pilots in his union have had no recent experience flying in winter weather . He said the only preparation management gave them was a 400-page insert in their flight manuals along with some information on how to navigate around O ' Hare -- all handed to them Wednesday night . However , the pilots neither &quot; requested nor demanded &quot; the flight suspensions , Overman said . The union did not think the airline needed to shut_down to address the pilots ' concerns , he said . &quot; We ' re not talking_about weeks of classroom instruction -- just something more thorough than what they received , &quot; he said . For passengers , it meant long lines Friday . Meanwhile , in Nashville , Tenn. , an American_Eagle Jetstream Super 31 commuter plane landed with one of two engines out Friday as it returned for maintenance following an emergency_landing in Knoxville , Tenn. , a day earlier . Mechanics could not determine why the engine went_out , said Don Bedwell , an American_Eagle spokesman . The plane was being flown to Nashville with just two crew_members aboard . The flight Thursday was carrying six passengers . In New Jersey , Kiwi ' s suspension disrupted service on routes linking Newark , Chicago , Atlanta , portions of Florida and Puerto Rico . The airline , which was started two years ago by former employees of Eastern , Pan Am and other carriers , said it hoped to resolve the dispute with the FAA shortly . &quot; We have never blown a tire , overshot a runway or scratched a plane in over 23 # 000 flights , &quot; said Bob Iverson , the company ' s chief_executive_officer in a fax that was sent to travel_agents . &quot; Our pilots average nearly 20 years of experience as commercial aircraft pilots and the 1 # 000 employee / owners of Kiwi stand behind their flying records. &quot; Tower Air , which serves Israel , South_America , Europe and India as well as portions of the United States , said its own personnel &quot; detected and corrected cut wires . . . in five instances during early November in which we suspect the cuts were deliberate. &quot; Sources said most of the wires were cut_in obvious places , in some instances disabling the planes ' in-flight entertainment systems . Two of the planes that suffered other damage were cargo aircraft . In one of the incidents , 19 wires were severed . Since discovery of the sabotage , security has been tightened and no further damage has been reported . The FAA , FBI and the Port Authority Police_Department , which has jurisdiction over Kennedy , are conducting a joint investigation . Goldman reported from New York , Beckham from Chicago .</TEXT>
