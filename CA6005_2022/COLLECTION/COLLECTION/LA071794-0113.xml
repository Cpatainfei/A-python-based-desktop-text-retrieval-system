   <HEADLINE> A MATTER OF HONESTY : BILL_CLINTON AND WHITEWATER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If anyone doubts that self-interest , not the national interest , is the coin of the realm in Washington , Whitewater is ample confirmation . It is the inevitable culmination of a quarter-century of hypocrisy , lying and posturing by Presidents , press and partisan hacks alike . This time , the result may be tragic : to take a seemingly insignificant series of questions that should have been settled in the 1992 campaign -- and turn them into the diminution and possible ruin of the first presidency in a generation to deal seriously with the nation ' s problems . On Whitewater , I have read far too_much and learned far too_little from the effort . But failing a whole new conspiracy unearthed by the special prosecutor or Congress or the press , Whitewater is not Watergate -- or anything like it . Bill_Clinton hasn ' t abused his presiden- tial authority , as Richard M . Nixon -- or even Ronald Reagan -- did . He has not promulgated illegal , unconstitutional schemes to bring_about desired political goals , judging from the facts thus far revealed . But the distinction may be meaningless in today ' s atmosphere of rabid partisanship and media stampede . The most significant fact known about Whitewater to date is that it occurred 15 years ago . Clinton , as President , is being prosecuted for his ethical standards as governor . Moreover , he is being judged wanting by members of a congressional political class who , in many cases , fed at the same statehouse troughs that he apparently fattened at and who , according to PAC reports , have continued their bottom-feeding on the Potomac . But it is Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton ' s own lack of candor that has ensured this sordid story is going_to go_on , and on . Congressional hearings begin on July 26 ; the special prosecutor will be at_work for at least another year . The Clintons ' truth trimming has guaranteed that the press and Congress will continue down predictable paths -- reducing the whole sorry business to a high-stakes game of liar ' s poker , where only the Clintons can lose . They are heading toward a credibility problem that , in today ' s talk-show nation , could achieve Nixonian and Johnsonian proportions . Worse , unlike Reagan , who had his own troubles with the truth , Clinton is now perceived as a less-than-strong leader . This is something quite apart from obstruction of justice , as practiced by Nixon and documented on his tapes , or the Iran-Contra cover-up . George Stephanopoulus sounding off at the Treasury_Department about the appointment of an official investigator who is an acknowledged political opponent of the President would seem , under the circumstances , reasonable . And , indeed , the special prosecutor reported June 30 that White_House aides had not acted illegally in their contacts with investigators . If Clinton has conspired with his aides to lie to grand_juries or pay_off colleagues for their silence ( &quot; I don ' t give a shit what you do . Lie , stonewall , whatever you have to do to get past the grand_jury , &quot; Nixon said into his microphones ) , the press has uncovered no shred of evidence . But the Clintons and this presidency have a special burden . Unlike Nixon , the Clintons came_to Washington riding the engine of political reform and change . Indeed , they have brought substantive change to the swamp of inertia and indifference that is Washington . But it is impossible to accomplish genuine political reform while practicing the same old tricks without bringing new values -- some might say spiritual or moral values -- to Washington . That was the promise of this Administration , that the breeze of truth -- about our politics , our national condition , ourselves -- would blow through the denial and pathology about America ' s difficulties . The &quot; new politics &quot; would be reality-based . For that to happen , our President could not be a part-time truth teller . He had to break the pattern of deception that for a generation has informed what passes for political debate in Washington : a pattern in which posture passes for principle , process is valued more highly than policy and the most urgent national business goes untended . Thus , for the Clinton presidency to succeed on the terms it aspired to office -- honesty about our problems and the means available for their solution , beginning with the country ' s economic health -- a new pattern of presidential candor had to be established , especially after Lyndon B . Johnson ' s falsehoods on Vietnam , Nixon ' s on Watergate , Reagan and George_Bush ' s disingenuousness on Iran-Contra and the arming of Iraq . The conundrum of the 1992 campaign was always that Clinton promised us the truth , and we bought the promise -- because he told the truth about almost everything except himself . His judgment was right that , ultimately , people cared less about the assertions of Gennifer Flowers than about health_care . But he was wrong to believe most people bought his self-serving answers to tough personal questions in the campaign ; any more_than most people are buying the Clintons ' tortured explanations about cattle futures and chicken lobbyists . Let ' s face it : The Clintons sleazed some back in Arkansas . It is time to fess up : To acknowledge the glaring conflicts_of_interest -- and whatever else untoward may have occurred . Clinton ran_for President under a new-age banner : The courage to change . The difficulty is that Clinton implicitly promised not only change for the country -- but change in himself . Perhaps that is why he is politically vulnerable in Whitewater : He appears not to have changed . The truth shaving , the lack of candor , that came_to be known as the &quot; character &quot; issue in the campaign are now attached_to his presidency . Surprisingly , the issue of candor -- and character -- now extends_to Hillary Clinton . Worse , the Administration ' s responses to its substantive failings and inconsistencies , to the differences between principle and practice from Bosnia to Haiti , are increasingly described in the same kind of defensive , half-truthful context as the Clintons ' answers on Whitewater . The Clinton presidency is in danger of becoming marginalized by temporizing . Clinton no longer commands the political high ground -- though , substantively , the facts and public_opinion remain on his side of the issues . ( &quot; When Whitewater hearings are televised , it will be Clinton ' s turn_in the bucket , &quot; Nixon told a trusted friend shortly before his death -- remembering that his own polls remained relatively high until the Watergate hearings. ) Today , Clinton is much less an inspiring presence in the thought life of the nation than in the days following his election or his masterful State of the Union -- even as his eloquence and daring in confronting some of the true problems of our civil society have become more apparent . His explanations of inconsistencies between his campaign rhetoric and policies -- on gays in the military , the abandonment of nominees when they got_into trouble , his waffling on campaign-finance reform -- all fit the same pattern as the Clintons ' answers on Whitewater . These are the old patterns of presidential prevarication , not the new politics he promised . Clinton ' s problems -- with the press , the Congress and the people -- are_due to a growing perception that we are in danger of moving_back to business-as-usual . I write this as a believer in the potential of the Clinton presidency . Clinton shifted the terms of debate , just as Reagan moved the terms of debate and reference roughly 180 degrees early in his tenure . Clinton is the best-informed President of our lifetime . Today , imaginative ideas are being discussed -- in Washington and the country -- to address national problems . Clinton is articulate , and clearly relishes the job and its opportunities . He has the political instincts to be a great leader . Moreover , like Reagan , he is prevailing : His basic economic program is being implemented . Some health-care reform will be accomplished , though in what form is still to be determined . As promised , he has undone 12 years of Reagan-Bush antipathy to abortion rights . He speaks sensibly and compassionately -- not in code -- about crime and family values and race . He was elected to change the country and the way things get done_in Washington , and his agenda still reflects the promise . But all this could disappear in the flotsam of Whitewater . If Clinton succumbs to that part of himself that plays fast with the truth , that doesn ' t inhale -- he is finished . If he thinks the lesson of the campaign is that he was helped by his equivocations , that he got_away with it -- on the draft , on his personal life -- he is courting disaster . The press will , inevitably , make this the central issue of his presidency -- regardless of all_the substance and programs . Clinton has been besieged by partisan enemies and thoughtless journalism since his tenure began . With some justification , he disdains the press . The press would be more interested in the truth if it were easier to obtain and did not require attention to context . Hence , the wild and loopy coverage in Whitewater . But the underlying questions raised in a handful of legitimate stories deserve honest , expeditious answers . Those haven ' t been forthcoming . Lying and dissembling , once the press pack is_on to it , is an easy story to cover -- and contributes mightily to the devastation of presidencies . Witness the final chapters of Johnson in Vietnam , of Watergate , Iran-Contra . The GOP and the press are_on the lookout for &quot; Slick Willie , &quot; and any time they sense his presence , the truthfulness of the President -- not the worthiness of his programs -- will become the issue . In electing Clinton , the country summoned the courage to change that he called_for . Now he must summon that same courage to change . The fate of his presidency may be at stake. *</TEXT>
