   <HEADLINE> BALTIC FERRY ROUTE RESUMES THOUGH MEMORY OF TRAGEDY HAUNTS NATION ; ESTONIA : PASSENGERS ON NEW VESSEL PAY RESPECTS AT SITE WHERE MORE THAN 800 DIED . VICTIMS ' FAMILIES CALL FIRM , GOVERNMENT CALLOUS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The customary dance_band was not aboard when the Mare Balticum left this port Friday night . Few of the fancy big ferry ' s 438 passengers and crew were in a mood for live music . Some clutched bouquets . They were sailing to a wake . Crossing the dark , frigid Baltic en route to Stockholm , Capt . Erich Moik planned one stop , around midnight , near the place where another ferry , the 15 # 500-ton Estonia , listed violently and plunged to the bottom on Sept . 28 in Europe ' s worst peacetime disaster at_sea . There , at the sound of a foghorn , the flowers were to be scattered to the waves . &quot; I will be thinking_of my friends as we pass_over them , &quot; said the captain , a gentle man with thick gray hair who stood erect on the bridge with both hands behind his back , gazing into a calm sea . &quot; I lost all my friends out there , &quot; he added softly . &quot; All my friends. &quot; Six weeks after its namesake vessel pulled_at least 885 people to their deaths , this tiny seafaring nation resumed the popular Tallinn-Stockholm passenger run Friday by launching the Mare Balticum , a slightly smaller luxury ferry refurbished with $ 3.8 million worth of new safety features . But the captain ' s sentiments , echoed by many aboard and many_more on shore , gave only a hint of the trauma his country feels -- and is just starting to come_to grips with -- in its fourth year of independence . Estonia ' s 1.6 million people , who had come_to think_of themselves as the most Western and progressive of former Soviet republics , feel not just grief for the 300 or so Estonians lost at_sea , but a shattering sense of relapse into the worst characteristics of their Communist past . For an aspiring annex of Scandinavia , a nation with the most vibrant economy and stablest currency among Moscow ' s former subjects , the disaster exposed painful inadequacies -- from questionable seamanship to the Soviet-style confusion , still unclarified , over exactly how many people left aboard the ferry that night . Most of the dead were from Sweden , a society many Estonians want to be like . Worse , the boat flew the country ' s flag and bore its name -- a reminder televised recently from a robot camera that panned the wreckage showing the enormous black_letters E-S-T-O-N-I-A . &quot; For years , foreigners will associate the word Estonia with a shipwreck , &quot; political analyst Riho Laanemae wrote in the Estonian Express . Estonians among the 136 survivors and those who lost loved ones complain of Soviet-like defensiveness , secrecy and callousness on the part of the state-owned Estonian Shipping Co . and government_agencies handling the disaster . The company monopolizes the Tallinn-Stockholm line through a joint_venture with Sweden called Estline . No Estline official attended the funeral of Andres Tammes , the crewman who sent the Estonia ' s Mayday signal and whose body was one of 94 recovered from the sea . His widow , Sigrid , is also bitter , because Estline paid just $ 40 for his funeral , less than half what it cost . &quot; All this worry about Estonia ' s image is just a way to avoid talking_about the real issues , &quot; she said . &quot; There should be more talk_about those who died and their families. &quot; Estonia is hardly equipped to deal with such a tragedy . Its social_welfare system is practically nonexistent , and few people have life_insurance . Estline has told people affected by the tragedy to apply for payments from the ship ' s Norwegian insurer , but they are slow to find legal help to do that or to file lawsuits . Only in late November will the government start paying compensation of $ 75 a month , from foreign donations , to each family that lost a breadwinner . A private agency started by an Estonian newspaper is now providing more modest relief , focusing_on the country ' s 60 orphaned children . &quot; In any case , we will support these people , &quot; said Mart Laar , who had been acting prime_minister until this month . &quot; The aid is not up_to Swedish standards , but far more_than in Soviet times , when no one would have helped us at all. &quot; Assistance has come from Finnish psychiatrists , who treat Estonians grieving for drowned loved ones . The Finns have challenged the Soviet emphasis on medication and the Estonian instinct for stoic suffering . They encourage people to vent their feelings . &quot; People are slowly overcoming the first stage of their grief , their disbelief , &quot; said Anti Liiv , an Estonian psychologist who shares the Finnish approach . &quot; Now they ' re entering a stage where they feel total hopelessness on the one hand , and hostility on the other . They want assurances that someone will be . . . crucified. &quot; With no official conclusion yet on the cause of the sinking , Estonians have embraced conspiracy theories : Russian sabotage , an overload of smuggled strategic metals , a bomb by one mafia gang to stop another ' s cargo . But Liiv said people increasingly blame the company . The Estonia was a roll-on , roll-off ferry , which allowed cars to enter at the stern and drive_off the bow . Since the accident , such ferries have been banned in the Baltic . Investigators say the ferry sank_in rough seas after its visor-like front hatch , weighing 54 tons , swung upward and broke_off , causing water to rush in , tip_over cars and destabilize the ferry . They hope to retrieve the hatch next week to learn whether it fell_off from faulty construction , metal fatigue or speeding by the captain , which would have multiplied the force of the waves . The new Tallinn-Stockholm ferry , taken from another Estline route , underwent modifications to weld the front hatch closed , widen the stern to add stability , improve the communication and fire safety systems and buy new life_jackets that light_up for night rescuers when they hit the water . Vironia , the original name of the ferry and an ancient name for this nation , was changed to Mare Balticum to disassociate it from the ill-fated ship . Before the Mare Balticum sailed Friday night , a retired teacher who was not taking the trip set flowers beside an unmarked , 20-foot white wooden cross that lies on a snowy knoll near Tallinn ' s port . There were dozens of other bouquets there , along with small candles burning in glass holders . She has gone_to that spot nearly every day since her 36-year-old daughter went_down with the Estonia . For many others , the makeshift memorial is sufficient : Let shipwreck victims stay buried at_sea . But the retired teacher comes_down on the other side of an emotional debate about whether Estonia , Sweden and Finland should spend the $ 70 million needed to raise the Estonia and the estimated 800 bodies entombed inside . &quot; Without a body , it ' s like there is no end to the tragedy , &quot; she said . &quot; Sometimes , I even imagine that she is , somehow , still alive down there. &quot; Michael Tarm , a Times special correspondent in Tallinn , contributed to this report .</TEXT>
