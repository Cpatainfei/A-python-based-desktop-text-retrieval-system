   <HEADLINE> BOSNIAN SERBS CHEER ARRIVAL OF 400 RUSSIAN PEACEKEEPERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hundreds of Bosnian Serbs cheered the arrival of 400 Russian peacekeepers Sunday , lining the streets of the rebel stronghold of Pale and offering gifts of food and slivovitz , a local brandy distilled from plums . The Russians were redeployed from peacekeeping duty in Croatia as part of an agreement brokered by Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Vitaly Churkin , the Kremlin ' s special envoy on the Balkan crisis . The Russian pledge to deploy the peacekeepers -- while urging the Serbs to withdraw their weapons from around Sarajevo -- gave Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic a way to pull_back without seeming to bend to NATO . However , some of the Russian troops who arrived in Serb-held areas of the capital on Sunday said they understood their assignment here to have been made on condition there would be no North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization air strikes . &quot; The compromise was worked_out so that if we Russians are here , there will be no need for air strikes , &quot; said Alexander Koznov , a chief warrant_officer and 20-year veteran of the Soviet and Russian armies . &quot; We are here because we are the only people the Serbs trust. &quot;</TEXT>
