   <TEXT> A festival featuring Chicano films kicks_off Friday at Oxnard College in what organizers hope will become an annual event . Their first attempt isn ' t a small one -- 15 films_over five days -- everything from the murals of Diego Rivera to documentaries on the United Farm_Workers to surveys of Aztec ruins . There ' s even a movie titled &quot; Low and Slow : The Art of Lowriding. &quot; James Vega , a vocational counselor at the college and festival organizer , defended the decision to mix a movie about a pop subculture together with more serious subjects . &quot; I think lowriding is a form of showing pride and we need young people to get involved in activities that show positive results like lowriding. &quot; The festival opens Friday with a locally produced docudrama about working conditions at a Somis flower ranch . &quot; Slave Case : USA &quot; is a 10-minute work-in-progress about the mistreatment of hundreds of Latinos that led to slavery charges against ranch owner Edwin M . Ives in 1990 . &quot; The film contains re-enactments of the process by which the workers were smuggled here and the conditions they worked in , surrounded by barbed wire and subjected_to psychological abuse , &quot; said Vega , who is a co-producer of the film . Slavery charges were dropped as part of a plea bargain in which Ives pleaded guilty to corporate racketeering . He agreed to pay $ 1.5 million in back wages to 300 former workers , the stiffest fine ever levied in a U.S. immigration case . &quot; We had a tremendous response when we debuted the film at Ventura College on Nov . 4 , &quot; Vega said . &quot; We ' re expecting a big crowd Friday. &quot; &quot; Slave Case &quot; screens at 6 p.m. in building LA-6 . The rest of the festival continues Monday through Thursday . For more information call 646-2875 . * If 15 Spanish language or Chicano films aren ' t enough , you can visit the Santa Barbara International Film Festival , also starting Friday and running_through March 13 . On Tuesday the festival features &quot; El Lado Oscuro del Corazon , &quot; an Argentine film . On the following Friday , the Santa Barbara festival is featuring &quot; Cronos , &quot; a Mexican vampire movie , and on Saturday the world_premiere of &quot; ...and the earth did not swallow him , &quot; a film based on the life of Chicano writer Tomas Rivera .
