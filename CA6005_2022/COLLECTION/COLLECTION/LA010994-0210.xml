   <HEADLINE> GREETINGS FROM LOVELINESSLAND ; A LOOK_AT THE LATEST TREATMENTS -- KITTY LITTER FACIALS , AND POLISHINGS AND AROMA TANNING -- REVEALS THAT MORE IS MORE IN THE BEAUTY BIZ</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So the Southern California real_estate market is in the toilet , we ' ve lost Star Wars , and the B-2 bomber and the C-17 are hanging by a thread . Relax , we ' ve still got the beauty biz . The Cold_War may be over , but there ' s no truce in the war against clogged pores , drab hair and chipped polish . Take my beauty regimen -- please . I used to get my hair cut at a funky little shop around the corner from my house . Now I go_to the largest salon in California : Umberto , a 12 # 000-square-foot Beverly Hills shrine , complete with a cappuccino bar and costume jewelry boutique , where in addition to offering the usual cuts , color , perms , manicures , pedicures and facials , they will bleach a woman ' s arm hair or wax a man ' s ears . For this extravagance , I blame my mother , the Manhattan Beauty Maven . When I decided to cut_off my long hair , she gave me Umberto ' s name . For under three figures , he gave me a cut so sensational that even my notoriously frugal husband urged me to return . Not that I needed much prodding . Visiting le grand salon is like going_to an opulent theme park -- LovelinessLand ! -- where any physical imperfection can be repaired and the raison d ' etre is to pamper me . The sheer excess is mind-boggling ; from the faux Pompeian frescoes over the reception_desk to trompe l ' oeil wood beams on the shampoo room ' s ceiling . Sixty-five hairdressers , five colorists , 14 manicurists , three facialists , five makeup artists and a scalp-treatment specialist are all decked_out in the beauty version of Mickey and Goofy costumes -- black , avant-garde ensembles straight out of Elle or Details . They perform magical transformations in 18 rooms , five private suites and endless nooks_and_crannies . I am given to understand ( from a press_release ) that my fellow pilgrims include Madonna , Shannen Doherty , Janet Jackson , Cher , Sylvester Stallone , Sharon Stone and Winona Ryder . &quot; I figure we have around 600 clients a day , five days a week , who spend an average of $ 100 , &quot; said Babette Beja , salon manager . I figure it ' s more_than that , since the shop has sly ways of getting you to spend money . For instance , if an assistant graciously offers you a Diet Coke and you gratefully accept , it later appears on your bill . When my hair was still long , a stylist put it up in a spectacular chignon . I was charged $ 1.50 for every fancy bobby_pin she used ( luckily , I passed_on the $ 79jeweled chopsticks in the boutique ) . And , of course , each operator favors a different miracle hair glop , and the salon carries them all . Retail glop sales alone probably cover the monthly rent . &quot; Soon a woman will be able to walk_out with a fantastic pasta primavera for six to take_home for dinner , &quot; promises the courtly Umberto , who is installing a &quot; tutto Italiano &quot; kitchen next door to his salon . If this seems excessive , over at 2 Rodeo , Jose Eber and his partner , the oh-so-fabulously-French Laurent Dufourg , have spent more_than a_million dollars on a 10 # 000-square-foot neo-Rococo temple which is open seven days a week . PERHAPS MORE IS MORE IN THE BEAUTY BIZ BECAUSE THERE ' S SO_MUCH competition . In Beverly Hills ' 1.2-mile golden triangle between Wilshire , Santa Monica and Robertson boulevards , there are more_than 208 licensed hair , skin and body-beautifying businesses . And Beverly Hills has no monopoly ; beauty transcends social , cultural and economic boundaries . In 1992 , Southern California ' s resources included 51 # 588 manicurists , 1 # 434 electrologists , 5 # 392 cosmeticians and 112 # 816 cosmetologists ( this includes hairdressers ) -- more_than 10 % of the national total pampering less than 5 % of the nation ' s population . Salons in Los Angeles County made more_than $ 100 million in hair and nail care alone . Nationally , salon services were projected to gross $ 35.5 billion last year with $ 4.5 billion coming from nails alone . And to think I went_to college instead of beauty school . The business is not entirely recession proof , according to another Beverly Hills hair-meister . &quot; Clients don ' t come_in every third week like they used to , &quot; said Giuseppe Franco , whose press kit , with winning understatement , bills him as &quot; the most famous hairdresser in the world. &quot; &quot; They make their color last until the last second . When they have black roots and blond hair , then they come. &quot; Why not skip it entirely ? &quot; If you want to live_in L.A. , you have to keep_up the image. &quot; &quot; In boom times , a salon owner could open 15 or 20 locations , &quot; said Mary Atherton , editor of Modern Salon , a glossy , Illinois-based magazine with articles like &quot; How To Pitch Perms to a Reluctant Client. &quot; &quot; But now rents are prohibitive . And a lot of people are deciding to make the one salon that they have truly spectacular . To survive , you have to have as_many people as possible come_through the door . So you add more services. &quot; There are certainly enough to choose from : body sugaring ( a variation on waxing ) , sports pedicures , thermal seaweed wraps , scalp facials , full body mud masques and watsu massage , a form of shiatsu performed in a swimming_pool that is supposed to make you feel_like you returned to the womb ( how would you know ? ) . My vote for most eccentric is Nail Art ( whose patron_saint , according to the remarkably thick and informative Nails magazine , is Olympic track_star Florence Griffith Joyner ) . For $ 30 , a nail artist will paint Elvis , or your grandchild , or a scene from &quot; Star Trek &quot; on your nail . Then there ' s aromatherapy , which , depending_on your olfactory_nerves , is the greatest healing force or biggest gimmick of the ' 90s . Proponents claim that a whiff of oils -- mimosa , patchouli , peppermint , rose -- can do everything from opening the heart chakra to sharpening the wits to aiding sleep . A person wishing to inhale her way to greater health and happiness can indulge in aromatherapy facials , massages , pedicures , scalp treatments , even Aroma Tanning , where you lie on an air-cooled UV bed and are basted with lavender . &quot; The body responds to scent without any intellectual barriers , &quot; said Susan Dworski , export manager for Aroma Vera , which claims to be the nation ' s largest manufacturer of essential-oil-based products . Last year , the L.A. company sold 660 pounds of lavender , 1 # 100 pounds of eucalyptus , 660 pounds of ylang-ylang , and a ton of petit grain , an oil obtained from the bitter_orange_tree . They have yet to market the smell of money , though perhaps they should . She told me the Las Vegas Hilton recently pumped a blend of essential_oils into the slot_machine area of the casino . Fragrant one-armed_bandits collected 45 % more . But who am I to judge what ' s beneficial ? Recently , I indulged in a &quot; Salt Glo &quot; treatment at Burke Williams , a lavish day spa in Santa Monica . I was nonplussed when Frank , a hunk with a towel around his waist , led me to a &quot; wet room , &quot; a large shower with a massage table . He instructed me to lie face down , stark_naked , with just a teensy towel for modesty , then tossed sea salt on me as if I were an icy driveway . &quot; The Egyptians called this aura polishing , &quot; Frank explained as he scraped my hull . He claimed to be exfoliating and detoxifying , two of the many beauty verbs I view with suspicion . Whatever , it was fun . &quot; You would n ' t believe the people I ' ve salted , &quot; Frank said as he turned_on the shower to rinse me off . When pressed for specifics , he named cast members of &quot; Sister Act II. &quot; Name dropping is rarely accidental . Salons boast of movie_star patronage the way English businesses flaunt the Royal Warrant ( By Appointment to Her Majesty , etc. ) . Almost every establishment I visited offered me a list of celebrity clients , all_the while insisting that they provide complete discretion . Franco has even decorated his Beverly Hills salon with huge photos of clients such_as Tony Curtis and Iman that were taken by &quot; my childhood friend and business partner , Mickey Rourke. &quot; But he assured me , with a straight_face , &quot; I don ' t brag about them . You know how many TV_shows don ' t accept me unless I go_on and gossip ? I lose a show a month . I ' ve done Montel Williams , Vicki Lawrence , this is my fifth time . But I don ' t say , ' So and so ' s hair is so thin. ' So I can ' t do ' Arsenio ' and ' A Current Affair. ' &quot; ( Not to worry . Barbra Streisand is also a client . And look where her former hairdresser , Jon Peters , wound up. ) The Beauty Barons don ' t just do stars , they are stars , who endlessly promote with books , talk_shows and infomercials . Superstylist Jose Eber got his big break when he created Farrah Fawcett ' s widely copied shag in the late ' 70s . Today , his star client is Elizabeth Taylor but not , as the tabloids recently suggested , Sugar , Taylor ' s Maltese . &quot; You know how that got started ? &quot; Eber laughed . &quot; We were shooting a commercial . Elizabeth was_on camera and she asked , ' How ' s Sugar ' s hair ? ' I said , ' It looks fine. ' Maybe I took the brush and ran_through it . But I didn ' t tease . Sugar isn ' t coming_to me on a monthly basis. &quot; Just give her time . &quot; The one thing women are looking_for is to feel good about themselves , to like what they see , &quot; said Eber . &quot; I make them feel good and that gives them great confidence . that ' s what it ' s all about , the beauty business . It ' s not as superficial as people think. &quot; Barbara Cadow , a USC psychology instructor , agreed . &quot; It ' s actually a cheap way to do therapy , &quot; she said . &quot; Women have a constant complaint : They ' re not getting attention from the men in their life . They go have a facial , have a massage , get their hair colored . In the excitement of having someone pay_attention to you , gushing over you , you feel better . It ' s all about taking_care of yourself. &quot; Does anyone really need this much care ? Recently , I drove to Encino for a 90-minute Royal Pedicure at A Place For You , a nail tabernacle so clean they could perform surgery on the floor . ( According to Nails magazine , sanitation is a big selling point because it ' s the only way posh salons can compete with the discount shops. ) Donna Marone , the manicurist , or as Nails prefers , the nail technician , installed me on an elevated throne in the &quot; Pedicure Palace &quot; and did everything to my toes except play this little piggy goes_to market . But after a seaweed sloughing treatment , reflexology massage and hot paraffin_wax mask , I was homicidal from inactivity . I was proud_of my crimson toes , for at least five minutes . Then I went_to a market in thongs and was run_over by a faulty cart . Time for a retouch ? &quot; PEOPLE NEED A PLACE TO GO TO HEAL FROM THE TROUBLED WORLD AND the salon has become that place , &quot; said Jody Byrne , president of Trends and Sources International , an Ohio company that forecasts beauty trends . &quot; I looked_up the definition of a sacred place and it ' s one where a prescribed ritual transforms an individual . that ' s what the day spa movement is all about. &quot; Striking a less spiritual chord , she noted : &quot; Baby_Boomers are hitting middle_age . They have the most money and at_the_same_time , their body is going south at the fastest rate. &quot; Another expert blames our obsession with appearance on evolution . &quot; Go_down to the L.A. Zoo and watch the gorillas , &quot; said Norman Freed , a psychologist who specializes in the beauty industry . &quot; Gorillas use grooming for bonding , as an opportunity for interfacing , and as an opportunity to settle disputes. &quot; Perhaps this explains why beauty has become such a popular social_activity . Friends who used to go_to lunch and a movie now hang_out at the day spa . Mothers and daughters have warm fuzzy memories of shared facials . Just ask Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea , who allegedly ( wink / nudge : I have sworn not to reveal my sources ) get their pores steamed at Georgette Klinger Inc. , a national chain of tony salons . &quot; People have such hectic lives . To have a place you can relax , where no one can call you -- that ' s important , &quot; said president Kathryn Klinger , who had her first facial when she was 11 and grew_up playing with her mother ' s products . She estimates her average customer spends $ 100 a visit . &quot; Of course , we have clients who spend $ 20 # 000 a year , who come_with their entire families every single week. &quot; In exchange , they get a sense of physical , if not fiscal , control . The morning before my $ 68 &quot; basic facial &quot; I awoke with an enormous blemish . &quot; I give your pimple special treatment , &quot; promised Miss Faina , the Russian aesthetician at Georgette Klinger on Rodeo , dabbing a camphor mask on the spot . While it was drying , I asked how beauty services in L.A. compared to those in the former Soviet_Union . &quot; Women there have facials all_the time , &quot; she said . An hour later , my skin was practically healed and radiant . However , if I wanted to keep it that way , Miss Faina recommended that I invest in a half-dozen products ( average price , $ 22 each ) and a monthly Line Essential Facial ( $ 98 for my &quot; older skin &quot; ) . I was reminded of a soothsayer I once met in El Retiro , Madrid ' s version of Central_Park . She told me that there was a curse on me , then offered to remove it for $ 5 . I often thought_about that soothsayer during my tour of LovelinessLand . The curse on me varied from blond eyelashes to chapped hands to bitten fingernails . But a solution could always be found if I crossed a palm with cash . Not all_of these solutions are expensive , but they are habit forming . Start with a simple manicure , hair cut and occasional facial , and pretty soon your schedule is overrun_with lash tints , highlights , low lights , fiberglass nail overlays , hair relaxers and whatever else is written_up in this month ' s issue of Allure . Many of these techniques work , so it ' s hard to know where to draw_the_line . Technology has finally caught_up_with vanity . A woman can now buy a perfect set of sculpted unpolished nails , waist-length hair extensions , or smoother skin in one hour , thanks to a glycolic_acid peel . And that ' s not counting the shopping list available through plastic_surgery . Speaking of which , I went_to Christophe ( the salon that rushed to President Clinton ' s rescue on the LAX runway ) for a non-surgical Electro-Myopulse face-lift . A soft-spoken woman in a turban named Ram Prakash ( which in the Sikh spiritual language means rejuvenator of Farrah Fawcett , I mean , Radiance of God ) handed me a mirror and asked a daunting question , &quot; Which side of your face is showing the most signs of_age ? &quot; I reluctantly guessed the left . &quot; I would have said the right , &quot; said Prakash , pointing_out lines , wrinkles and folds that I naively had attributed to lack of sleep . I lay_down and she ran her magic cell-rejuvenating wand over the left side of my face . Supposedly the electrical current was opening the meridians in my face , like acupuncture . I felt nothing but a tingling sensation and mounting skepticism . Then she handed me a mirror . To my astonishment , the treated side was an inch higher . &quot; You are going_to do the other side ? &quot; I asked nervously . An hour later , I beheld a face I hadn ' t seen in several years . Prakash said the $ 45 treatment would last anywhere from an hour to a week . &quot; It takes a_few treatments before your face sticks , &quot; she explained . My husband ' s reaction ? &quot; Honey , you look_like you ' ve been sandblasted. &quot; But a girlfriend was impressed . The results lasted three days and I ' m longing for a pick-me-up . But I am trying to remain strong . Meanwhile , I have plenty of stuff to try at_home . Prakash recommended that I bathe in four cups of cider_vinegar and water , which will leave my skin as smooth as a baby ' s bottom ( the universal benchmark for softness ) . I ' m afraid I ' ll smell like an Easter_egg . Then again , at least I ' ve heard of vinegar . Reading a list of product ingredients these days requires an advanced degree in alchemy . A random_sampling of cosmetic ingredients includes : DNA extracted from salmon milt , cactine , silk amino_acids , salicylic_acid from willow bark , blackthorn oil , hydrolyzed human hair keratin protein , frozen seaweed extract and St . John ' s wort oil . &quot; What ' s exotic about wort oil ? It ' s used for topical healing , &quot; said Jane Kennedy , owner of Palmetto , a Santa Monica boutique overflowing with virtually every fragrant soap , cream and holistic skin-care line on the planet . &quot; Exotic to me would be some unbelievable oils with East Indian attars of sunflower and gardenia and night-blooming jasmine . Not common calendula or mallow. &quot; Even further out there was Riquette Hofstein , a Beverly Hills aesthetician whose biggest claim to fame is that she ' s demonstrated her kitchen cosmetics on David Letterman ' s show 17 times . &quot; I teach people how they can take everything they eat and drink and turn it into beauty products , &quot; Hofstein said . &quot; Did you know that you can put a pound of kitty litter in the blender -- before kitty gets_to it , of course -- and add water and apply it as a mask on your face ? &quot; And then there was her recipe for canker sores : &quot; Drink urine . Heal the body with its own astringent. &quot; Pass the salmon milt DNA , please . Alas , while the lords and ladies of LovelinessLand can make you gorgeous and give you confidence , it ' s dangerous to get too dependent . The gods must have known I was researching this article because my beauty karma has gone_out of whack . Umberto decided to give me a new look and got a wee bit scissors happy . Friends who formerly regarded my hair with envy now look_at me with transparent Schadenfreude and utter four of the saddest words in the_English language : &quot; It will grow back. &quot; To make matters worse , I went_to a neighborhood shop and had my blond eyebrows tinted with vegetable dye . They turned_out a garish brownish black . Meanwhile , my over-cleansed skin is breaking_out from one too many miracle preparations . And I reek of lavender . I ' m taking this all as a sign that I must quit dwelling_on my appearance and focus_on a more spiritually fulfilling endeavor . And I will . I promise . Just as soon as that woman in the turban gives me one more face-lift .</TEXT>
