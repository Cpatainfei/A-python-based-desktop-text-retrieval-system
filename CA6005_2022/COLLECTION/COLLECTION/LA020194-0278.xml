   <HEADLINE> SCIENCE CALENDAR : QUAKE CLEANUP POSES LUNG HAZARD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The fallout from the Jan . 17 earthquake poses special hazards to individuals with respiratory problems , according to the American Lung Assn . Stress can trigger asthma_attacks , particularly in children , and the dust particles in the air can aggravate respiratory problems . Residents and volunteers involved in cleanup may be exposed to ashes , dust and other particulates . The group suggests the following guidelines : * Individuals with lung or heart problems should avoid cleaning_up where dust or soot is evident . * When cleaning a dusty or sooty area , thoroughly wet the area before clean-up and wear a dust mask . * If asbestos or other hazardous materials are present , do not attempt to clean the area . Only licensed individuals with training in asbestos removal should be involved . The Lung Assn . can provide a list of qualified asbestos contractors and consultants .
