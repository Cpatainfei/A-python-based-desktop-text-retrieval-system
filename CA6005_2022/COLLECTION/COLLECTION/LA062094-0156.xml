   <HEADLINE> SIMPSON CASE COMPELS NATION TO LOOK_AT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> First came Betty Ford , who spoke_of alcoholism and drug_abuse , breast_cancer and radical_mastectomies . Then there was Rock Hudson , whose 1985 death landed AIDS on Page 1 . Anita Hill was next , our professor on sexual_harassment , how complicated it is and how little acknowledged . And now there is the case of O.J. Simpson . As he sits under suicide watch in a tiny Los Angeles jail_cell , charged with the murder of his ex-wife , Nicole Brown Simpson , and her friend , Ronald Lyle Goldman , the football star turned commentator joins the pantheon of famous -- if sometimes unwilling -- professors on delicate subjects , this time domestic violence . From newspapers to talk_shows , offices to neighborhood bars , domestic violence was the issue of the week after a double murder and a celebrity arrest . Although 4 million women suffered some form of battering by husband or lover in 1993 , it is this woman , Nicole Brown Simpson , and this man , Orenthal James Simpson , who have made us talk_about it . &quot; As the story evolves , I think all_of us are going_to get educated on domestic violence , &quot; said Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala , on the Sunday morning talk_show &quot; Face the Nation. &quot; &quot; It ' s our dirty little secret . This is the leading cause of injury among women in our society. &quot; The investigation of Nicole Simpson ' s slaying has brought_to light her long and turbulent relationship with Simpson -- one that is now being deconstructed nationwide . There are police reports , a 1989 conviction for spousal battery , interviews with neighbors , a desperate letter read on national television . To a country that does not face its problems until forced to take_stock by dramatic_events , this latest primer in human behavior is a stark and painful unveiling of yet another former taboo subject . &quot; For the past seven years , the surgeon_general has been telling us that domestic violence is a leading cause of injury to women in this country , &quot; said Stacey Kabat , of the Boston-based group Battered Women Fighting Back and a co-producer of the 1993 Academy Award-winning film &quot; Defending Our Lives. &quot; &quot; Hey everybody , this is nothing new. &quot; That is just the point made by Dr. Alvin Poussaint of the Harvard Medical_School on &quot; Face the Nation &quot; Sunday morning . As with_child abuse in the 1960s , he said , this country has ignored domestic violence because it is a &quot; family affair , &quot; largely played_out on a very private stage . O.J. Simpson told police just that on New Year ' s Day in 1989 , when he beat , punched and kicked his wife so severely that she required treatment at a hospital . He later pleaded no contest to misdemeanor spousal battery charges , served no jail time and was allowed to be treated by a psychiatrist of his choice over the phone rather than undergoing a yearlong counseling program . &quot; The police have been out here eight times before , and now you ' re going to arrest me for this ? &quot; Simpson yelled that night to two police_officers responding to a 911 call , according to documents released by the city . &quot; This is a family matter , why do you want to make a big deal_out of it when we can handle it. &quot; Five years later , Simpson had not changed his mind . In a letter written Friday and read by a friend on national television while he was running from police , Simpson said he &quot; took the heat New Year ' s 1989 because that ' s what I was supposed to do . I did not plead no contest for any other reason but to protect our privacy. &quot; To psychotherapist Ellen Ledley , who specializes in domestic violence issues , that comment shows Simpson ' s complete denial that any problem existed in his marriage . &quot; The problem with most men who batter is that they use denial , avoidance , minimizing , that it ' s just between us. &quot; In the letter , which was written Friday just before he fled from police and began &quot; To whom it may concern , &quot; Simpson also said he felt &quot; like a battered husband or boyfriend , &quot; and that what he and his wife went_through was &quot; no more_than every long-term relationship experiences. &quot; Domestic violence counselors report that most batterers do feel victimized , that somehow they are the ones suffering abuse and that by their actions they are getting_back at their wife or partner . &quot; The letter was so confused , &quot; Ledley said . &quot; It had a really deranged feel to it . He ' s denying ( the abuse ) on one hand and proving it on the other by everything he says. &quot; What makes those who counsel battered women most angry about the Simpson domestic violence case are the breaks that they say O.J. Simpson received because of his celebrity . But they are the first to admit that less famous sometimes men get_off easy in a system that often does not protect battered women . &quot; If you live_in a nice area , if you have social_status , are a doctor , a lawyer , a politician , that helps you get preferential treatment , &quot; said Ellen Okamoto , community education coordinator for the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women . &quot; On the other hand , if you have a criminal_record or your neighborhood isn ' t so nice . . . it ' s more likely you won ' t get treated as well . You may go_to jail for a_few hours . Still it ' s not pursued either way. &quot; Although men are by no means immune to the most extreme act of domestic violence -- murder -- women are far more likely to be killed by someone they love . Figures from the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence in Washington show that among murder victims in 1993 , women were four times as likely as men to be killed by spouses or other partners . Los Angeles County Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti contends that one woman is killed in Los Angeles County every nine days in an episode of domestic violence . &quot; I want to focus_on the issue of domestic violence , &quot; said Garcetti , who has made the rounds of television talk_shows to discuss spousal abuse and the Simpson case . &quot; Our goal is to stop the violence . . . . It should not matter if the batterer is a celebrity or Joe Jones from down the street. &quot; The most lethal time in any abusive relationship is when the battered partner , usually the woman , decides to leave . &quot; In terms of being murdered , that is the time at which they are particularly vulnerable , when they say , ' I ' ve had enough of this garbage , ' &quot; said William Samek , a Miami psychologist who is director of the Florida Sexual Abuse Treatment Program . These are the lessons that O.J. Simpson is teaching the nation this week : Why men abuse and why women stay , and why it hurts so_much to everyone involved in an abusive relationship . He is in good company , for most such difficult lessons these days are not learned without celebrity assistance . Nice people didn ' t use drugs until Betty Ford said they did . She knew firsthand ; she was hospitalized in 1978 for a dependency so serious that it &quot; was really sort of miraculous that I survived it , &quot; she later said . Ford also went_to great lengths to publicize the threat of breast_cancer after her radical_mastectomy in 1974 . &quot; Betty Ford got cancer , and everyone went_out and got mammograms , &quot; said filmmaker Margaret Lazarus , a veteran of women ' s causes and a co-producer of &quot; Defending our Lives. &quot; AIDS wasn ' t an &quot; epidemic &quot; until Rock Hudson died . Sexual harassment only happened to &quot; other people &quot; until Anita Hill accused Judge Clarence Thomas of it after he was nominated for the Supreme Court in 1991 , Lazarus says . &quot; We are about to witness a national debate about how seriously we take cases of sexual_harassment in 1991 , &quot; said Susan Estrich , a USC law professor , as the Hill-Thomas case unfolded . But sometimes celebrity lessons backfire . Consider Mike Tyson , now serving a prison sentence in the 1991 rape of Desiree Washington , a Miss Black America contestant . Okamoto , of the Commission on Assaults Against Women , spends a lot of time teaching high_school students about rape , what it is and what it isn ' t . Most students understand -- until the Tyson case comes_up . &quot; They say , ' Mike Tyson and Desiree , well , she invited him in , ' &quot; Okamoto recounts . &quot; You ' re taking_down a hero , and that ' s big time. &quot;</TEXT>
