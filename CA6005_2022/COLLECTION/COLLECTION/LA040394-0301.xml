   <HEADLINE> TWISTING TRAIL OF GUN THAT CHANGED MEXICO ' S HISTORY ; FIREARMS : BRAZILIAN-MADE REVOLVER BEGAN AS A LEGAL WEAPON , THEN VANISHED UNTIL IT CLAIMED CANDIDATE ' S LIFE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like almost every_other American firearm used in a crime , the gun that changed Mexican history started_out on the right side of the law . Manufactured nearly two decades ago in Brazil , the . 38-caliber Taurus that killed presidential front-runner Luis Donaldo Colosio originally was offered for_sale at the Bob Chow Gun Shop in San Francisco -- a store then owned by a world-class marksman who once competed for the U.S. Olympic shooting team . The revolver was first purchased in 1977 by a Bay Area security executive who objected to supplying his unskilled guards with guns , but reluctantly agreed to buy this one after a client with a vault full of valuables insisted on an armed patrol . Three years later , the company and its assets were sold to Stanley Smith Security , a huge Texas-based conglomerate . But between 1980 , when Stanley Smith presumably acquired the gun , and March 23 , when an assailant in Tijuana fired it at Colosio ' s head , there are no records of where it traveled , of how many hands it may have passed_through , or of who may have supplied it to Mario Aburto Martinez , the 23-year-old factory_worker who allegedly pulled the trigger . &quot; It ' s like looking_for a needle in a haystack , &quot; said Ed Gleba , a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms , which closed its investigation last week without being able to trace the revolver ' s history . &quot; There could be a_million explanations for what happened to that gun. &quot; In that respect , the story of this cheap , antiquated six-shooter -- what one expert called &quot; the Pinto of handguns &quot; -- is a typically American tale . * There are nearly 220 million firearms circulating in the United States , one for virtually every man , woman and child . The vast majority of the weapons are owned by law-abiding people who buy them for protection , hobby or sport . But in a nation where gunfire also claims 35 # 000 lives a year , there is no system designed to account_for those weapons , to record their movement , or to prevent them from slipping out of legitimate channels and into the hands of the violent or deranged . &quot; The fact that this gun dropped_off the radar screen -- that ' s just business as usual in the world of firearms , &quot; said Erik Larson , the author of &quot; Lethal Passage , &quot; a new book that traces the path of a single handgun . In Mexico , official policies are far more stringent , prohibiting the sale of all firearms to anyone outside law_enforcement or the military . But the reality is that weapons flow freely from the United States into many border towns , lured primarily by the narcotraficante underworld . Although motorists approaching Tijuana are met with black_and_white signs that warn : &quot; Guns Illegal in Mexico , &quot; the demands of a tourist economy come first . Unlike the long lines that mark the return to the United States , most visitors entering Mexico are waved in without a word . &quot; It ' s about as difficult to get a gun in Mexico as it is to obtain a fraudulent green_card up here , &quot; said Wayne Cornelius , director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at UC San Diego . &quot; It ' s not as if Mario Aburto had to get_on a bus to San Francisco and go looking_for his favorite gun store. &quot; The . 38-caliber Taurus that allegedly landed in Aburto ' s hands is not the kind of weapon that tends to make headlines in either country these days , not when there ' s access to high-powered semiautomatic rifles , laser sights , armor-piercing ammunition and combat-size ammunition magazines . But even after 17 years , the $ 50 revolver proved to be just as deadly , living_up_to Taurus ' twin hallmarks of &quot; quality and price. &quot; &quot; It ' s not as pretty as my $ 800 gun and it ' s not real cool , &quot; Gleba said . &quot; But obviously it ' ll do the job . It ' s a cheap killing machine. &quot; If it were not for America ' s seemingly insatiable appetite for handguns , a good number of the 2 # 200 employees at Forjas Taurus , located in the south Brazilian river town of Porto Alegre , would probably be out of a job . Instead , Taurus has become one of the world ' s leading handgun exporters , producing more_than 100 models and growing_into an $ 85-million-a-year powerhouse , despite Brazil ' s own troubled economy . The United States , which annually purchases about 150 # 000 Taurus handguns , accounts_for 60 % of the company ' s revenues . &quot; There is , undoubtedly , no market for guns in the world as big as the United States , &quot; Taurus President Carlos Alberto Murgel said . Domestic manufacturers still dominate the U.S. handgun market , producing more_than 1.5 million pistols and revolvers a year for the nation ' s 245 # 000 federally licensed dealers . However , imported weapons are not far behind , often topping 1 million a year , according to federal authorities . Like most arms manufacturers , Murgel disavows any responsibility for the small percentage of people who misuse his merchandise . It is unfortunate that a Taurus became linked to one of Mexico ' s most shocking political assassinations , he said , but violence should be blamed on criminals and the governments that fail to stop them . &quot; Guns , &quot; he said , &quot; are not the problem. &quot; This . 38-caliber revolver could not have begun its journey in any steadier hands . * Bob Chow , who for 35 years owned a gun shop in San Francisco ' s Mission District , competed on the U.S. Olympic shooting team during the 1948 games in London . He placed 13th in the 25-meter rapid-fire match -- an event that requires marksmen to shoot 60 rounds at a series of silhouette targets in about 60 seconds . The shop , now called High Bridge Arms , still has a trophy_case full of Chow ' s shooting prizes , most of them gold figurines of a man taking_aim , his left_hand on his hip and his right arm fully extended . &quot; He ' s a tough old_man , very tough , &quot; said Masashi Takahashi , who bought the store in 1988 from Chow , now believed to be in his late 80s . One of the first things Takahashi did was renovate the shop ' s second-floor apartment , which Chow had refused to rent for fear that a tenant would be tempted to cut a hole in the floor and steal all_of his weapons . &quot; He doesn ' t trust people , &quot; Takahashi said . The security executive who first bought the Taurus tends to share those doubts . Concerned about the potential for attacks by political extremists , as well as the hassle of being hounded by news crews , the executive granted The Times an exclusive interview on the condition that his identity not be revealed . &quot; I don ' t want any publicity , &quot; said the 62-year-old retiree , sitting in the living room of his apartment in the placid Contra Costa County community of Lafayette . &quot; I also don ' t want anyone , from whatever side , knocking_on my door with a rat-a-tat-tat. &quot; The executive , a veteran of the security world in Los Angeles during the turbulent 1960s , formed his own company in 1976 . He soon was employing about 100 guards and serving a variety of high-profile Bay Area clients that included prominent retail outlets and financial_institutions . Like many security executives , at least those who count themselves among the industry ' s more responsible practitioners , he frowned_on the use of armed guards because of the liability risks . &quot; You shouldn ' t put guns on people in public places , &quot; he said . &quot; Sooner or later , the guns go off. &quot; But less than a year into his business , a valued client with a vault insisted on armed protection . Assured that his guard would have no contact with the public , the executive acquiesced . The only problem was that he had no gun . So , in 1977 , the security executive paid a visit to Bob Chow , hoping to find an inexpensive . 38-caliber revolver , something without the firepower or bullet-capacity of a more sophisticated weapon . &quot; Anything else is too dangerous , &quot; he said . A six-round revolver can be loaded with just five bullets , he said , leaving the hammer set_on an empty round &quot; so that if the mother drops , it ain ' t gonna go off. &quot; The . 38-caliber Taurus he selected , modeled after a popular Smith &amp; Wesson , was one of about 225 # 000 handguns legally sold in California that year . As state law has required since 1975 , the security executive waited 15 days while officials conducted a background check before he could pick_up the weapon . Since then , nearly 5 million handguns have been legally sold in California , with last year setting an all-time record of 429 # 217 . During that time , fewer than 1 % of handgun sales have been denied by state officials , who check for a history of criminal or psychiatric problems . &quot; After I learned what happened ( in Mexico ) , I suppose I was stunned or shocked or flabbergasted , but not really surprised , &quot; said the security executive , who was visited by federal_agents just hours after the Tijuana assassination . &quot; Goodness knows , if he didn ' t have this gun , he would have gotten another. &quot; The security executive told federal firearms agents that in 1980 he sold his contracts and assets to Stanley Smith , which was founded in 1928 and has grown to be the fifth-largest security firm in the nation . Based in San Antonio , the company employs 8 # 000 guards , about 6 % of whom are armed . But when the agency contacted Stanley Smith , company officials could find no record of the weapon , either in Texas or at their parent company ' s Australian headquarters . Although the purchase of the Bay Area firm represented a relatively minor acquisition -- the assets were valued only at about $ 3 # 000 -- a Stanley Smith spokesman said such a weapon would have been carefully screened . &quot; We don ' t have anything to indicate that we ever received it , &quot; said Patrick Schindler , vice_president of corporate development . &quot; At this point , we ' re assuming we didn ' t. &quot; And there the paper trail stops . Under federal law , firearms sold between private parties do not need to be reported . Until 1991 , the same was true for California . Since then , the state has required private transactions to be made through a licensed gun dealer , who is supposed to hold the weapon for 15 days while officials conduct a background check on the buyer and seller . But the state agency that reviews those applications has no enforcement authority and no way of knowing how many people skirt the process -- avoiding the $ 24 filing fee and the chance of a denial . &quot; It ' s one of those things that ' s against the law , but if nobody sees it , how are you going_to enforce it ? &quot; said Ann Norman , an analyst with the state_Department of Justice . There are , of course , a large_number of gun enthusiasts who believe that any attempt to regulate the sale of firearms infringes on their constitutional rights . Even those who concede that some restrictions are appropriate contend that most government controls only inconvenience the large majority of responsible gun owners , instead of targeting criminally minded people who don ' t obtain their weapons through official channels in the first place . &quot; If somebody steals a gun or buys_it on the black_market , they don ' t create a paper trail to begin with , &quot; said Alan Gottlieb , founder of the Second Amendment Foundation , an educational and legal defense fund . &quot; Even if there was one , quite frankly , it would be meaningless . Tracing a gun doesn ' t help prove who committed the crime. &quot; Most gun_control advocates believe firearms are still far too easy to obtain , even for law-abiding people who end_up using them in domestic quarrels , accidents or suicides . Because virtually every weapon that falls_into criminal hands was originally acquired by legal means , groups such_as Handgun Control Inc. are pushing for laws that would require the registration of all handgun purchases , including private transactions . &quot; We think people will become more responsible about their weapons if they know the paper trail will end with them , &quot; said Susan Whitmore , director of communications for the national lobbying group . In the end , however , people bent_on murder usually get their way . Whether by conspiracy or happenstance , this revolver landed in the hands of an assailant whose audacity would leave Mexico reeling . Aburto , who in a recent poem wrote that &quot; the forces of peace are greater than the forces of war , &quot; purportedly confessed to taking target_practice before the point-blank attack . It seems unlikely that he would have been admitted to any of the firing_ranges around Tijuana . The ranges -- like the Berrendo Club on the old Ensenada highway -- are exclusive fraternities where the names of members are posted on the wall , complete with a catalogue of their weaponry , including make , model and serial number . What matters most is that 11 days ago , he arrived in the shantytown of Lomas Taurinas , which , like the handgun , draws its name from the potent imagery of the bull . As the man expected to be Mexico ' s next president greeted some of Tijuana ' s poorest voters , Aburto allegedly worked his way through the crowded dirt square and stuck the gun to Luis Donaldo Colosio ' s head . Only then did the journey of this . 38-caliber Taurus come_to an end . * Correspondent Mac Margolis in Rio de Janeiro contributed to this story . Deadly Path The . 38-caliber Taurus revolver used to kill Mexico ' leading presidential candidate was legally purchased in 1977 to arm a guard employed by a Bay Area security company . By 1980 , the gun ' s paper trail already had evaporated and the weapon , one of more_than 200 million in circulation in the U.S. , soon slipped through the cracks . This is all investigators know : 1977 : The revolver , imported from Brazil , is offered for_sale at the Bob Chow Gun Shop in San Francisco ' s Mission District . 1977 : The head of a Bay Area security business buys_it for about $ 50 after one of his clients requests an armed patrol . 1980 : The security company and its assets are purchased by Stanley Smith Security Inc. , a large Texas-based firm , which says it can find no record of having ever received the gun . March 23 , 1994 : Mario Aburto Martinez , a 23-year-old factory_worker , allegedly uses the revolver to fatally wound Mexico ' s leading presidential candidate during a campaign rally in Tijuana .</TEXT>
