   <HEADLINE> IT ' S MORE THAN A PIPE_DREAM ; EFFORT TO QUENCH SOUTH COUNTY THIRST WORRIES THOSE IN PATH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The $ 625-million underground pipeline would be Orange County ' s largest ever , tall enough to put a basketball_hoop inside and still have three feet to spare , and wide enough to deliver 260 million gallons of water a day . Its main section would be called the Cleveland Tunnel , an eight-mile furrow 2 # 200 feet beneath Bedford Peak in the Santa Ana Mountains and the Cleveland National Forest . Eighteen miles in all , the pipeline would link the western tip of the Colorado_River Aqueduct -- Lake Mathews in Riverside County -- with two other underground pipes near Irvine to satisfy the water demands of future developers and a south Orange County population expected to grow by 100 # 000 people in 20 years . If approved by the board of the huge Metropolitan Water District of Southern California ( MWD ) -- an agency known for its monumental water_projects -- the pipeline would be paid_for by water users in its 5 # 200-square-mile service_area from Ventura through San Diego County . Project backers say it is not only vital for growth , but would also serve as an alternate source of_imported water in an emergency , particularly an earthquake , which could damage water_lines and interrupt service . South County is almost totally dependent_on imported water . &quot; I think it ' s critical , I ' m a major proponent of it , &quot; said Peer Swan , president of the board of directors of the Irvine Ranch Water District , the county ' s largest district . &quot; Right now , all_the water coming_into this area comes from one water_plant . If we had an earthquake that affected that plant , then South County is out of water. &quot; However , residents of the rural Modjeska , Williams and Silverado canyons in the foothills of the Santa Ana Mountains , who live within yards of the tunnel exit , worry about what the project might do to their semirural lifestyles . Although construction probably would n ' t start for several years , talk_of the tunnel has reached a fever pitch among residents of Orange County ' s canyons in recent weeks as a Tuesday deadline looms for comments that will help shape the project ' s environmental impact report . A 24-hour-a-day construction project virtually in their back yards that could last four years might destroy the quiet ambience of the narrow , rustic canyons , they say in a letter to MWD officials . &quot; We don ' t have any chance of stopping this . There ' s no way in the world , &quot; said Toni Doscher , a postal worker , four-year resident of Silverado Canyon and a member of the Intercanyon League , an organization of about 900 residents from the three canyons . &quot; ( But ) we would like it to be the least disruptive to the animals and the trees . This is the only place left in Orange County where you can still see a puma . . . where your grandkids can come_up and see a creek with frogs in it . . . . We are doing our best to keep it that way , &quot; Doscher said . The plan calls_for 200 # 000 acre-feet of water a year to flow by gravity through the pipeline from Lake Mathews , a reservoir near Corona built_in the 1930s that stores Colorado_River water . Then , the water would go_into a connection just north of the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station that would tie into two other major feeder pipelines : the Allen-McColloch line and the South County pipeline . * The Cleveland Tunnel would enter the 136 # 000-acre national forest through Bedford Canyon in Riverside County and emerge just north of Williams Canyon in Orange County , the smallest of the local canyons and home to only 11 families . The pipeline project is among $ 7 billion in capital improvement projects on the books over the next decade for MWD , the Los Angeles-based water agency that has built 130 miles of tunnels to distribute water throughout Southern California and whose board chairman is John V . ( Jack ) Foley of San Juan Capistrano , manager of the Moulton Niguel Water District in Laguna Niguel . &quot; I want to keep showing an effort for this project , &quot; Foley said . &quot; South County really benefits from it . This project also allows us to bring water in at high ( pressure ) that allows us to fill all_the reservoirs and shut_down the pump stations , &quot; which saves energy costs . Even though the project hasn ' t been approved yet , preliminary work is underway and MWD is already acquiring land for the pipeline ' s right-of-way , including a citrus grove near Lake Mathews where a treatment plant will be constructed to make the lake ' s water safe for drinking . Perhaps the engineering hallmark of the project will be tunneling through the mostly hard rock under the forest . Geologist John Waggoner of Yorba Linda , the project ' s consultant , said work crews will start on both sides of the mountains and meet in the center , much like was done_in the &quot; Chunnel &quot; project that connects England and France under the_English Channel . Instead of the traditional method of drilling and using explosives , the excavating and laser surveying methods of modern times make_it &quot; pretty easy to meet in the middle , &quot; Waggoner said . The large drills of today have more_than 40 cutters , weigh more_than 200 tons and operate_on about 1 # 000 horsepower generated by electricity , he said . &quot; You ' ve got a machine that ' s basically a big drill . . . . It kind of inches its way forward , &quot; Waggoner said . But modern technology does little to ease canyon residents ' concerns over constant truck_traffic in Silverado Canyon and on Santiago Canyon Road , which is the main highway to the canyons . * Residents are also fearful about how increased noise would affect the local elementary_school and wildlife and the possible contamination of their underground water by the constant drilling . A representative of the U.S. Forestry Service , which oversees Cleveland National Forest , said its natural_springs and underground waters are vital to the wildlife and will have to be closely monitored by MWD officials . Adam Kear , MWD ' s project manager , said district officials have met with the canyon residents in recent months . &quot; These are understandable concerns . We will continue to look_for ways to further mitigate these problems . . . and we are counting_on the canyon folks to help us come_up with solutions , &quot; Kear said . Kear added &quot; construction activity will be completely hidden from any homes &quot; and MWD is studying possibly rerouting the pipeline away from the canyon areas , which the canyon residents strongly support . &quot; The community wants to work with ( MWD ) , but we sure don ' t want to be mowed over by them , &quot; said Judy Myers , a substitute teacher and 29-year resident of Silverado Canyon . She questioned who really benefits by the new water_line and whether it would encourage further growth in South County . &quot; They say they need it for those people who are already there , but just like roads , once they get the water they can bring more people in , &quot; Myers said . MWD officials , who have held two public meetings in South County this fall , will review all_the comments and package them into a final environmental document to be presented to the MWD board of directors early next year . If the board approves the project , permits would then have to be sought from myriad government_agencies , including the U.S. Forestry Service and the state Water Resources Quality Board , Kear said . Water Tunnel A proposed 18-mile pipeline that would deliver water from Lake Mathews in Riverside County to another underground pipe near Irvine involves drilling a huge tunnel through the Santa Ana Mountains and the Cleveland National Forest in Orange County . Tuesday is the final deadline set for public comment on this project . * End : El Toro MCAS : 600 ft . Santiago Canyon : 1 # 160 ft . Silverado Canyon Bedford Peak : 3 # 691 ft . Bedford Canyon : 1 # 280 ft . Hwy . Temescal Wash : 15 Start : Lake Mathews : 1 # 380 ft . * Bringing Water to Orange County Water from the California Aqueduct and the Colorado_River Aqueduct is pumped to the Diemer Filtration Plant in Yorba Linda , treated , and then distributed through four main pipelines to customers in Orange County . The proposed pipeline would connect to the Allen-McColloch pipeline near the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station . * Tunnel-Digging Machine Tunnel-boring machine extends cutting face ino mountain , chews_up rock and removes debris by conveyor_belt . A tunnel-boring machine beginsf at each end of mountain and digs toward center . * Project cost : $ 625 million * Pipeline funding : Customers of Metropolitan Water District of Southern California will pay * Tunnel size : 14 to 15 feet in diameter * Santa Ana Mountain Tunnel length : Eight miles * Proposed materials : Reinforced concrete or steel * Dirt : More_than 500 # 000 cubic_yards will be drilled and removed * Pipeline water : About 200 # 000 acre feet of water a year will pass_through pipeline . An acre foot is 326 # 000 gallons , or an acre of land under one foot of water . * Customers : Metropolitan Water District customers from Ventura to San Diego County . * Source : Metropolitan Water District of Southern CaliforniaDR , COLOR , Water Tunnel , SCOTT BROWN / Los Angeles Times</TEXT>
