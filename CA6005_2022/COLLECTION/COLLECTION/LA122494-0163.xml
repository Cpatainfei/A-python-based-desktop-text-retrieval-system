   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY ; NOTEBOOK ; NO 3-ALARM POMP IN TIMES OF AUSTERITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Low profile : A planned groundbreaking_ceremony for a new county fire_station in Newport Beach was canceled this week by county and Irvine Co . officials . Construction of Fire_Station No . 52 on Newport Coast Drive , next to an Irvine Co . development , will proceed on schedule . But in light of the financial crisis , officials decided it was best to move forward without the pomp and circumstance of a ceremony . &quot; They just decided it wasn ' t a good use of time or energy to celebrate the groundbreaking , given the county ' s situation right now , &quot; Irvine Co . spokeswoman Dawn McCormick said . * The one day of Christmas : The holiday weekend will bring a welcome respite for county officials who have been working practically nonstop since the bond crisis exploded three weeks ago . No emergency Board of Supervisors meetings are scheduled this weekend . Workers who put their holiday plans on hold because of the crisis said they ' ll use the time_off to do last-minute Christmas shopping and spend time with their families . &quot; I ' m pretty excited , &quot; said Nancy Swanson , a staffer in the clerk of the board ' s office , who hasn ' t had a day_off since Dec . 6 . Instead of shopping for gifts , Swanson spent the last two weekends at the Hall of Administration , scheduling special board_meetings . * Not in the job description : For local elected officials , the crisis has turned part-time jobs into day-and-night obsessions . &quot; During the last three weeks , I have probably had less than four hours of sleep each night as we ' re trying to understand the depth of the problem , &quot; said Tom Burnham , president of the Irvine Unified School District Board_of_Education . &quot; When you have a full-time job , this is the equivalent of another full-time job. &quot; Others agreed that crisis has come_to dominate their lives . &quot; This is taking our full attention , &quot; said Orange Mayor Joanne Coontz . &quot; I don ' t have any Christmas decorations , no Christmas_tree , no nothing . I ' ve pared it down to the essentials . I ' ve not been able to do any of the normal things you do during Christmas at home. &quot; * that ' s the spirit : The threat of massive layoffs so close to Christmas has spawned some gallows humor on the part of county workers . On Thursday , one county employee smoking a cigarette outside the assessor ' s office broke_into song . The tune was from &quot; It ' s Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas. &quot; But the lyrics had a twist : &quot; It ' s beginning to look a lot like cutbacks , &quot; he crooned . * Helping hand : In response to announcements of layoffs , the Orange County Federal Credit_Union wants to soften the blow . Credit_union officials said Friday that they will work_on a one-on-one basis with members to help restructure their debts , consolidate loans and lower payments on existing loans . &quot; Basically , we ' re doing our part . . . to sort of ease whatever news may come_out , &quot; said Errol Griffin , the credit_union ' s executive_vice_president . &quot; We don ' t know what that news will be. &quot;</TEXT>
