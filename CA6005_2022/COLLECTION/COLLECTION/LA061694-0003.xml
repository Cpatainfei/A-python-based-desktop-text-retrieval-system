   <HEADLINE> ACCESS WATCH ; KEEP DATA FLOWING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Public access to public records should be a given_in a society that prides itself on being open and free . Unfortunately , two 1993 state court decisions allow law_enforcement agencies to set strict limits on the release of even the most basic crime-related information.In response , a state Senate bill has been proposed to restore appropriate access . Before the 1993 rulings , California law already granted police agencies broad power to withhold information from the public . Internal memos , records concerning pending litigation , personnel files and other information relating to security , intelligence or disciplinary actions are exempted by the state public records act . Such protections should be enough to safeguard police records . Yet the court rulings -- Williams vs . Superior_Court and County of Los Angeles vs . Superior_Court -- went further . They , in_effect , allowed police agencies to make public only the so-called &quot; blotter sheet &quot; information , which is data concerning arrests and crimes in an area . SB 1460 , authored by state Sen . Charles M . Calderon ( D-Whittier ) , would address the inequities created by the courts . The bill would amend the California Public Records Act by opening investigatory files to the public once the need for secrecy had elapsed . It would also bring the state law into compliance with the federal Freedom of Information Act . Like current law , Calderon ' s bill contains a number of provisions to deal with police concerns . But unlike the court decisions it also balances that against the public interest .</TEXT>
