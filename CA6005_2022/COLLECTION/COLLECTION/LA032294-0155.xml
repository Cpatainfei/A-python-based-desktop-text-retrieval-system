   <HEADLINE> MOSQUE SECURITY HAD WORRIED RABIN LAST FALL ; ISRAEL : TESTIMONY REVEALS THAT PRIME_MINISTER ASKED FOR PREVENTIVE MEASURES IN OCTOBER AT THE HEBRON SITE WHERE A SETTLER SLAUGHTERED PALESTINIANS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin was aware as early as last October of the likelihood of escalating extremist acts at Hebron ' s Cave of the Patriarchs , the holy site where an armed Jewish settler massacred about 30 Palestinians last month , a senior Israeli commander testified Monday . Rabin stressed on several occasions , in private meetings with his top military officials , the need for more security to prevent increased settler violence at a shrine sacred to both Jews and Muslims , said Brig . Gen . Gadi Zohar , who heads the Civil Administration , Israel ' s military government in the occupied West_Bank . Zohar ' s testimony , the latest in a series of revelations before a five-member Israeli judicial commission investigating the Feb . 25 killings , appeared to add_to the growing evidence of security lapses at a holy site that the Israeli government knew had become a flash_point that could undermine the Middle_East peace process . But Zohar and a retired Israeli brigadier_general also indicated in their testimony before the commission Monday that no one in the military or the government foresaw the &quot; extraordinary act of a lunatic , &quot; such_as Baruch Goldstein , the Brooklyn-born physician who fired more_than 100 rounds from an assault_rifle into a crowd of kneeling Muslims as they prayed . &quot; It never occurred to me that a Jew would be capable of committing such an act , &quot; said Brig . Gen . Moshe Yaalon , who served as Israel ' s military commander in the occupied West_Bank until the first of the year . Rather , Yaalon added , the security_system that permitted Jewish worshipers to carry weapons into the shrine but required hand-searches of all Muslims entering the Cave of the Patriarchs was designed solely to prevent Arab attacks on Jews . &quot; I would not reach any conclusions from the extraordinary act of a lunatic , &quot; Yaalon told the commission , set_up to answer questions surrounding the massacre . Earlier testimony indicated that the incident occurred at a time when there were fewer Israeli guards at the site than there were supposed to be and that the soldiers there took no notice of Goldstein and his weaponry . &quot; God forbid , I could have found myself testifying before a commission after Jews were butchered by 500 inflamed Muslim attackers , &quot; Yaalon said . &quot; Then the question would have been , ' Why weren ' t the Jews armed when they were praying so close to 500 Muslims ? ' &quot; Meantime , the violence continued Monday in the region . An Israeli officer and a soldier were killed when a roadside bomb exploded beside their passing patrol in Israel ' s self-declared security zone in south Lebanon , where Israel ' s forces have been_on a state of high alert for possible reprisals for the mosque massacre . Israel responded Monday afternoon by shelling suspected strongholds of the Islamic resistance group Hezbollah , or Party of God , which claimed responsibility for Monday ' s attack . A 12-year-old girl was killed and 22 other children injured when a shell struck near a school_bus , according to reports from south Lebanon . At the same time , at least three Jewish settlers were injured in the occupied West_Bank when an armed group opened_fire on a bus taking them to their settlement north of Ramallah . And at least 16 Palestinians were injured when Israeli security_forces opened_fire to quell continuing protests throughout the West_Bank and Gaza Strip , where last month ' s killings ignited a storm of outrage that has left dozens of Palestinians dead . Last October -- amid similar protest , bloodshed and escalating tension between Jews and Arabs who opposed Rabin ' s peace declaration with Yasser Arafat , chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization -- Zohar recalled the prime_minister stressing in his security meetings the sensitivity of Hebron ' s Cave of the Patriarchs . Zohar cited an attack inside the Muslim section of the shrine , attributed to the Jewish extremist settler movement . In that incident , he said , Jewish extremists poured acid on Islamic prayer carpets . Referring to Rabin by another of his job titles , Zohar said : &quot; The defense minister referred to the subject of the cave a number of times , in which he stressed the sensitivity of the place and the need to act there in accordance with the ( security ) arrangements . As far as I can recall , every time that I brought the subject up . . . ( Rabin ) expressed a great_deal of interest and responded. &quot; Zohar conceded that security arrangements at the shrine where Jews and Muslims pray so close to one another are &quot; problematic , &quot; but he insisted that appropriate precautions had been taken . He provided no further specifics in his testimony . But articles Monday in two prominent Hebrew dailies -- Davar and Al Hamishmar -- cited meetings that Rabin called_on Oct . 22 and 29 , when &quot; members of the security apparatus were told that he ( Rabin ) believed that there was a possibility that Jews would try to create provocations in the Cave of the Patriarchs in_order to derail the peace process. &quot; Both stories reported that Rabin stated in the Oct . 22 meeting , &quot; What is being said here about the rugs in the Cave of the Patriarchs should draw attention to those holy_places which can naturally move it from a national problem to a religious one. &quot;</TEXT>
