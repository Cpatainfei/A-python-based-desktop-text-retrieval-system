   <HEADLINE> U.S. DEFICIT WITH JAPAN HITS RECORD $ 59.3 BILLION ; TRADE : THE JUMP OF 23 % LAST YEAR PROMPTS THE CLINTON_ADMINISTRATION TO RENEW ITS CALL FOR OPEN MARKETS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The politically charged U.S. trade_deficit with Japan grew to almost $ 60 billion last year , the worst showing on record , the Commerce_Department reported Thursday . The news drew renewed calls from the Clinton_Administration for the Japanese to open their markets . The trade_gap with Japan accounted_for more_than half the U.S. trade imbalance worldwide in 1993 , with U.S. imports exceeding exports by $ 115.8 billion . The overall figure was 37 % higher than the year before and the worst level since 1988 . Paradoxically , the surge in red ink occurred largely because economic_conditions in the United States were better than those of most of the nation ' s major trading partners . Americans had more money to spend on imported goods than did the citizens of other countries . &quot; We were in a steadily increasing growth phase during this period , and many of our trading partners were not , &quot; said Laura D ' Andrea Tyson , head of the White_House Council of Economic Advisers . &quot; As a consequence , one would see the trade imbalance deteriorate. &quot; Tyson said a deep economic slump in Japan contributed to the $ 59.3-billion deficit with Tokyo , the largest bilateral imbalance the United States has recorded with any country . The trade_deficit with Japan was 23 % higher last year than it was the year before . The figures were especially explosive because President Clinton and Japanese Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa failed last week to resolve a festering trade dispute between the world ' s two largest economies . The Administration has already threatened to impose sanctions because Japan failed to open its cellular_telephone market to U.S. products . Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown said the 1993 figures &quot; underscore the need to push for open markets with our trading partners. &quot; He was especially critical of the deficit with Japan . &quot; This high trade_gap does not benefit either the United States or Japan , &quot; Brown said . &quot; The deficit does support President Clinton ' s strong commitment to concrete initiatives to improve access to the Japanese market. &quot; In Tokyo , Hosokawa and his top economic strategists promised to put_together a package of measures intended to open Japan ' s markets and avert a trade war with the United States . Details of the package have not been completed . But the measures will focus_on promotion of_imports , deregulation , tougher anti-monopoly enforcement and fairer government purchasing . Trade specialists in the United States say such steps would be welcome , but they say the Japanese have promised such measures in the past without having much impact on their chronic trade surpluses . The U.S. trade_deficit with China amounted to $ 22.8 billion last year , second only to the imbalance with Japan . U.S. officials saw some hope for improvement in the coming months , noting that the trade_gap for December was $ 7.4 billion worldwide , the smallest of the year . Tyson said non-government analysts had expected a monthly deficit in December to equal the average of about $ 10 billion for the previous 11 months . * But other analysts were less optimistic . The National Assn . of Business Economists predicted this week that the trade_deficit for 1994 will increase to $ 135 billion , and in 1995 to $ 137 billion . The annual trade figures are closely watched as a barometer of the nation ' s competitiveness in international markets . In theory at least , a nation must earn from exports the money it spends on imports . However , the United States seldom achieves that kind of balance . The last U.S. trade surplus was recorded in 1975 . U.S. exports increased 3.7 % to a record $ 464.8 billion last year . But imports rose 9 % to $ 580.5 billion , also a record . U.S. exports to Central and South_America exceeded imports from that region by $ 562 million , the only U.S. trade surplus with any region . Of that amount , the U.S. trade surplus with Mexico accounted_for $ 155.6 million . The U.S. trade_deficit with the countries of Western Europe was $ 280 million last year . The previous year , the United States recorded a surplus of $ 6.4 billion with Western Europe . The Bundesbank , Germany ' s central_bank , announced a half-point cut_in its discount_rate , to 5.25 % , a step intended to push_down interest_rates throughout the German economy . As a result , the dollar gained slightly against the mark , a trend that is expected to slightly worsen the trade_gap with Germany . * TAKING ACTION Japan says it will take &quot; voluntary &quot; measures to trim its trade surplus .
