   <HEADLINE> PERSONAL HEALTH ; BIG FIGHTS FOR ' 94</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Women ' s Health Initiative : The largest research study ever funded by the National Institutes of Health may be headed for trouble . The study , involving 160 # 000 women and 14 years of work , was designed to make_up for years of neglect on women ' s health . But in November , a committee of the Institute of Medicine expressed great skepticism in the merits of the study , setting_up a battle this year that might curb the ambitious effort . The Institute of Medicine was asked by the Congress to analyze the study after concerns emerged over its size , complexity and cost . The project is supposed to test strategies to prevent breast_cancer , cardiovascular_disease and osteoporosis . The Institute of Medicine ' s biggest criticism was of the part of the study that seeks to determine whether a low-fat_diet reduces the risk of breast and colon / rectal cancer . * Health_Care Reform : While a comprehensive national health plan may_not go_into effect until 1995 , the fighting will begin in_earnest this year . In the meantime , many other changes will take_place this year as industry prepares_for the inevitable . Look_for mergers galore among hospitals , doctors and health plans . * Vitamin Supplements : The war between the Food and Drug Administration and vitamin manufacturers will continue . The FDA announced last month that dietary supplements will remain widely available , but said that it will soon regulate claims on the labels for the first time . Expect continued protest from the industry . &quot; Once those regulations go_into effect , dietary supplement consumers will be put_in the dark about the benefits of dietary supplements . . . &quot; said Jerry Kessler , president of the Nutritional Health Alliance in New York . * Breast_Implants : Will the FDA bow to pressure on breast_implants ? After placing a moratorium on the use of silicone breast_implants , except as part of a federal study , the FDA is under pressure to reverse itself and allow unregulated use of the products . In a December issue of the Journal of the American Medical Assn. , AMA experts blasted the FDA ' s caution on implants and said : &quot; This anxiety is not warranted based on current scientific events. &quot; The AMA said it supports continued use of implants for reconstruction and augmentation . But research on the potential dangers of breast_implants is highly contradictory . And FDA Commissioner David Kessler , responding in same issue , said the AMA ' s position fails to acknowledge physicians ' responsibility to provide patients with adequate information . In an editorial , JAMA editor George D . Lundberg said : &quot; The resulting brouhaha should be interesting . In the silicone mess , there ' s plenty of blame to go around. &quot;</TEXT>
