   <HEADLINE> MARSHALL HIGH UPSETS TAFT IN ACADEMIC SUPER QUIZ ; EDUCATION : RETURNING CHAMPION IS THIRD AFTER EL CAMINO REAL IN 14TH-ANNUAL DISTRICTWIDE CONTEST . OVERALL WINNER WILL BE ANNOUNCED AT NOV . 29 BANQUET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Only a_few miles from the Rose Bowl , and down the street from the USC campus , another heated school rivalry was roiling Saturday evening at the Los Angeles Convention Center . After 11 hours of brain-wrenching competition , Marshall High_School upset returning city , state and national champion Taft High in the Super Quiz event of the Los Angeles Unified Academic Decathlon , finishing ahead of 54 teams from around the city . Unofficial results placed Woodland Hills ' Taft third , after Marshall High of Los Feliz and second-place El Camino Real High , also of Woodland Hills . The Super Quiz , a supercharged , high_school version of &quot; Jeopardy , &quot; was the culmination of a daylong battery of tests , essays and speech contests . This year , students answered three sets of 15 questions on biotechnology . A Super Quiz victory almost always indicates a strong overall showing , but it is an uncertain indicator of who will ultimately take first place in the decathlon . In the 13-year history of the L.A. school district decathlon , 11 Super Quiz winners have gone_on to finish in the top three , but only six have been named champions . Although the results of the Super Quiz were released immediately , the 1994 district champions will not be announced until a Nov . 29 awards banquet . In March , the team will go_on to compete in a statewide decathlon in Fresno . In the Super Quiz , Marshall scored 88 out of 90 possible points , which means four of the nine team members had perfect scores . &quot; The students studied hard and it showed , &quot; Marshall coach Phil Chase said . &quot; Finishing first in the Super Quiz is a good indicator of where you ' re going to end_up . I think it ' s safe to say that we ' re going to be in the top three. &quot; &quot; We ' re excited , but we ' ll have to wait until ( the banquet ) for the results , &quot; said James Evrard , one of the Marshall team members who got a perfect score . &quot; We were prepared_for harder questions . . . but winning was still great. &quot; Taft coach Arthur Berchin said his team , which finished five points behind Marshall , would be challenging two of the Super Quiz questions because they were poorly worded and may have had two correct answers . Even if their challenge prevails , it will have little result on the official outcome of the Super Quiz , he said . Marshall coach Chase said that he too thought that the questions were ambiguous , but said they were included in study guides provided by the national offices of the academic decathlon . The Super Quiz began with a flourish , the teams marching in buoyantly to the &quot; Olympic March , &quot; performed by the Roosevelt High_School band . Students flashed big smiles and threw thumbs-up signs to the wildly cheering audience of about 1 # 500 people . When the Super Quiz began , the crowd hushed to hear KTLA news anchor Larry McCormick read the first question , which seemed oddly topical given the nation ' s fixation with the O.J. Simpson trial . &quot; One of the techniques of molecular_biology in forensic science used to exonerate innocent crime suspects . . . , &quot; McCormick asked . After a regulated seven-second pause , during which each contestant tried to mark the correct answer from a list of five choices , many competitors threw_up their arms in triumph when McCormick intoned the correct answer : &quot; DNA fingerprinting. &quot; After the first round of 15 questions , El Camino Real held a one-point lead over Taft , University and Marshall . But when second round results were displayed , Taft and University had fallen farther behind and the scene was set for a battle between Marshall and El Camino Real , which then trailed by only two points . &quot; It feels_like we ' re in the fourth quarter trying to run_out the clock ! &quot; shouted Chuck Merman , Marshall ' s athletic director , to a group of anxious parents and students . But when the quiz score was tallied , indicating a perfect performance in the final round , many in the audience -- including two rows of uniformed cheerleaders from the Los Feliz school -- broke_out in cheers of , &quot; Marshall ! Marshall ! Marshall ! &quot; And while Marshall , El Camino Real , Taft and other high-ranking schools looked_forward to the awards banquet , students from less successful schools took_pride in their individual accomplishments . Fairfax High team member Thomas Arnold elatedly ran to a distant bank of telephones to call his parents . &quot; I got 14 out of 15 on the Super Quiz , &quot; he said , smiling broadly . Kenneth Kleven came_to the Convention Center to watch his son Doug compete for Marshall . &quot; It ' s very satisfying just to know that Doug ' s a participant , &quot; Kleven said , as he watched the teams vie for the title . &quot; He participates in cross-country and other sports but this is a lot more meaningful . This is something that will last him the rest of his life. &quot; Los Angeles County high_schools held a separate decathlon competition Saturday in which Diamond Bar High_School walked_off with Super Quiz honors . In second place was Nogales High_School , from the Rowland Heights Unified School District , and in third place was South High_School from Torrance .</TEXT>
