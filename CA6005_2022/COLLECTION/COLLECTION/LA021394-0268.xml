   <HEADLINE> FBI PROBES TAX-FUNDED CHILD-CARE FOUNDATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A California foundation whose widely acclaimed child-care program has been championed by powerful legislative leaders is under federal grand_jury investigation for possible misuse of more_than $ 1 million in taxpayer funds , The Times has learned . The criminal investigation , spurred by a state auditor ' s report , is focusing_on whether top officials of the Foundation Center for Phenomenological Research improperly spent money intended for poor children . Sources familiar_with the FBI investigation say that federal_agents are examining whether the Sacramento-based foundation ' s executive_director , Marilyn K . Prosser , used money from the nonprofit enterprise to purchase property in her own name and lease it back to the organization . They also are trying to determine whether the private_foundation , which receives most of its funding from public sources , used California money to help secure a multimillion-dollar contract_in New York City and whether it had business_relationships with Prosser family members that gave them exorbitant profits . On advice of her attorney , Prosser declined to comment . But other foundation officials and advisers deny any wrongdoing , saying that the organization is the victim of overzealous investigators who do not understand its intricate accounting_system . One of the largest publicly funded child-care providers in California , the foundation operates 10 programs in private homes_in Los Angeles County , where it also has three centers , including the David Roberti Child Development Center in South-Central , which is named for the state_senator and is considered the &quot; jewel in the crown &quot; of the group ' s facilities , officials said . The investigation has shocked and saddened the group ' s supporters and its officers , who have received international recognition for a program that serves 2 # 300 immigrant and poor children in California from just south of Oregon to the Mexican border . &quot; I firmly believe the Foundation Center has done nothing wrong , &quot; said Donne Brownsey , a consultant for the foundation and a former top aide to Roberti ( D-Van Nuys ) . &quot; I have never seen anything that has led me to believe that anything wrong has occurred , anything criminal has occurred . It ' s just shocking to think that people would even make that allegation. &quot; While federal prosecutors present their case for possible indictment , two state agencies -- the Department_of_Education and Department of Health Services -- are examining the foundation ' s handling of more_than $ 20 million in state and federal_government contracts over the last three years . A number of financial reviews have spotlighted questions about the foundation ' s practices : * The state education_department recently notified the foundation that preliminary findings contained in a financial report by an outside accountant show that $ 429 # 243 to $ 1.1 million may have been misspent in a three-month period in 1992 . The foundation receives more_than $ 8 million annually in state and federal funds for its California programs . &quot; These are stunningly huge amounts of precious child development dollars allegedly illegally spent by the foundation , &quot; Deputy Schools Supt . Robert W . Agee wrote in a letter to the foundation . The financial review , conducted by the Alexandria , Va. , firm Cotton &amp; Co. , identified expenditures that the education_department considers questionable -- either because they cover old debts or appear to have nothing to do with the care of children . Education_department officials had turned_to Cotton &amp; Co . to verify earlier findings by state controller ' s auditors . Sacramento attorney James M . Mattesich , who is representing the foundation , contended that the Virginia firm misunderstood the organization ' s financial records and as a result had reached the wrong conclusions . * Auditors , including the foundation ' s accountant during the course of a routine audit , raised concerns about high fees paid to family members and friends who made short-term loans to the organization . An April , 1993 , controller ' s survey said the fees amounted to &quot; exorbitant interest rates. &quot; Lenders earned a 10 % fee even when they got their money back in as little as three days . Foundation officials said in a written response to The Times that the short-term loans were needed to tide them over when payments from the state were late . They argued that the fees were akin to those paid by private companies in similar circumstances . They said Prosser paid the fees out of_her_own pocket , but her auditor noted that the fees were paid by the foundation . * A Department of Health Services audit released in January demanded that the foundation pay_back 90 % of a $ 232 # 000 grant it received to provide no-smoking classes to parents and teachers . Health services auditors said there was no evidence that the foundation held all_the classes its contract required -- noting that at one center an employee admitted that attendance sheets had been falsified . Mattesich said he is confident the foundation will be successful in appealing the finding . * A report by the foundation ' s accounting firm disclosed that the taxpayer-supported group loaned Prosser $ 344 # 063 in the fiscal_year ending in June , 1991 . Foundation officials said in their written response to The Times that their accountants mistakenly recorded some transactions as loans , when they were not . The foundation ' s accountant also noted in his audit that as of December , 1993 , Prosser still held title to a movable classroom the foundation bought from her for $ 260 # 000 in June , 1992 . Foundation board_members say that even though the title was not transferred , they feel confident of Prosser ' s word that the foundation owns the classroom . Longtime admirers of the foundation say they have not wavered in their support , and many share foundation officials ' views that their troubles stem from personality differences with education_department officials . &quot; I had never ever before or since seen a program equal_to those run_by the Foundation Center , &quot; said Sue Toigo , who as one of the founders of the advocacy group Children ' s Lobby used to make the rounds at the Capitol on behalf of the foundation . Since it opened its first center in 1980 , the foundation has been showered with accolades for the quality of its Montessori programs , aimed primarily at Spanish-speaking children . What caught the eye of experts , state legislators and New York City officials who asked the foundation to start programs there is an apparent high rate of success at raising the self-esteem and hopes of children living below the poverty_line . Although measuring the success of preschool programs is difficult , teachers at the centers say their pupils often are ready to skip grades when they leave the program to enter school . Public_school administrators often visit the sites to find_out what gave them an advantage over other children . In child development centers decorated with designer touches , needy children play with top-shelf educational toys , listen to the music of Beethoven or Mozart and eat organic meals by candlelight on china dishes . &quot; Beauty really calls to children , &quot; said Antonia Lopez , the foundation ' s education director . &quot; If they are given things that are beautiful they learn to respect them -- and themselves. &quot; Foundation officials say in their response to auditors that they manage to provide quality care_for children at a low cost to the state by keeping their administrative expenses down -- largely by relying_on Prosser to handle all_the financial transactions . Education_department evaluators who visited the centers over the years generally were impressed by what they saw , with one praising the foundation in a 1991 report for having an &quot; excellent children ' s program and physical environment. &quot; But it was the foundation ' s expenditures for seeming luxuries that first raised a red flag for state auditors and eventually led to the federal investigation . Four former employees went_to the education_department starting in mid-1992 to allege that the foundation was using government funds to upgrade property that Prosser privately owned and leased back to the foundation , and to purchase elaborate furnishings for the centers . Among expensive items purchased , they alleged , were Native_American rugs at $ 500 to $ 2 # 000 apiece , $ 15 # 000 worth of photographic work for a public relations package , and cellular_telephones and compact_disc players for the centers . One former employee said that California funds were used to pay the salaries and air fare of nine foundation staff_members who traveled_to New York in May , 1992 . The purpose of the three-day trip , he said , was to help set_up day-care programs in New York City . Foundation officials insist that no grant money was used to improve Prosser ' s properties and defended the fine rugs and costly supplies as necessary to create an inspiring atmosphere for underprivileged children . They also maintained that no California money was used for New York ventures . But the allegations by former employees prompted education_department officials to request a financial review by the controller ' s office . On April 7 , 1993 , auditor Alan Cates identified as much as $ 880 # 000 in questionable expenses out of $ 2.4 million the foundation received in state funds . The amount , the controller ' s office said in its report , included some expenditures for luxury items and also funds used to pay outstanding debts . In addition , it said the foundation &quot; used state funds intended for the child-care program for non-program purposes , &quot; which he called a &quot; serious violation of child-care program regulations. &quot; Based on Cates ' findings , the Department_of_Education threatened to terminate the foundation ' s contract . In an effort to ensure continued funding , the foundation turned_to legislators who have long been supporters of its programs , asking them to intercede on its behalf . The foundation appealed_to state Sen . Art Torres ( D-Los Angeles ) , a longtime admirer of the foundation , who stepped_forward to contact state Controller Gray Davis . After Davis met with foundation officials at Torres ' request , his agency agreed to allow the foundation ' s accountant to present arguments to an auditor who had been directed to re-examine the findings . The second survey lowered the amount that was reported in the first survey to $ 363 # 000 . It also removed a phrase particularly objectionable to the foundation that questioned its solvency . A representative for Davis said it is normal practice for the controller to get personally involved in matters that generate telephone_calls to his office . &quot; The important thing is that we didn ' t bow to any pressure , &quot; said Carol Thorp , the controller ' s special assistant . The second survey still raised concerns about the foundation ' s practice of paying high fees to employees , relatives and friends who loaned it cash . From July to November , 1992 , the report noted , the foundation paid nearly $ 50 # 000 in such loan fees , leading it deeper into financial peril . Even before the controller ' s second survey was released , foundation officials discovered they had a more serious problem . Late in the afternoon of April 16 , 1993 , a team of FBI_agents swept into their 19th-Century Sacramento headquarters , disabling computers with wire_cutters and confiscating dozens of boxes of records and electronic_equipment . FBI spokesman Thomas P . Griffin confirmed that &quot; we have a pending investigation and it ' s before the grand_jury &quot; but refused to comment further . He did say that no political figures were included as targets of the investigation . Sources close to the investigation have told The Times that one focus of the investigation is whether Prosser used government money to buy property she leased back to the foundation . In the meantime , some of the foundation ' s supporters in the Legislature wrote letters pressing the education_department panel to continue the foundation ' s funding . There is no evidence that legislators were aware of the FBI raid or the federal criminal investigation . Its most powerful and persistent supporter has been Roberti , who said in a letter to Acting Schools Supt . William Dawson the findings of the controller ' s second financial survey &quot; would appear to be in no way sufficient to warrant the termination of the . . . contract. &quot; In a recent interview , Roberti said his primary reason for intervening was for the sake of the children in the programs . &quot; We ought to try not to disrupt the lives of the kids if it can be resolved in a less drastic way , &quot; he said . &quot; ( The controller ' s report ) really struck me as a bookkeeping dispute , &quot; he said . Dario Frommer , a spokesman for Torres , said : &quot; Everyone is so disappointed and discouraged with the turn of events . If there ' s wrongdoing , what can we do ? Art Torres knew_nothing of any wrongdoing . His concern was for the kids. &quot; Ultimately , the education_department granted the foundation another full year contract.INVESTIGATIONS</TEXT>
