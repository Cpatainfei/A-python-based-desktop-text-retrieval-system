   <HEADLINE> U.N. CHIEF URGES NATO TO APPROVE BOSNIA AIR STRIKES ; BALKANS : EARLIER , CLINTON AVOIDED THE ISSUE , SAYING THAT THE SARAJEVO SHELLING SHOULD SPUR PEACE TALKS . IT IS UNKNOWN WHEN THE WESTERN ALLIES ' COUNCIL WILL MEET .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.N. Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali urged NATO on Sunday to authorize air strikes on artillery positions in Bosnia-Herzegovina , hours after President Clinton sidestepped pressure to undertake military retaliation for the shelling that killed 68 people in a Sarajevo marketplace . A senior U.N. official said Boutros-Ghali had sent a letter to Manfred Woerner , the secretary_general of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization , asking the NATO Council to approve &quot; the launching of air strikes against artillery positions in and around Sarajevo , which are responsible_for attacks on civilian targets. &quot; There was no word on when the NATO Council , made_up of the foreign_ministers of the 16 member nations , would meet to consider the request . Clinton , who said the shelling Saturday should spur the warring Muslims , Serbs and Croats to the peace table , cautioned that NATO must grant its approval before any such air operations could begin . Clinton held a rare Sunday meeting with senior members of his national security team . He said afterward that the failure of peace talks would reinforce a U.S. proposal to lift the embargo on the shipment of arms to the Bosnian Muslims . Clinton ' s remarks made clear his aversion to using air_power to still the fighting in Bosnia , despite an assurance from Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) that there is &quot; strong bipartisan support &quot; in the Senate for such a course . Calling_on the President to take the lead in shaping an allied response to the attack , Dole said in an interview , &quot; what it cries_out_for is leadership -- American leadership. &quot; Responding with irritation to the pressure for air strikes , Clinton said , &quot; It ' s very well for these members of Congress to say that -- they don ' t have constituents on the ground. &quot; Madeleine Albright , the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , said on CNN after the emergency meeting at the White_House that &quot; we are working_at the highest level &quot; with NATO allies on the question of conducting air strikes . Under a U.N. Security_Council resolution , Boutros-Ghali has the right to order air strikes to protect Sarajevo ' s civilian population . But he said at a news_conference last week that it was pointless for him to order air strikes unless the NATO Council agreed to carry them out . In his letter to Woerner , dispatched Sunday night , he asked_for that approval &quot; as soon as possible , &quot; the U.N. source said . &quot; He has not called_on the ( NATO ) Southern Command to start bombing &quot; but only to have the option of doing so , another U.N. official said late Sunday evening . NATO voted_in August to provide air strikes on Serbian troops ringing Sarajevo if the United Nations requested them . NATO leaders toughened their stance last month but had been waiting for Boutros-Ghali ' s request . In recent weeks , Boutros-Ghali ' s aides have resented insinuations that he is the main stumbling_block to the use of air_power in Bosnia . With the letter , he was evidently trying to make clear his readiness to order strikes if the United States and other NATO members would carry them out . In the aftermath of Saturday ' s attack and others that preceded it , U.S. officials have emphasized that one of the obstacles to carrying_out air_raids is determining who is responsible_for the shelling . The President asked Albright to accelerate the U.N. effort to determine responsibility for the shelling . &quot; Obviously , it seems highly likely that the Serbs are responsible , &quot; he said . But U.S. officials have said that because the allied intelligence-gathering apparatus in Bosnia is so limited , it is difficult to tell which forces actually did the shelling Saturday -- Serb-backed artillery or Muslim or Croatian forces . At the end of a weekend conference on security issues in Munich , Germany , William J . Perry , the new U.S. defense_secretary , said participating defense ministers considered &quot; powerful countervailing arguments &quot; about whether to launch air strikes or to take &quot; other strong action. &quot; He said officials need to determine what the objective of such missions would be and what they would accomplish . But , he said , television pictures of the aftermath of the attack were &quot; just horrifying &quot; and brought &quot; pressure to bear for more action. &quot; So far , U.S. action has been limited to the dispatch of Air_Force cargo planes to help ferry Sarajevo ' s wounded to hospitals in Germany and Italy . Clinton met in the White_House map room for 30 to 40 minutes Sunday with Albright , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher , National Security Adviser Anthony Lake , Undersecretary of Defense John M . Deutch and White_House Chief_of_Staff Thomas ( Mack ) McLarty . After directing his national security team to meet again today without him , he left for Houston , where he is to begin a three-day speaking tour through the South . Perry , speaking with reporters after the Munich meeting , said the principle option available to the United States is to &quot; try to accelerate the peace negotiations. &quot; Cautioning against a &quot; spasmodic reaction &quot; -- an emotional response that is not thought_out -- Perry said , &quot; It would be compounding the tragedy if we did not use this as an opportunity to drive everyone back to the peace table. &quot; Clinton , speaking with reporters as he left the White_House for his trip to Texas , said some nations are refusing to support any air strikes because they fear their peacekeeping troops in Bosnia would be subject_to retaliation . Among those that have raised objections are Canada and Britain , whose troops are among the 28 # 000 lightly armed peacekeepers there . &quot; That does not mean it won ' t happen . We ' re discussing it with our allies , &quot; the President said . Expressing the hope that the shelling would bring the warring sides to peace talks , Clinton said , &quot; I hope that the shock of these deaths will reinforce to them as_to the rest of the world that they ought to go_on and reach a settlement. &quot; The pressure on Clinton to press NATO to approve air strikes is coming from both Democrats and Republicans . Sen . Joseph I . Lieberman ( D-Conn. ) , a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said on CNN , &quot; We have the technical capability to go_in there with air_power , supplemented by a very limited number of people on the ground to direct those bombs to where we want them to hit. &quot; Dole said that simply lifting the embargo on arms shipments to the Muslims &quot; would send a strong signal &quot; to the Serbs ' backers in Belgrade , the capital of what remains of Yugoslavia . Air strikes , he said , &quot; could probably take_out most of the artillery , &quot; restoring a military balance that would bring the three sides to negotiations . Times staff writers Stanley Meisler in Washington , Art Pine in Munich and Paul Richter in Houston contributed to this report .</TEXT>
