   <TEXT> Director Barry Sonnenfeld was in the midst of screening &quot; Addams Family Values &quot; last fall when he decided to show research audiences a more daring rough cut of the film . After mulling it over , he changed his mind . The Paramount film had played well in past screenings . Why add something that might prompt a negative reaction ? A nightmarish fantasy began swirling in Sonnenfeld ' s head . &quot; I thought to myself , ' What if the film didn ' t play well and the Los Angeles Times finds_out about it ? Then suddenly I ' m going_to pick_up the paper and read that I ' m the director of a movie that ' s in trouble. ' &quot; From the point_of_view of Hollywood filmmakers , Sonnenfeld isn ' t being paranoid . Over the past year or so , The Times , Entertainment Weekly , the New York Times and other publications and entertainment TV_shows have been aggressively increasing their coverage of what were once closed-door show-biz events : test screenings , movie re-shoots and multimillion-dollar budget overruns . Just a_few examples of the controversial practice that industry powers call &quot; let ' s get ' em &quot; journalism : * In December , 1992 , the &quot; Today &quot; show interviewed Jim Meigs , then Entertainment Weekly ' s film editor , who predicted that &quot; Toys &quot; would be the bomb of the season -- even though he hadn ' t even seen it . * Early last May , two weeks before &quot; Sliver &quot; was_due out , the Los Angeles Times wrote_about rumors that the Paramount film was &quot; in serious trouble &quot; and had undergone re-shoots of scenes that amounted to as much as 40 pages of dialogue . * In September , Entertainment Weekly pounced on James L . Brooks ' $ 40-million musical , &quot; I ' ll Do Anything , &quot; offering details from a &quot; disastrous &quot; test screening that one anonymous attendee described as &quot; the worst torture possible. &quot; * In what proved to be the most controversial story of all , the Los Angeles Times ran a news_item last June 6 , citing anonymous sources talking_about a poorly received test screening of Columbia Pictures ' &quot; Last Action Hero. &quot; The news_item , written by free-lance writer Jeffrey Wells , was hotly contested by Columbia , which briefly threatened to pull the studio ' s advertising and deny the paper ' s reporters access to future Columbia film releases . Eight months later , Columbia marketing chief Sid Ganis is still seething about negative pre-release reporting on &quot; Hero. &quot; &quot; It ' s almost yellow_journalism , &quot; he says . &quot; The press is in an ' Oh my God , is this film in_trouble ' mode . How can a film be in_trouble if it isn ' t finished yet ? &quot; The practice has also extended_to coverage of TV and pop_music . Before Conan O ' Brien ' s NBC show &quot; Late Night &quot; hit the air , for example , Entertainment Weekly reviewed a dress-rehearsal show , panning the fledgling host ' s &quot; painful &quot; banter with his sidekick , Andy Richter , noting how frequently his jokes bombed ( &quot; often &quot; ) and deriding what it called his lackluster interviewing style . And five months before Nirvana released &quot; In Utero , &quot; its much- anticipated follow-up album to 1991 ' s &quot; Nevermind , &quot; the Chicago Tribune and Newsweek ran stories saying that Geffen Records , the band ' s label , had been unhappy with the album ' s abrasive sound -- and had persuaded the band to hire a hit-making engineer who would give the songs a more polished sheen . But the really big battles have erupted over coverage of Hollywood work-in-progress decisions . Filmmakers see such stories as a sign of the media ' s growing obsession with easily digestible info-bites and gotcha-style reportage . Action-movie impresario Joel Silver , angry after being stalked by the press while making &quot; Hudson Hawk &quot; and &quot; Die Hard 2 , &quot; says the intrusive media scrutiny has made him wary of producing risky , high-profile movies . &quot; When I made ' Die Hard 2 ' for 20th Century Fox , it was followed by clouds of bad press -- every publication said I was a crook and that everything was out of control . that ' s why I didn ' t make ' Beverly Hills Cop 3 , ' &quot; contends Silver , who was asked by Paramount to produce the sequel after its original producers , Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer , left the studio . Nonetheless , entertainment reporters say poorly received test screenings or a sudden flurry of re-shoots are newsworthy events , since they often serve as early indicators of the success or failure of high-profile film projects . And in many cases , it is a coterie of top Hollywood producers , agents and studio executives who are the first to whisper in reporters ' ears about problems plaguing a rival ' s film . The increased scrutiny has prompted a series of ferocious spin battles for control of a film ' s image , a battle that can sometimes signal the difference between box-office triumph or disaster . Since a movie ' s success is often determined by its opening-weekend grosses , Hollywood marketers are under increased pressure to build a fever pitch of awareness for a film with a barrage of celebrity interviews , TV trailers and ads . Any negative buzz about an upcoming film can break this marketing spell . Entertainment Weekly recently reported that Kurt Russell , star of Disney ' s &quot; Tombstone , &quot; hated a rough cut of the &quot; troubled &quot; film so_much that he called it the &quot; worst ( expletive ) he ' s ever acted in. &quot; Russell later disputed the quote , saying he was talking_about the movie ' s music , not the film itself . Meanwhile , &quot; Tombstone &quot; has gone_on to perform well at the box_office , despite that bad buzz and mixed reviews . The heightened tensions between movie studios and the media focus_on a simple truth -- this is a media age in which perception is reality . If a film studio has a stinker on its hands , its top marketing priority is keeping the press off the scent for as long as possible . &quot; It doesn ' t matter if the movie doesn ' t deliver , &quot; Columbia Pictures publicity chief Mark Gill said in Harper ' s magazine last year . &quot; If you can create the impression that the movie delivers , you ' re fine. &quot; But if the movie makes a bad impression , watch_out . One well- placed news_item about a supposedly troubled film can prompt a wave of skeptical press coverage . The bigger the wave , the more likely the impact on the film ' s box-office performance . &quot; It ' s a monumental task for filmmakers to overcome , &quot; says PMK ' s Pat Kingsley , the powerful and combative Hollywood publicist who has loudly complained about media coverage of her celebrity clients , most notably Tom Cruise . &quot; One little item can do a lot of damage . Once it gets picked_up by every_other newspaper , it sets the agenda. &quot; To no one ' s surprise , filmmakers never question press accounts of a successful test screening . Francis Ford Coppola blasted The Times for printing &quot; innuendo &quot; about an early &quot; Bram Stoker ' s Dracula &quot; test screening . But there were no complaints when gossip_columnist Liz Smith hyped a pre-release screening of the same film , saying it &quot; played through the roof &quot; with an audience that &quot; screamed , gasped and laughed in all_the right moments. &quot; Believing they had a potential hit on their hands , the producers of last summer ' s &quot; Sleepless in Seattle &quot; didn ' t hide their film from the press , either . Though the film wasn ' t due in the theaters until June , the producers held two advance screenings in late January , only weeks after the studio first saw the movie . They invited a handpicked audience of key newspaper , magazine and TV media representatives , who were shown what producer Gary Foster describes as a rough cut of the film . &quot; By giving the press an early peek , before the film was finished , we felt it put them on our team , &quot; Foster explains . &quot; It was a conscious decision to let the journalists decide for themselves . That way , when they became our mouthpiece , the word_of_mouth had a lot more credibility. &quot; Credibility cuts both ways . In Hollywood , bad buzz regularly originates from studio insiders eager to gain an edge over their competition . &quot; It ' s not fair to call the media negative , &quot; says Times movie editor Claudia Eller . &quot; People in this town are so competitive that they ' re always putting a negative spin on their rivals ' films . As reporters , we try to figure_out what ' s really news -- and what ' s just someone with an ax to grind. &quot; Part of the problem is that test screenings serve two purposes . Filmmakers see them as an artistic tool , using audience reaction to help them make hundreds of subtle alterations in narrative , theme and character development . But film studios frequently use screenings in other ways -- either as a way of determining whether audiences will embrace a particular ending , or as a marketing weapon , using positive audience reactions as a means of building good_word of mouth . Still , filmmakers say , stories about poorly received test screenings are , in_effect , judging a movie before it is finished . &quot; You ' re really reviewing a rough draft of a film , &quot; says Polly Platt , producer of &quot; I ' ll Do Anything , &quot; which opened on Friday . &quot; What is some little old_lady in Indiana going_to think when she logs onto Prodigy and reads our clips ? ' Oh , it ' s that musical film that had terrible screenings and now they ' ve delayed the release date and taken_out all_the music. ' She ' s going_to say to herself , ' Wow , that must be a bad picture. ' &quot; Many moviegoers may have been thinking the same thing about last summer ' s &quot; So I Married an Axe Murderer. &quot; As early as last January , in the midst of a story about a battle over the film ' s script credit , The Times reported that the Mike Myers vehicle was in_trouble . Re-shoots were in the works after several mediocre test screenings . The film ' s release was being bumped back from March to August . Even though executives at TriStar , the film ' s distributor , said the film had tested well and Myers ' agent insisted that re-shoots &quot; are more the rule than the exception &quot; these days , the bad buzz spread quickly . &quot; Axe Murderer &quot; producer Rob Fried compared the process to a wildfire . The Times piece was followed by an Entertainment Weekly piece about bickering between Myers and &quot; Wayne ' s World &quot; co-star Dana Carvey , which also mentioned &quot; mixed reactions &quot; to &quot; Axe Murderer. &quot; People magazine ran a gossip item saying the film was getting bad word_of_mouth after poor test screenings . These were followed by more negative press in Us , Premiere and the New York Times . &quot; It got_to the point where everybody in Hollywood thought our movie was in_trouble , &quot; Fried says . &quot; My mother in Boca Raton was talking_about it at the mah-jongg table. &quot; By the time the &quot; Murderer &quot; production team did a junket to promote the movie , the film ' s perceived problems -- and accounts of Myers ' difficult personality -- became a major part of nearly every feature piece on the picture . &quot; It affects you everywhere , &quot; Fried says . &quot; Theater owners hear the bad buzz and they get reluctant to book the film . The studio marketing executives hear about it and they get nervous about supporting the film . When the movie came_out , even the critics -- who should be judging the film on its merits -- were writing_about problems on the set. &quot; &quot; Toys &quot; producer Mark Johnson says he and director Barry Levinson were_on the dubbing stage in late 1992 , working_on the film ' s score , when they turned_on the &quot; Today &quot; show and heard Entertainment Weekly ' s Meigs tell host Bryant Gumbel that &quot; Toys &quot; was going_to be the Christmas season ' s big bomb . &quot; It ' s very unfair and demoralizing , &quot; Johnson says . &quot; The film wasn ' t even finished . No one had seen it yet . Yet everyone who watched ' Today ' already thought we were a flop. &quot; Meigs ' prediction was accurate : &quot; Toys &quot; grossed only $ 23 million . But Johnson believes it was a self-fulfilling prophecy : &quot; It just created a terrible climate . It really branded us. &quot; But not every film is harmed by negative advance press . Also in late ' 92 , the press was_full of bad buzz about &quot; Bram Stoker ' s Dracula , &quot; including a Los Angeles Times piece by contributor Jane Galbraith that reported on re-shoots and negative comments from anonymous test-screening audience members , who said they found the film &quot; hard to follow. &quot; &quot; Dracula &quot; director Francis Ford Coppola was so incensed by the story that he wrote a letter to The Times , disputing the piece . He concluded by saying : &quot; What does an incomplete , early preview . . . have to do with a finished movie ? How can a movie be anything but formula if you can ' t even preview it as part of the creative process without printed gossip ? &quot; The movie went_on to become a major box-office hit , prompting some filmmakers to argue that test screenings aren ' t especially reliable indicators of box-office performance -- and hence aren ' t especially newsworthy , either . &quot; Of all_the films I ' ve made , ' For Love or Money ' had_the_best test-screening scores , &quot; says director Sonnenfeld . &quot; Yet ' The Addams Family ' made 10 times what ' Love or Money ' did . &quot; To say a movie is in_trouble because of a bad screening is like looking_at a building when it ' s still all raw steel girders and scaffolding and saying it ' s going_to be ugly . You really can ' t tell until it ' s finished. &quot; One reason for all this jousting between filmmakers and journalists has been the explosion of media interest in Hollywood . Visit any newsstand and you ' ll see a tidal_wave of movie_industry coverage , from magazines with puffy celebrity profiles to newspapers with savvy business reporting to tabloids with sharp-tongued gossip items . &quot; We have become an entertainment junkie culture , &quot; says Entertainment Weekly ' s Maggie Murphy , the senior editor who oversees the magazine ' s News &amp; Notes section . &quot; Now there ' s a generation of entertainment consumers who are curious about the decisions that come_into play before the films reach the theaters. &quot; With the arrival of chart-oriented publications like USA Today and info-hungry shows like &quot; Entertainment Tonight , &quot; movie studios shrewdly began using a new film ' s opening-weekend business as a sign of box-office success . Early each week , movie fans can find weekend box-office results in hundreds of newspapers around the country , not to mention on CNN , E ! Entertainment cable and innumerable local TV news_shows . &quot; By Monday night , everyone knows that some movie didn ' t open as big as it was supposed to , &quot; says People magazine senior editor Leah Rozen . &quot; that ' s part of moviegoing in the ' 90s. &quot; Celebrities have always sold newspapers . But now newspaper readers are more sophisticated -- they want to read spicy coverage about conflicts over financing , budget overruns , on-location snafus and other behind-the-camera Hollywood action too . &quot; Once the print media started competing with tabloid-TV news_shows like ' Inside Edition ' and ' A Current Affair , ' you had everyone searching for brand-name material , names that people know , &quot; Joel Silver contends . &quot; Nobody cares if they put_out a candy_bar in Hershey , Pennsylvania , that doesn ' t sell . But if Barry Levinson , the director of ' Rain Man , ' makes a movie and it doesn ' t work , that ' s news. &quot; The question for Hollywood journalists : What part of the filmmaking process is fair_game for news coverage ? &quot; If a finished film is being test-screened , I think it ' s appropriate to report on the results , &quot; says Anne Thompson , a senior writer at Entertainment Weekly . &quot; But I don ' t think it ' s fair to report on an unfinished film that ' s being tested simply to help the filmmaker decide what works. &quot; Weekly Variety &quot; Buzz &quot; columnist Michael Fleming says he largely avoids writing_about test screenings , pointing to directors like Robert Zemeckis and James L . Brooks , who view the screening process as a crucial editing tool . Some reporters believe otherwise . Pat H . Broeske wrote an Entertainment Weekly piece that detailed the fallout from a &quot; disastrous &quot; early screening of &quot; I ' ll Do Anything. &quot; &quot; This was a highly touted $ 40-million musical by a major director which wasn ' t going_to make its Christmas release , &quot; Broeske says . &quot; When a monster gamble like that is having problems , it ' s news . Reporters in Detroit write_about problems cars have in their design and manufacture . They don ' t always wait till they ' ve come_off the assembly line. &quot; Times Executive Calendar Editor John P . Lindsay says newspaper readers have every right to read about the process of movie-making , especially since they ' re eventually going_to pay money to see those same movies in the theaters . &quot; Part of our job , especially for a paper based here in Hollywood , is to cover the process , &quot; he says . &quot; If a movie ' s out there and the filmmaker is showing it to people , then it becomes our responsibility to write_about it. &quot; Responsible reporting may be one thing , but gossip and innuendo are something else again . Pat Kingsley contends that the print media have taken a &quot; let ' s get ' em &quot; attitude toward the industry . She has repeatedly scolded the press , in particular Entertainment Weekly , for &quot; hostile &quot; coverage of her client Tom Cruise ' s casting in &quot; Interview With the Vampire , &quot; citing reports that the actor was wearing shoe lifts and jealous of co-star Brad Pitt . Kingsley also has been unhappy with The Times ' coverage of &quot; I ' ll Do Anything. &quot; She contends that The Times &quot; forced &quot; Brooks into letting staff writer Terry Pristin attend test screenings and question him about the film ' s problems for a story that ran in September . The Times had originally planned to report on an earlier , poorly received test screening , based on eyewitness accounts from several unnamed audience members . &quot; If we hadn ' t agreed to invite the reporter , the paper would have printed an item saying Jim had a negative test screening , &quot; Kingsley says . &quot; I think covering a film before it ' s finished is below-the-belt . Jim resented doing the interview . He felt it was a violation. &quot; Calendar ' s Lindsay says The Times never forced Brooks to agree to anything : &quot; It was a negotiation , not extortion , &quot; he says . &quot; It was our way of getting more access and information . I think the story we ran presented a balanced account of the test-screening process. &quot; Some of the filmmakers who have felt the glare of bad press are pulling their wagons in a circle . &quot; I can ' t imagine that we ' d ever preview a movie in town again , &quot; says producer Platt . &quot; We had bad screenings on ' Broadcast News , ' but we were allowed to experiment without every reporter in town calling . Now the climate has changed . What was once a private process has gone public. &quot; Says Columbia ' s Ganis : &quot; Movie-making is both a business and an art_form . And you can ' t write_about something that ' s essentially artistic , like screening an unfinished movie , as if it ' s just business. &quot; Not everyone defines the debate as art versus commerce . From the media perspective , the issue is viewed_as a time-honored struggle for access to information , a tug of war reporters engage in while covering every beat , whether it ' s Hollywood or the White_House . &quot; Until recently , most entertainment coverage was very controlled , &quot; says Entertainment Weekly ' s Maggie Murphy . &quot; But that ' s all changing . And I think the studios get uncomfortable when they realize we ' re no longer part of their marketing plan. &quot;</TEXT>
