   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : TODAY ' S TOPIC</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Of all_the challenges of living in southern California , perhaps none is more vexing than getting_to work . Although some commuters use public transportation , most -- about 85 % , or 3.5 million people in Los Angeles County alone , according to 1990 U.S. Census_Bureau figures -- get_behind the wheel of a car each workday . Traffic on most freeways can be intolerable and one accident can tie things up for hours . Still , Southern Californians overwhelmingly prefer the sound of the morning traffic report to the sound of a train whistle . &quot; The fact is that automobiles , with their stereo_systems and the flexibility they provide , will always be more attractive than public transportation , &quot; says Franklin White , chief_executive_officer of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority . &quot; Until it is as painful to use the automobile as it is in other cities , people will not move to mass transit , &quot; White adds . Yet mass transportation is a prominent concern , at least according to the responses Voices received in response to the Times ' special July 17 section &quot; The Next Los Angeles , &quot; which focused_on creative solutions to some of this area ' s problems . Those comments , some of which are printed in today ' s Readers Respond , indicate that many commuters are not looking_for such long-term and expensive solutions as railway and subway systems . They want people movers , bicycle lanes , minivans and more motorcycles . &quot; You need more personalized solutions , &quot; says Catherine Burke , an associate_professor of public administration at USC . &quot; Mass transit was for the 19th Century ; it shaped cities . If heavy-duty rail systems would solve problems , New York would be paradise. &quot; Burke , who calls building a railway_system &quot; an outrageous expenditure of public funds , &quot; agrees that such low-tech solutions as minivans and bicycle lanes are good ideas if safety issues can be resolved . &quot; I would open_up public_transit to private operators and allow people to develop things like minivans , &quot; Burke says . &quot; But you need to have some assurance that you are not going_to be attacked on these minivans . If we could make_it safe to ride a bicycle , that would be great. &quot; Orange County is experimenting to see if simpler solutions , such_as transporting people to trains in smaller buses , will take more cars off the roads , says David Elbaum , director of planning and development for the county transportation authority . &quot; Roads are always going_to be the foundation to mobility , &quot; Elbaum says . &quot; They ' re convenient and flexible . The key question is , ' Do you invest in a rail system to prevent future congestion ? ' &quot; It ' s a question that Los Angeles County has already settled . The MTA is spending $ 870 million annually , including debt service , on railway_systems , including subways . &quot; The answer to people who don ' t understand why we ' re building this rail system is that we ' re focusing_on tomorrow , &quot; White says . &quot; The rail system we are building must be seen as a supplement to a highway and road system that will be unable to meet the demands of the future. &quot;</TEXT>
