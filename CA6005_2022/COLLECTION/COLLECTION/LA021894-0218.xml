   <HEADLINE> LILLEHAMMER / ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS ; GOLDEN MOMENTS NOT NEW TO THEM ; CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING : PAST OLYMPIC CHAMPIONS DAEHLIE AND EGOROVA ADD TO THE HAUL IN NORWAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A couple of express_trains stayed right on schedule Thursday in Olympic cross-country_skiing , one Norwegian , the other Russian . And in Norway ' s case , a switch_engine was doing the hauling . Bjorn Daehlie , winner of three gold medals and a silver in the 1992 Albertville Games , and a silver in the 30-kilometer freestyle Monday , earned his first gold before the home folks , winning the men ' s 10-kilometer classical race in something of an upset . Norwegian skiers have won three of the six men ' s cross-country medals that have been awarded and figure to win a_few more . And Lyubov Egorova , winner of three gold medals and two silvers in ' 92 , won her second consecutive gold -- and third medal here -- in the women ' s 10-kilometer freestyle pursuit race . With her eight medals , Egorova is two shy of the Winter Games record . Raisa Smetanina , another Russian cross-country skier , won 10 in five Olympic appearances . Daehlie , who has a habit of fading in the sprints , hung_in this time , beating not only highly regarded teammates Sture Sivertsen , the world champion at the distance , and Vegard Ulvang , the ' 92 gold medalist , but the best of the rest of the world as well . His all-out finish -- he collapsed in a heap after crossing the line -- moved Daehlie into the lead . Then he watched nervously as first Marco Albarello of Italy , then Vladimir Smirnov of Kazakhstan , came_up short . Daehlie finally relaxed when Ulvang came_into view with no chance of winning . Daehlie ' s time , 24 minutes 20.1 seconds , was more_than 18 seconds better than silver medalist Smirnov ' s 24:38.3. Albarello was third in 24:42.3. Sivertsen was fifth , Ulvang seventh . &quot; I ' ve had problems with the 10 kilometers , starting too hard and always being very tired at the end , &quot; Daehlie said . &quot; Today , I felt I was going really fast , and I expected to be tired . But the last two kilometers , I thought it would be between Vladimir and me , and I knew I would really have to push myself . &quot; It ' s fantastic . With all_the Norwegians here ( probably more_than 50 # 000 at the race ) , this is a big moment for me. &quot; Egorova continued her ongoing duel with Manuela Di Centa of Italy . They had swapped first and second places in the first two races , Di Centa beating Egorova in Sunday ' s 15-kilometer freestyle event , then Egorova beating Di Centa in the five-kilometer classical event Tuesday . The times in Tuesday ' s race established the starting intervals for Thursday ' s pursuit race , Egorova starting first with a 19-second advantage over the second-starting Di Centa . It was then up_to Di Centa , and the rest of the field , to catch Egorova . Both Di Centa and bronze medalist Stefania Belmondo , also of Italy , skied the 10k faster than Egorova , but couldn ' t catch her because of the differences she had established in the earlier race . Egorova finished Thursday ' s race in 27:30.1 for a two-race time of 41:38.9. Di Centa had times of 27:18.4 and 41:46.7 , and Belmondo , fastest in the 10k at 27:17.1 , totaled 42:21.1. &quot; I was worried when I looked over my shoulder and saw ( Di Centa and Belmondo ) coming , but I thought I could hold my rhythm , &quot; Egorova said . And she did .</TEXT>
