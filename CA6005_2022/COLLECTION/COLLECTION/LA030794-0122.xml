   <HEADLINE> OUT FROM THE SHADOW ; YOLANDA KING SPENT HER YOUTH TRYING TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR HER FATHER , THE LATE MARTIN_LUTHER KING JR . NOW , SHE SAYS , ' I ONLY SPEAK FOR MYSELF. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Students at Inglewood ' s Morningside High gathered around Yolanda King the other day , seeking her pronouncements on Louis Farrakhan , Jesse Jackson , violence versus nonviolence and other subjects . The eldest child of the late Dr. Martin_Luther_King Jr . answered each politely but reluctantly . She does not try to influence public_opinion , she explained later . &quot; I only speak_for myself ; I only represent myself . I do not represent any group , or the black community , or women or even my father. &quot; She respects Farrakhan for having &quot; probably saved many young lives , &quot; but she is pleased that African American leaders are repudiating some of his attitudes . Jesse Jackson , she tells a student , is &quot; working inside the system. &quot; And she is passionately in favor of nonviolence . But her talk to the student body , as part of the school ' s celebration of Black History Month , was apolitical and focused_on the individual instead of social issues . It was based on one of her father ' s early sermons , stressing the importance of &quot; healthy self-love ; sharing that love with others , and the value of a connection to a higher power. &quot; King , 38 , an actress and producer , regularly speaks at high_schools and colleges to honor her father ' s accomplishments and memory . She carries_on his legacy , she said , but not exactly in the way most people expect . She gave_up trying to fulfill others ' expectations long ago . * Yolanda King was thrust into the role of successor at age 12 , when she turned_on the TV and learned that her father had been assassinated . First there were family concerns . She ' d spent more time with her father and knew him better than her three siblings , so she felt obligated to pass her knowledge on to them . But the outside world usually seemed to expect more of her than she could deliver . She felt pressured ; she felt guilty . &quot; For a long_time I went_back and forth between trying to please everyone and trying to be a real person. &quot; The pleaser usually won . In high_school , she recalled , she tried to &quot; just blend_in , just be accepted , just be like everyone else. &quot; But as the daughter of a slain icon , she was expected to be stronger , wiser , more politically correct than &quot; ordinary &quot; kids her age . For example , since age 8 she ' d been enrolled in what was then the only integrated drama school in Atlanta , run_by Walt Roberts , father of actress Julia Roberts . But when she played in a teen-age production of &quot; The Owl and the Pussycat &quot; in 1972 , she said , her hometown erupted . &quot; I was 15 , my co-star was white , and the white community criticized it because they didn ' t think ( mixing the races ) was right . &quot; The black community asked : ' How could you disgrace your dead father ' s image by playing the role of a prostitute ? ' &quot; The furor was so great that King said she was forced to stand_up at church one Sunday and explain her actions to the whole congregation . By the time she reached Smith College , her father ' s public image had grown even more immense , along with expectations placed upon his daughter . While most young_women her age were finding their own talents and goals , King said she was trying to be what the world wanted -- a substitute for her father . &quot; I was asked to join this , do that , work with all sorts of groups . It was a tremendous burden because people expected me to automatically know things , to have opinions and answers I didn ' t have , &quot; she said . &quot; When you come from this tremendous tradition , you feel obligated to pick it up and charge ahead . But I was floundering . It wasn ' t happening . I was in a hole and couldn ' t get_out . I had no idea what I was good at , how I could contribute -- or how to feel comfortable about myself . &quot; I ' d do press_conferences and people would ask me about the state of the world and what we should do about big social problems . For a very long_time , I never said , ' I don ' t know. ' I thought that would mean I was inept or inadequate. &quot; About age 22 , she said , she finally understood she ' d been &quot; putting_up a front &quot; and could no longer handle it . &quot; I realized there are lots of things I simply just don ' t know , and I needed to be able to admit that to myself and others . It ' s great to be able to say , ' I ' m not sure ; what do you think ? ' &quot; * King said it took her &quot; a little longer &quot; than most people to get where she is today -- &quot; which is a really peaceful place . I know what I love to do , and what I do well. &quot; She was co-founder , with Attallah Shabazz ( daughter of Malcolm X ) , of the Nucleus Theatre Company , which provides inspirational programs for schools and colleges . A one-woman show , &quot; Tracks , &quot; which she produced and in which she plays all 16 characters , has toured the country . She said she sees the play as an affirmation of her father ' s philosophy of the importance of each individual in a socially responsible society . A Denver Post critic lauded &quot; Tracks , &quot; calling King ' s performance remarkable . When it played in 1992 at the Kennedy Center in Washington , D.C. , a Washington Post critic wrote : &quot; Although no Lily Tomlin , the actress exhibits a real flair for speech_patterns and telling gestures . . . . King should have enough faith in her powerful stage presence to pare_down , simplify and avoid the melodramatic and the maudlin. &quot; She hopes to bring the production to Los Angeles . King is working_on a feature_film about her mother , Coretta Scott King , who was an activist &quot; before she ever met my father . It was not an accident that they came together. &quot; And it was no accident that she , her sister and two brothers turned_out to be achievers , she said . It was_due to her mother ' s consistency : &quot; One brother is a successful businessman , another is in Georgia politics , my sister is both a lawyer and a minister . We all live_in Atlanta still , and we are all very close . Tragedy does that -- it brings you even closer. &quot; King &quot; can ' t imagine not being married and not having children. &quot; &quot; I ' ve dated all sorts -- white guys , Jewish guys and , of course , primarily African American guys . But when I settle_down , I want to know without a doubt that this is forever -- I haven ' t come_across such a relationship yet. &quot; * She still grapples with some memory_loss surrounding the years after her father ' s death , created by what she explains as &quot; a blocking mechanism &quot; that the mind sets_up to erase tragedy . She ' s &quot; trying to resurrect &quot; those memories . At some point , she said , she may share her recollections with others . Back at Morningside High , King said the student question that pleased her most was personal : &quot; If your father came_back today , what is the first thing you ' d say to him ? &quot; &quot; I told her I ' d never even asked that of myself , &quot; she said . &quot; I had to think_about it. &quot; Then , recalling the simple , playful moments when her father hugged her and let her know she was loved , King told the student : &quot; I ' d probably just tell him how much I miss being able to feel him , really feel him. &quot;</TEXT>
