   <HEADLINE> ARCHITECTURE : WHAT ' S GOING_UP IN MEXICO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Little is known in this country about contemporary Mexican architecture . Apart from monographs on Luis Barragan , who died in 1988 , Ricardo Legorreta , who recently rebuilt Pershing Square , and Abraham Zabludovsky , there are almost no books on the subject . An exhibition through Sunday at Cal State Fullerton apparently is only the third in the United States to look_at what Mexican architects are doing south of the border . Why is this , and is the deficiency Mexico ' s or our own ? In a country where building has had to keep pace with a 73 % increase in population in the past 20 years , there isn ' t a shortage of new projects in Mexico to write_about . The absence of information suggests a lack of excellence , or that we are shamefully ignorant of it . that ' s the starting_point for &quot; Myth and Modernism in Mexican Architecture , &quot; curated by graduate_students Karen Collins and Pollyanna Nordstrand . It looks_at 10 of Mexico ' s leading architects and tries to explain something of their thinking ; through it we can learn why North and Central_America fail to engage . Mexico shares the dilemma of every foreign country in the 20th Century : how to handle the fact that it ' s not the United States . In architecture , this has led to a duality . Some architects want to be part of global currents ; others want to say something specifically Mexican . Between the two positions , there is confusion . Zabludovsky , for example , creates scaleless abstract works with huge concrete slabs and powerful diagonals . His aesthetic and the way he talks_about it belong_to mainstream U.S. commercial architecture of the 1970s . Some , however , see in it a fundamental Mexican heaviness that echoes the work of Le Corbusier ( for whom his former partner , Teodoro Gonzalez de Leon , once worked ) but that finds a niche in the land of the Aztec pyramid . Agustin Hernandez , by contrast , is a passionate advocate of pre-Hispanic art . He often uses Indian motifs as a starting point for his designs and believes_in the search for national identity . But this is not apparent from his work . His daring , futuristic buildings could be settings for sci-fi movies . The exhibition is intrigued by this ambivalence . The curators , who are not architects , are sympathetic to the idea of an authentic Mexican architecture -- the &quot; Myth &quot; of the exhibition ' s title -- and have gone looking_for it among Mexico ' s most worldly and sophisticated architects . Their conclusion is that it doesn ' t exist . What does exist is a large body of conventional , modern buildings by a relatively elderly architectural establishment . The two younger architects in the show , Enrique Norten and Alberto Kalach , have more stylistic pizazz but also relate more to international trends than to national influences . Their stage is New York , Barcelona and Milan , not Mexico_City . Collins and Nordstrand elaborate on this . Mexico ' s adoption of modern architecture in the 1920s , they observe , was linked to the social reforms that followed the 1910 Revolution . The idea was that architects would build a modern society by building a modern architecture . Few now believe this , yet Mexico ' s architects remain loyal to the modernist aesthetic . An accompanying essay by Mexican architectural critic Louise Noelle explains this loyalty in terms of the work it has produced . Noelle sees three post- ' 60s tendencies -- Brutalism , Futurism and Cubism by any other name -- contributing to a rich mix of Mexican architecture . Twenty years ago , that would have been something to boast about . An American looking_at the exhibit might complain that Mexican architecture is dragging its feet . that ' s partly because we have grown used to exhibitions and publications that only deal with innovation . Historian Shelly Kappe , who curated the first show of Mexican architecture ( in 1981 ) , says all serious architects , not just those in Mexico , have been suppressed in the past 15 years in favor of the merely fashionable . The show at Fullerton is in fact very like hers . But Collins and Nordstrand have underplayed the latest trends in Mexican architecture . An exhibition that focused_on the next generation would have made Mexico look more exciting , or at least more competitive . The studios called TAX ( Taller de Arquitectura X ) and TEN ( Taller de Enrique Norten ) , only touched_on in Fullerton , do_well alongside the chic historicists and deconstructivists of Europe and America . * In neglecting them , the curators may have been ill-advised by the established figures whom they visited in Mexico_City in June , but this itself is revealing . For 65 years , Mexico has been run_by the same political_party , giving_rise to old-boy networks and inevitable stagnation . The absence of new faces from this exhibition bears_out the perceived conservatism of Mexican architecture . There are different ways of viewing this . While Kappe welcomes the survival of Mexico ' s long-term players , USC professor John Mutlow , now writing a book on the New Architecture of Mexico for Rizzoli , sees it as partly retrograde . His book excludes two older exhibitors in the Fullerton show , Alejandro Zohn and Enrique Murillo , for not deserving the national honors they have won . He further points to rote teaching at Mexico ' s overpopulated architecture schools and the conformity that this produces among students . He cites the lack of advanced materials and building techniques found abroad . Mexican architecture is still pre-industrial , he says . Agustin Landa and Carlos Mijares use brick vaulting where U.S. architects would roof in steel . Norten ' s perforated metal sheeting has to be perforated by hand . Armies of laborers use chisels instead of jackhammers to provide Zabludovsky with his trademark rough concrete surfaces . Even the modernism of Mexico is imitative . America does not look_to Mexico for new architecture -- perhaps because , as Mexico ' s Nobel Prize-winning writer and critic Octavio Paz has suggested , America doesn ' t think it can learn from a country that didn ' t see the point of the New World . Mexico is equally conflicted . Many countries regard the concept of &quot; progress &quot; as interchangeable with &quot; Americanization. &quot; For Mexico in particular , this makes_it a mixed blessing . Collins and Nordstrand miss out on one other area of architectural interest . &quot; I hate to say this , &quot; says Norberto Nardi , an Italian-Argentinian architect whose course in Latin_American architecture at Cal Poly Pomona is the only one of its kind in the U.S. , &quot; but developers appear to be the best interpreters of public taste . They ' ve realized that the Mediterranean style is very popular. &quot; Architects may_not take this seriously , but the public does . And that , after all , has been the story of architecture in the past 15 years . Mexican architecture also has dramatic appeal , notes Nardi , whose book &quot; Bridging the New World &quot; will be appearing next year . &quot; Mexican architecture is in many ways still about Spanish and pre-Columbian grandeur , &quot; he says . &quot; It ' s big ; it uses expensive natural materials and has spectacular finishes. &quot; What makes Mexico ' s achievements possible , Nardi writes , are its low labor costs , the extraordinarily skillful artisans and the lax ( and sometimes corrupt ) building_codes , which also enhance its sculptural possibilities . Barragan ' s famous cantilevered staircase without a handrail never would have been allowed_in the U.S. , says Nardi , adding : &quot; Public safety can be asphyxiating. &quot; The show at Fullerton was meant primarily as a student exercise in exhibition design . It deserves credit for this and for surviving the headaches of shipping . Its very success , however , gives it a public voice . This is significant . As exhibition design grows_into an independent profession , its purpose becomes cloudier . However neutral it may try to be , an exhibition always offers a point_of_view . It is important that curators work with people who really know their field and understand the impact of what they include or omit . * &quot; Myths and Modernism in Mexican Architecture &quot; continues through Dec . 11 at the Main Art_Gallery , Cal State Fullerton , 800 N . State College Blvd. , Fullerton . Noon to 4 p.m. Monday , Tuesday and Thursday ; 3 to 7 p.m. Wednesday ; 2 to 5 p.m. Sunday . $ 3 . ( 714 ) 773-3262 .</TEXT>
