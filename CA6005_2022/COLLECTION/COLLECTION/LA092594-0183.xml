   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON RELIEF ; FIRST_AID FOR A SUFFERING WORLD ; DISASTERS KEEP ARISING ANEW WITH URGENT CLAIMS ON HUMANITARIAN AID -- A TASK THE U.N. WAS ONCE READY TO TAKE_ON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Imagine Los Angeles with a volunteer fire_department . Imagine California not requiring skyscrapers to be earthquake-resistant . Imagine south Florida with no hurricane emergency evacuation plan . Now , imagine a world racked by emergencies of unprecedented scale with no disaster prevention and response capacity . For the people of Rwanda , as for the people of Somalia and Bosnia , Haiti and the Sudan , there is no need to imagine the result : The unnecessary deaths are all too real . The drumbeat of major human disasters that accelerated several years ago should have put the international community on notice that it is time for a systematic , preventive response to large-scale emergencies . But rather than responding with visionary , forward-looking programs , the United Nations and its leading member countries -- the United States , the European community and Japan -- continue to respond in an uncoordinated , delayed , ad_hoc fashion . This collective failure to take action to save lives borders_on the criminal . This was to have changed two years ago with the creation of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs within the United Nations . The DHA , created partly in response to U.S. pressure , was supposed to become the global mechanism for emergency coordination . Its director was appointed by and would report directly to the U.N. secretary_general . The DHA would bring order out of chaos , providing early warning information , mobilizing donor governments for emergency programs and coordinating the various U.N. and government_agencies that respond to distress . To date , the DHA has been a failure . Even though Secretary_General Boutros Boutros-Ghali was instrumental in the conception and creation of the agency , he has not provided the financial and institutional support required to fulfill its mandate . In the Somali emergency , it became evident quickly that DHA had no power and that the U.N. agencies normally involved in emergency response -- the World Food Program , UNICEF , the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees -- could avoid DHA coordination without sanction . In recent crises , including Rwanda , the agency has been virtually invisible . There is also a United Nations Disaster Relief Organization . Its main functions apparently are to issue information_bulletins and hold conferences . International non-governmental organizations tend to have more advance warning of disaster , work much more effectively through indigenous institutions in the affected communities and devise more creative programs than either the United Nations or governments . But their collective capacity is far too small to mount the required comprehensive response . As for governments , they tend to act unilaterally in emergency situations , with the timing and the content of the response driven by domestic political considerations rather than needs on the ground . In a world in which major humanitarian disasters occur frequently , the international community can no longer conduct itself as if emergencies are an aberration . Corrective action is imperative . The secretary_general , with support of the leading industrialized countries , must invigorate the Department of Humanitarian Affairs , giving it the staff and budget necessary to carry_out its core functions : planning for long-term disaster prevention and coordinating the international response to acute emergencies . A re-empowered DHA will need permanent resources . Concrete initiatives should include prepositioning emergency supplies ( food , water-supply equipment , oral rehydration salts , tents , blankets , latrines ) in DHA-managed warehouses in logistical hubs in disaster prone regions . The agency must staff these disaster units with trained personnel , permanently equipped with transportation and logistical materials . When not responding to an immediate emergency , the staff of these units would engage in training for local_governments and non-governmental organizations in disaster preparedness . They would also function as the ongoing human early-warning system for the United Nations and the international community , alerting the appropriate powers to looming emergencies and taking initial preventive measures . This approach would link humanitarian response to long-term peace and development . Every recent humanitarian disaster has had a political dimension . Mass suffering is inextricably tried to political failure . The weakness of the United Nations in the area of peacekeeping is also acute , as we have seen in Rwanda with hundreds of thousands of deaths after the withdrawal and subsequent failure to reintroduce U.N. peacekeepers . As the world focuses appropriately on the disaster in Rwanda , serious food shortages are looming in the Horn of Africa and the south , with as_many as 7 million people potentially at risk from drought . Humanitarian problems of this magnitude are a regular feature of life in the global community for the foreseeable future . Absent a significant investment in disaster prevention and response , images of suffering will continue to assault the world with depressing regularity . The failure to respond in time is not the result of compassion fatigue or lack of media attention or funds -- the usual excuses -- but of incompetence and failure to address a critical systems failure in the international humanitarian system . The United Nations , with active moral and practical leadership from the United States and the other industrialized countries -- must take_on this effort as its responsibility to the vulnerable members of the world community .</TEXT>
