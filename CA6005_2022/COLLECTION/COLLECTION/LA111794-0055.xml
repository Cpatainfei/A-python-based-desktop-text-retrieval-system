   <HEADLINE> POP ; BACK TO THE BEAT ; THE GO-GO ' S BATTLE THOSE BUBBLY MEDIA TAGS TO RETURN , NINE YEARS AFTER THE BREAKUP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Playing media tag is one of the prerogatives of being a rock_star . But once tagged with a simple &quot; it , &quot; a snappy , easy-to-digest image suitable for mass-retailing , &quot; it &quot; may be all_the star is perceived to be . The Go-Go ' s were rock ' s &quot; it &quot; girls of the early ' 80s : the first all-female band ever to make_it big . They were celebrated for their fun-loving charm , for their best-buddies camaraderie , and for the garagey pop songs that propelled their first album , &quot; Beauty and the Beat , &quot; to a six-week stay_at the top of the charts . Looking_back , Charlotte Caffey , the lead guitarist , reduces the Go-Go ' s defining &quot; it &quot; to three words that she mouths with a blend of frustration , irony , and what-can-you-do-about-it resignation . &quot; Cute , bubbly , effervescent. &quot; The words practically hang there in quotation_marks above the cushy gray couch where Caffey sits in a North Hollywood rehearsal room , flanked by two fellow Go-Go ' s , rhythm guitarist Jane Wiedlin and bassist Kathy Valentine . In front of them on a wooden coffee_table lies the Aug . 5 , 1982 , edition of Rolling Stone magazine , the one with the cover photo of five young_women horsing_around in chaste white undies , like junior_high_school girls at a slumber_party . The headline , blocked_out in pink letters , reads , &quot; Go-Go ' s Put Out. &quot; It might as well have said , &quot; Tag , You ' re It. &quot; The Go-Go ' s are not reluctant to dissect their past misadventures in the image-retailing game . &quot; It ' s not that we weren ' t that way , but there were other sides to us , &quot; Caffey says . The argument is partly supported by the 1981-vintage &quot; Beauty and the Beat , &quot; which had its moments of winking irony to go_with the cute , frothy stuff , and it is completely clinched by the darker , troubled tone of the band ' s third and last album before their breakup in 1985 , the critically esteemed but commercially disappointing &quot; Talk_Show &quot; ( 1984 ) . &quot; I ' m still trying to sort_out in my mind how much we were responsible_for it , &quot; ventures Valentine . &quot; Society was going , ' Here ' s a successful girl band. ' It ' s almost like we couldn ' t be accepted and embraced . . . &quot; &quot; Unless we were non-threatening , &quot; Wiedlin finishes the thought . &quot; If we had been angry , it would n ' t have worked. &quot; &quot; that ' s what ' s so great now , &quot; Valentine resumes . &quot; Women ( rockers ) are accepted as being sexual , angry , crude -- all_the things it was acceptable for guys to be all along. &quot; Seasoned by past pitfalls , cognizant of present possibilities , the Go-Go ' s are back . While the three guitar-playing members expounded last week during a pre-rehearsal interview , drummer Gina Schock , who had brought_in the Rolling Stone copy so the band could autograph it for a friend , stepped_out for a long break after concluding that they were having no problem handling questions without her . Singer Belinda Carlisle , who emerged as a glossy , slick-sounding pop diva after the Go-Go ' s broke_up , had an excused absence : she had just flown in from France , where she now lives with her film_producer husband and their toddler son , and was being given the day_off to recuperate from jet-lag . The immediate cause of the band ' s return is the recent release of &quot; Return to the Valley of the Go-Go ' s , &quot; a double-disc retrospective of hits and rarities . As they did_in 1990 , when they regrouped for the first time to play an environmental benefit_concert and promote the release of a greatest hits package , the Go-Go ' s will do a short tour , which begins Sunday at the Coach_House , and also includes shows Dec . 1 and 2 at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles . Vicki Peterson , the former Bangles guitarist , will fill_in for the six-months ' -pregnant Caffey , who decided it would be best to avoid the rigors of the road and concert stage until after her February due-date . This time , the Go-Go ' s aim to keep their reunion going . The members say that touring in 1990 enabled them to get_over whatever hurt feelings remained from the band ' s bitter initial split . When they heard that their old label , I.R.S. Records , was preparing a more complete retrospective release , the Go-Go ' s , who weren ' t happy with the 1990 hits package , decided to reconvene for the sake of quality_control , and to top_off the album with new material that brings the story of the band full-circle . &quot; This retrospective was going_to be put_out with or without our involvement , and it was a perfect excuse to get_together again , &quot; Carlisle said in a phone interview the day after the missed rehearsal . The band members dipped_into their personal archives for tapes of early gigs and rehearsals , thereby casting fresh light on the Go-Go ' s origins on the Los Angeles punk scene in 1978-79 . They also wrote nine new songs and recorded three of them for the album : &quot; Good Girl , &quot; &quot; Beautiful , &quot; and &quot; The Whole World Lost Its Head , &quot; which has been made into a video . All are catchy , overtly ironic garage-pop fare ; the revived band features a Carlisle who sings in a more burry and expressive voice than she could muster a decade ago . Pleased with the results , the five Go-Go ' s say they want to press_on . &quot; It inspires us to want to make another record together , &quot; said Carlisle , who also plans to record her sixth solo album early next year . &quot; that ' s a big possibility down the line . I don ' t know about any heavy touring schedule ; everybody has their families and their own projects . But there ' s definitely time to get_together and at least write , spend the next year coming_up with new material and recording it at the end of the year or whatever . It ' s a very feasible thing to do. &quot; Reunions such_as the Go-Go ' s ' are also a very trendy thing to do . With nostalgia dawning for ' 80s New Wave music ( an inevitability , now that the high_school class of ' 81 has pushed past 30 ) , it could prove the most commercially feasible thing to do as well . Take_into_account the fact that the post-Go-Go ' s careers of Caffey , Wiedlin , Valentine and Schock have been fitful at best , and that Carlisle ' s solo sales have dwindled following the gold and platinum success of her first three albums , and there is no shortage of potential ammunition for scoffers who want to level charges of opportunism . The Go-Go ' s hope to arm themselves against such attack with persuasive new songs . &quot; The way I keep looking_at it , there are opportunities that keep coming_to bring us back together , and this time we ' re not going_to fight it , &quot; says Caffey , invoking fate . &quot; When something feels really good and right , we go_by our instincts , &quot; adds Wiedlin . &quot; The only way we ' ll know if the Go-Go ' s have artistic validity or mean anything is to do a record , &quot; Valentine says , putting_in the final word on whether the Go-Go ' s story merits a second act . &quot; We made ourselves really happy with ( the new songs ) we ' ve recorded . I don ' t want to feel we have something to prove. &quot; The Go-Go ' s retake the field at a time when the prevailing mood in rock has swung_around to the opposite of cute , bubbly and effervescent . As the band ' s comeback single remarks in passing , with some satisfaction , &quot; punk_rock isn ' t dead. &quot; And some of those young punks , with their songs glowering and noisy , might be inclined to write_off the Go-Go ' s as lightweights . Wiedlin says she is pleased that the new retrospective chronicles the band ' s punk origins . At the same time , she acknowledges , the image that set_in later could be something &quot; to overcome , almost. &quot; The otherwise affable Caffey sharpens her tone and throws_in some well-enunciated expletives at the thought that the Go-Go ' s might be given anything but respect for their part in breaking_down the old stereotype that groupie and chick singer were the only positions in rock for which women need apply . &quot; Against all odds and obstructions in our way , we were just doing_it . We didn ' t necessarily write_about women ' s rights or talk_about it . We were just doing_it . If you want to call punk an attitude , it ' s still with us . Being in a band is being punk , no matter what . You have to dedicate your life to it. &quot; The Go-Go ' s applaud the attention being given to Liz Phair , L7 , Hole , and others in the parade of women rockers who have become prominent in the ' 90s . And they say they don ' t worry if those musicians neglect to cite the Go-Go ' s ' contribution . Valentine says she never gave credit to the Go-Go ' s ' female predecessors , such_as the Runaways , the teen-age glam-rock band of the mid- ' 70s that was put_together as a novelty by a record producer . &quot; But to be totally honest , when I saw the Runaways , I was totally jealous , &quot; she recalled . &quot; I wanted to be in the band . Suzi Quatro -- I flipped out . I never gave them credit when we were doing interviews , so I don ' t blame ( ' 90s women ) now &quot; if they gloss_over the Go-Go ' s when they talk_about influences . &quot; I ' d like to get_to the point where there ' s never a women-in-rock article again , &quot; Valentine concluded . &quot; But we were the first ones to have some success , to reach No . 1 , and that belongs in a women-in-rock article. &quot; In their first run , whatever measure of dedication and pioneering spirit the Go-Go ' s possessed was ultimately not enough to withstand the pressures of being young and suddenly famous . Infighting set_in , and Caffey and Carlisle later admitted that they were hampered by serious substance_abuse problems . Wiedlin was the first to leave , in 1984 . Caffey and Carlisle gave_up drugs , then decided upon sober reflection that they didn ' t want to be Go-Go ' s any more . They declared the band finis in the spring of ' 85 , to the considerable chagrin of Valentine and Schock . Carlisle went_on to her solo successes , bringing along Caffey as a songwriting collaborator and a member of her backing band . Caffey , who is married to Jeff McDonald , singer of the thrash-pop band , Redd Kross , also formed an all-female band , the Graces , which released an album in 1989 . Schock ' s solo career amounted to just one record , the 1988 release , &quot; House of Schock. &quot; Wiedlin , who now lives_in the San Diego County community of Escondido , put_out three solo albums between 1985 and 1990 , then decided to take some time_off before resuming her songwriting about a year ago . Valentine vacillated between hard rock and traditional blues and R &amp; B , and still hasn ' t managed to put_out an album . Carlisle , meanwhile , says she has focused primarily on the European market in recent years . In January , she left Los Angeles for a country home_in the south of France . Back in Los Angeles last week , she spent a morning doing demos for another glossy solo album ( she says the European audience didn ' t go_for the somewhat less slick ' 60s-influenced sound of her 1993 album , &quot; Real , &quot; so she ' s returning to the mainstream pop stuff ) , then turned_up at an afternoon rehearsal to acclimate herself once more to rocking with the Go-Go ' s . On the phone afterward , she said she has no problem going_back and forth between two distant stylistic poles . &quot; It ' s two separate things I love doing , &quot; she said . &quot; I love the sort of raunchy pop ( that the Go-Go ' s play ) , that garagey sound , and I love the classic pop song , which is what I grew_up with on the radio . It ' s not hard switching gears at all . The Go-Go ' s sometimes feels far more comfortable than being_on my own . It ' s the comfort of having four other people up there. &quot; This time , the Go-Go ' s have a strategy for not having five different people falling_into the kinds of internecine struggles that destroyed the band the first time around . &quot; Our formative years were just a pressure_cooker , &quot; Wiedlin said . &quot; We don ' t want to have that again . You have to take_care of each other , otherwise this machine just eats you alive. &quot; Back then , the members were in their early to mid-20s . &quot; We used to do every single thing we were told , &quot; Valentine said , which led to a frazzling pace of recording and touring . &quot; We had no experience at all . We thought it ' s what every band did , &quot; Caffey added . &quot; It was insane. &quot; Now the Go-Go ' s are in their mid-30s , except for Caffey , a still-fresh-looking 40 . Their second go at being a recording band figures to be more stable and settled . &quot; Now , &quot; Valentine says , &quot; We can say , ' We need to take a weekend off. ' We know we ' re not going_to ruin our careers or the success of the record . We ' re just reserving the right to say no. &quot; Carlisle agrees that a low stress quotient is vital if a reunion is to take . &quot; We ' re not putting any pressure on ourselves . We don ' t have any concrete game_plan . We just have the desire to do a record , and we ' re winging it as we go_along . Getting serious and intense about it is going_to take the enjoyment out . I want to have fun with it. &quot; In their rehearsal room , fun and mutual acceptance seem to be running strong . Wiedlin , a pixie-like woman who looks young enough in her knit ski_cap and flannel shirt to play Winona Ryder ' s kid sister , starts the interview by admonishing Valentine : &quot; You ' re picking . Stop it. &quot; Valentine takes this bit of mothering ( or is it older-sistering ? ) without annoyance . &quot; No I ' m not . I ' m stroking my chin. &quot; Later , as they run_through their live set ( sans Carlisle ' s singing ) , the two will join in a kick-step game of footsie as they knock_out the beat of &quot; We Got the Beat. &quot; Schock , who looked as if she had gotten_up too early when she first walked in , is now smiling as she slams crisply on her kit . During breaks , she is ready with salty quips . Peterson , the substitute player , is all diligence and serious concentration as she works to get_down her parts . Caffey plays the coach , listening from the couch while holding a pad full of song titles jotted in blue ink , occasionally suggesting changes in the song order . &quot; It ' s cool to watch , &quot; she says of her new vantage_point on the sidelines . The other day , she recalled , &quot; I was saying , ' Yeah , it ' s a great band. ' I was gonna cry . . . &quot; Whereupon Valentine , overhearing the expectant mom , spun_around and gave her a hug . &quot; . . . but maybe it ' s ' cause I ' m all hormonal. &quot; * Who : The Go-Go ' s . * When : Sunday , Nov . 20 , at 8 p.m. * Where : The Coach_House , 33157 Camino Capistrano , San Juan Capistrano . * Whereabouts : Take the San Diego ( 5 ) Freeway to the San Juan Creek Road exit and turn left onto Camino Capistrano .
