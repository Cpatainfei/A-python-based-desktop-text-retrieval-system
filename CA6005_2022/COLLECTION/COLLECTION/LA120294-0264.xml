   <HEADLINE> RAPIST FAILS MENTAL TEST , WON ' T BE FREED ; PRISONS : REGINALD MULDREW WILL TAKE EXAM AGAIN IN SIX MONTHS , OFFICIALS SAY . LAW SAYS HE MUST BE RELEASED IN A YEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Serial rapist Reginald Donald Muldrew , whose pending parole stirred tremendous protests by San Gabriel Valley residents , failed his psychiatric exam and will not be released from state_prison as scheduled , state corrections officials said Thursday . He will probably remain in prison for at least six more months . Muldrew becomes the sixth sex offender since March whose parole has been blocked by the inability to pass a last-minute psychiatric evaluation . Corrections officials have begun using the tactic in what some of them admit is a desperate attempt to keep offenders in custody . Under the state ' s determinate sentencing law -- originally passed to keep judges from issuing lenient sentences -- prisoners must be let_out of prison after a specific number of years . Muldrew , a suspect in 200 rapes in the Los Angeles area during the 1970s , has been in prison for 15 years . Department of Corrections officials said Muldrew , 46 , known as the &quot; pillowcase rapist &quot; because he put pillowcases and similar pieces_of_cloth over his victims ' heads , suffers from a mental_disorder that makes him a danger to others and for which treatment is not available in the community . Spokesman Bill Gengler said he could not comment specifically on the mental_disorder involved . Muldrew was scheduled to be paroled Sunday in Covina . Covina police and city officials launched a campaign to block Muldrew ' s parole after being told by corrections officials that Muldrew was going_to live_in Covina . State officials never confirmed a specific city of residence . About 20 # 000 signatures were collected on petitions demanding that Muldrew be kept_in custody . &quot; This shows what citizens can do when they organize together to oppose something they don ' t believe_in , &quot; Covina Mayor Thomas M . O ' Leary said . A hearing will be conducted in about 30 days to determine whether Muldrew should have his parole revoked and be kept_in prison for psychiatric treatment . The hearings are generally formalities that confirm the decision to revoke parole . If all goes as expected , Muldrew would remain in prison for six months , then undergo another psychiatric exam , Gengler said . &quot; There probably is not an instance where someone has failed ( the psychiatric exam ) and six months later has passed it , &quot; Gengler said . Regardless , a year from now Muldrew must be released because his prison and parole terms will have expired . At that point , he can move wherever he chooses as long as he registers with local police as a sex offender . &quot; There is nothing that the Department of Corrections can do to retain Muldrew &quot; after the year is up , Gengler said . One woman who said she was raped by Muldrew expressed relief Thursday about the flunked exam , but worried that she and other victims would have to go_through the same anxiety in six months . &quot; Obviously , the system works for criminals , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' m laughing , I guess because I don ' t want to cry to think that he could be free. &quot; Muldrew was convicted on six counts of sexual_assault and numerous other felonies in 1978 and is suspected by police of having committed more_than 200 rapes and 150 robberies in Los Angeles from 1975 to 1978 . Among the tactics used by Covina officials to keep Muldrew out of their community were protest rallies and soliciting victims of Muldrew who live within 35 miles of Covina . Under state law , parolees cannot be released within 35 miles of their victims or those who testified against them in court . Art Lucero , deputy regional parole administrator , said the state decided to perform the psychiatric evaluation partly because of the extreme violence involved in the crimes for which Muldrew was convicted . He at times beat and punched his victims , or put_out cigarettes on their skin . Lucero said he was not sure whether Muldrew had a history of mental_illness before his crimes . Muldrew was transferred from Pelican Bay_State Prison in Northern California to the state_prison in Lancaster on Monday in preparation for his parole . The psychiatric exam was completed Wednesday . He has also served time at San Quentin , where he was a suspect in the 1971 murder of a prison_guard but was not prosecuted . Since March , five other high-profile sex offenders in Southern California have failed eleventh-hour psychiatric exams and been returned to prison . In four cases , the mental_health exams were administered on the day of the sex offender ' s release from prison . But in Muldrew ' s case and one other , rapist David Stanley Lee , corrections officials did not wait for the parole date . Instead , Muldrew and Lee underwent psychiatric exams while they were still in prison . Under the 1977 determinate sentencing law , sex offenders are released on a predetermined date without having to go before a parole board for clearance . Corrections officials say they only recently reinterpreted the little-known state code that allows psychiatric testing of parolees . The code does not specify when the evaluations can be administered . Critics of the state ' s new policy complain that the decision to release inmates has been taken_away from the parole board and left in the hands of a single psychiatrist . About 40 Antelope Valley residents who had gathered Thursday afternoon at Lancaster City Park to protest Muldrew ' s release applauded loudly when organizers announced that the rapist would remain in prison . The rally was organized after Antelope Valley residents learned Muldrew had been transferred to the Lancaster prison and feared that he might be paroled in their neighborhood .
