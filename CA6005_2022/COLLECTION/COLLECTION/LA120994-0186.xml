   <HEADLINE> COMPANY TOWN ; GERMAN MAKES WAVES BY COURTING HOLLYWOOD ; BROADCASTING : HELMUT THOMA RUNS EUROPE ' S MOST SUCCESSFUL COMMERCIAL TELEVISION COMPANY , AND BUCKS THE RULES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As managing director of RTL , Germany ' s leading commercial broadcast company , Helmut Thoma has always gone his own way . He ' s a compatriot of Arnold Schwarzenegger and is the person responsible_for introducing David Hasselhoff and the &quot; Baywatch &quot; phenomenon to Europe . Now Thoma is bucking the tide again by wooing Hollywood in a major way , just as most of his European colleagues are piling_up the sandbags in a bid to turn_back the American cultural invasion . As the European Union was revealing plans to change the Broadcasting Without Frontiers directive to further restrict U.S. programming in November , Thoma was building business ties_in New York . He is unapologetic about his pursuit of Hollywood , saying : &quot; RTL has always striven to emulate American strategy and structure in our own network . We have gotten where we are today by investing lots of money in American know-how and American partners. &quot; This approach is not popular in Europe . Current EU regulations say European broadcasters must carry a majority of European programming &quot; where practicable. &quot; That left a loophole for channels like RTL , which are dominated by U.S. programming . But the draft EU plan revealed in November removes the &quot; where practicable &quot; phrase and forces member countries to comply . For U.S. television , the stakes in Germany are massive . United Germany now represents the strongest economic force in Europe and , as the former East_German market develops , it will become an even stronger world media market with a population of some 80 million . Like many new broadcasters in Europe , RTL was the first non-government channel in its territory when it started in 1984 . In the last decade Germany has gone from two state broadcasters -- ARD and ZDF -- to 12 television_stations , nine of which are commercial . RTL is now the most successful commercial broadcaster in Germany and , indeed , in Europe in terms of revenue , which last year hit $ 1.68 billion . * When Thoma started RTL with 25 staffers working from the small country of Luxembourg , home of parent company CLT ( Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Television ) , he produced cheap , attention-getting programming . Nightly shows included &quot; Lederhosen &quot; -- or &quot; Love_Letter From the Leatherpants , &quot; a series of soft porn films from the 1970s -- and &quot; Tutti-Frutti , &quot; a strip_show that caused outrage across Europe and brought more_than 4 million curious viewers to the channel . As RTL became more established and took_on shareholders like Bertelsmann , it expanded its programming budget to $ 650 million and developed genres that did not exist in Germany , such_as daily soap_operas and sitcoms . While close to $ 200 million of RTL ' s budget is spent on finished U.S. programs , a large chunk of the $ 650 million is spent on importing talent from the United States , Australia and Holland to create German versions of their shows with varying success . In one such deal with Columbia Television , RTL brought U.S. writers to its Cologne headquarters to make a German version of &quot; Who ' s the Boss ? &quot; While the_British remake of &quot; Boss , &quot; called the &quot; The Upper_Hand , &quot; succeeded , Thoma concedes that &quot; it looked_like an American sitcom perfectly dubbed into German with not-so-good actors. &quot; Similarly , a version of &quot; Married With Children &quot; was &quot; more or less a failure , too close to the American product , &quot; according to Thoma . He says that a Germanic &quot; Maude , &quot; which has had some success in its French remake , is RTL ' s next project . * Thoma himself has a sense_of_humor that has helped him crack the world of German broadcasting . Being Austrian-born is an advantage in German television , he says , because &quot; we do not take ourselves so seriously. &quot; As his colleagues weave across the foyer of the Four Seasons hotel carrying their bounty from a Manhattan shopping expedition , Thoma chuckles : &quot; You would think we came from an underdeveloped country . All they want to do is shop. &quot; Thoma ' s colorful style has occasionally gotten him into trouble . For example , he once compared Leo Kirch , the media entrepreneur who holds German rights to many U.S. film libraries , to Hugenberg , the press_lord whose newspapers did not oppose the Nazi SS coming_to power in pre-World War II Germany . Kirch took him to the German Trade Court over those remarks and won a case that said his comments were unfair , but Thoma is challenging the ruling in another court . Kirch , who owns shares_in German commercial broadcasters SAT 1 , Pro 7 , KabelKanal and Premiere , has a stranglehold on U.S. rights in the German-speaking market . But Thoma ' s campaign on Hollywood is positioning RTL so it can scoop_up Kirch ' s U.S. deals when they run_out over the coming decade . Thoma said he stands_by his comments about Kirch . * Inside Hollywood * For more Company Town coverage and insightful analysis of the entertainment_industry , sign_on to the TimesLink on-line service and &quot; jump &quot; to keyword &quot; Inside Hollywood. &quot; Details on_Times electronic services , B4</TEXT>
