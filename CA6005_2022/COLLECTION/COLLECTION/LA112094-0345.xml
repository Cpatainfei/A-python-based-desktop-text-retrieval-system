   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; WHAT MAKES SIRR PARKER RUN ? ; THE LOCKE HIGH SENIOR DODGED ADVERSITY TO BECOME THE CENTRAL_CITY ' S MOST COVETED FOOTBALL_PLAYER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Practice is over , the sun has set and most of the players have already gone_home . But Sirr Parker , the Locke High_School football star , does more_than run ordinary drills . And that may be one reason he is a running back with extraordinary skills . He takes a football at the goal_line and surveys his opposition : two players , acting_as cornerbacks , stand a first down away at the 10-yard line . Two more crouch at the 20 . The object : Make_it to the other end zone without being tagged by any of the four defenders . Parker digs his right cleat into the lumpy turf , pivots quickly and heads left , already near full speed . Drawing the first two players to him , he quickly zigzags right and arches away from a hand-tag . The first two defenders are through . Parker breaks_down the right sideline and reaches midfield before cutting_back against the grain , sweeping past one would-be tackler . Three down , one to go . It ' s now a footrace , an event that the 100-meter sprint specialist rarely loses . No contest . . . touchdown . &quot; They hardly ever catch me , &quot; Parker , 17 , said with a smile . Staying out of harm ' s way is second nature to Parker . He is as good at dodging adversity as he is at slipping tackles . Good_enough to shrug_off an unstable home life and the dangers of growing_up amid gangs and drugs in South-Central Los Angeles to become the Central_City ' s most highly prized football recruit . Parker , despite his team ' s miserable season ( an 0-9 record with two forfeits ) , led the city in rushing with 1 # 129 yards and 19 touchdowns with 19 , scoring 114 points . Parker scored twice o1847618409 No wonder a score of top Division I football colleges have their eyes on Parker and are ready to help him achieve the most cherished of rewards for a high_school athlete : a scholarship . But if Parker gains a full scholarship from one of his many suitors -- which include football powers USC , Notre Dame , Arizona , the University of Nebraska and UCLA -- he will have beaten considerable odds to do_it . It would seem there is plenty of scholarship money to go_around for star athletes in any given year : In 1991 , the last year for which figures are available , the National Collegiate Athletic Assn . reported that 90 # 000 athletes were receiving about $ 468 million in full and partial scholarships from more_than 500 Division I and II colleges and universities . The numbers are striking , but the reality is that competition is fierce : It is estimated that the available scholarship money is enough for only about 10 % of the athletes , male and family , w1752113264 Talent is a necessity to draw interest from coaches and recruiters , but grades are essential for actually landing financial_support . Poor grades can sideline the best of athletes . Good grades can give a star such_as Sirr Parker an open field . The NCAA , at the urging of some college presidents , has toughened its academic standards for scholarship eligibility in recent years . A type of sliding scale is used -- a student athlete who maintained a C average in high_school , a 2.0 grade-point average , would have to score a 900 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test ; the better the GPA , the lower the test score can be and vice versa . &quot; School is the No . 1 factor why kids don ' t get scholarships , &quot; said Richard Estrada , who works for Para-Dies Scouting Service , an Orange County-based service that contracts with colleges who want information on high_school football_players . &quot; The city of L.A. probably has_the_best athletes overall in Southern California , but a lot of times nobody ' s pushing these kids to study and to go_to school . So you get a kid with maybe a high-C average , but then you look_at his SAT and , sorry , it ' s 600. &quot; Parker won ' t have that problem . He has a 3.78 GPA and is awaiting his reults on the SAT test . Parker has helped cut the odds further by being a member of his school ' s student-improvement club , the Men of Locke Delegation , which awards students varying amounts_of_money for good grades . Beyond academics , there are other stumbling_blocks for the Central_City athlete . &quot; Some kids see their parents once a week , &quot; Estrada said . &quot; There are gangs and drugs . Kids have to separate themselves from that element and it is really hard . It takes a lot of willpower to do that in the city. &quot; In fact , Parker will tell you the game has always been the easy part . &quot; Football is the least of my concerns , &quot; Parker said . &quot; I use it to keep everything else together . Once the ball is in the air , I put everything else on hold . It helps me keep other things in_order , release my frustrations , get_away from the spotlight. &quot; * Still , the glare of attention is never far away from a blue-chip athlete . It follows Parker home to the two-bedroom apartment he shares with his mother in South-Central . A minute into a recent phone conversation , Parker heard the familiar click of call_waiting . Over the course of the hour-and-a-half conversation , he would hear it eight more times -- from assistant coaches of universities that are pursuing him or from the news media who want to know if he has made_up his mind where he will go . &quot; that ' s the usual , &quot; Parker said . &quot; I get_about 30 calls a week. &quot; The attention literally surrounds Parker at_home . In his room , recruitment letters adorn all four walls and still more are stapled to the ceiling . Hundreds more are stored in his dresser drawers . He never throws them away . &quot; I keep them for souvenirs , &quot; Parker said . &quot; When I wake_up in the morning and go_to_sleep at night , all I see are letters everywhere. &quot; As Parker gazes at the letters , he sees a future filled with promise and possible stardom . But when he looks_into the mirror , he is reminded of a difficult past , filled with ups and downs . From the time Parker was 1 until he was 11 , he lived with his grandmother in South-Central , at 76th and Broadway . Gunshots and sirens were heard nightly . Bad neighborhood , good times . &quot; It wasn ' t the life to live but it was probably the happiest time of my life , &quot; Parker said . * With Parker ' s mother battling personal problems and his father gone since he was 3 , his grandmother , Florence Mosley , shouldered the responsibility of raising him . &quot; My grandmother and cousins took the place of my father , &quot; Parker said in a soft , even voice . &quot; You never miss what you never had. &quot; Mosley took_care of Parker and most of his cousins in an average-size home . &quot; She raised 10 children and nearly 22 grandchildren over the course of my stay , &quot; Parker said . &quot; I saw her go_through a lot of things and make it. &quot; Parker remembers the lessons she taught him : &quot; She would feed family members and people off the street if they were hungry . She fed people who stole from her before . She taught me to never hold grudges. &quot; Even though she didn ' t have much , Mosley saw_to_it that Parker had everything he needed . &quot; We had food and clothes and we went_to school , &quot; Parker said . &quot; That was never an issue. &quot; Meanwhile , Parker ' s cousins and roommates , Eric Wilson and Akili Mosley , saw_to_it that Parker ' s football skills would not be wasted on the playground . &quot; We all used to play football in the street , and one day we snuck Sirr up_to Jefferson High and signed him up_to play Little_League , &quot; Wilson said . &quot; He was too good not to play somewhere. &quot; Parker didn ' t disappoint his cousins , winning rookie of the year at the age of 8 as a member of the Tiny Mites of the King Football Conference -- a Pop Warner-like organization . Parker established his star status early : In three years in the King Conference , he was twice named most_valuable_player , player of the year and defensive and offensive back of the year . Parker felt_like he was the fastest person in the world . All that he could see in front of him was daylight . Only death could catch him from behind . &quot; It bothered me a lot when my grandmother died , &quot; Parker said of Florence Mosley ' s death in 1988 . &quot; I still miss her. &quot; * Parker lived with his aunt , Freda Williams , in Rialto for the next two years , before finally moving_back to South-Central with his mother in an apartment owned by his grandfather . Parker admits that he and his mother do not share a close relationship . He says she is rarely at the apartment . He believes , however , that she is past the problems that caused her to send him to live with his grandmother . Noticeably uncomfortable , Parker sheds the subject , much like a futile arm-tackle . &quot; I ' m usually at my coach ' s house or my girlfriend ' s house , &quot; Parker said . &quot; Sometimes , I don ' t know where my mom is , but it doesn ' t bother me . I just do what I have to do. &quot; Louis Mosley , Parker ' s grandfather , comes_by from time to time to check on his grandson . &quot; I go_to see how Sirr is doing , &quot; Louis Mosley said . &quot; I just tell him to concentrate_on the future and not worry about the past or present. &quot; During Parker ' s past and present , the one positive has always been football . In 1992 , he made the Locke varsity football_team as a sophomore , picking_up where he left_off in youth football . From the start , Parker drew attention for his dazzling natural_ability . &quot; I have ( scouted ) him since he was a sophomore , &quot; Estrada said . &quot; I was telling people that Parker was going_to be a Division I player when I first saw him. &quot; Locke coach E.C. Robinson tells why . &quot; He ranks at the top of the backs in the city because he can run , catch and pass , &quot; said Robinson , who is in his 14th year at Locke . &quot; Sirr can run inside , make a read and then bounce outside with the speed to turn the corner . I have seen great backs in the city , but he is the best I have seen in eight or nine years. &quot; The city has produced its share of great backs , including Manual Arts graduate Steve Broussard of the Cincinnati Bengals , Crenshaw ' s Wendell Tyler , formerly of the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers , and Roosevelt ' s Mike Garrett , formerly of the San Diego Chargers and Kansas City Chiefs and the current athletic director at USC . * The 5-10 , 180-pound Parker also impressed onlookers at the Scouting Evaluation Assn . Combine at Warren High_School in Downey last spring . A combine is a tryout for football_players during which they are measured and tested for speed , agility and overall ability in a series of running and pass-catching drills . Recruiters and scouting services can evaluate several athletes at_the_same_time . The combine ' s director , Dick Lascola , was particularly impressed with Parker . &quot; Our motto is ' We Test the Best ' and Sirr Parker certainly belongs here , &quot; Lascola said . &quot; Parker is a good football_player . He can break tackles and once he gets_into the open , he is tough to catch . Speed is his obvious strong suit . I don ' t know that he has any weak attributes. &quot; His size might have been a drawback at one point , but Parker has added 20 pounds to his chiseled frame since his sophomore year . The added muscle has brought him better balance and helped eliminate what used to be a weakness in his running style . &quot; Parker used to go_down easily when he was hit but he has since gotten a lot stronger , &quot; Estrada said . &quot; He runs inside a lot better than he used to . When you add power to his quick decision-making abilities and great acceleration , you have a great running back. &quot; And he has the superstar attitude : &quot; I like for the game to be in my hands , &quot; Parker said . &quot; I like having the ball and feeling the pressure . I have a say-so whether or not we win or lose. &quot; He ' s a leader , too , Robinson said . &quot; Sirr is a remarkable person . He is well-respected by his teammates and well-liked by his schoolmates. &quot; Wherever he goes , Parker ' s choice in college will not be solely based upon athletics , although he does adhere to advice commonly given to prospective scholarship athletes : He wants to go somewhere where he will be spotlighted in the team ' s offensive game_plan . Unlike many high_school seniors who want to remain close to home their first year in college , distance and emotional ties will not factor into Parker ' s decision . &quot; It doesn ' t matter where in the United States I play , &quot; Parker said . &quot; I ' m taking ( my trophies , awards and letters ) with me , so home will be wherever I go. &quot; Parker is allowed a limited number of on-campus visits under NCAA guidelines . Home could be one of the schools -- Washington , Arizona or Notre Dame -- he has planned to see . Washington may be the early front-runner thanks to star tailback Napoleon Kaufman , whom Parker reveres . Kaufman ' s slashing running style and balance of speed and power is reminiscent_of Parker ' s . At heart , though , Parker ' s decision will be pragmatic . He sees his future more in terms of a next logical step than a once-in-a-lifetime dream . &quot; The first thing I look_at is the graduation percentage of the football_players . I ' m using football to get an education . If I don ' t get a pro contract , I ' ll still have school , &quot; he said . And what would Parker want to do more_than play football ? &quot; I want to be a child psychologist because with all_of the problems I went_through as a child , I think I could relate to other children ' s problems , &quot; Parker said . But Parker doesn ' t want a plush office overlooking Wilshire Boulevard . Something at Broadway and Manchester is fine with him . &quot; The kids in South-Central have the most problems , so that ' s where I should be , &quot; Parker said . &quot; A lot of people make_it and act like they were never there . I have to remember where I came from. &quot; Times Staff Writer Gordon Dillow contributed to this story . On the Cover Sirr Parker with the hundreds of recruiting letters he stores in his room .
