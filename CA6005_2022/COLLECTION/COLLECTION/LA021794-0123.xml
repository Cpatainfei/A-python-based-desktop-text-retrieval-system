   <TEXT> Two Italian journalists lost their credentials Wednesday for two days because they had carried a video camera into Tuesday ' s five-kilometer women ' s cross-country ski_race . The Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee said the credentials had been picked_up because only rights-holders -- CBS , Eurosport and other organizations that paid to televise the Games -- were allowed to use video cams at the venues . * From Hugin , the official newspaper of the Lillehammer Games : &quot; Fire_stations in the Olympic region have received several false alarms in the last few days . The reason for this is that too many people in the region are taking showers with the door open and the steam activates the fire_alarm . Johnny Haarberg , duty officer at Lillehammer ' s fire_station , urges everybody taking a shower to shut the bathroom door to prevent steam reaching the alarms. &quot; MIKE KUPPER</TEXT>
