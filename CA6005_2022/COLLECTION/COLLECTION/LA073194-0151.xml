   <HEADLINE> DIGITAL TELESCOPE TO MAP 25 % OF THE SKY ; ASTRONOMY : TECHNOLOGY SIMILAR TO THAT IN HOME VIDEO CAMERAS WILL BE USED TO SCAN THE HEAVENS FOR LIGHT PARTICLES AND STORE THEM ON HIGHLY SENSITIVE COMPUTER CHIPS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A new telescope that uses the same chips found in many home video cameras will provide the most extensive survey ever of about 25 % of the sky . Researchers hope that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey scheduled to begin late this year or early next year will reveal clues about the structure and beginning of the universe . The project , which will be conducted at Apache Point Observatory near Sunspot , N.M. , is a joint collaboration of researchers from Johns Hopkins University , Princeton_University and five other institutions , according to Edwin Turner , an astrophysics professor at Princeton . Researchers expect the survey will take_five years to complete . Unlike home telescopes that allow the user to view one portion of the heavens with the naked eye , the Sloan Digital Telescope will &quot; plow &quot; the skies . The telescope will scan long , thin strips of the night sky for photons , the actual particles of light . Light focused by the telescope will land on a bank of 30 chips , and the information recorded by the chips will be stored as digital_computer information , Turner said . Although the chips_in the telescope resemble those found in home video cameras , those in the telescope have been modified to much higher sensitivity . Four of the devices in the giant , 200-inch Hale telescope in California can detect a lighted cigarette 700 miles away . Other variations are also used in spy_satellites . When finished , the researchers will have images in five different colors , which scientists can use to determine the characteristics of various stars , quasars and other galactic objects . They will also have a useful reference tool that can be stored on computer disks or retrieved from a computer_network . &quot; we ' ll be imaging approximately a quarter of the whole sky . In that area there are almost a_hundred million galaxies ; to have that kind of multicolor data for such a large area is going_to be an incredible resource , &quot; said Marc Postman , an associate_professor of astronomy at Johns Hopkins University . The survey is one of several in the planning stages that should provide a broad overview of the universe , said Stephen Strom , chairman of astronomy at the University of Massachusetts . &quot; It will not only yield important scientific results on its own , but will provide a very important tool for selecting sources of study with the new generation of telescopes that are coming_on line , &quot; he said . While the Sloan survey will measure the visible_light spectrum , others will deal with infrared and other non-visible light , Strom said . The other institutions involved in the Sloan project are the University of Chicago , the University of Washington , the Institute for Advanced Studies at Princeton , Fermilab in Illinois , the Naval Research Lab and a group of Japanese astronomers , Turner said . The survey will also help scientists get a better idea of what the universe looks_like and the motion of various galaxies . &quot; It ' s like being an ant crawling around on a piece of art . Understanding this large-scale structure we hope will be a key to how the universe formed and evolved , &quot; Turner said .</TEXT>
