   <HEADLINE> NOW GERMANS TAKE IT OUT ON RUSSIANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Beating the Tulsa Oilers was never like this . Ludek Bukac , who played for Oklahoma_City of the old Central Hockey_League in 1964 , achieved a first in German Olympic hockey history Friday when he coached his team to a 4-2 victory over Russia.Germany was 0-8 in the Olympics against Russia and its predecessors , having scored only nine goals and given_up 61 . Germany was 1-79-2 against Russia in all matches . &quot; The winning of games is pushing us forward , making progress for hockey in Germany , &quot; said Bukac , who also coached the Czech national team for six years and had never defeated the Soviets . &quot; If you play successfully , the coach lives for another day. &quot; Bukac seems to have little to fear after leading Germany to a fifth-place finish in the 1993 World Championships and a 3-1 record here . Friday ' s triumph , in which three-time Olympian Bernd Truntschka scored his first two Olympic goals , gave Germany a berth in the medal round . Russia is 2-2 after starting the Games with a 60-6-2 record since its hockey debut in 1956 . &quot; Our defense is the weakest_part of our game , &quot; assistant Russian coach Igor Dmitriev said . &quot; We have to improve in that area . . . . This team is losing its self-assurance , and it is not the team it was before. &quot; Said Bukac : &quot; In our day , the Russians were always a strong team , but this competition is tougher now because the Russians are not a dominating team . The bottom teams are competing better , so it ' s not easy to play them. &quot;</TEXT>
