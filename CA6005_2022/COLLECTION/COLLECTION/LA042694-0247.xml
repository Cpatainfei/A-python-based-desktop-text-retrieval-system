   <TEXT> &quot; H ow do you spell relief ? &quot; The boss asks a simple question -- but you might as well be asked to recite the Declaration_of_Independence in Urdu . In a second , you are transported back to the palm-sweating ignominy of Mrs . Davenport ' s sixth-grade class . Thursday , Spelling Day . The day the apple-polishing Good_Spellers go_to the front of the class for their gold stars . The day you slink down in the chair to dodge your snickering classmates and escape the steely gaze of Mrs . Davenport , the oracle of orthography , whose pursed lips say it all : You are about to commit the linguistic equivalent of blowing your nose into your dinner_napkin . You can ' t spell . &quot; Um , R-E-L-E-I-F ? &quot; So in a world where people are judged not by their quality of mind but by the correctness of their spelling , there will be no relief for you . * Graffito on a UC Berkeley kiosk : &quot; Bad spellers of the world , untie ! &quot; Call them the orthographically challenged . ( Or OCs , if you will. ) They wander the land with advanced degrees ; high-profile jobs ; wicked takes_on history , art and the state of the world . And as they wander , they secretly pray that no one will ask them to spell it . &quot; I ' m afraid when I open my mouth to talk , it ' ll come_out misspelled , &quot; says Ronnie Caplane , a contributing editor to an antiques magazine . &quot; It ' s excruciating . I break_out into a sweat when I have to write notes to my children ' s teachers : ' Please excuse Morgan ' s a-b-s-e-n-t-s . . . a-b-c-e-n . . . ' Forget it . ' Morgan was not at school . She had a cold. ' Heaven help us if she ever got pneumonia. &quot; So why not use the dictionary ? They try . &quot; I ' ve spent hours getting lost in the dictionary . When you ' re a bad speller , you can spend days in there and never find what you ' re looking_for , &quot; says Christa Rudolph-Freund , a Marin County teacher working toward a doctorate in education . &quot; When I was writing my master ' s thesis , I ' d call_up the long distance operators in the middle of the night and say : ' How do you spell colonel ? ' It isn ' t k-e-r , or c-e-r , or any other logical thing you could think_of . The operators were always helpful . If they didn ' t know the answer , they ' d ask the one sitting next to them. &quot; And the spell-checker ? It can ' t follow you everywhere , and even if it could , its knot all ways rite any whey ; after all , it ' s only a machine . So the bad spellers cope . They forge ahead , hoping to find forgiving souls along the way . &quot; Every time I turn_in a piece , my editor assumes all my misspellings are typos . I say , ' Yes , they ' re typos , ' &quot; says John Seabrook , a writer at the New Yorker , who says his writing style reflects years of trying to avoid words he couldn ' t spell . &quot; When Dan Quayle misspelled potato , I actually felt sorry_for him . And I had to think for a minute how to spell it . I take great solace in F . Scott Fitzgerald , who was a terrible speller -- truly unbelievable . If you look_at his unedited journals , you ' d think he was almost illiterate. &quot; * It ' s strange that we should place so_much importance on whether the I comes_before the E except after the C . . . except when it ' s weird . . . or their . . . or leisure . . . or . . . . But we do . &quot; Spelling is one of the easiest ways to categorize people by behavior . It ' s highly visible , easily documentable , &quot; says Ronald Macaulay , professor of linguistics at Pitzer College and author of several books on the sociology of language . &quot; It ' s relatively trivial , but hard to master if you don ' t master it at a young age . It ' s attaching tremendous significance to something trivial , but visible -- like table manners. &quot; Indeed . If you want to get that job , get the peas off the knife , the spinach out of the teeth , and keep_up the good-spelling front . Lie_about it . Write around it . Lean_on the spell-checker . Get someone else to spell it for you . Avoid the written word altogether . But then . . . then comes that moment your guard is down , your cover gets blown , and the wrath of the real_world descends . &quot; Some people who can ' t spell worth a damn are very good writers , &quot; says Rene J . Cappon , general news editor at the Associated Press in New York and author of &quot; The Word , &quot; an AP guide to good writing . &quot; But if you get a resume or a letter about a job with five words misspelled -- or in our writing test , if someone turns_out to be a supremely poor_speller -- you have to say , ' Now , wait a minute. ' It ' s clearly a mark against them. &quot; Ouch . * &quot; I hope I never meet a man so narrow that he can spell a word in only one way . &quot; -- Thomas_Jefferson Once , not so_long ago , it wasn ' t such a bad thing to be a bad speller . Or , let ' s say , a democratic speller . At one time in Britain , you could tell what region a personal_letter came from by the way it was spelled . Shakespeare spelled the same word two ways on two lines and signed his name with three combinations of letters . &quot; Nobody cared , &quot; Pitzer linguist Macaulay says . Then in the middle 18th Century , all orthographic hell broke_loose . Dr. Samuel Johnson , a raving classicist , compiled a dictionary . One that remained true_to the roots of the language , with its ancientisms , silent Ds , hidden Cs , vexing oughs and I ' s before Es . At about the same time , members of a newly literate English middle_class were devouring tips from social critics who fed them models for Correct Behavior . They acquired fish forks and magazines . They folded their napkins and scrubbed their dialects . &quot; All of a sudden , spelling came_to loom large as a measure of literacy , &quot; says Dennis Baron , professor of English and linguistics at University of Illinois , Urbana . &quot; It became one of those benchmarks that said you had made_it into the cultural elite. &quot; The Mrs . Davenports of the world took_up the cause with relish . &quot; I was in a special college-prep course in high_school , and the spelling tests given as a means of raising your grade were supposed to be seen as largess on the part of the instructor , &quot; says Bob Calhoun , a bad-spelling professor of law at San Francisco ' s Golden Gate University . &quot; To me , it was nothing but misery . But I was lucky . I decided at an early age that the problem wasn ' t me . It was English spelling. &quot; * In their heart of hearts , most bad spellers know that their lot has nothing to do with lack of intelligence or even schooling . Experts say it may be related to a weakness in visual memory or trouble with step-by-step sequencing . Anywhere from 10 % to 23 % of the population -- maybe more -- suffer . &quot; It ' s not clear whether it ' s a miswiring , a misfiring or even a difference in ( brain ) structure , &quot; says Janet Ewart Eddy , director of the department of learning services at USC . Call it a simple brain glitch , one that does not compute the subtleties of the orthographic nightmare known as the_English language : Three main strains of ancient influence , scads of assimilated foreignisms , acres of spellings that haven ' t changed since Chaucer ' s time , and an unlikely storehouse of 20 # 000 commonly used words -- only 20 % of which look the way they sound . But the Mrs . Davenports of the world , guardians of the hallowed cause of form , don ' t care . They live for one purpose : To question not only your intelligence ( and maybe your breeding ) , but your very worth as a human_being . &quot; When I was a freshman in college , I turned_in an English composition paper for this nasty troll of a man and , naturally , it was_full of spelling errors , &quot; says a 50-year-old Oakland author who says her publisher cringes each time she turns_in an otherwise perfect manuscript . &quot; This professor wrote all_the errors on the board and he sort of sneered , ' I don ' t know how this person got_into this class. ' The implication was that I should have been in bonehead English . He didn ' t use my name , but I was so red I ' m sure everyone knew who it was , &quot; she says . &quot; But success is vindication enough . It makes people like that furious to see people they ' ve deemed inadequate succeed. &quot; Aaaah , Revenge of the Bad Spellers . They may_not be able to juggle the alphabet , but many of them are smart . As smart as their tormentors are shortsighted . The best and brightest include the rich and powerful : Gen . George Patton , President Harry Truman , philanthropist Andrew_Carnegie , computer czar Bill Gates , novelist Fitzgerald , to name a handful . Pity the judgmental Good_Speller who one day ends_up working for a Bad Speller . &quot; I have this fantasy , &quot; says antiques writer-bad speller Caplane . &quot; My first boss , this thoroughly humiliating person I had to plug into my ear while he dictated his letters , ends_up being the proofreader on my best-selling novel . I ' d be very gracious and kind about it -- but I ' d make_sure that he knew what his job was. &quot; Too-shay .</TEXT>
