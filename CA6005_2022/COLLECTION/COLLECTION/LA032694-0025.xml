   <HEADLINE> NATIONAL CONFERENCE DEFINES ITS MISSION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When I saw the article on the results of our national survey &quot; Poll of Minorities Finds Bias , Anger Toward Whites &quot; in the Religion section ( March 5 ) that depicted us an &quot; ecumenical &quot; organization , I thought maybe there was some confusion at the newspaper . This confusion exists elsewhere as well.It was not the primary reason we truncated our name from &quot; The National Conference of Christians and Jews &quot; to &quot; The National Conference , &quot; but it was one of the reasons . The former name must sound like a religious organization . To quote our mission statement : &quot; The National Conference of Christians and Jews , founded in 1927 , is a human relations organization dedicated to fighting bias , bigotry and racism in America . The National Conference promotes understanding and respect among all races , religions and cultures through advocacy , conflict resolution and education. &quot; Stated differently , the purpose of this organization is to honestly deal with any individual or group which is or feels estranged or hostile toward another group for whatever reason . The subjects with which we deal include all_the &quot; isms &quot; which have kept us apart and consequently shortchange the potential of the whole . Our programs bring all races , genders , ethnic and religious groups together for honest and , at times , painful dialogue . Our work does include , therefore , bringing members of different religious groups together for understanding and dialogue . The other programs are oriented toward youth ( the majority of our work ) , the criminal justice system -- including the police and sheriff ' s departments , and other organizations -- both for-profit and not-for-profit . JAMES E . HILVERT Executive_Director , The National Conference</TEXT>
