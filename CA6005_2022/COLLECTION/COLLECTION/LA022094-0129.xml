   <HEADLINE> LOOK WHO WE FOUND ; MARIA SCHNEIDER ' S STILL IN PARIS , BUT SHE DOESN ' T TANGO ANYMORE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Maria Schneider was just 19 years old when she did the last tango and some rather more risque dances here with a middle-aged widower played by Marlon Brando . &quot; Last Tango in Paris &quot; became an X-rated movie classic in 1972 , but the uninhibited young French star seemed to disappear as quickly as she was discovered . Whatever happened to Maria Schneider ? The actress , now 41 , pondered that question in the bar of the Ritz Hotel the other day , pausing to light a cigarette and sip her espresso . &quot; When you start your career like I did , with a film like ' Last Tango , ' it ' s a little hard , &quot; she began , speaking in a soft , deep voice . &quot; It ' s better to grow in a career steadily. &quot; Schneider has made only one other appearance on the American big screen , in &quot; The Passenger , &quot; a 1975 film_starring Jack Nicholson . Since then , she has done 20 films , all_in Europe . &quot; I ' ve been working , but my only regret is that I haven ' t worked in the States since then , &quot; she said . Next month , she will be seen in a supporting role in Gramercy Pictures ' &quot; Savage Nights , &quot; a powerful French autobiographical film by Cyril Collard , who died of AIDS last March . Schneider plays a Moroccan psychic who appears to the HIV-infected man in a dream . She describes it as a &quot; very small , very strong part. &quot; The film was hailed by critics in France as a courageously honest portrait of a bisexual , 30-year-old man with AIDS who is torn between his love for a woman , 18-year-old Laura , and a man , 20-year-old Samy . French audiences were fascinated by Collard ' s willingness to portray himself as an egocentric character who slept_with a young_woman several times before telling her he carried the AIDS virus . &quot; I was touched by his true story , &quot; Schneider said . &quot; It ' s quite admirable to be so honest . But I was quite depressed after seeing it . I guess I live_in this very romantic world . I had no idea people could live like he did. &quot; She considers Collard ' s film &quot; a very interesting first effort , &quot; but she doesn ' t think it ' s a &quot; masterwork . It would have been interesting to see what he would have done after that. &quot; Since &quot; Last Tango &quot; and &quot; The Passenger , &quot; Schneider ' s European roles have included a baby-sitter who kidnaps the children , a criminal who does 10 years in jail for killing her husband and , in her most recent film , &quot; Sandscreen , &quot; a Saudi_Arabian princess . Wearing jeans , a wool jacket and leather boots during a recent interview , she appeared thinner and more handsomely mature than the teen-ager who wowed American audiences as Brando ' s innocent femme_fatale . She is bemused that anyone would still be interested in &quot; Last Tango &quot; and Jeanne , a role she was chosen for from hundreds of actresses in Paris , and for which she was paid just $ 5 # 000 . To her , the film seems ages old . &quot; Do you remember everything you did 20 years ago ? &quot; she asked . &quot; And when I see ' Last Tango ' today , I have to say it got old . The film has aged. &quot; But , when pressed , she admits that her American experience was enriching for a young actress . And she still recalls how Brando asked her what her astrological sign is_on the first day of shooting , and seemed relieved upon learning it was the same as his -- Aries . &quot; I ' m quite proud to be the only European actress to play opposite Marlon Brando . Quite proud , &quot; she said . &quot; And then to play with Jack Nicholson , too . They ' re not weak actors , you know . &quot; But I was young in those days , &quot; she added . &quot; I play mothers now. &quot; She says she doesn ' t much miss the fame , fleeting though it was . &quot; I did this one film and suddenly I couldn ' t travel without people recognizing me , &quot; she said . &quot; It was insane . People saw me on the street and starting thinking I was like Jeanne in real life. &quot; She spent two years in Los Angeles in the early ' 70s , but , homesick , returned to Paris . The daughter of a French actor , Schneider has never married and she leads a rather quiet life here . She ' s an admirer of American films . &quot; We still make some good films in Europe , but the women ' s parts in American films are much more interesting . We don ' t build many films on women stars . Here you play the wife or the mistress. &quot; But she harbors little desire to return to Hollywood . Her heavily accented English is a drawback . And , as she has matured , her Romanian-Greek roots combined with her curly black hair have produced a look that is difficult to cast as French . &quot; It ' s hard for me to find parts in America , &quot; she said . &quot; I could play a Mexican maybe or a Colombian . Look , I ' m objective about it. &quot; She ' s not sure how Collard ' s tale of love and AIDS will play in America . &quot; The attraction of romance is very French , &quot; she said . &quot; But in the States , you aren ' t that romantic . It ' ll be interesting to see what happens. &quot; *</TEXT>
