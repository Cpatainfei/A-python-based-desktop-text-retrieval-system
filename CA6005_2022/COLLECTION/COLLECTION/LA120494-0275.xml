   <HEADLINE> UNVARNISHED COLORADO ; A LOCAL ' S GUIDE TO GLITZ-FREE BRECKENRIDGE , AN OLD MINING TOWN WHERE THE SLOPES ARE STEEP AND THE PARTYING ' S HEARTY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last winter , as a ski bum living here , I paid $ 350 a month for a room in a dilapidated mobile_home , subsisted on a daily diet of oatmeal and canned soup , and in my job as ski photographer , spent countless hours trying to convince tourists that family portraits taken during blinding snowstorms make fabulous Christmas_cards . Not surprisingly , when it came time this autumn to return to Breckenridge for another ski season , I balked . Sitting_down with my journal , as I often do_in fits of indecisiveness , I began writing the pros and cons of moving_back to the mountains . The cons came quickly . I wrote_about the cold . I wrote_about the expense . I recalled the day last December when I was testing my brand-new skis and broke my collarbone into three pieces . Then my thoughts shifted , and I wrote_about the sunrises I ' d witnessed in Breckenridge , when the tips of the mountains looming over the sleeping town were stabbed with sharp , orange light . I wrote_about Mountain Java , the cafe where my friends and I escaped snowstorms and our poorly heated homes . I wrote_about walking home from the Gold Pan Bar late at night , reeling both from the night ' s revelry and the vastness of the night sky awash with stars or snowflakes . Before I ' d filled two pages , before I ' d even begun writing_about skiing , I knew I would return . Wedged between the sharp peaks of central Colorado ' s Ten Mile Range and the streaked flanks of Bald Mountain , Breckenridge ( or &quot; Breck , &quot; as locals_call it ) embraces returning ski bums and visitors alike with a genuineness and an amiability you don ' t often encounter in other Colorado ski resorts . Breck ' s 1 # 500 residents take fierce pride in the town ' s historic past , in the beauty and accessibility of their rugged surroundings and in their reputations as tireless partyers . But more_than anything else , Breckenridge prides itself on what it isn ' t : namely , prefabricated and pretentious . You only have to make the 30-minute drive northwest from Breckenridge to Vail for a quick lesson on what a prefab , made-to-order ski town looks_like . Arriving in Colorado ' s largest ski resort , you ' re immediately struck by Vail ' s resemblance to a giant , pseudo-Tirolean shopping_mall , complete with concrete parking garages , elevated walkways and a clock_tower . Like Vail , Breckenridge lavishly caters to a diverse range of visitors . At their disposal are two sprawling slopeside resorts , several art_galleries , horse-drawn carriage rides and an impressively equipped municipal recreation center , complete with a two-story-high indoor water slide . But Breck is not the progeny of the ski industry : Four decades ago , when Vail was a mere gleam in an ambitious developer ' s eye , Breckenridge was celebrating its centennial as a hardened high-country mining town . Even now , Victorian buildings line Breckenridge ' s Main_Street , and scattered throughout the town are unimproved mining sheds and burro barns , their wooden doors hanging open as if their original owners had left only yesterday to prospect elsewhere . As for pretensions , Donald and Ivana have yet to bicker in a Breckenridge lift line , and you won ' t find Oprah Winfrey bellying up_to the bar at the Breckenridge Brewery . An absence of celebrities , however , isn ' t the only reason Breck lacks the snobbishness of Aspen or Telluride . Many Breckenridge apartment and homeowners are still willing to rent to seasonal workers , and there are still enough lift operators , waiters and ski instructors living_in Breckenridge to save it from feeling like a theme park for fur-swaddled Floridians . For nearly 100 years after its founding in 1859 , Breckenridge attracted fortune-seekers eager only to exploit what was inside the mountains , not on their slopes . Though Colorado ' s largest gold nugget , &quot; Tom ' s Baby , &quot; was discovered nearby , the town ' s isolated location , high altitude ( 9 # 600 feet ) and bitter climate kept steady prosperity at arm ' s length . Rebecca Waugh and Jennifer Kemp , members of the Summit County Historical Society , are determined to prevent Breck ' s long and rollicking history from being smothered under snow and the dollars people pay to slide_down it . Waugh and Kemp fiercely oppose developers hoping to replace Breckenridge ' s burro barns with gleaming apartments , and they lead historic walking tours through town to introduce residents and visitors to Breck ' s colorful and sometimes outrageous past . Outrage , according to Kemp , is the very reaction of some tour-takers when they learn that turn-of-the-century miners in Breckenridge paid 25 cents for a bath in a Main_Street boarding house , compared to five cents for a rendezvous with one of the prostitutes who lived_on &quot; Nickle Hill. &quot; My strongest reaction , however , was the nausea I felt upon being shown the several examples of &quot; hair art &quot; on the walls of the restored Briggle House , built_in 1896 . To pass the long , cold winters , Victorian housewives swapped swatches of human hair and used them to weave ornate , multihued wreaths . When World_War_II broke_out and the U.S._government halted all gold mining , Breck ' s population plummeted and the remaining 250-or-so residents found themselves inhabiting a near-ghost town . Then , in the early ' 60s , a Kansas lumber company , encouraged by the success of other fledgling ski resorts , opened the first ski_lift on Peak 8 . ( Early Breckenridge surveyors may have been adept at sniffing_out gold , but they weren ' t much for naming mountains. ) Since then , the ski area has steadily grown to include Peak 9 and Peak 10 , and last year , Breckenridge Ski Resort ' s current owner , Ralston Resorts , opened Peak 7 , a bald , steep hump open_to expert skiers willing to traverse its face or hike to its summit . Given the size of the Breckenridge ski area -- at nearly 2 # 000 acres of skiable terrain , it ' s one of Colorado ' s largest -- and its gradual , piecemeal development , it ' s no surprise that skiers lose themselves among Breck ' s 126 ski trails faster than they lose gloves on chairlifts . Herein lies the advantage of being a local . The lifts that crisscross the canyon between Peaks 8 and 9 dumbfound skiers new_to the mountain , leaving some of the choicest terrain to residents and experienced Breckenridge skiers . Fortunately , for $ 21 ( plus a $ 42 lift ticket ) a skier can take a three-hour tour with a Breckenridge Ski Resort guide and learn how to navigate the intricacies of the trail system . Once you ' ve found your bearings , however , you ' ll find the skiing in Breckenridge rivals that of any North_American resort . Though Breckenridge lift tickets and season passes are also valid at nearby Keystone Resort and Arapahoe Basin ( all three ski areas are owned by Ralston Resorts ) , boredom rarely rears its ugly head at Breckenridge . Breck boasts more advanced-skier terrain than any other Rocky Mountain resort except Crested Butte ; both resorts claim 57 % of their slopes are tailored to experts . * My first season at Breck , I skied every day but one or two and still hadn ' t exhausted its possibilities . However , I did find some favorites : When I wanted to scream down long , groomed cruisers or float through powder-rich glades , I headed for Peak 10 . I dropped into Peak 9 mogul runs such_as &quot; Inferno &quot; and &quot; Devil ' s Crotch &quot; when I wanted to exhaust my legs and frazzle my nerves . On Peak 8 , I giddily partook of vertiginous , above-tree-line bowl-skiing or headed for Breckenridge ' s newest pride and joy , Peak 7 , where skiers hike_up a long ridge to the summit and then throw themselves at the mercy of the gravity gods . Last winter , whenever weather allowed , there was a long line of skiers and snowboarders filing up the ridge line to the Peak 7 summit , like a phalanx of Gore-Tex-bedecked lemmings eager to leap to their doom . Anybody who hikes uphill for an hour with his skis or snowboard over his shoulder so he can curdle his blood with a quick plummet through the powder wants to go somewhere later and boast about it . Breckenridge is well-equipped for base-of-the-mountain braggadocio . At tony Cafe Alpine , which claims to be the first restaurant in Colorado to serve tapas ( Spanish appetizers ) , skiers regale each other with mountain-top exploits while munching on blackened tuna sashimi and trout canapes ; those craving more basic , carbo-heavy grub head for the burgers and pizzas at Downstairs at Eric ' s , where locals follow an odd custom of drizzling their pizza crusts with honey . Just down Main_Street from Eric ' s are some of my favorite watering_holes : the Alligator Lounge , a basement-level blues joint ; the Bar-B-Que , which serves an assortment of Colorado micro-brewery beers and platters of ribs and ' slaw ; and the Breckenridge Brewery , which serves a rich , amber ale called Avalanche , aptly named for the morning-after pounding it administers to your head if you imbibe one too many . Several times over the winter , Breck craves a party too big for one bar to hold . In November , the town throws a &quot; brewski tasting &quot; street festival , during which participants taste micro-brews from around the country . In January , Breckenridge goes international with its Snow Sculpture Championships , in which teams of sculptors from around the world race the clock while fashioning intricate works_of_art from massive and gradually melting blocks of snow . The same month , there ' s the notorious Ullr Fest -- when the Norse god Ullr ( say &quot; OOHler &quot; ) , responsible_for creating snow , is appeased with a full day of parades , fireworks and wintry debauchery . * If there ' s one place in town that doesn ' t need a special event to encourage debauchery , it ' s the Gold Pan -- the bar upon which Breckenridge ' s night life is anchored . The Gold Pan isn ' t the oldest bar west of the Mississippi , as some claim , but it ' s old enough to know how to give your sensibilities a good whippin ' if you saunter in heedless to its long history as a serious drinking saloon . Built_in 1881 , the Gold Pan still features its original swinging_doors , which were recessed off the sidewalk so inebriated miners would n ' t knock_down passersby when stumbling outside . The Gold Pan was recently purchased by Reggie Grey , owner of the Adams Street Grill , a Main_Street eatery known for its candle-lit gentility . Waugh , the historian who filled me in on the Gold Pan ' s history , says that when the restaurateur bought the bar , everybody was worried he would &quot; yuppify &quot; it . &quot; He did clean it up and remodel it , &quot; says Waugh . &quot; That lasted about a week. &quot; On any given night , the Gold Pan is_full of young , hard-partying locals playing pool or listening to a local band thrashing it out by the front windows . Many of them sport the shaved heads , pierced facial features and baggy garb that have lent the sport of snowboarding a reputation as being a ski-town fashion show for the young and surly . Snowboarders are probably the most visible and fastest-growing segment of the Breckenridge ski-bum community . But Breckenridge , which was one of the earliest ski areas in Colorado to welcome snowboarders to its slopes , is largely exempt from the much-publicized animosity between skiers and snowboarders ( a.k.a. &quot; shredders &quot; ) . Gordon Briner , Breckenridge ' s director of ski operations , attributes the harmony on his mountain to Breck ' s longstanding policy toward snowboarders : There is no policy . &quot; We don ' t have a ' shred-iquette , ' &quot; says Briner . &quot; We have rules for the mountain , and everybody , whether on snowboards , telemark skis or alpine skis , has to follow those guidelines. &quot; Nevertheless , something compels snowboarders to distinguish themselves physically from skiers . Last year one of my mobile-home roomies , Kyle Metzler , a recent graduate of Colgate University in New York state , had come_to Breckenridge to teach skiing . Early in the season Kyle took_up snowboarding and shaved his head . Then he let his hair grow out_to a fuzz and bleached it until it glowed . Then he bleached his eyebrows . Recently , when I met Kyle and his girlfriend Charity Brehl to go snowboarding ( yes , I ' m a snowboarder , but my eyebrows are still their natural color ) , Charity pulled me aside . &quot; Kyle ' s in a bad mood , &quot; Charity said . &quot; Tell him he looks really jacked in his new clothes. &quot; Hey , snowboarders are sensitive guys , too . Kyle and Charity also introduced me to another ' boarder , Mike Buckley , who recently arrived in Breckenridge and who fits the profile of a classic , living-hand-to-mouth ski bum . Mike , 21 , hasn ' t found a place to live yet ; for two weeks he ' s been sleeping_in the car he drove here from Iowa City . &quot; It ' s a station_wagon , so it ' s not too_bad , &quot; says Mike , &quot; even though I have to lie_down to change my clothes . Of course it ' s freezing cold , so I don ' t want to take my pants off too often anyway. &quot; Though his living conditions might leave something to be desired , Mike couldn ' t ask_for a better workplace . Soon after arriving in Breck , Mike landed a job at Mountain Java , where Breckenridge locals jump start their cold-numbed brains with elaborate elixirs , such_as &quot; Soul in a Bowl , &quot; a mixture of espresso , Mexican chocolate and spices , and fuel their ski legs with huge , hot bagels . Mountain Java ' s windows face the ski mountain ; shelves filled with books , postcards and magazines surround its tables . By the front_door is a bulletin_board plastered with &quot; skis for_sale &quot; and &quot; need a place to live &quot; notices . In two years of nearly incessant traveling , I ' ve come_to regard Mountain Java as one of the closest places I have to a living room . I ' ve also found that there is no better spot from which to watch the day turn_to dusk . It ' s a favorite ritual of mine to sit near the front windows , a mug of coffee before me , and catch the dying daylight smudge the rivers of snow streaming down the ski mountain with a faint shade of purple , while the lights of Breckenridge , the closest place I have to a hometown , blink on . Somehow , I suspect my ski-bumming days are not over .
