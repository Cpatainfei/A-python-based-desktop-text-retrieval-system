   <HEADLINE> THE COLLEGES / MIKE HISERMAN ; CSUN RULE BOOK SEEMS TO BE MISSING A PAGE ON COMMON_SENSE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rules , rules and more rules . Pages and pages of rules . Rules on how to dress inside the cafeteria . Rules about uniforms . Warnings about gambling . Violators of training camp curfew must participate in a &quot; Dawn Fun Run. &quot; So it says on the first page of the Cal State Northridge football_team handbook . Must be something on missing practice in here . . . . Yep , here it is , on Page 6 : &quot; You will be responsible to attend all scheduled football events . This includes meetings , practices and contests . . . . &quot; A pretty good linebacker stumbled over that one . He skipped a practice and was benched for an Oct . 1 home_game against Cal State Chico . You don ' t blow_off practice and get_away with it at Northridge . All the players know it . Maybe that ' s why one of them showed_up for drills on the afternoon of Aug . 29 this year -- only hours after his arrest in connection with a double shooting in San Bernardino . Police say the player shot a security_guard and a woman as they sat in a truck outside a bar . The woman is the player ' s former girlfriend and the mother of his child . She was struck once in the hip as she tried to flee . Her acquaintance was hit in the arm and chest , a potentially lethal shot that was deflected by a bullet-proof vest . Jonathan Beauregard was jailed for investigation of assault with a deadly weapon , but within hours he was released on $ 15 # 000 bail . The charges later were upgraded to attempted murder with additional special circumstances of using a handgun and inflicting great bodily injury . He remains free . And he remains a member of the Northridge football_team . Felonies . Isn ' t there a section on alleged felonies ? Let ' s see . . . . You can ' t leave training meals until you have been excused by a coach . You must bring your playbook and a writing instrument to meetings . Loud music in the locker_room is strictly prohibited . Nothing on felonies . What the good_book does say is that players in &quot; trouble with the law &quot; shall be &quot; presumed innocent until proven otherwise. &quot; Fair enough . But what about deception ? Isn ' t there a section on deception ? The shooting incident occurred on the first day of school . Beauregard , a two-year starter at offensive guard , never told his coaches , teammates or Northridge administrators . He managed to keep his secret until 12 days ago when Coach Bob Burt was approached outside the Northridge locker_room by a reporter who detailed the allegations of the crime . Burt retreated into the team room , emerging later to say that the player was refusing comment -- to the coach and the press -- on the advice of his attorney . That night , Beauregard was in the starting lineup against Chico State . Meanwhile , a linebacker who missed a practice watched from the sidelines dressed in street_clothes . Is there not something skewed about such a scenario ? At some point , common_sense surely must override a team handbook . An athlete accused of a felony owes an explanation to his coach and team . This player chose to remain silent . Northridge athletic administrators worry that suspending players in such cases might leave the school vulnerable to a lawsuit if they are found innocent . They can ' t understand how other schools -- a whole bunch of them -- can impose sanctions on an athlete who hasn ' t had his day in court . Though the term might be debated by some , playing football for the Matadors must still be considered a privilege . It is no person ' s God-given right to be included as a member of a college athletic team . With privileges come higher standards . Says so in the team handbook . Page 6 , Section 3 : &quot; . . . Your deportment -- conduct on campus , on road trips , and in the community -- must be_better than expected of the regular student. &quot; Break the code and become . . . a regular student . What ' s wrong with that ? Let Beauregard stay in school . His scholarship should be honored . It ' s his place on the football_team that should be taken . If nothing else , he has embarrassed coaches and teammates by his deception . Such serious allegations never should have been kept secret . Ironically , a hand injury is supposed to keep Beauregard sidelined until sometime after his Oct . 19 arraignment . His status with the team beyond that point has not been determined . Again , the handbook says , &quot; Any trouble with the law will be dealt with on the basis of presumed innocence until proven guilty. &quot; Northridge officials are using that passage like a shield . &quot; I ' m not a policeman , a judge or a district_attorney , &quot; Burt said . &quot; I ' m a football_coach and he ' s a football_player and a student . He deserves the same rights everybody else has. &quot; Sometimes a coach has to play by the book . But it ' s best to mix_in a little common_sense . Common_sense . Doesn ' t the handbook say anything about common_sense ? There is a segment that reads , &quot; Negative action ( i.e. , trouble with the law , violating dorm rules , etc. ) of a football_player is a direct reflection on our football program and your football teammates and coaches. &quot; Right now , that reflection looks bad .</TEXT>
