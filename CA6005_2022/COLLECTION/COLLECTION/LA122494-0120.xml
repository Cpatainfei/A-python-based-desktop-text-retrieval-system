   <HEADLINE> CHECHEN WAR RAISES FEAR OF NEW INSTABILITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Russia is now a country at war . The combat theater is small , the location obscure and the casualties likely to remain a relative trickle compared to those in Rwanda or Bosnia . But when the Kremlin decided to break Chechnya ' s bid for independence by military_force , when it began dropping bombs on what it considers Russian towns and shelling Russian citizens , it crossed a line beyond which only one thing is sure : This Eurasian colossus has become a more volatile place . Instead of the stability that was the rationale for the Russian offensive , many observers believe that greater instability is already the result . Instead of sewing the patchwork of the Russian Federation together once and for all , President Boris N . Yeltsin may have helped pull it apart . And instead of cementing Russia ' s image as a country on its way to post-Soviet normalcy , the Chechnya intervention has cast greater doubts on the Kremlin ' s commitment to democracy and human_rights . &quot; In Chechnya , Russia has found its own domestic Karabakh , &quot; lawmaker Konstantin Zatulin said in a recent newspaper_article , referring to the intractable conflict in the disputed enclave of Azerbaijan that has brought_down leaders and crippled economies . Except that this Karabakh is in the northern , Russian section of the Caucasus Mountains instead of the southern end . A potpourri of clannish peoples sitting on rich troves of oil , the Caucasus is an explosive region with little love lost for Moscow at the best of times . By killing scores of Chechen civilians in ill-aimed bombing and shelling , Moscow risks inflaming much of the region . Already , the people of neighboring Dagestan and Ingushetia have shown their solidarity with Chechnya by blocking Russian troops heading there and lining their roads in a mass protest . &quot; The longer it takes_to reach some kind of political solution , the bigger are the chances that the flames of guerrilla war will move_over and engulf the nearest republics , if not the rest of the Caucasus , &quot; said historian Karen Brutents , an expert on ethnic conflicts . Though in the past Ingushetia , Dagestan and Kabardino-Balkaria have not pushed as hard as Chechnya to secede , the Russian intervention is clearly giving them more incentive . &quot; It is not the best of federations where issues are resolved by force , &quot; said Ruslan Aushev , president of Ingushetia . &quot; Think_about how it feels when you ' re sitting there waiting for tanks to invade. &quot; Aushev said Ingushetia did not plan immediately to secede , but &quot; if everybody starts leaving there will be little else for the Ingush to do. &quot; In recent months , the Russian Federation had actually seemed fairly solid , with the one exception of Chechnya . Yeltsin signed a broad agreement with virtually all_of Russia ' s 88 regions and republics last winter , and even former holdouts such_as the oil-rich republic of Tatarstan had stopped agitating for more freedom . But the offensive in Chechnya holds the potential to spark a reaction similar to the sudden collapse of the Soviet_Union after the 1991 coup attempt , when Soviet republics horrified by the coup and seeing a moment of Kremlin weakness declared their independence one after the other . Already , republics such_as Tatarstan are openly criticizing the Chechnya intervention , calling_for the renewal of peace talks . &quot; We are sure that combat operations should be suspended , &quot; Tatarstan President Mintimer Shaimiyev told Yeltsin in a special message Thursday . Even if the country does not begin to spin apart , Russia has already lost some of its unity by trying to isolate the unrest in the Caucasus . It cut_off all flights from Azerbaijan and Georgia this week in an attempt to stop the flow of arms to Chechnya , and has limited other transport access to the Caucasus . The Russian offensive also threatens to undermine the uneasy peace in other conflict areas of the former Soviet_Union . Officials are already broaching the possibility that Russia , by killing the Muslim Chechens , has ruined its authority as a mediator and source of peacekeepers in the former empire . Islamic states &quot; will consider it good style to reproach Russia for its conduct in Chechnya &quot; and reject Moscow ' s role in settling conflicts , such_as the one in Karabakh , in which Muslim states are involved , Zatulin predicted . &quot; I can assure you that if the situation continues this way it will soon produce a powerful seat of destabilization , not only in the northern Caucasus but in the whole Russian Federation , &quot; said former Russian Parliament Speaker Ruslan I . Khasbulatov , an ethnic Chechen . &quot; The effect will snowball , pulling_in international forces and the sympathies of other countries and other parliaments , especially in the Islamic world. &quot; If worst-case scenarios come true , the northern Caucasus will become the setting of a drawn-out guerrilla war in which Chechen militants backed by other ethnic_groups will harass Russian troops for years . Analysts here compare the Chechens to the Basque separatists in Spain and the Catholic republicans of Northern_Ireland . Many Chechens are sure that the war will not end until their people have been destroyed or the Russians defeated . &quot; The message we get clearly from the Russians is ' No people , no problem , ' &quot; alleged Abdullah Dadayev , an adviser to the Chechen president . The chief danger in the Chechen crisis , however , is not of a prolonged local conflict but of its implications for the pinnacle of Russian power . When the Kremlin made the decision to use force , it signaled that what Russian observers call the &quot; Party of War &quot; -- the defense and security Establishment -- had triumphed over Yeltsin ' s more dovish and intellectual advisers . If that happened once , it is likely to happen again . &quot; No matter what the outcome of the military_expedition to Chechnya , it is practically inevitable that other problems will also be resolved by force , &quot; Editor-in-Chief Vitaly Tretyakov wrote in the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper . Though the Russian offensive in Chechnya has the tacit approval of most foreign governments and many Russians , the face of the Kremlin has changed . It is fiercer , more aggressive . Yeltsin showed in October , 1993 , when he sent tanks to battle his recalcitrant Parliament , that he was willing to use force to obtain his political goals . Now he has gone a step further , turning the Russian army ' s firepower not only against a rebellious elite with virtually no popular support but also against an entire rebellious people . For watchdogs such_as Sergei Kovalyov , Yeltsin ' s top human_rights inspector , the very fact of the offensive on Chechnya reveals a Kremlin willingness to violate the tenets of democracy . &quot; The Chechen people , as any other , can make mistakes in choosing their leaders and ideals , &quot; said Kovalyov , who was visiting Chechnya to monitor the conflict . &quot; But this gives no one the right to dispute them in the language of bombing and shelling. &quot; The Helsinki Watch human_rights group called_on President Clinton , who says he considers Chechnya an internal Russian problem , to take a stand against the incursion . The group said he should &quot; make_it clear to President Yeltsin that the conflict in Chechnya tests Russia ' s commitment to democracy and that Russia ' s conduct so far shows a fundamental lack of respect for human_rights and humanitarian law. &quot; &quot; Such behavior is never ' an internal matter , ' &quot; the group said . What frightened Russian media and analysts most , however , was the possibility that , having gotten the country into a virtual state_of_war , hard-liners in the Kremlin would take_advantage of the situation to infringe on other basic rights -- from closing_down newspapers to harassing lawmakers . Their argument , warned Sergei Parkhomenko in the newspaper Sevodnya , would be : &quot; Extraordinary times demand extraordinary measures. &quot; The Road to Chechnya * A firsthand report of a Times correspondent ' s visit to embattled Chechnya , published in this week ' s World Report section , is available on the TimesLink online service .
