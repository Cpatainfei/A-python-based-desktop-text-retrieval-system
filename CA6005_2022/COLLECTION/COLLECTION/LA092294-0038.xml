   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; INTEREST_RATE FEARS PUSH DOW DOWN 17.49</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fears of higher interest_rates pushed stocks sharply lower for the second consecutive session Wednesday as yields on Treasury securities shot higher . The Dow Jones industrials extended a 67-point loss suffered Tuesday and fell an additional 17.49 to 3 # 851.60. An unexpectedly sharp rise in the nation ' s trade_deficit Tuesday had led analysts to fear that the Federal_Reserve_Board would soon raise short-term interest_rates . Those fears were supported early Wednesday when Wayne Angell , former Federal_Reserve governor and current chief economist at Bear , Stearns &amp; Cos. , said there was a 60 % chance that the Fed would tighten policy at its Sept . 27 open market policy meeting . Angell ' s statement , plus an unexpectedly large increase in housing starts , moved the markets . The 30-year Treasury_bond hit 7.80 % , its highest close since June 24 , 1992 . Short-term bills were hit too , with the discount_rate on three-month bills up by 0.18 percentage_point to 4.79 % . The bill ' s yield to maturity jumped to 4.91 % . &quot; People are giving more credence to the fact that the Fed may move next week , &quot; said Joe LaVorgna , money_market analyst at the UBS Securities unit of Union Bank of Switzerland . Fund managers and stock pickers face flat returns this year , and &quot; with worries about the Fed raising rates again , and so little confidence in the capability of the stock_market to make new gains , the temptation is definitely there to try to lock_in this quarter ' s profits , &quot; said Jim Solloway , research_director at Argus Research . &quot; There ' s a good degree of wanting to move fast , owing to a lack of confidence about the future. &quot; Stocks were also responding to weakness in the dollar , which ended lower against the Deutsche mark and marginally higher against the Japanese yen . &quot; There are two big uncertainties , &quot; said Dick Hoey , chief economist at Dreyfus Corp . &quot; Will the dollar plunge against the yen , and will the public willingness to buy stock funds evaporate ? If either of those things happen , that will be very bearish for the market. &quot; Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 12 to 5 on the New York Stock_Exchange , where volume totaled 351.84 million shares , up from 325.89 million on Tuesday . Broad market indexes also lost ground . The NYSE ' s composite index fell 1.20 to 254.71. The Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500-stock index fell 1.90 to 461.46. The Nasdaq composite index fell 6.03 at 760.71. At the American_Stock_Exchange , the market_value index fell 3.38 to 454.77. Treasury_bond yields started_out firmer , but they dipped after the government reported that housing starts rose 2.1 % in August , boosted by a double-digit jump in apartment construction . The report suggested to analysts that the economy may be growing faster than expected , stirring fears of inflation . But the report also indicated that single-family construction , which represents about 80 % of new housing construction , fell 2.7 % in August . The 30-year bond yield stood at 7.80 % at the end of yesterday ' s session , up from 7.77 % on Tuesday . With the long bond approaching 8.0 % , bonds are becoming more attractive , said Bernadette Murphy , executive_director at M . Kimelman &amp; Co . &quot; If investors can get an 8 % return . . . without any risk , they will tend to go_into a yield instrument rather than buy stocks. &quot; Stocks attempted a recovery in late morning as bonds trimmed their losses , but then headed south again in early afternoon . The Dow Jones industrials were down 48 points in mid-afternoon before a technical rally cut those losses by more_than three-fifths near the end of the session . Among Wednesday ' s market highlights : * Economically sensitive stocks were hit hard by the specter of higher interest_rates . The Federal National Mortgage Assn . fell 1 3 / 8 to 80 3 / 8 . Industrial stocks were hit hard , amid the perception that higher interest_rates could derail the economic recovery . Caterpillar led the Dow industrials lower and fell 1 1 / 4 to 54 1 / 8 . Auto and paper issues also fell . Retail stocks fell after Prudential Securities downgraded Nordstrom stock to &quot; hold &quot; from &quot; buy &quot; and cut its estimate of the department_store company ' s future profits , saying sales growth will be lower than expected . Nordstrom fell 2 15 / 16 to 39 13 / 16 in Nasdaq trading . Digital Equipment led the action on the NYSE and rose 1 1 / 8 to 29 , extending Tuesday ' s gains after Cowen &amp; Co . upgraded the stock . * Overseas stock_markets were mixed , with the Tokyo and Frankfurt markets rising but London and Mexico_City falling . * Coffee rose to its highest price in more_than two months amid concern that a lack of rain in Brazil is adding_to crop damage caused by two frosts during June and July . Coffee for December delivery rose 3.35 cents to $ 2.3135 a pound on the Coffee , Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange . Little to no rain has fallen_in coffee growing regions of the country since a second frost stung coffee_trees on July 10 . No rain is expected until at least next Monday , and longer range forecasts call_for hotter and drier weather than normal .</TEXT>
