   <HEADLINE> Q &amp; A ; BUTLER ' S OUT TO REORIENT THE TAKE_ON GAY , STRAIGHT ROLES ; THE ACTOR TALKS ABOUT THE DOUBLE_STANDARD IN CASTING HETEROSEXUALS AS HOMOSEXUALS , AND VICE VERSA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Audiences at Dan Butler ' s autobiographically inspired one-man play , &quot; The Only Thing Worse You Could Have Told Me , &quot; which has been running at Hollywood ' s Theatre Geo since last spring , leave knowing that the veteran actor is gay . It ' s what the play is about . Many more people know him , however , for his role as &quot; straight &quot; sportscaster Bob ( Bulldog ) Briscoe on NBC ' s Emmy Award-winning &quot; Frasier. &quot; We caught_up_with Butler , 39 , at a Melrose eatery to ask why he accepted such a controversial part . * Question : In deciding whether to accept this straight role , did you consider its possible negative consequences on your career ? * Answer : My agent privately warned me that this could be a career-terminating move . But after I decided to go_with it , he ' s supported me in full . I hope that my public will too . And I hope I ' ll still be seen for gay roles . Q : So you don ' t think people might mistake you for Bulldog and wonder whether you ' re really straight ? A : I ' d like to think that people would not be so narrow-minded as_to hold this against me . Besides , some of my best_friends are straight ! I also want to mention here that I continue to have a very loving and wonderful relationship with my boyfriend . Q : But with women and blacks and Latinos and gays and lesbians going_after them , why would you want to identify with such a besieged minority as straight white males ? A : As Rodney King said after the riots , we all live here together . We ' ve got_to get_along . I don ' t want to pat myself up_on the back , but someone ' s got_to stand_up for them ! Q : How did you study for the part ? A : There was a time in my teens that I actually slept_with women . It was just an awkward phase I was passing_through . But I thought_back to that phase , and played off it . I also did some research at a_couple_of straight bars . By the end of the evening , one woman gave me her number , so I think I was pretty successful . Q : We ' re surprised that you ' re admitting , for publication , that you ' ve actually had some heterosexual experiences . A : Why not ? I ' m not big on the closet . And I ' d like to add that if you ' re straight , you should be proud ! that ' s who you are ! You were born that way ! Besides , I have a sister who ' s straight . And I want her to know that I love her and support her . Q : Did any of your straight friends give you advice on how to play the part more authentically ? A : Sure , but I don ' t want to mention their names , out of respect for their privacy . I did , however , have two very special high_school teachers . One was in shop class , where he taught me to use Makita power_tools . The other was my intramural basketball teacher , who taught me hook_shots . Q : What kind of preparations did you make to play the role ? Did you buy any special colognes or clothing ? A : Mostly , I watched Tommy Lasorda on TV . And I learned that the key to playing a straight white male is to wear pants that allow_for an expanding waistline . I don ' t hold that against them , though . Q : What ' s the hardest jump to make in_playing straight ? A : The way they ' re always talking_about sex . Do you notice how often they talk_about their wives and girlfriends ? Everything they say seems to have a sexual innuendo . I think that being straight is a personal affair . I don ' t mind what they do behind closed doors ; I just get uncomfortable when they kiss and hold hands so openly in public . Q : Is your playing Bulldog a way of saying straight white_men should be treated equal_to other minorities ? A : Absolutely ! And they ' re not . Sometimes -- when you watch sporting events , for example -- all you see are the rowdy , drunken , obnoxious straights . But they ' re only part of the crowd . The reality is that there are many other well-behaved straights there . that ' s a point I want to make in my portrayal of Bulldog . I want him to be the embodiment of the silent majority of straight white_men , with a soft , Hallmark card touch to him . Q : What does your boyfriend think_of all this activism ? A : He ' s very understanding . Q : Hasn ' t he started wondering whether you might be a latent heterosexual ? A : I have to admit : Women are sexy . I could see how someone could get_into it and be a happy white heterosexual . Not me , of course ; but for others -- hey , why not ?</TEXT>
