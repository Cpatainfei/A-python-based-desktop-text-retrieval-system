   <HEADLINE> TENNIS / AUSTRALIAN OPEN ; GRAF , SANCHEZ VICARIO REACH FINAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Steffi Graf , seeking her fourth Australian Open title in seven years but her first since 1990 , overpowered Kimiko Date , 6-3 , 6-3 , today to set_up a final against Arantxa Sanchez Vicario . Sanchez Vicario , who had lost in the semifinals the last three years , defeated Gabriela Sabatini , 6-1 , 6-2 , to reach her first Australian Open final . Graf won the first nine points of the match and quickly opened a 5-1 lead . She finished the first set_in 31 minutes , then broke serve in the opening and closing games of the second set and completed the match in 61 minutes . &quot; I think it was a match we both didn ' t have a lot of rhythm , &quot; the top-seeded Graf said . &quot; She went_for a lot of shots and she made a lot of them , but she also made some errors . I expected today a tougher match than it ended up. &quot; Graf won the Australian Open in 1988 , 1989 and 1990 . The last three years it was won by Monica Seles , who is still recovering after being stabbed in the back during a match last April . Date , seeded 10th , was the first Japanese player in the semifinal of a Grand_Slam tournament since 1973 . No . 2 Sanchez Vicario , mixing hard ground_strokes with delicate drop_shots , finished_off No . 4 Sabatini in 65 minutes , winning the last four games . Graf has a 21-5 record against Sanchez Vicario . But the last time Graf lost in a Grand_Slam tournament to anyone other_than Seles was to Sanchez Vicario in the quarterfinals of the 1992 U.S. Open . &quot; I ' m not afraid . I ' m going_to play my own game -- she ' s the one under pressure , &quot; Sanchez Vicario said . &quot; She ' s beatable . She ' s human , she ' s not a machine. &quot; On Wednesday , third-seeded Jim Courier had his Grand_Slam attitude back , beating No . 5 Goran Ivanisevic in straight sets to advance to the semifinals against top-seeded Pete Sampras . Another American , Todd Martin , will face Sweden ' s Stefan Edberg in the other semifinal . It is the first time since 1982 three Americans are in the men ' s semifinals of the Australian Open .</TEXT>
