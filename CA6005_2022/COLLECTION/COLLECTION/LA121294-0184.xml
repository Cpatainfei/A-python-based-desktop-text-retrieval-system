   <HEADLINE> SELLOFF LEAVES COUNTY WITH RISKIEST ITEMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last week ' s mass sale of Orange County ' s portfolio holdings by its lenders consumed many of its most conservative and marketable securities , leaving it with the riskiest and most exotic investments , financial experts close to the county ' s rescue effort said Sunday . The residual holdings , which the bankers valued at $ 5.5 billion to $ 6 billion , are also &quot; enormously &quot; vulnerable to changes in interest_rates , said one source familiar_with the portfolio -- an exposure the financial team is laboring to curtail as it attempts to unwind the county ' s ill-starred bet_on an interest_rate decline . &quot; We ' re trying to create a transaction here that stops the bleeding , stops the losses , &quot; one source said . The bankers ' latest estimate of the portfolio value is equivalent_to a loss of $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion , about in_line with most recent estimates . But they cautioned that the figure is a &quot; snapshot &quot; of the portfolio ' s value and could fluctuate sharply with changes in interest_rates or with the pace or manner in which the holdings are placed on the market . &quot; If I were to say the value is $ 5.5 billion , I might be dead right at this moment , &quot; said one source close to the county , &quot; but when you throw $ 11 billion on the market you ' ll have gaps in the market price. &quot; The $ 11 billion is the estimate of how much of the county ' s collateral its Wall_Street lenders sold last week . Consequently , sources say , the county ' s advisory team from the Salomon Bros . investment_firm is trying to develop strategies aimed at unwinding the county ' s investments as cautiously as possible while protecting against its tremendous interest_rate risk . Such strategies might include using interest_rate futures and options that become more valuable as rates rise , thus offsetting further losses in the portfolio . &quot; You ' ve got_to go_in and price and value every security , then hedge against the risk , &quot; said one source familiar_with the effort . Complicating the situation is the condition of record-keeping at the county . Sources close to Salomon said that among the obstacles it faces is that crucial documentation establishing the fund apparently does not exist . That means there are few papers spelling_out who controls or legally owns the investment fund , as well as how it is governed and what to do_in the event of default . &quot; It appears that everything was very informal for handling huge amounts_of_money , &quot; said a person familiar_with the Salomon group ' s work . Such documentation would help to decide how to apportion losses or income from the sale of securities among the funds ' investors ; its absence could substantially delay efforts to quickly stanch the funds ' losses and sell_off its riskier holdings , the sources said . Although the advisory team has apparently found many of the same kinds of record-keeping discrepancies identified by The Times on Saturday , including securities that could not be immediately identified and others that remained listed on inventory records even after they matured or were sold , these gaps are not considered serious . The sources ascribed the discrepancies largely to &quot; clerical &quot; errors and said they are not expected to affect bottom-line calculations of the portfolio ' s value . Such bookkeeping errors are not unusual in comprehensive audits of the kind being undertaken with the county investment fund , one source said , and do not now point to any fraud on the part of the county ' s investment guardians . &quot; There ' s nothing that doesn ' t look ultimately documentable , &quot; said one source . The Salomon team is working largely with records held by the county ' s investment trustee , Bank of America , which are considered to be the most authoritative . Once the nature of the portfolio is established , the financial team will turn its attention to how best to extricate the county from its perilous bet_on interest_rates . This involves selling the riskiest or most volatile and complex securities . But the bankers are particularly determined to avoid a &quot; fire_sale &quot; in which large blocks are dumped on the market , where they might become subject_to opportunistic bidding . Among former county Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron ' s purchases were securities whose interest payouts were pegged to several different benchmarks . Pricing such paper for_sale involves assessing the future course of each benchmark and their possible interrelationships , a task requiring banks of high-powered computers . After the selloff of the county ' s more conventional holdings by its Wall_Street lenders , such securities are now overrepresented in the portfolio , sources said . The residual holdings tend also to be longer-term securities , which are more sensitive to interest-rate changes than those that would mature -- that is , be paid_off by their issuers -- in the nearer term . For all that , sources familiar_with the workout team ' s deliberations became increasingly critical of Citron ' s investment strategy as the scale of his bet_on interest_rates became clearer over the weekend . Particularly dangerous , some say , was his insistence that the portfolio ' s dizzying plunge in value this year represented only &quot; paper &quot; losses of principal that did not need to be recorded . As he described it to county supervisors in an interim report in September , Citron ' s policy was to hold all securities to their maturity_dates , when they would be paid in full and the principal losses would disappear . That policy , however , allowed him to blind himself to the reality that the market was moving sharply against him . In fact , one analyst said , had Citron not locked the portfolio so deeply into an expectation of falling rates , he would have been able to sell some of his holdings to take better advantage of the higher interest being paid on bonds and notes across the investment spectrum . Instead , the portfolio was saddled with securities that were designed to pay_out less interest as rates rose -- and those are the securities for which the advisory team must now find buyers .
