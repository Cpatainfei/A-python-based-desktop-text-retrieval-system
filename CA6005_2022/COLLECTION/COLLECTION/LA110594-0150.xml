   <HEADLINE> COALITION OF SIMI VALLEY CHURCHES HELPS THE HOMELESS SURVIVE ; COMMUNITY : PUBLIC ACTION TO DELIVER SHELTER OFFERS THE NEEDY A PLACE TO SLEEP , FOOD , SHOWERS AND OTHER SERVICES SO THEY CAN START ESCAPE FROM POVERTY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Chuck Tice knows how it feels to be down and out . Eight years ago , the Simi Valley communications engineer was unemployed and out of cash . With the help of friends , he found a job and slowly got_back on his feet . &quot; I started to realize how tenuous your lifestyle becomes when you go from a decent income to zero , &quot; he said . &quot; The words it can happen to anybody took_on a new meaning for me , and I really wanted to help other people who got stuck_in the same spot. &quot; For five years , Tice has been helping provide meals and a place to sleep for needy people through PADS -- Public Action to Deliver Shelter -- a coalition of churches that provides shelter and assistance to the homeless . From November to March , PADS offers_up to 50 homeless people a warm , safe place to sleep each night . A meal program provides hot dinners year-round for as_many as 200 people a night . And the newly opened Samaritan Center at St . Francis of Assisi Episcopal Church on Royal Avenue provides showers , clothing and mail service . &quot; We really want to act_as a cushion for people , so they don ' t fall_into despair , &quot; Tice said . On a recent chilly evening , Kurt Hartman and his two children were among 40 people who gathered at Grace Brethren Church for spaghetti , hot dogs , green_beans and chocolate_ice_cream . Hartman , 38 , said he is struggling to raise his youngsters on the wages he earns as a gardener . &quot; As a single parent it ' s tough to make ends meet , &quot; Hartman said as he gathered_up several loaves_of_bread to take_home to his apartment . At a folding table nearby , Hartman ' s 9-year-old daughter , Jessica Faith Hartman , sorted through a heap of free clothing . &quot; The people are nice and you can find good clothes , &quot; she said , explaining that the bulky pale yellow coat she wears indoors and out is one of the treasures gleaned from the clothing pile . * Her father agreed . &quot; At that age , kids grow so fast it ' s hard to keep_up with the clothes , &quot; he said . &quot; As they grow , we bring_in the old clothes and get new ones. &quot; Later in the evening , a handful of the diners headed across town to Church of Christ , where they bedded_down in cheerful , Sunday_school classrooms for the night . PADS worker Geoffrey Kasule is charged with ensuring that all_of the guests , as the overnight visitors are called , understand the house rules : no drinking , drugs , fighting or parking lot parties . Breaking these rules subjects violators to a two-week suspension from the program . &quot; To do this job , you have to be both soft and firm , &quot; Kasule said . &quot; Soft in a compassionate way , but firm in setting the rules , or people will walk all_over you. &quot; While PADS operators would ultimately like to open a full-time permanent shelter , the rotating churches approach has worked well , said Ken Constable , an accountant who manages the program ' s budget . PADS operates_on about $ 10 # 000 a year in donations and grants , he said . Of that , Tice is paid $ 600 a month for his 40 to 60 hours of work , while Kasule receives $ 350 . The rest is spent on sleeping bags , food , medical services and other operating expenses , Constable said . Most of the program ' s food is donated by the churches . This winter , PADS is seeking donations to help pay_for 150 extra-thick sleeping rolls . &quot; It ' s the classic case of a shoestring operation , &quot; he said . &quot; We are fueled mainly by volunteer support. &quot; Scores of volunteers from two_dozen Simi Valley churches prepare meals and staff the shelters overnight . Twice a month Ruby Meadows volunteers at Grace Brethren , serving_up dinner and a smile to hungry visitors . &quot; Once in awhile you get somebody who is gruff and ungrateful , &quot; Meadows said . &quot; But most people seem genuinely thankful that we ' re here. &quot; At the Church of Christ , in preparation for the arrival of guests one recent night , volunteer Mary Johnson brewed coffee and unwrapped vegetables , dip and a plate of fudge brownies she had baked that morning . Mary and her husband , Bill Johnson , would spend the night at the church , sacking_out on sofas and ensuring the night passed without incident . The guests began to trickle in , gathering_in the fluorescent-lit community room for post-dinner conversation . Paula Palos , 29 , is a frequent guest of the PADS program . Last winter she moved_into a government-subsidized apartment , Palos said , but was evicted because she had too many cars_parked on the property . &quot; I really like to buy old cars and then resell them to make money , &quot; she said . Now all_of her belongings are locked_in a storage unit and her children are living with her mother . On this night Palos said she had just been released from a five-day jail stint for running a red_light , driving without a license and failing to appear in court . &quot; I just need a little time to get_back on my feet , &quot; Palos said as she nibbled a baby carrot . &quot; One thing I learned is that if you are homeless once , you will be homeless again. &quot; Slumped on a nearby sofa , Rod Gillespie , 47 , said he was ready to make a change in his life . &quot; I ' ve got an interview tomorrow for a construction job , &quot; Gillespie said . &quot; Eight dollars an hour . Not too shabby . I ' ve been down before , and I ' m ready to turn things around. &quot; FYI To volunteer , make a donation or learn more about the PADS homeless shelter program , call Chuck Tice at 527-4445 .</TEXT>
