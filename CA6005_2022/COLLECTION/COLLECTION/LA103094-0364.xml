   <HEADLINE> ECONOMIC RESPITE FOR N . KOREA SEEN IN NUCLEAR ACCORD ; ASIA : U.S. OFFICIALS BELIEVE NORTH GAINED TIME TO DEAL WITH SEVERE PROBLEMS BY AGREEING TO FREEZE PROGRAM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> American government analysts have concluded that the nuclear deal the Clinton_Administration just negotiated with North_Korea will provide significant economic relief for the fledgling regime of its new leader , Kim Jong Il . Although the assistance will probably not make the difference between the eventual survival and collapse of one of the world ' s last Communist governments , U.S. officials believe that North_Korea has bought some time in return for agreeing to freeze its nuclear_weapons program . The agreement &quot; takes some of the sting out of their problems , &quot; asserted one U.S._government expert who closely follows developments in North_Korea . &quot; It puts them in a better position to deal with the ( economic ) pressures they are under. &quot; During the 18-month nuclear crisis , some American and South_Korean hawks argued that the United States and its allies should do as little as possible to shore_up the Pyongyang regime . &quot; Through these negotiations . . . you ' re helping the North_Korean regime to survive , &quot; James Lilley , former U.S. ambassador to South_Korea , said last year . He warned that over the next five years , North_Korea might be able to keep_on developing its missiles and sell them to countries such_as Iran and Syria . The Administration , by contrast , believes that the importance of stopping North_Korea ' s nuclear program outweighs the costs . U.S._government analysts and some outside experts argue that the economic benefits of the Administration ' s nuclear deal are not enough , by themselves , to prevent an eventual collapse of the North_Korean economy . The American promise to arrange for supplies of fuel_oil to North_Korea will raise by about 25 % the amount available for energy-starved North_Korean factories , experts said . And the American pledge to lift barriers to trade and dollar-based transactions could open the way for North_Korea to obtain foreign investment and other economic benefits . &quot; Does this deal do_it for them ? No , &quot; said Nicholas Eberstadt , a Korea specialist at the American Enterprise Institute . &quot; It may be cause for jubilation in terms of beating the Americans in negotiations , but it doesn ' t put the economy back on its feet . . . . ( North_Korea ) is still a highly unattractive environment for foreign investment. &quot; Under the deal signed_in Geneva on Oct . 21 , North_Korea agreed to an immediate freeze of its nuclear_weapons program , which the CIA believes has already produced enough weapons-grade plutonium for one or two nuclear bombs . In exchange , the Administration agreed to reduce trade_barriers between the two countries and to clear the way for the opening of diplomatic liaison offices in Washington and Pyongyang in the next few months . It also agreed to supply North_Korea with 500 # 000 metric_tons of fuel_oil a year and to arrange for construction of two 1 # 000-megawatt light-water nuclear_reactors , which cannot easily be used to make fuel for nuclear_weapons . These new reactors will replace North_Korea ' s gas-graphite reactors , which can more readily produce weapons-grade fuel . North_Korea also promised to open the way in about five years for special international inspections that would show how many nuclear_weapons it might have produced . And it agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities and ship radioactive fuel rods out of the country in about 10 years , when the light-water reactor project is completed . The U.S._government specialists said the time delays contained in the deal let North_Korea postpone , for now , the ultimate decision of whether to abandon its nuclear ambitions . &quot; The agreement puts_off the core of the decisions about the nuclear_weapons program , &quot; one official said . &quot; They haven ' t had to bite the bullet now , and that may be important to them ( the North_Korean leadership ) internally. &quot; Over the last five years , North_Korea ' s economy has shrunk by about 20 % as the country first lost the benefits of economic assistance from the Soviet_Union and then was required by China to pay_for goods at market_prices . &quot; North_Koreans now are told to get_by with two meals a day , &quot; Korea specialists Rinn S . Shinn and Robert Sutter of the Congressional Research Service reported in the summer . &quot; Industrial facilities are running at 40 % of operating capacity , due_to shortages of fuel , electricity and raw materials. &quot; North_Korea also faces enormous economic problems because of the need to support its army of 1.2 million men , a huge size for a nation of 22 million people . &quot; By the late 1980s , non-civilian males accounted_for fully a fifth of North_Korea ' s men of working ages , &quot; Eberstadt of the American Enterprise Institute wrote last year . &quot; There is no more surplus labor in the country . To satisfy its thirst for ever more inductees , the army must deprive state enterprises or universities of their recruits. &quot; Over the last few years , U.S._government specialists said , North_Korea has been able to obtain only about 2 million metric_tons of oil a year to keep its factories running . In the mid-1980s , before the embargo , North_Korea consumed more_than 3 million metric_tons a year . The fuel_oil provided to North_Korea in the deal , one analyst said , will be &quot; a significant increase -- but it doesn ' t take them to fat city . To get their economy back in shape , they need that plus whatever else they can get_on their own. &quot; According to the U.S. analysts , the North_Korean leadership believes that the lowering of trade_barriers and the broader international legitimacy gained by the nuclear deal will help attract foreign investment . &quot; The North_Koreans see this agreement as opening_up a stream of new resources for them , &quot; one U.S. official said . North_Korea promptly began to brag that the nuclear deal conferred a degree of official American recognition of a regime that the United States has , in the past , often branded a terrorist state . North_Korea ' s state-controlled media broadcast the full text not only of the agreement itself but also of a letter from President Clinton to Kim Jong Il . At the time of the broadcasts , Administration officials had not even acknowledged the existence of such a letter . Special Ambassador Robert L . Gallucci delivered the Clinton letter to North_Korean officials in Geneva on Oct . 21 when the nuclear deal was signed . In it , Clinton gave Kim Jong Il his personal assurance that the United States will organize an international consortium to provide the new light-water reactors to North_Korea . American officials said Clinton ' s letter was addressed to &quot; the Supreme Leader of the Democratic People ' s Republic_of_Korea &quot; and to &quot; His Excellency. &quot; Gallucci explained that the North_Koreans had asked that Clinton address Kim in the same glowing terms that they do . &quot; And we addressed it precisely as they asked , &quot; Gallucci said .</TEXT>
