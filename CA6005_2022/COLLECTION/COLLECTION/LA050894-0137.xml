   <HEADLINE> GENOCIDE AND GENES ; A ' NATURAL ' ACTION MAY BE ATROCIOUSLY IMMORAL , TOO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Genocide , according to Jared Diamond , a research biologist at UCLA , is a behavior that Homo_sapiens shares with the other primates , notably with the two extant species of chimpanzee . Attested in several other species , genocide is particularly well-documented among primates . Field research has shown clearly that bands of chimps exterminate rival bands down to the last member . As for the normality of genocide in humans , its empirical frequency -- Diamond counts 17 attested occurrences between 1950 and 1990 alone -- is disturbing confirmation that , in this of all instances , the immoral is not unnatural . Do Humans Have a Collective Genetic Capacity for Genocide ? In morality , as in all human achievement , humankind often challenges nature . We are genetically programmed to like sweets , for example , but our original environment , in which they were rare , has been succeeded by one in which they are harmfully abundant . A correction is called_for . Our collective capacity for genocide , fatally enhanced by technology , calls more urgently for a similarly collective correction . Unfortunately , as Diamond and such other observers as psychologist Robert Jay Lifton have noted , genocide induces a psychic numbing not just in its victims and perpetrators but also in those who merely witness or hear of it . The ape in us , so to speak , knows enough about ape destructive capability to run from the sight and sound of mass_murder . But the ape ' s repugnance may indeed be like the craving for sweets : undeniably natural but , in the contemporary context , a harmful reaction . Writing in 1992 in his brilliant &quot; The Third Chimpanzee : The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal , &quot; Diamond carefully distinguishes several situations in which genocide is attested , including the ominously familiar &quot; lengthy power struggle within a pluralistic society , leading to one group ' s seeking a final solution by killing the other . Cases involving two different ethnic_groups are the killing of Tutsi in Rwanda by Hutu in 1962-63 , of Hutu in Burundi by Tutsi in 1972-73 , of Serbs by Croats in Yugoslavia during World_War_II , of Croats by Serbs at the end of that war . . . . &quot; Can It Be Triggered Practically Anywhere and in Anyone ? One cannot say that if genocide is halted in Rwanda and Bosnia then by some simple causal sequence it will become less likely in Los Angeles . At the same time , genocide can no longer be thought of as something that only &quot; they &quot; do . Chimps and humans are , genetically , 98 % identical ; and historical experience confirms genetics : The suggestion is that genocide -- race_murder -- arises from a tendency that , under given pressures , may be activated practically anywhere and triggered in practically anyone . Measures to neutralize the tendency are encouragingly widespread and effective , but they are not yet universal or infallible . So , no , sure , it can ' t happen here ; and yet , in a world in which the escalation of civil strife is a more proximate danger than a superpower exchange , making_sure that it can ' t happen there either may be a prudent hedging of the evolutionary bet .</TEXT>
