   <HEADLINE> TAKING A HINT FROM WISE YOUNG HEADS ; * IF THREE JUNIOR_HIGH STUDENTS CAN DESIGN A CITY THAT WORKS , WHY can ' t WE ADULTS ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> To realize the potential of the future , it is necessary first to envision it . Southern California , for one , has been built that way , by dreamers who understood that if you imagine it , maybe they will come . After fire , earthquake and flood , the region is again poised at a crossroads , summoned by events and by its moment not only to affirm its future , but maybe even to reinvent some of it . And who better to engage in that kind of brainstorming , not only for this region but for the country at_large , than today ' s youngsters , the very people who will be there when tomorrow arrives ? Three eighth-graders from Bernardo Yorba Junior_High_School in Yorba Linda -- Jacob Smith , Cory Jobst and Jeff Carroll , tackled a challenge posed by the National Engineers Week Future City Contest to propose an ideal city for the year 2195 . Their effort , an 18-foot-square model of a city called Ancona , was selected over offerings by six other teams as the winner in the Future City Contest . It was created by using a computer_game called &quot; Sim City , &quot; and then the boys created the model they showed the judges from their computer work . The model featured a working train system . The youngsters not only proposed a city ' s infrastructure , they addressed its soul as well . In an essay prepared_for earlier regional competition , they talked_about ways in which different cultures could live_in harmony in their futuristic city . Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros offered a welcome word of support for these efforts , encouraging the youngsters to further their education and use whatever engineering expertise they might develop for the future of their communities . They deserve such plaudits for tapping the vigor and optimism of their youth , and applying their minds and hearts , to challenges of the future that are so daunting to so many of their elders .</TEXT>
