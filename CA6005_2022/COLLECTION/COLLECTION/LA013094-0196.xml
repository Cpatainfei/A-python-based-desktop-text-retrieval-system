   <HEADLINE> SURVIVORS OF AIDS VIRUS INSPIRE RESEARCH ; MEDICINE : ABOUT ONE-THIRD OF THOSE WHO CONTRACT HIV ARE STILL HEALTHY AFTER 14 YEARS . SCIENTISTS THEORIZE ON POSSIBLE REASONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Rob Anderson remembers how angry he felt back in 1985 when he read experts ' predictions about AIDS . Everyone who catches the virus would surely die from it , they said . By then , Rob Anderson had been infected for six years . &quot; I decided , ' I ' ll show them , ' &quot; he said . And he did . Anderson has had HIV , the AIDS virus , for about 15 years . He still is healthy . This raises a question that has begun to fascinate scientists : Why does the AIDS virus kill some people much more slowly than others ? Early in the brief history of this disease , death seemed to be the only certainty . More_than 200 # 000 Americans have been lost so far ; about 100 more die each day . Clearly , the longer people are infected with HIV , the more likely they are to fall ill with full-blown AIDS and die . But the course of this decline is unpredictable . Scientists wonder why , for instance , that 12 % of those infected with HIV go_on to develop AIDS within five years of catching the virus . Why do half stay healthy for 10 years ? Why are a third still going strong after 14 years ? The study of long-term HIV survivors has become a hot area of study in AIDS ; researchers would very much like to figure_out what makes these lucky few different . &quot; It ' s a question of following clues , &quot; said Dr. Lewis Schrager of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious_Diseases . &quot; We hope the clues will give us new ideas and directions for vaccine development and therapeutic strategies. &quot; The disease is so new that no one really knows how long people can live with the infection . The latest projections , however , suggest that 10 % to 17 % still will be alive and free_of disease 20 years after they catch HIV . Perhaps some will live_out full lives with their infections . Like so_much in AIDS , there are few clear answers to the &quot; why &quot; questions . Long-term HIV survivors like Anderson , a 40-year-old San Francisco artist , have their own theories . &quot; I feel it all goes_back to my attitude , &quot; he said . &quot; I won ' t let this make me ill . I ' ve watched quite a number of friends go from being relatively healthy to sick and dead in very short periods_of_time . In every case , they all bought_into the idea that you have to die from AIDS if you have HIV . I just simply don ' t agree with that. &quot; Others credit their diets , their vitamins , their medicines , their exercise , their meditation . But as far as scientists can tell , long-term survival has little to do with how people get infected , their sex habits , the food they eat or anything else they do . Instead , they are looking_at three main theories of why some people survive longer with HIV : * They are genetically different . * Their immune_systems work better . * They are infected with less rapacious strains of the virus . All three possibilities could be true . Most information about long-term survivors comes from studies of gay_men that began in the early 1980s , shortly after the AIDS epidemic started . The largest of these is the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study conducted by the National Institutes of Health . Of 4 # 954 men enrolled in the study , 1 # 809 already were infected at the outset in 1984 . Two similar studies in San Francisco are following a total of 2 # 700 men . The men in these studies give blood samples regularly so doctors can track the course of their infections . The AIDS virus attacks a crucial variety of white_blood_cells called helper T-cells or CD4 cells . Healthy people have about 1 # 000 of these cells per cubic_millimeter of blood . Most people experience an initial drop_in helper cells immediately after they get infected . Then , the loss almost -- but not quite -- levels_off . For years , the totals drop slowly . Eventually , they fall below 200 , and this puts people at risk of overwhelming infections , the hallmark of AIDS . The researchers are especially fascinated by Anderson and others who escape this inexorable damage . He , like perhaps about 5 % of all infected people , has not continued to lose helper cells . Instead , his levels are close to 800 . &quot; It will be imperative to follow these people for long periods_of_time to see what happens , &quot; Schrager said . &quot; Some may suddenly start losing CD4 cells . Some may never , which would be fascinating . There is clearly a hope that at least some of these people will represent a unique group , not just the tail of a normal distribution. &quot; If a difference in immune_responses explains long-term survival , some experts believe another type of virus-suppressing blood_cells called CD8 cells could be the key . Dr. John Phair of Northwestern University and others have noticed that long-term survivors have abnormally high levels of these white_cells in their bloodstreams . &quot; It tells us that CD8 cells play a very important role in the response to this infection , &quot; Phair said . Just why is unclear . But scientists are especially intrigued by the possible role of a variety of CD8 cells known as cytotoxic lymphocytes , which recognize HIV-infected CD4 cells and destroy them . Researchers theorize that long-term survivors might have more of these cells , or that the ones they have might do a better job of hunting_down infected CD4 cells before they release more copies of the virus into the blood . &quot; The question is : What ' s different with these people ? &quot; asked Dr. Susan Buchbinder of the University of California , San Francisco . She thinks genes may play a role , especially the human leukocyte antigens , or HLA , genes . These genes vary from person to person and play an integral role in regulating the immune_system . Buchbinder has found a particular pattern of HLA genes that appears to be more common among longtime HIV survivors . Other evidence suggests , however , that differences in the strains of virus people catch could be just as important as variations between people . Dr. David Vlahov of Johns Hopkins University studies genetic diversity in the virus . He found that some long-term survivors carry forms that stay genetically stable . Those who fall sick have HIV that mutates rapidly . A strange tragedy in Australia adds more evidence of the importance of viral strains . Between nine and 13 years ago , six people got HIV from blood_transfusions donated by one infected man . They ranged_in age from 35 to 77 and got blood for different medical reasons . The only thing they have in common is the outcome of their infections : All of them , as well as the donor , remain healthy . Differences in immune_system responses may account_for some people ' s longevity with HIV , said Dr. Jennifer Learmont of the Red_Cross Blood_Bank in Sydney . But &quot; in this case , &quot; she said , &quot; we think it ' s the bug. &quot; While long-term HIV survivors may find such theories interesting , many seem to view the virus as a personal foe , one that may eventually catch_up_with them . Even Anderson admits to apprehension when he catches the flu or a cold . LeBaron Moseby of Boston , who has been infected for at least nine of his 49 years , simply feels lucky to be alive . &quot; A lot of people want to be long-term survivors , &quot; he said . &quot; But I ' d rather be newly infected any day , knowing what I do about this virus. &quot;</TEXT>
