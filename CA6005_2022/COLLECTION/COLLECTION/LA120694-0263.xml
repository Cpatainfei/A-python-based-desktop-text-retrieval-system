   <HEADLINE> PUBLIC IS URGED TO TREAT OBESITY AS CHRONIC DISEASE ; HEALTH : MEDICAL PANEL CALLS FOR LONG-TERM WEIGHT MANAGEMENT RATHER THAN FOCUSING_ON LOSS ALONE . SURGERY , DRUGS SHOULD ALSO BE OPTIONS , REPORT FINDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Institute of Medicine called Monday for a fundamental change in public thinking about obesity , saying that the condition should be regarded not as a cosmetic problem but as &quot; an important , chronic , degenerative disease that debilitates individuals and kills prematurely. &quot; Treatment should be aimed toward long-term weight management , rather than weight loss alone -- with the goal of achieving and maintaining the appropriate weight for a person ' s overall health instead of for appearance only , the institute said . Anti-obesity medications and surgery , for example , &quot; deserve a new look as potentially powerful and effective weight-management treatments , if used properly , for some people , &quot; specifically those who have failed with other approaches , the report said . The panel urged health_professionals to consider changing the way anti-obesity drugs are administered -- typically they are limited to several months ' use -- so that such medications &quot; are treated similarly to those used for the treatment of other medical problems , such_as hypertension. &quot; The institute , part of the National Academy of Sciences , is a private , nonprofit organization chartered by Congress that advises the federal_government on health policy . While its recommendations are not binding , they typically wield considerable influence among decision-makers . The recommendations are likely to take_on added importance in light of a movement to promote more tolerance toward those who are overweight and an increasing body of scientific evidence indicating that obesity could have metabolic and genetic underpinnings . Last week , in fact , researchers announced that they have identified and cloned a gene responsible_for obesity . The gene is responsible_for secreting certain proteins , or &quot; satiety factors , &quot; which signal the brain that the stomach is_full , thus telling it to &quot; stop eating , &quot; the researchers said . Researchers believe that , when this gene is damaged or defective , the signal is not sent or received and obesity may result . Obese people often suffer discrimination , said the report , compiled by a panel of outside experts on internal_medicine , diet and nutrition and psychology . &quot; Perhaps most lay persons , health_care_providers and even obese individuals themselves do not perceive the metabolic nature of the disease and thus view obesity as a problem of willful misconduct -- eating too_much and exercising too_little , &quot; the report said . The term obesity refers to excess body fat , while the term overweight usually refers to an excess amount of total body_weight -- including all tissues . Men with more_than 25 % body fat and women with more_than 30 % are considered obese . One of every three American adults and one of every four teen-agers and children are obese , according to the panel . The condition has been associated with numerous medical ailments , including cardiovascular_disease and hypertension , certain cancers , such_as breast and colon_cancer and other chronic ailments at an annual health_care cost of more_than $ 70 billion a year , the committee said . However , obese individuals need not reach a rigid appropriate weight to improve their health , the panel said . &quot; Scientific evidence suggests strongly that dropping even small amounts of weight -- 10 % to 15 % of initial body_weight -- can reduce the risk of premature illness and death , &quot; the committee said . Meanwhile , former Surgeon Gen . C . Everett Koop launched a new campaign timed to coincide with the document on obesity , urging Americans to &quot; eat sensibly , exercise regularly , drop a_few pounds ( and ) shape up. &quot; Koop , backed by medical organizations , several food and other major corporations , said that his effort is designed to convince Americans of the benefits of even modest weight losses . He is to be joined today by First_Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton to kick_off the new campaign . After smoking , &quot; obesity-related conditions are the second leading cause of death in the United States , resulting in about 300 # 000 lives lost each year , &quot; Koop said . Americans spend more_than $ 33 billion annually on weight-loss programs and diet aids , such_as drinks and foods , a figure that does not factor_in &quot; human costs , &quot; such_as lowered self-esteem and clinical_depression , the panel said . &quot; We have an epidemic of obesity in this country among both adults and children , &quot; said Judith S . Stern , professor in the nutrition and internal_medicine departments at UC Davis , who chaired the panel . &quot; Tens of millions of people are dieting at any one time , spending billions on weight-loss programs , yet few reduce their body fat to a healthy level , and even fewer maintain the weight lost beyond two or three years , &quot; Stern added . &quot; They need tools for making better decisions about how to lose_weight . And all weight-loss programs should be encouraged to better serve the consumer. &quot; The panel urged the diet industry to engage in full disclosure when dealing with consumers , including releasing information about how well their programs work , approaches and goals . The committee also advised the public to judge the programs based on their success in achieving long-term weight loss , which is defined as maintaining at least a 5 % reduction in body_weight for a year or longer . The panel said that drugs and surgery , when used , should be combined with a program of diet , physical activity and behavior_modification . Panelists also said that gastric surgery that makes the stomach smaller helps reduce health_problems in severely obese patients who have failed with non-surgical measures .</TEXT>
