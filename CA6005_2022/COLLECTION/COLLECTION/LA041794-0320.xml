   <HEADLINE> CLICK-TO-NAVIGATE IS THE KEY TO CD-ROM . COMPTON ' S NEW MEDIA CLAIMS IT INVENTED THE TECHNOLOGY . DOES THAT MAKE ITS CARLSBAD TEAM A BAND OF MULTIMEDIA BULLIES OR THE ; MOTHERS OF INVENTION ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The patent , engraved on a gold_plate mounted on polished wood , hangs_on the wall at the headquarters of Compton ' s New Media , an unapologetically displayed as trophy from one of the young multimedia industry ' s most tumultuous -- and still unresolved -- episodes . The firm has not yet tried to enforce this virtual license to print money . And , with a chastened U.S. Patent_Office threatening to overturn the patent , the specter of Compton ' s as a wicked monopolist stifling innovation among multimedia fledglings may ultimately prove overblown . But the story of how the small company that created the first interactive encyclopedia came_to be viewed_as an industry villain has already become part of multimedia lore , providing insight into the growing pains of the much-celebrated medium . What Compton ' s does next , as it ponders whether to appeal last month ' s initial reversal of the patent , may change the balance_of_power in an industry where no one has yet gained a fixed ascendance . &quot; Luke has prevailed , and the force was initially with us , &quot; says Philip Dodds , executive_director of the Annapolis , Md.-based Interactive Multimedia Assn . &quot; The question is , will the empire strike back ? &quot; * A small army of companies is hoping to strike it rich -- or richer -- in the burgeoning business of multimedia , the catch-all term for interactive computer software , video_games and various pieces of the information superhighway that may eventually ferry digital news , entertainment , education and shopping opportunities to television_sets across America . So when Compton ' s announced last fall that it had won the right to charge license fees for the use of a search-and-retrieve technology , which serves as the foundation of nearly all such products , a lot of people were pretty upset . Some of them proposed a public burning of the CD-ROM discs that Compton ' s publishes and distributes . Others simply vowed to take the firm to court . Norman Bastin , Compton ' s free-wheeling executive_vice_president -- who bleaches his hair and likes to sing on stage at the firm ' s frequent trade show parties -- received hate mail and threats of physical violence . At the core of the dispute is a feeling among other pioneers in the field that Compton ' s was trying to steal the credit for , as the firm ' s promotional video boasts , &quot; creating multimedia &quot; -- and of doing_it with technology that competitors compare to a book publisher trying to claim patents on ink and paper . &quot; It ' s an emotional issue , &quot; says Peter Black , a Los Angeles-based CD-ROM developer whose products Compton ' s has distributed . &quot; Very few people in this industry are making money . The only thing you can walk home with at night is the assertion that you ' re one of the founders , that you ' re a part of history. &quot; Bastin , who helped found the firm ' s new-media division and is named as one of the inventors on the patent , is alternately defensive and defiant . &quot; I never wanted to be a toll road on the information highway , like everybody said , &quot; he insists . &quot; All I wanted was to be an AM-PM Mini-Mart off an exit somewhere. &quot; Yet , to the taunt that Compton ' s is striving to become the Microsoft of multimedia -- the ultimate insult in the software industry , where Microsoft is viewed_as a bully -- he says with a shrug , &quot; Microsoft is a very profitable company. &quot; CD-ROM software , the medium on which Compton ' s so far has sold nearly 3 million copies of its electronic encyclopedia , comes_on shiny , five-inch discs that are played_on a drive hooked_up to a personal_computer or a machine connected to a television_set . Like music compact_discs , they cannot be recorded over ( hence the ROM , for &quot; read-only_memory &quot; ) . In addition to sound , they hold pictures , video and text -- about 400 times the data that can fit on a typical floppy_disk . When Compton ' s first managed to squeeze the 26 volumes of its encyclopedia onto a CD-ROM in 1989 , it was considered a remarkable feat . ABC ' s &quot; Good_Morning America , &quot; Compton ' s Chicago-based CEO Stanley Frank likes to remember that did a live feed_on the product ' s introduction . The three years and $ 8.5 million that went_into it suddenly seemed worthwhile . Then owned by Encyclopaedia Britannica -- which gave_away the paper version of Compton ' s as a bonus for the kids to families who invested in the higher-brow Britannica -- Compton ' s went_on to break new ground in distribution of CD-ROMs , supplying capital to help other developers finish their products and persuading retail outlets to carry them . Compton ' s now boasts the largest market share_in the fast-growing industry . With sales doubling to more_than $ 60 million last year , it has published more_than 40 titles of its own and distributes 150 other programs from 22 publishers . To keep its maze of offices in Carlsbad from bursting at the seams , the firm just leased 30 # 000 square_feet of space next-door . Even its most vocal critics give Compton ' s credit for helping nurture multimedia in the early days . But the patent remains a sticking point . Patent No . 5 # 241 , 671 covers a commonly used way of storing and retrieving text linked to images on a CD-ROM . For example , when you click on the entry &quot; Kennedy , John F. &quot; in the multimedia menu of the encyclopedia , the 35th U.S. President ' s image appears in a window on your computer_screen . &quot; Ask not what your country can do for you . . . &quot; he begins , in a recording of his 1961 inaugural_address . Another click brings_up the text of an article chronicling Kennedy ' s life . A click on the camera icon next to the heading &quot; Weds Long_Island Beauty &quot; conjures_up Jacqueline Kennedy in a bouffant hairdo , with John Jr . and Caroline on her lap . Choose the highlighted &quot; See also Cuba &quot; at the end of a passage on 1962 events and you are transported to the Cuba heading and the start of a similar set of permutations . The ease with which one can browse through related topics -- and the vivid animation and images that could not be found in a stack of books -- have propelled annual sales of Compton ' s and its main electronic encyclopedia competitors , Grolier ' s and Microsoft ' s Encarta , far beyond those of the paper variety . * Over the last year , the technology has led to a 54 % explosion -- to 8 # 100 -- in the number of CD-ROM titles published , from children ' s games to mail-order catalogues to interactive pornography . A sampling of titles : &quot; Dinosaur Adventure , &quot; &quot; Multimedia Mozart &quot; and the Bible . It ' s a complex process to compress the video , come_up with interesting content and make_it all work together . But , says Tom Lopez , who heads the CD-ROM publishing_firm Mammoth Micro Productions in Seattle , the part of the process Compton ' s has patented is &quot; not rocket science. &quot; &quot; You click on a horse , you have a description of the horse . Or you click the word horse and you get a picture , &quot; Lopez says . &quot; that ' s what I would consider to be pretty obvious. &quot; In the wake of Compton ' s announcement of the patent award , Lopez and dozens of others in the multimedia industry claimed to know about tons of &quot; prior art &quot; -- products that used the patented technology before Compton ' s did . The Patent_Office was attacked as being stuck_in the past , incapable of assessing high-tech patent cases . Yet no one came_forward to submit any prior art to the agency after its new commissioner , Bruce Lehman , took the unusual step of ordering the claim re-examined . When the office tentatively reversed its decision last month , issuing a preliminary rejection of the patent ' s 41 claims , the reversal was based on a textbook description of the well-known computer_program Hypercard , which the examiner said predated Compton ' s &quot; SmarTrieve &quot; system . &quot; I certainly didn ' t see a lot of letters coming_across my desk saying , ' Here , Commissioner , here ' s a bunch of stuff I know. ' I think our customers could help us out a little more_than they do , &quot; Lehman says . * The issue is a structural one , he says . Software patent disputes often end_up in court , and inventors would rather save their best shots for the judge . To encourage third-party participation , Lehman has drafted legislation to make the patent_application process public , without the strict secrecy in which it now takes_place . Whether the ruling invalidating Compton ' s patent will be appealed is up_to Tribune Co. , the Chicago media conglomerate that bought the firm from Britannica last summer for $ 57 million -- a price some analysts believe was inflated by the assumed value of the patent . The plan was to use the patent to encourage publishers to sign distribution_agreements with Compton ' s . Those who didn ' t sign would pay a 3 % royalty on sales of their products . Those that did sign would get a better deal . Tribune spokesman Robert Carr says no decision on an appeal has been made . &quot; Heads are getting_together , but there has been no consensus , &quot; he says . Patent attorneys and industry observers expect Compton ' s to appeal at least some of the claims . While it ' s no fun to be perceived as the industry bully , it hasn ' t generally been known to hurt business . Tony Bove , who is developing a CD-ROM of_his_own on San Francisco ' s Haight-Ashbury district and says he may approach Compton ' s about distributing it , takes a pragmatic outlook . &quot; They ' re a company to reckon with , whether you like what they did or not , &quot; Bove says . &quot; I think they were foolish for trying to have an overly broad patent , but as for their bad-boy image -- there are a helluva lot of people in this industry who play hardball. &quot; Some industry observers say the outpouring of wrath against Compton ' s had more to do with resentment over the power it wields in distribution channels than the prospect of paying a small royalty fee . And even Compton ' s harshest detractors consider the firm one of_their_own compared to the media and software giants that have recently begun to crash their turf . Facing stiff competition from the real &quot; Microsoft of multimedia &quot; -- Microsoft itself -- and others , Bastin is trying to move beyond the patent dispute and focus_on the task of taking Compton ' s from its reference-book roots into the area of interactive entertainment . To that end , Compton ' s recently announced a joint_venture with Warner Bros. , producing a CD-ROM on the life of John Lennon . ( Bastin says Lennon ' s son , Sean , convinced Yoko Ono it was a good idea. ) A prototype includes a video clip of Lennon playing &quot; Imagine &quot; at his home_in New York and another of the Beatles performing &quot; Shake It Up &quot; for Queen Elizabeth_II . It also allows the user to click through a gallery of photographs . A new_line of audio CD-ROMs , which play music in a compact_disc player and images on a computer , is planned . The firm recently hired William Perrault , former vice_president of marketing for Columbia TriStar Home Video , to head its entertainment marketing efforts . And last week , Bastin threw a party at the New Media Expo conference in Los Angeles to introduce a CD-ROM about the band Heart . The group showed_up in_person to play a set . To help himself look_forward , Bastin has vowed not to mention the word patent . Yet he can ' t help stumbling over claiming another &quot; first &quot; as he describes the company ' s plans to produce a coffee_table book from digital images in a CD-ROM , based on the television_show &quot; Babylon 5. &quot; Rephrasing , he says with a sigh , &quot; Let ' s just say I don ' t know of any other book that ' s been done like this before. &quot; Multimedia Market Leader Compton ' s New Media , one of the pioneers in interactive_multimedia , is now the industry ' s largest company . But the Carlsbad firm ' s claim to have patented the key to creating multimedia software has not won it many firends in the fledgling field . * 1993 market share by revenue : Compton ' s : 18 % Software Toolworks : 16 % Interplay : 9 % Microsoft : 8 % Broderbund : 6 % Others : 43 % Source : Dataquest Inc .</TEXT>
