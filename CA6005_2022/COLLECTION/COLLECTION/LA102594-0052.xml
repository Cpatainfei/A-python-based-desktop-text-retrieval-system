   <HEADLINE> NEXT STEP ; NEW CONGRESS HAS AN IMAGE PROBLEM ; MEXICANS HOPE POLITICS WILL BE MORE OPEN NOW , BUT OLD WAYS DIE HARD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Congress that will be seated Thursday was expected to have a higher profile than previous legislatures , providing lively debate and generating proposals as part of the political diversity and democratic reform that political_leaders had promised . But the legacy of the last legislature , which officially retired Monday , is a reminder of the immense difference between Mexico ' s Congress being a forum for discussion and being a truly independent branch of government . The outgoing Congress was at center stage in the investigation into this country ' s second major assassination in six months -- the murder of Francisco Ruiz Massieu , who had been designated speaker of the new Chamber of Deputies . He was shot to death in what increasingly is being portrayed as a plot hatched by an outgoing committee chairman and his legislative cronies . The attorney_general had asked lawmakers to revoke the immunity from prosecution of a congressman suspected in the case , a process that would have required a congressional inquiry into his conduct . A hearing was scheduled , and deputies prepared_for the limelight . Then , the day before the hearing date , word came_down from the headquarters of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party , or PRI : Congress should bow_out of the investigation , and the Chamber of Deputies should grant the suspected congressman a leave , thus removing his immunity without an inquiry . After an emotional four-hour debate , the Chamber of Deputies ' most powerful committee seemed ready to rebel by rejecting that plan . &quot; In my conscience as a legislator , and trying to be loyal to the man -- my boss , my friend , Francisco Ruiz Massieu -- I have decided to vote against the leave_of_absence , &quot; Florecio Salazar , a deputy from the slain man ' s home state of Guerrero , told the committee . After his speech , Salazar broke_into tears . But after 20 minutes of arm-twisting by PRI congressional leaders during a recess , discipline was enforced . The committee relinquished the chamber ' s right to police its own members . &quot; Clearly , various PRI-istas were ready to vote ' no , ' but they tightened the screws , &quot; said Sen . Porfirio Munoz Ledo , chairman of the leftist opposition Democratic Revolutionary Party . That display of party discipline does not bode well for attempts to create an independent Congress with a PRI majority , analysts said . &quot; This was an exhibition of the old system of party control -- crude and primitive , &quot; Munoz said . Reformist members of the PRI acknowledge privately that they will have a hard_time persuading party stalwarts to loosen control , even of_their_own members , much less allowing the opposition more say . However , they still plan to try . &quot; We have to make the Congress the forum for discussing the national agenda , instead of the Zocalo , &quot; the capital ' s main plaza and site of daily protests , said Oscar Levin Coppel , leader of the city ' s 40-member PRI delegation . PRI members and right-wing opposition National Action Party , or PAN , officials were less than eager to respond to requests for interviews about the new legislature . &quot; All of the deputies are reluctant to talk , &quot; said one aide , who , like many of those interviewed , agreed to speak only on a pledge of anonymity . That reticence contrasts sharply with the campaign rhetoric of the two parties in the weeks before the Aug . 21 federal elections . While he was campaigning , Fernando Solana , a former Cabinet_minister who is expected to be majority_leader in the Senate , told reporters : &quot; I believe the Congress will become a political space worthy of participation , that this will be a new Senate . If not , I would have had no interest in participating. &quot; He spoke_of the need for a balance_of_powers , which a more vital legislature could provide . He even agreed with the blunt assessment of PAN Senate Minority_Leader Gabriel Jimenez that &quot; the executive_branch has been the strongest to the detriment of the other branches of government. &quot; &quot; Strong presidential powers used to serve us well , but this is a different era in history , &quot; Solana said . &quot; For the country to function well , we need a better balance of powers. &quot; A PRI majority in Congress already made that possibility less likely , said Ana Lilia Cepeda , an incoming deputy for the Democratic Revolutionary Party . &quot; We lost the opportunity to make the Chamber ( of Deputies ) a counterweight to the other branches of government , &quot; she said . But more devastating than the election is the loss of prestige the Congress has suffered in recent weeks , she said . As more attention focused_on the Chamber of Deputies , more citizens became aware of legislative traditions such_as &quot; The Bronx. &quot; Deputies who sit in the section by that name come mainly to wave banners and shout_down opposition speakers , she said . Citizens have even begun to sarcastically dub congressional representatives diputaditos , little deputies . Still , within the legislative crisis , many people insist that there are signs of hope . &quot; It will be much more difficult for the PRI to get its proposals approved without creating a consensus , &quot; Cepeda said . Levin Coppel said most PRI legislators want a new relationship of respect with the opposition . &quot; Let ' s act like adults , &quot; he proposed . &quot; Let ' s negotiate. &quot; In addition , Ruiz Massieu ' s killing demonstrated that there are divisions within the ruling party , observers agree , although PRI officials steadfastly deny this . &quot; The decomposition of the PRI shows that they are not the tight bloc we had thought , &quot; Cepeda said . Munoz Ledo said the Democratic Revolutionary Party is talking with the other major political_parties in Congress to try to reach a consensus on policy guidelines . PRI activists said opposition deputies and senators will be offered the chairmanships of minor committees and officer ' s posts on the more important committees that the ruling party will still chair . But a longtime Senate staffer cautioned that those who support opposition parties must be careful not to be tricked by the trappings of power-sharing if there is no substance . He said the opposition parties must also bear a share of the blame for the weakness of the legislative_branch , compared to the presidency . &quot; The opposition is not struggling for control of political power , but for the destabilization of the PRI , &quot; he observed . Munoz vowed that , in this legislature , the changes will go beyond rhetoric . &quot; A basic political consensus is the only way to create stability and govern the country , &quot; he said . &quot; The time of the PRI governing alone is over . If the PRI accepts this , OK . If not , the confrontations will continue to the detriment of the nation. &quot;</TEXT>
