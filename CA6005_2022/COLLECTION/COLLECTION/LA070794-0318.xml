   <HEADLINE> THE BUCK HOPS HERE ; THE PUNCHY U.S. DOLLAR IS FLYING_HIGH IN CANADA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While an American tourist in Paris these days might find the restaurant tab for le menu de degustation worse for the heart than a double dose of cholesterol , in this French-accented city just north of the U.S. border , the bill could tempt you to indulge in a second dessert . The U.S. dollar may be punchy in Europe and Japan , but it still packs its old wallop in Canada . The Canadian_dollar has hovered near 72 cents for about three months now , down four cents from the beginning of the year , six cents from a year ago and 11 cents since mid-1989 . Analysts here predict it will decline even more , perhaps matching the all-time low of 69.2 cents , struck in February , 1986 . While this may_not be great for Canadian pride -- or interest_rates -- it ' s not entirely bad for business here . Because the two economies are so closely tied -- nearly 80 % of Canada ' s trade is with the United States -- the weakening Canadian_dollar has created opportunities for Canadian exporters , U.S. companies that manufacture goods in Canada and the tourism industry . &quot; Although the U.S. dollar has been battered by the major currencies , it does much better against the Canadian_dollar , and that ' s likely to continue , &quot; said Robert Palombi , an economist with MMS International , a Toronto consulting_firm . He and other analysts project a continued downward trend for the Canadian_dollar based on uncertainty surrounding an upcoming provincial election in Quebec -- the Parti Quebecois , dedicated to Quebec independence , is leading in the polls -- and Canada ' s high public_debt . Canada has been following the United States out of recession this year , and the newest government figures , reported last week , show that the Canadian economy grew by 0.3 % in April , fueled largely by record exports , particularly of automobiles . While manufacturing and trade grew , retailing was off slightly , reflecting some nervousness about higher interest_rates . The prime rate jumped to 8 % from 5.5 % between February and June . The gap between U.S. and Canada interest_rates also has grown . For most Americans , however , the most noticeable effect of the widening currency exchange_rate is to make Canada a much more attractive vacation destination . With the summer tourism season just getting underway in_earnest in Canada , the buses are lining_up outside the landmark Chateau Frontenac hotel here , and rivers of tourists flow through the narrow streets of the walled old town . After nearly four years of recession , the tourism industry here looks_forward to a surge of U.S. visitors . Quebec innkeeper Valerie Andree Authier recently returned from a meeting with U.S. travel_agents , where she emphasized the favorable exchange_rate . Authier ' s inn , the 27-room La Pinsonniere , on the scenic Charlevoix coast of the St . Lawrence River east of Quebec_City , is a member of the exclusive Relais &amp; Chateaux group of resorts and restaurants , and doesn ' t exactly cater to bargain-hunters . Guests pay_up to $ 180 a night U.S. ( $ 250 Canadian ) for a premium room , and more if gourmet meals are included . But Authier ' s sales pitch is that La Pinsonniere is far more reasonable for American visitors than similar upscale inns just south of the border . She is careful to explain the exchange_rate to American callers and says that even in this price_bracket , &quot; it certainly does have an impact . . . . You ' re always trying to take_advantage of a better exchange rate. &quot; Hope McCatty , owner of the 23-room Dutch Inn ( $ 39.60 U.S. per night , $ 55 Canadian ) in Niagara Falls , Ontario , is_on a similar campaign . She doesn ' t think enough is being done to promote Canada as a destination . &quot; We don ' t advise the Americans enough that their dollars make Canada a good vacation , &quot; she said . &quot; I always mention it when I talk to Americans on the phone , but we have to do more. &quot; David Redekop , director of the Canadian Tourism Research Institute in Ottawa , said that in the first four months of 1994 , trips of one night or more by Americans to Canada were up 5 % over the same period last year . &quot; that ' s a trend we expect to continue , &quot; Redekop said . &quot; We expect a 5 % to 6 % increase this year ; in April alone it was up 6.2 % . &quot; The institute ' s research shows that the exchange_rate was a significant factor_in the increase , he added . At the same time , Canadians are staying home ; visits to the United States were down 10.6 % through April . John Hamilton , manager of communications for the Metropolitan Toronto Convention &amp; Visitors Assn. , said research on travel motivation shows that value is a secondary concern when selecting a vacation_spot , but may play more heavily into a decision about how to spend money once a tourist arrives . &quot; People don ' t select a destination first and foremost because it ' s a bargain , &quot; he said . &quot; It almost always is driven by having friends and family in the area or by things you want to do , such_as go_to museums . . . . Cost is not a primary motivator , but it ' s part of the equation. &quot; Similarly , the favorable exchange_rate has a contributing , but secondary , effect on other businesses . Take the automobile_industry . &quot; It ' s now an awful lot cheaper to build a car in Canada than the United States , &quot; said Robert Fairholm , chief economic forecaster for DRI Canada . &quot; They pay their workers in low Canadian_dollars and sell the cars in the United States for U.S. dollars. &quot; Last year , nearly 2.24 million vehicles were manufactured in Canada , half of them for export , according to DesRosiers Automotive Consultants Inc. of Toronto . &quot; Canada is the best spot in North_America , if not the world , to manufacture vehicles , &quot; said Dennis DesRosiers , who heads the firm . But the principal reason it is less expensive to manufacture here , he said , is the lower cost of health_care for employees . Canada guarantees care_for all under a tax-paid system administered by federal and provincial governments . The exchange_rate is &quot; a significant bonus , &quot; DesRosiers said . Canada ' s provincial film boards also factor the exchange_rate into their aggressive courting of Hollywood productions . Vancouver and Toronto are_well established movie-making centers ; Viacom recently announced it will produce 12 to 15 films , at a cost of $ 50 million , in Toronto over the next 12 months for its Showtime cable network . And this summer , cameras are rolling on Stephen King ' s &quot; Dolores Claiborne &quot; and on &quot; The Scarlet_Letter , &quot; starring Demi Moore , in Nova Scotia , which until last year had never hosted a major movie shoot . &quot; Producers always look_at the bottom_line , so when you get a spread ( in the exchange_rate ) like we ' ve had lately , it certainly helps , &quot; said Helen Wickwire Foster of the Nova Scotia Film Development Corp . But the drooping Canadian_dollar also means trouble for some businesses . Consider the Toronto Blue_Jays . Baseball ' s two-time defending World_Series champions pay their players ( estimated payroll $ 40.5 million ) and most other costs in U.S. dollars . But the bulk of their revenue is in Canadian_dollars . So , every one-cent decline of the Canadian_dollar costs the club about $ 850 # 000 , according to Howard Starkman , director of public relations . Where the Dollar ' s Strong The U.S. dollar has been falling_in Europe and Japan but is still strong in Canada .
