   <HEADLINE> AMWEST IS FOCUS OF INSURANCE REFORM BATTLE ; LITIGATION : SURETY_BOND FIRM , WITH EX-GOV . GEORGE DEUKMEJIAN PLAYING A ROLE , GOES BEFORE THE STATE SUPREME COURT IN BID TO WIN EXEMPTION FROM PROPOSITION 103 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After more_than five years of legal wrangling , an obscure company is taking center stage in the high-stakes battle over insurance reform in California . Since voters passed Proposition 103 in 1988 , auto and property insurance heavyweights such_as 20th Century and State Farm have been the most visible challengers of the measure that sought to rebate 20 % in premiums to policyholders . Meanwhile , the Proposition 103 case of Amwest Insurance Group Inc. , which deals in the esoteric world of surety_bonds , got little attention . But last month , the California Supreme Court agreed to hear the Woodland Hills company ' s suit , which seeks to exempt the surety business from Proposition 103 . Amwest has become the litmus test for the 120 or so firms in the state that write surety_bonds , although it may be a year before the court reaches a decision in the Amwest case . Amwest ' s case has even taken_on political overtones . Former Gov . George Deukmejian , a Republican who appointed five of the seven Supreme Court justices and is now a lawyer in private practice , is working for Surety Co . of the Pacific ( SCP ) , based in Northridge . In January , Deukmejian filed a letter on behalf of SCP , which is an &quot; amicus , &quot; or friend of Amwest , before the court agreed to hear the Amwest case . &quot; This case is starting to pick_up momentum like a snowball in terms of notoriety , &quot; said Larry Rothstein , an attorney for Amwest . &quot; I think it ' s going_to be one of the most watched_cases in recent memory. &quot; Richard H . Savage , who founded Amwest and now runs the company with his son John , is a bit wary of the notoriety . He estimates that the case has so far cost Amwest about $ 200 # 000 in legal_fees . But the 74-year-old company chairman put the legal case simply : &quot; It ' s economic survival. &quot; Surety insurance is when a contractor buys bonds from a company like Amwest as a guarantee that a contract -- whether to paint a post_office or build an office complex -- will be completed . Amwest generally charges a premium of 1.5 % to 2.5 % of the bond amount . If the contractor can ' t finish the job , the surety company has to either give the contractor more money or hire another one . According to the Department of Insurance , the Proposition 103 initiative could require those surety companies operating in California to refund retroactively up_to $ 100 million in premiums to customers . Amwest , which did about 28 % of its business in the state in 1993 , questions that figure . John Savage , Amwest ' s president , figures that the maximum surety industry rebate is $ 60 million . As for Amwest , &quot; we don ' t want to write a million-dollar check , &quot; he said . Whatever the exact liability , the Savages claim that their bottom_line would be seriously affected . Once losses and expenses are added_up , the company ' s profit_margin is only 4 cents for every $ 1 of premiums . &quot; If you ' re going to reduce gross income by 20 % , we ' ll be losing money , &quot; Richard Savage said . With their 40 % ownership of Amwest ' s stock , the Savage family also has a personal interest in the outcome of their Proposition 103 case . At a recent price of $ 14 a share , their Amwest stake is worth about $ 13 million . From the beginning , the crux of Amwest ' s lawsuit has been that surety companies should not be liable to pay anything in the first place . Surety firms , the plaintiffs argue , should have been exempted from the initiative like other forms of business insurance such_as workers ' compensation insurance . With Amwest and four other surety firms lobbying , the Legislature passed a bill in 1990 amending Proposition 103 to exclude surety from its provisions . Voter Revolt , the consumer group that sponsored the initiative , stepped into the case and countersued Amwest . The amendment , the group argued , was unconstitutional as it did not &quot; further the purposes &quot; of Proposition 103 . * In January , an appeals court agreed with Voter Revolt and struck_down the 1990 surety amendment . Now the Supreme Court has agreed to review that decision and , according to legal_experts , the key issue will be whether the Legislature has the constitutional authority to tinker with an initiative that has already passed . &quot; If the ( state ) Supreme Court reverses the lower court . . . within a year , all_of 103 will be repealed , &quot; predicted Voter Revolt ' s Harvey Rosenfield , chief author of the measure . Saying it is outraged by Deukmejian ' s involvement in the case , Voter Revolt is considering &quot; options &quot; to ensure an impartial review . Richard Savage went_into business quite late in life after surviving fights of a different sort . A radar controller in the South Pacific during World_War_II , he went_on to work in law_enforcement , fighting crime with the Palo Alto police_force , California Highway Patrol and Justice_Department ' s narcotics force . He founded Amwest in 1975 as a bail_bond agency , a field he was familiar_with from his law_enforcement days . But he soon diversified into other forms of surety_bonds , notably those required by contractors working for government_agencies . In 1988 , after several years of rapid_growth , Amwest was writing premiums of $ 36 million , while profits had climbed to $ 3.6 million , up from $ 258 # 000 in 1980 . The company , which went public in 1985 , was_well on the way to opening offices in all 50 states . Since those heady days , growth has slowed . In 1993 , Amwest grossed $ 57.7 million in premiums and made a profit of $ 3.8 million , including its investment income . In the extremely fragmented surety market in California , it is an undisputed leader . According to the A . M . Best rating company , it was the third biggest surety firm in the state in 1992 with a market share of 5.3 % , trailing only Reliance and Fireman ' s Fund . By comparison , SCP wrote $ 6.8 million in premiums in 1992 in California , its only market , giving it a market share of 2.2 % . The company mainly writes bonds that contractors need so they can be licensed in California . When the measure rolling back insurance rates was passed_by a narrow margin in November , 1988 , Amwest wasted no time in challenging it . &quot; We filed suit the day after the election , &quot; John Savage recalled . &quot; We knew the bill had a pretty good chance of passing and the lawsuit was prepared months in advance. &quot; According to some observers , it was a typically bold step . &quot; If Amwest hadn ' t done_it , it ' s problematical any ( surety firm ) would have done_it , at least not that early , &quot; said Gerry Desmond , a lobbyist for the Assn . of California Surety Cos . As the current case makes its way through the Supreme Court , Amwest claims that it is trying to steer clear of the political fray . Both Savages stressed that they want the case decided &quot; on a rational basis &quot; and that it was Surety Co . that brought Deukmejian on board -- SCP ' s chairman , William Erwin , was a leading contributor to the former governor ' s campaigns . &quot; If Surety Co . wants to employ their own counsel , there ' s nothing we can do about it , &quot; Richard Savage said . &quot; We had no input at all. &quot; But Amwest is still happy to serve as point_man , however controversial the case may get . &quot; It has to do with being in control of your fate , &quot; John Savage said . &quot; We control the actual litigation with our attorneys . We know the points we want to get heard are being heard. &quot; &quot; The only downside , &quot; he added , &quot; is we end_up paying more money &quot; to lawyers .</TEXT>
