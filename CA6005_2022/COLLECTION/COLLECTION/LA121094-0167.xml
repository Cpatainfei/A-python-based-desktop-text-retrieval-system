   <TEXT> The hopes for a Middle_East peace , ignited when Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization reached their historic agreement on Palestinian self-government last year , seem to be fading even as the men who fashioned the Declaration of Principles receive the Nobel Peace Prize here today . Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat , who forged what they proudly called the &quot; peace of the brave , &quot; complain that the other is not honoring the accord . Their supporters are bitter about the failures , asking daily about the promised peace and the &quot; new Middle East. &quot; Their opponents scream &quot; betrayal &quot; ever more loudly . Even Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres , a visionary statesman with almost boundless optimism , has grown tired . Frustrated by the lack of progress , he acknowledges that the agreement he fashioned in months of secret negotiations here last year may have to be amended . Shlomo Gazit , a retired Israeli general and one of the region ' s foremost strategic analysts , calls the Nobel awards ceremony at which Rabin , Peres and Arafat will be honored today &quot; the last chord of a dying process. &quot; Only a &quot; miracle &quot; -- tough decisions taken unflinchingly on hard issues by the now-wavering leaders -- will restore lost momentum to Arab-Israeli peacemaking , Gazit said . Few in the Middle_East would disagree that this would be a political miracle . That reality fell_short_of both Israeli and Palestinian hopes is clear . Israelis , for whom security is paramount , count more_than 70 dead in the last year , most civilians and half of them killed in suicide bombings carried_out in Israeli cities by Islamic radicals opposed to the peace accord . * Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have seen a sharp decline in their already miserable living standards since Arafat ' s Palestinian Authority took_charge of the territory in May . Only a third of the $ 700 million promised by the West in immediate economic assistance has materialized as the PLO and the World_Bank have argued about accounting practices . In the West_Bank , the Palestinian Authority now operates the education , health , welfare and tourism departments . It is starting to collect taxes to finance these services . But Israeli troops remain heavily deployed in the region , and deadly clashes with residents continue . The Palestinians ' first national elections , originally scheduled for last July and intended to establish a democratically chosen government for the West_Bank and Gaza Strip , have been postponed once and twice again while Israel and the PLO negotiated the size and powers of the planned council . If agreement is reached soon on the council , elections might be held_in spring . Arafat ' s political leadership and his day-to-day administration are widely criticized by Palestinians as ranging from inept to chaotic , from corrupt to despotic . After Palestinian police fought bloody battles with the Islamic Resistance Movement , a radical fundamentalist group known as Hamas , there were fears of a Palestinian civil_war . &quot; The gap between ceremony and reality is stretching the peace process to its limits , not just between the two opposing sides ( Arabs and Israelis ) but also between the social_classes here , &quot; commentator Doron Rosenblum wrote last month in the influential Israeli newspaper Haaretz in terms that also echoed Palestinian complaints . &quot; For the patrician caste in power , which travels_by Volvo or Mercedes , there is no end to festivities , to trips abroad , to toasts drunk in fine company , &quot; he noted . &quot; Meanwhile , those who travel_by bus and shop in the markets continue to be targets of terrorism , to pay ever-higher prices and taxes and to lose their savings in a crumbling stock_market . It is no wonder that not just Palestinians but also more and more Israelis are asking what exactly they have gained from the peace. &quot; Rabin , who with Peres was jeered by right-wing Israelis and American Jews as they left synagogue services here Friday night , acknowledged the opposition he faces at_home but reminded critics : &quot; We came ( to power ) after democratic elections to bring_about a change in the Middle_East , to give peace a chance . . . . Of course , there are risks , but the opportunities are much greater. &quot; People should &quot; not expect immediate results -- not everything in life is instantaneous , &quot; he said . * Still , Israelis see the &quot; peace process &quot; as an experiment they evaluate at each stage before deciding whether to go_on . Right now , there is much hesitation ; even Rabin ' s Cabinet needed three days ' debate this week on how , even whether , to proceed . Among Palestinians , the question is no less profound . &quot; It is hard to see how all this is leading to an independent Palestine , &quot; said Dr. Haidar Abdel-Shafi , the respected Gaza physician who led the Palestinian delegation to the 1991 Middle_East peace conference in Madrid . &quot; What I think we are beginning to understand is the illusory nature of the Oslo agreement . . . . But how do we get_out of it ? We may have gone much too far to turn_back , but may have also made_it impossible for ourselves to go forward. &quot; For all this , however , there are achievements that were difficult for most Israelis and Palestinians to imagine before the Declaration of Principles was signed . Apart from troops guarding Jewish settlements , Israel has withdrawn its forces from the Gaza Strip , ending 27 years of military occupation and permitting establishment of the first-ever Palestinian administration there . This was no less a gain for Israelis than it was for the 850 # 000 Gazans . As they begin take_over government functions in the West_Bank , Palestinians are laying a firmer foundation than in Gaza for the independent state they hope to establish at the end of the five-year period of autonomy . Palestinian political violence -- factional clashes , assassinations , widespread security arrests -- has been far less than many top Israeli officials predicted ; Arafat ' s efforts have been aimed largely at bringing his opponents into the embryonic political_system . * And , as even critics of Israel ' s accord with the PLO acknowledge , without that agreement addressing the core issue of the Arab-Israeli conflict there would not have been the Israeli peace_treaty with Jordan , the Middle_East economic summit in Casablanca , Morocco , and prospects of a treaty with Syria next year . &quot; We carry a very heavy burden for our own people , for the Palestinian nation , but we also have a burden for the other Arabs , &quot; said Nabil Shaath , the Palestinian planning minister and a top negotiator with Israel , &quot; for resolution of the Palestinian problem is the precondition for resolution of the whole Arab-Israeli conflict and thus for peace in the Middle East. &quot; The agreement worked_out in the months of secret talks in and around Oslo by Israel and the PLO with Norwegian mediation , in fact , set Arafat a task verging on the impossible : The PLO was to take the Gaza Strip -- one of the most impoverished , pestilential and violent places in the Middle_East -- and within months turn it into a showcase of democracy , prosperity and tranquillity . The PLO ' s success would depend_on Israel ' s pullback in the West_Bank , further negotiations on the status of Jerusalem , the future of Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories and , above all , a Palestinian state , perhaps independent but probably linked to Jordan in a confederation . All this might bring only a &quot; small peace &quot; -- the absence of war -- but it is a peace that Rabin and some Arab leaders see as an effective alliance between the Jewish state and its moderate Arab neighbors against the spread of Islamic radicalism .
