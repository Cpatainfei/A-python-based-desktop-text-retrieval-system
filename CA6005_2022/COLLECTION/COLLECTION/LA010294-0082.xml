   <HEADLINE> RHYME AND REASON ; PSYCHIATRIST USES POETRY TO HELP UNRAVEL PATIENTS ' PROBLEMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was a helicopter crash in Vietnam that led Whittier psychiatrist Owen Heninger to discover the healing power of poetry therapy . A young soldier killed in the crash was the son of one of Heninger ' s patients , a dentist who had helped his son overcome some physical obstacles so he could enlist in the Army . After the young_man ' s death , the father was overwhelmed with remorse , blaming himself , feeling suicidal . Heninger had been treating the man for about a month , but wasn ' t making much progress . Then Heninger remembered a poem he had learned in high_school . Heninger , 64 , had never been much of a poetry enthusiast . There never seemed to be time for it . He ' d been a soldier in the Korean_War , then a pre-med student at Brigham Young University , then a medical_school student , a doctor , a psychiatrist . He was a scientist , not a dreamy poetry lover . Still , there was something about the poem that he remembered . The poem was Matthew Arnold ' s &quot; Sohrab and Rustum , &quot; an adaptation of an ancient Persian work about a warrior who mistakenly kills his own son . It reads , in part : For some are born to do great deeds , and live , As some are born to be obscured , and die . Do thou the deeds I die too young to do , And reap a second glory in thine age : Thou art my father , and thy gain is mine . &quot; He didn ' t get_to talk to his son before he died , &quot; Heninger says , &quot; and I thought that the words the son says in the poem might give him solace. &quot; After Heninger gave him the poem , the father came_out of his depression and was able to go_back to work , the psychiatrist says . Heninger didn ' t make too_much of it at the time , but about seven years later he was treating a woman also suffering from depression over a child ' s death . Recalling the earlier case , Heninger suggested that the woman read and write poetry . &quot; When I read the poems she wrote , I saw that she was saying things she couldn ' t or would n ' t say in therapy , &quot; Heninger says . In particular , Heninger says , a poem the woman wrote revealed her hatred for her brother-in-law , whom she blamed for her daughter ' s death . Heninger used the feelings revealed in the poem to treat the woman . &quot; Eventually she recovered , &quot; Heninger says . Success with two patients made him realize that poetry could be helpful in his work . &quot; I put two and two together . Here were two people who had recovered through this unusual treatment involving poetry . . . . I just stumbled onto it , like the guy who used mold to treat a wound and later found_out it was penicillin. &quot; What Heninger had stumbled onto was in fact a longstanding but relatively obscure form of therapy that a_few psychologists and psychiatrists were already using . After attending a UCLA course on poetry therapy taught by psychologist Arthur Lerner , a pioneer in the field who had been using it since the 1940s , Heninger jumped into poetry therapy with both feet . Although he already had enough degrees to fill a good-sized wall , he went_back to school , taking literature and poetry classes at Rio Hondo College and Cal State Fullerton while maintaining his practice . Last summer , he received a Registered Poetry Therapist Credential from the National Assn . for Poetry Therapy , one of only about a dozen mental_health professionals who hold the title . And what exactly is poetry therapy ? There are two forms , Heninger said . One involves exposing patients to poetry written by others that will &quot; strike a healthful resonance &quot; within the patient , such_as the effect the Arnold poem had_on the father of the dead soldier . One poet Heninger uses often with his patients is Emily Dickinson , who he admits is his favorite . &quot; She has written poems that describe post-traumatic stress disorder better than the textbooks , &quot; Heninger says , citing a Dickinson poem that includes the lines , &quot; After great pain , a formal feeling comes. &quot; The other , more active form of poetry therapy involves poetry written by the patient , which Heninger says can serve as &quot; a window to the soul. &quot; &quot; The ordinary defenses may be bypassed by poetry . . . . Writing poetry has allowed unconscious material to become conscious , overcoming or bypassing repression , and has brought_about genuine self-recognition , &quot; he wrote in a journal for mental_health professionals . Heninger goes_over patients ' poetry with them , line by line , to uncover the meanings that they did not consciously know were there . Often , Heninger says , &quot; poetry reveals , but it reveals by concealing . . . . Instead of saying ' you dirty S.O.B. , ' you put it in poetic terms. &quot; Again Heninger cites Dickinson : &quot; Tell all_the Truth but tell it slant -- Success in Circuit lies Too bright for our infirm Delight The Truth ' s superb surprise As Lightning to the Children eased With explanation kind The Truth must dazzle gradually Or every man be blind Although only a relative handful of Heninger ' s patients are undergoing poetry therapy -- he also uses more traditional forms of psychotherapy and medication -- he believes there could be a value in it for almost everyone except the drug-addicted or extremely psychotic . &quot; There ' s poetry in everybody , &quot; he says , &quot; although they may_not think_of it as poetry. &quot; Heninger and other advocates of poetry therapy admit that not everyone in the mental_health field is sold on the concept . &quot; Not everyone is accepting of it , &quot; says Lerner , editor of &quot; Poetry in the Therapeutic Experience. &quot; &quot; But I think as there is gradually a better understanding of what it ' s about , it is going_to be used more and more. &quot; Heninger hopes that his scheduled appearance with Lerner and other poetry therapy experts at the American Psychiatric Assn . Convention in Philadelphia this year will generate interest among psychiatrists . &quot; If other psychiatrists find poetry therapy as useful as I have , &quot; Heninger says , &quot; I think it ' s going_to keep growing and growing and growing. &quot;</TEXT>
