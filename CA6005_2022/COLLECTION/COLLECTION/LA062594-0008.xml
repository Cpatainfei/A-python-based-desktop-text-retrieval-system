   <HEADLINE> BLACKS ' HEART_DISEASE RATES TIED TO ARTERY CONSTRICTION ; HEALTH : BLOOD_VESSELS RETURN TO NORMAL SIZE MORE SLOWLY THAN IN WHITES , STUDY FINDS . IT MAY LEAD TO NEW TREATMENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The first physical explanation of why African Americans are prone to high_blood_pressure , cardiovascular_disease and strokes has been announced by researchers who say the findings may open the door to the development of new treatments . University of Georgia scientists found that arteries from black patients with severe heart_disease were unable to return quickly to normal size after they had constricted in response to stress or medications . This relaxation is impaired , they found , because cells lining the arteries do not produce chemicals that stimulate enlargement . The sustained constriction increases blood_pressure , places extra stress on the heart and increases the risk of a vessel rupturing , Dr. Randall Tackett reported Friday at the Ninth International Interdisciplinary Conference on Hypertension in Blacks , held_in Cleveland . Blacks have a 27 % higher death rate from heart_disease than whites and are twice as likely to die from stroke . Tackett ' s team made the discovery using leftover artery tissue from heart bypass recipients to test the arteries ' ability to relax . Similar , as yet unreported results from a team in New York that used a different technique support Tackett ' s findings , suggesting that researchers may be_well along the road to explaining the high rate of hypertension and related diseases in blacks . As a result of Tackett ' s findings , the researchers say they now will be able to test and develop medications to see which are most effective for blacks . And an understanding of the mechanism should make_it possible to design highly specific new agents targeted at blacks ' hypertension , they added . &quot; This is a tantalizing , extremely interesting finding whose significance is in its promise &quot; for drug development , said Dr. Stevo Julius of the University of Michigan . &quot; But we cannot take it as a resolution of the issue , &quot; he cautioned . &quot; This helps to explain a number of things that previously seemed unexplainable , &quot; said Dr. Jan L . Houghton of the Albany Medical College in New York . In particular , she added , it shows that the high rate of hypertension and related disorders in blacks is &quot; a public health_problem , not just a sociological problem. &quot; Some researchers have previously suggested that the susceptibility of blacks to the disorders is socioeconomic and cultural , reflecting lack of access to physicians , failure to take prescribed medicine and similar factors . Although the difference in blood_vessels between blacks_and_whites is most likely genetic in origin , Tackett said , &quot; we can ' t say that ( this is proved by ) our particular study at this point. &quot; Studying the problem in the laboratory has been extremely difficult because there are no animal models that distinguish between races , and ethical problems forbid most experimentation on humans . &quot; We spent two years identifying tissues that we could use in such studies , &quot; Tackett said . &quot; Our first idea was to use placental tissues from local hospitals , &quot; but blood_vessels in the placenta are different from those elsewhere in the body , he said . That would also exclude males from the study . Blood_vessels from people killed in traffic accidents were also rejected because the tissues would deteriorate in the time required to procure them after death . Vessels from coronary_artery bypass operations , in which a blood_vessel from the leg is used to replace clogged vessels near the heart , seemed like a good possibility . But the supply is limited because , as studies have documented , blacks have had much less access than whites to expensive procedures such_as bypass surgery . Nevertheless , Tackett ' s team found two cardiovascular surgeons in nearby Augusta whose patients included a large_number of blacks . Because the operations are scheduled in_advance , a team member could be present at the hospital for the surgery , collect the leftover tissue , and rush the 100 miles to their Georgia laboratory to perform tests . They used tissue from 60 whites and 22 blacks . In the tests , Tackett ' s group exposed the artery tissue to a drug that caused it to constrict , then applied other drugs that would normally cause it to relax . Tissues from whites uniformly relaxed rapidly in response to the drugs , whereas those from blacks relaxed much less during the same period . With the drug acetylcholine , for example , blacks ' vessels became only 19 % larger during the same time in which whites ' vessels became 34 % larger . Furthermore , biochemical tests showed that the impairment occurred because the cells that line the arteries of blacks could not release a chemical that normally promotes relaxation . That chemical , the gas nitric_oxide , has recently been identified as a signaling agent throughout the body , released by one group of cells to tell others to carry_out a specific function . In this case , nitric_oxide secreted by the endothelial cells orders the blood_vessels to relax . Tackett ' s findings have been confirmed by Albany ' s Houghton , who normally performs cardiac catheterization -- the insertion of diagnostic probes into blood_vessels near the heart -- in patients thought to be suffering a heart_attack . If the patient has not had a heart_attack , Houghton seeks permission to perform an experiment while the catheter is still in position . She administers small amounts of the same drugs Tackett used and measures changes in blood flow , an indirect measure of vessel relaxation . Working with about 400 patients , evenly divided between blacks_and_whites , she found that more_than 90 % of the blacks had an impaired ability to relax their vessels , compared to fewer than 40 % of the whites . In whites , furthermore , &quot; you have to have a much more severe degree of hypertension for ( the problem ) to show_up , &quot; she said . Houghton says the two approaches are complementary . &quot; With my work , you have to be very careful that you don ' t hurt the patient doing the study , so you probably can ' t learn as much , as fast . On the other hand , working with the intact individual , you are sure that nothing has been changed by the vessels being excised. &quot; She plans to present her results later this year at the American Heart Assn . meeting .</TEXT>
