   <HEADLINE> STANTON PROPOSES EL TORO JAIL , FUNDED BY MUSICK SITE SALE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> County Supervisor Roger R . Stanton said Tuesday that he is working_on a proposal to shut_down and sell the James A . Musick Branch Jail in Irvine and use the proceeds to build a new jail at El Toro Marine Corp Air_Station . &quot; It makes a lot of sense to me , &quot; Stanton said . &quot; We would be able to put a new jail in a truly remote place , something the county has always wanted. &quot; Stanton said he and his staff are investigating the merits of such a proposal . He added that he intends to discuss the idea with other members of the Board of Supervisors in the next few weeks . Since the Musick facility ' s operations are already budgeted , Stanton said , the county would need to pay only for the construction of a new jail at the 4 # 700-acre base , which is scheduled to close by 1999 . That construction , he suggested , would be offset by the sale of Musick , which is located on 100 acres of prime real_estate in Irvine . Not only would the county get a facility in a remote area , Stanton said , but a residential community in Lake Forest , which is adjacent to the Irvine facility , would get_rid_of a jail and the problems associated with it . Stanton , who described his ideas as preliminary , added that the new facility could potentially be expanded when the county has more funds to address its severe jail overcrowding problem . &quot; It ' s certainly an interesting concept , &quot; said Lake Forest Councilwoman Helen Wilson . &quot; The fact that facility would be relocated would definitely be something that we would want to look at. &quot; Irvine City_Manager Paul Brady Jr . said the he would &quot; wait and see if it pencils out or makes_sense before I comment. &quot; He said the Musick jail has had only a minimal impact on his city . Stanton said his proposal would not preclude the development of a commercial airport at the base -- a plan that was approved by Orange County voters Nov . 8 through Measure A . Musick is a minimum-security facility that is equipped to house 1 # 256 inmates , county officials said . County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider said it is an older facility that &quot; is fast approaching the end of its useful life. &quot; * &quot; If we can get something that would replace it , that would be great , &quot; he added . Schneider said Stanton ' s proposal &quot; has merit and ( county staff ) would look_forward to working with him on the details . . . . It ' s a potential win for everybody. &quot; The county could get El Toro property for free because the federal_government encourages local_governments to use part of closed bases for jail facilities , Schneider said . In fact , the federal Bureau of Prisons has also submitted a request with the Department_of_Defense for up_to 200 acres of the base for a minimum-security prison . Although the details of his proposal are sketchy , Stanton said his idea could help the county form a long-term plan to meet its jail overcrowding problem and possibly avert future expansions at the county ' s Main Jail in Santa Ana , which is in Stanton ' s 1st District . Recently , the Orange County Grand_Jury issued a report recommending that the county build a 3 # 000-bed maximum- to medium-security jail next the Sheriff ' s Department headquarters in Santa Ana at Flower Street and Santa Ana Boulevard . The panel also said the county should build another 3 # 000-bed , maximum- to medium-security facility next to the Musick jail . The board is expected to discuss the grand_jury ' s report next Tuesday . Supervisor William G . Steiner , who last week negotiated a tentative agreement with the city of Orange that would set the stage for a 1 # 660-bed expansion of Theo Lacy Branch Jail in Orange , said he would be supportive of a plan that would share the jail burden throughout the county . Steiner said a &quot; critical &quot; aspect of the negotiations with Orange officials was a commitment from the county that it would consider other jail sites and expansions . Supervisor Gaddi H . Vasquez said he would reserve judgment on any proposal until he has had a chance to study it . Supervisors Thomas F . Riley and Harriett M . Wieder could not be reached for comment . Stanton ' s jail proposal was not the first time he has suggested that the county look_into base reuse development projects . Last September , the supervisor suggested that part of the base be used as a satellite campus of USC or some_other academic institution . His staff is still looking_into that proposal . * AIRPORT LAND REQUEST County will formally ask Navy for El Toro land to use as civilian airport . B5</TEXT>
