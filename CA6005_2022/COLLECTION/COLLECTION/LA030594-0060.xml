   <HEADLINE> NO GAIN FROM TOO MUCH PAIN ; HELPING DOCTORS HUMANELY TREAT CANCER PATIENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A federally appointed medical panel has now confirmed what cancer patients , but apparently not their doctors , long have known : They suffer enormous , intractable pain and are often not treated adequately for it . Certainly doctors have had cause to err on the side of caution , fearing malpractice suits if their patients became addicted to opiates . But too often they have acted_out of ignorance or relied_on outdated medical myths . Some doctors think the pain is imagined , others fear turning their patients into street-drug abusers . Other doctors apparently hold the view that the very young and the very old tolerate pain better than other people . THE MYTHS : The panel -- led by a prominent nurse educator and two top oncologists -- has now blown away these and other myths about pain . In publishing new clinical guidelines for doctors and nurses , it concluded that &quot; undertreatment of cancer pain is common because of clinicians ' inadequate knowledge &quot; and that pain can be controlled by &quot; relatively simple means &quot; in nine of every 10 patients . A summary of the guidelines is in Thursday ' s issue of the New England Journal of Medicine , along with a new yearlong national study of cancer outpatients that concluded that 42 % were not given adequate analgesic therapy . The study found that physicians working_at centers catering to minorities were three times as likely as others to underestimate the severity of pain and prescribe insufficient doses of painkillers . The new guidelines urge a varied , graduated approach to pain management , starting with simple remedies like aspirin and acetaminophen , or hypnosis and relaxation therapy . But the panel urges doctors , when all else fails , not to shrink_from an aggressive regimen of morphine and other opiates , and it gives specific recommended doses for both children and adults . In so doing , the panel dismisses the main fear about such drugs : that they cause addiction . Tolerance , or the need for increasing doses of opiates over time , the report states , usually means the disease has advanced , not that the patient is becoming addicted ; those with stable disease can be maintained on a steady dose for weeks or months . It says that tolerance often is confused with the psychological dependence , or addiction , seen in drug_abuse . THE MILLIONS : This is a conclusion of wide interest not only to doctors and nurses but many American families . A million new cases of cancer are diagnosed annually in the United States , and the disease is the cause of one in five deaths . Anyone who has had a loved one die of cancer knows of the agony . It is often unnecessary . These guidelines should give support to doctors who have withheld pain-relieving medications out of fear of attracting the interest of the Drug Enforcement Administration , state medical boards or malpractice lawyers . The government is making available free consumer guides_on the recommendations in English and Spanish , as well as a more detailed , 200-page version for clinicians .
