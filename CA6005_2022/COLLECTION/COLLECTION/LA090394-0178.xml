   <HEADLINE> BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI ; DESPITE HARD WORK , TOO MANY SHOTS HAVE STOPPED PADILLA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Take a rest ? Zack Padilla had already taken a self-imposed three-year break from boxing , so once he got_back in , he was in_for good , every day in every way . Rest_on his laurels ? He won a title in June last year , and went_back into the gym shortly thereafter . Back_off and take_it_easy ? Sometimes it seemed that Padilla was trying to make_up for his three-year sabbatical all at once . If he ever took a backward step during a professional bout , it was neither recorded by video nor noticed by those who watched him fight . Then he would jump back into seven- , eight- and 10-round sparring sessions with lightweight prospect Shane Mosley as quickly as his body would allow . Padilla was preparing_for a hoped-for fight with Pernell Whitaker , considered the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world and the gateway to riches Padilla had , as yet , not experienced . &quot; Zack is a down-to-earth person , &quot; Mosley said . &quot; He doesn ' t let stardom get_to him like : ' I ' m the champion , I don ' t have to do this. ' He realizes what it took_to get him the title , and that ' s what it takes_to keep him there . One thing : hard work. &quot; But Tuesday at the Azusa Boxing Club , Padilla ' s body finally would n ' t allow it any more . Although suffering from severe headaches since his last bout , a 10-round technical_knockout of Juan LaPorte on July 24 to retain the World Boxing Organization junior-welterweight title , Padilla was sparring with Mosley , who will fight at the Grand Olympic Auditorium next Friday . After five rounds at their usual , fast pace , Mosley noticed that Padilla looked woozy . &quot; When I spar with him , he ' s usually attacking me the whole time , &quot; Mosley said . &quot; And when I came_out for the sixth round , I feinted at him , and instead of doing what he usually does , rock back and throw punches , he kind of flinched and wobbled . I thought , ' Wait a minute , that ' s not Zack. ' &quot; He just kind of looked_at me , was about to continue , thought_about it and said , ' Naw , I ' m not feeling good . I feel kind of dizzy. ' And we just stopped right there. &quot; The 31-year-old Padilla went_to a hospital , where a blood_clot was discovered near his brain . Although his life is apparently not in jeopardy , he has told friends he probably will retire from boxing . Even if he doesn ' t retire , state boxing officials have said they would be unlikely to allow him to fight again . Padilla has a 22-1-1 record , which is not very many fights , but has taken more shots per bout than most boxers . In one computer-tallied fight , Padilla and Ray Oliviera threw a combined 3 # 024 punches_in 12 rounds , a PunchStat record . The LaPorte fight was brutal , with both men landing heavy blows every round . LaPorte lost when he couldn ' t answer the bell for the 11th round . &quot; I don ' t think it was from the sparring , just from the fights he ' s had , &quot; Mosley said . &quot; The accumulation of fights . Especially the one with Juan LaPorte . He ' s just had a lot of tough fights and I guess he has to give his body time to heal. &quot; Said former world bantamweight champion Richie Sandoval , a close friend of Padilla ' s : &quot; It could be a sign that says , ' Hey , you gave it a good run , it ' s time to move on. ' &quot; Some fighters never seem to understand . They go_on and go_on and go_on and wait for a tragedy to happen. &quot; * Although saddened by the development , most were not surprised or particularly alarmed . They know boxing is violent , that the object is to avoid getting hit as well as_to hit one ' s opponent . &quot; Zack Padilla was known to fight brutal fights , &quot; said Ignacio Beristein , trainer of Humberto ( Chiquita ) Gonzalez and many others . &quot; He would take a lot of punishment and he would always go_in there using force and without technique . He would go_in there and fight -- land punches and receive punches . &quot; Maybe he ' s paying the consequences right now because he ' s had too many wars , like with ( Carlos ) Bolillo Gonzalez ( to win the WBO title ) and some_other fighters who really put some hands on him . &quot; Maybe his trainers or his manager , what they should have done was teach him , instead of always using force , to try some_other technique that would allow him to avoid getting hit as much as he was. &quot; Genaro Hernandez , World Boxing Assn . junior-lightweight champion , agreed . &quot; In every fight , he gets hit a lot . He doesn ' t make any body movement or stuff like that , &quot; Hernandez said . &quot; It ' s obvious it ' s going_to catch_up to you sooner or later . Eventually , it caught_up to him. &quot; Does Hernandez believe aggressive , daily sparring sessions are harmful ? &quot; We try just to go and work_out , not to go_in there and make_it a war zone , &quot; Hernandez said . &quot; This is a school to us . . . we ' re there just to learn . &quot; The people that come and work_out with me , if they come_out and try to hurt me , I lay a_couple_of shots in there . That way I can show them , ' Hey , I ' m not going_to take anything from you. ' &quot; But after we work_out , I tell them , look , we ' re here to work_out , not to kill each other . You try to kill each other up in the real ring , when you ' re going to make some money . You ' re not getting paid here , so take it easy. &quot; The irony , according to Mosley , is that Padilla was trying to change his style in preparation for an eventual bout with Whitaker . He was attempting to learn how to play defense . &quot; He was getting ready to fight Sweet_Pea , and he was practicing different things , keeping his hands up higher than he used to , and I think he was getting his mind set for that , &quot; Mosley said . &quot; that ' s really why he came_to the gym earlier than usual ( after the LaPorte fight ) , to work_on that. &quot; Boxing Notes Although one executive at Top Rank , Inc. , has said that Oscar De La Hoya vs . Paul Gonzales would be an exciting fight to promote , Top Rank President Bob Arum isn ' t thrilled by the prospect . &quot; It would n ' t be a good fight , &quot; Arum said . &quot; I ' m not taking it seriously at all . I think it ' s all bull. &quot; De La Hoya , angered by the recent harsh words directed at him by Gonzales , who preceded De La Hoya as an East Los Angeles-born Olympic gold medalist , directed trainer Robert Alcazar to see if Gonzales was serious about fighting him . More_than a fight , sources close to De La Hoya said , he thinks he deserves an apology from Gonzales , who is nine years older , recently retired , and was at his best at 112 pounds . De La Hoya is fighting in the 135-pound division . &quot; This is just a personal thing , &quot; a source said . &quot; These two guys used to be friends . They should talk and get past this. &quot; De La Hoya is scheduled to fight on Oct . 8 at the Grand Olympic Auditorium against an opponent to be decided upon -- it definitely won ' t be Gonzalez , Arum said , because he knows CBS matchmaker Gil Clancy would reject that fight -- and possibly again on Nov . 18 on the Roy Jones-James Toney undercard . Neither bout , as of now , is scheduled to be for De La Hoya ' s World Boxing Organization lightweight title . An interested bystander is Genaro Hernandez , a champion in his prime who has been seeking to fight De La Hoya for more_than a year . &quot; That fight would be a disgrace to boxing because in reality Paul Gonzales , he ' s a flyweight , &quot; Hernandez said . &quot; He ' s a friend of mine . I would hate to see him get_up in the ring and get hurt . ( Top Rank executive Dan ) Goossen came_out and said it would be a terrific fight . It will not be a good fight , everybody knows that . Paul Gonzales , his time is through. &quot; Two of L.A. ' s most talented young featherweights , 22-year-old Arnulfo ( Chico ) Castillo and Robert Garcia , 19 , kept their records perfect last week and are heading for an eventual showdown . Garcia ( 15-0 , 12 knockouts ) defeated veteran Frankie Avelar last Saturday at the Olympic in two rounds , then was_on hand for Castillo ' s fifth-round technical_knockout over Francisco Valdez Monday at the Forum . Castillo is 14-0 with nine knockouts . Garcia ' s next fight will be_on Sept . 24 at the Olympic . . . . Also on that card will be junior-lightweight Pepe Reilly , who showed_off his new overhand right in his last bout at the Olympic . &quot; Yeah , it ' s kind of my secret weapon , &quot; said Reilly , who has always been known for his left hook . &quot; I never used it much , but now I ' m using it in combination with my left hook to the body . If one doesn ' t get there , the other will. &quot; Calendar Wednesday : Rafael ( Bazooka ) Limon vs . John Armijo , junior-welterweights ; Huntington Park Casino , 7:30 p.m. Friday : Danny Romero vs . Manuel Jesus Herrera , flyweights ; Shane Mosley vs . Louis Ramirez , lightweights ; Grand Olympic Auditorium , 5:30 p.m .</TEXT>
