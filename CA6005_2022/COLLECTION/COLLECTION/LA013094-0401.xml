   <HEADLINE> STATE NEAR BOTTOM OF BARREL OF WINE GRAPE SCANDAL ; FRAUD : WINERIES THAT UNWITTINGLY BOUGHT OVERPRICED GRAPES SIMPLY USED THEM TO MAKE OVERPRICED WINE . NEW SAFEGUARDS ARE NOW IN PLACE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nobody was killed , unlike in the great Italian wine scandal of 1986 , when vintners used methanol to boost sugar levels and sent two_dozen wine drinkers to early graves . Now that was serious . But by California ' s priggish wine standards , the scandal that is drawing to a close here in Federal_Court -- a series of sneaky crimes whereby cheap , characterless grapes were passed_off as pricey zinfandel , chardonnay or cabernet -- was the biggest in modern times . Consumers paid some $ 55 million for wine that was not as advertised , five men went_to jail and the president of the nation ' s fifth-largest winery has just pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy in the largest and most complex of five criminal cases arising from the schemes . The cases showed a raw side of what is described as a generally friendly , handshake-based industry -- the bargain-basement part of the wine world where a_few bottom fishers care less about what is in the bottle than how much shelf space they get_in the supermarket . Very few people were directly damaged by the fraud , and even the murder of a witness in one of the cases turned_out to be unrelated . And while a handful of wine outlaws collected millions of dollars they weren ' t entitled to , the wineries that unwittingly bought the overpriced grapes simply used them to make overpriced wine . That left the consumer holding the bottles -- in most cases a $ 5 bottle of bogus white zinfandel , a sweet pink_wine much derided by connoisseurs . But in wine circles they say that &quot; white zin &quot; would taste the same whether it was made with zinfandel grapes or , say , barbera , a kind of grape blended with others to make generic jug_wines . Still , the very integrity of California ' s $ 20-billion wine industry was at stake . &quot; Some people snicker at these cases , &quot; says one federal investigator , accustomed to arresting gun-runners , drug_traffickers and other hard-core sorts . &quot; But you ' ve got_to have standards in any industry. &quot; The criminal investigation that began in 1988 is now complete , and authorities , growers and vintners say that it triggered new industry-funded safeguards that have all but halted the practice of misrepresenting grapes and wine . But the_matter has not quite been put to rest . Still to be decided is the penalty to be handed_down against the man whom the government portrays as the chief figure in the biggest and most sophisticated of four criminal ventures unmasked in the scandal : Fred T . Franzia , co-founder and president of Bronco Wine Co. , the nation ' s fifth largest winery . Franzia ' s indictment by a federal grand_jury in Sacramento in December marked the end -- and arguably the high point -- of the five-year investigation of fraud in California ' s wine industry . ( Fred Franzia and Bronco are unaffiliated with Franzia Brothers Winery in Ripon , Calif. , which sells Franzia-label wines . Bronco , its name is derived from &quot; brothers and cousin , &quot; is owned by Fred Franzia , his brother , Joseph , and their cousin , John Jr. ) . Franzia , 50 , a nephew of industry statesman Ernest Gallo , is a director and former chairman of the influential Wine Institute -- trade association representing 80 % of the wine produced in California -- and a highly successful businessman who built Bronco Wine from scratch . Franzia declined to be interviewed . He has a reputation as a bull in the wine shoppe -- widely described by acquaintances as smart but boastful , arrogant and brash , ready to intimidate employees , squeeze growers and fight battles in court . By all accounts he runs the company single-handedly . &quot; Employees and others with whom Franzia deals are afraid of him , &quot; says Assistant U.S. Attorney R . Steven Lapham , who prosecuted all_the wine cases . &quot; I ' m not sure what it is , if it ' s his manner or the economic power he holds. &quot; Bronco ' s license was suspended briefly by state agriculture officials in 1985 , a rare action , after complaints by an unprecedented number of growers . The company was found to have repeatedly used improper tactics to lower the prices it paid growers for their grapes , typically by refusing to take deliveries until the grape quality had deteriorated . In the words of one hearing_officer , Bronco ' s actions were &quot; reprehensible. &quot; Now Franzia has struck a deal with federal prosecutors to avoid a prison_term in favor of a $ 3-million fine -- much of which , the government admits , is payable from ill-gotten gains . If this plea bargain is accepted by the judge , Franzia will be the only one of six defendants identified as major conspirators in the series of wine frauds to avoid incarceration . Franzia pleaded guilty Jan . 19 in Sacramento federal_court under an agreement that reduces his role at Bronco to chief financial_officer for five years , requires 500 hours of community service and imposes fines of $ 500 # 000 and $ 2.5 million on him and his company . &quot; He ' s bought his way_out , &quot; says Jack L . Hart , a longtime wine industry lender as a Fresno-based Bank of America vice_president . &quot; that ' s what is so upsetting , &quot; By contrast , a former client of Hart ' s , 72-year-old Madera winemaker Angelo Papagni , is serving an 18-month term in federal prison for a lesser scheme than Franzia ' s . Hart and others are trying to get Papagni released early . &quot; It ' s not equitable , &quot; concedes prosecutor Lapham . Lapham said he recommended the plea agreement because he believed that Bronco , a major employer in the small_town of Ceres near Modesto , might not survive without Franzia -- a judgment strongly denied by Bronco itself . Moreover , he said , the plea bargain avoids a difficult and expensive trial . U.S. District Judge William B . Shubb in Sacramento will decide whether to accept the terms of the plea bargain . Sentencing is set for March . Whatever the merits of Franzia ' s proposed penalty , it is touted as the biggest fine ever levied in the Eastern District of California , which extends from Bakersfield to Oregon and Nevada to the Bay Area . And his case culminates the state ' s worst wine scandal -- not that there is a lengthy list to compare with . The last such known deception occurred in 1974 , when Almaden Vineyards mislabeled 28 # 000 gallons of wine in the little screw-top bottles served by airlines . The company paid a $ 250 # 000 fine , at the time the heaviest ever imposed by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms . Even then , the Almaden case was dwarfed by a French scandal in which 2 million cases of cheap red_wine were passed_off as the most expensive Bordeaux . The more recent California disgrace was set_in_motion by severe 1987-88 shortages of certain grapes -- especially zinfandel , cabernet and chardonnay -- when the industry was caught unprepared by the soaring popularity of a new category of medium-priced varietal wines . Varietals are those at least 75 % composed of the grape cited on the label , and include such wines as cabernet_sauvignon , zinfandel , sauvignon_blanc and chardonnay . Generic wines -- typified by California burgundy and chablis or those simply labeled as table_wines , often sold in big jugs -- are blends of many types and are said to have no &quot; character. &quot; In heaviest demand -- and the focus of most of the fraud -- was white zin , a newly conceived product whose flavor resembles sweet rose wines but has the hallowed &quot; zinfandel &quot; name on the label . It and similar pink &quot; blush &quot; wines have been called &quot; Yuppie Kool-aid. &quot; Though absent altogether from the wine snob ' s list , the combination of the red zinfandel grape with cheaper , generic white fruits came_to mean big bucks for many well-known California wineries . It brings_in cash quickly because it needs little or no aging . But the shortages vaulted zinfandel prices to $ 800 to $ 1 # 200 a ton , while other types of red grapes used in generic jug_wines -- valdepena , Grenache , Ruby Cabernet , carnelian and others -- were in plentiful supply and could be had for $ 100 to $ 200 . With falsification of documents and a_few other wrinkles , a grower or broker could collect $ 15 # 000 to $ 25 # 000 for a gondola full of supposed zinfandel grapes that were actually valdepenas worth $ 5 # 000 . The scams were facilitated by lax controls at some wineries -- apparently not a problem at the better wineries in Napa , Sonoma and other regions -- and the difficulty of conclusively identifying some grape types . &quot; It became a real temptation , &quot; says Mark Urban , a deputy state_attorney general who filed 17 civil complaints -- all settled out of court with the payment of fines -- arising from the joint state-federal investigation . &quot; A lot of growers got a little bit greedy , a_few people got a lot greedy , truckers started looking the other way , and it just got completely out of hand. &quot; Rumors swept the industry during the 1987 harvest , and numerous growers and vintners tipped_off state and federal authorities . As the next harvest began , dozens of vineyards were put_under surveillance by investigators from the California Department of Food and Agriculture and the ATF . Using public records to identify the types of grapes grown in the vineyards , agents watched as grapes were loaded into trucks , then followed the trucks to wineries . They then checked winery records and determined that the delivered grapes had been misrepresented . At Bronco , more_than 15 % of the &quot; zinfandel &quot; and about half the &quot; cabernet &quot; crushed by the winery in 1987 was actually something else , said another federal investigator who asked not to be identified . For Bronco -- which mainly sells non-varietal wine in bulk to companies that sell it under their own labels , some as wine_coolers -- this represented only about 3 % of the winery ' s overall tonnage that year . But because of the inflated prices , the misrepresented grapes accounted_for a considerably higher proportion of Bronco ' s revenues , investigators said . And because of the shortages , the fraud enabled Bronco to fill orders that law-abiding winemakers couldn ' t . According to the indictment , Franzia would sometimes order that zinfandel leaves , distinctive in their shape , be sprinkled on truckloads of cheaper grapes as part of the subterfuge . He called this the &quot; blessing of the loads , &quot; court papers show . He would order that field identification tags be altered or destroyed , the indictment said . And to launder revenues that would n ' t withstand the glare of investigation , he allegedly enlisted an unwitting , well-known wine broker -- later a grand_jury witness -- to whom he owed money . On three occasions , he wrote checks to the broker totaling $ 2.9 million , supposedly as payment for expensive grapes , according to the indictment . The broker then would write slightly smaller checks to one of a series of partnerships controlled by Franzia . The broker would keep the difference as payment of bills for previous , legitimate services . Bronco treasurer Daniel J . Leonard also declined to discuss the case , noting that this is a &quot; ticklish period &quot; with sentencing yet to come . He produced a letter from the winery to its customers and growers in which Franzia said : &quot; I accept responsibility for what happened six years ago. &quot; The letter also said Bronco cooperated fully and had &quot; voluntarily &quot; turned_over 100 # 000 pages of records . But prosecutor Lapham said , &quot; If you call cooperation responding to grand_jury subpoenas and court_orders , Bronco cooperated . If you ' re talking_about voluntarily coming_forward , they didn ' t cooperate , in my view. &quot; Conspicuous by its absence from any brush with the scandal was E &amp; J Gallo Winery in Modesto , the biggest vintner of all , where security and quality_controls are legendary and winemakers literally stand_guard at the gate as trucks roll in during the harvest . But the irregularities by Franzia , a nephew of co-founder Ernest Gallo ' s late wife , didn ' t appear to affect his standing in the family . Asked to comment , Ernest , 85 , said through a spokesman : &quot; I have a high regard for Fred Franzia. &quot; And as chief financial_officer at Bronco , he remains &quot; a director in good standing &quot; at the Wine Institute , says President John DeLuca . &quot; There hasn ' t even been one person who ' s raised a question about it. &quot; Times Staff Writer Dan Berger contributed to this story .</TEXT>
