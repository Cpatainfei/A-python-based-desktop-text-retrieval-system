   <HEADLINE> SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY ; SANTA CLARITA BACKS MILDER ORDINANCE AGAINST SMOKING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A filtered version of a tobacco control ordinance here bans smoking in most workplaces , prohibits cigarette vending_machines and is set to take_effect Aug . 1 . The Santa Clarita City_Council voted 5 to Tuesday night to approve first_reading of the ordinance with lesser restrictions than when it was adopted five months ago . Smoking is banned in enclosed workplaces but permitted in restaurants and bars as long as the establishment ' s policy is posted for customers . Cigarette vending_machines are prohibited citywide . Small businesses operated away from the public and not sharing ventilation_systems with another office may allow smoking . Council_members have been flooded with data and arguments from advocates on both sides since the issue was raised in late 1993 . Ban supporters say people ' s health is at stake , while opponents say it ' s a question of personal freedom and that merchants should be able to set their own smoking policies . The decision Tuesday was a compromise . Mayor George Pederson earlier opposed the ordinance , saying it didn ' t go_far enough to protect residents from secondhand smoke . Councilwoman Jan Heidt was against it for a different reason , saying businesses should be allowed to regulate themselves . The council approved first_reading of a stricter version in December but backed_off of final approval when 200 people -- some residents , some merchants and many from outside of the Santa Clarita Valley wanting to express their views on smoking -- showed_up to debate the issue . The earlier draft banned smoking in all enclosed public areas , except bars with only one-fourth of their income from food sales . Not everyone was happy with the compromise , including resident Donna Pugh , who first asked_for smoking controls in the workplace . She believed that eating establishments should be treated the same as other job sites . &quot; I still don ' t believe restaurants aren ' t a workplace , &quot; Pugh told the council . &quot; No one will convince me of this. &quot; The ban will appear for a second_reading by the council June 14 and , barring another last-minute change by the council , would go_into effect Aug . 1 .</TEXT>
