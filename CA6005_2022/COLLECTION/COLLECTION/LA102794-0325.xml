   <HEADLINE> HEALTH EFFECTS OF SARGENT-FLETCHER PLANT ARE HARD TO DISCERN ; CHROME-PLATING FACTORY REPORTED TOXIC EMISSIONS AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN THE AREA . BUT THE COMPANY DISPUTES THE DATA , CITING SMOG AS A MORE PROBABLE REASON FOR NEIGHBOR ' S BREATHING AILMENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Look_at the neighborhood surrounding Sargent-Fletcher and you are looking_at the complexities of sorting_out the relationship between health risks and pollution . The El Monte chrome-plating plant , which turns_out aerospace parts , showed the highest cancer-risk level of any business in the San Gabriel Valley , according to a 1991 report the company submitted to regional air quality officials . Company officials now say the finding resulted from an outdated and erroneous report and that they have cut production of the aerospace parts that it makes , reducing the amount of chromium being emitted . But neighbors still wonder if their coughs and wheezing might be linked to chromium or other toxic air_pollution from the plant . The uncertainty surrounding the issue is as thick as the gray-brown haze that often obscures El Monte ' s skyline on a sunny day . Backed up against the San Bernardino ( 10 ) Freeway , the neighborhood surrounding the plant is rife_with smog and auto emissions , which Sargent-Fletcher officials maintain are far more likely to cause breathing problems than their company ' s emissions . Figuring_out what , if any , health_problems are cause by the factory emissions , or from the the smog and exhaust -- or from just plain coincidental illnesses that would have cropped_up even without pollutants -- is no easy task . Air quality experts acknowledge that breathing more_than one type of pollutant can add_to , or even multiply , the health risks . And neighbors fear the cornucopia of chemicals in their air is more_than their lungs can handle . &quot; The smog plus the chromium from this company will injure us doubly , &quot; said Aniano Vicente , a former surgeon at Monrovia Community Hospital , who resigned this year after he was hospitalized with asthma , pneumonia and bronchitis . Several nearby neighbors complain of chronic respiratory ailments . A report the company submitted to the AQMD in 1991 estimated that the factory ' s emissions may increase the cancer rate in surrounding areas by 120 cases per million people . The company maintains that mistakes in its original report exaggerated the amount of chromium the plant releases . &quot; The emission factors used to calculate hexavalent chromium in the 1991 health-risk assessment do not represent actual processes at Sargent-Fletcher Co. , &quot; said Ed Hilbert , the plant ' s environmental consultant . &quot; These factors were based on incorrect estimates by a contractor who completed the report . . . . The company is in the process of preparing a revised health-risk assessment based on a more realistic emission factor. &quot; The earlier contractor estimated the emissions from the plant ' s manufacturing process to be 10 # 000 times higher than those of other facilities that use the exact same process , Hilbert said . In addition , he said , aerospace cutbacks have meant downsizing at the plant since the report was submitted ; therefore , it uses , and releases , less chromium . He adds that the emissions levels are based on a theoretical model and would probably be lower if they were actually measured . When scientists at the state agency reviewed the original report , they found that the risk was in fact lower -- but not by much . Their review showed that Sargent-Fletcher poses a cancer risk of 85 in a_million , said research scientist Judy Rosenbaum . In addition , its acute hazard level -- the index used to measure health effects other_than cancer -- is 3.3. An acute hazard level of 1.0 requires a company to notify neighbors . A level of 5.0 forces them to reduce emissions . And a profile of chromium by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services links exposure to the chemical among workers to respiratory ailments such_as nasal irritation , perforated or ulcerated septums , labored breathing , coughs and wheezing . Dr. Melanie Marty of the state Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment , which reviews the health risk assessments companies such_as Sargent-Fletcher have submitted to the AQMD , said that chromium is more likely to cause cancer than respiratory problems -- a chilling reassurance to residents . Hilbert suggested that the health hazards of smog and car pollution are probably greater than the danger of emissions from Sargent-Fletcher . &quot; When I drive through the San Gabriel Valley , I have trouble breathing , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
