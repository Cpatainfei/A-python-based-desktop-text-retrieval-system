   <HEADLINE> ACCESS TO PROBLEM-BROKER DATABASE IS PUSHED ; SECURITIES : STATE REGULATORS SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL AND WILL FORMALLY SUBMIT IT AT A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Investors should be allowed to use their home computers to troll through the securities industry ' s disciplinary records on problem brokers and firms , a group of state regulators says . Consumer activists on Tuesday hailed the idea , proposed by the National Assn . of State Securities Administrators , as a major boost for consumers seeking to get a fair shake in the securities markets . John R . Perkins , state securities regulator for Missouri , plans to formally make the proposal today at a congressional hearing on problem brokers . Associated Press obtained an advance copy of Perkins ' testimony . &quot; Direct and uncensored public access to CRD disciplinary files would mean speedier access to critical information for investors and also would dramatically turn_up the heat on problem brokers , &quot; said Perkins , who heads a task_force on weeding_out problem brokers . The CRD , or Central Registration Depository , is a vast database containing all enforcement records against the nation ' s 460 # 000 registered brokers and traders , as well as 5 # 500 securities firms . The records , some dating to the early 1950s , provide details of specific securities law violations , arbitration settlements , fines and lawsuits . The CRD is run_by the National Assn . of Securities Dealers , the industry ' s main self-regulatory body . The nation ' s stock and commodities_exchanges , as well as state regulators , contribute to the system . The public has only limited access to the records , via a toll-free phone_number run_by the NASD . The NASD is in the midst of a $ 12-million upgrade of the database that would enable regulators to perform sophisticated surveillance and analysis of the records , which currently are in an outdated format that limits searching . Perkins said state regulators envision a day in which investors could use computers in their homes or in public_libraries to download both the corporate filings and the disciplinary files to check on a firm or a broker ' s reputation . Although experts agree that the CRD suffers from outdated technology , the database remains a powerful research tool . Perkins is proposing that the CRD files be made available on the global Internet computer_network , in much the same way as the SEC ' s electronic corporate records .</TEXT>
