   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON IRAQ ; BART SIMPSON OF GULF ACTS_UP AGAIN ; SADDAM IS A MONSTER OF OUR OWN MAKING ; WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER OUR INTERESTS ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO GO IT ALONE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Once again the Iraqi chicken has come_home to roost on an American President ' s lap . There is a reason for this . Saddam Hussein is more_than a neighborhood bully . He is our Bart Simpson : the clever little fellow who periodically embarrasses and outsmarts us , but whom we cannot totally disavow because he is partly our creation and useful to us . Ronald Reagan fed weapons and intelligence information to Saddam during the Iran-Iraq War to prevent Tehran from winning . He did this even though Saddam had started the war with an aggression no less blatant than that against Kuwait in 1990 . The difference was that , given the choice , we preferred the atheistic to the religious butcher , the general to the ayatollah . The original problem was , of course , of_our_own making . In the 1970s , Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger poured weapons into Iran to build it up as the linchpin of our interestsin the Middle_East . The shah was to be our deputy_sheriff or our &quot; regional surrogate. &quot; This is why they looked the other way when the shah , needing to pay_for his expensive new military toys , set_off a dizzying price spiral that drove_up the price of oil from a_few dollars a barrel to more_than $ 40 and set_off a round of inflation throughout the industrialized world . It was worth it , they thought , if the shah would keep the lid on a volatile area . It seems never to have occurred to them that the shah might be overthrown and replaced by someone less obliging . When that happened , Washington shifted its affections from Tehran to Baghdad . Several years later , Saddam repaid us by invading Kuwait . This was not the scenario we had anticipated . He was supposed to direct his armies east , toward the fist-shaking Iranians , not south , toward the Kuwaitis , who just wanted to have fun . Why did Saddam do_it ? Because he thought that the Americans would let him . Indeed , the signals he got from the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad , and even from George_Bush , led him to believe that we would wink if he slapped down the greedy Kuwaitis and worked_out a compromise . However , when he grabbed for the whole_thing , he called into question the U.S. guarantee to neighboring Saudi_Arabia and had to be stopped . Pushing his army back across the border cost billions of dollars -- most of which we persuaded others to pay . Yet something funny happened . Rather than destroying Saddam ' s army so that it could not come_back to Kuwait another day , or putting him in a maximum security cell , we deliberately let them both escape . This strategy -- mapped_out by Bush , together with Defense_Secretary Dick Cheney , Secretary_of_State James A . Baker III and Joint Chiefs Chairman Colin Powell -- was ostensibly designed to prevent the creation of a &quot; power vacuum &quot; in the area . They wanted to give Saddam a bloody nose so that he would leave Kuwait , but keep him strong enough to &quot; balance off &quot; the menacing mullahs in Tehran . Saddam Hussein knows that he can manipulate U.S. officials because they think that they need him . His army is intact not because we were softhearted , but because we wanted it to be used for other purposes . But Saddam has his own agenda : getting the economic sanctions lifted . Kuwait is America ' s Achilles ' heel . All Saddam has to do is to shift his troops around and the United States sends an army across the world to protect the Kuwaitis . Why ? Because we fear that if Saddam grabs Kuwait and scares the Saudis he will try to raise the price of oil . It is unlikely that he would be able to do so , given abundant alternate sources . Further , the price of oil is now cheaper , inflation-adjusted , than it was 20 years ago when the first price hikes began . One can also ask how &quot; cheap &quot; Kuwaiti and Saudi oil is if it requires billions of dollars to protect weak and indolent regimes . In Kuwait , U.S. policy-makers face a real dilemma . They are trying to protect a weak colony against a strong neighbor that they want to discipline but not seriously weaken . Saddam is bad , but the ayatollahs are worse . Logic would dictate that the United States ally itself with one of the major_powers of the region to lessen the burden . Instead , we have taken_on both in_order to keep the oil kingdoms afloat . The result is that we are being diddled by Saddam Hussein , who can siphon_off billions of our dollars every time he shifts his troops around . There are three ways_out of this self-imposed conundrum . One , if the oil-guzzling states of the industrialized world care about &quot; cheap &quot; Kuwaiti oil , let them pay the United States to do the dirty work , as they did_in the Gulf War . Two , if our partner-competitors won ' t pay their share , and if we really believe that Iranian-style fundamentalism is a menace to the world , we should work_out a deal with Saddam over Kuwait and let him &quot; police &quot; the Persian_Gulf for us . Three , if that smells too_bad , we could balance off power against power : work_out an accommodation with Tehran so that Saddam will have to worry too_much about his eastern frontier to play games in the south . Bill_Clinton inherited a mess from his predecessors and he had little alternative , in the short run , than to make the response he did . But now he will have to go beyond a bankrupt policy of superpower policing of tinderboxes and disasters , whether in Kuwait , Korea or Haiti , and make a cool assessment of the interests of a nation that is very strong , but not rich enough to run a global fire_brigade .</TEXT>
