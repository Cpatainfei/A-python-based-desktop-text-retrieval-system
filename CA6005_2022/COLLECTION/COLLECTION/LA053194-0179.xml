   <HEADLINE> D-DAY INVASION / JUNE 6 , 1944 ; THE INVASION OF NORMANDY ; THE LEGACY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> News of the D-day landings traveled far and fast . In the United States , newspaper extras carried banner headlines of the Allied assault on the Normandy beaches of northern France . In Nazi-occupied Europe the accounts spread by short-wave radio from Britain . One week shy of her 15th birthday , an excited Jewish girl in Amsterdam named Anne Frank described in the June 6 , 1944 , entry to her diary how she and her family huddled around a radio in their attic hideaway to hear details of the invasion . &quot; This is the day , &quot; she wrote . &quot; . . . I have the feeling friends are approaching. &quot; While it was quickly understood that D-day would alter the course of World_War_II irrevocably in the Allies ' favor , not even the most farsighted visionaries were in a position to grasp the event ' s lasting significance : That the 70 # 000 Americans who set foot in Northern_Europe on that gray , stormy June day were the vanguard of a U.S. presence that would not just help win the war , but remain to preside over a half-century of peace . For the United States , D-day was part of a watershed . For Europe it was more . For better or worse , the Normandy invasion was one of a series of events that propelled America past the point_of_no_return on_the_road toward a permanent global role , a permanent European presence and its first peacetime alliance . Psychologically and politically , the U.S. casualties taken that day and during the subsequent 11 months of fighting until Nazi Germany ' s surrender gave America little option but to push_aside instinct , reject a return to isolationism and instead stay_on to help preserve the peace in Europe . In the years since , about 16 million American service personnel and their dependents have served in Europe . Only the collapse of communism , a deepening budgetary crisis and a string of pressing domestic problems have led Washington to begin unwinding its presence in the region . From a peak of 325 # 000 in 1989 , U.S. troop strength in Europe now stands at about 150 # 000 . It is scheduled to fall to 109 # 000 by the end of 1996 . The troop withdrawal reflects a larger shift in America ' s national priorities -- those now embodied in Bill_Clinton , a young President with no personal_memories of Europe ' s disastrous war and committed far more to tackling long-neglected domestic ills than strengthening U.S. influence abroad . As a result , more question_marks hang over the future of the transatlantic relationship than at any time since the Iron_Curtain fell across Europe . For Europeans , adrift on a sea of frightening new problems and searching to redefine themselves and their role in a post-Cold War world , this ebbing American interest is disturbing . After all , they owe a lot to their transatlantic partner . It was , for example , the American military and economic support in the early postwar years that halted the Soviet_Union ' s westward advance , steadied governments vulnerable to Communist takeover in France , Italy and Greece and kept West_Berlin alive_with a 15-month airlift . As Soviet Cold_War bullying intensified , it was a U.S. president , John F . Kennedy , who traveled_to Germany , reminded Moscow that the defense of America began in Berlin , then declared himself a citizen of the beleaguered city with his famous declaration , &quot; Ich bin ein Berliner. &quot; It was U.S. pressure that helped pave the way for Germany ' s swift rehabilitation into the community of Western democracies and American money that flowed into an exhausted Western Europe under the Marshall Plan , restoring hope and igniting an unprecedented economic recovery . And it was leaders such_as Dean Acheson , Dwight D . Eisenhower and John Foster Dulles , who repeatedly gave crucial support to the_French visionary Jean Monnet as he worked to overcome regional jealousies to build a European Common_Market . &quot; We ' ve all buried the amazing importance of America in process of European integration , &quot; said William Wallace , a senior research fellow at Oxford_University ' s St . Antony ' s College . &quot; The whole_thing was American-driven. &quot; Added Pierre Jacquet , deputy director of the_French Institute of International Relations , &quot; Without it ( the American presence ) , Europe would have fallen_back again into the 1930s , with nations trying to export their problems to each other. &quot; Instead , the Common_Market ' s successor -- the European Union -- stands at the center of the Continent ' s future . It is about to enlarge from 12 to 16 member states and -- albeit hesitantly -- has reached_out to the former Soviet satellite states in the east . EU member nations still squabble with each other , but war between them is only a slightly less remote possibility than armed conflict between California and Nevada . Amid this transatlantic success , there have been bitter differences -- many of them stemming from frictions inherent in a relationship between peoples who share the same values but in vastly different worlds . American policy-makers , especially in the 1970s and 1980s , frequently complained of limp , pessimistic European allies , too paralyzed by their own self-doubts to be effective partners . Presidents Lyndon B . Johnson and Richard Nixon all but ignored Western Europe as the United States pursued a war in Asia , detente with Moscow and an opening of ties with Communist_China . The Vietnam_War debacle , coupled with Western Europe ' s growing economic strength , the student revolutions that swept the region in 1968 and the dollar crises of the early 1970s , ended the European sense of awe for America that characterized much of the relationship ' s early years . Some sharp foreign_policy clashes during the Jimmy_Carter and Ronald Reagan presidencies and a love-hate relationship with the growing American cultural invasion led many Europeans to nurture a new stereotype of the United States -- that of a powerful , but naive ally , whose quick-trigger , overly simplistic world_view constituted a danger only slightly less than that emanating from Moscow . But few on either side of the Atlantic could challenge the reality that Western Europe ' s stunning revival had unfolded and matured under the protection of America ' s security guarantees . Indeed , many argue that both a long-term American political role and military presence in Europe remain vital for the Continent ' s stability . Anyone watching the EU ' s futile efforts to prevent conflicts on its own within the region would be hard-pressed not to agree . The war in the former Yugoslav federation , the first major political crisis postwar Europeans have had to face without immediate American leadership , has been both a diplomatic disaster and a demoralizing blow to the EU ' s self-confidence -- in addition to a great human tragedy . &quot; Our biggest problem is that for the last 50 years , America has told us what to do , &quot; said Wallace , the Oxford fellow . &quot; We may_not have liked it , but it always gave us a starting point . Now this is gone. &quot; Added Stanley Crossick , chairman of the Belmont European Policy Center , a Brussels-based political think_tank : &quot; We got things right after the war because of strong U.S. leadership , the brilliance of the Marshall Plan and the vision of_our_own statesmen . Now we no longer have the same U.S. leadership , our own leaders are weak and there ' s no Marshall Plan. &quot; But there remain many elements that will keep America and Europe locked together . Despite the new importance of Japan and other Asian markets , Western Europe remains America ' s biggest overseas trading partner . Since 1945 , the Old_World has drawn an estimated $ 200 billion in U.S. private investment -- roughly 40 cents of every American dollar invested overseas . The $ 195 billion in EU-U.S. trade last year accounted_for more_than one quarter of all global exports . Such figures help support the claim that America ' s decision to defend Western Europe was no act of altruism , but far more a policy based on enlightened self-interest that has paid_off . A number of other imperatives would also seem to guarantee a continued strong transatlantic link . Common problems , including immigration , the preservation of democratic values and free markets , growing challenges from Asia and the emerging economies in the South remain common_ground for both . After fighting bitterly against each other through seven years of global trade talks , Europeans quickly teamed with Americans early this year to force the issues of child labor and worker exploitation onto the agenda of the newly formed World Trade Organization . &quot; The European Union and the United States have the most important interdependent relationship in the world , &quot; concluded EU Commissioner Christiane Scrivener in a speech last month . Although dazzled by the potential of fast-growing markets in the Far East , American policy-makers have found it hard to penetrate the Asian mind-set , let alone the markets themselves . In trying to cultivate Asian markets , the Clinton_Administration has already stumbled into open conflicts with several nations , including Japan , China , Malaysia and Singapore . Meanwhile , a powerful transatlantic cultural bond has emerged , that , despite European ambivalence , continues to grow . From the GI chewing gum , jazz music and Ernest Hemingway paperbacks in the late 1940s , to the Levi ' s , NFL sweat shirts , Pizza Hut restaurants , hard-rock music , Hollywood films and TV game_shows found virtually everywhere in Western Europe , American soft power has steamrollered the Continent . It is a truth that makes many Europeans wince , but 3 1 / 2 decades after the Treaty of Rome committed them to the path of integration , the common thread through Western European mass_culture is American . &quot; At the mass level , it has contributed to a cultural homogenization across Europe , &quot; declared Philipp Borinski , part of an academic team at Mainz University that is studying the future of the transatlantic relationship . American pop_music , scientific writings and successful business styles helped catapult English into the role of a de_facto international language , adding further to this cultural impact . Widespread knowledge of English has made Northern_Europe especially vulnerable to American influence and , although the Romanesque countries to the south have resisted this trend , they too have succumbed , at least in part . &quot; These countries are more influenced than they like to admit , &quot; noted Wilfried Wiegand , who edits the cultural pages of Germany ' s leading national daily , the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung . &quot; In Italy it ' s now fashionable for young people to eat hamburgers and learn English . In a country that values form and elegance , this is a way for young people to show they are different. &quot; In Germany , American ideas flooded into a cultural vacuum left in the wake of Nazism . Probably nowhere else in Europe have American habits and tastes -- from jazz clubs to corporate boardrooms -- taken greater hold . While the reaction to the Vietnam_War and the 1968 student protests both carried a distinctly anti-American character and worked to tarnish America ' s image as a political role_model , they paradoxically strengthened the American cultural impact . With few home-grown symbols to challenge the Establishment , Western Europe ' s young revolutionaries listened to the protest messages of Joan Baez and Bob Dylan , cultivated Andy Warhol ' s art and adopted Eldridge Cleaver and Angela Davis as political heroes . &quot; It was a lifestyle revolution in the direction of America , &quot; said Borinski , who views 1968 as a clear break from traditional West European mores , one that has brought Europe permanently closer to the United States . He argued that American cultural influence has generated a greater sense of personal freedom in Germany , eroded authoritarian strains within society , and generally boosted the status and confidence of the individual -- all developments that have enabled western Germans to thrive in a free-market , democratic environment . &quot; There ' s a sort of social , cultural convergence taking_place that ' s making ( Western ) Europe and the U.S. more similar , &quot; Borinski said . &quot; I think it has a positive effect in that it helps create a much broader understanding -- above all among younger generations , which have been welded together in a common youth culture. &quot; But if decades of American cultural influence have narrowed the Atlantic , they have deepened the divide that still separates Germany and Europe nearly five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall . The contrast in experience , in outlook , and in social values along with such things as people skills and personal confidence still visibly separate eastern and western Germans . These differences also divide Europeans elsewhere between those who were and were not under the American umbrella . The resurgent popularity of retooled Communist_parties in Eastern Europe does not reflect a nostalgia for life under the Soviet yoke , but it does represent a lingering sympathy for the socialist ideals and a protectionist state . While many Europeans are ill_at_ease with the intrusions of Americana , only the_French have cared enough to seriously fight it . Over the years , they have launched a series of counterattacks -- most notably in December , when they fought to the last bitter minute to successfully retain their leaky defenses against the growing influx of American films and television_programs during global trade negotiations . Declaring the defense of the_French language a &quot; political priority , &quot; Prime_Minister Edouard Balladur ' s government has also passed a law requiring that a minimum of 40 % of all songs played over the country ' s airwaves be in French and issued an official dictionary of some 3 # 500 new terms , such_as restauration rapide instead of fast food and disque audionumerique instead of compact_disc , to replace Anglicisms that have crept into the language . Concern about American influence is nothing new in France . It was nearly 30 years ago that the_French publisher J.J. Servan-Schreiber warned of &quot; the flood of American industrial power into Europe. &quot; In his 1967 bestseller , &quot; The American Challenge , &quot; Servan-Schreiber painted Western Europe ' s plight in Draconian terms : &quot; Today ' s generation faces a . . . clear choice of building an independent Europe or letting it become an annex of the United States . The sheer weight of American power is pushing our hesitant countries along the path of annexation. &quot; A generation later , those fears seem highly overdrawn , although a walk through Paris is proof that Americana is_well entrenched . A tiny sandwich shop just off the Place de la Bastille , for example , seemed typically French -- except for the Hollywood chewing gum , the Jack Daniels whiskey , the Getaway pinball_machine in the corner , the framed photo of a Harley-Davidson motorcycle on the wall . While the lure of Americana seems likely to remain for the foreseeable future , in other areas the transatlantic link appears less solid . America ' s reduced political involvement raises troubling questions at a time when Western European leaders stare at a bewildering mix of new problems . To the east , an unstable Russia and a string of bubbling ethnic disputes in the fledgling post-Communist democracies threaten instability . At home , West Europeans struggle to contain growing immigration and rising unemployment . They watch neo-Nazis chase foreigners through the streets of Magdeburg and listen to Italy ' s new parliamentary Speaker praise Benito Mussolini ' s policies toward women . &quot; The situation . . . clearly begs the question : Who protects Europe against its demons once reasonableness is swept_away ? &quot; German historian Michael Stuermer wrote recently . Summed_up Jacquet , the_French foreign_policy specialist , &quot; Europe is undergoing its greatest crisis since the Treaty of Rome . It ' s an identity_crisis ( and ) Europe is just not ready. &quot; Ready or not , for the first time since Americans set foot in northern France to help free the Continent from Nazism 50 years ago , Europeans are facing the reality of reduced American involvement . Some , such_as Crossick , the Brussels think_tank chairman , believe that -- barring earlier explosions -- the Continent ' s long-term future will likely be determined in 1996 when the EU states meet to review the 1991 Maastricht Treaty that committed them to political and economic union . The 1996 review amounts to a de_facto West European constitutional convention . &quot; We ' ve got_to get our act together , &quot; Crossick said . &quot; Unless we take a lot of important decisions ( then ) and carry the public with us , the battle for ( a united ) Europe could be lost. &quot; Crossick , along with others interviewed for this article , believe American involvement remains crucial for the Continent ' s future . But when President Clinton joins a legion of other Western leaders next week on the Normandy beaches to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the historic landings , he comes_to a Europe of vastly different expectations . The Amsterdam hideaway where Anne Frank and her family once listened to D-day unfold is a well-kept museum in a city whose richness and vibrancy symbolize the accomplishments of the new Old_World -- one increasingly ready for a new , more equal , transatlantic tie . &quot; We ' re not asking_for any favors , we ' re not asking_for money or concessions , &quot; Crossick said . &quot; We ' re asking to work as partners to stabilize the world -- but not against anyone. &quot; European Union By providing military and diplomatic support after World_War_II , America became the midwife at the birth of the Common_Market , now called the European Union . * Initial members ( 1958 ) Germany Luxembourg France Belgium Netherlands Italy * Second group ( by 1986 ) Ireland Britain Denmark Portugal Spain Greece * Pending membership Norway Sweden Finland Austria</TEXT>
