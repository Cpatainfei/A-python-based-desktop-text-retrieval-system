   <HEADLINE> EXPRESS AIR FREIGHT CALLED CONDUIT FOR DRUGS , ARMS , PORN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s fast , it ' s efficient and it travels the world -- it ' s express air freight , and some of its biggest fans are drug dealers who increasingly use it to conduct multimillion-dollar deals , security officials say . &quot; Why do criminals use express freight systems ? As well as being fast , efficient and reliable , it reduces the danger of being caught with the goods , &quot; said Detective Inspector Chris Humphrey of Interpol . &quot; that ' s why freight and mail systems are so vulnerable to criminals , &quot; he said at the sixth World Express and Mail Conference last week . Humphrey said a wide range of criminals use both conventional mail and freight and express air freight to send drugs , counterfeit money and documents , pornography and arms . &quot; World trade_in counterfeit goods alone is worth $ 100 billion per year -- that ' s 5 % of all world trade . We ' re talking_about very big business which moves_around the world . Maybe your industry could unwittingly become a part of it , &quot; Humphrey told delegates . &quot; The illegal drugs market in the U.K. is worth 3.6 billion sterling ( $ 5.3 billion ) per year , &quot; Humphrey said . He added that last year 31 % of all drug seizures and 21 % of heroin seizures by customs officials were made by intercepting mail . Ian Watson , an official with the Customs &amp; Excise Intelligence Division at London ' s Heathrow Airport , said in an interview that shipment of illegal goods by express freight carriers is a growing problem . &quot; The express industry is carrying bigger parcels , so we ' re getting an explosion in the number of shipments and the weight of consignments . You can get_up to one kilo of a Class A drug like heroin in one shipment , &quot; Watson said . &quot; Sometimes they are well-hidden , sometimes not . Recently we found statues made entirely of cocaine paste and dipped in plastic coating . . . other times we ' ve found drugs in the false bottoms of boxes or in computer discs , &quot; he added . Watson said airlines generally train staff well to spot suspicious-looking passengers . Customs officials are training airlines and freight_agents to become just as effective at identifying suspicious freight . &quot; When you look_at passengers there are clues which add_up to a risk profile for a drugs carrier or a terrorist . The clues for identifying suspect freight are different but they are there , &quot; he said . Key factors include the origin and destination of a shipment , whether the shipper is a regular importer or exporter and whether he has used a costly delivery service for a consignment of low-value goods . Sophisticated electronic data interchange ( EDI ) systems in air freight provide detailed information about shipments that allows customs to check and even clear a shipment before a plane has landed . Watson said EDI helps to counter crime , but the toughest crime to crack is committed by criminals working inside the freight industry . &quot; You can never be certain how much of this is going_on because the shipments may never come_near customs at all , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
