   <HEADLINE> GERMAN TYCOON DISAPPEARS , TRIGGERING PROBE ; EUROPE : 40 CREDITOR BANKS AGREE TO KEEP MAJOR REAL_ESTATE FIRM AFLOAT DESPITE HIS LEAVING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF DEBT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> German authorities launched an investigation Thursday into the finances of one of the country ' s biggest real_estate moguls and his wife , who disappeared over the weekend , leaving_behind billions of dollars of debt and an empire in disarray . Executives of the abandoned Dr. Juergen Schneider holding company met in Frankfurt with representatives of more_than 40 creditor banks seeking ways to avoid bankruptcy and to complete unfinished construction projects . They agreed to keep the company afloat , at least for the time_being . The Schneider group owns some of the most prominent commercial properties in Frankfurt , Leipzig , Wiesbaden and other German cities . Its collapse could put thousands of workers out of jobs . On Wednesday , Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned the banks against rushing the company into bankruptcy . If bankruptcy is declared , the group ' s estimated $ 5-billion debt would reportedly make_it one of the biggest in Germany since World_War_II . German newspapers , which once called owner Schneider the &quot; Construction King &quot; for his 80 or so projects nationwide , now have dubbed the 59-year-old tycoon a &quot; Gentleman Bandit &quot; and a &quot; Fine Cad. &quot; Schneider and his wife , Claudia , had sole control over their companies ' accounts . He left his holding company a letter last Friday saying he had fallen ill over Easter and was told by his family_doctor to retire from business immediately . Then the couple disappeared , owing an estimated $ 3 billion to banks and about $ 150 million to contractors and suppliers . &quot; Somebody said he ' s in Paraguay and someone else saw him in Dresden , &quot; said Hildegard Becker-Toussaint , spokeswoman for the Frankfurt public prosecutor ' s office , which launched the fraud investigation . &quot; He ' s also in the Bavarian woods . He ' s seen everywhere at the same time. &quot; Schneider is also said to own properties in Switzerland , Brazil and the Canary Islands . Frankfurt prosecutors began their probe after receiving a complaint from Deutsche Bank that Schneider had secured a credit for a Frankfurt shopping_center based on false documentation . The bank , which was not publicly commenting on the case Thursday , said Schneider had obtained a loan claiming that the fancy Zeil-Galerie center had more_than twice the space and seven times the rent-earning potential than it actually had . Deutsche Bank was the Schneider group ' s largest creditor , with loans estimated at about $ 757 million . The bank lent the company $ 241 million for the Zeil-Galerie . &quot; This is just one little bit ( of the fraud ) , and Deutsche Bank started with this . It ' s only one bit . It will come piece by piece , &quot; Becker-Toussaint said . Following the meeting between bankers and Schneider managers , Michael Kramer , a director of Deutsche Bank , said a coordinating committee had been established to keep_company projects going . &quot; The coordinating group is ready to supply the necessary personnel and administrative costs within limits , &quot; Kramer said . &quot; Based on the given information , we have to assume that the companies won ' t be able to run in the long term. &quot; Schneider was known as a vain man and dapper dresser , with gray temples under a black toupee and rectangular reading glasses . He lived_in a fairy tale villa called Andreae in posh Koenigstein , outside of Frankfurt . He traveled the country by private Lear jet . The son of a construction firm owner , Schneider was an engineer who worked for several years at the Frankfurt-based Philipp Holzmann building group before founding his own company in 1981 . He was known for paying his bills late , but bankers considered him a trustworthy businessman . German newspapers criticized the banks for lending so freely to Schneider with so little scrutiny of his business . &quot; Once again , one has to wonder about the behavior of the money houses : The bankers monitor medium-size companies minutely regarding credits , ( and ) with the big ones they turn two blind eyes , &quot; wrote the Berlin newspaper , Der Tagesspiegel . In January , 120 banks were forced to put_up about $ 2 billion to bail_out the Metallgesellschaft metals and engineering group , which had about $ 5.5 billion of debt . Deutsche Bank was the biggest creditor there too and also a member of the board . In this case , most of the loans to Schneider are believed to be secured by properties . The failure is not expected to hurt the banks as much as small businesses and workers , particularly in the eastern city of Leipzig , where Schneider had huge projects . Schneider was fond of buying dilapidated historical buildings and renovating them . But he would keep them and collect rents , rather than sell for high profits as is normal among developers . &quot; Design , this is my life ' s elixir , &quot; Schneider told the Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper in a recent interview . German newspapers and television reported workers on Schneider construction projects in tears and worried subcontractors pulling their machinery out of buildings that they feared might be seized by creditor banks . Schneider accounts are frozen , and company managers have no funds to pay workers or debts . German television quoted the head of the state of Hesse , Hans Eichel , as saying that he had been told by Deutsche Bank ' s Chief_Executive , Hilmar Kopper , that Schneider projects will be completed .</TEXT>
