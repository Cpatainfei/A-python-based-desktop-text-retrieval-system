   <HEADLINE> FORUM FOCUSES ON VIOLENCE AMONG BLACKS ; CRIME : RAINBOW COALITION ' S CONFERENCE URGES AFRICAN AMERICANS TO TAKE ACTION ON THE ISSUE . NUMBER OF SOLUTIONS ARE PROPOSED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The thin young_woman , her voice shaking with emotion , arose Friday near the end of a forum on violence in the black community . Previous speakers had put the blame on many things -- childhood neglect , entrenched racism , poor education and leadership failure -- for the explosive fratricide in African American neighborhoods . &quot; I ' ve heard it all before , &quot; sobbed Tyrene Wilson , a 20-year-old resident of a crime-ridden Washington neighborhood . &quot; I ' m scared to go_out of my door . My brother was shot in the head -- I don ' t know for what . I don ' t think I ' ll see the year 2000 . I need help and I am afraid. &quot; Her poignant plea clearly moved the conference of national_leaders of black organizations and community activists , who had spent most of the day hearing a much more academic discourse on problems of violence in the black community . The gathering was convened by the Rev . Jesse Jackson ' s Rainbow Coalition to consider what can be done about violence within the black community in America . Jackson ' s organization , joined by the Congressional Black Caucus and other groups usually more concerned with legislation than homicide , has focused_on violence because of its profound impact on African Americans . The meeting here was part of a national campaign to induce black people to take action on the issue in their community . &quot; What once was a crisis , a problem , has turned_into a condition , &quot; Jackson said . &quot; Nearly half of all murder victims are black . More blacks kill each other each year than were killed in the entire history of lynchings. &quot; The causes and proposed solutions offered by participants in Friday ' s conference widely varied . New Orleans Mayor Sidney Barthelemy said that his city ' s spending for prosecution and prisons has shot_up in recent years from $ 3 million to $ 30 million annually , forcing cuts_in social_services . &quot; We all know the solutions -- early_childhood education works , &quot; Barthelemy said . &quot; An extra $ 3 billion a year will get every eligible child in Head Start. &quot; But Rahin Jenkins , representing a Muslim organization that works with prisoners , said the nation is confronted with a generation of angry black_men . &quot; It ' s racism -- pure_and_simple , &quot; Jenkins said . &quot; All this crime isn ' t black-on-black crime . Somebody is providing our kids with these weapons. &quot; Psychiatrist Frances Welsing was cheered by some in the audience when she said : &quot; People taking us off the course of talking_about racism are doing the worst violence of all . . . . We must talk_about the cause of the problem or otherwise we ' ll participate in digging our grave. &quot; Frank McNeil , an alderman from Springfield , Ill. , was more pragmatic . Jobs must be provided_for men coming_out of prison if they are to support themselves and their families , he said , adding : &quot; McDonald ' s won ' t even hire ex-offenders right now -- that ' s the reality. &quot; And Efia Nwangaza , an attorney from Greenville , S.C. , rejected Jackson ' s viewpoint that there are too many guns in the black community . &quot; To suggest that we should lay_down our arms , that we should unilaterally disarm , is suicidal , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s the measure of our insanity that we ' ll go_along with the Brady bill ( which imposes a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases ) or any bill that interferes with our right to defend ourselves. &quot; Jackson , who once fought segregation in the South and became a disciple of Dr. Martin_Luther_King Jr. , said he sees the issue as taking_back the moral high ground . &quot; The victims must rise_up and demand a change , &quot; he said in a luncheon speech . &quot; We must change our own ways first . . . . In cities across the country , we want to rouse a movement to demilitarize our streets . . . &quot; Jackson renewed his call_for the federal_government to spend less on military programs and more on social_welfare programs for distressed urban_areas . But the thrust of his message , which has become controversial in the black community , was self-improvement . He asked 100 churches in 100 cities to rescue 10 troubled black youngsters from lives of crime , averting prison and moving to self-reliance for 100 # 000 youth a year . One new program in the anti-violence campaign was outlined by Rep . Maxine Waters ( D-Los Angeles ) , who said that record companies have contributed $ 17 million for a yearlong effort to help 5 # 000 young black_men from some of Los Angeles ' worst neighborhoods achieve self-reliance through a combination of counseling , education and training . She said that those from 17 to 30 years old would be targeted by the Black_Women ' s Forum of Los Angeles for the &quot; LA 17-30 &quot; program to encourage them to turn_away from crime and dependency . &quot; They will include the Crips and the Bloods , the Eight Treys and the Five Deuces , &quot; she said at a Friday afternoon forum , referring to some of Los Angeles ' largest gangs . The participants , who will be enrolled in vocational_education , job training_programs or community_colleges , will receive $ 50-a-week stipends to pay_for transportation and other expenses . Case managers , working closely with those enrolled in the program , will be responsible_for helping them join mainstream society .</TEXT>
