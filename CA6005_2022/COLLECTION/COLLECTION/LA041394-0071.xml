   <HEADLINE> HOMEOWNER DRAFTS INITIATIVE TO PROTECT VENTURA ' S GREENBELT ; OPEN SPACE : THE PROPOSED BALLOT MEASURE WOULD REQUIRE VOTER APPROVAL OF ANY DEVELOPMENT IN THE CITY-DESIGNATED AREA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ventura city voters would have the last say on any new developments intruding_on the city ' s greenbelt , under a ballot initiative proposed by a Ventura homeowner . Bruce Vincent , angered at the prospect of development in orchards next to his east Ventura house , has drawn_up an initiative that would require a majority of city voters to approve any development in the city-designated greenbelt . As it stands now , the City_Council has designated specific agricultural areas to be off-limits to development until the year 2010 . But council_members also have the authority to change its greenbelt rules and are considering such an exception in a controversial land-swap deal . &quot; We don ' t just want this group up there , on their dais , deciding what is best for developers , &quot; Vincent said . &quot; We don ' t want Ventura to turn_into cookie-cutter developments and strip malls . What this city has to offer is things like virtually clean air , little or no traffic , and citrus groves. &quot; Vincent has hired former Ventura Mayor Richard Francis , an attorney , to help him draft the measure and qualify it for the November ballot . Vincent must gather the signatures of 8 # 700 registered voters by June 15 . Francis , who has mounted similar development initiatives in the past , said he thinks the issue will have strong support from Ventura voters . &quot; Everybody ' s assumed the environment is dead , &quot; Francis said . &quot; It ' s not dead . It ' s alive and well and to some extent frustrated. &quot; Vincent said he is motivated by a land-swap deal that could lead to building 436 houses on an 87-acre lemon orchard behind his house . The City_Council is weighing a proposal by developer Ron Hertel to trade 92 acres he owns near the Kimball Road off-ramp on the Santa Paula Freeway for the 87 acres at the northeast corner of Telegraph Road and Petit Avenue behind Vincent ' s home . To sweeten the deal , Hertel has offered to give the city $ 2 million to put a public park on the Kimball Road property . The catch is that both the city ' s property and Hertel ' s property are designated as part of the city ' s greenbelt . And the City_Council would have to amend its Comprehensive Plan before Hertel could knock_down a single lemon_tree on the Telegraph Road property . Many council_members , however , seem amenable to that prospect . In a 4-1 vote two months ago , the council gave Hertel its blessing to go_forward with his proposed land swap . City officials are negotiating with the developer and the project is set to come_before the council for final approval this year . All this infuriates Bruce and Sheri Vincent , who contend that Hertel ' s sales agents promised them when they bought their home four years ago that the orchard would not be developed . &quot; It ' s very desirable to back_up to miles of orchards , &quot; Vincent said , standing on the tiles by his spa and gesturing out at the trees across the street from the back of his house . &quot; We based our home purchase on what we were told -- that if anything happens to this land , it ' ll probably be a regional park , but most likely , it ' ll stay an orchard. &quot; Hertel said his sales agents were never instructed to make such a pitch to prospective buyers , and if they did , they were obviously wrong in doing so . Hertel and some City_Council members , not surprisingly , are less than thrilled about Vincent ' s initiative . &quot; It ' s an obvious move_on his part to prevent the land swap , &quot; Hertel said . &quot; I consider it a selfish act . . . since he seems only interested in himself. &quot; Mayor Tom Buford , who voted for the project , said he thinks the initiative , if passed , would rob city government of flexibility in dealing with future developments . &quot; This certainly is an indication of a loss of confidence in the process and perhaps in particular elected officials , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t think people think this solution is desirable , but they lose confidence in their officials and say , ' We will have to take matters into our own hands. ' &quot; Vincent is not alone in his battle against Hertel and City_Hall . Neighbors in his tract and others embattled by possible development say they are eager to help circulate petitions and drum_up votes for the measure . &quot; I really feel that the city needs to protect green space , &quot; said Les Walker , who lives_down the street from Vincent . Walker says he intends to plant himself in front of local markets and strip mall shops , offering petitions to sign to any willing passerby . Sy Einstoss , whose nearly 30-year-old house abuts yet another proposed greenbelt development , said he plans to go &quot; all out &quot; to get the initiative on the November ballot . &quot; We ' d be another Orange County if we let these guys do what they wanted to do , &quot; said Einstoss , who lives next door to the 222 agricultural acres that developer Brad Jones would like to transform into 815 houses . The orchards are located just east of North Hill Road , between Foothill and Telegraph roads . &quot; Our home was built_on ag land , but that was years ago , &quot; Einstoss said . &quot; I ' m really against any further development. &quot;</TEXT>
