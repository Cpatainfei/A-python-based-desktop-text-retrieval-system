   <HEADLINE> THE HISTORIAN AND HIS FRIEND ABE ; CIVIL WAR : JAMES MCPHERSON DELIVERS FINAL LECTURE AT THE HUNTINGTON LIBRARY ' S LINCOLN EXHIBIT . HE ALSO DISCUSSES HIS OPPOSITION TO A PROPOSED DISNEY THEME PARK NEAR BATTLE SITES IN VIRGINIA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> James McPherson was leading the way through the Huntington Library on Sunday , pointing_out some of his favorite things among the mementos of his old friend , Abraham_Lincoln . There was the Emancipation Proclamation , of course , and the bills ( one for $ 5 ) that Lincoln sent_out as a young Illinois lawyer , and letters written_about whether he should run_for the presidency . McPherson knows them all , for he was one of the organizers of the much-praised Lincoln exhibit at the San Marino library . He is also a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian whose book &quot; Battle_Cry of Freedom : The Civil War Era &quot; is widely held to be one of the best works_on that oft-studied subject . McPherson , who has taught history at Princeton_University for 30 years -- and acted_as a consultant for the much-hailed PBS special &quot; The Civil War &quot; -- was at the Huntington to give the concluding lecture in a series that began in January about the Civil War and its time . But just before addressing the crowd of about 300 , he took yet another quick tour of the exhibit , the biggest , in both size and scope , that the library has ever assembled . &quot; I guess my favorite things are Lincoln ' s letters , to see the evolution of his political ideas , &quot; said McPherson , standing next to one of the cabinets containing several missives from Lincoln to friends and colleagues as the Civil War was about to begin . In times gone_by , McPherson could have moved with the anonymity of most academic historians who write scholarly tomes that are immediately relegated to library shelves . But the immense popularity of his Civil War book has made him into something of a star . Of late , that stardom has embroiled McPherson , along with other noted historians , in a flap involving the Walt Disney Co . He has lent his name , as have such notables as Arthur Schlesinger Jr . and Shelby Foote , against Disney ' s America , a proposed $ 650-million historical theme park in Prince William County , Va . He and other historians have maintained that the theme park would threaten a number of historical sites close by . Disney Chairman Michael Eisner added_to the controversy this month by taking his own shot at the historians . &quot; I sat through many history classes where I read some of their stuff , and I didn ' t learn anything , &quot; Eisner was quoted as saying . &quot; It was pretty boring. &quot; McPherson said he was more encouraged now than he had been a month ago that the theme park might be blocked and that Disney officials might be encouraged to move it to a new location . He has warned that development sprawl &quot; would desecrate the ground over which men fought and died. &quot; At the library -- whose Lincoln exhibit was recently extended_to November -- McPherson was standing near a bust of the 16th President as he talked further about the Disney project . &quot; We may stop them on the grounds that this is really bad for the preservation of historic sites and that it is hurting their image , &quot; McPherson said . * By now , he was running a little late for his lecture . His subject for the day was how important the Emancipation Proclamation had been in convincing other nations that the Union was_on the side of right of the Civil War . &quot; The American sense of mission invoked by Lincoln -- the idea that this New World experiment was a beacon of freedom for oppressed peoples everywhere -- is as old as the Mayflower Compact and as new as an apparent American victory in the Cold_War , &quot; he told the audience .</TEXT>
