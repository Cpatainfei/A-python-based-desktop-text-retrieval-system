   <HEADLINE> GUNMAN CLAIMS HE ONLY TRIED TO WOUND COLOSIO ; MEXICO : ABURTO TELLS INVESTIGATORS HE WANTED TO CALL ATTENTION TO PACIFIST VIEWS . HE IMPLIES HE DIDN ' T ACT ALONE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mario Aburto Martinez , the accused assassin of Mexican presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio , told investigators that he intended only to wound Colosio and call attention to his own pacifist views , said the gunman ' s lawyer and a human_rights official on Friday . And although Aburto refused to tell interrogators whether he had accomplices , he implied that he did not act alone , said Xavier Carvajal , a prominent Tijuana lawyer who represented Aburto during a three-hour interrogation after the assassination Wednesday . &quot; He never said who , but he insinuated that others were involved , &quot; Carvajal said Friday . &quot; However , he gave no reasons , no names , no places. &quot; Aburto was arraigned Friday in a court near the capital , accused of premeditated murder and carrying a gun without a permit . He will face a minimum of 40 years in prison if convicted , said Hugo Morales , a spokesman for the attorney_general ' s office in Mexico_City . It was also revealed that Aburto , who worked and lived_on both sides of the border in recent years , was politically active in both Mexico and the United States . Although he was not a legal resident , Los Angeles County voter records indicate that he was a registered Democrat and may have voted_in U.S. elections . Both Carvajal and state human_rights ombudsman Jose Luis Perez Canchola , who was also present during Aburto ' s questioning , said his confession gave them the impression that others were involved . They said Aburto also admitted to practicing for the attack at a Tijuana shooting range and wanted to draw press attention to his views , specifically mentioning his hopes for coverage by a Spanish-language television tabloid show . Federal authorities say Aburto emerged from a crowd and shot Colosio twice , once in the head at point-blank range , after a campaign rally at a Tijuana shantytown . Perez and Carvajal ' s accounts were the strongest indication so far that Aburto may_not have acted alone . Although Mexican federal law_enforcement officials say Aburto was the only gunman , they have not explicitly discussed a motive or ruled_out a plot involving others . &quot; The investigation is continuing , and we will not engage in speculation , &quot; Morales said . The explosive case now proceeds to a trial phase . In Mexico , this involves exchanges of declarations and hearings before a judge and can last as long as a year . The suspect was flown Thursday from Tijuana to the Almoloya de Juarez prison outside Mexico_City , a maximum-security facility where some of Mexico ' s most notorious drug_traffickers are serving time . Aburto is being held without bail . The case is being investigated by special federal prosecutor Miguel Montes Garcia , whom President Carlos Salinas de Gortari named to the job Thursday . Some of Colosio ' s supporters have openly accused his political rivals of masterminding the assassination . The newly contentious , uncertain climate of Mexican politics -- plagued earlier this year by an Indian uprising in the southern state of Chiapas and the kidnaping of a prominent banker -- has fostered doubts and conspiracy theories . Perez said he does not believe that the gunman acted alone . &quot; I doubt that he acted alone because of the circumstances of the crime , &quot; said Perez , a respected figure in Baja California . &quot; For one , the fact that he practiced to shoot him . He needed information to get there and be there at the right spot . We are talking_about a maquiladora worker . All of this makes me believe that he needed other people . This is the type of act that lends itself collective involvement. &quot; Aburto said he practiced at a Tijuana firing_range during the weeks before the incident . He said he bought the gun from a person whose identity he refused to disclose , according to the accounts . Investigators still have not determined precisely where or when Aburto obtained the Brazilian-made , . 38-caliber Taurus revolver allegedly used to kill the candidate , according to Mexican officials . New details emerged Friday about the alleged assassin ' s life on both sides of the border . A 23-year-old with a junior_high_school education , he reportedly belonged_to the Assn . of Committees of the People , one of the many grass-roots political organizations that thrive in Tijuana ' s working-class neighborhoods . He possessed current voting credentials issued by the Mexican federal_government and the Baja state_government , according to Tijuana press reports Friday that included photos of the identification cards . Strangely , he was also registered to vote_in California -- even though non-citizens are barred from voting . Though a citizen of Mexico , he may have voted_in U.S. elections while residing in San Pedro , according to county voter registration records . The law prohibits non-citizens from participating in federal elections and most local elections . Mario A . Martinez of San Pedro , born_on Oct . 3 , 1970 -- the suspect ' s birth date -- appears on current Los Angeles county voter registration rolls . He registered to vote as a Democrat on Sept . 1 , 1990 , the records show . The FBI has joined the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms in an investigation in Southern California , where Aburto worked and lived intermittently . &quot; We are doing an investigation with the Mexican government following up leads after the incident , &quot; an FBI spokeswoman said . Times staff writer Sebastian Rotella also contributed to this story .</TEXT>
