   <TEXT> Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher met Saturday with former President Jimmy_Carter in a 2 1 / 2-hour session in Plains , Ga. , designed to ease tensions between the two men and between Carter and the Clinton White_House over foreign_policy issues -- particularly the situation in Haiti . Christopher , who has occasionally come under criticism for his handling of the Administration ' s foreign_policy , was said to have been critical of Carter ' s involvement in negotiating the recent settlement with Haiti ' s military regime . Furthermore , the secretary was said to have been deeply hurt when Carter lashed_out at the State_Department last week , calling it incompetent and suggesting -- incorrectly -- that U.S. officials had not been talking to Haiti ' s military_leaders . For their part , State_Department officials and foreign_policy experts in Congress had expressed some concern that Carter had not hewed closely enough to U.S. policy in negotiating the terms of an agreement in which Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras and other Haitian military_leaders would step_down to allow the return of elected President Jean-Bertrand Aristide . A State_Department official said Saturday that the meeting between Christopher , who once served in the Carter_Administration , and the former President had been cordial and constructive . Christopher expressed the Administration ' s gratitude to the former President for &quot; his help in negotiating the arrangements that allowed the U.S.-led force to land in Haiti without opposition , &quot; the official said . Based on the discussions , both men indicated that there will be an improvement in future communications and coordination between Carter and the Administration , the official said .</TEXT>
