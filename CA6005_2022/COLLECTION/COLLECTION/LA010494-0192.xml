   <HEADLINE> PERSISTENT HIGH_PRESSURE SYSTEM BAKES SOUTHLAND ; WEATHER : GLENDALE LED U.S. CITIES WITH RECORD HIGHS OF 89 SUNDAY AND 87 MONDAY . BUT NORMAL WINTER RAINFALL IS STILL FORECAST .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A massive high-pressure system brought more sunny skies and record temperatures to Southern California on Monday , but forecasters said chances are still good for above-average rainfall here this winter . Top readings in the 70s broke records in Paso Robles , San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara on Monday , and the high of 86 at the Los Angeles Civic Center fell just one degree short of the record for the date , set_in 1902 . Glendale led all U.S. cities for two straight days , recording a high_temperature of 89 degrees on Sunday and a mark of 87 degrees on Monday , meteorologists said . The overnight low in downtown Los Angeles was 59 degrees , which tied the previous record high minimum for the date , established in 1928 . The balmy weather that started before Christmas has come from a series of high-pressure systems that have blocked the usual onshore flow of moist , marine air from the Pacific while holding wintry storms at_bay , forecasters said . One such storm from the Gulf of Alaska had been headed this way for several days , and it looked_for a while as though there could be at least a_few sprinkles here by tonight . However , an unusually strong ridge of high_pressure built over Southern California on Monday , forming a barrier that will keep the main body of the storm well to the north , meteorologists said . The storm system should bring cloudiness that will keep today ' s temperatures at least 10 degrees cooler than Monday ' s , but no rain is expected south of the San Joaquin Valley . Anyone who thinks it has been drier than usual here lately is right . The National Weather Service said the total rainfall in Los Angeles during the month of December was only 0.78 of an inch , about 1.25 inches less than normal for the month . Not to worry . Curtis Brack , a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc. , said conditions still appear to be shaping_up for normal -- or above-normal -- rainfall in January and February , the months during which Los Angeles usually gets its heaviest rainfall . Measurements by the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration continue to confirm a return of El Nino -- a phenomenon of shifting winds and ocean_currents that generally brings unusually heavy rainfall to Southern California during the winter . The phenomenon , which prevailed in late 1992 and early 1993 after an eight-year hiatus , is thought to have caused last winter ' s unusually wet conditions in California and extreme cold in the Eastern United States . For the time being , there is no rain in_sight for Southern California .</TEXT>
