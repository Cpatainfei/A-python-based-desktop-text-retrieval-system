   <HEADLINE> U.S. , JAPAN SEEK TO AVOID TRADE RUPTURE ; ECONOMY : HIGH-LEVEL TALKS STRETCH PAST MIDNIGHT IN EFFORT TO AVOID SANCTIONS AGAINST TOKYO . OUTCOME WILL AFFECT DIRECTION OF MARKETS , ELECTORAL POLITICS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> High-level U.S. and Japanese negotiators met into the night Friday , hoping to find enough common_ground to avoid a rupture in trade relations that could further weaken the dollar and send crucial economic relations between the two countries into a tailspin . Japanese Trade Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto ended talks with U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor at midnight , saying the two men planned to meet again . The talks were expected to go well past the midnight Friday deadline set by the United States as both sides seek ways to head_off steps that could lead to the imposition of trade sanctions against Japan -- and upset the Clinton_Administration ' s effort to win approval of a global trade agreement . Kantor scheduled a midday news_conference today to announce what actions the United States planned to take . The two sides were described by a senior U.S. aide as &quot; pretty close &quot; to an agreement covering U.S. insurance_companies ' access to the Japanese market . But a wider gulf remained in the effort to open Japan to greater purchases of U.S. automobiles , auto parts and glass . Both sides characterized the negotiators as relatively close to an agreement covering the Japanese government ' s purchases of foreign telecommunications and medical equipment . The results of the talks could echo throughout the sensitive arenas of trade and electoral politics , as the White_House tries to use U.S. trade laws to pry open the potentially lucrative Japanese market to U.S. companies while presenting voters next month with a clear foreign_policy triumph that would put dollars in American pockets . In addition , pressure on both sides to reach an agreement was increased by the potential for disruptions in economic and diplomatic arenas beyond the talks : Failure to reach agreement could push the value of the yen higher and the dollar lower and damage support for the global trade pact facing a vote_in Congress . It could also create a sour atmosphere at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation talks that Clinton is to attend in Indonesia in November . Administration and industry officials said that failure to reach significant agreements sometime this morning would likely trigger steps leading to sanctions targeted at Japan ' s $ 4.5-billion to $ 5-billion industry that supplies flat glass for windows and other purposes . Less than 1 % of Japan ' s supply comes from the United States . Kantor also is trying to make inroads in the auto industry , which accounts_for about two-thirds of the United States ' $ 60-billion trade_deficit with Japan . Kantor has demanded that the Japanese government pressure its auto industry to buy $ 40 billion worth of parts , representing 20 % of its market , from the United States , a demand that Tokyo has rejected . If the United States refuses to retreat from this &quot; astronomical figure , &quot; and , indeed , does not drop its demand for such specific targets , said Kiyohiko Nanao , economics counselor of the Japanese Embassy , the talks will fall_apart and with them the progress made in other areas . For the second time this week , Japanese Trade Minister Hashimoto flew to Washington from Tokyo , to join Foreign Minister Yohei Kono late Friday evening in talks with Kantor at the modest offices of the U.S. trade representative one block west of the White_House . &quot; We are at the last stretch , &quot; Nanao said . The insurmountable obstacle Friday , according to Japanese officials , remained unchanged from the start of the negotiations in July , 1993 . That is the United States ' insistence that some form of &quot; objective criteria &quot; be found to measure the progress of U.S. companies in the Japanese market . Japan has argued that any specific targets would amount to interference in free_trade and that it cannot force industries or consumers to buy a specified amount of U.S. products . With little expectation that the negotiators would be able to bridge all_the gaps in the overnight end game , U.S. officials indicated -- and Japanese officials privately agreed -- that the likely outcome would be limited agreements covering the insurance industry and Japanese government procurement , coupled with movement toward limited sanctions imposed at some distant point , or antitrust suits intended to put greater pressure on Japan to buy flat glass and auto parts from U.S. manufacturers . Japanese officials said they hope that , if full agreement is not reached , they could head_off sanctions by proposing that the two sides accept the limited agreements already achieved , in insurance and government procurement , and agree to continue the automotive and flat glass talks after a break . In pressing such a course , they were taking the chance that a split in the U.S._government , with the State_Department and Treasury said to be leaning toward reconciliation , would make_it difficult for the trade office to line_up support for imposition of sanctions . Seven months ago , a U.S.-Japanese meeting at the White_House ended in failure , sending the dollar to new lows against the yen -- making Japanese products more expensive in the United States and thus less desirable .</TEXT>
