   <HEADLINE> OWNERS KEEP THE LID ON THE CAP -- FOR NOW ; BASEBALL : THEY GIVE THE EXECUTIVE_COUNCIL APPROVAL TO DECLARE AN IMPASSE AND IMPLEMENT THE PROPOSAL IF THERE ISN ' T A SETTLEMENT WITH PLAYERS BY DEC . 22 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Major_league baseball owners took the anticipated step Thursday , but not in the anticipated form . They voted , 25-3 , with the Baltimore_Orioles , Toronto Blue_Jays and New York Mets opposing , to give their executive_council the authority to declare an impasse in their bargaining dispute with the players ' union and implement their salary-cap proposal . However , they also gave their negotiating committee seven more days to break the stalemate with the union . If that stalemate still exists on Dec . 22 , the implementation goes_into effect , acting Commissioner Bud Selig said . &quot; We have repeatedly said that implementation isn ' t the long-term solution , &quot; Selig said . &quot; We need to reach an agreement at the bargaining table , not in Congress or the courts , and if there ' s even a scintilla of hope we have to pursue it . &quot; I mean , we ' re appealing_to the union for reason and common_sense . Seven more days. &quot; The bargaining talks will probably resume under special mediator William J . Usery in Washington on Monday , which would reduce those seven days to four . Union leader Donald Fehr , reached in New York , called it a positive development &quot; but I can ' t tell you what it will lead to. &quot; The implementation would have gone_into effect today if the union had refused to postpone two roster deadlines , but Fehr said the players would agree to move Saturday ' s deadline for clubs to offer arbitration to their own free_agents to Dec . 23 , along with the Dec . 20 deadline for tendering 1995 contracts . &quot; Without agreeing that an impasse exists or their right to declare an impasse , we ' re glad they ' ve taken this step , &quot; Fehr said of the delay . &quot; I think everyone would agree that there was a different and constructive tone ( during the final 48 hours of talks in Rye Brook , N.Y. ) . &quot; It is difficult to say whether the owners ' decision to postpone implementation for a second time -- they canceled a Dec . 5 meeting at the urging of Usery -- is merely the latest chapter in what some believe has been a shameful attempt by both sides to establish evidence of good-faith bargaining if that becomes an issue before the National Labor Relations Board or whether their differences were legitimately narrowed in Rye Brook . It was learned that the owners voted approval of implementation despite a warning by the attorney for Fred Wilpon , co-owner of the Mets . Wilpon brought his own attorney to Thursday ' s meeting for the purpose of advising fellow owners they can not win a union challenge on implementation before the NLRB . Selig said the legal questions -- the NLRB has already announced it is issuing two complaints against the owners for failing to make a $ 7.8-million pension payment to the players from All-Star game receipts -- are not an issue . But the potential consequences , financial and otherwise , could be significant , and one aspect of a union challenge to implementation would be that an impasse doesn ' t exist . &quot; I seriously question whether they can prove it does after the last two or three days in Rye Brook , &quot; a union lawyer said , referring to an ongoing exchange of proposals and concepts and what seemed to be , sources on both sides said , displays of flexibility from both on the payroll tax and how the owners ' revenue-sharing pool would be created and funneled . A source said that even after Wednesday ' s talks broke_off and the owners ' negotiating committee arrived in Chicago there was clandestine contact between the sides . John Harrington , chairman of the negotiating committee and chief_executive_officer of the Boston Red Sox , said the committee decided to recommend a delay while flying to Chicago . &quot; The philosophical gap ( relating to a mechanism that will produce a stronger drag_on salaries and a closer relationship between revenue and salaries ) is still so large it ' s hard to say we ' re any closer , &quot; Harrington said . &quot; But the fact we ' re still talking is a measure of progress in itself . &quot; We ' re appealing_to the players , their wives and families . Implementation is not in our hearts . We ' re extending an olive branch. &quot; Said Fehr , of the olive_branch : &quot; I hope that ' s what this turns_out to be. &quot; Otherwise , Atlanta Brave President Stan Kasten said , implementation will only &quot; escalate the rhetoric , harden feelings and prolong this war. &quot; On Thursday general_managers were briefed on how the new system works in a morning meeting and quietly selected a committee to deal with the concept of replacement players if the camps open without an agreement next spring , when the union would resume the strike . The ensuing decision to delay implementation pleased Dodger owner Peter O ' Malley , who has lobbied for a partnership with the players . &quot; Implementation is the direct opposite of a partnership and should absolutely be the last_resort , &quot; he said . &quot; I had hoped common_sense would prevail ( in the negotiations ) . It makes no sense to have to implement. &quot; Sense ? The latest spending spree by the owners makes even less . How does_it relate to the quest_for cost control and certainty ? &quot; There ' s a lot of money in baseball , &quot; Kasten said . &quot; There ' s a lot of money that can be paid_out . &quot; But whether it ' s a salary cap or a tax mechanism , we ' re seeking a better connection between what ' s coming in and what ' s going out. &quot; They will look_for it at the table again . Only seven more days , they insist . Perhaps . * ON THE MOVE : Tony Fernandez signed with the Yankees , but Hal Morris agreed to remain with the Reds , meaning Kevin Mitchell is probably gone .
