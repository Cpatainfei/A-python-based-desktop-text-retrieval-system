   <HEADLINE> TRAVELING IN STYLE ; THE RIVER FROM DEEP WITHIN ; CANOEING DOWN AND HIKING ALONG THE NOATAK RIVER IN ARCTIC ALASKA IS AN EXPERIENCE BOTH MYSTERIOUS AND ENLIGHTENING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> THE FIRST THING I SEE IS A FOREST OF ANTLERS ABOVE THE NEXT BEND . As we drift downstream , tracking from right to left in the current , the plane of view that contains the caribou shifts above the shoreline , bringing their bodies into sight . There are about a dozen -- brown with blunt snouts and white throats and rumps , each head equipped with an enormous rack . Some of the antlers are bleeding -- the natural result of shedding their velvet , which is hanging off in strips . The animals freeze for a_few seconds , looking_at us . Then they take_off running , hooves swishing in the sand and gravel , the sound augmented by a curious clicking of their heel tendons . In a great cacophony , the group splashes into the river and ferries en masse to the other side , heads and backs above the water . When they reach shore , they explode in spray and bound up over the bank into the tundra . The river is the Noatak , in northwestern Alaska . Four hundred miles long , and draining most of the central Brooks Range north of the Arctic_Circle , it is the main artery of the largest undisturbed riparian system in America . Dividing the spruce forests of the Alaskan interior from the North Slope tundra , the Brooks Range is the last great wilderness in North_America . The river ' s source is in the very heart of the region , on Mt . Igikpak in Gates of the Arctic National_Park . The name Noatak , appropriately enough , means &quot; from deep within &quot; in the local Inupiat language . My previous experience of Alaska had been limited to the southeastern part of the state , which -- being largely defined by glaciers -- is confined by snow and ice even in late summer . North of the Arctic_Circle , surprisingly , the land remains free_of both until early fall . It is thus good country for hiking and canoeing , which is why I ' m here . And it has the added attraction of migrating caribou , one of the great spectacles in the natural world . The caribou -- Rangifer_tarandus granti , the New World version of reindeer -- is the most common large herbivorous mammal in northern Alaska . Like the grizzly_bear and the wolf , it was once abundant throughout North_America -- even as far south as Nevada and New Mexico -- but retreated before the advance of civilization . About 30 subgroups of the species now inhabit the Arctic , with the largest concentration , about 300 # 000 animals , in the western-central portion of the region . They winter on the fringes of forests in the southern valleys of the Brooks Range and travel north in spring to their calving grounds on the tundra , moving_in immense herds of thousands that have been likened to invading armies or encroaching weather fronts . They summer on the North Slope and begin moving south again in August , just before the return of winter . No one can predict which routes the animals will follow from year to year . The Noatak is , however , one of the rivers the caribou most often cross . I VISITED THE NOATAK LAST AUGUST IN A GROUP OF ABOUT 15 , ORGANIZED by a California-based outfitter specializing in such expeditions . Our embarkation point was the town of Bettles ( population 51 ) , about 150 miles northwest of Fairbanks . From Bettles we took a floatplane into the Noatak basin . As we approached the river ' s headwaters , we saw snow on the higher peaks . The landscape below was green and yellow , though that would change before the end of our two-week trip . Late August is fall_in the Brooks Range , the one window of climatic serenity in the Arctic year . From November through February , of course , the Arctic is lightless and covered with snow . Temperatures reach as low as 50 degrees below zero . Spring and summer , on the other hand , are insect hell . Humans worry about mosquitoes , but caribou are more concerned with flies , two types in particular -- the bumblebee-like warble_fly and the nostril fly ( so named because it leaves its larvae in the caribou ' s nose ) . In July , the height of the fly season , caribou basically go berserk . They shake their heads , stamp their feet , bury their noses , plunge into lakes and stampede across mountains , seeking_out wind-swept spots where bugs have a hard_time flying . By mid-August , when shortening days bring falling temperatures , along with the first frosts and snows , the insects disappear . And this was when we humans appeared with our tents and canoes . On our first day , however , we didn ' t paddle at all . We set_out on foot across the tundra , that unique Arctic ecosystem whose name derives from a Lappish word meaning treeless plain . There is little precipitation here and the growing season is brief . Permafrost , frozen earth underlying the shallow topsoil , blocks the seepage of water into the soil below , preventing plants from growing deep roots and turning the Arctic into one vast bog . Plants on the tundra rarely grow higher than one ' s knee . A spruce takes 30 years to reach shoulder level ; a miniature willow may be a century old . We made our way in rubber_boots through yellow net-leaf willow , white reindeer_lichen , low-bush cranberries with red leaves , and tiny , semisweet blueberries , their sugars concentrated by recent frosts . Mushrooms sprouted among microcosmic bonsai arrangements , many of whose plants were hairy or waxy , to retain heat and retard evaporation . The turf underfoot was mossy -- soft and springy , yielding and benevolent . We came_to a cliff and continued to climb , hand-over-hand , up a rocky watercourse , pulling ourselves up by way of willow branches . At the top we found trails worn smooth by Dall sheep , which we could see as distant white dots making their way across nearby slopes . Closer at_hand , alpine lichens clung_to the rocks , growing at their deliberate pace of a 16th of an inch per year . From the cliff , we could look_out_over the immense Noatak basin and the shining river snaking west.The permafrost in the tundra appeared as a honeycomb pattern -- a kind of terrestrial drainage diagram reaching toward the river . Behind us , scores of unnamed peaks receded to infinity . Even though it was only midday , the landscape was bathed in late-afternoon light . August days are long in the Arctic , but the sun is never very far from the horizon . The actual sunset , occurring at about 11 p.m. , seems to last forever . By the time the sun did go_down , of course , we were back in camp , tottering around on legs punished by the strain of the descent . THE NEXT MORNING , WE LOADED OUR BOATS AND PUSHED OFF INTO THE river . The Noatak is eminently navigable by canoe , as almost nothing resembling a rapid exists along its length . The river was green in its deeper sections , gray in its frequent shallows ; in many places , the water wasn ' t even waist-high . Frequently an aluminum hull would hit bottom , detonating a dynamite-like boom , at which point the occupants of the craft in_question had to get_out and push . Other_than the boom , and the faint sound of an occasional bush plane or gust of wind , calm ruled . Occasionally , streams would meet the Noatak from the side , their progress downhill observable on the surrounding slopes . Distant , Y-shaped , willow-choked watercourses streamed down the dark green mountainsides like sets of light green antlers ; a succession of tiny creeks tinkled over the banks , bearing cheerful tidings . By contrast , bigger streams -- those that emerged from major drainages , qualifying as rivers in their own_right -- carried urgent news . I ' m not just being metaphorical here . Descending an Alaskan river , one repeatedly passes tributary valleys that have rarely , if ever , been explored . These realms of terra_incognita are intoxicating in their mystery , and water emerging from their mouths seems filled with wild energy , like some cryptic messenger from a savage kingdom . At every confluence , the river widens and the current quickens , racing over gravel bars and riffling in the breeze . James Katz , our guide and nature guru , told us that in India , altars are often stationed at such river intersections , marking the merger of two spirits . If one could only decipher the terms of the arrangement in the Arctic ! But a wilderness on the order of the Brooks Range is no quick_study ; the way to approach it is_on foot , penetrating its secret canyons at a pilgrim ' s -- that is , a snail ' s -- pace . Visitors from modern civilization , we didn ' t have that kind of time . On the other hand , we did have ample opportunity to -- as Katz described it -- &quot; lick around its edges. &quot; One rainy evening at dusk , I hiked along a tributary away from the main river . I hadn ' t meant to go very far , but the water kept drawing me on . It soon divided into several branches , and with each diminution in stream size , the world grew quieter . After a while I wandered away from the water , passing holes dug by grizzly_bears in search of burrowing rodents . Vole mounds and moose and caribou tracks were everywhere among the shrubs and grasses . I glimpsed something like a cross between a cat and a dog trotting across the tundra ; suddenly it broke_into a run and disappeared behind a bush . I heard a squeal and it reappeared -- a fox with a ground_squirrel in its jaws . A little while later I heard a loon . Aside from these isolated cries , the tundra was hushed . Alaska is rare -- by which I mean raw , or at least minimally heated and hence underdone . The place has only recently emerged from under ice , so its geographic character is still being formed . Watching a glacial river tear at its own banks , you realize that its present location isn ' t etched in stone -- that within a_few years it may have forged a new course . Vegetation is just being established , so plants are pioneers . Even animals are in a state of flux , their populations booming and crashing , seeking evolutionary balance . &quot; The coming and going of the animals during the short summer gives the Arctic a unique rhythmic shape , &quot; writes Barry Lopez in his book &quot; Arctic Dreams. &quot; He also notes &quot; the serene Arctic light that ( comes ) down over the land like breath , like breathing. &quot; And indeed , the Arctic does exude a sense of respiration . Winter might be thought of as a period of suffocation , whereas spring is literally &quot; inspiring &quot; -- drawing warm air and animals to the land . Summer is a briefly held gasp , a moment of life-extending agitation ; following that , fall comes as a sigh of relief . And it was now fall . As we floated down the river , the landscape steadily grew more autumnal . What had been green and yellow when we arrived became red , pink , maroon , crimson , copper , ocher and vermilion . The change was imperceptible day by day , but by the time the bush planes picked us up , it was all-encompassing : Entire mountains had been painted scarlet ; the veins of their watercourses were gleaming gold . Within a_few weeks it would all be white . This is a cycle we undergo every second of every season . But in the Brooks Range , where change is both protracted and abrupt , it seems to be illustrated in an enormous book with vivid colors . It ' s a volume available only in Alaska , legible in the long light of an Arctic autumn .
