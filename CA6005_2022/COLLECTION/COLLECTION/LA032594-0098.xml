   <HEADLINE> TEXACO SAYS IT NEVER CONCEALED MASSIVE ' 93 SPILL ; VENTURA : ATTORNEY REPEATS POSITION THAT THE FIRM IS NOT CONVINCED THE GAS CONDENSATE BELONGS TO THE OIL_COMPANY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Texaco executives on Thursday strongly denied charges that the company failed to report the extent of a massive spill of gasoline-like liquid at its lease north of Ventura in School Canyon . &quot; Texaco at no time has concealed anything with_respect_to this site , &quot; said Robert Fuller , an attorney for the oil_company . The spill came_to_light last week when prosecutors served a search_warrant at a Texaco facility in Ventura , looking_for documents to support allegations that the company failed to report the extent of its January , 1993 , spill . On Thursday , Fuller also denied allegations by state wildlife officials that the company probably knew about the magnitude of the spill because it repaired a broken pipeline near the spill , estimated at 370 # 000 gallons . That pipeline was repaired in 1989 or 1990 after a worker discovered a mist of gas condensate spraying from a small crack , Fuller said . A rubber clamp was placed around the crack and a 100-foot older section of the pipeline was replaced the next day , he said . Fuller said the pipeline ' s low capacity would have made_it nearly impossible for 370 # 000 gallons of gas condensate to escape_from the pipeline . Also , since the spill was reported by Texaco in January , 1993 , the pipeline has been pressure-tested three times and found to have no leaks , Fuller said . Thursday ' s press_conference by Texaco was the latest twist in a series of spills in Ventura County in recent months . Even as Fuller was making Texaco ' s statement in Ventura , a deputy district_attorney confirmed that another oil-related spill has been uncovered in the county . An Oxnard refinery allowed oil and other petroleum products to leak into the ground at least four times last year , endangering the ecologically sensitive Mugu Lagoon , prosecutor Gregory Brose said . Oxnard Refinery Co . officials knew the spills were illegal but allowed them to continue , Brose said . Officials are not sure how much crude_oil and diluent were released over the four-month period , but believe it could amount to more_than 10 # 000 gallons . The district_attorney ' s office filed a civil lawsuit earlier this month against Tenby Inc. and Hailwood Inc. , which jointly own and manage the refinery at 3450 E . 5th St. , Brose said . Also named is Morley Chase , the chief_executive_officer of both corporations , Brose said . The suit came_about after a yearlong investigation into the refinery ' s practices by the U . S . Environmental Protection Agency , working with state wildlife and water officials , he said . In the lawsuit , prosecutors contend that refinery officials broke state and federal laws by allowing crude_oil and a liquid used as petroleum thinner to flow into soil , ground_water and an irrigation_ditch near the plant . The suit also alleges unfair business practices as a result of the discharges and seeks up_to $ 110 # 000 in penalties against the company . Prosecutors also want an injunction ordering Tenby to stop the toxic discharges , Brose said . The company has 30 days to respond to the March 4 lawsuit , Brose said . Calls Thursday to Chase seeking a response to the allegations were not returned . In the Texaco spill , statements by state wildlife officials outline the basis for a criminal investigation . In a court affidavit filed earlier this week , Fish and Game_Warden Holly Ethridge said her investigation showed that Texaco knew the pipeline was leaking fuel and tried to conceal it . Ethridge cited the patched pipeline in supporting her findings , saying company officials initially denied knowledge of the pipeline or its repair . She also said company officials should have noticed the loss in its daily &quot; pumping logs. &quot; The pipeline pumped gas condensate -- a highly toxic and flammable liquid -- from one Texaco facility to another . But Fuller said Thursday that no discrepancy in the logs had been noticed by Texaco . Company officials believe the spill was &quot; very old , &quot; occurring over several years , rather than a sudden rupture . Although Fuller again stated the company ' s position that it is not convinced the spilled gas condensate belongs_to Texaco , he acknowledged the oil giant is prepared to spend up_to $ 1.5 million to clean_up the site . Company officials said they believe they have contained the contaminated soil and underground water so that none of it will run_into School Canyon Creek , which feeds into the Ventura River . In the past three months , two other oil-related spills and leaks have been discovered in the county . In late December , 84 # 000 gallons of thick crude_oil flowed into McGrath Lake near Oxnard . And earlier this month , a 30 # 000-gallon mixture of light crude_oil and water flowed_from a Unocal oil lease into the Adams Canyon Barranca in Santa Paula . Fish and Game Capt . Roger Reese said Thursday the powerful storm that hit Ventura County Thursday will have no significant effect on any of the oil spills . The School Canyon spill has been shored_up with containment devices to prevent any problems , and cleanup at the Adams Barranca spill is nearly complete , he said . The discharges found at the Oxnard refinery are underground and are not migrating in any direction , he said .</TEXT>
