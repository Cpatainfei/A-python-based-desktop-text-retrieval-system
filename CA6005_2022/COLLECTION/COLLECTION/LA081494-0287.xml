   <HEADLINE> SEEKING JUSTICE , HONOR FOR SLAIN DAUGHTER ; SOUTH_AFRICA : LINDA BIEHL IS_ON HER THIRD TRIP TO CAPE_TOWN FOR KEY PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH FOUR MEN ACCUSED OF KILLING THE FULBRIGHT SCHOLAR MIGHT BE FREED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Soon after Amy Biehl went_off to South_Africa on a Fulbright Scholarship two years ago , she tried in vain to persuade her mother to visit her in Cape_Town . But at the time , Linda Biehl felt she could not afford the time away from work and her teen-age son at_home . &quot; She kept saying , ' Mom , why don ' t you come_on down , ' &quot; said Biehl , 51 , of Newport Beach . &quot; Those words have come_back to haunt me. &quot; Nearly a year ago , Amy Biehl , 26 , was stoned and stabbed to death in the township of Guguletu outside Cape_Town . The white student activist , who was helping to develop voter registration programs , was driving some black friends home when her car was set_upon by a crowd of young black_men shouting racial slurs . In a bitter irony , it is her daughter ' s death that eventually took Biehl to South_Africa . She has gone_to attend the criminal proceedings for her daughter ' s accused killers and to look_for constructive ways to preserve her daughter ' s memory . Biehl now visits a radically different nation than the one her daughter knew -- one taking its first tentative steps toward a future without apartheid . Biehl has begun to witness the political and social changes that her daughter had worked to bring_about through her involvement in grass-roots organizations , but tragically never lived to see . On Friday , Biehl and her eldest daughter , Kim , boarded a plane to Cape_Town . It was Biehl ' s third trip to South_Africa since her daughter ' s death . On Monday , they will attend a key court hearing that could determine whether the accused killers go free . In a Cape_Town courtroom , Judge President Gerald Friedman is expected to decide whether the four men ' s incriminating statements to police should be admissible as evidence in the trial . The four -- Mongezi Manquina , Mzikhona Nofemela and Vusumzi Ntamo and an unidentified 15-year-old , say they did not commit the crimes and were beaten by police until they confessed . They have been charged with murder , robbery and public_violence and have been free on $ 70 bail since their arrests . Four other men also were charged , but they were freed when witnesses refused to testify . If the confessions are thrown_out , prosecutors say , they will have no case . &quot; It would virtually ruin us because we don ' t have any other evidence against them , &quot; said State Advocate Nollie Niehaus , who is handling the case . &quot; One of the girls in the car testified that she could identify one of the defendants , but then under cross-examination said she could only identify him by his hair . that ' s a bit dicey. &quot; Several people who allegedly witnessed the attack have refused to talk to police or recanted their statements out of fear for their lives , Niehaus said . Meanwhile , thousands of miles away in Newport Beach , the Biehls have been trying to pick_up the pieces of their lives . In addition to Biehl , there is her husband , Peter , daughters Molly , 24 , and Kim , 28 , and a son , Zach , 17 . As the first anniversary of the slaying approaches , the family continues to struggle with the loss of the bright , idealistic young_woman who became an unlikely martyr in the struggle to free South_Africa from apartheid . &quot; It ' s been really hard on all_of us , &quot; Linda Biehl said . &quot; I worry a lot more about the kids and trying to help them deal with this in their lives. &quot; The Aug . 25 , 1993 , slaying -- which occurred days before Amy Biehl was to return home , gained widespread international attention because she was one of the first foreigners killed in South_African civil disturbances during pre-election violence that claimed more_than 9 # 000 lives . Despite the savage nature of the attack , the Biehl family and friends have blamed the system of apartheid for fueling the kind of hatred that led to the slaying , rather than the individuals involved . &quot; I can ' t really blame anyone , &quot; Biehl said on the eve of her latest trip . &quot; I want to understand it . We ' re just trying to understand it as best we can. &quot; According to police accounts , Amy Biehl was driving three friends home_in Guguletu , an impoverished black township , when a brick smashed the windshield of her Mazda . Her friends frantically urged her to drive on , but she was disoriented after reportedly being struck in the face . Screaming , &quot; One settler , one bullet ! &quot; a group of black youths pulled her from the car , then stabbed and beat her , police said . She was dead within half an hour . Rumors that the four accused men might be pardoned under the new government ' s political amnesty program disturb Biehl . Prosecutor Niehaus says those fears are groundless , but Biehl is unconvinced . During her trip to South_Africa , Biehl plans to meet with Justice Minister Dullah Omar to express these concerns . Her daughter had worked for Omar when he was director of the University of Western Cape ' s Community Law Center . Biehl said she still has a picture of Omar and her daughter , holding hands . &quot; I just want to remind him that Amy was still an important_person to us , and there should be some accountability in some way for the loss of her life , &quot; Biehl said . &quot; We ' re understanding , but we ' re not forgetting . There ' s a balance there. &quot; Biehl said she tries not to dwell too_much on developments at the criminal trial . She is doing all she can , she said , to commemorate the anniversary of her daughter ' s death in a way that she would have wanted . &quot; I would rather help keep her memory going_in a positive way , &quot; Biehl said . &quot; If they can remember her as a person who was trying to help , then that ' s the best way to honor her legacy. &quot; Knowing how much the country ' s first historic , multiracial elections meant to her daughter , Biehl traveled_to South_Africa in February to share_in the euphoria . She will be in the audience Aug . 18 when President Nelson Mandela gives his 100-day State of the Union address before Parliament . The Biehls have established the Amy Biehl Fund to help finance grass-roots projects , mostly in South_Africa , such_as those in which the young_woman was involved before her death . During her 10-month stint as a Fulbright scholar , Amy Biehl joined several women ' s rights groups and helped set_up a voter education program . The fund gave $ 4 # 000 to a battered women ' s shelter in South_Africa . The money came from the proceeds of a jazz concert in Washington that Molly Biehl helped organize . Linda Biehl plans to visit the shelter this week and says she also will be_on the lookout for other worthy projects . She is being careful , knowing that her presence could inflame passions . &quot; It has to be done very carefully and out of concern for not upsetting the township , &quot; she said . &quot; You don ' t want to just go bouncing into a situation where you ' re going to cause more havoc than give help. &quot; When she returns to Newport Beach on Aug . 22 , the monumental task of sorting through her daughter ' s research papers and personal effects will await her . Biehl plans to send some of the research to Stanford_University to help the next Fulbright scholar who goes_to South_Africa . There also could be a movie in the offing , Biehl said . The family is considering an offer , solely to raise money for the nonprofit organization , she said . With so_much activity , Biehl quit her job in December to devote her attention to the foundation . &quot; We ' re just still flooded with things to do , &quot; she said . &quot; But you just have to kind of roll with it. &quot;</TEXT>
