   <HEADLINE> ART ; SLICK ART IS HIS BUSINESS ; IN 1987 , BRITON RICHARD WILSON FILLED A GALLERY WITH OIL , CREATING AN OPTICAL ILLUSION SO DISORIENTING -- AND POPULAR -- THAT HE DID IT AGAIN , AND AGAIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> ' Say you ' re sitting in a train at a platform that ' s due_to pull_out , the train next to you moves , and you think you ' re moving , &quot; says British artist Richard Wilson , the subject of an exhibition opening today at the Museum of Contemporary Art in conjunction with the UK / LA Festival . &quot; Suddenly you see the platform and realize you haven ' t moved . At that moment you ' ve experienced a fault in the body mechanism between eye and brain , and you ' ve been fooled . that ' s the experience you have in the oil room. &quot; For those not plugged into the international avant-garde grapevine , &quot; the oil room &quot; is an installation Wilson first completed at Matt ' s Gallery in London in 1987 . The piece , actually titled &quot; 20:50 , &quot; is_on view at MOCA through Jan . 8 ; it has been re-created four times at locations around the globe and never fails to cause a ruckus . Here ' s how it works : Imagine a walled ramp extending into a room . The enclosing walls of the ramp are about shoulder height , and beyond the walls is a room completely filled with black oil -- about 700 gallons -- that creates an unbroken reflective surface . You , the viewer , are up_to your neck in oil , but because of the reflection that surrounds you , you can ' t quite figure_out where you are . The piece is so intensely disorienting that people often flail about and wind_up smudging themselves with oil in an effort to get their bearings . &quot; This is my most popular piece , probably because it ' s the most psychological -- in fact , there will be two on the planet when this one is completed , &quot; the 40-year-old artist explains during an early morning meeting in a cafe in downtown L.A. ( The other oil room is_on view in London in the collection of advertising magnate Charles Saatchi ) . &quot; When you enter the room you don ' t see the work , because there ' s nothing to see -- you ' re simply looking_at a room , or so you think . In fact , you ' re seeing a reflection , but it ' s not the kind of reflection we ' re used to seeing in mirrors . &quot; As you move_into the room , the ramp rises and narrows in_order to create the feeling of running_out of space , &quot; he continues . &quot; The ramp is all you have to keep_from mentally falling_into the reflection , and you reach a point where it ' s like Alice through the looking glass and you flop into another world . The slight raising of the ramp intensifies the feeling of disorientation because normally when you wade out into a liquid -- say , at the beach -- you go_down and out into that expanse . This operates in reverse , and though you ' re aware something unusual is happening , your faculties aren ' t acute enough to know the floor sloped up . People sometimes suffer extreme vertigo in the piece. &quot; Hearing about the oil room , one gets the impression that it ' s not unlike a spooky carnival attraction . Wilson , however , intends that his art do more_than toy_with people ' s equilibrium . &quot; There are two kinds of work : There ' s slap-shot work where you walk in and say , ' Wow ! ' You get one view of the thing and it ' s an incredible experience . Then there ' s work that unfolds slowly and experiencing it is a process of layers peeling back . I want both to happen in my work , &quot; he explains . There are , indeed , subtle resonances to Wilson ' s work , but it ' s nonetheless firmly grounded in a Wow ! school of art more identified with America than England . British artist David Mach , Wilson ' s contemporary and friend , also makes insanely grandiose work that defies belief ( say , a life-size artificial elephant hoisting a refrigerator with his trunk ) , but mostly Wilson ' s work is in a tradition of mind-boggling American Conceptual sculpture that stretches from Gordon Matta-Clark , Walter De Maria and James Turrell in the 1970s to current work by Chris Burden and Nancy Rubins . All of these artists deal in one way or another with issues of scale , perceptual phenomena and the_sublime . However , unlike an artist like Turrell who creates sculpture out of light that has a palpable metaphysical presence , Wilson intends that his art remain firmly tethered to the real_world . &quot; Metaphysics ? Religion ? Never touch the stuff , &quot; he says with a laugh . &quot; I like the physicality of the work I make and don ' t see myself as a Conceptual artist , because the pieces I make are so incredibly physical . However , I suppose they are Conceptual in that they disappear and , like most Conceptual art , must rely_on the written word for any kind of longer life. &quot; An intense man who is cordial yet private in a way that is distinctly British , Wilson is amazingly animated considering that he ' s being interviewed at 7:30 in the morning after having just gotten_off a plane from London . He lives there with his wife , Sylvia Ziranek , who is a performance artist , and their two children ( Wilson ' s youngest child , a daughter , was born just five weeks ago ) . &quot; I ' ve lived_in the same place for 19 years in a building that ' s a bit like a lighthouse , &quot; he says , poking_at a plate of eggs . &quot; It was a condemned squat so I was able to buy_it very cheaply , then I gutted it and rebuilt it . It ' s about two minutes from the Thames , where I have a big old wreck of a boat. &quot; Wilson was born in London in 1953 , the second of five children . He recalls that &quot; an interest in art was always encouraged. &quot; &quot; My father taught art and made art himself -- he made three-dimensional studies of the sea that combined sea patterns with a mathematical equation called Root Three he became interested in during World_War_II when he worked as a radar fixer . I suppose you could call what he does Conceptual art but for the fact that his pieces are traditional -- they ' re made of wood and paint . My father ' s father was a painter , and his father ' s family were tinkers who traveled the countryside making pots and pans . On my mother ' s side , I ' m related to builders and watchmakers , so the family has a long history of skill in the fingertips . &quot; I was a creative kid and was always having fads where I ' d decide to do something , do_it for a day , then get bored . I considered graphic design but found it too flat -- I wasn ' t using my hands enough . When I tried sculpture I immediately knew it was the perfect medium for me , and by the time I was getting_out of my teens I was committed to a career in art. &quot; A fter graduating from high_school in 1970 , Wilson attended the London College of Printmaking in 1970-71 , then transferred to Hornsey College of Art , where he was to spend three years . He earned his master ' s degree in 1976 at Reading University , where he now teaches in the art_department one day a week . &quot; I don ' t know what I teach , but I certainly have good conversations -- I find it very stimulating , &quot; he says with a laugh . &quot; I started_out making fairly traditional sculptural objects and quickly noticed they worked best in certain spaces , &quot; Wilson says in explaining the evolution of his work . &quot; I began building floors for pieces_of_work , and slowly the objects disappeared and the floors and walls became the central components of the work . Basically I was putting architecture in architecture , and I realized I needed to develop that idea as fully as I could . &quot; During the course of this evolution I was getting snippets of certain artists -- there was an interesting artist in New York in the mid-1970s named Billy Apple , for instance , who ' d do things like wash a part of the gallery floor then exhibit the dirty rag he ' d used . I saw Walter De Maria ' s ' Broken Kilometer ' and heard about Gordon Matta-Clark . At that point , people were just starting to realize he was an important artist and he wasn ' t well-documented yet , so I was only able to collect bits of information about him . ( Matta-Clark , who died of cancer in 1978 , made sculpture out of abandoned or condemned buildings -- he would slice them in half , for example , or gouge chunks out of the roof. ) &quot; I made my first installation in 1980 , but prior to that I made impermanent pieces that had a quality of event -- I did a lot of explosion pieces , and I did Formalist things like make a perfectly finished plank , then snap it in half . I don ' t consciously design impermanence into the work , but it seems to be an unavoidable fact of life now . A milk bottle can become a Molotov_cocktail in the wink of an eye , and everything we touch is constantly being adapted . ' My work is essentially about adapting architecture -- I object to the idea that buildings are these gods we ' re forbidden to act_upon , &quot; says Wilson , who has had opportunities to collaborate with architects but turned them down . &quot; Architects , like artists , are very conditioned by what they ' re allowed to do , and we ' re ending_up in a world that ' s completely enveloped in cotton_wool , &quot; he says . &quot; Why can ' t we adapt and change buildings ? My interventions are quite sensitive to whatever interior situation I go_into , and it ' s often the case that I enlist parts of the building to function as the fabric of the work . &quot; For instance , I did a piece in 1989 called ' She Came in Through the Bathroom Window , ' where I cut a 26-by-7-foot window from the gallery and simply brought it into the room . I ' m interested in the idea of taking information that ' s always at the periphery of our vision in a gallery -- say , the radiator -- and making_it the center of attention. &quot; Wilson ' s work of the early ' 80s was well-received in England . However , it wasn ' t until 1985 when writer Michael Newman wrote an article for Artforum about a work titled &quot; Sheer Fluke &quot; that Wilson began to receive wider recognition . By 1986 he was able to support himself with his work , and during the past eight years he has twice been nominated for England ' s prestigious Turner Prize . &quot; I ' ve been well-looked after by the_British Council , &quot; he says . &quot; I tend to be the other act -- I ' m sort of the token wild , wacky artist , which is fine. &quot; In light of the fact that Wilson ' s work has been critically acclaimed in Europe for nearly a decade , it is surprising to hear him say that the reason he ' s never shown in the United States before is because he ' s never been asked . &quot; The invitation from MOCA was the first U.S. offer I ' ve received , although there ' s been a lot of interest , &quot; he says . &quot; What ' s that guy ' s name in New York ? ( Art_dealer Larry ) Gagosian ? His people have been writing , but I ' m not sure I ' m what they ' re looking_for . Galleries need to make money now because we ' re in a recession , and I ' m a risk in that respect , although I do guarantee audiences and I do sell work. &quot; Although the MOCA show marks Wilson ' s U.S. debut as an artist , he has worked here before with Bow Gamelan , an improvisational trio he formed in 1983 with performance artist Anne Bean and percussionist Paul Burwell . &quot; We ' re like a road accident or a building_site -- we ' re not entertainment but what we do draws a big crowd , &quot; he says . &quot; We ' re interested in getting_back to first_principles of sound-making and we don ' t do songs -- we just hit it hard and keep going until everything breaks_down . &quot; ' Stomp &quot; works with similar ideas in that they make music using everyday objects , &quot; he says , referring to the_British percussion act , &quot; but whereas they use things from around the house , we go_to scrap yards -- we ' ve used everything from big grain silos to enormous car axles . The lovely thing about inventing instruments is that no one can tell you how to play them , because they have no history. &quot; Showing alongside &quot; 20:50 &quot; will be &quot; Deep End , &quot; a new work conceived specifically for MOCA that Wilson describes as &quot; a big risk , because I ' ve built the thing over the fax machine with ( MOCA installation designer ) John Bowsher and ( MOCA curator ) Paul Schimmel . The central component of the piece is an upside-down pool , and I haven ' t even seen the pool they got yet -- I have visions of the scene in ' Spinal_Tap ' where they wind_up with a 17-inch replica of Stonehenge for a stage_set , &quot; he says with a laugh . &quot; I work in spaces intuitively , as opposed to mathematically , and can ' t really predict what ' s going_to happen when I begin a piece . One doesn ' t have a clear idea of a piece then go make_it -- it ' s more a case of feeling one ' s way through it . The museum told me they wanted an old work and a new work and that they wanted the oil , so I had to come_up with a piece that deals with the same things without copying it . Illusion versus reality , a sense of vastness , the feeling of a moving_out into an unstable space -- these are the things I was thinking_about . &quot; When I flew into L.A. last year , I was knocked_out by all_the swimming_pools I saw out the plane window and was struck by how sculptural they were in terms of shape , &quot; he continues in explaining the genesis of &quot; Deep End. &quot; &quot; My work is generated to a large degree by the space where it will exist , but I also feed off the location , and for me L.A. has a sense of artificiality . Then there ' s this great hole_in_the_ground which is MOCA -- it ' s as if someone ' s dug it out and put_in an interior . So I started thinking_about swimming_pools and pool shells and a shell within another shell -- hopefully it will all add_up to something . &quot; Obviously , the oil is much less of a risk because this is the fifth time I ' ve done_it and at this point I feel I know it . However , there are dramatic differences in it every time I do_it , and technically it ' s always a major job putting it in . The first oil room cost just over 1 # 000 ( about $ 1 # 600 in today ' s dollars ) to build , but when Saatchi installed his in 1990 it cost more_than 30 # 000 ( about $ 48 # 000 today ) . He wanted it for a six-month run , but it ' s been there for 3 1 / 2 years -- he loves it . It had an expensive oil_change last year , but basically it ' s self-cleaning -- if anything falls_in , it ' s just pulled_in . I get the oil from local refineries and use sump oil ( used oil ) because it ' s blacker and creates a more reflective surface than new oil would . &quot; I realize I ' m in danger of becoming ' the guy who does the oil room ' but I can ' t stop doing the piece , because I don ' t own it , &quot; says Wilson , who is also completing a permanent commission that opens in November in Tokyo . &quot; It ' s an interesting situation -- Saatchi ' s permission is required to do the piece , and if he gives it then I must install it . He ' s never agreed to do_it against my wishes , which is very kind of him , but he ' s always terribly happy if it ' s done . Prince Charles will be standing_in it Nov . 2 , &quot; Wilson adds , clearly amused at the idea , &quot; because MOCA has been selected to be the site of the formal opening of the UK / LA Festival . &quot; Everyone always wants to know how far down the oil goes , &quot; he says in parting , &quot; and I always tell them it ' s as deep as you want it to be. &quot; * &quot; Focus Series -- Richard Wilson , &quot; Museum of Contemporary Art , 250 S .
