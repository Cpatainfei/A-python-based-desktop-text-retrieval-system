   <HEADLINE> THE PACIFIC : SPOTLIGHT ON HIGH-GROWTH COMPANIES ; ASIA LOOKS WITHIN TO PROSPER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite recent headlines concerning Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown ' s trade mission to China and impending U.S. economic sanctions against Japan , even a casual perusal of recent news out of the Asia-Pacific region shows that a lot of business there has little or nothing to do with the West . Indeed , analysts say , Asian_nations are looking more to themselves -- and one another -- for new trade ties , economic development and new wealth . And that has propelled the fortunes of Asia-Pacific-based companies at a velocity unheard of in the United States , as a survey for The Times of public companies in the region showed . Just this month : * Malaysia ' s Seng Hup Electric Co . said it would manufacture and sell lighting equipment in Indonesia . * Japan ' s Furukawa Electric Co . said it would establish a joint_venture to manufacture and market auto air_bag parts in South_Korea . * Investors from Australia , New Zealand and South_Korea said they would spend $ 871 million to buy 82 % of the industrial land available at the Singapore-Suzhou Township in China , 50 miles west of Shanghai . The development itself is a $ 200-million venture among a group of 19 Singaporean companies , led by Keppel Corp. , and a group of Chinese companies . &quot; Asia has the fastest-growing intraregional trade_in the world , &quot; said Tom Robinson , chief international equity strategist at Merrill Lynch in New York . &quot; What has developed is a takeoff into sustained growth , where they are trading increasingly with each other rather than outside the region and are able to carry_on their own business development. &quot; Such transactions are the logical next step for businesses in the world ' s most rapidly growing region , where national economies are expanding at a pace that the United States and other Western nations can only envy . A sampling of national economic_growth rates in 1993 , according to the East-West Center in Honolulu : Singapore ( 9.8 % ) , Malaysia ( 8.5 % ) , Thailand ( 7.9 % ) , Indonesia ( 6.7 % ) , Taiwan ( 6 % ) . That compares with between 2 % and 3 % for the United States . Much has been made of the rapid economic surge and huge potential of China , whose economy grew faster than 13 % in 1993 . But the Asia-Pacific region is multifaceted , encompassing the mature economies of Japan , South_Korea and Taiwan ; the rapidly developing manufacturing economies of Malaysia , Thailand and Indonesia , and the financial and service centers of Hong Kong and Singapore . Although the region is diverse , analysts say there are several trends converging in the 1990s : * Rapid development is creating an explosive need for infrastructure , particularly electric_power and telephones . As an example , Malaysian and Indonesian companies are signing an agreement to build a $ 7.5-billion 500-megawatt coal-fired power_plant in southern Sumatra , the Business Times reported this month . * There is a burgeoning consumer class hungry for TVs and appliances . James Ayer , a portfolio manager of global fund at Oppenheimer Management Corp . in New York , observes that there is also a growing body of residents , particularly in Singapore and Malaysia , who can afford to own their homes . * Asian_nations are moving away from being a source of cheap labor and low-cost assembly work , increasingly becoming centers of high_technology and engineering expertise -- in part because of a new class of professionals educated abroad . &quot; In the 1990s . . . in places like Singapore and Malaysia and Thailand , where what they were selling ten years ago was cheap labor , what they ' re selling now is moving_up the technological scale , &quot; said Daniel J . Duane , managing director and chief investment officer for global equities at Prudential Investment_Advisors in Newark , N.J. Assembly will be subcontracted to Vietnam , India , Pakistan , China , Cambodia , even Myanmar , he said . A look_at firms in Asian_nations provides examples of these trends . South_Korea ' s Pohang Iron and Steel Co. , the nation ' s largest producer of steel , and Korea Electricity Power Corp . recently sought listings on the New York Stock_Exchange , a first for companies from that nation . CITIC Pacific Ltd. , meanwhile , is typical of the Hong Kong-based conglomerate , with investments in a wide range of businesses and subsidiaries that are involved in trade , aviation , warehousing and distribution , real_estate and telecommunications . &quot; Our company ' s strategy has always been to focus_on three areas , &quot; said Chairman Larry Yung Chi-Kin last month in an interview with the South China Morning Post . &quot; The first is infrastructure , which provides a fixed income . Trading is another because it generates a strong cash flow . And , apart from these two , we think property investment in Hong Kong is a major area that guarantees steady revenue. &quot; The economy of the Philippines accounted_for a 65 % rise in profits in the first six months of 1994 for Ayala Corp. , one of that nation ' s top industrial conglomerates , the company reported . Ayala holds interests in food manufacturing , agriculture , banking and finance , telecommunications , office_buildings , property management and other businesses . Last month , the company announced that it would lead a consortium of private companies and government_agencies in the Philippines and Singapore to bid to redevelop a Manila army_base . To be sure , there is a downside to Asia ' s growth . &quot; The biggest risk to these countries is I think twofold , &quot; said Bill Wilby , director of global equities at Oppenheimer Management Corp . in New York . &quot; The first is inflationary risk . The second is political , in that many of these countries have not yet made_full transition to representative democracy. &quot; But some analysts point to the support of governments as a key factor_in the region ' s economic_growth : the use of military or other public funds to finance infrastructure spending and other economic development . &quot; They don ' t have enormous social spending programs , &quot; Oppenheimer ' s Ayer said . &quot; The other key point is : In the late 1970s and early 1980s , Japan spent a great_deal of money investing in the smaller Asian_countries . They moved manufacturing and assembly_plants to Malaysia and Thailand . We are now seeing the benefits of that very large investment in manufacturing capacity . . . through rapidly rising exports. &quot; Moreover , analysts argue that a growing middle_class will put pressure on more authoritarian governments to moderate their policies . &quot; The dropping of political barriers allowed a lot of international economic transactions . . . in areas where they either simply didn ' t happen or were discouraged , &quot; said Charles Morrison , director of the program on international economics and politics at the East-West Center . &quot; And you have had a fair amount of deregulation and privatization at the domestic level , occurring in countries where a lot of efficiency was bottled_up by overplanning and excessive government controls. &quot; And for all its increasing interdependence , the region still needs a continuing United States presence , said Ayala Corp. ' s chairman , Jaime Zobel de Ayala . &quot; The U.S. is the only country that can play a security role , &quot; he reportedly said last spring before a meeting of the Pacific Basin Economic Council in Kuala Lumpur . &quot; If the U.S. goes_into isolation , it will throw this region into a tailspin. &quot; How the Listings Were Compiled The survey includes companies in Japan , Hong Kong , Singapore , Australia , New Zealand , Malaysia and Thailand . Companies in South_Korea and Taiwan were not included in the growth surveys because information was not available on enough companies . To be included in the growth survey , a company must have been publicly traded , had data available for the past three consecutive years and had a positive net_income for each of the years . All of the companies report on an annual basis , and companies under a certain size were excluded from some of the listings . All growth percentages were calculated based on each company ' s native currency to avoid exchange_rate fluctuations . Net_income figures for Japanese companies are based on unadjusted net_income . Net_income figures for the Asia-Pacific companies are based on adjusted net_income . Star Data Inc. compiled the data for most of the listings , using information provided by Data Stream Intl . Bloomberg Business News and Investext also supplied data for listings . Asia Pacific Growth The extraordinary growth of companies based in the Asia-Pacific region reflects the fast economic_growth in the area . Most of the region ' s economies grew at a far faster rate in 1993 than did the United States which had a growth_rate of between 2 % and 3 % . The 1993 gross_domestic_product growth : Singapore : 9.8 % Malaysia : 8.5 % Thailand : 7.9 % Indonesia : 6.7 % Taiwan : 6 % Hong Kong : 5.6 % Australia : 4.0 % Philippines : 3.0 % Source : East West Center Largest Companies Recession in Japan has taken its toll on even its largest and most powerful firms as ranked by revenue , while large companies elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific have fared better . 04 # 22 , 24 # 17 , 11 ' 93 revenue ( in billions of % change Company Industry U.S. dollars ) * from 1992 JAPAN Itochu Diversified industrial $ 194.7 -6.5 % Sumitomo Diversified industrial 182.1 -9.6 % Mitsubishi Diversified industrial 181.1 -1.8 % Marubeni Diversified industrial 175.0 -7.5 % Mitsu &amp; Co .
