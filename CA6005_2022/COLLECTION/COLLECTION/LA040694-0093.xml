   <HEADLINE> PACE OF MOTOR_VEHICLE SALES LOOKS PROMISING FOR SPRING ; AUTOS : DETROIT ' S BIG THREE ARE BOOSTING PRODUCTION TO MEET DEMAND . CONSUMER CONFIDENCE IS CALLED THE KEY TO A BIG NEW-CAR YEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Auto_makers today are expected to report a robust 20 % gain in car and truck sales for March , but analysts warn that consumers may get cautious and cause a slowdown later this year . For the time being , however , the outlook is strong , with estimates of March sales running at an annualized rate of 16 million vehicles , including imports . &quot; March looks pretty awesome , &quot; said analyst Bernard Campbell of DRI-McGraw Hill in Boston . &quot; All signs are that March may be one of the best months of the year , if not the best month of the year. &quot; Sales in March , 1993 , ran at a rate of about 13.3 million units , including imports . This year , sales of U.S.-built vehicles alone are expected to top that level , with domestic sales in March estimated at about 13.6 million units , up from 13.3 million in February . Chrysler Corp . has said March was likely to be an all-time record sales month , as it delivered between 12 # 000 and 13 # 000 new Neon cars . Chrysler Marketing Vice_President Thomas Pappert said industry sales for the year could reach 16 million units . Analysts say that Chrysler ' s estimates may be overly bullish , however , and that 15.5 million units is more likely . But they agree that sales should remain strong in April and May , the customary spring selling season . &quot; We feel confident that we ' ll have selling rates around 16 million for the next couple of months , &quot; said analyst Michael Luckey of the Luckey Consulting Group . Ford Motor Co . Executive_Vice_President Ed Hagenlocker said he expects truck sales to set a new record for March . &quot; The industry was really running very strong in March , and ran very strong in February , &quot; Hagenlocker told reporters at Ford ' s Cleveland Engine Plant No . 2 . &quot; I would anticipate again the truck industry setting all-time record sales in March . &quot; The car industry has gotten considerably stronger , &quot; he added . To meet the demand , Detroit ' s Big Three plan to boost second-quarter production 11.6 % from the equivalent period last year , to 2.71 million units , according to Ward ' s Automotive Reports . The Detroit trade publication said General Motors Corp . plans to increase its second-quarter production 13.3 % , to 1.28 million units . Ford will raise production 6.8 % , to 1.0 million units , and Chrysler has scheduled an 18.9 % hike to 428 # 000 units , Ward ' s said . Five European auto_makers reported Tuesday that their March sales in the United States rose a collective 26.4 % from March , 1993 . Bavarian Motor Works ( BMW ) car sales rose 16.5 % to 7 # 283 units ; Volvo ' s sales rose 39.6 % to 8 # 804 cars ; Saab Automobile sales rose 10.8 % to 2 # 335 . Porsche ' s U.S. sales rose 64.4 % to 457 units ; Land Rover sales fell 8.4 % to 336 units . Automotive analysts said the boom may taper_off during the second_half of the year , if interest_rates continue to climb and consumer confidence falters . &quot; We could see sales slow_down a bit , &quot; said Lehman Bros. ' Joseph Phillippi . &quot; The line never goes straight up. &quot; The stumbling stock_market ' s effect on consumer confidence is particularly worrisome , since there are millions of relatively new investors in_stocks and mutual_funds . Analysts generally said they expect sales to hold_in the 15-million-unit range through 1996 . The record year for auto sales in the U.S. market was 1986 , when auto_makers sold 16.3 million vehicles .</TEXT>
