   <HEADLINE> VERDICT HEATS_UP MEMORY DEBATE ; PSYCHOLOGY : EXPERTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ISSUE SAY IT WILL LEAD TO MORE RESTRICTIONS ON THERAPISTS WHO WORK WITH PATIENTS ' SUPPRESSED RECOLLECTIONS , AS WELL AS MORE LAWSUITS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Napa jury ' s verdict against two therapists and a hospital in the recent &quot; recovered memory &quot; case has intensified a debate over whether such memories ought to be considered accurate reflections of the past . The case , in which two therapists were found to have acted improperly in reinforcing the belief of a client that her father sexually abused her , is expected to have long-term legal and clinical ramifications for therapists . It was the first time a non-client -- in this case former winery executive Gary Ramona , the father of alleged victim Holly Ramona , now 23 -- ever won a recovered memory case . Ramona won a $ 500 # 000 award . Some are predicting that the verdict will open the floodgates for similar suits as family members who believe they have been wrongly accused fight_back through the courts . Others say the case will force legislatures -- and perhaps therapists -- to define and limit the scope of practice by mental_health professionals . Whatever the eventual repercussions , lawyers and others say the case has already had a profound impact on a profession deeply divided over the validity of recovered memories . Even before the verdict , lawyers were issuing warnings to therapists : Explain the risks and controversial nature of recovered memory . Take good notes . Avoid leading questions . Use hypnosis or hypnotic drugs with extreme caution . Consult regularly with other professionals . Predicting that the Napa verdict &quot; will chill therapists ' work , &quot; Sacramento attorney Ronald Kaldor , who represents physicians , hospitals and health_maintenance_organizations , said the case will force therapists &quot; to be much more careful about what they do. &quot; &quot; It will open_up a lot of new lawsuits , &quot; Kaldor said . &quot; While it isn ' t new law in the sense that other judges will be bound by it , clearly a new path has been cleared through the forest . Other lawyers will follow and widen that path. &quot; Mary Riemersma , executive_director of the 23 # 000-member California Assn . of Marriage and Family Therapists , said therapists will feel pressure . &quot; Some will probably feel they are being placed in the role of being an investigator to determine whether what the patient presents is fact or fantasy . ( But ) that isn ' t their role , &quot; she said . &quot; On the other hand , it will cause therapists to be much more cautious about the potential of implanting memories in the minds of patients , which I think could be one of the positive results of this case. &quot; It is impossible to say how many cases of repressed memory there are in the United States . With the development of the &quot; recovery movement &quot; -- which includes memory recovery therapy , 12-step programs and self-help books -- more and more people have been coming_forward , revealing long repressed memories of abuse . Brandt Caudill , a Costa Mesa attorney who defends mental_health professionals in malpractice cases , said legal cases involving repressed memory were almost nonexistent two years ago . But over the last 18 months he has been averaging one new case a month . He said most involve clients who once believed_in the truth of their recovered memories , then changed their mind in the face of the intense pain it caused them and their families and sued their therapists for damages . Therapists say repressed memory comes_up most often in cases where there has been severe emotional or physical trauma . In the case of sexual abuse by family members , victims are said to be so traumatized that they erase the abuse from their conscious memory . But whether that is even possible will get a strong argument from many psychotherapists who believe such a willful act of memory erasure is impossible , particularly when the sexual abuse occurs over a period of years . Critics note that this kind of memory suppression has never been documented in a scientific study . Psychotherapists use a variety of methods to uncover emerging memories , often beginning with a single image that is haunting a client , or a snippet of some long-ago event . Memory therapy involves numerous one-on-one sessions , and in some cases hypnosis or drugs . Holly Ramona ' s therapists used the drug sodium amytal to help test the validity of her memories . Therapists say these sessions can last for months , if not years , and are painful to the analyst and patient as both relive childhood traumas . Some mental_health professionals say that although they question the procedures used by Ramona ' s therapists , they strongly believe that many people bury childhood traumas so deeply that they do blot them out from their conscious memory . Santa Monica therapist Ellen Ledley , who defends the practice of memory recovery , said good therapists are very careful about the way they draw_out long-repressed memories from clients who have suffered from sexual and other kinds of abuse . Even so , she said , the verdict will have a chilling effect . &quot; There is no way around feeling somewhat anxious , &quot; Ledley said . Therapists see the verdict as another sign of a growing backlash against the burgeoning recovery movement . Most often the critics zero_in on what they say is the growing trend to explain away eating disorders , alcoholism and a variety of other complex conditions by simply attributing them to &quot; abuse &quot; as children and adults . &quot; Therapists will figure_out a way to cope , &quot; said psychologist Laura Brown of Seattle , an advocate of recovered memory therapy . &quot; My concern is the effect this will have_on ( abuse victims ) . The message they are getting is that if they talk_about what has happened to them that they will really put people at risk , that people will get hurt. &quot; Critics say that if therapists are alarmed and begin to practice more cautiously , then it ' s about time . The critics , including some therapists , fault therapists for placing too_much stock in recovered memories , which they say can be as much fantasy as fact . The results often have dramatic and serious outcomes for the patients and their families . In some cases , allegations stemming from recovered memories have led to the filing of criminal charges and prison sentences . Many critics within the profession do not mince their words . Dorothy Cantor , a New Jersey psychologist who is running_for the presidency of the American Psychological Assn. , said she hopes the verdict shows that the public &quot; needs to be careful who they go to. &quot; &quot; There are thousands and thousands of Gary Ramonas out there , &quot; said memory expert Elizabeth Loftus , a psychologist and professor at the University of Washington who appeared as an expert witness for Ramona . The author of an upcoming book on what she calls the myth of memory repression , Loftus believes that therapists who uncritically embrace recovered memories as facts are not only wrong but are engaging in &quot; dangerous &quot; practices that can produce &quot; horrible consequences &quot; by leading to false accusations . Therapists say the verdict will pressure them into a role of determining the truth of a client ' s recollection of events , something they say they will resist . &quot; Therapists really aren ' t trained to get_at the truth of a client ' s memories , &quot; said Costa Mesa attorney Caudill . &quot; They are trained to see the world as the patient sees it and work within that framework without regard_to whether it ' s true. &quot; But therein lies one of the problems because the patient ' s view of events in recent years has led to criminal charges being filed against parents or civil lawsuits filed by children against family members for damages . R . Christopher Barden , a psychologist and lawyer from Minneapolis , said the decision will force lawmakers and members of the mental_health profession to act to set_up legal parameters and ethical guidelines . &quot; What they cite as evidence is rumor , it ' s innuendo , it ' s hearsay , it ' s clinical chitchat , but it ' s not research , &quot; Barden said . But rape crisis counselors and therapists say people like Barden are ignoring the large_numbers of women who approach them on_their_own , with no histories of counseling , and tell them of flashbacks and disturbing memories . Leah Aldridge , of the Los Angeles Rape Hotline , said : &quot; It is not uncommon for an adult woman to call us in crisis because she is experiencing flashbacks of some kind of sexual abuse and she doesn ' t know what is going_on . These memories often come without any intervention by a therapist , shaken loose by something that has happened , like the death of an uncle ( followed by ) a great sense of relief. &quot;</TEXT>
