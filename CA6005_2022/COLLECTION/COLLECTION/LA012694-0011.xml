   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEWS ; ' BABYLON 5 ' : NOT STELLAR BUT ENTERTAINING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There is good news and bad news about &quot; Babylon 5 , &quot; the latest in a burgeoning cluster of sci-fi series streaking across your television screen ( premiering at 8 tonight on KCOP-TV Channel 13 ) . The show ' s premise is not exactly original but it ' s not a copycat &quot; Star Trek &quot; either.Imagine a five-mile-long , futuristic , United Nations-style space_station called Babylon 5 spinning through the galaxies as a port-of-last-call , a neutral zone on which humans and alien creatures live peacefully and work_out their differences . That is , until raiders from a disaffected planet blow_up a friendly agricultural colony and threaten to divide the galactic ' s fragile political and economic harmony . Well , OK , it does sound a little familiar . Almost nothing in the future , emotionally speaking , has changed . The script by writer-creator J . Michael Straczynski , set_in the year 2258 , wryly mirrors the insanity of the world today with several stinging sci-fi analogies , including references_to a terrorist nuking of San Diego and the destruction of our first Mars colony . Technically impressive , and perfectly scaled to TV , the production hardware is fashioned by compelling , low-key , desk-top-generated computer effects ( designed by Ron Thornton ) , including vrooming &quot; Star Wars &quot; -like spitfire marauders . Visually , the opening four-minute action sequence is textbook editing . On the negative side : Notwithstanding improvements on the show ' s year-old pilot broadcast , characterization is highly uneven . The weirdos and bad_guys are flavorful enough , like ghosts from that &quot; Stars Wars &quot; barroom scene ( notably the lizard-like Andreas Katsulas ) . But the space_station ' s twin commanders ( Michael O ' Hare and Claudia Christian ) are insufferably stiff and seemingly incapable of animated expression , and the dialogue is occasionally banal and trite . Still , to paraphrase poet Robert Frost , there ' s miles to go before this show will put you to sleep . RAY LOYND</TEXT>
