   <HEADLINE> DEFENSE ; PENTAGON LOOKS TO START HIGH-TECH REVOLUTION IN WAYS OF WAR ; CURRENT MEANS OF FIGHTING MAY SOON BE HISTORY . EVEN ' SMART ' GULF WAR WEAPONS COULD BE OUTMODED BY NEW TECHNIQUES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Remember the 1991 Persian_Gulf_War ? Precision-guided bombs that were able to fly into a tiny chimney ? F-117 Stealth fighters that could penetrate Iraqi airspace undetected ? A satellite tracking system that helped pinpoint Iraqi positions ? Well , you haven ' t seen anything yet . Pentagon planners say that as a result of such flashy new technology , the world may be_on the verge of a full-scale revolution in the way the major_powers fight their wars -- possibly the biggest such advance in war fighting since World_War_II . Sparking the revolution is the military ' s increasing ability to use computer links , communications_systems , satellites and sensors to boost dramatically both the range and the accuracy of conventional weapons such_as bombs and missiles . This means that U.S. troops increasingly will fight from longer distances , not actually moving_into a battle zone until after most of the weapons in the area have been destroyed . That should reduce U.S. casualties . At the Defense_Department , five task_forces are studying the new ways of warfare . Both the Defense_Department and some defense-oriented consulting_firms have begun conducting classified war_games designed to probe the capabilities of the new technology . Officials predict that within a_few years , the military will begin phasing_out its current way of war fighting and replacing it with futuristic techniques that would have been inconceivable even at the start of the Persian_Gulf_War three and a half years ago . &quot; We ' re just at the beginning of kind of fully exploring and understanding what they really might be , &quot; says Andrew W . Marshall , director of the Defense_Department ' s Office of Net Assessment , a top-secret Pentagon think_tank charged with investigating such questions . Although Marshall refuses to go_into details , the changes now being considered would effectively junk much of today ' s war-fighting doctrine and substitute new forms of military tactics based on the improved technology : * Instead of dispatching huge armies to the battle zone , the Pentagon will deploy its forces at a distance , using long-range , precision-guided missiles that will replace face-to-face combat . Navy warships far out at_sea might be called_upon to attack enemy tanks ashore . * Both missile and artillery_fire will be targeted by space-based , intelligence-gathering satellites , which would not only track enemy troops and weapons but also direct U.S. firepower beyond the horizon and even assess the damage once the American barrage had ended . * Staples of today ' s armed forces -- such_as tanks , manned bombers and aircraft_carriers -- will become obsolete , to be replaced by &quot; super-smart &quot; missiles and high-speed land vehicles . If ground troops are needed , they will be sent_on supersonic transport planes . Moreover , U.S. forces will be able to launch simultaneous sorties against massive numbers of targets all across a theater of operations , melding air , sea and land forces as never before . Soldiers will be kept_abreast by direct satellite links . As a result , Andrew F . Krepinevich Jr. , a retired Army lieutenant_colonel who worked with Marshall at the Pentagon , says warfare will soon become &quot; a competition between ' hiders ' and ' finders. ' &quot; Any target that can be identified most likely can be destroyed at once . That means the United States and its competitors will be vying to maintain what Marshall calls &quot; information dominance &quot; by using increasingly sophisticated satellites and sensors to detect and destroy enemy weapons while trying to deny adversaries the ability to do the same . The four services also will have to work far more in sync with one another than they have in the past , blurring some of the distinctions between air , land and sea forces . Air_Force radar planes are already supplying intelligence to other services . Krepinevich and Marshall liken the current situation in war fighting to the one that existed in the 1930s , just before the outbreak of World_War_II . Although the latest military technology -- tanks , radios , machine_guns and airplanes -- were available to all sides then , it was only in 1935 , when the Germans put them together into a new kind of high-speed assault known as a &quot; blitzkrieg , &quot; that they became truly effective . Krepinevich contends that war fighting today is at a similar threshold : The Gulf War showed_off the new technology and proved its effectiveness in military operations , but the Defense_Department was still using the same doctrine and tactics that it had developed to fight the Soviet_Union . However , he and James A . Blackwell , a strategist for Science Applications International Corp. , a defense-oriented think_tank , warn that merely having a head_start on potential enemies by having invented the technology is not likely to be enough . Whoever develops tactics designed to employ the technology more effectively will have the edge_in future wars , Blackwell predicts . &quot; The key is developing battle-command systems that allow you to determine what an enemy ' s critical vulnerabilities are , &quot; he says . Robert W . Gaskin , another former Pentagon planner , points_out that much of the high-technology gadgetry the United States used in the Gulf War -- including global positioning system satellite_receivers and night-vision goggles -- already is widely available . Technology for building cruise missiles no longer is difficult to obtain . Weapons experts predict it will only be a_few more years before North_Korea and other potential enemies will develop medium-range ballistic_missiles that can threaten the West . Not everyone is an unabashed booster of the push toward a full-fledged revolution . Dan Goure , an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies , says reorganizing the military to exploit the new technology may be fine for a battle against the Russians in Europe , but it is of only marginal use in a regional war such_as Desert Storm . Goure argues that the Administration should wait until it has decided clearly what kinds of wars the United States will be fighting before it decides to go_ahead . &quot; If you don ' t see a big threat on the horizon , maybe you don ' t want that much of a revolution , &quot; he says . The pace of the predicted revolution in war fighting is unpredictable . Marshall ' s own efforts still are far from complete . And with a_few notable exceptions , the nation ' s senior military leadership has seemed lukewarm to the changes . Michael J . Mazarr , a congressional military expert , points_out that the highly touted &quot; bottom-up review &quot; of policy that the Defense_Department completed early last year does not even broach the subject . &quot; They are fighting the last war , &quot; he says . Even more troublesome to proponents of the new technology , the budget squeeze may end_up preventing the military from adopting some of the new techniques . Still , planners for all four services have begun mulling new ways to deploy combat units to take better advantage of the new technology . And the effort is receiving new attention from two new players -- Defense_Secretary William J . Perry , who played a major role in developing some of the new technology , and Adm . William Owens , the new vice_chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff . Even so , the Pentagon ' s Marshall and his supporters are far from sanguine . Without the press of an imminent war to fight , Marshall says , &quot; I don ' t think there is that much of a vision. &quot;</TEXT>
