   <HEADLINE> THE REAL ' 80S ; IF YOU THINK IT WAS JUST A DECADE OF GREED , YOU MISSED THE REVOLUTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One does not speak well of the 1980s in polite company . In right-thinking circles , the decade merits at best a grim shake of the head ; we recall it without fondness as a period of orgiastic consumption presided over by a Claymation President bent_on crushing the poor , engorging the rich and impoverishing future generations ; a time of crooked financiers shuffling and reshuffling assets , of debt and deception and the selling of our birthright to the Japanese . Oddly , for all_the sense of potlatch that goes_with the era , we also think_of the ' 80s as a deeply conservative time , a pathetic attempt to relive the ' 50s and return to an imaginary America that , despite the weight of our nostalgia for it , really never existed . Yet the strongest sense is one of sickening excess . The era ' s enduring images , for many of us , form a neat trinity : the windowless hulk of an empty factory , a shiny BMW driving past a bread_line , and perhaps the funereal specter of financier Ivan Boesky -- his black suit , gaunt face and elongated teeth giving him the cast of a carrion eater . Fortunately , this is a cartoon . Oh , there was greed , there was Ronald Reagan , there were crooked financiers in funny suits and bad toupees . But the truth is , they weren ' t as important as , say , the rise of the microchip or the increasing porousness of national borders . In fact , this image of the ' 80s as a kind of moral inferno is a dangerous one , and not just because it ' s distorted and false . It ' s dangerous because it could blind us to what is really important about the decade , which is that it was a time of enormous , even radical change . What the changes had in common , mostly , was personal freedom , which increased in the ' 80s not just in this country but almost everywhere . Personal freedom in America had been expanding for years , but for most of the postwar era , freedom and equality had gone together . As opportunities opened_up to more and more Americans , regardless of their religion or ethnicity or gender , the middle_class grew , and the gap between rich and poor narrowed . In the ' 80s , though , freedom and equality were in opposition , and equality was largely the loser . Having schooling or wit became vastly more lucrative than not having these things . Women who became lawyers married_men who became physicians , while waitresses married deliverymen , further widening the gap between rich and poor . Those trends aren ' t likely to reverse themselves any time soon , and , as it turns_out , the usual suspects deserve little of the blame . What happened in the ' 80s has vast implications for our society . World markets are only likely to get freer . The rewards to intellectual capital are only likely to grow . In a global economy that pays_for brains and enterprise , what can we do for those with only strong backs or steadiness to offer ? What are the limits of personal freedom in a heterogeneous society ? Can we survive the diminished sense of obligation that accompanies the unfettered movement of capital , people and goods ? The changes of the 1980s are still playing_out . They are shaping the ' 90s and beyond in America , regardless of who is in the White_House or what happens on Wall_Street . Now that the period ' s most cartoonish excesses have been swept_away , there is good reason to look_back at the decade for a peek at where we ' re headed and how we ought to handle things once we get there . * Much of what happened during the 1980s seems obvious . We saw the savings and loan industry immolate itself , the peace dividend disappearing in the flames of a burlesque Sun Belt Gotterdammerung . A jail-bound monomaniac named Michael Milken reinvented junk_bonds . There was the corporate raiding , the widening gap between rich and poor , the actor in the White_House whose schedule was often based on astrology . Men really did slick back their hair and wear yellow ties . On the global scene , communism collapsed , the Iron_Curtain fell and democracy spread , not just in Eastern Europe but in Latin_America and elsewhere . Free markets and greed -- the greedy are always with us -- killed the big bad oil cartel . But there were a lot of other changes that crept over us slowly , changes whose importance was easier to miss . In the ' 80s in America , personal_computers became ubiquitous , ushering_in the greatest revolution in information management since papyrus . With the adoption of a clever new &quot; packet-switching &quot; data-communications standard , the Internet was born , establishing the paradigm for an information network of such power and scope that , eventually , it will change the world in ways we can barely foresee . The microchip revolution of the ' 80s has already helped to liberate ideas , capital and even work itself from the constraints of place . Today , companies needing documents keyed into computers can have the work done_in the Caribbean or Ireland or Asia for a fraction of the cost , until finally that onerous task disappears altogether . Contract computer_programming is a growing business in India , and Russian programmers are plying their skills from the Silicon_Valley to Lyndhurst , N.J. The microchip revolution penetrated the home_in the ' 80s as well . In 1980 , &quot; Nintendo &quot; was unknown in America . Ten years later , according to David Sheff , author of &quot; Game Over , &quot; a book about Nintendo , Super Mario was &quot; more recognized by American children than Mickey Mouse. &quot; Video_games became so common in American households that in the early 1990s , Sheff reports , &quot; Nintendo netted as much as all_the American movie studios combined and profited more_than any of them , and more_than the three television networks combined. &quot; More_than Apple or IBM , it was Nintendo that brought computers to the American home and made the media interactive . During the 1980s , in an unprecedented democratization of personal finance , middle-class Americans stopped being depositors and instead became investors , with a shot at the superior returns and diversification ( not to mention the risk ) once open only to the wealthy . About 40 million of us now have money in mutual_funds , perhaps 10 times as_many as in 1979 , and by now fund assets exceed $ 2 trillion , which means that mutual_funds will soon have more money than America ' s banks . In the ' 80s , perhaps 10 million immigrants , mostly Third_World immigrants , colored our future , altered our labor_markets and pushed salsa ahead of ketchup as the nation ' s condiment of choice . America is now a country in which Muslims just may outnumber Episcopalians . Imported goods -- another form of_imported labor -- also became hugely more important , and imported capital , for better or worse , became our lifeblood . Never before had the oceans that separate us from the rest of the world seemed so small . Unfettered markets played a big role in this . Worldwide , governments eased their grip on domestic industries and got_out of businesses they couldn ' t possibly run . In this country , deregulated airlines carried more passengers more cheaply than ever before , and for all_the attention paid to takeovers , the deal of the decade was the breakup of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph , which opened the door to the telecommunications revolution occurring all around us . No single corporate transaction during the ' 80s comes_close for far-reaching impact . ( One example : Economist David R . Henderson has calculated that , &quot; adjusted for inflation , the cost of a long-distance phone_call fell by 47 % &quot; from 1980 to 1989. ) In the ' 80s , there was a revolution in our ability to manipulate our own biology , which was in keeping with the continuing revolution in individual rights and the expansion of personal freedom that predominated in this supposedly conservative decade . The first American test-tube_baby was born in 1981 ; now more_than 300 clinics offer in-vitro fertilization , and today mothers can bear their own grandchildren . Despite a supposed backlash against feminism , American women sharply narrowed the earnings gap , in comparison to the ' 60s or ' 70s , and came_to outnumber men in law_school . Gays increasingly became parents ; there are now openly gay congressmen , professional athletes and members of the clergy . In truth , the social revolution that began in the 1960s continued right through the 1980s , oblivious to who was in the White_House . The American family continued to splinter , single parents became more common than ever and &quot; community &quot; came_to imply &quot; subculture. &quot; There was the investment community , the lesbian community , the health-care community and the off-road-vehicle community ; yet the more communities there were , the less community there seemed to be . The ' 80s weren ' t selfish so_much as they were self-absorbed . It ' s no wonder we came_to be haunted by the homeless , those refugees from a time when communities took_care of people who couldn ' t , or would n ' t , take_care of themselves . These spectral presences remind us that freedom , far from being free , can be so costly that it requires payment in a coin we haven ' t minted yet , no matter how much money we may make . * It was in the economy that so many of the changes of the ' 80s most clearly manifested themselves , yet no aspect of American life was more misunderstood . Many people think that America ' s economy went_into decline , that the only jobs available were as burger flippers and that American manufacturing withered . We sold our soul for imports . Government policy and greedy financiers were to blame . What actually happened was much more complicated , but perhaps the most important thing to bear_in_mind is that it was no one ' s fault . Ignore all_the finger-pointing . What happened was the result of historical and economic forces that no one could control . To understand the inevitable transformation of the American economy that occurred during the ' 80s , we need to go_back to 1979 , when President Jimmy_Carter ushered_in the decade in the person of a tall , taciturn economist who smoked a cigar at his own Senate nomination hearings -- Paul A . Volcker . The son of a legendary , upright city_manager who saved Teaneck , N.J. , from financial ruin , Volcker grew_up with thrift in his marrow , and when Carter turned_to Volcker to head the Federal_Reserve_Board , he chose a nominal Democrat single-mindedly dedicated to slaying the beast of inflation . Volcker persuaded his fellow Fed governors to make a seemingly technical decision to change how the Fed tries to control the world ' s supply of dollars , adopting ( and modifying ) the ideas of the influential free-market economist Milton Friedman on this score . The result , very soon , was extremely tight_money and staggeringly high interest_rates -- a prime rate of 21.5 % in late 1980 -- which pushed the nation into the worst recession since the Great Depression . America entered this recession , and embarked_on the ' 80s , after years of slow productivity growth , its sclerotic large companies in many ways unprepared for modern challenges . Personal_income had been stagnant since 1973 , and throughout the 1970s , the rich got richer while the poor got poorer . For a close-up of America ' s economic problems in those days , consider the tire industry . Once practically unchallenged in the domestic marketplace , America ' s tire makers were headed for a fall_in the 1970s . The world had discovered that the radials pioneered by Michelin in France and Pirelli in Italy were far superior to the bias-ply tires that still prevailed here . Radials got better gas mileage , which made them increasingly de_rigueur as original equipment after the 1973 oil shock , and they were more durable . Yet America ' s tire industry seemed unable to adapt to the rapidly changing global environment . Most U.S. tire capacity , configured for producing bias-plies , was useless in the coming world of radials , and many U.S. operations were crammed into ancient and inefficient factories . Japanese cars , meanwhile , offering better quality and fuel efficiency , were pouring into the country . They came_with Japanese tires . A brutal shakeout was inevitable , and the recession of 1981 triggered it . In 1979 about 127 # 000 Americans worked in tire manufacturing . In 1983 the figure was just 94 # 000 . Last year it averaged 81 # 300 . Yet these 81 # 300 tire workers managed to produce a record 260 million tires . In fact , 36 % fewer workers made 17 % more tires . They achieved not only quantity but also quality . The switch to radials meant tires that last two to four times as long , and that in most places obviate snow_tires and chains ( with help from the spread of front-wheel and four-wheel-drive vehicles ) . The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration , which grades tires on tread wear , temperature and traction , has found that while 100 was a typical tread-wear rating before radials , it ' s no longer uncommon to find tires rated above 500 . Tires are scoring so high , says NHTSA engineer Nelson Gordy , that the agency is thinking_of changing the rating_system . What happened ? Prodded by international competition , the American tire industry was re-created in the ' 80s . Many venerable firms were sold to motivated European and Japanese buyers , who often paid top dollar to buy_into the gigantic U.S. market and then backed_up their purchases with large additional investments . Thus , Firestone Inc. was acquired for $ 2.6 billion in 1988 by Bridgestone Corp . of Japan , which invested another $ 1.5 billion modernizing Firestone factories . Just a year after the acquisition , Bridgestone built a $ 350-million state-of-the-art truck-tire plant in rural Warren County , Tenn . Pirelli , which bought Armstrong for $ 197 million in 1988 , invested more_than that in upgrading Armstrong facilities . Continental bought General Tire . Michelin bought Uniroyal-Goodrich . Today Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co . is the last of the American tire giants ( after escaping a British takeover_attempt ) . But its main global competitors -- Bridgestone-Firestone , Michelin and others -- all have factories here . American tire-making long ago left Ohio -- where Akron is living_on quite nicely without it -- but not for Taiwan or Guadalajara . Today the industry is centered in Oklahoma , Tennessee and North Carolina , at plants that are still almost entirely union . New Fords often come_with Michelins , but new Toyotas often come_with Goodyears . In an era when many Americans imagine that U.S. manufacturing is_on the wane , it may come as a surprise that this sort of thing wasn ' t unique to the tire industry . Although 1.6 million U.S. manufacturing jobs , 8 % of the total , were lost from 1979 to 1990 , American manufacturing is stronger than it has been in two decades . In fact , manufacturing accounted_for more of the national output in 1989 than in 1979 . Better yet , U.S. manufacturing is strongest in the most profitable areas : not TV_sets and VCRs , but business equipment and technology . In the last_half of the 1980s , for instance , steel output shot_up , and American producers began to beat_back imports . How ? The Bureau of Labor Statistics in a May , 1994 , study points to the rise of efficient new mini-mills , the restructuring of big old facilities into smaller , nimbler plants and the spread of advanced steelmaking technology . Productivity -- output per hour worked -- accelerated to an average annual gain of 3.5 % from 1979 to 1991 , after years of no gains at all . For steelworkers , though , the new technology meant considerable suffering . It cut the average number of jobs in the industry by a stunning 6.1 % annually from 1979 to 1992 , and it raised the skill level of the jobs that remained . Improved furnaces , continuous casting , new finishing facilities and computerized controls all required more training , the government survey found . Yet , if we were to have any steel_industry at all , staying with obsolete equipment and ways of doing things was not an option . Thus , what went_wrong during the ' 80s was not the disappearance of 355 # 000 steelmaking jobs since 1973 ; that was inevitable . Where we failed was in not doing more for those whose jobs disappeared . The economy did produce more jobs , a net increase of 19 million during the longest peacetime expansion since World_War_II . But the mark of this prosperity was its unevenness ; the best-educated benefited most . Many of the new jobs paid poorly or lacked benefits such_as health_insurance . Women made strong gains , although they still were paid less than men , and many were forced into the workplace because their spouses earned less . It ' s hard to overemphasize the role of the personal_computer in why the ' 80s produced the winners and losers that they did . The IBM PC appeared in 1981 . Apple and others were already making small computers , but the IBM imprimatur told corporate America that this was a business machine , not a toy . IBM made the unbelievably fateful decision to adopt an &quot; open architecture , &quot; meaning that it would tell everyone how its personal_computers worked so there would be plenty of add-on equpment , and thus IBM ' s type of computers became standard . The effect was staggering . In 1979 there were fewer than 1 million personal_computers being used in this country . The figure now probably exceeds 50 million , and computers are an integral part of a telecommunications_system that also includes 10 million fax machines and 15 million cellular_telephones . Worldwide , computers are now outselling automobiles . Princeton economist Alan B . Krueger , who has studied the effects of computers on wages , finds that people who use a computer at_work earn 10 % to 15 % more_than those who don ' t . ( To rule_out genetic factors , he even studied twins in cases where one sibling had computer skills and the other didn ' t. ) More remarkably , Krueger figures that &quot; the proliferation of computers can account_for between one-third and one-half of the increase in the rate of return to education &quot; from 1984 to 1989 . In other words , computers played a big role in the income-inequality drama . Consider once again the tire industry , this time the fate of a single plant in Akron . Starting in 1916 , Goodyear made tires in this great brick factory , its 12-story clock_tower the keynote of the city ' s skyline just as Goodyear was the cornerstone of the city ' s economy . Generations of workers , some college educated but most not , brought_home a healthy paycheck from the old place until it closed_in 1978 . Like so_much of Akron ' s tire industry , it was obsolete . Unlike so many other old plants , though , this one didn ' t end_up shuttered . Goodyear instead invested $ 125 million to transform it into the company ' s flagship technical center . Now , nearly 1 # 000 engineers , scientists and others with advanced training work there designing and evaluating new tires . Goodyear has been using computer-aided_design since the 1960s , but thanks to spectacular advances in computing power during the ' 80s , specialists at the tech center can test &quot; virtual &quot; tires , even using data that emulates the suspension of a specific automobile . Sophisticated what-if analyses are suddenly possible , and custom-designed new tires can be produced in vastly less time . But don ' t expect to walk into a job there with nothing but a high_school diploma . Nowadays , practically everyone who works_at the World_War I-vintage facility has computer skills . Bill Egan , Goodyear ' s chief engineer of product design , says the building today has more computers than staff . So U.S. manufacturing didn ' t die during the ' 80s ; it merely adapted , and necessarily so . What about all_the other articles of belief about the American economy during the decade ? Rapacious corporate raiders dismembered healthy companies and destroyed jobs and communities . True , $ 1.3 trillion in corporate assets changed hands , and a lot of unpleasant people made a fortune in the process . But they did us all a favor by getting U.S. companies out of the conglomerate game , as managers recognized at last that in_order to make money you actually need to know something about the business you ' re in . Accordingly , most of the takeovers were friendly . The threat of hostile_takeover did help awaken complacent managements , and hostile_takeovers helped redeploy assets more efficiently . But they didn ' t cost many jobs . A University of Chicago study of the hostile_takeovers from 1984-86 found that only 2.5 % of the workers at acquired companies were fired . That group was disproportionately white collar -- folks whose unemployment_rate is generally low -- and total layoffs among those companies came_to only 26 # 000 . Junk_bonds and fraud brought_on the savings-and-loan crisis . The savings and loans collapsed because Uncle_Sam , in an attempt to save a dying industry , deregulated how thrifts could invest and what interest they could pay without removing the federal guarantee of deposits . The taxpayers thus took_on all_the risk . More_than 75 % of the junk-bond exposure was concentrated in only 10 thrift_institutions . On the other hand , junk_bonds funded trailblazing companies such_as MCI Communications and Turner Broadcasting . And they provided capital for aggressive newcomers to shake_up slothful corporations . If you think junk_bonds are discredited relics , consider that the face_value of junk_bonds issued in 1993 was far greater than in any year during their supposed heyday . Social spending was cut_to the bone during the ' 80s . Actually , social spending grew . Housing subsidies for the poor , for instance , steadily increased under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George_Bush . Welfare ? It didn ' t keep pace with inflation but fell_behind at a slower rate than in the ' 70s . Public education ? Even allowing_for inflation , spending per pupil rose 29 % in the ' 80s . What changed is what we expect from the schools and the kids we send them . Today ' s schools must cope_with more languages , more single-parent households , more TV and more permissive child-rearing . What changed , in other words , was us . * At this point it ' s fair to ask , if the ' 80s are so widely misunderstood , why should this be so ? Were not the machinations of Wall_Street important ? Was there no spirit of selfishness in the land ? Didn ' t Reagan matter ? The answer , of course , is yes on all counts . The Reagan_Administration , in particular , left us with staggering deficits that would have been hard to imagine previously . Yet American governments in the ' 80s had little to do with the computer , communications , biotechnology , family and personal-rights revolutions that drove domestic change during the period . The gap between rich and poor increased in most of the industrialized world during the ' 80s , although nowhere as much as in this country . The Reagan_Administration did weaken trade_unions and keep_down the minimum_wage . Federal tax_policies also contributed . Yet by far the biggest factor_in growing economic inequality was the ever-higher compensation paid_for knowledge and the poor wages paid_for physical labor , as opposed to the gains on stocks , bonds or real_estate . Why wages got more and more unequal isn ' t well understood ; the most likely culprits include changing technology ; an increasingly global economy in which goods , people and capital move more freely than ever , and changes in the work_force . Even scholars such_as Harvard ' s David M . Cutler , formerly with the President ' s Council of Economic Advisors , and Gary Burtless , at the Democratic-oriented Brookings Institution , acknowledge that this development would have arisen no matter who was President . In California , for example , fruit and vegetable farming continued to expand during the ' 80s as America ' s appetite for fresh produce grew . Yet despite the increased demand for agricultural workers , inflation-adjusted wages fell 18 % during the decade , according to Don Villarejo , executive_director of the nonprofit California Institute for Rural Studies . The United Farm_Workers ascribes the wage fallback to the pro-management stance of the state Agricultural Labor Relations Board under former Gov . George Deukmejian . But an even bigger factor was the Mexican economic restructuring of the 1980s , which sent rural migrants pouring north into the fields of California . Villarejo and others say that the number of workers just increased too fast , driving down the price of labor . Philip L . Martin , an agricultural economist at UC Davis , says flatly , &quot; The answer is illegal immigration adding_to the supply of labor and changing the wage structure. &quot; One primary reason that the ' 80s are the misunderstood decade is that the media and the intelligentsia are Democrats by affiliation and agnostic in their view of commerce . Capitalism -- the word itself seems a kind of expletive in our mouths -- makes us flinch . Its amoral nature , its emphasis on self-interest , its happy readiness to reward the unworthy , all make us squeamish . The corruption of men like Boesky and the outrageous pay of many corporate chieftains repel us . Among opinion makers , there is also a tendency toward guilt , perhaps as a result of a tenured niche funded by some merchant prince , or a consciousness that the life of the mind beats clawing out a living in a factory or office . Growth is regarded with intense suspicion , and thus the ' 80s , an era of growth , are suspect . Much of this thinking reflects a distinct remove from purposeful wealth production . Writers and other opinion-makers pay more attention to government , or more precisely , politics , magnifying its importance through a distorting lens . Michael Walzer has observed that many intellectuals on the left believe &quot; that if you get the politics right , the economics will follow. &quot; He wisely added that &quot; this is a big mistake. &quot; It would be just as great a mistake to cling_to the notion that the ' 80s were a time dominated by some greedy &quot; others. &quot; In fact , during the ' 80s we learned to accept a world in which America is more integrated into a global whole , and in which markets must be allowed to function if we are to have any hope of prosperity . We also learned , by and large , to get comfortable with our progress toward ever-greater individual freedom , whether that implies marriage between two men or boundless opportunities for moneymaking , for those so inclined . What was really so bad about the ' 80s was an excess of personal freedom . In the ' 90s , we ' ll have to recognize that the odd thing about freedom is how , at the extreme , it comes_to resemble its opposite . Think_of gridlock on the freeway : everybody free to drive but nobody able to move . The trick will be finding the courage to give_up a little individual freedom so that all_of us can be freer together -- of the consequences of neglected children , for example . That is a tall_order ; the campaign season that just ended showed how adept our political_system has become at telling us what we want to hear . What we don ' t want to hear about , especially those of us who can afford it most , is sacrifice .</TEXT>
