   <HEADLINE> TRAVEL INSIDER : BUCK_UP , AMERICA : DOLLARS BUY MORE AGAIN IN EUROPE ; CURRENCY : ITALY , SPAIN , PORTUGAL AND GREECE OFFER THE MOST VACATION FOR YOUR MONEY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Most Americans heading to Europe this year -- and the European Travel Commission predicts that there will be a record 8 million of us -- will arrive with this question hanging somewhere in their heads : How far will our money go ? The answer is far indeed , if your destination is Italy , Spain or Portugal , and if you ' re comparing this year ' s prices with those of last year and the year before that . If you ' re bound for Greece or Turkey , the dollar ' s strong exchange numbers will cheer you up . But racing inflation has been grinding_away at the drachma and the Turkish_lira , and your dollars will be left with only slightly more clout than they had last year at this time . Similarly , if you ' re bound for England , France or Germany , your 1994 dollars will carry essentially the same weight that 1993 dollars did . On the whole , travel professionals and currency traders say , Europe remains a reasonable bargain , with lingering weak economies holding_down inflation in most nations . European Union officials calculated that 12-nation group ' s combined inflation_rate at 3.3 % for the 12-month period that ended in February . Michael Wallace , a senior analyst for Ruesch International Financial Services , foresees a stronger dollar in coming months -- though as usual , jarring political developments could change that . Rolfe Shellenberger , senior consultant for travel management firm Runzheimer International , suggests that &quot; the banner year that they ' re going to have ( in Europe ) -- largely from U.S. money spent on tourism -- is going_to help them turn_around faster . I think they ' re probably at the nadir of their economic cycle right now. &quot; And as they grow , our dollars will buy less . Here ' s a quick look_at the dollar ' s prospects in several popular European destinations , all scenery and character aside . The exchange_rates quoted below come from Thomas Cook Foreign Exchange , as reported on March 25 , 1992 ; March 23 , 1993 , and March 22 , 1994 . ( Travelers should keep_in mind three important caveats . First , rates vary from one company to another . Second , you may get better rates at financial_institutions in foreign countries , rather than exchanging money in the U.S. before you leave . And third , the rates below are those available to individual travelers . Other statistics , including the tables in this newspaper ' s Business pages , instead use the rates granted to currency traders dealing in $ 1 million or more . Those rates are usually 2 % -5 % more advantageous than the rates individual travelers get. ) In England , a dollar bought 55 pence two years ago , 65 pence one year ago and 64 pence last month . Inflation ran 2.4 % in the year ended in February . Runzheimer International , which calculates per diem rates for executives using first-class hotels and restaurants , in February , 1994 , set its daily London figure at $ 315.85. ( Keep_in mind that the per diem numbers measure top-notch places in the center of principal cities -- some of the most expensive places a traveler can find in most countries. ) In France , a dollar bought 5.31 francs two years ago , 5.25 francs one year ago and 5.45 francs last month . Inflation barely existed , running 1.7 % in the year ended in February . But Paris may never be cheap . Runzheimer ' s last per diem figure there , set_in August , was $ 352.80. In Germany , Austria , Belgium , Holland , Ireland and Switzerland , fluctuations of the dollar against local currencies have been relatively minor in the last year , and inflation_rates have run at or below 3.4 % . Now to the countries that seem to offer larger bargains : * Italy . In March , 1992 , a dollar bought 1 # 178 lire . In March , 1993 : 1 # 488 lire . Last month : 1 # 570 lire . that ' s a 33 % gain over two years . And if hoteliers and restaurateurs are racing to keep their tariff cards and menu prices up with those exchange_rates , their efforts don ' t much show in the nation ' s inflation figures . Italian inflation ran 4.4 % for the year ended in February , 4.5 % for the year before that . Runzheimer cut its daily rate for Rome from $ 349.85 in August , 1992 , to $ 259.25 last August . * Spain . In March , 1992 , a dollar bought 96.6 pesetas . In March , 1993 : 107.7 pesetas . Last month : 128.1 pesetas -- another 33 % gain over two years , matching Italy . Spanish inflation ran far behind at 5 % for the year ended in February , up from 4.1 % the year before . Runzheimer , which assigned Madrid a $ 359.05 per diem figure in August , 1992 , slashed it to $ 260.60 last August . * Portugal . In March , 1992 , a dollar bought 129.87 escudos . In March , 1993 , 137.63 escudos . Last month , 158.1 escudos -- a gain of 22 % , while inflation was falling from 8 % to 6.1 % in the year ended in February . Runzheimer ' s per diem for Lisbon has fallen from $ 245.75 in February , 1993 , to $ 192.40 in February , 1994 . * Greece . In March , 1992 , a dollar bought 172 drachmas . A year later , 200 drachmas . Last month , 222 drachmas . that ' s a 29 % gain , but against inflation it ' s 11 % for the year ended in February , 14.5 % the year before . Runzheimer , which was assigning Athens visitors $ 249.35 in February , 1992 , adjusted that to $ 251.30 in February , 1993 , and $ 259.15 in February , 1994 . * Turkey . Turkey ' s economy leaves an outsider wishing everyone would just hold_still_for a moment . In March , 1992 , a dollar bought 5 # 263 Turkish_lire . In March , 1993 : 7 # 874 Turkish_lire . Last month : 19 # 231 Turkish_lire -- up 265 % in two years . Meanwhile , inflation advances at an estimated 70 % per year , neutralizing nearly all_of the gain . Runzheimer gave Istanbul a $ 221.40 per diem in February , 1992 , cut it to $ 204.95 in February , 1993 , then cut it again , ever so slightly , to $ 203.05 in February , 1994 .
