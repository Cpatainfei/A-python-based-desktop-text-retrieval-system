   <HEADLINE> APPEALS PANEL REVERSES O.C. MARITAL FRAUD VERDICT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a unique fraud case that jurists labeled &quot; Sex , Lies and Trust Agreements , &quot; an appeals court panel Thursday reversed a $ 242 # 000 damage award to an Anaheim banker who had persuaded a jury that his former wife duped him by concealing her lack of sexual passion for him . &quot; These are matters best left to advice columnists than to judges and juries , &quot; concluded three justices of the 4th District Court of Appeal , who offered some advice of_their_own to civil court judges and juries : &quot; Stay out of the bedroom. &quot; They added that &quot; courts should not be in the business of probing a suitor ' s state of mind. &quot; The panel ' s 31-page ruling was prompted by the stormy divorce proceedings of Pacific Inland Bank President Ronald Askew , 50 , and his former wife , Bonnette Askew , 46 . Using the novel strategy that his ex-wife had committed fraud , Ronald Askew sued in civil court after Bonnette Askew admitted during marriage_counseling that she had hidden her lack of sexual passion for him before and during their 11 years of marriage . Last year , in a verdict that provoked worldwide publicity , an Orange County Superior_Court jury sided with Ronald Askew , ordering Bonnette Askew to give_up her share of four jointly owned parcels of property valued at about $ 242 # 000 . Bonnette Askew left the courtroom in shock April 7 , but Thursday said she had always believed that the damage award would fail to stand_up to scrutiny . &quot; The reason that this has gone_on so_long is that he flat out wanted to destroy me . And when a person becomes obsessed , they lose all concept of proportion , &quot; said Bonnette Askew , who added that the legal battleground eventually became a high-stakes poker_game . Between the lawsuits in civil court and the legal skirmishes in family court , Bonnette Askew estimated that the couple ' s legal costs now approach $ 500 # 000 . She added that this is probably not the end of the legal war of the Askews . &quot; He ' s going_to retaliate some way , &quot; she said . &quot; He ' s already threatened me with two or three lawsuits. &quot; Ronald Askew was not available for comment Thursday . His attorney , Albert M . Graham Jr. , said he was disappointed with the appellate_court ruling but needed more time to study the opinion before deciding on a next step . Graham said Ronald Askew could appeal the decision , seek a rehearing of the issue before the same panel of appeals justices or return to family court to settle the issue of community_property . Legal experts had predicted that the verdict -- if upheld -- could have spawned copycat lawsuits , reshaping the California law that property must be split evenly upon divorce . The case sparked debate about how far the the legal_system should go_in regulating romance . The appeals court Thursday also raised concerns that such lawsuits could have played havoc with California ' s no-fault divorce system and its &quot; anti-heartbalm &quot; statutes . The laws , which date_back to the 1930s , were passed to prevent jilted lovers from using the civil courts to seek damages as a &quot; heartbalm &quot; for the pain of a broken engagement or breached promises . &quot; Words of love , passion and sexual_desire are simply unsuited to the cumbersome stricture of common_law fraud and deceit , &quot; wrote Justice David Sills in a section of the opinion entitled &quot; Sex , Lies and Trust Agreements. &quot; &quot; The idea that a judge , or jury of 12 solid citizens , can arbitrate whether an individual ' s romantic declarations are true or false , or made with intent to deceive , seems almost ridiculously wooden , &quot; Sills wrote . The Askews , who have two children ages 14 and 11 , were granted a divorce in 1992 . But in a separate civil trial , Ronald Askew claimed that four pieces of property the couple owned should not be included as community_property in their divorce settlement . Before the marriage , Ronald Askew said he pleaded for honesty , asking his bride-to-be if there was anything he should know about their relationship or future marriage . According to him , she said there was &quot; nothing &quot; he needed to know . In court , he testified that discussions followed about &quot; passion , desire or physical attraction. &quot; As the relationship started unraveling in 1991 , the couple sought marriage_counseling . Relations were so tense , Bonnette Askew remembered , that even as they were living together she said she would receive telephone_calls from her husband ' s lawyer , notifying her to provide more toilet_paper to her husband . &quot; I had him on a pedestal , &quot; she said . &quot; I catered to his every whim . When I started to branch_out and do things on my own , I started becoming more of a person again . He couldn ' t deal with it . He couldn ' t deal with the fact that I wasn ' t his little woman anymore. ' During a 1991 counseling session , Ronald Askew said , his wife revealed her lack of physical_attraction for him . It was this admission that Ronald Askew used as the basis of his fraud claim , arguing that if he had known about her apathy he would not have married her or placed the properties in both their names . In their opinion , the justices noted that Ronald Askew tried to downplay the sexual nature of his fraud complaint in the appeals process . Instead , they said , he stressed that Bonnette Askew had also made oral promises to hold some of the properties in trust for him and his children from a previous marriage -- but that the parcels would revert to his ownership on request . The justices scoffed at that &quot; post_hoc recasting &quot; of the case , saying that the essence of the lawsuit still boiled_down to accusations about love and sexual attraction . &quot; This case may be gussied_up as a fraud action , but it is still essentially a breach-of-promise suit , &quot; wrote Sills , who also noted that the state long ago established public policy barring litigation of affairs of the heart . And if that was so , the trial_judge should have dismissed the lawsuit and steered the dispute about community_property back into a family law court , according to the panel . Grace Blumberg , a UCLA law professor , praised Thursday ' s appeals court decision . Months ago , she had publicly predicted that the damage award would be struck_down . &quot; They are absolutely right and the trial_court was totally wrong , &quot; she said . &quot; I felt that the jury had made the decision on the basis of feeling aggrieved for the husband and so they were going_to punish her . This should have been handled in family court. &quot;</TEXT>
