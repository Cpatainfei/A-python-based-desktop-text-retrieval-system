   <TEXT> I was only 8 when my family left Saigon in 1975 , and I was too young to comprehend the war around me . But in the last two years , I have begun to comprehend the Vietnam_War and its aftermath in ways I had never expected . It happened by accident when I heard about Oliver Stone ' s new film on Vietnam and ended_up with a major role in it . &quot; Heaven and Earth , &quot; which opened on Christmas_Day , is based on the life of Le Ly Hayslip , born into a war-torn Vietnamese village , and the tortuous path that led her to America . Once here as a bewildered war_bride , she adapts to new in-laws and a life in San Diego . It ' s a love_story , an immigrant story and a survivor story . But , most important , it is the first Hollywood movie about the Vietnam_War from the Vietnamese perspective . Finally , moviegoers will see something other_than a grunt ' s-eye view of that conflict . For me , it was an unlikely triumph . Trained as a journalist and not as an actor , I was one of 8 # 000 Vietnamese Americans who auditioned for roles in the film as Stone ' s operation scoured the country . I was cast as Kim , a bar_girl in Da Nang and one of Le Ly ' s older sisters . On leave from The Times , I spent 2 1 / 2 months in Thailand , where not only did I and the other non-actors in the movie learn acting_on the job , but I also saw close_up the realities of a conflict I never knew personally . In character , we stood knee deep in the mud of rice_paddies and cowered while American helicopters barking bullets interrupted our work ; ran to a neighbor ' s house to witness his killing by the Viet Cong ; and argued with each other about how to deal with the violence . Yet every evening , we left the rice fields and returned to the Phang Nga Bay Resort_Hotel , where we enjoyed hot showers , ate sumptuous meals in air-conditioned dining_rooms and slept on king-size beds . All of this played havoc on my psyche . Day and night , I moved between the past and the present , war and peace , old enemies and new friends . No longer could I separate myself from the people and events I had known only intellectually . * More_than seeing how a movie was made , I learned the history of my birthplace from the Vietnamese extras who live_in Thailand and who , to my surprise , have remained loyal to Ho Chi Minh . And if ever in the past I have wavered in my opinions that communism is evil or that Washington should normalize relations with Hanoi as soon as possible , I found confirmation on this trip to Southeast_Asia . Acting_out scenes of destruction and pain helped me to fully grasp how people suffered once the Boy Scout-like Viet Minh troops turned_into bullying Viet Cong cadres . I first learned of the project two years ago in a Vietnamese-language daily newspaper published in Orange County , Nguoi Viet . The story announced open casting calls nationwide to look_for a Vietnamese woman in her late teens or early 20s for the lead role and others to play her family . The article also said the script was not yet completed . I was eager for a chance to help write the screenplay and ensure its authenticity , so I showed_up for the audition in Westminster that Dec . 14 . There , the casting people told me the movie was based on Hayslip ' s two autobiographies , &quot; When Heaven and Earth Changed Places &quot; and &quot; Child of War , Woman of Peace. &quot; The author was working closely with the director and there already were plenty of consultants , they said , but they asked me to stick_around anyway to help audition the thousands of people who had been lining_up outside since 7 a.m. It was the final casting call and I felt the magnitude and the importance of this potential movie as I watched people cry , laugh or scream their way through improvised scenes for screen_tests . My people and I needed this movie for our spiritual therapy , I realized , just as some Americans worked to understand and heal their war wounds through films such_as &quot; Apocalypse Now &quot; and &quot; Platoon. &quot; We emigres have been suppressing our sorrow and anger in the overwhelming effort to adapt in new homelands . A major motion_picture telling the story of one of us would help the rest of us vent our emotions . I decided then that I had to be involved with this film , no matter how small my job . After doing a screen_test myself at the end of that day , I bought &quot; When Heaven and Earth Changed Places &quot; and read it for the first time . * Before starting the novel , I was concerned that the story would stress again only the negatives of Vietnam in the American psyche . Hollywood movies about the war usually show peasants , prostitutes and bombed-out villages . Where are the courageous South Vietnamese soldiers , the handsome school buildings and the glorious flower markets of my youth in Saigon ? But the book went behind the scenes of those stereotypes . It told of a village in the middle ground of a battle having to buckle_under two masters , a once tight-knit family being scattered by violence and a young , helpless woman with no skills resorting_to the underworld to support an infant son and ailing parents . Hayslip ' s story was the age-old tale of what one has to sacrifice not to drown under the waves of upheaval . And I wanted to help tell the story to anyone who wished to judge her decisions -- just as I had judged her before reading her words . So I was excited when the casting people called me back in spring , 1992 , for more tests . They wanted me to read for Kim , who becomes a bar_girl after leaving her village . I didn ' t like that character , because she was cruel in the book . I changed my mind , however , after reading how Stone explained Kim in his script . He stressed that she was born with a harelip , was spurned by other villagers and other family members and was jealous of Hayslip when they were growing_up . This buried resentment culminated in Kim ' s big scene , in which she behaves badly to her father and has to confront him and Hayslip . Kim ' s lines of anguish in these arguments really inspired my meager acting abilities during the later auditions . In one of the first days on the set_in Thailand , I was walking_around the village built especially for the movie and wearing a prosthetic harelip glued on my mouth , when I saw two girls pointing at me and giggling . I looked closer at their faces , one 7 and the other 11 , and had to laugh because their mouths also had fake scars . They did not speak English , but a translator confirmed that they were to play Kim at different stages of her childhood . I was surprised to learn that their parents are Vietnamese and that the girls were born in a northeastern town of Thailand , near Vietnam ' s border . I assumed that their families had emigrated there since 1975 , after communists took_over Saigon . But I was wrong . Several days later , the cast was in the Phung family home to practice such chores as shifting rice grains in baskets . As the Vietnamese Thais taught us , the older ones recounted their lives . Their families had slaved for the Japanese when they controlled Vietnam during World_War_II , one man said . When the Japanese lost World_War_II in 1945 , French colonists tried to regain the power they once had in Vietnam . In doing so , the_French persecuted followers of Ho Chi Minh , who was trying to force_out all foreign rulers and had the loyalty of many villages in the central region . &quot; Uncle Ho , &quot; a woman said , persuaded the Thai government to let his people relocate to Thailand . Thousands of families then walked through forests and over mountains from central Vietnam in the early 1950s . On the way , many died of starvation or from eating sand out of desperation , another woman told us . Others said the Thai government had never allowed them citizenship or land ownership . And their children did not have the luxury of education beyond elementary_school . But they still pray to Ho Chi Minh at their altars for having saved them . * Someone asked the women to sing for us , so several stood_up and sang of homesickness while they swung their arms rhythmically as if rowing a boat . Their songs added_to my distress . We see things so differently , I thought to myself . My parents emigrated from North Vietnam to South Vietnam to escape communism in 1955 , only to flee from that regime again 20 years later to the United States . I remembered my father saying that he had hoped that Ho Chi Minh would save Vietnam for Vietnamese rule but that the man ' s communist ways also had oppressed our people and had shattered my father ' s illusions . Then there are my relatives and other Vietnamese immigrants I have interviewed as a reporter . I ' ve heard their testimonies of living under the communist government . Many had been imprisoned , starved into submission , deprived of religious freedom . To me , Ho Chi Minh remains a bogyman . To these people in front of me , he was a savior . On the set , I was reminded of what nightmares Ho Chi Minh ' s forces could be . One night was particularly unforgettable . The cast had walked onto the central courtyard to film a scene in which the Viet Minh soldiers changed from their idealist one-with-the-village behavior to the menacing attitudes of the Viet Cong . After killing a teacher , the soldiers in black uniforms were setting fire to buildings and fanatically dancing around the bonfires as a warning of more punishment if the whole village did not obey orders . I knew the destroyers around me were only extras acting , but my face involuntarily twisted in pain and my eyes welled_up with tears . I truly feared for my safety . Outsiders , including city dwellers like my family , did not understand until too late what the Viet Cong were doing at the root of their extensive spy network : scaring many peasants into allegiance . Even after the Phung family had two sons fighting for the Viet Cong , its officers still raped the youngest child , Le Ly , and later threatened to kill her mother . * I ' ve been frustrated for years at books such_as Frances FitzGerald ' s &quot; Fire in the Lake , &quot; which seemed sympathetic to the Viet Cong as supposed rescuers of my birthplace from foreign invaders . But now the Viet Cong government is in Vietnam and I ' m here in the United States , where Hayslip still is considered by many in the Vietnamese American community to be a communist . The reasons they cite are that she once served in a Viet Cong cadre and that her nonprofit group East Meets West builds hospitals in Vietnam because she works tightly with the current regime . This same group is also anti-normalization because it believes that helping the communist government will encourage it to continue to restrict human_rights . that ' s not the picture I got when I returned to Saigon this time last year , after filming in Thailand was done . Since we were already in the country next door , I went_to the place renamed Ho Chi Minh City . Relatives there told how life has improved in the last five years as trade ties with other countries have improved . They now can listen to Voice of America on the radio without being punished . They actually have money to fix_up their homes instead of worrying about the next meal . And to attract tourists and businesses , the government has renovated buildings , allowed women and girls to wear again the traditional dress ao dai ( which communists once banned because it was bourgeois ) and invited international phone_companies in to hook_up communication lines with the rest of the world . But what was sweetest to me was that the word Saigon is printed on all postcards next to Ho Chi Minh City . I felt I had lived two lifetimes . For the movie , there was the hell created by war . Then I visited what that hell has become . Although there still are problems and restrictions in Vietnam , what I saw was a promise of what could be if the nation were given a chance . Others might not trust Hayslip , but I like how she ranks the welfare of the Vietnamese people over politics . It ' s only by working together with our former enemies that wars are won .</TEXT>
