   <HEADLINE> PANEL MAY HOLD KEY TO CONSENSUS ON IMMIGRATION ; BORDER : FEDERAL COMMISSION IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON HOW POLICY IS FORMED DURING THE NEXT TWO YEARS . EX-REP . BARBARA JORDAN IS CHAIRWOMAN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As opposing camps in the national immigration debate exchange rhetorical grenades , a federal commission is quietly fashioning a set of recommendations that could provide the basis for bipartisan agreement on some of the issue ' s most contentious elements . The report being compiled by the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform is expected to have a significant impact on how immigration policy is formed during the next two years , Administration sources said . The report is_due in September . With a diverse cast of eight commissioners and former Texas Rep . Barbara C . Jordan as its forceful chairwoman , the commission is expected to chart politically defensible positions on such difficult issues as border control and public assistance benefits to immigrants -- both legal and illegal . In recent Senate testimony , Doris Meissner , commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service , said Congress should wait to see the report before making legislative changes on its own . The group ' s suggestions will also be required reading at the White_House as the Clinton_Administration ponders its next immigration initiative . &quot; I have received every indication from anyone I ' ve spoken with ( in the White_House ) that our report will get serious and careful attention , &quot; said Jordan , whose probity and mellifluous speaking voice brought her fame during the Watergate era . Carol Rasco , Clinton ' s domestic policy adviser , said that White_House staffers have maintained close contact with Jordan , attended many of the commission ' s hearings and are familiar_with how the panel is leaning_on particular issues . &quot; We consider it an important process , &quot; Rasco said . &quot; ( The report ) certainly has the potential to serve as a basis &quot; for White_House initiatives on immigration , she said . The White_House has its own interagency group looking_at many of the same issues , but Susan Martin , the commission ' s executive_director , said that the two reports would probably be in_harmony . Jordan has said she hopes that the commission ' s recommendations will help dissipate some of the nastiness that now suffuses the debate . Some politicians , such_as Gov . Pete Wilson , have seized_on the anger and resentment many Californians feel toward illegal immigrants . The Republican governor , who is running_for reelection , has proposed a constitutional amendment to deny automatic citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants . He also has sued the federal_government to recover the money California spends on health_care and the incarceration of illegal immigrants . &quot; Among commission members , immigration is seen as having more of a positive impact than negative , &quot; Jordan said . &quot; I believe quite firmly that the negatives are overblown and without basis in fact . I am fairly certain that the commission is not going_to come_out with a report that feeds into the emotionalism over the issue. &quot; Jordan said Wilson ' s aggressive stand is &quot; wrong-headed . . . and ( it is ) not helpful to use immigration as a scapegoat for a myriad of issues. &quot; But on key points , Jordan and Wilson appear to be in_accord . &quot; Illegal immigrants are not entitled to benefits , &quot; she said . Jordan also shares Wilson ' s view that much of California ' s immigration woe is caused by inadequate enforcement of federal laws . &quot; It is the federal_government ' s responsibility to enforce the border . . . and it is wrong in issuing mandates for state and local_governments that the federal_government refuses to fund , &quot; Jordan said . &quot; That creates the animus and spawns the lawsuits. &quot; Jordan knows that in_order to be effective , the commission can ' t dodge taking a stand on controversial issues . &quot; I do not know that we will reach majority agreement on every issue . . . but I ' ve become much more optimistic that we could forge a consensus around some of the difficult issues . ( It would be ) foolish to sacrifice our credibility by filing dissents . It would be better to be silent on an issue , &quot; said Jordan , who was appointed chairwoman by President Clinton in December . The commission was established by Congress as part of the 1990 Immigration Act to examine the effects of national immigration policies . During the past year it has held hearings around the country and visited Los Angeles in December . Two reports will be issued -- an interim report in September and a final report in 1997 . The commission ' s final report will focus_on more global themes -- effects on economic_systems , international trade_policy and population issues -- Martin said . The commission members -- four Republican and four Democrat appointees -- hold differing points_of_view on many immigration issues . But a source with knowledge of the commission ' s internal debates said that Jordan has been remarkably successful in forging consensus on a number of tricky issues by cutting_through statistical disputes and focusing_on the core issue . Lawrence H . Fuchs , one of the commission ' s two vice_chairmen , was executive_director of the last federal panel to tackle immigration . That commission , chaired by the Rev . Theodore M . Hesburgh , submitted its report to Congress in 1981 and provided the intellectual underpinning for major immigration legislation in 1986 and 1990 . The Democratic appointees are Fuchs , a professor at Brandeis University ; Warren R . Leiden , executive_director of the American Immigration Lawyers Assn. ; Nelson Merced , a former Massachusetts state legislator , and Bruce Morrison , a former congressman who played a key role in the passage of the 1990 immigration law . Michael S . Teitelbaum , a demographer , is the other vice_chairman . He is joined by Republican appointees Richard Estrada , an editorial writer for the Dallas Morning News ; Harold Ezell , the former western regional commissioner of the INS under Ronald Reagan , and Robert Charles Hill , a lawyer and Reagan-era Justice_Department official . Jordan is scheduled to testify before Sen . Edward M . Kennedy ' s immigration subcommittee later this month to brief lawmakers on the commission ' s progress .</TEXT>
