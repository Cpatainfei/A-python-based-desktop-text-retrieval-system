   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : YOUR MONEY ; MONEY FUNDS FACE NEW WOES OVER DERIVATIVES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The problems apparently are not yet over for money_market mutual_funds that invested in so-called derivative securities , and at least one affected fund may be searching among its peers for a bailout . Sources at the Investment_Company Institute , the Washington-based trade group for mutual_funds , say that several money funds have contacted the ICI since July 1 &quot; asking_for advice on how to handle their problems &quot; related to derivatives . In addition , one money fund &quot; asked_for suggestions on others that might be interested in acquiring it , &quot; an ICI official said . The likelihood of a new round of losses in supposedly &quot; safe &quot; money_market funds may come as a shock to the public , industry observers worry . A handful of money funds announced derivative-related problems in June , but the sponsors of those funds were large enough to quickly cover the losses without hurting shareholders . The industry ' s great fear is that a money fund will be forced to mark_down its per-share value from the standard $ 1 level , because of an unexpected decline in the underlying value of the fund ' s securities . That could set_off a nationwide chain_reaction among money-fund shareholders , who might begin to doubt the security of their investment . Money fund assets now total $ 595 billion , and the ICI estimates that Americans have more_than 21 million money-fund accounts . Traditionally , money funds have invested only in extremely safe , short-term , debt_instruments of the U.S._government , major banks or large corporations . Because most of the securities mature within a period of months , they fluctuate little in value -- which allows the money funds to maintain a stable asset value of $ 1 a share under normal circumstances . That share-price stability , as opposed to the fluctuating share prices of stock and bond funds , has been a hallmark of money funds since they were introduced in the mid-1970s . Yet in_effect , money funds ' stability has created a perception problem for the industry : Most shareholders believe they can ' t lose in a money fund , even though the funds don ' t guarantee that . Now , the emergence of derivative securities as investments has changed the risk equation for some money funds and for mutual_funds in_general . Derivatives are securities whose value or returns often are tied to , or derived from , financial market trends rather than the fortunes of the particular issuer . In 1993 , as conventional money-market security yields hovered at 30-year lows , Wall_Street brokerages dangled a number of money-market derivatives before money fund managers , usually offering above-average yields . The catch_on most of the derivatives was that their value would plummet if market interest_rates began to move_up sharply again . Because few money managers expected a surge in rates this year , derivatives in 1993 and early this year appeared to offer a reasonable bet to some money-fund managers who were trying to juice-up their dismally low yields . Since the Federal_Reserve_Board began to push market rates higher in February , however , the result has been havoc in the bond market , and particularly in the market for derivatives . In the spring , a long line of companies , and a handful of bond mutual_funds , announced that they had suffered major losses on derivative bets that went awry as interest_rates jumped . Few money_market funds , in contrast , publicly admitted to derivative losses in the spring , though a number of funds are believed to have quietly covered small losses without fanfare . The worst disaster was at two of BankAmerica Corp. ' s Pacific Horizon money funds . BofA was forced to infuse a total of $ 68 million to make_up for derivative losses that otherwise might have caused the funds ' share prices to fall below the $ 1 level . * Now , however , more money funds are expected to announce that they must realize losses on their portfolios because of derivative securities held since winter or spring . Though the number of funds with derivative-related problems is believed to be small , any publicity generated nonetheless could affect all money funds . &quot; In the fund industry , everyone suffers from the failures of the few , &quot; notes Don Phillips , a principal at fund-tracker Morningstar Inc. in Chicago . The new round of derivative-security loss disclosures may result directly from a warning issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission to money funds on June 30 . The SEC told the funds to get_rid_of derivatives that don ' t fit the parameters the agency has previously laid_out for &quot; safe &quot; money fund investments . Though the SEC wants the funds to divest those securities in an &quot; orderly &quot; manner , there may be no alternative for some of the funds but to take a loss by selling the derivatives , some analysts say . And that is raising the question of whether the sponsors of the newly troubled funds are willing or able to cover the losses , as BofA did -- or whether these funds will force shareholders to accept the loss by devaluing their share price from $ 1 to 99 cents or less . That the ICI admits at least one money fund is actively seeking an acquirer suggests that the sponsor of that fund may_not have the resources to cover its losses by itself . Thus , the ICI may face a crisis it has long feared : Whether to let a money fund &quot; break &quot; the $ 1-a-share level , or whether to organize an industry-wide bailout of the fund . An ICI spokesman said Thursday that discussion of an ICI-organized bailout of troubled money funds &quot; is not underway. &quot; He also said that the group has no formal policy on the bailout question . The issue poses a true dilemma for the industry . Forcing shareholders of one fund to eat a loss could cause a ripple effect , fueling unwarranted concerns about other money funds ' stability . On the other hand , with the full extent of derivative problems in money funds and other mutual_funds still unclear , an industry bailout of one fund would set a dangerous precedent . As one industry executive put it , &quot; We don ' t know how many other beggars are at the door. &quot; Fund Flows Stay Down : In other mutual_fund news , the ICI reported Thursday that investor demand for stock and bond funds remained relatively depressed in June , reflecting jitters about the markets ' next moves . Net new cash flow -- a measure of the net amount_of_money entering the funds , after accounting_for redemptions and exchanges among funds -- was a negative $ 1.7 billion for bond funds , and a positive $ 7.7 billion for stock funds . In July , many fund companies say stock fund inflows improved somewhat -- especially for international funds -- while bond funds continued to experience outflows , though at a modest pace . Fund Cash Flows Investors are still pulling money out of bond mutual_funds , on balance , but stock funds are continuing to attract new money , though at a slower pace . Net , new cash flow into stock and bond funds , monthly in 1994 , in billions of dollars : STOCK FUNDS , June , 1994 : $ 7.7 BOND FUNDS , June , 1994 : - $ 1.7 Source : Investment_Company Institute .</TEXT>
