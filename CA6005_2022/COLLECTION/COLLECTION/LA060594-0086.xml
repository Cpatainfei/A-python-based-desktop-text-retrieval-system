   <HEADLINE> BANKER FOUND GUILTY IN DRUG MONEY CASE ; BEVERLY HILLS : TEXAS JURY CONVICTS A SENIOR OFFICER OF AMERICAN EXPRESS BANK INTERNATIONAL AND HIS ASSISTANT OF LAUNDERING $ 30 MILLION FOR A MEXICAN COCAINE KINGPIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Antonio Giraldi , whose Beverly Hills office looked more like a boutique than an international bank , thrived in a world far removed from that of drug dealers and their bags stuffed with cash . But a federal jury in Brownsville , Tex. , on Thursday connected those two worlds , finding him guilty of laundering $ 30 million for a drug organization headed by Juan Garcia Abrego of Mexico . &quot; This case is a good_example of how a bank officer legitimized a drug dealer , &quot; Assistant U.S. Atty . David Novak said . Giraldi , a boyish-looking senior officer for American Express Bank International , lowered his head as U.S. marshals escorted him in handcuffs out of the courtroom . Jurors found him guilty on all charges : conspiracy , 10 counts of money_laundering , two counts of bank fraud and four counts of misapplication of funds . Giraldi ' s former assistant , Lourdes Reategui , 46 , was found guilty of conspiracy , one count of bank fraud and four counts of misapplication of funds . She was acquitted of the 10 money_laundering counts and a second bank fraud count . U.S. District Judge Filemon Vela ordered Giraldi held_on a $ 1-million cash bond until sentencing , which was scheduled for Aug . 12 . Bond for Reategui was set at $ 500 # 000 . Giraldi is a senior_vice_president in the bank ' s Miami office . He worked in the bank ' s posh branch in Beverly Hills when many of the transactions occurred . Reategui , Giraldi ' s assistant in Beverly Hills , now works for a Los Angeles real_estate company . As the jury deliberated for over three days , Giraldi , 37 , had paced the hallways , often patting reporters on the back , and making small_talk about his hopes to return to work and take a mountain biking vacation . Instead , Giraldi probably faces at least a decade in a federal prison , depending_on federal sentencing guidelines and on Vela . &quot; I cannot fathom how we arrived here , &quot; said Giraldi ' s attorney , Christopher Milner . &quot; I think the basis for an appeal is clearly in the record based on the dearth of the evidence ( against Giraldi ) . &quot; Reategui ' s attorney , Robert Turner , called the verdict inconsistent . &quot; The jury has decided that my client is guilty of conspiracy and not_guilty of the money_laundering . You figure it out , &quot; he said . Simon Barker-Benfield , a spokesman for American Express in New York , said : &quot; We ' re greatly disappointed by the verdict . But we do emphasize that the bank does have a strict policy against doing business with clients engaged in criminal activities. &quot; The three-week trial , watched closely by international banks , focused_on the relationship between bank officers and their wealthy , often secretive clients . Defense_attorneys , whose fees were paid by American Express , contended that their clients had no reason to suspect that they were handling tainted money . But prosecutors charged that Giraldi and Reategui intentionally schemed and lied_in bank records to make their biggest client , Ricardo Aguirre Villagomez , appear to be a legitimate businessman . The government alleges that Aguirre , a gas_station manager in Matamoros , Mexico , was handling millions of dollars for Abrego . Abrego is the reputed head of a drug empire in northeastern Mexico that , according to federal_agents , imports hundreds of tons of Colombian cocaine into the United States each year and generates more_than $ 20 billion in sales . U.S. Customs Special_Agent Vincent Iglio began the complex investigation in 1989 when he and other agents noticed couriers hauling duffel_bags stuffed with cash from a Mexican exchange house to a bank in McAllen , Tex . A Customs-led task_force followed the money to accounts_for Aguirre in Switzerland , then to Aguirre-controlled holding_companies in the Cayman Islands . The investigators then found the money reinvested in apparently legitimate businesses in the United States and Mexico .</TEXT>
