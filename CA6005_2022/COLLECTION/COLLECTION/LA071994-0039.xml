   <HEADLINE> THE WEEK AHEAD : WASHINGTON ; OUT OF THE SHADOWS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The longest-running &quot; secret diplomacy &quot; in the Middle_East comes_in from the shadows Monday when Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin of Israel and King Hussein of Jordan meet at the White_House for talks that President Clinton says will usher_in a &quot; new era &quot; of regional peacemaking . For most of the last three decades , Hussein has met with a succession of Israeli prime_ministers and foreign_ministers to keep a lid on the simmering hostility across the longest Arab-Israeli border.But neither side publicly acknowledged the contacts . Although U.S. officials do not expect Monday ' s meeting to lead directly to an Israel-Jordan peace_treaty , the talks_show that Hussein is prepared to move ahead in relations with Israel even if that angers Syrian President Hafez Assad , who is left isolated in his hard-line animosity toward the Israeli government . Washington was the site of last year ' s milestone in the Middle_East peace process , the peace agreement signed by Rabin and Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat on the lawn of the White_House .</TEXT>
