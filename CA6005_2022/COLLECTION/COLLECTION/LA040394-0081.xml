   <HEADLINE> WEST HOLLYWOOD COUNCIL RACE OFFERS FEW FIREWORKS ; ELECTIONS : THE USUAL HUBBUB IS ABSENT FROM THIS YEAR ' S CONTEST AS 11 CANDIDATES VIE FOR THREE SEATS . MOST OF THE HOPEFULS TARGET CRIME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Take a wide-open race for the West Hollywood City_Council . Toss_in enough candidates to field a football_team . Aim the spotlight on crime issues and what do you get ? A campaign so stunningly drab , it ' s hard to tell everyone apart . With three of the council ' s five seats up for grabs , most people expected a bruising , high-stakes affair . All of the candidates are men . And all but one of the 11 hopefuls is gay , providing the chance for the council ' s first gay majority since 1986 . Already , however , the race is remarkable for another reason . &quot; It ' s probably the dullest City_Council race we ' ll ever have , unless something happens ( by_Election Day ) , &quot; said Councilman Paul Koretz , who is not up for reelection this year but is seeking a state Assembly seat . The unexpected calm probably will help the two incumbents , John Heilman and Sal Guarriello , since voters may already know their names before the April 12 vote . Councilwoman Babette Lang decided not to seek another four-year term , ensuring the council will gain at least one new member . Candidates say a shortage of cash to pay_for mailers has dampened the race in a town where elections often get_down and dirty . Causes dear to many voters -- such_as rent control and gay rights -- face no local challenge ; battles over those issues are being waged at the state and federal levels . Recession has smothered debate about development , and the controversial idea of forming a city police_department is expected to go directly to voters this fall . The vacuum has been filled somewhat by an urgent focus_on crime , a first for the 10-year-old city . Though figures show no marked increase in crime in West Hollywood , most of the candidates have jumped_on the anti-crime bandwagon , calling_for more policing while offering few details on how to pay_for it . The crime issue is a kind of Rorschach test in West Hollywood , with vastly different audiences at_work . Crime means street hustlers and drug-dealing to residents of the depressed East End , burglaries and car thefts to homeowners across town and bigoted attacks on gays and lesbians all_over . Challenger Timothy P . Olson , a leader of an unsuccessful 1992 ballot initiative to create a city police_force , has hammered the crime theme hardest . Citing FBI figures , he asserts that on a per capita basis , West Hollywood is one of the five most dangerous cities in California . Per capita crime statistics , however , are criticized as misleading in small tourist meccas such_as West Hollywood because they do not account_for the large_number of visitors . In one of the campaign ' s first direct attacks , a group supporting Olson mailed a campaign flyer last week charging that the Heilman-led council majority had made big cuts_in the portion of the city ' s budget slated for public safety . City officials dispute that , saying the dip is far less than Olson claims and resulted from the city ' s decision two years ago to reassign parking enforcement to a private company . Steve Martin , a gay-rights activist who sits on the city ' s rent board , has proposed spending up_to $ 1 million more to boost patrols by the Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department , which now provides law_enforcement to the city under an $ 8.5 million-a-year contract . Campaign forums have produced a chorus of similar-sounding calls_for more foot and bicycle patrols and for a new substation on the East End . The field is about evenly split on whether to create an independent police_force . Despite the rhetoric , FBI statistics for West Hollywood indicate a 6 % drop_in serious crime -- from 4 # 532 cases to 4 # 254 -- since 1986 , the first year for which city figures are available . Totals for the most violent crimes fluctuated the past three years : 4 # 083 in 1990 ; 4 # 712 in 1991 ; and 4 # 264 in 1992 . Six people were murdered in 1992 , the last year homicide statistics were available . West Hollywood mirrors an ironic national trend -- sinking crime figures accompanied by growing panic that streets are unsafe . That perception may be made worse in West Hollywood by street prostitution that occurs nightly in public view . &quot; People really are more afraid , &quot; said City_Manager Paul Brotzman . &quot; Is it reflective of the circumstances on the street ? No . But people really feel it. &quot; Crime may resonate , but it hasn ' t sparked a debate that would help overwhelmed West Hollywood voters weed through all_the candidates . &quot; If I were a voter , I ' d be confused , &quot; said Koretz , who is undecided . &quot; In fact , I am a voter and I am confused. &quot; Heilman -- the council ' s only gay member and its only member to have served since cityhood -- has emphasized the city ' s trailblazing record in social_services . His campaign is closest to a referendum on City_Hall itself . A law professor , Heilman is also a walking directory of city programs and policies , ticking them off at debates ( he was the only candidate who knew the city has a law against car alarms that disturb residents ) . Though targeted by a failed recall attempt in 1991 , few hard shots have come Heilman ' s way this campaign . As in the past , Heilman is endorsed by the Coalition for Economic Survival , a renter ' s rights group whose support has been tantamount_to winning office in West Hollywood . Guarriello , the campaign ' s only heterosexual , is trying to capitalize on being the only senior in the field -- he ' s 74 -- and on his maverick role on the council . His gruff outsider ' s approach to city government often leaves him at_odds with the Heilman-led council majority , though Guarriello managed to crack it last year in blocking a utility tax and special business levy . Four challengers are trying to reap votes from their past involvement in local politics -- from inside and outside City_Hall . Attorney Jeff Richmond , who heads the city ' s planning_commission , is Heilman ' s running mate and the only challenger to get the Coalition for Economic Survival endorsement . He has run almost as an incumbent , endorsing and defending the city ' s liberal programs , and is the only candidate from the East End , where many residents have felt ignored by the city . Martin represented the city ' s political Establishment as a leading opponent of police initiative , but he has clashed with the council majority in the past by opposing a business tax and the proposed construction of a civic_center in West Hollywood Park . Martin , Olson and activist Michael W . Radcliffe sound parallel themes -- crime , City_Hall spending and the need for a friendlier business climate . Olson , a fund-raiser for Aid for AIDS , a local AIDS assistance group , got his start in city politics pushing the police_department measure , though he has played_down the idea during debates and instead emphasized the immediate need for more sheriff deputies . Still , he is banking on the votes of those who favored the police measure . Radcliffe , the sole Republican in the race , is the candidate City_Hall most hopes will lose . He has spent years criticizing and infuriating city administrators and council_members on business issues as head of the West Hollywood Community Alliance , a rival to the city ' s Chamber_of_Commerce . Of four political newcomers , Christopher Patrouch , a shopkeeper and former city transportation planner , boasts the quirkiest platform : Get_rid_of cars . Patrouch , who rode a bicycle cross-country when he moved here from New York in 1990 , has proposed taxing valet parking and suggested the city consider a rush-hour fee on lone drivers . Burton Cutler , a transportation consultant , wants the city to take_over the local library , a county facility open only three days a week because of funding shortages . Daniel Kovatch , an insurance sales supervisor who said he wants a career in politics , has underlined the need for more business . Christopher S . Dietrich , a writer and legal clerk , supports strong animal protections and proposes a city film festival . Steven S . Chapman is_on the ballot , but suspended his campaign .</TEXT>
