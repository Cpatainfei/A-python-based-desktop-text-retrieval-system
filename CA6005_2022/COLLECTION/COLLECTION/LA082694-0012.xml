   <HEADLINE> METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF : LOS ANGELES ; APPEALS COURT REJECTS CHALLENGE TO SMOKING BAN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The state Court of Appeal has rejected a tobacco-industry-sponsored challenge to the city of Los Angeles ' ban on smoking in restaurants . The court ' s 2nd Appellate District ruled Thursday that Section 339 of the City Election Code -- which invalidates petition signatures gathered by people who are not residents and registered voters within the city -- does not violate constitutionally guaranteed rights of free speech . The city clerk ' s office ruled previously that , based on a 5 % sample of signatures , pro-smoking forces had not gathered enough names to put a referendum invalidating the ban on the ballot . The referendum ' s backers argued that they had been unconstitutionally restricted to using petition circulators who were registered voters in the city . A Superior_Court judge agreed , but the appellate_court reversed his decision . The ban remained in_effect throughout the litigation .</TEXT>
