   <HEADLINE> BEHIND THE WHEEL : IT ' S PURE ITALIAN GLORY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Home building can be a quick ticket to riches if the competition is producing nothing cozier than Hearst Castle or friendlier than Death Row . Such appears to be the happy future for Ferrari . For the only nocturnal fantasies opposing the pace , price and chest-thumping vanity of Ferrari ' s new 456GT coupe are Lamborghini ' s fearsome Diablo and the brazen Bugatti EB110 . All play_at or beyond 200 m.p.h. Each is an instant collectible with a six-figure sticker . These are racers in street clothing and the most prestigious of production super-cars . But driving a Diablo is a neck-cricking , back-aching , ear-shattering exercise in self-flagellation . It is difficult to reverse the car without a papal blessing and two fender-walkers . Any journey exceeding 30 minutes should be considered a human_rights violation . The Bugatti offers only tiny seats for the vertically challenged , maybe retired jockeys with $ 350 # 000 to invest in an exotic that has no connection to a storied past beyond recent purchase of the name . Yet this 456GT -- the first all-new Ferrari since Enzo himself went_out of production -- is a pure Italian glory . For lyricism and classical substance it should be set alongside Pavarotti and Buitoni pasta . The machine also represents another attempt at a brave change_of_direction for Ferrari : a move from slightly primitive , maschio two-seaters to a softer , larger touring car that can be driven without wrestling harsh mechanicals and ducking spray from its flared nostrils . The dark side is that this Ferrari may_not earn deafening praise from purists , whose enthusiasm has been known to include prancing stallions on red pajamas . The 456GT , for heaven ' s sake , comes_with such delicate touches as speed-sensitive power_steering and anti-lock brakes . The suspension is adjustable from inside the car -- sport , intermediate and touring settings -- and none will threaten cheap bridgework . There are two air_bags . It is possible to shift gears without looking down . And if the big aluminum knob and chrome shift gate still represent too_much manual_labor , the 456GT can be ordered with automatic_transmission . That rumbling and groaning you hear is not from Vesuvius , but from whichever end of eternity is now home to Enzo Ferrari . The 456GT is a 2 + 2 coupe , which means two occasional seats behind driver and co-pilot . They are shaped well , but smaller than adult requirements . La dolce vita is likely to disappear on long trips from Venice to Sicily . Ferrari , of course , hasn ' t had too_much luck with its larger four-seaters , in particular the V-8 Dino of the ' 70s and the V-8 Mondiale of the ' 80s . The biggest problem was an engine mounted amidships . It upset balance while overheating the lower portions of rear seat passengers . &quot; So one importance of the 456GT is being a four-place car with the engine mounted in the front , &quot; says Gian Luigi Buitoni , president and CEO of Ferrari North_America . &quot; Also , the car represents Ferrari ' s return to the tradition of a V-12 engine , which we haven ' t done since Daytona in the ' 70s. &quot; The car also is part of a post-recession , post-Enzo re-engineering of Ferrari with deliberate expansion of the lineup to offer different cars to a broader buyer base . So is this why the 456GT comes_in grays , greens , blues and silvers and will be sold with automatic_transmission in apparent defiance of the scarlet and manual traditions of Ferrari ? &quot; Absolutely , &quot; says Buitoni . Buitoni was in Northern California recently presiding at the morning opening of Ferrari of San Francisco in Mill Valley . He took the rest of the day_off to play with close friends , potential customers and a pearl-gray prototype 456GT at nearby Sears Point Raceway . The car is softer , rounder , and at_rest appears to be at absolute peace . There are cooling ducts on the hood and sides to suck hot_air from the engine and front brakes -- but no sharp vanes suggestive_of Testarossa testosterone . Shoulders are wide , the stance low -- but major curved surfaces show character lines put there by sculptor Pininfarina to set the gran tourismo look of long distances covered in a great hurry . Glances in passing will not immediately identify the 456GT as a Ferrari . In its rounded bustle and sloping hood there appear hints of another 2 + 2 : Porsche ' s 928GT . Longer looks , however , will notice its touch of menace , the egg-crate grille , four exhaust_pipes peeking from the rear skirt , the double clusters of rear_lights and black prancing horses in yellow badges on hubs and hood that belong_to no other legend than Ferrari . Another Ferrari tradition is prices guaranteed to produce gasps . At $ 207 # 000 the 456GT might create seizures . Possibly the only way to rationalize it is by knowing that only four dozen 456GTs a year will be shipped to this country and exclusivity never comes cheap . Conversely , you could buy a dozen Jeep Wranglers for the same price . Or a condo in Fort Lauderdale . The car has a two-word interior . Simple . Elegant . On one hand . . . it ' s as though nothing has changed since the ' 40s and the first Ferraris . Two large analog dials sit dead ahead , tachometer and speedometer to deliver instant information on road speed and engine efficiency , which become cardinal when touring grandly . Secondary gauges -- fuel , clock , oil_pressure , water and oil temperatures -- are centrally mounted , in a line , with vital signs constantly feeding a driver ' s right eyeball . The overview is an interior that is clean and ageless and will never tire its viewer . On the other hand . . . with automatic air conditioning and remote releases for fuel and trunk , these insides are as modern as tomorrow . Seats , front and back , are upholstered in Connolly leather . For the first time in Ferrari history , a sound_system comes_with the car . The trunk contains a five-piece matching set of pigskin luggage , embossed with the car ' s model number . And if this sounds just too cuddly and suburban for Ferrari , key the ignition , blip the throttle and shiver to the old opera that is a 12-cylinder exhaust ripping from alto to soprano . Dual personalities are at_work here . On U.S. 101 , moving smartly from Mill Valley to Sears Point , throwing down no gantlet to accompanying traffic , the 456GT purrs and prowls . There is no tugging , so familiar to Ferraris , when leaving one gear for the next . The power assist allows steering by hand and wrist , not both shoulders and body_weight . Occasionally , you shift down . Then roll in just enough right foot to make needles leap and the engine note change from growl to bark . Just to make_sure the V-12 isn ' t taking a nap . On its softer side , if it weren ' t for the slight tautness of ride , if not for the car ' s sense of untapped might , this could be a Lexus SC400 . Nah . The 456GT is a devil in waiting , eager for the mild treachery that is any length or turn of Sears Point with its adverse cambers and decreasing radii . The car is not designed for this kind of thrashing . But it ' s a Ferrari . Pur sang prevails . It ' s in_suspension geometry , nicely weighted steering , a tubular steel chassis and aluminum body panels , a 456-horsepower V-12 spinning six forward gears , and an underside flap that changes pitch to reduce rear-end lift once the car reaches 75 m.p.h. None is a unique setup . But each system is honed to world standards in a Ferrari as its legacy of a half-century of competition wherever cars are driven_in anger . So the 456GT made Sears Point its playground . It wasn ' t geared for the wriggling circuit . Suspension was_on the soft side and the tail prone to twitch naughtily in corners . But it accelerates from rest to 100 m.p.h. in a wink over 12 seconds , incredible for a two-ton road car . On the short pit straight , inches before hard braking on Testarossa discs and downshifting twice for the hairpin , the 456GT is nibbling 140 m.p.h. while lounging in fourth gear . This is a virtuous , balanced , stable car that comes_to a halt as briskly as it moves_into the next county . It is capable of committing enormous interstate illegalities , but is equally happy on Sunday ambles to Ojai . Such qualities make this four-place adrenaline stirrer quite the most civilized car ever to come from Ferrari . And the 456GT is available as we drool . But hurry . Ferrari of Beverly Hills and Ogner Ferrari in Woodland Hills will be closed Christmas_Eve . ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) 1995 FERRARI 456GT Base Price : $ 207 # 000 .
