   <HEADLINE> JUMPIN ' JUPITER -- IS THIS THE END OF THE WORLD ? ; ASTRONOMY : WE MAY NOT SEE MUCH OF THE ACTION WHEN THE COMET HITS JOVE ' S DARK SIDE , BUT THAT HASN ' T STOPPED THE HARD-CORE LOOKY-LOOS AND TALK OF DOOMSDAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Planetary bombardment can be a humbling experience . Virtually unnoticed between the Three Tenors concert on Saturday and O.J. Simpson ' s scheduled arraignment on July 22 , a chorus of comets will pummel Jupiter with the force of a_million H-bombs . And so , you ' re probably wondering : What ' s in it for me ? If you ' re an astronomer , it will be a once-in-a-lifetime chance to glimpse the kind of cataclysm that might have wiped_out the dinosaurs and paved the way for human life . But for the scores of interstellar looky-loos hoping for a piece of the cosmic action , it may be a disappointment . For sheer entertainment value , say several veteran astronomers , the Home Shopping Network may be more promising . &quot; It will be about as spectacular as pricking an apple with a needle , &quot; said Gibson Reaves , USC astronomy professor emeritus . Despite this dour forecast -- one shared by the majority of serious stargazers -- a bustling comet subculture has burgeoned in recent months . It ' s like some surreal cafe in the deep backwaters of space where Internet junkies meet religious_mystics , armchair space travelers shake hands with their sci-fi heroes and an 11-year-old boy convinces a South_Dakota community that doom is not at_hand . These people don ' t want to know the odds , that the chances of catching the fury of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet are indeed dim . Jupiter , while not quite billions and billions of miles from Earth , is hardly_a weekend drive_away . The comet will hit Jove ' s dark side , out of the sight of even the mighty Hubble Space Telescope . To catch a live shot , earthbound astronomers must rely_on the odd chance that a fireball will reflect off one of Jupiter ' s moons . And because of a faulty antenna , the Galileo space_probe , which is in a perfect spot to view the festivities , will not transmit pictures of the 5 1 / 2-day crash until August , at the earliest . Furthermore , some data suggest that the 20-odd cometary fragments may break_up before impact with Jupiter ' s turbulent atmosphere . By that time , some scientists say , the comets could be reduced to celestial dust bunnies . But that hasn ' t stopped people &quot; who know the situation &quot; from buying telescopes in droves , said Nick Patel of Scope City in Costa Mesa . And John Mosley , a Griffith Observatory astronomer , continues to be bombarded by strange questions . &quot; Someone asked me today what kind of eye protection he should wear , &quot; Mosley said . &quot; People have asked what kind of telescope filter should they use . Those people are off by some 30 orders of magnitude. &quot; For non-scientists , that ' s &quot; about a godzillian. &quot; The electronic superhighway has been jammed with pet theories about the event as well as invitations to comet parties around the globe . As one traveler , identified only as &quot; Mingtoy , &quot; explained : &quot; It would be pretty cool if something spectacular happened out there in my lifetime . I ' m not getting any younger. &quot; Like a seduction scene from a 1940s movie , the thrill for many comet-watchers lies_in what ' s left to the imagination . Few people understand that as well as Larry Niven , the science_fiction legend whose &quot; Lucifer ' s Hammer &quot; has become a focal_point for discussion in recent weeks . In that novel , co-written by Jerry Pournelle , Niven envisioned an Earth under_attack from comets hurtling through space . Now , like scores of amateur astronomers watching Shoemaker-Levy , Niven is thinking in &quot; what ifs. &quot; What if , for instance , the comet is not a string of 20 fragments , but one chunk the size of a moon ? It would , he muses , fire the planet to an unimaginable temperature , emitting enough heat to warm one of Jupiter ' s moons and possibly facilitate human life . &quot; I can picture it , &quot; he said . &quot; A colony on a moon of red-hot Jupiter , so visually arresting with that great big , gaudy red thing flying around . Your grandmother could literally float in the gravitational pull of ( the moon ) Ganymede . Give her swimming fins and a hang_glider and she could do it. &quot; He added : &quot; I am much too busy to write such a book , but its a neatsy idea. &quot; Here on the home planet , the Jupiter rendezvous has caused some very real Angst in the ultra-orthodox Lubavitch community , still reeling from the death last month of its New York City spiritual_leader , Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson . Believing the rebbe to be the Messiah , many followers have eagerly embraced stories linking the comet to an obscure medieval prophecy in the Zohar , a book of Jewish mysticism . They believe the work says that the coming of the Messiah will be presaged by a bombardment of Jupiter . A tract refers to a &quot; cosmic pillar &quot; of fire hitting an eastern planet &quot; shining in all its colors , &quot; which will announce the savior ' s arrival . And to be sure , the cometary bombardments on July 21 will mark 40 days since Schneerson ' s death -- the 40 days after which , according to messianic lore , the savior will rise from the dead . Even if one accepts the validity of the Zohar , said Judaic studies professor Elliot Wolfson of New York University , &quot; it ' s a stretch. &quot; Although Zohar references were noticeably absent from the weekly taped message on the sect ' s toll-free Messiah hot_line -- ( 800 ) 4-MOSHIACH -- Rabbi Yosef Mishulovin of Los Angeles acknowledged that the prophecy has prompted &quot; a lot of talk. &quot; His own feelings are ambivalent : &quot; If it happens , it happens. &quot; Of course , when great things happen in space , fantasy and reality often mingle . For Ted Daniels , the event has been a virtual field_day . As curator of &quot; Millenium Watch , &quot; a clearinghouse of revelation and news of the weird , Daniels has been flooded with comet-related stories . Predictions range from Judgment_Day doom to harmonic convergence . But the jewel came from Paul Shockley , who wrote to Daniels ' quarterly newsletter from Olympia , Wash . The comet crash , Shockley writes , is really a cover-up for the detonation aboard the Galileo of a plutonium_bomb , which would turn Jupiter into another sun . What look_to be comets , he continues , are really alien ships intent_on monkeying with the Hubble Space Telescope . &quot; Oh , I see , &quot; Daniels said , as he finished the letter . &quot; It ' s a preemptive strike in a space war. &quot; In some corners of the world , such news is not taken lightly . Take , for example , the following report on America On-Line from a South_Dakota Indian_reservation with limited access to news . An alarmed writer , identified only as &quot; Wolfmed , &quot; said : &quot; Students came_into class and claimed that an asteroid was going_to impact with Jupiter and destroy the Earth. &quot; Enlightenment came_in the form of one Marshall Fowler , who described himself as &quot; a fifth-grade student at Abel Elementary School in Sarasota , Fla. &quot; Reports of the Earth ' s demise , he said , were premature . &quot; I don ' t believe there is anything to worry about , &quot; he said . &quot; It hasn ' t even been in the media. &quot; * Times research librarian Lonny Brooks contributed to this report .</TEXT>
