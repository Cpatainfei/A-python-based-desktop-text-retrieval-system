   <HEADLINE> JOBLESS RATE FALLS TO 6.4 % , IGNITING FEARS OF INFLATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The national unemployment_rate dipped to 6.4 % in April as the robust economy created a larger-than-expected 267 # 000 new jobs , the Labor_Department reported Friday , but the good economic news rattled jittery stock and bond markets , which fell amid fears that inflation may accelerate . California unemployment rose to 9.6 % , up from 8.6 % , and analysts were disappointed with the figure . But they also saw signs that the state ' s economy is improving slightly . Many of the additional unemployed Californians were job seekers who re-entered the market after being discouraged for so_long that they had stopped actively looking_for work . They had not been counted in recent unemployment statistics . In Orange County the unemployment_rate stayed flat at 6.7 % in March , the most recent month for which figures are available . Because the monthly jobless statistics for the individual counties are computed after the state and national rates , the April figures for Orange County won ' t be released until later this month . In California , &quot; people are being drawn_back into the labor_force &quot; but the economy is not yet creating enough jobs to fill their expectations for returning to work , said Thomas Plewes , associate commissioner of labor statistics . The state gained a meager 4 # 500 jobs in April and total employment still remains more_than half a_million below its 1990 peak . &quot; It sure isn ' t much of a recovery , &quot; said Larry Kimbell , director of the UCLA Business Forecasting Project . At a White_House news_conference , a jubilant Labor_Secretary Robert B . Reich said that the national jobs report , with unemployment falling from 6.5 % in March , &quot; gives us a lot to crow about. &quot; But stock and bond investors were not impressed : * The Dow Jones industrial average of blue_chip shares fell 26.47 points to close at 3669.50 , after plunging more_than 53 points earlier in the day . * Falling bond prices led to higher interest yields , with the key 30-year Treasury_bond soaring to 7.55 % , up from 7.33 % , and reaching the highest level since December , 1992 . * The Federal_Reserve_Board , which has hiked rates three times since February , will be under pressure when its policy-making committee meets May 17 , to drive_up the cost of money yet again to calm the markets . Higher interest_rates would slow the pace of economic activity , presumably preventing the kind of rapid rise in prices that investors fear . There are no immediate visible signs of inflation : consumer prices rose just 2.5 % in the year ending in March . However , the financial markets are fearful that a falling jobless rate could lead to labor shortages , upward pressure on wages and a resurgence of inflation . The Clinton_Administration is sticking_to its forecast of steady economic_growth without any overheating of prices . &quot; I think it ' s impossible to outguess the markets and I ' m not really going_to try , &quot; Laura D ' Andrea Tyson , who chairs the President ' s Council of Economic Advisers , told the White_House news_conference . &quot; I would say to those market participants who might have a concern about inflation . . . that this report is showing us , if you look over the past year , average hourly earnings have only increased about the same rate as inflation . . . . &quot; Tyson said . &quot; So we really have a very good cost situation and a good competitive situation. &quot; The uncertainty for wary investors is whether shortages of workers will occur as unemployment falls and whether product prices will rise as output comes closer to capacity in various industries . &quot; While the April report may cause some indigestion on Wall_Street as another indication of inflation , we believe that sufficient excess capacity still exists to hold_the_line on inflation over the next several months , &quot; said Robert D . Barr , deputy chief economist of the U.S. Chamber_of_Commerce . &quot; Over the longer term we expect that the higher short-term interest_rates engineered by the Federal_Reserve will prevent a new outbreak of inflation , &quot; he said . Further , it ' s likely that the Fed will continue to ratchet up interest_rates &quot; at least a_couple_of more times. &quot; The gain of 267 # 000 jobs would have been even larger but for the strike in the trucking_industry , which idled 70 # 000 workers , Katherine G . Abraham , the government ' s commissioner of labor statistics , told a hearing of Congress ' Joint Economic Committee . Construction , health services and retail trade all showed increased employment for the month , she said . &quot; Growth in April was especially strong in eating and drinking places and in auto dealers and service stations. &quot; In manufacturing , employers are still hesitant to hire new workers , preferring to pay overtime to existing employees . Overtime hit 8.4 hours a week in the auto industry , and 10 hours at sawmills . The average workweek in manufacturing was 42 hours , the highest level since the end of World_War_II . UCLA economist Kimbell and other experts had predicted that Southern California would get a boost from spending to rebuild earthquake-ravaged freeways , buildings and homes . Kimbell said , however , that the improvement in construction , where 1 # 300 jobs were added in the state during the month , does not seem to be spreading to other industries . &quot; It may be giving us less stimulus than we counted_on , &quot; he said . Los Angeles County ' s jobless rate , always volatile because of the small sampling on which it is based , leaped to 9.9 % in April , from 9.4 % in March . Yet the county figures -- which , unlike the federal and state statistics , are not adjusted for seasonal trends -- also offered a small bit of encouragement : The number of people with jobs inched up by 9 # 000 to 3 # 981 , 000 during the month . Labor_Secretary Reich said that California &quot; is trailing the rest of the country by about a year &quot; in moving from recovery to expansion . &quot; Northern California is about on par with the rest of the country . Southern California is way behind , &quot; he said . &quot; The big hits in California continue to be in the defense areas , &quot; said Joseph A . Wahed , chief economist with Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco . Still , he added , the job losses are growing smaller in those industries and &quot; they aren ' t dragging us down the way they were two or three years ago. &quot; Wahed said that the losses in defense and related industries finally have grown smaller than the gains in such areas as construction , retailing and services . The bottom_line , he said , is that &quot; there will be slow improvement in the economy. &quot; California continued to post the highest unemployment among the 11 big states whose unemployment_rates are reported along with the U.S. figures every month . The next-highest jobless rates were reported for New York , at 8.2 % , and Florida , at 7.4 % . The lowest unemployment was in North Carolina , at 3.9 % , followed by Illinois , 5.5 % , and Michigan , 5.7 % . &quot; The mix of unemployment has changed markedly &quot; this year , BLS commissioner Abraham said . For example , the number of job losers in California -- people who were laid_off or dismissed -- was 688 # 000 last month , down significantly from 781 # 000 in March . The number of re-entrants -- people encouraged enough to go_back into the market -- was 494 # 000 , up from 417 # 000 a month before . State_Treasurer Kathleen Brown used the new figures to attack Gov . Pete Wilson , issuing a statement which said that &quot; there ' s a 49-state recovery party going_on and California wasn ' t invited. &quot; Dan Schnur , spokesman for Wilson ' s reelection campaign , said that Brown ' s attack was the work of a desperate campaign . &quot; The old Kathleen Brown understood that California ' s economic difficulties have been caused by national and international forces beyond the control of any individual , &quot; he said . &quot; Before Kathleen Brown gets too happy about the idea of Californians being thrown_out of work , someone ought to explain to her that the reason the percentages changed is because more people than ever before have entered the work force. &quot; Rosenblatt reported from Washington and Silverstein from Los Angeles . Times staff writers Amy Wallace in Los Angeles and John O ' Dell in Costa Mesa contributed to this story .
