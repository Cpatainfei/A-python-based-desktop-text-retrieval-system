   <HEADLINE> ' STAR TREK ' HAS BEEN A VIRTUAL MONEY MACHINE . NOW A NEW SERIES , FILM ARE_DUE WITH . . . ; PARAMOUNT SET ' TO BOLDLY GO '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the final episode of &quot; Star Trek : The Next Generation &quot; airs Monday , Paramount Pictures will pull the plug on its biggest profit maker . Paramount executives are unfazed . &quot; I sleep well , &quot; says Kerry McCluggage , chairman of Paramount TV Group . And well he should . Paramount believes that in &quot; Star Trek &quot; it has found the proverbial pot of gold at the end of the rainbow : an entertainment property suited to endless exploitation . It ' s the kind of hit every studio dreams of but few can actually claim . Now some in Hollywood are wondering if , in rebuilding the studio after its takeover by Viacom , Paramount is not relying too heavily on what insiders there call &quot; the franchise. &quot; The studio is rushing to complete a fall release of its seventh &quot; Star Trek &quot; sequel -- advanced several months to plug holes in its release schedule -- as well as readying its fourth TV series , &quot; Star Trek : Voyager , &quot; which will also serve as the January launch_pad for Paramount ' s fifth network . &quot; Voyager &quot; will air even as three previous &quot; Star Trek &quot; series crowd the airwaves . &quot; What level of saturation can the market bear ? &quot; ponders one former Paramount executive . &quot; Gene Roddenberry would be doing a_few flips in the ground right now. &quot; The late Roddenberry was fiercely protective of his creation and frequently battled Paramount executives over creative aspects of the movies and series . Over the last seven years , &quot; Next Generation &quot; alone has brought_in an estimated $ 511 million in revenue and $ 293 million in profit -- marking it as one of the most successful TV_shows in history . The price of a 30-second commercial , usually about $ 110 # 000 , reached $ 700 # 000 for the final episode . The seemingly endless movie sequels , TV series spinoffs and merchandising bonanza &quot; Star Trek &quot; has spawned since its inception has grossed more_than $ 1.3 billion for the studio . It is with an eye to preserving and expanding the so-called franchise that Paramount decided two years ago that , even if &quot; Next Generation &quot; showed no signs of slipping_in the ratings , it would be terminated after its seventh season . &quot; The original episodes have been outstanding , but once they start repeating five days a week we ' re usually looking_at a declining ratings pattern over time , &quot; McCluggage says . &quot; We didn ' t want stations to choke on all those episodes. &quot; As it turned_out , &quot; Next Generation &quot; reruns have held_up better than expected . &quot; Next Generation &quot; is the highest-rated &quot; first-run &quot; series in syndication , an area of the industry where failure is extremely costly but success begets phenomenal wealth . There are various explanations for the success of &quot; Star Trek , &quot; from story lines inspired by the Bible and Shakespeare to Roddenberry ' s vision of an &quot; optimistic future. &quot; Michael Piller , one of the executive producers , says simply that the movies and shows strike chords with people because they address &quot; the human condition. &quot; Industry executives estimate that &quot; Next Generation &quot; pulled_in an average of $ 50 million annually in advertising revenue , more_than enough to offset the $ 1.4-million production_cost per episode . In addition , Paramount grossed about $ 161 million on the sale of rerun rights for &quot; Next Generation &quot; -- virtually all_of it profit for the studio . The third &quot; Star Trek &quot; series , &quot; Deep Space Nine , &quot; although not as highly rated as &quot; Next Generation , &quot; nonetheless pulls_in about $ 40 million annually in advertising revenue . The rerun rights are expected to exceed those of &quot; Next Generation. &quot; Perhaps nowhere does Paramount exploit the &quot; Star Trek &quot; franchise more shrewdly than in merchandising , which has yielded $ 750 million in retail sales -- everything from boxer shorts and $ 2 # 000 chess_sets to computer_screen savers . Paramount usually gets a 10 % royalty . Next up : &quot; Branded electronics &quot; featuring Star Trek personal_computers and mobile phones . Not that there haven ' t been a_few misses along the way . A Saturday morning cartoon version of &quot; Star Trek &quot; fizzled , and an action toy licensee never caught_on with kids a_few years ago . &quot; A lot of it has to do with timing , &quot; says Andrea Hein , president of Paramount Licensing Group . But the concern among several &quot; Star Trek &quot; observers both inside and outside Paramount is whether the studio might actually be endangering its franchise now by overexposing it . By the time &quot; Voyager &quot; premieres in January , many TV_stations will be carrying four &quot; Star Trek &quot; series : the original 79 episodes from the 1960s NBC series , the &quot; Next Generation &quot; reruns and the original &quot; Deep Space Nine &quot; episodes . Those shows will be airing on the heels of the Thanksgiving theatrical release of &quot; Star Trek : Generations. &quot; &quot; I think there ' s definitely a question of how much time people are going_to devote &quot; to watching &quot; Star Trek &quot; shows , says Piller . &quot; There has already been an effect on the cumulative ratings. &quot; True , the ratings for &quot; Deep_Space Nine &quot; are running about 25 % below that of &quot; Next Generation , &quot; but that could be because the former is only two seasons old and is scheduled in worse time_slots than the latter . Nobody knows this better than Rick Berman , the 48-year-old executive now wearing the &quot; Star Trek &quot; mantle left by creator Gene Roddenberry . Berman , a onetime documentary filmmaker , looks_like he carries the weight of the world on his shoulders . Actually , Berman may be carrying the weight of Paramount on his shoulders . He is producing the $ 25-million feature_film as well as overseeing next season ' s plans for &quot; Deep_Space Nine &quot; and pre-production on the launch of &quot; Voyager. &quot; The three productions are taking_up eight sound stages on Paramount ' s lot and employing 500 people . &quot; Are we taking too many trips to the well ? &quot; Berman asks , having heard the question often . &quot; People asked that about ' Next Generation ' too . But it ' s no riskier than any other film , maybe less . History has shown there is clearly an audience willing to embrace &quot; a series of &quot; Star Trek &quot; TV spinoffs and sequels . Berman takes pains to emphasize that the movie is not a &quot; seventh sequel. &quot; It is , he says , the first film introducing the cast from the &quot; Next Generation &quot; TV series , although some characters , such_as William Shatner ' s Capt . James Kirk , will make appearances . Paramount thinks the &quot; Next Generation &quot; cast will last through several more feature_films . Indeed , Berman suspects that there will be an eighth &quot; Star Trek &quot; feature in the not-too-distant future , with work beginning on the conceptual stages shortly after the movie is released in November .</TEXT>
