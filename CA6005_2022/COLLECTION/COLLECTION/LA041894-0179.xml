   <HEADLINE> ART REVIEW ; PIONEERING PHOTOGRAPHERS AND THEIR ' PALETTE OF LIGHT '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Historically it ' s not uncommon for new technologies to echo the old mechanisms they replace . When automobiles were invented they retained running boards like a vestigial bone from the carriage era . Today computers imitate the typewriters they made virtually obsolete . A thought-provoking small exhibition at the J . Paul Getty Museum shows that something very similar happened in the early days of photography . &quot; Palette of Light : Handcrafted Photographs , 1898-1914 &quot; was organized by curator Weston J . Naef and consists_of 32 vintage prints by camera artists who wanted to make their brand-new art look_like old art . In mood , the show might be called &quot; In the Gloaming. &quot; It ' s thoughtful and a little nostalgic as if , unconsciously , these pioneers sensed the eventual impact of mechanical picture-making with considerable regret . American Edward Steichen is the best known of the five represented . Significantly , he was also a practicing painter . The first of his works_on view is a 1901 self-portrait depicting him as an old_master holding his palette . It isn ' t just the trappings that are painterly . Photographers dissatisfied with the glossy albumen paper that was the standard for early printing came_up with a gum bichromate process that allowed_for more variety of texture and coloration . Steichen and the rest used it to achieve a soft-focus effect that has the atmospheric quality of a painting . This &quot; pictorialist &quot; mode was institutionalized as the Photo-Secession movement back in New York . One of its votaries was Gertrude Kasebier , a kind of photographic Mary Cassatt . Along with Steichen and like-minded others she attached herself to Alfred Stieglitz ' s Gallery 291 . Her portrait of him resembles an early Expressionist print . Maybe she was thinking_about Edvard Munch with his air of devil-dandy . As it turned_out , Stieglitz was the pictorialists ' great Satan . He came_to champion the crisper , more graphic &quot; straight &quot; photographic style that was more in_line with the reductive trends of modernist thinking . It wasn ' t long before the pictorialists were forced to go straight or be cast as dodos . Meantime , they made some touching and finely nuanced work . Austrian Heinrich Kuehn left images like &quot; Miss Mary ( Warner ) at Her Night Table. &quot; It reflects a characteristic pictorialist attraction to figures silhouetted against the light , Rembrandt-style . American Alvin Langdon Coburn clearly had Whistler on the brain in his &quot; Grand Canal , Venice. &quot; There ' s something considerably more original about a 1911 view of Ocean Park . Locals will like it for its revelation of what our beach town looked_like back then . Artniks may pick_up a sense of surreal power in the way Coburn managed to capture the roiling surf as if it had frozen . Speaking of local matters , there is a surprisingly significant image by George Seeley . It shows a landscape near Stockbridge , Mass. , but its smoky silhouette style resembles nothing so_much as the recent paintings of Ed Ruscha . It ' s as if our contemporary hero , poet of Pop and intuitive pioneer of Conceptual art , had looked_back at this supposedly outmoded work and found something that speaks_to the ominous Postmodern present . * &quot; Palette of Light : Handcrafted Photographs , 1898-1914 , &quot; J . Paul Getty Museum , 17985 Pacific Coast Highway , Malibu ; to June 19 , closed Monday . Admission free , advance parking reservations required : ( 310 ) 485-2003 .</TEXT>
