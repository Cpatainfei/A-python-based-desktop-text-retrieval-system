   <HEADLINE> IDAHO TUG-OF-WAR PITS WILD AGAINST WILD BLUE YONDER ; MILITARY : ODD COALITION WANTS TO SHOOT_DOWN PLAN TO TURN 13 # 000 ACRES INTO AN AIR_FORCE BOMBING RANGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The stark moonscape of Idaho ' s southwest corner can be so quiet that Craig Gehrke , an environmentalist who camps and hikes in the area , says you can stand_in the vastness and hear the true sound of silence : the steady , rhythmic whoosh of blood in your ears . This stretch of high , rocky desert , cleaved deeply by dramatic canyons , is sacred to the Shoshone-Paiute Indians settled_on a reservation nearby . It is home to about 35 rare species of plants and animals . It ' s an area so wild and remote that the Interior_Department has deemed it suitable for federal protection as a national wilderness area . If the Air_Force and Idaho ' s governor have their way , however , the silence and solitude of Idaho ' s Owyhee Canyonlands will be broken at least five days a month by the &quot; sound of freedom &quot; -- the roar , thud and shriek of up_to 80 warplanes flying at supersonic speeds , dropping dummy bombs and maneuvering out_of_reach of mock antiaircraft_fire . Under a complex land swap conceived and pushed by one the nation ' s most environmentally minded governors , the state would take possession of 13 # 000 acres of southwest Idaho owned by the Interior_Department . Gov . Cecil D . Andrus , acting_as middleman , would then turn the land over to the 366th Wing &quot; Gunfighters &quot; of Mountain Home Air_Force Base for conversion into the Idaho Bomb Range . The Air_Force would spend $ 26 million to buy equipment and privately owned land adjoining the site , improve roads and build the bomb range . It would then become one of four major target_ranges within a 70-minute flight of the Mountain Home base . But a coalition of federal_officials , environmentalists , Native_Americans and big-game hunters -- as well as some of Andrus ' own state officials -- are looking_to shoot_down the plan . The test of wills , which could wind_up being arbitrated by Congress , represents just one corner of a national battleground between the post-Cold War Pentagon and environmentalists . As the shrinking U.S. military draws its forces home from places such_as Europe and the Philippines , it is seeking to step_up activities and expand territory for maneuvers and training throughout the United States . Such domestic tracts need to be large enough for jets , tanks and other military equipment to practice fast-moving combat tactics and fire long-range weapons . In a February , 1993 , report issued by Gen . Colin L . Powell , then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , the Pentagon acknowledged that &quot; an integrated test and evaluation range structure , &quot; linking existing ranges across six Western states and areas off the California coast , would be necessary to bring U.S. training areas into line &quot; with the changed world. &quot; But as the military pursues that expansion , it is locking horns with environmentalists , who are finding rare common cause with other traditional users of federal lands throughout the West , including ranchers , miners and hunters . The Pentagon is &quot; going berserk right now , and I don ' t understand it , &quot; said Grace Bukowski of the Rural Alliance for Military Accountability , a citizens ' action group that helps organize resistance to the military ' s expansion into public lands . &quot; I thought the Cold_War was over. &quot; The opposition , Bukowski said , is &quot; this strange group of bedfellows who are leaving their shotguns at the door and joining forces to fight the military . Because when it comes_to the military taking_over our public lands , we ' re all_in agreement : If the military gets_it , everyone loses . ( The lands are ) gone_for the ranchers , miners , environmentalists and recreationists. &quot; Gehrke , for one , said he believes that the Idaho situation could represent a final push by the Air_Force . &quot; I just wonder if this isn ' t the last big land grab -- an effort to get one last range before the curtain closes , &quot; he said . With 27 million acres in the United States under military_control already and support for the protection of public lands growing , Gehrke said , &quot; I can ' t see them arguing successfully for more training ranges. &quot; Skirmishes like the one in Idaho are being played_out throughout the nation . But the fights have been concentrated in the West , where vast expanses of open land and lightly populated areas have increasingly drawn the military . * In California , Army plans to expand maneuver areas by 320 # 000 acres at its National Training Center at Ft . Irwin have run headlong into efforts to protect the threatened desert_tortoise . Legislation advocated by Sen . Dianne Feinstein ( D-Calif. ) would exempt the area around Ft . Irwin , which is prime tortoise habitat , from special restrictions to protect the animals . But environmentalists continue to press for greater protection . * In Arizona , a Marine Corps proposal to increase flight activity over the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge has drawn strong opposition from environmentalists . * In Colorado , an Air_Force bid to increase low-level flights across the state has caused a political uproar and has collided_with a state law that strengthens protections for new wilderness areas under the military ' s flight_path . * In New Mexico and Utah , an Army proposal to test-fire Patriot missiles across a stretch of pristine desert has environmentalists up in arms . * In Alaska , the Air_Force and Army are pressing plans for sweeping additions to training areas throughout the state , prompting cries of concern about the effect on wildlife and native people who hunt for subsistence . * In Nevada , the Navy and Air_Force have plans to expand two of the nation ' s most extensive bomb ranges -- those associated with Fallon Naval Air_Station and Nellis Air_Force Base . At Nellis , the Air_Force wants to build a landing_strip on 1 # 400 acres of lake_bed now used for recreation and ranching . In recent years , Fallon Naval Air_Station has put forth plans to increase its training ranges more_than threefold and to double its airspace . At the same time that the Pentagon is trying to expand its turf in some regions , it is being forced to defend its training grounds elsewhere . Last year , a group known as Defenders of Wildlife sued the Defense_Department to stop bombing and aerial combat training at Copalis National Wildlife Refuge on Washington state ' s coastline , an area that is home to endangered stellar sea_lions . Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt intervened to stop the military activity there , and Defenders of Wildlife is now striving for legislation to strengthen protection from military activities for all national wildlife refuges . In recent years , the managers of 72 wildlife refuges in 27 states have warned that their areas have suffered from military air exercises and bombing practice . In pressing its case , the military has gained a powerful weapon : the threat of base closures . For many rural communities dependent_on military payrolls , the prospect that the shrinking military could pack up and leave is both real and frightening . The Pentagon has distanced itself from the politically charged decisions over base closures by turning them over to an independent commission . But the services continue to have a powerful influence in the process because the commission ' s deliberations begin with a list of closure recommendations drafted by the military . As a result , state and local officials know that keeping local base commanders happy could spell the difference between economic life and death . In Idaho , the fear of economic abandonment by the Air_Force is at the heart of the bomb range proposal . Andrus says the Mountain Home base is the second-biggest employer in his state , with a direct annual payroll of $ 140 million and a yearly energy bill with the state ' s utility of $ 300 million . Roughly 4 # 000 Air_Force and civilian personnel are based at Mountain Home . With their families , they make_up well_over half the population of this old railroad town . Andrus said he hopes that a new bomb range will forestall any thoughts by the Air_Force of closing the base . &quot; I would be totally irresponsible as governor of this state if I ignored the potential &quot; that the base would close , he said . With the state working so hard to expand , &quot; you just cannot turn your back on all those jobs &quot; at Mountain Home , he said . Herb Meyr , a retired lieutenant_colonel and fighter_pilot who opposes the Idaho Bomb Range , called the threat of base closures &quot; economic blackmail &quot; that has Andrus and the state over a barrel . The Air_Force denies that it has made any such threat . &quot; We would like to be here a long_time , &quot; said Brig . Gen . Dave McCloud , commanding_officer of the 366th Wing . But because the base-closure commission and the President have the final say in what facilities should close , he added , &quot; it is absolutely out of our hands. &quot; McCloud and other Air_Force officials , however , made_it clear that the Idaho Bomb Range would be counted as another advantage for the base at Mountain Home , which already offers good flying conditions and inexpensive living costs for personnel . McCloud said that by having a new range close to the base , his pilots could get_out of their planes &quot; still soaking wet &quot; with sweat after bombing exercises . The Mountain Home base now has one bombing range nearby , but it is so limited that the &quot; Gunfighters &quot; have to use much of their congressionally limited flying time to reach ranges_in Utah and Nevada for many of their practices . Including the time it takes_to refuel the jets , the trips take 45 to 70 minutes each way . But environmentalists charge that convenience for the Air_Force does not outweigh the dangers to wildlife , Native_American culture and scenery that the Idaho Bomb Range poses . To the Shoshone-Paiute Indians who live_on the border of Idaho and Nevada , all_the land the Air_Force seeks is sacred . Beyond that , a burial_ground and many religious and cultural sites lie_in and around the bombing area . In one of the two proposed areas , Air_Force contractors found about 400 Indian artifacts and sites of potential archeological interest . The area over which warplanes would concentrate is habitat for the prong-horned antelope and the nation ' s largest herd of California bighorn_sheep . Both species are considered to be in serious decline , and Idaho ' s herd of bighorn_sheep has provided vital transplant stock to replenish populations in California and elsewhere . Moreover , part of the proposed Idaho Bomb Range falls_in an area that has been deemed suitable for federal wilderness protection , and two rivers that are candidates for designation as &quot; wild and scenic rivers &quot; flow between the two &quot; impact zones &quot; sought by the Air_Force . The federal Bureau of Land Management has warned Babbitt that if the Air_Force plan moves ahead , those areas probably would not satisfy the criteria for federal protection . In the end , the federal_government , and possibly Congress , will likely be called_upon to arbitrate . And that , in turn , could set_off a war of wills between Babbitt and the Air_Force -- whose secretary , Sheila Widnall , strongly supports the new range . While Babbitt has not yet spoken out publicly on the issue , he is being urged by many advisers and some lawmakers to block the transfer of land to Idaho . Last month , the Idaho Fish and Game Board -- whose members are named by the governor -- recommended against proceeding with the northern half of the bomb range . &quot; We ' re telling them : ' You picked maybe one of the single worst places to do this , ' &quot; said Jerry M . Conley , the Fish and Game Board commissioner . &quot; We ' re telling them : ' Why don ' t you look_at someplace else ? . . . Why can ' t there be another place ? ' &quot; Healy was recently on assignment in Idaho . Target Sighted The state of Idaho wants to devote 13 # 000 acres of wilderness to a new bombing range for Mountain Home Air_Force Base .</TEXT>
