   <HEADLINE> BEST SERIES EMMYS GO TO ' PICKET_FENCES , ' ' FRASIER ' ; AWARDS : ' NYPD BLUE ' FAILS TO WIN DRAMA PRIZE . ' AND THE BAND PLAYED_ON ' IS BEST MOVIE MADE FOR TV .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> CBS ' &quot; Picket_Fences , &quot; about the life and colorful characters in a small Wisconsin town , upset the highly favored ABC police series &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; to win as best drama series at the 46th annual Prime-Time Emmy Awards Sunday night . &quot; And the Band Played On , &quot; based on the late Randy Shilts ' book about the emergence of the AIDS crisis , was chosen best made-for-TV movie . It was made by HBO after being rejected by NBC and ABC . The victory by &quot; Picket_Fences &quot; marked the second consecutive year that the critically acclaimed but low-rated show was the upset winner in the drama series category . In 1993 , it won_over another highly nominated program , &quot; Northern Exposure. &quot; In other key categories Sunday , NBC ' s &quot; Frasier , &quot; which stars the former pompous &quot; Cheers &quot; psychiatrist played by Kelsey Grammer , was named best comedy series . Grammer , who has moved from Boston to his hometown of Seattle in &quot; Frasier &quot; to host a radio advice show , was chosen best lead comedy actor in a series . Candice Bergen won her fourth Emmy as the title character in &quot; Murphy Brown , &quot; in which she plays a star TV_reporter . Dennis Franz , who portrays the heavy-set Detective Andy Sipowicz in &quot; NYPD Blue , &quot; was chosen as top dramatic actor in a weekly show . And Sela Ward was named best lead actress in a series for &quot; Sisters , &quot; in which she plays a recovering alcoholic and free-spirited artist who has turned_to fashion designing . The awards show , broadcast on ABC from the Pasadena Civic Auditorium , paid tribute to actress Jessica Tandy , a past Emmy winner who had died at 85 earlier in the day in Connecticut . She and her husband , Hume Cronyn , were both nominees again Sunday night for the CBS &quot; Hallmark Hall_of_Fame &quot; special , &quot; To Dance With the White Dog. &quot; In the special , which dealt with aging and renewal , Cronyn played a man who must suddenly adjust to being a widower after 57 years when his wife , portrayed by Tandy , dies . In real_life , they were married 52 years . Actor John Lithgow , in the Emmy tribute to Tandy , noted that she was one of the few performers &quot; to receive an Oscar , an Emmy and a Tony. &quot; He added : &quot; We will all miss you very much. &quot; The awards program then showed clips from &quot; To Dance With the White Dog , &quot; for which Cronyn would earn his third Emmy later that evening , for best actor in a miniseries or special . Accepting for Cronyn was presenter Holly Hunter , who said simply , &quot; Hume Cronyn is with his family in Connecticut tonight. &quot; Tandy had been a nominee for best actress in a miniseries or special . That Emmy was won by Kirstie Alley for CBS ' &quot; David ' s Mother , &quot; playing a woman with an autistic teen-age son . &quot; David ' s Mother &quot; also copped Emmys for writer Bob Randall and actor Michael Goorjian , who played the mentally_retarded son . Receiving the Emmy for &quot; And the Band Played On , &quot; which dramatized the early days of the AIDS crisis and those who tried to call attention to it in the face of indifference and politics , producer Aaron Spelling said : &quot; We accept this for Randy Shilts. &quot; Shilts , a San Francisco Chronicle reporter who wrote_about AIDS and other gay issues , died of AIDS in February . &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; had entered Emmy night with a record-setting 26 nominations , more_than any other series -- drama or comedy -- in the history of television . It was widely regarded_as a good bet to tie or pass the all-time record for Emmy Award victories in a single season -- eight -- held by &quot; Hill Street Blues. &quot; Both shows were co-produced by Steven Bochco . When &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; emerged with three awards -- for editing , art direction and casting -- after Saturday night ' s non-televised presentation honoring the Emmys ' creative crafts , it seemed to have a shot at a new record . The problem was that it had to sweep all six categories in which it competed Sunday . And the combination of its own multiple entries -- which split votes and cut_down its chances -- was compounded by &quot; Picket_Fences , &quot; which knocked_out any hopes of a record early on . That happened when two &quot; Picket_Fences &quot; performers -- Fyvush Finkel and Leigh-Taylor Young -- won as best supporting actor and actress in a drama series despite the competition of five performers from &quot; NYPD Blue. &quot; The double loss meant that &quot; NYPD Blue &quot; could come_out with seven Emmys at best . Still , the show led the field with six Emmy Awards . &quot; Frasier &quot; and &quot; Picket_Fences &quot; were next with five each . In fourth place , with four awards , was the CBS miniseries &quot; Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All , &quot; a tale that spanned 130 years , from the Civil War to the present , and featured Anne Bancroft as a matriarch and Cicely Tyson as the slave-turned-housekeeper with whom she forges a strong bond . Tyson , winning as best supporting actress in a miniseries or special , thanked the Emmy-voting members of the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences &quot; for acknowledging the fact that I ' m still here , trying to get_it right. &quot; &quot; And the Band Played On &quot; was also upset in a sense , taking just three awards despite receiving 13 nominations . This was something of a surprise because of the Hollywood community ' s activism fighting the disease . One nominee for best supporting actor in a miniseries or special for his work in &quot; And The Band Played On &quot; was Richard Gere , who played a famous choreographer who was a composite figure representing the many in the entertainment_industry who have fallen victim to AIDS . Other shows with numerous Emmy nominations that fared poorly in the awards were CBS ' &quot; Gypsy , &quot; which starred Bette Midler in an adaptation of the classic stage musical , and NBC ' s &quot; Seinfeld , &quot; which last year was named best comedy series . Finkel , who plays the colorful public_defender in &quot; Picket_Fences , &quot; set_in the fictional small_town of Rome , Wisconsin , gave the Emmy show one of its high points . Said the 72-year-old performer : &quot; I don ' t care how much time they gave me . I waited 51 years to get_on this stage. &quot; Taylor-Young played the mayor in the series before leaving the show recently . Perhaps the biggest ovation of the evening went_to Franz when he was announced as the actor winner for &quot; NYPD Blue. &quot; Insiders thought the race was between him and his co-star , David Caruso , who played Detective John Kelly but is leaving the series after the fourth episode this fall to make movies . Caruso reportedly was rejected in his attempt to get a big salary boost on &quot; NYPD Blue , &quot; and the news of a split became widely known before Emmy voters cast their ballots for the award . He originally did not plan to attend Sunday night ' s awards show but changed his mind , issuing a statement last week that said : &quot; I wish to honor my ' NYPD Blue ' character , John Kelly. &quot; Franz , accepting his award , said : &quot; I am extremely touched. &quot; In his list of thank-yous , he did not mention Caruso . CBS , the top-rated network , was also the big winner in the Emmy Awards , earning 26 , including those handed_out Saturday night . NBC was second with 14 , ABC had 13 , HBO and PBS tied with eight each and Fox had two . For NBC and &quot; Frasier , &quot; the Emmy victory was important strategically because , starting next week , the successful series has been switched to go head-to-head with TV ' s top-rated hit , ABC ' s &quot; Home Improvement. &quot; The matchup of the two comedies is considered network TV ' s battle of the season , and &quot; Frasier &quot; got a further upper_hand by defeating &quot; Home Improvement &quot; in the Emmy competition for best comedy series . Tim Allen , star of &quot; Home Improvement , &quot; was a presenter on the Emmy show but failed to compete against Grammer because his representatives did not enter his nomination in time . Accepting his Emmy , Grammer said he felt proud and &quot; most privileged &quot; to be working_on the show . Director James Burrows , who won a directing Emmy for &quot; Frasier , &quot; said Grammer was &quot; wearing the mantle of the leading man brilliantly. &quot; Among the losers was Angela Lansbury who , despite her huge success in CBS ' &quot; Murder , She Wrote , &quot; failed again to get an Emmy . She has never won in 14 attempts , many of them nominations for the popular show . But CBS ' David Letterman , whose show has defeated NBC ' s &quot; Tonight Show with Jay Leno &quot; every week in the ratings in their year-long competition , also bested his late-night competitor at the Emmys , winning in the category of best variety , music or comedy series . * RELATED STORIES , PICTURES : F1 , F11 , F14</TEXT>
