   <TEXT> As an architect , I ' m always interested in earthquakes and the academic level of just knowing how forces work . All our experiences with earthquakes are that they move laterally , but this one hopped -- which is why a lot of things didn ' t fall_off shelves . In some parts of the city , it ' s like it was as much vertical as it was horizontal . When I came_back , my desk had been hopping_up and down and I could see where the paint was ( damaged ) . Also , just to see the fatigue on some of the buildings . It works its way back into your mind that when you ' re designing , you begin to think_about forces coming from every direction . I ' ve also worked in Tokyo , which probably has one of the strictest earthquake codes . I think that the codes here are going_to become closer to those . They design buildings in Tokyo as if every building is the epicenter . They design completely rigid buildings and I think that ' s what is going_to begin happening here . The building_code is going_to be rewritten structurally and so the cost of construction is going_to go_up . There ' s going_to be a whole shift in the whole system of designing and constructing and all_of that . We have to be ready . Most places that we build are the places that are most likely affected by something . It ' s like we cut hillsides , then put houses on them and then are surprised that there are landslides . We build_on the flatlands and then we ' re surprised that there is earth movement . It ' s all_the flatlands , like underneath here and parts all_over the city , wherever it ' s flat , there ' s water below the ground and it shakes like Jell-O . Except for earthquakes , we ' re never aware that the Earth ' s crust is actually moving , that the Earth is an organism that is constantly moving just like everything else and , in the immediate sense , it affects us , shakes us all up . There ' s something destabilizing about having your body moved by the Earth . We ' re 75 % water and so when you ' re shaking , your cells remember that . Everybody was talking_about the earthquake . Everyone I talked to , the first question they asked was about the earthquake . Everybody shared stories and the one positive thing about that is that there isn ' t much else that cuts_through all_the differences we have . It was something that affected the entire city . It wasn ' t just a fire in Malibu or a landslide in some_other part of the city . The riots almost did that , but they still had distinct lines that they were following . The earthquake hit everybody , and everybody , regardless if whether you were affected directly with major damage , knows somebody that was . It was the first time that I was really struck with that if it ' s not this one , there will be another disaster that ' s going_to make you have to live like a camper . I immediately started thinking_about what everyone else was thinking_about . You know , the long term , the next three to five days , water , food and all_of that and how unprepared I was for that . This happens at a time that one of the things that I ' ve been working_on for the last four years is the whole topic of death . My mother is slowly dying . Physically she is losing all_of her strength , but mentally she is completely alert . So , I began reading a book called &quot; The Tibetan Book of the Dead &quot; ; it ' s a guiding mechanism that you read when someone is dying , as a way of helping them work their way -- the spirit separating from the flesh -- as the Tibetan Buddhists believe . It also talks_about life . But it primarily talks_about the nature of impermanence , and how attached we get_to everything and how we always want to turn everything back to its original condition and how resistive we are when anything changes -- even the smallest things in our lives . The thing for me is that the earthquake served as a kind of a lesson . We ' ve got the disadvantages and the liabilities that come_with natural disaster , but we also have the benefits of knowing that natural disasters are just that -- they ' re not created by other people . With an earthquake , you can ' t place blame , so you have to have faith . The whole element of faith has been missing across the board . The only time most people pray is when they get close to death or something traumatic is going_to happen to them . I think all_of this seems pretty clear to me , that this is some sort of precursor to all_of us having to move_back into a spiritual realm , not religious , and going inside ourselves and seeing what really matters . There ' s something extraordinarily symbolic about being swallowed_up by the Earth -- ashes to ashes .</TEXT>
