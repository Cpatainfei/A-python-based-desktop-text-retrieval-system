   <HEADLINE> DEBONAIR ACTOR JOSEPH COTTEN DIES AT 88 ; MOVIES : PERFORMER BEGAN HIS FILM CAREER IN THE 1941 CLASSIC ' CITIZEN KANE. ' HE REMAINED DURABLE THROUGHOUT , MAKING NEARLY 60 MOTION_PICTURES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Joseph Cotten , the enduring , elegant actor whose four decades in movies began at the pinnacle of film lore with the classic &quot; Citizen Kane &quot; and ended less memorably with the stunning flop &quot; Heaven ' s Gate , &quot; died Sunday . He was 88 . Cotten died of pneumonia at his Los Angeles home , said his business manager and lawyer , Hugh Robertson . Cotten ' s wife , actress Patricia Medina , was with him when he died . The actor had suffered a debilitating stroke and heart_attack in 1981 , and fought for years to regain use of his well-known gravelly baritone_voice . Troubled intermittently by throat nodules , he had his larynx removed in 1990 because of cancer . Cotten ' s earliest films were regarded_as his best and his best-known , beginning with &quot; Citizen Kane , &quot; Orson Welles ' thinly veiled biography of William Randolph Hearst in 1941 , in which Cotten played Kane ' s elderly best_friend Jedediah Leland . To follow in the 1940s were memorable roles in &quot; The Magnificent Ambersons , &quot; &quot; Shadow of a Doubt , &quot; and &quot; Portrait of Jenny &quot; for which he won the 1950 Venice Film Festival prize for best actor . In 1950 , he rejoined Welles the actor in the highly successful international thriller &quot; The Third Man. &quot; &quot; Mine was a heady beginning in the movies , &quot; Cotten wrote with understatement in his poorly received 1987 autobiography , &quot; Joseph Cotten : Vanity Will Get You Somewhere. &quot; &quot; We made a classic without knowing it. &quot; At the other end of his film career , he realized a lifelong thrill in &quot; Heaven ' s Gate &quot; -- opening at Radio City Music_Hall . But the irony of the failed film in 1982 was not lost on him , as he wrote in his book : &quot; It was such a disaster that it closed the Music Hall. &quot; But the dapper , debonair Cotten remained durable throughout , always finding work to support his robust appetites for clothes , travel , women , parties and elaborate homes_in London , Los Angeles or Palm Springs . &quot; The persisting core of Cotten ' s work has been an elegant and unobtrusive craftsmanship which emphasized the role that Cotten was playing rather than the fact that Cotten was playing it , &quot; Los Angeles Times critic Charles Champlin said at the time Cotten ' s book appeared . &quot; Not often has an important Hollywood personality of Cotten ' s generation been so deferential to the material itself . &quot; In a tradition more British than American , &quot; Champlin wrote , &quot; he has been the working actor : Have tux , will travel . He has done everything , from ' Petulia ' to ' The Abominable Dr. Phibes , ' occasionally lending his particular dignity to some very thin texts indeed. &quot; Cotten acted well with , and for , his young friend Welles , and even scripted their &quot; Journey Into Fear &quot; in 1942 . His 1936 stage success in &quot; Horse Eats Hat &quot; with Welles for the Federal Theatre Project and his stage triumphs in Welles ' Mercury Theater propelled Cotten ' s career . Needless to say , Cotten was nonplussed when Welles offered this early appraisal : &quot; You ' re very lucky to be tall and thin and have curly hair . You can also move about the stage without running_into the furniture . But these are fringe assets , and I ' m afraid you ' ll never make_it as an actor . &quot; But as a star , &quot; Welles added , rekindling Cotten ' s sinking hopes for his future , &quot; I think you well might hit the jackpot. &quot; Born in the Virginia peanut center of Petersburg on May 15 , 1905 , &quot; Jo &quot; Cotten got his first job working for his father , the city superintendent of mails , distributing special_delivery mail by bicycle . &quot; I had_the_best pair of legs in the world , &quot; Cotten often recalled . &quot; I pedaled a_million miles if I pedaled a yard. &quot; He did his first acting in high_school , and after dropping_out , set_out to become an actor . He borrowed $ 150 from a banker uncle and went_to Washington , D.C. , to study for a year at the Robert Nugent Hickman School of Expression . &quot; Mr. Hickman ' s voice lessons were valuable , &quot; he later wrote . &quot; Beyond that , I learned that private acting instruction should be prohibited by law . . . . It is the audience who teaches ( an actor ) to act , and that can take_place only in a theatre. &quot; To support himself in Washington , Cotten sold vacuum_cleaners , and on Sundays played semiprofessional football , earning $ 25 a period , and losing most of it playing craps . He later went_to New York , where he found work in a paint warehouse but failed to launch a theatrical career . &quot; Without the natural physical endurance of youth , with its blessed ignorance , its lofty arrogance and vanity strong enough to be mistaken for graciousness , &quot; he wrote decades later , &quot; all actors would end their careers early. &quot; Lured to Miami by a real_estate boom in 1925 , Cotten got a job as an advertising salesman for the Miami Herald at $ 35 a week , which allowed him evenings free to work in the Miami Civic Theatre . A lifelong epicure who enjoyed cooking as well as ordering from menus , he concocted the mayonnaise for something called Tip Top Potato_Salad and marketed it , an enterprise that failed only when health authorities put him out of business for lack of a license . After five years in the Miami Civic Theatre , in which he unabashedly reviewed for the Herald plays in which he starred , a patron offered him a letter of introduction that sent him back to New York . He got theater impresario David Belasco to hire him as an assistant stage_manager , and , while knocking_on stars ' doors to announce &quot; Five minutes please , &quot; understudied Melvyn Douglas in &quot; Tonight or Never. &quot; Cotten did the role for Boston ' s Copley Theatre , where he stayed a season honing his craft in 30 plays . He also persuaded Lenore La Mont , a divorcee he had met in Miami , to come_to Boston to play piano for the troupe . Cotten married La Mont , who had a small daughter , in Boston in the fall of 1931 . Back in New York and out_of_work again as the Depression set_in , Cotten turned_to modeling and acting in one-reel industrial films . He flunked intermittent screen_tests but then met Welles at a radio audition . The two became fast friends when they were thrown_out of a studio for laughing_loudly at an actor ' s mistake . When Welles went_into the National Theatre Project , a Depression-era project for out-of-work theatrical people , Cotten followed . And when Welles and John Houseman set_up their Mercury Theater in 1937 with the play &quot; Julius Caesar , &quot; Cotten won an important role . After two years with Mercury Theatre , and shortly before the radio version of Welles ' group made history with &quot; War of the Worlds , &quot; Cotten was cast opposite Katharine Hepburn in her stage triumph &quot; The Philadelphia Story. &quot; When that tour ended in 1940 , Cary Grant got the role as leading man in the film version , but Cotten decided to try Hollywood anyway . He called Welles and soon found himself with a leading part in &quot; Citizen Kane. &quot; Cotten noted in his autobiography that for his film debut in a role many regard_as the capstone as well as the wellspring of his career , he had to start filming with one day ' s notice . He got the final script at 7 p.m. and reported nine hours later for extensive makeup , at 4 a.m. Like Welles and anyone else with anything to do with &quot; Citizen Kane , &quot; Cotten incurred the enduring wrath of newspaper magnate Hearst . Even when &quot; Joseph Cotten &quot; appeared above the title in subsequent films , the actor noted , Hearst papers reviewed the films without mentioning his name . The Mercury company broke_up after &quot; The Magnificent Ambersons &quot; and &quot; Journey Into Fear , &quot; both in 1942 . The next year , Cotten made &quot; Shadow of a Doubt , &quot; his favorite , and his first film for the independent producer David O . Selznick , who became an even stronger friend and supporter than Welles . &quot; Driving home from David ' s parties required no headlights , &quot; the bon_vivant Cotten wrote with delight . &quot; The sun had always risen. &quot; In addition to films , Cotten during the 1940s did a weekly Sunday CBS radio show called &quot; Ceiling Zero &quot; for Lockheed Aircraft . Cotten ' s first marriage suffered from his wife ' s claustrophobia and fear of traveling , as his career took him to locations throughout the United States and Europe . &quot; I became unfaithful , &quot; he related in his generally saccharine autobiography . &quot; It was very easy . I was a young , healthy , full-blooded American and had achieved a certain amount of fame , which , of course , made_it easier . &quot; I was an actor . A roamer . A lover , &quot; he wrote . &quot; I made pictures , I made_love and I made martinis. &quot; His philandering caused Lenore to attempt suicide at one point when she had sailed to join him in England during filming of &quot; Under Capricorn , &quot; one of his two films for Alfred Hitchcock , which was released in 1949 . She recovered , and Cotten , he later wrote , &quot; discovered the true meaning of fidelity. &quot; She later died of leukemia in Rome when Cotten was working_on the 1960 film &quot; The Angel Wore Red. &quot; After his wife ' s death , Cotten directed a play_at the La Jolla Playhouse , and then retired to his garden to mourn . Among his callers was the actress Patricia Medina , who had been a friend of his wife ' s as well . He married her on the Selznicks ' terrace in the fall of 1960 . Sharing his love of travel and conviviality , Medina performed in many touring plays and some films with Cotten , but generally subordinated her career to his . They performed together in &quot; Calculated Risk , &quot; which hit Broadway in 1962 , just as the newspapers went_on strike , preventing publication of the original review . Resurrecting his advertising expertise , Cotten set_out to publicize the production on television commercials for soap or beer , always demanding his pay in air time to tout the play . It was the first time his name had appeared above the title on a Broadway marquee , he explained , and he was simply &quot; too vain to close. &quot; Cotten continued to make movies in the 1960s and ' 70s , totaling nearly 60 films during his long career . Later forgettable films ranged from &quot; The Last Sunset &quot; to the Japanese &quot; Latitude Zero &quot; to &quot; The Abominable Dr. Phibes. &quot; He had a cameo role in &quot; Airport ' 77 &quot; and even happily appeared on television ' s &quot; The Love Boat. &quot; &quot; I was in a lot of junk , &quot; he candidly told an interviewer in 1987 . &quot; Everyone , &quot; he reflected matter-of-factly in his book , &quot; flirts now and then with a little trash. &quot; &quot; I didn ' t care about the movies , really , &quot; he said in his 80s . &quot; I was tall . I had curly hair . I could talk . It was easy to do. &quot;</TEXT>
