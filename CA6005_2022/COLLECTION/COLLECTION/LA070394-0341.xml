   <HEADLINE> DREAMS OF BETTER DAYS DIED THAT NIGHT ; NICOLE SIMPSON : A STRONG WOMAN , SHE WAS ON A QUEST TO FIND HER IDENTITY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the beginning , she didn ' t even recognize him , that ' s how unworldly she was . &quot; that ' s O.J. Simpson ! &quot; her boss at the nightclub exclaimed . She had never heard of the guy . Later , friends and relatives would recount the episode and shake their heads . It wasn ' t just the naivete . By the time she married him seven years later at the age of 25 , it seemed there had never been a time when the larger-than-life celebrity had not dominated her existence . Their home was his mansion . Their friends were his friends . Her relatives were his employees . When she decided to take_up interior decorating , her only clients were Simpson and his pals . Friends said that if he did not like what she was wearing , she would change clothes to please him . Later she would tell friends that she felt so overwhelmed , not even her words felt to her like her own . In a divorce_court deposition , she would later confess : &quot; I ' ve always told O.J. what he wants to hear. &quot; Now , the man who so shaped the life of Nicole Brown Simpson has come_to dominate the story of her death as well . Charged with murdering her and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman , it is O.J. Simpson who has captivated the nation ' s attention . Nicole Simpson , meanwhile , has been reduced to the size of a poster child , her friends and relatives say bitterly : Murder victim ; battered wife . Nothing like the strong , fun-loving woman they knew . &quot; It ' s all O.J. , O.J. right now , &quot; said Rolf Baur , 46 , a first_cousin who was raised by Nicole Simpson ' s parents and whom she and her sisters considered a brother . Cynthia ( Cici ) Shahian , 39 , a Beverly Hills friend , said : &quot; I feel that Nicole has gotten lost in all this. &quot; Their Nicole , they say , was a 35-year-old wife and mother who had never felt free to be just herself . Half her life had been consumed in the tempestuous tit-for-tat that had been her celebrity marriage . In what would be her final days , she had resolved to finally find her identity . But it was a wrenching endeavor . The relationship was a monstrous edifice , friends and relatives say , a dark house of passion , manipulation , money , love and violence . Her quest , they believe , cost her her marriage . Prosecutors say it cost her her life . * Nicole Brown Simpson was born May 19 , 1959 , near Frankfurt , Germany , her mother ' s homeland . Lou Brown , a native of Kansas , had met and married Juditha Baur of the small_town of Rollwald , where he was serving with the Air_Force . Their first two daughters , Denise and Nicole , were born in Germany , while Lou Brown worked_at Stars and Stripes , the American military newspaper ; later , he started an insurance_company for members of the military . Returning to the United States when the girls were toddlers , the Browns lived first in Long_Beach , then bought a large home with a tennis_court , a 16-foot-deep pool and a three-acre back yard in the Royal_Palm Estates section of Garden Grove . Two more daughters , Dominique and Tanya , were born . Nicole and Denise started high_school there , at Rancho Alamitos High_School , before the family moved to the gated Orange County beach community of Monarch Bay in the mid-1970s . At Dana Hills High_School , what people remembered first about the Brown girls was how good-looking they were . Nicole -- they called her &quot; Nick &quot; -- was named homecoming princess by the football_team in 1976 ; the year before , Denise had been homecoming queen . &quot; Nicole was bubbly , always happy and smiling , &quot; said Bill Prestridge , one of her teachers . At the same time , however , she was &quot; more mature than other students , &quot; he said . &quot; You almost got the idea that she was ready to get_out of high_school and go_on to bigger and better things. &quot; Interested in modeling and photography , Nicole enrolled briefly at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo , where high_school friend Chris Valdivia occasionally saw her around campus . By that time , he said , everyone knew she was dating Simpson but her romance with the football superstar didn ' t seem to have changed her . &quot; She was just always really down-to-earth , really friendly , &quot; Valdivia said . ' Volatile . . . Relationship ' Nicole was barely 18 and just out of high_school when she met Simpson . After a two-week stint as a salesclerk in a boutique -- during which she made not a single sale , according to her divorce papers -- she started work as a waitress at the Daisy , a trendy Beverly Hills club where Simpson was a regular . The football legend , then 30 , whose first marriage to high_school classmate Marguerite Whitley was faltering , began courting Nicole almost immediately , Baur said . Jo Hanson , a Dana Hills High_School home_economics teacher , remembers Nicole coming_back to proudly usher Simpson around to meet her and sign autographs for those in the class one day . &quot; You know teen-agers , &quot; she said . &quot; They like someone older and more sophisticated and she certainly did . He was everybody ' s idol , of course , then. &quot; Within months , she had moved_in with him , dropping_out of community_college because Simpson &quot; required that she be with him , &quot; according to the brief her divorce_lawyer filed_in 1992 . &quot; It was a very passionate , a very volatile , a very obsessive relationship . On both sides , &quot; said actress Cathy Lee Crosby , a friend of the couple who has known O.J. Simpson for 15 years . One source close to the family said that even before they were married , they had fights . During one , Nicole holed_up in the bathroom and telephoned her mother , the source said . There were times , the source said , when she would move_out and other times when he would throw her out , tossing her clothes after her . Then she would go_home to her parents in Monarch Bay , but within days a contrite Simpson would call and apologize , she would return and for a time they would be loving again . &quot; They had many , many happy days together , &quot; the source said . &quot; It just seemed like something snapped sometimes. &quot; Although he was physically powerful , &quot; she fought him back with words . She ' s a strong person , &quot; the source said . She did not feel strong , though . &quot; I only attended junior_college for a very short time , because ( Simpson ) wanted me to be available to travel with him whenever his career required him to go_to a new location , even if it was for a short period_of_time , &quot; she said in an affidavit filed during her divorce . &quot; I have no other college education , and I hold no degrees. &quot; But with Simpson ' s money and growing fame , who needed a career ? And her emotional contributions did not go unrecognized . Six months after their wedding in 1985 , when he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall_of_Fame , Simpson thanked his new -- and pregnant -- wife for helping ease his departure from sports . Gazing down at his wife from the podium , he said she &quot; came_into my life at what is probably the most difficult time for an athlete , at the end of my career . . . ( and ) turned those years into some of the best I have had in my life , babes. &quot; Two months after that , their first child was born , a baby daughter . By that time , Simpson had become a national spokesman for Hertz and several other companies , earning an estimated $ 1 million a year . They moved to a $ 5-million Brentwood mansion on Rockingham Avenue . They had his-and-hers Ferraris . A $ 1.9-million Laguna Beach_house . A New York pied-a-terre . Her pocket_money allowance was $ 5 # 000 a month or more . At the time , divorce records show , Simpson was supporting his mother and two grown children from his first marriage ; he was equally generous with his in-laws . He hired Baur , first as the gardener at their estate , then as the manager of his two Pioneer Chicken restaurants in Los Angeles . At the same time , Baur ' s wife , Maria , worked as the Simpsons ' housekeeper three days a week . Simpson ' s father-in-law Lou worked for him as well , running his Hertz car rental franchise at the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel . &quot; O.J. practically gave it to him , &quot; Baur said . He added that Simpson also paid_for Nicole ' s sister Dominique to attend USC . It was an old-fashioned marriage in which she minded the baby and he paid the bills . Every Easter , they gave an elaborate shindig at the Rockingham mansion for all_the relatives . The couple were a magnetic presence at all_the family gatherings . Baur has videotape , shot and narrated by Simpson , of the day Baur brought his newborn son home from the hospital . ( As the family parades into Baur ' s small Long_Beach apartment , Simpson can be heard teasing his brother-in-law about whether he has &quot; cleaned_up for the boss. &quot; ) In 1988 , the Simpsons had a second child , a son . By all appearances , friends said , they seemed to have a perfect life . &quot; When they had parties at Rockingham , we had_the_best times . We would play games -- scavenger hunt , truth or consequences , &quot; said Cora Fischman , who lived_down the street from the Simpson home . Fischman was a doctor ' s wife with three children , and through the youngsters , she and Nicole Simpson became close friends and confidantes . Her daughter attended private_school with the Simpsons ' little_girl and her youngest child went_to the same preschool as their son . But if Nicole Simpson was a talented hostess and a conscientious mother , she was also notable among her contemporaries for her guardedness . That caution extended even to Baur ' s wife , who worked in the Simpson house three days a week for almost three years . &quot; She was the type of person who would not say to me what her problems were , &quot; said Maria Baur , who said she often heard the couple exchange screaming , angry words behind the closed door of the home ' s office . &quot; She would n ' t talk. &quot; &quot; The truth is , no one really knew her during her marriage , &quot; said one woman who had been friends with her since both were in their early 20s . &quot; She was never free to be herself or have friends . She wasn ' t available for that kind of intimacy. &quot; It was only much later , the friend added , that she began to suspect there was more to Nicole Simpson ' s guardedness than met the eye , that there was something very wrong about her tendency toward sudden cancellations and no-shows . &quot; She would have these horrible cramps . that ' s what O.J. would tell us . ' Nicole has horrible menstrual cramps. ' Supposedly they kept her in bed for days , &quot; the friend said . Eventually , however , the violent and jealous facets of the Simpson marriage became common -- if closely held -- knowledge in their small circle of friends . Jennifer Young , daughter of Gig and Elaine Young , the late actor and the Beverly Hills real_estate_agent , recalls bumping_into Simpson one day at La Scala in Beverly Hills while waiting to be seated for lunch . Graciously , she said , he asked her and her girlfriend to join him , and they did . But when they left the restaurant , she said , Nicole Simpson roared up in a black Mercedes , her blond hair in a bun , her face contorted with rage . &quot; She was screaming at the top of her lungs in the middle of Rodeo Drive , &quot; Young said . &quot; She was , like , ' If you ' re f------ going to cheat_on me , why don ' t you pick somebody f------ pretty ? ' &quot; It was that sort of conflict , her friends said , that touched_off their most serious fights . &quot; He ' d cheat . She ' d find_out . She ' d get angry . She ' d confront him . She ' s a strong girl and she ' d confront him . And they would fight , &quot; said one longtime friend . New Year ' s Day Assault This , friends say , was the backdrop on New Year ' s Day , 1989 , when the now-infamous beating occurred . According to police reports , as officers arrived_at the Simpson estate at 3:30 a.m. , Nicole Simpson burst from the hedges , rushed across the lawn in her sweat pants and bra and collapsed against the gate-release button . &quot; He ' s going_to kill me , he ' s going_to kill me , &quot; she cried , according to the report . &quot; You never do anything about him . You talk to him and then leave. &quot; Her eye was black . Her lip was split . His handprint was still on her neck . &quot; I don ' t want that woman sleeping_in my bed anymore ! &quot; Simpson shouted , according to the report . &quot; I got two women , and I don ' t want that woman in my bed anymore. &quot; Simpson -- who later pleaded no contest to spousal battery -- has since said the incident was an isolated one , and that he took the blame to head_off bad publicity for him and his wife . Later , outsiders would wonder why Nicole Simpson did not end the marriage then . But to their friends and relatives , it seemed that by that time their entanglement was so powerful it could never be sundered . Baur said she stayed &quot; because she loved him . And he loved her so much. &quot; And there were her hopes , friends said , that her children would have a stable home . &quot; She said all she wanted was to be a good mom like her mom , &quot; Fischman said . &quot; All she wanted was a simple life. &quot; But &quot; she was afraid that if she left , a lot of people would be left_out in the cold , &quot; one intimate said , referring to her relatives ' financial connections to Simpson . Finally , however , in early 1992 , Nicole Simpson filed for divorce . By that time , her father was no longer working for Simpson . The car franchise , Baur said , had never been profitable , and Simpson had finally sold it . Lou Brown , whose other business ventures had included commercial real_estate investing and carwash ownership , went_into semi-retirement . Baur , too , found himself out of a job , although according to court documents his loss was a function of local events . In divorce records , Simpson reported that the Los Angeles riots destroyed his one profitable Pioneer Chicken franchise , forcing the shutdown of the other as well . Baur , while confirming the financial connections between his relatives and Simpson , said he does not believe that Nicole Simpson felt compelled to prolong her troubled marriage because of any family dependence on her husband . &quot; I don ' t think that ' s fair , &quot; Baur said , &quot; because not everybody was_on his payroll and we all worked hard for our money . He had jobs to do and we did them. &quot; Other family members declined comment . The divorce left Nicole Simpson single again for the first time since her teens . She was awarded $ 433 # 750 and $ 10 # 000 a month child_support . She moved_into a rented house five minutes from the mansion , then bought a nearby condominium . Friends said she was as dutiful a mother as ever , handling the car-pool , showing_up at all_the school functions , shuttling her little son to karate lessons and her daughter to dance class . But suddenly , they said , a freer , lighter Nicole Simpson also began to emerge . The transformation in her , friends said , was palpable . &quot; She became Nicole Brown , her own person , &quot; Fischman said . &quot; She started all_over again. &quot; She got friendlier with old acquaintances , developing a cadre of perhaps half_a_dozen women friends -- Fischman , Shahian , Westside socialite Faye Resnick , actress Robin Greer , and Chris Jenner ( wife of athlete Bruce Jenner ) , among others . They were a stunning crew ( &quot; We ' re all pretty cute , &quot; laughed one Westside divorcee who developed a close bond with her on a trip to Cabo San Lucas . &quot; When we went_out to dance , we had to dance with each other to keep the wolves away. &quot; ) She threw potluck dinners by candlelight . She would drop the children at school and go jogging -- six , nine , 10 miles at a clip -- in skintight workout clothes . She would tuck the children into bed at night , recite the Lord ' s Prayer with them in German , and then leave them with a sitter while she went_out dancing till last call . Bartenders would watch , mesmerized , as she hit the dance_floor , dripping sweat , in her tank_top and strategically ripped jeans , slapping down her platinum American Express for another round of Patron tequila . Other nights , she would don a black mini-dress and meet her new girlfriends for dinner at Brentwood ' s Toscana restaurant , splurging on $ 150 bottles of Cristal champagne . Even so , what people remembered was her down-to-earth disposition . &quot; She was totally a real person , &quot; said an acting teacher who ran_into her intermittently over the years . &quot; She had nice things , but she treated her Ferrari the way other people treat their Volkswagen . She was such a no-attitude person. &quot; Her friend Shahian added : &quot; She was just so generous -- with her money , herself . She ' d have six , seven kids over there at a time. &quot; Still , the legacy of the marriage cast its shadow . She couldn ' t help it . It was the standard against which she defined herself . Simpson detested smoking ; she would sneak cigarettes . He was fastidious ; she boasted about what a mess her new home was . During their marriage , he encouraged her to wear only the finest of clothes , deluging her with French Fogal stockings at $ 60 a pair . On her own , friends said , she had to be prodded to go shopping and showed_up at black-tie dinners barelegged . And Simpson , friends said , was ubiquitous . Affluence notwithstanding , Brentwood is a small_town . Gossip echoes from every iron gate and grocery aisle . A five-minute drive could tell him if a stranger was parked in his ex-wife ' s drive . She could flip on the TV and see who was sitting next to him in the stands at a football game . She dated , friends said , although the dates were few and far between . There was Keith Zlomsowitch , a restaurateur she had met in Aspen and later at Mezzaluna , a trattoria-style Brentwood watering_hole . Friends said he doted on her , but she was not ready for a serious relationship . One night , they said , Simpson drove past her house and through the front window saw Zlomsowitch on the couch with her ; she stopped dating him very soon thereafter . ( Zlomsowitch could not be reached for comment . His parents confirmed that he had once been briefly involved with Nicole Simpson and had been a pallbearer at her funeral. ) There were two other men as well , the friends said -- an aspiring actor with whom she had a brief fling , and later , a tentative , six-month romance with a 24-year-old law clerk she had met in her divorce_lawyer ' s office . But about 18 months after leaving Simpson , she began seeing a counselor , one friend said , a man they had all heard about in Aspen who specialized in group therapy . &quot; We all went_for a_couple_of months , &quot; the friend said , &quot; and then Nicole went_for the intensive , which was about $ 4 # 000 , where she would go every day for , like , a month. &quot; When she emerged , the friend said , she announced that she had made a decision : &quot; She called me up and said , ' I want my husband back. ' &quot; &quot; She called O.J. up , &quot; the friend said . He refused to take the call , &quot; so she drove over there in just her zoris and a little summer shift. &quot; He told her he was doing fine without her , but when she got home , he called to say he had changed his mind and wanted to reconcile . Before long , their relationship was tempestuous again . &quot; He broke the back_door down to get_in , &quot; she pleads on a widely aired 911 tape from Oct . 25 , 1993 . &quot; He ' s f------ going nuts . . . . He ' s going_to beat the s--- out of me. &quot; On the tape , she tells the operator that Simpson had been leafing through her photo albums and had come_across a picture of an ex-boyfriend ( friends said it was Zlomsowitch ) . On and Off Reconciliation Still , the reconciliation continued , on again , off again , friends said . Now they were living at Rockingham ; now she had bought a condo of_her_own . Now the relationship was doomed ; now they were together for Christmas . Now she had had enough ; now it was her birthday , and he had given her a platinum bracelet studded with sapphires and rubies and diamonds . But a week after her birthday , Baur said , she gave_back the bracelet and told Simpson that there would be no reconciliation and no hope of one . &quot; Nicole wanted to be free_of him , she wanted to live her life with the children and raise them away from all this fiasco of the marriage , &quot; he said . &quot; She wanted to have a happier , more peaceful life . . . . This time it was different . She really meant it and he knew it. &quot; Afterward , he said , she seemed relieved . In a matter of days , Simpson was being seen with model Paula Barbieri , whom he had dated right after the divorce . Donna Estes , a writer and film_producer who has known the Simpsons for the last six years , said she saw him with Barbieri at a Memorial_Day golf outing , but that before dinner , Barbieri suddenly left . Later , Estes said , Simpson confided that they had gotten_into an argument when he confessed that he still loved Nicole . But on the night before Nicole died , Simpson showed_up at a black-tie event with Barbieri on his arm . Friends said Nicole was relieved when she found_out : &quot; She was happier than hell about it , &quot; said a woman who spoke_to her on the night she died . Still , the next day , at their daughter ' s dance recital , her friends said , Simpson and Nicole scarcely looked_at each other . A friend who was there said she made_it clear he would not be invited to the family dinner afterward . As always , their friends said , they made a stunning pair , she in her backless black dress , he in silk shirt and jeans . Three folding_chairs , wide as a demilitarized zone , marked the chasm between them as their little_girl danced . In less than six hours , Nicole Brown Simpson was dead .</TEXT>
