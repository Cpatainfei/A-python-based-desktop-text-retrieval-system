   <TEXT> &quot; The paintings selected for the show are filled with sunlight and warmth -- both words that remind me of Athalie . . . . Mrs . Nixon was my First_Lady . Mrs . Nixon and I always agreed that Athalie was our First Lady. &quot; -- Richard Nixon , Feb . 4 , 1994 , &quot; Reflections of California. &quot; Gathering_in the private room at the Richard Nixon Library &amp; Birthplace where the Presidents and First_Ladies were received after Nixon ' s funeral , about 90 library supporters celebrated last week ' s launch of the facility ' s new art exhibit , &quot; Reflections of California , The Athalie Richardson Irvine Clarke Memorial Exhibition &quot; sponsored by the Irvine Museum . The sit-down luncheon , underwritten by Judie and George Argyros of Newport Beach , marked the first social_event staged at the Yorba Linda library since Nixon ' s burial there on April 27 . Guest of honor at the not-to-be-missed affair for Orange County ' s social-political set was heiress Joan Irvine Smith , daughter of philanthropist and political activist Athalie Clarke ( a personal friend and booster of Nixon , who , until her death last May at age 90 , was considered Orange County ' s grand dame. ) During the lecture that preceded the Presidential Reception_Room luncheon , Smith stood before hundreds of spectators in the library auditorium to touch_on the highlights of her mother ' s life via a slide presentation of family photographs and the exhibit ' s California Impressionist paintings . &quot; I wanted to create a memorial to my mother that would make her live_in the hearts of those who knew her and introduce her to those who had never known her , &quot; said Smith , speaking_of the exhibit and &quot; California Reflections , &quot; the art / history book she has published about Clarke ' s life . &quot; I hope , through this book , I have been able to achieve this. &quot; * Smith has published a 185-page volume that will keep Orange County society buzzing for months . In the book , Clarke , who was always quiet and ultra-private when she moved_in social circles , shares never-before-revealed secrets of her life . There ' s candid talk_of how Clarke , before her marriage in 1929 to James Irvine Jr . ( Jase ) was threatened by his ex-wife , Madeleine : &quot; Only one thing marred that beautiful day , &quot; she wrote . &quot; The awful letter Jase had received from Madeleine . It stated I would never reach the altar alive . I would have a bullet through my head before the service began. &quot; ( On the following page is a picture of the intrepid bride , resplendent in Belgian lace , smiling as she stood on the altar . They would honeymoon for three months at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel on Waikiki Beach. ) The book also contains a lively account of the antics performed by her father-in-law , Irvine ranch owner James Irvine II , during a 1929 Fourth_of_July celebration at Irvine Cove : &quot; As fast as he could break_off a half or dozen or more ( firecrackers ) , he would light them and toss them under the ladies ' chairs . Some of the women were so startled they jumped_out of their chairs . Others just fell_out . My father-in-law was convulsed with laughter. &quot; And mention of a harrowing dinner_party that involved James Irvine II and a fireplace : Her guests were enjoying coffee in the living room , Clarke wrote , and suddenly her father-in-law came_through the front_door with &quot; four or five pointers &quot; in tow . &quot; They were a lively bunch until Mr. Irvine took a seat in his favorite chair . He stroked each one . . . ( then ) produced a tennis_ball wound around with very strong string and . . . threw the ball into the fireplace . &quot; Each one of the dogs tried to retrieve the ball from the fire . One of them did and brought it to Mr. Irvine . The others barked , yelped and shook their ears . Some of them were badly singed. &quot; * One of the book ' s most poignant passages recalls the time when the newborn Smith -- named Athalie Anita until Smith changed it to Joan when she was 4 years old -- was critically ill . A blood_transfusion saved her life . &quot; I knew it was nothing but a miracle that she had lived , &quot; Clarke wrote . &quot; It was then I promised my father I would always do whatever I could for the medical_profession for as long as I lived . I have been asked many times why I have so_much interest in anything medically oriented . I have not shared the real reason before. &quot; Smith ' s words are interspersed with Clarke ' s throughout the book ( which is available at the library for $ 40 per copy ) . On one of the final pages , Smith wrote_of her mother ' s peaceful death , which occurred during one of Clarke ' s daily naps in her art-filled Belcourt home : &quot; When I reached her home , I went_to her bedside and looked down into her sleeping face . To my amazement , the years and the pain had vanished from her countenance and she was once again my beautiful young mother I remembered when I was a girl. &quot;</TEXT>
