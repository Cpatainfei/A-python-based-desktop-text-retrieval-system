   <HEADLINE> HARD-LINER IS FAVORED IN EL_SALVADOR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like many of the party faithful , Armando Calderon Sol has decorated his office with a large portrait of the late Roberto D ' Aubuisson , the cashiered army major widely believed to have organized El_Salvador ' s most notorious death squads during the last decade of civil_war . With his mentor D ' Aubuisson , Calderon Sol founded the Nationalist Republican Alliance ( Arena party ) in 1981 as a bulwark against communism . Today , barring major surprises , Calderon Sol will be elected president of El_Salvador in a runoff that concludes the country ' s first postwar election . Calderon Sol , a former mayor of this capital , brings with him his party ' s hard-line history , yet he will preside over a country where leftist former guerrillas -- his recent enemies -- for the first time have a legal role in government as legislators and mayors . In today ' s voting , the right-wing Calderon Sol , 45 , is expected to defeat leftist Congressman Ruben Zamora , who leads a coalition made_up primarily of former guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front ( FMLN ) . The victor replaces President Alfredo Cristiani , also of Arena . Cristiani represents the modern business faction of Arena that has projected the image of a more pragmatic and less extremist party . Calderon Sol , however , has included hard-line elements of the party in his inner_circle , raising questions about the government he will run and its commitment to U.N.-brokered peace accords signed by Cristiani . The accords ended the war in 1992 and required a host of reforms , including the creation of a nonpolitical police_force and the overhaul of El_Salvador ' s corrupt and inept judiciary . Many of the reforms are still incomplete , and opponents fear that Calderon Sol will backtrack on changes seen as crucial to building democracy here . &quot; The real danger is that Arena , with its wide margin of victory , will be tempted to impose a one-party system , marginalizing the ( opposition ) rather than working with it , &quot; said Christian Democrat businessman Abraham Rodriguez . Calderon Sol says he supports the peace accords but disagrees_with some of the measures they require . A U.N.-backed Truth Commission that investigated war_crimes went too far , he argues , because it blamed most atrocities on government forces . And the police , he told reporters , should be professional but should also be &quot; feared. &quot; Today ' s runoff is required because no candidate obtained an absolute_majority in March 20 elections . In that contest , Calderon Sol took 49 % of the vote to Zamora ' s 25 % . Arena and an allied pro-military party won majority control of the National Assembly . The elections had been seen as an important test in El_Salvador ' s struggle to recover and rebuild after the war , but widespread irregularities in the March 20 voting cast a pall over the entire process . Tens of thousands of people were prevented from voting . &quot; There was frightening mismanagement of the election beyond our worst expectations , &quot; a senior U.N. official said last week . &quot; There was widespread lack of trust by the electorate before the voting , ( and ) now it ' s much worse. &quot; The most scathing criticism has been leveled at the Supreme Electoral Tribunal , which supervises the elections and is dominated by Arena . It refused international advice , declined to spend money to transport voters to the polls and made voting unnecessarily complicated , U.N. observers say . &quot; The ( tribunal ) is completely discredited and has therefore tarnished the election , &quot; the U.N. official said . The FMLN claims the irregularities cheated the party out of several municipal and legislative seats , and U.N. observers have confirmed that thousands of people were denied voting cards in 30 towns where the FMLN is strong . The FMLN challenged the results in 37 cities and towns , but the tribunal rejected all_the claims -- a decision that Rafael Lopez Pintor , who heads the U.N. electoral division , called &quot; shocking. &quot; Calderon Sol and other Arena officials say the party has changed in the last decade as it has sought to widen its appeal_to the political center . They describe a well-organized , more moderate party without whose cooperation Cristiani could not have forged a peace agreement with the rebels . &quot; In 1981 , I thought the only way to save El_Salvador was to kill all_the communists , &quot; said Ricardo Montenegro , an Arena veteran and vice_president of the National Assn . of Private Enterprise . &quot; The situation was either we killed them or they would kill us . . . . &quot; Seventy thousand people have been killed , the country has been destroyed . This makes us see things from another perspective . Just killing people does not solve things . . . . The people with Calderon Sol have changed , as the majority of Salvadorans have changed in the last 15 years. &quot; Critics question just how deep those changes go . D ' Aubuisson ' s name , for example , is still invoked in reverent tones at every Arena rally . Diplomats say the strongest leverage that can be applied to Arena will be the desire of business_leaders to continue to prosper . In the two years that have passed since the end of the war , San Salvador has experienced a construction boom , and commerce is brisk . &quot; There is a very powerful private sector here that depends_on the exports market and does not want ( the Salvadoran government ) to be an international pariah , &quot; said a diplomat who follows Arena . &quot; Changes in the Arena party are not done for altruistic reasons but because it works politically and helps attract investment. &quot; According to secret U.S._government documents declassified last year , Arena ' s paramilitary unit , directed by D ' Aubuisson , was responsible_for thousands of murders and a wave of terrorism through the 1980s . The Truth Commission found that D ' Aubuisson ordered the 1980 assassination of Roman_Catholic Archbishop Oscar Romero . &quot; Ultra-rightist standard-bearer Roberto D ' Aubuisson and members of his Nationalist Republican Alliance cooperate with and direct some terrorist groups , &quot; according to one of the documents , a February , 1985 , CIA briefing paper . &quot; Although we perceive Arena ' s internal terrorist network to be one component of the much broader phenomenon of rightist violence in El_Salvador , the party ' s attitudes and goals probably influence extremist perspectives in general. &quot; D ' Aubuisson died of throat cancer in 1992 . The documents also report that the 1981 kidnaping of Emilio Charur , president of the Salvadoran Soccer Federation , was plotted at Calderon Sol ' s home . An army_officer who worked for death squads and is currently in jail in the Salvadoran city of Santa Ana claims that Calderon Sol was part of a group of young Arena militants who bombed the Ministry of Agriculture and wreaked other havoc in the early 1980s . The group ' s alleged goal was to destabilize the government at the time , which was initiating an agrarian reform that took land from wealthy Salvadorans . Calderon Sol has denied the allegations . Diplomats , politicians and business_leaders point to substantial differences between Cristiani and Calderon Sol . A lawyer by profession who made a popular mayor , Calderon Sol is seen as a quick-tempered man who lacks Cristiani ' s intellectual and negotiating skills . He relies more on affability than wit and has been described as malleable . One businessman tells a story of meeting with Calderon Sol three times to discuss a tax , and each time Calderon Sol had a different position . Such characteristics , analysts say , make those who surround Calderon Sol all_the more influential . Diplomats say they will be watching closely to see if Arena extremists are given Cabinet positions .</TEXT>
