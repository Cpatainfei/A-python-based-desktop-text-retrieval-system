   <HEADLINE> NEXTEL PLANS 2 NOTCHES FOR ITS WIRELESS BELT ; COMMUNICATIONS : DEALS WITH DIAL PAGE AND MOTOROLA WOULD SECURE ITS NATIONWIDE PRESENCE IN THE BURGEONING INDUSTRY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In deals that would cement its nationwide presence in the burgeoning wireless communications field , NexTel Communications Inc. said Friday that it will merge with Dial Page Inc. and buy all_of Motorola Inc. ' s specialized mobile radio licenses , two stock-swap transactions valued at a total of $ 2.4 billion . The deals are the latest in a string of aggressive moves by NexTel , a provider of specialty mobile radio services . With the backing of equity investor MCI Communications , NexTel is now positioned to become a major force in a new generation of mobile communications technology that officials say will dramatically change the way Americans communicate . &quot; I don ' t think there ' s anywhere near a good appreciation of the potential of wireless &quot; communications , said Morgan E . O ' Brien , NexTel ' s chairman . &quot; The people who are making the huge bets ( on wireless technology ) , and the bets we are making , . . . are not crazy . What people don ' t realize is how these products will change the way you live. &quot; By gobbling_up Greenville , S.C.-based Dial Page -- which provides mobile radio services in much of the Southeast -- and the Motorola radio licenses , NexTel is eliminating potential competitors and filling big gaps in its wireless coverage area . NexTel ' s specialized mobile radio service provides wireless communications over a portable hand-held device that uses a portion of the airwaves once employed mainly by taxi dispatchers . It works_on different frequencies than cellular_telephones and is among the leaders in_using digital technology to provide clearer circuits and greater capacity . Rutherford , N.J.-based NexTel , formerly called Fleet Call , began buying_up mobile radio licenses last year . In February , MCI announced it would invest $ 1.3 billion in NexTel to enable the firm to expand nationwide . NexTel also announced recently the purchase of OneComm Corp . of Denver for more_than $ 650 million and the acquisitions of 22 % of Mexican wireless provider Corporacion Mobilcom for $ 165 million . NexTel and its big ally are girding for battle with AT &amp; T , whose $ 12.6-billion acquisition of McCaw Communications , the nation ' s largest cellular_phone provider , was recently approved by the Justice_Department . NexTel says that in 1996 it will become the first company to offer digital wireless services nationwide . Wireless communications services are already one of the fastest-growing segments of the $ 300-billion telecommunications industry . Yet the increasingly mobile American work_force and the proliferation of ever-more-powerful portable_computers is fueling even more demand for always-in-touch communications . &quot; There ' s just tremendous pent-up demand for wireless services , &quot; said Mark Lowenstein , director of wireless mobile communications for the Yankee Group , a Boston-based consulting_firm . &quot; Ten years into cellular , we already have 17 million subscribers for a service that doesn ' t work all that well and has tremendously high prices. &quot; Still , NexTel ' s generous deal -- together with the stunning $ 833 million investors bid for government licenses last month for the right to offer new wireless communications services -- has some analysts worried that companies may be reaching too deep into their pockets to get_into a business that remains unproven . &quot; Prices are becoming stratospheric , &quot; said Richard Nespola , who heads the Leawood , Kan.-based telephone consulting_firm Management Network Group Inc. &quot; Things have absolutely gotten_out of hand. &quot; Nevertheless , NexTel -- which earlier this year began offering wireless communications in Los Angeles and a_few other California cities -- could pose a serious threat to the cellular_telephone industry and get_the_jump on new wireless technologies such_as personal communications services . Under the terms of the two agreements , Dial Page shareholders would receive about 28 million shares of NexTel stock , worth about $ 750 million . Motorola , one of the nation ' s leading makers of electronic_communications equipment , would get 62 million NexTel shares -- worth nearly $ 1.7 billion -- for its radio licenses and related specialized mobile radio properties , giving it a 22 % stake in the company .
