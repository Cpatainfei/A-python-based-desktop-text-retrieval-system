   <HEADLINE> A CHANGE IN PERCEPTION ; MAKES ME WANNA HOLLER : A YOUNG BLACK_MAN IN AMERICA , BY NATHAN MCCALL ( RANDOM HOUSE : $ 23 ; 404 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> His girlfriend -- the mother of his child -- had been threatened right in front of his face . Such disrespect called_for swift retaliation . The inevitable confrontation followed , culminated by a bullet that wound_up only an inch from the offender ' s heart . The next shot would surely have been fatal had not a friend intervened and persuaded him not to fire . It is a drama played_out daily in the desperate lives of so many young black_men in America . And because it is so commonplace , this carnage goes unchronicled for the most part now , except in street lore , which compounds the tragedy by elevating the shooter to new status . This particular shooting would have remained unremarkable had not the gunman , Nathan McCall , taken_hold_of his psyche while serving a prison sentence for another crime . After being paroled , McCall returned to college , earned a degree in journalism and now works as a writer at the Washington Post . In his angry , eloquent and powerful biography , &quot; Makes Me Wanna Holler , &quot; McCall remembers that when he fired that bullet into his rival , &quot; I felt_like a God . I felt so good and powerful that I wanted to do_it again. &quot; In a world where young_men from America ' s ghettos and barrios perceive avenues to anything remotely resembling power as irretrievably closed , McCall ' s reaction is all_the more ominous , given the swelling tide of would-be deities slouching toward gun dealers to be born . McCall ' s story is a painfully familiar recitation of a promising black child ' s descent to street fights , burglary , penny-ante stickups , gang rape . But somewhere in a far corner of his consciousness , the spark of_his_own humanity refused to succumb to the sociopath . Long after he had moved beyond his old life of violent crime , McCall ' s prison record hampered his attempts to move_into the American mainstream . He believes the Louisville Courier-Journal changed its mind about hiring him after he told them he was an ex-con . He landed a job on the Virginian Pilot-Ledger Star , where he had interned , after &quot; a tough , close vote &quot; on whether to take him on despite his record . He kept his secret later when the Washington Post decided to take a good look_at him , but lost out on that job when Post editors discovered his record on_their_own . He also didn ' t tell interviewers at the Atlanta Journal-Constitution about his record when he moved there from Virginia . Living_in fear of discovery , he set_about building a solid track record as a reporter , covering city_hall and local politics , traveling abroad on assignment with then-Mayor Andrew Young , looking behind the facades of civil_rights leaders Hosea Williams and Coretta Scott King . After he mustered the courage to tell editor Bill Kovach that he had served time for armed robbery , Kovach ' s only response was : &quot; Is that all ? . . . If anybody gives you ( expletive ) about it , let me know. &quot; End of nightmare . Two years later he found himself with another chance at the &quot; big_time , &quot; winning a spot on the Washington Post ' s staff on his second try . As much as &quot; Holler &quot; is the story of McCall ' s life , it is also an essay on race -- that most enduring of American dilemmas -- and the crippling images that too often burden African American youngsters early on with self-hatred . McCall also passionately challenges a whole litany of simple diagnoses for urban ills , such_as the absence of black fathers . In the working class Cavalier Manor neighborhood of Portsmouth , Va. , where McCall grew_up in the 1960s , families owned their own homes and the fathers were present . &quot; I never heard my friends say they wanted to be like their fathers when they grew_up , &quot; McCall writes . &quot; Why would we want that when we knew our fathers were catching hell ? . . . A two-parent home is no better_off than a single-parent one if the father is ( expletive ) up in the head and beaten_down . There ' s nothing more dangerous and destructive in a household than a frustrated , oppressed black man. &quot; He remembers accompanying his stepfather to do gardening in an affluent suburb and realizing that America has two distinct worlds -- one white and &quot; full of possibilities of life , &quot; and the other &quot; dark and limited. &quot; McCall traces the assault on_his_own self-image to television commercials , racial taunts and fights with white bullies at a newly integrated junior_high_school . He couldn ' t understand being hated at school simply for being black and alive . &quot; I wondered , Where did those white people learn to hate so deeply at such a young age ? I didn ' t know . But , over time , I learned to hate as blindly and viciously as any of them. &quot; For all_of his conflict with whites , he packed his hair with pomade and brushed it mercilessly in a vain attempt to make_it look more white . And dark-skinned girls were avoided in favor of the more desirable , light-complexioned &quot; redbones. &quot; &quot; I realized that we thought we loved sisters but that we actually hated them , &quot; he writes . &quot; We hated them because they were black and we were black and , on some level much deeper than we realized , we hated the hell out of ourselves. &quot; The significance of that racial confusion escaped him as a youngster . He might have made the honor roll in grade_school , but he was increasingly a child of the streets as a teen-ager . He survived shootouts , burglaries , robberies and gang_fights during his high_school years and actually made_it to Norfolk State University before he shot the street thug who threatened his girlfriend . His sentence : 30 days . Later , when he was sentenced to 12 years in prison after robbing a McDonald ' s , he reflected : &quot; I shot and nearly killed Plaz , a black_man , and got a 30-day sentence ; I robbed a white business and didn ' t lay a finger on anybody , and got 12 years . I got the message . I ' d gotten_it all my life : Don ' t ( expletive ) with white folks. &quot; In prison he embraced Malcolm X ' s philosophy that you can change your behavior if you change your self-perception . He also met Jim , an important mentor and role_model -- the first black_man he had met who understood that manhood is more the result of intelligence than some twisted notion of machismo . And he read everything he could get his hands on in the prison library where he worked . Paroled after three years , he returned to Norfolk State , graduated with honors and crossed over into a mainstream world far more predatory than anything he had experienced on the street -- professional journalism . After being hired at the Journal-Constitution , he quickly identified the hypocrisy of newspapers with virtually all-white staffs being so quick to condemn racism . His first assignment : cover a watermelon-eating contest . No less hypocritical were his reporting colleagues who may_not have recognized just how desperately they struggled to cover their own insecurities with tattered cloaks of arrogance . At the Journal-Constitution he also met Danny Baum , a free_spirit whose honesty and fairness made McCall think for the first time that there are fundamentally decent whites . McCall has written a relentlessly honest book , filled with pain , triumph , rage and humor -- high and low . His biography will no doubt disturb many readers who might harbor more idealized notions of how one makes a successful journey up from the marginalized existence of urban streets . For all_of his concessions and appearances of success , McCall still sees himself as &quot; just a tourist in the white mainstream. &quot; And instead of easy answers , he offers this sobering reflection for a nation caught_up in hysteria over crime : Sitting in his closet , collecting dust , are a pair of prison brogans and a pair of penny loafers -- symbols of choices he has rejected . He has put the brogans that could have been his to wear for a lifetime behind him . Yet he was no more comfortable trying to fake it as a preppie in penny loafers . The loafers , he thought , might make white colleagues stop staring at him so_much if they could see that &quot; I ' m not so different. &quot; But he felt &quot; goofy &quot; in the loafers and keeps them &quot; as a testament to the time I almost lost my way in the white mainstream. &quot; Much of McCall ' s journey from the mean streets to the newsroom amounts to the difficult process of recognizing , inventing or exercising choices . Far too many young black_men don ' t see any choices -- no redemption from the devalued lives to which they are assigned . And when there is no redemption , can there be any sin ? &quot; Even when I chose the gutter , I always had a frame_of_reference for a better life , &quot; McCall writes . And he knows that the African American street thugs in Washington who &quot; treat each other like targets on a shooting range &quot; may_not have such a reference . Too many give_in to what McCall calls that &quot; inner hatred that drives them to self destruct. &quot; McCall doesn ' t pretend to have answers_for that self destruction . He ' s fully aware that there is a &quot; younger , meaner generation out there now -- more lost and alienated than we were , and placing even less value on life. &quot; He found himself frightened by younger guys in his old Portsmouth neighborhood , knowing that &quot; if they saw the world as I once did , they believed they had nothing to lose , including life itself. &quot;</TEXT>
