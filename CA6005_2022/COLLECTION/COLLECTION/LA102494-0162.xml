   <HEADLINE> MILITARY DRAFT UNDER FIRE IN LATIN_AMERICA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In Latin_America , where obligatory military_service is a tradition , the draft is under_fire . And in some countries , it ' s a lost cause . Argentina ' s Congress is pushing_through a law to eliminate the draft next year . The Honduran National Assembly passed similar legislation in May . Uruguay and Nicaragua had already done_away_with the draft . And Panama has eliminated its armed forces altogether . Elsewhere , from Guatemala to Chile , the draft is a subject of debate in parliaments and the media . Chilean youth groups have organized protests against obligatory military_service ; Paraguayan legislators are discussing changes in conscription law , and human_rights groups in Guatemala are blowing the whistle on the army ' s abduction-like practice of forced recruitment . In a region once dominated by men in epaulets , generals today have less clout to defend the draft . And some , mindful of examples in Europe and the United States , are beginning to see advantages in downsized , modernized , all-volunteer armies . Public criticism of military_service and the draft was taboo in many Latin_American countries when they were ruled by armed forces in the 1960s and 1970s . In those decades , many of the region ' s armed forces advocated a &quot; national security doctrine , &quot; which they used to justify military intervention in government and ruthless action against Marxist movements perceived as threats to stability . The draft was a way not only to fill military_ranks but also to control and indoctrinate young_men . In the 1980s , military regimes gave_up power in country after country as a wave of democracy swept_through Latin_America . Almost everywhere that they had governed , the armed forces had lost prestige because of human_rights violations , economic mismanagement or corruption . As democracy has taken_root , militaristic policies have come under increasing question . Growing sensitivity to human_rights has further nourished sentiment against conscription and mistreatment of draftees . Meanwhile , Marxist movements have waned and guerrilla wars have wound down or come_to a halt . The Cold_War , which fed both revolutionary action and the doctrine of national security , is over . &quot; This refocuses the subject of the armed forces in society and on the new international scene , &quot; Chilean historian Claudio Fuentes said . &quot; The communist threat is no longer there. &quot; Border disputes between Latin_American countries also have become less volatile as civilian governments have sought to resolve differences diplomatically while strengthening commercial ties . That trend has further reduced the role of the armed forces and the need for the draft . But that does not mean the draft is heading for extinction in all countries of the region , Fuentes said . Military establishments still exert strong influence in some countries , and many generals still hold_on to the draft as a hallowed tradition . Also , where military budgets are too small to support a professional , volunteer army , low-paid draftees are sometimes seen as a necessity . The current controversy over the draft in some countries , therefore , centers more on how obligatory service can be reformed than on whether it might be eliminated . In some countries , reforms have already been made . Brazil , for example , has become the only country in Latin_America with legislation that permits alternative civilian service for conscientious_objectors . The provision was written into Brazil ' s 1988 constitution , enacted four years after the armed forces left power . Since the mid-1980s , military_service throughout the region has endured the worst beating perhaps in this century : Uruguay abolished the draft in the late 1980s ; Nicaragua did the same after President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro took_office in 1990 . In Honduras , President Carlos Reina won congressional approval in May for a bill to eliminate obligatory military_service . &quot; Citizens between the ages of 18 and 30 will join the military_service voluntarily in time of peace , under the modality of an educational , social , humanist and democratic system , &quot; the new provision says . &quot; Five years ago this would have been impossible , &quot; said Victor Meza , a Honduran political analyst . &quot; This is symptomatic_of the consolidation of civil society. &quot; As legislators voted on the draft ban , young Hondurans held a hunger_strike outside Congress to demand its passage . It passed unanimously but must be ratified by the next legislative session in 1995 . Panama became the second Latin_American country to abolish its army with the Legislative_Assembly ' s final approval Oct . 5 of a constitutional amendment . In practice , the Panamanian Defense Force had ceased to exist after the December , 1989 , U.S. invasion that removed Gen . Manuel A . Noriega . Costa Rica ' s army was abolished in 1949 by the late President Jose ( Pepe ) Figueres , father of President Jose Maria Figueres . In Argentina , the army had planned a gradual transition from obligatory to voluntary military_service as part of a modernization program . Then , this spring , a draftee was reported to have been beaten to death in an artillery regiment . The scandal consolidated public_opinion against the draft . Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem , seeing political advantage in following popular sentiment , sent a bill to Congress to abolish the draft in 1995 . The bill passed the lower house Sept . 21 ; approval by the Senate is expected soon . Fuentes said it is unlikely that Chile will follow Argentina ' s example in replacing the draft with an all-volunteer force . &quot; The military has said it is impossible because of the cost , &quot; he said . And the civilian defense minister , Edmundo Perez Yoma , has said the administration of Chilean President Eduardo Frei supports obligatory military_service . But Chile ' s anti-draft movement is more active than ever . Jose Sabat , a Chilean university_student and president of the non-governmental Youth Rights Commission , helped organize a protest against the draft Sept . 19 , the day of Chile ' s annual military parade . Society must discuss &quot; the elimination of the obligatory nature of military_service , &quot; protesters said in a statement . Sabat acknowledged in an interview , however , that hardly anyone sees elimination of the draft as a realistic goal for now in Chile , where former dictator Gen . Augusto Pinochet still commands the army . Political and human_rights activists are concentrating_on such reforms as conscientious_objector status , alternative service and reduction of service time . Two Socialist members of the Congress introduced a bill at the end of July to reform draft laws . In many Latin_American countries , it is not difficult for middle- and upper-class youths to avoid the draft . Many Chileans obtain exemptions with questionable doctor ' s certificates . Others receive student deferments and are never called_up again . In all , only about a quarter of all draft-age youths are inducted ; most of them are from Chile ' s working class . In Mexico , obligatory service is also loosely enforced . &quot; A lot of people get_out of it by paying someone else to do_it for them , or by paying some lieutenant , &quot; said Roderic Camp , a professor at Tulane University in New Orleans who has written_about the Mexican army . In several of the region ' s poorer countries , the draft exists legally but is not actually used . Peru and the Dominican_Republic , for example , fill the draft quota each year with jobless volunteers who have little education and see the army as a way to survive and perhaps learn useful disciplines and skills . Times special correspondents Steven Ambrus in Bogota , Colombia , and Eduard Orlebar in Guatemala contributed to this report , as did Susan Drummet of The Times ' Mexico_City Bureau.LATIN AME</TEXT>
