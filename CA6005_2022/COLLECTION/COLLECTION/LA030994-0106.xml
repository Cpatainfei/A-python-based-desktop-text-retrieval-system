   <TEXT> Brazil Legislators Tinker With Economic Plan : Congress has proposed several changes to a major part of Economy Minister Fernando Henrique Cardoso ' s economic program . Among the proposed changes to the measure that created an anti-inflation wage and price_index -- known as the Unit of Real Value -- are provisions for a sharp increase in the minimum_wage , automatic salary hikes whenever inflation exceeds 5 % and a freeze on basic food prices . The government says some proposed changes could kill the plan ' s chances of success , and Cardoso has threatened to step_down if the measure is drastically altered .</TEXT>
