   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / QUARTERFINALS ; FOR BRAZIL , A WINNING NUMBER ? ; SOCCER : AMID COMPLAINTS BY ROMARIO ABOUT MIDFIELD PLAY , TEAM TRIES TO KEEP IN STEP AGAINST A DANGEROUS NETHERLANDS SQUAD .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mario Jorge Lobo Zagalo has the cure for triskaidekaphobia , the fear of the number 13 . Brazil ' s assistant coach likes the number . The way he figures it , 13 is going_to play a major role at the Cotton Bowl today when Brazil plays the_Netherlands in the feature game of the World Cup quarterfinals . Twenty years ago , it had no effect at all . Holland defeated Brazil in the ' 74 semifinals in West Germany , 2-0 . Zagalo was Brazil ' s coach . But usually the number game ends positively for Zagalo . He played_on the great Brazilian teams that won world championships in 1958 and ' 62 . The ' 58 title , he can readily explain . &quot; Five plus eight equals 13 , &quot; he says . Then in 1967 , the left winger helped lead Botafogo of Rio de Janeiro to the national title . &quot; Six plus seven equals 13 , &quot; he says of the year . He was coach of Brazil ' s 1970 championship team , another aberration in Zagalo ' s strange world of figures . And now ? &quot; Add_up the letters of Holland and Brazil and you get 13 , &quot; he says . &quot; Nobody likes 13 , but I like it. &quot; Whether Zagalo ' s superstitions make any difference is debatable . He failed to mention this is World Cup ' 94 , and nine plus four also equals 13 . In a match of this magnitude , every little bit counts . Brazil ( 3-0-1 ) will begin today ' s game with unrest , but that ' s nothing new . Romario , the team ' s great striker and greater talker , has been running_off at the mouth as much as around the practice field . He has continued his tirade about the midfielders not getting him the ball enough . Dunga , Mazinho and the others have become frustrated by the accusations . They are playing the way Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira tells them , and Romario , the mouth that scored , cannot change that . The stress of going_for a fourth world championship has been evident . Rai , who again will be replaced in the midfield , was told of the change in front of teammates Friday . Not one to complain , Rai said Parreira embarrassed him . It ' s not quite a team in turmoil , but Brazil ' s squabbling makes Dutch Coach Dick Advocaat smile . Not that he is saying anything . Holland is trying to play it cool in the oppressive North Texas heat . With temperatures expected in the high 90s , Brazil thinks it will have a big advantage . The Dutch say they can handle heat after playing in the sauna of Orlando and Washington during first-round action . &quot; I hope it is going_to be even warmer because Brazil can handle it better than the Dutch , &quot; Bebeto said after Friday ' s practice . &quot; It ' s going_to be very difficult for the Dutch to follow the Brazilian rhythm of playing. &quot; Parreira said the other day in Addison , Tex. , that the heat will be a major factor_in the outcome . He said Brazil will try to use its superior technical skills to control the ball . &quot; We have to conserve energy , go_for the short passes , &quot; he said . &quot; There is no other way to cope_with the heat. &quot; Romario , as usual , was more pointed in talking_about the heat and FC Barcelona teammate Ronald Koeman , a Dutch defender . &quot; I know him , &quot; Romario said . &quot; With the heat in Dallas , in the second_half he won ' t survive. &quot; Advocaat dismissed the remarks , saying Romario was simply trying to motivate Brazil . Instead of worrying about what Romario is saying , Koeman is concerned with his ballhandling and shooting . Holland ' s captain , Koeman will play a pivotal role in trying to stop the dazzling forward . &quot; It is impossible to mark him very well for the whole match , &quot; he said . &quot; He has so_much speed and he is very fast the first few meters . Bebeto is also very dangerous. &quot; Romario did praise defender Stan Valckx . Romario and Valckx are friends and former teammates on a Dutch club . &quot; I know I ' ll be in a real match_playing against him , &quot; Romario said . &quot; Holland will try to play against us , and that ' s better for us. &quot; The Dutch will try to launch an assault led by Dennis Bergkamp , Peter van Vossen and Marc Overmars . If clicking , Holland ( 3-1 ) can be devastating , which will not be better for Romario and Brazil . &quot; We have to play our game , and that is to attack , &quot; said Ed De Goey , Holland ' s goalkeeper . &quot; That is always the spirit of the Dutch team. &quot; The spirit of Brazil is questionable . It has not won convincingly except in a 3-0 victory over Cameroon in first-round play . It reached the quarterfinals by defeating the United States , 1-0 , on Monday . The Netherlands also struggled in the first round and lost to Belgium , 1-0 , in Orlando . But the Dutch were devastating in their 2-0 victory over Ireland in last weekend ' s second round . Unlike Brazil , the_Netherlands was not considered a strong contender for the Cup . Thus , Brazil is facing intense pressure , particularly from a soccer-mad populace that demands excellence . How does Parreira handle it ? &quot; There ' s no way to hide , so you just have to face them and then do what you think is right , &quot; he said . Even if it means finding a combination that adds_to 13 . Times staff writer Helene Elliott contributed to story . * SORCERY AFOOT ? Forward Ilie Dumitrescu is yet another Romanian with seemingly magical_abilities .</TEXT>
