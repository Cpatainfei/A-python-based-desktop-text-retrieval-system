   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; AT THE HEART OF COMPUTER MODELING ; DESIGN : NEW PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO HELP CREATE ARTIFICIAL CARDIAC VALVES AND POSSIBLY EVEN ENTIRE REPLACEMENT HEARTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three-dimensional computer models of cars and airplanes and other expensive machines are old hat for industrial designers , but only recently have scientists built such a computer model for the most sophisticated mechanical_device of them all : the human heart . Developed by two researchers at New York University , the new heart model is intended initially to help in the design of artificial_heart valves . Eventually , doctors might be able to use it to examine your heartbeat and other cardiac functions while you ' re out on the golf_course -- or even to build you a new heart . &quot; Given the right parameters , we can painlessly model any heart we like -- any shape , any size , &quot; said David McQueen , a computational scientist and mechanical_engineer at NYU ' s Courant Institute and one of the heart ' s developers . &quot; The model is a very versatile and valuable engineering tool which will help design any artificial device to be used in the heart , including possibly an entirely artificial heart. &quot; McQueen and colleague Charles Peskin acknowledge that they have a long way to go before they can design complete hearts on a computer . Many aspects of heart functioning are not yet fully understood , and a computer model can only be as_good_as the scientific_knowledge used to create it . But the model is expected to be quite useful for designing heart_valves , enabling scientists to create a sort of computerized test chamber for mechanical designs that cannot be tested in the real_world without putting someone ' s life at risk . For decades , manufacturers and designers have relied_on trial_and_error to build artificial valves , and that has sometimes brought trouble . In the 1980s , some valves produced by Irvine-based Shiley began to fracture , resulting in deaths and numerous lawsuits against the company . &quot; Valves that are currently available have been designed empirically , and there has not really been an opportunity to design them in a more systematic way , &quot; said Peskin , a physiologist and mathematician . Applying the laws of fluid mechanics to all that is known about the anatomy of the heart and the physiology of the muscle , the researchers created a model that simulates the mechanical functions of the heart , such_as contractions of the muscle , blood flow and the opening and shutting of the valves . The model consists_of a grid -- a regular cubic lattice -- with fluid mechanics , through which run rubber-band-like muscular fibers that ordinarily make_up the heart and its pumping function . The scientists say the key to the process is a computational method they devised to determine the pattern and volume of the flow of blood inside the heart chambers , with valves posing as flexible barriers . The idea is to quantify the interaction of a flexible object -- the heart_valve -- with the fluid into which it is immersed -- the blood . The researchers call it the Immersed Boundary Technique . Already , they have designed a cardiac_valve with curved leaflets intended to alleviate clotting , a serious problem encountered when artificial devices come_in contact with blood . An existing artificial valve design , which is quite successful , uses two flat leaflets . &quot; We studied this in the computer and found that it could become better in various ways if we curved the leaflets . We used the computer to determine how curved they should be , &quot; Peskin said . The NYU group has received some inquiries from companies about using the system to improve on existing valves , but McQueen declined to divulge details . There are about half_a_dozen manufacturers of artificial valves , with worldwide demand totaling about 200 # 000 units a year .</TEXT>
