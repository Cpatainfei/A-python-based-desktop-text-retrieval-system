HOPKINS Hollywood Three years ago , we found the solution to seasickness : &quot; Sea Bands. &quot; They are wristlets that use acupressure to stop motion_sickness . My husband suffers from motion_sickness , so going_for a boat ride was out_of_the_question . He couldn ' t read on an airplane . The &quot; Sea Bands &quot; have made travel and reading possible . DONALDA ALDER Garden Grove I have a cure for motion_sickness that really sounds silly , but it works . Years ago , I was sailing from Acapulco and I was_sick before we even got_out of the harbor . A young_man told me to lie on my stomach . It worked . As long as I laid on my stomach I was OK . As soon as I raised_up I was_sick again . I have tested this many times and I have told others as they were beginning to get sick . They tried it and it worked . BARBARA MAPLE Newport Beach</TEXT>
