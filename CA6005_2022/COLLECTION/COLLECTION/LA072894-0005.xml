   <HEADLINE> THE ATTACKS ON ISRAELIS AND JEWS ; BUT FROM THE RAVAGES OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM , NO ONE IS IMMUNE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> No credible claim of responsibility has yet been made in the wake of recent terrorist attacks on Israelis and Jews in Argentina , Panama and Britain . But the inference to be drawn from these atrocities is clear . Certainly by no coincidence , the attacks came as the leaders of Jordan and Israel met in Washington to proclaim an end to their long state_of_war . But peace between Israel and its Arab neighbors has its sworn enemies , and it ' s no secret that plotting against peace goes_on in Tehran as well as in the capitals of a number of radical Arab regimes . Terrorism is the method of these plotters , and the entire world is their arena . The two car-bomb attacks in London this week , one directed against the Israeli Embassy , a second against a building housing Israeli and Jewish organizations , have prompted Britain ' s police -- long on_the_alert because of bombings by the radical Irish_Republican_Army -- to greatly tighten security around Israeli and Jewish facilities vulnerable to terrorists ' attacks . In the United States , including Los Angeles , a similar intensification of protective measures has taken_place . But Israel has diplomatic , trade and transport missions in more_than 100 countries , not all_of them with the kind of security resources that Britain or this country can commit in response to the new threat . Bombs are easily made and transported . In greater or lesser degree such overseas Israeli facilities have always been exposed to terrorist attack . The campaign that now appears to have been launched raises the level of risk . Moreover , as the attacks in Buenos Aires , Panama and London again showed , it is not only Israelis but Jews as a group who are being targeted , once more giving lie to the claim that the fight being waged by Muslim extremists is only against Israel . Terrorist groups are difficult to penetrate . But intelligence agencies of a number of countries have learned much in recent years about what organizations and individuals to watch , and international cooperation has improved . Obviously , room for further improvement exists . As the murdered and maimed citizens of Argentina , Panama and Britain attest , terrorism is truly an international menace .</TEXT>
