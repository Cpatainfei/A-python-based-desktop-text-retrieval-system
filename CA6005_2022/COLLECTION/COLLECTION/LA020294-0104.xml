   <HEADLINE> METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF : QUAKE DELIVERS KNOCKOUT_PUNCH TO OKIE GIRL EATERY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Promoting a restaurant in the remote Tejon Pass wasn ' t easy , but the &quot; Okie Girl &quot; went at it with aspirations higher than her hairdo . Mary Lynn Chess , 54 , who opened the Okie Girl barbecue restaurant and brewery in 1990 alongside Interstate 5 about 70 miles north of Los Angeles , could turn everything from a minor skirmish with a state agency to a local look-alike contest into a media event . And when the Christo &quot; Umbrellas &quot; art_exhibition landed in the nearby mountains in 1991 , television crews from around the world lined_up to interview the Oklahoma-born entrepreneur with the towering beehive hairdo who could discuss moonshine and the latest in computerized restaurant equipment with equal aplomb . The one thing the tireless Chess could not stand was to be ignored . That is what has happened since the earthquake , and it has proved fatal for her Okie Girl restaurant in Lebec , on the Los Angeles-Kern County border . Chess and her crew served their last &quot; pasture and pond &quot; special ( barbecued beef ribs and catfish ) and homemade blackberry cobbler a week ago Sunday . With freeway traffic disrupted by quake damage in the northeastern San Fernando Valley , business plunged to about three customers an hour , Chess said , and she had no cash reserves to weather the crisis . Chess had 13 full-time employees , including a brew master who turned_out &quot; River_Bottom Stout &quot; and other beers amid the knotty_pine and Old West-decor of the restaurant . Chess may be_best known for her quarrel with Caltrans , which refused to allow her to advertise on state-controlled signs beside the highway , saying the restaurant ' s name insulted Oklahomans . &quot; If anybody has a right to call themselves an Okie , I do , &quot; protested Chess , a native daughter of the Sooner State . &quot; I ' m proud_of it and I always have been. &quot; She clinched her argument when the Oklahoma governor wrote to Caltrans in her defense , officially declaring that , whatever Californians might think , Oklahomans wear the name &quot; Okie &quot; as a badge of honor , symbolizing their &quot; strong work ethic , character and resiliency. &quot; Caltrans not only backed_down on the sign , a court later ordered the agency to pay her $ 32 # 000 in punitive damages .
