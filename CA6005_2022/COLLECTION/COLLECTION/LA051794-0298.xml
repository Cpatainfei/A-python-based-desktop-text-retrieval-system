   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS : IRVINE ; FAIR TO RAISE FUNDS FOR FOOTBALL_TEAMS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Cross-town football rivals will team_up next month when players and coaches from three high_schools sponsor a carnival aimed at raising money for their cash-strapped programs . The Tri-School Fair will take_place June 3-5 and is being organized by football_teams from Irvine , Woodbridge and University high_schools . The teams are fierce competitors on the field , but boosters said that all three need money . &quot; We found that all schools had the same financial needs , &quot; said University High parent Linda Sonnonstine . &quot; We decided to join forces rather than do_it separately. &quot; High_school football programs receive limited financial_support from the school district , forcing boosters and the players themselves to pay_for most of the teams ' expenses . The cost of one football_player ' s expenses for one season is about $ 1 # 250 , said John Encheff , a University High football booster . Organizers hope to raise about $ 20 # 000 during the three-day_event , which will take_place near the Civic Center off Harvard Avenue . The fair will include carnival rides , food and music . Admission is $ 3 . Information : ( 714 ) 854-8809 . Encheff and other boosters said they doubt the teams ' cooperation during the fund-raiser will soften their actions during the big_games . &quot; The players ( from the different schools ) all go_to the same places at night , attend the same dances , &quot; he said . &quot; But that all stops on the football_field . There is a lot of rivalry in the city of Irvine. &quot; SHELBY GRAD</TEXT>
