   <TEXT> Fumiaki Kuraishi has every material_possession he could want : a 1991 Nissan car , a new refrigerator and washing machine , three televisions , two stereos , a videocassette_recorder , a computer and word_processor -- all crammed into the home he shares with his wife and two children . But as the worst recession in two decades continues to cast a long , lingering shadow over Japan , Kuraishi says the heady materialism of the recent past is , for him , passe . &quot; I ' m a little tired_of finding new electronic gadgets , &quot; the 50-year-old government economist said . &quot; I want to change my habits from spending to more spiritual satisfaction. &quot; So Kuraishi has sought inspiration by reading the works of renowned educator Yukichi Fukuzawa and others born in the late Edo era . Although the Edo -- from 1603 to 1868 -- may be_best known for the Tokugawa shogunate ' s foreign isolation and feudalistic repression , it also was a time of unparalleled peace and the blossoming of a vibrant , distinctive Japanese culture . &quot; We inherited many habits and ways of thinking from the Japanese in the Edo era , &quot; Kuraishi said . &quot; By reading these older books , I found I can understand present Japan better. &quot; As uncertainty and recession grip a land where many have sated material appetites during a long economic boom , experts say more Japanese are seeking lifestyles rooted in simplicity and spiritual wealth . Advertising giant Dentsu calls it a shift from &quot; valuing the tangible to the intangible. &quot; The Japan External Trade Organization , in a new report on the Japanese in the 1990s , says the economic downturn , wide disgust at political corruption and boredom with excessive consumption have led many to seek a life &quot; with emphasis on moderation , quality rather than quantity and spiritual satisfaction. &quot; The paths toward more psychically enriching lives are diverse , ranging from nature activities to volunteerism to self-help seminars . But some , like Kuraishi , are exploring their roots -- in particular , the lifestyle , arts , culture and economy of the Edo . Books on the period , many recasting the former feudalistic image into a more creative one of simple living and cultural innovation , enjoy brisk sales ; a plethora of new titles describe everything from Edo energy and technology to exorcists and cuisine . Eisuke Ishikawa has written five books in the last seven years on the Edo but says they only began selling well in 1993 -- hitting the 20 # 000 mark , unusual for the genre . Ishikawa and other authors depict the Edo as a dynamic time in which the Japanese lived_in harmony with nature , using solar_energy and vegetable_oil , recycling everything from ash to straw slippers . This portrayal has caught the public fancy as a potential trove of lessons for modern Japan . &quot; The trend was started before the bubble burst , but it was probably intensified by it , &quot; said Tessa Morris-Suzuki , a senior fellow in Japanese history at Australian National University in Canberra , who recently analyzed the Edo book trend . &quot; At one level , it ' s a fad . But at another level , it ' s an important part of the debate about Japanese identity : how Japan will define its identity now that it has caught_up_with the West . &quot; Now Japan is trying to find its own models within itself , &quot; Morris-Suzuki said . &quot; Edo is seen as a model , because it was the last period before Japan got heavily Westernized . So there is the idea that ' This was pure Japan , the way we were , the world we lost. ' &quot; The period produced much of what is typically associated with Japan , from ukiyoe woodblock prints to brilliant Basho haiku poetry . For those overdosed on materialism , the traditional Japanese aesthetic offers a soothing balance of understatement and tranquillity . At the same time , its popular culture , including sumo wrestling and Kabuki , offer raucous escape . ( The rich development of arts and leisure was promoted partly by more_than 250 years of internal peace . But it also grew out of the need to entertain thousands of samurai , who were forced to travel yearly to Edo -- the former name for Tokyo -- to pay homage to Tokugawa shoguns , who found the costly trips a handy way to prevent regional lords from acquiring excessive wealth and power. ) Today , Kabuki -- the highly stylized art_form that combines dance and drama and that has typically attracted older audiences -- is drawing younger fans who have helped the theater record sellouts . Sanae Hirama , 23 , began attending performances last year ; her frequent encounters with foreigners sparked a desire to explore her roots . A specialist in French literature who has been abroad five times , she was embarrassed at not being able to answer questions about Kabuki , geisha and ukiyoe . Traditional music collections are enjoying record sales ; tea ceremony and other cultural classes are gaining new followers . The government ' s 1993 Leisure White_Paper reported a 15.8 % increase in participation in calligraphy and a 4.8 % increase in tea ceremony in 1992 over the previous year . Seibu , the retail and transportation conglomerate that is one of the nation ' s quickest trend-spotters , two years ago began a special &quot; Japan Is Good &quot; series of classes at the community_college it operates in the Ikebukuro district of Tokyo . Many of the classes , ranging from tea and Kabuki appreciation to samurai art , have waiting lists . The city ' s ultimate monument to the life of the era , the new Tokyo Edo Museum , has drawn more_than 2 million people -- double the number projected -- since opening in March . The cavernous museum features displays such_as a life-size Kabuki theater replica , merchants ' quarters , the famous Yoshiwara pleasure district , woodblock prints and the nagaya , or long rows of connected houses that gave Edo village life its distinctive communal feel . For Tomie Sekiguchi , 51 , the row_houses stirred a nostalgia for a warm community life , in which families and neighbors traded gossip , laughter and meals ; she rarely finds such camaraderie in this bustling 21st-Century city , where many complain that they live surprisingly isolated existences . At the same time , she said , seeing the magnificent workmanship of Edo pottery underscored the wastefulness of modern society , where &quot; everything is so cheap you just throw it away. &quot; &quot; During Edo , people really treasured things and kept them for a long_time , &quot; Sekiguchi said . &quot; Although they were poor , the family life was very warm . I want to pass these teachings on to my children. &quot; Spokesman Masaichi Sugaya attributed the museum ' s unexpected popularity to the societal reflection that he says is occurring as_many Japanese search for their next goal , now that material needs have been fulfilled . &quot; A lot of people are wondering what kind of lifestyle to lead from now , &quot; he said . &quot; Amid the Edo boom , as they look_into the past , they are groping_for answers. &quot; A cultural revival of sorts is also occurring with food . Displacing Thai and Italian cuisines , 1993 ' s hottest trend was yatai mura , or colorful stalls selling down-home Japanese cooking , such_as shrimp pancakes and boiled vegetables . Hirano Hisawa , a 33-year-old restaurateur , last year put_up a food village in the Ikebukuro district , offering lively wooden stalls illuminated with red paper lanterns . His aim : to revive the flavor of old Tokyo and offer cheap , filling food amid the recession ' s gloom . The village attracts crowds and long lines every night ; his monthly revenue of $ 270 # 000 is running 50 % higher than predictions . This year , he plans to open another food village in the nearby Okubo district with a stage for traditional plays and comedy and an area to demonstrate the art of pounding rice cakes . Masako Yamazawa , a teacher waiting in_line , said she came_back to the food village not only because the recession has curtailed her spending but because she enjoys the rare , old-Tokyo flavor amid Ikebukuro ' s skyscrapers , department_stores and ubiquitous fast-food joints . When the Japanese stay home and read , they also encounter the Edo influence , experts say . The top buzzword of 1993 , according to an annual poll of the mass media here , was seihin , which translates as &quot; honest poverty. &quot; It was popularized by the runaway bestseller &quot; Seihin no Shiso , &quot; which examines the lives of 15 painters , scholars , monks and other paragons in the Edo and other periods and urges Japanese to end their mindless materialism . Author Koji Nakano had been hammering the same theme in 40 books for 25 years , but most of his works sold about 10 # 000 copies each . In 1993 , however , his &quot; Seihin &quot; sold 700 # 000 copies in a success that startled the publishing world and made him a national celebrity . Nakano said that reflection is occurring not only in Japan but also in Europe and America , as industrialized nations seek ways to reconcile their voracious consumption and production with their limited natural_resources . If the United States has its Puritan ethic to draw upon for answers , Japan has the Edo , he said . Sarai , a magazine devoted to finding simple pleasures in Japanese history and tradition , was a surprising success among the many new publications launched during the &quot; bubble era &quot; of exploding prosperity . As other magazines on real-estate and other material themes floundered with the recession ' s onset , Sarai has doubled its circulation , to 350 # 000 in 1993 from 170 # 000 , when it first started in 1989 as a deliberate counterpoint to &quot; the bubble ' s &quot; excesses . Recent issues have featured the art of cultivating bonsai , living_in modern nagaya row_houses and good-luck totems . The largest group of readers are in their 50s -- people who devoted their lives to rebuilding Japan into an economic titan . &quot; Until now , people have not had the time to look_at themselves ; they ' ve just been busy running , &quot; said Satoshi Iwamoto , Sarai editor . &quot; Now they ' re coming_back to the basics. &quot; That is exactly what one Tokyo publishing employee has been yearning to do . She is bored with spending_money . During the prosperous days , she bought the most expensive perfume , ordered the most lavish French cuisine , took fancy vacations and accumulated a house filled with the latest electronic gadgetry . Now there is nothing left she wants to buy . Since the economy crashed , she does not feel_like spending in the gloomy environment anyway . So what does she seek next ? &quot; Tranquillity , &quot; she said . &quot; I want to go_to a faraway temple that no one knows about , sit in a bamboo forest with moss-covered rocks and drink tea from a beautiful Japanese cup. &quot; To pursue that quiet time for herself , she is thinking_of taking_up calligraphy . But her husband , a computer specialist , is still happily spending . And Dentsu , even as it proclaims an era when the intangible will be valued , notes that more_than 80 % of people recently surveyed still had something they wanted to buy . As Japan Monitor put it : People want simpler lifestyles , not simple ones . The move toward simplicity , in fact , could be bad news for the lagging economy , which is depending_on consumer demand to revive itself . The Japan Economic Research Assn . estimates that a 5 % decrease in consumption would push the economy down to zero or negative growth . Fujitsu Chairman Takuma Yamamoto is blunt in critiquing the &quot; honest poverty &quot; movement : &quot; This is the thinking of social dropouts . As a businessman , the ideal is to earn enough money and consume to some extent . Nobody wants to live not getting things you want. &quot; Some people also worry that Edo nostalgia could spark a worrisome nationalism or a trend toward that era ' s sakoku , or isolationism . But no one is talking_about shutting the world out , as if such a thing could be done . Shinji Kuroki , 26 , and Hajime Hosoda , 22 , may eschew the guitar and choose to study biwa , a Japanese-style mandolin . They may say that playing the biwa gives them a greater feeling of peace than Western instruments and better suits the Japanese language in which they sing of great battles between the Heike and the Genji clans . But as they practice in a tatami room ( one with bamboo mats ) with their teacher , Yukihiro Goto , they mix their ancient instrument with the accordion and meld the traditional rhythms with the modern influences of jazz and rock . Masayuki Kurokawa , an architect , has also returned to his roots by designing works such_as teahouses , instead of the exclusively Western buildings of his past . But he retains a blend of old and new , combining washi paper with computer_graphics in his latest design . Kurokawa and others say that if the search for spiritual enrichment leads many back to their cultural roots , all_the better : It will help Japan and the world comprehend each other . &quot; It ' s not nationalism , &quot; he said . &quot; If you can love Japan , you can love the world . By questioning who we are , we can deepen international understanding. &quot; Chiaki Kitada of The Times ' Tokyo Bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
