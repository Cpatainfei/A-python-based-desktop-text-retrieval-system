   <HEADLINE> SKIING / WORLD CUP_FINALS ; MOE LOOKS FOR RESPECT TO GO WITH STARDOM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Obviously not satisfied with mere Olympic glory , American Tommy Moe enters the World Cup_finals this week with a chance to prove he is a fixture in Alpine skiing , not a fluke . Moe , winner of gold and silver medals at the Lillehammer Olympics , is looking_to become the first American to win an individual World Cup title since Phil Mahre in 1983 . With his first World Cup victory at Whistler , Canada , last weekend , Moe moved to within 47 points of Luxembourg ' s Marc Girardelli in the super-G standings . Mahre won his title in giant slalom . While Olympic victories make stars , respect among skiers is attained through achievements on the World Cup circuit , where champions are determined based on consistent performances throughout the season . Moe is not content with flash-in-the-pan success . The 24-year-old from Girdwood , Alaska , proved it last weekend by finishing third in the Whistler downhill on Saturday and winning the super-G on Sunday . Moe leads a world-class field into the final week of World Cup competition , which begins today with a downhill , followed by a super-G Thursday , a giant slalom on Saturday and a slalom on Sunday . Unlike the Olympics , men and women compete on the same day in each event . In disciplines where World Cup point totals are close , final races will determine the champions in the four events -- downhill , super-G , GS and slalom -- and perhaps the overall winner . Norway ' s Kjetil Andre Aamodt holds a comfortable points lead over Girardelli in the men ' s overall standings , but the women ' s race between Switzerland ' s Vreni Schneider and Sweden ' s Pernilla Wiberg is close , with the winner to be determined this week . Moe , with his most recent victory , moved to seventh in the overall standings and has a legitimate chance to overtake Girardelli in the super-G . &quot; I ' m refocused , &quot; Moe said after finishing third in Tuesday ' s downhill training run . &quot; I want to put_on a good show for the home crowd . I ' m confident now . I ' ve had five top-threes this season and any time I get_in the start in downhill or super-G , I feel I can win. &quot; Skiing Notes A total of $ 220 # 000 prize_money will be awarded this week . The money breakdown for each race : $ 16 # 500 for first , $ 8 # 250 for second and $ 2 # 750 for third . . . . The top 20 skiers in each discipline are guaranteed starts in the finals based on World Cup points . Defending Olympic champions are also invited , which saved super-G gold medalist Diann Roffe-Steinrotter of the United States , who would not have qualified otherwise . Also receiving invitations are Junior World and Europa Cup champions , the top three finishers in the NorAm series championships , and World Cup skiers who have amassed more_than 400 World Cup points . As it stands , Olympic silver medalist Picabo Street is only eligible to ski today ' s downhill , but could surpass the 400-point mark with a good performance , which would qualify her for Thursday ' s super-G . . . Luxembourg ' s Marc Girardelli probably will not catch Kjetil Andre Aamodt to win an unprecedented sixth World Cup overall championship , but he is the points leader in both downhill and super-G .</TEXT>
