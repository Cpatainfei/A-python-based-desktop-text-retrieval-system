   <HEADLINE> FLEISS TRIAL BEGINS WITH LITTLE FANFARE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was an event that was supposed to be the sexiest trial of the year , exposing the bedroom antics of Tinseltown power mongers and a slew of wanna-bes . But in a town where celebrity can be instant and its loss can occur in half that time , alleged Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss has clearly lost much of her draw . Amid subdued fanfare and much security , jury selection began Downtown on Monday in the criminal case against Fleiss , who has pleaded not_guilty to charges of pandering and possession of cocaine for_sale . &quot; Heidi who ? &quot; quipped John North , the Channel 7 correspondent covering the real news in town , the double-homicide trial of football hall of famer O.J. Simpson two doors away in the Downtown Criminal_Courts Building . It ' s not Simpson . It ' s not Michael Jackson . It ' s not even Tonya Harding . &quot; It ' s not meritorious of our coverage , &quot; sniffed Kristin Jeannette-Meyers , an anchor for Court TV . &quot; I mean , what is it really ? It ' s just sleazy. &quot; Fleiss , 28 , faces_up to 12 years in prison if convicted . She was arrested more_than a year ago after she allegedly provided cocaine and four prostitutes to a Japanese businessman who turned_out to be an undercover Beverly Hills police_officer . Touted as the alleged &quot; madam to the stars , &quot; profiled in the New Yorker , the green-eyed brunette was catapulted into the spotlight . Interest only heightened with speculation that Fleiss might eventually open her &quot; black_book , &quot; disclosing names of clients who allegedly included entertainment_industry executives , producers and jet-set glitterati . But the story of a football idol accused of killing his wife and her friend eclipsed the tale of the alleged Hollywood madam . To some , Fleiss became less exotic this summer when she -- along with her father -- was charged with the everyday sins of money_laundering and tax_evasion . &quot; Sex and murder are not comparable_to sex and income_tax evasion -- it ' s not nearly as dramatic or compelling , &quot; said Melanie Lomax , a civil_rights attorney not connected with the case . Fleiss and her father , Paul Fleiss , 60 , a pediatrician , were arrested in August on federal charges of tax_evasion and money_laundering -- hiding hundreds of thousands of dollars made by the daughter ' s prostitution ring , prosecutors alleged . In September , Fleiss was arrested and admitted to a drug rehabilitation_program after tests indicated that she used stimulants and depressants . &quot; When she went_into drug rehab , it took her down a peg , &quot; said Harlan Braun , a well-known defense_attorney who is not involved in Fleiss ' case . &quot; It turns_out she ' s probably just a dope addict as opposed to a daughter of a prominent pediatrician . Then the pediatrician was indicted along with her , so it sounds like a much less exotic story . Now it turns_out she ' s a dope addict , daughter of an indicted pediatrician. &quot; But at Department 105 in Superior_Court on Monday , Fleiss ' case was handled with all_the trimmings of a quasi-high-profile event . Access to the courtroom was severely restricted . A court-issued press packet was distributed to a_few waiting reporters . Inside the courtroom of Judge Judith L . Champagne , a bespectacled Fleiss entered clad in a conservative blue suit . As she walked in , one prospective juror was overheard whispering to another , &quot; Yup , that ' s her . Check her out. &quot; In an effort to select a jury for Fleiss ' trial , a 15-page questionnaire was handed_out to 65 prospective jurors , and court was adjourned until next week so lawyers could review the responses . ( In Simpson ' s case , 1 # 000 prospective jurors were summoned ; about a third of them were asked to fill_out 79-page questionnaires. ) All_in all , it was a quiet day in Department 105 . &quot; Everything went smoothly this morning , &quot; said Fleiss ' attorney Donald Marks , who said the absence of a media circus made the day easier on his client . Unlike the Simpson case , after the court proceedings attorneys held no news_conferences . The biggest excitement was the unexpected appearance of miniskirted Norma Jean Almodovar , a former LAPD civilian traffic controller arrested for pandering 10 years ago . Almodovar stepped_in front of the cameras to explain that she had attended Fleiss ' proceeding to show support . &quot; It ' s consensual sex , it ' s nobody ' s business , &quot; said Almodovar , author of the book &quot; Cop to Call Girl. &quot; &quot; I ' m here to make_sure she gets a fair trial . . . . In California , there ' s a tremendous prejudice against people in the sex industry. &quot;</TEXT>
