   <TEXT> Four men hobbled on board the coal barge that carried the first seven leprosy patients to a new hospital upriver from New Orleans . Two women and a man couldn ' t walk . They were carried . They went_by coal barge because no carriage driver or conventional boat captain in New Orleans would take them . No landlord would let them stay . &quot; The lepers were made as comfortable as possible , &quot; wrote a reporter who made the all-night trip in greater comfort , aboard the tug Ella Andrews . &quot; Many mattresses were placed on the deck , and pillows and bed_clothing given the patients. &quot; It was Nov . 30 , 1894 . Today , just about every belief held about the disease when the leprosarium at Carville was founded 100 years ago has been proven wrong . There is no question that left untreated , leprosy , or Hansen ' s disease , is terrible . It can destroy sight , collapse the nose , and lead to ulcers , infection and the loss of fingers and toes . But that is only if the disease is untreated . It can be cured in a relatively short time with multi-drug therapy , although people who have lost feeling in their hands or feet must keep alert to avoid infection . And it is far from the rapidly spreading scourge implied by the biblical prescriptions . It is one of the least-contagious diseases known . None of the doctors or employees at the Gillis W . Long Hansen ' s Disease Center in Carville has ever caught_it . None . Ever . In 1894 , the seven patients had been rescued from what was called Dr. Beard ' s pest-house -- a filthy place with cracked walls , no heat , a stinking kitchen , rubbish_heaped around the yard . It was a &quot; house of disease , lost hope and death , &quot; wrote a reporter for the Daily Picayune . Their new refuge was a slave cabin on an abandoned plantation bought under the pretext of starting an ostrich farm . The reporter spent two long paragraphs describing the uninhabitable plantation house , closing with , &quot; The cabins are comfortable and need no other description. &quot; Boards had been bought to repair the cabins , he said , and the committee that had set_up the hospital expected to hire two nurses soon . * Blame the Bible -- rather , its translators -- for stigmatizing victims of leprosy . From Leviticus : &quot; The priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean . . . And the leper in whom the plague is , his clothes shall be rent , and his head bare , and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip , and shall cry , unclean , unclean. &quot; The problem is that the men who translated the Bible into English used &quot; leprosy &quot; to translate &quot; tsara ' ath &quot; -- a word used to describe a multitude of symptoms , none of which are those of Hansen ' s disease . &quot; Tsara ' ath &quot; is used to describe even rot in clothing and buildings . Modern translations use &quot; malignant skin_disease &quot; or &quot; virulent skin disease. &quot; The World_Health_Organization estimates that in 1983 there were 12 million cases of Hansen ' s disease worldwide , with 600 # 000 new cases diagnosed each year . In the last 10 years more_than 4 million have been cured . But only a third of those needing treatment get_it . India , Indonesia and Burma account_for 70 % of all cases . Africa is the second-most affected area . Brazil and Colombia account_for 80 % of all cases in Latin_America . Egypt , Iran , Pakistan , the Sudan , the Philippines , and Vietnam are among other countries where the World_Health_Organization describes leprosy as highly endemic . With $ 420 million , WHO figures that it could reduce the number of cases to 1 per 10 # 000 people worldwide by the year 2000 . That would eliminate it as a threat to public health , the organization said . Not everyone agrees with WHO ' s predictions . &quot; Prophesy is a dangerous game in biology , &quot; Dr. Paul Brand , whose specialty is repairing damage from Hansen ' s disease , said in his keynote_address to the 14th International Leprosy Congress last August in Orlando , Fla . Forty years ago , he noted , the success of sulfone drugs in suppressing symptoms prompted predictions that the disease would be eliminated in a generation . As recently as 1983 , the best-known treatment was a lifelong course of the sulfone called dapsone , introduced in 1941 at Carville . However , doctors learned that Mycobacterium_leprae often become resistant to dapsone if it is used alone . A combination of drugs turned_out to be much more effective . At today ' s Carville , the white , columned manor_house holds administrative offices for the world ' s foremost hospital and research_center for Hansen ' s disease , now the preferred term for leprosy . The center has been part of the Public Health Service since 1921 , and celebrates its centennial this year . The hospital is now largely a nursing_home . As a visitor passes_through , two old_women in wheelchairs are in the lobby . One has sock-like bandages on both hands . The other woman has one bandaged hand . Repeated infections have reduced the fingers on her other hand to stubs . They are among 28 patients in the infirmary . An additional 20 people live_in 10 tidy cottages on this 300-acre estate , shaded by oaks that were old even when the first patients arrived . The rest live_in dormitory apartments . Those , whose feet cannot handle much walking , ride bicycles and adult tricycles through the long corridors between buildings , honking horns or ringing bells at intersections in case one of the blind residents is coming the other way . This is where in 1941 the first effective drug was found , the sulfones , the &quot; Miracle at Carville &quot; celebrated in a book and movie . It ' s where doctors experimented 30 years later with the multi-drug therapy that the World_Health_Organization says could eliminate Hansen ' s disease as a public health threat by the turn_of_the_century . This is where scientists learned that armadillos can carry Mycobacterium lepra , a rod-shaped germ that grows extremely slowly in the body and refuses to grow at all_in test_tubes or petri_dishes . Doctors here worked_out tests to measure how much feeling has been lost in_hands or feet . They molded sandals to protect numb feet from damage , and they found ways to speed the healing of ulcers that develop , techniques also used for diabetic patients with nerve damage . Nerve-testing kits are manufactured and packaged here . The workshop where that is done is down the hall from rooms where residents applique sweat shirts and make beads to string into necklaces and earrings for_sale . The research lab has moved to Baton_Rouge , and nobody knows how long the hospital will remain at Carville . The grounds are really too_large , said Dr. Robert Jacobson , who came_to Carville in 1967 and is now its director . &quot; The patients here have been promised lifetime care , &quot; said Jacobson , 61 . &quot; But whether we ' ll wait until the last patient dies before we move to Baton_Rouge , I don ' t know . It will probably be long after I retire. &quot; A handful of the patients are temporary , in_for surgery or complications from the disease . The rest are permanent residents . The average age is near 70 ; the youngest patient is in his 40s . Jacobson estimates that half of the residents have lived at Carville since their first admission . Some , like Betty and Harry Martin and Jack and Rachael Pendleton , after years of living and working_on the outside , have returned to the hospital where the two couples met and married . Betty Martin was 19 when she arrived here Jan . 15 , 1937 . &quot; You don ' t forget that date , &quot; said Martin , whose fine silver-and-diamond wedding_band now is loose on her delicate finger . She had asked an uncle who was a doctor to look_at some rosy spots on her thigh . An allergy , he said . She wasn ' t satisfied -- &quot; I was very fastidious &quot; -- and went_to another doctor , who referred her to a dermatologist . That doctor asked about her ear . Did_it itch ? Yes , she said , and sometimes she scratched until it bled . The doctor cut_into the ear , and commented on her lack of response . With hindsight , she knows that the bacterial culture only confirmed the diagnosis he made then . The doctor told her uncle , who told her father on Christmas . The doctor was a humane man . He gave the family a choice : &quot; Get her out of New Orleans at once or I ' ll report her to the Board of Health . . . . Get her away before she infects the whole city. &quot; Martin told her story in &quot; Miracle at Carville , &quot; after she and her husband were released , their disease arrested by the sulfone drugs . Sulfones kept the bacteria from spreading , but the bacteria became resistant after a decade or two . Betty Martin told more of their story in &quot; No One Must Ever Know , &quot; after a second stay in Carville . &quot; My longing to know my neighbors is great , but far greater is the fear that devastated our lives and undermined our health , for what would they think_of us if they knew ? What would they do ? &quot; she wrote at the end . &quot; Exposure . . . would probably mean a hasty selling of our home at_a_loss , as such things always work_out that way . We have known so many cases. &quot; Jack Pendleton was 33 when he came_to Carville in 1959 . Rachael Pendleton had been there 10 years -- a sheriff ' s deputy and a public health nurse had brought her and two older patients to the hospital when she was 14 . Pendleton was cured after a year , and they left together . Pendleton returned to work for the railroad . Then he went_to college and became a computer specialist . They returned in 1978 , when Rachael needed more treatment . Pendleton , president of the Patients ' Federation , says that if the hospital must close , patients should get a $ 22 # 000-a-year stipend to help them live_on the outside . It costs about $ 44 # 000 a year to house each patient in the hospital , he said , so it would still save money overall .</TEXT>
