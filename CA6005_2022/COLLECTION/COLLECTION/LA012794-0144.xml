   <HEADLINE> KODAK UNVEILS CHANGES IN BASIC FILM LINE ; PHOTOGRAPHY : GENERICS AND OTHERS HAVE CUT INTO THE COMPANY ' S PROFITS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Eastman Kodak Co . is changing its consumer film product_line , adding a discount brand and changing its Gold and Ektar labels in hopes of fighting competitors who undercut its prices . Kodak said Wednesday that it will reformulate the top-of-the-line Ektar film and rename it Royal Gold . Kodak Gold will also be reformulated and repackaged . The discount film , called Funtime , will be offered during fall and spring , when sales are traditionally slow . Kodak devised the strategy to encourage sometime buyers of its film to become more loyal to the brand . The company ' s profit_margins have been slipping , partly due_to pricing competition from generic brands as well as from Fuji Film , Konica and others . The company announced its plans at a news_conference at which it also introduced 30 new products , including cameras with flash attachments designed to reduce &quot; red eye. &quot; Kodak also demonstrated computer kiosks that allow customers to add graphics and text to photos . They will be deployed to retailers later this year . The company ' s stock closed_up 50 cents at $ 43 on the New York Stock_Exchange . Analysts gave the strategy on film brands mixed reviews . &quot; It ' s a good way to differentiate without antagonizing customers , &quot; said Sharon Dorsey Wagoner , an analyst at Argus Research . &quot; This should be a positive for Kodak , customers and retailers. &quot; &quot; I just don ' t think that ' s going_to help their numbers , &quot; said Alex Henderson , an analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. &quot; The basic problem is their prices are too high and people can come_in underneath them and still make a profit. &quot; Alex Wasilov , Kodak ' s general_manager and vice_president of U.S. marketing for consumer brands , said the strategy fits the way research shows consumers approach film . They ' re willing to pay_for higher-quality film for special events , such_as holidays , weddings and graduations . Rochester , N.Y.-based Kodak will roll_out a new advertising_campaign for the Gold line during the Winter_Olympics , suggesting that people buy_it because they never know when a &quot; Kodak moment &quot; will come_along . Ads for the Royal Gold line will say it is the best choice for special occasions and enlargements . The company will not advertise Funtime , which will be available in just two speeds and sold in early spring and early fall . It will cost about 20 % less than the Gold line , Wasilov said .</TEXT>
