   <HEADLINE> LILLEHAMMER / ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS ; ANALYSIS ; U.S. SKIERS LEFT THEIR CRITICS STUCK IN STARTING_GATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The mistake some critics made in snowplowing the U.S. Alpine skiing program before the Olympics -- more salt for that Norwegian crow ? -- was letting the facts get_in the way of a good_story . They pored over stat sheets and computer rankings and came_to the logical conclusion that U.S. medal chances in Norway were bleak . When Hilary Lindh won the last downhill before the Olympics , at Sierra_Nevada , Spain , it brought_to six the total of World Cup victories by current U.S. skiers . Julie Parisien had half of those , and she was starting the Olympics mired in a slump . AJ Kitt had claimed the only men ' s victory , but he , too , was struggling . And you had to go_back to 1985 for Diann Roffe-Steinrotter ' s last World Cup victory . There had also been upheaval at U.S. ski team headquarters . Dennis Agee resigned as Alpine director last spring because of budget cutbacks . Howard Peterson , U.S. Skiing ' s oft-criticized CEO , was stepping aside to make_way for Mike Jacki . The Alpine development program was in need of an overhaul . It was with this ammunition that Sports Illustrated blasted the Alpine team in its Olympic preview with the word , woeful . Those were the reasons Ski_Racing , the international ski journal , called the team &quot; pathetic &quot; and &quot; an embarrassment. &quot; Overlooked , however , were the big-event history of the United States and some cornball intangibles , such_as Olympic spirit and momentum . After winning four Olympic medals in the first week of Alpine events -- two gold and two silver -- U.S. coaches have reason to gloat . &quot; I think the reality is , we always believed_in ourselves , &quot; said Paul Major , the U.S. Alpine director . &quot; We believed_in the program . The only person you have to answer to is yourself . &quot; I think this on-the-bandwagon , off-the-bandwagon stuff is a pretty sad thing . The really sad thing is that the people who really should know , Sports Illustrated and Ski_Racing , should understand the sport a little better . They showed their true colors , and didn ' t have a clue. &quot; To suggest the United States had no medal chances was certainly off the mark . Although the U.S. team lacked depth , it had half_a_dozen or so skiers within striking distance . True , Tommy Moe had never before won an international race , but he had finished third in two World Cup races this season and ranked in the top 10 in downhill and super-G . True , Picabo Street had never stood atop a World Cup podium , but she had won the combined silver at last year ' s World Championships . True , Roffe-Steinrotter had not won an international race in nine years , yet she was the defending Olympic silver medalist in giant slalom . Ski team critics ignored the team ' s history as one-hit wonders . The Alpine team earned three medals at last year ' s World championships -- two silvers and a bronze , and two silvers at the 1992 Albertville Olympics . Other U.S. success-story theories : HOW DO YOU FACTOR MOMENTUM ? Bill Johnson ' s dramatic downhill victory at the 1984 Sarajevo Games fueled a five-medal fire , the best performance by the United States in Olympic Alpine . Ten years later , Tommy Moe lit an emotional fuse here with his dramatic downhill victory in the first Alpine event . &quot; When Tommy won the gold , I was so fired_up , &quot; Picabo Street said . &quot; I couldn ' t sit still . If he could do_it , I could do it. &quot; Two days later , Roffe-Steinrotter scored her stunning victory in women ' s super-G . The next day , Moe scored again with his super-G silver . Then , last Saturday , the antsy Street struck silver in the women ' s downhill . Europeans watched with envy . Some suspected a conspiracy . At Kvitfjell , site of the speed races , U.S. skiers lodged_in a house near the top of the course . One veteran World Cup observer wondered why U.S. skiers seemed to be making_up time on the stretch of snow in front of their cabin , now called Medal House . This would be known as the second-skier man theory . &quot; Everybody ' s just shaking their heads , &quot; Major said . &quot; They think we ' re on_fire . Once you get that kind of momentum , everyone else is more or less scared of you . But they also know there ' s no miracles , they ' ll figure that out. &quot; AMERICANS HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE This is a popular theory , usually espoused by Europeans , who face so_much scrutiny in their countries , they tend to tense_up , allowing Americans to shine . &quot; They know the others will be under pressure , so this helps them to lift_up their level , &quot; Patrick Lang , longtime World Cup chronicler , said of the U.S. medal rush . Lang suggested that European skiers put so_much emphasis on the World Cup circuit they don ' t enter the Olympics with the same spark . &quot; Most of the Europeans are more conservative , &quot; Lang said . &quot; I would n ' t say boring , but ( skiing ) is more routine . It ' s an everyday job . For America , the Olympics are a big thing . It ' s a mental attitude. &quot; Monique Pelletier , a U.S. slalom specialist , agreed . &quot; The Olympics is the ultimate for Americans , &quot; she said . &quot; As a skier , if I won a World Cup , I ' d be equally happy , but back home , the gold medal goes_a_long_way . that ' s what people notice. &quot; VEN PLAYING FIELD About 75 % of the World Cup tour is raced in Europe . While many Europeans get_to return home each week , Americans spend months at a time overseas , living_out of duffel_bags . Thus , the Americans are much more comfortable in the Olympic village . &quot; We ' re a pretty tough group of people , &quot; said Pelletier , from Hood River , Ore . &quot; We spend weeks on_the_road , traveling . It makes us more adaptable. &quot; Still , the Euros figure to make_up ground in this week ' s slalom events . Although Kyle Rasmussen and Moe finished 2-3 in last week ' s combined downhill , they probably will go the way of Street , who finished second in the women ' s combined downhill , but ended_up 10th overall . A men ' s medal in slalom and giant slalom would take a miracle , but the women ' s gate team appears to have a puncher ' s chance , with Heidi Voelker and Eva Twardokens in GS . Parisien has the talent to score in Sunday ' s slalom , but her emotional_state is fragile . Even if the U.S. does not win another medal , what has already been accomplished will not be diminished . The long-range problems of the U.S. Skiing don ' t disappear because of four medals , yet it was difficult to argue with Moe when he said last week that the U.S. team did not deserved to be ridiculed . The apology was already on the way . A week after SI ' s critique of the ski team , which described Moe as &quot; no soaring success story , &quot; Moe graced the magazine ' s cover and was proclaimed &quot; Golden Boy. &quot; Peterson , who two weeks ago had one foot in the cooker and the other out the door , walks away vindicated . &quot; Maybe I ' ll frame last week ' s ( cover ) and this week ' s together , &quot; Peterson said . &quot; I know who my friends are . The people who were my friends two weeks ago are my friends . I certainly know who my enemies are. &quot;</TEXT>
