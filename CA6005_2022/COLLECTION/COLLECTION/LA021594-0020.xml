   <HEADLINE> IT ' S ANOTHER TRIUMPH FOR THE HOME TEAM ; CROSS-COUNTRY SKIING : ALSGAARD UPSTAGES MORE FAMOUS TEAMMATES WITH VICTORY AS NORWEGIANS FINISH 1-2 IN 30K RACE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Monday was Norge Day at the Birkebeineren ski stadium , just as_many had hoped it would be , in the 30-kilometer men ' s freestyle cross-country ski_race . It also was_well below zero . But the sun was out . So naturally , the place went nuts . Bands played . Flags waved . People cheered . One side of the jammed stadium sang , &quot; Heia , Norge ! Heia , Norge ! Ole ! Ole ! Ole ! &quot; Then the other side sang it . And that was before anyone had started skiing . Then , a_couple_of hours later , when Bjorn Daehlie , one of the stars in the Norwegian constellation , strained across the finish_line , bumping Finland ' s Mika Myllylae out of the lead before collapsing face-first in the snow , the place went nuts again . And when Thomas Alsgaard , another Viking , steamed across moments later , to chants of &quot; Oy ! Oy ! Oy ! &quot; surprisingly knocking Daehlie out of the lead , well , it was Mt . St . Helens East . That gave Norway the gold and the silver -- Myllylae took the bronze -- and the only thing better would have been a sweep . Small matter_to the hardy Norwegians , who weren ' t about to let either a missing bronze medal or a little chill spoil their day . The stand-up stadium was filled with 31 # 000 , and officials estimated that at least that many_more , watching free , lined the course . There were tents and camp stoves out there , indicating that some of them had spent the night , and skier after skier remarked about how the exuberant fans had urged him on . Alsgaard , 22 , a power skier who had never won an international race , made the most of the moment , moving_into the lead after the first seven meters , holding it the rest of the way and finishing in 1 hour 12 minutes 26.4 seconds . He was at_a_loss to explain his victory , though . &quot; I don ' t know , &quot; he said , when asked how he had won . &quot; To be sure , I don ' t know . I never expected it . I had a little hope for maybe a bronze but I never thought_of gold. &quot; He finally realized that he might win , he said , with about seven kilometers left . &quot; The crowd began to sing and I started to think_of the gold medal , &quot; he said . &quot; Then I tried to ski faster. &quot; Asked about beating his more celebrated teammate , Daehlie , winner of three golds and a silver two years ago at Albertville , France , Alsgaard said : &quot; I ' m afraid of what he ' s going_to do to me tonight . Maybe beat me up. &quot; Instead , Daehlie , 26 , paid tribute to his young teammate . &quot; I thought my race was a super race , &quot; he said . &quot; On the uphills , I was skiing as fast as I ' ve ever gone , and he still beat me . &quot; Before the race , I didn ' t think_of Thomas as the favorite . I thought more of ( Vladimir ) Smirnov ( of Kazakhstan , winner of five of six World Cup races this season ) . I know Thomas is quite good , but I was a bit surprised he was so fast in the middle of the race. &quot; Smirnov finished 10th , and Vegard Ulvang , another of the Norwegian stars , skipped this race because he does not ski the skating freestyle technique as well as he does the classical style , where each ski is in a track . Alsgaard said he hadn ' t felt the cold during the race . &quot; But afterward , my chest hurt , &quot; he said . &quot; I don ' t think racing in such cold conditions is good for the body. &quot; In fact , there was talk beforehand of postponing it until a balmier day . By then , though , fans had begun to arrive_at the stadium and the course walkers were already lining the track . Norwegians tend to be somewhat reserved everywhere but at ski_races , and depriving them of this day in the sun might not have been a wise decision . &quot; There is nothing to prepare you for crowds like this , &quot; American skier Carl Swenson said . &quot; I was really tired out there , but they made me feel better . I was psyched by the crowd. &quot; As usual , U.S. skiers did not fare particularly well by international standards . Luke Bodensteiner of West Bend , Wis. , was the first American , finishing 36th in 1:20:13.0. John Aalberg of Salt_Lake_City , a native Norwegian who became an American citizen before the Albertville Games , was 44th . Swenson , of North Conway , N.H. , was 46th , and Marcus Nash of Fryeburg , Me. , was 66th among 72 finishers .</TEXT>
