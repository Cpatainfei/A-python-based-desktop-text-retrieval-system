   <HEADLINE> MOTOR RACING ROUNDUP ; SCHUMACHER STRIPPED OF BELGIAN VICTORY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Michael Schumacher , the apparent runaway winner of the Belgian Grand Prix on Sunday , was disqualified when race stewards found that a speed-limitation device on his car did not meet requirements at Spa-Francorchamps , Belgium . The ruling gave the victory to Britain ' s Damon Hill , reopening the world championship points race only four hours after Schumacher seemed to have locked it up with his eighth victory in 11 races . Race stewards ruled that a mandatory wooden plank under his car , aimed at slowing drivers , did not meet legal measurement requirements . It was too thin , giving him an advantage over his competitors . The stewards ruled_out Benetton Ford ' s claim that it could have been caused by Schumacher ' s accidental spin during the race . &quot; The stewards concluded that not one of the defenses offered is acceptable , &quot; the ruling said . Said international FIA federation spokesman Tom Walkinshaw : &quot; Stewards of the Belgian Grand Prix have decided to inflict a penalty on Benetton Ford and driver Michael Schumacher of exclusion from the event. &quot; The crude wooden board was introduced into the high-technology sport halfway through the season after the deaths of Brazilian Ayrton Senna and Austrian Roland Ratzenberger at the San Marino Grand Prix in May . The incident is the third this year to jeopardize Schumacher ' s dominance , which once seemed vulnerable only to the guardians of Formula One racing . Schumacher , driving under an appeal of a two-race suspension for disregarding a black_flag at the_British Grand Prix , will learn the fate of his appeal on Tuesday in Paris . A loss could cost him the points earned during the appeal , as well as resulting in a lengthened suspension . His Benetton Ford team is under investigation for an alleged infraction in the refueling procedures at the German Grand Prix . Now , instead of leading the world standings by 35 points over Hill , Schumacher has 76 points to Hill ' s 55 , and more sanctions could be coming . If he sits_out the upcoming Italian and Portuguese Grand Prix races and Hill wins both , the margin could be cut_to one point with three races to go . * Pole-sitter Scott Pruett led from start to finish in a Camaro in winning the Road Atlanta Blockbuster Trans-Am at Braselton , Ga. , by six-tenths of a second over Dorsey Schroeder . Tom Kendall of Manhattan Beach finished third . * American Scott Russell , riding a 750cc Kawasaki , won two races in the Superbike World Championship at Muratamachi , Japan .</TEXT>
