   <HEADLINE> SCHUMANN ' S 2ND SYMPHONY SCORE SELLS FOR $ 2.3 MILLION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The manuscript of a Schumann symphony , lost for more_than 50 years , was sold at auction for a record $ 2.3 million in London on Thursday . It was a record not just for a manuscript by Robert Schumann but for any 19th-Century score , Sotheby ' s auction_house said . It said the manuscript of the German Romantic composer ' s second symphony , written in 1846-47 , was bought by Robin Lehman and his wife in New York City in a telephone bid through a dealer . &quot; They ' re well known as private collectors and a large part of their collection is_on loan to the Pierpont Morgan library in New York , &quot; said James Kirkman , who took_part in the bidding on their behalf . The emergence of the manuscript from an anonymous private collection ranked among the most momentous sale events in music for 50 years , Sotheby ' s said . &quot; In many places Schumann marked the score so heavily with revisions , deletions , erasures and scratchings-out in pencil , ink and brown crayon that new passages had to be pasted in on top , &quot; Stephen Roe , head of Sotheby ' s Books and Manuscripts department , said . &quot; Lifting these back one can see layer upon layer of working and reworking -- earlier versions that have been hitherto unknown to scholars , &quot; he said . The manuscript had been expected to sell for around $ 1.25 million . Some scholars believed the manuscript had been lost when an Allied bombing raid on Leipzig during World_War_II destroyed the premises of the music publishers who then owned it .</TEXT>
