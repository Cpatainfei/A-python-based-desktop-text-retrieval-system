   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : TO PROS , THE STOCK SELLOFF QUESTION IS WHEN , NOT IF</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For a logic-defying levitation act , don ' t pay to see David Copperfield . Just take_a_look at the U.S. stock_market . Despite bond yields at their highest levels in more_than three years , most major stock indexes are hovering near their 1993 closes -- which means they ' ve given_up almost no ground in the midst of the worst bear_market for bonds since the 1920s . Even on Friday , when a strong October employment report sent the yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury_bond surging to a 39-month high of 8.15 % , the stock_market held_up remarkably well until hit by some computerized &quot; program &quot; trading late in the day . The Dow Jones industrial average lost 38.36 points to 3 # 807.52 on Friday , but it remains 1.4 % above its year-end ' 93 close of 3 # 754.09. And contrary to a popular Wall_Street view , the blue-chip Dow isn ' t propping_up the market by itself . The broad Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500-stock index , at 462.28 now , is a mere 0.9 % below its year-end close and just 4 % below its peak set_in February . More significant to individual investors , the average U.S. stock mutual_fund is down less than 1 % in value this year , according to fund-tracker Lipper Analytical . Most Wall_Street veterans , if told 10 months ago where short- and long-term interest_rates would be today , would almost certainly have figured that stocks would be in a deep slump . So why has the bear been kept at_bay ? Analysts point to an extraordinarily fortunate confluence of events this year : Corporate earnings growth has vastly exceeded expectations , individuals have continued to pump cash into stock mutual_funds , and institutional investors have shown a surprising unwillingness to walk away from their favorite stocks . Yet as 1995 looms , many investment pros believe the market ' s luck has nearly run_out . The increasingly prevalent view is that stocks are at risk of a significant selloff soon whether interest_rates rise further or fall . William Dodge , market_strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York , sees the key problem now as one of basic valuation -- weighing stocks ' appeal versus that of bonds and bank CDs . As bond yields rise , investors naturally pay lower prices for stocks relative to earnings per share . That has in fact happened this year . At the start of the year , the S &amp; P 500 index was priced at 16.4 times the S &amp; P companies ' 1993 operating earnings . Today , the index is priced at 14.4 times estimated 1994 operating earnings , according to brokerage Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. ' s estimates . Stocks ' earnings &quot; multiple &quot; is a product of simple division , so it can drop_in one of two ways : Either stock prices decline , or earnings rise . This year , earnings have risen so powerfully -- thanks to the healthy economy -- that the S &amp; P multiple has fallen even as stock prices have stayed virtually level . In effect , investors have been able to convince themselves that they ' re actually paying &quot; less &quot; for stocks by paying the same price , because earnings have grown . But with 30-year T-bond yields at 8.15 % and three-month T-bills yielding 5.3 % , Dodge sees more investors questioning whether the average stock is worth 14 times earnings . Even allowing_for further corporate profit growth in 1995 , he says , &quot; the bottom_line on the valuation backdrop today is that we are at the same levels relative to interest_rates . . . that preceded the 1990 , 1987 , 1983-84 , 1980-82 and early-70s market declines. &quot; While other Wall Streeters will debate whether 14 times earnings is expensive or fair , Dodge ' s point is that there is very little wiggle room left . &quot; Can ( stocks ) move higher in the current environment ? Sure , but not without getting more and more overvalued and presenting more and more risk , &quot; he says . Geraldine Weiss , editor of Investment Quality Trends newsletter in La Jolla and a bear , believes that interest_rates have hit levels that will induce a major change in investor psychology . Most investors know , Weiss says , that the market ' s &quot; internals &quot; have been deteriorating this year . Though key stock indexes have held_up , the ratio of declining stocks to advancing stocks in the broad market has ballooned . Yet the relative health of the 30 stocks in the Dow industrial index has given investors something hopeful to cling_to , Weiss says . But with short-term interest_rates double where they were a year ago , Weiss expects the still-strong flow of small investors ' dollars into stock funds to ebb soon . That would take a crucial element of support away from the market . If you can earn 6 % on a one-year bank CD , Weiss says , &quot; why on Earth take_a_chance in a risky and overvalued stock_market ? &quot; The bulls might answer her with this : Interest_rates are peaking . Their next major move is down . But if that ' s the case , some investment pros say , the stock_market is still a loser ' s game now . Why ? Because if interest_rates begin to drop , Wall_Street ' s automatic assumption will be that the economy is finally slowing . And if business slows , so will corporate earnings growth . Analysts already are estimating that S &amp; P 500 earnings growth will decline in 1995 to 13.7 % from this year ' s expected 17 % rise , according to earnings-tracker Zacks Investment Research in Chicago . If in the wake of recent strong economic reports the Federal_Reserve_Board raises rates dramatically at its Nov . 15 meeting -- say , by a full percentage_point instead of the usual half-point -- it ' s conceivable that investors could view that increase as the last one . But then , expectations for a meaningful economic slowdown in ' 95 could escalate . And the optimistic outlook for corporate earnings would begin to evaporate , casting a chill over stocks . Jeffrey Applegate , investment strategist at CS First Boston in New York , thinks the stock_market is set_up to have its earnings-driven bullishness &quot; dashed over the next few months &quot; as investors focus_on high real interest_rates and slowing earnings growth . In the process , he said , he believes the Dow could slide as much as 400 points , or 10.5 % , to about 3 # 400 . That would n ' t be the end of the world , Applegate notes . Assuming the economy slows in 1995 but avoids recession , stocks ' bull_market could easily resume from lower levels -- just as stocks recovered after the Dow ' s 10 % drop_in spring . The big question is whether a Dow decline of several hundred points would set_off a dangerous chain_reaction at this point in the market cycle , with interest_rates offering steep competition for stocks and the best news in corporate earnings growth almost certainly behind us . Weiss notes that the Dow , as the most-watched index , can cut both ways : It can give investors a false sense of security if it stays_up while other indexes decline . And it can deepen any turn_to bearishness if it plunges , even if the rest of the market initially holds_up . &quot; Once the Dow capitulates and it becomes widely recognized that we ' re in a bear_market , an element of panic can set_in , &quot; Weiss warns . One ominous sign for the market is that investor psychology , although still positive toward stocks , has become a game of reaching for reasons to stay bullish , argues Richard McCabe , market_analyst at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co . &quot; You hear money managers say now , ' It ' s not worthwhile getting_out and then trying to get_back in , ' &quot; he says . Others will insist that &quot; the market is bad , but the outlook for my stocks is good. &quot; More worrisome , McCabe says , is that many money managers tell him that they are inclined to sell but that their clients won ' t go_along with that decision . &quot; They say that their clients are telling them that this is still a great long-term bull_market and that they want to stay invested in it. &quot; Before the market can turn , &quot; investor psychology has to finally change , &quot; McCabe says . &quot; People have to begin to feel that the greater risk is losing money , not missing the potential upside. &quot; Of course , the bulls may have it right after all . If the Fed engineers a &quot; soft landing &quot; for the economy , if inflation stays low , if bond yields drop , if the corporate profits trend remains up and if there are no global political shocks , the end of this bull_market may_not yet be_on the horizon . The market ' s doubters say the problem is that there are just too many &quot; ifs &quot; in that equation to give them any real comfort with stocks when a bank now will offer them 6 % risk-free .</TEXT>
