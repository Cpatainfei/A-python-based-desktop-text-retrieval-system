   <HEADLINE> BIG WHEEL ; ' 84 GOLD MEDALIST CARPENTER-PHINNEY RIDES ON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Connie Carpenter-Phinney was pedaling on the parkways of Mission Viejo with the lead pack , jockeying for position with five others and dealing with the false breaks that are the obligatory mind games of world-class road races . Davis Phinney sat in a courtesy van with rest of the U.S. men ' s cycling team , trying to decipher the flickering figure of his wife on a four-inch , black-and-white portable television . &quot; When the van got_to the course , we suddenly realized what an unbelievable spectacle this was going_to be , &quot; Phinney said . &quot; We looked_up the road and it was just packed with people as far as you could see . And when they saw the U.S.A. van , they just went berserk. &quot; An estimated 200 # 000 people were lining the 9.85-mile course that bright , hot morning in July , 1984 , to watch the historic first Olympic road race for women . And the roar at the intersection of what is now Olympiad and Marguerite Parkway was deafening as the leaders came_into view . Carpenter-Phinney was trying to locate France ' s Jeannie Longo when the sprint began about 1 # 000 meters from the finish . Longo , who had finished second to Carpenter-Phinney in two recent races , had fallen_back because of an equipment problem and Carpenter-Phinney was caught looking over her shoulder when the others began their final surge . Back in the competitor ' s area , most of the men ' s team was preparing to race . But Phinney was still in the van , screaming at his little television . Senses heightened , it seemed to be happening in slow_motion for Carpenter-Phinney as she surged through the group . As she hurtled toward the finish alongside fellow American Rebecca Twigg , she concentrated_on everything Phinney had taught her about &quot; throwing &quot; the bike at the finish_line . She straightened her arms and thrust the cycle ahead at the precise freeze-frame moment in time . &quot; They didn ' t call it right away and you sure couldn ' t tell who won by the grainy little TV I was looking_at , &quot; Phinney said , &quot; so I ran_out there and everyone was mobbing Connie and Rebecca . I caught Connie ' s eye and she mouthed , ' I think I won. ' &quot; After 49.9 miles of racing , Carpenter-Phinney had become the first women to win a gold medal in Olympic cycling . . . by six inches . &quot; I gave her a kiss and then tried to get totally focused_on my event , &quot; Phinney said . CHAMPAGNE OR BEER ( TO CRY IN ) ? Many were predicting that July 29 would forever be a golden anniversary for these newlyweds of 10 months . But a gilded morning would soon be tarnished by Phinney ' s disappointing finish in the men ' s 118.2-mile event that afternoon . The midday heat was oppressive and Phinney wasn ' t hungry early in the race . And by the time he realized his energy was waning on the last few laps , his team crew was only handing_out fluids . &quot; I ' d go_by and scream , ' I need food ! ' but they couldn ' t hear me because of the crowd , &quot; Phinney said . &quot; At one point , I asked ( teammate ) Alexi ( Grewal ) if he had anything to eat because I could see the lumps in his jersey . He said , ' No , ' but that ' s OK. &quot; Grewal won the gold . Phinney finished fifth . &quot; It was a very bittersweet day , &quot; Carpenter-Phinney says . The couple returned to the home of a San Juan Capistrano family they had been staying with during the Games . A celebration already was under way , but Phinney wasn ' t up_to partying . &quot; Both our families were there and everybody was so happy for Connie , &quot; he said . &quot; But I was so tired , so crushed , so mentally devastated . You put it in the perspective that your whole career , that everything you have done , is for this day . &quot; I had been absolutely obsessed with winning that race for two years and so for me , not winning was complete failure. &quot; Carpenter-Phinney , who credits her husband with inspiring in her the drive and concentration of effort needed to win the Olympic gold medal , says she was &quot; only disappointed for him , never disappointed in him. &quot; &quot; He was happy for me , &quot; she said . &quot; I never doubted that. &quot; Six days later , Phinney won a bronze medal in the 100-kilometer time-trial team event , an accomplishment he still refers to as &quot; insignificant. &quot; &quot; You know , &quot; Carpenter-Phinney said , &quot; it ' s taken him 10 years to get_to this point where he can talk_about it. &quot; Phinney eventually was able to mold the pain of 1984 into a driving force to keep his cycle career churning . He became a two-time stage winner in the Tour de France , the U.S. professional champion in 1991 and when he retired last year , he had won 300 races , including four national championships . &quot; It fueled my desire to press_on and put that day behind me , &quot; he said , &quot; but Connie had followed_through on her destiny . She had come_back to cycling for that race and after she won , she got_off the bike and didn ' t ride again for a year. &quot; BACK IN THE SADDLE Saturday , Carpenter-Phinney will make her first visit to the site of her Olympic conquest since the day she won the gold . The path of the Orange County Multiple_Sclerosis 150 Bike Tour , two-day event that begins at 8 a.m. Saturday at Anaheim Stadium and has an overnight stop in San Clemente ' s San Mateo Campground , passes_through Mission Viejo en route to Del Mar . &quot; I ' ve got_to go_back to that start-finish area and kiss the pavement , &quot; she says , beaming . Now , she rides for fun -- and charity -- putting_in an hour or two three times a week and setting fitness goals for herself before the couple ' s annual summer cycling camps near Vail , Colo . Still , she ' s never far away from cycles or cycling . &quot; If you had asked me 10 years ago if I ' d still be involved in this business , I ' m sure I would have said no , &quot; she said . &quot; But we ' ve been very lucky . The industry has been really good to us . Davis is part owner of a bike shop ; he has been doing some television commentary and lots of speaking engagements . &quot; And I stay busy with the kids and the camps . The people involved in the sport are great , it ' s a great way to make a living and we ' re pretty much into fitness as a lifestyle. &quot; Obviously . At 37 , after two children , she still looks as if she could strap on her helmet and pedal with the best of them . And maybe she could . Whoever said , &quot; it don ' t come easy , &quot; don ' t know Connie Carpenter-Phinney : -- At 14 , with little formal training , she made the 1972 Olympic speed-skating team and competed in Sapporo , Japan . -- After an ankle injury ended her skating career , she started cycling , and in the first year of racing won two national titles . -- While attending Cal to get her bachelor_of_science degree in Physical_Education , she joined the women ' s crew and her fours boat won the 1980 national collegiate rowing championship . By the time she was pulling on oars , however , she had just about retired from competitive cycling . She had won a silver medal in the 1979 World Championships , but was receiving criticism in the cycling press . &quot; They were already hinting that I had reached my peak and was over the_hill , &quot; she said . &quot; And I started thinking that it just wasn ' t worth it. &quot; But then she started dating Phinney , who wasn ' t the best cyclist around but probably the most obsessed , and then came the announcement that women ' s cycling would be included in the Olympics . &quot; Connie clearly hadn ' t reached her potential , &quot; Phinney said , &quot; because she didn ' t have the kind of singular focus , or direction , or advice , or just someone to help her build confidence . &quot; So we made a decision and set_off on this course. &quot; It was a trail that led to the 1984 Olympics and a morning of glory in the Mission Viejo sun .</TEXT>
