   <HEADLINE> TV REVIEW ; MTV ' S ' YEAR ' LOOKS_AT COBAIN , WOODSTOCK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This year in rock , by most media accounts , pretty much consisted_of Kurt Cobain going_to his grave , Elvis Presley rolling_over in his grave , Trent Reznor wishing he were dead and the kicking of a dead horse at Woodstock II . MTV focuses_on Cobain , Reznor and Woodstock ( stock having been the operative word there ) in the 1994 edition of &quot; The Year in Rock , &quot; eulogizing the late Nirvana leader at greatest length but stopping just short of wistfully proclaiming the day the music died . Unlike past years , the wrap-up gives only a brief nod to the woolly world of gangstas in_trouble , quickly summarizing Tupac Shakur ' s legal run-ins , for example , with a map outlining his four-city &quot; national courtroom tour. &quot; Congressional hearings instigated by a black_women ' s caucus on the ill effects of violent rap are represented mainly by Dr. Dre ' s defense , as he tests the waters , perhaps , for a political career of_his_own : &quot; The only thing they ' re trying to do is take_away jobs . This is our job. &quot; Non-music news that overlaps on MTV ' s demographics is given a breezy once-over , from A.C. Cowlings boogying with porn stars to school prayer issues to the Bobbitts to co-host Tabitha Soren ' s incongruous but tenable apologia for the Clinton_Administration . Soren takes the position that a hostile media have brushed over Clinton ' s pushing_through more substantial legislation than several preceding Presidents combined and she believes_in this so_much that she respectfully waits till the end credits to reprise her part in the &quot; boxers-or-briefs &quot; scandal . The hour passes so quickly that individual artists rarely get much due , though the vigilant MTV editors work in at least subliminal glimpses of most of the relevant newcomers . Non-Woodstockians may feel that a bit too_much time is devoted to justifying how the network bought rights to Woodstock coverage , though the Kurt ' n ' Trent segs are duly illuminating . Interestingly , Soren and Kurt Loder seem to be trying to compensate for any perceived lack of chemistry with a markedly Howard Hawksian kind of rapid-fire banter . You watching , Dan and Connie ? * &quot; The Year in Rock &quot; airs at 7 tonight on MTV , with repeat showings Saturday at 9:30 a.m. and 7:30 p.m .</TEXT>
