   <TEXT> His troops under_attack by guerrillas and his decision to deploy them under_fire back home , Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin paused Thursday at the brink of a full-scale war with the breakaway Muslim republic of Chechnya and gave the rebels 48 more hours to disarm . In an appeal_to the Chechen people read on Russian television four hours before his previous ultimatum was set to expire , Yeltsin called_for a cease-fire , negotiations and setting a date for new elections in Chechnya . &quot; If ( President ) Dzhokar Dudayev personally agrees to lead the Chechen delegation to the negotiations , I will send a plenipotentiary high-level delegation from Russia , &quot; Yeltsin ' s statement said . Yeltsin said he will extend the deadline of his ultimatum until midnight Saturday to try to &quot; minimize the use of force , which could , regrettably , bring civilian casualties. &quot; &quot; I will consider a cease-fire on the part of the unlawful armed militias to be a show of goodwill and a first_step toward the restoration of peace and legality in the Chechen Republic , &quot; the statement said . Dudayev has previously demanded face-to-face negotiations with Yeltsin . There was no immediate word on whether he would accept Yeltsin ' s offer while Russian tanks are camped six miles outside the capital of Grozny . Russian forces have been shelling the outskirts of the garbage-strewn , decaying Soviet-style concrete-block city of 400 # 000 . Three people were reportedly killed Thursday when a Russian helicopter gunship fired on a farm near the settlement of Dolinsk , Reuters news service said , and Russians boosted their official death toll to 15 , with 11 soldiers captured . Other reports put the death toll as high as 70 on both sides in the five days of fighting . Earlier Thursday , Dudayev had told reporters he was prepared to negotiate with Moscow . He called_for a halt to Russian military activity , withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya and urgent high-level talks &quot; with no preconditions. &quot; The last round of peace talks in Vladikavkaz collapsed Wednesday after Russian negotiators demanded that Chechnya drop its 3-year-old declaration_of_independence and disarm before Moscow would withdraw its troops . Chechen negotiators demanded that the troops withdraw as a condition for disarmament . Russian television greeted Yeltsin ' s move with relief . &quot; Today at the last moment the hope of peace in Chechnya was preserved , &quot; correspondent Dmitri Motrich announced . On the fifth day of Russian military intervention in the fiercely independent Chechnya , the Russian press with rare unity begged Yeltsin not to launch a tank offensive against Grozny . &quot; We are_on the brink of a precipice . Stop ! &quot; advised the rural daily Selskaya Zhizn . &quot; Tomorrow the war will enter every home_in Russia , &quot; declared the Moscow newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda . A survey by the Mnenie polling organization released Thursday found 70 % of those polled opposed armed intervention in Chechnya , up from 58 % six days earlier . The Estonian capital of Tallinn offered Dudayev asylum Thursday . Dudayev , a former Soviet air_force general , was once stationed in Estonia , and sided with the independence movement there . However , even if Dudayev were to agree to leave Chechnya to help make_peace with Moscow , as the anti-Dudayev opposition has demanded , it is not clear that all_the rival factions would stop fighting . Dudayev ' s supporters say Chechen separatists have already set_up combat posts in the mountains and plan to torment the Russian occupiers with sniper fire , terrorist attacks , rockets and missiles . Unconfirmed reports said that a Russian helicopter downed by Chechen fighters Wednesday had been hit with a Stinger missile , presumably supplied by the United States to Afghan rebels in the 1980s and then smuggled into Chechnya by Islamic sympathizers . Chechnya , a mountainous republic of 1.2 million , remains a poor outpost of the old Soviet empire despite its rich oil reserves . What its leader wants most is to be treated as an equal with Russia under international_law , Chechnya ' s deputy foreign_minister said .</TEXT>
