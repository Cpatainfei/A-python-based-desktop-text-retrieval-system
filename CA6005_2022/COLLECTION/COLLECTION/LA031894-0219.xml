   <HEADLINE> INCONSISTENCY IN MINORITY HIRING CITED ; JOBS : STATE REPORT SAYS HIGH_SCHOOL DISTRICT RATE IS 31.5 % BELOW THE AVAILABLE LABOR_FORCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Minority employees in the Antelope Valley Union High_School District are few and far between , according to an analysis by the state_Department of Fair Employment and Housing . The state agency sent a letter earlier this month to the district saying that blacks , Hispanics and Asian / Pacific Islanders are not employed at a rate consistent with the available labor_force in Los Angeles County . Just 14.9 % of the high_school district ' s 798 employees were minorities as of Dec . 6 , according to the analysis . Minority representation is 31.5 % below the available labor_force . District officials , not disputing the numbers , said the situation is the result of rapid_growth that changed the racial makeup of the region and is compounded by financial troubles that have kept the district from hiring new employees . &quot; Our district has gone_through a tremendous change , &quot; Supt . Robert Girolamo said . &quot; We aggressively need to recruit staff to reflect our ethnic makeup. &quot; The analysis of school district ' s work_force is based on 1990 census data for the county , said Larry Laputz , office of compliance programs manager for the fair employment department . &quot; This report is simply telling them where they did not meet , where they exceeded or where they met labor_force availability , &quot; Laputz said . &quot; It is just a snapshot view of what their work_force looks like. &quot; Any public agency or private company that receives state funds must agree that it will not discriminate , he said . The state does not , however , set hiring quotas . Women were_well represented in the high_school district , according to the analysis . Nearly 60 % of district employees are female , which is 10.1 % above the available labor_force . Hispanics were the most severely underrepresented minority group among the district ' s employees , something local Latino groups noted months ago . A coalition of Latino groups has asked the district to set goals for the recruitment , hiring and retention of Latino staff ; provide recognition to Latino students ; increase diversity awareness within the district and provide a yearly progress_report to the community . District trustees were scheduled Wednesday , the same time they received copies of the state ' s monitoring note , to adopt an affirmative_action report . The item was tabled , however , because of concerns by a majority of board_members about language in the resolution attached_to the plan . Board_member Sue Stokka objected to it because , she said , &quot; affirmative_action leads to quotas. &quot; She objected to the word best in a statement in the affirmative_action plan resolution that said , in part , &quot; cultural diversity . . . can best be taught by the presence of staff in the school setting which reflects mixed races and ethnic_groups . . . . &quot; She also was opposed to the resolution ' s conclusion , which said the district reaffirms its support and commitment to the principles of affirmative_action . She asked that the word commitment be removed from the resolution .</TEXT>
