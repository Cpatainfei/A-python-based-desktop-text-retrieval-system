   <HEADLINE> EARTHWATCH : COUPLES WALK AISLE IN STEP WITH ENVIRONMENT ; OUTDOOR ECO-WEDDINGS -- WITH RECYCLED FLOWERS , RENTED CHINA AND ' REGISTERED ' SPORTING GOODS -- ARE BECOMING MORE POPULAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An eco-wedding ? You may_not be able to find it listed in the phone_book under Wedding Services , Environmentally Correct , but according to wedding consultants in the field , it ' s a pretty easy thing to do . And many people are doing_it . What ' s involved ? Professionals all seem to agree that such an event would necessarily involve low-meat or no-meat catering . Wearing recycled clothes -- especially in cases where brides wear their mother ' s wedding_dress -- was mentioned often , as were bridal showers and wedding_gifts of a no-nonsense , down-to-earth sort . Surprisingly , almost everybody envisioned that an environmentally correct wedding banquet table would be set with china and glassware -- which needs to washed , and probably needs to be rented -- rather than throwaway plastic , which is cheap but ends_up in the landfill . Shari Schultz , co-owner of New Directions Event Planning , a Simi Valley firm that provides consultations about weddings , asked rhetorically , &quot; What ' s proper etiquette ? &quot; And then answered it : &quot; It ' s what feels right for you , &quot; she said , and then got_down to specifics . &quot; Not a whole_lot of red meat -- most clients are health-conscious. &quot; Shultz ' s partner , Shelley Smilen , said that almost all their clients have a particular kind of wedding in mind when they walk in the door . &quot; Traditional , &quot; she said . But , according to both Shultz and Smilen , the meaning of that word seems to have changed in the ' 90s . Half the people walking in the door are getting_married for the second or third time . Many are more health-conscious than folks used to be , and are food-conscious in another way -- they often willingly agree to send leftovers to charitable groups like Care &amp; Share . Dolores Woods of The Classic Carrot , a vegetarian-oriented catering service headquartered at the Ventura restaurant of the same name , has the same experience with her clients . &quot; I ' m really for it , &quot; she said , adding that neither she nor her clients want any disposable items -- food or plastic . China , glass and linen rental can be &quot; close &quot; to disposable items in cost , she asserted . The reduce , reuse , recycle ethic is apparently alive and well in the wedding business , though not called such . &quot; We never like to walk away and leave anything that might bring smiles to someone somewhere , &quot; Smilen said , further noting that flowers from such events are often taken_to hospitals and churches . The truly environmentally minded extend this environmental ethic to the_matter of wedding_gifts , according to many wedding consultants locally and nationally . Instead of &quot; registering &quot; with a department_store for china and silver , eco-couples register with a sporting goods or building_supplies_stores , depending_on whether they are into camping or carpentry . This sends a signal that they don ' t want over-packaged , energy wasting , probably breakable little appliances . Some even register with a travel_agency , specifically one that specializes in &quot; green &quot; tourism such_as honeymoon backpacking into the rain_forest . This interest in preserving natural_resources and celebrating nature extends_to the ceremony itself : many want it outdoors . Back yard , beach , riverside and mountaintop weddings have been with us since the ' 60s . The practice is alive and well in Ventura County . &quot; Weddings are our summer crop , &quot; joked Lin Ayres , co-owner of Faulkner Farms , a Santa Paula enterprise that produces Christmas_trees and pumpkins at other times_of_year . Wheeler Hot Springs is another well regarded non-church site to exchange vows . An amenity offered there that I hadn ' t heard about before in outdoor situations is environmentally sensitive citronella candles . No toxic mosquito sprays allowed , according to Larry Kaufer , spokesman for the locale . For the couple wishing to wed yet farther from a traditional shrine , I ' ve been told that certain local vineyards and wineries are available to host nuptials . Maybe the attraction is the availability of hard-to-find organic vintages . There has to be a legitimate environmental angle for such a suggestion , doesn ' t there ?
