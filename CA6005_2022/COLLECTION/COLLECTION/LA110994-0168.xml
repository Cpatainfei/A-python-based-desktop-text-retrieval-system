   <TEXT> Republican Gov . Pete Wilson rolled to a landslide victory over Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown on Tuesday to complete one of the most dramatic comebacks in California political history , one that thrust him firmly into the ranks of possible Republican contenders for the White_House in 1996 . Wilson , 61 , rode to a second four-year term on a tide of voter frustration , coupled with anger over crime and illegal immigration . He was joined in victory by a surprising number of GOP candidates , for as returns came_in , Republicans realized their hopes for their biggest victory since the Ronald Reagan-led housecleaning of 1966 . Republican candidates apparently won at least four state wide offices -- double the number they took_in 1990 -- and were strongly challenging in two others . The party was threatening to take working control of the Assembly for the first time since 1970 . Also sweeping to victory Tuesday was Proposition 187 , the emotion-sparking ballot initiative that cuts_off free social benefits and education to illegal immigrants . Wilson and other Republicans had made Proposition 187 the centerpiece of their campaigns down the final stretch in October . Democrats still had hopes of holding_on to the seat of U.S. Sen . Dianne Feinstein , who was struggling against the national Republican tide and the nearly $ 30 million in personal fortune thrown at her by first-term Republican Rep . Mike Huffington of Santa Barbara . In accepting victory , Wilson said to supporters at the Doubletree Hotel at Los Angeles International Airport : &quot; What you have won today is a victory -- a victory for working Californians , those who work hard , play by the rules , pay their taxes , raise their children to obey the law , and respect themselves and others. &quot; Brown , the 49-year-old incumbent state_treasurer , conceded at 10:12 p.m. , barely two hours after the polls closed . Surrounded by friends , political allies and her family , Brown told a subdued Democratic crowd at the Biltmore Hotel : &quot; Today , the voters of California have determined that Gov . Wilson , not I , should be for the next four years what Adlai Stevenson once called the instrument of their will. &quot; Giving what observers said was one of her best speeches , Brown added : &quot; As the instrument of that will , I hope and pray that having won the battle of tactics , he will now use his victory to help rebuild California. &quot; Brown , who will leave_office the first week in January , pledged to do what she could to help Wilson &quot; chart California through this difficult passage in our history. &quot; Although Wilson did not mention Brown in his public speech , aides said the two chatted on the telephone for five minutes before her concession . Although they had argued bitterly during the campaign , the phone conversation was described as civil . The governor went_on television a_few minutes after Brown finished her speech . Wilson seemed to make a particular effort in his speech to calm tensions spilling_over from the emotional campaign over Proposition 187 . &quot; What people need to understand is that this issue was never about race or racism , &quot; he said . &quot; To the contrary , Californians of every race and color and creed voted not just to send a message , but they voted for fairness and for the rule_of_law . . . . This nation-state is a state of legal immigrants , and proud_of it. &quot; Just one year ago , Wilson labored along as one of the most unpopular governors in modern California history , hobbled by recession and a massive tax increase , and forced to read in the media about his impending political doom . At that time , Brown was a well-financed media darling , heiress of a Brown family dynasty -- her father and brother both had been governor -- and was anointed the Democrats ' most promising future star . She held a commanding 15-point lead over Wilson in the polls a year ago . Wilson , however , reversed the poll standings with an unrelenting campaign -- one of his trademark seamless , mistake-free efforts -- and became the sixth consecutive California governor to seek and win a second term . Wilson has insisted that he is not interested in national office . But Washington Beltway pundits looked_on Wilson ' s political self-resuscitation with awe and said he must be considered a powerful potential contender for the Republican presidential nomination in two years . Wilson ' s career began in the banner GOP year of 1966 when he won a seat in the state Assembly and Reagan defeated Gov . Edmund G . ( Pat ) Brown Sr. ' s bid for a third term . Wilson now has beaten two out of the three Brown politicians . He defeated former Gov . Edmund G . ( Jerry ) Brown Jr. , Kathleen Brown ' s brother , for the U.S. Senate in 1982 . In the end , Kathleen Brown linked her campaign closely to opposition to Proposition 187 in hopes that the controversy over the ballot measure designed to cut_off state-paid aid to illegal immigrants would energize Democratic voters and get them to the polls to vote against 187 and for Brown . She also counted_on help from President Clinton , who addressed major rallies on her behalf in Los Angeles and Oakland the final weekend . A campaign-end fuss over Brown ' s decision to pull scheduled television commercials was typical of almost the entire campaign . As often as not , Brown was the issue when she needed to make Wilson the focus . As the campaign began in 1993 , Brown was a darling of the national media , a star at raising campaign funds and the leader in the opinion polls by as much as 23 % over Wilson . The incumbent ' s job rating had sunk to record lows in the face of the recession and defense cutbacks that devastated the California economy almost from the day he took_office in January , 1991 . After a successful 1993 legislative session , and with signs of the economy flickering back to life , Wilson ' s stock began rising slowly and steadily . At the same time , critics began to question the direction of Brown ' s campaign . It was , they said , long on glitz and talk_about a Brown political dynasty but thin on substance . Even some friends and supporters said Brown had failed to enunciate just why she wanted to be governor , other_than the fact that both her father and her brother had held the office . Brown had not defined herself and articulated a program that would give voters a reason to replace Wilson as governor , as unpopular as he had been , the critics said . Brown launched a series of policy speeches that contained scores of detailed programs , but again failed to give the campaign a central thrust . In the spring of 1994 , Brown suddenly replaced her campaign team with a new one headed by Clint Reilly , a San Francisco consultant who ran Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan ' s successful campaign in 1993 . But Reilly had never won a major statewide contest . The campaign experimented with a variety of themes before settling_on an economic plan to rebuild California that became incorporated into a 62-page booklet Brown called &quot; the plan. &quot; With more_than 1.5 million copies mailed to California voters and handed_out at rallies , the plan finally gave the Brown campaign some focus by early October . But by then , most campaign analysts agreed , it was too late . Wilson ' s campaign was a textbook effort -- a text written by Wilson and his longtime team of political advisers over eight successful general_election campaigns . They selected three major themes and stuck_with them throughout the long election season -- crime , illegal immigration and the economy . More specifically , Wilson rode the &quot; three strikes &quot; prison sentencing issue through the first_half of 1994 and then focused_on his support of Proposition 187 . Brown spent an estimated $ 2 million on television commercials during the summer trying to checkmate Wilson on crime , and in particular the question he constantly raised about how she could enforce California ' s death_penalty law when she was personally opposed to capital_punishment . By November , the opinion polls indicated that a majority of Californians preferred Wilson ' s positions on crime , the economy and immigration -- just as they had all along . While Brown tried to paint him as a failed governor , the polls indicated she had not convinced voters that she was an attractive enough alternative to warrant a change during uncertain times . After months of negotiations , the two candidates finally agreed on one statewide television debate , broadcast from Sacramento in mid-October . Brown did_well , and Wilson was uncharacteristically unsure of himself and repetitive , but experts said Brown did not score the sort of breakthrough she needed to turn the campaign around . Even more important , Wilson made no major mistake , even if he was not at his best . Post-debate analysis and news coverage focused_on Brown ' s surprise disclosure that one of her daughters had been raped and a son had been mugged . Brown made the revelations while arguing that Wilson -- as tough as he sounded on crime issues -- could not have the personal empathy she had with crime victims . The attention focused_on the rape matter overshadowed any other advantage Brown may have had from the debate . * ELECTION STORIES , TABLES : A3 , A20-A23</TEXT>
