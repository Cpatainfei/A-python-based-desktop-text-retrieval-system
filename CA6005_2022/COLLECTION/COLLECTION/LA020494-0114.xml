   <HEADLINE> SIMI VALLEY CRIME_RATE DROPS 10 % IN 1 YEAR ; STATISTICS : CITY REPORTS 83 % JUMP IN GRAFFITI , BUT NOTES THAT INDIVIDUAL INCIDENTS ARE NOW RECORDED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Serious crime fell by more_than 10 % in Simi Valley in 1993 , a decline that city officials hope will reinforce the city ' s image as a safe place to live despite the fatal stabbing of a 14-year-old boy earlier this week . A report released by the Simi Valley Police_Department on Thursday showed that there were no reported homicides in 1993 , down from two in 1992 . The number of robberies and felony assaults also declined , although the number of reported rapes increased from 11 to 18 . The most significant increase came_in graffiti reports , which surged 83.9 % from 2 # 196 in 1992 to 4 # 038 in 1993 . But Police_Chief Lindsey P . Miller said the increase was a direct result of the department ' s decision in mid-1992 to start filing individual crime reports for graffiti incidents . &quot; We ' ve been keeping a much more accurate record of the amount of graffiti since we went_to the new method , &quot; Miller said . &quot; There could have been just as much graffiti before , but we did not track it as closely. &quot; In January , the City_Council toughened its 4-year-old anti-graffiti laws , banning the sale of spray paint , etching tools and wide-tip markers to minors and making parents liable for up_to $ 10 # 000 in damages and fines from their children ' s vandalism . The council is also offering a $ 1 # 000 reward to people who offer information that helps arrest and convict vandals . To further combat graffiti and improve relations between police and residents , the council also agreed to launch a five-officer bike patrol . The program , scheduled to begin later this month , will focus_on residential_areas and shopping_centers , the Arroyo Simi flood_control channel , and on existing bicycle and equestrian paths , targeting tough-to-reach crime areas . The 1993 crime_rate was 30.2 incidents per 1 # 000 residents , down from a rate of 36.9 in 1992 and 36.3 in 1991 . Simi Valley has consistently ranked in annual FBI crime statistics as one of the safest cities in the nation with 100 # 000 or more residents . Mayor Greg Stratton attributed the low crime_rate to an aggressive Police_Department and cooperative citizenry , and stressed that the fatal stabbing Tuesday at Valley View Junior_High_School of ninth-grader Chad Patrick Hubbard was an isolated act . &quot; An incident like this is always unfortunate , &quot; Stratton said . &quot; But you have to look_at the whole system over time , and we are still one of the safest places to live , although unfortunately it doesn ' t mean that there ' s no crime. &quot; Stratton said the drop_in auto theft , from 439 in 1992 to 369 in 1993 , was the result of a concerted effort by the Police_Department to discourage thieves from the San Fernando Valley from heading into Simi Valley . &quot; We ' ve had criminals creeping over the_hill , &quot; Stratton said . &quot; But 1993 shows that our tough stand has managed to convince people that this is not the right place to go foraging for crime. &quot; * Eileen Gordon , founder of Citizens for a Safe and Scenic Simi Valley , said she hoped that the city would focus_on getting knives out of schools . &quot; I feel that overall this is a very safe community , &quot; Gordon said . &quot; We need to work harder to make_sure children do not have weapons at school. &quot; Gordon , who moved from Chatsworth seven years ago , said she feels comfortable walking after dark in her Indian Hills neighborhood . &quot; There ' s a sense of community here , &quot; she said . &quot; that ' s why we ' re such a safe city , because people look_after each other. &quot; Simi Valley Crime Statistics 04 # 12 , 07 # 07 , 07 1991 1992 1993 Homicide 7 2 Rape 13 11 18 Robbery 64 76 54 Assault 155 153 151 Burglary 1 # 371 1 # 242 1 # 084 Theft 337 367 383 Auto Theft 444 439 369 Arson 27 40 23 Totals 2 # 418 2 # 330 2 # 082 Source : Simi Valley Police_Department</TEXT>
