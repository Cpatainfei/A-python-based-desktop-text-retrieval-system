   <HEADLINE> NATO : CAN THIS MARRIAGE BE SAVED ? ; THE U.S. ROLE SEEMS MORE UNCERTAIN AS BOSNIA TOTTERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Why has the apparently imminent collapse of Bosnia-Herzegovina precipitated a crisis in the life of NATO ? NATO was not brought into existence to settle disputes in the Balkans . Poorly as NATO may have functioned in attempting to restore peace there , any question about the continuing utility of the alliance would seem to require a broader frame . Yet local events do sometimes force more-than-local questions . When the Soviet_Union began the Berlin blockade in 1948 , many in the United States did not believe that rescuing a recent enemy ' s ruined capital was in the American interest . But the blockade and the ensuing Berlin Airlift helped force a larger question : NATO was founded in the following year . THE NEW ' BERLIN ' : The Balkans war is the Berlin blockade of the post-Cold War era . It has been clear since the failed Russian coup of 1991 that with the Soviet threat gone , NATO would need a new rationale . But what should it be ? A security insurance_policy ? Russia and Ukraine could conceivably reunite and , if an expansionistic faction came_to power , threaten Western Europe . Were that to happen , American assistance might again be required . A Soviet_Union redux would , however , almost certainly turn its aggressive sights first to its lost empire in Central Asia rather than to Eastern , much less Western , Europe . The likelihood of any sudden march to the Atlantic is so remote that even if NATO were completely dismantled , a semblance of it could be mustered_in time to meet a worst-case return of Stalinism . European security will be threatened in the years ahead far less by neo-Stalinism than by smaller disputes across state borders and among national groups within states . Hungary is angry about the treatment of Hungarians in Romania and Serbia . Slovakia has quarrels with Hungary . Ethnic Germans in Poland are not as submissive as they once were . And the threat of illegal immigration has created new concerns everywhere . How will the Western European leadership respond to this set of threats , and as it responds will it require or wish any American assistance ? If collective_security in Western Europe is defined to the virtual exclusion of Eastern Europe , if only the internal security problems of Western Europe are_on the table , there would seem to be no call whatever for American participation . If , however , Western Europe intends to assume a measure of responsibility for security in Eastern Europe , then a role for the United States is more easily imagined . But what kind of role ? When the question of NATO is posed in this way , the legitimacy of the Balkans war as a forcing of the question is obvious . American isolationists cry that Western Europe can do whatever must be done_in Eastern Europe without American help . American internationalists maintain that , given the burdens that the United States must bear alone in Korea and the Middle_East , Western Europe should at least pay most of the cost of Eastern European security . Most important , perhaps , Americans of every political view have begun to wonder what Western Europe really wants . A SCATTERED EUROPE : France has seemed eager to create a purely European alternative to NATO . Germany lies_low but may believe that it will emerge strongest should NATO be phased_out . Britain , strengthened hitherto by its special relationship with the United States , would seem to have most to lose , but even London has lately seemed irritably ambivalent about the proper role of the United States in Europe . As NATO meets in Brussels this week and as the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe meets in Budapest starting today , these are questions that can no longer be avoided . Whether and how they are addressed may well determine whether the breakup of Bosnia will prove to be the prelude to a larger transatlantic divorce .</TEXT>
