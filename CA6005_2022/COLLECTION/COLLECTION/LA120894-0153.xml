   <TEXT> It ' s a hangover no aspirin will cure . Sometimes , it ' s more of a migraine , a persistent headache that won ' t disappear . At a time when most colleges are plotting the particulars of their 1995 football_season , top-level administrators at Cal State Northridge are deciding whether it ' s worth the effort to field a team at all . This isn ' t the first time Northridge has been here . Twenty-two months ago , football was_on the chopping block as the athletic department wrangled with budget problems . The program survived the sack attack . Yet dwindling enrollment , a sluggish economy and damage from the Northridge earthquake have saddled the department with a projected deficit of $ 700 # 000 for 1995-96 . Department administrators concede that cutting football would be the quickest_fix . Recent losing seasons , off-field embarrassments and student apathy have created an anti-football sentiment on campus . A decision on Northridge football could come as soon as next week , when President Blenda J . Wilson is expected to receive a list of potential budget_cuts . Others have traveled this well-beaten path . Bill Shumard was athletic director at Cal State Fullerton when football was dropped after the 1992 season . Predictably , the campus citizenry was not altogether pleased . &quot; Any time you drop a sport as popular as football there ' s an emotional hangover , &quot; said Shumard , now an assistant athletic director at Long_Beach State . &quot; Even when there ' s not much revenue tied to it , it hurts in the community. &quot; Dropping a major program is typically a complicated , disheartening process that sends tremors beyond the campus proper . Boosters question the school ' s commitment to athletics , coaches and athletes are left adrift , and the business_community clamps a hand on its collective wallet . It ' s a public black_eye -- but it ' s not like there haven ' t been several of those already . To be sure , Northridge wrestled with more_than a_few problems during a 3-7 season , and many had nothing to do with football . A starting lineman was charged with two counts of attempted murder , a crucial athletic fee referendum was narrowly defeated by students , and with two weeks left in the season , 16 players boycotted a practice . In 1993 , players also staged a practice boycott . Normalcy and upheaval are one_and_the_same at Northridge . &quot; Every year there ' s something new , &quot; tight_end Travis Hall said this week . &quot; On top of that , there ' s always the threat of cutting football . It ' s always something. &quot; Public headaches only complicate matters for a program operating_on what is called a &quot; cost-containment &quot; basis . The Northridge football_team has just 17 scholarships and minimal funding , even for the NCAA Division I-AA level . The Matadors finished last for the second consecutive year in the American West Conference , ended the season on a five-game losing_streak and failed to defeat a program above the Division II level . Northridge hasn ' t put_together a winning record since 1990 . Throw it all together and it doesn ' t generate much goodwill among Northridge denizens . If these are the economic winds of change , some want the football_team standing downwind . Ron Kopita , Northridge ' s dean of students , said feedback he has received from the campus community has been running 50-50 on whether to retain football . Kopita last month established a three-member committee of administrators to address athletic funding scenarios for 1995 and beyond . The group is scrutinizing the departmental budget -- which stands at $ 3.6 million for 1994-95 -- and will outline cuts and configurations to be presented to Wilson . If the process sounds somewhat familiar , it should . Two years ago , an independent panel of administrators and analysts formed by Wilson released a study in which it recommended that Northridge retain its I-AA football program . The panel determined that football would cost Northridge $ 189 # 000 for 1993 , in large part because the program generated $ 150 # 000 in guarantees for playing road_games with Northern Arizona and Division I schools San Diego State and Nevada Las Vegas . In an estimate he termed &quot; pessimistic &quot; since revenue hasn ' t been fully calculated , Athletic Director Bob Hiegert said football carried a price_tag of approximately $ 350 # 000 this fall when the school received only $ 55 # 000 in football guarantees . Fund-raising also is down this fall , Hiegert said . Eliminating the program would seemingly pare the athletic department ' s impending $ 700 # 000 deficit in half -- but there ' s a catch . The loss of football , even a shoestring program such_as Northridge ' s , could hamper the department ' s ability to generate funds across the board , officials cautioned . Fund-Raising Could Take_a_Hit Paul Bubb , an assistant athletic director who oversees most of the department ' s fund-raising ventures , said football was the key element in landing a sponsorship from a major beer manufacturer . Corporate sponsorship packages run between $ 14 # 000 and $ 20 # 000 annually and often include radio spots , Bubb said . &quot; Some ( sponsorships ) might be curtailed or cut &quot; if football is eliminated , Bubb said . Bubb started at Northridge five years ago , when the school moved_up from Division II . Uncertainty surrounding athletics is damaging the department ' s credibility in the Division I ranks , not to mention its ability to harvest the corporate and community cash crops , he said . Corporate sponsorship packages and advertising generated $ 95 # 000 for the department in 1993-94 . &quot; We ' re behind where we could be or should be in terms of what we generate , &quot; Bubb said . &quot; The inability to generate or follow_through on a plan_of_action hurts. &quot; With the program ' s future in doubt , the private sector is watching . Gary Gray , president of the Matador Athletic Assn . board of directors , a booster club that helps generate funds for Northridge sports , said finding deep-pocket donors is next to impossible given the department ' s state of flux . &quot; It ' s difficult to get a response from the business_community , &quot; said Gray , an attorney from Encino . &quot; ( Potential donors ) have a difficult time going_to their board of directors and saying , ' Let ' s give to this program , ' when nobody seems sure about the direction of the program. &quot; Losing football won ' t make fund-raising easier . Gray said it is conceivable that club membership could dwindle in light of football ' s popularity , which in turn might affect fund-raising for other Northridge sports . The Athletic Assn . stages a series of golf tournaments and auctions that generate between $ 5 # 000 and $ 22 # 000 per event and whose proceeds are earmarked for several sports , Bubb said . Last year , the association raised $ 170 # 000 for Matador athletics , of which $ 21 # 000 went_to football . The totals include donations and fund-raisers . Both figures were considered uncharacteristically low because quake-related developments hindered fund-raising_efforts , several department officials said . The Domino Effect There ' s a human element , too . Four full-time and four restricted-earnings coaching positions would be eliminated along with the football_team . Coach Bob Burt ' s contract , which runs_through next season , stipulates that he loses his job if the program is canceled . Burt has a nine-year record of 49-46 and is one of two coaches in the program ' s 33-year history with a winning career mark . Burt has begun recruiting players for 1995 . Not an enviable position in light of the program ' s very public state of flux . Burt will stay the course , because the rest is out of his hands . &quot; If they drop the bomb , then we ' ll scatter for cover , &quot; Burt said . &quot; I ' m operating_on the premise that there will be a program . I ' ve got a job to do and I plan to do_it as well as I can. &quot; Nineteen of the 73 players on the 1994 roster will be seniors next fall . If the program is cut , finding a Division I or I-AA school at which to play won ' t be easy , even for the most talented . &quot; It ' s vital to find a team and to practice in spring ball at that school , &quot; said Hall , a junior who finished second in the conference with 47 receptions . &quot; If they wait too long to make a decision , it ' s too late . . . . Don ' t keep us hanging. &quot; Furthermore , the department ' s chances of someday joining a Division I conference with guaranteed postseason berths , such_as the Big Sky , likely will evaporate if football does likewise , athletics administrators said . If Northridge ' s football program joins Long_Beach , Fullerton and UC Santa Barbara on the extinction list , Southern California will be left with four teams above Division III -- UCLA , USC , San Diego State and University of San Diego ( a non-scholarship I-AA program ) . Gray , the booster club president , has a request for Kopita and other senior school administrators : Make a mission statement and stick_with it . He adds an aside : Football is worth keeping . &quot; Does a school opera have to turn a profit to be worthwhile ? &quot; Gray said . &quot; Does a play or a musical event have to make money ( to be staged ) ? &quot; I think to eliminate a major program hurts the totality of the university. &quot; Boon for Other Sports Not everyone may mourn the possible loss of football . Former Fullerton athletic director Shumard said some coaches there claimed that football ' s losing record stigmatized the entire department . In some quarters of the Titan athletic department , no tears were shed when football was flushed . &quot; They called it an albatross , &quot; Shumard said . &quot; They thought it affected everything from recruiting to our overall image. &quot; Football ' s elimination meant more money was spread_over fewer programs , Shumard said , because football ' s allocation wasn ' t redirected into academics . &quot; We were fortunate , &quot; Shumard said . &quot; that ' s a political battle fought on any campus ( in the process of trimming sports programs ) . &quot; So it seems . In fact , Hiegert said , it is an &quot; incorrect assumption &quot; that football ' s termination means more for other Matador programs . &quot; Nobody has said that if we drop football , resources from the students and the state will stay the same , &quot; Hiegert said . Indeed , some of the department ' s funding sources are unpredictable or discretionary . Revenue from certain accounts can fluctuate wildly from year to year . To wit : * Athletics receives $ 4 per student each semester and enrollment this fall fell to 24 # 378 , down 10 % from 1993-94 alone . When the school moved to Division I five years ago , projections pointed toward an enrollment of 40 # 000 by the turn_of_the_century . * In the past three years , money from the state general fund has dropped_by $ 200 # 000 . * Annual funding from the school ' s University Corporation , formerly called the Foundation , has fallen from $ 430 # 000 in 1993-94 to $ 225 # 000 this year . It is unclear to what degree , if any , the Corporation will fund athletics next year , Hiegert said . All of which means Northridge coaches aren ' t cartwheeling down the hallways at the thought of football being axed . &quot; I don ' t think anybody here ( among the coaching staff ) is in favor of canceling football , though we might be if we thought we ' d benefit from it , &quot; said John Price , the men ' s volleyball coach . &quot; I think we ' ll be funded at the same . . . level regardless. &quot; Even with 24 # 000 students , Northridge ranks among the nation ' s 60 largest universities , according to NCAA figures . Shumard believes large colleges can easily maintain a national athletic identity without football . Long_Beach , a Cal State school which dropped football in 1991 , unveiled a new gymnasium Nov . 30 and has designated six sports of paramount importance -- men ' s and women ' s basketball and volleyball , baseball and softball have become departmental focal_points . Shumard said &quot; the company line &quot; is that being nationally competitive in these programs is not only realistic but attainable . Nobody talks much about football anymore . Long_Beach has retooled . &quot; We have to select what we ' re going to be good at and walk our talk in those sports , &quot; Shumard said . &quot; If you make_it work in those sports , maybe you add football again later . Who knows ? &quot;</TEXT>
