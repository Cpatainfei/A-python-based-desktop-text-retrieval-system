   <HEADLINE> GERMAN BANK DEFENDS LOANS TO FUGITIVE IT ACCUSES OF FRAUD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Facing a crisis of confidence , Germany ' s largest bank defended itself Monday against charges that it acted blindly in lending more_than $ 700 million to fugitive real_estate mogul Juergen Schneider . Deutsche Bank chief_executive Hilmar Kopper said his financial_institution was the victim of a &quot; systematically prepared and executed fraud &quot; in which Schneider possibly had help . Kopper conceded that the bank made mistakes that could cost it hundreds of millions of dollars , but he offered assurances that the thousands of Schneider employees and subcontractors will be paid money owed them . &quot; There can be no doubt about the standing of Deutsche Bank or the German banking system as_a_whole . There is no cause whatsoever for a crisis of confidence , &quot; Kopper said at a news_conference in Frankfurt . Schneider was one of the country ' s biggest , flashiest real_estate tycoons , with about 80 fancy projects nationwide . He and his wife , Claudia , vanished earlier this month owing about $ 3 billion to 40 banks and $ 150 million more in unpaid bills . The couple had sole control over their companies ' accounts and apparently took_tens of millions of dollars with them . Media speculation on their whereabouts ranges from Florida to Iran . Deutsche Bank , Schneider ' s biggest creditor , has filed a lawsuit against the Schneiders , accusing them of having secured their loans with false documents . But the media have criticized financial_institutions -- Deutsche Bank , in particular -- for repeatedly making bad loans to big business . In many cases , the banks serve on supervisory boards of businesses to which they lend . In January , 120 banks had to bail_out the Metallgesellschaft metals and engineering group for $ 2 billion after it ran_up a debt of about $ 5.5 billion . Deutsche Bank was also the biggest creditor there and a board_member . In Schneider ' s case , it has been reported that the banks may have relaxed tight lending criteria to allow him to borrow up_to 90 % of a project ' s value . The banks continued lending to him despite his reputation for delinquency with his suppliers . German media have noted repeatedly that Deutsche Bank received a goodby letter from Schneider on April 7 but sat on the news for days without notifying police or taking other action . The weekly newsmagazine Der Spiegel summed_up much of the critical national and international media coverage of the banks with a short_line in its six-page story : &quot; Poor Deutsche Bank. &quot; The magazine quoted the Frankfurt Public Prosecutor ' s office as saying that even after filing suit , the bank withheld relevant files_in the case . But Kopper said that the bank ' s &quot; gravest error was that we let ourselves be duped. &quot; He added that no bank employees will be fired or made scapegoats .</TEXT>
