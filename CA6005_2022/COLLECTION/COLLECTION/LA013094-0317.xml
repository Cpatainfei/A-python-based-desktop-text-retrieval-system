   <HEADLINE> DESTINATION : QUEBEC ; WHERE WINTER WORKS ; WHY GO TO CANADA IN FEBRUARY ? QUEBEC ' S CARNIVAL PROVIDES A HISTORIC VENUE FOR CELEBRATING THE BIG CHILL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Perched on a cliff overlooking the St . Lawrence River , Quebec_City appears from a distance like a vision from a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale . Cloaked in a mantle of snow and trimmed in glistening icicles , rows of steep-roofed , stone row_houses climb along a warren of narrow cobbled streets to a crowning castle that bristles with copper-roofed turrets . Yet when I am within the city ' s embrace , walking those narrow medieval streets , a frosty wind nipping at my ears , the words that come_to_mind are not those of a fairy tale , but of Quebec ' s most famous contemporary poet , Gilles Vigneault , who wrote , &quot; My country is not a country , it is winter . . . &quot; Nothing could be truer of Quebec_City when it is locked_in the jaws of ice and snow . Why , then , would anyone dream of heading north to Canada in February ? For the five years I have lived_in Montreal -- 150 miles southwest of Quebec_City -- I have rarely missed an opportunity to visit the city ' s pre-Lenten carnival celebration , not just for the planned events , but to join the locals and others from around the world in welcoming winter ' s chill full on , during an 11-day frozen Mardi Gras . From Feb . 3 to 13 this year , the Carnaval de Quebec is a full calendar of dog sled races , ice canoeing competitions and -- for those , unlike me , with iron constitutions -- outdoor &quot; snow baths , &quot; which means taking a tumble in frozen powder dressed in only a swimming suit . I do , however , bring my own skates for a modest little whirl_around the outdoor rinks -- some set_up especially for carnival in parks and along the St . Lawrence River . For those with confidence enough , there is organized barrel jumping_on skates . ( I take a pass_on this. ) Even horses don spiked shoes to race on the ice of the frozen Charles_River . So I bundle_up , stomp my feet to the rhythm of a French_Canadian jig being played over loudspeakers and watch in astonishment as the Quebeckers ' famous joie_de_vivre expresses itself in various ways including dancing in the streets , despite temperatures that may hover near 10 degrees . Quebec , as the city is usually known , is home to 500 # 000 people . But within the modern metropolis beats an ancient and still vigorous heart locals_call &quot; Vieux Quebec , &quot; Old Quebec . Through 4 1 / 2 centuries , this exquisite half-square-mile of European ambience , brimming with more_than 3 # 000 historic buildings , has aged like fine French cognac . Cradled by massive granite and sandstone ramparts , it is the only walled city north of Mexico . Modern Quebec grew_up outside these walls and though the historic district fell_into substantial disrepair , it was not razed , as city_centers elsewhere were . Instead , during the 1960s and ' 70s , people began moving_back into the old quarter , restoring whole streets and infusing them once again with life . Finally , in 1985 UNESCO declared Old Quebec a World Heritage Site , the first city in North_America to join the designation that also includes Jerusalem , the Taj Mahal and the Pyramids . Most of the festivities of carnival take_place in and around Old Quebec . Watching the events or prowling the warren of winding streets in the old city , I soon feel the winter chill making its way through my parka and boots -- the perfect excuse to duck into one of the many cafes or pastry shops on the main shopping streets of rue St . Louis and rue St . Jean . In the true French style , most establishments post their menus outside beneath the light of Victorian street_lamps and temptingly display their pastries and cakes in the windows , making them all_the more difficult to resist . Quebec food is a specialty that is hard to find elsewhere . I have a soft_spot for this hearty cuisine that was created with winter in mind : pea_soup rich with smoked ham chunks , maple_sugar sweetened baked beans , tourtiere , a main_course pie made from a selection of game meats , and sinfully decadent maple_syrup pie served warm and topped with whipped cream . Being rather sentimental , I find one of the nicest ways to explore Old Quebec during carnival to be from the comfort of a caleche , wrapped in a cozy fur rug as my driver , his curling mustache sparkling with ice_crystals , directs the horse-drawn carriage past beautiful , Notre-Dame-de-Quebec cathedral , past Quebec Seminary , one of the first universities in North_America , and past the bustling cobblestone pedestrian street rue de Tresor -- a narrow sliver of Paris ' Montmartre , where artists hang their sketches and paintings outdoors for_sale even in the depths of winter . Dry snow scrunches under my feet on the broad wooden boardwalk of Dufferin Terrace that skirts the Chateau Frontenac , one of Canada ' s grand railway hotels built_in 1893 . Although I had to book six months in_advance of my 1993 carnival visit , staying_at the Chateau , with its old_English Tudor interior and spectacular views of the city , was truly romantic . Throughout the crooked maze of streets I have found surprises at almost every turn by asking the question : &quot; What did this used to be ? &quot; Everyone , from waiters to workmen , suddenly becomes an amateur historian , in the city where it seems everything was once something else . One day my lunch is served in La Couchon Dingue , which turns_out to be a former 19th-Century police_station . On another , in the Pape George ( Pope George ) , a cozy wine bar with low-beamed ceilings and three-foot-thick walls , the barman opens a thick portfolio of engravings he plucks from beneath the counter to show me the place as a fur store dating_back to the 1750s . With a furry bearhug I meet Bonhomme , carnival ' s master of ceremonies and mascot -- a jolly snowman wearing a red toque and braided sash of the hearty hommes du nord -- men of the north -- whose intrepid pioneering spirit has been the inspiration for carnival since it began in 1954 . Bonhomme ' s residence is in the 75-foot-high palace made of snow blocks that is carnival ' s centerpiece . And it ' s here , just outside medieval St . Louis Gate , that I grab a toboggan and slide_down the icy incline that takes me in a breathtaking whoosh , from the top of the castle to the ground , perhaps 40 feet below . Bonhomme ' s smiling countenance also appears on the tops of hollow carnival canes that are filled with a traditional brew of red_wine and spirits that make a blend called Caribou . The concoction -- which carries the kick of its namesake -- helped the early explorers stay warm , a role it still performs each year at carnival where it is illegal to drink from a bottle outdoors but acceptable to tip the cane for a sip . Carnival spills outside the old city walls and down nearby Grande Allee , a broad and elegant avenue of Victorian stone row_houses converted to stylish restaurants . It ' s here I head to watch entrants from a dozen countries take_part in the International Snow Sculpture Competition , where they chip and saw away at great blocks of ice from which emerge a fantastic repertoire of serpents , polar_bears , a Statue_of_Liberty , larger than life Eskimos and an entire family on a giant sled . Stomping my feet and slapping my hands together to keep warm , I await the grand finale of the festival , the two-mile-long canoe race across the ice choked St . Lawrence River to Levis on the south bank and back . Ice canoeing is a traditional sport that was once the only means of transport to many islands in the river during winter . As an ice breaker travels_to and fro to keep a pathway open , the starting gun sends the five-man team off , alternately rowing with long oars in open water or running_across the bluish ice slabs with metal crampons on their shoes . A little over 30 minutes later , I am still among thousands of spectators stoically lining the river banks to cheer as the first boat touches the shoreline . In true hommes du nord style the winning team does a victory leap , almost making my own heart stop as they plunge backward into the cold thickening waters . I swear I feel a shiver pass_through the crowd . That evening carnival draws to a close with a spectacular candlelight parade winding through the streets . Sure it ' s cold outside watching the glittering floats pass_by , but there ' s been something in the air these past 11 days : a gaiety and sense of celebration that truly warms the heart .
