   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; MIAMI SUMMIT IS BENCHMARK FOR FREE GLOBAL TRADE ; COMMERCE : THERE IS DOUBT WHETHER UNITED STATES , LATIN_AMERICA HAVE POLITICAL WILLPOWER TO MEET GOAL OF AGREEMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The goal could hardly be grander , more ambitious or more specific : the establishment of a free-trade zone of unprecedented scope , making_it no more taxing , in terms of duties and quotas , to sell an Iowa-built refrigerator in Argentina than it is to sell the same productin Alabama . All goods and services , coming from the factories of the United States ' Rust Belt to the cattle_ranches of the Pampas , could cross international borders throughout the Western_Hemisphere with the same ease that artichokes from Castroville are sold in the markets of Chicago . By committing their economically diverse nations to embark_on such a path by 2005 , the 34 participants in the weekend Summit of the Americas laid_down a benchmark that will become a challenge not just for themselves but , even in the short run , for nations around the world as the global economy grows ever more interdependent . The agreement demonstrates just how far the hemisphere has come since the last such gathering a generation ago , when the gold_braid of generals mingled with the business_suits of civilian leaders and the common demand was for preferential economic treatment . Now the summit is made_up of countries that are , more or less , democracies . The chance to compete on a_level economic playing_field , rather than hiding behind protective_tariffs or demanding favorable quotas , is the goal . And there is skepticism about whether the political willpower in the United States , if not in Latin_America , will be sufficient to meet the goal . But among the most enthusiastic supporters of the expansion of free_trade , there is the strong expectation that the summit will have a direct impact , and it is this impact that most stands_out after the two days of meetings . By setting a specific goal of negotiating a free-trade pact by 2005 , the summit nations may well have set_off a global competition that will force others to send tariffs , quotas and other barriers to global commerce into a free fall -- as much as anything happens in an uncontrolled and hasty manner in the deliberate world of international trade -- while encouraging a flow of investment capital to the Americas . Will the goal be accomplished ? &quot; I really believe that the most meaningful thing coming_out of the summit won ' t be what happens in Miami . It will be what happens after Miami -- to see if we continue our cooperation or if we let it drag , and to see if we start right away , &quot; Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said shortly before the meetings began . There are potential political pitfalls . Many Latin_American nations are lining_up to join the North_American Free_Trade Agreement implemented Jan . 1 by the United States , Mexico and Canada . The three announced Sunday that they will open talks to include Chile . Argentina , Colombia and Costa Rica would like to join quickly , too . It is , in short , a far_cry from just a decade or less ago , when such cooperation with the United States , and the abandonment of towering protective_tariffs intended to keep foreign products from competing with those of local workers , would have prompted a huge political outcry . &quot; If you asked me 10 years ago , I would have said , ' No , this is not possible , ' &quot; said Nora Lustig , a senior fellow studying Latin_American economies at the Brookings Institution in Washington . But in the United States , the North_American accord prompted an angry yearlong political debate . Its expansion could well bring a replay , with labor organizations and environmentalists raising concerns that expansion of free_trade can hamper protection of worker rights and the environment . Susan Kaufman Purcell , vice_president of the Americas Society , who served in the State_Department ' s policy planning staff with responsibility for the Caribbean and Latin_America in the early 1980s , said some U.S. officials , led by President Clinton , see the nation moving aggressively to promote free_trade . But , she said , the political problems facing Clinton can be compounded because others , &quot; with an eye toward 1996 , &quot; are worried that if the Administration does not provide sufficient protection for workers thrown_out of jobs by foreign competition , it could be thrown_out of work itself . Still , the Administration has made free_trade the horse it hopes to ride , with the goal of using it to open markets for U.S. goods and thus keep the economy growing while producing higher-wage jobs . With the agreement to create a Free_Trade Area of the Americas , following the decision made in Indonesia to create such a region among the 18 Pacific Rim nations , including the United States , by 2020 , the Administration hopes it has provided new impetus to efforts to cut tariffs and eliminate other barriers that slow_down global commerce . These decisions , along with the rewriting of the General_Agreement of Tariffs and Trade , which will cut tariffs by an average of 38 % around the world , and the expansion of the North_American pact , &quot; will set the agenda for world trade for years to come_in ways that benefit ordinary American families , that generate more high-wage jobs in this country and more opportunity in the countries for our trading partners , &quot; Clinton said Sunday . It is not a new idea . Some critics see the summit ' s free-trade centerpiece as little more_than an extension of a goal set_in June 27 , 1990 , by then-President George_Bush in his Enterprise for the Americas , in which he called_for a &quot; new economic partnership &quot; with Latin_America to boost trade and investment with a free-trade zone for the hemisphere . &quot; It helped set_off this incredible race toward free_trade and lowering barriers , &quot; Purcell said of the Bush approach . But by setting a specific date by which negotiations to accomplish the free-trade pact would be completed , the weekend summit went one major step beyond that . As a result of the Miami agreement and the Pacific free-trade goal set_in November , a global free-trade agenda has been firmly established , said C . Fred Bergsten , director of the Institute for International Economics , a research organization in Washington . &quot; What we have is a process of competitive liberalization , &quot; Bergsten said . &quot; All this is a dramatic movement toward opening markets and liberalizing the economies . &quot; It ' s a major , major step_forward , &quot; he said , and will likely lead other nations and regional trading blocks to join the race to lower tariffs out of fear that their own trade_barriers would make their products unwelcome around the world . * MAIN STORY , A1 * RELATED STORY , D3</TEXT>
