   <HEADLINE> SPECIAL SCREENINGS : WIDE-RANGING SURVEY OF SPANISH CINEMA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The American Cinematheque ' s &quot; Recent Spanish Cinema &quot; ( Friday through Sunday at the Directors Guild ) reveals the diversity , vitality and daring of Spanish films , most of which unfortunately never make_it to American screens . The Cinematheque ' s selection is venturesome , to say the least , ranging from the supersexy , dark-pitched comedies for which Spain is_best known , to several demanding experimental films , and a well-mounted , straightforward TV adaptation of &quot; Don Quixote. &quot; The series commences Friday at 7 p.m. with Victor Erice ' s formidable 138-minute &quot; Dream of Light , &quot; an exquisite , mysterious study of a painter , Antonio Lopez , and his steadfast attempt to capture the beauty of a quince tree with a geometric precision that causes him even to factor_in the drooping of the fruit as it ripens . No photorealist , Lopez is caught_up in exploring the relationship between art and nature , and Erice , best known for &quot; The Spirit of Beehive &quot; and &quot; The South , &quot; celebrates the creative impulse as a triumph over the inevitability of mortality . It will be followed at 9:30 p.m. with Bigas Luna ' s &quot; Golden Balls , &quot; an outrageous and entertaining send-up of self-deluding machismo starring Javier Bardem , who played the stud in Luna ' s recent &quot; Jamon , Jamon. &quot; Bardem is exceedingly , almost comically handsome and virile , but he ' s also a superb actor capable of commenting on the Latin lover stereotype , who in this instance is a ruthless , struggling builder who equates erecting skyscrapers with his sexual potency . Producer Andres Vicente Gomez will be_on hand for a post-screening discussion . Jose Luis Guerin ' s &quot; Innisfree &quot; ( Saturday at 2:45 p.m. ) returns to the lush Irish countryside where John Ford shot &quot; The Quiet Man &quot; in 1951 , and the making of that classic becomes a point of departure for considering Irish politics , history and folklore . This is an evocative but overly leisurely film with long-held shots of idyllic locales , and it becomes tedious way before it reaches its full 110-minute running_time . The least impressive offering in the series , Francisco Rigueiro ' s &quot; Mother Gilda &quot; ( Saturday at 4:45 p.m. ) ponderously explores the madonna / whore complex , epitomized here by Rita Hayworth in &quot; Gilda , &quot; while skewering the dreary , extravagant decadence of the Franco regime . Such themes have been dealt with before far more effectively , and &quot; Mother Gilda &quot; really belongs on the stage , since its unfolds like a filmed play . Superbly designed and beautifully lit , Manuel Gutierrez Aragon ' s two-part , 310-minute &quot; El Quijote &quot; -- Part I screens Saturday at 7 p.m. -- is a faithful , vigorous adaptation of Cervantes that probably plays better on the small screen for which it was intended but is enlivened by that suave and versatile veteran Fernando Rey , whose glorious portrayal caps a distinguished international career . Aragon will be present for a Q &amp; A ; Part II screens Sunday at 3 p.m. &quot; The Bilingual Lover &quot; ( Saturday at 10 p.m. ) is another but more impressive exploration of obsessive passion from Vicente Aranda , director of &quot; Lovers. &quot; Imanol Arias stars as an impoverished Catalan who marries a rich Barcelona beauty ( Ornella Muti ) but ends_up a street accordionist dressed like the Phantom of the Opera . What happens next attests to Arias ' fine skills as an actor and to Aranda ' s bold imagination . Aranda and producer Andres Vicente Gomez will be present for a discussion following the film . In an instance of saving the best for the last , Imanol Uribe ' s &quot; The Dumbfounded King &quot; ( Sunday at 1 p.m. ) is the lightest , sliest of satires in which a shy 17th-Century 20-year-old king ( Gabino Diego ) -- never named but surely Phillip IV -- loses his virginity with the most celebrated prostitute of the day ( Laura del Sol ) in an assignation arranged by a worldly count . When as a result the young monarch demands to see his beautiful French queen ( Anna Roussel ) naked , scandal erupts , even provoking a hearing of the high tribunal of the Inquisition , where one priest proclaims that if Spain loses its war with Flanders or its fleet to English privateers it would be_on account of the king ' s request . This is a timeless , witty observation suggesting that those most eager to repress sex seem ever to be those most obsessed by it . Information : ( 213 ) 466-FILM .</TEXT>
