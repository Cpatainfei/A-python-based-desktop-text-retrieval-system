   <HEADLINE> RUSSIAN PLAYERS WANT A CUT OF ITS DIAMOND MARKET ; TRADE : THE NATION ' S DEAL TO SELL 95 % OF ITS ROUGH EXPORTS TO GEM GIANT DE BEERS OF SOUTH_AFRICA WILL EXPIRE NEXT YEAR . YAKUTIA REGION IS ONE OF WORLD ' S LARGEST PRODUCERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When the first_team of Soviet geologists found diamonds under the ice in this desolate Siberian outpost , they sent_back to Moscow a coded message : &quot; We have smoked the pipe_of_peace ; the tobacco is good. &quot; That was in 1955 . Two years later , Soviet_Russia started selling its gems to South_Africa ' s diamonds giant De Beers . In the old days , all Russian diamond sales were handled centrally in Moscow . No more . Now , world markets watch as Russia ' s emerging new players fight for a share of diamond spoils , making_it impossible to know who controls the gems in one of world ' s biggest producers . &quot; Everyone wants to sell diamonds , &quot; said Vitaly Basygysov , mayor of Mirny ( translated as Peaceful ) , a poor diamond town six time_zones east of Moscow in semiautonomous Yakutia . &quot; People don ' t like monopolies. &quot; Russia , under a five-year deal expiring in 1995 , sells 95 % of rough gem exports via De Beers ' Central Selling Organization , which controls 80 % of the world market . But Russian diamonds -- polished and industrial -- are leaking to the world outside the De Beers system . &quot; There ' s no real boundary between Russian industrial diamonds and rough gems , &quot; said Nikolai Eudin , director of a diamond sorting plant in Mirny . &quot; It ' s no secret that Indians buy industrial stones and polish them into top-quality diamonds. &quot; An increasing number of cutting plants enjoying the right to attractively priced rough gems are adding_to the leaks . Semion Zelberg , vice_president of Almazy Rossiya-Sakha , Russia ' s diamond mining and marketing conglomerate , sees cut diamond turnover soaring to $ 1 billion annually in the coming years . Yakutia ' s Tuyimaada firm hopes to double the number of its polishing plants to 16 in 1995 and market 200 # 000 carats of cut diamonds to Russia and the world through its foreign partners . &quot; Businessmen from Japan and India come here to buy cut diamonds , &quot; said Deputy Chairman Svetlana Maksimovna . &quot; We have joint_ventures with Israeli and Japanese firms . We are positioning ourselves to supply more to the West. &quot; Such remarks are enough to give diamond traders the shivers . &quot; Market confidence is very important , &quot; said Raymond Clark , head of De Beers Centenary in Moscow . &quot; Russians understand the theory of single-channel marketing , but it doesn ' t always work_out in practice. &quot; De Beers is spending a fortune to plug leaks from Russia . &quot; We ' ve had cracks before , &quot; Clark said . &quot; Somehow we managed to weather the storms . I don ' t see why we can ' t do_it now. &quot; Almost all De Beers ' business partners in Russia agree on the need for a monopoly . But there are just too many of them and each one now wants a bigger cut . Zelberg said : &quot; De Beers sees itself at the same level as countries and not companies . It should deal directly with our company , not government officials in Moscow. &quot; In Yakutia , Foreign Economic Relations Minister Vitaly Artimonov said the republic is not getting enough : &quot; We ' re losing money . This problem is being openly put before De Beers. &quot; Yakutia , a republic the size of India which produces one-fifth of the world ' s diamonds , is the latest potentially market-moving force to emerge on the world diamond market . Russia wants equal terms , higher prices and increases in its current quota , 26 % of De Beers ' world sales . &quot; Russia is not Africa , &quot; said Nurgun Timofeyev , director of the rough diamonds trading arm of Almazy Rossiya-Sakha . &quot; With Russia , you can only cooperate . You cannot dictate your terms. &quot; Disputes are also simmering between Russia and Yakutia . Artimonov said Yakutia wants to keep 40 % of its gems compared to 20 % now . Officials in Moscow laugh_at this , noting Yakutia has no license to trade rough or cut diamonds . &quot; If Yakutia wants to go it alone , it has to quit the Russian Federation first , &quot; said Yuri Kotlyar , deputy chairman of the Precious_Metals Committee in Moscow .</TEXT>
