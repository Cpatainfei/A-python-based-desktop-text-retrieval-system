   <HEADLINE> PERSONAL ACCOUNTS OF WORLD_WAR_II ARE PRESENTED IN EXHIBIT ; REAGAN LIBRARY : THE TOURING DISPLAY OF PHOTOGRAPHS , WEAPONS , ARTIFACTS AND PAPERS OPENS TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A rich , searing new exhibit on World_War_II opens today at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library with the sleepy sounds of a ukulele . Drifting from the burnished walnut grille of an old RCA radio there , this is how a Hawaiian broadcast must have sounded on the night of Dec . 6 , 1941 . Then appear flickering home_movies of the U.S. fleet exploding under Japanese bombs at Pearl_Harbor , and the history of World_War_II unfolds across the gallery in an impressive display of photographs , weapons , artifacts and personal papers . &quot; World_War_II : Personal Accounts , &quot; collected by the Lyndon Johnson Presidential Library from the National Archives and a host of private lenders , is making its last stop on a national tour that closes at the Reagan library near Simi Valley on Feb . 28 . &quot; If you ' ve got no more_than half an hour to see this , I guarantee you ' re going to be engaged on several levels , &quot; said Richard Norton Smith , director of the library . There are models of battle machines , photographs of soldiers and sailors , and equipment used by those whom the war made famous . Spotlights pick_out a battered brass compass used by German Field_Marshal Erwin Rommel . President Franklin D . Roosevelt ' s silver pince-nez . Gen . Dwight D . Eisenhower ' s olive-drab jacket . Eva Braun ' s photo album . War correspondent Ernie Pyle ' s compact Corona typewriter . Famous documents are_on display : the declaration of war against Japan , Adolf Hitler ' s last Will and Political Testament , the actual papers of surrender signed_in 1945 by German and Japanese commanders . Here is the first draft of President Roosevelt ' s speech to Congress . &quot; Yesterday , December 7 , 1941 , a date which will live_in world history . . . &quot; he began , then scratched_out the last two words , penciling in the word infamy . Here are letters from the war ' s greatest commanders . &quot; There was one fine thing done when the tenth panzer attacked us , &quot; Army Gen . George S . Patton wrote to his wife from the North African campaign against Rommel ' s tanks . &quot; One platoon of K Company eighteenth died to a man the last thing they were heard yelling was come_on you hun bastards. &quot; Here are the debris of battle -- a GI ' s shrapnel-torn helmet plucked from the sands at Normandy , and one of the perfectly round , glossy , ocher ceramic jars used as Japanese grenades . And here are physical mementos of conquest -- a Japanese sword surrendered by the POW_camp commandant at the River Kwai , a German Iron Cross medal , the wooden plug that airmen pulled to arm the atomic_bomb over Nagasaki . Throughout the gallery , loudspeakers play the national_anthems of all_the nations embroiled in World_War_II . And lifelike plaster figures of Allied and Axis infantrymen stand frozen in the act of smoking a cigarette , draining a canteen , capturing a prisoner_of_war . Most poignant of all , though , are the visions of war recorded in secret diaries and letters to the home front written by the warriors themselves . &quot; The larger-than-life figure is here , but mostly it ' s the GI ' s war , &quot; Smith said . &quot; Guards using horse whips &amp; clubs especially on Sr . officers , &quot; wrote U.S. Army Col . Albert Svihra , recording the Bataan Death March_on tissue-thin cigarette_paper . &quot; Moved on to Balanga ( 129 ) for night ' s stop . Water allowed at Pilar only . . . Filipino civilians giving_away food regardless of Jap threats . . . . In compound there merciless beatings. &quot; Watching the carrier Lexington destroyed at the Battle_of_Midway , Navy fire controlman Clifford M . Dunn Jr . wrote : &quot; It ' s getting quite dark now and the flames finally reach the planes on her stern that couldn ' t get_off . . . &quot; Ammunition left in the guns along flight_deck explodes and the tracers shoot_up in the sky as if someone was still firing them -- She is now completely covered by flames and her hull is white hot , lighting_up the sky &amp; water for miles around. &quot; Army Lt . Walter F . Commander wrote his wife from the Italian front : &quot; I want to remain changeless for you , Dolly , but I can see the changes in myself even as the days pass . You get something twisted out of your insides by all_of this filth &amp; sewage . . . . Darling , hold me so close tonight . Never before have I had so_much need of you. &quot; And there are letters from Axis soldiers showing they were just as scared and determined as their Allied counterparts . &quot; The Russian had built a little bridge-head . . . . In a great counter-attack we threw him back across the river and took this island where we are lying now , &quot; wrote Kuno Schmitt , an Obergefreiter in the German army , in a letter to his sister from the front . &quot; There was a lot of action in the last few days and all my extra fat is gone , &quot; he wrote . &quot; My beautiful dress_uniform looks more depressing now . One must never lose faith in God even if things look real bad. &quot; And there are hints of the patriotism and the will to live that propelled these men through the most wide-ranging war the world had ever seen . In one display_case lies a red scrap of cloth , all that was left of the U.S. flag that Col . Paul Delmont Bunker lowered and then burned upon the U.S. surrender at Corregidor . Bunker sewed the swatch into his clothing . He later died of beriberi in a Japanese prison , but Cpl . Delbert Ausmus eventually got_to present it to U.S. War_Secretary Robert P . Patterson -- as Bunker had requested . Describing the amphibious landing at Normandy , Army Lt . Col . Alfred F . Birra wrote his wife , Barbara , &quot; Now it ' s our turn . . . The ramp is lowered and the Sgt . and I stepped off into four feet of water . . . &quot; We had about 500 yards of water to cross , we couldn ' t run cause the water was too deep , we couldn ' t crouch , we couldn ' t do anything except just what we did . Wade on into shore. &quot; FYI &quot; World_War_II : Personal Accounts &quot; is_on display from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. seven days a week through Feb . 28 at the Reagan library . Because they are fragile and sensitive to light , the Instruments of Surrender signed_on V-E Day and V-J Day will be_on display only between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. each day . Otherwise , protective lids bearing photographs of those documents are locked_in place over them . Admission is $ 4 for adults , $ 2 for seniors and free for children under age 16 . At the request of former President Reagan , all World_War_II veterans and their immediate families can enter the museum free during December .</TEXT>
