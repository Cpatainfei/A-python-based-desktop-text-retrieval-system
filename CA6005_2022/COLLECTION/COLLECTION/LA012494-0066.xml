   <HEADLINE> PEROT SAYS HIS GROUP WILL INFLUENCE ALL ' 94 FEDERAL RACES ; POLITICS : IN TV INTERVIEW , HE SPELLS_OUT UNITED WE STAND AGENDA . HE ALSO ATTACKS CLINTON HEALTH PLAN , BUT MEMBERS HAVE YET TO CONSIDER IT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ross Perot pledged that his political organization will influence every 1994 House and Senate_race and said President Clinton ' s health_care plan is &quot; an airplane with no wings. &quot; In an interview broadcast Sunday , Perot said the agenda of his United We Stand , America , Inc. organization will be headed by calls_for spending discipline , government reforms , campaign finance overhaul , term limits and a balanced_budget amendment . The group ' s planning meeting isn ' t slated until next month . At first , Perot said it would be up_to leaders of United We Stand state chapters whether to add health_care . But later in the 45-minute C-SPAN interview , he delivered a lengthy criticism of the Clinton plan . Perot also renewed his charge that Clinton had &quot; opened the Treasury &quot; to buy enough votes to pass the North_American Free_Trade Agreement , which Perot vehemently opposed . While Perot ' s standing in national polls fell sharply after NAFTA passed , the 1992 independent presidential candidate said : &quot; As far as grass-roots America is concerned , as far as our membership is concerned , it had no impact. &quot; Perot said United We Stand now has leaders in every congressional_district in the country and that the organization would sponsor issue forums and debates throughout the election year . &quot; Our people will be very active in trying to get voter awareness and involvement in every race in the House of Representatives and every race in the Senate , &quot; Perot said in the interview , conducted in his hometown of Texarkana , Tex . Perot also renewed his 20-year claim that the government deliberately left Americans behind at the end of the Vietnam_War and suggested that he had evidence that some were alive and being used for slave labor . When pressed , he refused to elaborate . &quot; When I say it , they will move them , but we have a pretty good idea where they are , &quot; Perot said . He said &quot; all should be accounted_for &quot; before the United States lifts its trade_embargo against Vietnam . But Perot said there was a growing sentiment to &quot; go_ahead and recognize them and just write these men off. &quot; Perot said his conversations with average Americans during his travels had convinced him that the public is deeply skeptical of the heavy government role in Clinton ' s health_care plan . He said his personal view was that the government should prove itself first by improving veterans hospitals and making needed reforms in Medicare and Medicaid . He said the organizational chart of Clinton ' s health_care bureaucracy &quot; makes the Pentagon look_like a ballet_dancer . That thing is designed to fail. &quot; &quot; We have a system that needs dramatic improvement , &quot; Perot said . &quot; But just turning it over to the federal_government , with its history of mediocrity and failure in managing social programs and its total lack of discipline on spending when it comes_to social programs . . . this is an airplane with no wings. &quot;</TEXT>
