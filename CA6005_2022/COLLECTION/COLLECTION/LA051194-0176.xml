   <HEADLINE> U.S. WILL SEND TROOPS TO HAITI , DIPLOMATS SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States plans to send at least 600 heavily armed and protected troops to purge this nation ' s military , even if a broader , tougher program of international sanctions forces the army regime to give_up power , diplomats and Haitian sources say . The only question is the timing and ultimate size of the force , sources say . &quot; When ( the American troops ) come is under discussion in Washington right now , &quot; a U.S. official said here Tuesday . He said the choices are to send the troops in before or after the local military_leaders leave . The Americans &quot; prefer that they ( the Haitian military_leaders ) leave first , &quot; said one source , &quot; but if they don ' t , the troops will go_in anyway. &quot; Some U.S. planners are arguing that the toughening of sanctions should be given a chance to work , while others are said to believe that the new efforts can ' t work or will take too long . A U.N. Security_Council resolution has given three Haitian military_leaders -- army commander Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , his chief deputy , Gen . Philippe Biambi , and national police commander Lt . Col . Michel-Joseph Francois -- until May 21 to resign and leave the country . If they do not , an international economic embargo will take_effect , banning all trade and commercial dealings with the tiny nation ; the sanctions will exempt food_products , cooking_oil and medical and humanitarian aid . Nations also are asked to freeze the assets of the Haitian military_officers and select civilian allies and to withdraw or reject visas for their international travel . President Clinton has said that if Cedras and the others resist , the United States will consider using military_force . But he has maintained that he has not made a decision and wants to let the sanctions strategy play_out . But U.S. officials in Washington , as well as diplomats and experts here , say the President is only employing semantics in a political ploy to ease U.S. congressional objections to a major American military invasion here . &quot; It is not a question of whether there will be an American military intervention here , &quot; said a diplomat from another country , &quot; but its size and when it gets here . I think by the time it is all done , we will see several thousand U.S. troops here , even if Cedras leaves tomorrow and ( ousted President Jean-Bertrand ) Aristide arrives the day after. &quot; &quot; What Clinton will want to do is say ( his course of action ) is a reconstituted ' Harlan County ' and that it doesn ' t represent any change from what was agreed to at Governors Island , &quot; this diplomat said . &quot; I can tell you this will be a far different situation. &quot; He was referring to an agreement signed last July in New York City that provided_for the return of Aristide and Cedras ' resignation . Among its provisions was a call_for a multinational , U.N. military and police advisory group to train a new police_force , restructure the army and build roads . The day the bulk of that force -- about 270 unarmed U.S. and Canadian troops -- arrived on board the American military cargo_ship the Harlan County , a mob of 100 or so men , organized by the Haitian army , rioted to prevent the vessel ' s docking . When American officials decided not to risk a confrontation and ordered the Harlan County back to the United States , the whole agreement collapsed ; that led the Haitian military to believe the Clinton_Administration was not serious about its effort to restore Aristide , who was ousted by Cedras in September , 1991 . &quot; This time , &quot; said a diplomat , &quot; there will be at least 600 American troops . They will be heavily armed and there will be a large_number of combat troops to protect the advisers and engineers. &quot; Another difference , although one Clinton doesn ' t favor , will be the force ' s composition : Although it will be called a U.N. military advisory group , in reality it will be almost entirely an American operation . The Canadians , who support tougher sanctions but oppose a real military intervention , will provide only about 50 police trainers , officials say , and not troops as before ; the trainers won ' t come here unless Cedras has resigned and left . The French and Venezuelans , who also were involved in the earlier trainer effort , have indicated they will not participate in the military operation . State_Department officials interviewed by telephone in Washington said that they hoped this would change , but that it would not deter the American_plan . &quot; Clinton will argue that he doesn ' t need any further U.N. or even ( U.S. ) congressional approval because he will maintain this is just implementing an earlier agreement , &quot; one official said . &quot; He also will maintain that the troops will only be armed for self-protection and will not constitute either an invasion or an occupation force -- that they are there only to train and build an infrastructure , just as called_for in Governors Island. &quot; A diplomat observed that &quot; the Americans feel the end of June is a deadline , even those who argue that the ( sanctions ) should be given a chance before the military advisers are sent in. &quot; The diplomat argued that if the United States has not ousted the Haitian regime shortly thereafter , it &quot; will be faced with a serious international public relations crisis. &quot; He explained that Clinton &quot; does not want to attend a hemispheric summit in Miami in December with either the military still in power or U.S. troops occupying Haiti. &quot; Other officials added that the Americans &quot; think it will take six months to re-establish Aristide , prepare_for ( parliamentary ) elections in December and at least pretend they have reformed the military and created a new , civilian-run police force. &quot; That means , said one diplomat , that &quot; if the embargo fails , and nearly all_of us think that will be the case , &quot; American troops will be here by July 1 .</TEXT>
