   <HEADLINE> POLICE SWEEP SOUTH_AFRICA IN CRIME FIGHT ; SECURITY : CRITICS SAY NEW GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO STEM RISING VIOLENCE . RAIDS SEEK TO BUILD TRUST IN LAW_ENFORCEMENT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a dramatic attempt to stem a fast-growing wave of crime and violence , armed South_African police and soldiers clamped_down across the country Friday night , searching thousands of homes and vehicles and arresting 1 # 742 people , authorities said Saturday . About 18 # 000 members of the once-infamous security_forces took_part in the overnight police sweep , the first since a democratic government led by Nelson Mandela was elected in April to replace an authoritarian regime that used the same police to brutally enforce racial_segregation under apartheid . Mandela ' s government has been stung by accusations that it has been unable to control violent crime . Last week , the holdover commissioner of the police service , Gen . Johan van der Mervwe , warned in Parliament that the nation could slide into &quot; anarchy &quot; if violent crime isn ' t checked . Mandela ' s minister for safety and security , Sydney Mufamadi , hailed the police crackdown as a success Saturday . &quot; Many_more such actions can be expected in the near future as efforts to combat crime are systematically intensified , &quot; Mufamadi said . During the overnight operation , the police checked more_than 35 # 000 vehicles at 2 # 500 roadblocks , and searched about 3 # 000 homes and shops , officials said . Three dozen people were arrested on murder_charges , while hundreds were picked_up for rape , robbery , drug-related offenses and other charges . Whatever the effect on crime , the crackdown was aimed at bolstering public support for the police and the government . Officials fear that reports of violent crime have undermined their largely unsuccessful efforts so far to attract desperately needed foreign investment . Mandela has pleaded for community cooperation with the police , but the officers ' role remains extremely sensitive here . Working as a paramilitary force , the police used torture and extrajudicial deaths , as well as vicious anti-riot squads and a network of informants , to ruthlessly suppress dissent during the apartheid era . Although official policy is now to protect the public , not oppress it , the police have yet to gain widespread respect or trust in many black communities . For one thing , scattered reports of police abuse , including electroshock torture and corruption , continue to surface and undermine law_enforcement ' s claims of legitimacy . And so far , at least in structure and staff , the 115 # 000-member national police_force remains largely unchanged . Although the majority of constables and patrol officers are black , nearly every ranking officer is white . And although whites form only 15 % of the country ' s population , four of five police_stations remain in white areas . Melanie Lue , coordinator of the Policing Research Project , an independent group , said the police_force must shed its apartheid heritage and segregated structure , as well as change its culture of militarism , to be accepted by the public . &quot; There ' s a lack of understanding of human_rights , &quot; she said . The police ultimately will be combined with 10 separate police agencies that continue to operate in the former black homelands . Officials say they also intend to redeploy existing forces and stress greater community involvement . Although political violence has dropped sharply since the April elections , South_Africa ' s rate of violent crime , especially murder , is considered among the world ' s highest . With 17 # 467 reported killings last year , for example , the per capita murder rate was nearly 10 times that of the United States . The murders include the slayings of at least 165 police so far this year , compared to 270 last year . An officer was shot and killed Friday in his car near a hostel in Johannesburg . In a report issued last week , police said murders have increased by 48 % and armed_robberies by 97 % in the last five years . Since the election , police say they also have seen a sharp growth in illegal immigration , gun smuggling and drug trafficking . Mandela has largely led the clamor for better police protection . Earlier this month , the man who endured 27 years in prison for leading the political struggle against apartheid even called_for building more prisons .</TEXT>
