   <TEXT> This month brings observances of important religious_holidays to the Southland ' s Jewish communities , which will celebrate the festival of Shavout , and Islamic communities , which will mark the holy_day of Eid Al Adha . SHAVUOT Sundown Sunday marks the beginning of Shavuot , the Feast of Weeks , which carries that name because it comes seven weeks after Passover . According to Rabbi Shimon Paskow of Temple Etz Chaim in Thousand Oaks , the holiday was originally an agricultural event , known as the Feast of the First Fruits , and later became known as the time when God gave the Torah , the first five books of the Bible , to the people of Israel at Mt . Sinai . &quot; Hearing the voice of God speak at Mt . Sinai is the great religious experience of the Jewish people -- when they are given the great moral laws , including the Ten Commandments , the legal basis for all society. &quot; To commemorate that event , many traditional Jews will stay_up at synagogues all night Sunday studying the Scriptures . At services , the Ten Commandments will be read , as will the Book of Ruth , which recalls the ancient harvest festival and Ruth ' s adoption of the Jewish faith . It is also customary on Shavuot to refrain_from eating meat and substitute a menu of dairy dishes , such_as cheesecake and blintzes &quot; to respect all life , including animal life , and have a greater appreciation of the earth ' s produce , &quot; Paskow said . Most U.S. synagogues hold confirmation services during Shavuot to reaffirm the loyalty of teen-agers to religious teachings . Orthodox and Conservative synagogues will hold services Sunday evening , Monday and Tuesday . Tuesday ' s services will include memorial prayers for the dead . Reform and Reconstructionist Jews observe the holiday Sunday and Monday , incorporating memorial prayers on those days . For information about traditional and creative Shavuot services and activities , phone the Board of Rabbis of Southern California at ( 213 ) 852-1234 or one of the synagogues below : * Temple Beth Am , Conservative ( 310 ) 652-7353 * Sha ' arei Am : Santa Monica Synagogue , Reform ( 310 ) 453-4276 * Temple Beth Hillel , Reform ( 818 ) 763-9148 * Chabad of Hancock Park , Orthodox ( 213 ) 954-8381 * University Synagogue , Reconstructionist ( 714 ) 553-3535 Temple Israel , Reform ( 213 ) 876-8330 EID AL-ADHA Eid Al-Adha will be observed Saturday with chanting , prayers and festivities . About 15 # 000 people will pray at the Los Angeles Convention Center , said Ahmed El-Gabalawy , chairman of the religious and social committee of the Islamic Center of Southern California . The doors will open at 5:30 a.m. for the 6 a.m. service of takbeer ( chanting ) and prayer ; a second service will be held at 7:30 a.m. Next Saturday , an Eid carnival will be held from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Calamigos Ranch in Malibu . The holiday , which commemorates the patriarch Abraham ' s near-sacrifice of his son Isaac , falls on the 10th day_of_the_month of Zulhijah of the lunar Islamic calendar . Making a Hajj , or pilgrimage , to Mecca for this occasion is the fifth pillar of Islam -- after the declaration of faith , prayer , alms-giving and fasting during the month of Ramadan . Each year , about 2 million pilgrims undertake the journey , according to Gabalawy , who left Tuesday for the Saudi_Arabian capital . Dr. Hassan Hathout , the center ' s outreach director , said : &quot; Requiring those who can physically and financially afford to make the pilgrimage to do so once in a lifetime aims at connecting Muslims with the patriarch Abraham. &quot; The pilgrims would sacrifice a lamb and give part of it to the poor , according to tradition . Nowadays , Hathout said , people who don ' t have the facilities to slaughter a sheep donate money to societies and associations , mostly in other countries , which perform this rite and give the meat to the hungry . The holiday is also important , he pointed_out , because &quot; it reminds us of the common root of Jews , Christians and Muslims , all sharing Abraham as the patriarch and the great-grandfather of Moses , Jesus and Mohammed. &quot; Saturday ' s service is free . Tickets for the carnival are $ 20 , with_children under 5 free . Tickets must be purchased in_advance from the Islamic Center of Southern California , 434 S .
