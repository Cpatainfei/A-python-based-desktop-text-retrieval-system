   <HEADLINE> YOUR BODY / KATHLEEN DOHENY : ARMING YOURSELF WITH THE FACTS ABOUT DONATING BLOOD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Since the earthquake , Southern Californians have been rolling_up their sleeves to donate blood , says Barbara Wilks , an American Red_Cross spokeswoman . Some were responding to donation requests made when the blood supply here dropped dangerously low in early January ; other donors thought the quake might greatly increase the need for blood . &quot; The supply is now in good_shape , except for Group_O , which is in chronic short supply , &quot; Wilks says . Here , some commonly asked questions about blood donations . Question : How long does_it take_to donate blood ? Answer : The collection process takes four to 10 minutes , says Cheryle Babbitt , director of donor services for the American Red_Cross , Southern California region . Donors must first answer questions about their health and are asked to stay afterward for a_few minutes to be sure they feel OK . &quot; So allow an hour to an hour and 15 minutes , &quot; Babbitt says . Q : What type of blood is most in_demand ? A : &quot; Currently , the largest shortage is for Type_O , both negative and positive , &quot; Babbitt says . Explained simply , those with positive blood_types have a particular protein in the bloodstream , says Dr. James Mosley , USC professor of medicine and director of the Transfusion Safety Study , a government-sponsored investigation . Those with negative blood_types lack this protein . Type_O negative is the universal_donor type , because it can be given to anyone . &quot; Type_O negative is also preferred for infants , &quot; Babbitt says , &quot; because their blood_types are not yet well developed. &quot; Those with positive blood_types can receive negative blood , but those with negative cannot receive positive . About 85 % of all people have positive blood_types . Q : Which types of blood are most common ? A : Here ' s a rough breakdown of blood_types among the U.S. population , provided by the American Assn . of Blood_Banks : O positive : 37 % O negative : 7 % A positive : 36 % A negative : 6 % B positive : 9 % B negative : 1 % AB positive : 3 % AB negative : 1 % Q : What information is needed when you donate ? A : You ' re asked your weight ( on your honor ) . Your body_temperature , blood_pressure and pulse are taken . A drop of blood will be taken_to test for anemia . You don ' t need to know your blood_type . Q : Should I follow any special diet before giving blood ? A : No . Eating normally is best . Q : How much does_it hurt ? A : To simulate what it will feel_like , Babbitt says , &quot; pinch the inside of your elbow for one minute. &quot; Q : How much blood is taken ? A : About a pint . Q : Any special advice for the squeamish ? A : Alert the person who will take your blood if you have a history of fainting or dizziness so you can be watched closely . Take along a stereo headset with soothing music . Tune out other people ' s negative talk . And remember , it ' s voluntary . You can always change your mind . Q : How often can I donate blood ? A : Healthy people can donate blood every 56 days . That interval allows time for the blood supply to replenish itself . Q : Who shouldn ' t donate ? A : Pregnant women , people who weigh less than 110 pounds , people who have a cold or the flu . Q : Who can ' t donate ? A : People who are HIV-positive or at risk of being HIV-positive ; anyone who has had hepatitis_B ; certain other medical conditions , including a history of cancer , could disqualify a donor ; the Red_Cross requires donors to be at least 17 . Q : What is the risk , for donors , of coming_into contact with HIV-contaminated needles ? A : In the United States , there is no risk . A new sterile needle is used for each donor . Q : What happens to the blood after it ' s collected ? A : It goes_to a laboratory , where it is tested to determine type and whether it is negative or positive . It is tested for syphilis , hepatitis_B and C , and for HIV . The Red_Cross warns potential donors not to use donations as an opportunity for free HIV testing . If infected recently , donors may have a negative test result yet be capable of infecting others . If an infected donor is still in the window period -- which can be six months or even longer -- the virus is present but antibodies to it have not yet formed . The screening tests detect antibodies , not the virus , Babbitt says . To further minimize the chance of contaminated blood slipping through , careful attention is paid to the answers each donor gives to health questions about risk behaviors for acquiring AIDS , she says . Donors whose sample tests positive for any of the above diseases are notified , says Marcia Lane , a spokeswoman for the American Assn . of Blood_Banks . Blood that passes the tests is sent to a processing lab , where components such_as red_blood_cells , plasma and platelets are separated out . After labeling , the blood is ready for distribution to hospitals . Q : After donating , are there any special diet precautions ? A : No , although most centers offer refreshments such_as juice and crackers . The Red_Cross asks donors to relax for a_few minutes . Although most people feel fine after donating , some may have a faint feeling , upset_stomach or other minor problem . Q : What is the status of artificial_blood ? Will it make blood donations unnecessary anytime soon ? A : Several blood substitute products are under development , with many companies now involved in phase one trials , according to Biomedical Business International , a Santa Ana-based industry publication . But the race has been besieged with problems , such_as some volunteers reporting high_blood_pressure and other unexpected side_effects . Even so , some industry experts predict that artificial_blood could be_on the market in two years -- a timeline others term highly optimistic . But artificial_blood will never replace the need for human blood , says Dr. Robert Winslow , UC San Diego professor of medicine and a national expert on artificial_blood . &quot; Many blood substitutes are manufactured from human blood. &quot; Artificial blood will be used mainly for elective surgery , Winslow says , then trauma . Q : Where can I donate ? Do I need an appointment ? A : The Red_Cross conducts blood drives at many companies . There are also mobile collection units at shopping_centers and other public sites . Or call ( 800 ) 974-2113 to find a site . Making an appointment will save you time .</TEXT>
