   <HEADLINE> REGIONAL OUTLOOK ; EUROPEAN UNITY IS LOSING VIGOR ; THE DREAM SURVIVES BUT THE TIMETABLE SLOWS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fabienne de Kimpe is part of the new Europe . As a counselor at one of 200 information centers scattered across the European Union ' s 12 member countries , she advises business people on how to get_around in the union ' s vast new single market , which became a reality early last year . In her modern , ground-floor office , under a poster of a hang_glider soaring effortlessly through a sunlit sky over the word Europe , De Kimpe helps her clients come_to grips with an array of difficulties , ranging from tax questions and union standards to finding partners in the outer reaches of their expanded business world . &quot; It takes time for the awareness of these new horizons to develop , but it ' s coming , &quot; she said . &quot; What ' s lacking now is a single currency . Only then will we have a really unified market. &quot; While the idea of a single European currency makes_sense to De Kimpe and leaders of the EU states who nearly three years ago agreed to form a monetary union by the end of the century , there is no longer any certainty that it will be accomplished . Other lofty goals -- including the full economic and political union that the 12 leaders also set_down at their historic December , 1991 , summit at Maastricht , the_Netherlands -- have grown fuzzy and uncertain , while talk_of a confident , centralized union by the end of the century has all but ceased . The underlying reason for all this is not hard to find : Europe ' s leaders have quite simply lost their way . After they defied skeptics by meeting a self-imposed 1992 deadline for creating a single market without tariffs , and after they committed themselves in 1991 to political and economic unification by the end of the century , their drive toward greater European unity has faltered . Many believe that , for the union to regain its direction and its confidence , it must successfully deal with two major challenges : combatting unemployment and bridging Europe ' s former East-West divide by reaching_out to the Continent ' s new , post-Communist democracies . &quot; If we get either of these wrong , we ' re all_in deep trouble , &quot; said Stanley Crossick , chairman of the Belmont European Policy Center , a Brussels-based think_tank . Nevertheless , the achievements so far have been considerable . The union ' s member nations constitute the world ' s largest and richest consumer market . Goods , capital and people move more freely than ever on a continent that twice in this century has been racked by nationalistic wars . This new freedom has been a major factor_in the prosperity that today separates the EU West from the tumbled communism in the East . As the fathers of European unity predicted a generation ago , this economic interdependence has virtually eliminated the possibility of armed conflict among member states . Much Uncertainty But uncertainty clouds the way forward . Among senior policy-makers , debates rage on issues such_as whether the union must reform and strengthen its creaking institutions before it can even consider the task of expanding its membership across the old East-West divide . Meanwhile , a new , distinctly nationalist government has taken_over in Italy ; German Chancellor Helmut Kohl for the first time has begun complaining openly about his country ' s high contributions to the EU treasury , and Britain ' s increasingly beleaguered Prime_Minister John Major views attacks on Brussels as one of the few ways he can score political points at_home . Hopes for a monetary union , which seemed to perish amid last year ' s European monetary crisis , have once again begun to rise , but that goal too remains elusive . Western Europe ' s deepest , most prolonged recession since World_War_II has only added_to a sense of disarray . In the four decades since their idea first began to take_root , the promoters of European unity have survived several troughs of doubt during previous economic downturns . But what makes this crisis unique and more worrisome is that this time the recession is a sideshow . Today , it is impotence in the face of troubling new problems that really gnaws_at Europe ' s confidence and saps its will . &quot; Apathy , confusion and frustration have settled like mildew over the Continent , &quot; commented Werner Weidenfeld , a respected Mainz University political_scientist , in an article last month in the German daily Die Welt . &quot; What , as an idea , lifted the fantasies of generations , is , as a real political_system of a united Europe , becoming the focus of whiny accusations. &quot; Said Andre Sapir , head of the Brussels-based Institute of European Studies , &quot; People have gotten a bit lost on what Europe is about. &quot; For the new democracies of Central Europe , whose 1989 anti-Communist revolutions were in large part driven by a yearning to become part of Western Europe ' s rich , free-market democratic experience , the EU ' s loss of direction is especially disturbing . Suddenly , one of the great prizes of their success has shrunk . For the United States too , the EU ' s present malaise is critically important . For amid all that has transpired since the end of World_War_II , the union is the only institution that offers the Continent a real chance to achieve a new level of political unity and thus escape a past littered with wars of national aggression -- wars that in this century alone have cost the lives of more_than 60 million Europeans and nearly a third of a_million Americans . Indeed , beyond the visible crises -- the war in the former Yugoslav federation , simmering instability and ethnic conflict in the East , political corruption in the West -- it is the less obvious struggle between advocates of deeper European unity and the forces of nationalism that is likely to have a far greater bearing on Europe ' s fate in the 21st Century . Recent events -- including a series of direct challenges by member countries to the EU Commission ' s authority , and last month ' s choice of Luxembourg Premier Jacques Santer , a weak , uninspiring figure , to succeed the dynamic Frenchman Jacques Delors as EU Commission president -- are indicators that the flow is running against greater integration . June ' s lowest-ever voter_turnout for a European Parliament election , and the fact that the campaigns were dominated by local issues rather than the grand ideas of the future shape of Europe , underscored a broad public apathy on the fundamental questions of &quot; Why Europe ? &quot; and &quot; What kind of Europe ? &quot; And as electorates have turned inward , demanding action on jobs , crime , corruption and immigration , uncertain decision-makers retreat with them . The Jobless Problem While unemployment would seem to be linked directly to the recession , in Europe it is not . As Germany and the region ' s other major economies show signs of resuming modest growth , there is little expectation that the problem will go_away . The high cost of doing business in Western Europe , mainly due_to liberal social benefits and universal medical_care , is driving investment out of the region . At the same time , legal protection for employee job security discourages employers from any quick additions to their work_forces . An example of the problem sits on Sapir ' s desk : The laptop_computer was made in Japan and purchased in the United States at half the Brussels list_price . &quot; Europe ' s central problem is the welfare_state , &quot; former French Foreign Minister Jean Francois-Poncet told a symposium in Prague , the Czech Republic , last month . But in societies riven with age-old divisions yet so close that it is possible to drive through four countries in less than a day , state benefits are considered an essential ingredient for social peace . &quot; This is not the United States , and it is not Japan , &quot; Sapir insisted . &quot; Without this social_contract , we would n ' t have had the peace and prosperity we ' ve enjoyed. &quot; While a growing number of economists like Sapir now acknowledge that Europe needs what he terms &quot; a better balance between worker incentive and protection , &quot; politicians -- already unpopular as a class -- view any large cut_in benefits as potential political suicide . The second challenge -- how to embrace the new democracies to the East -- is equally problematic . While EU leaders know their union can survive only by erasing the old East-West divide and eventually accepting the former Soviet satellite states as members , the price is enormous . By one estimate , it would cost $ 70 billion annually just to extend the union ' s agricultural subsidies and regional assistance programs to the four most advanced Eastern countries : Hungary , Poland , Slovakia and the Czech Republic . How , officials ask , can the EU afford to integrate nations whose average per capita incomes vary between one-sixth ( Romania ) and one-half ( Hungary ) that of Portugal , the poorest member ? Such a transfer of payments could seriously undermine Western stability , senior officials maintain . While nations like Germany , Denmark and Britain see potential political and economic benefits in moving east , France and the poorer southern countries see new Eastern members as competitors in the battle for aid to depressed regions . Others , however , pointing to the potential for political instability in the East , ask how the EU can afford not to take_in these countries . So far , little has been done . Association agreements have been signed and trade liberalized , but strict limits on prime Eastern exports -- including textiles , steel and farm products -- have prevented any economic windfall for the new Eastern democracies . Meanwhile , some Eastern leaders chafe at EU ' s promptings to improve wages and labor standards . &quot; To force us to accept these externally imposed standards means to push us out_of_work , &quot; an angry Czech Prime_Minister Vaclav Klaus warned earlier this year . The lack of a blueprint for addressing these issues has diminished the union ' s standing and accentuated its impotence in dealing with other problems . The result has been a decline in public approval . &quot; ' Europe ' is perilously close to becoming a term of abuse throughout the European Union , &quot; commented the Economist last spring . In some ways , the avalanche of problems that has descended since the Maastricht Treaty was signed has caught the union at an exceptionally vulnerable time . The treaty ' s sweeping call_for economic , monetary and political union was a hasty reaction to the series of unexpected events that ended with German reunification . For both French President Francois Mitterrand and German Chancellor Kohl , the treaty was nothing less than a guarantee that Germany would never again pursue its interests in isolation . But the political and economic commitments ran far ahead of public acceptance . The fact that the treaty was poorly prepared by a leadership distracted by the mushrooming war in the former Yugoslav federation only exacerbated the problem . Many view the June , 1992 , Danish rejection of the treaty as a watershed . Even though the Danes endorsed the treaty last year in a second referendum , the effect of the initial rejection lingered . One survey earlier this year showed 60 % of European voters either undecided or against the treaty , and today even Delors himself believes it was a bad idea . &quot; We shouldn ' t have concluded a treaty on political union , &quot; he said recently . &quot; It was too soon. &quot; Pushing_Forward But despite these problems , the collective will is to push_forward . Most of the public still believes the union is &quot; a good thing. &quot; Political leaders also need little reminding that the overriding reason behind the union ' s existence remains as valid today as it did 30 years ago : reining_in an oversized Germany . &quot; We need an organized Europe to escape German domination , &quot; former French President Valery Giscard d ' Estaing said . In June , Austrians gave a boost to advocates of greater integration when they voted by an unexpectedly large majority to join the union Jan 1 . &quot; Yes &quot; votes_in similar referendums planned for Sweden , Finland and Norway this year would do much to recapture lost momentum . Favorable votes would bring the three Scandinavian_countries and Austria into a union that already includes Belgium , Denmark , France , Germany , Greece , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the_Netherlands , Portugal , Spain and Britain . Many predict that the decisive battles will come_in 1996 , when member states convene to review the terms of the Maastricht Treaty . Advocates of a tighter European unity , known as &quot; integrationists , &quot; will oppose &quot; intergovernmentalists &quot; -- those who see the future more in the form of cooperation between national governments . With as_many as 16 of the Continent ' s richest , most powerful countries discussing issues such_as common foreign and security policies and the role of national parliaments in unionwide subjects , the conference will amount to a de_facto European constitutional convention . With national leaderships generally weak and insecure , some analysts believe that whichever side manages to better mobilize public_opinion is likely to win the day . &quot; I don ' t think leaders will go much beyond what they perceive public_opinion to be , &quot; said Crossick of the Belmont European Policy Center , a professed integrationist . &quot; The real test is whether the integrationists can master the communications . &quot; It ' s all to play for. &quot; Faltering Support A poll among citizens of EU countries has shown a wavering of support for European Union membership in recent years . 1994 : 56 %</TEXT>
