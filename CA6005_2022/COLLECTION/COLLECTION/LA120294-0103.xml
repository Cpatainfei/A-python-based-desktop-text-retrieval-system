   <TEXT> People select dogs for all kinds of reasons . The Jack Russell terrier is currently the canine flavor of the month , due_to the charms of Eddie , the Jack Russell starring on TV ' s &quot; Frasier. &quot; In other times , &quot; 101 Dalmatians &quot; and &quot; Beethoven &quot; upped the popularity -- and the prices -- of Dalmatians and St . Bernards . But even though it ' s tempting to fall_in_love with a dog on-screen or even bring_home the adorable puppy for Christmas , selecting a companion of years ' duration requires planning and commitment . &quot; Once a dog comes_into my house and pees on my rug , it ' s there for life , &quot; says Warren Eckstein , author of &quot; How to Get Your Dog to Do What You Want &quot; ( Fawcett , 1994 ) . If you ' ve made the decision to get a dog for someone for Christmas , it ' s best to wrap_up a leash or biscuit with a note from Santa saying , &quot; Puppy on the way -- later. &quot; A new pet requires a safe , nurturing environment . Glass ornaments and easily toppled trees , poinsettia and mistletoe , turkey bones and chocolate are all puppy hazards . In the middle of the Christmas rush , puppies can ' t get the kind of undivided attention they need those first few days away from the litter . Then , &quot; When things get_back to normal after the holidays , the last thing people want to do is housebreak the puppy or stop it from chewing_up their new Christmas_gifts , &quot; Eckstein says . When the time comes_to get your puppy , the advantages of buying a purebred are that you can be quite sure how large it will grow and what it will look_like , and you ' ll be able to make an educated guess about its adult personality . &quot; The best source for a puppy is a responsible breeder who is concerned first with health and temperament and second with appearance , &quot; says Wayne Cavanaugh , vice_president of communications for the American Kennel Club . It ' s important to select a breeder with a good reputation and with whom you feel comfortable . Ask the breeder if you can speak_to former buyers and the veterinarian who cares_for the dogs . Inspect the kennels for cleanliness and check the temperament of the adult dogs . Don ' t be put_off by a breeder who asks you questions about your qualifications to care_for a dog . &quot; The more questions you are asked , the more responsible the breeder probably is , &quot; Cavanaugh says . For a good indication of how a puppy will look and behave , study the dam and sire . When possible , ask to see the grandparents as well . If either parent growls at you , keep looking . &quot; The mother shouldn ' t display shyness or aggression , &quot; Cavanaugh says . &quot; During lactation , it ' s common for the mother to lose some of her coat , but she shouldn ' t have mange or sores. &quot; Pedigrees are family_trees that indicate how tightly the parents and litter have been bred . In-breeding between fathers and daughters , mothers and sons , and brothers and sisters should be attempted only by breeders with decades of knowledge and experience , Cavanaugh says . The degree to which dogs can be line-bred to other relatives depends_on the size of the breed ' s gene pool and the breeder ' s expertise . Observe the litter at 7 or 8 weeks -- old enough to leave the mother . Avoid the shy puppy in the back of the box as well as the one teething on your hand . Novice dog owners are_best off with moderately active pups that greet them and then back_off . Watch the pup that interests you for as long as possible to see how it interacts with people and its littermates . &quot; The puppy should be plump and lively with sparkling eyes and a shiny coat , &quot; Eckstein says . &quot; His breath should be fresh , his gums firm and pink , and his teeth should be white . The rear should be clean , not encrusted with feces , which could indicate diarrhea or some_other illness. &quot; No matter how healthy a pup appears , it should be taken immediately to a veterinarian for an examination . The vet can tell you which defects are typical of specific breeds and check for them . For example , deafness is a problem among Dalmatians . Shar-peis routinely suffer from skin and eye problems , and breeds with dropped ears -- such_as basset_hounds -- are susceptible to ear infections and ear mites . Because hip dysplasia is common in medium-sized and large breeds , make_sure the breeder has had the parents -- and preferably also the grandparents -- certified by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals . For any breed , but especially spaniels and collies , experts also recommend that the sire and dam have a recent certification by the Canine Eye Registry Foundation . The certification , in the areas of night_blindness and progressive retinal atrophy , is valid for only one year . Breeders should be able to supply both CERF and OFA numbers for the dam and sire . Do not take the breeder ' s word that the parents ' hips and eyes are healthy . When you buy a purebred puppy , don ' t leave the kennel without a blue slip . This is not the dog ' s actual registration , but the application to register the animal with the AKC should you wish to . Also , you should have a guarantee that you can take the puppy to a veterinarian and if it is found defective , it will be replaced or your money refunded . Man ' s best_friend doesn ' t come cheap . The going rate for a &quot; pet-quality &quot; purebred puppy is $ 300 to $ 500 ; show-quality puppies run $ 400 to $ 800 . Older dogs with ribbons and titles can fetch several thousand dollars . Following the basic laws of supply and demand , a dog ' s popularity , lineage and availability largely dictate its price . Fashion and fad are also key in the pricing equation . &quot; Unlike cars , there is no sticker price when it comes_to puppies , &quot; says Sue Stalioraitis , who manages the classified advertising in Dog World magazine . &quot; AKC papers and price do not denote quality . It ' s really buyer beware. &quot;</TEXT>
