   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP ' 94 ; WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / GROUP_A PREVIEW ; SWITZERLAND AT A GLANCE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * COACH : Roy Hodgson * KEY PLAYERS : Stephane Chapuisat , Adrian Knup , Georges Bregy . * STRENGTHS : A mixture of youth and experience , a sound tactical game_plan and a determination to do_well after almost 30 years without a World Cup appearance could carry Switzerland far.Chapuisat is regarded_as one of the top strikers in Europe and Knup is no goal-scoring slouch . Bregy is the playmaker . * WEAKNESSES : The defenders are a little long in the tooth and play in the_Swiss League , hardly the strongest in Europe . That lack of experience against first-class opposition will hurt later in the tournament . * WORLD CUP HISTORY : Six previous appearances . Record of 5-11-2 . Best finish was as quarterfinalist in 1954 . * LITTLE-KNOWN FACT : When Switzerland played Austria in the 1954 World Cup , the match produced a World Cup-record 12 goals . The Austrians won , 7-5 . * OUTLOOK : The Switzerland-Romania game likely will decide which team finishes second in the first-round group behind Colombia . The Romanians are dangerous , but the_Swiss appear more focused . Reaching the last eight is a possibility , but going beyond that would be an unrealistic goal . * PREDICTED FIRST-ROUND FINISH : Second . ROSTER 03 # 05 , 20 # 12 No .
