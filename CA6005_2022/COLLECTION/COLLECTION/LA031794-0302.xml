   <HEADLINE> EDISON GETS OK TO CUT_RATE FOR MOBIL REFINERY ; ENERGY : UTILITY SAYS CUSTOMERS WOULD HAVE TO PAY MORE IF BIG INDUSTRIAL USERS LEFT TO PROCURE POWER ELSEWHERE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In what could be a glimpse into a new_world of deregulated electricity , the state Public_Utilities Commission on Wednesday approved a 25 % cut_in electric rates for Mobil Corp. ' s Torrance refinery , allowing Southern California Edison to retain its biggest customer . Though the impact of the Mobil deal -- or any single industrial discount -- on residential rates will be slight , advocates for residential users said the PUC should be making utility stockholders swallow the costs of such arrangements . But they also say the consequences of big industrial users dropping_out of utility systems could be far graver . As part of a remodeling and expansion , Mobil had planned to make its own electric_power at a cogeneration plant that also would have produced the steam needed for refinery operations . Edison countered by proposing a discount_rate for $ 700 million worth of power , and Mobil agreed . &quot; What we ' ve done is keep our largest industrial customer in the system , &quot; said Bob Bridenbecker , Edison vice_president of customer solutions . &quot; This is the best of all possible circumstances for ratepayers. &quot; As new federal and state rules allow big industrial customers more options for buying their electricity , Edison and other utilities say they must compete by lowering rates -- or else raise everyone ' s rates dramatically to pay their fixed costs when big users go elsewhere for electricity . Though other customers will face a rate increase to make_up for Mobil ' s discount , Edison and the PUC say that without Mobil , other ratepayers would have to bear $ 100 million to $ 180 million in fixed operating_costs over the 15-year life of the contract . &quot; Some costs that were being loaded onto Mobil ' s tariff rates will now have to be picked_up by Edison ' s other customers , but it ' s a lot less than if Mobil had left Edison ' s system , &quot; said James Boothe , chief_of_staff in the PUC president ' s office . Industrial customers already pay generally lower rates than residential or smaller commercial customers , in part because it costs less to supply them . While an industrial customer may be able to take bulk electricity at 66 # 000 volts , residential and commercial customers require current reductions , as well as all_the associated transformers and power_lines that distribute electricity house-to-house . Edison charges residential users 12 cents a kilowatt_hour ; industrial users pay an average of 7 cents a kilowatt_hour , with some industrial customers paying as little as 4 cents . Mobil ' s rate will drop from 6.8 cents to 5.1 cents . &quot; This particular deal is going_to have an almost infinitesimal effect on ratepayer rates , &quot; said Robert Finkelstein , staff attorney at Toward Utility Rate Normalization , a San Francisco-based consumer advocacy group . &quot; But on the larger scale , we think that if ( utilities ) are going_to be giving these discounts , they ought to pay_for them with shareholder money. &quot; The greatest benefit of keeping big industrial users in a utility ' s system goes_to the utility , not ratepayers , Finkelstein said , and so shareholders should make_up the difference in fixed costs . Indeed , since the late 1980s , when Atlantic Richfield Co . and other big industrial customers set_up their own power_plants , Edison has been fighting to keep customers on the system , Bridenbecker said , while the state ' s weak economy has reduced its business base .</TEXT>
