   <HEADLINE> SWIMMING / WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS ; VAN ALMSICK AND DOLAN SET RECORDS AS CHINESE SETTLE FOR SILVER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two world_records were set_on the second day of swimming ' s World Championships , and because neither was by a Chinese woman , the water in the Foro Italico pool seemed a lot calmer Tuesday than it had the day before . That doesn ' t mean the Chinese disappeared . They added two silver medals to the three golds and a silver they had won Monday and have already equaled their medal total in the 1991 World Championships . But at least for one day , they were in the shadows of Germany ' s Franziska van Almsick and the United States ' Tom Dolan . Dolan , a part-time disc_jockey when he is not swimming or studying at the University of Michigan , swam the 400-meter individual medley in 4 minutes 12.30 seconds , beating the previous record of 4:12.36 set two years ago by Hungary ' s Tamas Darnyi . Considering the four-time world and Olympic champion Darnyi ' s stature , eclipsing one of his records is impressive . Some grander description , however , is required for van Almsick ' s 200-meter freestyle time of 1:56.78. Perhaps already , at 16 , the richest swimmer in the sport ' s history , she now has proven herself one of the fastest , beating German Heike Friedrich ' s eight-year-old record of 1:57.55 by more_than three-quarters of a second . After reporters had interrogated China ' s Le Jingyi , when she broke the 100-meter freestyle record Monday by almost a half-second , about alleged drug use among her country ' s athletes , it was only fair that they should ask van Almsick about her training regimen . But although the questions were asked , they did not have the same zing . Perhaps , as Chinese officials often suggest , that was the result of cultural bias by the primarily Western reporters who cover swimming . Or perhaps it was because they were more interested in discovering the details of a day that is bound to remain memorable for van Almsick . Tired after winning bronze and silver medals Monday night in the 100 freestyle and the 800-meter relay , van Almsick tried to conserve energy in the 200 freestyle preliminaries little more_than 12 hours later . She conserved too_much . Although she was second in her heat , her time of 2:01.55 was the ninth-fastest overall . Only eight advance to the final . The eighth qualifier , however , was van Almsick ' s teammate , Dagmar Hase . Their coaches met after the preliminaries and , recognizing that van Almsick had a better chance to win a medal , agreed that van Almsick should replace Hase in the final . Still , van Almsick had to be convinced that she was doing the right thing . Perhaps it was her desire to erase any doubt that propelled her to the world_record . Just as likely , it was the competition from China ' s Lu Bin , whose second-place time of 1:56.89 also beat the previous world_record . Costa Rica ' s Claudia Poll finished third in 1:57.61. Far behind in fourth and fifth were the United States ' Cristina Teuscher in 2:00.18 and Olympic champion Nicole Haislett in 2:00.30. There was speculation within the German media that Hase was paid to step aside , which van Almsick vigorously denied . But if it were true , she would never miss the money . Already a star in Germany after winning four Olympic medals at 14 two years ago in the Barcelona Games , van Almsick ' s popularity reached heights previously reserved only for Steffi Graf by winning seven more -- six golds -- in last year ' s European Championships . Photogenic , personable and , according to Der Spiegel magazine , the first successful athlete in half a century to be embraced by all_of Germany -- not just the East or the West -- she has signed sponsorship deals reportedly worth $ 10 million over four years . For one with a Swiss chocolate manufacturer , she replaced super model Claudia Schiffer as spokeswoman . Van Almsick ' s mother was an East Berlin speedskating and rhythmic gymnastics coach who has been exposed as a former informer for the government ' s secret_police , the Stasi . Among East_Germans , that is hardly_a unique distinction . But van Almsick was barely touched by the fall of the Berlin Wall , which occurred when she was 11 . She recalls that day primarily because she was able to walk into West_Berlin for ice_cream . Her special sports school closed , but she has continued to train with her coach . Their first separation will occur this fall . Van Almsick plans to attend high_school in Coral Gables , Fla. , for three months so that she can improve her English . The other world record-setter Tuesday was not even the most famous individual medley swimmer in his home pool at Ann Arbor , Mich . That distinction belongs_to Eric Namesnik , who finished second to Darnyi in the 400 IM at the 1991 World Championships and 1992 Olympics . If anyone seemed likely to beat Darnyi ' s record , it was Namesnik . But he was no match for Dolan , finishing third in 4:15.69. Finland ' s Jani Sievinen was second in 4:13.29. Dolan qualified for the U.S. team in last month ' s national championships at Indianapolis despite an asthma_attack that forced him into the hospital for observation . A more apparent , but less distressing , physical problem in Indianapolis was a goatee that was not the same color as the hair on his head because they were touched by differing amounts of chlorine and sun . When he shaved and tapered for this meet , the first thing to go was the goatee . &quot; To tell the truth , I got kind of sick_of it , &quot; he said . &quot; So did my parents. &quot;</TEXT>
