   <HEADLINE> GREENBACK ' S STABILITY IS PUZZLER OF FOREIGN_EXCHANGE ; CURRENCY : DEALERS SEE MANY REASONS FOR THE DOLLAR ' S VALUE TO FLUCTUATE . INSTEAD THEY ARE FACED WITH SLUGGISHNESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> These are nervous times for foreign_exchange dealers Chris Manno and Stephen Flanagan . Sitting before blinking computer_screens amid the trading room cacophony , the two PaineWebber currency traders say they are perplexed by the dollar ' s sluggishness , given the volatility of the stock and bond markets in the last few months . &quot; We ' re not the only ones scratching our heads over why the dollar hasn ' t reacted lately , &quot; said Flanagan , who joined PaineWebber last fall and has been a currency trader for 11 years . &quot; It has become apparent that the dollar has become completely divorced from fundamentals. &quot; The Dow Jones industrial average has slumped 7 % since it reached an all-time high on Jan . 31 , although it has rallied in recent sessions . Bond prices have been pummeled the last few months , and the yield of the Treasury ' s 30-year bond has risen to the highest level of the Clinton_Administration . But bonds have also recovered recently . Yet the dollar has languished , trading in narrow ranges against the Japanese yen and German mark , although events in those nations might have moved the foreign_exchange markets at other times . Manno , like Flanagan , specializes in dollar-yen trading . He said the dollar should also be reacting to trends in other markets . &quot; There are so many factors that can affect currency trading , &quot; said Manno , who is chief spot dealer at PaineWebber . &quot; . . . political news , economic news , foreign , rumors and sentiment -- any one of them can move the market , but lately none of them have been. &quot; In Japan , political gridlock has stalled efforts to reconvene trade talks with the United States . Hata faces the prospect of ruling without a majority in Parliament , yet the dollar has hovered between 102.5 and 105 yen since Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa resigned April 8 . Win Thin , an international economist with MCM Currencywatch Inc. , said the market ' s perception of a lack of progress on U.S.-Japanese trade issues will continue to hamper the dollar . &quot; Market sentiment isn ' t easy to change , &quot; he said . In Germany , meanwhile , the central_bank has lowered interest_rates , an action that usually bolsters the dollar because lower foreign rates make U.S. investments more attractive . The dollar has been stalled between 1.67 and 1.72 marks for the past month . &quot; It ' s a very frustrating market , so it ' s hard to make money right now , &quot; said Margaret Koudaraskas , foreign_exchange technical analyst at Technical Data , a financial research firm in Boston . &quot; Any rise in the dollar relative to other currencies brings immediate selling , to lock_in profits . And investors remain timid on dollar buying , because of a lingering concern over stock_market corrections and bond interest_rates moving higher. &quot; &quot; Every rally is undermined before it really gets_going , &quot; she said . William Sterling , manager of international economics at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. , said negative publicity about hedge_funds and derivatives has also affected currency markets . Derivatives are investments tied to the performances of underlying stocks , bonds and currencies . They are a way of hedging , or offsetting , sharp market fluctuations . Also , hedge_funds can borrow large amounts_of_money . Some companies and fund managers took big losses when their currency or bond holdings dropped_in value relative to the interest they were paying on debt . They were forced to sell , further eroding their holdings and the market . Now , as regulators pressure banks and brokerages to divulge details about their holdings in derivatives and hedge_funds , there is less speculative cash flowing into the currency markets , Sterling said . &quot; Many traders have been sitting on the sidelines waiting for the market to sort itself out , &quot; he said . Meanwhile , U.S. interest_rates have been rising . Analysts are surprised that the dollar has not reacted significantly to the combination of rising U.S. rates and falling German rates .</TEXT>
