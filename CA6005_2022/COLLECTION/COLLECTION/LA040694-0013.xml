   <HEADLINE> TWO OLD PROS FACE THE S . AFRICAN GALE ; KISSINGER AND CARRINGTON WILL SEEK TO MEDIATE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Now that just about everything else has failed to resolve the political impasse and stop the mounting body_count in South_Africa , two internationally respected diplomats , Henry A . Kissinger and Britain ' s Lord Peter Carrington , will try their experienced hands . Just another desperate grasp for peace in South_Africa ? Maybe . But it ' s definitely worth a try , given the way the unexpected has come_to happen lately in that troubled nation . Kissinger and Carrington will mediate at the request of the Transitional Executive_Council , currently the governmental decision-making body , and with permission from President Frederik W . de Klerk and Nelson Mandela , the heir_apparent to the presidency . They will need more_than good_luck to entice the powerful Zulu minority to put_down its weapons and participate in the April 26-28 balloting , which is certain to elect its hated rival , Mandela . CREDENTIALS GALORE : Although he had little to show for his role in the European Union peace conference on Bosnia , Carrington , a former British foreign_minister , is knowledgeable_about Africa and enjoys credibility in the region . In neighboring Zimbabwe , he brokered a similar impasse , ending the Rhodesia war and allowing the transition from a white-dominated British colony to a black-run country . Kissinger , former U.S. secretary_of_state , has a large and deep foreign affairs portfolio . De Klerk and Mandela are scheduled to meet on Friday with the power-hungry Zulu chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi , who heads the small but potent Inkatha Freedom Party , and the figurehead Zulu king , Goodwill Zwelethini . The Zulu leaders want an independent nation that would be heavily subsidized by the government . Allowing a Zulu secession would Balkanize South_Africa and encourage conservative whites in their own campaign for independence . As the Zulu leaders talk , their fanatical adherents live under a government state of emergency , imposed by De Klerk -- ironically , with Mandela ' s blessing . Mandela ' s followers , supporters of his powerful African National Congress , once fought a similar state of emergency that the white minority government imposed in trying to stall the drive toward democracy . WEIRD LANDSCAPE : Currently , state security_forces are_on patrol in Natal province , which includes the quasi-independent Zulu homeland , KwaZulu . Once again , the topsy-turvy politics of South_Africa are evident . According to the independent Goldstone Commission , established by De Klerk , several senior security leaders colluded with Zulu forces and provided them with sophisticated arms to do battle with the ANC . The police now must walk a fine line , containing the Zulus without triggering a monstrous blood bath . Who would have thought that Mandela would support a state of emergency declared by the government , or that police_forces once secretly allied_with the Zulus would face them as opponents ? The unpredictability of the political winds in South_Africa may be Kissinger and Carrington ' s best ally .</TEXT>
