   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE ROAD TO RECOVERY ; QUAKE DUST LINKED TO INFANTS ' ILLS ; HEALTH : DOCTORS SUSPECT THAT BACTERIA-RICH PARTICLES KICKED_UP BY THE TEMBLOR ARE THE REASON THREE L.A.-AREA BABIES HAVE CONTRACTED A RARE , LIFE-THREATENING ILLNESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In an unusual side_effect of the Northridge earthquake , three Los Angeles-area babies have contracted infant botulism , a rare , life-threatening illness that health officials believe may have been caused by bacteria-rich dust kicked_up by the temblor . Two children remain in intensive care units with the malady , which results from swallowing bacterial spores that live_in soil throughout California . The third child was recently discharged from a hospital . Infant botulism differs from adult botulism , which is caused by eating tainted food , because a baby can develop the illness by ingesting spores contained in particles of soil . State health officials said most cases of infant botulism seem to stem from construction , farming , earthquake or landslides , which create dust in the air . The botulism toxin causes muscle paralysis , breathing problems and other disturbances to the nervous_system . Although no deaths from infant botulism have been reported in California in a decade , the malady can leave babies so sick that they must be kept alive on mechanical ventilators for weeks or months . There is no known antidote . Health authorities said dust thrown into the air by the Jan . 17 temblor is the most likely cause of the outbreak because all_the infants live_in areas that were violently shaken and showed symptoms only after the quake . The babies are from Santa Monica , Granada Hills and Canyon Country . &quot; I thought it was pretty far-fetched at first , but now I ' m convinced after we thought_back to the day of the earthquake , &quot; said Andy Orescanin , 29 , a heavy equipment mechanic from Canyon Country whose 3-month-old son is in intensive care at a Kaiser hospital in Los Angeles . &quot; When there was that big aftershock , we saw the dust just rolling_over the_hills . Just clouds and clouds of dust , &quot; said Orescanin , who spent the day sitting in the family van with the doors open after his home was damaged . Jin Yoon , a Granada Hills homemaker whose 6-week-old daughter is_on a ventilator in the pediatrics intensive care unit of Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles , said her home , too , was damaged in the quake . She and her baby spent the day in a car as thick dust settled over their neighborhood . &quot; We saw the dust falling_down from the roof , &quot; said Yoon , 24 . &quot; We were outside the whole day. &quot; Because of its large land mass and high birthrate , California has about half of the 75 to 100 cases of infant botulism diagnosed annually in the United States . The symptoms of the disease , which only strikes infants less than a year old , include constipation , poor eating , weak cry , poor head control and general listlessness . The botulism poison , produced in the large_intestine , slowly damages nerve endings and often leads to partial or complete paralysis and serious respiratory problems . In mild cases , hospitalized babies are fitted with feeding tubes because they cannot swallow properly . In one-third to one-half of all cases , babies must be put_on ventilators so they can breathe . If such treatments are not administered , the poison can fatally injure the nervous_system . But most children recover after they begin to develop some immunity to the toxin and their nerve endings regenerate spontaneously . Survivors usually recover full nerve and muscle function , said Dr. Robert Schechter , an infant botulism expert with the state_Department of Health Services in Berkeley . Yoon and Orescanin said their babies got sick 10 days to two weeks after the quake . Orescanin said the first sign was that his son , Thomas , was not eating well . At first , he and his wife thought the baby had the flu . But he got progressively weaker . &quot; We noticed that when we held him . . . he felt_like a wet noodle , &quot; Orescanin said . Later , the child became dehydrated , had difficulty breathing and &quot; his face got real long , like he was losing his facial muscles. &quot; The third victim , a 3 1 / 2-month-old Santa Monica girl , was discharged after a short stay_at Cedars-Sinai Medical_Center . The overall U.S. fatality rate for infant botulism is unknown , partly because some mild cases are never diagnosed and because the disease is sometimes mistaken for other maladies . A 1977 study indicated that nine of 211 deaths attributed to sudden_infant_death_syndrome in California may actually have been caused by unrecognized infant botulism . But Schechter said that among babies that reach the hospital , the death rate is less than 1 % . Dr. Wendy Mitchell , a professor of neurology and pediatrics at USC School_of_Medicine , said infant botulism is often misdiagnosed , especially in sparsely populated areas where few cases surface . &quot; If you don ' t know what it looks_like , it looks_like everything else that goes_wrong with a little infant -- infections , metabolic problems , &quot; Mitchell said . Orescanin said doctors initially misdiagnosed the problem in his son . One physician said the baby had the flu , another said it had &quot; a genetic defect , &quot; Orescanin said . He said that &quot; after a lot of praying , &quot; his son was seen by a doctor at the Kaiser hospital in Panorama City who recognized the disease . &quot; She had never seen it before , but she had heard of it , &quot; he said . Yoon said she went_to five different doctors before the malady was finally recognized at Childrens Hospital . Her baby had turned white and briefly stopped breathing before being admitted . &quot; She can ' t breathe , so she ' s breathing by machine , &quot; said Yoon . &quot; But she ' s doing fine . She ' s doing great right now. &quot; Dr. Stephen Arnon , head of the state health department ' s infant botulism program , said doctors are not certain that airborne spores in dust caused the outbreak , but that is the most likely explanation . &quot; California is just very generously endowed with spores . They ' re everywhere , &quot; he said . &quot; There was a quake and that kicked_up dust_clouds . We know that ' s where the bacteria live . So there is a suspicion that the quake kind of triggered &quot; the outbreak . State researchers are checking records to see if earlier quakes prompted outbreaks of infant botulism . Schechter said two cases were reported in the Bay Area after the 1989 Loma Prieta quake , but they are within the expected number of cases for the region and it is not clear if they were related to the temblor . Arnon said each of the three sick infants in Los Angeles County has been enrolled in a clinical trial of a drug called botulism immune globulin , originally developed by the Army as an antidote for germ_warfare . Researchers hope the drug , also known as BIG , will prove effective in arresting the malady , although it is not expected to be an antidote . The trial , supervised by the state health department , began two years ago . More_than 50 infants are being studied , but only half have been injected with the substance . The other half receive a placebo . Researchers believe the drug may work by preventing botulism toxin from attaching itself to nerve endings . While it is hoped the drug can stop the illness from getting_worse , &quot; it is not a dramatic antidote to existing illness , &quot; Arnon said .</TEXT>
