   <HEADLINE> SPEECH BY PRESIDENT MANDELA IS A SIGN OF VICTORY FOR U.N. ; SOUTH_AFRICA : GENERAL_ASSEMBLY HAD BATTLED APARTHEID SYSTEM , NOW GONE PARTLY BECAUSE OF THAT PRESSURE . NEW LEADER VOWS TO ATTACK COUNTRY ' S RACISM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Symbolizing one of the great triumphs of the United Nations , Nelson Mandela addressed the General_Assembly on Monday for the first time as president of South_Africa and pledged to wipe_out racism in his divided country . &quot; The road that we shall have to travel_to reach this destination will by no means be easy , &quot; he told the General_Assembly . &quot; All of us know how stubbornly racism can cling_to the mind and how deeply it can infect the human soul . &quot; . . . And yet however hard this battle will be , &quot; he went_on , &quot; we will not surrender. &quot; The symbolism for the United Nations was clear . For decades , the General_Assembly had mounted a vigorous campaign against the racist apartheid system of South_Africa and its imprisonment of Mandela , the country ' s most prominent African nationalist leader . The relentless campaign , which prompted many countries to impose sanctions , made South_Africa a pariah among nations and contributed to the atmosphere that finally persuaded its white leaders to give_up apartheid . The United Nations focused_on Mandela from the start . In 1963 , months before he was convicted of &quot; sabotage &quot; for his anti-apartheid agitation and sentenced to life in prison , the General_Assembly passed a resolution calling_on South_Africa to abandon the trial . Since his release from prison in 1990 , Mandela , 76 , has spoken_to the United Nations twice . But this visit was his first since his election as president in April . Speaking slowly in booming tones , Mandela , dressed in a gray suit , said that the historic change in South_Africa &quot; has come_about not least because of the great efforts in which the U.N. engaged to ensure the suppression of the apartheid crime against humanity. &quot; &quot; The millions of our people , &quot; he went_on , &quot; say thank_you and thank_you again that the respect for your own dignity as human_beings inspired you to act to ensure the restoration of our dignity as well. &quot; Mandela began his speech by noting that &quot; it surely must be one of the great ironies of our age that this august assembly is addressed , for the first time in 49 years , by a South_African head_of_state drawn from among the African majority of what is an African country. &quot; While pledging that he and his people intend to create &quot; a truly non-racial society , &quot; Mandela said their success would &quot; depend_on our ability to change the material conditions of life of our people so that they not only have the vote , but they have bread and work as well. &quot; Without being specific , Mandela said his country needs outside help . He repeated this later at a 40-minute news_conference , telling reporters he was in the United States to &quot; ask the Americans to throw their markets open_to South Africa. &quot; But , he went_on , &quot; I ' m not coming here with cap in_hand . I ' m coming here as a representative of a sovereign and proud country . I don ' t want charity . . . . But investment in South_Africa will be of mutual benefit to the United States and the people of South Africa. &quot; He said that South_Africa especially wants &quot; investors to enter into partnerships with black business. &quot; In other business , a special commission on human_rights accused elements of the Hutu majority in Rwanda of genocide in trying to wipe_out the Tutsi minority &quot; in a concerted , planned , systematic and methodical way &quot; after the president died in a plane crash in April . The commission also concluded that both the Hutu government forces and the Tutsi-dominated rebels who now run Rwanda were guilty of &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; from April to July . But the commission said it had no evidence that Tutsis tried to commit genocide .</TEXT>
