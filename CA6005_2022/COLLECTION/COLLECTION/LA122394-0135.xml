   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : SAN MIGUEL ISLAND ; FISHERMAN FOUND SAFE BY COAST GUARD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A missing commercial fisherman was found safe Thursday off San Miguel Island after a search by Coast Guard officials , authorities said . Michael Carney , 42 , of Thousand Oaks , who returned home Thursday , was reported missing Wednesday after he was two days overdue from a commercial fishing outing , Coast Guard officials said . Carney ' s wife notified authorities Wednesday night , concerned because the fisherman had already postponed his return once due_to fierce winds and turbulent seas off the coast of San Miguel Island , the Coast Guard said . After nightlong efforts to reach Carney by radio , the Coast Guard command in Long_Beach dispatched a search plane and rescue helicopter to find the 40-foot trawler . &quot; More_than 90 % of the time , overdue people are not in distress , but we cannot take chances , &quot; Coast Guard Petty_Officer Eric Dee Jager said . &quot; This guy was supposed to be back Monday and we couldn ' t reach him by radio , so the most prudent thing was to send up the aircraft. &quot; After a morning-long search Thursday , pilots spotted Carney ' s craft anchored in a cove off San Miguel Island . He had been waiting for the storm system that has generated recent rough swells to pass and had not been monitoring his radio , the Coast Guard said . The search operation cost about $ 5 # 000 and will not be billed to the Carneys . &quot; It ' s always smart to call us in when a boat is overdue , especially in this kind of weather , &quot; Dee Jager said . &quot; We ' re just happy this one ended the way it did. &quot; MATTHEW MOSK</TEXT>
