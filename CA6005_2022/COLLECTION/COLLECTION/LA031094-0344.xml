   <HEADLINE> OC HIGH : STUDENT NEWS &amp; VIEWS ; ATTITUDE ADJUSTMENT ; EQUALITY AND RESPECT ARE TOP REQUESTS BY STUDENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Disrespect has many faces , a survey of students at Villa Park High_School found . It can show itself in an attitude , a remark , a look . When asked how disrespect is most often expressed , students said 49 % of the time it is verbally , 35 % of the time through body_language and attitude and 16 % of the time physically . That finding was among results of a schoolwide poll that sought to determine student attitudes about the state of dignity and respect on campus . The survey was conducted in English_classes in November and December . Students surveyed said they most wanted to be treated equally . They said signs of equal treatment include &quot; fairness , &quot; &quot; no favoritism , &quot; &quot; not being put_down &quot; and &quot; not being judged by stereotypes of religion or race. &quot; &quot; I believe being treated with dignity is not being treated especially good or bad . I expect to be treated just like everyone else , with the respect every single human deserves , &quot; Jonathan Gibbs said . Surprisingly simple actions show respect , students said . &quot; Respect isn ' t always displayed correctly , &quot; Dan Russell said . &quot; You should show respect_to those who deserve it , not because they own a letterman ' s jacket or the best car or ( have ) the most money. &quot; Laurie Viet agreed : &quot; Dignity is being treated with the same respect other people receive . It is having your ideas listened to without judgment. &quot; Sometimes the smallest things can make the biggest difference . &quot; I consider being treated with dignity ( to be ) giving someone space when they ' re down and just basically being friendly , &quot; Steve Roach said . &quot; If someone holds the door for someone else , that is respect , &quot; Shawn Webber said . Similarly , small and perhaps even unintentional remarks can take a heavy toll . Comments were reported to make_up half of disrespectful behavior either witnessed or experienced by students . Examples frequently mentioned include name calling , talking back and racial slurs . Also , comments that are intended to be funny can be offensive . Girls especially feel insulted when , as Kryss McKeon-Cawley said , &quot; guys use us as playthings , and they don ' t think we have feelings. &quot; A perceived attitude and body_language can also send powerful signals of disrespect . &quot; Rolling of eyes , &quot; giving &quot; bad looks , &quot; &quot; walking away , &quot; &quot; not listening &quot; or simply &quot; ignoring &quot; others come_across as degrading , the survey found . Overt physical behavior amounts to only a small percentage of the concerns expressed in the survey . However , strong condemnation was registered against spitting , pushing , vandalizing and smoking . &quot; Graffiti and other vandalism makes me sick . Why would people want to ( make ) cities look_like trash ? &quot; Ryan Chevalier asked . As Colin Hall said : &quot; I feel running_around school behaving like monkeys while using bad language shows a lack of respect for others . Most want school to be a calm , cool , learning place , not a jungle gym. &quot; Many students felt that nothing can be done to increase the level of respect and dignity given to students on campus . They cited &quot; tradition , &quot; &quot; habit &quot; and &quot; that ' s just the way it is &quot; as reasons . Although there is no easy solution , if approached on an individual level , conditions may gradually improve , students said . Small steps suggested include &quot; listening to others &quot; and &quot; forgiving their faults. &quot; Jennifer Shen suggested students should &quot; refrain_from embarrassing one another. &quot; Or , as Ayala Younger said : &quot; I think that people have to trust others more and think_about what they say or do beforehand. &quot;</TEXT>
