   <HEADLINE> COMPUTER_FILE / RICHARD O ' REILLY : SOFTWARE LETS CONFEREES SHARE SCREEN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> How many times have you huddled over someone else ' s computer_screen , collaborating on a project ? But what if the computer_screen you need to see is across town -- or even across the country ? Now there ' s &quot; personal conference &quot; software that allows two people on two computers connected by a telephone modem to collaborate interactively by revising or critiquing the same screen image . This promises to be a fast-evolving family of products , so you can look_forward soon to being able to share actual data files , not just images of them , or share a computer_program or participate in a session with two others . Among the competitors are Intel Corp . ( ( 800 ) 538-3373 ) , whose ProShare family of products ranges from a $ 99 entry-level program to a $ 2 # 499 package that includes live video . DataBeam Corp . ( ( 800 ) 877-2325 ) has FarSite for Windows , available bundled with a trend-setting modem from AT &amp; T that can transmit voice and data simultaneously over a standard telephone_line . Crosswise Corp . ( ( 408 ) 459-9060 ) has Face to Face , a Mac-to-Mac product , with a Mac-to-Windows version scheduled for release in April . What all_of these programs have in common is that they allow two computer users to link screens via phone_line and carry_on a &quot; discussion &quot; about a document appearing on both screens . They &quot; talk &quot; by typing and using various graphics tools to highlight portions of the image in_colors , or by drawing symbols or writing_on the screens with their mice . At the entry level of this category of software , the screen images are just &quot; bit-mapped &quot; copies of whatever documents each participant has chosen to prepare in_advance of the electronic conference . It ' s just as if you had printed the documents on paper and passed them out at a meeting for everyone to mark_up . When the meeting is over , you ' ll have the marked-up image files_in your computer , just as you would have marked-up pages . You ' ll still have to make the agreed changes in the original files . But , unlike life with paper , each participant can quickly add images of new files to the on-line conference while it is underway . Each of the programs has its own design metaphor to try to make its use more intuitive . FarSite treats its screen images as if they were a series of slides to be projected . ProShare ' s screen resembles a page in a spiral-bound notebook , with tabs on the side to let you easily choose which page to view . The Face to Face screen simply presents images in a &quot; document window , &quot; much as if you were viewing a printed page on the screen . This $ 295 program allows comments to be superimposed on the document image , like paper Post-It notes . These programs require virtually no knowledge of the communications arcana ( about protocols and parameters ) that makes ordinary computer-to-computer modem connections so difficult . The downside is that both participants have to have the same program , although not necessarily the same kind of modem or even the same speed of modem . Intel ' s $ 99 ProShare has one advantage over the others : You can use it to connect to another computer that has modem software but not ProShare , and the program will up-load a receive-only copy of itself to the other computer . The user of that machine can then answer ProShare calls , but would have to buy a full version of the program to be able to call others . FarSite is particularly useful because of the unique voice capability of the AT &amp; T modem available as a $ 549 modem-software bundle . ( The software alone is $ 179. ) When the program is operating in data-only mode , it can transmit at 14 # 400 bits a second . If each user has a telephone connected to the modem , all one has to do is pick_up the receiver during a FarSite session and the telephone at the other end will ring . The data speed falls to 4 # 800 bits a second while you ' re talking , but jumps up automatically as soon as The advantage is that with only a single phone_line shared by computer and voice phone , you can simultaneously engage in an on-screen markup session and discuss the details with your collaborator . Of course , in offices where modems have their own telephone_lines , you can use any of these products and talk_over the voice line while communicating at full modem speed over the separate data line . The high ground in computer conference products is held by Intel ' s ProShare Video system , which is typically bought through the telephone_company at huge discounts off its $ 2 # 499 list_price . The telephone_company is going_to make its money selling you an ultra-high-speed telephone_line , called ISDN service , to accommodate the mass of data the Intel system transmits . In addition , you will need a powerful computer , at least a 486 machine running at 33 megahertz , and with two empty slots inside to hold the two processor cards that come_with the ProShare system . You also get a small video camera housed in a squat case designed to sit on top of your monitor and capture your image as you work_at the computer . A small combination earphone-microphone takes_care of the audio . Video conferencing is not as easy as voice , despite the clever design of the ProShare software . The video image , which can be an eighth as large as your screen or as small as a thumbnail , is broadcast at half the number of frames per second we see on broadcast television . Movement is jerky and resolution is quite grainy . Despite the high band width available on the expensive ISDN phone_line required for the system , the video signal is blanked_out while data is being transmitted , such_as when sending the next page in the spiral notebook . But what is considerably more disconcerting is that the audio signal is lost as well . On the other hand , you can send segments from a videotape or any other video signal over the system , and you can move the small Intel camera around to portray objects that aren ' t in your computer_files , such_as photographs or product samples .</TEXT>
