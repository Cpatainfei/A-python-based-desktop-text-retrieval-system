   <HEADLINE> EARTHWATCH : SHUTTLE ' S EYE IN THE SKY IS A WAY TO FIGHT SMOG ; ENDEAVOUR ' S DOWNLINK TO EARTH PROVIDES A REAL EDUCATION IN ENVIRONMENTAL_SCIENCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While the space shuttle Endeavour was flying over Ventura County earlier this week , I listened via a special phone hookup by way of the Kennedy and Johnson space centers to the astronauts talking_about what they saw . Billed as an &quot; environmental shuttle , &quot; their vehicle carried the most advanced radar ever flown in space for environmental monitoring -- capable of delivering three-dimensional images , day or night , penetrating clouds , vegetation and even the surface of a desert . Also on board was a device to measure carbon_monoxide accumulation -- one of the constituents of smog -- anywhere on earth . I heard veteran astronaut Peter ( Jeff ) Wisoff explaining to a reporter at Cape Kennedy that all this equipment added_up to &quot; a global eye to look over our environment and keep our world a nice place to live. &quot; Most media reports of the 11-day flight covered what the astronauts were looking down on in Asia and the North_Sea . But I was able to eavesdrop as Wisoff , a Stanford-trained Ph.D , passed right over our coast and confessed to homesickness , intoning the landmarks passing beneath him , &quot; Monterey Bay , the Big Valley , Ventura , San Diego . . . this is my favorite run. &quot; I wasn ' t the only person in our neighborhood keeping track of the Endeavour mission . Thousand Oaks High_School science_teacher Susan Thee told me &quot; we load data ( from the shuttle ) right into our school computers via modem and an 800 number. &quot; The data initially comes_to Earth as computer bytes -- enough to fill a carton of floppies six miles long -- and is turned_into pictures at Caltech ' s Jet_Propulsion Lab in Pasadena for scientists and students on the Internet . &quot; Our kids are doing real live applicable science , &quot; Thee said . One class project involves comparing , at local sites and around the nation , the health of live_oak trees near and far from freeways . The availability of raw scientific data via modem has made_possible a new approach to teaching science . Recent shuttle flights , she said , &quot; are providing perfect stuff , actual data . I don ' t want textbooks anymore . We can open_up the whole world to students , not just 500 pages. &quot; Real-life environmental research has had some real-life effects on the students at Thousand Oaks High . According to Principal Keith Wilson , their college entrance test scores have improved dramatically since the computer-based work started two years ago . Just a bit up the coast , at UC Santa Barbara , this week ' s environmental shuttle data was greeted as &quot; a bonanza from space , &quot; according to UCSB ' s press_release . I was able to experience the event and its impact on scientists at UCSB by listening simultaneously on two phones . On one , astronauts described the Amazon forest below them , and , on the other , UCSB biologist John Melack , who is a leading expert on the Amazon_River ' s flooding patterns , discussed his research based on the radar images being transmitted to Earth . Among the shuttle ' s many instruments , the one beaming down data on smog-related carbon_monoxide is of local interest , since Ventura County , alas , gets poor marks from the Environmental Protection Agency in this category . The device on the shuttle is scarcely the size of a suitcase , but it has a big name and a big environmental purpose : Measurement of Air_Pollution from Satellites , or MAPS . The goal is to pinpoint concentrated carbon_monoxide levels -- where they ' re originating and where they ' re drifting . These new shuttle pictures may eventually be combined with other data being generated at Caltech and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . These schools and others are involved in a quest to determine &quot; soot signatures &quot; -- the exact source of visible airborne particulates -- eventually perhaps by address . Polluters beware : Big Brother is watching from the shuttle . And kid brother too , if he ' s enrolled at Thousand Oaks High_School .
