   <HEADLINE> STATE PROBE FINDS 370 # 000-GALLON TOXIC SPILL ; ENVIRONMENT : OFFICIALS SAY OIL BYPRODUCT LEAKED FROM A RUPTURED TEXACO PIPELINE NEAR SCHOOL CANYON ROAD NORTH OF VENTURA .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A yearlong investigation by state officials has uncovered a 370 # 000-gallon leak of a toxic oil byproduct , a spill believed to be among the largest oil-related accidents in Ventura County history , authorities said Wednesday . Officials with the state_Department of Fish and Game said they believe that gas condensate -- a byproduct that occurs when oil is converted into gasoline -- leaked from a ruptured Texaco pipeline near School Canyon Road near the company ' s Ventura County headquarters . The spill was first reported as a minor accident in January , 1993 . Investigators from the state and the Ventura County district_attorney ' s office obtained a search_warrant this week in an effort to find_out how quickly Texaco reported the leak and what was done to stop it . Authorities said the spill north of Ventura is believed to be far larger than the Jan . 17 spill of 215 # 000 gallons of crude into the Santa Clara River and a spill of 84 # 000 gallons of oil into a lake near McGrath State Beach that was discovered at Christmas . State investigators said they do not yet know how much of the 370 # 000 gallons has leaked into School Canyon Creek , a seasonally dry stream that feeds into the Ventura River . They believe that much of the gas condensate may still be contained within a small area of soil in the canyon . No dead or injured wildlife has been found , authorities said . &quot; Our guess is that ( the spill ) lay_dormant for some time , &quot; said Reed Smith , a pollution response coordinator for Fish and Game . &quot; Then , with the high rains last year , it was carried to the surface of School Canyon Creek and into the Ventura River. &quot; After Municipal Judge Bruce A . Clark issued the search_warrant Monday , nearly 30 investigators spent Tuesday and Wednesday sifting through records at Texaco U.S.A. ' s exploration and production area headquarters at 2692 N . Ventura Ave. , authorities said . Their search of a dozen buildings was scheduled to resume this morning . Deputy Dist . Atty . Gregory Brose said investigators are looking_for evidence of two possible felony violations relating to the discharge of hazardous substances into waterways . &quot; Fish and Game worked_on this for about a year and finally came_to the conclusion that there was evidence indicating a potential for a felony violation , &quot; he said . &quot; There could be individual liability on the part of individual employees , &quot; Brose said . &quot; There could be liability on the part of Texaco . Or there could be no liability. &quot; A spokeswoman for Texaco said the company reported the spill promptly to state authorities and has &quot; cooperated fully &quot; in trying to clean_up the site . &quot; We are dismayed by the D . A. ' s and Fish and Game ' s action , but are cooperating fully with the investigation , &quot; Texaco spokeswoman Faye Cox said . Cox said company officials are not convinced that Texaco was the source of the spill , but a state investigator said an analysis of the toxic substance showed that it did come from the company . Investigators believe that the spill occurred when a pipeline on the company ' s property ruptured . After analyzing the spill , state investigators and a private consulting firm concluded that about 8 # 800 barrels of gas condensate seeped into a hillside before oozing into the creek , Fish and Game Capt . Roger Reese said . Since the investigation began , he said , Texaco officials have &quot; repeatedly denied previous knowledge of any spill in School Canyon &quot; or of possessing any records related to pipelines in the area . &quot; When the department found a repaired pipeline , which we believe is the probable source of the spill , Texaco denied knowledge of any repair or records of repairs_to that pipeline , &quot; Reese said . Smith said information on the leak was not released earlier because investigations by Fish and Game are kept confidential until the district_attorney ' s office is contacted . Fish and Game officials said the spill is still being cleaned_up and crews are pumping contaminated ground_water from wells at the site .</TEXT>
