   <HEADLINE> SERBS COMPLYING ON PULLOUT , U.N. SAYS ; AIR STRIKES AVERTED ; BALKANS : SOME HEAVY ARMS REMAIN , BUT WEATHER MAY HAVE PREVENTED REMOVAL . NATO AND U.S. ALSO AGREE ENOUGH PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE TO FORESTALL MILITARY_ACTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A NATO deadline to Serbian gunners besieging the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo expired in uneasy silence early today , with some heavy_weapons still aimed at the city but enough gone_to rule_out immediate air strikes . U.N. officials authorized to call_for NATO air strikes said some Serbian guns were not surrendered or removed from a 12-mile zone around Sarajevo after the deadline of 1 a.m. today local_time ( 4 p.m. Sunday Pacific_time ) . They said that in some cases wintry weather prevented the weapons ' removal . But officials from the United Nations , NATO and the Clinton_Administration said enough progress had been made to avert air strikes for the time_being . &quot; I am satisfied we have achieved effective compliance . I have decided that it is not necessary at this stage for me to request NATO to use air_power , &quot; said Yasushi Akashi , the senior U.N. official in Bosnia-Herzegovina , in a statement released at his Zagreb , Croatia , headquarters and at NATO headquarters in Brussels . He said Jeremy Boorda , the four-star American admiral who commands NATO forces in Naples , is &quot; exactly of the same opinion as myself. &quot; President Clinton said air strikes are unnecessary &quot; at this time. &quot; But , in a statement read by Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers , he said : &quot; Despite the significant events of the day , we must remain vigilant . &quot; All parties should be aware that the ultimatum stands . The deadline has not been extended . Any heavy_weapons in the exclusion zone not under U.N. control are , and will remain , subject_to air strikes. &quot; NATO Secretary_General Manfred Woerner said early today that he had agreed in telephone_calls with Clinton to keep the threat of air strikes intact in case weapons are moved_back toward Sarajevo or the city is attacked . The acknowledged violations of NATO ' s 10-day ultimatum for all heavy weaponry to be removed or disabled prompted Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic to appeal for immediate Western intervention to punish the Serbs . &quot; They knew very well of the weather_conditions , and they did nothing for seven days , &quot; the Muslim president wrote in a message to Woerner . &quot; They are guilty for not doing this on_time . . . . I think that heavy weaponry that remains tonight after midnight should be a target for NATO air strikes. &quot; The Bosnian Serb forces that have shelled the city for nearly two years did not respond at first to NATO ' s demand to surrender or remove their heavy_weapons from the exclusion zone . But the ultimatum did halt shelling that has claimed 10 # 000 lives in the city in the past 22 months . And by late last week , Serbian weapons began withdrawing from hillsides around the city after Russia promised to add troops to the peacekeeping force there . The ultimatum was set after a shell killed 68 people in a Sarajevo market on Feb . 5 . It was the worst single massacre of the Bosnian civil_war , shocking the world and forcing the United States and Russia to take a leading role in the search for an end to the conflict . In Naples , Italy , lights burned toward dawn today at North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization headquarters . Any decision to attack remaining emplacements would come only after daylight examination of them and political consultations among NATO partners , senior officers said . &quot; We ' ve been ready , and we remain ready , &quot; said NATO spokesman James Mitchell , a U.S. Navy captain . Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , the_British commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia who would summon any strikes , said late Sunday that he was &quot; cautiously optimistic &quot; that they would not be needed . &quot; I hope we will not have to use air strikes tomorrow , &quot; Rose said . &quot; If there are breaches of the cease-fire tomorrow , I will have no hesitation of calling_down air strikes . . . . But I don ' t expect that to be the case. &quot; Defense_Secretary William J . Perry , en route back to Washington from a defense ministers ' meeting at Aviano Air_Base in northern Italy , called the decision to hold_off on air strikes &quot; really great news &quot; and &quot; an enormous relief , &quot; but he said U.N. forces would have to continue to watch the situation . &quot; This is very good news , but it ' s not over yet , &quot; he said . &quot; They are going_to continue to watch , and if we find more artillery pieces , if artillery pieces move_in the future , then we have to reconsider this. &quot; U.S. Gen . John M . Shalikashvili , chairman of the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff , who traveled_to Italy with Perry , said it could be several days before the allies know for_sure whether the Serbs have fully complied . Perry said the Serbian surrender of artillery went slowly and painfully right up until the final hours on Sunday , with U.N. forces ultimately visiting each of the Serbian weapons sites individually to take possession of guns , tanks , mortars and rockets . He said NATO reconnaissance planes will continue flying over the Sarajevo area , with a view toward confirming that the Serbs have surrendered their weapons as ordered . Reconnaissance efforts were hampered over the weekend by bad_weather , but analysts say the weather now is improving . A senior official returning to Washington with Perry told reporters that the United States had offered to send sophisticated TPQ-36 and TPQ-37 artillery-locating radar to help pinpoint Serbian weapons but had declined to send ground troops to operate them and was trying to train British or French troops to take those posts . Britain and France already have contributed seven units of French-built Cymbeline mortar-locating radar , complete with the necessary ground_crews . On Sunday , some Bosnian Serb gunmen manning artillery emplacements under the control of nearby U.N. troops brushed_off the potential risks of failing to comply with the NATO ultimatum . &quot; We ' re not afraid of the West , &quot; said Zoran Pijevic , 28 . &quot; In the event of ( NATO ) intervention , the Serbs and the Russians will see_to_it that Vienna doesn ' t exist anymore. &quot; Much of the Serb rebel resentment driving the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina stems from a sense of historic injustice at the hands of foreign powers such_as nonaligned Austria , which occupied the republic until World_War I . Pijevic ' s half brother , 24-year-old Goran , boasted that the Russian U.N. troops had come_to shore_up the Serbian side and that their presence meant NATO had given_up intentions to target rebel installations .
