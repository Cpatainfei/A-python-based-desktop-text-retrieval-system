   <TEXT> A guard shot and wounded a state_prison inmate Wednesday , saying he and another prisoner ignored orders to stop fighting , prison authorities reported . Christopher Harvey , 25 , serving a burglary sentence at the state_prison in Lancaster , was taken_to Antelope Valley Hospital Medical_Center , Los Angeles County Fire_Department officials said . A hospital spokeswoman did not release his condition . The circumstances of the shooting were sketchy late Wednesday , and it was unclear whether Harvey or the inmate he was fighting , Jeffrey Williams , 33 , was armed . A Fire_Department dispatcher said Harvey had been shot in the back ; a prison spokesman said the inmate had been wounded in the left shoulder . The shooting triggers an automatic investigation by the prison , but Bill Gengler , a spokesman for the state_Department of Corrections , said it is allowable under state guidelines for guards to shoot to wound inmates if they are unable to safely break_up a fight . &quot; It ' s really a judgment call , &quot; Gengler said . &quot; During the investigation , the action of the inmate and the action of the correctional officer will be looked_at to make_sure ( the shooting ) was appropriate for the situation. &quot; The incident started about 2:30 p.m. when Harvey and Jeffrey began fighting in the prison ' s maximum security facility , where both were housed , Gengler said . After the inmates ignored two orders from a guard to stop fighting and lie on the floor , the guard fired a single shot from a 9-millimeter carbine . Prison officials did not release the name of the guard . Harvey had served almost three years of an 11-year , 8-month sentence for burglary . Williams has served about six years of a 23-year sentence for assault with force and rape , prison officials said . The $ 207-million prison , barely a year old , has been the scene of several embarrassing escapes and brawls since it opened Feb . 1 , 1993 . Last week , four inmates were hospitalized after they resisted body and cell searches by guards . In January , an inmate briefly escaped by hiding in a garbage_truck collecting trash at the facility . George Root , a Lancaster councilman and a member of the prison citizens advisory committee , said that although he has been upset by the escapes and other incidents at the prison , he feels this latest problem was handled well . &quot; They did a good job , &quot; Root said . &quot; When prisoners get_in a fight that ' s the only way they can stop them. &quot;</TEXT>
