   <HEADLINE> HEALTH OFFICIALS INCREASE SCRUTINY OF COLA BOTTLING PLANT ; INVESTIGATION : INSPECTIONS AT PEPSI FACILITY ' S WAREHOUSE IN BUENA PARK HAVE YIELDED BIRDS , DEAD MOUSE . REPORT OF A RAT IN UNOPENED CAN FUELED CONCERN ABOUT SAFEGUARDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> County health inspectors have increased scrutiny of a Pepsi-Cola bottling plant in Buena Park since learning of a woman ' s contention that she found a dead rat in a Pepsi can and since an inspection there Thursday turned_up birds in the warehouse , a county health official said . Inspectors from the Orange County Health_Care Agency scheduled a follow-up inspection in two weeks after finding the birds , one of which was dead . In May , inspectors also found birds and one dead mouse in the same warehouse area , county health records show . The discovery Thursday &quot; has enough significance that we ' ve scheduled an early inspection , especially because we noted it in a prior report , &quot; said health agency Assistant Director James E . Huston . Health officials said , though , that most of the plant ' s violations over its 20-year history have been minor . Overall , its quality_control has been good . The plant has passed dozens of health inspections , including five in the past year by county , state and federal health inspectors , they said . &quot; I ' d consider ( their record ) fairly typical , &quot; said inspector Tom Aherns . &quot; It ' s a large facility , a large_number of employees , a building that isn ' t brand new , so you will find violations. &quot; Pepsi Public Affairs Manager Jeffrey Brown acknowledged that inspectors found a dead mouse in May and birds there in May and on Thursday , but said they were about 70 yards from the food processing area . &quot; It gives absolutely no credence to a theory that any rodent could get_into our manufacturing process and beyond safety procedures , &quot; Brown said . &quot; It is highly improbable that a rodent could compromise Pepsi ' s many safety procedures. &quot; On Friday , 22-year-old Maria Del Consuelo Lazaro filed a lawsuit against Pepsi Cola Inc. and Albertson ' s grocery_store chain . Lazaro , a schoolteacher from Jalisco , Mexico , alleges that she became sick in July after she drank from a Diet Pepsi can she had bought_at an Albertson ' s . Staff at Anaheim General Hospital cut open the can and found the remains of a rat , according to the lawsuit . The hospital sent the can and its contents to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , which confirmed that the can contained a rat . County health records also show that cans of Pepsi from the same plant were the subject of complaints about something that looked_like a bone and a &quot; cockroach-like object &quot; in March , 1989 , and October , 1992 . Inspections turned_up no serious health_code violations . In February , 1990 , inspectors went_to the plant because of a complaint that pallets from the plant ' s warehouse were &quot; infested &quot; with rats . Inspectors found neither rats nor rat droppings , but nevertheless recommended that that doors between the warehouse and the cola processing area be &quot; rodent-proof. &quot; In May of this year , inspectors told Pepsi managers to &quot; exterminate the infestation of birds and rodents in the warehouse . Observed some birds and a dead mouse at the time of this inspection. &quot; Brown said the use of the word &quot; infestation &quot; in the report was exaggerated . &quot; Infestation to them could mean the possibility of a rat in there , &quot; Brown said . &quot; It doesn ' t mean there were scores of rats. &quot; He said the company has been working for months on humane ways to eliminate the birds .</TEXT>
