   <HEADLINE> ANN CONWAY : THEY CHOOSE TO MAKE DIFFERENCE ; FOUR TELL WHY THEY VOLUNTEER TO CHAIR CHARITY AFFAIRS , EVEN THOUGH SUCCESS OR FAILURE CAN DEPEND ON THEIR VISION AND DRIVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dozens of meetings , hundreds of telephone_calls , enough faxes to fill a compact_car -- that ' s what it takes_to plan the mega-benefits that this year will sink hundreds of thousands of dollars into Orange County charity coffers . Why do social leaders do_it ? Their reasons are as varied as the menus at their black-tie galas . But one thing they share : unflinching vision . As Tiffany Vice_President Jo Qualls puts it , &quot; If you don ' t shoot_for a star , how do you get one ? &quot; A look , then , at People to Watch in 1994 , the volunteer organizers behind &quot; The Phantom of the Opera &quot; gala at the Orange County Performing Arts Center , the Symphony of Jewels for the Pacific Symphony , a weekend extravaganza on behalf of the Smithsonian Institution ' s Archives of American Arts and more : * Shari Esayian : When &quot; The Phantom of the Opera &quot; makes its debut at Segerstrom Hall on July 23 , two celebrations are planned . The first , a daylight preview party , will take_place immediately before the production , says Esayian , the Newport Beach arts activist who was invited to be gala chairwoman by the center board . The second , a higher ticket party , will be staged following the show . Esayian plans to hold the events al fresco ( think summer ) in the large space between the center and its parking ramp . &quot; We ' ve trundled off to ballrooms often enough , &quot; she explains . &quot; We want it to be fresh. &quot; One of the most exciting aspects of gala organizing is concept development . &quot; We ' re trying to decide whether to create the dark and mysterious Phantom ' s lair or a bright and colorful masquerade atmosphere with candelabra and chandeliers , &quot; Esayian says . &quot; It will be dark at the post-performance event . That will really lend itself to a dramatic backdrop. &quot; Esayian volunteers her time to blockbuster charity projects because she has &quot; so_much fun with everybody , &quot; she says . &quot; And , like any chairwoman , I want a beautiful product , but nobody lived or died because the stamp on the invitation didn ' t match the gala napkins . I go at it with a sense of humor. &quot; * Sharon Jaquith : As a Los Angeles attorney and a trustee of the Leo Freedman Foundation , which doles out $ 650 # 000 annually to local charities , Jaquith has plenty to keep her busy . But she is organizing and personally picking_up the tab on the Feb . 11 dinner that will launch &quot; Seven Decades : Modern Mexican Art from the Bernard Lewin Collection &quot; at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art in Santa Ana . ( The Leo Freedman Foundation has made a $ 1-million commitment to the Bowers ) . She will also co-chair the Pacific Symphony_Orchestra ' s May 7 &quot; Symphony of Jewels ' with Qualls at the Hyatt Regency Irvine . ( The foundation has made a $ 850 # 000 pledge to the orchestra. ) &quot; I feel an emotional commitment to these groups , &quot; says Jaquith of her willingness to roll_up her sleeves . &quot; Anybody can write a check . It ' s more_than just a money thing with me. &quot; Guests at the Bowers ' dinner honoring Bernard Lewin will include New Mexico sculptor Allan Houser , &quot; Rain of Gold &quot; author Victor Villasenor and his mother , Lupe ( the main character in his book ) , artist Vladimir Cora , museum supporters and members of the business and arts communities . Getting involved in a variety of charity projects is what life is all about , Jaquith says . &quot; For me , it ' s important to understand people of different cultures , respect their differences , and work with them so we can help each other . &quot; When I believe_in something or someone , I believe with all my heart . I ' m willing to put_in the time and effort and whatever financial resources I have available. &quot; * Jo Qualls : With her corporate connection to Tiffany &amp; Co. , Qualls has a unique opportunity to bring a New York brand of sophistication to local galas . After all , the coffee_table book , &quot; Tiffany Parties &quot; -- penned by the jeweler ' s design director , John Loring -- is society ' s unofficial guidebook to stylish soiree-giving . Her involvement with the &quot; Symphony of Jewels &quot; marks the second time Qualls has chaired a gala in two years . Last December , she co-chaired the Candlelight Concert on behalf of the center . Ordinarily , a corporation will donate funds to a gala , buy tables , or provide auction items . It is unusual for a company vice_president to take_on the responsibility of a chairmanship . &quot; I felt it was a way I could show personal support behind the support the company would give , &quot; Qualls says . &quot; It makes me feel good to think I have been part of the process , beginning to end . I enjoy helping_out with the creative decisions . I like the opportunity to help others see new ways of doing things. &quot; Qualls promises that this year ' s Symphony of Jewels will be the annual event ' s most exciting . She is about to sign_on the dotted line with the two musical stars of the Broadway stage ( &quot; I can ' t announce their names until they ' ve signed the contract , &quot; she says ) who will perform at the gala . Orchestra members will also be featured in the entertainment . Some of the elements used in the grand opening of Tiffany &amp; Co . at South Coast Plaza five years ago will be incorporated into the event . &quot; We ' re bringing back our vignette concept , &quot; she says . During the gala ' s cocktail reception , guests will be able to gaze upon 12 dressed-to-the-hilt models dripping in millions of dollars ' worth of Tiffany jewels . And , for the first time , a keepsake calendar informing them of the orchestra ' s performance schedule and related information about composers will be distributed to guests . Qualls says the gala is going_to be &quot; stretchy &quot; and &quot; reachy. &quot; &quot; We ' re going to move everything up a notch or two across the board , &quot; she says . * Electa Anderson : When she attended last year ' s Los Angeles benefit on behalf of the Smithsonian Institution ' s Archives of American Art , Anderson took 40 people from Orange County with her . The cost for the gala honoring artist David Hockney ranged from $ 500 to $ 750 per person . Afterward , it struck Anderson that Orange County was ready for the same kind of fund-raiser . &quot; We ' ve become sophisticated enough to support a benefit like that , &quot; says Anderson , an arts activist who does special event planning for Roger ' s Gardens in Corona del Mar . Orange County is_full of art enthusiasts and serious collectors . The plan : a weekend getaway this fall at the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point ( the locale is not confirmed , she says ) that will culminate in a lavish Sunday gala . On the guest list , besides locals : national members of the support agroups for the Archives of American Art , a resource bureau within the Smithsonian Institution that can provide background information on virtually any American artist . Anderson would also like to found a support group for the archives here . &quot; The archives is the one place a person can get information on an American artist without worrying about the information provider ' s agenda , &quot; she says . &quot; It is not self-serving. &quot;</TEXT>
