   <TEXT> An 80-year-old woman , many years my patient , came_to my office the other day in respiratory distress . It was quickly evident to me that she was in heart_failure . I told her that she would need an X-ray and medication . She told me she had signed_up with a health_maintenance_organization since her last visit . My secretary called the HMO . As I suspected , we were not on this particular part of the plan . I asked my patient why she had signed_up if she intended to continue to come_to me . She told me that representatives from two plans had been coming_to her house for weeks , &quot; hounding &quot; her to sign . She told them that she wanted to keep her regular doctor . She finally agreed to sign when the salesperson told her that my name was in their book . Intentional or not , that was misleading information . Yes , my name is in their book , but not for the plan to which they assigned her . By coming_to see me , she was &quot; out of network. &quot; When you get medical services outside a network like the one she had joined , the insurance_company pays nothing . This is true even if the doctor whom you chose is signed_up with the same insurance_company but is affiliated with a different network of doctors . This is very confusing to patients and is seldom adequately explained by the insurance_companies ' sales forces . The moment my patient signed , I was no longer her primary physician . She had been assigned to a total stranger -- a doctor who knows_nothing about her and has yet to see her . Why did she join this insurance group ? Although she stated that they hounded her into it , the reason most Medicare patients join managed-care plans is the promise of free medicines and no annual deductibles . Their only obligation is a small co-payment , usually $ 10 or less , for each visit and prescription . She can continue to be my patient , but it will cost her . When she signed with the HMO , she gave_up her Medicare card , and the HMO will not pay_for outside care . * I treated her heart_failure , and I ' m pleased to report that she responded well . We avoided a paramedic run to the emergency_room in the middle of the night and most likely prevented hospitalization . Does the HMO care about all_of this ? Probably not . After all , none of this costs them a cent , and the hundreds of dollars given to them monthly by the government is theirs to keep after small monthly fixed per-patient fees to doctors . Insurance_companies have taken medical decision-making away from patients and their doctors . They have accomplished this by using the concept of &quot; managed care. &quot; Managed care is supposed to save money by controlling the wasteful use of unnecessary medical services . The concept is a good one , but it sometimes backfires by giving insurance_companies the option of refusing to authorize services on the basis of cost effectiveness rather than medical necessity . It also delays the timely approval of needed services . One of my patients , who has years of experience in the insurance industry , gave me a rather distasteful explanation of why insurers can dominate the medical decision-making process . He said it ' s a result of the &quot; golden rule. &quot; They who have the gold make the rules -- in this case , the insurance industry . It not only makes the rules but also controls where the patients go . Its actions grow bolder as its power increases . A couple of years ago the Prudential insurance_company took 175 of my patients -- without notice to the patients , and only a_few days notice to me -- and reassigned them to another doctor . I called to ask why . Was I doing something wrong ? No , was the reply , in fact a poll had shown that most of my patients were very happy with me ( many later changed insurance to return to me ) . I was told only that it was &quot; a business decision. &quot; Did another doctor offer to work for less ? Was the company simplifying its paperwork ? I couldn ' t find_out . I ' ve always been opposed to buying and selling patients . Patients should be allowed to go_to whomever they wish . But that ' s not the way managed care works . You pay your premium , ( or your employer does ) for the privilege of having managed care control your medical destiny . Insurance_companies treat patients like chattel . They are interested only in how many they can service at the lowest possible cost and highest possible profit . President Clinton has stated that between 25 % and 40 % of the health_care dollar goes_to administrative costs before one cent is spent on patient care . In a recent article promoting his single-payer national health plan , Rep . Jim McDermott ( D-Wash. ) said Medicare has an administrative overhead of only 2.5 % . * A few years ago , the government decided to try to save money by encouraging patients to join HMOs and other managed care systems . A study showed that Medicare lost money by doing this . The time has come_to get_rid_of the insurance_companies , their enormous executive salaries , obscene profits , constant interference with the patient / doctor relationship , huge marketing budgets and &quot; fine print &quot; manipulation of medical_care . The billions of premium dollars saved would be_better spent on patient care and universal medical coverage .</TEXT>
