   <HEADLINE> FINNISH PARLIAMENT OKS MEMBERSHIP IN EUROPEAN UNION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Finnish lawmakers endorsed membership in the European Union on Friday , paving the way for the country to join the political and trade bloc next year . Despite a filibuster that delayed the vote by several weeks , the EU bill passed , 152-45 . &quot; I ' m relieved , &quot; Prime_Minister Esko Aho said . &quot; The long , arduous task , at least on Finland ' s part , is now over. &quot; Anti-EU lawmakers , mainly from Aho ' s Center party , delayed the vote until after Sweden ' s referendum last Sunday , hoping a Swedish &quot; no &quot; would help block ratification in Finland . But Swedish voters passed the referendum with 52 % in favor . Last month , 57 % of 4 million Finnish voters approved EU membership in a referendum . Norwegians will vote Nov . 28 on whether they want to join . With the Nordic nations and Austria , which has already approved joining , the union would grow to 16 members encompassing 375 million people .</TEXT>
