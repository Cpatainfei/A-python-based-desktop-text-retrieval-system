   <HEADLINE> JAPAN REFORMS WIN PRELIMINARY APPROVAL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> By an 18-16 vote , an upper house committee in Japan ' s Parliament today passed four political reform bills on which Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa has staked his political future . One member of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party defied his party and voted for the bills . Final passage on the upper house floor was endangered by a rebellion within Hosokawa ' s coalition . Last August , Hosokawa promised to assume &quot; political responsibility &quot; should he fail to enact the reforms that would give Japan a completely new election system and ban corporate contributions to individual politicians .</TEXT>
