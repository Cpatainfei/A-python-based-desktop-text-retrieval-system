   <HEADLINE> ART ; OLD HOLLYWOOD ' S NEW ARTISTIC JOLT ; LACE AND RE : SOLUTION HAVE MOVED FROM THE CENTRAL_CITY INTO HOLLYWOOD . THE GOAL FOR BOTH ARTS INSTITUTIONS IS A NEW ENERGY . BROADER AUDIENCES WOULD BE NICE TOO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Forget Frederick ' s of Hollywood ' s racy underwear , his ' n ' hers spike_heels in every color of the psychedelic rainbow , leather jackets splashed with images of Marilyn and Elvis . When you consider the attractions of Hollywood Boulevard , think contemporary art . Sequined string bikinis and other bizarre enticements still twinkle in shop windows along the legendary thoroughfare , just as transvestites and tourists continue to parade on sidewalks embedded with stars named for celebrities . But the opening of two nonprofit art institutions -- with public receptions Thursday from 7 to 10 p.m. -- has given one block of Hollywood Boulevard an infusion of painting , sculpture , photography , video , performance and computer art . Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions , a 15-year-old multidisciplinary forum for cutting-edge art , has moved_into the former Newberry School of Beauty , at 6522 Hollywood Blvd. , two blocks west of Cahuenga Boulevard . Two doors east , at 6518 Hollywood Blvd. , is RE : SOLUTION , a reincarnation of the 20-year-old Los Angeles Center for Photographic Studies , which supports photographic arts , video and digital imagery . Both organizations have forsaken the mean streets of central Los Angeles for Hollywood . LACE initially resided above the Victor Clothing Co . on Broadway , then moved to Industrial Street , in a warehouse district that has become increasingly crime-infested . In its former life , RE : SOLUTION operated a gallery at Spring and 8th streets until the neighborhood became too dangerous , then relocated at 6th Street and Beaudry Avenue . Tawdry as their new neighborhood may appear , the two institutions consider it a step_up , and their leaders speak longingly of joining Hollywood ' s arts community and building a broader audience in an area that has such assets as pedestrian_traffic and convenient parking . &quot; My favorite fantasy is that everyone will see every show , every video , every performance we offer , &quot; said Gwen Darien , LACE ' s executive_director . &quot; We have the possibility of a public space with an incredibly diverse audience , and we want it to be a center of vitality that reflects what goes_on in the contemporary art world -- not just in Los Angeles , but throughout the world. &quot; RE : SOLUTION ' s expanded gallery space will provide an opportunity to display a much wider range of art , and heightened visibility will ensure that more people see it , said Joe Smoke , director of the photography center . An important factor_in his organization ' s new image is a merger with EZ Arts , the nonprofit video and digital branch of EZTV . This partnership will allow RE : SOLUTION to become &quot; a true gallery of the 21st Century , featuring video screening in the evenings and looking ahead to new technology , &quot; he said . * These aspirations have been hard won , however , and the future of Hollywood ' s new art block is uncertain . After a two-year process that was complicated by a change of city administration , following the election of Mayor Richard Riordan , LACE and RE : SOLUTION have secured five-year leases with renewal options through the Community Redevelopment Agency , in a block owned by the city ' s Department_of_Transportation . Long-range plans call_for building a larger complex and parking structure on the site -- perhaps a sort of farmers ' market -- but no plan has been adopted and financing is not available . Arts institutions could be incorporated in the new development , but they would not be its focus , said Lester Burg , assistant project manager for the CRA ' s Hollywood Redevelopment Project , a $ 1-billion plan bordered by La Brea , Fountain , Western and Franklin avenues . In the meantime , the CRA expects the new arrivals to enhance a redevelopment district that already claims about 30 live theaters and has several other arts projects in the works . Just west of the art block on Hollywood Boulevard , American Cinematheque , a nonprofit center for the appreciation of film and video , is remodeling the historic Egyptian Theatre . To the east , the Pacific Theater building is being transformed into the Hollywood Entertainment Museum . Hollywood Moguls , a cafe-theater-gallery , is already entrenched on the art block . And TRI , an adventurous gallery operated by artist Rory Devine , is moving to 6365 Yucca St . and opening on Thursday . &quot; I love this neighborhood , &quot; Darien said , leading a visitor on a tour of LACE ' s new surroundings . &quot; It ' s urban and gritty . It has some of the qualities that were a positive attraction for the downtown space , but it ' s safer and we have accessible , attended , cheap parking. &quot; Peter Kirby , chairman of LACE ' s board , believes that the move was essential . &quot; To stay_put -- in the particular part of downtown Los Angeles where LACE was located -- would be to die . We are running_away from that , but Hollywood Boulevard is not exactly the suburbs , &quot; he said . * No one would confuse the 6500 block of Hollywood Boulevard with a commercial district in Palos Verdes Estates or Westlake Village . But for all its rough edges and kinky sideshows , the change of address reflects a serious attempt to get a grip on LACE ' s future . Buffeted by a shifting art scene , squeezed_by a sour economy and embattled by city politics , LACE finally has a chance to re-establish itself as a vigorous community arts center , slimmed down and toned_up for the ' 90s . LACE was founded in 1978 by a group of 13 artists , most of whom had joined forces in East Los Angeles in a program funded by the federal Comprehensive Employment Training Act . The organization developed_into a lively -- if contentious -- exhibition and performance center under the direction of artist Marc Pally , from 1979 to 1983 , and Joy Silverman , from 1983 to 1990 . But Silverman ' s resignation and Roberto Bedoya ' s subsequent seven-month term of leadership coincided with a downturn in the economy and the central_city . When Darien became director in 1991 -- after 8 1 / 2 years as deputy director of New York ' s PS1 , a well-known contemporary art center -- she took_over an organization that was troubled by financial woes , falling attendance and dissension over the representation of minority artists . Known as an energetic and adroit consensus builder , she has presided over a tumultuous period when LACE seemed to fade from the scene as its move was delayed . The final exhibition , featuring Jean Lowe ' s work , closed last June . In recent months , LACE ' s video program has been presented at the Ruth Bloom Gallery in Santa Monica , while Hollywood Moguls has served as a forum for LACE performances . A mission statement defines LACE as &quot; a nonprofit interdisciplinary contemporary arts organization that presents art and ideas and serves as a forum for an evolving dialogue between both emerging and established artists and their audiences. &quot; &quot; Our challenge in Hollywood is to develop and make clear to the public the multidisciplinary nature of the institution , &quot; Darien said . &quot; The move allows us to fulfill our mission more completely and in a more public way , and to reach_out beyond people who went downtown because they were interested . We want to attract new people as well as sustain our consistent audience. &quot; A recently completed five-year strategic plan calls_for promoting the multidisciplinary aspect of the institution , strengthening the program ' s critical context by publishing a brochure or catalogue on each exhibition and developing educational_programs and public outreach , she said . This is all part of adapting LACE , a so-called alternative space , to the present realities of the art scene . Organizations such_as LACE were hatched in the 1970s as artist-run alternatives to museums and commercial galleries , giving artists a place to show experimental work without strictures of tradition or the market . But the concept became confused during the boom of the 1980s , when artists fresh out of school were snapped_up by galleries . Then the art market crashed , wiping_out a large_number of galleries and sharply curtailing collecting . During the past few years , artists and youthful entrepreneurs have taken matters into their own hands by opening shoestring commercial operations that show works similar to what might be seen at LACE . &quot; The field is wide open now , &quot; Kirby said . &quot; The whole art world is trying to find_out how to operate after the bubble burst . &quot; LACE has a history and the momentum of that history , but it ' s still on the fringe . We just want to show good work , as we have always done . LACE is not the only place where this work can be shown now , but there are never enough spaces. &quot; LACE ' s emphasis on video and performance is particularly critical because forums for them have always been in short supply in Southern California , Kirby said . Paul McCarthy , a prominent sculptor and performance artist who got a leg up at LACE , agrees . &quot; If work doesn ' t get shown , inevitably it doesn ' t get made , &quot; he said , adding that Los Angeles has a dearth of showcases for experimental art . Darien calls LACE a contemporary arts center rather than an alternative space . &quot; Alternative has a specific meaning -- reacting against something , and reacting is a limiting concept , &quot; she said . &quot; One of the things we do is to provide alternatives to museums , which collect art , and to galleries , which sell art . We provide a forum for experimentation , but experimentation doesn ' t mean simply reacting . It ' s building something as well. &quot; * LACE ' s program will be lodged_in a building that has undergone little exterior change . The stucco and blue tile facade will remain the same , with the exception of a splashy LACE sign replacing the old Newberry School of Beauty label . Inside , the front_room is a 640-square-foot gallery , named for LACE patrons Fred and Janet Kessler . The space will be used for exhibitions until funds are available to turn it into a cafe-bookstore with window displays of art . &quot; We want LACE to be an open , accessible place where people meet , &quot; said architect Frederick Fisher , who designed the renovation , including plans for the cafe-bookstore . The main exhibition space -- called the Peter Norton Family Gallery , in honor of the Los Angeles-based computer_guru and arts philanthropist -- is a 1 # 500-square-foot hall with a coved ceiling . To the rear of the building are a 1 # 400-square-foot performance space and a 300-square-foot video room for single-channel programs and installations . The major challenges in overhauling the building were to accommodate LACE ' s programs in a space that is a bit smaller than its former home and to work within an extremely low budget , Fisher said . The CRA provided $ 75 # 000 for the renovation . ( General funding for LACE comes from the Arts Organization Stabilization Initiative , the California Arts Council , the Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department , the Rockefeller Foundation , the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts and other sources. ) LACE will launch its new building with &quot; Nor Here Neither There , &quot; an exhibition of paintings by Suzanne Garrison and Spandau Parks , sculpture by Willie Cole , Chris Finley and Nari Ward , photographs by Sharon Lockhart and Lorraine O ' Grady , video by Doug Aitken , Tom Burr and Stan Douglas , film by Valie Export , a spoken-word performance by Cynthia Stewart and a musical_performance by Mythter . Representing many points_of_view , the artists hail from various California cities , as well as New York , Vancouver and Vienna . While not construed as a model for future LACE exhibitions , the show ' s curatorial process and its varied contents offer insight into the organization ' s philosophy . Darien appointed not one but four curators -- artists McCarthy , Charles Gaines and Stephen Prina , and Fran Seegull , curator of the Norton collection and foundation . Working without guidelines , the curators proceeded to assemble an exhibition that has no theme . &quot; All four of us were interested in exploring alternative methods of curating , &quot; Seegull said . &quot; We didn ' t want a theme ; we were looking_for a more organic model. &quot; As a result , they each picked artists whose work interested them and brought their ideas to a series of meetings . &quot; There was some overlap , but no political jockeying , &quot; she said . &quot; We continued to meet until the show almost curated itself. &quot; The title , &quot; Nor Here Neither There , &quot; refers to LACE ' s geographical limbo of the past year and to a broader perceptual disjuncture between the present and the future , she said . * RE : SOLUTION was founded in 1974 , as the Los Angeles Center for Photographic Studies , by seven photographers who wanted to expand the boundaries of the medium . The center , originally located in a small Westside tract house , in 1981 opened its first permanent showcase , at 814 N . Spring St . The center developed an active program of exhibitions , lectures and workshops , but the neighborhood ' s decline led the organization to move_in 1987 . After three years in a temporary space , it opened a small storefront gallery at 1048 W . 6th St. , staging exhibitions there and at other local arts institutions . The organization , renamed RE : SOLUTION , received $ 40 # 000 from the CRA to renovate its new 3 # 500-square-foot home , in a storefront formerly occupied by New World Jewelry . Architect Josh Schweitzer designed the space to include a 1 # 200-square-foot central gallery , a smaller installation space in the back and a front window gallery and niche to sell the organization ' s publication , FRAME-WORK : The Journal of Images and Culture . The inaugural event in the main gallery is the annual members ' show , curated by Denise Miller-Clark , director of Chicago ' s Museum of Contemporary Photography . &quot; El Palacio del Amor , &quot; an installation by Bob de Bris , will christen the back gallery , while Marlo Marrero ' s project &quot; Don ' t I Know You ? &quot; will be in the window gallery . Street-level window displays , such_as Marrero ' s , are expected to entice a new audience into both LACE and RE : SOLUTION -- and to present the institutions with new challenges . &quot; When you go_to museums , it ' s a ritualized experience , &quot; LACE ' s Kirby said . &quot; On Hollywood Boulevard , you expect something completely different . This will be more like shopping. &quot; People who wander into the exhibitions won ' t like everything they see , he said . &quot; But when you go shopping , you aren ' t disappointed if you don ' t like 90 % of what you see . And if you don ' t like everything , you don ' t stop going. &quot; * &quot; Nor Here Neither There , &quot; Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions , 6522 Hollywood Blvd .
