   <HEADLINE> AFRICA ; NEIGHBORS WATCHING PRETORIA WITH HIGH HOPES , HESITATION ; THEY HAVE THE MOST TO GAIN -- AND LOSE -- FROM AN ECONOMY THAT COULD SWAMP THEIRS . THE THREAT OF A BRAIN_DRAIN LOOMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the three weeks since President Nelson Mandela ' s inauguration , a host of international_organizations has rushed to embrace South_Africa . The country ' s new flag flies in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , at the headquarters of the Organization of African Unity , once one of apartheid ' s bitterest enemies . On Wednesday , South_Africa rejoined the_British Commonwealth , more_than three decades after it stormed out because of Commonwealth objections to its racist political_system . And full re-integration into the United Nations is expected this year . But as South_Africa re-emerges onto the world stage , its immediate neighbors have the most to gain -- and to lose . They look_on with a mixture of expectation and alarm after decades of mutual hostility . The anti-apartheid bloc known as the Frontline States Organization formally welcomes its neighbor at a meeting in Zimbabwe today , which Mandela is attending . The group does so in the hope that South_Africa ' s renewal will also be its own , but member countries fear being swamped by its much stronger economy . Already , the gravitational pull southward is draining some African_nations of their best brains and threatening to divert international investment and aid . In Pretoria , the Foreign Ministry ' s deputy director-general for Africa , Derek Auret , says one of Mandela ' s priorities in meeting with Frontline leaders will be to assess ways of establishing political and economic stability in southern Africa . Auret says South_Africa ' s peaceful transfer of power to Mandela ' s African National Congress might encourage a settlement of the continuing civil_war in Angola and provide a reassuring example to Mozambique before it holds multi-party elections in October . But the key to stability , he argues , will be ensuring that South_Africa ' s expected economic_growth spills_over to neighboring countries . &quot; Perhaps the best chance is in coming_together around common economic objectives and achieving collective economic_growth , which will lead to all_the benefits that this government would like to see accrue to South_Africans ( and to ) all southern Africans , &quot; Auret said . &quot; South_Africa cannot be an island of prosperity in a sea of poverty. &quot; But Pretoria is keen to discourage exaggerated expectations . &quot; South_Africa ' s potential is a long-term issue , &quot; Auret said , &quot; and won ' t have any immediate spinoffs for the rest of the continent. &quot; Some of South_Africa ' s new leaders do feel a deep emotional debt to nations such_as Zambia , Zimbabwe and Tanzania because they helped hold_the_line against apartheid over the years . They also recognize that assisting their neighbors eventually will conflict with their own government ' s interests and priorities . Mandela needs rapid economic expansion if he is to provide jobs and housing to his constituents , yet South_Africa ' s economy is already three times larger than the economies of the seven Frontline states combined . It exports five times as much to the continent as it imports . Economists point_out that further expansion will likely widen the financial gap between South_Africa and its neighbors . Among the few African exports into South_Africa today are professionals -- doctors from Ghana and Zaire , managers from Nigeria , teachers from Zimbabwe . While South_Africa welcomes them , the other nations despair at the loss . And domestic pressure is building_on Mandela to stem the flow of unskilled migrant labor from Zimbabwe , Mozambique , Malawi and Lesotho -- a vital source of revenue for those nations . There are estimated to be at least 2 million illegal immigrants in South_Africa holding jobs the ANC urgently needs to provide to its own citizens . Other African_nations also fear Pretoria will garner a sizable chunk of what little foreign investment and Western aid the continent gets .</TEXT>
