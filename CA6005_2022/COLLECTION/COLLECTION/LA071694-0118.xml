   <HEADLINE> THE EMERGING WIRELESS INDUSTRY ; PACBELL WANTS BACK INTO GAME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Four months after spinning off its cellular_phone unit , Pacific Telesis Group said Friday that it will return to the mobile communications arena and compete with its former subsidiary , now known as AirTouch Communications . Pacific Telesis , through its newly formed Pacific Bell Mobile Services unit , said it will bid aggressively for licenses enabling it to offer so-called personal communications services , a new type of wireless technology that could pose a major challenge to existing cellular networks . The Federal Communications Commission_plans to auction the licenses for so-called wide-band PCS this winter . In addition , Pacific Bell Mobile Services intends to act_as a reseller of conventional cellular services . That would enable the company to get_into the wireless communications business much more quickly , because PCS services are not expected to be fully operational until 1997 . The California Public_Utilities Commission expected Pacific Telesis ' action and said it was pleased to see further competition in the fast-growing wireless market . &quot; The commissioners are unhappy with the duopoly structure , &quot; Douglas Dade , supervisor of the PUC ' s Telecommunications Branch , said in reference_to rules that now allow just two cellular carriers in each market . &quot; They are looking_for PCS to provide additional competition. &quot; Lyn Daniels , president of Pacific Bell Mobile , said in an interview that his unit plans to &quot; spend hundreds of millions of dollars &quot; over the next three years to create a PCS network . And he indicated that he will bring a hefty checkbook to the PCS auctions , which are expected to raise as much as $ 10 billion for the federal_government . Lyn said the company will bid on the big Southwestern PCS license covering Southern California and Las Vegas , the license covering the Bay area and a_few other licenses covering smaller areas of the state . &quot; This is important to our overall position in California , &quot; Daniels said . &quot; We have the highest value to bring_to the market , so we are in a position to pay the highest prices. &quot; Established cellular carriers are barred from bidding for PCS licenses in major markets , so Pacific Telesis would not be able to go_ahead had it not spun_off AirTouch . The wireless market in California is growing at a rate of 45 % a year , and analysts say there is room for dozens of new wireless services . With a denser urban antenna network to relay signals , PCS will feature transceivers smaller and cheaper than cellular_phones . Proponents say PCS technology will eventually enable users to make and receive calls anywhere , including inside office_buildings . But Pacific Bell Mobile faces an uphill battle in becoming a serious player in the market . Its lawyers are still fighting government regulators for the right to bid on a key Southern California PCS license , which had initially been granted to one of the PCS technology &quot; pioneers. &quot; Some skeptics doubt PCS will ever compete head to head with full-fledged cellular_phone companies . &quot; I don ' t see anyone becoming a major wireless provider in competition with cellular using PCS licenses , &quot; said Herschel Shostek , whose research company focuses_on cellular services . Shiver reported from Washington and Helm from San Francisco .</TEXT>
