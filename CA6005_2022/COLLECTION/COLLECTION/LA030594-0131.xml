   <HEADLINE> JAPAN ' S TRADE SURPLUS WITH U.S. SURGES BY AN UNEXPECTED 30.9 %</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Hopes for easing U.S.-Japan tensions suffered another blow Friday with the release of statistics showing an unexpected surge in Japan ' s trade surplus with the United States . The report of a 30.9 % surge in the current-account surplus for January came as Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa insisted that Japan can reduce its massive trade surpluses over the next several years . In a policy speech to Parliament on Friday , Hosokawa repeated a promise made by his predecessor to President Clinton last July , declaring that &quot; we must . . . take effective measures to achieve a highly significant decrease in our current-accounts surplus over the medium term. &quot; The current_account -- which measures total trade plus such non-trade transactions as insurance , shipping and tourism -- jumped to $ 6.83 billion in January , compared to $ 5.22 billion in the year-ago period , the Finance Ministry said . The surplus started falling last year , leading some observers to believe a turnaround had begun . That optimistic scenario now seems to have collapsed . During his wide-ranging address to Parliament , Hosokawa made no specific reference_to the Clinton_Administration ' s action on Thursday reinstituting the Super 301 provision of U.S. trade law , which allows Washington to retaliate against Japanese imports if Japan fails to open its market to U.S. goods . But many of his remarks were clearly aimed at addressing concerns of the United States , which ran a $ 59.3-billion trade_deficit with Japan last year . &quot; Along with managing the economy so that domestic demand leads growth , we need to ensure that the Japanese market is open_to the rest of the world in accordance with international trade rules , &quot; Hosokawa said . Hosokawa also pledged to carry_out economic and administrative reform -- strongly urged by the United States -- by &quot; demolishing systems and practices no longer compatible with the needs of the times. &quot; He vowed to make &quot; non-regulation the norm and regulation the exception . . . to expand business opportunities and consumer choice. &quot; He singled_out &quot; information telecommunications &quot; as one area in which government regulation should be removed to promote business opportunities . &quot; Economic structures that used to work rationally are no longer effective , &quot; he said . The apparent willingness of Hosokawa ' s government to carry_out at least some domestic reforms favored by Washington has helped prevent concerns about a possible trade war from having too severe an impact on Tokyo stock and currency markets . The yen generally has been strengthening as currency traders bet that Washington will favor a stronger yen , which makes Japanese exports more expensive in dollar terms and thus harder to sell . A strong yen in turn threatens prospects for economic recovery in Japan and thus has a depressing effect on stock prices . But the dollar rebounded Friday , boosted by buying by the Bank_of_Japan , to close at 104.80 yen , up 0.88 , or 0.8 % over Thursday ' s close . Encouraged by the weaker yen , stock investors sent the benchmark Nikkei average of 225 stocks up 360.14 points , or 1.8 % , to close at 19 # 966.00. Washington has also been pressing Tokyo for more expansionary fiscal_policy to promote economic recovery and greater consumer spending , which could draw_in more imports and help reduce the trade imbalance .</TEXT>
