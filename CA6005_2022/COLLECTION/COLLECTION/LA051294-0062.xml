   <HEADLINE> POTATO_SALAD : HOLD THE MAYO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Supermarkets sell potato_salad by the bucket , but these salads often have too_much fat , sugar and salt . When we make potato_salad in our own kitchen , we can control the taste and nutritional content . The potato_salad most familiar to us is heavily coated with mayonnaise . Yet there is another kind of potato_salad , popular in Mediterranean countries , that many people will be glad to discover . These potato_salads are dressed with vinaigrette . In spite of being much lighter , they are just as delicious as our creamy ones . A case_in_point is the colorful Lebanese potato_salad with tomatoes , mint and green_onions , or the_French potato_salad with watercress with a touch of white_wine . Vinaigrette is lighter-textured and lower in fat and cholesterol than mayonnaise . Besides , it ' s more fluid ; therefore , a smaller amount of it is needed to moisten the potatoes . By choosing buttery-tasting Yukon Gold or other flavorful , good-quality potatoes , you can be frugal with the amount of dressing you add so that the salad is light . Basic potato_salad is usually accented with onion . You can use yellow onions , but red , sweet or green_onions make a finer salad . Parsley adds a fresh accent , and other herbs such_as chives , mint , cilantro , tarragon and basil produce delectable variations . Colorful cooked vegetables such_as beets , carrots or peas are a welcome addition ; add all three and you have traditional Russian potato_salad . Zesty condiments such_as pickled cucumbers , capers , black_olives or chopped anchovies ensure that the salad won ' t be bland . A French trick for adding flavor to potato_salads is to marinate the potatoes briefly while they are still warm . Mix a little white_wine and oil for the marinade or simply sprinkle the potatoes with part of the vinaigrette dressing . For easy preparation and good flavor , cook the potatoes in their skins and peel them after cooking . To speed_up the cooking , cut large potatoes in half . Be sure the potatoes are cooked just right by checking them with a knife . Undercooked potatoes do not taste good ; but if the potatoes are overcooked , they fall_apart when cut and tossed with the dressing . You can make the vinaigrette dressing according to the classic proportions of three tablespoons oil for every tablespoon of vinegar or lemon_juice . For a lower-fat result , use only two tablespoons of oil and , if the dressing tastes too sharp , add a teaspoon or two of water . Vary the flavors by using walnut_oil or extra-virgin olive_oil and tarragon vinegar or other herb vinegars . Many of us tend to serve potato_salad cold . However , very cold dressing usually congeals and makes the salad appear dry . If you taste the salad straight from the refrigerator , you might think it needs moistening and you ' ll be tempted to add more dressing . The salad tastes best if you let it stand at room_temperature for about 15 minutes before serving . Potato_salad is perfect for home cooking . It ' s easy to make and inexpensive . Most important , your own potato_salad can be more tasty and healthful than anything you find at the store . * Fresh mint and green_onions give this refreshing salad a lively flavor , and it needs only a small amount of zesty lemon_juice and olive_oil dressing . LEBANESE POTATO_SALAD WITH TOMATOES AND MINT 2 pounds Yukon Gold or red-skinned potatoes , scrubbed but not peeled Salt 2 tablespoons strained fresh lemon_juice 1 tablespoon water Freshly ground pepper Cayenne_pepper 2 to 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive_oil 1 / 3 cup chopped green_onions 1 / 4 cup chopped fresh mint 1 / 4 cup parsley 3 to 4 plum_tomatoes , cut_into small dice Place potatoes in large saucepan . Cover with water by about 1 / 2 inch and add salt . Bring to boil . Cover and simmer over low heat until knife pierces center of largest potato easily and potato falls from knife when lifted , about 25 minutes . Meanwhile , whisk lemon_juice with water and salt , black_pepper and cayenne to taste in large bowl . Add 2 tablespoons olive_oil and whisk again . Drain potatoes . Rinse briefly and leave just until cool enough to handle . Peel potatoes and cut_into 1-inch dice . Add_to bowl . Fold gently but thoroughly with dressing . Let cool . Fold in green_onions , mint and parsley . Adjust seasonings to taste . Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil , if desired . Gently fold in tomatoes . Serve at room_temperature . Makes 4 servings . * A generous amount of fresh watercress lends a tasty accent to this salad . Buy very fresh watercress and use within a day or two , so the color remains bright - green . For a variation popular in France ' s Perigord region , make the vinaigrette with walnut_oil and substitute two tablespoons chopped fresh tarragon for the watercress .</TEXT>
