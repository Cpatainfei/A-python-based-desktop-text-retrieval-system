   <HEADLINE> CLINTON URGES ARAFAT TO RENEW PEACE TALKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton appealed personally to Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat and angry Palestinians on Wednesday to resume peace talks with Israel , warning that a breakdown in negotiations would &quot; hand a victory &quot; to the Jewish extremist who massacred 48 worshipers in a West_Bank mosque . &quot; If the peace talks don ' t get_back on track , then we are rewarding the damage and the death wreaked by the extremists , &quot; Clinton told reporters at the White_House . &quot; We don ' t want to do that . We want to keep going. &quot; In Jerusalem , Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin made an impassioned appeal of_his_own to Palestinian leaders to resume the negotiations . &quot; I believe at this stage , the leadership of both sides , Palestinians and us , have to stand_up to overcome pain , sorrow and agony and to understand that the real solution is in the political field , &quot; he said . Using similar arguments , Clinton and Rabin called_for logic to prevail over emotion . Both insisted that the only chance the Palestinians have to improve their living conditions in the Israeli-occupied territories is to resume negotiations over limited self-rule in the Gaza Strip and the West_Bank town of Jericho . But they both ruled_out measures that Arafat has demanded as a condition for resuming the talks . He has said that all Jewish settlers in the West_Bank and Gaza Strip should be disarmed and that the settlements should be moved away from Arab population centers . Clinton acknowledged that the mood among Palestinians after the Hebron massacre is so angry that logic apparently has little appeal . Many Palestinians in the occupied territories and in refugee camps in Jordan and Lebanon are condemning Arafat for trying to make_peace with Israel at all , arguing that the peace process somehow made_it easier for an American-born Israeli settler to shoot_up the Ibrahim Mosque . &quot; I know ( Arafat ' s ) under a lot of pressure at_home , and I understand that , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; The only thing that I would say to the Palestinians who are pressuring Arafat not to resume talks is that that is the surest way to hand a victory to the madman who killed all_the Palestinians in the mosque. &quot; Taking_up the same theme , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher said the Palestinians must get beyond their demand for revenge and realize that only peace will give them &quot; a different future. &quot; &quot; The problem is that any hiatus ( in the talks ) . . . is to the benefit of the extremists , &quot; Christopher said . &quot; They are able to exploit delay , pointing_out to the people on the ground that the present circumstances are not causing any progress and thus urging people there to turn_to more extreme measures. &quot; He said he plans to meet Friday with Nabil Shaath , a top adviser to Arafat , on ways to restart the talks . But PLO sources said that Shaath ' s only objective is to persuade Washington to apply more pressure on Israel , a step the Administration has already ruled_out . Talking to foreign correspondents in Jerusalem , Rabin said that Israeli and PLO negotiators were tantalizingly close to agreement on the details for Palestinian self-government before the Hebron massacre intervened . &quot; Prior to the atrocity in Hebron , we were closer than ever to an agreement on security measures , to maps on how Gaza and Jericho should be delineated and how to transfer power from Israel ' s military government to the ( Palestinian ) civil_authority , &quot; Rabin said . Despite Rabin ' s rejection of Palestinian demands to dismantle settlements and disarm settlers , Israeli police imposed restrictions on 18 Jewish activists in the ultranationalist Kach and Kahane Hai movements . The militants were ordered to turn_in their army-issued weapons and were placed under travel restrictions . Israel has also made other conciliatory gestures , including the release this week of 570 Palestinian prisoners . Another 400 are to be freed today and Friday . Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said Israel &quot; is not blind &quot; to Arafat ' s need for concrete concessions before he can return to the negotiating table . A top Palestinian negotiator , Saeb Erekat , arrived in Jerusalem from PLO headquarters in Tunis , Tunisia , with a letter from Arafat to Rabin , outlining PLO proposals for resuming the talks . &quot; The Palestinians want to see certain changes on the ground , &quot; Erekat said , &quot; and Israel ' s response to our position will be a test of its sincerity. &quot; Meanwhile , often-violent protests over the massacre continued across the occupied territories . * Two Palestinians were killed , and hospitals reported nearly 100 wounded in the fighting . * A 17-year-old was shot dead in Hebron , according to military sources , when hundreds of youths poured into the streets , throwing stones and firebombs during a three-hour lifting of the curfew that has kept the town ' s population of 65 # 000 largely confined to its houses for four days . * In Jericho , a rally turned violent with hundreds of demonstrators stoning police and soldiers , who opened_fire , killing a 20-year-old Palestinian . Rabin said he intends to maintain the widespread curfews in the West_Bank and Gaza Strip and to bar most residents of both regions from Israel until the violence subsides , although this means that more_than 50 # 000 Palestinians are unable to get_to their jobs in Israel .
