   <HEADLINE> BAD HABITS ; MARIJUANA IS BACK AS THE DRUG OF CHOICE FOR SOME KIDS , WHO THINK IT ' S SAFE . BUT EXPERTS WARN IT ' S MORE POTENT THAN EVER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Every Monday morning at Santa Monica High_School , 15-year-old Becky chats_up her friends about the weekend . Repeatedly , the conversation turns_to the same topic : smoking-out at a razeparty , getting lifted on blunts and chronic . Translation : getting high on marijuana at a friend ' s house . &quot; Marijuana is the drug to do . It ' s cheap . It ' s easy to get . It ' s everywhere , &quot; says the freshman , whose name has been changed along with those of other teen-agers in this story . &quot; People smoke-out in the restrooms , during lunch . They ditch to smoke. &quot; Across Los Angeles , some students are taking a fast , drug-laden trip fueled by an attitude that it ' s cool to smoke marijuana , not viewing the drug as addictive , harmful or a great risk , even though researchers warn that it is 20 times more potent today than in the 1960s and ' 70s . This attitude is in_line with the findings of a University of Michigan study announced earlier this month that illicit drug use -- with marijuana heading the list -- among American teen-agers has increased in the last two years , reversing a trend of generally declining use that began in the late ' 70s and early ' 80s . Teen-agers who use pot say they are merely experimenting or smoking to fit_in or to cope_with the stress of problems at_home and school . Most say they smoke marijuana -- which currently also goes_by names like &quot; bud , &quot; &quot; endo , &quot; &quot; lovelies , &quot; &quot; primos &quot; and &quot; frios &quot; -- when they ' re bored at school and simply because it ' s fun to do at parties . At HPs ( home parties ) and DPs ( ditching parties ) , teen-agers mix marijuana -- ranging_in price from $ 5 for a joint to $ 40 and more for a half-filled sandwich bag of the stuff -- with crushed rock cocaine for a stronger high . They dip joints in solvents and insecticides and lace them with PCP , a powerful psychedelic_drug that can cause mental or emotional_disorders or death . Also popular are $ 5 LSD tabs -- paper the size of a contact_lens that has been blotted with a drop of the hallucinogen , which students suck on or place under an eyelid for a faster rush . Felipe , a 10th-grader at a Los Angeles high_school , says he has smoked marijuana daily for the past two years . &quot; I am probably addicted to marijuana . I got plants at my home . I ' ve gone_to school crazy high . I get high ' cause my friends do_it . It ' s fun , I guess. &quot; The survey of 50 # 000 junior and high_school students , conducted for the 19th consecutive year for the National Institute on Drug_Abuse , found that marijuana and LSD , along with inhalants and stimulants , were being used by more teen-agers . The study , widely regarded_as one of the government ' s chief benchmarks for measuring progress in the drug war , found that cocaine use held steady at low levels , alcohol use generally declined , but cigarette use was_on the rise . According to the survey , the percentage of high_school seniors who reported using an illicit drug at least once in their lives increased from 40.7 % in 1992 to 42.9 % in 1993 , but still remained below the peak of 65.6 % reported in a comparable study in 1981 . The survey also found that the proportion of eighth-graders using marijuana increased three percentage_points in the last two years , to 9.2 % . Among 10th-graders , the share using marijuana went from 15.2 % in 1992 to 19.2 % in 1993 . The percentage of 12th-graders smoking the drug increased from 21.9 % to 26 % between 1992 and 1993 , researchers reported . Researchers , parents , educators , law_enforcement officials and drug treatment experts agree that the findings are troublesome . Most officials attribute the results to a growing complacency about the problems of drug_abuse , peer pressure , a lack of attention to the issue by both government and the media , and too_much freedom allowed by parents , especially those who came_of_age during an era when drug use was widely glamorized . Ruth Rich , director of substance_abuse programs for the Los Angeles Unified School District , confirmed that more students are seeking and being referred to support groups for the use of marijuana and LSD . &quot; The reason is they ' re getting a lot of propaganda that using drugs is OK , &quot; she says , citing U.S. Surgeon_General Joycelyn Elders and other public officials who have advocated legalization , or the study of it . The increase is slight , however , and Los Angeles school district rates , which tend to mirror those nationally , have not returned to their 1978 peak , when 65 % of high_school students said they had tried an illegal substance at least once . Michael Moran , a sergeant with the Los Angeles Police_Department ' s DARE ( Drug_Abuse Resistance Education ) program , says some of the biggest obstacles officers face are peer pressure and parental denial that &quot; their little darling could be doing something wrong. &quot; Moreover , he says , &quot; We used to tell children , ' If you use drugs , bad things will happen to you. ' It ' s not true . A lot of casual users go_on for years and function in what we think is a normal life . Until they are no longer here , we are going_to have a large_number of people buying drugs and they will have a major impact on our youth. &quot; * Despite official concern , the kids who are using pot say it is a pervasive and harmless pastime . &quot; Marijuana is not like crack . That messes you up bad , &quot; says Lorenzo , who has smoked marijuana for two years . Lorenzo , a Los Angeles high_school student , says he has managed to keep his secret from his parents . Ironically , his father is an alcohol and drug_abuse counselor . &quot; If my dad knew , he ' d probably throw me in rehab , &quot; he says . &quot; My parents never told me about drugs , so I had to experiment with them myself . But when you experiment too_much , you like it and then you get hooked. &quot; He says he gets high because it ' s the social thing to do . Marijuana , he says , expands his imagination , relaxes him and helps him cope_with problems at_home . He realizes that smoking pot has had an adverse effect on him ; his grade-point average has gone from a high C to a low D and he no longer plays interscholastic sports because he has become lethargic . Now he ditches classes to smoke and is out every weeknight , sometimes just kicking_back with his friends or out clubbing . That usually includes getting high because &quot; I can ' t have fun without bud ( marijuana ) . &quot; Julia , a 17-year-old senior at Ramona Opportunity School , says that since age 12 , she has experimented with &quot; everything except for heroin. &quot; At 14 , she was to selling rock cocaine to her friends . &quot; Lately , I ' ve been smoking primos -- weed mixed with rock cocaine , &quot; she says , sitting at a picnic table . &quot; I want some type of enjoyment . I kick it with my friends &quot; at house_parties , where she can select from a wide choice of drugs to use and buy . &quot; We just walk into the house and ask them for a dime ( $ 10 ) bag. &quot; If she buys from a friend , a dime bag usually goes_for $ 2 or $ 3 . &quot; Everybody is so used_to marijuana in their system that they don ' t even get buzzed_off of it no more . They just don ' t think it ' s dangerous , &quot; she says , adding that her friends are mixing marijuana with other drugs to sustain their highs . &quot; Yesterday , a girl was smoked_out on a frio ( marijuana laced with PCP ) . Her eyes were drooping . The teachers sense it . They don ' t even say nothing . What can they do ? Right now my friends are into smoking dust , marijuana with chemicals in it . It ' s a weird drug . One time my friend smoked it and he started to pretend he was a bird. &quot; Julia says adults have told her and her friends that drugs are bad , but the attitude among her classmates is that &quot; nobody cares to hear ' Just Say No. ' Drugs are just part of society. &quot; * Although the findings from the University of Michigan ' s study are disturbing , researchers point_out that the numbers still are below the levels of the 1970s . They also report that the 42 % of high_school seniors who said they had used an illicit drug at least once in their lives is still a minority . And many kids say they have been influenced by warnings from parents and experts and have chosen to stay_away_from drugs . Andrew , 16 , a 10th-grader at George_Washington Preparatory High_School , tried marijuana once , didn ' t like it and vows never to do_it again . &quot; I wanted to get high cause I had problems at_home . Bud doesn ' t make you do bad things , it makes you lazy and later you fall_asleep . I don ' t think it ' s a major big drug like crack , but I also know that it ' s bad . It ' s illegal. &quot; Others , like Maggie , 15 , learned the hard way . Four months ago , she thought she was going_to die after she smoked $ 200 worth of primos and took three LSD tabs in the span of two hours . Maggie , who began taking drugs when she was 12 because &quot; I just wanted to see how it felt to get high , &quot; entered a hospital drug-rehab program after the incident and has remained drug-free . &quot; You do drugs because you want to , not because anybody makes you , &quot; Maggie says . &quot; Everybody thinks that marijuana is not a bad drug . But I tripped_out on it , almost died . You hear from kids that ' it will never happen to me. ' I used to think like that . My friends say that I ' m going_to go_back to drugs . I ' m not going_to sit here and say that I ' m going_to stay drug-free the rest of my life because I don ' t know the future . But I do want to change. &quot; Dennis , 15 , a 10th-grader at John_Marshall High_School , says he knows marijuana is &quot; dangerous stuff &quot; because his parents have told him so . He says his friends who smoke pot and take other illicit drugs know that &quot; it ' s bad for them , but they don ' t care about the consequences until it ' s too late . They don ' t listen to anybody . I ' m tired that everyone is doing it. &quot; So is Melissa , 17 , a senior at Garfield High_School , who says that kids smoke in the restrooms and at a nearby fast-food restaurant during lunchtime , and that they ditch class to get high . &quot; I have never experimented with drugs , &quot; she says . &quot; My friends who do drugs don ' t act the same way . They were nicer before drugs . You could have a normal conversation with them , and now the only thing they talk_about is acid and marijuana . Even the people you ' d never imagine doing_it are doing_it -- student leaders , students involved in school activities and sports . A lot of them do_it because they are too stressed out. &quot; * For some &quot; good &quot; kids , the temptation is hard to resist . Jesse , a 17-year-old college-bound senior , athlete and straight-A student at an Eastside high_school , says he drinks beer and smokes weed just about every weekend because it ' s the social thing and &quot; it makes you less shy . It ' s a way to unwind . &quot; When the weekend comes , I don ' t want to think_about my homework . I don ' t want to think_about football practice . I wanna party. &quot; And partying almost always includes excessive beer guzzling and drinking a mixture of punch with whiskey and vodka -- and smoking bud . &quot; My parents are smart and everything , &quot; he says , &quot; but they think that we are just going_to a party to talk . If there ' s a party and there ' s no weed and no beer , no one goes . &quot; A lot of people think that it ' s just low-life and troubled kids who drink and do weed . But it is not , &quot; Jesse says . &quot; Us , the ones who are college bound , we know that we ' re not going_to be smoking pot all our lives and drinking . It ' s a sign of the times . Everyone is doing_it . It ' s fun . It ' s the ' 90s. &quot;</TEXT>
