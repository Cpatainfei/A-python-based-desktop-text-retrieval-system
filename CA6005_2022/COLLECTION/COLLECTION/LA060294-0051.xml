   <HEADLINE> TINY RAYS OF LIGHT IN HAITIAN CRISIS ; U.S. SPECIAL ENVOY REPORTS HOPEFUL DEVELOPMENTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The political crisis in Haiti has gone_on so frustratingly long that it would be easy to overlook a_couple_of small but significant signs of progress there recently for the Clinton_Administration . Under the fresh leadership of William H . Gray III , head of the United Negro College Fund and a former member of Congress , whom President Clinton recruited as his special envoy to Haiti , the United States has begun to rally the kind of regional support that will be needed to wait out the military junta that ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in late 1991 . Meeting with officials of the Dominican_Republic , for example , Gray was able to get their cooperation in cracking_down on the cross-border smuggling that has allowed the Haitian junta to get_around an international economic embargo . Haiti and the Dominican_Republic share the island of Hispaniola , and despite a history of rivalry between the two nations the Dominican government had turned_a_blind_eye to smuggling of oil and other goods into Haiti in violation of the U.N.-imposed embargo . That was until Gray visited the Dominican_Republic and persuaded President Joaquin Balaguer , whose recent reelection to office is being internally criticized due_to election irregularities , that this might be a good time for him to be_on good terms with Washington . As a result , Balaguer ordered hundreds of Dominican border guards transferred and replaced by elite troops from the Dominican army . The result has been at least a short-term drop_in smuggling . On Tuesday , Gray was in Jamaica to work_out the final details of an arrangement to better deal with the continued flow of Haitian refugees to the United States . Henceforth , rather than be returned directly to their homeland , as has been U.S. policy , Haitian refugees will be taken into the Jamaican port of Kingston by the U.S. Coast Guard . From there , refugees with legitimate claims to political asylum will be transferred to the United States or to a refugee center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . But while encouraging , both of these steps are only temporary fixes . They help relieve some of the political pressure on Clinton to &quot; do something &quot; about Haiti , and quickly . The problem is that this pressure could tempt the White_House to invade Haiti . Ousting the thuggish clique that ousted Aristide would be easy work for the Marines , of course . But getting the Marines out of Haiti after an invasion would be much more complicated . That is why simply waiting out the Haitian junta is still the preferred option . Haiti ' s military_leaders must be convinced that Washington and the rest of the world intend to make life as difficult as possible for them until they step aside and allow their nation ' s first popularly elected president to return . Gray ' s recent achievements in the Caribbean are important because they will contribute to that methodical long-term strategy .</TEXT>
