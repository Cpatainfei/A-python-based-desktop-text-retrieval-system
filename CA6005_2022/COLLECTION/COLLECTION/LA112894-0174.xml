   <HEADLINE> EX-POW GETS SOUVENIR BRICKS AT ' HANOI HILTON ' DEMOLITION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Workmen on Sunday knocked through a wall of a prison nicknamed the Hanoi Hilton by U.S. servicemen held there during the Vietnam_War . A luxury hotel is to be built_on the site . One former POW , retired Navy Capt . Cole Black , carried_away a_few souvenir bricks from the prison , a place of pilgrimage for returning veterans . Black , 62 , of Escondido , and his wife , Karen , along with other American tourists on a bus tour , peeked in the front gate at the intact cellblocks . &quot; They liked to put people in irons -- medieval-type punishment , &quot; Black recalled . &quot; The treatment was very bad. &quot; At the rear of the structure , workers with a backhoe and sledgehammers opened a hole big enough for trucks to enter . The prison , whose real name is Hoa Lo , was built by the colonial French government and held Vietnamese nationalists and Communists during the 1940s and 1950s . The first wife of Gen . Vo Nguyen Giap , commander of the guerrilla forces that drove French forces_out of Vietnam in 1954 , died there in the 1940s . After the United States began sending troops to prop_up non-Communist South Vietnam against the Communist North , the prison became notorious for holding American POWs , who coined the nickname . The prison ' s last residents , young Vietnamese convicts , were transferred to another facility earlier this year , officials said . Burton Engineering of Singapore and the Hanoi Construction Co . plan a 22-story luxury hotel at the site . Many Vietnamese are eager to replace the city ' s wartime relics with the modern trappings of economic development . Hanoi authorities already have cleared the wreckage of a downed American B-52 bomber from Lenin Park to make_way for another foreign hotel . Black was unsentimental about his visit to the prison where he was held_on and off for seven years until being released in 1973 after the United States and North Vietnam made_peace . He was shot down and taken prisoner about 60 miles northeast of Hanoi on June 21 , 1966 . Black said the visit was mostly at the urging of his wife , who is writing a fictionalized account of his war experiences . &quot; I had no special feelings about it , &quot; he said . &quot; I never really had a good look_at it from outside . Any time I ' d been taken_in or out I ' d been blindfolded. &quot;</TEXT>
