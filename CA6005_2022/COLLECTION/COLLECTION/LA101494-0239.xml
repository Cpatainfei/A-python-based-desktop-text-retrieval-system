   <HEADLINE> BORDER HAS TIGHTENED , OFFICIAL SAYS ; IMMIGRATION : DESPITE UPBEAT ASSESSMENT , JUSTICE_DEPARTMENT ATTORNEY SAYS WILSON HAS ' HINDERED ' SOLUTIONS . GOVERNOR ' S AIDE SAYS PRESSURE FROM STATE SPURRED THE ACTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Justice_Department ' s No . 2 official said Thursday that the Border_Patrol , with the aid of the Defense_Department , has sharply reduced the number of illegal immigrants coming_across a heavily traversed section of the California-Mexico border . Deputy Atty . Gen . Jamie Gorelick , returning from a two-day visit to the border south of San Diego , coupled her upbeat assessment with a prediction that the government will be able to &quot; secure the entire Southwest border. &quot; At the same time , Gorelick stepped_up the Administration ' s attack on California Gov . Pete Wilson , who has been highly critical of federal efforts to halt illegal entries . She rejected the suggestion that Wilson has put the immigration issue on the front burner and maintained that he has &quot; hindered &quot; solutions and &quot; has not been constructive at all. &quot; Sean Walsh , Wilson ' s press secretary , countered that it was California ' s three lawsuits against the federal_government that led to &quot; substantial action &quot; by the Clinton_Administration . Walsh dismissed as &quot; ludicrous &quot; Gorelick ' s statement that Wilson had strongly supported allowing California employers to hire illegal immigrants and had opposed sanctions against employers in certain industries . Gorelick , whose responsibilities include overseeing the Immigration and Naturalization Service , described looking_at sites where &quot; people had been running_across the border utterly unimpeded for years &quot; and finding them &quot; quiet. &quot; She provided no specific figures on the decrease , however . &quot; The fencing , the lighting , the sensors , the night scopes , the positioning of the Border_Patrol strategically with the assistance of friends in the Department_of_Defense who advised on the best deployment . . . and the new resources that we ' ve brought_to_bear at the border have really worked , &quot; Gorelick said . The Pentagon ' s Center for Low Intensity Conflict examined the topography and terrain for the Border_Patrol and helped site sensors , scopes and personnel &quot; to the maximum advantage , &quot; she said . &quot; There is not enough in the way of resources for us to link arms across the border from California to Texas . . . . It really made an enormous improvement by bringing_to_bear the learning from other situations , &quot; said Gorelick , who was the Pentagon ' s general counsel before moving to the Justice_Department . &quot; This is not to say that we have the entire Southwest border secured , but it is to say that a seemingly intractable problem is in fact addressable by equipment and manpower. &quot; Gorelick said she expects smugglers of immigrants to &quot; test our resources &quot; east of the 15 miles or so of the border that has already been secured , an area with &quot; less welcoming &quot; topography for attempted crossings . &quot; We have a very good planned deployment to address any effort on their part to move east , &quot; she said . The Border_Patrol now is extending its border-tightening effort east to meet_up_with improvements already in place in El Paso and is targeting Arizona for its next big effort . Atty . Gen . Janet Reno , who is in the San Diego area to attend a U.S. attorneys ' meeting there and to take another look_at the border situation , will announce additional border steps today . In her comments to reporters at the Justice_Department on Thursday , Gorelick was ambiguous on when she expects the Southwest border to be secure . &quot; I expect that we will indeed be able to secure the entire Southwest border over the course of this program , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
