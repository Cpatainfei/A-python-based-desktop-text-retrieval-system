   <HEADLINE> INITIATIVE MAY IGNITE HOT FIGHT FOR EL TORO ; MARINE BASE : AIRPORT BALLOT MEASURE SIGNALS THE START OF A POLITICAL SKIRMISH THAT PROMISES TO BREAK_UP TRADITIONAL ALLIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Setting the stage for perhaps one of the hottest political battles in Orange County ' s recent history , some influential business_leaders Tuesday filed a proposed ballot measure to let voters decide whether a commercial airport should be developed at the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station . Filing the Orange County / El Toro Economic Stimulus Initiative -- signed by Newport Beach businessman George L . Argyros and Marion Knott , a partner of Knott ' s Berry Farm -- unofficially begins the campaign to collect at least 66 # 703 signatures before June 1 to place the measure on the Nov . 8 ballot . &quot; El Toro is a regional asset that has the potential to become a ' job machine ' if it is properly converted &quot; to civilian use once the base is closed under military cutbacks , Argyros said in a statement Tuesday . But the filing also signals the start of a political battle that is not within the traditional rivalries . It does not pit Democrats against Republicans , nor moderates against conservatives , but instead breaks_up usual political allies who now sharply disagree on the airport issue . Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F . Riley , whose district includes the base and who chairs the county-sanctioned El Toro Reuse Planning Authority , said he feels &quot; personally saddened &quot; that the influential business_leaders , whom he knows , proceeded with the initiative &quot; and not one of them has talked to me. &quot; The issue ' s divisiveness is illustrated by the rancor within the politically powerful Lincoln Club , which was at first publicly perceived as the driving force behind the initiative . But while club leaders were speaking_for the ballot measure , other members -- particularly some living in south Orange County communities near the base -- grumbled that they were being railroaded . Club leaders were admonished during a weekend board of directors meeting for working_on the ballot initiative without approval by the conservative club ' s general membership or the board . The result is some Lincoln Club directors will be involved and provide financial_backing for the signature-gathering drive , but the club itself will officially remain neutral until the initiative is reviewed by members . Lincoln Club President Doy Henley was unavailable for comment Tuesday . But last week , as organizers finalized plans to file the initiative , Henley said he supported the commercial airport proposal but would not be involved in the campaign because it is not sanctioned by the club ' s membership . &quot; There are members of the Lincoln Club that are going_to be involved . . . some of our members will be up_to their eyeballs in this , and there will be some of our members maybe on the other side , &quot; Henley said . &quot; As president of the club , I am going_to do my job , which is to keep them all_in the club. &quot; And the dispute goes beyond the confines of the political organization . Business and industry groups , which are participating in the county planning process for the base , are assessing the political consequences of the initiative . Also , city leaders in north Orange County , who generally favor an airport , are expected to square_off against South County officials who fear a commercial airport will ruin their quality_of_life . &quot; The battle_lines have clearly been drawn between those who advocate a rational , analytical approach and those who have predetermined El Toro ' s use and who are interested in furthering their financial_gains , &quot; said Laguna Hills Councilwoman Melody Carruth . Carruth conceded there is no evidence that the business_leaders involved in the initiative will personally gain from development at the site . The campaign for the ballot measure will be funded through a group called Committee for 21 # 000 New Jobs , a reference_to the expansion in the local economy that petition organizers believe will occur if a passenger and cargo airport is built at El Toro . The proposed initiative asks voters to approve an amendment to the county ' s General Plan that would require a civilian airport on about 2 # 000 acres of the 4 # 700-acre base , and seeks interim use of the runways by air cargo carriers while the Marine Corps phases_out its mission by 1999 . The measure also proposes replacing the county ' s El Toro planning agency with a 13-member advisory commission that would make redevelopment recommendations to the county supervisors , who would then have final decision-making authority over the remaining land not used for an airport . If the ballot measure is approved , it cannot be changed unless another public vote is held . But the sponsors acknowledge that the development of an airport is a complex process and are offering some flexibility , allowing the measure to be amended if a federal or state agency denies airport use , or under other specific conditions . The 21-page proposal contains the arguments the airport proponents are expected to use during the campaign , including : * An airport at El Toro would create 21 # 000 &quot; high paying new jobs &quot; and increase business revenue in Orange County by about $ 1.7 billion a year . * An estimated 375 # 000 tons of air cargo business is lost every year to Los Angeles International Airport and Ontario International Airport because the county ' s facility , John Wayne Airport , cannot accommodate the air cargo industry . Also , about 4 million passengers go_to other airports each year because John Wayne is legally limited , because of size and as part of a federal_court settlement , to 8.4 million passengers . * El Toro ' s existing runways can be made available in times of national emergency or for natural disaster preparedness . &quot; Orange County has lost more_than 122 # 000 jobs since 1990 . Our construction_industry is flat , real_estate is depressed , our aerospace industry is suffering from severe defense-related cutbacks , &quot; according to Argyros ' statement . &quot; To turn this trend around and provide a strong economy for future generations , we must seize upon the opportunity that El Toro presents. &quot; But Riley responded that the county also is looking_to create new jobs . &quot; Do they think that what we are going_to do won ' t do that ? &quot; Riley said . County supervisors rejected the idea of an initiative last week , arguing it would be premature to hold an election before an El Toro planning agency has time to study the redevelopment options for the base . The agency consists_of the supervisors , three Irvine council_members and a Lake Forest council_member . Carruth agreed with Riley . &quot; Do they think it ' s the intention of the ( planning agency ) to establish a 4 # 700-acre park ? &quot; In a recent letter to the head of the Lincoln Club , Assemblyman Bill Morrow ( R-Oceanside ) also argued against the airport campaign . Morrow said &quot; it would be disheartening to see so_much effort and so many dollars diverted &quot; away from the club ' s traditional goal of electing a Republican majority to the state Legislature .</TEXT>
