   <HEADLINE> FARMERS ARE LIKELY TO SEE RECORD CROPS , LOWER PRICES ; AGRICULTURE : IDEAL CONDITIONS WILL BRING 10 BILLION BUSHELS OF CORN , GOVERNMENT SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Farmers are expecting a record corn harvest this year , but it will probably mean lower prices . The U.S. Agriculture_Department is also forecasting new production records for soybeans and cotton . The department predicted Wednesday that corn production will total 10 billion bushels , breaking the previous record of 9.48 billion set_in 1992 . The forecast was based on field surveys conducted Nov . 1 . The corn-growing season was ideal in most areas this year , contrasting with the flooding and drought that held the 1993 corn harvest to 6.34 billion bushels . In fact , the latest production forecast was up 4 % , or 408 million bushels , from the October estimate and 58 % above the 1993 crop . But the increase resulted in a lower price estimate for the crop : down 5 cents a bushel to between $ 1.85 and $ 2.25. The department forecast a soybean crop of 2.52 billion bushels , breaking the previous record of 2.26 billion set_in 1979 . While the forecast was 3 % above the October estimate and 35 % more_than was harvested last year , foreign purchases drove the season average price forecast up about 20 cents . The November forecast ranged from $ 4.80 to $ 5.50 a bushel . The report says corn yields are expected to average a record 138.4 bushels an acre , up 4.6 bushels from the October forecast and seven bushels above the 1992 record . Yields averaged 100.7 bushels an acre in 1993 . Soybean yields also are forecast at a record 41.5 bushels an acre , 1 bushel above Oct . 1 and 8.9 bushels above a year earlier . The soybean production forecast is 65 million bushels more_than the department ' s October projection . The department also forecast the cotton harvest at 19.5 million bales , up 1 % from the October forecast and 21 % more_than 1993 . Yields are expected to average 695 pounds an acre , up 5 pounds from last month and 89 pounds from last year .</TEXT>
