   <HEADLINE> CHIEF ' S MEMO ON DRUG SALES CHALLENGED ; CRIME : LEGAL EXPERTS CONTRADICT CLAIMS THAT SELLING OF ROCK COCAINE TO SUSPECTS BY SANTA ANA POLICE RESULTS IN STRONGER CASES AGAINST OFFENDERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Police_Chief Paul M . Walters misinformed the City_Council when he explained his secret operation to send undercover officers onto the streets to sell county-made crack cocaine . In a memo sent to the mayor and council after the operation came_to_light last week , Walters said the department needed to use real cocaine in_order to make felony cases against drug_users and send them to prison . The chief also told the council that even those drug suspects who ended_up in drug diversion programs -- instead of custody -- still would remain under legal scrutiny on probation . But police and legal_experts say both statements are incorrect : The police still could file felonies using cocaine substitutes . And people who complete diversion programs end_up with their cases dismissed -- and are not on probation . &quot; There ' s no probation , there ' s no anything . Your case is over with , &quot; Deputy Public_Defender Brian Ducker said . &quot; You ' ve been diverted out of the criminal justice system . that ' s the purpose. &quot; Speaking in behalf of the chief , Capt . Bruce R . Carlson said the letter was intended to provide council_members with facts about the program so they could answer questions in the community . He said there was no intention to mislead the council_members . &quot; This was not a sales pitch for what we ' re doing . This was to try to relate the facts as clearly as we could so ( council_members ) could answer questions , &quot; he said . &quot; This is a program we want to continue using because there ' s no other way . We ' re not necessarily married to anything , but if it works we feel we should continue on it. &quot; Carlson also said that the best way to ensure strong felony cases is to use real drugs , and said he needed additional information before commenting on the diversion issue . He declined to say who drafted the memo , which bears the chief ' s signature , but said the information came_out of discussions with the district_attorney ' s office . For the past 18 months , Santa Ana police_officers have obtained court_orders to sell rock cocaine on the streets in an effort to bust small-time buyers . More_than 350 people have been arrested for buying the rocks , which are processed in the Orange County Sheriff ' s Department ' s crime lab from powdered cocaine confiscated in other Santa Ana drug raids . Police and prosecutors say most of the 350 people arrested in Santa Ana were first-time buyers who were allowed to enter diversion programs rather than face jail time . The chief ' s memo states that those first-time offenders &quot; are subject_to search and seizure and they are_on felony probation at the completion of their diversion program. &quot; But Carl Armbrust , who heads the district_attorney ' s Narcotics Enforcement Team and helped craft the Santa Ana operation , said that anyone who completes diversion has his case dismissed and is not on probation . The memo also says that it is essential to use real cocaine to file felony charges . &quot; Using any other substance would result in only a misdemeanor charge of soliciting for a drug purchase , &quot; the memo said . The Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s Department , however , has made 392 felony arrests using fake cocaine in reverse stings since February and 99 % have been &quot; successfully prosecuted , &quot; said Capt . Dennis Dahlman , commander of the Sheriff ' s Department ' s Narcotics Bureau . &quot; Attempted possession is a felony . We ' ve prosecuted a_few people under the three strikes law , &quot; said Dahlman , referring to the new state law that calls_for 25 years to life in prison for third-time felons . Armbrust said his office used to charge suspects with felony attempted possession when they purchased fake narcotics in reverse-sting operations , but decided the Santa Ana cases would be stronger if officers sold the real_thing . &quot; We decided that that would be kind of a Mickey_Mouse charge , &quot; Armbrust said . In Florida , hundreds of convictions were overturned after a state court ruled that the Broward County ' s manufacture of rock cocaine in a similar operation was illegal and &quot; shocked the conscience. &quot; The technique of using real drugs is controversial because suspects sometimes swallow the rock or throw it away before an officer can recover it . Several Santa Ana council_members said Friday that they were confident the chief ' s memo contained accurate information . &quot; I believe the information was correct and I don ' t have any reason not to believe it . I ' m comfortable with what was presented to us , &quot; Councilman Thomas E . Lutz said . &quot; If the chief tells me that it ' s not correct , then I ' ll worry about it then. &quot; Several said they have heard only positive comments from residents . &quot; They ' re glad that something is being done_in an aggressive manner to be able to remove people from the streets , and within the law , &quot; Councilwoman Patricia A . McGuigan said . Councilwoman Lisa Mills said she was told that the information in the memo came directly from the district_attorney ' s office . &quot; I ' d like to have a follow-up from the chief , &quot; she said . &quot; If it turns_out that any of the information is incorrect , I ' m sure he ' ll follow up with new information . He ' s very good at that. &quot;</TEXT>
