   <HEADLINE> BRIEFING PAPER ; MIDEAST SPOTLIGHT SHIFTING TO GOLAN ; THE BACKGROUND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For all_the barriers surmounted in achieving the first Israeli-Palestinian peace pact last week , the next round of Middle_East peace talks -- budding negotiations between mortal_enemies Israel and Syria -- looms as a more difficult and perhaps more important step_in the search for peace in the region . The American role is also likely to be far more demanding than in the Israeli-Palestinian talks , which proceeded largely without the good offices of the United States . The new shuttle diplomacy of Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher between Jerusalem and Damascus also represents the Clinton_Administration ' s most ambitious full-fledged venture into the world ' s most volatile region . The rewards for all three parties are , thus , potentially far greater . But so are the risks , Israeli and American analysts say . &quot; Geopolitically , there ' s much more to be gained with an Israeli-Syrian peace , which will set_in_motion a series of regional changes , &quot; said Geoffrey Kemp , a former National Security_Council staff_member in the Ronald Reagan_Administration . &quot; Because of Syrian involvement elsewhere and its alliances , problems like Lebanon or Iranian terrorism on Israel ' s borders will effectively be resolved , while U.S. strategy in the region will be immeasurably helped. &quot; Peace between Syria and Israel would effectively end the Arab-Israeli conflict , since there is little chance of a serious war without Syria ' s involvement , several analysts said . And a formal pact could reap benefits as far as North Africa and the Persian_Gulf , perhaps fostering new regional economic arrangements and isolating extremist regimes in places such_as Baghdad , Tripoli and Tehran . Yet as the new round of diplomacy begins , a senior Administration source is forecasting rough times . &quot; There will be breakdowns , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s predictable and people will say we failed . we ' ll have to be prepared to take the heat. &quot; On several levels , the next phase of Middle_East peace efforts will be different . The Parties Syria , a state almost 10 times the size of Israel , has much more leverage than the Palestine Liberation Organization . Syria and Israel share a strategic border , while the PLO has not even had a reliable front-line position since it was forced to abandon southern Lebanon in 1982 . Also , Syrian President Hafez Assad has an authoritarian hold_on power and decision-making , while PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat ' s leadership has been dissipating by challenges from moderate , leftist and Islamic forces . &quot; The PLO had no bargaining_chips and its internal weakness forced it to give_in to Israeli demands , &quot; said Talcott Seelye , former U.S. ambassador to Syria . &quot; But Assad , as much as he may now want peace , is in a stronger position to hold_out for his terms. &quot; Unlike the late Egyptian President Anwar Sadat , Assad is also unwilling to take the kind of steps necessary to persuade the Israeli people that he is committed to peace . In 1977 , Sadat flew to Israel and addressed the Knesset , the Israeli Parliament , a gesture that opened the way for the Camp David peace talks and the return of the Sinai_Peninsula . The Issues The agenda is theoretically simpler . The centerpiece is a land-for-peace deal that would return the Golan Heights , occupied since 1967 , to Syria in exchange for peace and security for Israel . But the swap is far from straightforward . The Golan is of great strategic value to both Israel and Syria . &quot; It ' s not like the Sinai , &quot; the Administration official said . &quot; It ' s much harder to use it or develop it as a buffer zone in the way the Sinai was between Egypt and Israel. &quot; A long history of distrust must also be overcome before Israel returns any territory . For almost 20 years , Syrian gunners perched on the Golan shelled the kibbutzim around the Sea of Galilee below . The region ' s most bitter enemies also fought bloody battles in 1967 and 1973 on the craggy heights . And the Golan is now home to about 15 # 000 Jewish settlers . &quot; I don ' t think our government can accept the Assad approach and give_back all_of the Golan Heights , &quot; said former military commander Ori Orr , now chairman of the powerful Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and a confidante of Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin . Reflecting a widespread Israeli view , Orr added : &quot; Israel is not ready for such a withdrawal . There is just no trust of Assad here , and it will take a considerable amount_of_time to develop it. &quot; The second basis of distrust has been Assad ' s use of Lebanon and political surrogates , from Palestinian rejectionists to the Islamic Hezbollah militia , to pressure Israel . Any deal on the Golan , thus , also must include fairly explicit guarantees about Syria ' s long-term regional intentions , notably in Lebanon , where Syria has tens of thousands of troops . &quot; All the terrorist operations in Lebanon depend_on Syria , on Assad personally . . . . Assad may talk peace , but we will look_to see what he does_in Lebanon to assess whether he can be believed , &quot; Orr said . The Process Although Israel is suggesting a three-stage withdrawal over five to eight years , the real scope of the talks is all or nothing -- not incremental like the Israel-PLO accord . &quot; We ' re not talking_about an interim agreement , &quot; a senior Administration official involved in the process said . &quot; The parties have focused_on end results of the negotiations rather than putting it off until later . Syria is insisting on full agreement on the Golan Heights , while Israel is looking_for a full peace. &quot; Whatever the change in Syrian and Israeli leaders ' attitudes toward peace , the process will require a massive shift in public_opinion in both countries . The Mediators Israel and the PLO managed their own negotiations , first in secret in Oslo , then in public in several venues . The Israelis were quite pleased to have done_it themselves . When Christopher was invited to witness the Cairo signing last week , a leading Israeli commentator remarked that &quot; it was a celebratory photo-op adding some rouge to his pale foreign policy. &quot; Key Israelis would also prefer direct talks with Damascus . For months , Israel sought a secret link , first in contacts between the Israeli and Syrian ambassadors to Washington , then by Israeli and Syrian military strategists meeting in Europe . But Assad wants Washington drawn_in , first to mediate a framework for talks and eventually to guarantee the final terms . American involvement also ultimately would pay_off on one of the biggest incentives for Syrian participation : a better relationship with the world ' s most powerful country . Some Israelis also want an American presence . &quot; Without the United States , and Warren Christopher personally , I don ' t expect we will make much , if any , progress with Syria , &quot; Yossi Beilin , deputy Israeli foreign_minister and the guiding hand of the Oslo link , said this week . American officials also would prefer direct talks . &quot; It would be better if they would talk between themselves , &quot; the senior Administration official said . &quot; that ' s one way to make_it enduring . But for better or worse , we are now in the middle of the Syrian-Israeli deal. &quot; Although the United States would gain politically , economically and militarily from a peace agreement , failure also could be a disaster for the Clinton_Administration . This is the first major initiative it is guiding from the start , and it will be unable to blame previous Presidents , if it falls_apart . ROBIN WRIGHT and MICHAEL PARKS / TIMES STAFF WRITERS</TEXT>
