   <HEADLINE> U.S. CONSIDERS MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO CAMBODIA ; SOUTHEAST_ASIA : STRENGTH OF REBEL KHMER ROUGE PROMPTS CONCERN . THAILAND , OTHER NATIONS OPPOSE ARMS SHIPMENTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The United States is considering sending military assistance to Cambodia after a series of battlefield victories by anti-government Khmer Rouge rebels , a senior Clinton_Administration official said Wednesday . Winston Lord , assistant secretary_of_state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs , told the Australian Broadcasting Corp . that the United States is consulting with Australia and Cambodia ' s neighbors about what kind of aid should be sent to help it &quot; promote development , stability and democracy. &quot; Australian Foreign Minister Gareth Evans said his government is also &quot; seriously considering &quot; a request from Phnom Penh for military aid . &quot; Any military assistance to the Indochina area has a lot of historical resonance and potent political sensitivity , so we would want to work extremely closely with the Congress on this , &quot; Lord said . &quot; On the other hand , the Congress feels very strongly about the return of the Khmer Rouge to power. &quot; The United States has sent no arms to Indochina since the fall of Saigon in South Vietnam and Phnom Penh in Cambodia to Communist forces in April , 1975 . Arming Indochina is a highly emotional issue for many Americans because few have forgotten that the ill-fated U.S. involvement in the region began when President John F . Kennedy sent advisers to aid the South Vietnamese army in the early 1960s . Asked if he favored sending U.S. military_personnel to help train Cambodia ' s army rather than sending arms , Lord replied : &quot; The new integrated army needs training and a lot of help to be effective as a fighting force. &quot; The Khmer Rouge are widely blamed for the deaths of more_than 1 million Cambodians in a reign_of_terror in the late 1970s . The group refused to take_part in U.N.-sponsored elections in Cambodia last year and has refused to surrender large areas of western Cambodia to the newly elected government . In March , Cambodia ' s newly integrated royal army seized Anlong Veng and Pailin , two important Khmer Rouge-held towns near the border with Thailand . The government lost Anlong Veng almost immediately and managed to hold_on to Pailin , a gem-mining center and the Khmer Rouge headquarters , for only a month . The loss of the two towns represented a public relations catastrophe for the fledgling government in Phnom Penh , especially after reports that its army , which had clear numerical superiority , bolted when its commanding_officers fled in panic . Foreigners and thousands of residents of the western Cambodian city of Battambang were reported to have pulled_back to Phnom Penh as anxiety rose about a looming Khmer Rouge offensive . That concern appeared to have receded slightly Wednesday when Western aid officials reported that a Khmer Rouge attack against the northwestern town of Mongkol Borey appeared to have been repulsed by government troops and that the Maoist guerrillas had pulled_back . Still , Cambodia ' s neighbors in Southeast_Asia are growing anxious that the deteriorating military situation might unravel the delicate power-sharing arrangement that was hammered_out last summer after the elections . Under that deal , King Norodom Sihanouk ' s son , Prince Norodom Ranariddh , became the country ' s first prime_minister , while former Communist Premier Hun Sen became second prime_minister , and other top jobs were similarly parceled_out . &quot; The last thing we can afford now is to have a conflict and crisis in our region , &quot; Singapore Foreign Minister Shanmugam Jayakumar told a conference on Asia ' s future Wednesday . &quot; We are watching the developments in Cambodia with some concern. &quot; Despite the gravity of the situation , Cambodia ' s appeals_to its neighbors for arms aid in the last six months have been met by stony silence . The government army is said to have nearly exhausted its inventory of ammunition . Thailand repeated Wednesday that it opposes the United States or Australia sending arms to Cambodia . Deputy Prime_Minister Amnuay Viravan told the same international conference in Singapore that Bangkok &quot; questions the wisdom of sending arms to Cambodia , &quot; preferring instead to see a political solution to the conflict . The Cambodian government has accused the Thai military of resupplying the Khmer Rouge from stockpiles kept_on the Thai side of the border . While the Thais have denied the charges , last year , Thai police publicly displayed captured Khmer Rouge trucks carrying tons of war materiel at a base inside Thailand . Judging by past practice of seeking &quot; consensus &quot; before taking joint action , Thailand ' s opposition effectively means that the Assn . of Southeast Asian_Nations -- which includes Thailand , Malaysia , Singapore , Indonesia , Brunei and the Philippines -- is likely to try to block Western assistance to Phnom Penh . In an effort to reach a peaceful settlement of the civil_war , Sihanouk has proposed that the Phnom Penh government hold talks with the Khmer Rouge in Pyongyang , North_Korea , on May 27 . Ranariddh , Hun Sen and National Assembly Chairman Chea Sim announced Wednesday that they had agreed to attend the talks with the Khmer Rouge ' s nominal leader , Khieu Samphan . Sihanouk , who left Phnom Penh for Beijing on Wednesday to continue treatment for cancer , has suggested that the Khmer Rouge declare a unilateral cease-fire and open_up their territory while a role for the party in the government is negotiated . The Khmer Rouge have rejected the suggestion .</TEXT>
