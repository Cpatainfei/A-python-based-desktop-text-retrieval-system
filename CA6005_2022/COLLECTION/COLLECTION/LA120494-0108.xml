   <HEADLINE> 1930S REDUX IN BOSNIA ; THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY ALLOWED THE AGGRESSION OF THAT ERA TO CONTINUE UNCHECKED . ARE WE REPEATING THE SAME MISTAKE NOW ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The international attempt to curb the murderous program of the Serbs in Bosnia and facilitate a peaceful settlement appears to be over . The United States , the North Atlantic Treaty Or ganization and the United Nations are close to capitulating to defiant use of brute force by the aggressors . The message delivered to the victims , the Muslims of Bosnia , is that they must either surrender and accept whatever shred of autonomous territory , if any , the Serbs will permit or suffer more death and starvation with no hope of outside succor . This sickening situation is similar in many respects_to the pitiful and portentous failure of the League of Nations , predecessor to the United Nations , and of major governments to deal with aggression , violence and contempt for international obligations in the 1930s . Those who would dismiss the tragedy in Bosnia as of no consequence except to the Bosnians should be required to study the earlier disgrace and ponder its consequences . The debacle of the 1930s involved four events : the failure of the League of Nations to have the slightest effect on Italy ' s conquest and annexation of the independent nation of Ethiopia ; the acquiescence by Britain and France of the illegal military occupation of the Rhineland by Adolf Hitler ' s Germany ; the passive acceptance of the overthrow , aided by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy , of the Spanish government by Gen . Francisco Franco , and the infamous appeasement at Munich , where Hitler was allowed to seize part of Czechoslovakia . The United States played a minor_role in the events of the 1930s , not being a member of the League of Nations and with isolationist congressional and public_opinion viewing events in Europe as of no concern to America . But if today ' s trends continue , that difference between then and now may diminish . Italy ' s attack on Ethiopia , in 1935 , was unequivocal aggression . The League of Nations did impose an embargo on arms sales to Italy -- which had all_the arms it needed -- but did not block the delivery of oil , the one commodity that could have crippled the Italian attack . Italian forces used tanks , air_power and poison_gas against untrained and ill-equipped Ethiopians . In spite of Ethiopia ' s eloquent pleas in the League of Nations , the_British and French governments decided it was more important to stay_on good terms with Italy than to save a backward , uncivilized African_nation . In 1936 , the conquest was complete -- and the League of Nations was dead , for all practical purposes . Hitler ' s March , 1936 , military occupation of the Rhineland , the region between the eastern border of France and the Rhine_River , did not involve the use of lethal force , but its strategic consequences were immense . In 1925 , Germany had willingly agreed that the Rhineland would not be fortified -- thereby avowing an intention not to commit aggression against its neighbors . If Germany violated the treaty , Britain and France had a right to resist with force . But Hitler believed Britain and France were spineless and would accept a fait_accompli even though they were militarily superior to Germany at the time . He was right . There was hand-wringing in London and Paris -- but nothing more . Hitler ' s gamble was successful and he was emboldened to press_on with rearmament and further challenges to international order . The year 1936 also saw the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War , with Franco ' s attack on the republican government in Madrid . Franco was well-armed with German and Italian weapons and assisted by German and Italian &quot; volunteer &quot; troops . The British and French , however , sought to isolate themselves from the conflict by forbidding arms deliveries or other assistance to the contending sides in Spain . The result was similar to the arms embargo for Bosnia in the 1990s : The victim was denied arms , the aggressor was well-equipped . The United States participated in the arms embargo not by international agreement but through a law forbidding the export of arms to any nation engaged in international or civil_war . The only outside assistance to the Spanish government came from the Soviet_Union and from communist and other left-wing international volunteers . Neither side would consider serious negotiations for a peaceful settlement , and the killing went_on and on -- until an estimated million lives were lost before Franco ' s triumph in January , 1939 . Meanwhile , the best known of the four events took_place in Munich in September , 1938 , where the_British and French governments , intimidated by Hitler ' s threat to go_to_war to seize a large part of Czechoslovakia , gave what was not theirs to give . Czechoslovakia was partitioned . A few months later , Hitler took the rest of Czechoslovakia , and a year later , he attacked Poland and ignited World_War_II . Of course , the parallels between the 1930s and the 1990s are not exact . The ruthless methods of the Serbs are similar to those of Nazi Germany , but the Serbs , in themselves , are not a threat to the security of Europe , as_a_whole . But neither was Italy ' s conquest of Ethiopia , nor the militarization of the Rhineland , nor the blood bath in Spain , nor the elimination of Czechoslovakia . British and French politicians in the 1930s saw these events as separate , regrettable but not as catastrophic . They congratulated themselves for containing the spread of violence -- until they were overwhelmed by the greatest violence of the 20th Century . Ten or 20 years from now , the failure in Bosnia may be recalled with the same despair as were the events of the 1930s during and after World_War_II . The historians of the next century may write that the triumph of Serbian aggression , confirmed by the withdrawal of NATO and U.N. forces and by the incoherence of U.S. policy , was a dark turning point . They may have to write that Bosnia was followed by the self-destruction of the United Nations as an instrument for the prevention and punishment of aggression , and the return of the United States to irresponsible isolationism . They may have to chronicle a succession of Bosnias perpetrated by people ready to find rewards through killing others , with violence spreading and coalescing across Eastern Europe , the former Soviet_Union , Africa and the Middle_East -- violence employing ever more destructive weapons . Such a horrible scenario is obviously speculation . The Bosnian example may_not occur elsewhere . But for leaders to dismiss the possibility , to do nothing to engage the citizenry of all countries in serious discussion leading toward a willingness to act , is to make horror more likely . A city built of tinderbox homes and without a fire_department may escape a great fire . Just don ' t count_on it . The first_step toward a resolution in Bosnia should be to take all necessary steps for the fulfillment of the peace plan proposed earlier this year by the United States , Britain , France , Germany and Russia -- and accepted by the Bosnian government . This means resolute rejection of the fatalistic arguments that it is too late to save the victims of aggression in Bosnia , or that domestic political constraints in the United States and the other NATO countries are insurmountable , or that the United States and Western Europe should not risk discord with Moscow , or that the United Nations is the problem and not the solution . Rejecting fatalistic arguments requires that leaders , parliaments and general publics be aware of how their counterparts in the 1930s behaved and with what consequences. *</TEXT>
