   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : SUPER-REGIONALS BANK ON INTERSTATE CONSOLIDATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Quietly , almost without notice , Congress recently passed a law allowing interstate banking -- and provided an object_lesson that times change but visions endure in business . Interstate banking was the great vision of Amadeo Peter Giannini , who founded Bank of America in 1904 . And it was the cause of enormous controversy in the 1920s , as Giannini tried to put his ideas into practice , acquiring banks across the country -- forming the present-day First Interstate Bancorp and Transamerica Corp . in the process -- and preaching that banks should sell insurance and investments as well as make loans . Banking aroused passions in those days , and Giannini ' s efforts were thwarted by rival bankers in the East , Wall_Street financiers , the onset of the Great Depression and laws restricting interstate branching , passed_by a Congress fearful that powerful banks would control the economy . Times change . Fearing that weak banks would undermine the economy , regulators in recent years have encouraged interstate mergers to keep bank doors open in Texas and other states suffering recession . And so a consolidation has begun in U.S. banking , from 14 # 000 banking_companies less than a decade ago to 10 # 840 today . From that pack has emerged a group of strong banks with operations in several states , known as the super-regionals . They include Nationsbank , based in Charlotte , N.C. , with 1 # 900 bank offices in 10 states ; Pittsburgh-based Mellon Bank , which this year acquired Dreyfus Corp. , the mutual_fund company ; Los Angeles ' First Interstate , which owns 1 # 100 banks in 13 states and Cleveland-based KeyCorp , with more_than 1 # 300 banks in 13 states from Alaska to Maine . The super-regionals , large outfits at $ 50 billion assets and more per company , reflect a banking_industry on_the_move . But they don ' t arouse fears of concentration , as banks did when the U.S. economy was dominated by big companies . Rather , the super-regionals serve the new American economy , aiming to make loans to small and medium-sized businesses and consumers . &quot; It ' s community banking , &quot; says Victor Riley , chairman of KeyCorp , who started from Albany , N.Y. , and built his company through acquisitions in smaller cities -- Tacoma , Wash. , not Seattle ; Fort Collins , Colo. , not Denver . It ' s a &quot; big-fish-small-pond &quot; strategy that earns higher rates of profit than most big-name global banks -- such_as Citicorp , Chemical and Chase Manhattan -- can muster . that ' s why the stock_market accords Key , Mellon and the others a higher price-earnings ratio than the global banks . This year , Riley , who was born in 1931 -- the year Giannini almost went bankrupt trying to shore_up Bank of America stock against raids by speculators -- made a move that caught the attention of the banking_industry and pointed_the_way to its future . He merged KeyCorp . with Society Corp . of Cleveland to create an institution with $ 60 billion in assets and a major capability in managing investments . Society was the successor to the old Cleveland Trust , a manager of industrial family money dating to the 19th Century . The new company starts_out with $ 34 billion under management , financial products for managing 401 ( k ) accounts and other employee benefit plans and a successful line of mutual_funds . And that ' s the key to the banks ' future , says Riley . With interest_rates rising on what banks have to pay_for deposits and competition heating_up to make loans , profits on traditional lending will narrow , he notes : &quot; So we ' ll have to do more varied business with our customers , manage their pension and employee benefit plans. &quot; Investment management has been thought of as the domain of the brokerage and mutual_fund firms , Merrill Lynch and Fidelity and such . Bankers were deemed too slow-witted to keep_up with highly paid fund managers . &quot; But with the trust assets our company has now , we can contract_out for the best money managing talent , &quot; Riley says . The battle is joined to manage the fabled savings of the baby_boomers . that ' s why Mellon Bank acquired Dreyfus . Analyst Thomas Hanley of CS First Boston says he thinks KeyCorp will take more steps , acquiring or forming a joint_venture with a money management firm . The business will grow rapidly , 12 % to 15 % a year , Hanley predicts . And banks could do_well , because they offer loans as well as benefits management . &quot; Because of their experience in judging credit risks , banks seem destined to maintain a key role &quot; in financial services , says John Hoenig , president of the Federal_Reserve_Bank of Kansas City . Otherwise , the strategies of KeyCorp , First Interstate and other super-regionals point_up several trends in the U.S. economy : First , that it is basically strong . Competition to make loans means there is money around , with banks vying to lend to small and medium-sized businesses . Also , the move_into asset management will force banks to greater cost reductions . &quot; Banks have to get their costs as low as Fidelity and Vanguard and other fund outfits , &quot; says analyst Raphael Soifer of Brown Brothers Harriman . that ' s why First Interstate last week announced staff cuts and consolidation of facilities . But most significant for California , the passage of the interstate banking law will prompt more banks to come here -- and those already here to beef_up operations . First Interstate Chairman Edward Carson also said last week that the bank would concentrate_on its western territory and not try to go nationwide . KeyCorp ' s Riley says he understands the attraction , in a global and historic context . &quot; Just think_of what built so many cities on the Atlantic coast , from Baltimore to Philadelphia to Boston . It was trade , &quot; he says . &quot; They grew on trade with Europe. &quot; But now there are new directions . &quot; On the West Coast , cities are growing on trade with the Pacific Rim and Latin_America , &quot; Riley notes , &quot; and there are four times as_many people in Asia as in Europe. &quot; that ' s why KeyCorp is seeking to arrange new business_relationships in California , he adds . A.P. Giannini , in his time , looked in the other direction , but the idea was the same . Vision endures .</TEXT>
