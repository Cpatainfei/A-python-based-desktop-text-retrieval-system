   <HEADLINE> WHY HEALTH-CARE REFORM MAY BE BEYOND SAVING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Comprehensive health-care reform is in big trouble . Here ' s the reason : President Bill_Clinton has lost the support of a crucial political ally -- the middle_class . Without the support of the middle_class , the odds are against the President on health_care . Those odds worsened considerably last week with Clinton ' s stunning defeat in the House of Representatives on the crime bill . Members of Congress weren ' t afraid of the President . They figured there was no price to pay_for defying him . Imagine what would have happened to a congressman who crossed Lyndon B . Johnson or Ronald Reagan on a vote like that . In politics , where there ' s no fear , there ' s no clout . If the President couldn ' t get members to cast an easy vote on a popular measure like the crime bill , imagine how hard it will be to get them to cast a tough vote on health-care reform . That wasn ' t the way it was supposed to be . Clinton got elected President as the champion of &quot; people who work hard and play by the rules. &quot; that ' s what being a &quot; New Democrat &quot; means . The &quot; Old Democrats &quot; were the ones who wanted to tax the middle_class to pay_for social-welfare programs for the poor . Now look_at what ' s happened . A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll taken last week asked people who they thought would benefit most from health-care reform : &quot; upper-class Americans , the middle_class , the poor , or everyone about equally &quot; ? Answer : the poor . Who did people think would be hurt most by reform ? Answer : the middle_class . Now , this is strange , because what created the health-care issue in the first place was middle-class panic . The recession of 1990-91 had a devastating impact on white-collar employment . It created a terrifying prospect for middle-class workers who had no unions to protect them . Losing their jobs meant losing their health_insurance -- and their families ' health_insurance . To make matters worse , health-care costs were rising out_of_sight . Individual health_insurance was unaffordable . Medical problems carried the threat of impoverishment . It was Harris Wofford who showed Democrats the way in November , 1991 . He asked a devastating question : If every criminal has a right to a lawyer , shouldn ' t every American citizen have a right to a doctor ? With that , Wofford trounced the Bush_Administration ' s stand-in candidate , former Atty . Gen . Dick Thornburgh , in the Pennsylvania U.S. Senate election . Clinton took_up the health-care issue and rode it all_the way to the White_House . He even figured_out how to make_sure the issue appealed_to the middle_class . Clinton insisted throughout on &quot; universal coverage. &quot; Universal means available to everybody ; in other words , not means-tested . If a program is means-tested , the benefits go_to the people who need them the most , i.e. , the poor . And the middle_class pays the bill . that ' s Old Democratic thinking . The definition of the middle_class in this country is simple : neither rich nor poor . Middle-class people know there are people poorer than themselves . They know government programs based on &quot; need &quot; will help poor people , because their needs are the greatest . Government programs like Social_Security and Medicare are not based on need . that ' s why they are politically sacrosanct . They help everyone , whether they need it or not . that ' s why such &quot; entitlement &quot; programs are so expensive : You have to bribe the middle_class to support programs that only incidentally help the poor . Clinton deliberately modeled his health-care plan after Social_Security . Remember the health security card he held_up in his State of the Union speech last January ? It looked just like a Social_Security card . It was supposed to . Clinton figured that his dogged insistence on universal coverage was the key to winning the middle_class . Democrats played to the middle-class fear of losing health_insurance . In introducing his bill Tuesday , Senate Majority_Leader George J . Mitchell ( D-Me. ) called it a matter of &quot; simple justice. &quot; He said , &quot; The difference between secure coverage and unaffordable policy can be as heartbreaking as one sick child . that ' s not fair or right . that ' s why we need reform. &quot; But Republicans discovered another middle-class concern -- that the federal_government will have too_much control over the nation ' s health-care system . Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) said the &quot; Clinton-Mitchell bill &quot; was based on &quot; the principle that government knows best. &quot; If the bill passed , Dole warned , &quot; the federal_government will have broad and sweeping new powers in almost every aspect of health care. &quot; Last week ' s poll tested those two fears . Which concerns Americans the most -- that Congress will pass a plan that gives the federal_government too_much control over health_care , or that Congress will pass a plan that fails to guarantee health_insurance for every American ? Bad news for Clinton . Too_much government was a bigger concern than too_little health_insurance , by 53 % -40 % . The public now sees comprehensive health-care reform as a typical Democratic social-welfare program -- one that helps the poor , hurts the middle_class and creates bigger government . What went_wrong ? Three things . First , the recession ended . The recovery hasn ' t been strong enough for anyone to call it a Clinton boom . But it has been strong enough for the middle-class panic over health_care to subside . That , plus the fact that health-care providers , fearful of reform , have begun to reorganize themselves . As a result , the rapid inflation of health_care has slowed considerably . Second , the Clinton_Administration displayed awesome political stupidity . It turned health-care reform over to a 500-person task_force of self-anointed experts , meeting for months in secret , chaired by a sinister liberal activist and a driven First_Lady . Who elected them ? They came_up with a 1 # 300-page document that could not have been_better designed to scare the wits out of Americans . It was the living embodiment of Big Government -- or Big Brother . &quot; What ' s in there ? &quot; people asked . The Health_Insurance Assn . of America introduced Harry and Louise to give us the answer . Now , of course , the Clinton plan has been abandoned . As it happens , the new and improved plan designed by Mitchell is 1 # 410 pages long . It makes quite a prop in the Senate floor debate . Watch Republican senators pick it up -- oof ! -- and wave it at the cameras . Third , the Administration made a serious miscalculation . It assumed it could sell health-care reform to the middle_class as the logical extension of Social_Security and Medicare -- &quot; the last unfinished_business of the New Deal. &quot; Opponents of health-care reform , Mitchell said Tuesday , &quot; will find themselves on the wrong side of history , just as the opponents of Social_Security did , just as the opponents of Medicare did . . . . Americans couldn ' t be persuaded to repeal Social_Security and Medicare by the same arguments now being made against health-care reform. &quot; &quot; I think you in the press ought to go_up and question some of these people about what their position is_on Medicare , &quot; Hillary Rodham Clinton said in an interview with reporters , &quot; and whether or not they believe mandatory payroll deductions to finance health_care for Americans over 65 is socialized medicine . Because of course it isn ' t. &quot; But the analogy doesn ' t hold . For one thing , the biggest single change in American political attitudes since the 1960s has been the collapse of confidence in government . In the 1930s , when Social_Security was passed , desperate Americans believed the federal_government could save them . It did . In the 1960s , when Medicare and civil_rights were passed , old people and black people believed the federal_government could protect them . It did . But in the 1990s , Americans are not so sure about either of these things . Middle-class Americans are no longer convinced that the federal_government is_on their side . There ' s another reason why the analogy doesn ' t hold . When Social_Security came_up in the 1930s , most people didn ' t have old-age_insurance . Pension_plans were meager or nonexistent . Most of the elderly had to rely_on the tender mercies of their relatives . Social_Security gave them something they didn ' t have . When Medicare came_up in the 1960s , most old people didn ' t have adequate health_insurance . Americans get their health_insurance through employment , after all , and the vast majority of the elderly are not employed . The elderly , who have the greatest need for health_care , faced prohibitive costs . Medicare gave them something they didn ' t have . But the vast majority of middle-class Americans today do have health_insurance . And they say they are satisfied with both the quality of their health_care and the quality of their health_insurance . So what are they worried about ? Well , they ' re worried about losing their health_insurance if they lose their job . And they ' re worried about being able to afford it if the rates go_up . Those are the problems they want health-care reform to fix . They are limited , specific problems . They see the Administration ' s health-care plan as doing far more_than that . It aims to reorganize the whole health-care system so that the government will give them something they already have , namely , health_insurance . People ' s biggest fear about the Administration ' s health-care plan is that it will take what they already have and make_it worse . Members of Congress report that they have been getting more calls and letters from constituents who ask , &quot; What ' s going_to happen to me if this bill passes ? &quot; than from people who ask , &quot; What ' s going_to happen to me if this bill doesn ' t pass ? &quot; Last week ' s poll puts that issue to the test . &quot; Thinking_about just your own health-care situation , &quot; the poll asked , &quot; which worries you more -- that you could end_up without health_insurance if Congress doesn ' t pass a bill , or that you could end_up worse off than you are now if Congress does pass a bill ? &quot; By a solid margin , 54 % -30 % , people are more worried about what will happen to them if health-care reform passes . that ' s exactly why the President ' s plan is in serious trouble . The Administration assumes that middle-class people are driven by the fear of not getting the additional security they want . But there is another , much larger fear driving them . That is the fear of losing the security they already have. *</TEXT>
