   <HEADLINE> MEXICO OKS KEY REBEL DEMAND ; LATIN_AMERICA : PRESIDENT ZEDILLO AGREES TO ACCEPT THE PANEL HEADED BY CONTROVERSIAL BISHOP AS MEDIATOR . FASTING CLERIC HAILS MOVE AS A ' STAR OF PEACE ' ON CHIAPAS HORIZON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a Christmas_Eve announcement that analysts called a potential breakthrough toward a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Chiapas , President Ernesto Zedillo ' s government made a major concession Saturday to the rebels in Mexico ' s southernmost state , the Zapatista National Liberation Army . Zedillo ' s Cabinet said it would accept a commission headed by a controversial Roman_Catholic bishop , Samuel Ruiz of San Cristobal de las Casas , to be the official mediator between the government and the rebels . Designating the National Intermediation Commission as chief negotiator was among the key demands of Zapatista leader Subcommander Marcos when he launched a renewed insurrection against the government last week . With the Mexican army and the armed Indian insurgents at a standoff in the jungles of Chiapas , the uprising has wreaked havoc on the Mexican economy and spread uncertainty nationwide . There was no immediate reaction to the announcement from Marcos , who remains in the rebels ' remote stronghold within a rain_forest near the Guatemalan border . But Ruiz , a rebel sympathizer who has been_on a hunger_strike since the Zapatistas ' second major mobilization began seven days ago , underscored the importance of the government ' s decision . &quot; The star of peace has appeared on the horizon in Chiapas , &quot; the tired and weakened 70-year-old declared as he met with a key deputy of Zedillo ' s interior secretariat at his cathedral Saturday . Also at the meeting with Deputy Secretary Beatriz Peredes was Chiapas opposition leader Amado Avendano , a former gubernatorial candidate who heads a parallel , self-declared &quot; Government in Rebellion &quot; in the state . It remained unclear after the meeting whether Ruiz himself would be permitted to negotiate or whether his ecumenical commission would designate another member to attempt to renew contacts with the Zapatistas . Talking to reporters before the Saturday meeting , though , the bishop seemed to indicate that recognizing his commission as mediator was breakthrough enough . &quot; I cannot hide the happiness that we have for this news of the day , &quot; he said . &quot; I assume we would be able to re-establish contact immediately with both parties. &quot; The initial decision by Interior_Secretary Esteban Moctezuma Barragan late Friday night to accept Ruiz ' s commission as chief negotiator with the Zapatistas was not likely to have been easy . The bishop is seen by many as a Zapatista partisan . He has expressed support for the rebels ' demands but condemned their use of violence after they launched a New Year ' s Day shooting war with the Mexican army to support their demand for equal treatment for indigenous Mexicans , constitutional and democratic reforms , and an end to rule by the rich . At least 145 people died in 12 days of fighting nearly a year ago . * When the Zapatista fighters remobilized during a one-day insurrection in the northern part of the state last Monday , they rekindled fears of more violence to come . Those fears triggered an economic panic that ultimately led the government to take the drastic measure of devaluing the peso by more_than 20 % in a single day . Publicly conceding for the first time that the Mexican nation is in political and economic_crisis , Zedillo indicated to reporters Friday that all sectors of Mexican society need to make deep concessions to defuse the crisis . The same day , the state interior_secretary of Chiapas , Eraclio Zepeda Ramos , conceded , &quot; The danger of war is present ( in the state ) . &quot; &quot; We are living through a crisis , and we must accept it as such , &quot; the president said during a brief chat with the press in Mexico_City just 23 days into his six-year term . &quot; The year 1995 will be a very complicated one . We must aim to try to overcome this economic and political crisis. &quot; Although the president has stood_fast behind a unilateral cease-fire with the rebels and a commitment to negotiate with them , he had proposed a seven-member legislative peace commission to resolve the conflict . The commission included five opposition members , but not Ruiz or his commission . Speaking_to federal legislators Thursday night , Zedillo appeared to back_off from his original proposal . He told a congressional committee that either Interior_Secretary Moctezuma , one of his most trusted aides and a young , progressive member of his Cabinet , or one of Moctezuma ' s deputies , would represent the government in any peace talks with the rebel leader . Marcos , who declared an end to the 11-month truce with the army after Chiapas ' ruling party governor , Eduardo Robledo Rincon , was inaugurated amid allegations of election_fraud on Dec . 1 , flatly rejected Zedillo ' s proposed commission a week ago . * During a jungle press_conference called to announce the Zapatista mobilization early Monday morning , Marcos issued two key demands for reopening peace talks . The first was that Bishop Ruiz mediate in the talks . The second was that Robledo resign , which the governor has promised to do if the Zapatistas lay_down their weapons . There was widespread speculation in Chiapas on Saturday after Deputy Secretary Peredes met with Ruiz and Avendano , Robledo ' s chief opponent in last August ' s gubernatorial election , that the government was considering addressing the rebels ' second demand as well . But Peredes , who emerged from the meeting with a broad smile , gave no other indication of the meeting ' s outcome .</TEXT>
