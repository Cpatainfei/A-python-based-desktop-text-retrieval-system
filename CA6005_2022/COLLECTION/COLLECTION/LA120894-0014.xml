   <TEXT> Building a movie_theater is a lot like producing a film . There are swarms of people involved , it costs an unimaginable amount_of_money , and the product is finished just in the nick of time . Deadlines have been very much on the minds of the people working_at the county ' s newest movie_theater , the Edwards Camarillo Palace 12 . There was plenty to do within the 12-screen multiplex . One week ago the seats weren ' t even installed in any of the theaters . The 80-foot-long concession stand was a dissembled jumble of stainless_steel , and the enormous lobby that owner Edwards Cinemas is so proud_of looked_like a warehouse . To make the deadline for the VIP opening today and the public opening Friday , crews have been working around the clock all week . &quot; It ' s a race , but every opening I worked_on was like this , &quot; said Kurt Macfarlane , director of engineering for Edwards . &quot; We always make_it in time. &quot; The huge 56 # 000-square-foot facility located on the south_side of the Ventura Freeway between Las Posas Road and Carmen Drive looks good even half assembled . Large curved vinyl screens stretch from wall to wall_in each theater , and projection units have big burly sound_systems . &quot; Each one of these booths cost $ 560 # 000 , &quot; Macfarlane said . &quot; that ' s just for projection and sound . Every one has a couple kinds of digital stereo , DTS and SRD . that ' s the Dolby system . We ' re negotiating with Sony to include their digital system also. &quot; The selection of films the cinema will show is something the bookers for Edwards are going_to experiment with , according to Michael Tiemeyer , director of operations . &quot; Of course we ' re going to have the first runs and regular releases , &quot; he said . &quot; But it ' s up_to the community as_to what they want . If they support art films , we ' ll do_it . We ' ve got a theater in Orange County that shows only art films. &quot; The selection of films should be pretty orthodox through the holiday and into the summer season . that ' s when the United Artist theater is scheduled to open , also in Camarillo . Two theaters in the same town means they will be competing for prints of the dozen or so major motion_pictures Hollywood has in release at any given time . &quot; When UA opens , it will become more of a horse_race , &quot; Tiemeyer said . The offerings might become a little more non-traditional . &quot; Until then we ' ll have mostly major releases. &quot;</TEXT>
