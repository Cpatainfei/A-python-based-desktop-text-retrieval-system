   <HEADLINE> U.N. COMMANDER FURIOUS AT ATTACK BY BOSNIA TROOPS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bosnian government soldiers attacked U.N. peacekeepers with machine_guns , grenades and remote-controlled mines Monday , provoking a furious response from the U.N. commander . No casualties were reported , but the attacks on Mt . Igman , overlooking Sarajevo , worsened the U.N. force ' s already strained relations with the Muslim-led government . After a harsh protest from Lt . Gen . Michael Rose , the peacekeeping commander for Bosnia , Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic said he would order his troops to &quot; desist_from this sort of firing , &quot; a U.N. spokesman said . Rose called the attacks &quot; exceptionally dangerous and potentially catastrophic , &quot; said the spokesman , Lt . Col . Tim Spicer . The attacks occurred as Bosnian troops reluctantly began withdrawing Monday afternoon from a U.N.-patrolled demilitarized zone . Spicer said a French army bulldozer was targeted with machine-gun fire and a rocket-propelled grenade . French soldiers in a nearby armored personnel_carrier returned fire with a heavy machine_gun , he said . The Bosnians then detonated two remote-controlled mines in the path of a French platoon coming_to support the soldiers , Spicer said . &quot; As a result , President Izetbegovic will issue the orders to his commanders to desist_from this sort of firing and to comply fully with already agreed-to decision to withdraw from the DMZ , &quot; Spicer said . Spicer said it was the worst Bosnian attack on peacekeepers near Sarajevo in months . U.N. officials had demanded the withdrawal of an estimated 500 Bosnian troops , whose presence in the demilitarized zone was jeopardizing a local cease-fire with the Bosnian Serbs . Under heavy pressure from the United Nations , about 100 government troops in the zone destroyed their bunkers and trenches and began withdrawing about noon . At the same time , the Serbs accused government forces of a new provocation : firing on a military_vehicle in the zone and killing 11 Serb soldiers . The Bosnian Serb news_agency SRNA called the attack Sunday &quot; brutal , unprovoked and double-crossing conduct of Muslim extremists. &quot; The United Nations also criticized the Serbs for continuing Monday to block U.N. fuel convoys despite a promise to let them pass .</TEXT>
