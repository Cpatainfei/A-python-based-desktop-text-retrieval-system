   <HEADLINE> ABSTINENCE STATEMENT CRITICIZED AS ANTI-GAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mayor Sandra L . Genis has declared this week Abstinence Week in Costa Mesa , an official reminder that the only foolproof way to avoid getting AIDS through sex is not to have_sex . Health educators generally welcomed the declaration , but said sexual abstinence cannot be encouraged as the only defense against pregnancy and disease . They also berated as inflammatory a statement that was issued by Abstinence Week organizers . &quot; The red ' AIDS ' ribbon is a lie , &quot; read a statement distributed by the group . &quot; It promotes a lifestyle and education that allows sex with a condom. &quot; The statement , with a white ribbon pinned to one side , was distributed last week at the City_Council meeting where the mayor made her declaration . The text also attacked the reliability of condoms and added , &quot; the red ' AIDS ' ribbon is stained with blood , blood that could be infected and kill me. &quot; Abstinence Week is not a week without sex , but a time for people to reflect on the benefits of delaying sexual_activity until marriage , according to organizer Barbara Whitacre . &quot; We need to give support to our teens who want to be abstinent. &quot; Genis made the declaration , which covers the week that began Sunday , at Whitacre ' s request . &quot; I thought it was a worthwhile thing to declare , &quot; Genis said . &quot; Heaven knows it ' s the only foolproof thing we ' ve got against some of these things. &quot; Costa Mesa is the only city in the county to declare Abstinence Week . The council has traditionally given the mayor authority to make such pronouncements . But after questions were raised about the organizers ' statement , the mayor was quick to distance herself from its specifics and noted that it was not part of the official declaration . &quot; I didn ' t write the thing , and I just kind of glanced at it , &quot; she said . &quot; That is not an official city statement. &quot; And after learning that some critics considered the statement anti-gay , the organizers revised it to eliminate references_to the red ribbon , which has become an international symbol of the fight against AIDS . Organizers say they hope Abstinence Week will be recognized by other cities as well . Whitacre said the idea came_to her during a conversation with friends at a meeting at Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa . Whitacre gave a brief speech in favor of abstinence at the Feb . 22 council meeting and passed_out the white-ribboned statements . &quot; I think it ' s anti-gay , &quot; said David Martin , president of the California Assn . of AIDS Agencies , a statewide organization that provides assistance to local health educators . &quot; I don ' t view that ( red ) ribbon as an endorsement of activities that would lead to HIV infection. &quot; After learning of Martin ' s comments , Clark Emerson , an Orange resident who wrote the statement , discarded the roughly 900 flyers he had prepared . &quot; I was not trying to offend any individuals , &quot; he said . &quot; I was trying to make_a_point about an idea. &quot; He wrote a new statement focusing_on the risks of condoms and the benefits of abstinence . To teach a young_person to depend_on condoms , which no one believes are 100 % effective at preventing HIV transmission , is wrong and deadly , Emerson said . But Martin said he wonders why the council endorsed Abstinence Week after Whitacre presented such an offensive statement . &quot; I think it speaks_to a lack of awareness on the part of the mayor and City_Council , &quot; he said . Several council_members said they first saw the white ribbons and statements on their chairs when the Feb . 22 meeting began . Genis acknowledged that she spoke with Whitacre about Abstinence Week several days before the meeting , but said she had not carefully read the short statement . &quot; I don ' t think it is anti-gay , &quot; Genis said after reviewing the statement . &quot; If people choose to take things personally , then that ' s their prerogative. &quot; Council_member Mary Hornbuckle , who also did not read the whole statement before the meeting began , said she wished the council had talked_about it beforehand . &quot; I would have found that offensive , &quot; she said of the statement , &quot; simply because this is a personal decision. &quot; Hornbuckle said she is concerned about the appearance of a council endorsement for the statement . &quot; I suspect it ' s an area that government doesn ' t have a lot of business in , &quot; she said . &quot; It probably should be a decision made by the whole council. &quot; In November , Genis was criticized by local arts officials after she refused to issue a written proclamation of A Day Without Art as part of a worldwide observance of the toll AIDS has taken . Genis did verbally declare the day , in the same way she declared Abstinence Week . She said she reserves written proclamations for residents or local organizations deserving of recognition for special achievements . Several county health educators interviewed by The Times said they approved of Abstinence Week , but all emphasized that abstinence should be presented along with condom education and other safer-sex lessons . &quot; If people are having_sex , it ' s hard to get them to stop , &quot; said Jack Herzberg , program director for the AIDS Response Program , the oldest AIDS-education organization in the county . &quot; I don ' t think that promoting abstinence as the only alternative is reasonable . &quot; We always present abstinence as an option , &quot; Herzberg said . &quot; And for people who choose to be sexually active , they need to know how to keep themselves safe. &quot; Emerson , Whitacre and others criticize health educators who talk_of abstinence and also give a frank discussion of condoms and other birth_control . &quot; I believe that when you mix the message like that , it discredits the choice for abstinence , &quot; said Priscilla Hurley , director of Choices / Teen Awareness Inc. , a non-sectarian Anaheim group that has taught abstinence classes in North County school districts . &quot; Many of them hear that waiting is a good idea , but if you can ' t wait , use a condom , &quot; Hurley said of students . &quot; But when I ask them what that communicates , 90 % of them respond that that gives them permission. &quot; Hurley says her group steers clear of religious messages when it teaches young people how to maintain abstinence . Whitacre said Abstinence Week also has no religious agenda . &quot; To me it ' s not a religious issue ; it ' s a health issue , &quot; she said . &quot; More and more of the programs are looking_at the benefits of delaying sexual_activity , &quot; Penny Weismuller , county manger for disease control , said . But she stressed that &quot; abstinence is a part of a total message that recognizes what ' s going_on with young people . You don ' t just present either side of the message. &quot;</TEXT>
