   <HEADLINE> EX-JUSTICE OFFICIAL ASSAILS SENATE ' S HARD-LINE CRIME BILL ; LEGISLATION : THE DEPARTMENT ' S FORMER NO . 2 MAN TAKES_AIM AT MANY OF THE GET-TOUGH PROPOSALS AS WASTEFUL , ILL-CONCEIVED AND DOOMED TO FAILURE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The former No . 2 official at the Justice_Department on Tuesday condemned many hard-line provisions of the Senate crime bill as exceedingly wasteful and doomed to failure . &quot; Politics have overwhelmed reason , &quot; Philip B . Heymann , who left_office Monday as deputy attorney_general , said in remarks unusually abrupt for a recently departed high Administration official . &quot; Somebody has to be frank about this , &quot; Heymann said . &quot; Somebody has to talk. &quot; Heymann , whose sharp criticism of the crime bill contrasts with some public statements coming from the White_House , announced his resignation last month , citing differences of &quot; chemistry &quot; and &quot; operational and management styles &quot; between him and Atty . Gen . Janet Reno . &quot; It ' s very hard to make truth or common_sense or frankness work_on this issue ever -- let alone now , &quot; said Heymann , who headed a criminal_law center at Harvard_University and ran the Justice_Department ' s criminal division during the Jimmy_Carter Administration . Public_opinion_polls have shown that crime and violence , driven by reports of sensational crimes , have supplanted the economy as the leading concern of Americans today . Offering a briefcase bulging with studies and data to support his arguments , Heymann took_aim at such highly popular provisions of the Senate crime bill as the three-strikes-and-you ' re-out provision , which would sentence criminals to life without possibility of parole after their third violent offense , and the construction of regional federal prisons for violent offenders . He also criticized provisions that would expand the use of mandatory minimum sentences and federalize many state and local crimes . But in a meeting with reporters , Heymann declined to discuss what happened when he raised such arguments at the Justice_Department or the White_House before his resignation . In announcing his departure last month , Heymann said there were no &quot; philosophical differences &quot; between him and Reno and &quot; no precipitating episode ( or ) disagreement on some particular matter. &quot; Heymann said Tuesday that he had told Reno , Acting Deputy Atty . Gen . Jo Ann Harris and Associate Atty . Gen . Webster Hubbell that he was going discuss his opposition to the crime bill and &quot; none objected in any way. &quot; The three-strikes proposal , which has been embraced by President Clinton in concept , is so broad that it includes &quot; everything in_sight , &quot; Heymann said . For instance , he said , under the legislation a 25-year-old violator convicted of three armed_robberies would have to serve 30 years more_than the 25-year sentence he would otherwise likely receive . &quot; Those last 30 years -- from age 50 to 80 -- he would be very unlikely to commit a street robbery , &quot; Heymann said . &quot; We don ' t have very many 50-year-old robbers. &quot; The cost of imprisoning the convict would be $ 20 # 000 to $ 30 # 000 a year for each of the 30 years , Heymann said , enough to cover the health_care costs of 150 families for a single year . Taking_aim at the proposed expansion of mandatory minimum sentences , Heymann cited the findings of a Justice_Department study of mandatory sentences given_out under existing federal law . The study found that 21 % of federal prisoners serving mandatory minimum terms had no prior violations and played no significant role in any drug organization , yet had drawn longer sentences than criminals who committed very violent acts . &quot; My point is that we are filling federal prisons with people who are not particularly dangerous , &quot; said Heymann , who has noted that release of the study has been held_up at the request of presidential counselor David Gergen . Heymann also criticized provisions of the bill calling_for construction of federal regional prisons to house state prisoners who commit violent offenses . Under the bill , taxpayers would pay $ 2.5 billion to build the 25 # 000 cells -- a cost of $ 100 # 000 a cell . The money would be spent , he said , even though half of the 800 # 000 to 900 # 000 prisoners now in state penitentiaries are serving time for nonviolent crimes . On provisions of the bill that would turn state offenses into federal crimes , Heymann noted that the number of federal_agents to investigate crimes is slightly declining -- not increasing to handle a broader jurisdiction . &quot; It sounds so terrific , &quot; he said with obvious sarcasm . Although Heymann refused to discuss how government officials dealt with his criticisms , he did say the Administration ' s strategy had been to support the Senate and House leaders on an issue that mushroomed late last year . &quot; What happened was that in many ways the issue overtook us , &quot; he said . Heymann repeatedly emphasized that he was not making light of the crime problem . &quot; I don ' t think we have a bigger scandal than that . In many places , Americans can ' t live without a grave risk of violence , &quot; he said . The U.S. rate of violence is five to six times that of other Western countries , he noted . As evidence of_his_own support for tough steps to counter violence , Heymann said he advocated keeping certain violent criminals behind bars until &quot; they ' re reasonably safe , &quot; cracking_down on guns on the street even if such efforts tread_on privacy rights , and forfeiting the cars of young people found to contain guns . Carl Stern , Reno ' s chief spokesman , brushed_aside the suggestion that Heymann ' s comments revealed an Administration rift over the crime issue . &quot; There ' s a lively discussion inside the ( Justice ) department , as there has been elsewhere as_to the content &quot; of the crime bill , Stern said . &quot; The precise content is still being formulated . . . . We ' re certainly discussing the kinds of concerns Phil has raised. &quot;</TEXT>
