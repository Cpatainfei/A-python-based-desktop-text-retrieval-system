   <HEADLINE> WITNESS SAYS BECKWITH WAS INTRODUCED AS EVERS ' KILLER ; COURT : SUSPECT ON_TRIAL FOR THE THIRD TIME IN THE 1963 SLAYING PURPORTEDLY REFERRED TO THE BLACK CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER AS A ' CHICKEN-STEALING DOG. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mary Ann Adams told jurors Monday how Byron De La Beckwith was introduced to her as &quot; the man who killed Medgar Evers , &quot; the civil_rights leader shot to death three decades ago . After the bookkeeper refused to shake his hand , Beckwith told her &quot; he had not killed a man , &quot; Adams testified Monday , &quot; but a damn chicken-stealing dog -- and you know what you have to do when a dog has tasted blood. &quot; For the first time in the historic retrial of Beckwith , 73 , the jury of eight blacks and four whites heard witnesses describe how Beckwith boasted enigmatically of killing Evers , the former field secretary of the NAACP . The jurors also listened to Beckwith ' s nephew , Reed Massengill , describe his uncle ' s virulent brand of racism , his joy at President John F . Kennedy ' s killing and his suspicion that adding fluoride to drinking_water was a plot by Jews to make the populace more &quot; docile. &quot; Two juries of white_men failed to reach a verdict when Beckwith stood trial for the Evers killing in 1964 , but prosecutors here succeeded in reopening the case after new witnesses came_forward telling tales of Beckwith ' s veiled admissions of the crime and his presence in Jackson the night Evers was shot outside his home . Beckwith , however , has steadfastly stated that he was 90 miles away in Greenwood the night Evers was killed , and two retired Greenwood police_officers are expected to take_the_stand again and swear that Beckwith was there when Evers was murdered . Previous testimony has shown that Beckwith ' s 1917 Enfield rifle with one of his fingerprints was found outside Evers ' home , and a parade of FBI_agents -- active and retired -- have testified that the bullet shot at Evers , now lost , was probably from the rifle . Beckwith has stated that his rifle was stolen before the slaying .</TEXT>
