   <HEADLINE> THE CUTTING_EDGE : COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION ; DARWINIAN SOFTWARE BEING TESTED AS SURVIVAL AID IN INVESTMENT JUNGLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stocks , bonds or Treasury_bills ? Charles_Darwin ' s theory_of_evolution -- of all things -- might just have some answers to this perennial investment question . Investment managers are experimenting with computer software that runs investment possibilities through a simulation of natural_selection , complete with mutation , crossover and that all-time favorite , survival of the fittest . The software uses a set of mathematical techniques known as genetic algorithms . Long employed in computer_science and the development of artificial_intelligence for military applications , they have only recently begun to trickle into the world of finance . &quot; It ' s bizarre-sounding stuff , &quot; admits Richard Bauer Jr. , a professor of business administration at St . Mary ' s University in San Antonio , whose recently published &quot; Genetic Algorithms and Investment Strategies &quot; is the first book on the subject . &quot; But the power of being able to search huge numbers of trading possibilities in an efficient manner is mind-boggling. &quot; The interest in genetic algorithms comes as Wall_Street professionals are relying more and more on computers ' processing power to develop market-beating investment strategies and new types of financial products . Many of these high-tech money management techniques carry big risks -- just ask Procter &amp; Gamble , Bankers Trust and others that have lost hundreds of millions of dollars on computer-generated &quot; derivatives &quot; instruments . But there may be big rewards too . First Quadrant Corp. , a Pasadena-based investment_firm , was one of the first to apply the computerized Darwinism , using the software to develop investment models for the approximately $ 5 billion in funds it manages . David Leinweber , the firm ' s director_of_research , says genetic algorithms have made his clients an additional $ 25 million since he started incorporating them into his investment modeling strategy over the last year -- an incremental return of 0.5 % . He estimates the algorithms have increased the predictive power of his model by 50 % . &quot; The genetic algorithm starts with your ideas and expands upon them and combines them in ways that produce investment forecasting models which are better than what we started with , &quot; he says . A former Rand Corp . scientist , Leinweber became interested in applying the algorithm software to finance when he was working_at an artificial_intelligence company in the early 1980s : &quot; People started showing_up from Salomon Bros . wanting to know what all this AI ( artificial_intelligence ) stuff was about . They bought a ton of our software , &quot; he recalls . A typical use of the genetic algorithm might involve developing rules for building an investment portfolio . A series of different rules -- such_as one designating all stocks with a price-earnings ratio of less than 15 , or one picking stocks with an earnings growth of more_than 40 % over a given period -- are fed into the computer and played against each other in a first round of &quot; natural_selection , &quot; based on historical data . Like successful genes in nature , the rules that do_well in the first round gain greater_power and influence in the second round . Then there is the mutation process , in which some rules are randomly zapped to diversify the population . &quot; Crossover , &quot; the biological_process in which a pair of chromosomes come_together and then break_apart , each taking_part of the other , is also replicated in the program -- a process that aims to create new and better combinations . Eventually , the population converges , leaving one rule that -- if all has gone well -- will be the single best rule of the millions of computer-generated possibilities . Darwinian selection might take millions of years , but the genetic algorithms can be played_out in a_few hours on a powerful personal_computer . Fast PCs and low-cost computer workstations are now being used to try_out a wide variety of esoteric investment strategies based on computer_science concepts such_as neural networks , chaos theory and expert systems . The genetic algorithms have yet to be widely tested as an investment tool . But as_to why and whether they work , Bauer takes the cosmic view : &quot; that ' s almost a fundamental question of life there , &quot; he muses . &quot; To say why does the whole process of evolution seem to work as well as it does -- I don ' t know . It ' s really just a mathematical technique for finding solutions to large , complex problems . And whether it ' s an investment problem or an engineering problem or species evolution doesn ' t really seem to matter. &quot;</TEXT>
