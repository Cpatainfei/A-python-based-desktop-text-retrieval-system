   <HEADLINE> HOLIDAYS ; MALLS MAKE TIMELY COMEBACK ; MANY STORES HAVE COMPLETED QUAKE RECOVERY WORK TO REOPEN IN ADVANCE OF THE HOLIDAY SEASON .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> If you haven ' t shopped much since last holiday season , you might be surprised at what you find -- or don ' t find -- at area malls . The Jan . 17 earthquake took its toll , and some malls , most notably Northridge Fashion Center , are still recovering . Some have opened new stores in record numbers and still others in recent weeks have bulldozed through construction deadlines , reopening damaged anchor stores . Northridge Fashion Center , considered by many as ground zero for the disaster , still has 200 stores closed , but The Broadway and Sears stores reopened earlier this month . Seven other businesses on the mall ' s periphery have been open since soon after the quake : Fidelity Federal , Coco ' s , Just Tires , Bank of America , Great Western Savings , Pizzeria Uno and Sears Auto Center . The Bullock ' s store is expected to open in August . &quot; The rest of the mall is scheduled to have a grand reopening on March 15 , &quot; General_Manager Lloyd Miller says . &quot; We ' ve been putting_in seismic-upgraded columns and foundations and new skylights that run the entire length of the mall. &quot; The mall ' s parking structures will open next year , beginning with the south structure in January , the east in March and the west in June . There is no opening date scheduled for the north structure . While sales have plummeted at Northridge Fashion Center , other area malls , especially those farther away from the epicenter , have picked_up the slack . &quot; Sales are up anywhere from 20 % to 55 % over last year , &quot; reports Louise Marquez , marketing director of Panorama Mall in Van Nuys . Woodland Hill ' s Promenade reports a 25 % increase in sales in the same period . Panorama Mall in Van Nuys was fully operable a day after the earthquake , except for The Broadway , which reopened in May . New stores added since the quake include GTE Phone Mart ; Just for Kids , a children ' s used-clothing store ; Town Style , a men ' s clothing_store , and the Sunglass Source . At The Promenade , the Saks Fifth_Avenue store closed and is being replaced by the AMC Promenade 16 Theaters , due_to open in October . New stores include Bath and Body , a women ' s toiletry shop , and Favoritz restaurant , which serves Continental cuisine and opened earlier this month . Management at all area malls hope for increased buying in December , citing a healthier economy and extra cash now that many residents ' disaster aid checks have arrived . To accommodate and lure shoppers , some malls have taken the opportunity to rearrange or expand stores after the quake did its own remodeling . At Topanga Plaza , the Robinsons-May , for example , reopened Nov . 10 with expanded housewares , consumer electronics and furniture departments . &quot; It ' s brand-new , inside and out , &quot; says Annette Bethers , marketing director . Also , Montgomery Ward reopened in September , and Mrs . Fields Cookies reopened earlier this month . New stores include the Museum Company , which sells museum reproductions ; Bare Escentuals , a skin and bath shop ; Enzo Angiolini , a women ' s shoe_shop ; Bostonian , a men ' s clothing_store , and a women ' s accessories shop called the Landau Collection . Two other stores are slated to open before January -- Starbucks Coffee and Rampage , a women ' s fashion store . What ' s missing at Topanga Plaza ? Pastille , a women ' s clothing_store , and Stride Rite Shoes have both closed during the past year . The two Robinsons-May stores that reopened in July at Sherman Oaks Galleria were also updated , and merchandise has been rearranged . Men ' s apparel and home furnishings are found in one store and women ' s apparel is sold at the other . All other stores opened 11 days after the quake . Ninety percent of the 140 shops_at Sherman Oaks Fashion Square will be open by Christmas . The Bullock ' s store reopened completely in October , after temporarily occupying the former I . Magnin store that closed before the quake . The Broadway reopened some of its departments in late June and was back in_full_swing by September . The heavily damaged parking structure , which reopened in stages , became fully operable Nov . 1 . The square ' s sales have been down about 30 % , Vice_President Brian Pickering says , &quot; but we expect a great Christmas. &quot; Reopened stores are too numerous to list , but brand-new shops include three women ' s fashion stores -- Rampage , Susie Tompkins and 818 Freight -- and a girls ' clothing_store called Friends . Benetton , Guess and Ann Taylor have opened and The Gap plans to before Christmas . After the New Year , look_for the grand opening of Banana Republic and the Body Shop , a skin_care and bath shop . Bebe , high-end women ' s fashions , and Baby Guess will both expand operations after Jan . 1 . Here ' s the shopping status at other area malls : * The Fallbrook Mall will open three new anchor stores -- Ralphs grocery_store , K mart and Burlington Coat Factory , selling men ' s and women ' s apparel , by the summer . ( The Ralphs across the street at Fallbrook Avenue and Victory Boulevard will close. ) The now-vacated Sears will soon open an outlet store in the vacant Builders Emporium space across the street on Victory . New stores include Famous Footwear , a family shoe_store . Mall management is negotiating with a number of restaurants . Stores that closed include Clothestime , Jarman Shoes and Nintendo video_games . * At Glendale Galleria , 264 shops and five department_stores opened the day after the quake , but the west parking structure suffered moderate damage .
