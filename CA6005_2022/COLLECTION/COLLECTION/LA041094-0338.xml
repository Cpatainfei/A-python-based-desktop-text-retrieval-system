   <HEADLINE> HOURS AFTER SHUTTLE LAUNCH , VITAL RADAR TEST HITS SNAG</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of the prime experiments on the shuttle Endeavour ' s Earth-monitoring mission ran_into trouble Saturday just hours after the craft ' s dawn liftoff . A high-power amplifier for one of two radar instruments aboard Endeavour would n ' t work , and researchers had to pass_up viewing opportunities.Ground controllers spent several hours struggling with the problem before activating the amplifier in a manual mode . The amplifier is vital because it powers the radar ' s antenna . Mission Control told the crew that the flight would be extended from nine to 10 days , thanks to their efforts at power conservation . Engineers continued to study the amplifier trouble and late Saturday night , after numerous tests , began scanning Earth with the radar . While that radar was down , the other radar took its first images as Endeavour flew over Michigan ' s Upper Peninsula . The equipment is supposed to be the most advanced space radar ever built for civilian use . The mission is meant to provide the most extensive monitoring of Earth ' s environment ever made from orbit . The main purpose of the mission is to see how well the radar works . Scientists will compare the radar images of Earth to thousands of photographs to be taken by the six astronauts and the results of on-the-spot surveys by research teams . After two launch delays last week , the 4.5-million-pound shuttle thundered from its seaside pad right on_time at 4:05 a.m. PDT .</TEXT>
