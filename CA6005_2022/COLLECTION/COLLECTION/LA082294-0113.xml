   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : FIGURING THE FUTURE OF TECH STOCKS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a symbol of investors ' rejuvenated interest in technology stocks , not much beats the hot streak of IBM Corp . shares_in recent weeks . The long-ailing computer giant ' s stock surged $ 1.875 on Friday to a 20-month high of $ 68.125 , helped by upbeat comments from two well-known Wall_Street analysts . Measured since the end of June , IBM ' s share price is now up 16 % . Many IBM buyers are focusing specifically on the prospect of faster computer sales growth overseas , as the economies of Europe and Japan pick_up speed . The summer rebound in tech shares generally , however , seems driven more by a realization that the vicious spring selloff in these stocks was overdone . In dumping tech issues during May and June , investors were responding to fears that sales and earnings would be victimized by a slower U.S. economy ( courtesy of the Federal_Reserve_Board ) . But in July , many or most tech companies ' second-quarter earnings_reports put those fears to rest . Just last week , electronics leader Hewlett-Packard and software producer Autodesk both reported results for their quarters ended July 31 , and the numbers were so surprisingly strong that Hewlett ' s stock immediately leaped 11 % and Autodesk ' s rocketed 17 % . The resurgence of tech shares overall this summer has already been powerful enough to lift a key tech-stock index back into positive territory for the year-to-date . The 200-stock tech index compiled by San Francisco brokerage Hambrecht &amp; Quist , which dove 13 % between the end of February and the end of June , now is up 3.6 % for the year . In contrast , the Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500 index of blue_chip stocks is down 0.6 % year-to-date . Beating the S &amp; P so far this year is a continuation of an important trend for tech investors : Despite hair-raising volatility in the stocks , the H &amp; Q index has posted bigger price gains than the S &amp; P every year since 1990 . That contrasts vividly with the 1986-89 period , when the H &amp; Q badly lagged the S &amp; P in three of four years . Yet tech stock bulls complain that Wall_Street still treats the computer_business as if the plug could be pulled_at any minute , without appreciating how large , how global and diverse an industry it has become . Although it ' s certainly true that the tremendous speed of technology product cycles means there is high risk in owning any single tech stock , the greater risk may be in failing to own a piece of a diversified tech portfolio in the ' 90s . Efficiency , after all , is what the world economy rewards most highly today , and efficiency is what technology promises . Here , three tech-stock veterans explain their optimism about the industry and where they see the greatest potential for investors : * Michael Murphy , editor , California Technology Stock Letter , Half Moon Bay , Calif . A bear_on the stock_market overall , Murphy is bullish on the tech sector for a simple reason , he says : &quot; Valuations on technology-driven companies are no higher than ' other ' companies , even though ( tech companies ' ) real growth_rates are three or more times as high. &quot; That disparity &quot; can ' t last , &quot; he says . Murphy believes Wall_Street is just beginning to realize the true value of tech companies ' franchises . Why now ? In large part , he says , it ' s because so many investors now are part of the tech revolution via personal_computers . Technology , Murphy says , &quot; has been demystified &quot; by its spread . So the old argument against investing in tech stocks -- &quot; Don ' t buy what you don ' t understand &quot; -- is no longer valid , he says . &quot; People have not only lost their fear of the unknown in technology , they are actively embracing it. &quot; More important , the global growth potential in computers and related equipment , telecommunications , biotechnology and other tech sectors remains spectacular , Murphy says . For example , whereas there are 150 million personal_computers in the world , he estimates that there are 250 million people who have the skills and income to buy a computer today but haven ' t yet done so . The semiconductor industry alone , Murphy says , will invest $ 100 billion in new plants and equipment over the next five years to meet the world ' s burgeoning demand for computer chips -- now standard equipment even in the lowliest household_appliances . Yet Intel Corp . -- the premier name in chips -- is a mere $ 63 stock . At that price , Murphy notes , it sells for just 11 times this year ' s estimated earnings per share . The S &amp; P 500 index , in contrast , is priced at 15 times estimated 1994 earnings . The point , Murphy says , is that tech stock prices as a group don ' t come_close to discounting the industry ' s future growth . That makes this a must-own business , he says . Besides Intel , his &quot; core &quot; tech holdings include disk-drive giant Seagate Technology , work-station maker Sun Microsystems , and Vitesse Semiconductor . * Roger McNamee , money manager , Integral Capital Partners , Menlo Park , Calif . Like Murphy , McNamee finds the still-depressed prices of many tech stocks quite at_odds with the companies ' outlook . The average computer company , McNamee says , does about half its business overseas . With the dollar weak ( thus lowering prices of U.S. goods abroad ) and Europe and Japan in recovery mode , the stage seems set for healthy growth in the near term , he says . But McNamee is less sanguine than Murphy that the market will begin treating tech stocks with due respect anytime soon . &quot; The profile of the average tech investor is a manic-depressive , &quot; McNamee says . The industry is bigger and more complex than ever before , but few money managers have time to dig deep into the fundamentals , he says . So when the market perceives a problem in any part of the business , the typical manager ' s reaction is to bail . McNamee figures that extreme volatility will remain a hallmark of tech stocks . The savvy investor must learn to use that to his or her advantage , buying the stocks when they periodically plunge , he says . But not just any tech issues . McNamee focuses_on the major product cycles in the business -- the innovations that generate massive new sales and create their own momentum . &quot; As an investor , that ' s where I want to be , &quot; he says . Microsoft Corp. ' s expected 1995 rollout of &quot; Chicago , &quot; the successor personal-computer software to the blockbuster Windows program , is perhaps the most exciting major product cycle_on the horizon , McNamee says . Microsoft itself is the obvious way to play that cycle , he says , but many other tech firms will also benefit as &quot; Chicago &quot; lures new computer buyers and encourages others to upgrade . McNamee likes Cirrus Logic , for example , as a chipmaker with strong franchises in computer_graphics and multimedia . Another major cycle underway , McNamee says , is the development of the infrastructure for wireless communications worldwide , and the shift in telecommunications from analog to digital . Motorola remains a key way to play this cycle , he says , along with Mobile Telecommunications Technologies , the leader in paging services . Finally , McNamee sees opportunity in the suppliers of equipment for interactive TV systems and other new wired communications networks . Alantec , a hot new designer of a telecom switching hubs , is one idea . * Paul Wick , manager , Seligman Communications &amp; Information stock mutual_fund , New York . As well as tech stocks have performed over the last few years , Wick ' s fund has done even better : up 55 % in 1991 , 17 % in ' 92 , 36 % in ' 93 and 10 % so far this year . He still is extremely enthusiastic about two tech sectors in particular : semiconductors and makers of machinery used by semiconductor producers . The rise of computer networking alone , Wick says , is fueling a heavy demand for chips that isn ' t likely to be sated soon . Among niche chip players , he likes Xilinx and Altera Corp. , both of which make high-density programmable logic chips . The idea there , Wick says , is that computer makers and other end_users of chips can buy blank , programmable chips from Xilinx and Altera instead of footing the bill for custom-designed chips . Wick also sees great potential in three major producers of memory_chips : Cypress Semiconductor , Alliance Semiconductor and Integrated Device Technology . As computers learn to do more and at ever-faster speeds , they naturally require more memory capacity , he notes . As the chip makers themselves expand , meanwhile , manufacturers of equipment used in chip factories also are booming . Applied Materials is one of the best-known equipment makers , but Wick favors some lesser-known firms , including FSI International , which he says has picked_up some large_orders in recent weeks . FSI is the kind of bargain Wick is most comfortable with : The firm should earn $ 1.35 a share next year , yet the stock ' s price is $ 15.50 , or about 11 times earnings . Indeed , despite tech stocks ' gains in the ' 90s , Wick says he still finds plenty of reasonably priced issues . 3Com Corp. , for example , is a low-cost computer networker &quot; that seems to be taking market share_in all areas , &quot; he says . At 24 times 1994 operating earnings per share , the stock must look undervalued to 3Com management , because the firm has been buying back shares , Wick says . Similarly , Parametric Technology , a leader in software used in mechanical design ( Ford Motor is a big customer ) &quot; is the most profitable public software company in the world , &quot; Wick says . But thanks to the spring plunge in tech shares , the stock -- now at $ 27.875 -- is priced at just 19 times estimated 1995 earnings , he says . Tech Stocks : Winner for the ' 90s ? An index of 200 technology stocks tracked by brokerage Hambrecht &amp; Quist was a poor performer for most of the late ' 80s . But since 1991 , tech stocks ' price appreciation has beaten that of the blue_chip Standard &amp; Poor ' s 500-stock index every year . Annual price changes : H &amp; Q tech index : 3.6 % S &amp; P 500 : -0.6 % Sources : Hambrecht &amp; Quist ; Standard &amp; Poor ' s How Tech Stocks Stack Up Some money managers maintain that leading tech stocks are priced too cheaply relative to their growth potential . Here are some major stocks , their estimated or actual fiscal 1994 operating earnings per share ( EPS ) , price-to-earnings ( P-E ) ratios and estimated annualized EPS growth_rates over the next five years . 06 # 19 , 15 # 08 , 09 # 05 , 12 1994 Fri .
