   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON BOSNIA ; A BALKANS PEACE THAT CANNOT LAST ; THE WEST-IMPOSED DIVISION IS UNWORKABLE AND UNJUST , AND WILL ENCOURAGE ULTRANATIONAL FORCES ELSEWHERE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For me as a Bosnian it has been sad to watch international mediators , including , it seems , the leaders of the G-7 nations , carve_up my homeland . The European Union ' s Lord David Owen and the U.N. ' s Thorvald Stoltenberg even sat with the self-proclaimed leader of the Bosnian Serbs , Radovan Karadzic ( who is neither a Bosnian nor a Serb , because he came from the mountainous Montenegrin region of Durmitor , nor even a leader , because he ran_for no public office in the first free elections in Bosnia in 1990 ) . In their discussions on a terrace overlooking the Drina River in the town of Zvornik , they proposed dividing Bosnia-Herzegovina , giving 51 % of its territory to the newly created Bosnian-Croat federation and 49 % to Serbian forces . This plan has since been ratified by the Western powers . There are few towns that symbolize all_the weaknesses of this formula for division as strongly as Zvornik . It was one of the first Bosnian towns stormed by the Serbian paramilitary forces , supported by the Yugoslav Army , in their genocidal campaign of &quot; ethnic cleansing &quot; in April , 1992 . The Muslim majority was either expelled or killed , including correspondent Kjasif Smajlovic , who was executed while writing in his office for my paper , the Bosnian Independent Daily ( Oslobodjenje ) . He was the first journalist killed in the war in Bosnia . Thus Zvornik became an almost ethnically &quot; pure &quot; Serbian town . And there , now , in Zvornik sat the European and U.N. mediators with the person most responsible_for this and so many other crimes , discussing ways to legalize the Serbs ' violation of all_the norms upon which the &quot; new_world order &quot; was supposed to rest . Look again at Zvornik to see one of the best examples why this latest design to divide Bosnia is not only legally and morally wrong in rewarding aggression and &quot; ethnic cleansing , &quot; but also unworkable . Even if Karadzic and his Serbian boss , Slobodan Milosevic , agree to the proposed formula , how can they tell their followers , who they moved to other people ' s towns , homes and property , to leave ? There are tens of thousands of Serbs who now occupy other people ' s homes_in the Serbian-occupied parts of Bosnia , who would be required to leave if Serbian conquests were reduced from more_than 70 % to 49 % of Bosnian territory . Many of those Serbs committed unspeakable crimes , killing thousands of innocent civilians and expelling almost the whole Muslim population , including my mother , Sena , and my good old stepfather , Kemal Kolonic . They had to leave their home_in Prijedor , their family house and land and their newly bought Ford Fiesta , and also pay 2 # 000 German marks each just for a Serbian ausweiss -- permission to leave as propertyless refugees . How are such Serbs to be told that there is now some peace agreement and they have to leave the houses , lands and goods they acquired ? Serbs are not going_to surrender any of this voluntarily . I think there is a better path , at least for the United States . Instead of joining the Europeans in dividing Bosnia , President Clinton could build_on his own initial successes . Those include the removal of the Serbian artillery around Sarajevo and Gorazde and the more decisive protection of other &quot; safe havens , &quot; implementation of the &quot; no-fly zone &quot; and , especially , the creation of a Bosnian-Croat federation and cessation of the fighting between the Croatian and Bosnian armies . Instead of appeasing the Serbs by allowing them to create their &quot; Greater Serbia &quot; empire , the world should insist that they accept the same constitutional framework and the same rights and guarantees accepted by the Bosnians and Croats in the redesigned Bosnian federation . The Serbs should be told that there is no prospect of recognition of their conquests or of the borders they have changed by force . They should be told that there is no prospect of easing or lifting of sanctions against Serbia until they accept an internationally sponsored just and durable peace . There should be an extended threat of the use of air_power to protect Bosnian towns and a lifting of the arms embargo against Bosnia to give that country a fair chance for self-defense and even liberation of its territories if peace efforts fail . These sorts of conditions and demands have already been tested , with the Croats . There was a strong ultranationalistic current among them , asking_for a division of Bosnia and creation of a &quot; Croatian Republic &quot; on Bosnian soil . But , faced with the threat of sanctions and international isolation , they opted for federation . Given the proper message of resolve , instead of legalization of their crimes , Serbs would , sooner or later , do the same . And , more important , that would n ' t be a message just to them , but to all other ultranationalists throughout the Balkans and Eastern Europe -- starting with Serbia ' s best_friend , the Russian rightist Vladimir Zhirinovsky -- who see creation of Greater Serbia as a signal that they , too , can fight for their dream empires . President Clinton recently stated that the United States and NATO should not change the military balance or enter the war on one side against the other . But that is exactly what they did_by imposing the embargo and keeping Bosnia ' s hands tied_in the face of brutal aggression . They gave the Serbs the decisive advantage in the war . President Clinton would now do much better if he followed his own , tougher course than by joining the Europeans in their attempts to impose an unjust and unworkable division on Bosnia .</TEXT>
