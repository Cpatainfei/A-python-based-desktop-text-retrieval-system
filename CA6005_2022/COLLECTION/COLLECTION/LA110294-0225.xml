   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS / CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ; CHARTING WILSON ' S TRANSFORMATION ON IMMIGRATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Pete Wilson is mad as hell about illegal immigration . Sound familiar ? California voters can hardly avoid hearing that clear , simple message . The grim-faced , doughty governor flays the federal_government for failed immigration polices , he advocates a state ID card , he warns that the state is being crushed by the financial and social costs of millions of immigrants sweeping across the Mexican border . He also vigorously supports Proposition 187 , the November ballot measure to deny health and education benefits to illegal immigrants . In election year 1994 , there is no question where Gov . Wilson stands on illegal immigration . But back in the mid-1980s , U.S. Sen . Wilson stressed a different set of views . His words and deeds from that era stand_in vivid contrast to the anti-illegal immigrant rhetoric that forms the central pillar of his reelection campaign . Then , Wilson subscribed_to the argument that California growers needed large_numbers of temporary migrant workers to bring_in the state ' s bountiful crops . With the perseverance he is known for , Wilson worked hard to ensure the steady flow of such cheap labor . Political leaders often shift and shade their platforms to adapt to changing moods in the electorate and to changing circumstances in society . But Wilson ' s current focus against illegal immigration leaves him vulnerable to charges from critics that he has undergone a recent conversion on the state ' s most emotional issue . His Democratic gubernatorial challenger , state_Treasurer Kathleen Brown , has been one ready critic : &quot; Pete Wilson is the deadbeat_dad of illegal immigration and we have the DNA to prove it. &quot; Brown has seized upon Wilson ' s well-marked trail of legislative efforts and charged him with hypocrisy -- flip-flopping on the immigration issue because it suits the California political environment in which he seeks reelection . Wilson insists his record has remained steady over the years and that Brown is distorting it for her own desperate political needs . &quot; His position has not evolved , &quot; said Leslie Goodman , a Wilson immigration spokesman . &quot; What has changed is an . . . increase in public anger ( over the issue ) that has strengthened his resolve . To suggest his position has changed is a phony charge. &quot; The record shows that as senator , Wilson was a hero to California agricultural interests for his tough legislative fight to include a guest-worker program in the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 ( IRCA ) , the pivotal reform legislation that instituted employer sanctions and offered amnesty to many undocumented workers already in the country . Growers had long fought employer sanctions as a threat to their cheap labor_pool of undocumented workers . But in the 1980s the growers realized that Congress was warming to the concept . In a strategic shift , they focused_on getting a guest worker provision inserted in the bill . Wilson was their legislative spear_carrier in the Senate . &quot; Sen . Wilson was a tireless and skillful champion ( of the guest worker program ) throughout the legislative process in the face of intense criticism , &quot; according to a December , 1986 , newsletter of the Farm Labor Alliance , a coalition of agricultural groups . &quot; In summary , agriculture owes Sen . Wilson its gratitude for protecting its interests . . . . &quot; Wilson benefited from his relationship with agricultural interests . He had received nearly $ 520 # 000 from farm-related political_action_committees in the 1980s , according to the National Library on Money and Politics in Washington . To understand Wilson ' s record on illegal immigration in the 1980s , it is necessary to understand how California has changed_over the last 10 years . California in the 1980s -- pre-recession , pre-base closings , pre-defense cuts -- was a different world economically . The state ' s reliance on undocumented workers to perform a wide variety of tasks -- many tied to the state ' s enormous agricultural enterprises -- was widely accepted . When the economy was more robust , the benefits of hiring illegal immigrants seemed to outweigh the potential problems caused by a large influx of undocumented temporary_workers . In 1982 , while campaigning for the Republican nomination for his first term in the Senate , Wilson told a Costa Mesa real_estate gathering : &quot; I deplore the ( Immigration and Naturalization Service ) raids on farms here in the roundup of illegal aliens . Our economy needs such workers , and I ' m for a guest worker program to allow such farmhands to come_in to do the work when Americans won ' t take the jobs. &quot; Wilson also criticized a Reagan_Administration proposal to bring_in only 50 # 000 Mexican guest workers . Once in the Senate , Wilson co-authored a 1983 provision that required the INS to get warrants from judges before checking fieldworkers ' citizenship . The INS fought the move , saying it would all but end enforcement efforts . But Wilson said it was necessary to provide &quot; timely harvests &quot; and argued that agriculture was being singled_out for such raids . Wilson also made_good on his campaign promise about the guest worker program , even though the Reagan_Administration ' s INS commissioner , Alan Nelson , who is one of the sponsors of Proposition 187 , viewed the growers ' complaint about labor shortages with skepticism . &quot; There ' s been some panic , which may or not be based on reality , and some hype , &quot; Nelson was quoted at the time . In 1985 , Wilson threatened to filibuster the immigration reform bill if the Senate refused to streamline procedures that growers had to follow in_order to import such workers . The bill ' s sponsor , Sen . Alan Simpson ( R-Wyo. ) , had long fought for restrictions on the numbers of immigrants allowed into the United States and strongly opposed including the guest worker plan in the bill . But it was Wilson , the freshman Republican senator from California , who led the floor fight to tack_on some form of guest worker program . He pushed for an amendment that would allow 350 # 000 temporary farm_workers in the country . It was defeated 50-48 on Sept . 13 , 1985 . But five days later , after intense lobbying from Wilson and agricultural interests , the Senate reversed itself and approved the amendment 51 to 44 . Simpson , battle-scarred after years of pushing for immigration reforms , said the program would &quot; repeat the most serious errors we have ever made in our immigration policy. &quot; But Wilson ' s plan faced strong opposition in the House because it required that the workers return home each year , withheld a portion of their wages until they did so and prohibited workers from obtaining public benefits . House Democrats , fearing that the workers would be easily exploited under those rules , devised a more liberal plan -- the Special Agricultural Workers ( SAW ) program -- that offered more protection and legal residency to the workers . Today , Wilson blames the changes in the House for all_the faults in the special workers program . Nevertheless , Wilson , according to the Farm Labor Alliance newsletter , had to head_off a last-minute filibuster from Senate conservatives up in arms over the program . The immigration bill , including the special workers program , passed the Senate on Oct . 17 , 1986 . But much went_wrong with the Immigration Reform and Control Act . Ripe for fraud and abuse , the special workers program attracted more_than 1 million seasonal workers , most locating in California . Rep . Howard L . Berman ( D-Panorama City ) , who helped hammer_out the compromise on the program , recalled Wilson ' s legislative pragmatism on the issue . &quot; Wilson as a senator wanted one primary thing out of the immigration law : that agriculture could get their foreign workers , &quot; Berman said . With the &quot; Wilson amendment &quot; facing strong opposition , he &quot; signed on ( to the special worker program ) , without ever uttering a word about ( the economic effects ) to counties and cities . What was done then helped create the problems that he lambastes now , &quot; Berman said . After the immigration reform law was enacted , Wilson wrote to President Reagan in October , 1987 , asking him to ease the eligibility for special worker program . The rules required the workers to present proof that they had worked a certain number of days harvesting perishable crops before entering the United States . Wilson wrote that the rules were &quot; cumbersome &quot; and urged that illegal workers be allowed entry if they make a &quot; non-frivolous &quot; application for the special status by agreeing to provide necessary documentation later . Wilson said relaxation of the rules was needed to &quot; avoid the disaster of fruit rotting on the trees. &quot; Although it may seem inconceivable in today ' s political atmosphere , Wilson , as a 1990 gubernatorial candidate , was eager to tout his Senate efforts on behalf of agricultural interests -- &quot; a political coup , &quot; a campaign booklet proclaimed . But once Wilson became governor , his immigration stance began to harden . Faced with dire state budget realities , a faltering economy and an increasingly angry electorate , Wilson began to view the immigration as a major source of the state ' s economic problems . In a July , 1991 , letter to members , the Federation for American Immigration Reform highlighted Wilson ' s change of heart . The federation , which advocates a moratorium on legal immigration , is one of the most conservative immigration reform groups . The letter , signed by Executive_Director Dan Stein , praised Wilson for calling immigration a &quot; prime contributor to California ' s and the nation ' s budget woes. &quot; But the group also tweaked Wilson for his 1985 amendment , which the federation strongly opposed , &quot; that allowed 1.3 million illegal alien seasonal agricultural workers to qualify for amnesty. &quot; The federation said Wilson had &quot; learned the hard way how federal inattention to immigration policy can cause havoc with state treasuries . . . . We wish he had listened to our warnings and predictions years ago. &quot; In early August , 1993 , with his popularity at record lows and facing tough prospects for reelection , Gov . Wilson outlined a sweeping immigration reform plan that called_for a constitutional amendment to deny citizenship to the U.S.-born children of illegal residents . He also called_on the federal_government to cut_off health and education benefits for illegal immigrants and prepare a tamper-proof identification card . Wilson ' s transformation was complete : He had emerged as one of the most vociferous foes of illegal immigration on the national stage . Goodman , the Wilson spokesman , vigorously defends Wilson against the contention that his immigration views have shifted over the years . &quot; Most important , the guest worker program Pete Wilson proposed was never voted on in the House and never became law . It was hijacked , liberalized and forced to the House floor for vote . Yes , he voted for the final IRCA ( that contained the special worker program ) , but do you forgo ( voting for ) the entire package , when it has employer sanctions for the first time and INS budget increases ? &quot; This was a hold-your-nose-and-vote situation . The suggestion that his pursuit of a temporary guest worker program ( then ) reflects a change in attitude ( now ) is simply untrue , &quot; Goodman said . And Berman ' s recollection ? Goodman has called the liberal Democrat &quot; part of the cabal that . . . cut a back-room deal to create the loophole which , ironically , Wilson is wrongly accused by his critics of having created. &quot; Now that Wilson is playing immigration hard ball , the federation ' s Stein takes a mellower view . &quot; He didn ' t have a change of heart , he had a change of perspective . Once you preside over the financial health of a state like California , you recognize very quickly that you can ' t be a good governor without raising the ( immigration ) issue . To cast Wilson as flip-flopping on immigration is simply not fair. &quot;</TEXT>
