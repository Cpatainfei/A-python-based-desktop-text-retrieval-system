   <HEADLINE> BODY WATCH ; LIGHT READING FOR HEAVY WORKOUTS ; YOUR MUSCLES SCREAM ; YOUR LUNGS BURN . TRY EASING THE AGONY OF THE WORKOUT WITH A GOOD MAGAZINE . BUT LEAVE THE ECONOMIST AT_HOME .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What makes the difference between wimping out early on the StairMaster and going the distance ? It may be as simple as something good to read . Forget newspapers ( sorry , boss ! ) -- those big , flapping pages can be tricky to handle while you ' re panting , and all that black ink on sweaty hands can leave you looking_like a chimney sweep . And forget books . Anything thicker than &quot; The Cat in the Hat &quot; won ' t lie flat , and it ' s tough to follow a serious plot_line while sneaking peeks at the bench-pressing hunks . Consider instead the magazine : While there ' s lots of talk today about the writing becoming too light , for gym reading that ' s just what you want . But remove all those loose subscription cards first so you don ' t jam the machine with paper shrapnel every time you turn a page . What makes a good gym magazine ? * It should distract you from -- but not compete with -- what you ' re doing . * It should not be embarrassing to be seen with -- or for others to share the room with . * The type shouldn ' t be so tight that you have to bring bifocals even if you don ' t ordinarily need them . * Features should not jump past non-page-numbered advertising supplements to page 205 . * And until someone makes exercise machines with suitable appendages to hold reading material , make_sure your mag is lightweight or can easily be propped in front of you . Of the thousands of possible choices , here are our picks for the best and worst magazines to take_to the gym : THE 10 BEST Entertainment Weekly -- It ' s less tacky than the National Enquirer but still has those tabloid tidbits -- all_the Hollywood grit and gossip , including everything you ' d ever want to know about &quot; Star Trek &quot; spin-offs and Barbra Streisand ' s mother . People -- Lightweight in every sense of the word , this is the magazine to read on cardiovascular machines . It travels easily among the dirty socks and towel , and if it gets a little wrecked , so what ? You weren ' t going_to showcase it on your coffee_table anyway . Learn about the week ' s best TV_programs , so when you stagger from the gym to crash on the couch , you ' ll know what button to push_on the remote_control . Newsweek / Time / U.S. News &amp; World Report -- These clones offer great photojournalism and lots of meaty features in one easy-to-digest package . Keep_up with weighty affairs without being so overwhelmed that your machine program drags to a dead stop . Life -- In the old days , its big format might have kept it off this list . But the downsized version still has great photos and a lively mix of news you can use . One recent issue covered everything from Castro to breast_cancer to electron-microscope photographs of live human parasites -- including the louse -- and Marilyn Monroe ' s sister ' s never-before-published photos of Norma Jean . American Health Magazine -- Because fitness of body and mind is ostensibly why you ' re at the gym , look committed and motivate yourself at_the_same_time by reading helpful stories about antioxidants , nine keys to a lasting marriage and how to find_out if you , too , are a hypochondriac . Added bonuses : how giant rubber_bands can firm your thighs and low-cal recipes to keep them that way . Natural_History -- More bang for your buck : Support New York ' s venerable Museum of Natural_History , impress fellow exercisers and learn all at_the_same_time . Easy-to-handle book will entertain and educate you with such features as ScienceLite ( astrophysics made easy ) , great comics and compelling photographs of Maui hawkfish hovering over antler coral . Buzz -- The local pick : Wide and thin for easy propping , it ' s hipper than Los Angeles magazine and livelier than many other regionals . And while offering fun tips and dishing insider scoops about some of L.A. ' s weightier institutions -- such_as Hollywood and The Times -- it lets you in on what ' s happening each month in shopping , dining and entertainment . The Atlantic Monthly -- With stories such_as &quot; The Coming Anarchy &quot; and &quot; The False Promise of Gun_Control , &quot; its subject_matter may be heavy , but the fact that you ' re reading it will definitely turn heads . True , you may_not finish even one feature if other masochists are waiting for your machine , but at least the stories are presented on consecutive pages and the easy-on-the-eyes design allows the words to breathe while you can ' t . Good fiction and poetry . The New Yorker -- You ' ll seem sophisticated and cosmopolitan despite the criticism that Editor Tina Brown has dumbed it down . The fiction is still great , the cartoons as acerbic as ever , and it runs great book and movie reviews . One warning : If you ' ve never lived_in New York , you may think they ' re talking too_much . Travel Holiday -- To take your mind far , far from your physical agony , get lost in this well-photographed book with its easy-to-read type , vibrant writing_style and handy travel tips . One recent issue meanders through Barbados , Africa , Vienna , Glacier National_Park , American casinos and Kentucky bourbon distilleries . THE 10 WORST The Economist -- Few pictures and way too dry for anyone without an Oxford degree in modern macroeconomics . Lots of graphs on subjects such_as consumer-confidence levels , share prices and the Mexican stock_market . Upside : If you drop this magazine , you can read it just as well upside down . Bon Appetit -- No , no , no ! All those gorgeous and mouth-watering pictures will only lead you into temptation . While it does include some low-cal foods such_as Roman Broth with Parmesan Cheese Threads , the maple_syrup pecan_pie and white-chocolate cheesecake with hazelnut crust will suck you in like quicksand . Architectural Digest -- It weighs and costs a ton and besides , who really reads it ? If you must buy this stuffy book for its pretty pictures of places and furnishings you ' ll never be able to afford , leave it on your coffee_table for show . Besides , the slick finish could cause it to squirt out of your sweaty hands -- just one reason people who subscribe_to it hire personal trainers . National Geographic -- Although the pictures are lavish , it weighs too_much and the rhinoceros-tough binding keeps it from politely lying open on the StairMaster . It does have well-written text and gorgeous photos , but the naked natives might be in depressingly better shape than you are . Vanity_Fair -- It ' s so thick and heavy that you ' ll be worn_out just getting_it to the gym . The covers are great conversation openers ( a naked Burt Reynolds , Roseanne Arnold in skimpy black lace ) , but to finish an article you ' ll have to fumble around to the back of the book . Save it for bedtime , when you can lie back and inhale the perfume samples . Cosmopolitan -- Like Vanity_Fair , it ' s thick and heavy and stories jump all_over the place . Unlike Vanity_Fair , you should never be caught dead holding this one-track pop psychology magazine with its cleavage-on-the-cover obsession , stupid quizzes on finding your marital IQ and nauseating features like &quot; Women Who Love Men Who Never Pay Their Parking Tickets. &quot; Muscle &amp; Fitness -- Even though the theme is right , this mag is too pumped up in every way . It ' s cumbersome , ad-laden and unless you ' re a hard-core fitness fanatic , the popped-veined men and women pictured there look more like gross parodies than anything you ' d want to emulate . Popular Mechanics -- Reading this is a sure way to fall_asleep on a speeding treadmill , causing yourself embarrassment or even physical trauma . But don ' t blame yourself -- it takes a special person to get_into those 22-step treatises on installing furnace filters , or fixing dripping relief_valves , or where to purchase a time-delay wall switch , or . . . need we say more ? Playboy -- Guys , we know you buy_it only for the writing , but save it for the privacy of your bathrooms . And ladies , while the bodies pictured here might inspire you to work harder , they could just as easily send you scampering off to Ben &amp; Jerry ' s -- or Implants R Us . Soldier_of_Fortune -- Unless you want to keep people from talking to you , leave it in your truck . It ' ll scare the hell out of everyone , including yourself . Recent topics : complete trial coverage of Waco , Aussie snipers , the ins and outs of belly guns , and a Foreign Legion vendetta .</TEXT>
