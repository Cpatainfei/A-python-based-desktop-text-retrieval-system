   <HEADLINE> 6 STATES BACK TERM LIMITS ; OREGON AWAITS ' DEATH ' VOTE ; INITIATIVES : ALASKA , IDAHO , MAINE , NEBRASKA , NEVADA AND MASSACHUSETTS RENDER VERDICT ON INCUMBENCY . COLORADO SAYS NO TO CAMPAIGN REFORM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Despite Tuesday ' s proof that voters have the ability to turn incumbents out of office -- at least 38 were defeated in House , Senate and gubernatorial races -- term limit measures continued to succeed in elections across the country . Congressional and other term limits were approved in Alaska , Idaho , Maine , Massachusetts , Nebraska and Nevada , bringing_to 21 the number of states that have reined_in their politicians . Colorado tightened existing term limits , but Utah decided not to reduce its terms any further . Term limits also passed in Washington , D.C. , and Spokane , Wash . The term limit question was just one of a dizzying array of ballot measures decided in 37 states and the District_of_Columbia , as well as in scores of local jurisdictions . Some results may bring enormous change . Oregon may have to wait until Friday to learn if voters passed the &quot; Death With Dignity &quot; proposal , which would free doctors to prescribe lethal medicine to dying patients . The outcome hinges_on 265 # 000 uncounted absentee_ballots , 21 % of the vote . On Wednesday , only 39 # 000 votes separated the pros and cons , for a tentative spread of 52 % in favor and 48 % opposed . Elsewhere , voters rejected anti-gay rights initiatives , casino developers , campaign spending caps , handgun bans and even the opportunities to control their taxes through the popular vote . &quot; The referendum process was part of the voter rebellion that we saw at the polls , &quot; Larry J . Sabato , a scholar of campaigns and elections and professor of government at the University of Virginia , said Wednesday . Sabato noted a libertarian streak too , citing the defeat of the anti-gay rights measures in Idaho and Oregon . &quot; That says to me that the conservative wave now sweeping the country also has a libertarian edge to it . ' Don ' t tread_on me , anti-government , leave the individual alone , to the extent possible , ' &quot; he said . In a smaller jurisdiction , Alachua County , Fla. , voters repealed an existing gay rights ordinance . Colorado voters said no to campaign reform , rejecting limits on campaign contributions . So did people in Massachusetts , who rejected a novel ban on corporate contributions to public referendums . Oklahoma voters said no to a penny entertainment tax that was to support breast_cancer research . In Colorado , they rejected a 50-cent hike in the cigarette tax that would have helped pay_for health_care for the poor and anti-smoking programs . Arizona barely passed a similar measure , which will add 40 cents to a pack of smokes . Given the chance to hold all new taxes up_to voter approval , Oregon , Missouri and Montana backed_away . Voters in Massachusetts , with an opportunity to lower taxes for most residents , rejected a graduated tax_rate and held onto a flat rate . In Nevada , voters decided to require two-thirds legislative approval for tax increases . Not surprisingly , the country ' s grouchiness extended_to crime measures . Georgia enacted the nation ' s sternest sentencing law , a &quot; two-strikes &quot; measure promising life without parole to anyone who commits a second violent felony . Oregon stiffened mandatory sentences for violent crimes , and Vermont made_it easier for judges to deny bail to people accused of violent crimes . Ohio , which has 134 men on Death Row but has not executed anyone in 31 years , chose to speed_up the execution process by removing the appeals court phase . Appeals will now go directly to the state Supreme Court . Floridians recoiled from the vision of 47 casinos around the state . Casino measures also failed in Rhode Island , Massachusetts and Colorado and on the Navajo Reservation . Colorado said no to slot_machines at airports ; Missouri said yes to slots on riverboats . In New Mexico , however , voters gave the go-ahead to video gambling and a new state lottery . The status_quo was fine with some voters . Seat_belt laws withstood challenges in the Dakotas and Massachusetts . Wyoming voters rejected a broad abortion ban . In Wisconsin , Milwaukee and Kenosha rejected bans on handguns . Elsewhere , Vermont voters approved gender-neutral language for their state constitution . West_Virginia rid its constitution of language proclaiming that &quot; white and colored persons shall not be taught in the same school. &quot; The provision had been void since a Supreme Court ruling 40 years ago . In Washington , voters backed a measure that really had teeth : They can now legally buy dentures directly from manufacturers instead of through their dentists .</TEXT>
