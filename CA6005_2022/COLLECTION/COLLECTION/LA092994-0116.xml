   <HEADLINE> IT ' S COOL TO BE HOT ; SOUTH PASADENA : SOLAR ENERGY IS BEING TAPPED TO HELP SUPPLY POWER TO A SCHOOL AND 300 NEARBY HOMES . THE PROJECT IS THE MOST EXTENSIVE OF ITS TYPE IN THE WORLD , OFFICIALS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a scorching summer afternoon , most people turn_on their air conditioners to escape the sun ' s heat . Imagine that those air conditioners are powered by the sun and you have discovered two things : Perfect irony and South Pasadena . In a groundbreaking project , Monterey Hills Elementary School and Southern California Edison have teamed_up to bring solar_energy to the school and 300 homes_in South Pasadena that were_on the brink of an energy burnout . &quot; This is the first time in the whole world that solar_energy is being used to this extent , &quot; said Edan Prabhu , Edison ' s project manager . In the past , Prabhu said , solar_energy has been used to power individual homes . For the first time , solar_energy will give a power boost to an entire neighborhood , he said . Edison officials chose the 300-house neighborhood , which they call Hill Grid , because of increasing demands that new or remodeled homes have been putting_on 30-year-old power_lines . Instead of tearing_up the streets to rewire insufficient underground service , Edison placed 180 solar_panels on the school ' s roof two weeks ago . When the sun is at its hottest , the metallic blue panels can harness 15 kilowatts -- or 150 100-watt bulbs -- worth of energy , which is then routed into the school ' s main power_lines . Another set of panels , 125 kilowatts worth , will be assembled on the school roof in February . Eventually , the $ 5-million project sponsored by the federal_Department of Energy and Edison , will place solar_panels on houses and possibly parking_lots in the South Pasadena neighborhood and in areas of San Marino and La Canada Flintridge that face similar problems with inadequate power_lines . Edison officials said they hope that government-sponsored projects such_as this one will help lower the cost of solar_energy by generating increased interest in the industry , leading to widespread use of the technology in urban and suburban_areas . Practically speaking , most if not all_of the power created by the first sets of solar_panels will be used by the elementary_school , Edison officials said . Still , that will reduce the load on local lines , freeing up more power for residences . In addition , they said , at times when the school is not using much power , some of the solar_power will flow to the houses . Robert Vanderwall , school director of maintenance and operations , said he approached Edison last year with the idea of using the school after he heard that the utility wanted to bring solar_energy into the neighborhood . The school ' s large , flat roofs have unobstructed exposure to the sun and therefore made an ideal project site . &quot; We were looking_for ways to economize our operations , &quot; Vanderwall said . &quot; So , we looked toward utilities. &quot; The school will save about 25 % in annual electric_bills thanks to the sun ' s free rays , he said . * At its peak , the school uses 180 kilowatts of energy ; homes use from 6 to 10 kilowatts . Edison research engineer James Swanson said that Hill Grid has used_up to 90 % of its energy capacity at peak times and that demand is expected to rise . &quot; You don ' t want to wait until it ' s at 99 % capacity until you do something , &quot; he said . &quot; we ' ll be real happy with a 5 % decrease. &quot; Edison officials are also meeting with residents to see if they are interested in having the solar_panels on their roofs . The school did not have to pay_for its panels , but officials are not sure whether residents who participate in the project will be charged . &quot; Everyone who has been asked about it has been really impressed and totally supportive , &quot; said David Briery , an Edison spokesman . The project has also been endorsed by the AQMD and Union of Concerned Scientists , Prabhu said . The panels , which are a little over four feet tall and rest at a 45-degree angle , have no moving parts and emit no chemicals . They are covered with thick glass to protect the wires within from such things as stray rocks and storms . Although the panels are ineffective on rainy_days or after sundown , people use fewer high-energy appliances , such_as air conditioners , during those times . &quot; It ' s summer afternoons we ' re most concerned with , &quot; Prabhu said . Currently , one kilowatt of solar_power costs $ 7 , as opposed to less than $ 1 per kilowatt for natural_gas , but officials expect the price to go_down as solar_energy becomes more popular . It already powers everyday devices such_as pocket_calculators and highway emergency telephones . School_Principal Joe Johnson said he also liked the idea of using the panels as learning tools . &quot; It actually dovetails with our science instruction , &quot; he said . &quot; The kids will find more applications of how solar_energy works. &quot;</TEXT>
