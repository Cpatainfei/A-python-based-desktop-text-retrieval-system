   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : CLOUDS , RAIN EXPECTED NEW YEAR ' S WEEKEND</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Put_away the suntan lotion and break_out the bagpipes , a National Weather Service forecaster advised for New Year ' s weekend . &quot; The weather is going_to be ugly , &quot; Vladimir Ryshko said. &quot; It ' s going_to be a lot like Scotland. &quot; Ryshko said there is a 20 % chance of rain Saturday and a 30 % chance Sunday . Skies will remain overcast and gloomy through Monday . &quot; At some point it will rain , &quot; he said , adding that the expected rain &quot; will not be overwhelming , but carry an umbrella anyway. &quot; He said temperatures will reach the high 50s and 60s today and Sunday , and the lows will be in the mid-40s . It will get colder on Monday and the chance of rain will increase on Tuesday , he said . &quot; It looks_like it will be chilly and showery , &quot; he said . While travelers and revelers are bundling_up and packing rain gear , the California Highway Patrol warns against driving drunk , especially during one of the agency ' s busiest weekends . &quot; We will have increased patrols , &quot; said CHP spokeswoman Staci Morse . She said up_to 20 officers will patrol county highways at any given time this weekend . At least eight of them will be searching exclusively for drunk drivers . She said the CHP expects traffic to be heavier than usual on the freeways but no slowdowns are expected unless accidents occur . &quot; Don ' t be a looky-loo &quot; she said . &quot; that ' s what slows things down. &quot; Last year , two people died in county traffic accidents over the New Year ' s weekend .
