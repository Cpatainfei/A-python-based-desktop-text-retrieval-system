   <HEADLINE> TWO AFRICAN PRESIDENTS DIE IN PLANE CRASH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The presidents of Rwanda and Burundi were killed in a plane crash near this capital city ' s airport Wednesday as they flew back together from regional peace talks in Tanzania . Rwandan diplomats charged that the plane was shot down . Presidents Juvenal Habyarimana of Rwanda and Cyprian Ntayamira of Burundi had been in Tanzania for a meeting of east-central African leaders seeking ways to end ethnic violence in the two countries . Rwanda and Burundi have been racked by bloodletting between the rival Hutu and Tutsi ethnic_groups . The deaths of the presidents , both Hutus , are almost sure to inflame tensions in both countries . The French Embassy in Kigali confirmed that both presidents were killed in the crash . About 10 people were aboard , and there were no survivors , the embassy said . Witnesses heard heavy-weapons fire around the airport shortly before the crash . &quot; What happened was not an accident but an assassination , &quot; Rwanda ' s U.N. ambassador , Jean Damascene Bizimana , told reporters at the United Nations after the 15 Security_Council members stood_for a minute of silence in an unusual tribute . The council expressed its &quot; shock and distress &quot; and called_for calm while the crash is investigated . Bizimana said the plane was hit by rocket fire but did not say who attacked . Francois Ngarukintwali , the Rwandan ambassador in Brussels , quoted the chief_of_staff of the Rwandan Cabinet , Enoch Ruhigira , as saying that the plane was attacked . &quot; It was shot down . It ' s true . It burned , &quot; Ngarukintwali told the Associated Press , adding that he could not confirm the deaths . Laura Lane , the economic officer at the U.S. Embassy in Kigali , said she was at her home , about a 10-minute drive from the airport , at the time of the crash . &quot; There were all kinds of sounds and explosions . We could hear some shots . We did not know what it was , and we were all instructed to stay in our houses , which we did , &quot; she said in a telephone_interview . &quot; It is a terrible , terrible catastrophe for both countries at this very dangerous time , &quot; said a Western diplomat in Burundi ' s capital , Bujumbura . &quot; Anything could happen. &quot; But he added that Bujumbura was_quiet immediately following the news . In Bujumbura , a Hutu resident whose mother and father were injured in a grenade attack last month said : &quot; Everyone is hiding indoors and listening to their radios . We fear for our lives and country. &quot; The African leaders had met in the Tanzanian capital of Dar Es Salaam earlier Wednesday to seek a regional approach to end tensions in Burundi and Rwanda . The deep rivalries between the Hutu majority in both tiny central African states and the Tutsi minority have given both countries bloody histories since before independence in 1962 . Although the Tutsi make_up only 15 % of Burundi ' s population , they controlled the country until President Melchior Ndadaye -- a Hutu -- won the nation ' s first democratic election last June . Since Ndadaye ' s assassination in October , up_to 100 # 000 people have died in ethnic violence and 1 million have fled to other nations . Ntayamira , 38 , was elected president by Burundi ' s National Assembly in January , but the Tutsi still dominate the army . The ethnic hatred has exploded repeatedly since Burundi gained independence from Belgium , with an estimated 100 # 000 people , mainly Hutu , killed in massacres in 1972 . In August , 1988 , Hutu farmers along the border with Rwanda staged an uprising . In neighboring Rwanda , Habyarimana ' s Hutu coalition reached a peace accord in August with the former Rwandan Patriotic Front rebels , made_up mainly of minority Tutsi , but they have failed to agree on a transitional government . The latest attempt failed Feb . 22 after two politicians were assassinated by Tutsi fighters . An estimated 2 # 000 civilians died in 2 1 / 2 years of war , and nearly 1 million were forced from their homes . The U.N. envoy to Rwanda , Jacques-Roger Booh Booh , had warned earlier this month that the tiny country faced collapse and a new civil_war . Habyarimana , 57 , took power in a bloodless coup in 1973 .</TEXT>
