   <HEADLINE> SOMETIMES EUTHANASIA IS ONLY SOLUTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * As one of several dozen Mission Viejo Animal Shelter volunteers , I must respond to the errors in the letter ( Aug . 7 ) from Pepe Michel . The city employees who staff our pro-life shelter are professionals who are dedicated to providing humane care_for the animals we shelter . The dozens of trained volunteers who clean cages , feed , bathe , groom and exercise our guests care deeply about animal welfare . We have cared_for many unlovely but still lovable animals for many months until the right person came_along to adopt them . We have comforted animals during necessary euthanasia and wept over them . It is true that 106 animals were euthanized between July , 1993 , and May , 1994 . Forty were for medical reasons because sadly it was the humane the thing to do , and 46 because the animals had a history of vicious behavior , and it would have been irresponsible to allow them to be adopted . The total number of animals impounded during that time was 1 # 146 , and over 1 # 000 were redeemed , adopted or are still awaiting a home . Those of us who care_for our city ' s lost and abandoned animals are deeply hurt by the irresponsible accusation of murder when occasionally euthanasia is the only responsible and humane choice . Mr. Michel , please visit our shelter and introduce yourself so that we can give you the facts . Since you say you are concerned , you might even want to join your neighbors in helping us provide care . PAUL H . STAHLHUTH Mission Viejo</TEXT>
