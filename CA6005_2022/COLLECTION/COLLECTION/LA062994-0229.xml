   <HEADLINE> CONGRESS TO SEEK LEGISLATION FOR CIA-FBI COOPERATION ; ESPIONAGE : INTELLIGENCE PANEL CONCLUDES A PRESIDENTIAL ORDER REQUIRING THE AGENCIES TO JOINTLY INVESTIGATE COUNTERSPIES ISN ' T WORKING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Concerned about continuing lapses of the kind that permitted the most damaging counterspy ever to operate at the CIA , congressional intelligence committees have decided to push for legislation requiring the agency to cooperate with the FBI in investigating counterspies , according to congressional sources . The committees have concluded that a May 3 presidential directive has not succeeded in closing the gaps in CIA-FBI cooperation that became apparent with the arrest this year and subsequent guilty plea of Aldrich H . Ames , the sources said . Ames , a 31-year CIA veteran , sold the former Soviet_Union and later Russia some of his agency ' s most sensitive secrets . Among other things , the CIA failed to advise the FBI for two years that Ames initially had given suspicious responses in a 1991 polygraph examination , even though the FBI had joined in hunting for a suspected mole , Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Dennis DeConcini ( D-Ariz. ) has noted . As a result of the rising concern , the intelligence panel has passed legislation , in the form of an amendment to the 1995 budget authorization , that would make the FBI director responsible_for counterintelligence and would mandate CIA cooperation . That language goes considerably beyond Clinton ' s directive , which strengthened the National Security_Council ' s authority over counterintelligence , designated a senior FBI official to head a key counterespionage group at the CIA and directed CIA officials to work_at the FBI . Clinton ' s order also created new policy and operations boards to coordinate and oversee the work . Clinton ' s directive marked the 11th presidential attempt over the last two decades to achieve interagency cooperation on counterintelligence . &quot; Not one of them has worked , &quot; said a congressional source familiar_with the issue . &quot; Now we ' re on the 11th and still the FBI doesn ' t get full cooperation . So , instead of a healing process , there ' s more bad blood. &quot; The source declined to provide examples of failures to cooperate but said the CIA has raised the issue by citing its need to protect its &quot; sources and methods. &quot; But another source familiar_with the dispute said the concerns arise primarily because CIA Director R . James Woolsey has indicated at the agency that he does not have confidence in the arrangement spelled_out by the directive . Last month , Woolsey and FBI Director Louis J . Freeh testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee in support of the presidential directive . But sources said Freeh since has agreed with senior committee officials that only legislation can solve the problem permanently . Robert B . Bucknam , Freeh ' s chief_of_staff , declined to comment on the reports . Woolsey argued in his testimony that giving the FBI overall counterintelligence responsibility would bring_back the rivalries that once existed between the FBI and CIA . Referring to the National Counterintelligence Center at the CIA , created by Clinton ' s directive , Woolsey said : &quot; I can ' t conceive_of a substantive issue being raised -- whether a polygraph ( result ) , a foreign intelligence_agent ' s report . . . that does not come_to the Center. &quot; On May 24 , Freeh named Edward J . Curran to serve as chief of the counterespionage group at the CIA center . Curran was formerly assistant special_agent in_charge of counterintelligence at the FBI ' s Los Angeles field office . The counterintelligence bill won committee approval by a vote of 16 to 1 after a last-ditch effort to alter it failed . The committee voted_down an amendment , suggested by the White_House , that would have given the CIA director the authority to circumvent the FBI by telling the President that CIA information could not be shared with the bureau . The committee concluded that there are no circumstances under which the FBI could not be told about counterspies and counterespionage . Congressional sources contended that the CIA has not undertaken the kind of internal reforms that might improve counterintelligence work . A senior CIA official countered that some of the ideas put_forward recently are in fact old ideas or &quot; bad ideas whose time has come again. &quot; But several sources said they were disappointed by the lack of reforms at the CIA since Woolsey took_over last year . Former CIA Director Robert M . Gates had begun an overhaul of the U.S. intelligence community . Woolsey said during his confirmation_hearings he would continue those changes . Woolsey has focused primarily on streamlining the intelligence budget and personnel under pressure of budget cutbacks , while trying to ensure that the United States does not lose its competitive edge , a senior CIA official said . However , a congressional intelligence source said that &quot; there ' s no game_plan . People are holding_on to their turf and jurisdictions and Woolsey has not come_forth as a leader to say the Ames case is a perfect example of what ' s wrong with this community . He hasn ' t said this is how to restructure and alter mission . Some changes are going_on , but not enough. &quot;</TEXT>
