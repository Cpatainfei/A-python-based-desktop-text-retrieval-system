   <HEADLINE> HOWARD ROSENBERG : TELEVISION ; TALE OF TWO CITIES , TWO HOSTS : SAME OLD STORY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Traveling can be overrated . &quot; Late Show With David Letterman &quot; resumed taping in New York on Monday after a highly publicized week ' s worth of allegedly tinselly telecasts from CBS in Los Angeles . Letterman ' s first guest Monday : Fox ' s &quot; Melrose Place &quot; star Heather Locklear . Of Los Angeles . Normally beamed to the United States from Burbank , &quot; The Tonight Show With Jay Leno &quot; is temporarily coming from NBC in Manhattan , spending this week supposedly soaking_up that famous New York &quot; edge. &quot; Leno ' s first sit-down guest Monday was Mike Myers of &quot; Saturday Night Live , &quot; who immediately began spinning anecdotes about being with Sylvester Stallone in Hawaii . The Nielsens made them do_it . Letterman and Leno became bicoastal this month because of the May ratings sweeps , hoping to inflate their respective audiences merely through changes of locale . The trappings of travel worked for Letterman ' s &quot; Late Show , &quot; which last week extended its lead over Leno ' s &quot; Tonight Show , &quot; swelling its Nielsens in the crucial Los Angeles market and earning its fourth highest national ratings since its inception . And Leno ' s audience Monday was 13 % larger than usual in the 31 cities for which overnight ratings were available -- including a 69 % jump in New York . Whatever the ratings , such relocations are usually noisier than substantive , rarely yielding the level of change promised by their buildup . In Letterman ' s case , his Los Angeles quickie became a media-bloated whale nourished by thunderous promotion that sucked_in just about everyone . Credit that for his higher audience numbers , not the content of his Los Angeles segments , which , by his standards ( his show is just about always funny ) , were more or less routine -- the exception being a_couple_of unbilled cameos by Johnny Carson . No Rodney G . King sitting in with Paul Shaffer on drums . No 10 Best list read by the jailed Menendez brothers . All in all , it was just another week of Letterman . Worth watching , but not distinctive . Nearly everything he did_in Los Angeles he could have done_in New York ; even his signature on-location whimsy was not especially distinguishing . His guest list is generally not dependent_on which coast celebrities live . So what ' s the big deal ? You turn_on Letterman and there he is in Los Angeles with Billy Crystal , for example , as if Crystal would never think_of jetting to New York to promote his latest movie . As if Los Angeles celebrities don ' t fly to New York and their New York counterparts to Los Angeles . On TV , everything blurs . One of Letterman ' s guests in New York Monday was book-promoting , movie-promoting , tour-promoting country singer Travis Tritt , who Tuesday morning was interviewed in Los Angeles via satellite by Sam Rubin on KTLA-TV Channel 5 ' s morning news . Scheduled to appear with Leno this week , meanwhile , was radio talk-show host / New York gubernatorial candidate Howard Stern ( wasn ' t he just in L.A. ? ) , who would go_to Rwanda if he had something of_his_own to advertise . On Monday , Leno wove a little New York ( &quot; You come here , you walk_around , you get that New York attitude . . . &quot; ) into his otherwise typical , generally funny monologue . Suddenly , there was Jack Paar , co-host of &quot; The Tonight Show &quot; from 1957-62 , when it originated_in New York . There was something symbolic here : Letterman got Carson , Leno got Paar , who cracked some terrible crotch jokes before mercifully departing while the studio audience turned_on the applause as if it actually knew who he was . Later there was a non-speaking cameo by syndicated talk-show host Phil Donahue , who hadn ' t been seen on television since , well , earlier that day . But the New York attitude really hit the fan when Myers was followed by the now sedate and stiff-upper-lippy Spike Lee , on the talk-show circuit promoting his new movie , &quot; Crooklyn , &quot; and later by the even more laid-back singer James Taylor . The show also ran some pre-taped New York location pieces , with Leno and that human brick , bandleader Branford Marsalis , taking a scenic tour of the city ( &quot; Then it was off to the Empire_State Building . . . &quot; ) . What ' s it like being in New York ? &quot; Really exciting , &quot; Leno told Regis Philbin on &quot; Live &quot; Tuesday , as if he were just in from Peoria . Come_to think_of it , his show did have that Peoria edge . * Speaking of traveling , meanwhile , this is also the week that &quot; Action News &quot; meets Aunt Matilda . That is to say , Monday marked billion- , zillion- , schmillion-dollar Ann Martin ' s debut as Michael Tuck ' s co-anchor on KCBS-TV Channel 2 news at 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. &quot; It ' s a real pleasure to have you on our side for a change , &quot; said Tuck , starting a gusher of on-set welcomes given Martin , who for years was a top anchor at KABC-TV Channel 7 , where Channel 2 sportscaster Jim Hill also once toiled . &quot; It is going_to be fun times again , &quot; Hill told Martin on Monday . Fun times ? Happily , that is what Martin has never represented as an anchor . Unlike many of her hammier , pontificating counterparts , who seem convinced that they were divinely appointed to their jobs , she has always been thoroughly pleasant , professional and low key , almost to_the_point of being prim . She ' s several points lower on the Richter scale , for example , than the anchor she replaces , Bree Walker , and much less intense than her new co-anchor , Tuck . Will the addition of Martin , the pairing of Bob Jiminez with Tritia Toyota at 6 p.m. and a swanky new set be enough to lift terminally trailing Channel 2 in local news ratings ? No one knows , but possibly . But will the basic character of &quot; Action News &quot; be altered by these cosmetic touches ? Probably as much as Los Angeles altered Letterman and New York altered Leno .</TEXT>
