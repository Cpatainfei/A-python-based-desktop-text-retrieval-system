   <HEADLINE> BAR HUNTING IN ALASKA ; FROM FISHING VILLAGE TO MINING CAMP TO METROPOLIS , LOCAL WATERING_HOLES CAPTURE STATE ' S ' WORK HARD , PLAY HARD ' TRADITION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> He was big and bold and bearded , and he smelled like effluent from a fish cannery . He wore high rubber_boots over patched overalls , and a plaid flannel shirt that stretched tight across his barrel chest . Bloodshot eyes glared out from beneath his cap -- a navy-blue tuque -- that covered his long , brown hair . He sauntered into the saloon , ordered a brew , pulled_up a barrel beside me and launched into a vociferous soliloquy on environmental politics . He was , in short , an Alaskan . And like many Alaskans , whose reputation for toughness in an often-harsh climate is well-deserved , the local bar was his social center . My new acquaintance on this occasion was a fisherman just in from a cold , rainy week of halibut fishing on Kachemak Bay and the Cook Inlet . His refuge was the Salty Dawg , which occupies a ramshackle lighthouse opposite a bald-eagle feeding ground near the end of the three-mile-long Homer Spit , at the tip of the Kenai Peninsula . Built_in 1897 , the Salty Dawg has weathered nearly a century of catastrophic storms , tidal_waves and earthquakes , some of them much larger than Los Angeles ' recent 6.6-magnitude tremor ( a devastating 1964 quake measured 8.4 ) . It has been a school , a post_office , a grocery_store , a railroad_station , a coal-mining office and an oil-company headquarters . Today the Dawg is a sometimes-rowdy saloon with a sawdust floor , initials carved into its counters and tables , and flags , life_buoys and T-shirts hanging from its ceilings and walls . When it ' s too stormy out_to launch a boat , some fishermen and workers from nearby canneries are here when the door opens at 11 a.m. -- and stay until it closes 18 hours later . The Salty Dawg is not unique in its ambience . There are similar watering_holes throughout the 49th state -- not just in old lighthouses , perhaps , but in equally atmospheric settings . Skagway ' s Red_Onion , for instance , is lodged_in what was once a brothel . And the Howling Dog , 11 miles north of Fairbanks near the Arctic_Circle , is right on the edge of the tundra . Instead of a fisherman , your company there might be a North Slope oil worker escaping the permafrost , a logger who has been thinning the old-growth cedar forests of the Panhandle , or a hard-bitten miner with a lode on his mind . For that matter , especially in Anchorage , Alaska ' s Fresno-size metropolis , it could be a spiffed-up office worker out for a night on the town . Alaska ' s natural beauty has few parallels on this earth . The same can be said of its half-million people . They work hard to earn a living from an unforgiving land , and when the work is over , they traditionally play hard . There may be no better place to strike_up a conversation than in their local saloons . Beer_drinkers rave about Alaskan Beer , brewed in Juneau ( and best enjoyed at that city ' s Red Dog Saloon ) . The Alaskan Brewing Co . was established only in 1986 , but already its Alaskan Amber has twice been voted the most popular beer at the annual Great American Beer Festival in Colorado . There ' s also an Alaskan Pale Ale ( &quot; a northern light &quot; ) . Saloon food varies widely , though it ' s always pretty basic . You won ' t find oyster_bars here . Some bars serve_up nothing more appetizing than peanuts and pretzels ( or , in the case of Anchorage ' s Fly_by Night Club , Spam ) ; others , like the Malemute Saloon near Fairbanks , go whole hog with reindeer stew or other wild-game dishes . The Red Dog is adjoined by an atmospheric restaurant , The Cook House ; no meals are served in the bar , but steaks and seafood are 10 steps away . More typically , Alaskan bar menus feature burgers or burritos , pizza or deli-style sandwiches . Liberal state licensing laws permit bars , restaurants , liquor_stores and other licensed establishments to operate from 8 a.m. to 5 a.m. , seven days a week . Anchorage , Juneau and many other towns have passed local ordinances that have reduced open hours , typically to 2 a.m. * During the past 10 years , while researching and revising a guidebook to the state , I have made many visits to Alaska hotels , restaurants , tourist attractions and , yes , drinking establishments . Here , then , are some of my favorite places , chosen for their uniquely Alaskan spirit . These are all full bars , serving a full range of spirits along with beer and wine . With one exception , they are local hangouts , but places where tourists are welcomed as well . The exception is the Malemute Saloon , which I ' ve included because it so successfully re-creates a turn-of-the-century gold-rush flavor . * Bird House Bar , Indian . A victim of the massive 1964 earthquake , this collapsing log shanty , half-buried in sod 27 miles southeast of downtown Anchorage near the hamlet of Indian , has nevertheless managed to stay in business . A giant wooden bird ' s head , painted blue , faces the highway ; it is half as high as the wall from which it protrudes . The interior is , in a word , bizarre . Everything slants in different directions : floors , walls , bar , you name it . Conventional wisdom is that you ' ve had too_much to drink when things begin to look normal ! The walls are covered with business_cards , photos and expired driver ' s licenses , and the bartender may insist that you cannot go until you leave something of yours behind . * Chilkoot Charlie ' s , Anchorage . Chilkoot Charlie is a sort of Alaskan Paul_Bunyan . This mythic character once , for instance , staved_off starvation on an ice_floe by eating the tail of a polar_bear and giving the bear the bone to chew on . According to legend , that ' s why the modern polar_bear has only a stump for a tail . His name is now carried by Anchorage ' s most stereotypically &quot; Alaskan &quot; bar -- with sawdust floors , padded tree-stump stools and gold-rush-era decor . At opposite ends of &quot; Koot ' s , &quot; as the club is known , are two stages for live music : One serves_up high-decibel rock for dancing nightly ; the other features mainly country and Alaskan &quot; bush ballad &quot; singers . Between them are three bars , a snack_counter that serves burritos and pizzas , and an enclosed courtyard with horseshoe and barbecue pits . * Fly_by Night Club , Anchorage . The whimsical owner of this enigmatic nightspot , a jazz_musician who calls himself Mr. White Keys , keeps his tongue planted firmly in cheek . The nightly entertainment schedule at his club features slapstick revues like &quot; The Whale Fat Follies , &quot; performances by top local rock and jazz_bands , and various special events , from ' 50s parties to lingerie shows . The menu is limited to Spam hors d ' oeuvres -- half-price with champagne by the glass , free with Dom Perignon . White Keys ' own jazz_band is called the Spamtones , and the club ' s phone_number is 279-SPAM . The Fly_by Night closes after Christmas until April . Cover_charge for the &quot; follies &quot; is $ 10 ; otherwise , entry is free except when major touring acts appear . * Howling Dog Saloon , Fox . Fairbanks ' most popular bar isn ' t even in Fairbanks -- it ' s 11 miles north on the edge of the tundra , en route to the Arctic_Circle . As the northernmost bar in this listing ( most Alaskan native communities , which predominate in northern Alaska , have banned the sale of alcohol ) , it ' s the best place to enjoy the midnight_sun of midsummer , far from the city lights . Throughout June and July , the volleyball_court in the Howling Dog ' s back yard is in_use all night long . This rustic establishment is packed to the rafters most nights , and especially Thursday through Saturday , when a neighborhood band plays home-grown rock ' n ' roll . * Kito ' s Kave , Petersburg . A noisy anomaly in an otherwise quiet Scandinavian enclave on the Inside Passage , Kito ' s is lodged_in a nondescript red building at a decidedly un-Norwegian intersection named for a Chinese ( Sing Lee Alley ) and a native Tlingit ( Chief John Lott Street ) . Hard by the small-boat harbor , it draws fishermen who enjoy live rock_music . . . and fishermen ' s wives , especially when the Chippendale male dancers are in town . * Malemute Saloon , Ester . Made famous by the Robert Service ballad , &quot; The Shooting of Dan McGrew , &quot; the Malemute looks_like a converted barn with classic swinging_doors and a sawdust floor . Tables are mere boards on kegs ; a sign at the bar urges patrons to &quot; Please use spittoon. &quot; Reindeer stew and other dishes are served dinner-show guests who pay $ 14.95 to see re-enactments of Service ' s narrative poems on stage to the tune of ragtime music . ( The show is $ 5 without dinner. ) Open summers only , the Malemute is located at the Ester Gold Camp , a restored 1890s miners ' settlement at the end of a dirt road , eight miles west of Fairbanks . * Red Dog Saloon , Juneau . Among the old firearms behind the bar is a gun that Wyatt Earp supposedly deposited on his way to the gold fields in the 1890s . . . and never reclaimed . Overhead , amid other marine memorabilia autographed by ships ' crews , is a flag from the infamous Exxon Valdez ; management swears it ' s the banner the ill-fated tanker was flying when it ran_aground in Prince William Sound in 1989 . Indeed , the decor of the venerable Red Dog -- one of the first places cruise-ship passengers see when they alight in the state_capital -- reflects a century of Alaskan whimsy and history . Though it has changed location several times , this friendly saloon still boasts decor straight out of a taxidermist ' s shop . But the argonauts of yesteryear didn ' t have a bustling souvenir shop or the adjoining Cook House restaurant , which re-creates a turn-of-the-century mining camp atmosphere . ( The menu offers what may be the state ' s biggest hamburger : two pounds , served on a pizza-size bun with two pounds of French fries on the side for $ 13.95. ) * Red_Onion Saloon , Skagway . Many moons have passed since this former brothel served its customers more_than drinks , but cutouts of scantily_clad young_women still peer through the red-lit upstairs windows , overlooking what was once the main route to the Klondike Gold_Rush ; monogrammed garters are the best-selling souvenir . The Red_Onion has live jazz frequently , honky-tonk piano and jukebox always , and dancing wherever patrons find floor space . It serves huge deli-style sandwiches at lunch , too . Like many other establishments in tourism-oriented Skagway , the Red_Onion closes for the winter .
