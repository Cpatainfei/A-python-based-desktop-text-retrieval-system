   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE / LIFELINES OF L.A. ; THE FAULT_LINE ; TUG OF WAR CENTERED ON CALTRANS SEISMIC MAP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the immediate aftermath of the Northridge earthquake , the chief bridge engineer of Caltrans would blame an unmapped fault for the violent shaking that brought_down key links in the area ' s freeway network . Engineer James E . Roberts would say later that he based that assessment on early information from seismologists who were studying where the earth moved before dawn on Jan . 17 . Although the precise fault_line may have been a mystery , the potential for a severe quake and intense ground motion centered in the northern San Fernando Valley was not a surprise . To assess the seismic hazard to the state ' s freeways , Caltrans for years has been using the most comprehensive map ever prepared by the state detailing the maximum earthquake possible along 225 fault_lines and zones in California . Even before it was finished , the wall-sized map and an accompanying report sparked a behind-the-scenes controversy among geologists and seismologists . Some feared that the information would be misinterpreted by engineers and consultants in designing buildings . Although Caltrans embraced the map ' s conservative approach , some experts expressed concern that it does not indicate a key factor -- the probability of a temblor occurring during a specified time_period . In stark black lines , the map shows that the Los Angeles region is riddled with faults capable of generating a quake of the same magnitude as the Northridge temblor or greater . At least four fault zones believed to be capable of producing a 6.75-magnitude shock or greater crisscross the northern and eastern San Fernando Valley , including the Simi-Santa Rosa-Northridge Fault zone close to the epicenter of last month ' s devastating quake . The map lists that fault zone as capable of generating a 7.5-magnitude quake . The Verdugo , San Fernando-Sierra Madre and Santa Susana thrust_faults also are shown in the area . Caltrans commissioned the map in 1982 for use in designing freeways and establishing priorities for reinforcing highway bridges and overpasses to withstand quakes . But it took the state Division of Mines and Geology 10 years -- until 1992 -- to publish the work . In July of 1989 , less than three months before the Loma Prieta quake rocked Northern California , James H . Gates , chief of structural mechanics engineering for Caltrans , demanded the release of the map in a strongly worded memo to Joseph I . Ziony , then-assistant director of the state_Department of Conservation . &quot; I find it incredible that anyone would question the desirability of releasing ( the map ) . The map was developed using public funds and it exists , &quot; Gates wrote . &quot; I am not a legal_expert , but it seems to me that if a significant ( quake ) were to occur , the Division of Mines and Geology could be held responsible_for withholding information which could have reduced damage or saved lives. &quot; Gates said the data on levels of ground shaking contained on the map is basic and &quot; can be applied with engineering judgment to any structure , just as we do. &quot; Ziony no longer works for the state . After reviewing the memo , state geologist James F . Davis recalled that Gates &quot; wanted the map to come_out . His interests were taken into account. &quot; But when released by the Division of Mines and Geology , the report was labeled for Caltrans ' &quot; internal use &quot; and the map carried a prominent bold-faced disclaimer saying it was produced exclusively for Caltrans ' use in the design of highway bridges and overpasses . &quot; General use of this ( map ) for seismic hazard evaluation is not recommended because this map does not take_into_account the probability that a particular level of shaking will occur , &quot; the disclaimer reads . Davis said some members of a special advisory committee to the state ' s Mining and Geology Board were concerned that broader use of the map might mislead engineering consultants and others in designing critical facilities , such_as hospitals . &quot; That was a very special purpose map , &quot; he said . &quot; One should not rely_on a single map for anything. &quot; Instead , he suggested that engineering consultants make a full examination of available geologic information . Davis said the Division of Mines and Geology is preparing a new map that will factor_in the probability of a certain level of ground shaking occurring during a specified period_of_time . Gates , now chief of the Office of Earthquake Engineering , said Caltrans is pleased with the map . The department has since hired the seismologist who prepared the report . &quot; We are interested in continuing development on that kind of map , &quot; he said . Caltrans officials say the information is critical in designing freeways and in assessing the seismic hazard to highway bridges and overpasses . Since its development , the map has been used as one element in a complex formula to determine priorities for retrofitting freeways to resist quake damage , Gates said . Charting the Faults After a behind-the-scenes struggle with the state Division of Mines and Geology , Caltrans received the most comprehensive map ever prepared by the state listing the maximum earthquake expected along major fault_lines in California . The map shows that the Los Angeles region , including the San Fernando Valley , is riddled with fault systems capable of generating a quake of the same magnitude as the Jan . 17 Northridge temblor or greater .
