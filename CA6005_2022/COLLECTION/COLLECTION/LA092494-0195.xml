   <HEADLINE> IRA LEADER GRANTED VISA FOR U.S. VISIT ; NORTHERN_IRELAND : GERRY ADAMS LEAVES TODAY ON A 14-DAY TOUR INTENDED TO CAPITALIZE ON GROUP ' S AUG . 31 CEASE-FIRE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Gerry Adams , leader of the political arm of the outlawed Irish_Republican_Army , has been granted a visa by the U.S. Embassy in London for a 14-day visit to the United States , embassy officials announced Friday . Adams ' Sinn Fein party said he will depart today for Boston , where he is expected to meet with Sen . Edward M . Kennedy ( D-Mass. ) and then visit eight other U.S. cities . The visa specified that Adams should not participate in fund-raising activities for Sinn Fein or the IRA while in the United States . The U.S. tour is part of an international effort by Sinn Fein to capitalize on the IRA cease-fire announced Aug . 31 . Last February , over stiff opposition from the U.S. Embassy here , Adams was granted a visit by the State_Department and received heavy media coverage during a 48-hour trip to New York City . This time , with the current IRA cease-fire in place , the_British offered only mild protests against the granting of a visa . In another development , Prime_Minister John Major said Friday that the_British government could hold talks with Sinn Fein by Christmas -- if the IRA makes_it clear that its cease-fire is permanent . &quot; Sinn Fein is very nearly there , &quot; Major told the_British Broadcasting Corp . &quot; They could settle the_matter immediately by making_it clear that what they have said is meant to convey that they have given_up violence for good . &quot; It isn ' t just a semantic matter ; it isn ' t just a matter of persuading me . I think the people of Northern_Ireland want to hear that message as well . Once that has happened , we are_on a path where in due course Sinn Fein can join the political talks. &quot; Last December ' s Downing Street Declaration issued by Major and Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds promised Sinn Fein a place at all-party peace talks -- designed to end 25 years of sectarian violence -- three months after a successful cease-fire . Major has refused to indicate when that three-month period starts , insisting that the IRA must renounce violence permanently . This has placed him at_odds with Reynolds , who believes that the period should date to Aug . 31 if the IRA cease-fire continues to hold . Pro-British paramilitary groups in Northern_Ireland have not observed the cease-fire . Thus , Adams will arrive in the United States on a wave of political success to conduct his tour , which will include Los Angeles and San Francisco . Government sources here said they were assured that President Clinton will not receive Adams at the White_House , but the_Irish republican leader will see other political and business figures . A Pro-British delegation from Northern_Ireland met with Vice_President Al Gore and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake on Thursday in an effort to present their case to U.S. leaders before Adams presents his . Those unionists insist that Northern_Ireland should determine its future links to Britain by a vote within the province , where unionists now hold a majority and presumably would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom . Sinn Fein argues that Northern_Ireland ' s future should be determined by a vote of the entire island of Ireland -- which would probably choose unification .</TEXT>
