   <HEADLINE> RWANDA REFUGEE FLIGHT BRINGS MISERY TO BUKAVU</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The mountain forests of Central_Africa rise steeply from the banks of Lake Kivu at this remote , run-down resort town . The 200 # 000 or so residents here prefer to lift their eyes from the seedy streets and proclaim it the &quot; green city. &quot; But now , under the unstoppable pressure of another Rwandan refugee migration , Bukavu is being reduced hour by hour to another squalid cesspool of misery . Already , 50 # 000 Rwandans have poured into the city , overrunning its parks and streets with their makeshift hovels . More press in each hour . The relentless chop-chop of machetes has denuded the green city of much of its greenery . The air is damp with the reek of human_waste and campfire smoke . The fear of banditry is palpable . And Thursday , the United Nations and relief agencies said the first epidemic of disease has taken_hold here -- deadly shigella dysentery , resistant to all but the most expensive and exotic antibiotics . Cholera and meningitis also are reported , although not yet at epidemic levels . &quot; Sanitation is horrible . People are sleeping on top of each other . There are problems with water . It is the start of a real disaster , &quot; said Samantha N . Bolton of the_French relief agency Doctors Without Borders . To the north , the Zairian border city of Goma already has endured this horror . But Bukavu presents its own unsettling challenges as more refugees come streaming down the Rwandan roads in epic columns , now more_than 100 miles long . For one thing , unlike Goma , this area is densely populated and there are no satisfactory sites for refugee camps nearby . Within a 20-mile radius , 12 small camps have been established to hold about 55 # 000 people . Another site was designated Thursday for 60 # 000 people -- but it is an impossible 60 miles away , meaning already weak refugees will have to march another four days . Or transportation will have to be found to truck them the 4 1 / 2-hour drive over miserable roads . &quot; It ' s a bad solution , but it ' s the only one we have , &quot; said Kris Janowski of the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees , shrugging . The critical question for this region is how many refugees eventually will end_up here . About 320 # 000 Rwandans are now massed in the vicinity of the Rwanda-Zaire border . Perhaps another 1 million or 1.5 million are within walking distance . The region of Rwanda adjacent to Bukavu has been designated a &quot; safe zone &quot; for refugees from Rwanda ' s civil_war and is protected by French troops -- but only until Monday , when they promise to complete their pullout and leave security to U.N. peacekeepers from an assortment of African_nations . A desperate campaign is under way to persuade the refugees not to stampede into Zaire . The effort is led by the_French and the United Nations , with cooperation from the victorious new government in Rwanda , installed by the rebel , Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front . But the defeated , Hutu-controlled government is mounting an equally vigorous propaganda campaign to propel the refugees into Zaire . In essence , two governments -- the old and the new -- are battling to control a substantial chunk of Rwanda ' s population . And this population , most of it poor , uneducated Hutu farmers , wants only its safety . The people of Zaire , meanwhile , are likewise pawns in a larger game of African politics . President Mobutu Sese Seko of this economically troubled nation has not resisted the refugee influx , despite its bitter toll on his people . Western nations cut_off most economic aid to the Mobutu government three years ago in frustration with his corrupt , authoritarian regime . But now Western nations find themselves at his doorstep , asking_for his help in the crisis . &quot; Everyone seems to think this is a real boon for Mobutu , &quot; said one Western diplomat . So far , Mobutu has not reached_out his hand for renewed Western assistance . &quot; But he will , you can be sure , &quot; said the diplomat .</TEXT>
