   <HEADLINE> MINOR TROUBLE BRIEFLY HAMPERS SATELLITE RELEASED BY SPACE SHUTTLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A gleaming , triangular satellite released by the crew of the space shuttle Atlantis on Friday sped around Earth sampling ozone and other atmospheric gases after ground controllers corrected its aim . The German satellite barely had begun observations when sunlight blinded a navigation unit on the craft , causing a telescope cover to slam shut . At the same time , the unit could not lock onto stars to point the spacecraft ' s telescopes because its field_of_view was too narrow . The trouble occurred when Atlantis and the satellite were out of radio contact , and about 17 miles apart , said mission manager Konrad Moritz . The two spacecraft are routinely out of contact for hours at a time . As soon as Atlantis and the satellite were back in contact , ground controllers sent up new pointing commands . It worked : The telescope door quickly reopened and observations resumed . About two hours of data were lost . One of the seven atmospheric and solar-energy monitors aboard Atlantis also ran_into trouble -- the data link between a German ozone monitor and ground controllers was lost Friday . The U.S. and European monitors began observations Thursday evening , just hours after Atlantis lifted_off . The satellite release -- one of the crew ' s primary jobs in orbit -- went perfectly . French astronaut Jean-Francois Clervoy unlatched the satellite from the end of Atlantis ' robot arm as the shuttle soared 190 miles above northern_Europe . Then commander Donald McMonagle slowly backed the shuttle away . Clervoy released the 7 # 500-pound satellite so gently that German ground controllers didn ' t detect any spin by the satellite and nervously called Mission Control to find_out what was wrong . They were assured all was_well . Researchers are controlling the satellite from the Kennedy Space Center during its eight days of free flight . The six-member crew will retrieve the satellite next Saturday for the trip home . Following the two-hour interruption , the infrared telescopes on the satellite continued measuring_up to 14 atmospheric gases per second , in three directions at once . Scientists hope to analyze these gases and their chemical_reactions between seven miles and 70 miles high . The $ 35-million satellite also holds an ultraviolet instrument to measure atmospheric gases responsible_for ozone damage . Robert Conway , a scientist at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington , was ecstatic with the early data . He began working_on the instrument in 1985 . &quot; It ' s been a long_time , and I ' m very excited , &quot; Conway said . &quot; It looks fabulous. &quot;</TEXT>
