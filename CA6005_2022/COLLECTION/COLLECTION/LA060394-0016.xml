   <HEADLINE> N . KOREA PUSHES IT TO THE BRINK ; KIM SEEMS TO BE DARING THE WORLD TO ACT IN NUCLEAR CRISIS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton is now facing his biggest foreign_policy crisis . North_Korea , breaking a written promise , has prevented international inspectors from examining the spent fuel rods it is withdrawing from its only operating nuclear_reactor . At a minimum , that action feeds worries that Kim Il Sung ' s regime is indeed covertly diverting plutonium to build its own nuclear_weapons . The refusal also effectively ends U.S. efforts to coax North_Korea into compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by offers of closer diplomatic ties and economic aid . The Administration ' s next step is to ask the U.N. Security_Council to impose economic sanctions . Kim ' s regime , now in its fifth decade of iron control , has already warned that it would regard sanctions as an act of war . Responsible world_powers may soon decide they have no choice but to test the threat implicit_in that declaration . Washington and South_Korea know the risks of confronting an antagonist as nuttily irresponsible as North_Korea . With a million-man army and with far more artillery pieces and tanks than the South_Korean army and the 38 # 000 U.S. troops that directly support it , Kim Il Sung could risk all on one roll of the dice and rapidly strike south , as he did 44 years ago this month . There is no chance that North_Korea could win a second Korean_war . But before it was thrown_back and militarily annihilated it could inflict enormous damage on Seoul , home to 25 % of South_Korea ' s 44 million people . It ' s this possibility that prompted the Clinton_Administration to seek a diplomatic solution to the challenge posed by the North 15 months ago when it announced it was quitting the NPT . All good-faith efforts have now failed . The International Atomic Energy Agency , along with Washington , has been repeatedly bamboozled . If North_Korea succeeds in making a mockery of the NPT , other nuclear aspirants -- Iran , Iraq , Libya -- will not be far behind . If North_Korea can build nuclear_weapons and put them aboard the medium-range missiles it is developing , South_Korea , Japan , much of China and parts of Russia will fall within its target zone . Pressures within South_Korea and probably Japan to go nuclear would be enormous . It won ' t be easy getting a U.N. Security_Council consensus on sanctions ; China and Russia both have expressed their distaste for such an approach . But with its economy a shambles , North_Korea could be highly vulnerable even to partial sanctions . If , for example , Japan acted to halt money transfers to the North from Koreans living_in Japan , Pyongyang ' s primary source of hard currency would be gone , and its ability to pay_for vital imports would shrink . President Clinton should promptly speak_to the American people , and to the world , about just how serious the threat now emanating from North_Korea is . He should candidly concede that there are grave risks in implementing sanctions . He should be no less clear in emphasizing that the ultimate risks of doing nothing in response are immeasurably greater .</TEXT>
