   <HEADLINE> MOST MAJOR CRIMES POST DECLINE , LUNGREN SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Atty . Gen . Dan Lungren said Friday that with the exception of homicide , the rate of major crimes reported in California decreased last year from 1992 levels . Lungren said the rate for violent crimes dropped 4.1 % , and the property crime_rate fell 3.3 % . Overall , criminal offenses tracked in the Department_of_Justice ' s California Crime Index decreased 3.5 % . Although homicide was up 3.2 % , rape was down by 9.1 % , robbery declined 4.8 % , and aggravated assault was down by 3.4 % , the attorney_general said . Burglary was down 4.5 % and motor_vehicle theft was down 1.6 % . California ' s crime_rate almost tripled between 1952 and 1980 , then began to decrease . Property crimes fell sharply , violent crime less so , until 1984 . After that , most categories generally leveled_off until last year ' s modest decline . Despite the downward trend -- perhaps obscured by the high-profile nature of so_much present-day criminal activity -- a Los Angeles Times exit poll on Election_Day last Tuesday turned_up crime as a leading concern of voters . It was mentioned as the No . 1 problem by more voters in the poll -- 37 % -- than any other in a list of problems affecting the state . Lungren said of the recent crime index findings : &quot; This report brings mostly good news , but this is no time to stop demanding tougher sentences for criminals. &quot; Lungren , who is seeking reelection , warned against current attempts to weaken tough anti-crime measures . He cited a move to restrict the state ' s &quot; three strikes &quot; law by sending criminals to prison for 25 years to life only if their third felony is a violent act . As it is , any third felony conviction mandates that sentence . Los Angeles Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti and the father of murder victim Polly Klaas have called_on Gov . Pete Wilson and the Legislature to place such a proposal , which is less costly , on the fall ballot . Wilson has said he will veto any such bill . &quot; Its easy to talk tough on crime , &quot; Lungren said . &quot; . . . And this year , nearly everybody will do_it . Watch the actions of your elected officials and see if it matches with their tough talk. &quot;</TEXT>
