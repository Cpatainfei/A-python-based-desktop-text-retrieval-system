   <HEADLINE> UNOCAL PLANS JOB CUTS AT 2 FACILITIES ; OIL : WORK_FORCE AT BREA LAB AND ANAHEIM PLANT WILL BE REDUCED BY AS MUCH AS 7 % OVER THE NEXT SIX MONTHS DUE TO A WORLDWIDE SLUMP IN CRUDE PRICES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Struggling to cope_with depressed world crude prices , Unocal Corp . said Thursday that it would shrink its Orange County work_force by as much as 7 % over the next six months . The international petroleum and chemical products giant said that &quot; changing market conditions &quot; have forced it to scale_down its research and development facilities in Brea and Anaheim , a move that will eliminate between 50 and 100 jobs . The job cuts are part of an overall corporate restructuring plan necessitated by an ongoing slump in oil prices that is not expected to change soon , said spokeswoman Janet McClintock . &quot; The purpose of this is not to save ' X ' amount of dollars this year , but to permanently realign the corporation , &quot; McClintock said . &quot; We are constantly looking_at how we do business and accepting change and adapting to it. &quot; McClintock said that those affected by the impending job cuts are employed at two Brea locations where the company ' s laboratory facilities are located , and its Anaheim plant , where it houses a computer_system that studies oil exploration data . Unocal has 1 # 100 workers in Brea and 170 in Anaheim . The company also has about 100 additional workers scattered throughout Orange County who will not be affected by the layoffs . Computer operators , laboratory technicians and administrative personnel will make_up the bulk of the job eliminations . Some of those employees study seismic data to determine rock structure and to locate possible underground oil reserves , while those in the laboratories study chemicals and data related to oil exploration and refining . McClintock said she did not know how many of the eliminated positions would result in layoffs . But she added that beginning next month the company will offer some workers new positions elsewhere in the company . &quot; We don ' t have that kind of information yet , &quot; McClintock said . &quot; There are still a lot unknowns that we still have not identified. &quot; As part of its restructuring , Unocal will outsource , or contract to outside firms , the seismic and laboratory work currently done_by its workers in Brea and Anaheim . &quot; Changing market conditions make outsourcing an attractive economic alternative , &quot; Charles R . Williamson , head of Unocal ' s Fred L . Hartley Research_Center in Brea , said in a prepared statement . The company will continue to study geochemistry , chemistry production , drilling techniques and seismic technology at the plant , but at a smaller scale . Unocal stock closed at $ 28 a share on the New York Stock_Exchange , unchanged from Wednesday .</TEXT>
