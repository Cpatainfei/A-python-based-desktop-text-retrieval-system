   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ALBUM ; CITY THAWS OUT FROM CITRUS FREEZE ; THE 1990 DISASTER SET_BACK PORTERVILLE . BUT SMALL-TOWN INGENUITY , CHARITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SLOWLY REVIVE THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY TOWN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Here in the citrus belt of the San Joaquin Valley , they call it nature ' s invisible disaster -- a December , 1990 , freeze that devastated the orange and lemon harvest and brought the farming communities of Porterville and Lindsay to their knees . The already high unemployment_rate jumped to 23 % . Out-of-work pickers , packers and truck_drivers couldn ' t buy groceries , much less pay utility bills swollen by 14 days of subfreezing temperatures . Silently , the freeze exacted a $ 1.5-billion toll . &quot; We didn ' t make the national news . We didn ' t have a fire or flood or earthquake or hurricane , &quot; Mayor Judi Gibbons said . &quot; People were suffering , but the nation didn ' t understand . It wasn ' t something you could make pictures out of. &quot; Like the young navel_orange trees left for dead that winter but budding new shoots each year since , this community of 34 # 000 has slowly come_back . Through small-town ingenuity and charity and aggressive economic development , Porterville has managed to stave_off a deeper crisis . Its resiliency has not gone unnoticed . For the second straight year , the National Civic League has named Porterville a finalist in the All-America City Award competition . Winners will be announced in Oakland next month . &quot; It ' s a symbolic award . No cash or anything like that , &quot; said Manny Azevedo , who will give a three-minute presentation to judges on a food_bank run entirely by senior_citizens . &quot; But it would mean a lot to people who have given a lot here. &quot; * Even before the record cold_snap , this Tulare County_town knew it was living dangerously . With an economy driven by the single engine of citrus farming , Porterville was always one drought or one hailstorm away from catastrophe . Diversification began in the 1950s with the opening of a state hospital , which remains the area ' s biggest non-agricultural employer . Then came several attempts to exploit the community ' s location -- 158 miles northeast of Los Angeles at the base of the Sierra_Nevada . But the slogan &quot; Gateway to the Sequoias &quot; only seemed to underscore that Porterville was a restroom on_the_road to mountain bliss . It wasn ' t until Wal-Mart located its West Coast distribution center here in 1991 -- 25 acres of warehouse under one roof -- that retailers began to take_heed . In quick succession came a Mervyn ' s and Target and Big 5 Sporting Goods and Wal-Mart store . The ribbon cuttings , while a source of great pride , were little salve in the midst of a freeze-related depression . Crop loss alone was $ 300 million . Fifty citrus packing_plants employing more_than 5 # 000 full-time and seasonal workers had shut_down . In a region where wealth has always concentrated in a_few grower hands and the unemployment_rate hovered at 16 % , the effect was immediate , if not always visible . More_than 30 # 000 weeks of unemployment were claimed in the three months after the freeze , compared to 1 # 600 weeks in the same period a year before . Food lines quadrupled . Hardest hit were Latino farm_workers , who account_for a quarter of the population . &quot; Many of the farm_workers were too proud for handouts , &quot; said Jim Vagim , a car_dealer who converted his warehouse into a food distribution center that served more_than 5 # 000 meals . &quot; They ' d park their cars a block or two away and send_in their children to eat. &quot; Helping Hand , another volunteer group , served nearly 90 # 000 meals that first year . Churches raised $ 76 # 000 to help laid_off workers pay their utilities . Dozens of seniors calling themselves the Porterville Gleaners marched into the fields with ladders and gleaned what they could from the blackened trees . Bartering with food_banks around the state , they traded oranges and lemons for 25-pound bags of groceries . Mayor Gibbons , who owns Brides ' n Belles on Main_Street , began outfitting weddings on credit . &quot; People get_married , crisis or not , so we fronted the money , sometimes $ 500 and $ 600 , &quot; she said . &quot; And all_of them paid . I never lost 5 cents to any one of them. &quot; * Last year , sales tax_revenues hit a new high : $ 3 million . Vagim is selling more used cars than ever . The Gutierrez family opened a fancy new Mexican restaurant on Main_Street called The Mission . Sears has returned . Wal-Mart ' s 1.2-million-square-foot warehouse now employs more_than 1 # 000 people . And huge houses continue to be built here , some by Southern California dairy_farmers who have moved operations to this side of the mountain . But times remain lean . A large market and Chevy dealership have closed . Not everyone loves the new Wal-Mart store , which has snatched away business from Porterville Hardware , a downtown mainstay , for one . At the Tulare County Lemon Assn . packing and shipping plant , manager Alex Teague says it will take another five good seasons before the grower cooperative rebounds completely from the &quot; lost year &quot; of the freeze . And $ 5-an-hour jobs continue to be lost to mechanization . A few weeks ago , as testimony to the freeze ' s far reach , the Porterville Gleaners opened a new food_bank warehouse built with $ 115 # 000 in local funds . The program has grown each year since 1991 and now handles 2.5 million tons of culled fruits and vegetables that it barters with food_banks in Oakland and Santa Maria and Bakersfield . &quot; We ' re not a Mickey_Mouse operation anymore , &quot; said the 76-year-old Azevedo . &quot; We take_care of a lot of people , about 1 # 200 families a week . I guess that ' s the thing about the freeze . We ' ve always been a tightknit community . Now we ' re even tighter. &quot;</TEXT>
