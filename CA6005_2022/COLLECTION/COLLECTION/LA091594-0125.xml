   <HEADLINE> TURNING_UP THE HEAT ON HAITI ; BUSH SPOKE OF HAITI THREAT , CLINTON NOTES ; SECURITY : GOP LEADERS HAVE CRITICIZED PRESIDENT . BUT HIS PREDECESSOR DID NOT RULE_OUT USE OF FORCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton , stung by Republican contentions that Haiti poses no national security threat , said Wednesday that President George_Bush repeatedly described the country ' s military dictatorship as a national security threat during the 1992 election campaign . In fact , in a Sept . 30 , 1992 , message to Congress on &quot; The National Emergency With Respect_to Haiti , &quot; Bush went even further . He declared , &quot; The assault on Haiti ' s democracy represented by the military ' s forced exile of President ( Jean-Bertrand ) Aristide continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security , foreign_policy and economy of the United States. &quot; White_House sources said that Clinton , who cited Bush ' s comments in an interview with wire_service reporters , probably will call attention to them in his speech to the nation at 6 p.m. PDT today seeking public support for the Administration ' s plan to invade Haiti if its military rulers fail to step_down . Polls show that the public overwhelmingly opposes an invasion , and Bush and many other Republicans , as well as some Democrats , have spoken out strongly against the Administration ' s invasion plans . Bush , although saying he does not &quot; want to be one more critic of our President , &quot; has several times taken_issue with Clinton ' s threatened invasion . In an Aug . 15 speech to a National Hardware Assn . convention , Bush accused Clinton of vacillating on issues , including Haiti , and declared that an invasion would only &quot; reawaken fears of gunboat diplomacy. &quot; And on Aug . 31 , when Clinton was turning_up the pressure on the Haiti dictatorship with threats of an invasion , Bush told a banking conference in Buenos Aires : &quot; We should not use force against Haiti. &quot; But when Bush was President , he did not rule_out the eventual use of force to oust the military regime . In an Oct . 4 , 1991 , news_conference , for example , he emphasized that the United States was committed to restoring democracy in Haiti and said , &quot; Let ' s hope that can be done without any kind of force. &quot; Another Republican critic of the invasion plan , Bush Secretary_of_State James A . Baker III , also hinted several times while he was in office that force might be used to oust the military_leaders . But Wednesday at a political dinner in Houston , Baker called the prospect of an invasion &quot; badly , badly misguided. &quot; Baker said Clinton had not answered three &quot; simple but critical questions &quot; : What is the compelling national interest in Haiti ? &quot; How are we going_to get_out &quot; after an invasion ? And why would the United States invade now , three years after Aristide ' s ouster ? Although Clinton ' s own credibility is at stake after so many threats to invade , a senior official insisted , &quot; Personal credibility is not involved . It is the credibility of the U.S._government and the United Nations. &quot;</TEXT>
