   <HEADLINE> SLAYINGS SPREAD ANGER , DISTRUST IN LITTLE HAITI ; INVESTIGATION : RESIDENTS SAY OFFICIALS IGNORE THE POLITICS BEHIND DEATHS OF 4 ARISTIDE SUPPORTERS IN MIAMI .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In Little Haiti , storefront rallies regularly spill into the street . Walls are replastered daily with fresh broadsides against enemies . Shade-tree discussions begin hot and grow hotter . Everything seems political . Especially murder . When Daniel Buron was gunned_down in front of a friend ' s house last week -- making him the fourth well-known supporter of exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to have been assassinated here since 1991 -- another wave of fear swept_through the enclave of 60 # 000 people . In the markets and barbershops , men and women talk passionately about the perils of speaking out and shake their heads over the tragedy of the bloodletting . But few express surprise . &quot; We are used to threats and to death , &quot; said Rolande Dorancy , executive_director of the Haitian Refugee Center . &quot; We have learned to live with that. &quot; The failure of the police to make any arrests in connection with the slaying of Buron , 31 , an outspoken political activist , has renewed concerns that solving murders in the Haitian community is not a high priority . The three earlier victims were all popular radio broadcasters . Although three arrests have been made in connection with those slayings , the triggermen have not been identified . &quot; If leaders in the Cuban community were being shot this way , the FBI and the White_House would be tripping over each other trying to solve this as a national priority , &quot; said Steven Forester , an attorney for the refugee center . &quot; But these are black Haitians , without political clout , and it seems like it ' s open season on exiles here. &quot; Buron was killed minutes after leaving an evening executive_council meeting of Veye Yo , a pro-democracy political group whose name means &quot; watch them &quot; in Creole . Standing_in front of a friend ' s house , Buron was talking to the friend and another man on March 9 when two gunmen approached on foot . Without a word , witnesses say , the strangers opened_fire with automatic weapons . Buron was hit several times . His two companions escaped injury by diving under a nearby car . Police say they are uncertain if Buron was an assassination target . Miami Police Detective George Gil says the two gunmen may have been would-be robbers who got scared , shot and ran . &quot; His activities were political , so people think the killing has to be political , &quot; Gil said . &quot; But we ' re getting very little information from the community on this . They are not talking. &quot; Haitians are often reluctant to talk to the police . &quot; The nature of the community presents language and cultural problems that make_it hard for the police to penetrate , &quot; said Father Tom Wenski , a Creole-speaking priest at Notre Dame d ' Haiti here . &quot; People don ' t have a lot of confidence in police because of their experience in Haiti. &quot; In Haiti , both uniformed police and irregulars such_as the Tontons Macoute have been brutal enforcers for oppressive regimes , including those of the Duvalier family and the current military government headed by the army commander , Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras . This week , diplomats and U.N. observers in Haiti reported that 75 people have been killed and their bodies mutilated recently in an effort to end support for Aristide , the elected president who was forced into exile in 1991 . The first murder of a prominent Haitian in Miami occurred in February , 1991 , the same month Aristide took_office . Radio personality Jean-Claude Olivier , 47 , was walking to his car from a nightclub when he was hit by three bullets . Twenty-five days later another well-known broadcaster , Fritz Dor , 33 , was killed outside his office in Little Haiti . The third broadcaster killed was Dona St . Plite , who was shot last October after a benefit for Dor ' s family . All three men were outspoken supporters of Aristide . Assistant State Atty . John Kastrenakas says that although the murders of Olivier , Dor and St . Plite were apparently carried_out by contract killers , the motives were related to local business dealings and not politics . Three men have been charged in connection with those killings , but none are accused of being a gunman or the person who paid_for the attacks . &quot; We know who the shooter is , but we don ' t have enough evidence to bring charges , &quot; Kastrenakas said . &quot; But I ' m not too worried because he ' s in jail on other charges. &quot; Kastrenakas says he is aware of the Haitian community ' s mistrust of police_investigations and understands the widespread belief that the killings are linked to politics here and in Port-au-Prince . &quot; If I were hoping to overthrow the government in Haiti , I would want to put_forward that theory , too , &quot; he said . &quot; I understand it , but that doesn ' t mean I support it . I don ' t deal in rumor and innuendo . There is just no evidence of politics here. &quot; People on the street do not accept that theory . &quot; Since Aristide ' s election , we have had so_much of this killing , &quot; said Jesse Mesidor , 26 . &quot; We are sure these are not accidents. &quot; Community leaders also say they find the prosecutor ' s version hard to accept . Many powerful figures in the Haitian military , including Cedras and Gen . Prosper Avril , own property , have family members and claim supporters in southern Florida . &quot; The prosecutor says this businessman , whose name they won ' t give , is a major drug dealer , &quot; Forester said . &quot; Well , people know that drug dealers are connected with powers that be in Haiti. &quot; Dorancy , whose name was_on a list of 36 people targeted in an anonymous death-threat letter mailed last fall to the refugee center , says the killings fit a pattern of intimidation being conducted here and in Haiti . In October , Dorancy ' s former nanny in Port-au-Prince was kidnaped and decapitated in a warning &quot; that they will kill me if I don ' t shut_up , &quot; she said .</TEXT>
