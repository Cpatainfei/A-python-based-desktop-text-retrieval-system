   <HEADLINE> INFLATION_RATE UP ONLY 2.7 % IN 1993 ; RETAIL SALES STRONG</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the first time since the mid-1980s , the nation ' s economy is facing the New Year with the best of both worlds in_store -- healthy growth with low inflation . According to government reports released Thursday , consumer prices last year crept_up at their slowest pace in seven years , while retail sales in 1993 posted their strongest gain since 1989 . The last time businesses from home builders to car_makers had such a promising economic outlook was in 1986 , when collapsing oil prices helped keep inflation low while the economy grew at a 3 % pace , about the same as now . The Labor_Department reported that the widely watched consumer_price_index , held_down by low energy and tobacco prices , rose only 2.7 % in 1993 , making the inflation_rate over the last three years the lowest since the 1960s . Meanwhile , the Commerce_Department reported that national retail sales -- led by home furnishings , autos and other durable goods -- rose 6.2 % to $ 2.08 billion in 1993 , a further sign that low interest_rates have boosted the housing market and purchases of everything from building_materials to furniture . The news was likely to further ease pressure on the Federal_Reserve_Board to stem inflationary pressures by raising interest_rates , economists said . Some analysts argue that raising interest_rates could derail economic_growth . The Clinton_Administration has maintained that interest_rates do not need to be raised because inflation is under_control . Overall , most economists expect that the nation ' s gross_domestic_product will show a healthy increase of about 3 % in 1993 when final figures are released later this month . The economic news is in part a validation of the Administration ' s policies , said Gene Sperling , deputy assistant to the President for Economic Policy in Washington . &quot; Our hope . . . was that if we had a strong but balanced deficit-reduction plan , that was seen as credible by the markets , we could keep interest_rates and inflation low , and that would spur the investment side of the economy , &quot; he said . &quot; And that is what is happening : It ' s very much an investment-led recovery. &quot; * Meanwhile , the Labor_Department also reported Thursday that the number of new claims for state unemployment insurance benefits fell 1 # 000 last week to 354 # 000 . The fall was smaller than expected , but economists added that overall job trends have been encouraging . The national figures on inflation and sales did not make distinctions among regions of the country , though economists believe that recession-racked California continues to lag the rest of the nation in recovery . But executives here believed the upturn nationally will eventually help pull the Golden State out of recession . Most analysts are predicting a turnaround in the second_half of 1994 . &quot; There is a significant spillover to companies situated in the Southern California market , &quot; said George H . Benter , president of City National_Bank in Los Angeles . &quot; We don ' t see an immediate turnaround for the market here , but they are positive signs for the future. &quot; Low prices are good news not only for consumers , but for businesses . &quot; When you have low inflation and high growth , it allows manufacturing companies to . . . provide more competitive products to the customer , &quot; said Michael C . Gibson , president of Moorpark-based Kavlico Corp. , maker of sensors for automotive , aerospace and industrial markets . &quot; The more competitive we can be when we ' re procuring , the more competitive we can be selling , and that . . . opens more markets . And that ultimately means more jobs , &quot; added Gibson , whose company is making a successful transition from defense contract work to commercial production . The CPI , which edged_up just 0.2 % in December on a seasonally adjusted basis , showed the slowest growth in 1993 since a 1.1 % increase in 1986 . In 1992 , the index rose 2.9 % , and in 1991 it rose 3.1 % , for an average rate_of_growth over the last three years of 2.9 % . &quot; This three-year period ( had ) the slowest rate_of_inflation over an extended period , since . . . the three years ending in 1967 , when the annual rate was 2.8 % , &quot; said Patrick Jackman , chief economist at the Labor_Department ' s Bureau of Labor Statistics . The inflation_rate is being held_in check by low energy prices , especially for crude_oil , which are at their lowest levels in years . Such low prices are likely to persist through much of 1994 , particularly if Iraq is allowed to resume shipments of oil onto world markets , Jackman said . Energy prices translate into transportation costs , which are passed_on to consumers . The core inflation_rate , which strips out volatile energy and food prices , rose 0.3 % in December and 3.2 % for the year -- the lowest level in 21 years . Food costs were up 2.9 % for the year . * The inflation news meant that the Fed could relax a little . On Thursday , John LaWare , a member of the Fed , reportedly said the central_bank ' s current monetary policy would be one of &quot; very watchful waiting. &quot; But &quot; it doesn ' t mean the Fed can shut_down its radar , &quot; said Robert G . Dederick , chief economist at Northern Trust Co . in Chicago . &quot; The economy has enough strength , and inflation is sufficiently alive , that they have to be concerned that the next step would be a worsening of inflation. &quot; Some analysts expect the Fed to bump short-term rates in the spring . The government reported that retail sales grew 0.8 % in December -- to a seasonally adjusted $ 180.6 billion , 6.9 % higher than sales in December , 1992 . That was stronger than the expected 0.3 % to 0.4 % , and marked the ninth straight month of increases .</TEXT>
