   <HEADLINE> RELEASE OF SILICONE STUDY DELAYED FOR YEARS ; HEALTH : INDEPENDENT EXPERT SAYS 1975 MICE TEST INDICATES SUBSTANCE IN BREAST_IMPLANTS IS VERY TOXIC . DOW CORNING DENIES PRODUCT HURT ANYONE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dow Corning Corp . waited almost two decades to disclose an internal study on mice that raised questions about the safety of its silicone breast_implants in the mid-1970s . But implant opponents and the company disagreed Thursday on whether the delay , or the research , even mattered . The debate came as lawyers moved forward with a multibillion-dollar settlement to resolve thousands of claims from women who blame implants for a variety of illnesses , including immune_system disorders . Dow Corning is among the companies that have signed the agreement , promising to pay women $ 2 billion over the next 30 years . Dow Corning denies implants hurt anyone . The latest dispute centers around a 1975 study involving mice and D4 , a purified form of silicone that is found in small amounts in implants . Company spokeswoman Barbara Carmichael said the study found that D4 did not harm the immune_systems of mice . Only when combined with a substance not found in implants did_it have a temporary , minor effect on the animals , she said . But an independent expert on silicone gel said the study showed that high levels of D4 were very toxic . In some cases , they killed the mice , said Dr. John Naim of Rochester ( N.Y. ) General Hospital . In the study summary , Dow Corning scientists wrote that D4 decreased the disease-fighting ability of immune cells in mice . Naim warned that the study does not necessarily translate to silicone gel implants , which contain lower levels of D4 . &quot; Is it relevant ? I don ' t know , &quot; he said . &quot; Is it at a low enough level ? that ' s certainly a legitimate defense. &quot; The corporation , once the largest maker of silicone implants , told the U.S. Food and Drug Administration about the study last year , in one paragraph of a letter discussing a 1993 study that found a possible link between implants and immune_system irregularities . &quot; This is not an effort to somehow hide stuff . We are interested in the public health and we are interested in discussing the science &quot; behind implants , Carmichael said . The FDA did not ask to see the 1975 study because Dow Corning ' s characterization made &quot; it not appear startling or significant , &quot; spokesman Jim O ' Hara said . But implant opponent Dr. Sidney Wolfe of the Washington-based Public Citizen Health Research Group said the study uncovered alarming effects of D4 that are apparent in his reading of the company ' s letter to FDA . &quot; FDA never asked Dow for the study , which is unconscionable , &quot; said Wolfe , who lobbied the agency to ban implants . &quot; This study really shows some things that haven ' t been shown in previous studies . It is an important study. &quot; Carmichael said Dow Corning was not obligated to turn_over the research because it was part of an effort to see if silicone could be used as a medicine and was unrelated to implants . The 1975 study was a follow-up to research done_in 1974 . The FDA could not immediately say whether the study was legally required , because the Medical Devices Act governing such research was not passed until 1976 . But O ' Hara said the company should have disclosed the study in 1991 , when the FDA held hearings on D4 and other components of implants . Had the company released the study in 1975 , Naim said , scientists might have launched objective research into the subject much earlier . The 1975 study came_to_light as lawyers for women prepared to go_to court against Dow Corning in the first federal trial involving breast_implants . The case had been set to begin this week in Birmingham , where U.S. District Judge Sam Pointer is presiding in more_than 7 # 000 lawsuits combined into one . The trial was delayed after Dow Corning and two other companies signed a $ 3.7-billion settlement agreement . Negotiations between the women ' s lawyers and companies , including 3M and many other smaller companies , continue this week . Stanley Chesley , a lawyer negotiating on behalf of the women , said lawyers on his side have known about the 1975 study for months . Such documents , which companies were forced to release as evidence , are the main reason corporations such_as Dow Corning agreed to the settlement , he said . &quot; There are documents against these manufacturers that are much worse , &quot; Chesley said . &quot; This is just the tip of the iceberg. &quot; Dow Corning contends that up_to 1 million women have received implants , but the women ' s lawyers say the number is closer to 650 # 000 .</TEXT>
