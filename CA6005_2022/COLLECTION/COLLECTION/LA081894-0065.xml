   <HEADLINE> SOCCER ; U.S. WOMEN WIN EASILY , EVEN WHEN IT GETS ROUGH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mia Hamm scored four goals as the U.S. women ' s national soccer team trounced Trinidad &amp; Tobago , 11-1 , in Montreal Wednesday night in a regional qualifying match for the 1995 FIFA Women ' s World Championship in Sweden . The game was a rough affair in which three players and Tony DiCicco , the U.S. assistant coach , were ejected . Afterward , DiCicco blamed Jamaican referee Charles Barrett for allowing the game to get_out of control . &quot; It was kind of a frustrating game , &quot; DiCicco said . &quot; It just got more and more nasty as the game wore_on . The official was totally oblivious to what was going_on out there . &quot; Our kids never retaliated . They were angry , ( so ) they didn ' t want to stop scoring on them . They felt they were hitting us with cheap shots . The referee never took_control of it. &quot; The United States opened the scoring in the fourth minute on a right-foot shot by Hamm off a pass from Tisha Venturini and was ahead , 5-0 , after 34 minutes . Trinidad &amp; Tobago then entered the record books by scoring the first goal against the United States in world championship qualifying play when Delia DeSilva beat goalkeeper Briana Scurry . In the first CONCACAF tournament in Haiti in 1991 , the Americans outscored their opponents , 49-0 , and had scored 14 goals without reply in Montreal before DeSilva ' s strike . Midway through the second_half , DeSilva took a swing at U.S. winger Carin Gabarra and a brawl erupted . Trinidad &amp; Tobago defender Margaret Andem had been red-carded in the first_half , and DeSilva and U.S. defender Thori Staples were ejected after the brawl . DiCicco was tossed_out shortly afterward for letting the referee know what he thought_of him in a rather colorful way . The U.S. team also got two goals apiece from Gabarra and Venturini and one each from Michelle Akers-Stahl , Christine Lilly and Amanda Cromwell .</TEXT>
