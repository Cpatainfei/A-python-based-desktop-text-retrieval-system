   <HEADLINE> PAYING THE PRICE OF DOING ' GOD ' S WORK ' ; SOMALIA : UNWILLING TO RISK U.S. LIVES , WE STRETCHED THE RULES AND SOMALIS DIED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The just-completed drawdown of the U.S. mission in Somalia has attracted scant notice . Yet before consigning Operation Restore Hope to the recesses of memory , Americans would do_well to consider how it is that their peacekeepers -- dispatched by President Bush to do &quot; God ' s work &quot; -- ended_up as likely to draw a bead on a Somali as_to feed him . Or her . Consider the following : On Jan . 9 , U.S. snipers in Mogadishu shot a Somali woman tending a stall in the city ' s marketplace . With few correspondents remaining in Mogadishu , even major newspapers carried at most a brief wire-service report of this incident . The woman , eight months pregnant , died . Her unborn child , in the carefully calibrated language of the AP dispatch , &quot; did not survive. &quot; According to an American spokesman , the shooting of the pregnant woman had been inadvertent . The intended target had been another Somali spotted with a machine_gun in a truck 500 yards from the Marine outpost . Since rules of engagement permitted U.N. forces to &quot; shoot anyone carrying a heavy_weapon &quot; in Mogadishu , the snipers were justified in taking him under_fire . It was simply happenstance that their fire had struck a bystander . Just bad_luck that the bystander was a pregnant woman . Truly unfortunate that she happened to leave six children behind . Later that month , another incident on a larger scale : Marines escorting a convoy opened_fire in a congested Mogadishu neighborhood , killing eight Somalis and wounding 12 . Accounts of what actually happened were inconsistent . A Bangladeshi officer at the scene reported that the American troops fired &quot; indiscriminately toward the crowd. &quot; U.S. authorities in Somalia defended the Marines , asserting that they had come under sniper fire and had responded in self-defense . Who will be held accountable ? The likely answer is no one . After all , the Marines acted_as their rules prescribed . The mission had become &quot; force protection &quot; -- doing whatever was necessary to preclude further American casualties . If those in the field are unlikely to be held accountable , then neither are the senior officials who devised Operation Restore Hope or those who have presided over its undoing . Certainly , those who ordered the intervention -- now comfortably retired -- never intended such ugly occurrences . As to their successors , they have long since redirected their attention to problems more pressing than those that beset the Horn of Africa . Assurances that all concerned behaved responsibly -- claims resting_on the legitimacy of the rules of engagement -- will provide cold comfort to the families of those gunned_down by peacekeepers . The real effect is to allow the Americans involved -- from the Marines at their observation_post all_the way back to the White_House -- to refuse responsibility for these acts . After all , everyone followed the rules . Yet there is no dodging responsibility . That these incidents elicited only a wisp of interest from news reporters may persuade some that the &quot; story &quot; in Somalia has reached its conclusion , effectively ended by President Clinton ' s decision to bring American forces home . In fact , an important story remains -- one that Americans ignore at their peril . The killing of these Somalis testifies to the illusion of altruistic interventionism in the post-Cold War era . It illustrates one of the consequences of committing U.S. forces to ambiguously defined peacemaking , peace enforcement or nation-building missions . Who will question the high ideals with which Americans embark upon such tasks ? Yet once good intentions collide_with the reality that American soldiers are at risk , preserving their lives becomes an overriding priority . that ' s the way the troops themselves and their commanders see it -- for all too understandable reasons . Unless some vital national interest is at stake , that ' s also the way the American people and their elected leaders are inclined to see it . Americans will always want to play by the rules . Yet , as the danger to American soldiers increases , those rules are subject_to change . Actions once deemed impermissible become acceptable . Concerns about noncombatant casualties diminish . Sensibilities are coarsened . The level of allowable firepower ratchets up . Justification is found even for the killing of innocents . This is not new . It is a recurring theme of American military history . Somalia has revived that theme . Should Americans assume responsibility for making_peace or rebuilding failed nations elsewhere , we will see it again . That prospect alone is not reason to refrain_from acting . But let us have the honesty to acknowledge the moral price to be exacted .</TEXT>
