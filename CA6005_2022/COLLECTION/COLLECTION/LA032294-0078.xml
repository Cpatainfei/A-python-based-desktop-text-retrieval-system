   <HEADLINE> INDICTMENT SAYS HARDING INVOLVED IN KERRIGAN PLOT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Tonya Harding , who escaped a jail sentence in a plea bargain last week , was in on the plot to attack rival figure skater Nancy Kerrigan , a Portland grand_jury concluded after more_than two months of investigation . An indictment issued Monday named Harding along with the four men who have admitted their roles in the crime . Harding was not charged in the indictment only because of her plea agreement , prosecutor Norm Frink said . Three men who have admitted carrying_out the attack -- Shawn Eckardt , Shane Stant and Derrick Smith -- were indicted . They pleaded innocent Monday to racketeering , conspiracy to commit assault , assault and unlawfully obtaining communications . The indictment said the three agreed with each other , Harding and her ex-husband , Jeff Gillooly , &quot; to unlawfully , intentionally and knowingly cause physical injury to Nancy Kerrigan by means of a dangerous weapon. &quot; Grand_jury foreman David Holt said he believed there was enough evidence to indict Harding for participation in the assault plot . &quot; Like Mr. Frink said , there was a great_deal of evidence pointing toward the fact that she was involved from the beginning or very close to the beginning , &quot; Holt said . &quot; I think she would have been indicted on all counts. &quot; He said he couldn ' t talk_about any specific evidence but that virtually all_the material the grand_jury had was made public . &quot; I believe she was so close to a lot of things that were going_on that there ' s no way she could not have known , &quot; Holt said . Harding has admitted helping to cover_up the plot but denies having knowledge of the attack . She pleaded guilty last week to conspiracy to hinder prosecution . In another plea bargain , Gillooly pleaded guilty Feb . 1 to one count of racketeering and is free pending sentencing . Eckardt also was indicted on charges of conspiracy to hinder prosecution and hindering prosecution . Smith also was charged with conspiracy to hinder prosecution . The communications charge stems from a secretly taped meeting involving those who participated in the conspiracy . Attorneys for Smith and Stant met with prosecutors and_Circuit Judge Phillip Abraham on Monday afternoon . Smith ' s attorney Clayton Lance said he was optimistic his client would reach a plea agreement . Eckardt and Smith were arrested Jan . 13 . Stant surrendered to authorities in Arizona the next day . All three remain free on bail . Eckardt , 26 , is Harding ' s 310-pound would-be bodyguard and a friend of Gillooly ' s since childhood . He has admitted helping to plan the attack and contacting Smith to carry it out . His attorney , Mark McKnight , said he expected the case to go_to trial . He said Eckardt admits to conspiring to assault Kerrigan but is not_guilty of racketeering . &quot; It is interesting that the person for whom all this was done received no jail and an enormous amount_of_money from a variety of sources , &quot; McKnight said . Meanwhile , Eckardt &quot; is now facing more jail time than any of the other players , &quot; McKnight said . Asked if his client is being set_up as the fall_guy , McKnight said , &quot; It ' s shaping_up that way. &quot; Stant , 22 , is Smith ' s nephew and shares his uncle ' s interest in paramilitary activity . Stant went_to Massachusetts to carry_out the attack , but when that plan fell_through he followed her to Detroit , where she was preparing_for the U.S. championships . On Jan . 6 , Stant struck Kerrigan above the right knee with a metal police baton , then escaped Cobo Arena by breaking_through a plexiglass window of a locked door . With Kerrigan out of the competition because of injury , Harding won the U.S. title . Smith , 29 , was the intermediary who funneled money from Gillooly and Eckardt to Stant and drove the getaway car . &quot; Prior to and certainly a short time after the attack I was numb , &quot; Smith said . &quot; I felt remorse , just , ' What have I done ? ' I wish I could go_back and live a_few hours over , even to_the_point of something catastrophic happening to myself. &quot; As part of Gillooly ' s plea agreement , prosecutors are recommending a two-year prison sentence and $ 100 # 000 fine . Under Oregon sentencing guidelines , Gillooly , who is free pending sentencing , would serve 19 months in prison . Harding spent the weekend in central Oregon on a ski trip . Despite her reported financial troubles because of her plea agreement and what must be huge attorneys ' fees , she was shopping for ski equipment on Sunday . Stant and Smith have established a telephone &quot; 900 &quot; number that a person can call and hear them talk_about the case . Smith said the information would be about Harding ' s involvement .</TEXT>
