   <HEADLINE> GASH FOUND IN AGING PIPELINE NEAR THE SITE OF MCGRATH SPILL ; INVESTIGATION : OFFICIALS SAY DISCOVERING THE 18-INCH SEAM TEAR BRINGS THEM NO CLOSER TO PINPOINTING THE CAUSE OF THE 84 # 000-GALLON OIL LEAK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Crewmen looking_for the source of a massive oil spill that leaked 84 # 000 gallons of heavy crude into McGrath Lake and the ocean found an 18-inch gash Monday in the seam of an aging pipeline buried beneath a Harbor Boulevard broccoli patch . State investigators discovered the lengthy tear in the oil line about 20 feet east of Harbor Boulevard -- across the street from where thick globs of crude_oil had accumulated before the pipeline was shut_off Christmas_Day . A 10-foot section of the ruptured pipeline was sawed off , cleaned_up and transported to the Ventura County Sheriff ' s Department . It will remain there until state officials choose which laboratory will perform metallurgical tests to be done on the pipeline . But despite finding the exact site where the eight-inch pipeline had broken , Bush Oil Co . and state officials said they are no closer to figuring_out why the leak occurred in the first place . Officials for Berry Petroleum of Taft , which owns Bush Oil , also on Monday were unable to explain how their employees failed to notice that 84 # 000 gallons of heavy crude did not make_it to their storage_tank for three days . They said earlier that the ruptured pipeline normally carried 600 barrels of oil a day and that 2 # 000 barrels of crude had leaked . The results of the metallurgical tests will take weeks or months to determine , said Robert Gorham , an engineer with the state Fire_Marshal ' s office . &quot; They ' ll be looking_for the type of pipe , the width , what the strength of the pipe is . . . to pinpoint what type of failure it is , &quot; Gorham said . * Meanwhile on Monday , traffic was backed_up along Victoria Avenue , Olivas Park Drive and Gonzales Road leading from the Harbor Boulevard excavation site after work crews closed_off the street , the California Highway Patrol said . Cleanup officials received permission to close the road at noon Monday after workers excavating the underground pipe complained that the traffic created a safety hazard . Harbor Boulevard will be closed again today and Wednesday between Olivas Park Drive and Gonzales Road from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. . &quot; We still have to decontaminate and clean_up the area down there , &quot; said Raymond Hatch , a Berry Petroleum spokesman . A state_Department of Fish and Game official said he is satisfied that the rupture found on Monday is the only gash in the aging pipeline . &quot; As far as we are concerned , this rupture is the sole cause of the leak , &quot; said Fish and Game spokesman David Blurton , who said there is no early indication of what may have caused the rupture . Blurton said his office would not require Bush Oil to remove the rest of the pipeline , but Hatch said late Monday that he expects the oil_company to drag the pipe from underneath Harbor Boulevard anyway . &quot; We ' re going to take_out the line under the road , &quot; Hatch said . &quot; It ' s going_to be pressure-tested to make_sure there are no more leaks. &quot; Hatch said the company has not yet decided when or if the line would be replaced . Dozens of gallons of thick crude_oil spilled into the ditch when workers uncovered the 18-inch casing that surrounds the pipeline . Much of it was vacuumed up by late Monday , but workers also used more_than 100 cubic_feet of an organic industrial absorbent to soak_up the oil . Large pools of crude_oil were visible in the brush_on the west_side of Harbor Boulevard , where workers had toiled since Sunday to clear an area big enough for cleanup crews to enter . There was no change reported Monday in the number of migratory and shore_birds that have died since the spill , which is Ventura County ' s worst pipeline break_in decades . Officials said Monday that 138 birds have died so far and another 28 oil-tarred birds are near death . According to a Dec . 30 report from the city of Oxnard , 80 % of McGrath Lake -- the area where the bulk of the 84 # 000 gallons of oil was found -- is inside city_limits . Community Development Director Richard Maggio outlined the spill and cleanup effort as part of a weekly briefing to the City_Council . The report was issued after some early confusion about which law_enforcement agency was responsible_for the area . * At least six public agencies -- including the Oxnard Police_Department -- received reports about leaking oil a full day before a federal_officials saw offshore oil_slicks Christmas morning . &quot; I don ' t know which particular map the dispatchers were using at the time , but I can certainly see the confusion , &quot; Oxnard City_Manager Thomas Frutchey said . &quot; You ' ve got_to have a pretty accurate map to determine boundaries. &quot; Oxnard Police_Chief Harold Hurtt said Monday that his department could have used more detailed information when his dispatcher first heard the oil spill report on Dec . 24 . &quot; If we had more knowledge as_to the exact location and we thought it was in our area of responsibility , we would respond to it , &quot; he said . &quot; The best way to make_sure is if it ' s close to the city , we ' ll make the call. &quot;</TEXT>
