   <HEADLINE> STRAWBERRY : LOST , FOUND AND OUT ? ; BASEBALL : DODGER SLUGGER SKIPS FREEWAY SERIES FINALE FOR UNDISCLOSED REASONS . CLAIRE CALLS EXCUSE UNACCEPTABLE AND HIS FUTURE WITH TEAM IS IN DOUBT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Darryl Strawberry , missing for nearly 24 hours , was located in apparently good_health late Sunday , but his career with the Dodgers appears to be over . In a sudden turn_to what the Dodgers had hoped would be a promising season for the troubled outfielder , Strawberry failed to show_up for Sunday ' s game against the Angels at Anaheim Stadium . Attempts to locate him proved futile until about 8 p.m. , when Strawberry spoke_to Executive_Vice_President Fred Claire . Afterward , Claire issued a terse statement , calling Strawberry ' s action inexcusable . &quot; I have spoken_to Darryl and he is with his family , &quot; Claire said in a prepared statement . &quot; I am not satisfied with the explanation he has given me for his failure to report for the game today . I intend to meet with Darryl ( today ) to review the_matter in detail and to determine what the appropriate disciplinary action will be . This type of behavior is extremely detrimental to the ballclub and will not be tolerated. &quot; Sunday ' s incident is the latest in a series of troubles Strawberry has endured with the Dodgers since signing a $ 20.25-million contract before the 1991 season . At the very least , his future with the team is in doubt . The Dodgers owe Strawberry $ 8 million for two years , including this season , but his contract could be voided if he breached a standard good-behavior clause . The reason for his absence was not disclosed . Either way , Claire said late last year that one more incident by Strawberry would not be tolerated . That sentiment was precipitated by last season ' s numerous problems . Strawberry , trying to come_back from back surgery , had a dismal time on the field as well as off it . In September , he was arrested for allegedly assaulting his girlfriend , Charisse , now his wife . The charge was later dropped . But after a season of disregarding rules concerning his rehabilitation , Claire had had enough . He began to shop Strawberry as early as August before the trading deadline and continued throughout the rest of the season . After Strawberry showed disrespect for Los Angeles fire victims last November , Claire put Strawberry on the waiver wire , making him available to any team for $ 20 # 000 , plus his remaining contract . There were no takers . That move seemed to shake_up Strawberry , who once again in his tumultuous , 11-year career , rededicated himself . Since then , he has shown a strong work ethic , so_much so , that he even was an example for teammates . During the spring , he was often the first one to arrive_at the clubhouse and one of the last to leave . &quot; My guess is as_good_as yours , &quot; said Dodger Brett Butler after hearing Claire ' s statement . &quot; I look_at the spring and it looked_like change , it looked positive and upbeat . I thought things were ready to go. &quot; In December , Strawberry , 32 , married Charisse Simon , and they recently had a son , Jordan Shay . He talked_about his hope and confidence that he would once again be dominating on the field . And his health appeared fine . The Dodgers moved him from right_field to left field to help ease the stress on his back from throws , and he was starting to hit the ball hard . But Friday night , in his debut at Dodger Stadium after not playing since June of 1993 , he was booed by the fans . It started in the first inning when he misplayed a ball for an error , allowing a runner to score , and continued as he went_for 4 . After the game , Strawberry said the booing didn ' t bother him . Then Saturday night , he hit a homer run_over the right_field fence . After the game , teammates said he appeared happy . So , when he didn ' t show_up for Sunday ' s game , the players were concerned . Claire continued throughout the day to try to locate Strawberry , but attempts were unsuccessful . Charisse Strawberry told the Dodgers she hadn ' t seen him since Saturday night , but was expecting him after Sunday ' s game for a family function . &quot; I just hope he ' s all_right , &quot; said Delino DeShields , who has become good friends with Strawberry during the spring . &quot; I ' m thinking_of his health . The man ' s got a family . He ' s got children . Regardless of what happens he ' s still going_to be my friend. &quot; Since breaking_into the majors with the New York Mets in 1983 , Strawberry has continually been plagued with controversy . In the spring of 1990 , he entered an alcohol rehabilitation clinic and acknowledged hitting his first wife , Lisa . Most recently , Strawberry has been the target of an IRS probe of several baseball_players for failing to report income_tax from card shows . But Marty Gelfand , Strawberry ' s attorney , said Sunday night that there has been no action taken by the IRS . &quot; Whatever happened ( Sunday ) has nothing to do with the IRS tax investigation , &quot; Gelfand said .</TEXT>
