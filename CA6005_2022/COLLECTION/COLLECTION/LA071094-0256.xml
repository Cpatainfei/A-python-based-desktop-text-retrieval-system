   <HEADLINE> OLYMPIC FESTIVAL ; NEW COACH MEANS NEW ATTITUDE FOR WATTS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Everything was great . Quincy Watts was in high_gear , sprinting through an account of his rebirth as a dedicated and responsible track_star , when his coach interrupted in mid-sentence . &quot; You are not in great shape , &quot; Bob Kersee said . &quot; OK , &quot; Watts countered . &quot; I feel great. &quot; Sitting beside her husband at an Olympic Festival news_conference late last week , Jackie Joyner-Kersee smiled knowingly . Even with the most minor details , it ' s Bob ' s way or the highway . Watts was learning quickly . Four months ago , Watts , the 1992 Olympic 400-meter champion , left coach John Smith and put himself under Kersee ' s tutelage -- and his alert eyes and ears . &quot; can ' t get_away with anything anymore , &quot; Watts said . Indeed , that ' s one of the reasons he said he made the coaching switch . Watts , who will run a leg in the Olympic Festival 4 X 400-meter relay at Southern Illinois University today , is coming_off a disappointing 1993 season that many track experts attribute to his being out of shape . With his weight near 215 pounds , Watts was fourth in the World Championships in Stuttgart , Germany , struggling to the finish after_part of his shoe came loose . The broken shoe heel allowed Watts a ready-made excuse , but he knew better . The celebrity of being Olympic champion was slowing him down . &quot; I had to learn time management , &quot; he said . &quot; I was letting what I was doing off the field interfere with my track time. &quot; Watts , NCAA 400-meter champion for USC in 1992 , stopped short of blaming Smith for his downfall but said , &quot; There comes a point where an athlete hits a dead stage and he needs something new , or somebody new , to motivate him. &quot; Kersee , Watts said , gets after him &quot; about three times a week. &quot; Whatever works . Despite fighting a series of nagging minor injuries , Watts weighs 197 pounds , the same as two years ago at a similar stage in the season . &quot; I ' m way ahead of last year , &quot; he said of his conditioning . With more intense training ahead , Watts anticipates competing in the Goodwill Games in St . Petersburg , Russia , later this month at about 195 pounds , his &quot; fighting weight. &quot; Watts was held_out of the U.S. nationals in Knoxville , Tenn. , last month , but he has pronounced himself fit enough to run a sub-44-second leg in today ' s relay . In the 1992 Olympics , Watts ran a 43.1 -- the fastest relay leg ever -- as the U.S. team wiped_out the oldest_world record in the books . He hasn ' t regained that form yet , but he ' s getting there . And still only 24 , he figures to have several prime years left . &quot; I ' ve learned not to put my track secondary to anything anymore , &quot; Watts said . &quot; This is what I do . This is the way I make a living. &quot; Now rejuvenated , Watts finds himself motivated in a year with no World Championships or Olympics . &quot; I ' m already looking_forward to next year , &quot; he said , &quot; but it ' s still exciting for me now . I come_out to work and I ' m excited . I get pushed every day . &quot; It may be an off year for everybody else , but it ' s an interesting year and a fun year for me because I ' m being taught a different philosophy and approach. &quot; Notes In track , Ronnie Harris of Rialto won the men ' s 5 # 000-meter race in 13:52.62. Other medal_winners included Rodney Lewis of Los Angeles , a silver in the 100 meters , 10.28 ; Devon Edwards of Los Angeles , a silver in the 400 meters , 45.76 ; and Crystal Irving of Long_Beach , a bronze in the 400 meters , 53.10. . . . In judo , Amy Liou of Granada Hills , Christine Shiosaki of Torrance and Yvette Gray of North Hollywood won bronze medals . . . . Jason McEntee of Loyola Marymount and Neil Mendel of Cal State Long_Beach played key roles as the North defeated the East , 16-14 , 8-15 , 15-12 , 17-15 , in the gold-medal men ' s volleyball match . McEntee had 25 kills and 13 digs . Mendel added 12 kills , 11 digs and a team-high five blocks . . . . In weightlifting , Bill Gabriel of Costa Mesa won the silver medal in the 182 3 / 4-pound class with a career-best 617 1 / 4-pound total .</TEXT>
