   <HEADLINE> WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS : VENTURA ; MIDDLE_SCHOOL TO BUILD HIGH-TECH LAB</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Balboa Middle_School in Ventura will become the third in the city to build a new high-tech lab to teach students computer-aided_design and other skills . Four Rotary_clubs in Ventura have contributed a combined $ 5 # 200 that , along with state and federal funds , will allow Balboa to complete a lab for its &quot; Exploration in Technology &quot; program . Two other Ventura middle_schools -- DeAnza and Anacapa -- already have technology labs . A fourth middle_school , Cabrillo , is probably next in_line in the district to receive funding for such a lab , officials said . Designed to introduce young students to some of the latest uses of robotics , electronics and computers , the technology labs at Ventura ' s middle_schools are essentially an updated version of shop classes . Instead of teaching students to build objects entirely by hand as in shop , students in technology labs use computers to design items ranging from model race_cars to miniature wood bridges . With some of the machinery in the labs , students are able to design computer_programs that actually drive the power_tools to build mallets or other small wood objects , Balboa Principal Hank Robertson said .
