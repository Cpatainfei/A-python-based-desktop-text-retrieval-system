   <HEADLINE> SIR SPEEDY TO OFFER PHOTO , DOCUMENT CD SERVICE ; TECHNOLOGY : THE LAGUNA HILLS-BASED QUICK-PRINT CHAIN WILL JOIN WITH KODAK TO OFFER BUSINESSES AN ALTERNATIVE TO SLIDES OR VIDEOCASSETTES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Eastman Kodak Co . plans to announce today that Sir Speedy Inc. will be among the first quick-print chains to launch a service that puts images and documents on compact_disks for business presentations . Kodak and Sir Speedy are betting that the Photo CD Portfolio system will find a ready market among companies that want an affordable alternative to slides or videocassette tapes . The CD system works this way : Pictures and documents are scanned by computer , then arranged on disks . The data can then be organized in a number of ways for different audiences , with graphics as well as audio tracks of narrative and music added as desired . Each disk can hold the equivalent of 100 color photographs , 500 floppy_disks or 250 # 000 pieces_of_paper , Kodak and Sir Speedy said . Sir Speedy officials said they have not yet set prices for the CD service . Kodak spokesman Paul McAfee said companies that now provide slide trays to their sales representatives could save money by switching to CDs , which he said are cheaper to reproduce . And the CD format can be customized , he said , so that the full version could be presented to a purchasing manager and a condensed version to a chief_executive . Another advantage of CDs over regular videocassettes is that quality does not erode with age and usage , McAfee said . The CD system is &quot; a very inexpensive way to put_together a custom presentation , with custom text and a variety of choices on how to play it back , &quot; McAfee said . Sir Speedy , based in Laguna Hills , plans to make the Kodak CD technology available at 321 Sir Speedy and Copies Now shops nationwide , including nine in Orange County . Other chains will offer the CD system at about 30 locations combined . The official announcement of the agreement between Kodak and Sir Speedy is to be made today at the MacWorld Expo ' 94 computer conference in San Francisco . Kodak , in conjunction with photo finishers , has had a system available for more_than a year that allows consumers to put their photos on disk so they then can be viewed on TV screens by using a special player or on personal_computers equipped with CD-ROM_drive . Sir Speedy will take marketing of the technology a step further , setting_up centers within its existing outlets to cater to a business clientele . The Sir Speedy locations offering the CD system in Orange County are in Anaheim , Huntington Beach , Los Alamitos , Newport Beach , Tustin and two outlets in Santa Ana . Copies Now locations are in Costa Mesa and Irvine . &quot; For a long_time , Sir Speedy has been_on the leading edge of business-printing technology , &quot; said Don Lowe , president of the chain . &quot; We see the CD as a communications tool for the turn of the century. &quot; Sir Speedy has 880 printing and copy centers in 12 nations around the world . Its revenue was $ 377 million for 1992 and is projected at $ 425 million for 1993 . Sir Speedy said it is not sure how much the new CD service will add_to revenue for the coming year .</TEXT>
