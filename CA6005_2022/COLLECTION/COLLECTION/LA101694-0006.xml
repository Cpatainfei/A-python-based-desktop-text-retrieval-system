   <HEADLINE> YOSSARIAN , 30 YEARS LATER ; ' CATCH 22 ' DEFINED A GENERATION ' S VIEW OF WAR . NOW HELLER REACHES BEYOND WAR TO TACKLE DEATH ; CLOSING TIME , BY JOSEPH HELLER ( SIMON &amp; SCHUSTER : $ 24 ; 464 PP. )</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In 1962 , Joseph Heller took war to the surreal limits of its twisted , death-obsessed logic . &quot; Catch-22 ' s &quot; hero , the bombardier Yossarian , wanted only to get_back home , back to where he would be safe ; he wanted the war to end , he wanted out . After surviving his own near-fatal illness and now past 70 , Joseph Heller doesn ' t find home so safe anymore , and he can ' t let the war end . It ' s the only thing that makes_sense . The war isn ' t absurd any more , it ' s the world that has gone mad . In &quot; Closing Time , &quot; Yossarian ' s contemporary journey through &quot; normal &quot; life gets the full Heller comic treatment , which has by now worn thin . But what redeems this novel is Heller ' s retelling of &quot; Catch 22 &quot; ( and , for good measure , that other darkly comic World_War_II classic , Kurt Vonnegut ' s &quot; Slaughterhouse-Five &quot; ) . This time Heller tells the war straight . When he isn ' t trying to be funny he renders it with piteous , realistic , at times stunning , power . Having once decided that realism was inadequate to convey the absurdity of war , Heller has now , as death comes_in its normal , quotidian way , realized that the final absurdity is life itself . &quot; Nowhere in his lifetime , Yossarian was bound often to remember , not in wartime Rome or Pianosa or even in blasted Naples or Sicily , had he been spectator to such atrocious squalor as he saw mounting_up all around him. &quot; The main characters of &quot; Closing Time &quot; all survived the war , so it has become a strangely comforting refuge for them : the moment they defeated death . But &quot; Closing Time &quot; smells more like death than &quot; Catch 22 &quot; ever did . It ' s not the smell of cordite , but of urine-soaked sidewalks and the disinfectant of hospital corridors . Like &quot; Death in Venice , &quot; &quot; Closing Time &quot; is an old_man ' s story . The characters keep giving parting advice to their wives and children : Read Camus , buy real_estate . But it ' s not clear that anyone listens . Their children are clueless , the world is a wasteland . Everything is less now . Coney_Island is a hellacious slum . The towers of Rockefeller Center seem smaller . The heroes of the past , the kids who went_off to defeat Hitler , are shriveling away . Their era is coming_to an end . As old_men often do , Heller makes his own impending end synonymous with the end of the world . &quot; Closing Time &quot; interweaves two journeys . Yossarian is obsessed with dying . He happens to be in perfect health , which is the bad news , since that means he can only get_worse . He becomes a wisecracking , priapic , hypochondriac Siegfried on a mythic / comic descent -- ' my Rhine journey &quot; -- into hell , which is located both in and beneath the Port Authority Bus_Terminal ( the PABT ) . Compared to the PABT , with its crack-heads promising vile acts for cash , the hell underground is a pretty nice place , complete with rides from the Coney_Island of Heller ' s youth . The plot of this journey is loosely constructed around Yossarian organizing a society wedding at the PABT for Milo Minderbinder ' s daughter and helping Milo sell the &quot; M &amp; ME &amp; A Sub-Supersonic Invisible and Noiseless Defensive Second-Strike Offensive Attack Bomber. &quot; &quot; It won ' t work . Right M2 ? &quot; Yossarian asks Milo ' s son . &quot; We guarantee it. &quot; Well , it doesn ' t quite turn_out that way . His journey takes Yossarian across the River_Styx ( the old Coney_Island Tunnel of Love ) into the Land of the Dead , where he meets everyone from Gen . Leslie Groves of the Manhattan_Project to Sylvia Plath . From time to time he wonders whatever happened to Little Sammy Singer , the unnamed tail gunner from &quot; Catch 22 &quot; who kept passing_out over Avignon while Yossarian was trying in vain to save the life of Snowden , the mortally wounded waist gunner . As it happens , Singer thinks_about Yossarian all_the time . They haven ' t seen each other since the war , and in &quot; Closing Time &quot; their lives finally converge . The second journey in the book is that of Little Sammy and his boyhood friend Lew Rabinowitz , who was in the infantry in Europe . For Lew , the war meant being a POW in Dresden , a tough Jew confronting his Nazi guards in German . Here he is coming_out of the bunker after the bombing of Dresden : &quot; In the morning when they led us up outside into the rain , everyone else was dead . They were dead in the street , burned black into stubs and turned brown by the ash still dropping from the layers of smoke going_up everywhere . They were dead in the blackened houses in which the wood had all burned and dead in the cellars . The churches were gone and the opera_house had tilted over and fallen in the square . . . all around us , as far as we could see , everyone was dead , men , women , and children , every parrot , cat , dog and canary. &quot; Sammy and Lew talk_of putting their lives together after the war and their battles with age and sickness with simple , moving elegance . Sammy went_to work for Time and led a careful , circumscribed life . Lew , the tough_guy , made the junk business work but can ' t fight the cancer eating_away at his strong body . Sammy ' s wife has died and he has lost his job , so he visits Lew in the hospital and talks_about old times , about Coney_Island and the war . Lew thinks to himself , &quot; I ' m beginning to feel , like my father felt when he got old , and his brother too , that this time things are beginning to come_to an end. &quot; Yossarian and Singer are reunited at Lew ' s bedside . The meeting is a classic of two old veterans trying to sort through the fog of the past to return to the crystalline moments that united them forever . &quot; It ' s funny about Snowden , &quot; Singer hesitated . &quot; I didn ' t know him that well. &quot; &quot; I ' d never noticed him. &quot; &quot; But now I feel_like he was one of my closest friends. &quot; &quot; I have that feeling too. &quot; The recollections of the war play beneath the operatic , absurdist contemporary story like subtitles . Memory works its way to the surface like bits of shrapnel from old wounds . These stories are told with power , wisdom , directness and great strength . When it simply tells these stories , this book is disturbingly real and smart . When it tries to be funny , it is too often contrived and dumb . The virtuoso wordplay , the hidden erudition , the inside jokes ( Joseph Kaye , &quot; a good soldier named Schweik , &quot; Kurt Vonnegut and even Joey Heller himself appear , among others ) wear_thin . Yes , the Thomas Mann references are interesting , yes , the operatic themes pay_off , and yes , it is fun to follow all_the references_to other novels and movies , from Kafka to &quot; Doctor Strangelove &quot; and even including this one : &quot; Then it ' s just like Catch 22 , isn ' t it ? &quot; ' the Vice_President blurted_out . . . . &quot; I can ' t appoint a chief_justice until I ' m the president , and he can ' t swear me in until I appoint him . Isn ' t that a Catch 22 ? &quot; The reader often wishes for an editor , just to keep the story going and to cut_out the bad jokes , the repetitions and the tedious explanations of what we have just read . But for all that , the mythic dimensions of what Heller is trying to accomplish commands respect . In &quot; Catch 22 &quot; Heller made us look_at war in a new way . In &quot; Closing Time &quot; he does the same with death . It ' s an even harder job , because the people we send_on missions to find_out about it don ' t come_back . Heller is determined to get beneath the surface : of New York , of our memories , of life itself . He fails . But not from lack of trying . Heller has taken_on the big stuff , gone_into the ring , as Norman Mailer might have said , with the big heavyweights : Homer , Joyce , Dante , Goethe , Mann . You do that , you ' re going to take a_few hits . The great irony is that the war here stands_for life , for what is worth clinging_to . And all around him , in the wreckage of our civilization , Yossarian and his generation see only death . No matter how much he works_at it , Heller just can ' t make that funny . It is , truly , &quot; Closing Time. &quot; Lights out . * TimesLine : 808-8463 To hear Joseph Heller reading from &quot; Closing Time , &quot; call TimesLine and press * 7818 Call TimesLine from area_codes 213 , 310 , 714 , 818 or 909 .
