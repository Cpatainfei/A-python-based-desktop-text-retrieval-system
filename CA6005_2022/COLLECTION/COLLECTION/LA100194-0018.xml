   <HEADLINE> INDIA PANIC GROWS WITH NUMBER OF PLAGUE CASES ; HEALTH : OFFICIALS SAY THE EPIDEMIC IS UNDER CONTROL . BUT CITIZENS AND OTHER NATIONS ARE SKEPTICAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The nurses do not dare enter Ward No . 7 at the Infectious_Diseases Hospital where S.K. Tyagi is now confined . The equally fearful orderlies leave his food at the door instead of carrying it to his bed . The 26-year-old Indian accountant , along with 107 other suspected plague victims in New Delhi , has been assigned to a hospital that is supposed to be expert in treating the dreaded disease . But he has quickly grown dubious . &quot; Dr. Singhal is the only person who is handling the cases , &quot; Tyagi said Friday as he sat on his unkempt bed in the dim ward with dirty yellow walls , his mouth and nose covered with a paper mask to prevent him from transmitting the deadly bacillus by coughing or sneezing . &quot; Nurses don ' t come here ; they ' re scared they ' ll get the plague. &quot; The 150-bed hospital ' s harried medical superintendent , Dr. Ram Chandra Panda , used one word to describe India ' s general reaction to the recent outbreaks of bubonic and pneumonic_plague : &quot; phobia. &quot; &quot; It ' s under_control , &quot; the doctor maintained Friday . But across India , ordinary citizens , politicians and even medical personnel are showing by their actions that they do not believe such assurances . Abroad , many countries have begun treating India as a public health pariah by banning travel_to and from there or requiring incoming passengers from Bombay or New Delhi to submit to special health_checks . &quot; There is some overreacting , &quot; said Dr. Narayan K . Shah , representative of the World_Health_Organization in India . On Thursday , the U.S. State_Department said the risk of plague infection for international travelers is low . But at Los Angeles International Airport , federal health officers began handing_out warnings to passengers arriving from India to watch for signs that they may have been exposed to the disease . Ten days after a pneumonic_plague epidemic began killing people in the industrial city of Surat in western India , the New Delhi-based National Institute of Communicable Diseases reported a total of 2 # 171 suspected plague cases nationwide from Surat to Calcutta , 1 # 000 miles away . The government institute ' s control_room said there had been 45 deaths , but was apparently not aware of an 18-year-old man and a 5-year-old boy in New Delhi who the Health Ministry on Friday confirmed had succumbed to plague at the All India Institute of Medical_Sciences . Those two deaths were the farthest yet from the diamond-cutting and artificial-silk weaving center of Surat , 560 miles southwest of Delhi . Although a vaccine and an antibiotic cure exist , few illnesses can match the plague for the atavistic reaction of fright that it produces . Though the number of suspected cases rose by more_than 600 in the 24-hour period ending at 5 p.m. Friday , Shah said the progression was slow enough so he could predict that India ' s first large-scale outbreak of plague in 28 years will have subsided within three or four weeks . &quot; There ' s nothing to panic about , &quot; Shah said . &quot; First the number of cases will rise , and then it will go_down . This epidemic will go away. &quot; But in New Delhi , the capital ' s wary leaders ordered schools and movie_theaters closed effective Friday as a way of minimizing transmission through public contact . Schools had been scheduled to close Oct . 5 anyway for Hindu religious_holidays . The New Delhi government also arranged for 500 more beds at a hospital usually used for victims of tuberculosis , and Chief Minister Madan Lal Khurana ordered the members of his Cabinet to personally supervise a crash cleanup effort . WHO ' s Shah said the emergency campaign to rid chronically filthy neighborhoods of rotting piles of garbage was not necessary on purely epidemiological grounds . The pneumonic strain of the plague , believed to have been spread by people fleeing from Surat , is transmitted by coughing , sneezing and human sputum , he said , unlike the better-known bubonic variety , which is transmitted by fleas that live_on infected rats . Of greater concern to health_professionals is how the suspected plague sufferers in Delhi , 21 of whom have been proven so far to have the disease , contracted it . More_than half are not from Surat or the nearby state of Maharashtra , home to a separate epidemic of bubonic_plague that broke_out in early August . To track_down carriers of the bacillus , booths staffed by doctors have been set_up at Delhi ' s railway_stations and bus_terminal to look_for people with coughs and fevers who are coming from Surat or Bombay , Maharashtra ' s capital . But conversations with Tyagi and his bedmates in Ward No . 7 showed how late authorities were in reacting . Tyagi , who kept the books at a Surat iron_foundry , was able to catch the train to Delhi from the plague-stricken industrial city Sunday . It was only the following day , he said , that police began to ask people streaming out of Surat where they intended to go . Confirmed plague carrier Lala Babu Rai , who made and sold suitcases , fled Surat in a train so jammed that he and five other people had to stand_for the entire trip -- in the lavatory . By the time he reached Delhi , the thin , 35-year-old artisan had such a high fever and was coughing so hard that he hired a rickshaw to take him to the hospital . Many have criticized the authorities of India and of Gujarat , the state where Surat is located , for not moving faster to stop the exodus of as_many as 400 # 000 people . One duty officer at Delhi ' s Infectious_Diseases Hospital , Dr. S.K. Chadha , said some of his fellow physicians , as well as the press , also deserved criticism for their actions . &quot; More panic has been created than the real problem , &quot; Chadha said . &quot; I blame doctors , who are just scared and are sending their patients here to the IDH if they have a simple cough and fever , or even tuberculosis , rather than examining them . And in the beginning , the press gave such news : ' Delhi is in the grip of the plague. ' But it ' s not . All the stories in the papers have wreaked panic . Even the members of my family are scared. &quot; So , reportedly , were many Surat doctors , who fled the city . Dr. Jagdish Sobti , general secretary of the Indian Medical Assn. , said many of his Indian colleagues knew little or nothing about the disease and may have been just as frightened as their patients . &quot; Plague is one disease not taught in medical_schools , &quot; Sobti said . He too blamed the press , Indian and foreign , for creating panic . &quot; I want to say two things , &quot; he said . &quot; One , the plague is preventable . Two , it ' s curable. &quot; The World_Health_Organization cautioned people coming_to India against traveling_to Surat , but said there was no need for travelers to delay visits to other parts of the country . Other governments , including many of India ' s nearest neighbors , disagreed . Sri Lanka , Bangladesh , South_Korea , Nepal and Malaysia suspended air service by their national carriers . Saudia Arabia , Kuwait , Qatar , Bahrain and Oman banned all air_travel to and from India . Yemen and the United Arab Emirates closed sea links as well . In Sri Lanka , authorities quarantined 11 cargo_ships arriving from India , and 1 # 173 returning Tamil refugees were allowed to disembark only after their ship was held_off Trincomalee for more_than three hours while masked health officials inspected each returnee for possible plague symptoms . Pakistan canceled a train running between Lahore and the Indian city of Amritsar , stranding 317 of its own nationals in India . &quot; The governments are not confident about the ( Indian ) health service , &quot; WHO ' s Shah said . Gita R . Choksi , general_manager of Thomas Cook in Bombay , said the plague scare ' s impact on tourism had been disastrous . She said her travel_agency had lost more_than $ 150 # 000 in canceled bookings , &quot; and the sad part is that the tourists are apprehensive about coming_to India even in December. &quot; Gujarat Chief Minister Chhabildas Mehta told reporters Friday that there had not been a plague death reported in Surat for the last three days . A total of 12 million tetracycline capsules , an antibiotic used for both prevention and cure , have been handed_out , he said . &quot; It is not that serious and is fully under_control , &quot; Mehta said . The actions by leaders of neighboring Maharashtra showed that they were skeptical . On Friday , the state_government empowered district magistrates to ban entry of people or vehicles from Surat and other plague-stricken areas .</TEXT>
