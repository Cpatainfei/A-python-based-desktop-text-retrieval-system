   <HEADLINE> AMD CLEARED OF INFRINGING ON INTEL CHIPS ; COURTS : THE JURY DECISION IS A PIVOTAL ONE FOR ADVANCED MICRO DEVICES . INTEL VOWS IT WILL APPEAL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Advanced Micro Devices Inc. won a pivotal victory Thursday in a long-running and closely watched_case when a federal jury in San Jose cleared the computer chip maker of infringing Intel Corp . copyrights . The verdict means that AMD , a onetime Intel ally-turned-courtroom-belligerent , can continue selling its popular 486DX chips_in competition with the industry leader . Analysts said the decision could boost AMD ' s fortunes by sweeping away a cloud that perhaps has restrained enthusiasm for the company ' s products . &quot; This is a big win for Advanced Micro Devices , but an even bigger win for computer users , &quot; an exultant Jerry Sanders , the Sunnyvale-based company ' s flamboyant chief_executive , told reporters and investment analysts in a conference_call . He added that AMD can now &quot; be a contender for leadership &quot; in the computer chip industry . Intel , which controls 75 % to 80 % of the worldwide $ 8.8-billion microprocessor market , vowed to appeal the verdict . It is the second in the complex case . In 1992 , a jury found in Intel ' s favor , but the trial_judge tossed_out that decision , contending that Intel had inhibited AMD ' s defense by withholding certain documents . &quot; We now have two distinctly different jury verdicts , &quot; said F . Thomas Dunlap , vice_president and general counsel of Intel , based in Santa Clara . &quot; Therefore , the Court of Appeals must now decide which verdict stands. &quot; For investors , the verdict was already in . Shares of AMD rocketed to $ 28.875 , up $ 6.125 , on the New York Stock_Exchange . In Nasdaq trading , Intel ' s stock closed_down $ 1.50 a share at $ 70.125 after having traded as low as $ 68.25. The nine jurors weighing evidence in the seven-week trial unanimously rejected Intel ' s claim that AMD had infringed a copyright on the outmoded &quot; 287 math co-processor , &quot; a chip that speeds a computer ' s ability to crunch numbers . They sided with AMD , which maintained that Intel had granted AMD the right to copy the 287 ' s microcode in a 1976 cross-licensing agreement . ( Microcode is software built into a chip that defines the sequence of steps required to execute each instruction. ) In the 1970s , AMD was Intel ' s favorite backup manufacturing source for the chips . But in 1990 , after AMD announced that it would produce its own math co-processor using Intel ' s microcode , Intel sued . When AMD later used Intel microcode in making its lower-priced clones of the bigger rival ' s 386 and 486 chips , Intel again took AMD to court . Those proceedings are still under way . The Thursday verdict , analysts said , sets a precedent on microcode use that will aid AMD in those cases . Intel , which has enjoyed huge profits with its near monopoly , faces a wave of competition from others as well as AMD , including Cyrix , Texas Instruments and Nexgen , which plans Monday to announce a new microprocessor in the same class as Intel ' s hot new Pentium . AMD has its own such chip , the K5 . The verdict , Sanders said , means AMD can continue to ship 386 and 486 chips based on the Intel microcode . He projected that AMD will sell more_than 900 # 000 of the 486 chips this quarter , up from an earlier estimate of 700 # 000 . They are used widely in desktop and portable_computers . Sanders said AMD has spent a &quot; horrendous &quot; amount -- more_than $ 100 million -- on the Intel legal battles . He referred often to &quot; throwing_out the olive_branch &quot; to Intel , saying it was time to get_on_with things and compete fairly .</TEXT>
