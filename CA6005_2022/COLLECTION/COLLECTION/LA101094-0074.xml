   <HEADLINE> SCREENING ROOM : ' HOME ' SHORTS KICK OFF FALL SEASON AT FILMFORUM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Filmforum , the alternative cinema showcase , begins its fall programming tonight at 7:30 at the Hollywood Moguls , 1650 Schrader St . ( formerly Hudson ) , with the 80-minute &quot; Home Is Where the Heart Is ( Not ) , &quot; composed of six intense and surreal short films expressing the trauma of childhood . Most impressive is Jay Rosenblatt ' s &quot; The Smell of Burning Ants , &quot; in which he reprocesses found footage in a way to reveal how boys are conditioned to be aggressive , even sadistic . Jon Moritsugu ' s 68-minute &quot; Mod F--- Explosion &quot; ( at 9:30 , separate admission ) , a real discovery , is a dynamic punk odyssey of a pair of innocent teens adrift in a violent urban world ; Moritsugu unleashes a barrage of powerful images and hard-driving music . Marriage and Survival : On Nov . 7 , 1942 , in the ghetto of Riga , Latvia , Helma and Benno Schneider pledged their love for each other in the presence of Helma ' s parents and thereafter considered themselves married . Fifty years later in Los Angeles , their son , TV producer Sascha Schneider , organized a traditional Jewish wedding for his parents , and he and his wife , Laurie Zemelman-Schneider , documented not only the ceremony , which climaxes the profoundly emotional &quot; Chuppa : The Wedding Canopy &quot; ( at the Sunset 5 for one week ) but also persuaded his parents to talk_about their miraculous Holocaust survival . Beyond that , the younger Schneiders discuss their need to preserve their Jewish heritage while establishing more firmly their own identity and relationship ; for them the ceremony becomes , beyond a healing and closure for Helma and Benno , a symbol of_their_own independence for Sascha and Laurie . This remarkable dimension of the 80-minute film is handled with both the utmost honesty and sensitivity . All in the Family : The consistently outrageous and imaginative 1989 &quot; Dr. Caligari &quot; returns this week Fridays and Saturdays at midnight at the Sunset 5 . It would have us believe that the evil director of the insane in the classic &quot; Cabinet of Dr. Caligari &quot; has a granddaughter who wants to take_up where he left more_than 75 years ago . The current Dr. Caligari ( Madeleine Reynal ) presides over her asylum ( by a toxic_waste_dump ) like a mad dominatrix , and her victim-patients are all caught_up in extravagant , crazed indulgences in sex and drugs . Director-designer Stephen Sayadian and his co-writer Jerry Stahl , who made that other midnight-circuit hit &quot; Cafe Flesh , &quot; have created a darkly hilarious satire of contemporary aberrations and the gobbledygook we use to describe them .
