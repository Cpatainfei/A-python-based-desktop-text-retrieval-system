   <TEXT> In real_life , Daniel Beretta is a stocky , blue-eyed guy with long , thick blond hair and the beginnings of a paunch . He plays the piano , sings French ballads and does some acting , though he labors mostly in obscurity . But millions of French moviegoers would recognize Beretta instantly , without laying eyes on him , as the muscled voice of Arnold Schwarzenegger in half_a_dozen films_over the past decade . And for Beretta and 800 other French actors , the process of putting their words in the mouths of America ' s top movie_stars is the most challenging acting assignment of all . &quot; It ' s the toughest of jobs to be someone else ' s voice , but I just love to play Schwarzenegger , &quot; Beretta said , smiling as he held his 2-year-old daughter in his Paris apartment . &quot; There ' s , like , a spark . I feel I know him . We have a parallel life . I ' m sure he ' s a good_guy , with a lot of heart. &quot; But these days , the voices of France ' s skillful dubbers , or doubleurs as they are called here , have fallen silent in the studios and are instead being raised in the streets . They have launched a massive strike , now in its ninth week , to press their demand to be paid_for the rebroadcast of films , TV_programs and series in which they performed . The strike centers_on a 1985 French law guaranteeing actors and other performing_artists the right to be paid_for all residual sales of their work . The distribution companies argue that dubbers are &quot; extras , &quot; not performing artists , and therefore are not covered by the law . The distributors of films and TV_programs &quot; have insulted us , &quot; said Alain Dorval , a rugged , dark-haired 48-year-old who has been Sylvester Stallone ' s gravelly French voice since the first &quot; Rocky &quot; in 1976 . &quot; This is about our dignity , and dignity can ' t be shared. &quot; Now the dubbers have begun using their special skills in an ingenious radio appeal for public sympathy . In one advertising spot , the well-known French voice of Peter Falk ' s Columbo asks the voice of &quot; Monsieur Eliot Ness &quot; how he can tell his wife what the strike is all about . After being told that everyone involved in the film receives residuals except the dubbers , Columbo responds with all_the sincerity of the beloved , rumpled detective . &quot; that ' s not right , &quot; he says . The man behind Columbo ' s French voice , Serge Sauvion , is an institution in France , where episodes of the TV series still play regularly . In his career , the 66-year-old French actor has done the voices of TV tough_guys Mike Hammer and Baretta as well as roles played by Richard Burton , Sidney Poitier and Montgomery Clift . &quot; I ' ve dubbed the Columbo series for 25 years , but each time I was only paid once , &quot; complained Sauvion . &quot; This fight of ours is going_to last as long as it takes_to win. &quot; The strike already has disrupted the television dubbing of dozens of American soap_operas and series , and delays now are expected in getting them onto the screen . So far , film distributors say the strike has not greatly affected them . BAC Films , which is distributing the new Woody Allen film , &quot; Bullets Over Broadway , &quot; had the French-language script written before the strike and has managed to finish the dubbing with strike-breakers and foreign actors . &quot; I can ' t tell you how we ' ve done_it , &quot; a spokesman for BAC said . &quot; But it was legal. &quot; The French government , fearing that the strike will severely disrupt television programming and hurt striking actors , has called_in a mediator . But the television and film distributors have thus far refused to negotiate . In a letter to the two sides , Culture Minister Jacques Toubon said he believes that the law clearly was intended to include dubbers as &quot; performing artists. &quot; But he added that a final_decision would rest with the nation ' s judiciary . Dubbing is big business in France , where American films and TV_programs make_up well_over half the entertainment fare . For the_French viewer , everyone from Tom Hanks to Julia Roberts speaks French . And the unions representing the dubbers say 85 % of American entertainment revenue here comes from dubbed TV_programs and films . In French cinemas , foreign films usually are released in both their &quot; original version , &quot; with French subtitles , and a &quot; French version , &quot; in which dialogue is dubbed . For mainstream pictures , such_as &quot; Sister Act , &quot; and animated films , such_as &quot; The Lion King , &quot; about 90 % of box-office revenue comes from the_French version . But for other pictures , such_as Woody Allen films , which many French moviegoers prefer to see in their original version , only about half the receipts come from the_French version . It costs between $ 70 # 000 and $ 150 # 000 to dub an American movie in France , not including the cost of translating the script . The standard union scale for dubbing actors is $ 6.50 a line , or about $ 2 # 000 for a leading role , and it usually involves a week or 10 days of work . Dubbers with voices that are well-known , or associated with the actors on screen , can command higher salaries . Dorval made $ 1 # 000 for dubbing Stallone in the first &quot; Rocky &quot; movie . But , for the last in the series , he demanded and received $ 10 # 000 . His salary dipped again with the recent &quot; Cliffhanger , &quot; for which he received $ 5 # 000 to dub Stallone . Although most dubbers work in anonymity , a_few say they are recognized by their voices in restaurants and on the streets . &quot; Young people really identify with me as Stallone , &quot; Dorval said . &quot; People are always asking me to do the last line of ' Rocky. ' They say : ' Do Adrian for me ! ' &quot; With that , Dorval broke_into a warbling &quot; AAAAddddriaaaaan ! &quot; As if to apologize , he added : &quot; It ' s a very celebrated cry in France. &quot; Dubbing has been around since the end of the silent film era . While it has never been especially popular in the United States , it is an integral part of the movie business in Europe , primarily because of Hollywood ' s huge market share there . It ' s big business , and distributors in France are understandably reluctant to hand_over a portion of their proceeds for rebroadcasts and re-screenings . &quot; Dubbing in France is more expensive than anywhere else in the world , &quot; said Jean Labadie , general_manager of BAC , which has distributed &quot; Short Cuts , &quot; &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; and other recent U.S. films in France . &quot; These people are very well paid . I don ' t feel these are poor people living_on the streets . &quot; This is a market , &quot; Labadie added . &quot; And there is no reason that everybody should get a percentage all_the time , unless the film is being sold by their name and their voice. &quot; But the three unions representing the dubbers in France disagree , pointing_out that writers of dubbed dialogue are paid each time the show or film appears . &quot; We want them to recognize us as actors , with the right to authorize the use of our work all_the way down the line , &quot; said Jimmy Shulman , a leader of the Syndicate of French Performing_Artists , the largest actors union in France . &quot; These distributors have the money , &quot; Shulman added . &quot; But we haven ' t even talked_about figures yet . We ' re still stuck_on questions of principle. &quot; The actors say the key to successful dubbing is to put themselves into the image on the screen and make the audience forget , as soon as possible , that they aren ' t hearing the actor ' s real voice . Of course , that ' s not always easy . One problem is regional American accents . In France , when an American actor appears on screen with a Texas twang , the_French dubber gives him a non-Parisian accent , to distinguish him from the rest of the cast . The other problem is French accents in American movies . Beretta , the_French Schwarzenegger , solved the problem of playing the voice of Lumiere , the French-accented candelabra in &quot; Beauty and the Beast &quot; by putting_on the sophisticated accent of the late Maurice Chevalier . With some roles , such_as Columbo , simple mimicry works nicely , and a casual viewer might easily believe Sauvion is Falk ' s long-lost French cousin . Similarly , Bernard Murat does Woody Allen as a very believable , whiny Frenchman . Beretta got his first Schwarzenegger job when a producer overheard him speaking in a television studio . But Beretta ' s Schwarzenegger voice has evolved from the tough , East European accent of the actor in &quot; Red_Heat &quot; to a lighter , almost feminine tone in &quot; Junior , &quot; in which the actor plays a man who becomes pregnant . Some distributors have rotated the voice roles of major actors , weighing the potential for audience reaction against the potential for increased wage demands from dubbers too closely associated with one actor . For instance , there are two French Kevin Costners and two Whoopi Goldbergs , and many actors have done Jack Nicholson ' s voice . &quot; Being an actor means being another person , but to be a dubber you have to play an actor who is playing another person , &quot; said Jacqueline Cohen , a deep-voiced 59-year-old who has played the_French voice of Goldberg in &quot; Jumping Jack Flash , &quot; &quot; The Player &quot; and &quot; Sarafina. &quot; &quot; You can ' t make people on the street do this job , &quot; she added . &quot; It ' s impossible . You have to be an actor , and you have to have a certain technique. &quot; Because Cohen is a white_woman doing the voice of a black actress , she said she finds the biggest compliment comes &quot; when people say they ' ve seen one of my Whoopi Goldberg films and didn ' t recognize me. &quot; For most French dubbers , the job is part-time . As the_French film_industry has atrophied , jobs for actors have dwindled . And dubbing is a way to supplement their income from writing , stage acting or television commercials . Cohen , for example , spends most of her time writing dubbed dialogue . She has written the_French scripts and subtitles for all_of Woody Allen ' s films , including &quot; Bullets Over Broadway. &quot; And she fondly remembers an exchange last year with Allen , who is probably America ' s most popular filmmaker in France . &quot; You ' ve made a hero of me in France , &quot; he told Cohen . &quot; No , &quot; she responded , &quot; you ' ve made a hero of me. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Losing Their Voices A strike , now in its ninth week , by the_French actors who dub the dialogue of U.S. movie_stars has disrupted distribution of American films and programs in France .</TEXT>
