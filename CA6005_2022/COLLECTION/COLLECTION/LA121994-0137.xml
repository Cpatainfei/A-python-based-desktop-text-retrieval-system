   <TEXT> Shrink-wrapped , wingless and with its tail section missing , the Enola Gay lies silently amid the debris of museum construction , like a beached whale awaiting its fate . When fully assembled , the most famous bomber aircraft of World_War_II is 99 feet long and has a 144-foot wingspan . It is simply too big and too heavy to be displayed in one piece in a museum . Even one as cavernous as the Smithsonian Institution ' s Air and Space Museum on the Mall here . So only the front fuselage of the Enola Gay sits behind locked and guarded doors in a closed-off museum gallery , while curators slowly -- and now cautiously -- build an exhibit around the B-29 to tell its story . &quot; We could have cleared an entire area of the main hall and just had room enough to display the Enola Gay with its wings on , but it ' s so heavy it still would have gone right through the floor into the parking garage below , &quot; says museum spokesman Mike Fetters . that ' s a nice bit of symbolism for the implosion that ' s hit the Enola Gay ' s exhibit as well . Five months before the scheduled May , 1995 , opening of the most controversial exhibit ever staged at America ' s most popular museum , the emotion-soaked debate over the plane and its display has already become so politically charged and so weighted down by personal recriminations that the Smithsonian has been forced into retreat . Under unprecedented public pressure , the museum has drastically altered its original plans for its exhibit marking the 50th anniversary of the Enola Gay ' s only mission : the dropping of the first atomic_bomb on Hiroshima , Japan , on Aug . 6 , 1945 . Call it a victory for American heritage over the forces of political correctness and revisionism . Or call it the triumph of uneducated censorship over legitimate historical inquiry . No matter your point_of_view , one thing is clear : The Smithsonian has all but surrendered to the veterans groups and other critics who loudly opposed the museum ' s initial exhibit plans on the grounds that they were wildly anti-American and laden with the scent of political correctness . Now , after five revisions and a series of arduous , line-by-line editing sessions between the museum staff and representatives of leading veterans groups , the museum has produced a final script for the proposed Enola Gay exhibit , &quot; The Last Act : The Atomic Bomb and the End of World_War_II , &quot; that has been cleansed of most of its controversy . The language that had tarred it as being a product of political correctness run amok has been thoroughly excised from the script . The Smithsonian ' s about-face has been so complete , in fact , that the greatest outcry against the exhibit now comes from liberal historians sickened by what they see as the triumph of the personal_memory and nostalgia of American veterans over clear-eyed history of the U.S. decision to drop the atom_bomb . &quot; The museum has caved_in to right-wing political pressure , &quot; argues Kai Bird , a World_War_II historian . Sensing victory , meanwhile , veterans groups continue to press for even further changes to the organization of the exhibit , arguing that the curators still hope to play &quot; emotional tricks &quot; on museum visitors by linking the display of the Enola Gay to depictions of Hiroshima bomb victims and survivors . &quot; The curators are still retreating , but they are doing so grudgingly , word by word , line by line , and it ' s not because they believe they are wrong , it ' s because of the outside pressure , &quot; says John T . Correll , editor of Air_Force Magazine , the journal of the Air_Force Assn. , a veterans organization that has campaigned successfully for changes to the exhibit . Meanwhile , the exhibit ' s original planners -- curator Michael Neufeld and Tom Crouch , director of the Air and Space Museum ' s division of aeronautics -- are so frustrated that they no longer are willing to discuss the exhibit with the media . &quot; Are they happy with the current exhibit ? Happy isn ' t the word I would use , &quot; acknowledges Fetters , the museum spokesman . Indeed , perhaps it is fitting that in this new conservative era , the backlash against PC -- real or imagined -- would achieve its greatest triumph here in Washington , within sight of the Capitol building and a Congress now firmly under Republican control . In many ways , in fact , the story behind the Smithsonian ' s struggle over the Enola Gay has much more to do with 1990s cultural politics than it does with the history of World_War_II . The American decision to drop the atomic_bomb on Hiroshima on Aug . 6 , 1945 , and on Nagasaki , Japan , on Aug . 9 , brought World_War_II to a shattering and troubling end . President Harry Truman had moved decisively to use the bomb to end the war quickly and to save thousands of American lives by averting a planned invasion of a recalcitrant Japan . But in the process the United States had also ushered_in the nuclear age , and with it gradually came a new sense of ambivalence about the uses of American power . From the start of their planning for the 50th anniversary of the Enola Gay ' s mission to Hiroshima , Neufeld and Crouch were convinced that they had to explore that larger history of the nuclear age , and what Hiroshima meant for the modern_world . Unlike the Spirit of St . Louis , the Wright Brothers ' Flyer or Chuck Yeager ' s X-1 , the Enola Gay would not be displayed on its own , but would rather serve as the centerpiece for a political history of the dawn of the nuclear threat and the onset of the Cold_War . As Washington Post columnist Jonathan Yardley argues , the decision not to simply display the bomber on its own , but to place it in a historical context of the curators ' choosing , was at heart a political act . Neufeld and Crouch wanted to use the Enola Gay to &quot; address the significance , necessity and morality of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , because the question of whether it was necessary and right to drop the bombs continues to perplex us. &quot; Yet almost by definition , that meant they would be looking_at the history of the Enola Gay through a 1990s lens -- and given Crouch and Neufeld ' s own views , a critical one at that -- and fail to grasp its 1945 context . It quickly became clear that this approach was meant to convey an anti-nuclear perspective for the exhibit , one that seemed to suggest that the United States had committed an immoral and racist act by dropping the bomb on Japan . For a museum staff that recognizes that many of its visitors are young children or teen-agers who are almost wholly ignorant of the history of World_War_II , that was a cavalier step to take . * Crouch and Neufeld seemed to dismiss the controversy as essentially a generational dispute , pitting the veterans of World_War_II against their children , who grew_up under the threat of nuclear war . But the exhibit ' s flaws ran much deeper than that . Its anti-nuclear message was overlaid on a script that took astonishing liberties with the history of World_War_II leading_up to the Enola Gay ' s mission . For example , in the first version of the script , written last January by Crouch and Neufeld , they described the War in the Pacific as an American &quot; war of vengeance , &quot; while insisting that for &quot; most Japanese , it was a war to defend their unique culture against Western imperialism. &quot; Further , they planned to begin the chronology of the exhibit with the final land battles of the Pacific on Iwo Jima and Okinawa in 1945 . That gave the exhibit the sense that the United States was easily rolling_over an already defeated enemy , leading to the central historical point that the curators hoped to make : that the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not necessary to end the war , and that Truman and his advisers knew it . &quot; The script gives the impression that President Truman , in making his decision to drop the bomb , did_it to impress the Soviet_Union rather than to save American lives in any potential invasion of Japan , &quot; wrote Richard Hallion , chief historian of the Air_Force , who reviewed the script as a member of the museum ' s advisory_board . &quot; The script also conveys the idea that Truman was motivated by racism and that dropping the bomb was unjustified. &quot; The original show would conclude with a gut-wrenching display called &quot; Ground Zero , &quot; which Crouch and Neufeld called the &quot; emotional heart of the exhibit. &quot; Here , &quot; photos of victims , enlarged to life-size , will stare out at the visitor. &quot; The photos would be supplemented with artifacts from victims , including a young_girl ' s carbonized school lunch box , as well as religious artifacts melted and misshapen by the atomic blast . And , so that no one would miss the connection , a replica of the &quot; Little Boy &quot; bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima would be positioned right underneath the fuselage of the Enola Gay . For American veterans of World_War_II -- many of whom had sent small donations to the Smithsonian over the years urging the museum to restore and display the plane that they believed had saved their lives -- the initial reports of the Smithsonian ' s plans came as a horrific shock . &quot; Those whose business it is to create , mold , manipulate and utilize public_opinion have done so as a matter of self-serving interest , &quot; complained Brig . Gen . Paul Tibbets , the now-retired commander of the Enola Gay on its Hiroshima mission ; he has refused to cooperate with the museum ' s curators . &quot; Consequently , history has been denigrated , the Enola Gay has been miscast , and a group of valiant Americans have had their role in history treated shamefully. &quot; Veterans groups mobilized early this year , and eventually got Congress involved as well . The Senate passed a resolution sponsored by Sen . Nancy Kassebaum ( R-Kansas ) that decried the Enola Gay script as &quot; revisionist and offensive &quot; to World_War_II veterans . And , once the national media discovered the controversy , the coverage was almost universally critical of the Smithsonian ' s plans . * Despite the onslaught of criticism , Crouch and Neufeld wanted to tough it out and go_ahead with their original exhibit plans . But the Smithsonian ' s upper management , including Air and Space Museum Director Martin Harwit , soon figured_out which way the political winds were blowing and recognized the need for compromise . By April , Harwit was backtracking and mounting a rather disingenuous defense of his earlier approval of the January script . &quot; I evidently paid greater attention to accuracy than to balance , &quot; he said . &quot; Accuracy is somewhat easier to check , at least for the aspects of the exhibition that are familiar . Balance is more difficult to assess , since it requires an overview that allows one to see the script as a whole. &quot; So on a second_reading , Harwit said he found that &quot; we do have a lack of balance , and that much of the criticism that has been leveled against us is understandable. &quot; &quot; Most strikingly . . . we show terrible pictures of human suffering in Hiroshima and Nagasaki without earlier showing pictures of the suffering the Japanese had inflicted in China , in the camps they set_up for Dutch and British civilians and military , and U.S. prisoners_of_war . . . . We show virtually no pictures of Allied dead or wounded , while ( the Ground Zero display ) has any number of heart-wrenching , tragic stories of suffering on the ground . Where are the corresponding tragedies in China , in the Philippines , in Singapore , in the former Dutch possessions ? &quot; Harwit established an internal review process to revise the script , but that failed to mollify the veterans groups , who demanded more involvement in the exhibit rewrites . Eventually , both the Air_Force Assn . and the American_Legion forced the museum to negotiate with them in a series of semantic skirmishes over script wording . As the controversy swelled and public_opinion sided with the veterans , they tended to win most of those battles . As a result , a close reading of the final exhibit script , published in October , shows that it bears little resemblance to the earlier efforts . Not only has the controversial language and &quot; anti-American slant &quot; been excised , the portion of the exhibit dealing with the Cold_War and the nuclear age has been all but eliminated . No longer does the exhibit focus_on the decision-making process in Washington over whether to drop the bomb . Instead , the museum has almost doubled the exhibit space to add an entire new section on the origins and history of the entire War in the Pacific . The number of photographs and artifacts from Hiroshima bomb victims has been reduced , the number of photographs of American casualties increased , and a video of the recollections of bomber_crews added . * Yet that new approach prompted a group of 62 authors and academics to issue a letter to the Smithsonian in November , protesting its willingness to give_in to the veterans ' demands . Recent historical research had uncovered many of the nuances and subtleties behind Truman ' s decision to drop the bomb , and yet now the museum was abandoning its efforts to address that issue , the group argued . Last Thursday , a group of religious_leaders and peace activists met with Harwit to present similar concerns , arguing that the exhibit now fails to explain the long-term consequences of the Enola Gay ' s mission . The bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , Japan , &quot; were not just the final acts of World_War_II . . . they were the opening acts of the nuclear age , and all its dangers , &quot; said Dr. Robert K . Musil , director of policy and programs for Physicians for Social Responsibility . And the new exhibit plan , Musil said , &quot; does not present the continuing consequences for the world in which we now live. &quot; Ironically , the changes made to the exhibit also may prevent the Smithsonian from gaining access to the Hiroshima artifacts that it has been counting_on to fill_out its &quot; Ground Zero &quot; section . Those artifacts are now held by Japanese museums , and museum spokesman Fetters says the controversy here has made them reluctant to lend them to the Air and Space Museum . Yet as the debate rages on , Fetters worries that the real loser will be the Air and Space Museum . With 8.2 million visitors last year , it is the most popular museum in the world , and until now , has been largely free_of controversy . It is always a gee-whiz hit with families touring the nation ' s capital . &quot; This is a shrine to American technology , &quot; Fetters says . &quot; We just had our 25th anniversary for the Apollo moon landings , and we are already getting excited about 2003 and the centennial of flight . But when we do something like this that doesn ' t fit with our image , it surprises and disappoints people . &quot; I ' m afraid we ' re going to have to win a lot of people back. &quot;</TEXT>
