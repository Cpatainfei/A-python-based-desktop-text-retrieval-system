   <HEADLINE> CLINTON DROPS WALKING TOUR OF JERUSALEM ; MIDEAST : TIRED PRESIDENT CANCELS PLANS AMID ARAB-ISRAELI CONTROVERSY OVER HOLY_CITY ' S FUTURE . FIRST_LADY GOES IN HIS PLACE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What President Clinton wanted to see in Jerusalem was what every visitor wants to see -- the walled Old City , the Church of the Holy Sepulcher , the Via Dolorosa , the Western Wall of Judaism ' s Second Temple , Al Aqsa Mosque . But even before he set foot in the city Thursday , Clinton ran_into the most sensitive and probably the most difficult issue in the Arab-Israeli conflict -- the future of Jerusalem and its religious shrines -- and in the end he canceled the walking tour his staff had carefully planned for days . &quot; I ' m on my last leg -- I ' m really tired , &quot; Clinton said , arriving an hour late from Damascus , the third capital of his six-nation tour , and looking very weary indeed . The President instead dispatched Hillary Rodham Clinton to the Western Wall , Judaism ' s holiest site as the only major part that remains of King Herod ' s temple . The couple had toured the Old City more_than a decade ago on a visit the President recalled in a speech to Israel ' s Parliament later in the day . Amid elaborate security precautions -- the virtual clearing of all_the men and women who had been praying at the wall , a check of its numerous chinks and holes and a cordon of hundreds of police -- Mrs . Clinton went_to the wall for about 15 minutes Thursday evening and prayed there briefly . Although Clinton ' s fatigue was real , the political controversy had proved insoluble -- even to veterans of the Middle_East peace negotiations . Israelis , who describe Jerusalem as &quot; the united and eternal capital of the Jewish people and State of Israel , &quot; objected strongly to Clinton ' s request that Mayor Ehud Olmert not accompany him on the planned excursion , lest that act signify U.S. acceptance of the Israeli claim -- as Olmert said it would . &quot; There is a united Jerusalem , &quot; Olmert said . &quot; When the mayor visits along with the President , it is just an issue of protocol . But the minute someone says to a mayor you cannot visit a certain party ( of the city ) , a political problem is created . . . . &quot; What is more important is that we agree among ourselves . As long as we agree regarding the status of Jerusalem , and we show determination and strength and unity regarding its future , its status and its integrity , other things can be important but won ' t be determining. &quot; Palestinians , who envision Arab East Jerusalem as the capital of an independent Palestinian state , said they would close the doors of Al Aqsa to Clinton if he were accompanied by Olmert , an opponent of Israel ' s accord with the Palestine Liberation Organization on Palestinian self-government . &quot; We see Jerusalem as an area where the status is not yet defined or decided , &quot; said Ziad abu Zayyad , a prominent member of the PLO ' s mainstream Fatah faction . &quot; Any official visit by a public personality to East Jerusalem may imply that they recognize it as part of Israel. &quot; Most countries , including the United States , did not recognize Israel ' s incorporation of Arab East Jerusalem into the boundaries of its capital city after the 1967 Arab-Israeli War when it was captured from Jordan ; in fact , most other countries regard the status of Jerusalem as an unresolved international question and have kept their embassies in Tel Aviv . A dozen compromises , such_as a group of religious_leaders to greet the President and show him the shrines , were proposed but pleased no one . Faisal Husseini , a minister in the Palestinian Authority , commented , &quot; The situation is that now the whole issue of Jerusalem is_on the agenda , and every move takes_on political implications so that everything is sensitive . Once again , Israel failed to prove it has full authority over Jerusalem. &quot; When Clinton decided that problem was just too difficult to resolve in an evening and canceled the tour , American and Israeli security personnel rejoiced . They had grown increasingly anxious about the plan for the late-night walking tour through the Old City ' s maze of crowded streets and narrow alleyways . &quot; We were going_to line his whole route with police , shoulder to shoulder , &quot; a senior officer said . &quot; We already had 2 # 500 men in the Old City , and we were going_to have to close it in its entirety to protect the President . This was a huge undertaking. &quot; Elaborate security measures have been taken_to protect Clinton in the wake of a series of terrorist attacks here this month by Muslim militants belonging_to the Islamic Resistance Movement , known as Hamas .</TEXT>
