   <HEADLINE> A GREAT DRAGON SURGES TOWARD MODERNITY ; ACCELERATED CHANGE IS HAVING HUGE IMPACTS IN CHINA , BOTH GOOD AND BAD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> China ' s march toward modernization continues at a dazzling pace . Five years ago a narrow two-lane road , crowded with horse carts and people , was the path out of the Beijing airport . Today there ' s a modern , multilane toll freeway . China ' s make-over goes_on literally around the clock , with many thousands of construction workers fashioning new highways and perched atop bamboo scaffolds knocking_down old buildings or putting_up new ones . China is embracing Americana from old Shirley Temple movies to the Hard Rock Cafe . English is in , Russian is out . Yet with China ' s rapid transformation to a &quot; socialist market_economy &quot; come undercurrents of instability . Millions of people are_on the move_in search of better-paying jobs as market forces disrupt a system that guaranteed lifetime employment . Millions more are jobless . Inflation is running at more_than 25 % . Corruption is_on the rise . There have been sporadic incidents of worker and peasant unrest . Children begging at the train_station in Guangzhou and on the main_street of Beijing reflect the unintended consequences of reform . If Beijing succeeds in the incredibly complex task of managing a transformation , it could become a new model of economic development . Should it fail , the world ' s most populous nation could fall_into chaos , with horrifying international implications . With China in flux , the United States must keep Beijing engaged in a constructive and broad-based relationship . When President Clinton severed the link last May between human_rights and renewal of China ' s most-favored-nation trade status , the move was controversial and unpopular but was correct for the long term : U.S.-China relations cannot be assessed through the narrow prism of human_rights alone . The relationship must embrace issues that include security , the environment , trade , immigration and drugs . Like it or not , the Chinese interpretation of human_rights is to feed , clothe , house and employ its people . The numbers are daunting despite a one-child-per-family policy since 1979 . A population of 1.2 billion in 1995 and of 1.3 billion by the end of the century is predicted . About 80 million Chinese subsist below the poverty_line now . The well-being of the nation ' s citizenry is critical to stability . Meanwhile , the Chinese enjoy greater personal freedom and mobility than in the past . They can seek jobs in new places ( although they cannot permanently reside in a new city without permission ) . More_than a quarter of a_million Chinese are studying abroad , mostly in the United States . More households have TVs than refrigerators ; foreign programming and news can be seen now , even though television remains state-controlled , as do newspapers . To date , Beijing has managed most of the economic realignments through incremental changes . The central government has allowed the provinces to establish industrial zones and special economic development zones . Joint_ventures with foreign companies have been encouraged . This has resulted in some odd combinations -- like a firm that produces the pricey designer clothes of Escada and builds power_plants too . Bigger , more disruptive changes may come as Beijing moves next year to remake inefficient state-owned enterprises , of which a third to a half are losing money . The government will also have to tackle bigger challenges , including creating a new monetary_system and revamping its tax_system . Conforming_to international legal , financial and trading standards will be necessary in_order to restore Shanghai as a major international financial and banking center . China now is spreading across the Pacific . The state-owned Xinmin Evening News in Shanghai has a Los Angeles office and this month began distributing a U.S. edition via satellite . A Beijing restaurant that specializes in Peking duck opened an outlet in Los Angeles . When senior leader Deng Xiaoping , the architect of economic reform , traveled_to southern China to invigorate change in 1992 , he reportedly said it was pointless to argue whether something was Western or Eastern . He said there is now a common world civilization of which China should be part . It most decidedly is .</TEXT>
