   <HEADLINE> AGAINST THE GRAIN ; MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS PEDDLING PATENTED SEEDS AND CHEMICAL PESTICIDES ARE POISED TO REVOLUTIONIZE INDIA ' S ANCIENT AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM . BUT AT WHAT COST ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The raid was planned well in_advance , the target selected with precision , the goal immense . The farmers would wear green scarves and loose fitting khadi -- traditional homespun cotton -- that evoked the spinning_wheel Gandhi had chosen as the symbol of India ' s self-reliance . Like Gandhi , the farmers would move against an unwelcome foreigner , echoing the Mahatma ' s campaign against British imperialism . And to focus the nation ' s attention on the threat of a new colonialism , they would seize_on a speck of nature at the core of civilization and at the heart of their livelihoods : the seed . The seed agitation began in a stairwell just before noon on Dec . 29 , 1992 . Seventy-five farmers mounted four flights of stairs that led to the southern India offices of a multinational food corporation . Inside , half_a_dozen employees from Cargill Seeds Private Ltd . of India -- a tiny subsidiary of the largest privately held company in the United States -- were going_about their business when the farmers burst through the door . &quot; We have not come_to harm you , &quot; announced Sesha Reddy , a barrel-chested farmer with a shock of white hair , Coke-bottle glasses and a booming baritone . &quot; We are here only as a protest. &quot; The farmers smashed windows , tore phones from the walls , emptied desk drawers , broke_open locked file_cabinets and hurled armfuls of papers , financial records and the symbol of their protest -- Cargill hybrid seeds -- through the broken glass to the street below . &quot; It was , &quot; recalls John Hamilton , manager for Cargill Seeds India , &quot; a rather unpleasant experience. &quot; Below , in the streets of downtown Bangalore , a city of 4.1 million in the state of Karnataka , 400 farmers scooped_up the papers , files and seed packets as they fluttered down from the fifth-floor offices . Wearing his trademark green-felt hat , M.D. Nanjundaswamy waited in his car with a pack of matches . Farmer , state legislator and former law professor , Nanjundaswamy is perhaps India ' s most prominent figure in the farm protest movement . When the piles grew high , he handed the matches to a farmer . Within minutes , a huge fire brought traffic to a stop . &quot; Bon fire , &quot; Nanjundaswamy said with a smile . &quot; From the_French origin . Good fire. &quot; The farmers formed a ring around the flames and shouted up_to Cargill , in the south Indian language of Kannada , the historic slogan of Gandhi ' s freedom struggle : &quot; Tolagi India ! &quot; Quit India . &quot; THIS IS INDEED A DEFINING MOMENT IN ECONOMIC HISTORY , &quot; declared Peter Sutherland , director general of the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) . Sutherland was addressing economic ministers from around the world who had gathered_in Marrakesh , Morocco , in April to sign the largest trade pact in history and to establish a new international structure , the World Trade Organization . Sutherland , a former Irish attorney_general , is generally credited with keeping the fractious First and Third_World forces together and bringing the negotiations , which had begun more_than seven years ago in Uruguay , to a successful conclusion . Many of the signatory governments still must ratify the treaty . Since the fall of communism , free_trade has carried an air of destiny . Proponents , mostly from the First World , compare GATT ' s falling trade_barriers to the collapse of the Berlin Wall ; both are seen as essential steps_in the world ' s march toward democratic capitalism . The trade pact , according to its advocates , will eventually add $ 235 billion a year to world economic income and expand the development of the First and Third_Worlds within a decade of its ratification . &quot; Every country gains , &quot; concluded Sutherland , amid palm_trees and gleaming pink walls . &quot; There are no losers. &quot; But the farmers of India ' s seed agitation are convinced that the pact will produce many losers . And they are not the only ones who think this . In the year preceding the accords , millions of farmers , environmentalists and social activists in India , Europe and east Asia took_part in mass demonstrations and , in the case of Mexico , open rebellion . Leaders of the Zapatista movement in Chiapas cited free-trade accords as a principal motive for their revolt . Cheap corn imports from America , they claimed , will drive down prices and wipe_out Mexican peasants . In South_Korea , thousands of people participated in &quot; rice riots &quot; to denounce low-priced imports . Japanese legislators went_on hunger_strikes , and rice farmers vehemently protested increased imports . More_than 10 # 000 farmers across France joined in anti-GATT demonstrations , blocking highways and rail_lines and bringing their tractors into the heart of Paris . And in India , crowds reaching half a_million rallied against GATT for more_than a year . These opponents of the trade agreement believe it will force millions of farmers off their land and place much of the world ' s basic food supply in ecological jeopardy . As multinational companies prepare to bring seeds , chemical pesticides and fertilizers into Third_World markets , many scientists and ecologists warn that a_few corporate-owned varieties will replace thousands of locally cultivated seeds , making crops vulnerable to disease and drought and increasing the chance of famine . &quot; The drive toward the uniformization of world crops is leading to a dangerously precarious world food system , &quot; says Timothy C . Weiskel , associate director of the Pacific Basin Research_Center at Harvard ' s Kennedy School of Government . &quot; More and more people are coming_to depend_on fewer varieties and fewer species of crops . Champions of GATT , whether they realize it or not , are destabilizing rural populations in the name of unsustainable agriculture . This will drive the small_farmer out of production altogether . This is being done_in the name of a new international economic order in which the Western world feels it can now write the rules for a post-Cold War global economy . GATT is one great big can_opener of Third_World countries for multinational corporations. &quot; But Indian officials say old policies of protectionism and bureaucratic socialism have failed to bring prosperity to the world ' s second most populous nation . GATT , the government insists , is crucial to economic liberalization . &quot; We went_through a phase_in which the government used to intervene in the economy , &quot; says Indian Finance Secretary Montek Singh Ahluwalia in his high-ceilinged office near India Gate , New Delhi ' s great stone arch . &quot; But the present reforms are based on the understanding that we now have an industrial base , we have a competitive capability , we have the resources to be a more open economy integrated in the world . India will do_well if it becomes a more open and more competitive economy. &quot; Indeed , many farmers support the government ' s plans to increase exports , reduce tariff barriers and promote multinational investment from companies like Cargill , believing that these reforms will bring them more income . With the trade pact in place , multinationals will have broad access to India ' s vast farming market for the first time since independence in 1948 . A quarter of the world ' s farmers -- more_than 200 million -- live_in India . Already , scores of seed and petrochemical companies from Europe and the United States , armed with large research budgets and advanced genetic-engineering techniques , have arrived here to develop and market seeds , chemical pesticides and fertilizers . The GATT accord makes_it possible for these companies to search India ' s fields and then create , patent and market new , &quot; improved &quot; products -- which , in turn , can be sold back to farmers . Ten days before the GATT signing and nearly 16 months after the original raid on Cargill , more_than 100 # 000 people gathered at Delhi ' s historic Red Fort . As Indian trade ministers prepared to leave for Morocco , the crowd marched toward Parliament . Bricks flew at the national memorial to Gandhi . Police used water_cannons , tear_gas and rubber bullets to turn_back the crowd . On the day the accord was signed , Nanjundaswamy and his farmers ' group staged another raid , this time against Union Carbide Private Ltd. , the American chemical corporation infamous in India for the Bhopal disaster . &quot; The nationalist forces , &quot; declared the former law professor , &quot; have decided to destroy the property of all multinational firms. &quot; Farmer-activist Sesha Reddy sounds equally ominous when he recalls the East India Company , the_British trader that dominated the lives of Indians for more_than two centuries . &quot; We call Cargill the West India Company . We don ' t want a West India Company to once again dominate our economy , our freedom , our politics . We are prepared to die for this. &quot; MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER FARMERS ransacked the offices , Cargill ' s Bangalore headquarters are_quiet . John Hamilton , a stocky Australian with broad white sideburns and a horseshoe mustache , sits behind his desk . With Cargill for 15 years , Hamilton set_up its India operations in 1988 . On Republic Day , the anniversary of the enactment of India ' s constitution , a frail guard sits watch in the hall behind a new wrought-iron gate . &quot; Next time , &quot; says Hamilton , &quot; we ' ll be ready. &quot; Cargill ' s managing director for India laces his fingers behind his neck and gazes at the streets below . The agitation , he says , is mostly the work of &quot; a political radical with a political agenda &quot; -- M.D. Nanjundaswamy . &quot; He is a charismatic local personality . But we will not let one small-time politician campaigning against our seed company run us out of the business. &quot; This is unlikely . Minnesota-based Cargill markets grain , coffee , cotton , beef , oil , steel , plastics and other goods to 58 countries and employs more_than 69 # 000 people . Last year , company sales reached $ 47 billion . Cargill ' s arrival in India is part of a global strategy to market seeds and fertilizer to farmers and consumers more efficiently and cheaply than local producers can . Cargill , says Hamilton , can help India ' s growing population meet a potential food shortfall by producing high-yielding crops from hybrid seeds , increasing farmers ' income in the process . But in developing improved seeds for farmers , he says , the company needs assurances that its seed innovations will be safe from &quot; fly-by-night traders ( who ) set_up shop &quot; and resell them . Without these protections , won during contentious GATT negotiations , many seed corporations would not come_to India . The issue of intellectual property_rights -- for farmers , corporations and national sovereignty -- is a source of great disagreement and confusion . Indian citizens , trying to understand the trade accords , patents and intellectual-property protection , have had to wade through technical jargon and a slew of acronyms -- GATT , WTO , TRIPs , PBR , UPOV , PVPA , NPBGR , WIPO . In India , citizens have simplified the whole morass to &quot; Dunkel &quot; -- for Arthur Dunkel , the former director general of GATT who presented the draft treaty signed_in Morocco . &quot; Reject Dunkel , Reject Imperialism &quot; is familiar graffiti . During most of the GATT controversy , say its critics , the Indian government did little to help its own cause , neglecting to make the treaty available in any of the 16 major Indian languages . Citizens have been left mainly with vague reassurances about long-term benefits or somber assessments of a new global reality in which national governments will cede much of the responsibility for economic well-being to outside forces . &quot; We are no longer the controllers of the economy but promoters and facilitators , &quot; Minister of State for Industry Krishna Sahi told reporters the day after the GATT accord was signed . Leaders of the anti-GATT forces , for their part , often added more heat than light . At mass rallies , they claimed that under the GATT pact , farmers will be prohibited from selling or exchanging seeds or even saving them for the next year ' s planting . Such restrictions could go_into effect when the World Trade Organization reviews intellectual-property rights , among other things , in 1998 , which has generated the specter of a Draconian world in which farmers would be virtually forced to buy seeds from multinationals . But that is not the case under the current agreement . Between corporate demands that their agricultural innovations be protected and farmers ' demands that their genetic heritage be preserved lie several basic questions : Who owns a seed ? Who owns a biological property ? Who owns the life_form creating a new seed from the genes of four or five others ? The difficult relationship between ancient custom and Western science , between farmers ' rights and corporations ' entrepreneurship , between indigenous knowledge and First World intellect , is revealed in the debate over an ancient plant that has been part of Indian life since before the birth of Christ . The neem_tree is fundamental to rural India . Neem-leaf juice prevents scabies and other skin disorders . Rabindranath Tagore , the great Indian poet and Nobel laureate , is said to have drunk it every morning for his health . Villagers brush their teeth with neem twigs . Gandhi chewed neem leaves before his meals . And for centuries , farmers have scattered neem leaves on their fields , using it as a natural insecticide . Now the American-based multinational W.R. Grace &amp; Co. , the world ' s largest producer of specialty chemicals , has developed neem-based bio-pesticides in India and sells them in the United States . American patents for Neemix were granted because the scientific process involved an &quot; inventive step &quot; -- stabilizing and purifying the natural pesticide inherent in neem . Nanjundaswamy claims that , because of GATT , farmers are now legally prohibited from using neem leaves on their fields . This is not true . Grace has not even obtained Indian patents , says corporate vice_president Martin B . Sherwin . &quot; We have no intellectual-property protection in India , nor are we interested in any , &quot; he says . But critics of Grace say that once Indian patent law is brought into conformity with GATT , the U.S. patents for neem will essentially take_effect in India . &quot; The moment GATT comes_into force , &quot; says Devinder Sharma , Delhi journalist and author of &quot; GATT and India : The Politics of Agriculture , &quot; &quot; India will be obliged to honor the patent . The effect will be that farmers will not be allowed to use the seeds of neem. &quot; Sherwin denies this . Yet there may be something more fundamental than patents at_issue here . Neemix spray , which will likely earn substantial profits , is based in a property first identified by farmers in India and elsewhere in Asia . Grace has no plan , and no mechanism , for compensating anyone in India for a share_in the neem patent . &quot; It is of Indian origin , &quot; says Sesha Reddy . &quot; It is our material . It belongs_to the entire nation. &quot; But the real innovation , Sherwin responds , only came_in 1959 , when a German scientist identified the property within neem , azadirachtin , that makes_it a good insecticide . This scientific breakthrough , Sherwin says , is far more sophisticated than any indigenous knowledge of neem ' s properties . The fact that Indian farmers already knew neem was a good insecticide is more akin to &quot; folk medicine -- like what root might be better to chew to cure a headache. &quot; And that , says Sherwin , &quot; is_well outside my ability to comment on. &quot; P . REMENANDAN IS STANDING IN AN AIRTIGHT , LOW-HUMIDITY REFRIGERATED room . In this cooler , and in the deep-freeze across the hall , 30 # 000 varieties of sorghum seeds lie_in small containers arranged 35 to a tray . Down the hall is a similarly vast collection of millet and another of chickpeas . Elsewhere in India and around the world , collections of corn , rice and wheat seeds -- virtually every known species of select agricultural crops -- have been stored before they vanish into biological history . &quot; The traditional varieties are disappearing , &quot; Remenandan says , his soft voice carrying just above the drone of industrial coolers . A food geneticist , Remenandan works_at the gene bank at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics , 250 miles north of Bangalore . Bankrolled by national governments , the U.N. and various funding agencies , ICRISAT is part of a global research effort whose mission is to increase crop yields to feed a world population expected to expand by 3 billion over the next 30 years . &quot; Those genes have been formed after millions of years of evolution , &quot; says Remenandan , picking_up an airtight aluminum container . &quot; They cannot be cre-ated overnight . If they are not conserved , they will disappear forever. &quot; The diversity of the world ' s agricultural crops began to decline in 1944 , near the end of World_War_II , when , ironically , Vice_President Henry Wallace and officials of the Rockefeller Foundation launched a program to feed the hungry of the Third_World . Plant breeder Norman Borlaug left his classified DuPont defense lab for Mexico , where he was asked to devise a highly productive variety of wheat . By 1954 , Borlaug had crossbred Japanese wheat varieties with Mexican wheat , creating a &quot; miracle seed &quot; that would forever change global agriculture . The Green_Revolution was born in the name of peace and abundance -- and to thwart the spread of communism in the rural Third_World . Borlaug , for his part , has always emphasized the program ' s social agenda . &quot; Children born into this world , &quot; he says , &quot; have the right to the basic necessities for a decent life , starting with food. &quot; Scientists he inspired soon brought similar leaps in rice production in the Philippines and Southeast_Asia . In 1966 , Indian officials imported 18 # 000 tons of Borlaug ' s miracle seeds from Mexico , resulting in extraordinary jumps in wheat production in Punjab and other regions . In receiving the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize , Norman Borlaug -- and the Green_Revolution -- were credited with fending off starvation for millions in the Third_World . But the miracle seeds brought unexpected consequences . Green_Revolution farmers were told that the miracle depended_on the addition of chemical fertilizers . For many farmers in the Punjab and elsewhere , the excitement of the first few years subsided as they put more and more chemicals on their land just to match the output of the previous year . And as genetic uniformity replaced biological diversity , the new monoculture became increasingly vulnerable to disease and pests . Against the threat of plagues and massive crop losses , researchers began setting_up their refrigerated gene banks to conserve genetic material in case new disease-free varieties were needed -- and to preserve indoors the very species they helped to displace in nature . In the fields , pests developed resistance , forcing farmers to increase their use of chemical pesticides . Costs shot_up , small_farmers left in droves for the cities , and some Indian nationalists charged that the Green_Revolution was part of a Western conspiracy . &quot; The Green_Revolution strategy integrated Third_World farmers into the global markets of fertilizers , pesticides and seeds and disintegrated their organic links with their soil and communities , &quot; writes Vandana Shiva , a leading intellectual in the Indian opposition to GATT , in her 1991 book &quot; The Violence of the Green Revolution. &quot; &quot; Having destroyed nature ' s mechanisms for controlling pests through the destruction of diversity , the ' miracle ' seeds of the Green_Revolution became mechanisms for breeding new pests and creating new diseases . . . and with them the ever-increasing demand for pesticides. &quot; GATT , charges Nanjundaswamy , will open_up Indian agriculture to another massive transformation , built_on the seed-and-chemical model of the Green_Revolution . &quot; GATT is the beginning of the second chapter , &quot; says the professor , himself a disillusioned Green_Revolution farmer . But there is a difference . The first Green_Revolution was largely a public effort . Funds came from foundations , governments and U.N. agencies . Research was shared . Seeds were exchanged in the interest of increasing food production . And though its benefits are still debated -- a recent survey by the Indian National Institute of Nutrition indicates that about 90 % of Indian children 5 and under still suffer some form of malnutrition -- few doubt the motives of people like Norman Borlaug in serving a social good . But now global agricultural research is moving inexorably into private hands . Green_Revolution centers like ICRISAT , for example , have had their budgets slashed by an estimated 30 % in the past three years . At the same time , more and more publicly funded research is being directed toward corporate use . As the Green_Revolution took its toll on the environment , it became clear that new seeds were needed , seeds that depended less on chemicals . S.K. Kapoor , managing director of Proagro Seeds Company Ltd. , a New Delhi-based seed company , says that chemical corporations &quot; became apprehensive . If seeds are being made resistant to pesticides and insecticides , what happens to the chemical companies ? The demand for insecticides will go_down . So they started buying seed companies. &quot; In the 1970s and ' 80s , there were more_than 1 # 000 corporate chemical buyouts of seed companies around the world , according to Pat Mooney , author of &quot; Seeds of the Earth &quot; and a leading expert on the loss of genetic diversity . &quot; The ulterior motive , &quot; says Kapoor , &quot; was that there should be a regular demand of pesticide and insecticide. &quot; Subsequent events bear him out , especially in the field of agricultural biotechnology . Biotechnology allows scientists to genetically engineer seeds for specific properties -- resistance to disease or pests or drought , for example , which would help make the seeds more productive . But most testing for genetic_engineering in the industrial world since 1986 has not attempted to make seeds hardier or more nutritious or to help them survive better in saline soil or high winds . Instead , biotechnicians have tried to make them resistant to herbicides , thus allowing farmers to kill most weeds and other plants but not the biologically protected crop . Monsanto , for example , has devised a way to make tomatoes resistant to Roundup , allowing_for sales of both the seed and the powerful herbicide and assuring the continued use of chemicals on food crops . Initial marketing for &quot; Roundup ready &quot; seed will be in the United States . Monsanto , DuPont , Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc have done similar tests for other crops , including soybeans , corn , potatoes , wheat and cotton . &quot; We ' re certainly not encouraging farmers to use more chemicals , &quot; says Karen Marshall , director of public relations for Monsanto ' s agricultural group . &quot; But farmers need to control weeds . If you hoe those lands , you could end_up with soil_erosion . You could lose ground moisture. &quot; Because Roundup is a broad-spectrum herbicide , Marshall says , &quot; our hope is that we ' ll be able to reduce overall herbicide use. &quot; ACACIA TREES AND MUSTARD fields flank the road on the outskirts of Delhi . A turbaned farmer , near the end of a long trek from Rajasthan state , leads his cows to summer pasture . Bulging sacks of fodder perch on wooden carts , hauled slowly up the road by Rajasthani camels . India ' s ancient system will be modernized , says J.S. Sindhu , Proagro ' s director_of_research , but he has a bleak vision of the changes the multinationals will bring . &quot; Suppose the farmer has got two acres of land , &quot; Sindhu says , pointing_out the window of his white sedan . &quot; You are a multinational . You come_to him and say , ' You ' re not making any headway. ' And you have come_with a formula to convince him that if he produces this certain crop exclusively , he ' ll be better_off . You say , ' I have got a tomato seed . This tomato will give you 200 # 000 rupees ( about $ 6 # 500 ) from these two acres . The total you earn now is 125 # 000 ( $ 4 # 000 ) . You can put this difference in the bank , educate your kids , have a nice house , buy a scooter . . . . ' That is the dream. &quot; It is also the kind of direct corporation-to-farmer marketing that the Indian government is now encouraging . At first , Sindhu says , only a_few farmers will experiment with the new seeds , and then only on a portion of their land . &quot; But seeing is believing , &quot; he says . &quot; It only takes six years , and everybody switches . In certain areas , you will find only one crop exclusively -- on 200 # 000 , 250 # 000 acres , even on 2 million acres . The chances of epidemics will be very high . Any time you put monocultures in vast areas , it is not scientifically safe . You are working against variability . You are working against nature . And when you work against nature , you have to be prepared to face the consequences. &quot; The consequences , says Arun Kumar , economist at Jawaharlal Nehru University , will be a repetition of the Green_Revolution -- chemical dependency , soil sterilization , water-table contamination , genetic loss and urban flight for small_farmers who can ' t afford the increasing costs of pesticides and fertilizers . But unlike the Green_Revolution , Kumar argues , corporations like Cargill will not necessarily focus_on producing food for India ' s poor . Oil from Cargill ' s sunflower_seed , for example , or PepsiCo ' s potato_chips and export-quality basmati rice will go_to those who can afford it -- to India ' s middle and upper_classes and to consumers in the First World . &quot; What will be produced is what can sell in the other countries , &quot; says Kumar , principal author of the annual alternative budget , a critique of the government ' s liberalization policies by a coalition of opposition parties . &quot; The richer countries have 85 % of the world ' s purchasing power , so the cropping pattern will shift to the requirements of the advanced nations . What the average Indian requires is unlikely to be produced . The Indian poor will suffer . The food security of the whole Indian economy will suffer a great deal. &quot; &quot; Food security is not in danger , &quot; replies Finance Secretary Montek Singh Ahluwalia . First , he argues , the amount of land dedicated to export crops will not threaten India ' s production of basic food_grains . Second , &quot; as you move to an agriculture open_to export possibilities , you generate higher income for agricultural producers . This feeds_back in to better investment in their fields . India easily could double its yields per acre. &quot; Higher yields , Ahluwalia argues , will give farmers better harvests , more income and therefore more buying power , which is the ultimate security against hunger . And higher yields can only be assured , say executives like Cargill ' s John Hamilton , if multinationals are allowed to market more productive seeds . Indian farmers , he says , want to buy quality seed that will give them consistently good yields . Cargill ' s sales for sunflower and corn seed are already up 300 % over last year . &quot; If that seed is going_to come from a foreign company operating in India , it is of no consequence to the farmer. &quot; BENEATH A PEEPAL TREE IN THE southern India village of Gobbedi , on a stone worn smooth from countless generations of sitting , villagers join Sesha Reddy , the farmer who has spent much of the last two years opposing Cargill and the multinationals . Like many in the farmers ' movement , Reddy once believed_in the Green_Revolution . But he speaks now with the fervor of a man who has lost one faith and , after some searching , found another . &quot; In its youth , just like people , the Green_Revolution was beautiful , &quot; he says . &quot; But after some aging , it is going away. &quot; Reddy is now a convert to indigenous , sustainable agriculture , part of a local network of farmers who are practicing traditional techniques and are working with Indian geneticists to set_up their own gene bank . &quot; We have to go_back to the nature , &quot; he says . &quot; we ' ll go green now -- instead of Green Revolution. &quot; But in the face of multimillion-dollar foreign investments encouraged by the government , the Indian farmers ' movement faces long odds . Although small seed-saving collectives and indigenous associations have sprung_up throughout the country , the demonstrations against GATT have quieted since the April signing , provoking some analysts to predict that the movement will fade . Reddy , though , insists a significant number of Indian farmers will reject the &quot; new colonization. &quot; They will withdraw , he says , from the global economy by building a Gandhian system of self-reliance . He likes to quote the great poet , Rabindranath Tagore : &quot; Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high ; &quot; Where knowledge is free . . . . &quot; Into that heaven of freedom , my Father , let my country awake . &quot; &quot; Where knowledge is free ! &quot; repeats Reddy . &quot; Knowledge should not be for the enrichment of the individual . It should be for the community. &quot; Across the road , farmers prepare the paddies for the new rice plantings . Frogs and crickets call from the darkening fields . &quot; Monopoly is not life , &quot; says Reddy . &quot; Only in sharing there is life. &quot;</TEXT>
