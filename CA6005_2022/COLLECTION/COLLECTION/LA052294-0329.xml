   <TEXT> Everything Barney Oldfield ever learned , he learned from the movies . He even made_it into &quot; Ripley ' s Believe It or Not &quot; by seeing all_the movies that came_out between late 1936 and the end of 1937 . For a kid from a small_town in Nebraska , the Saturday night movie was the biggest thing in life . Until June 6 , 1944 -- D-day , the Allied invasion of Normandy , the biggest military operation yet and the turning point of the war in Europe . Oldfield didn ' t see any action on the front_lines but he might as well have . Col . Barney Oldfield U.S.A.F. ( Ret. ) , 85 , of Westwood , had the unique job as the liaison between the military and the war correspondents . A public relations man with the most important campaign in history . His job was twofold : Before the invasion he had to satiate reporters hungry for tidbits on the rumored invasion and , when it was_on , he had to figure_out how to move 100 million words out of Normandy -- without modern luxuries such_as fax machines and satellite telephones . &quot; One of the many problems was the question ( of ) which reporter had the right to the Normandy dateline , &quot; Oldfield recalled . &quot; That was settled when a journalist named Robert Reuben took two carrier_pigeons with leg capsules , one in each hand holding the wings down , and parachuted with the 101st Airborne onto Carentan at 3:30 a.m. on June 6 . Reuben ( of the Reuters news_agency ) had decided to gamble on carrier_pigeons as part of his personal communications_equipment . At impact he let the pigeons go . A call was directed to me and the voice on the other end said , ' We got some pigeons here with leg capsules , can we open them ? ' Well , when they did they saw the words ' Landed Normandy Reuben Reuters ( sic ) ' written_on cigarette rolling papers , &quot; Oldfield said . One problem solved . * Oldfield remembers the names and spellings of every correspondent he ever met and every town he visited . He still has that way of talking , which a generation of the great journalists share . It is a kind of knowing that seems to say , &quot; I was a part of history that could only be told through the power of words and pictures. &quot; So listen as Oldfield tells and tells . &quot; Fifty-eight correspondents were selected to be_on the first wave for the invasion of Normandy , &quot; he said , recalling a grim task in the days before the invasion . &quot; In May , 1944 , I was told to secure some apartments in an obscure section of London . The correspondents were instructed to come_to this address alone . I was there in one of the apartments -- no furniture -- with a typewriter and asked them their telephone_numbers so that they can be told when to go and I also told them the items they could take with them . &quot; I told them they had to understand if they leaked information they could die . They weren ' t above the fray ; they were part of it . Then I had to ask them to sit_down at the typewriter and write their own obituaries . Ernie Pyle of Scripps-Howard had a premonition that he would be killed and when he wrote his obit I remember he said , ' . . . and when this happens ' -- not ' if ' -- ' please tell my syndicate manager and have him tell my wife , not the military. ' He died in the Pacific and I never had to handle that one. &quot; Before the invasion there was speculation that it was imminent . Many news_stories talked_about how &quot; sorrow will come_to a_million homes. &quot; Oldfield did the advance work for a visit from President Eisenhower , British Prime_Minister Winston Churchill , British Gen . Bernard Montgomery and U.S. Gen . Omar Bradley to the troops waiting in England for the order to invade . Oldfield remembers how Eisenhower told the soldiers they would be given the best chance to get_on shore and not to be dismayed by the rumors . There were smaller moments at this visit too . &quot; The 101st Airborne had a display of weapons . Churchill asked Eisenhower how many yards the 81 mm mortar would reach and Eisenhower said 3 # 000 . One of the soldiers piped_up and said ' 3 # 250. ' Eisenhower turned_to him and said , ' Son , you ' re not going_to make a liar out of me in front of the prime_minister for a lousy 250 yards. ' &quot; Oldfield goes_on . &quot; Churchill had a cold . There were 9 # 000 troops standing at attention in front of him . He told them to break ranks and he got_up on the hood of a Jeep . He took_off his bowler_hat and out of his mouth came the words I will never forget : ' I stand before you with no unrealized ambitions except to see Adolf Hitler wiped_off the face of the earth. ' The troops went crazy. &quot; * Once the invasion was_on , Oldfield used his ingenuity to ensure words and pictures made_it out . To get the film back from the many photographers who risked their lives on the beaches , Oldfield had courier boats and special canvas bags with red stripes on them . The order was if you saw the bag , throw it on the boat . He also distributed condoms to press and Army Signal Corps photographers , but not for what you might think . &quot; History will always owe a debt to these contraceptives , at least , the ones used according to our directions . Each cameraman was advised to drop his completed film pack into one of these rubber receptacles and close it tight with a knot . This would provide the negatives with a raincoat of sorts to ward_off seepage or splashing salt water. &quot; Today , 50 years after D-day , Oldfield is launching yet another campaign . He wants to publicize the Nebraska Scholarship Fund , endowed in honor of four men from Nebraska who died on Omaha Beach in the first hours of the invasion : Privates 1st_Class Marcellino Shata , Paul Scott Rodstrom and Lester J . Horn and Corp . Herbert Leonard , technician 4th grade . They were four of the 2 # 132 Allied troops who died on the first day of the invasion . Said Oldfield : &quot; It ain ' t about great patriotic giants . It ' s about the little guys who stay in a position that they know is untenable . They ' re the ones who win the war. &quot;</TEXT>
