   <HEADLINE> TURNING THE TABLES ; TRIBE ' S CASINO SUCCESS UPSETS RURAL AREA ' S POWER_STRUCTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a drive north along rural Route 2 , amid the postcard-pretty woodlands of southeastern Connecticut , the Foxwoods High Stakes Bingo and Casino appears out of nowhere , a baroque palace in teal and white that dominates the countryside from a lordly hilltop perch . It ' s an unlikely establishment in more ways than one : an immense , Las Vegas-style casino and hotel plunked_down amid quaint New England villages and centuries-old dairy_farms . It is owned by a tiny , long-forgotten tribe of Native_Americans -- and poised to become a major destination resort . For the Mashantucket Pequot , the casino represents a historic turning of the tables , a restoration of the dominant economic position they enjoyed before being all but exterminated more_than 300 years ago . For the tribe ' s partners -- including Burbank-based Iwerks Entertainment , which recently opened the first of its high-tech &quot; Cinetropolis &quot; entertainment_centers at the complex -- it is a chance to test the latest concepts in family fun . But for the non-Native American locals , who until a_few years ago had never given the Pequot a second_thought , the casino is a strange and troubling phenomenon . It is a source of jobs -- and many are grateful for that -- but some wonder whether casino gambling is the solution for the area ' s economy . Many have joined a vociferous campaign to block a proposed expansion of the Pequot reservation . Nominally , the controversy is about taxes , zoning and obscure Interior_Department regulations . The real issue , though , is far more profound : Just whose land is this anyway , and who has the right to make decisions about development ? &quot; We need more developable land , &quot; said John Holder , a tribe member who oversees construction at Foxwoods . &quot; People ( who oppose expansion ) say : ' This farm has been in our family for 300 years. ' Yeah , ever since you took it away from the Indians. &quot; If the Mashantucket Pequot and the three towns abutting the reservation agree on one thing , it is that the turnabout has happened incredibly quickly . It ' s been just two years since the tribe , having successfully fought a decade-long legal battle , replaced its modest bingo parlor with a full-blown casino . And it has been barely a year since the Pequot installed their first slot_machines , following a hugely controversial deal with the state of Connecticut . Yet Foxwoods is now the largest casino in the nation outside Las Vegas . And with revenue estimated at $ 600 million to $ 700 million a year , no immediate competition and relatively low costs , it may be the most profitable . It has become a model for would-be Native_American casino operators across the nation -- and an example of the conflicts such operations can bring . Despite subzero temperatures one recent weekend , the complex was mobbed . In the two huge gambling halls , young couples and retirees alike jostled for space at craps tables and roulette_wheels , where on this weekend evening the minimum wager was $ 25 , considerably higher than in most Las Vegas casinos . Families promenaded along the indoor shopping strip , where the stores -- all owned and run_by the tribe -- are trimmed with Victorian facades . In one of the complex ' s broad foyers , a glass sculpture of a Native_American fires &quot; rain arrows &quot; into the sky . Faux-Indian motifs , as well as genuine Native_American sculpture , dominate the decor in a low-key imitation of Vegas kitsch . The stereotypes -- cocktail waitresses with feathers in their hair -- do not bother Holder . &quot; This is all a fantasy anyway , &quot; he said with a shrug . * Down at the Cinetropolis -- a cluster of attractions including a film simulation ride , a 360-degree movie and a giant screen theater -- some of the non-gamblers who came_to Foxwoods &quot; just to see what it ' s all about &quot; seemed happy with what they found . &quot; We ' d definitely come_back , &quot; said Jeff and Marilyn Goldwasser , a thirty-something couple from Trumbull , Conn . &quot; This is family entertainment , &quot; Jeff added . &quot; You can come here and do the games , have dinner , go dancing -- lots of stuff. &quot; As evening closed_in , the Cinetropolis ' 360-degree theater metamorphosed into a discotheque , serving a young crowd that included many casino employees . By summer there will be other attractions , including a virtual-reality ride that puts patrons at the controls of a simulated submarine . For those who are not so hot on high-tech , Foxwoods also has begun hosting big-time live entertainment . Frank Sinatra played a weeklong engagement in November . Almost overnight , Foxwoods has become the hot spot in this corner of the Northeast . Most of the customers come not from New York or Boston -- though each is just two to three hours away -- but from Connecticut and Rhode Island and nearby parts of Massachusetts . And almost all_of them -- up_to 25 # 000 a day -- come_by car , screaming along once-quiet country roads . that ' s the first complaint of residents in Ledyard , North Stonington and Preston , all venerable but tiny communities with only a handful of stores , a_few churches and acre upon acre of rocky farms and rolling hills . Traffic , though , is only a small piece of the evolving relationship between the tribe and the towns . It ' s a relationship that for much of the past year has been centered_on the tribe ' s effort to annex additional land to its 1 # 230-acre reservation . The Pequot , with just 305 members , already own the land in_question -- one 247-acre parcel and an additional 1 # 100 acres of lakes and forests that were once a Boy_Scout camp . With backing from their financial partner -- a Malaysian development company called Kien Huat Realty -- and support from the casino management team led by veteran Atlantic_City gaming attorney G . Michael Brown , they plan to build two golf_courses , a theme park , tennis_courts and a skeet-shooting range , among other attractions , as well as some tribal health and safety facilities . * At issue is whether The Pequot should be allowed to add the land to their reservation -- and thus render their development exempt from taxes , zoning regulations , health and safety rules and all other local and state laws . Under federal law , such annexations are permitted as a way to promote the welfare of Native_Americans . The Pequot say they need the land and have a right to annex it . The towns , however , say there ' s only a right to apply for the annexation -- and that the application should be denied because the tribe doesn ' t need additional land for economic health and self-sufficiency . &quot; No Annexation . Not One Acre. &quot; is the slogan of community groups that are fighting the tribe ' s plan . While local officials take a more pragmatic view of the issue and are inclined to at least consider negotiating -- the Pequot at one point offered each town $ 1 million a year for five years not to oppose annexation -- the activists are uncompromising . &quot; It ' s our town , &quot; said Madeline Jeffery , a weaver and former schoolteacher who has lived_in North Stonington for 23 years . &quot; The boundaries were set_in 1717 . We have a history , we have a heritage . If you want to buy land , fine , but go_along with our rules. &quot; Jeffery and other activists succeeded in_forcing local referendums on the issue , and residents voted overwhelmingly in November to require their town governments to oppose annexation . Following the votes , Interior_Secretary Bruce Babbitt intervened , saying he would name a &quot; facilitator &quot; to promote dialogue between the towns and the tribe . The appointment is expected any day . Chatting with community activists in community resident Ann Brown ' s sunny sitting room , it ' s easy to see why many townsfolk are not enthused about an expanding resort in their midst . The titmice and cardinals are frolicking outside the window , the stone fences and sloping fields of the family dairy lie blanketed in snow . &quot; The citizens of this community are taking the lead , &quot; said Brown , who is not related to the gaming attorney . &quot; Without our efforts , the federal_government would already have said ' yes ' to annexation. &quot; &quot; The tribe ' s use of the land_up until now has not been one of conservation or preservation , but of high development , &quot; Jeffery said . &quot; If they were to annex ( the former Boy_Scout camp ) , there goes another stunning piece of land. &quot; In fact , the annexation debate is multilayered . Some opponents seem driven mainly by the principle that the towns should retain jurisdiction over the land . Others object to the resort development plans -- and presumably will object even if annexation is blocked . Still others appear motivated by anger over the very existence of the casino and the sudden power of the tribe . Cindy Brewster , a young mother from Ledyard who heads one of the activist groups , alleges that the Pequot harbor feelings of &quot; vicious hatred and vengeance &quot; toward the non-Native American townsfolk . She says her house is virtually unmarketable because of uncertainty over the tribe ' s expansion plans . To be sure , the Pequot can be imperious in their dealings . They have not kept the towns well informed of their plans . In their satisfaction over achieving what they regard_as historical justice , they sometimes seem dismissive of the townspeople ' s concerns . &quot; If the property has to be controlled through the zoning_boards , it really slows_down the development process , &quot; said Barbara Hartwell , one of seven members of a tribal council that governs all major tribe decisions . Of course , slowing_down development to assure minimal impact on surrounding land and residents is the very reason for local zoning rules . Hartwell insists that the tribe always has been open_to discussion , saying it is the activists who have polarized the debate with their &quot; Not One Acre &quot; slogan . &quot; Making that statement means you ' re not willing to discuss anything , &quot; she said . &quot; If you make ultimatums , that causes a problem. &quot; Sitting in her office at the tribe ' s new community_center -- which features an indoor swimming_pool and gymnasium , Hartwell added : &quot; Back when there were just a_few people ( living_in trailers ) up here , no one cared . The towns would not provide any services or get involved. &quot; Now , the tribe has become a major contributor to local charities . It also plans to use some of its newfound wealth to build a $ 100-million Native_American museum and research_center , which would be the largest such institution in the nation . * Certainly , the Pequot have a right to be proud_of their achievements . Once an economic powerhouse in the region thanks to its control of wampum , the shell currency used in the fur trade , the tribe was crippled by wars and smallpox and nearly wiped_out in a brutal 1637 massacre . By the early 1900s , just a handful of tribe members still lived_on a tiny reservation . The tribe began its comeback in the 1970s , suing to regain reservation land and later establishing a bingo hall . After the courts ruled that the state ' s sanctioning of charity &quot; Las Vegas nights &quot; meant Native_Americans could offer card_games , the casino was opened in February , 1992 . Slot_machines came the following January , after the tribe agreed to pay the state 25 % of all slot_machine revenues or $ 100 million per year , whichever is more . The Pequot also note that for all_the noise made by a_few local residents , they have an excellent relationship with the state_government and many localities a little farther away . ( For their part , many in Ledyard , Preston and North Stonington say they feel that state officials sold them out with the slot_machine deal , which yields little for the towns most affected by the casino. ) And then there are the jobs -- right now about 8 # 050 of them . Many pay poorly , with salaries starting at around $ 6 an hour . But many do not , and the Pequot are proud_of the fact that all full-time employees get full benefits and free meals . Most casino workers interviewed spoke highly of their employer . Jobs are especially welcome in a region long dependent_on a_few big defense_contractors . The Electric Boat Co. , a submarine builder in nearby Groton , still employs about 13 # 000 people , but that ' s down from 22 # 000 just a_few years ago . And more cuts are coming . &quot; Without the casino , we would be in very serious trouble , &quot; said Michael Seder , chairman of the Ledyard Town Council . In the river town of Norwich , only about 10 miles from the casino , abandoned munitions factories and textile_mills line the waterfront . The downtown shopping district , with its vintage 19th-century brick buildings , is clearly struggling . Many here regard the casino as the region ' s great hope , and the tribe even talks_of building a monorail that could provide a direct link to Norwich . Along the coast about 15 miles to the south , there is already a healthy tourist business centered around the Mystic Seaport and Aquarium . Having a casino nearby adds_to the region ' s allure as a tourist destination -- though some fear it simply will siphon_off visitors who would have spent their money elsewhere . In fact , many towns in the area -- not to mention depressed cities such_as Hartford and Bridgeport -- would kill to get a piece of the gambling trade . Several other tribes , as well as casino magnates such_as Donald Trump and Mirage Resorts Chairman Steve Wynn , are heavily engaged in a convoluted battle over gaming in the region . It seems almost certain that the Pequot will face competition within the next couple of years . * Yet questions linger about the long-term effects of gambling on the economy . Antoni Borowski , an immigrant from Poland , has converted a 125-year-old factory building in Norwich into a restaurant and bakery . But business has been terrible lately , and Borowski says the casino is partly to blame . &quot; There ' s big traffic , but nobody stops to eat , &quot; he said . Even some of his regular customers now go gambling instead of going_out to eat , he said . Worse , Foxwoods has declined to buy any of his fresh-baked products . And with his business in Chapter 11 bankruptcy , Borowski says he cannot match the health benefits and other opportunities that the casino offers employees , making_it hard for him to keep staff . &quot; Ten years from now , everything down here will be condemned , &quot; he said . &quot; All this is good for the big people , but nobody does anything for the little people. &quot;</TEXT>
