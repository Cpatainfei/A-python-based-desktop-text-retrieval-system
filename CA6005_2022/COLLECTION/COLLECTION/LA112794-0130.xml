   <TEXT> I was heartened to hear of studios ' efforts to restore and release much-loved and unavailable film classics for home video ( &quot; A Trip Down Celluloid Lane , &quot; by Susan King , Nov . 13 ) . Two of the titles mentioned -- &quot; Porgy and Bess &quot; and &quot; Annie Get Your Gun &quot; -- are held_up in a legal limbo that would tax King Solomon . Last year in an interview with The Times , the lawyer for the Gershwin estate bluntly stated that all effort was being brought_to_bear on finding and destroying any existing copies of Sam Goldwyn ' s production of &quot; Porgy and Bess , &quot; directed by Otto Preminger and starring Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandridge . The reason given was the late Ira Gershwin ' s dislike of the film ; he felt that his opera had been turned_into a musical , a fair assessment that nonetheless disparages the sizable talent involved : Sammy Davis Jr. , Pearl Bailey and the voice of Robert McFerrin . In response to my fax , Academy of Motion_Picture Arts and Sciences President Arthur Hiller was kind enough to investigate , and in his reply he assured me that a safety negative was secure in the Goldwyn vaults . While I was cheered to know this , I am still dismayed that future generations will be denied the opportunity to see this classic . Another executive who was helpful in my quest , Dick May of Turner Entertainment , detailed the similar plight of &quot; Annie Get Your Gun , &quot; which starred Betty Hutton and Howard Keel . May said the late Irving Berlin was disappointed in Hutton , having had his heart set_on Judy Garland , who was fired from the production because of her instability . In addition , his heirs fear that the stereotypical representations of Native_Americans might be found offensive . The result ? An inventory of ready-to-market restored copies of &quot; Annie &quot; sitting in a warehouse . I find the efforts of the Gershwin and Berlin heirs to deny audiences the chance to view these films an abomination to cinematic history and a violation of the rights of the other artists involved in these productions .
