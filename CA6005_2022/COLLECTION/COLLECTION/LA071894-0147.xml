   <TEXT> The collision of a rogue comet and Jupiter is quickly unfolding as a fierce and sobering celestial cataclysm , astronomers around the world reported Sunday . The Keck Telescope in Hawaii captured images of two comet fragments exploding into giant , gaseous fireballs hotter than the surface of the sun . The Hubble Space Telescope photographed a 2 # 500-mile-wide mushroom_cloud erupting hundreds of miles into space from a detonation more powerful than any nuclear_weapon on Earth . &quot; We are all flabbergasted at what we are seeing , &quot; said planetary scientist Heidi B . Hammel , who is leading the team of scientists gathered_in Maryland to analyze the images taken by NASA ' s space telescope . &quot; We can be very glad that this comet was heading for Jupiter and not Earth. &quot; It is the first time humanity has seen a comet hit a planet , although many planetary experts believe that Earth -- like the other planets in the solar_system -- has been hit thousands , if not millions , of times in eons past . By late Sunday , seven clumps of comet debris had smashed into Jupiter at speeds in excess of 130 # 000 m.p.h. Another 14 major pieces of the shattered comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 are expected to hit by Friday . At least four of the fragments nearing the planet are believed to be about two miles in diameter . The smallest fragment to hit so far -- a half-mile-wide ball of compacted ice and rock that struck Jupiter on Saturday -- released so_much explosive energy that on Earth it would vaporize a city the size of Los Angeles in an instant , comet scientists said . At the same time , it would hurl enough dust and debris into the upper atmosphere to dangerously disrupt the world ' s climate , they said . Scientists and astronomers estimated the force of its impact at 10 million megatons of TNT . It left a spreading plume of hot gas and debris almost as big as Earth itself . &quot; If that had hit North_America , it would probably be the worst natural disaster ever witnessed by man , and that ' s from the small fragment , &quot; said Eugene Shoemaker , co-discoverer of the comet . One of the largest pieces , with a mass about 25 times greater , was expected to strike Jupiter early this morning . More_than 200 major observatories were poised to record the results . &quot; This is the World Cup of astronomy , &quot; said Stephen P . Maran , a senior scientist at NASA ' s Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland , which is coordinating reports on the collision . All of the impacts occur on Jupiter ' s dark side , out of direct view of Earth . Therefore , almost nothing of the comet ' s violent interplay with Jupiter is visible to the naked eye or with the small telescopes used by many amateur comet watchers . Very little of the celestial fireworks is visible under normal light . Professional astronomers are relying_on the artificial eyes that science has given them , discerning the true extent of the cataclysm by peering deep into the infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths as the impact sites rotate out of shadow and into view of Earth . Unlike the infrared photographs , conventional pictures of Jupiter taken through major telescopes this weekend show the impact sites as dark smears or splotches against the giant planet ' s candy-striped bands of ammonia clouds . Scientists speculated Sunday that the dark material could be a fountain of dust and debris rocketing skyward from the disintegrating comet fragment . Others suggested it could be gases stirred_up from deep within Jupiter ' s atmosphere . But to the infrared sensors of the Keck , the Hubble and other telescopes , which are sensitive to the heat generated by each impact , the plumes stand_out as white-hot blazes . Hammel said the temperature of the swirling gases at the center of each fireball could top 53 # 000 degrees Fahrenheit . Glenn Orton , a scientist from Pasadena ' s Jet_Propulsion Laboratory who is observing the impacts through NASA ' s Infrared Telescope Facility in Hawaii , easily detected two of the impact sites . &quot; I am very ecstatic , &quot; he said Sunday . &quot; Witnessing this is kind of amazing. &quot; Astronomers at the South_Pole observatory , which because of its unique location is able to keep Jupiter under continuous observation during the collisions , reported that they easily detected the plume from the first fragment that struck the planet . From its site atop Mauna Kea on the island of Hawaii , the Keck Telescope was expected to have_the_best view of the severe impact expected about 12:30 a.m. today . The Keck is the largest of the world ' s ground-based telescopes and was the only observatory Sunday to report having observed any traces of the second comet fragment , which hit Jupiter on Saturday evening . &quot; We saw a distinctive signature of the plume , &quot; said James Graham , an astronomer from UC Berkeley who is a principal_investigator at the W . M . Keck Observatory . &quot; It surprises us how bright these impacts are. &quot; Astronomers suspect that the second fragment may have been fainter than the first because it might have been a more loosely compacted swarm of gravel and ice_crystals -- a flying rubble pile -- that exploded high above Jupiter ' s clouds . &quot; The first and second fragments looked equally big prior to the impact , &quot; said Maran at his base in Maryland . &quot; The difference in the impacts might have been the difference between a real hard-packed snowball a nasty adult makes and the kind of loosely packed snowball a kid makes. &quot; Initial observations suggest that the clouds spreading from each impact site may persist for weeks . &quot; It looks pretty clear that this whole band of latitude around Jupiter will be pock-marked with these impact sites , &quot; Hammel said . One of the most dramatic photo sequences recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope this weekend was a series of five images taken by its Wide Field / Planetary Camera , designed and built by JPL engineers , that shows the growth of a mushroom_cloud from the first impact . The images were taken at three-minute intervals as the impact site rotated out of the dark side of Jupiter . They profile the explosion as it erupted more_than 600 miles above the planet ' s highest cloud layer , and &quot; this knocked our socks off , &quot; Hammel said . Unconfirmed reports from observatories in Israel and western Massachusetts suggested that observers had been able to spot the lightning-like flash from at least one of the impacts , flaring near the planet ' s horizon . &quot; It means that other flashes could be visible to people with small telescopes , &quot; said David H . Levy , who helped discover the comet in March , 1993 . &quot; This is a red alert for amateur astronomers. &quot; * Times Link : 808-8463 To commemorate humankind ' s first_steps on the moon 25 years ago this Wednesday , TimesLink features historic audio clips beginning in 1961 with President John F .
