   <HEADLINE> PERSPECTIVE ON MEXICO ; ZEDILLO IS BETTING_ON THE STATUS QUO ; COUNTING ON POPULAR RESISTANCE TO CHANGE , THE NEW PRESIDENT HAS ANNOUNCED REFORMS ONLY IN THE JUDICIARY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Since the 1960s , outgoing Mexican presidents have left_office under a cloud . Since the ' 30s , incoming leaders have blended change and continuity in just the right doses to ensure both a break_with the discredited predecessor and the survival of the political_system and machinery that brought the successor to power . Ernesto Zedillo , last week inaugurated as Mexico ' s 11th consecutive full-term , full-powered and single-party president , is playing by the rules -- and doing so with all_the skill and ingenuity his forerunners have traditionally demonstrated . Mexican presidents since 1934 have sought to reform the one-party , authoritarian political_system . Conventional wisdom notwithstanding , they have proved remarkably successful at changing just as much as necessary to ensure the system ' s survival . All of them have initially hesitated between being the last in the line of the system ' s saviors or the first in_line of the architects of the new system . So with Zedillo : He is intelligently moving to preserve the system , perhaps going_further than others because more is needed , but not to bury it and build something new . The basic premises of his actions are self-evident : First , the system can be saved with significant but feasible repairs ; second , the Mexican people do not believe the system is in crisis , are not fed up with it and , given some changes , prefer continuity to transition . On the first count , Zedillo has installed the first coalition government -- of a sort -- in years by naming a leader of the right-of-center Partido de Accion Nacional ( PAN ) as his attorney_general . This widely praised appointment lends credibility and viability to Zedillo ' s second stage of the system ' s overhaul : the announcement of a major reform of the country ' s judicial process , believed to be the most flawed , corrupt and despised of the nation ' s institutions . While the reform ' s details remain vague and effectiveness in_question , simply by acknowledging the deficiency and promising to amend it , Zedillo has reversed part of the political_system ' s discredit . He will , on this score , still be judged by the results he delivers in the investigation of Mexico ' s two political murders this year , but reforming law_enforcement and the administration of justice is a fine way to begin his term . The third crucial step Zedillo has taken is to reestablish &quot; diplomatic relations &quot; with the other opposition , the left-of-center Democratic Revolutionary Party ( PRD ) , which supported Cuauhtemoc Cardenas ' run_for the presidency in 1994 . During the entire presidency of Carlos Salinas , the country ' s chief_executive and its then main opposition did not even talk publicly , let alone cooperate . Zedillo has taken_advantage of the consequences of Cardenas ' devastating defeat in the August elections to build bridges with the PRD congressional caucus . For now , Zedillo ' s honeymoon with PRD members is contributing to a lowering of tension in Mexico ' s cities if not Mexico ' s politics . These changes are considerable ; a sea change they are not . Indeed , Zedillo ' s message seems to belie the gravity of the system ' s crisis : Everything else is business-as-usual . The rest of the new president ' s Cabinet is lackluster . His inaugural speech , though dotted with moving passages , was mostly uninspiring . Beyond the rhetoric of dialogue and reconciliation , there is so far scant substance . Zedillo appears to believe that there is nothing terribly wrong with Mexico and that a majority of Mexicans agree with him . He may be right . The August vote produced an ample Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) majority , albeit with some tampering . Mexicans are scared of too_much change and the turbulent events of this year -- an armed uprising , two kidnapings , two assassinations , an election and several splits in the PRI -- have not irreparably upset the party ' s legendary hegemony . But if Zedillo is wrong , he is playing with the proverbial fire . The cost the country has paid in the past for each president ' s success in saving the system has been high ; in recent decades , exorbitant . If the system is in fact beyond repair or if the Mexican people have had their fill of it , business-as-usual , however peppered with imagination and verve , will not do .</TEXT>
