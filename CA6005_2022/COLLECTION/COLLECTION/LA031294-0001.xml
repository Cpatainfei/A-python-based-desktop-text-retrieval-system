   <HEADLINE> KNUT ANDERS HAUKELID ; WWII ' HERO OF TELEMARK '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Knut Anders Haukelid , 82 , one of the &quot; Heroes of Telemark &quot; who helped cripple Nazi Germany ' s atomic weapons program in Norway . During the height of World_War_II , Haukelid and eight other Norwegian commandos parachuted into the mountains , on what seemed a suicide mission , to destroy a heavy_water plant near Rjukan in Telemark County.The group stole into the heavily guarded plant on Feb . 27 , 1943 , and blew it up just after midnight . All escaped , and Haukelid remained in the mountains for the rest of the war as a Resistance fighter . The raid inspired several books and movies , including the 1965 film &quot; The Heroes of Telemark &quot; with Kirk Douglas and Richard Harris . Haukelid retired as a lieutenant_colonel in 1973 . In Oslo on Tuesday of heart_failure .</TEXT>
