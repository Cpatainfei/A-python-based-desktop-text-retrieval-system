   <HEADLINE> AT LONG LAST , FAREWELL ; HALF A CENTURY AFTER THE WAR , THE FINAL RUSSIAN TROOPS ARE LEAVING EUROPE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nazi Germany , which Adolf Hitler swore would last for a millennium , was dust and ashes after only a dozen years . The foreign armies whose combined power rolled back Hitler ' s aggression have remained on German soil more_than four times as long . This week the last legatees of the Red Army that conquered Berlin in 1945 are departing . At the same time the last of the Russian troops in the Baltic_states are finally taking their leave . Their presence in Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania dates to 1940 , when the three republics were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet_Union . At the time Nazi Germany and the Soviet_Union were , if not exactly bosom allies , then at least eager conspirators in plans to dismember Europe . That lasted until mid-1941 , when Germany turned_on the Soviet_Union and set_off what became the costliest conflict ever waged between two nations . The map of Europe was revised again after World_War_II and redrawn yet again when communist control over Eastern Europe collapsed and the Soviet_Union imploded . Few people in the countries that were their unwilling hosts are sorry to see the last Russian soldiers head_home . Under their protection a ruling elite was able to commit terrible crimes , just as their masters in the Soviet_Union had . Memories of that long , repressive and brutal period should never be allowed to fade . At the same time the courage , suffering and endurance of those ordinary citizens of the Soviet_Union -- soldiers and civilians -- who were among the chief victims and ultimately in the forefront of the victors over Nazism deserve also to be remembered and honored . Germany , nearly half a century after Nazism was crushed , is a proud and solid democracy and one of the world ' s strongest economies . Russia , less than three years after the dissolution of the Soviet_Union , struggles to achieve stability , create democratic institutions and establish an effective market_economy . None of this could have been predicted when victorious Soviet troops raised their flag over Berlin in 1945 . Nor can the political future be predicted today , as the departure of the last Russian forces from Europe brings an era to a close .</TEXT>
