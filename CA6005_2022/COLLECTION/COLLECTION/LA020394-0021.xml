   <HEADLINE> SPECIAL SCREENINGS : UCLA TO PRESENT ' NEW ITALIAN CINEMA ' SERIES ; ' THE BLONDE ' AND ' MANILA PALOMA BLANCA ' ARE AMONG THE OFFERINGS AT THE MELNITZ THEATER BEGINNING TODAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Among the films screening today through Sunday in the UCLA Film Archives ' &quot; New Italian Cinema &quot; at the university ' s Melnitz Theater are the very different but equally impressive &quot; The Blonde &quot; ( &quot; La Bionda &quot; ) and &quot; Manila Paloma Blanca , &quot; which play Saturday at 7:30 p.m. Two years ago , actor Sergio Rubini made his directorial debut with &quot; The Station , &quot; a sly charmer about an unprepossessing young stationmaster in a small_town in Southern Italy who gives shelter to a beautiful but distraught young_woman . Now he ' s back with &quot; The Blonde , &quot; once again casting himself as a wistful type , a student at a Milanese watch repair school whose life is turned upside down when a blond beauty ( Nastassja Kinski , as elegant and poised as Catherine Deneuve ) runs in front of his car and is knocked_down , leaving her an amnesiac . He ' s soon captivated by her , but who is she anyway ? What if she is to regain her memory ? &quot; Manila Paloma Blanca , &quot; a nonsense title , is a one-of-a-kind movie in which actor Carlo Colnaghi collaborated with director Daniel Segre in depicting a once-renowned stage actor attempting to pull his life together after a decade in and out of mental_institutions . The zinger here is that the film is loosely based on Colnaghi ' s own experiences . When we meet Colnaghi ' s alter_ego , Carlo Carbone , he ' s relying_on medications to hold himself together -- more or less . He ' s intent_on writing a theater piece for himself and making a comeback on the stage . He ' s a tall , rangy man of manic intensity , mercurial temperament and a strong-featured face like Boris Karloff ' s -- in an instant his expression can change from a benign cragginess to outright menace charged with pain and torment . He dares to hope for love and rejuvenation when he captures the imagination of an attractive , wealthy woman ( Alessandra Comerio ) . One is left wondering whether Colnaghi himself could ever regain the stability to sustain a return to the stage . Meanwhile , this film -- in which Colnaghi / Carbone comments on himself in brief asides shot in black-and-white -- allows him to command the screen unforgettably . While the line between the role and the actor blurs , Colnaghi makes_it clear that we are in the presence of great , volcanic talent . For a full schedule : ( 310 ) 206-FILM . * ' Mexican Cinema ' : On Saturday at the Chaplin Theater at Raleigh Studio , 5300 Melrose Ave. , the American Cinematheque will present &quot; Hecho en Mexico : Contemporary Mexican Cinema. &quot; The all-day showcase of five films begins at 11 a.m. with Guita Schyfter ' s warm , intimate , ironically titled &quot; Bride to Be , &quot; a highly evocative , richly detailed story of two Jewish girls growing_up in the 1950s and ' 60s -- and , in the process , developing a resistance to traditional expectations . The film is believed to be the first to deal with Mexico ' s long-established Jewish community and its special challenges in co-existing with the heavily Catholic majority . Gabriel Retes ' &quot; El Bulto &quot; ( 1:45 p.m. ) is an engaging and persuasive feat of the imagination in which Retes stars himself as an activist bludgeoned into a coma during a demonstration who awakens 20 years later to find that his radical views ( combined amusingly with an old-fashioned machismo ) clash with his family ' s comfortable bourgeois existence and values . Alfonso Cuaron ' s &quot; Love in the Time of Hysteria &quot; ( 4:30 p.m. ) is a wonderfully risque sex farce in which we meet a handsome young Mexico_City advertising copy writer ( Daniel Gimenez Cacho ) , an incorrigible Don Juan whose doctor routinely prescribes an HIV test with a physical exam . Suspense quickly generates as Cuaron deftly places a classic screwball comedy in a contemporary context with deadly serious implications . Dana Rotberg ' s &quot; Angel of Fire &quot; ( 7:45 p.m. ) , a lurid allegory of innocence and corruption , tells of the spiritual odyssey of a pretty teen-age performer ( Evangelina Sosa ) in a gloriously rag-tag circus . Pregnant by her own father , a dying clown , she is defiantly proud_of her condition , which gets her thrown_out of the circus and into the arms of a religious fanatic . Rotberg ' s tone is so relentlessly deadpan , and everything that happens is so ultra-dramatic and bizarre that the film becomes darkly humorous , intentionally or otherwise . Closing the series is Guillermo del Toro ' s horror picture &quot; Cronos , &quot; which was unavailable for preview . All films will be accompanied by discussions with their makers . Information : ( 213 ) 466-FILM .</TEXT>
