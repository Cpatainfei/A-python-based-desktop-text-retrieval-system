   <HEADLINE> SERBS AND CROATS AGREE TO LOW-LEVEL DIPLOMATIC LINKS ; BALKANS : PACTS ARE SEEN AS A WAY OF PRESSURING BOSNIA ' S MUSLIMS TO ACCEPT PARTITIONING . THEY COME AS PEACE TALKS FAIL AGAIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Serbs and Croats agreed on Wednesday to establish low-level diplomatic relations as another round of peace talks among Bosnia-Herzegovina ' s three warring parties ended without a settlement . Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic blamed Bosnia ' s Muslims for &quot; blocking peace &quot; and praised the accord with Zagreb as &quot; significant progress. &quot; Under the modest agreement , signed by the foreign_ministers of Yugoslavia and Croatia , the two countries will set_up representative offices in their respective capitals by Feb . 15 . Their Bosnian proxies signed similar declarations . Croatian President Franjo Tudjman proclaimed the pacts , which cap months of improving personal_relations between him and Milosevic , &quot; a major step toward the normalization of relations between Croatia and Serbia. &quot; The two countries severed ties after their six-month war that began in 1991 . Many view the accords , which do not extend_to full diplomatic recognition , as an attempt to force Bosnia ' s Muslim leaders into accepting a three-way partition of their war-torn republic . &quot; The Serbs may now pound Sarajevo ( Bosnia ' s capital ) with artillery , trying to increase the pressure , &quot; a Western diplomat said . Milosevic is anxious to get his Muslim foes to sign a peace agreement in_order to win the easing of international sanctions that have strangled Serbia ' s economy . The United Nations imposed the sanctions on Yugoslavia in 1992 for Belgrade ' s role in the violent rending of Bosnia . Bosnia ' s ambassador to the United Nations , Muhamed Sacirbey , echoed the concern over the agreement , saying : &quot; We hope this ( agreement ) does not signal a further alliance of war against our country. &quot; The Croatians should decide , he added , &quot; whether they are a victim in this war or whether they are opportunistic aggressors. &quot; In Sarajevo on Wednesday , an American_plane bringing food and medicine to the besieged capital was hit by gunfire -- the second relief plane struck in two days , causing the United Nations to suspend aid flights to the city . There were no injuries , and the plane landed safely in Sarajevo . International mediator Lord Owen told reporters in Geneva that peace talks remained deadlocked on Muslim demands for the return of a string of towns throughout Bosnia . Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic has refused to accept the republic ' s division along ethnic lines drawn during 22 months of war . He seeks to recover territory in eastern and western Bosnia that , once mostly Muslim , has been seized by Serbian forces . He has rejected proposed maps that would give his government more_than a third of Bosnian territory but would leave it with a virtually landlocked , geographically disjointed state . Representatives of the warring communities have agreed to meet again on Feb . 10 , Owen said , but will probably resume full-scale fighting &quot; with no real prospects of coming_together in a constructive frame of getting a peace agreement. &quot;</TEXT>
