   <HEADLINE> COVER STORY ; THE CURE FOR MALL WITHDRAWAL AND BOUTIQUE ENVY IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER . THE VALLEY IS HOME TO A NUMBER OF . . . ; GREAT FINDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Since the walls of several local malls came tumbling down in January , some Valleyites have been suffering from shopping envy . You know what that is : the conviction that there are people out there having more fun than you are because they can walk to the shabby chic boutiques of Santa Monica ' s Montana Avenue or shop to satiety in South Coast Plaza . But not to worry . Although Northridge Fashion Center and other retail venues are still recovering from the quake , the San Fernando Valley remains home to a host of first-rate shops . Here are eight of the best , from a choice gift_shop in Studio City to a store in Burbank that gives new meaning to the term weird science . Some vast , some so tiny they could use traffic_control , each offers something more for your money than the goods you walk_out with . They are listed geographically , from west to east . Best to call_for hours , especially during the holidays . And , Westsiders , eat your hearts out . Pages Bookstore What most distinguishes this Tarzana children ' s bookstore from so many others is its staff . As owner Darlene Daniel explains ( in a voice so soft she makes Mister Rogers sound like a fishmonger ) , Pages is staffed by former teachers and others with child-development backgrounds . Each is trained in-house to direct customers , large and small , to those books most likely to inform them , thrill them , comfort them -- in short , do all_the things that only books can do . How different is Pages from some discount_stores ? &quot; When we go_to recommend a book , many times we ' ve read it , &quot; says manager Marge Kassorla , who retired from teaching English at Millikin Middle_School and Grant High_School and often recognizes the names of former students on the checks they write to the shop . Pages stocks more_than 18 # 000 titles , everything from picture_books to young adult titles , including fantasy and books dealing with sex and other issues . Daniel thinks it ' s vital to provide teen-agers with books that will keep them reading for pleasure . &quot; that ' s a stage where it ' s very easy to lose them from reading , &quot; she says grimly . Pages publishes a quarterly newsletter that recommends new titles and announces its story hours , signings by authors and illustrators , concerts and other activities . The staff can help you choose a year ' s worth of books for a favorite young_person , then wrap one up and send it off each month . And the store collects &quot; wish lists &quot; from local teachers and librarians so you can donate a book to the school on your child ' s birthday or some_other occasion . As Kassorla says , &quot; It ' s a nice alternative to cupcakes. &quot; Pages Books for Children and Young Adults , 18399 Ventura Blvd. , Tarzana , ( 818 ) 342-6657 . Gus ' Smoke Shop This Sherman Oaks shop is a Valley institution . According to owner Jim Hurwitz , it has been in the same spot since 1927 , making_it the oldest business still on Ventura Boulevard . Gus ' is definitely a guy thing , filled with men staring like jack-lighted deer at sweet-scented boxes of Macanudos and other high-end cigars . Hurwitz himself was a customer for 10 years before he bought the shop in 1985 . Ever since , he has been riding the wave of the cigar ' s remarkable resurgence . Gus ' doesn ' t stock coffees or other stuff that will distract from a good smoke , which can cost $ 10 . &quot; Our philosophy is to smoke better , but fewer , &quot; Hurwitz counsels . Cohibas and other contraband Cuban cigars still have the most panache among aficionados , although Hurwitz warns that many smuggled into the United States are inferior knockoffs . Right now , premium cigars from the Dominican_Republic are selling so well he can ' t keep_up with demand . Regulars ( who include actors Joe Montegna and Joe Pesci ) can season their cigars in lockers in Gus ' climate-controlled humidor . And on Oct . 1 , the shop opened a private club next door , called the Back_Room , where members can watch sports , play cards and , above all , &quot; smoke in peace. &quot; Annual membership : $ 500 . Gus ' Smoke Shop , 13420 Ventura Blvd. , Sherman Oaks , ( 818 ) 789-1401 . Star Restaurant Equipment and Supply For a serious foodie , a restaurant supply store is a field of dreams . These are places where it is possible to imagine the pleasure of constructing a cassoulet without ever having to determine the precise nature of potted goose or even whether you can make_it in an average lifetime . Instead you cruise the aisles , visions of rapid-fire mincing , precision dicing and doing unspeakable things with pastry bags dancing in your head . Cooks feel about restaurant supply stores the way writers feel about stationers . But for the non-pro , the first hurdle may be getting_through the door . Some of these places sell only to the trade . &quot; Out ! Out ! &quot; one of those exclusive proprietors yelled at an acquaintance when he confessed he had no restaurant affiliation and only made timbales on Sunday . The people at Star in Van Nuys won ' t scream at you even if you ' ve never worn a toque . Recently , for instance , Mickey Crocker emerged from the store bearing a brown plastic cocktail tray with a non-skid cork surface . An actress , Crocker remembered this kind of tray from her cocktail-waitressing days and had bought one for $ 12.55 to use when she serves hot_chocolate while playing Mrs . Claus in a children ' s musical called &quot; Santa Claus Conquers the Martians &quot; in La Mirada . As manager Les Birken explains , Star has been in the Valley for more_than 30 years . The store stocks or can order everything a restaurant or home cook needs , from professional stoves to sink-size salad_bowls . Star has plastic cafeteria_trays , $ 500 hot dog rotisseries , industrial-strength aprons , those great stainless-steel-and-glass sugar dispensers that coffee_shops favor and serious knives . Currently , professional muffin tins are selling like crazy . Birken hasn ' t the foggiest idea why . Star Restaurant Equipment and Supply , 6178 Sepulveda Blvd. , Van Nuys , ( 818 ) 782-4460 . Emerald Forest On a recent trip to Emerald Forest , a tiny gift_shop in Studio City ' s Coldwater Curve , a customer mentioned that she had come_into the store because there was nothing like it where she lives -- in San Francisco . Owner Michelle Rack looks_for the unusual , the charming , the finely crafted . This is high-end Valley shopping . Rack ' s regulars don ' t grow pale at the thought of paying $ 17 for a cake of handmade soap that smells like Christmas and would make a darling hostess gift . Besides cachepots , picture_frames , bath things , pretty baskets and other gifts , Rack has lots of jewelry . She is especially proud_of a line she and jeweler friend Julia designed and produce themselves , called the Gingerbread Family ( they ' ve trademarked the name ) . Custom-made of silver or gold , these are little gingerbread_men and women , boys and girls , even pets , personalized with the names of family members and fashioned into bracelets , pins and other pieces . Items start at $ 42 , and Rack says she gets orders from as far away as Japan , from people who have admired a piece and asked where they could get one . A year ago , Emerald Forest opened an annex a_few stores up devoted to personalized stationery , custom invitations , pens , journals and other mostly paper objects . Emerald Forest , 12638 Ventura Blvd. , Studio City , ( 818 ) 509-8529 . The stationer is at 12660 Ventura Blvd. , ( 818 ) 509-0798 . The Harmonica Store Many a shop owner will claim their establishment is unique . The Harmonica Store really is . According to Hohner , the German manufacturer that sets the standard for the industry , this North Hollywood shop is the only one in the United States devoted entirely to promoting and selling harmonicas . Owners Marv Wolfe and Mickey Milgrim-Wolfe opened their doors in May , 1993 . As Marv explains , he noticed that harmonicas got short_shrift in ordinary music stores . But Marv , who turns 86 on Dec . 30 , remembered the great harmonicists of his salad days , people like the irrepressible Borrah Minevitch , and thought , &quot; that ' s a great little instrument . Why are they treating it like a stepchild ? &quot; Marv became a man with a mission , especially after he verified at the library that the world wasn ' t glutted with harmonica stores . A violinist and seasoned businesswoman , Mickey agreed to do the buying and decorating , choosing &quot; black-and-white tile to look_like a piano. &quot; The shop carries toy harmonicas for kids and a $ 10 Hohner for anyone who dreams of unleashing the Borrah Minevitch within . The store also offers classes . But this is , above all , a serious specialty shop . Staffer Stephen Close , who plays under the name Grievin ' Stephen , is there to answer the questions of musicians looking_for instruments , amps , microphones and those neck harness things that Dylan wears so he can play the harmonica and the guitar at_the_same_time . Nearby music studios help fuel the business . Not long ago , says Close , country singer Clint Black , who was recording around the corner at Lighthouse , whizzed by on his skateboard , saw the sign , then came_in and ordered 20 harmonicas . The Harmonica Store , 5151 Whitsett Ave. , North Hollywood , ( 818 ) 787-9457 . Arte de Mexico Arte de Mexico may be the most remarkable thing in North Hollywood . Its 75 # 000-square-foot complex of warehouses is packed with handcrafted furniture , lighting and tchotchkes , from Mexico , yes , but also from Morocco , Nepal , Pakistan , the Philippines and South_Africa . This is the place to come for your armoire hand-painted with palms and parrots , your table made from a wrought-iron grill , your decorative ostrich eggs . Vice_President David Stoffers , son of founder G . J . Stoffers , helps move the product by creating theatrical vignettes . As a result , the store has the feel of an enormous sound stage where a_thousand movies are being shot at once . &quot; It ' s a visual venue , &quot; says Stoffers . &quot; It ' s a Disneyland for designers. &quot; Custom work is Arte de Mexico ' s specialty . Someone ( let ' s call him a rock_star ) spots a wooden door from an ancient temple , and for $ 12 # 000 Arte will turn it into the headboard of an enormous bed with recessed lighting . The store ' s line of handcrafted antler furniture is really hot right now , says Stoffers , who notes that all those moose and deer horns were naturally shed , then collected by Boy_Scouts and other gatherers . No wonder people bring out-of-town friends and relatives here to gawk . &quot; It ' s an adult toy store , &quot; Stoffers says . &quot; Anyone who ' s looking_for a full-sized horse -- in wood -- we have it. &quot; Arte de Mexico , 5356 Riverton Ave. , North Hollywood , ( 818 ) 769-5090 . Geographia Since this Burbank shop opened in 1986 , it has become a magnet for Valleyites who think travel is what God created as penance for creating work . Going_to Kuala Lumpur ? Geographia has a wide choice of books by visitors who have gone before , plus reference and coffee-table books and guidebooks , including the hip Lonely Planet series and the stylishly written Cadogan guides . Best of all , you can get maps here as well and begin learning the new turf long before there ' s any real chance you ' ll get lost on it . &quot; We ' re real serious about maps , &quot; says owner Brian Draper , who majored in geography at Cal State Northridge . Geographia stocks many of the accessories that make travel more comfortable , including security items for scaring_off hotel intruders and for stashing money in your underwear . It has globes , atlases , language tapes . Interested in cybertravel ? You can get software , such_as Thomas Brothers guides_on CD-ROM . Draper also stocks GPS ( for Global Positioning System ) receivers . These allow you to determine exactly where you are anywhere on earth by reading signals from orbiting satellites . Industry people use the devices to scout locations and pinpoint where the sun will be before the cameras start rolling . &quot; I ' ve also sold them to people interested in exploring in the desert and up in the mountains , &quot; says Draper . &quot; They ' re a lot more sophisticated than a compass. &quot; Pricier , too , starting at about $ 800 . Geographia Map &amp; Travel Bookstore , 4000 Riverside Drive , Burbank , ( 818 ) 848-1414 . Tri-Ess Sciences You have to see this place to truly understand it . Located in an industrial area of Burbank , Tri-Ess is really several businesses in one . It is a special-effects business that supplies smoke , some of it developed by founder Ira Katz , and other products , including makeup materials , to the entertainment_industry . that ' s why Tri-Ess recently sent a large shipment of violet smoke to a film company in Sydney , Australia , that is shooting a Mighty Morphin Power Rangers movie . ( You read it here first. ) The company also fabricates and rents props . But the reason it is_on our list is because of its showroom , open_to the public . Think_of Tri-Ess as Wal-Mart for Dr. Frankenstein . Need a $ 400 life-size plastic skeleton ? You can get one here , as did the man who put one under the Christmas_tree for his artist wife . ( Personal-injury attorneys also shop here for plastic body_parts that will make juries sit_up and take notice. ) Need half a cup of hydrochloric_acid or a single test_tube or a dead frog suitable for dissecting ? Tri-Ess is the place . For decades , explains Katz ' s daughter , Kim Greenfield , the store has been catering to schoolchildren . &quot; We have something we call science-project season when the little darlings come_in with not a clue as what to do. &quot; Tri-Ess offers advice and an extensive selection of science books and kits . And Tri-Ess will be happy to sell you the electrical switch or preserved sheep ' s eye that could set your child off on a trajectory to the Nobel Prize . Tri-Ess Sciences , 1020 W . Chestnut St. , Burbank , ( 818 ) 848-7838 .</TEXT>
