   <HEADLINE> COLLEGE VOLLEYBALL PREVIEW ; MATADORS WILL BEGIN A NEW ERA UNDER LU ; NORTHRIDGE : FIRST-YEAR CSUN WOMEN ' S COACH STRESSES DEFENSE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Lian Kang Lu , recognized as one of the world ' s foremost volleyball coaches , will begin a new chapter in his career today when the Cal State Northridge women ' s team plays Fresno State in the opening match of the Anteater Invitational at UC Irvine . Lu was an assistant for the UC Santa Barbara women ' s team from 1984-93 after coaching the Mexican national team in 1982-83 and the Beijing women ' s professional team from 1968-81 , but this is his first stint as a college head coach . Although Lu says being a head coach at the NCAA Division I level &quot; is no big deal &quot; because of his experience , his hiring at Northridge last December was considered a major coup for a program that had been rocked by off-the-court controversy the previous year . The Matadors finished 12-17 last season under John Price , who took_over the program on a one-year interim basis after the four finalists to replace previous coach Walt Ker declined the job . Ker posted a 401-144 record during his 14 seasons at Northridge and guided the Matadors to their first berth in the Division I playoffs in 1992 , yet he resigned abruptly in January of 1993 , citing &quot; family reasons &quot; for his decision . Later it was learned that Ker ' s resignation came_after two Northridge players filed a written complaint accusing him of sexual_harassment . Other former players also alleged that Ker had consensual sexual_relations with players in the early 1980s . Price , who guided the Matador men ' s team to the 1993 NCAA final , tried to get the Northridge women to play a fast-paced attacking game , but they struggled in that role . Lu , 60 , values a strong attack , but says the heart and soul of a quality women ' s team is its defense . &quot; Playing defense gives you a good_will , a good fighting spirit , &quot; he said . &quot; It makes you tough . . . . It ' s very important in women ' s volleyball because there are so many rallies. &quot; Ana Kristich , one of the Matadors ' four returning starters , says it ' s taken time to adapt to Lu ' s system , but she and her teammates are learning . &quot; It ' s definitely very different because we ' re used to a more attacking kind of style , &quot; Kristich said . &quot; We ' re going to have to get used to it . We ' re getting better all_the time , but I think it ' s going_to take us a month or so before we really start to play like we ' re capable of. &quot; Kristich , a 6-foot-1 middle blocker , is one of five seniors in the starting lineup . The others are left-side hitters Aimee Stone ( 5-10 ) and Missy Clements ( 5-11 ) , right-side hitter Heather Anderson ( 6-2 ) , and setter Kathleen Shannon ( 5-8 ) , a transfer from Illinois . Stone led the team in kills ( 458 ) and digs ( 352 ) last season . Clements ranked second with 405 kills , and Kristich had a team-high 136 total blocks . Shannon had 687 assists for Illinois ( 18-13 ) last season and led the Fighting Illini to the second round of the NCAA playoffs after moving_into the starting lineup following an 0-5 start . She transferred to Northridge in the spring to be close to fiance J.J. O ' Laughlin , starting quarterback on the Matador football_team . Last season , freshman Gretchen Gulbranson had 947 assists as the setter for the Matadors . Gulbranson ' s transfer to Moorpark College has left Northridge with a lack of depth at the position . Randi Winn , a starter at Utah State last year , was expected to back_up Shannon , but Lu said she left the team for personal reasons two weeks ago . That leaves sophomore Erin Balderama as the reserve setter . The 5-7 defensive specialist is also expected to see extensive action as a back-row substitute for Stephanie Pfau , the Matadors ' other starting middle blocker . Pfau , a 6-foot freshman , was an All-Southern Section Division III selection for South Torrance High last season . &quot; Stephanie has shown good consistency in practice , &quot; Lu said . &quot; She just lacks ( college ) experience. &quot; With only six of its 25 regular-season matches at_home this year , Northridge must win consistently on_the_road to have a successful campaign . But Kristich doesn ' t think that will be a problem . She said a return engagement in the Division I playoffs is conceivable . &quot; It hasn ' t really been talked_about that much , but I think everyone ' s thinking that , &quot; she said . &quot; I think it ' s a definite possibility. &quot;</TEXT>
