   <HEADLINE> 250 # 000 TIPSTERS DELUGE HOT_LINE IN SIMPSON CASE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Encouraged by the promise of a huge reward or the chance to contribute to a historic investigation , 250 # 000 callers have flooded a newly created defense hot_line with tips about the O.J. Simpson murder case , while similarly besieged police have designated a full-time &quot; clue chaser &quot; to run_down the leads coming_to them . &quot; It ' s beyond belief , &quot; Simpson attorney Robert L . Shapiro said Wednesday of the hot-line deluge . Shapiro , who disclosed the number of calls_in an interview with The Times , said they have become so overwhelming that the operators have had to install a special backup recording_system to keep_up with the crush . Tipsters have included private_investigators with clues based largely on news_reports , amateur detectives with theories implicating other possible suspects , and people claiming to have witnessed the events involving the grisly slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman . Although some of the tips are seemingly credible , many appear to be the products of overactive imaginations . One Maryland woman has called repeatedly to tell of dreams in which she sees another killer . To her frustration , Simpson ' s camp has not gotten_back to her . &quot; We ' re hearing from every psycho and every crazy person , &quot; said Bill Pavelic , an investigative consultant working with the Simpson team . &quot; But if I get one call_in a_hundred that ' s a good lead , it ' s worth it. &quot; Rising to that thin promise , investigators on both sides of the case are painstakingly chasing down each lead , reluctant to pass_up any information that could prove important . The onslaught of tips has convinced some Police_Department officials that Simpson ' s camp may be fueling the fires in part to occupy detectives who might otherwise be building a case against Simpson . Any tip that is not checked_out could be used against the prosecution at trial . Simpson ' s camp already has made clear its intention to attack the thoroughness and competence of the investigation into their high-profile client . &quot; There ' s people that are giving us theories , there ' s psychics , that kind of thing , &quot; said Detective Dennis Payne of the LAPD ' s Robbery-Homicide Division . &quot; And then there ' s people who have information . We ' re checking it all out. &quot; Some officers say they ' re braced for Simpson ' s team to show_up someday with a basketful of leads , wondering whether all_of them have been thoroughly investigated . &quot; They ' re absolutely right to be concerned , &quot; said Pavelic , a retired LAPD detective now at_odds with his former colleagues . &quot; We ' re getting calls from people who are saying they ' re being kissed off by the Police_Department . If they don ' t interview these people , they ' ve got a problem . We ' re going to ask : ' Why not ? ' &quot; With the stakes so high for both sides , police_detectives and Simpson investigators are simultaneously pounding the pavement . In fact , Simpson ' s crew and LAPD detectives have occasionally run_into one another at the crime scene and other locations . According to sources in both camps , the most recent wave of tips has featured several from eager private_investigators trying to uncover clues_in the case . Paul Katz of Los Angeles-based Katz Investigations hooked_up_with a pair of Colorado private_eyes last week to take a crack at the case . They scoured the area near Nicole Simpson ' s condominium and found red spots resembling blood in an alley close to the crime scene . They photographed the spots , as well as some intriguing tire tracks , and forwarded the pictures to police , who are investigating . Katz said he has rejected tabloid offers of money for the story and added that neither he nor his colleagues are interested in the reward . They are just trying to solve a mystery that has preoccupied much of the country , he said , and hope to get credit for their efforts . &quot; This is something that was missed by O.J. ' s team and by the LAPD , &quot; said Robert S . Hatch Jr. , one of the Colorado investigators who flew to Los Angeles at the behest of some Colorado businessmen interested in the Simpson case . &quot; It ' s potentially important evidence , and we found it. &quot; Hatch said he and his colleagues also turned_up a witness who purportedly saw Nicole Simpson arguing with someone -- he ' s not sure who -- on the morning of the killings . Having uncovered those tidbits , Hatch and Salvador C . Torres , another Colorado investigator , headed_home this week , leaving Katz to continue hunting for clues . &quot; We didn ' t really expect to come_up with too_much , &quot; Hatch said . &quot; When we turned_up what we turned_up , we were amazed. &quot; They are not alone . Private_investigators from throughout the region and some from beyond have descended upon the crime scene in recent days . They are quick to tout their finds . One investigator forwarded information to both sides that he says will shed new light on Nicole Simpson ' s character , while others have offered thoughts on the police and medical_examiners involved in the case . Scores of calls to the hot_line , meanwhile , come from people who say they have information about Simpson , his ex-wife or Goldman that could help the case one way or the other . Although most of the tips -- founded and unfounded -- are about the principal players in the celebrated whodunit , many come from people with a dizzying array of thoughts on other issues . One Santa Barbara woman hypothesized that a large dog might have carried a bloody glove to Simpson ' s home . She called police and Simpson ' s hot_line Wednesday , urging both sides to demand a test of the glove to determine whether it had saliva that could be matched to a large_white Akita owned by Nicole Simpson . So far , neither side has complied . Then there ' s the self-professed burglar who says he was casing houses in Brentwood on the night of the killings , looking_for some quick jewelry and cash . He came_forward within days of Simpson ' s arrest and said he heard a woman scream and saw two white_men fleeing the crime scene about the time the killings took_place . The two men , according to the prowler , were carrying a bag or a pillowcase and fled Nicole Simpson ' s home by running_out the front of the condominium property , not out the back gate , as police and prosecutors have theorized that Simpson did . Although Simpson has offered $ 500 # 000 for information leading to the arrest of the &quot; real killer or killers , &quot; the prowler says he wants no part of the reward . &quot; I just want to straighten this out , &quot; he told The Times . The prowler , who asked that his name not be used , has been interviewed by Simpson ' s investigators , who said they find him credible . He also has spoken with detectives over the phone and is scheduled for a formal interview later this week . It won ' t be his first face-to-face encounter with the detectives . When he was being videotaped at the crime scene by Simpson investigator Pavelic , LAPD Detective Tom Lange happened by . According to Pavelic , Lange asked who the witness was , but Pavelic said he brushed him off . Police are reluctant to disclose their investigative efforts , but law_enforcement officials say both police and prosecutors have received a stream of calls and letters from across the nation and even other countries . The pace of tips slowed_down a bit after Simpson ' s preliminary hearing , officials said , but picked_up again after the Simpson camp opened its toll-free tip line . &quot; That seemed to make everyone out there feel_like they were Deputy Dan , &quot; said one law_enforcement source . &quot; Our phones started ringing and the letters started arriving. &quot; * REVERSING FIELD : O.J. Simpson ' s lawyers told a judge their experts will not participate in DNA testing of crime scene blood samples . B1</TEXT>
