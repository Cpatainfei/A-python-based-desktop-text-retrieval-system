   <HEADLINE> AMERICA ' S STAKE IN THE AWESOME STRUGGLE OVER RUSSIA ' S FUTURE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> U.S.-Russia relations , whose course has seldom run smooth in this century , may be heading for another rough patch . If so it will be familiar territory . Russians and Americans have never made war on each other , but more_than once they have come uncomfortably close . After the Bolsheviks seized control of the Russian_Revolution in 1917 , the United States militarily intervened along with other World_War I allies in an effort aimed mainly at keeping Russia from making a separate peace with Germany . Not until 1933 did Washington extend diplomatic recognition to Moscow . But mistrust remained , even during the period of the Grand Alliance that defeated Nazi Germany . The hegemony extended by the Soviet_Union over Eastern Europe after that conflict , the Korean_War , the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 were among the low points of a cold_war whose sudden end was proclaimed just a_few years ago . With that proclamation came soaring hopes for a new era of amity and cooperation . Those hopes have faded . The Russia of today is not the Russia of even a_few months ago . Boris N . Yeltsin remains president and Viktor S . Chernomyrdin is still prime_minister . But their government seems to have only an uncertain grip on the levers of power and a far-from-sure sense of what its strategy should be in the ongoing struggle to determine Russia ' s future . Russia ' s long history of authoritarianism has always cast doubts over its prospects for moving from despotism to democracy , from a command economy to a free economy . Deepening uncertainties about those prospects have prompted a quiet and necessary reappraisal of U.S. policy toward Moscow . Except for the rare surfacing , such_as the bizarre flap in which he initially snubbed the visiting former U.S. President Richard Nixon , Yeltsin , perhaps for health reasons , has withdrawn from much of the daily business of governing . That detachment correlates with the startling showing made in last December ' s parliamentary elections by an anti-reform bloc dominated by extremists of the right and left . Less than two months ago Yeltsin assured President Clinton that he would stay the course on reform . That promise stands suspended . Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin have read the election results , which were widely interpreted as resentment over the unavoidable pains brought by economic change and which measured the success of the neo-fascist demagogue Vladimir V . Zhirinosvky . Their response has been to boot_out of government the boldest advocates of free-market reforms , while re-empowering those whose economic ideas have not progressed beyond the stagnant Brezhnev years . Russia ' s foreign_policy , meanwhile , shows every sign of being propelled by a rising wave of nationalism and nostalgia for the recent imperial past . Moscow ' s decision -- with its historical echo of pan-Slavism -- to involve itself on behalf of Serbian interests in Bosnia was widely hailed as serving notice on the West that Russia had re-emerged as a major regional player . The region of most immediate concern to Moscow is the &quot; near abroad , &quot; the states of the former Soviet_Union where Yeltsin and others now talk openly about Russia ' s &quot; right &quot; to intervene . The hard policy choices all this presents for the United States are apparent . Russia , as it has since the time of Peter the Great , is again arguing with itself over the direction of its political_orientation . There is a realistic chance that out of this fierce debate could come policies and actions that will demolish the dreams that communism ' s collapse encouraged . This debate could , alternatively , rage inconclusively for some time . Thus the United States must remain steady and sure about where its own permanent interests lie , and gear its policies accordingly . One of those interests is to encourage progress toward a free-market economy , however hard a slog that may be . The picture is not wholly bleak . Most U.S. aid to Russia supports privatization and entrepreneurship , and progress in these areas is impressive . More_than 75 % of Russia ' s retail_stores and small businesses are now in private hands . More_than 25 % of the labor_force already works in the private sector . Expansion of the market_economy should be nourished . The United States should also continue to enlist Russian cooperation in vital areas , for example , in nuclear non-proliferation . At the same time the Clinton_Administration must support the independence and territorial integrity of the former republics of the Soviet_Union . That doesn ' t mean extending NATO defense guarantees to these states , many of them embroiled in their own internal power struggles . It does mean making clear that Moscow will pay a high political price if it uses force to reassert Russian control in its former empire . The Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917 inaugurated a tumultuous era in Russian and world history . The struggle over Russia ' s future that has ensued in the wake of communism ' s collapse could be tumultuous as well . U.S. policy toward Russia must be rooted in realism , free from romantic illusions as well as from exaggerated fears . Europe ' s and America ' s interests would of course be_best served if democratic reformers triumph . But outside powers can influence that outcome at best only marginally . Ultimately , as in 1917 , the forces that will decide and define Russia ' s fate lie almost wholly within Russia itself .</TEXT>
