   <HEADLINE> SURPRISE PICK : ' PULP FICTION ' ; CANNES REPORT : QUENTIN TARANTINO ' S FILM IS THE THIRD MOVIE ABOUT THE UNDERBELLY OF AMERICAN LIFE TO WIN THE PALME D ' OR IN THE LAST SIX YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For the third time in the last six years , the Cannes Film Festival awarded its Palme d ' Or to an American lowlife serenade , Quentin Tarantino ' s showy salute to the cool and the crazy , &quot; Pulp Fiction. &quot; Probably the most talked_about film at the festival , though not necessarily the most admired , &quot; Pulp Fiction &quot; follows in the footsteps of the 1990 Palme to David Lynch ' s &quot; Wild at Heart &quot; and the 1991 Palme to the Coen brothers ' &quot; Barton Fink. &quot; Still , its selection surprised many in the Palais du Festival audience , including one woman who was so upset she began screaming at the writer-director as he tried to begin his speech . Tarantino , whose first film , &quot; Reservoir Dogs , &quot; was a similarly audacious look_at gangsters both violent and loquacious , said he too was surprised . &quot; I never expect to win anything when a jury has to decide , &quot; he said , &quot; because I don ' t make the kinds of movies that bring people together . I make the kinds of movies that split people apart. &quot; Tarantino then thanked his extensive cast , which includes John Travolta in a charming performance that can ' t help but put some oomph into his career , saying , &quot; when they got finished , they turned a pretty good script into an obsolete document. &quot; * Two films by celebrated directors shared the Grand Prix du Jury , Cannes ' runner-up award . They were Zhang Yimou ' s &quot; To Live &quot; from China and Nikita Mikhalkov ' s &quot; Burnt by the Sun &quot; from Russia , an extraordinarily evocative and humanistic film about the Soviet_Union on the eve of Stalin ' s purges that stars both the director and his charming 6-year-old daughter . Since &quot; To Live , &quot; an intimate epic about 20th-Century Chinese history , has not found favor with that country ' s authorities , Zhang Yimou was not allowed to attend the festival . His award was accepted by his star , Gong Li , who minutes before had shed a rare public tear when her co-star , Ge You , thanked her after winning the prize for best actor . Ge You ' s award was yet another festival surprise ; the actor himself did a double_take when his name was announced . He beat_out several more prominent actors , including Albert Finney in &quot; The Browning Version &quot; and Jean-Louis Trintignant in Krysztof Kieslowski ' s &quot; Three Colors : Red. &quot; In fact , the Kieslowski film , probably the best liked across the board at the entire festival , ended_up with no prizes at all . Also unexpectedly getting two prizes was the operatic French historical epic &quot; Queen Margot , &quot; which even French critics have not been high on . It won a jury prize , &quot; for originality , &quot; as well as the best actress award , not for star Isabelle Adjani , but rather for veteran Italian actress Virna Lisi , who played her monstrous mother , Catherine de Medici . Lisi , in tears from beginning to end , thanked the historical Catherine , &quot; an incredible woman to have given me this character to play. &quot; * One of the other French entrants , Michel Blanc ' s engaging &quot; Gross Fatigue , &quot; a Gallic &quot; The Player &quot; about a double who makes a movie_star ' s life miserable , also took two awards , one for screenplay ( given for the first time in 10 years ) and one for technical merit . And the coveted Camera d ' Or for the best film in the entire festival also went_to a French production , &quot; Petit Arrangements Avec Les Morts , &quot; directed by Pascale Ferran . Since this film showed in the subtitle-less Cinemas En France section , it got_away from most American writers . Aside from &quot; Pulp Fiction , &quot; the American film that did best at Cannes was Kevin Smith ' s engaging &quot; Clerks , &quot; the hit of the Sundance Film Festival . It won both the Prix de la Jeunesse , awarded , as the name indicates , by a jury of young people , and the same Critics Week prize that in previous years went_to &quot; Cronos &quot; and &quot; Man Bites Dog. &quot; Almost lost in all this Franco-American excitement was the best director prize , which went_to the Italian Nanni Moretti for his &quot; Caro Diario , &quot; a wry and idiosyncratic satire on life in Italy very much , it was universally agreed , in the manner of Woody Allen . A bit dumbfounded by his award , like almost everyone else in this most unexpected of Cannes ceremonies , Moretti simply shrugged and said , &quot; Thank you very much . I can ' t think_of anything else to say. &quot;</TEXT>
