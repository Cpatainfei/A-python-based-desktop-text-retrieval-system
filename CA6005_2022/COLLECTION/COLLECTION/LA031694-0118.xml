   <HEADLINE> MIKE PENNER : HERE ' S A SURE-FIRE SYSTEM TO PICK NCAA WINNER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ladies and gentlemen of the NCAA basketball office pool , you huddled masses yearning to break free and win a month ' s coffee money , a piece of advice : In order to determine who is about to win this year ' s tournament , you first must decide who can ' t . For instance : Arkansas can ' t win it because Arkansas ' center and point guard are_due to be implicated in the Whitewater scandal any day now . North Carolina can ' t win it because Michael Jordan is embarrassing baseball -- so Sports Illustrated has declared -- and the Tar Heels can ' t bring themselves to show their faces in public over that one . Michigan can ' t win it because some time in the next three weeks , the Wolverines will desperately need a timeout called and every player on the court will put his hands behind his back and say , &quot; Not me. &quot; Duke and Kentucky can ' t win it because the two schools will implode when their teams meet in the Southeast Regional semifinals . Purdue can ' t win it because no one-man team has reached the NCAA final since Larry Bird carried Indiana State there in 1979 , and Glenn Robinson is no Larry Bird . California can ' t win it because Jason Kidd and Lamond Murray will announce this weekend their intention to quit school and form their own NBA expansion team . UCLA can ' t win it because this is March , not December ; because the Bruins lost six of their last 13 games ; because the Bruins lost to Oregon ; because the Bruins could use about three more O ' Bannons ; because the Bruins could use someone who doesn ' t quiver at the thought of taking an 18-footer at the buzzer , and because the Bruins are celebrating the 30th anniversary of John Wooden ' s first NCAA championship with Jim Harrick on the bench . Missouri can ' t win it because in_order to reach the sixth round you have to win the first . Massachusetts can ' t win it because Coach John Calipari has run_out of gas answering the question , &quot; So , did you think John Chaney really wanted to kill you ? &quot; Indiana and Temple can ' t win it , though , with a little luck , Bob Knight and John Chaney could meet in the second round in what basketball writers are calling the First Alert Security Bowl . The loser gets eliminated , the winner gets one phone_call . Pennsylvania can ' t win it because it is an outstanding academic institution , beyond reproach , dedicated to developing scholars first and athletes second . It has no chance . College of Charleston can ' t win it because junior_colleges shouldn ' t be allowed into the NCAA tournament in the first place . New Mexico State can ' t win it because saying you ' re the best basketball_team in the Big West is the same thing as saying you ' re the best professional hockey_team in Southern California . Loyola ( Maryland ) can ' t win it , and neither can Loyola ( Chicago ) and Loyola Marymount . These franchise universities are just so tacky . Tennessee Chattanooga can ' t win it because being the best basketball_team in Tennessee is no big deal anymore . Tennessee State can ' t win it because the school is still on probation for alumna Oprah Winfrey ' s &quot; interview &quot; with Michael Jackson . Liberty can ' t win it because Danny Sheridan lists the odds at 10 trillion-to-one . Jerry Falwell wagers a buck and starts praying . Alabama Birmingham can ' t win it , but give Gene Bartow UCLA ' s talent now and you never know . Rider can ' t win it , because he plays with the Timberwolves now and the Timberwolves can ' t beat anybody . North Carolina A &amp; T can ' t win it , and neither can North Carolina MCI . Ohio can ' t win it , but if the Bobcats win their first-round game , we ' ll forgive them . The Bobcats ' first-round game is against Indiana . Western Kentucky , Central Florida , Southern Illinois , Texas Southern , Southwest Texas State and Southwestern Louisiana can ' t win it because if you need directions just to find the campus . . . Drexel can ' t win it because investment_bankers can ' t jump . Texas can ' t win it because it went 12-2 to finish first in the Southwest Conference . So ? Syracuse can ' t win it because if Jim Boeheim couldn ' t win it with Derrick Coleman , Rony Seikaly and Sherman Douglas , why should he now ? Navy can ' t win it . Navy doesn ' t have a Tailhook shot in hell . Wisconsin can ' t win it because it won the Rose Bowl . that ' s enough . Louisville can ' t win it because the 80s are over . Michigan State and Marquette can ' t win it because the 70s are over . Tulsa and Oklahoma State can ' t win it , but if one doesn ' t finish_off UCLA this weekend in Oklahoma_City , the other will . Boise State can ' t win it , though it is interesting to note that this is the Broncos ' fourth NCAA appearance since former Cal State Fullerton coach Bobby Dye arrived in Boise . Fullerton , meanwhile , hasn ' t qualified once since Dye left in 1980 . Wisconsin Green_Bay can ' t win it because Brett Favre might sign with Louisiana New Orleans . Pepperdine , Washington State and New Mexico can ' t win it because . . . let ' s get serious . Maryland and St . Louis can ' t win it , but whoever wins their first-round matchup on Thursday gets the Rams . Boston College can ' t win it , even though Bobby Bowden promised to do whatever he could , just his way of saying thanks . Nebraska can ' t win it because Tom Osborne has tickets . Cincinnati can ' t win it because Houston has better pitching . Illinois can ' t win it because of two words : Lou Henson . Arizona can ' t win it because of four words : East , Tennessee , Santa and Clara . Connecticut , Georgetown , Providence and Seton Hall can ' t win it because I ' m really getting sick_of the Big East , aren ' t you ? Alabama can ' t win it , though country_music fans swear by them . Virginia can ' t win it because , no , there is no Santa Claus . If there was , he ' d have left Virginia Coach Jeff Jones some jump shooters . The Cavaliers shot 38.7 % in conference this season , the lowest mark in the ACC since 1968 . Florida can ' t win it because Rush Limbaugh as spokesperson for Florida orange_juice constitutes a recruiting violation . Kansas can ' t win it because everyone says the Jayhawks ' talent is down this year . And it is -- down on its knees , bowing before Coach Roy Williams and chanting , &quot; We ' re not worthy , we ' re not worthy. &quot; Wake Forest can ' t win it because players will be demoralized after PC police demands name change from highly offensive &quot; Demon Deacons &quot; to more palatable &quot; Very Tall Sensitive Feeling Leaping Persons. &quot; Minnesota can ' t win it because Minnesota can ' t win on_the_road and Minneapolis has no suburbs named &quot; Sacramento , &quot; &quot; Los Angeles &quot; and &quot; Charlotte. &quot; George_Washington and James_Madison can ' t win it because they ' re dead . That leaves us with . . . Hawaii . Hawaii , home of the always colorful Rainbow Warriors . Hawaii , land of pearly white sand , turquoise blue waves and golden sunshine . A great place to catch a basketball_game , I always say . can ' t think_of any reason to rule_out Hawaii . So I ' m going_with Hawaii . All the way . By a lei up . See you there at the victory parade .</TEXT>
