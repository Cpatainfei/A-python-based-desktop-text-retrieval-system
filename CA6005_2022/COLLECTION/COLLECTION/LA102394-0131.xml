   <HEADLINE> A DOWNTOWN DIVA DOES THE ' 90S ; LAURIE ANDERSON GAVE ' 70S PERFORMANCE ART A POP_MUSIC TWIST IN THE ' 80S TO HUGE ACCLAIM . AFTER FIVE YEARS OF LYING_LOW , SHE ' S MAKING RECORDS AGAIN . THE QUESTION IS -- CAN THE QUEEN OF MULTIMEDIA HIP FIND A PLACE IN THE NEW DECADE ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> One of the first things you notice about Laurie Anderson , offstage , is the lack of . . . The Pause . She speaks plain ly , pleasantly , sometimes drifting_off onto tangents , only to swerve back suddenly to_the_point at_hand . But you half-expect . . . The Pause . Her signature pause , lining the path to some incisive or mock-naive observation , or a cheeky non_sequitur , has become a personal signifier . The Pause , co-opted from both stand-up comic shtick and chic ' 80s art-world irony , is central to the oft-imitated operative Laurie Anderson vocabulary . The Pause lets you know that what you ' re hearing may or may_not be the gospel_truth . It lets you know that behind that dimpled and spike-coiffed image may be an incurable trickster taking you for a ride . There ' s a danger of self-parody that Anderson , now in her late 40s , faces as she rejoins the cultural scene with the Tuesday release on the Warner Bros . label of &quot; Bright Red , &quot; her first album in more_than four years ( see review , Page 92 ) . Not only has she had many imitators , but she ' s repeated her act so often herself that her trademark idiosyncrasies threaten to become cliche . Anderson burst into the ' 80s as a new kind of accessible conceptualist , with the surprise hit &quot; O Superman. &quot; Then came various projects that established her as the rare_bird who leaped from the art world to the pop world . Her large-scale early- ' 80s multimedia piece &quot; United States : Part I-IV &quot; combined song , projections and surreal theatrics . The music portion of the show became a landmark five-record set for Warner Bros . ( 1984 ) . She also recorded &quot; Big Science &quot; ( 1982 ) , &quot; Mister Heartbreak &quot; ( 1984 ) , &quot; Home of the Brave &quot; ( soundtrack to the 1986 film ) and &quot; Strange Angels &quot; ( 1989 ) for the label . Anderson carved an impressive swath through the ' 80s . But the question now : Is Anderson ready for the ' 90s -- or vice versa ? Anderson ' s place in SoHo is a spacious spread in a building overlooking the Hudson_River . In timeless house-upstairs , shop-downstairs tradition , she lives_on the sixth floor and works in her fully equipped home studio on the floor below . Her hardwood-floored flat is Spartan in decor , making such artifacts as a photo of the Dalai Lama , a koto on the wall and a pinata all_the more conspicuous . * Wearing jeans and a gray vest over a button-down white shirt , Anderson displays only one hint of flamboyance this day : her Neapolitan-hued sneakers . She smokes filter-less cigarettes and serves visitors cappuccino while unveiling the just-finished new album in the comforts of her home studio . A restless sort , she interrupts the interview to answer the phone and to deal with a number of guests dropping_by . A view of the river peeks out from behind her mixing console . Boats slice silently through the water below , almost dreamily . Listening to the freshly mixed new album , coated with the gauzy , ambient overlay that producer Brian Eno is known for , one can easily imagine the creative environment feeding the art . In conversation , Anderson comes_off candid , earnest , especially when discussing the nuts-and-bolts aspects of her work . But she also seems to have a keen ability to swerve off the subject , perhaps to maintain control of an interview . When the question of her hiatus from recording comes_up , she skillfully brushes it aside , rambling about the lack of venues for video artists , or the promise of better living through the Internet . In fact , she spent a year putting_together a book , &quot; Stories From the Nerve Bible , &quot; which came_out this spring , and has been doing various film projects . Though Anderson ' s roots are in the shock-tactical performance art scene of the ' 70s , her presentation has always been less about confrontation or archetype smashing than about an almost childlike wonder . She ' s all about connections of dots , parts and ideas not normally linked . She plays violin but has filled the instrument with water or replaced strings with a tape head that played spoken bits of language . She is never about one thing at any given time . She lives_in the hyphens that inevitably pop_up in descriptions of the real Laurie Anderson , as performance artist-pop singer-storyteller-poet-author-violinist-postmodern deconstructionist-multimedia conjurer . Androgynous , topical and yet universal , Anderson covers a lot of bases at once without ever getting stuck_in one place . Does this slippery tendency boil_down to an aesthetic statement , a defense_mechanism or both ? Anderson seems to revel in her role as a hard-to-categorize cult heroine in pop_music . &quot; If pop is the mainstream , I ' m an offshoot , &quot; she comments . &quot; Maybe I ' m a slightly parallel , smaller stream . In a way , I still feel_like I ' m someone from the art world who happens to be occasionally making records . I ' m not exactly cranking them out , &quot; she says , laughing . &quot; I appreciate Warner Bros . for that : They don ' t ever call and say , ' Are you making any music these days ? ' It ' s great . Well , also , I ' m like a vanity artist for them , an in-house intellectual to be tolerated . I ' m also a kind of catalogue artist . People might actually be interested in something from 10 years ago , since my records never creep_up any chart . But they have a little life of_their_own , and I ' m happy with that . &quot; I don ' t care about selling a lot of records , because I never thought that the more people bought my records , the better it was . I would probably tend to think the opposite . I ' m that much of a snob . Don ' t get me wrong . I love pop culture . I find it entertaining but only on the level of something to criticize -- in a way to be a gadfly and say , ' Do you really think this is important ? ' But you can ' t just do that , because then you ' re just a crank over on the side. &quot; But in this area , as in many others , Anderson displays her duality ; while professing that she doesn ' t care if she sells , she wants people to buy . &quot; Look , I could entertain myself very well here at_home . I also like doing concerts . That would be fine , &quot; she says . &quot; But to make stuff , manufacture things that nobody buys ? What ' s the point in that ? &quot; L ike her earlier albums , &quot; Bright Red &quot; is endearingly quirky and full of artful dodging , yet it seems more personal and darkly reflective . Where once Anderson sang of angels and made bemused commentaries about common experiences , on &quot; Bright Red &quot; there are demons afoot . She addresses darker subjects : AIDS ( &quot; Love Among the Sailors &quot; ) , apocalypse ( &quot; Muddy River &quot; ) , infidels ( &quot; Poison &quot; ) , mortality ( &quot; World Without End &quot; ) and the bleary rush of time ( &quot; Same Time Tomorrow &quot; ) . As with everything else she does , Anderson ' s &quot; Stories From the Nerve Bible &quot; strays from the straight_line of orthodoxy , as a non-chronological collection and examination of her work thus far . In an unorthodox promotional tour for the book , Anderson performed to a packed house at UCLA in April . Not only did she read from the book , but she also previewed material from &quot; Bright Red , &quot; armed with electronic violin and a keyboard . During the reading , she relied_on electronic effects to enhance the storytelling aspect , at times using a booming male voice , as she often does_in performance , sounding like an android version of Charles Kuralt . When it finally came time to record &quot; Bright Red , &quot; the material came_out in a relative torrent . &quot; I wrote very fast -- 25 songs in six weeks , &quot; Anderson said . &quot; I ' ve never written that fast , lyrics-wise . I ' ve written a lot of music pieces . I think it was because I had just finished this book , ' Stories From the Nerve Bible , ' and I was really used to being_on my computer . &quot; Also , when you do a book , you finally realize what ' s been important to you -- what are the things that you really want to say . I realize that they were always the same . There were stories and songs that were very short and really direct , very simple language , nothing fancy -- a tilted , skewed version of what you ' re looking_at but still not oblique . It ' s just ' Here ' s what happened . Listen to this. ' &quot; They were very much about talking to someone . Conversation was a big theme on this album , and that ' s where the duets came in. &quot; There are several duets on the album , including two with Phil Ballou and the chant-like &quot; In Our Sleep &quot; with Lou Reed , to whom Anderson has been romantically linked of late . But the most unusual duet features Anderson with Arto Lindsay on the unsettling title track , on which the two vocalists swap lyrics , word for word , melting into a mutant , dual-faceted persona . &quot; I wanted to do a duet that wasn ' t just him-and-her . That song reminds me of ' Last Year at Marienbad ' or something , &quot; she says , referring to the 1961 Alain Resnais film . &quot; It ' s a weird situation of a couple who are sort of promising things to each other , and then there are odd , threatening things that happened . Then , in the middle , there ' s the bit from the Bible , from Isaiah , about ' the hairy ones will dance there. ' You ' re thinking , ' What is this ? ' &quot; One reason I placed it second on the album is that it ' s a difficult piece . Originally , I thought maybe I should put it later when people are more used_to the album . But then I thought , no , it has to be toward the beginning , because that ' s so_much what the record is about . If people have trouble with that , then they probably shouldn ' t listen to the rest of it anyway . It ' s the separate-the-men-from-the-boys track . If you don ' t like this , don ' t waste your time with the rest of it. &quot; The less-than-festive thematic thread of &quot; Bright Red &quot; came as something of a surprise to Anderson : &quot; When I actually looked_at what they were about , they were all about the same thing -- not just love but destruction , equally , either through memory or some cataclysmic thing . There ' s a song called ' Night in Baghdad. ' There was a CNN report in which they were saying that all this bombing stuff was so beautiful , like fireworks . &quot; Then it becomes a question of what ' s beautiful . There is something gorgeous about destruction , and liberating too . Unless you ' re the one who ' s being destroyed . The end of that song ends_up with the question ' Did you ever love me ? ' And the answer is ' Only when you danced , so beautiful , it was like the Fourth of July. ' You think_about war and love . Many of the songs were about that. &quot; O pening the album on an am bivalent note is &quot; Speechless , &quot; &quot; about a symbiotic relationship that really went wrong. &quot; &quot; One person can ' t talk , and the other one ends_up doing all_the talking , &quot; Anderson explains . &quot; So the other person is in the passenger seat , unable to say a word . It ' s a beautiful story by Annie Dillard . She saw an eagle fly down , with the skull of a weasel attached_to its mouth . So she speculated that the eagle had gone_down to attack the weasel , and the weasel had sunk its teeth into the eagle and held_on until it rotted . It became this horrid albatross swinging away. &quot; Musicians on &quot; Bright Red &quot; include jazz-and-then-some drummer Joey Baron , Brazilian percussionist Cyro Baptista , guitarist Adrian Belew and renowned New Music accordionist Guy Klucevsek . &quot; That was going_to be the original instrumentation of the album , &quot; Anderson says . &quot; I thought , ' I ' ll just do_it with these elements -- Brazilian percussion , drums , bass , accordion , violin and keyboards. ' It had this warped Nina Rota kind of feel . It was a very cool band sound. &quot; But what came_out in the end , after much reconfiguring and evolution , was a sparser , more enigmatic and diverse sound . &quot; I did a_couple_of songs with the band and started hearing some birds in there , some_other kinds of thought or instruments , &quot; she says . &quot; I was missing other certain textures , so I piled a bunch of those on . And then eventually , at the end , I stripped things way back . There was a song , ' Muddy River , ' with nine bass players on it . In the end , it was stripped_down to almost nothing. &quot; She laughs . &quot; I guess this is my minimal period. &quot; Anderson has lived_in SoHo long enough to pine for the old , pre-gentrification days of the mid- ' 70s , when her interdisciplinary aesthetic started taking_shape . Twenty years later , Anderson is one of the world ' s best-known and skilled multimedia mediators , one of whose juggling acts has been to thrive in an urban setting while avoiding the edgier aspects of urban life and art . Living here , she says , &quot; had a big impact on a lot of my preferences , a lot of my friends , a lot of what I think is interesting , which is in the avant-garde . There still is a bit of avant-garde left . People are doing interesting things . There are occasionally great shows in galleries . &quot; Also , I ' m the kind of person who has to feel_like I ' m part of a neighborhood . I like that . SoHo has changed enormously since then . It ' s a lot of shoe_stores now , really . I ' m not really fooling myself by thinking that the avant-garde is centered here , but there still is stuff going_on . All of my longest friendships and collaborations are rooted here. &quot; A lthough her world of influence has expanded exponentially since she was an aspiring young artist 20 years ago , Anderson keeps_in contact with people from the &quot; neighborhood. &quot; Two days after this interview , Anderson performed her own music behind a poem by John Ashbery , a longtime friend , in New York . &quot; I knew John from my days when I was an art critic , back in the days when poets were critics &quot; -- she breaks_into a one-phrase song , &quot; ' when poets were critics . . . . ' &quot; That was really how they got their writing done -- they ' d go_to see paintings and write vaguely about the paintings but mostly work_on their style . It was illustrative writing. &quot; The ever-versatile Anderson has worked in film as well . Well-traveled between musical and visual dimensions and blessed with a strong instinct for the evocative atmospheres , she was a logical candidate to provide music for music-sensitive director Wim Wenders . &quot; His film ' Wings of Desire ' was about to premiere in Cannes ( in 1988 ) , and he was mixing_in a studio in town so he could run_over to the festival , &quot; she recalls . &quot; I can relate to that so heavily . He calls me up and says , ' Can you get me some angel fragments ? ' Oddly enough , I knew exactly what he meant . I asked , ' How many minutes ? ' ' Twenty. ' ' Great. ' &quot; So I put something together on a cassette , thinking that if he was interested , I ' d record it properly . Well , he used the cassette . The thing was it sounded just fine . He ' s really clever that way . He can take something that ' s a little bit rough and use it really well . He really loves music . He made original music videos 20 years ago when all his films were based on a piece_of_music . He would take a song and shoot the thing . He knows music really well. &quot; As influences from cinema go , Rainer Werner Fassbinder also ranks highly in her book . Like Fassbinder , Anderson ' s own work operates_on more_than one level . Raise the subject of the late German director , and Anderson becomes effusive . &quot; Here ' s a guy who ' s in this very heavy art scene in Munich , very tough , black leather , drugs . He could have been making hard-edged movies that were more like ' Querelle , ' &quot; she says of his 1982 film , &quot; but most of his films were about these giant middle-aged , middle-class German people who were very inarticulate . They were like pieces of upholstered furniture moving_around . He had such empathy for these people . It was incredible. &quot; Oddly enough , Anderson compares Fassbinder ' s character studies to early Bob Dylan songs . &quot; For the first time , instead of pop songs saying , ' Hey ho , look_at me , look_at my car , ' he was writing_about losers who didn ' t have it together . It was like a shock . &quot; And it was so personal . In a way , unless it ' s Billie Holiday singing , the blues almost has this generic quality -- like we ' ve all got the blues . Dylan has so many quirky personal details about why he feels bad . It ' s not just that he has the blues . He tells you exactly why , and what he ' s wearing and what he ' s seeing . Those two guys -- Dylan and Fassbinder -- have a lot in common. &quot; Much as she has preserved a sense of aloofness through her work , shards from Anderson ' s personal life continually crop_up . One of the sound sources on the song &quot; Tightrope &quot; in &quot; Bright Red &quot; comes from Anderson ' s private sonic archives , a recording of a Pentecostal preacher exhorting about the Second Coming . &quot; I recorded her in a church in the South about 10 years ago , &quot; Anderson says , &quot; and always wanted to do something with her . This was , unfortunately , where she landed , but I ' ve got hours of it . She was the most charismatic , fabulous speaker . It was the kind of service where everyone was just jumping up and down and having a wild time , with a trap set_on the altar . It was really a great service , just rollicking . &quot; My grandmother was a Southern Baptist , and I used to go_with her ( to church ) to see the brothers and sisters sing . It was that kind of sweaty , wild service where people would lose_it from time to time and roll in the aisles . &quot; The only time I ' d seen anything like it was in Jerusalem in a Reform synagogue . People did the same thing standing_up , shoulder to shoulder , making vocal noises and seeing things . I thought , ' This is what it should be like , ' not just sitting calmly in those rows and listening to someone saying , ' You were wrong , you were wrong , you should really try harder. ' You leave exhausted , thinking , ' Oh , I ' ve failed again. ' &quot; In her work , Anderson has long drawn_on religious references , through direct biblical quotations or by incorporating performance techniques borrowed from gospel traditions . Why the religious veneer ? &quot; I don ' t know why , &quot; Anderson says , shrugging . &quot; Maybe it ' s the millennial thing . A lot of my childhood was about scare stories -- these very weird Bible stories , with talking snakes and parting oceans . Regular people who were adults were telling me these things , mowing their lawns , going_to potluck parties , and then they ' d tell me these fantastic things as truth . That was my first taste of surrealism . Normal people telling me that clowns are going_to rise_up out of their cars and go somewhere . It opened_up another world for me. &quot; Did this early exposure to religion provide seeds for her future art and her wild imagination ? &quot; In a sense , because it also involved believing something , &quot; she says . &quot; I always thought that the reason I was attracted to art was that it almost gave meaning to people ' s lives , especially in the early days of SoHo . People were very intense about what this meant . We were in another world , and it was an alternative to this one . It was more complex , and better , just basically a better world . It was a world full of wild aspirations . &quot; I made contact with other people . It wasn ' t isolated . I really do think that the biggest problem &quot; -- she suddenly speaks brashly , like a huckster street-corner preacher -- &quot; the biggest problem here in this country &quot; -- then she returns to a more serious tone -- &quot; is loneliness . You ' re sold so_much stuff all_the time about what ' s supposed to mean something . Pop culture is a good_example of that , or the news . You have this fake connection to the world , as if you know what ' s going_on . But , really , the things they ' re talking_about are gossip -- which I love . But it ' s not what gives meaning to my life . It ' s just for fun . Any of the major questions that I have -- like ' Why am I here ? ' -- nobody even attempts to grapple with . &quot; One of the reasons that I put a talking piece at the end of this record was because there are so many questions in the lyrics , &quot; Anderson says , referring to &quot; Same Time Tomorrow. &quot; I noticed that on the lyric sheets and did a question-mark search with my computer . There are tons of them , all_over the place . There are very few answers . It ' s mostly because I ' ve always hated people who come_up with answers. &quot; She pauses , taking a drag_on her cigarette , and continues : &quot; Asking a good question is real important . People will all come_up with their own answers in their own lives to given questions . There are lots of different kinds of questions to ask , to help point to some of those things. &quot; *</TEXT>
