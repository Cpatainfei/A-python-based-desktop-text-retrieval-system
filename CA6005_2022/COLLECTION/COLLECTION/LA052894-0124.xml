   <HEADLINE> MCNALL GOES INTO BANKRUPTCY ; FINANCE : A YEAR AFTER HE IS OWNER OF A STANLEY CUP FINALIST , CREDITORS TAKE HIM TO COURT , WHERE HE ENTERS INTO CHAPTER 11 .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bruce McNall ' s deteriorating financial_condition culminated Friday in an agreement whereby he reluctantly agreed to enter bankruptcy proceedings . The action , taken_in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Los Angeles , caps a yearlong financial slide for the Kings ' president , who last May was being hailed as one of nation ' s most successful and innovative sports entrepreneurs when his club reached the Stanley Cup_finals . Friday ' s development came during a hearing on efforts by four of his creditors -- including three banks who claim that McNall owes them nearly $ 162 million -- to force McNall into bankruptcy proceedings that would have resulted in liquidation of his assets . U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Lisa Hill Fenning instead converted the petition to a Chapter 11 case under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code , meaning an attempt will be made to restructure McNall ' s finances and pay his creditors . A trustee is to be named next week to administer the proceedings and to inventory McNall ' s assets . Operation of the Kings , with which McNall remains active in hockey-related decisions , is not expected to be affected , lawyers said . &quot; His spin_doctors are going_to say he voluntarily did this to help his creditors , &quot; said Los Angeles lawyer Robert A . Meyer , who represents McNall ' s most aggressive creditor , the French-owned Credit Lyonnais Bank Nederland . &quot; that ' s nonsense . The reason this happened is we chased him into bankruptcy court. &quot; The bank claims it is owed $ 121 million in loans made to McNall-affiliated enterprises , including a movie production firm , a horse_racing operation and a coin business . McNall ' s bankruptcy lawyer , Richard L . Wynne , said his client would have preferred to stay out of bankruptcy proceedings but acknowledged that creditors forced the issue . &quot; Bruce didn ' t seek bankruptcy protection . He was trying to work_out his problems with his creditors outside of bankruptcy court , &quot; Wynne said . He added that Chapter 11 proceedings will ensure &quot; a fair and level playing ground for all creditors. &quot; The case is expected to be slowed by a grand_jury investigation into whether McNall has falsified financial_statements . In two deposition-like hearings with creditors , McNall has declined to answer most questions , repeatedly invoking his Fifth_Amendment right , protecting him against self-incrimination . McNall ' s creditors have argued that he is using the Fifth_Amendment as a shield to avoid questions unrelated to his criminal case . His criminal defense_lawyer , Tom Pollack , countered by calling McNall ' s taking_the_Fifth as &quot; both prudent and appropriate. &quot; According to subpoenas filed_in the bankruptcy case , the grand_jury is seeking records related to loans made to McNall or his businesses by 12 financial_institutions , including Bank of America , Credit Lyonnais , Bank of California , Union Bank and First National_Bank of Louisville . McNall ' s finances have suffered because of such factors as a high debt load and softness in the rare coin business that was the foundation of his business empire . He was sole owner of the Kings until earlier this month , when he sold 72 % of the franchise for $ 60 million as part of plan to pay_off a $ 92-million business loan made by Bank of America . The team is now controlled by telecommunications executive Jeffrey P . Sudikoff and entertainment executive Joseph M . Cohen . Exactly how much McNall owes is in_dispute . Public records and interviews with creditors place the amount at about $ 200 million , although McNall is known to dispute at least half that . Although the filing gives McNall some breathing room , the action nonetheless tarnishes his business image . A few years ago , he told reporters that he was worth from $ 150 million to $ 200 million . Court records show that as recently as nine months ago , one of McNall ' s businesses sent a financial_statement to Credit Lyonnais listing his net worth as $ 157.7 million at the end of 1992 . Credit Lyonnais lawyer Meyer said the bank now questions the accuracy of the statement . Earlier this week , the creditors were joined by an unusual and previously unknown creditor -- a trust that is liquidating former Texas tycoon William Herbert Hunt ' s assets . Hunt , along with his brother , Nelson , are former McNall clients who sought bankruptcy protection in the 1980s after an infamous collapse of their silver fortune . The trust , which formally joined the three banks in seeking to liquidate McNall ' s assets , is owed payments reimbursing it for an alleged ancient bronze antique bust that McNall sold to William Hunt for $ 915 # 000 in the early 1980s . The trustee overseeing Hunt ' s assets challenged the &quot; antique &quot; last year as a fraud , saying it was only about 30 years old . McNall , who disagreed , nonetheless agreed to pay the money back and still owes about $ 750 # 000 , according to trustee Steven S . Turoff .</TEXT>
