   <HEADLINE> THEIR ' WATERLOO ' AT DIEN BIEN PHU STILL RANKLES FRENCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s synonymous with overwhelming defeat , an utter rout that four decades later is the modern Frenchman ' s Waterloo . France ' s defeat at Dien Bien Phu by a Vietnamese peasant army still causes shudders and shrugs among French today . &quot; It leaves the image on one hand of defeat , on the other of relief , because it meant the end of the war in Vietnam , &quot; said Henri Tabah , a 73-year-old art photographer . &quot; But it was at much too high a price. &quot; The 40th anniversary of Dien Bien Phu is being overshadowed in France by the 50th anniversary of the D-Day landings in Normandy in June , the 80th anniversary of the declaration of World_War I in August and the 40th anniversary of the start of the Algerian war in November , according to the Ministry of Veterans ' Affairs . &quot; Besides , it ' s not something we French commemorate much , &quot; Tabah said . Many young French_people have little awareness of this corner of France ' s past . &quot; Something over in China , was that it ? &quot; frowned Patrice Chesnaie , a butcher ' s apprentice in his 20s . &quot; Sorry , I only know the name. &quot; Dien Bien Phu was &quot; a particularly searing symbol of French military defeat , &quot; according to the authoritative Perrin ' s Historical Encyclopedia of France . Unlike Americans the_French have resisted confronting their Vietnam experience , and only in 1992 did the first feature_film about Dien Bien Phu appear . Director Pierre Schoendorffer , himself taken prisoner_of_war during the battle , felt moved to make the film &quot; Dien Bien Phu &quot; because &quot; it ' s a European tradition to let the wounds heal without talking_about them. &quot; &quot; For me , it ' s a sacred place , &quot; Schoendorffer said when he revisited the battlefield . &quot; This was a country we loved , this was our last battle . . . . But we can come_back with our heads high , with respect for the Vietnamese. &quot;</TEXT>
