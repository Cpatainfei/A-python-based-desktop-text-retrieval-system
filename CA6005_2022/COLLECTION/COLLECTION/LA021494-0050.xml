   <HEADLINE> JAPAN MUST OPEN ITS MARKETS , HOSOKAWA SAYS ; TRADE : PRIME_MINISTER SEEKS TO AVOID POSSIBLE U.S. SANCTIONS AFTER TALKS FAIL , AS KEY TOKYO STOCK INDEX FALLS 3 % ON CONCERN OVER U.S. RETALIATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa , seeking to head_off possible U.S. trade sanctions , on Sunday said Japan should take unilateral steps to open its markets to foreign goods and reduce its huge trade surplus . &quot; The ball is now in Japan ' s court , &quot; Hosokawa told reporters traveling with him from Washington back to Tokyo . &quot; We must use our brains . Japan will do what it can on its own. &quot; Hosokawa said he will meet today and Tuesday with cabinet members to discuss what steps Japan should take . Meanwhile , a key index of Japanese stocks was down 3 % at midday today on concern that the failure of last week ' s trade talks between Tokyo and Washington will lead to retaliation against Japanese exporters , traders said . In midday trading , the benchmark Nikkei 225-stock average was off 590.46 points to 19 # 400.24. Other Asian stocks also tumbled in midday trading today , dragged_down by general uneasiness about trade issues , the U.S. dollar ' s weakness and rising U.S. interest_rates . Hong Kong ' s Hang Seng index fell 371.63 points , or 3.2 % , to 11 # 132.40. Taipei ' s weighted index slumped 273.76 points , or 4.4 % , to 6 # 020.37. Expectations that the United States would seek to drive_up the value of the yen were reflected on the Tokyo foreign_exchange market , where the U.S. dollar finished today ' s morning session at 106.05 yen , down 2.20 yen from Thursday ' s close ( Japanese markets were closed Friday ) . A strong yen makes Japanese exports more expensive and thus harder to sell , while foreign imports to Japan become more of a bargain . It remains unclear what steps Washington might take_in reaction to the breakdown in trade talks , but there have been indications that a first_step in punitive sanctions could come as early as Tuesday . That is the deadline for a determination on whether Japan has lived_up_to a 1989 agreement on opening its cellular_telephone market . Some analysts see a risk that Japan and the United States may fall_into a downward spiral of mutual retaliation . The Nihon Keizai Shimbun , a leading economic daily , declared Sunday that &quot; Japan and the United States are in a state of economic war in the wake of the breakdown of the framework trade talks. &quot; But most reaction in Japan has been more muted . When Hosokawa and President Clinton announced that they had failed to reach a trade agreement at their Friday summit , the dominant reaction of Japanese commentators , business_leaders and government officials seemed to be satisfaction that the Tokyo-Washington relationship has reached a new level of maturity in which the two sides can bluntly disagree . Hosokawa ' s apparent intent is to carry_out many of the steps offered by Japan during the trade talks . As part of a plan to open Japan ' s insurance market , and for government procurement of medical and telecommunications_equipment , Japan had offered a variety of deregulatory and open bidding measures to increase foreign penetration . Japan had also offered to facilitate cooperation between Japanese and U.S. auto_makers to boost the import of U.S. automobiles and auto parts . Hosokawa told reporters that an overall agreement had been &quot; 80 % to 90 % complete &quot; when the talks broke_down over the issue of numerical targets . Japan ' s refusal to agree to targets reflected a lack of certainty that these steps would achieve the degree of progress demanded by the United States . It thus remains unclear whether Hosokawa is capable of taking steps that would have sufficiently dramatic effects in boosting foreign imports and reducing the trade surplus . If there is any real risk of a debilitating breakdown in economic ties , the roots of such danger may lie_in what continue to be profoundly different perceptions of who is at_fault in the persistent trade imbalances . Most Japanese , from top officials to ordinary citizens , do not believe that Japanese trade_barriers are the main problem . Higher savings rates in Japan and insufficient efforts by American exporters -- symbolized by the failure of U.S. auto_makers to build small right-hand-drive cars for the Japanese market -- get most of the blame for the trade imbalance . Japanese confidence in the face of U.S. threats is based on a variety of factors . One is the hope that Tokyo can take enough steps_on its own to show significant results . Officials also believe that the two economies are so deeply intertwined that there is relatively little the United States can do_in the way of sanctions that would not penalize U.S. companies and consumers just as much as Japanese exporters . Punitive actions by Washington are seen as likely to violate international rules agreed upon in the recently concluded worldwide trade talks under the General_Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . Also , Washington is not fully united on the issue of what to do next . The greatest fear in Japan may be that Washington will try to talk up the value of the yen . Many analysts think this is the only effective weapon in Washington ' s possession . But too high a yen could cut_off any Japanese recovery . That would work counter to the Clinton_Administration ' s wish to see greater domestic Japanese demand pull_in more imports . Also , it may_not be that easy to push_up the value of the yen . With Japan still in recession , while the U.S. economy shows strong growth and rising interest_rates , economic forces could force the yen the other way .</TEXT>
