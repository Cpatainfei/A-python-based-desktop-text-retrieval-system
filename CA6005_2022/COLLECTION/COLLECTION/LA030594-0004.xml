   <HEADLINE> WHITE_HOUSE AIDES GET WHITEWATER SUBPOENAS ; PROBE : THE FOCUS IS_ON NINE ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS . PRESIDENTIAL COUNSEL NUSSBAUM ' S RESIGNATION SEEN NEAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Whitewater special counsel Robert B . Fiske Jr . on Friday subpoenaed nine Clinton_Administration officials , including White_House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum , whose resignation is considered imminent because of the way he has handled the Whitewater controversy . Those subpoenaed include six White_House aides who participated in meetings with Treasury_Department officials about aspects of the investigation into the Whitewater Development Corp. , an Ozark Mountain real_estate venture in which then-Arkansas Gov . Bill_Clinton and his wife , Hillary Rodham Clinton , were partners . Fiske had been expected to subpoena Administration officials as part of his effort to determine what happened in the Whitewater matter , but his decision to summon those involved in the White House-Treasury Department meetings makes_it clear that he also intends to examine subsequent related actions to see if any improprieties occurred . Subpoenaed were Nussbaum , White_House counselor Bruce Lindsey ; Deputy Chief_of_Staff Harold Ickes ; Communications Director Mark D . Gearan ; Hillary Clinton ' s chief_of_staff , Margaret Williams ; and the First_Lady ' s press secretary , Lisa Caputo . Lindsey has been the chief White_House official handling Whitewater-related questions for Clinton . Ickes , Williams and Nussbaum met last month with Deputy Treasury_Secretary Roger Altman , who briefed them on procedures that the Resolution Trust Corp . -- a Treasury agency -- was following in pursuing its investigation of Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan , a failed Arkansas thrift that was owned by James B . McDougal , the Clintons ' partner in the real_estate deal . Gearan and Nussbaum took_part in a meeting last fall with Treasury_Department officials at which the Madison Guaranty investigation was discussed . Participants have said that they discussed only one topic at the meeting : how to respond to press inquiries about Madison Guaranty . Fiske also subpoenaed Altman and two other Treasury_Department officials who participated in the meetings -- General Counsel Jean E . Hanson and Joshua Steiner , the department ' s chief_of_staff . Nussbaum has been under_fire for allowing the meetings to take_place and for participating in them . Congressional Republicans and other critics have charged that the meetings could have allowed White_House officials to interfere with the Treasury_Department ' s investigation of possible wrongdoing at Madison Guaranty . President Clinton conceded Thursday that the meetings , two last fall and one last month , created an appearance of impropriety . Fiske is investigating the Clintons ' role in Whitewater Development and , among other things , whether funds from Madison Guaranty might have been used to pay_off Clinton campaign debts or to offset their losses on the real_estate venture . The Clintons have said that they lost about $ 69 # 000 in Whitewater . Madison Guaranty was seized by federal regulators in 1989 at a cost to taxpayers of between $ 47 million and $ 60 million . In a memorandum to the White_House staff , Deputy Counsel Joel Klein said that the subpoenas , which call_for the officials to appear in federal_district court in Washington on March 10 , cover &quot; any and all documents and / or communications referring or relating to any contacts , meetings or conversations about or regarding Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan , its subsidiaries or affiliates &quot; between White_House staff and officials of the Treasury_Department or the RTC . Klein warned that &quot; the destruction of documents after receipt of this subpoena may constitute obstruction of justice &quot; and suggested that , &quot; if you have any doubt about whether a particular document is called_for . . , you must save it. &quot; Klein also directed White_House aides not to purge any computer records and directed officials to stop removing any paper from the White_House , including trash thrown_in wastebaskets . White_House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said staff_members would fully comply with the subpoenas and that the White_House would have no other comment . Clinton was informed of the subpoenas about 7 p.m. Friday , shortly before they were served , aides said , and he instructed the staff to cooperate . The subpoenas , the first known to have been issued to White_House officials in the investigation , could temporarily delay the resignation of Nussbaum , whose yearlong tenure as the White_House chief counsel has been marked by frequent controversy . Earlier in the day , Clinton conspicuously distanced himself from his embattled aide at a White_House press_conference , ducking several public opportunities to voice confidence in him . &quot; I have nothing more to add_to what I said yesterday , &quot; Clinton said when asked about Nussbaum . Clinton ' s reference was to remarks he made Thursday criticizing the meetings Nussbaum attended with Treasury_Department officials . &quot; We have to be careful , &quot; Clinton said at the press_conference . &quot; I think I have sent a very clear and unambiguous signal that there ' s no point in letting a process mess this White_House up when we have not yet been accused of any wrongdoing . And since there was no wrongdoing on my part , I want a full , complete , thorough investigation , and I want it to go_forward unimpeded and then to be over. &quot; While Clinton did not mention Nussbaum by name , his words appeared to be a clear rebuke , given that Nussbaum ' s job has been to oversee the internal processes of the White_House to ensure that they do not &quot; mess up. &quot; As he has done before , Clinton complained about the political use that Republicans have made of the Whitewater matter , saying that &quot; there is no evidence of abuse of authority on my part as President , or any of the kinds of things for which their parties and administrations were accused . &quot; The Republicans have behaved in a fairly blatant , bald and totally political way , &quot; Clinton said . &quot; Since they have often complained in the past of political motivation , I think that they would show a little more restraint and judgment in this case. &quot; But White_House officials made_it clear that Clinton , who thought the Whitewater issue had been taken_off his back by the appointment of Fiske as a special counsel earlier this year , also believes that he was let_down by members of his staff , including Nussbaum . Clinton and Nussbaum subsequently met in the Oval Office , and officials predicted that the presidential aide ' s resignation would come Friday evening . After news of the subpoenas surfaced , officials said the announcement was put_off but that it could come as early as today . The formal letters of resignation and presidential acceptance were prepared and ready for release , officials said . The 57-year-old Nussbaum has long been close to the First Family . As a lawyer on the House Judiciary Committee ' s staff when it considered the impeachment of President Richard Nixon during his Administration ' s Watergate scandal , Nussbaum hired the young Hillary Rodham and supervised her work . She , in turn , introduced him to her then-boyfriend , Bill_Clinton . During the presidential contest , Nussbaum , who had subsequently carried_on a highly successful career as a litigator , provided advice and counsel to Clinton during some of the campaign ' s toughest moments , including the week that Gennifer Flowers , a former Little_Rock night club singer , publicly accused Clinton of carrying_on a lengthy extramarital affair with her . After the election , Clinton asked Nussbaum to take_on the counsel ' s job . In that post , he had some notable successes . He oversaw the process that led to the appointment of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court and the selection of Louis J . Freeh to head the FBI . But more often , Nussbaum seemed to pop_up in the middle of problem areas . He was widely accused within the White_House of having mishandled the aborted nomination of Judge Kimba M . Wood to be attorney_general and the nomination of C . Lani Guinier to head the Justice_Department ' s civil_rights division . He also participated in the controversy that began with the firing of the staff of the White_House travel office . After his deputy , Vincent Foster , apparently committed suicide last summer , Nussbaum supervised the White_House effort to manage the police_investigation , leading to still-unsubstantiated accusations that he blocked investigators in an attempt to hide something . Nussbaum ' s defenders accused critics of having twisted his actions -- ascribing sinister motives to innocent decisions . But even his friends conceded that Nussbaum consistently appeared to ignore the political and public aspects of representing a client who is President of the United States .</TEXT>
