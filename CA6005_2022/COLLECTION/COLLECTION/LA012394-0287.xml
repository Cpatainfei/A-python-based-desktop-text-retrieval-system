   <HEADLINE> DOLE , KEMP ATTACK CLINTON HEALTH PLAN ; POLICIES : THE POSSIBLE GOP PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ALSO CRITICIZE THE PRESIDENT ' S FOREIGN AGENDA AND WELFARE REFORM STRATEGY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Two presumed GOP presidential hopefuls challenged the assumptions behind President Clinton ' s health_care reform agenda Saturday and attacked the White_House on issues ranging from foreign_policy to welfare reform . Insisting that there is &quot; no crisis &quot; in health_care , Senate Minority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) told the Republican National Committee ' s winter meeting that polls show 85 % of all Americans are satisfied with their coverage . And Jack Kemp , a former GOP congressman and Cabinet member during the George_Bush Administration , told the gathering later in the day that Clinton ' s health_care package relies too_much on government control . Without offering a specific alternative , Kemp , now co-director of Empower America , a public policy and advocacy organization , suggested that Republicans should rally behind a plan that relies more on private enterprise . Dole and Kemp , considered to be among the front-runners for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996 , appeared before their party faithful as Clinton prepared to address the nation on health_care and other issues in his State of the Union speech Tuesday night . &quot; President Clinton has scared the American people into thinking we ' ve got_to radically nationalize and have the government control all_the decisions in the marketplace , &quot; Kemp told an enthusiastic crowd . Attacking the President ' s approach on health_care and crime , Kemp said Clinton &quot; ran in the center , but he ' s turning left. &quot; Dole noted that Congress will begin tackling health_care reform when it reconvenes this week and that Republicans have got some &quot; great plans . . . that are almost identical &quot; and &quot; it would n ' t take much to put them all together. &quot; He said he favored a plan put forth several years ago by Lloyd Bentsen , the former Democratic senator from Texas who is now Clinton ' s Treasury_secretary . Dole said it extended coverage for those needing it but did not upset the free-market system of private health insurers . &quot; We could add some things to make_it a pretty good bill , &quot; he said . Kemp also criticized Clinton ' s handling of foreign affairs . Referring to the warfare in Bosnia , he said that &quot; while your heart goes_out to the people of Sarajevo , the Administration just blusters . &quot; The world leadership developed by Ronald Reagan and George_Bush is just being dissipated away , &quot; he said . Turning_to welfare reform , Kemp said : &quot; We shouldn ' t pass health_care reform until we pass a radical welfare reform plan and put America back to work. &quot; Dole and Kemp agreed that the immediate task facing Republicans is to overcome their minority position in both houses of Congress . Come November , all 435 House seats , 34 of 100 Senate seats and many state governorships will be up for grabs . &quot; We have a great opportunity to pick_up seven Senate seats , but I ' m not sure we ' re going to be able to do that , &quot; Dole said . &quot; Our party has always been an optimistic party , &quot; Kemp added . Referring to the presidency , he said : &quot; We must go_out not just in the 50 states . I want to see this party aim at capturing the District of Columbia. &quot; Dole renewed his call_for a congressional investigation of the so-called Whitewater affair , which involves questions surrounding the First Family ' s participation in the Whitewater Development Corp . -- an Ozark Mountain vacation resort in which the Clintons invested with a friend , James B . McDougal , in 1978 . McDougal was president of a failed savings and loan and questions have arisen over whether he or the Clintons benefited improperly from their business arrangement . &quot; If the Democrats don ' t want to have a ( congressional ) hearing , they ' re going to have to suffer the consequences , &quot; Dole said , referring to expectations that Republicans will make the_matter a campaign issue . Last week , Atty . Gen . Janet Reno appointed New York attorney Robert B . Fiske Jr . as a special counsel to look_into the_matter .</TEXT>
