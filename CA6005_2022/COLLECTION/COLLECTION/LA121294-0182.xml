   <HEADLINE> 3 SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN ORANGE COUNTY EXPECT CASH CRISIS ; EDUCATION : OFFICIALS SAY THEY WILL RUN_OUT OF MONEY BY MARCH IF DENIED ACCESS TO FROZEN FUNDS . COUNTY WARNS THAT THOUSANDS MAY NOT GET PAID AFTER CHRISTMAS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Less than a week after Orange County filed for bankruptcy , top officials from three county school districts said Sunday that they will run_out of money by March at the latest unless they can withdraw cash from the now-frozen county investment pool . The county ' s Department_of_Education also has warned local superintendents that , despite repeated promises that payroll demands would be met , it has no guarantee that thousands of teachers and other school employees will receive paychecks a week after Christmas . School officials said aftershocks from the financial crisis will affect students in the next several months , possibly forcing the state to step_in and pay local school bills . &quot; The county has told us nothing , &quot; said Peter Hartman , superintendent of Saddleback Valley Unified School District , which along with Capistrano Unified and Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified school districts , face the looming financial problems . &quot; The bottom_line for us is even if we get access to all our property_taxes and state aid and federal aid , &quot; he said , &quot; it will not be enough to keep our schools open through the spring. &quot; Former state_Treasurer Thomas W . Hayes -- the county ' s new financial adviser -- said in an interview Sunday that he and a team from the Salomon Bros . investment_firm have been working around the clock to protect what ' s left in the county ' s portfolio . The fund has lost $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion in value , sources close to the restructuring effort confirmed Sunday . &quot; We ' re trying to systematically and thoroughly re-evaluate the situation and the value of the portfolio , then execute a plan_of_action that preserves as much as can , &quot; Hayes said . &quot; I don ' t want to tip my hand. &quot; In other developments Sunday : * Gov . Pete Wilson announced that he is sending state Auditor General Kurt Sjoberg to Orange County to help sort_out the financial crisis . A team of state auditors is expected to arrive in Orange County today to review all activities in the fund since July , 1994 , and audits from three previous years . * Investment_bankers analyzing the portfolio say last week ' s sales of collateral by the county ' s lenders consumed many of the easiest-to-sell securities . That leaves the county holding a higher proportion of complex securities that aren ' t as easily sold ; the residual portfolio is also especially exposed to changes in interest_rates -- an exposure the bankers will labor to diffuse . The investment banking sources also said that a lack of crucial documentation of the fund ' s administrative structure is creating a major obstacle to deciding how to apportion losses or income among the fund ' s investors . * Former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron , who resigned Dec . 5 , has offered to help auditors decipher his investment records , according to his lawyer . &quot; We ' d be more_than happy to cooperate with the county and its counsel in any way necessary to help , &quot; said attorney David Weichert . But county sources said Citron earlier rebuffed an effort to gain his cooperation . * The Orange County Transportation Authority board will unveil a plan today to keep the county ' s buses , rail services and construction contracts running_for the next 100 days . * A longtime county government critic is calling_for the Board of Supervisors to follow Citron ' s lead and resign . Tom Rogers , a member of a county taxpayers association , said of board_members , &quot; they ' re done , they ' re dead , they ' re through. &quot; Rogers , who said he has been deluged with calls from others who feel the same , said , &quot; I think they are more responsible than he ( Citron ) is . Ultimately , they are the stewards of the county ' s assets. &quot; No Federal Help Seen In Washington , Treasury_Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said the county shouldn ' t count_on a federal bailout . On ABC ' s &quot; This Week With David Brinkley , &quot; he said state and local_governments are responsible_for solving crises such_as the one in Orange County . &quot; It is up_to them to do a better job of risk management , &quot; Bentsen said . Hayes , who spent the weekend in Sacramento , where he lives , would not say whether the state was at_fault for giving Orange County too_much investment authority . He also would not say whether the state should do something to help bail_out the county . But he said the power of local_government to invest public funds clearly needs to be limited in the wake of the Orange County bankruptcy filing . &quot; I think a complete re-evaluation is in_order , &quot; said Hayes , who is_on a 90-day leave from his job as president of Metropolitan West Securities , which has offices in Sacramento and Los Angeles . Hayes said he had to be careful about disclosing his strategy for the portfolio because &quot; the things I say can move the market. &quot; But he said the first goal is to protect the remainder of the fund , putting it in much less risky investments . &quot; Orange County has been much more aggressive in its investments than the state of California , and as a result , they have higher bubbles of risks , &quot; he said . &quot; As interest_rates have gone_up , the value of the underlying assets have gone down. &quot; Hayes said he was not in position to say whether the ultimate losses will be greater than the $ 2 billion that is now being cited . He would not put a timetable on the restructuring , but he said that he would be &quot; proactive &quot; in alerting the public when decisions are reached . At Hayes ' urging , Gov . Wilson also is sending the state auditor general here to help . Sjoberg and a team of his auditors -- charged with reviewing expenditures , income and current fund balances -- will arrive today to help determine the shape of the county ' s current finances while Hayes continues to examine its investments , said H . D . Palmer , assistant director of the state ' s Department of Finance . &quot; Just as Tom ( Hayes ) is trying to get a clear picture of the county ' s investment funds , Kurt ' s team will look_at the operational side , &quot; Palmer said . Sjoberg ' s role will be to focus_on simple accounting questions , such_as whether the county has enough money to pay its bills , while Hayes continues to try to untangle the complexities of Orange County ' s investment practices , the governor ' s office said . Tougher Guidelines Wilson ' s action comes as several state legislators began issuing calls_for tightening_up investment guidelines for municipalities , at least bringing them in_line with more conservative rules the state is required to follow . In a letter to Sjoberg released Sunday , Wilson asked the state auditor to report back to the governor as he runs_across significant findings . &quot; Because of the immediate implications for the citizens of Orange County as well as implications relative to the state of California ' s credit rating , I am requesting that you immediately make information available to the Legislature , myself , and the public as you reach your incremental conclusions , &quot; Wilson wrote . Sjoberg ' s review will include an examination of fiscal practices as of June 30 , 1994 -- the start of the current fiscal_year -- as well as all audits conducted over the past three years . Supervisor Harriett Wieder first reacted with anger when a reporter told her that Wilson asked the state ' s auditor to review Orange County ' s financial records . She questioned whether the effort would duplicate the work already accomplished by the federal Securities and Exchange Commission . &quot; What we don ' t need are any more searches into the treasurer ' s finances ; that is what happened 10 days ago when the SEC spent hours and doing the same thing , &quot; Wieder said . &quot; Why spend all this extra_time and money and it sounds like the same thing ? &quot; Wieder also asked why she had not been informed of the action . &quot; I thought we were one of ( Wilson ' s ) best_friends ; aren ' t we his family ? &quot; Weider asked rhetorically . But Wieder later softened her stance . After conferring_with Supervisor William G . Steiner , Wieder said the move may have been part of the help Wilson had promised earlier in the form of financial experts . Several supervisors said they were also concerned about reports that Citron ' s records are in disarray . Wieder said the county might need Citron to figure it all out . &quot; I think it could probably be helpful since it seems no one else touched those things except him , &quot; Wieder said . And according to a source close to the county ' s rescue effort , Salomon Brothers is having problems such_as finding Acting Treasurer Matt Raabe ' s home phone_number . Supervisors gave assurances Sunday that schools would be first in_line for available dollars . And Bruce Bennett , the county ' s bankruptcy attorney , said the teachers will be paid . &quot; To the best of my knowledge , no one has told the schools that the county will cut_off their payroll Jan . 3 , &quot; he said . Officials said that in the worst case , the state would be required by law to keep schools open . &quot; The state must provide the education , &quot; said John F . Dean , the county ' s school_superintendent . &quot; It must keep the schools open . And keeping them open means paying the bills. &quot; Funding for Schools in County Still Murky School_superintendents for the first time Sunday demonstrated fears that by spring , they will run_out of money to operate their schools and have been given no guarantees that millions of dollars deposited with the county will be available to pay expenses ranging from medical_bills to the light bill . &quot; People say we like you and want to help you . But you need something you can take_to the bank . And banks won ' t cash good intentions , &quot; said Hartman of the Saddleback Valley Unified School District , which postponed plans to put finishing touches_on a new elementary_school over the upcoming school vacation . &quot; I ' m not trying to cry wolf or panic people , &quot; Hartman said . &quot; But we can ' t sugarcoat this. &quot; As public_school employees face an uncertain Christmas , county transportation officials are tackling the next 100 days . At its meeting today , the Orange County Transportation Authority board will get a plan to keep the county ' s public transportation moving for the next three months , said Stan Oftelie , chief operating officer of the agency . Officials said that they have identified funds that will enable them to continue with main freeway interchange projects now under construction , and will be able to keep buses and Metrolink services operating . Oftelie would not give details of the plan . &quot; It ' s a business plan on how we plan to move forward , &quot; Oftelie said Sunday . &quot; We have operated_on the scenario that we won ' t get money for 100 days. &quot; Montebello Mapping Out Its Legal Options Meanwhile Sunday , city officials in Montebello , which has $ 47 million invested in the Orange County pool , spent 3 1 / 2 hours behind closed doors mapping legal strategy with lawyers from the Los Angeles law_firm of Clark &amp; Trevithick . City officials stressed they are not planning to follow Orange County into bankruptcy . &quot; Chapter 9 bankruptcy is not being contemplated whatsoever , &quot; City Administrator Richard Torres said in a prepared statement . &quot; This alternative has been deemed unnecessary. &quot; Montebello ' s most pressing problem is finding $ 25 million for a six-month note , due Dec . 30 and secured by city tax_revenue . The city floated the bond specifically to invest in the Orange County pool and was counting_on withdrawing money from the fund to cover the debt . The city ' s stake in the Orange County pool is bigger than its operating budget_for the entire fiscal_year and represents 60 % of the city ' s total investment portfolio . The city was projecting $ 1.9 million in earnings this year from the Orange County fund , with half payable this week . But that revenue now appears in jeopardy . City officials said they are &quot; making every attempt &quot; to prod Orange County into releasing at least some of the city ' s investment fund . &quot; They ' re aware of our immediate cash-flow needs , but they haven ' t really said very much , &quot; Torres said . Weber and Lynch reported from Orange County ; Craft reported from Sacramento . Times staff writers Ken Ellingwood , Susan Marquez Owen , Greg Hernandez and Michael A . Hiltzik also contributed to this report , as did Times Sacramento bureau chief George Skelton . * BANKRUPTCY COVERAGE : Related Orange County stories inside . A3 , A22 Deadlines Looming A number of Orange County governmental agencies face imminent deadlines for making payments on their debt but may have trouble because money is tied_up in the county investment fund .
