   <HEADLINE> DESPITE GAINS , LATINO VOTERS STILL LACK CLOUT ; ELECTION : MYRIAD REASONS ACCOUNT FOR POOR TURNOUT . ' THIS IS MORE THAN A WAKE-UP CALL , ' ONE POLITICIAN SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Thomas Garcia of East Los Angeles saw no point in voting on Election_Day , even though he bitterly opposed Proposition 187 . &quot; I ' ve been in this country more_than 40 years , and I ' ve never seen Mexicans win a battle , &quot; said Garcia , 53 , who was born in Mexico but became a U.S. citizen as a teen-ager . &quot; You don ' t get what you want. &quot; Aida Cruz , 42 , of Downey said that despite concerns that the initiative -- which denies most health , education and welfare benefits to illegal immigrants -- would hurt children , she could not find time to register to vote . &quot; that ' s sad , &quot; she said . &quot; Including myself , we ' re not doing enough. &quot; But Hector Garcia , 35 , who grew_up in Los Angeles and now lives_in Chino , made_sure he cast a ballot regardless of his criticisms of the political process . &quot; There ' s that point that the one vote makes a difference , &quot; he said . Despite strong feelings in the Latino community over Proposition 187 , and the community ' s rapidly growing numbers , Latinos accounted_for only about 8 % of the state ' s voters in the Nov . 8 election , the Los Angeles Times exit poll shows . Latinos make_up 27 % of the state population but account_for 14 % of eligible voters . &quot; Somebody just ought to say that Latinos didn ' t vote , &quot; said state Sen . Art Torres ( D-Los Angeles ) , who gave_up his seat in a losing bid to become state insurance commissioner . &quot; The sleeping giant was in a coma on Nov . 8 , &quot; Torres said . &quot; Maybe we need to institute a code blue to get_it moving . Because this is more_than just a wake-up call. &quot; There are myriad reasons for low voting levels . Latino leaders have long cited statistics that nearly two-thirds of California Latinos are non-citizens or not old enough to vote . &quot; that ' s a grim reality of Latino politics in this state , &quot; said Harry Pachon , president of the Tomas Rivera Center , a Latino research institution affiliated with the Claremont Colleges . Poverty and lower levels of education also have an adverse impact -- as they do on voting levels in_general . Another longstanding barrier to increased Latino political clout has been the reluctance of Mexican immigrants to become citizens . Latinos do not stand alone in their struggle for electoral power . Political empowerment of ethnic and racial minorities in this country has taken generations in many cases . And Latinos lack some of the systems that aided other groups : the grass-roots activism of African American churches or the benefit of old-style political_machines that greeted European immigrants at the docks . But Proposition 187 -- attacked by its opponents as anti-Latino -- was expected to rouse Latinos like no issue since the Chicano power movement of the late 1960s , drawing big numbers not just into the streets but to the polls . Yet , the Latino share of the vote did not increase from the two prior elections , according to the exit poll . &quot; I don ' t think anyone went_out and tried to mobilize the Latino electorate except very late in the campaign , and maybe even past the deadline dates for registering people to vote , &quot; said Luis R . Fraga , director of Stanford_University ' s Center for Chicano Research . In Los Angeles County , where Latinos make_up about 37 % of the population , they accounted_for only about 9 % of the voters , according to the exit poll . While the Latino share of the vote has remained static since at least 1990 , Latinos have gained important positions in business and politics . That is partly due_to coalition-building , court rulings that produced affirmative_action , and the federal Voting_Rights Act , which requires Latino-majority districts to be drawn based on all residents , not just citizens . &quot; There has been so_much talk_about the electoral breakthrough of Latinos , &quot; said Steven Erie , a UC San Diego political_scientist who has written extensively about ethnic politics . &quot; Where they have been less successful is grass-roots , bottom-up empowerment , such_as citizenship , registration and voting. &quot; However , Latino activists say that Latinos did , in fact , turn_out in higher numbers in this election . But , they assert , so did non-Latinos -- especially non-Latino whites -- canceling_out any gain in Latino voting clout . Nonetheless , the potential impact of a unified voter_turnout was apparent . Latinos played a pivotal role in the close U.S. Senate_race won by Dianne Feinstein . According to The Times ' exit poll , Latinos voted 67 % to 22 % for Democrat Feinstein over Republican Michael Huffington , who , like Gov . Pete Wilson , embraced Proposition 187 . Latinos were the only ethnic_group to increase their support of Feinstein from her last bid in 1992 . &quot; Latinos were out voting , &quot; said state Sen . Richard Polanco ( D-Los Angeles ) . &quot; But non-Latino voters also came_out to vote_in higher numbers than usual. &quot; Antonio Gonzalez , president of the Southwest Voter Research Institute , said his organization is still assessing turnout . But he believes based on a sampling of 40 Latino precincts throughout the state that 45 % to 52 % of registered Latino voters cast ballots -- &quot; a dramatic improvement &quot; from the 39 % turnout in 1990 . He also contends that Latinos accounted_for 10.2 % to 11.4 % of the total vote . &quot; Compared to 1990 , there are 300 # 000 more Latino registered voters , &quot; said Gonzalez , who is also president of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project , which spent $ 100 # 000 this year on registration and get-out-the-vote efforts in nine California counties . &quot; We reached 1 # 750 , 000 this year . We were 1 # 450 , 000 in 1990. &quot; And some were encouraged by the turnout and stepped-up efforts to encourage Latino residents to vote . &quot; It might not look_like that much but it ' s more , &quot; said Father Pedro Villarroya , director of the Office of Hispanic Ministry for the Archdiocese of Los Angeles . &quot; We wish we had the resources to concentrate_on more people. &quot; It remains to be seen whether a disillusioned Latino community buys the notion that things are getting_better , given the Election_Day results . &quot; It ' s clear to me that there ' s a lot of work to be done_in the Latino community , &quot; said Cruz Reynoso , a former state Supreme Court justice who now teaches law at UCLA . The explanations that actual participation has increased do not &quot; answer the question of why there was not a disproportionately higher number of Latinos voting because this was obviously a stronger issue for Latinos than it was for many others. &quot; Increasing the proportion of the vote is key to political empowerment , experts say . &quot; The way Latinos increase their clout is for their share of the electorate to rise , &quot; said John Brennan , director of the Times Poll . &quot; When that happens , people like Pete Wilson are going_to get nervous. &quot; The exit poll showed considerable support for Proposition 187 among most voting groups -- with Latinos being an exception , opposing it 77 % to 23 % . Its strongest backers were whites , about two-thirds of whom said they voted for the measure . Latino activists and political scholars agree that even if more Latinos went_to the polls , it would not have overcome that level of support for the proposition . But the larger issues remain . And some working-class Latinos blamed leaders of the community , saying the push against Proposition 187 was misguided and confusing . Salvador Rodriguez , 44 , a security_guard at Paragraff Clothing Co . in South-Central Los Angeles , said some of his elderly Latino neighbors voted_in favor of Proposition 187 because they feared their Social_Security benefits would be used to cover services for illegal immigrants . &quot; ' We ' ve worked all our lives . How are we going_to survive if they take_away our Social_Security ? ' &quot; Rodriguez , a legal resident from Mexico who lives near the clothing_store , recalled his neighbors saying in Spanish . &quot; That was their fear. &quot; Rodriguez said the issue was too controversial for some of his other acquaintances , who decided not to take one side or the other . &quot; They thought it was better to stay in the middle , &quot; he said . Ivonne Crescioni , 36 , of Whittier said she voted , but that many of her friends did not . &quot; They don ' t believe_in the system . They can ' t relate to the candidates , even the Latino candidates , &quot; Crescioni said . &quot; Many of these Latinos were also buying_into the white argument about illegal immigrants taking all_the jobs and services . It ' s really sad that they believed that. &quot; Hector Garcia , who manages an auto parts store on South Vermont Avenue , said about 80 % of his customers are Latino but it did not seem as though many of them were wrapped_up in any &quot; movement &quot; involving Proposition 187 leading_up to Election_Day . &quot; No one was talking_about it , &quot; he said . &quot; The message never got home the way it should have . I just don ' t think the community got_behind it. &quot; Garcia said there are plenty of polling_places in Latino neighborhoods , but too few residents are convinced by politicians that there is good reason to vote . The politicians are &quot; not true leaders . They ' re not out_in the communities , &quot; he said . &quot; I think people don ' t think that their one vote would make a difference . We talk_about voting for four months but for ( the time in between elections ) nobody talks_about it. &quot; But County Supervisor Gloria Molina said leaders consciously chose not to target the Latino community exclusively . &quot; The campaign was being directed at the California voter . . . to the Reseda housewife , to the Fullerton elderly couple , &quot; she said . &quot; There was no doubt that the end result and the implications and probably some of the hatred was directed at the Latino community . But the Latino community in and of itself never could have changed the outcome. &quot; Still , political analysts say the anti-Proposition 187 campaign simply may have caught_fire too late . &quot; The opposition began to reach critical mass after the close of registration , &quot; said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe , senior associate at the Center for Politics and Economics at the Claremont Graduate_School . &quot; Many Latinos became motivated but too late to have that motivation translated into voting in this election. &quot; Rep . Xavier Becerra ( D-Los Angeles ) said the anti-Proposition 187 campaign was crippled by Wilson ' s TV ads that hammered the pro-Proposition 187 message home over and over . &quot; We didn ' t have the money at the end to combat the governor and his commercials . Who would have known that the governor would have so attached himself to 187 on television ? That really hurt. &quot; Latino activists offered mixed opinions on the get-out-the-vote effort . Democratic Party officials and Latino leaders said that an intense effort was conducted , including calling voters . But Roberto Lovato , executive_director of the Central_American Resource Center , said that commitments made by the Democratic Party to get_out the Latino vote never materialized , at least not in his neighborhood . &quot; In Pico-Union there was nothing , &quot; Lovato said . He said that among Latino leaders , efforts to get_out the vote ranged from &quot; those who did a lot . . . to those that did nothing. &quot; &quot; They know who they are , &quot; he said , declining to give names . &quot; And their consciences know what the results are . They have to live with it. &quot; Even when Latinos reached the polls , they did not automatically vote against Proposition 187 . Art Alvarez , 28 , of Alhambra voted for the initiative despite the objections of his close friend , Arturo Escandon , 25 , of El Monte . Alvarez , who was born in Los Angeles after his parents moved to the United States from Peru , said too many illegal immigrants take_advantage of public_services . Escandon , born in Mexico , is a legal resident without voting_rights who hopes to become a citizen in time for the next presidential election . &quot; Everything is done with false identifications , &quot; Alvarez said . &quot; I pay taxes. &quot; Escandon , a political_science major at UCLA , said the initiative and proposals like the one that would institute a national identification card would inevitably result in the harassment of Latinos and other people_of_color . &quot; Why should ( a Latino child ) go_through it if a little white kid doesn ' t , &quot; he said . The major barrier to boosting the Latino share of the total vote comes long before Election_Day or voter registration deadlines : Latino scholar Pachon estimates that there are at least 2 million Latinos in California who are legal immigrants eligible for citizenship but have not applied . Bruce Cain , associate director of the Institute of Governmental Studies at UC Berkeley , said the citizenship rate among Mexican immigrants is comparable_to that for Canadian immigrants . But , he said , &quot; Nobody is indignant about the Canadians who are taking_up our seats at Kings games and are equally reluctant about becoming Americans . that ' s where the racist component enters in. &quot; Traditionally , officials have explained that Mexican citizens are wary of renouncing their homeland , often clinging_to an illusion : a dream of going_back , even after their lives take_root and children are born in the United States . But others see low sign-up rates as a product of a confusing , costly and often intimidating citizenship application process . The reluctance among many to apply for citizenship also stems in part from apprehensions based on both fact and fiction . Some fear a loss of land ownership and other rights back home if they acquire U.S. passports -- and , indeed , Mexico , South_Korea and other nations limit the ownership rights of non-citizens . Ironically , many Latinos remain undecided about citizenship despite difficult lives that they expect only to worsen under Proposition 187 . Duilio Franco , 39 , of Norwalk , said he fled the war in Nicaragua several years ago with his family thinking life in the United States would be much better . But life , even as a legal resident , has been a struggle because jobs are difficult to find , Franco said . Franco , whose three teen-agers attend local schools , said he believes the biggest reason for the approval of Proposition 187 was racism . &quot; This country is made of immigrants . The only ones who are pure are the Native_Americans , &quot; he said in Spanish . &quot; The only thing you can do is go_back to your country and die rather than die here like a dog. &quot; Nonetheless , Latino activists say they believe Proposition 187 will spur greater Latino political participation , including boosting citizenship efforts . &quot; I think 187 has demonstrated to Salvadorans , Guatemalans , Central_Americans , Mexicans and other Latinos that we ' ve got_to vote because they ' re willing to go this far with our community and try to get_away with it , &quot; Lovato said . The payoff is a distant one for many . Immigrants must live_in the country five years before applying for citizenship and the application process takes about a year , sometimes longer . It was not always that way . Early on , political_machines integrated immigrants into the political_system at a pace unimaginable in contemporary terms . &quot; As the_Irish came_in , the ward boss was_on their doorstep , ' Welcome to America , we ' re gonna get you a job , here ' s some food , you need some coal , call me , ' &quot; Jeffe said . &quot; There was an immediate identification , not so_much with government but with politics . . . . that ' s why the first wave of immigrants became active quickly. &quot; However , it took time for other immigrants -- such_as the Italians and Jews -- to gain political power . &quot; By the time the Jews and Italians came_around , the_Irish machines had pretty much controlled power in the Northeast &quot; ( from the 1840s to 1870s ) , said historian Erie . &quot; The other groups had to fight their way in . This is the politics of ethnic succession . Frequently a group has to rely_on a self-help strategy. &quot; Experts believe that Latinos will become a larger share of the electorate -- in time . Latino activists are aggressively promoting citizenship , and immigration authorities report receiving 1 # 000 applications a month in Los Angeles , double the usual number . &quot; As the population goes above the age of 18 , you ' re going to see in the next five to 10 years a real increase in the number of Latino voters , &quot; Erie said . Former Justice Reynoso said he would like to see the voter registration period -- which now closes 30 days before the election -- extended right up_to Election_Day . He also favors the motor-voter registration law , which requires the state by Jan . 1 to begin providing voter registration material to driver ' s license applicants . But Wilson has ordered his Administration not to implement the law unless Congress forwards the money to pay_for the program . &quot; The wake-up call was loud and clear , &quot; Pachon said . &quot; The giant isn ' t so_much sleeping . It ' s a teen-ager that ' s growing_into adulthood . . . . People expect a magic transformation of a powerless community into a full-fledged powerful community , and it doesn ' t happen that way. &quot; Latino Voting Latinos , who make_up about 27 % of the state ' s population , accounted_for about 8 % of the voters in the Nov . 8 election , despite strong feelings in the community over Proposition 187 , the Los Angeles Times exit poll found . Here is how Latinos compare to other ethnic_groups in California . 05 # 32 , 07 # 07 , 08 # 07 WHITE BLACK LATINO ASIAN Eligible voters * 71 % 8 % 14 % 6 % Registered voters * 88 % 6 % 11 % n.a.
