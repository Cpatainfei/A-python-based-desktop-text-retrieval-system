   <TEXT> WORLD PRESS PHOTO : 1994 supervising editor Kari Lundelin ( Thames &amp; Hudson : $ 19.95 ; 132 pp. , paperback original ) . The World Press Photo Foundation was established in 1955 to provide an international forum for news photographers . The winners of their annual contest offer a depressing look_at the state of the world : violence in the former Yugoslavia , Somalia , Russia and Afghanistan ; floods and drug_abuse in the United States ; children suffering from diseases caused by the Chernobyl disaster . These dramatic photographs also prove that still images retain a special power that is very different from television_news videos .</TEXT>
