   <HEADLINE> JAPAN PREMIER ADVOCATES MORE ' CARING ' NATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister Tomiichi Murayama urged Japan &quot; not to be a powerful country but a caring country &quot; in an inaugural speech Monday that aimed to back_away from moves to increase this nation ' s military muscle . Murayama , the Socialist_Party chairman who was elected prime_minister June 29 in a shotgun marriage with the conservative Liberal Democrats , also reaffirmed the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty in language stronger than his party has ever used . The Socialists had long opposed the treaty until a_few years ago . In his address to the lower house of Parliament , Murayama sidestepped the delicate question of whether he believes Japan ' s Self-Defense Forces are constitutional . But in separate remarks later Monday , he said he had asked his party to overcome its 50-year opposition to the nation ' s military_forces and officially recognize them as legal . Although his party deputy , Wataru Kubo , declared on a weekend news_show that the Socialists are ready to make the policy turnabout and change their platform , the party has not formally decided to do so . A decision to overturn a position that has largely defined the Socialists for almost five decades could force several of the leftist members to quit the party . The military_issue is likely to be the focal_point of the opposition ' s harsh grilling of Murayama in parliamentary questioning that begins Wednesday . It will be the first time he will be forced to explain to his former political allies how he could abandon party principles and join his erstwhile rivals , the Liberal Democrats , in what the press here is calling an &quot; illicit union. &quot; Murayama , for instance , pledged in his speech that his government would &quot; firmly maintain &quot; the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty . But the Socialists had refused to accept that strong phrase when it was allied_with the previous coalition government , complained its former prime_minister , Tsutomu Hata . As with most inaugural speeches , Murayama was short on specifics . He pledged to do his best to enact tax reform by year ' s end but gave no clue about how to raise the revenue needed to finance more tax cuts . He announced he would draw_up a &quot; five-year deregulation plan &quot; but gave no details . Murayama reaffirmed his government ' s intent to finalize legislation that would redraw electoral districts and hold elections under the new blueprint . He said he would sponsor new measures to crack_down on political corruption . He indicated that the government would slow its drive to win a permanent seat on the U.N. Security_Council . Key members of the Murayama Cabinet , such_as Finance_Minister Masayoshi Takemura of the New Party Harbinger , oppose Japan ' s membership . But Murayama ' s buzzwords of the day were &quot; a caring government &quot; and &quot; a government you can feel at_ease with. &quot; The phrases were interpreted as blows against political rival Ichiro Ozawa ' s aim to make Japan a &quot; normal nation &quot; more willing to dispatch military_forces to global hot spots in cooperation with the United Nations .</TEXT>
