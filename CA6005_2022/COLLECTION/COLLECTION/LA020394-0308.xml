   <HEADLINE> O.C. CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION ASSAILS CLINTON ; REACTION : DORNAN IS HARSHEST CRITIC OF MOVE TOWARD NORMAL RELATIONS . BUT FERGUSON WELCOMES IT , SAYING CAPITALISM WILL HELP .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton ' s apparent decision to lift the trade_embargo against Vietnam was harshly protested and ridiculed Wednesday by most of Orange County ' s Republican congressmen , who claimed Clinton is forsaking the families of missing American servicemen and the campaign for human_rights in Vietnam . While California businesses are considered best positioned for renewed trade with Vietnam , members of the local congressional delegation said the Administration is bowing to business interests and should not lift the sanctions until the POW / MIA issue is resolved and democratic rights are restored in that country . Rep . Robert K . Dornan ( R-Garden Grove ) , who has previously assailed Clinton for avoiding the draft during the Vietnam_War , said : &quot; We know Clinton was missing from Vietnam , but we need to find_out what happened to the others who were actually there. &quot; A strong counterpoint came from state Assemblyman Gil Ferguson ( R-Newport Beach ) , a former Marine Corps lieutenant_colonel who served three tours in Vietnam , and one who welcomes signs of a complete thaw in relations . Ferguson noted that capitalism would do what guns and bullets couldn ' t . &quot; Coca-Cola is much more effective than an AK-47 , &quot; Ferguson said . &quot; When people get a taste of our good materialistic life , they don ' t want to fight. &quot; Although he sees the nagging MIA issue as &quot; a drawback &quot; in the quest_for normalization , Ferguson said the public must recognize that soldiers have been left missing in action from all wars . &quot; Things are different today , &quot; Ferguson said . &quot; We didn ' t have this outcry when the North_Koreans did almost the same things . They killed them , they hid them . We never knew what happened to many of our soldiers . This happens in every war. &quot; Of the five out of six Orange County congressmen who commented on the expected reconciliation with Vietnam , Rep . Ron Packard ( R-Carlsbad ) was the least critical . He said that while lifting the trade_embargo should be accompanied by human_rights guarantees , he expected that free_trade would speed_up the release of information on the POW / MIA issue . &quot; I just returned from a rather extensive trip to China and I got the feeling that the more presence the U.S. has there , the more able we would be to encourage human_rights in that country . I think the same thing applies to Vietnam . I don ' t think it ' s a good tactic to keep the embargo in place , &quot; Packard said . But the general criticism from Orange County ' s congressmen seemed to conflict with their own party ' s leadership . House Minority_Leader Robert H . Michel ( R-Ill. ) strongly favored easing the trade restrictions , saying , &quot; We ought to look . . . at the potential market . To delay and delay and delay , we ' re simply going_to be preempted by others. &quot; Meanwhile , Dornan , who is president of the American chapter of the International Committee for a Free Vietnam , reiterated his opposition Wednesday in a letter to the White_House , in which he stated that the embargo &quot; has yielded cooperation and information that otherwise we would not have attained. &quot; Other local representatives agreed the embargo is the best tool the United States has to pressure the Vietnamese government to provide POW / MIA information and the political guarantees the United States is seeking . &quot; At the very least , we should try to make free elections a provision &quot; before lifting the embargo , said Rep . Ed Royce ( R-Fullerton ) , a member of the House Asian and Pacific Affairs Committee . The decision to resume trade with Vietnam before missing U.S. servicemen are accounted_for is &quot; totally premature , &quot; said Rep . Dana Rohrabacher ( R-Huntington Beach ) . &quot; There ' s a lot of information that needs to be released . They have not , for example , provided the records from the prisons in which our own prisoners were kept. &quot; Rohrabacher said the Clinton_Administration should also force the Vietnamese government to release its own political_prisoners before the trade restrictions are lifted . Rep . Christopher Cox ( R-Newport Beach ) said that while the move will create new business ventures for American firms , including many in California , the United States will have many opportunities to trade with Vietnam , but only this one chance to strike a good_deal to achieve more freedom for the Vietnamese people . Cox cited recent studies showing that Vietnam is one of the world ' s worst violators of human_rights . &quot; The reversal ( in America ' s policy toward Vietnam ) is essentially free to the government of Vietnam . They have not even been asked to change their human_rights policy . We are simply ignoring the human_rights dimension of a healthy foreign_policy , &quot; Cox said . Of the six congressmen who represent Orange County , only Rep . Jay C . Kim ( R-Diamond Bar ) did not respond to a request for comment . The President ' s message to the veterans ' groups and the Vietnamese-American community , Dornan claimed , is , &quot; Drop_dead ! &quot; &quot; Bill_Clinton was wrong about Vietnam in 1969 , and he ' s wrong about Vietnam now , &quot; Dornan said . &quot; I guess Clinton still whistles to himself ' Ho , Ho , Ho Chi Minh. ' &quot; Cox also said that by initiating free_trade with Vietnam , &quot; the Clinton_Administration has seemingly turned a deaf ear to the concerns of California ' s Vietnamese community. &quot; Proponents of the trade agreement argue that in addition to new business opportunities , America needs to close the book on its involvement in the war that caused bitterness at_home and abroad . &quot; It ' s time for us to close this chapter in American history and in America ' s relations with Vietnam , no doubt about it , &quot; Rohrabacher said . &quot; But before you close this chapter , we have to write the final paragraphs , and the Vietnamese are withholding information. &quot; Times staff writer Eric Bailey contributed to this report .</TEXT>
