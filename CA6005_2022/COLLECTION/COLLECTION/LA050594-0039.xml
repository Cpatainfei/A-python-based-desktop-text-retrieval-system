   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS : LANE VICTORY UPDATE ; D-DAY SHIP BREAKS_DOWN NEAR ACAPULCO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Five days after leaving Los Angeles on a 9 # 000-mile voyage to England , the restored World_War_II cargo_ship Lane Victory and its crew of retired merchant seamen has been stalled near Acapulco , Mexico , by a malfunctioning boiler . But the ship ' s 54 volunteer crew_members , whose average age is 68 , hope that the ship will be able to make_it to ceremonies June 6 marking the 50th anniversary of the D-day invasion on the Normandy coast of France . &quot; The prognosis is good , &quot; said Bob Lace , treasurer of the San Pedro-based Merchant_Marine Veterans of World_War_II , which owns the 455-foot ship . Lace said radio reports from the ship indicated that oil had leaked into one of the ship ' s two boilers . Although the leak was repaired at_sea , the boiler has to be cleaned_out with chemicals that are available only in port . Wednesday morning the Lane Victory was 60 miles outside Acapulco , Lace said , and was limping toward the port on one boiler at a speed of 5 knots , one-third its usual cruising speed . If the contaminated boiler can be cleaned in Acapulco , the ship could resume its voyage in a_few days , Lace said . The veterans group , which rescued the Lane Victory from mothballs in 1988 and spent years renovating it , has invested countless hours and hundreds of thousands of dollars preparing it for the D-day trip . After numerous delays , the ship steamed out of Los Angeles Harbor on Friday while hundreds of well-wishers staged a wharf-side bon_voyage party . GORDON DILLOW</TEXT>
