   <HEADLINE> EARTHQUAKE : THE LONG ROAD BACK ; FOOD_STAMP CHEATERS ANGER THOSE IN NEED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Because of the food_stamp cheats , Lydia Sanchez and her four children have survived on food donated by local churches while waiting in long lines for food_stamps to be issued . Outside the Panorama City welfare office Monday , Sanchez and about 1 # 500 other earthquake victims -- many without food or a place to sleep -- were told by county employees using bullhorns to communicate in Spanish , English and Armenian that there was now a waiting period . The cheats , they told those in the crowd , beat them to their food_stamps last week . Thousands of people who suffered losses in the quake were granted emergency food vouchers the day they applied last week . But because of suspicions that many of the applications were fraudulent , a 72-hour waiting period was instituted to give county workers time to verify claims . &quot; Everyone who was doing wrong got what they wanted , and now the ones who are honest and really need it have to wait for three days , &quot; said Sanchez , of North Hollywood . Sanchez was among many in_line Monday who were frustrated because they had waited in_line last week , they were waiting again this week and , after filling_out their applications , they will wait three more days for their vouchers . She waited in_line all day last Tuesday with her children without obtaining any vouchers . Maurice Carter , who applied for food_stamps for the first time on Monday , is living_in a friend ' s motor_home . His Van Nuys apartment was condemned after the earthquake and he lost his job as a customer service worker when his work site was heavily damaged . He blamed government officials for failing to prevent the fraud last week . &quot; Isn ' t that what computers are for ? &quot; Carter said . &quot; It seems to me that the government ought to be able to check people pretty quickly. &quot; County officials say they are now vigorously pursuing food-stamp cheats and one suspect was arraigned Monday in federal_court . Four other suspects are scheduled to be arraigned today . Several people in_line Monday said some ineligible people were circumventing the application process by buying others ' food_stamp vouchers . Tricia Hendrix of Van Nuys said a man offered her a voucher for $ 20 . &quot; Most people in_line have been very understanding , &quot; said Bryce Yokomizo , East Valley District director for the Los Angeles County Department of Social_Services . &quot; But many of the people in_line have been complaining about those who abuse the system. &quot; However , Angel Pastrana of Northridge , an unemployed father of six , said he was sickened by the fraud . &quot; I ' ve never had to depend_on the state for anything until now , and I ' m proud_of that , &quot; he said . &quot; Don ' t these people have any pride ? How could they take handouts from the state when they don ' t need them ? &quot; More_than 3 # 000 people also waited in_line at Dodger Stadium Monday , one of four large processing centers county officials opened in the hopes of avoiding the mass confusion of last week . There were extremely long lines last week at the 29 county welfare offices and numerous tales of abuse as about 50 # 000 people applied for the emergency food vouchers . This week , county officials tried to rectify the situation by establishing centralized application centers and steering applicants away from some of the overburdened county welfare offices . And by verifying claims , officials hoped to keep the cheats away . Although people still waited at Dodger Stadium and other sites on Monday , the processing program had fewer hitches than last week . The lines at the large centers moved quicker , there were more employees to handle the paperwork and there was a large police presence to keep order . But there are still glitches that need to be addressed , said Lew Hollman , an attorney for San Fernando Valley Neighborhood Legal Services . The elderly and disabled are forced to wait in long lines , in the hot sun , and the county has made no special provisions for them . And , he said , none of those who filled_out the food_stamp forms were given any paperwork to verify that they had applied . &quot; This could lead to major problems , &quot; Hollman said . &quot; If 1 # 000 applications are lost , what happens to those people . Does that mean they ' ve lost the chance to obtain any food_stamps ? &quot; Within 72 hours of making a claim , applicants are supposed to be notified by mail that they can pick_up their vouchers , which are provided through a U . S . Department_of_Agriculture program that is being managed by Los Angeles County . Now there are a number of precautions officials are taking_to prevent fraud . Every application will be cross-checked by the county ' s central computer_system , said Mike Collins , a division chief for the county Department of Public Social_Services . If people attempt to apply for the emergency food vouchers a second time or if they claim more dependents than the last time they applied for county benefits , their cases will be referred to fraud investigators .</TEXT>
