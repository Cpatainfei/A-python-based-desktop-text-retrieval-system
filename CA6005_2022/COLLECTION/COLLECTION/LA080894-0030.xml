   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENTERPRISE ; THANKS TO GOLFERS ' WILD SHOTS , THIS FIRM IS DIVING FOR DOLLARS ; RECREATION : RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA-BASED BALL_HAWK FETCHES $ 900 # 000 A YEAR RETRIEVING LOST GOLF_BALLS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As a boy , Larry Margison used to sneak into the Meadowlark Golf_Course in Huntington Beach at dusk , wade into the shallow ponds and pick_up golf_balls with his toes . Often the superintendent shooed him away , but Margison always returned and became so proficient that the golf_course finally gave him a deal : a quarter a ball . Now 41 , Margison still retrieves wet golf_balls . And he still gets_about a quarter apiece for them . But today , his company , Ball_Hawk in Rancho Santa Margarita , employs seven scuba_divers who mine the water hazards at 80 golf_courses from Tijuana to Utah , picking_up most of the 3.5 million golf_balls a year that Margison resells . That translates into a $ 900 # 000-a-year business , making Ball_Hawk the largest company of its kind on the West Coast . &quot; I had a natural talent for pulling them out of the water , &quot; Margison says , showing that he can still scoop_up golf_balls with his size-12 foot faster than most people would be able to bend over and grab them by hand . Margison ' s firm actually retrieves about 2.5 million golf_balls a year and buys 1 million more from other dealers . Ball_Hawk then cleans and resells the balls for as much as $ 1.50 each . Many are sold to golf_courses at discounts , and the balls often wind_up for_sale in fishbowl containers at pro shops , where they ' ll be bought , hit and most likely dropped into the water again . &quot; People don ' t own golf_balls , they just borrow them for a period_of_time , &quot; says Mitchell Lombard , president of Gold Eagle in Dallas , which processes about 50 million balls a year and is the nation ' s largest golf_ball retrieval company . No one knows how many ball retrieval firms there are . Some golf_courses clean the ponds themselves , and nighttime poachers take_away a huge chunk of business from tax-paying entrepreneurs like Margison , who figures that illegitimate traders cut his revenue by 25 % . Margison ' s company formally began in 1972 , when he was 19 , just married and playing golf for Golden West Junior_College in Huntington Beach . He started with contracts from three golf_courses : Anaheim , Costa Mesa and Sea Cliff . That year , Margison grossed about $ 18 # 000 -- picking_up all_the balls himself with a rake , his hands and his toes . Margison ' s business has boomed with the mushrooming of golf_courses -- about one a day nationwide in recent years -- and the growing popularity of the sport . &quot; The average golfer could lose three or four balls per round , &quot; said Marv Kilburg , a marshal at Cypress Golf_Club , which opened in the summer of 1992 . For Ball_Hawk , which has a contract at Cypress , that means a take of 4 # 000 to 5 # 000 balls a week . When he can , Margison retrieves balls with a $ 10 # 000 rolling machine that sweeps a lake_bottom like a lawn_mower , sucking_up golf_balls between its aluminum blades . But machinery won ' t work in most golf_course lakes because they have fountains , pipes or plastic linings at the bottom . At the Cypress golf_course , for example , bubbling fountains shoot out from a 75-yard-long pond that skirts the par-four No . 8 hole . Vince Maxwell , outfitted in wet suit and turquoise face_mask , usually spends a_couple_of hours a week in the murky lake , groping_for balls barehanded . His average find is about 900 balls , for which he receives seven cents apiece , or about $ 63 . &quot; This is one of the better holes , &quot; Maxwell said last week as he came_up for air . Ball_Hawk ' s divers , who are independent contractors , make between $ 25 # 000 and $ 40 # 000 a year , the company says . &quot; The money ' s pretty good , &quot; Maxwell said . &quot; It ' s interesting . We ' ve come_across lawn_chairs , bicycles and golf_clubs once in a while. &quot; Unlike Texas or Florida , where divers can run_up against alligators , Maxwell says the worst creatures found here are crawdads or big fish . &quot; The other day at_Sea Cliff , &quot; he said , &quot; a two-foot catfish kept bumping_into me. &quot; At the end of the day , divers like Maxwell dump the balls into banana boxes and drop them off at Margison ' s production facility in Rancho Santa Margarita . There the balls are cleaned and sorted by grade , like lemons . Margison says only 20 % of the balls retrieved are in the top condition needed to be resold to pro shops . The rest are usually marketed to driving-range operators or firms that condition used golf_balls . Margison also runs his own retail shop near Tijeras Creek Golf_Course in Rancho Santa Margarita , selling top-of-the-line used Titleist and Ultra balls for as much as $ 1.50 each -- about $ 1 less than what they cost new . Those balls provide the best profit_margins for Ball_Hawk , and Margison ' s hope is to open a similar store in Palm Springs . Margison likens his best used balls to cars with a_couple_of thousand miles on them . &quot; They ' re not brand new , &quot; he said , &quot; but pretty close. &quot;</TEXT>
