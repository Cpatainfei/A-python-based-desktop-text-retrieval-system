   <HEADLINE> CHANGING LIFESTYLES ; TIBET ; CHINESE ARE REWEAVING THE REGION ' S SOCIAL FABRIC</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Sonam is a tall , handsome , 34-year-old taxi driver who worships both Buddha and Rambo , oblivious to any contradictions that might imply . Jigme is a 44-year-old carpenter , rebuilding a famous Buddhist monastery that was destroyed during China ' s 10-year Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that sent rampaging Red Guards into the four corners of Tibet . He says that Tibet is better_off today than it was 40 years ago , but adds that there are too many Han Chinese migrants here , threatening to reverse the gains . Ngawang is an aristocratic Tibetan physician , daughter of a high-ranking rinpoche -- or reincarnated Buddhist teacher -- who hides her fluency in Chinese and worries about Tibet ' s lack of &quot; environmental consciousness. &quot; Yu , 28 , is a successful Chinese businessman and haughty colonist from the &quot; Middle Kingdom. &quot; As we dance one evening in the fancy Sunlight Nightclub he whispers : &quot; The Tibetans are very stupid . This place is a primitive society that still needs to be developed . We have to train the Tibetans. &quot; These were some of the characters I encountered on a recent four-week journey through Tibet with an American photographer . Since anti-Chinese riots broke_out in Lhasa , the Tibetan capital , in 1987 , foreign journalists have been severely restricted in their travels_to Tibet . As a prospective graduate_student in forestry at Yale_University , I ' m not precisely a journalist . And my fluency in Chinese allowed me to leap many of the hurdles set_up by the Chinese government . The result was a rare , unobstructed view into a land that for many years has been the focus of a propaganda battleground between the Chinese government and the followers of the exiled Tibetan religious_leader , the Dalai Lama . The photographer and I flew from Beijing to Tibet , which is often called &quot; The Roof of the World &quot; because it lies on a plateau that averages more_than 13 # 000 feet above sea_level . According to the Chinese government , Tibet is a primitive land being led benevolently into the 20th Century under the astute leadership of Beijing . For the Dalai Lama and his many overseas celebrity supporters , Tibet is a land raped and sacked by Hans , China ' s ethnic majority , who invaded the country from the east in 1950 and forced the Dalai Lama to flee in 1959 . We found Tibet neither as oppressive as some human_rights organizations claim , nor as progressive as the Chinese government asserts . Many Tibetans claimed that religious rights have blossomed in recent years . Still others feel that they are being submerged by a flood of Chinese immigration . Most of the Tibetans claimed that the standard_of_living is_better now than it was before the Chinese invasion . &quot; Tibet is much better_off now than it was before the Chinese came , &quot; said Jigme , the carpenter working_on the restoration of the Tashilhunpo Monastery in Xigaze . &quot; Then , there was not one ( concrete ) multistory building , now there are many . Then we did not have enough food to eat or clothing to keep warm ; now that problem is basically solved. &quot; Then he pointed to the downside : &quot; When the Chinese first came it was good , our lives improved , but now there are more and more Chinese coming , and it is bad. &quot; According to Chinese government statistics , 95 % of Tibet ' s 2.3 million people are ethnic Tibetans , but this figure is suspect . It probably does not include the substantial Chinese military presence or Chinese living here without residence permits . In Lhasa , Chinese appear to outnumber Tibetans . The London-based Tibet Information Network quotes unofficial sources as saying only one-third of the civilians in the city are ethnic Tibetans . The influx of Chinese migrants is clearly transforming both the appearance of Lhasa and its social fabric . Traditional Tibetan-style buildings are being destroyed . Only a small section of the old city remains standing , the area around the Jokhang Temple , Tibet ' s most important religious site . While many of these old buildings are scheduled for demolition in 1995 , hundreds of craftsmen and laborers are working_on restoration of the Jokhang itself . And the temple is packed with Buddhist pilgrims every day . Nevertheless , Lhasa ' s distinctive architecture is disappearing , and it looks more and more like any other Chinese city . The view of the awesome Potala , the former winter residence of the Dalai Lama and one of Tibet ' s most important landmarks , is marred by a new pin-striped water_tower , while the street below the Potala is lined with rows of Chinese shops , restaurants , and karaoke bars . The Potala ' s interior has been cheapened with tacky chandeliers . In one Lhasa restaurant frequented by Tibetan yuppies who drive motorcycles and four-wheel-drive vehicles , a life-size poster of Michael Jackson towers over a small portrait of the Dalai Lama . Young Tibetan men who work for the Department of Foreign Economics and Trade wear black leather jackets and shiny gold jewelry , a sharp departure from the plain clothes of the countryside . Speaking in fluent Mandarin on cellular_phones , they make deals with China ' s provinces on quotas for coveted imported goods earmarked for Tibet ' s drive to modernize . The special quotas are granted under a Chinese government program that gives preferential treatment to minority and backward areas . Instead of benefiting Tibet , however , they result in profits for the young Tibetan hustlers . These Tibetans , the first generation educated under the Communist Chinese system , spend their evenings and cash_in places like the Sunlight Nightclub . Here , both Tibetan and Chinese thirtysomethings share the dance_floor . Sitting at one of the club ' s many tables , each decorated with a plastic rose illuminated by a spotlight , Yu Wenhua , a Chinese businessman who owns an electronics_company in Lhasa , took me for a spin on the dance_floor , explaining that the nightclub is similar to those in his native Jiangsu province , so it makes him a little less homesick . Tibet , said Yu , a tall , thin man in a suit and tie , has more and more of the comforts of home , but it has a long way to go . &quot; When I first came here eight years ago there was absolutely nothing , &quot; he said . &quot; There were no multistory buildings , only mud houses . There were no paved roads , only dirt and cobblestone. &quot; The biggest changes , he said , have been in the last two years , since China ' s paramount leader , Deng Xiaoping , made his now-famous trip to the south that launched the country on a development binge . &quot; Now the pace of change is growing more and more rapid , but this place is still like a primitive society . Tibet will never achieve the level of development of Jiangsu , because the people here are too stupid , &quot; Yu said . Like many other Han Chinese , dreams of wealth brought Yu to Tibet , which the Chinese call Xizang -- &quot; Western treasure house. &quot; &quot; When I was 8 years old , I was hungry , &quot; he said , pointing to his stomach . &quot; There was not enough to eat , &quot; he continued , taking a huge wad of bills out of his wallet to pay_for a round of drinks . Yu ' s secret to his success in Tibet , he explained , is a Chinese saying : &quot; The mighty dragons are no match for the native serpent , &quot; which means , he explained , &quot; that when you first come_to a new place you have to establish good relations with the locals. &quot; But there is a cost to Chinese ambitions here . For instance , the migrants and their quest_for wealth are taking a toll on Tibet ' s environment , which was pristine before the Chinese invasion . The soil is not suitable for supporting a large population . Intense cultivation and chemical fertilizers are increasing crop yields to feed the growing Han population , but these techniques are also causing desertification . The farmland in Tsang , Tibet ' s western province , is sandy , and afternoon dust_storms are so bad that most townspeople do not dare to go_out . These daily storms presage a probable dust_bowl . If it is not the winds , it is the sound of explosives . Tibetan religious_doctrine considers mining sacrilegious , but even in remote parts of the country one cannot escape the sound of blasting as workers build roads and mine Tibet ' s vast mineral wealth . More blasting is required to tunnel through Mt . Kumba La for a $ 40-million pump-storage hydroelectric station being built to meet Lhasa ' s growing energy needs . The blue-green waters of one of Tibet ' s largest lakes , Lake Yamdrok , home to a mythical dragon and teeming with aquatic life , will be pumped up Mt . Kumba La at off-peak energy demand periods , and then will be released at peak periods down a vertical drop of 8 # 400 feet to run turbines that are expected to generate 90 megawatts of power . Women in brightly colored , traditional Tibetan-style dresses with infants strapped to their backs work in the fields by the lake , as women in the area have probably done for generations . But I learned from three young boys that life along Lake Yamdrok has already started to change . The boys told me in perfect Mandarin that they wanted to be , respectively , a banker , driver and a policeman when they grew_up . They like to play TV video_games when they are not doing homework , and they want to live_in Lhasa . Ngawang , the doctor of traditional Tibetan medicine whom I met as she was making a pilgrimage to Samye , opposes the Lake Yamdrok project , but she believes that her efforts to protect Tibet ' s environment will fail . &quot; Most Tibetans have not developed an environmental consciousness , and those who do have an understanding of environmental problems have no power , &quot; she said . &quot; The cadres make all_of the decisions , and the cadres are all Han Chinese. &quot; Wearing a Western-style mountaineering jacket and a Tibetan hat , Ngawang expressed her strong concern about the Chinese educational system . &quot; My Mandarin is poor , because Tibetan parents do not want their children to learn Chinese and the Chinese ways , so they do not send them to school , &quot; said Ngawang . &quot; But we need Mandarin to survive , so it puts us in a difficult position. &quot; Indeed , more_than the extensive military presence , the educational system is China ' s most powerful tool , next to television , in submerging the Tibetan culture and diluting Tibetan nationalism . Tibetan schoolchildren see Chinese as the language of modernity ; they see Tibetan as the language of backwardness . An 8-year-old Tibetan girl I met in a restaurant , clean and well dressed with a charming smile , asked me in perfect Mandarin to sing a song in English . Then I asked her to sing . She sang a_couple_of patriotic Communist Chinese songs including , &quot; I love Beijing ' s Tian An Men Square , the sun rises over Tian An Men , the great leader Chairman Mao Tse-tung guides us forward. &quot; When I asked her to sing a Tibetan song , she refused . Sonam , our talkative driver , in contrast to Ngawang , supports the Chinese-style development of Tibet . Last year , his work_unit , which is part of the transportation department , took him on a tour of Beijing , Guangdong and Shanghai . Sonam was impressed with the modernization of these regions , especially Shanghai ' s Nanpu Bridge . He is a tall , well-built man just starting to get a pot belly . He said that he got fat when he quit smoking a_few years ago after a bout with pneumonia . The windshield and dashboard of his army green jeep are covered with stickers : &quot; No-smoking &quot; in English , &quot; Harley-Davidson &quot; and &quot; Rambo. &quot; When we were in Tibet he was taking a leave_of_absence and using his work_unit ' s jeep as a taxi to take people the 1 1 / 2-hour ride from Xigaze to Gyangze . He jumped at the chance to make a bigger profit to take us in the other direction on the old road to Lhasa , via Lake Yamdrok . Sonam ' s two sons , ages 9 and 12 , are bilingual . They are enrolled in school , and Sonam hopes that they will go_on to university . Sonam is grateful that they have the opportunity to receive an education that he never had . Born in 1960 , he did not learn about Tibetan Buddhism when he was a child , because any display of religious_belief was forbidden during the Cultural Revolution . When Deng Xiaoping took power in 1978 and restrictions on religious practice were loosened , Sonam became curious about Buddhism . &quot; At first , I was afraid of Buddha , &quot; he said . &quot; But later I learned that praying is for the peace and the good of all beings , and I was no longer afraid. &quot; Norbu is a 52-year-old craftsman who is overseeing the restoration of murals on the walls of Gyangze ' s Palkhor Chode Monastery . At the age of 9 , he began his training in painting tankas , religious scrolls . He said he was forbidden to practice his craft from 1959 until 1981 . Although there are few craftsmen left to keep_up the complex Tibetan art of painting mandalas , which are symbols of transformation through enlightenment , and tankas , which are religious scroll paintings , Norbu is confident that his disciples , along with the generation of disciples that are now being trained , will fill the gap . &quot; For more_than a generation there were no artists trained , &quot; he said , &quot; but now we are training some who are starting young enough , and they will keep the traditions alive. &quot; There is another side to the story . The government is paying Norbu to restore a monastery that the state is fixing_up as a major tourist attraction for Gyangze , where a luxury hotel has just been built . Norbu said that when all_of the work_on the monastery is finished later this year , the craftspeople will return the monastery to the country and cadres will come for a big celebration . But many of the more remote monasteries and nunneries , such_as Tidrom Nunnery , that will never be_on the route of a package tour have received no restoration funds . After four weeks ' traveling in Tibet , the most vivid impressions are of a land with startling contrasts : traditional Buddhist seminarians exist alongside hip , cellular-phone yuppies ; restoration of sacred temples is accompanied by environmental destruction on a massive scale ; the goal of universal education runs parallel to cultural alienation ; gold-plated tourist temples smack of prosperity while off the tourist track , sites such_as the Tidrom Nunnery starve for attention . Even in individual families , the divided path brought by Chinese colonization is evident . Lobsang was a little boy encountered at Ganden Monastery . A talkative 12-year-old , Lobsang said his sister attended a Chinese school and did very well , allowing her to advance to higher study at the university , something impossible to imagine in the pre-Chinese days , especially for women . Because of his sister ' s success , Lobsang said with a smile on his face , &quot; my mother is happy every day. &quot; Lobsang himself did not do_well in Chinese school but chose a path that also pleased his mother . He is in the Ganden Monastery studying to be a monk . Now , he exclaimed again , &quot; my mother is happy every day. &quot; Grinspoon has been a researcher in the Times ' Beijing Bureau .</TEXT>
