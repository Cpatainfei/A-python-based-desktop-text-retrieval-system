   <HEADLINE> PCS EVOLVING INTO INFORMATION FURNACES ; TECHNOLOGY : EXPERTS PREDICT COMPUTERS ARE EVOLVING INTO CONTROL_CENTERS , LINKING THE TELEPHONE , TV , THERMOSTAT AND OTHER HOUSEHOLD ELECTRONIC DEVICES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In the metaphor-mad world of technology , there ' s a new phrase making the rounds , one that experts believe describes the direction that personal_computers are taking . After 20 years as an independent box , the PC is evolving into a control_center that ties together the phone , TV , thermostat and other electronic_devices in every room in the house . An information furnace , they call it . &quot; It ' s equivalent_to central_heating , &quot; said Avram Miller , Intel ' s vice_president of corporate business development . &quot; This analogy with power is very good . If you look_at electricity , electricity was designed to do only one thing -- lighting . Clearly , there ' s a lot more to it than that now. &quot; Like a furnace , the PC of the future could be hidden from view , in the basement , a closet or drawer . The devices it links would take different shapes depending_on their use and location . A unit in the den might have a keyboard and screen while one in the living room might be a big screen with stereo speakers and a player for programs on compact_disc . The incorporation of telephone-answering machines into consumer PCs last summer was an early example of this trend , which will be a key topic at the annual PC Expo this week at New York ' s Jacob Javits Convention Center . Intel CEO Andrew Grove has titled his keynote_speech for the show &quot; The Ubiquitous Information Appliance. &quot; The acceleration of the trend is important for Intel to drive demand for advances in its key product -- the microprocessor or &quot; brain &quot; of a PC . Packard Bell Inc. earlier this month rolled_out PCs with built-in TV and radio_receivers as well as phone answering and fax capabilities . With them , a technician played a Bach compact_disc , the radio and TV and worked_on a word-processing program simultaneously . It ' s not just today ' s electronic items that could be hooked up but those on the drawing board of technologists and inventors . Last week , Timex Corp . and Microsoft Corp . even demonstrated a watch that can take_in messages from a computer . &quot; One of the devices that ' s interesting , we call it an I-pad , an information pad , &quot; Miller said . &quot; It would be a device that has a flat-panel screen . You can write_on it , touch it . You might be able to speak into it and it might speak back . It would be wireless , cheap and have different forms in the house. &quot; Some early forms of an &quot; I-pad &quot; are Apple Computer Inc. ' s Newton , Motorola Inc. ' s Envoy and IBM ' s Simon devices , which have both computing and communication features . &quot; You will see all kinds of combinations be possible , &quot; said Safi Qureshey , chief_executive of AST Research Inc. in Irvine . &quot; We want to provide the glue so the user can go_in between all_of these different access mechanisms. &quot; The concept of a computer_network in the home is rooted in the workplace . Portable_computers , for instance , linked to the main one in an office are allowing more people to work_at home or on_the_road . &quot; The same technologies are going_to be used in the home environment , &quot; said Alan Soucy , vice_president of mobile computers at Zenith Data Systems . &quot; They ' re going to be repackaged , more specific , more like an appliance. &quot; The vision isn ' t just Intel ' s or the computer_industry ' s . At a cable TV trade show last month , General Instrument Corp. , the leading maker of set-top channel controls , described a plan for &quot; component &quot; TVs built around a computer-like box . The monitor -- which in time will be a flat panel screen -- and game player , video recorder or telephone would all be separate pieces . &quot; Exactly how much it all gets centralized in one place , I ' m a little hard pressed to predict right now , &quot; said Jeff Roman , vice_president of technology and new business development for General Instrument . The first personal_computer sold to the general public , the Altair 8800 , appeared in Popular Electronics magazine in December , 1974 . It was a box of circuits and lights that cost about $ 250 but had no software or screen and required 50 commands , executed by flipping switches , just to get started . Today , the most popular PCs take just a_few minutes to set_up , have dozens of megabytes of software already installed , and can link through a phone_line to millions of others worldwide . Very few people anticipated the computers of today in 1974 . Even fewer know what to expect in another two decades . Something as futuristic as an information furnace , while still vague , is probably only a decade away . There is certainty in the industry only about the next year or two . &quot; It ' s not possible to conceive 20 years from now , &quot; said Intel ' s Miller . &quot; The computers of 20 years from now will probably be 10 # 000 times more powerful than they are today. &quot;</TEXT>
