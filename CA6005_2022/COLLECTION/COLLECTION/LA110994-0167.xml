   <HEADLINE> PROTEIN FOUND THAT MAY ACTIVATE AIDS VIRUS ; MEDICINE : SCIENTISTS SAY THE DISCOVERY COULD SPAWN TREATMENTS THAT WOULD PREVENT HIV-INFECTED PEOPLE FROM CONTRACTING THE FATAL DISEASE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Scientists say they have discovered a protein that may activate the AIDS virus in the body and cause it to develop_into AIDS . The discovery by University of Pennsylvania scientists could lead to treatments that might enable infected people to put the human_immunodeficiency_virus on hold indefinitely . They still would carry the virus but might not contract the fatal disease itself . HIV-infected people can be healthy and live for years before the virus attacks the body ' s immune_system . A protein isolated from a gene in HIV carriers appears to tell infected cells when to start reproducing the virus , the researchers said in an article published Tuesday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . &quot; We understand a new pathway the virus uses , &quot; study chief David Weiner , an assistant_professor of pathology and medicine at the university , said in a telephone_interview . &quot; We now have an opportunity to design drugs to inhibit it. &quot; Dr. Nava Sarver , one of the chief scientists in the AIDS division of the National Institutes of Health , said the study is interesting but very preliminary . Usually , studies such_as Weiner ' s that are conducted in the laboratory do not hold_up when tested in bodies , she said . &quot; Many other questions need to be asked to confirm these findings , &quot; Sarver said . &quot; I feel it is not right to give hope to patients who are desperate for any type of therapy. &quot; Dr. Alfred Saah , an associate_professor in the School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University , said of the findings , &quot; It ' s a hopeful sign and I think it ' s worthy of pursuit , and if it pans_out it will be quite an advance. &quot; The study centered_on one of nine known HIV genes , &quot; vpr. &quot; The gene produces a protein , known by the capitalized abbreviation &quot; Vpr , &quot; that appears to be necessary before infected cells can produce new , infected viral particles that in turn infect other cells , Weiner said . Scientists must know how the virus multiplies before they can design drugs to inhibit it , Weiner said . Weiner ' s research team found in laboratory tests that the stage of infected people ' s disease corresponds with the level of &quot; Vpr &quot; protein in their blood . People in the early stages of infection had low levels of the protein ; those with fully developed AIDS had high levels . When scientists exposed cells to the protein in the laboratory , they could turn latent infection to active infection . Weiner ' s team also found that it could block the production of new virus by exposing the cells to &quot; Vpr &quot; antibodies . He said he is trying to develop a vaccine that would create &quot; Vpr &quot; antibodies . The research is being conducted on small animals .</TEXT>
