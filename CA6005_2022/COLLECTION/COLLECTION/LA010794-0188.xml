   <HEADLINE> AN ATTORNEY TAKES_OFFICE ; NEW CHIEF WANTS BIGGER ROLE FOR U.S. PROSECUTORS IN SANTA ANA</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The gaudy brass lettering that spells_out the name of her predecessor still looms large on the wall outside the U.S. attorney ' s office here , but Jean A . Kawahara is firmly entrenched in the office he vacated . * The shelves beside her desk are packed with 26 volumes of &quot; U.S. v . Andonian , &quot; the case that consumed three years of Kawahara ' s life and became one of the nation ' s biggest money-laundering prosecutions . More_than 20 people have been convicted as a result of Operation Polar Cap , the investigation that spawned the case and which centered_on the downtown Los Angeles jewelry district . The drawers of Kawahara ' s filing_cabinets are stuffed with bank fraud and other criminal cases , past and present . And to give the office a somewhat personal touch , there are several nearby pieces of art , including a Norman Parkinson photograph and a Malaysian puppet . After less than six years as an assistant U.S. attorney in Los Angeles , Kawahara was recently named chief of the Santa Ana branch office by Nora M . Manella , the newly appointed U.S. attorney who heads the Los Angeles-based federal_district that spans seven Southern California counties . Kawahara replaces Paul Seave , the popular prosecutor who left after four years to become second in command for the U.S. attorney ' s office in Sacramento . Like Seave , Kawahara has experience in handling fraud and embezzlement cases , useful in a county that some wags have dubbed the Cote de Fraud . With the appointment , Kawahara becomes the highest ranking Asian American in the U.S. attorney ' s Los Angeles office and , at 33 , one of the youngest supervisors in a field of nearly 200 attorneys . &quot; I certainly feel lucky to be in this position , because it ' s a tremendous one , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' ve worked_on terrific cases with terrific people . Good opportunities have come my way and this is one of them. &quot; * Born in Los Angeles , Kawahara spent the first eight years of her life in Gardena before her family moved to Palos Verdes , where she attended high_school . She graduated from Brown University and got her law_degree from UC Berkeley . After 2 1 / 2 years in private practice , where she specialized in business litigation , she was hired into the U.S. attorney ' s office in Los Angeles in early 1988 . Almost immediately , she was pulled into the jewelry mart case , a complicated investigation that law_enforcement officials say spanned four years of illegal activity by jewelry companies and involved the laundering of some $ 500 million . Kawahara was the junior prosecutor in the first phase of the trial , which ended with the convictions of five defendants and guilty pleas by three others . But charges against four defendants were dismissed , and four others were acquitted , fueling criticism that the government had overcharged the case . Anna Ho , an attorney who represented a Lebanese immigrant held without bail for 22 months before being acquitted , was highly critical of the government ' s case but does not hold Kawahara responsible_for the prosecution . &quot; I have always felt the government was overzealous in prosecuting the case but I ' m not sure that she was in total control of the case , &quot; Ho said . &quot; She was a straight-shooter and did her best . She was always prepared and on the ball. &quot; A small gesture that has always stuck_with Ho was Kawahara ' s acceptance of the cookies that Ho brings_to every trial . Some prosecutors , she said , absolutely refuse to share_in the treat , believing that it will somehow compromise their objectivity . &quot; In my book , there are prosecutors and there are human_beings , &quot; Ho said . &quot; Jean is a human_being . She can treat your client as a person even if she has strong evidence against your client . And she always maintained her demeanor . There were times when you could tell she had one hour of sleep but she was always together. &quot; Ho said she did not feel the same way about Kawahara ' s fellow prosecutor in the case , Russell Hayman , and declined to comment about his performance . Kawahara remembers the case as all-consuming . And while she learned a great_deal about legal issues , investigative procedures and other experiences , she rarely had a weekend off in three years . With the verdicts reached in the jewelry mart cases in January , 1991 , Kawahara was off to the major fraud unit to grapple with yet more cases of white-collar crime . She had three trials that year , but in December she was brought into the case of Newport Beach investment_adviser Steven D . Wymer , who was arrested on federal fraud charges in connection with the disappearance of $ 100 million of his clients ' money . * For most of 1992 , Kawahara said , she and other prosecutors tried to unravel a thicket of investments that governments , like the cities of Orange and Torrance , thought they had made in investment grade securities through Wymer ' s financial management firm . But prosecutors showed that much of the money was diverted to finance Wymer ' s lavish lifestyle and purchase property , luxury automobiles , boats and fine_art . Some cities , like Orange , claimed to have lost millions of dollars . With the case set for trial , Wymer ' s attorney struck a deal with prosecutors in September , 1992 . Wymer pleaded guilty to nine federal charges of racketeering , stock fraud , mail_fraud , bank fraud and obstructing justice . Prosecutors asked that he be sentenced to 15 to 20 years in prison . Wymer asked_for less than 10 years . He was sentenced to 14 1 / 2 years and agreed to cooperate with authorities in trying to regain some of the missing money . So far , only about $ 10 million has been recovered . Although it was difficult to sort through the web of securities transactions in trying to track the missing $ 100 million , Kawahara said prosecuting the case was not that hard . &quot; The case was really overwhelming , &quot; she said . &quot; It was so easy to see that if someone says you were supposed to have a lot of money and you don ' t have any of it , while ( Wymer ) could come_up with some excuses , the bottom_line is the bottom_line . The best he could do for himself was plead guilty and try to assist the government and the victims. &quot; Wymer ' s defense_attorney , James D . Riddet of Santa Ana , said he was saddened to see Seave leave the local U.S. attorney ' s office but was pleased to hear that Kawahara was replacing him . &quot; I have a high regard for her ability , &quot; he said . &quot; She ' s smart and fair . She ' s reasonable . I would say she ' s not particularly aggressive , but I put a bad connotation on aggressive . She obeys the rules and still represents the government ' s interests very well. &quot; Some defense_attorneys say Kawahara can be impersonal , distant and somewhat inflexible when it comes_to making deals , but they also say she is highly ethical and well versed in the law , and is an exhaustive researcher . Outgoing U.S. Atty . Terree A . Bowers calls her &quot; exceptionally bright and a hard_worker with superlative people skills. &quot; * With experience on several large investigations and with experience in white-collar prosecutions , Bowers said Kawahara is ready to head the 11-person office in Santa Ana . &quot; She has extensive experience in the Los Angeles office and has terrific potential , &quot; he said . &quot; You tend to get a lot of experience in a short period_of_time in the L.A. office. &quot; Spending as_many hours in the office as she does , Kawahara met her husband on_the_job . In May , she married Dean G . Dunlavey , deputy chief of the narcotics section in the U.S. attorney ' s office . She is a registered Democrat . He is a registered Republican . So when it comes_to some issues , such_as paying taxes for social_services , the pair part company . &quot; Our party registration alone is an indication that we don ' t agree on everything , but our fundamental approach to the job is similar , &quot; she said . &quot; It ' s safe to say , however , that during the presidential election , we each voted the party line. &quot; Kawahara comes from a financial family . Her father is Herbert G . Kawahara , a former president of the Pacific Stock_Exchange and once the top_executive in Southern California for E.F. Hutton . Her older sister was an investment_banker and her younger brother is a stockbroker . Her first concern in the Santa Ana office has been to get more attorneys . In her office , which handles federal prosecutions from San Bernardino and Riverside counties as well , attorneys are required to file cases based on the number of judges in the local U.S. District Court . &quot; We are required to handle twice as_many cases per assistant ( U.S. attorney ) as in L.A. , &quot; she said . &quot; As a consequence , the cases we would like to handle down here get handled by the L.A. office . What I would like to see is us handling cases in Orange County that happen in Orange County. &quot; Although she will be hampered by a current hiring freeze and a mandate by the Clinton_Administration to downsize the government , Kawahara said the need is overwhelming . &quot; For the amount of crime that occurs down here , we just need more help , &quot; she said . &quot; Part of it is logistics , making_it easier for agents and witnesses , but more importantly , this is an important metropolitan center separate and distinct from Los Angeles. &quot; Being head of the Santa Ana office , which is only 6 years old , is a unique opportunity to shape strategies for prosecuting all kinds of crime , she said . &quot; I have the opportunity to build an office rather than just being part of what is already a tremendous office , &quot; she said . &quot; Our presence . . . ought to be greater than it is now . There are certainly as_many cases generated out of this area as can be handled here and we ought to be more sensitive to what is happening here. &quot; Jean A .
