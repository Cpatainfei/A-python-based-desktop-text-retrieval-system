   <HEADLINE> POSTREL ON HEALTH_CARE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In response to &quot; Health-Care Truths and Consequences , &quot; Column Right , July 1 : Do I feel_like a fool . Virginia I . Postrel tells me my life_insurance premiums have been going_to subsidize the families of old people who die . She exposes casualty insurance as a cruel hoax because my house never burned , and I never had a car accident . And my elders have duped me into waiting more_than 45 years to collect Social_Security benefits . I ' ve also learned that the reason for rising health_care is because more people are going_to use the system . It ' s foolish to deny that those who previously couldn ' t buy or pay_for medical services will undoubtedly flood the system once we offer the means to pay the cost of doctors and medicine and hospitals . With alarm I hear the government is planning to ration health coverage . However , because I have a pre-existing condition , am unemployed , not eligible for Medicare , and can ' t afford my own insurance , I ' m relieved to see it doesn ' t threaten my current plan . I am grateful that Postrel , who obviously has an ax to grind , is using it to cut_through the truth to get right to the rhetoric . Partisan politics has become the substitute for principle , integrity and commitment and has obscured the search for truth . It ' s there but we can ' t find it if we ' re only pretending to look_for it . It ' s time to tell our representatives to cut the crap and get_to work . BERNIE KAUFMAN West Hills * The article by Virginia Postrel , the editor of Reason magazine , contains so many sophistries that it requires refutation . While there are selected points in which I would concur , the gist of the argument seems to be &quot; why should healthy young people be taxed to contribute to Medicare for which they are as yet ineligible ? &quot; Many of the Medicare beneficiaries have spent a lifetime in productive work and have no income to pay medical_bills . Many are not_able to work and some , such_as the undersigned , are able to work_at his profession but have been victims of_age discrimination . Virtually all industrialized countries save the U.S. seem able to take_care of their elderly but these countries did not blow their fortunes on unnecessary armaments . As for the argument that medical costs should rise unchecked because this is necessary to supply funds for research , just what fraction of costs above the inflation level go_for research and just how much is just plain greed ?
