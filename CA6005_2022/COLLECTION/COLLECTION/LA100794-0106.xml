   <HEADLINE> JAILED MEXICO POLITICIAN TIED TO ASSASSINATION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> An imprisoned politician with family ties to drug dealers was formally accused Thursday of helping to plan the assassination of his party ' s No . 2 official , and the attorney_general ' s office said the plot is believed to reach higher into the political ranks . Three witnesses -- two of them also suspects -- have implicated Abraham Rubio Canales in what authorities have said was the plot to kill Francisco Ruiz Massieu . Massieu was the second-ranking official in the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party ( PRI ) , police said in a statement . Assistant Atty . Gen . Mario Ruiz Massieu , the slain man ' s brother , said in an interview at a local radio_station , &quot; We believe that Rubio Canales has some responsibility in the murder , but not that he is the brains behind it. &quot; Witnesses had previously told police that Rubio Canales -- who is related by marriage to suspected drug dealer Raul Valladares -- wanted revenge against Francisco Ruiz Massieu . He supposedly blamed Massieu , who was governor of the state of Guerrero when Rubio Canales managed a development agency there , for his conviction on land fraud charges . Rubio Canales is still serving out the resulting 14-year prison sentence . Maria Eugenia Ramirez Arauz , another suspected conspirator arrested Wednesday , also told police that Rubio Canales had provided plotters with $ 300 # 000 . Half that money was spent on buying arms and hiring a triggerman , drivers and lookouts to carry_out the killing , she said . Francisco Ruiz Massieu , the second major politician to be murdered in six months , was shot to death Sept . 28 outside a downtown hotel here . The triggerman fled when the gun jammed after a single shot . He was caught by a bank security_guard . Since then , the web of suspects has expanded rapidly to include Congressman Manuel Munoz Rocha , his aide and various members of the aide ' s family . Many of those allegedly involved have turned themselves in out of fear of other conspirators , Mario Ruiz Massieu said . Munoz Rocha and the aide , Fernando Rodriguez Gonzalez , are still fugitives . Rodriguez Gonzalez may be dead , Mario Ruiz Massieu said . He discounted the likelihood that Munoz Rocha masterminded the killing because &quot; he is not known for leadership characteristics. &quot; Police said Ramirez Arauz told them that Munoz Rocha and Rubio Canales are close friends . Besides her testimony , police said another suspect , Jorge Rodriguez Gonzalez , told them that Rubio Canales was involved in the plot . A third witness , Filiberto Chavelas , who was not further identified , told them that he had heard Rubio Canales threaten to kill Francisco Ruiz Massieu on various occasions .</TEXT>
