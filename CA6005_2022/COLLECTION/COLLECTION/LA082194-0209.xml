   <HEADLINE> FIRST_PERSON : PRACTICALITY ? JUST GIVE ME MY VIRTUAL RINGO</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A colleague seemed surprised and puzzled_over my recent choice to buy a CD-ROM player , yet curious -- or materialistic -- enough to keep pressing me for pertinent details about just what the damn things do and how much they cost . The bottom-line question was inevitable : Were I sucker enough to shell for one of these , would n ' t it go the way of all flesh and all hardware formats right about the time I figured_out which side of the disc goes_up ? hypothesized my interrogator , the hollow look of a former Beta man in his eyes . Pressed for a defense , I spewed forth some of the usual hopeful , high-sell applications of CD-ROM as entertainment and / or information for the home , business , university and playroom . But then I decided upon just one word ( much like the gent who advises Dustin Hoffman about plastics in &quot; The Graduate &quot; ) to assure him that there is a future for the format : Pornography . It ' s not that I mistook my colleague for Uncle Ernie . It ' s just that , if some of the more pragmatic computer magazines are to be believed , CD-ROM is in much the same place now as the VCR was just as that American staple started to boom in the early 1980s : an invention touted as fun for the whole family that ironically is being fueled largely by the sudden , easy availability of soft-core smut . And with this upstart hardware , high-tech dirty pictures become a staple of the home and office : While his co-workers go_out for lunch , Dad can use the same PC that gets steamed up rolling_over stocks during business hours to interactively order the Pet of the Month to roll_over . While other new formats may have the support of Sega , you see , CD-ROM has the support of Seka . Seriously ( and no one should doubt that the economic viability afforded a porn-friendly format is serious business ) , CD-ROM will probably succeed most of all because it works in conjunction with personal_computers , thus further diluting the diminishing line between business and pleasure . There ' s guilt involved in getting a Gameboy , or probably should be -- but a legitimate computer_accessory , Lord knows , you ' re going to use for important stuff . Programs currently available already run a gamut from the mundane to near-sublime . Would you like to walk through the National Gallery of London on your home computer ? Have the phone_company ' s white pages or yellow pages for the entire country encoded on a single slender compact_disc ? Browse an encyclopedia that comes_with handy film_clips and sound bytes ? Remix a David Bowie song to specification ? Explore lavishly animated alternate worlds at your own pace ? Play chess with characters that duke out your moves_on the board ? Watch an entire movie in miniature , with production notes scrolling alongside ? Flip through an audiovisual business magazine ? Study a Bible that has James Earl Jones speaking_up occasionally and disconcertingly through your PC as the voice of God ? Interactive catalogue shopping , anyone ? No ? You know you want it . Not that the future-shock glut now playing_at an electronics store near you didn ' t give me plenty of doubts of my own about the format ' s long-term survival prospects before I made the leap . Though never a Beta man myself , I do feel a certain loneliness as still the only laser-disc enthusiast on my block , and I plan to be the last to jump_on the Mini-Disc or Digital Compact Cassette bandwagons , should there ever be one of either . I still have a defiant &quot; convince me &quot; attitude toward the formats that more or less are competitors to CD-ROM for America ' s hearts and minds , like CD-i ( CD-interactive ) and CD + G ( CD-plus-graphics ) . Such a quandary . The indefatigable collector in me finally started lusting_after a CD-ROM_drive after reading favorable reviews of recent interactive music releases by the_likes_of Peter Gabriel and the former Prince , as well as press_releases about upcoming retrospective discs on everyone from Monty Python to Clint Eastwood to Bob Dylan . But the technophobe in me convincingly counterargued that life is already entertaining and difficult enough without spending untold hours learning new commands just to finally hear &quot; Gett Off &quot; or &quot; You feel lucky , punk ? &quot; booming through my tinny computer speaker . What about price , you ( and I ) ask ? The good news is , you can get a good external &quot; double-speed &quot; CD-ROM_drive add-on for your computer for $ 225- $ 400 these days -- not_bad as cutting-edge hardware goes . The bad news is , the software itself almost never comes cheap , usually costing anywhere from $ 35- $ 60 for discounted popular titles and more_than $ 100 for some heavyweight discs . The good news is , thanks to the immense archival storage capacity of each disc , you sometimes get an awful lot of ROM for your charge slip . ( Those national white pages come_to mind. ) Myself , I was strictly a &quot; DOS for Dummies &quot; kind of guy a couple short months ago . But on a recent conspicuous-consumptive whim , I bought a new Power Mac with built-in CD-ROM_drive ( about $ 2 # 000 ) , and topped_off the shopping by bagging my first piece of CD-ROM software , Xplora : Peter Gabriel ' s Secret World ( $ 60 ) . Whoops : This was a pointedly arty , almost all-graphic CD-ROM , in which the intelligentsia could point and click on color_codes and mysterious icons to proceed to the various Gabriel videos and song extracts and odes to African instruments . ( Words , it seems , get_in the aesthetic way. ) Novices best start elsewhere -- though eventually I found that pointing ' n ' clicking at random , not unlike the proverbial typing monkey , would get me through the disc in my own careening fashion . But the &quot; game &quot; aspect still proved frustrating : Sometimes I would click on some intriguing symbol and an ethereal Gabriel visage would pop_up , teasing , &quot; No , I ' m sorry , you can ' t get_in there without a pass. &quot; After the umpteenth blockage without the slightest idea which passing window might be the will-call where I could pick_up my &quot; pass , &quot; I found myself wanting to world-beat Peter on the head with a very big xylophone mallet . Sixty bucks I paid to have a hologram tell me I ' m not on the guest list ? Obviously , a computer-illiterate fool such_as I was in need of something a little more elementary ( i.e. , text-based ) to start with . My follow-up purchase , &quot; Cinemania ' 94 , &quot; fit the bill handily . This disc , aimed at film buffs , allows you to type in one of any thousands of movie titles , then pick between the respective opinions of Maltin , Kael or Ebert , or get an instant bio and filmography on major actors and filmmakers . For the most popular films , you can pull_up production credits , listen to a byte of scoring or dialogue , or for a_few select titles , even watch a herky-jerky film_clip . My next stab at user-friendliness , Compton ' s Interactive Encyclopedia , proved a lot more fun than the encyclopedias I waded through as a kid , if only because I could call_up video of J . F . K . asking us to ask not , or M . L . K . recounting his dream . Next I was_on to the most popular CD-ROM title of years past -- the Voyager edition of the Beatles ' &quot; A Hard Day ' s Night &quot; that has the complete film unspooling in a small window on-screen , with access to the original draft of the script , critical notes or record-studio logs alongside the movie . Type in &quot; Turn left at Greenland &quot; or just &quot; Greenland , &quot; and the disc will take you right to the spot in the movie where John Lennon answers the reporter ' s question , &quot; How do you find America ? &quot; Having successfully navigated these fab digital baby steps , I felt ready to again try my mousy hand at something challengingly interactive , something less literal and more instinctive : &quot; Virtual Valerie. &quot; Just kidding . Rather it was high_time to check_out Myst , the one CD-ROM title that has become a singular phenomenon . The brilliance of Myst made me realize why CD-ROM is oddly perfect for adults and younger children alike , but will probably frustrate the Nintendo-trained teens in between : Like most games designed for the format , it moves very , very slowly , providing a tangible sense of exploration but no quick thrills . With few instructions , you move_around a deserted island one lazy click at a time -- reflexes and / or coordination not required ( a big plus , in my book ) -- looking_for clues amid the spookily lifelike illustrations to put_together the &quot; back story &quot; yourself . To hell with &quot; winning &quot; : Improbably , I enjoyed clicking my way down to the Myst Island dock just to listen to the waves lap against the wood , or going_up into the woods to hear the wind whistle through the trees , being in no hurry to best the 40 hours it ' s said to take an average person to get_around the entire island . Myst is the first example I know of , in the computer realm , at least , of a stop-and-smell-the-roses game . A bona_fide new art_form , as Wired magazine claims of Myst ? Maybe . A nd yet , the complaints you hear about CD-ROM are basically true : The lag time between command and response does limit the possibilities for games . The film_clips are tiny and ridiculously low-resolution , like live-action flip cards . Audio dropouts are common , at least on my system , as are annoying messages informing you your computer doesn ' t have enough memory to continue . The level of actual &quot; interactivity &quot; is more hype than reality , unless you ' re convinced having a gameskeeper or naked_lady or the goofball formerly known as Prince lure you down animated corridors is the height of freedom of choice . Some holdouts -- like my not-quite-convinced colleague -- find these factors a barrier to buying_in . As a new convert , I acknowledge the limitations and resolve to enjoy what ' s there , since it ' s more likely there ' ll be technological improvements to CD-ROM than it is a whole new format will set a different standard for home computer accouterments any year soon . But maybe I ' m just rationalizing the extravagance of my new toy , because you know what ? Defying all sense , I actually enjoy hearing &quot; Gett Off &quot; blast through my tinny little PC speaker .</TEXT>
