   <HEADLINE> HOME ENTERTAINMENT ; ' MENACE ' ON LASER DISC : TRUE GRIT AND URBAN GORE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Watching and listening to filmmakers Allen and Albert Hughes talk_about their debut 1993 feature_film , &quot; Menace II Society , &quot; on a new Criterion laser disc ( $ 100 ) takes commitment and a strong stomach . First , there is the raw film itself , seen for the first time in an unrated director ' s cut . From the unsparing , &quot; Sunset Blvd. &quot; -style opening to the literal closing shot of &quot; Menace II Society , &quot; there is little question of the film ' s resolution : violent_death amid grinding hopelessness . Then there is the special supplementary material on this jam-packed laser disc in which each identical_twin is given his own analog soundtrack . To hear what they have to say about the making of &quot; Menace , &quot; you have to watch the film play_out twice to give each brother a chance to explain , scene by grueling scene , how their bold vision was put_on film . There is little doubt that we ' re in the presence of two young , uncompromising filmmakers with much potential . The Hughes brothers were 20 when they co-directed &quot; Menace II Society , &quot; a film whose story they say they had thought_about since they were 15 . The Criterion laser edition leaves almost nothing out : In addition to the unrated film featuring material deleted from the theatrical release and the two audio commentaries , the package includes the original theatrical trailer ; two deleted scenes dropped_in the final cut ; two music videos directed by the Hughes brothers ; excerpts from Albert Hughes ' Los Angeles City College_student film , &quot; The Drive By , &quot; and the short , &quot; Menace to Society &quot; ; a video interview with the Hugheses ; storyboards and storyboard-to-film comparison of key action sequences , and other production notes and documentation . In this home theater version , &quot; Menace &quot; unwinds with all_the graphic violence that the MPAA insisted be removed to avoid an NC-17 rating . Even more_than in the movie_theater , the assault on the senses in the comfort of your living room amplifies the harsh realities of this corner of urban life : young_men living a nasty , short and brutish &quot; gangsta &quot; existence seemingly handed_down from generation to generation , with little done to break the cycle . For some , the raw language and bullets tearing_apart bodies may be too_much ; for others , it may simply underscore the film ' s point , in Allen ' s words : &quot; The whole idea of the movie was to make people understand ; we wanted people to know what they ' re thinking. &quot; And , he cautions , &quot; People shouldn ' t read too deep into this movie . We just wanted to make a movie that had some kind of morality. &quot; Albert says that black audiences often had less trouble dealing with the violent subject_matter than white audiences : &quot; They know it ' s just a film , &quot; he says . ( &quot; Menace II Society , &quot; without supplementary material and deleted scenes , is also available in a letterboxed , single-disc CLV edition from Image Entertainment at $ 35. ) Grotesque Carnage &quot; Man Bites Dog , &quot; the 1992 French film by Remy Belvaux , Andre Bonzel and Benoit Poelvoorde , offers even more grotesque carnage than &quot; Menace &quot; in a director-approved Criterion edition ( $ 50 ) that includes disgusting scenes excised by censors . An interview with the filmmakers at the end of the single disc makes the point that &quot; it ' s not a film about violence , it ' s a film about filmmaking. &quot; Shot in black-and-white with a hand-held camera as a document of the life and mind of a sociopathic killer , it ' s been hailed as a sendup of reality-based docudrama films . Liner notes by Holly Willis also argue that assailing the film for its brutality &quot; completely misses the film ' s point. &quot; That may be so , but it is hard to find much redemption in this unrelenting series of murders and graphic rape , and even harder to watch for its full 92 minutes . There is little humanity involved here . In fact , &quot; Man Bites Dog &quot; makes &quot; Menace II Society &quot; look tame by comparison .
