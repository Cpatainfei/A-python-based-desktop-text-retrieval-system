   <HEADLINE> ELECTIONS ' 94 : IMPACT ON BUSINESS ; ELECTIONS ACCENT AN UPBEAT ECONOMIC OUTLOOK ; RECOVERY : RETURNS SEEM TO ENDORSE STATE ' S PRO-BUSINESS MOVES . JOB GROWTH IS ACCELERATING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> California ' s business_community , accustomed to bad news in recent times , took a measure of comfort in Tuesday ' s elections , and not just because of the results : For the first time in decades , campaign after campaign emphasized the need for jobs and economic_growth . &quot; It ' s about time , &quot; said Gary Heathcote , an architect in Westlake Village . &quot; It ' s a little bit late -- but late is better than never. &quot; Gov . Pete Wilson ' s reelection was heartening news to business_executives who applaud his efforts to cut red_tape and make the state a more congenial location so that companies will remain . &quot; It ' s great news for people who create jobs , &quot; said Wilford D . Godbold Jr. , president of Zero Corp . in Los Angeles . He added that &quot; the theme transcended party lines. &quot; The election took_place at a time when California ' s economy confronts powerful forces , both helpful -- such_as the expanding U.S. recovery -- and harmful -- such_as the budget woes in Sacramento . In this mixed picture , some business representatives reacted to the returns with tempered optimism . Ray Remy , president of the Los Angeles Area Chamber_of_Commerce , said Wilson ' s victory reflects strong business support , but he still worried about the state ' s &quot; very intractable &quot; budget problems . Indeed , even as Wilson savored victory , California ' s troubled economy was not far from his mind . The Golden State , he vowed on Election Night , would be expanding faster than the nation as_a_whole within the next two years . That view is backed_up by an assortment of analysts who believe a long-awaited statewide recovery is slowly gathering momentum and that continuation of certain pro-business policies may help to a degree . Nonetheless , California ' s economic future is also being shaped by worldwide forces beyond the domain of state policy-makers , experts said Wednesday . Moreover , state issues that matter enormously to the economy , such_as crime and education , are the products of trends that have lasted many years . &quot; No one person is responsible_for all_the bads or the goods in the economy , &quot; said Tapan Munroe , chief economist at Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co . in San Francisco . Matters of great significance , such_as the conversion of defense factories to peacetime uses and the emergence of new , job-creating industries , are largely determined by free-market forces , he added , noting , &quot; Government doesn ' t do this. &quot; Other important policies are set at the federal level . For instance , the possibility of new tax_policies emerging from a Republican-dominated Congress , such_as a cut_in the capital_gains rate , could boost the fortunes of fast-growing firms in technology , trade and other fields important to California , said Gary Schlossberg , an economist at Wells Fargo Bank in San Francisco . On this much the analysts agree : The state has finally begun producing jobs again . Official government statistics suggest the increase has been extremely modest -- perhaps in the range of a_few thousand jobs a month -- while other analysts put the figure in the range of 10 # 000 to 15 # 000 jobs a month . An ebullient Wilson on Tuesday night cited an Oct . 18 forecast from First Interstate Bancorp that said California will outpace the nation in the rate of job growth by 1996 , when the state is expected to be gaining 20 # 000 to 25 # 000 new jobs a month . California was generating 30 # 000 jobs monthly during the strongest periods of the 1980s , said Adrian Sanchez , regional economist with First Interstate . During the darkest days of recession in the early 1990s , the state was losing jobs at an average rate of more_than 27 # 000 a month . &quot; All Californians have been fighting like junkyard dogs to turn this state around . And you know what ? You are succeeding , &quot; Wilson told supporters . &quot; Unemployment is down . Investment is way up . Three times more venture_capital came_to California last year than any other state. &quot; In large part , California ' s job-growth rate can be expected to compare increasingly well to the nationwide rate because California ' s recovery is in an earlier stage . Still , business_leaders and economists Wednesday cited Wilson ' s efforts to keep employers and streamline red_tape as examples of policies that can have some helpful impact on the economy . Sanchez cautioned , however , that &quot; there ' s probably still a lot to be done -- and I ' m sure the governor would agree. &quot; On a more fundamental level , one scholar suggested that the election results conveyed a message that could have significant long-term effects on the economy : Frustrated Californians are demanding a smaller public sector , a solution to the state fiscal woes and a reduced tax burden , said Frank C . Wykoff , an economist at Pomona College . They also want the federal_government to do more to help the state in return for the enormous taxes Californians pay , he said . In the long_run , &quot; California could be a hell of a place to do business , &quot; Wykoff said . &quot; You could have very , very positive economic growth. &quot;</TEXT>
