   <HEADLINE> CAMPAIGN ' 94 : ISSUES AND ANSWERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three candidates are running in the Nov . 8 election to represent the 72nd Assembly District . They are Democrat Allan L . Dollison of Brea ; Libertarian Geoffrey Braun of Placentia ; and Republican Ross Johnson , the incumbent , of Placentia . Here ' s how they stand on four issues . &quot; Three Strikes &quot; Crime Law Dollison : &quot; I favor and endorse the ' three strikes ' initiative . We must do all we can to protect society from dangerous and violent repeat felons . However , those politicians who say that ' three strikes ' is all that is needed are living_in denial . We must do something about the unlimited and free access to killing machines ( guns ) that have endangered society rather than protect it . We must also reform the juvenile justice system , and require boot camps for all young offenders . These camps would concentrate_on military-style discipline and education. &quot; Braun : &quot; No one can deny that crime is a serious problem in America . But rather than protecting us and keeping our streets safe , current government policies are the primary reason that the crime problem is growing worse , and ' three strikes ' crime laws are bandages , not cures . The Libertarian alternative to ' three strikes ' would apply a victim-centered approach to all aspects of the criminal justice system : shifting resources away from victimless_crimes and toward violent crimes with real victims ; protecting the rights of victims throughout the criminal justice process ; and preventing new victims by ensuring the right of self-defense. &quot; Johnson : &quot; I co-authored the ' three strikes ' anti-crime law in the Legislature . Fifty-eight percent of those released from California ' s prisons are convicted of a new crime within two years of release . It ' s time to shut this revolving door . Some repeat offenders have , quite simply , forfeited their right to live free in a civilized society . Incarceration is costly , but it ' s far more expensive to pay_for police , courts , prosecutors , probation_officers and public_defenders processing the same career criminals over and over again. &quot; Initiative to Curtail Benefits to Illegal Immigrants Dollison : &quot; I am opposed to Proposition 187 . It is contrary to the U.S. Constitution . I am proposing that we re-prioritize the mission of the California National_Guard and send a force of 10 # 000 to 15 # 000 soldiers to protect the border . A massive recruitment drive would need to be undertaken as the Guard does not have the manpower to keep a force like that full-time . Secondly , I propose that we analyze where the holes in the border are and that a ' Berlin-style ' wall be built to keep the illegal aliens from coming . Kicking children out of school will only worsen our crime problem , and not affect our immigration problem. &quot; Braun : &quot; ' Save Our State ' is a racially motivated proposition that tries to pin California ' s financial troubles on undocumented Latino immigrants rather than admit that government programs are inherently unmanageable . It presupposes that undocumented aliens cross our borders for the sole purpose of obtaining government handouts . In reality , the majority of our immigrants , documented and undocumented alike , are drawn by our higher wage base . Any problem with California ' s taxpayer-financed programs comes primarily from the way government does business , not from those who utilize the flawed programs. &quot; Johnson : &quot; More_than half the illegal immigrants in the United States reside in California , including 23 # 200 state_prison inmates whose upkeep costs taxpayers $ 200 million annually . The state_Department of Finance estimates that another 100 # 000 undocumented immigrants move here every year . California ' s diversity is a great asset , but footing the bill for a wide range of services to illegal immigrants imposes a burden on taxpayers that is unaffordable and unfair . The ' SOS ' initiative will end the benefits that draw people here illegally , and send a message to Washington that the federal_government must control our borders. &quot; Single-Payer Health Initiative Dollison : &quot; Universal coverage should be guaranteed for all , but provided by government , employer and employee contributions into ' health-care accounts. ' Then , individuals would negotiate with doctors to keep their prices down . The days of the $ 18 Tylenol pill need to come_to an end . We also need to increase the number of doctors produced in this country . Basic economics tells us that by increasing supply , prices will fall . Lastly , something needs to be done about the fact that the average person spends a third of his entire health-care budget in the final year of life . This issue would present very difficult moral dilemmas. &quot; Braun : &quot; A single-payer health-care plan would increase costs , crush jobs , impose broad new taxes on Californians , destroy consumer choice and lead to rationing of health_care . Instead , health-care reforms should draw_on the strengths of the free market . I support the following reforms : establishing tax-exempt medical savings accounts similar to IRAs ; restructuring tax_policy to make all health-care expenditures 100 % tax deductible ; deregulating the health-care industry ; replacing the Food and Drug Administration with voluntary certification by a private-sector organization ; privatizing Medicare and Medicaid. &quot; Johnson : &quot; This measure would impose the largest tax increase in California ' s history -- an estimated $ 40 billion to $ 53 billion in increased income and payroll taxes -- to fund a state-run bureaucracy that could easily double the size of state_government . Under Canada ' s single-payer system , 177 # 000 people are currently on a waiting list for surgery , and waits of eight months for tests such_as mammograms are not uncommon . We need reform , but this initiative is not the answer . I support insurance coverage reforms to ensure wider access to health-care coverage , and consumer-oriented reforms to help bring medical costs down. &quot; Future Uses For El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station Dollison : &quot; I support converting El Toro into a commercial airport , where only small aircraft land . This is very similar to the airport that exists in Fullerton . Currently , John Wayne Airport has both type of aircraft land , and Federal Aviation officials consider this a dangerous situation , and is inviting an accident . If you only allow small aircraft to land , it will appease the neighbors in the community , as it will actually be a reduction in noise from the F-16s they grew used to. &quot; Braun : &quot; The Department of the Navy should sell MCAS El Toro to the highest bidder , and the new owner should be free to develop the site into a commercial airport if he feels that is the highest and best use of the property. &quot; Johnson : &quot; Orange County voters will have the opportunity to express themselves on this issue on Nov . 8 . This much is clear : If Orange County is to realize its full potential as an economic power on the Pacific Rim , a truly international airport is an important step . El Toro is one option , but legitimate environmental and other concerns of area residents and local_governments would certainly have to be addressed. &quot;</TEXT>
