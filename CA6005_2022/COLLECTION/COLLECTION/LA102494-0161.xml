   <HEADLINE> CANDIDATE AMONG 50 DEAD IN SRI LANKA BOMB ATTACK ; TERRORISM : OPPOSITION LEADER IS KILLED BY A SUICIDE ASSASSIN AT AN ELECTION RALLY . TAMIL GUERRILLAS SUSPECTED .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A suicide assassin detonated a bomb at an election rally outside Colombo late Sunday , killing about 50 people , including the opposition candidate for president and top leaders of his party . The assassination of Gamini Dissanayake came just 2 1 / 2 weeks before the election and just one day before peace talks were to resume with Tamil guerrillas to end the country ' s 11-year-old civil_war . Dissanayake was an outspoken critic of the talks that began this month , and the government had warned him three weeks ago that the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eemal would try to kill him . The talks scheduled for today were called_off , government delegate Navin Gunaratne said . No new date was set . The election has been postponed . The bomb ripped through the rally on the outskirts of Colombo shortly before midnight . Dissanayake had just finished speaking and was stepping off the stage to greet supporters . &quot; Police believe this was the work of a suicide bomber , &quot; military spokesman Gemunu Kulatunga said . &quot; The bomb was apparently at the front of the stage , &quot; said Weerasooriya Wickrema , campaign manager of Dissanayake ' s United National Party . &quot; It was a very powerful bomb. &quot; There was no immediate claim of responsibility , and police said it was too early to say who set the blast . But the Tigers have a long history of assassinations and suicide bombings . The same kind of explosive was used by a suicide bomber last year to kill President Ranasinghe Premadasa . The Tigers were blamed for that attack but have denied responsibility . The rebels were also blamed for the May , 1991 , assassination of Indian Prime_Minister Rajiv Gandhi and the killings of dozens of Sri Lankan politicians and military_leaders . A hospital official said about 50 bodies had been brought_to General Hospital in Colombo following Sunday ' s blast . A Defense Ministry spokesman , speaking on condition of anonymity , said more_than 200 people were wounded . Among the others killed were the United National Party ' s general secretary , two former Cabinet_ministers and a member_of_Parliament , Wickrema said . In an emergency meeting early today , Prime_Minister Chandrika Kumaratunga ' s Cabinet decided to postpone the Nov . 9 election , in which she was to stand as a candidate for the ruling alliance . The armed forces were put_on alert , and the government reimposed emergency measures giving the army and police a free hand to maintain law and order . The measures , in place for 11 years , had been lifted in August . The Tigers have been fighting since 1983 for an independent homeland for the Tamil minority in the north and east of Sri Lanka , where they say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese majority . The Tamils make_up about 18 % of Sri Lanka ' s 17 million people . The new peace talks , to be held_in the guerrilla stronghold of Jaffna , were to focus_on a cease-fire and the opening of a land route for supplies to the rebel-held Jaffna peninsula , one of the guerrilla negotiators , who asked not to be identified , said earlier Sunday . The first round was held Oct . 12-14 and in Jaffna , 185 miles north of Colombo . Those discussions centered_on economic issues and the repairing of roads , canals , schools and hospitals ravaged by the war , which has killed more_than 34 # 000 people .</TEXT>
