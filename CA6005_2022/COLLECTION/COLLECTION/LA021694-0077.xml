   <HEADLINE> SUPERVISORS GET TOUGHER WITH SOLO DRIVERS ; AIR_POLLUTION : UNDER DIRECTIVE FOR COUNTY WORKERS , MEASURES SUCH AS CAR-POOLING ARE LINKED TO EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Ventura County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday decided to take a tougher approach to getting county employees out of their cars in_order to curb air_pollution . In a unanimous decision , the supervisors voted to make_it a condition of employment that , at least one day a week , county workers must car-pool , ride a bus or find another way to work other_than driving solo . The board , however , has not decided how to implement its new directive or what penalties to levy against those who don ' t car-pool . The panel is expected to take_up the issue again next month . &quot; If you set it up as a condition of employment , that final step could be termination , &quot; said Alan Bandoli , Ventura County employee transportation coordinator . &quot; It will be up_to the board. &quot; In related actions , board_members decided not to renew a cash-incentive program and to encourage more telecommuting . Although about 1 # 500 of the county ' s 6 # 700 employees car-pool at least once a week , Supervisor Maggie Kildee said , &quot; We need to get the cars off the road. &quot; Under Rule 210 -- the county ' s strict trip-reduction ordinance adopted to help reduce air_pollution -- businesses and agencies employing 100 or more people must provide incentives to reduce the number of people driving alone to work . On Tuesday , the supervisors said they are frustrated that the law puts pressure on the employers rather than the workers . &quot; The onus has to be shifted from the employer to the employees , &quot; Supervisor Maria VanderKolk said . VanderKolk advocated financial penalties for employees who do not find an alternate mode of transportation to work_at least once a week . The board also voted unanimously to make department managers responsible_for coming_up with ideas to implement the decision . Union officials on Tuesday said they are dubious about the success of such a mandate . Barry Hammitt , executive_director of the Service Employees International Union , Local 998 , said , &quot; Without incentives , I don ' t hold_out a lot of hope. &quot; Hammitt said some employees might have a difficult time complying with the new rule . &quot; There ' s a whole_lot of problems , &quot; he said . &quot; What do you do with people who have physical disabilities , or who live_in areas where there is no public transportation ? &quot; Chief County Counsel James McBride said the board has the authority to impose such a condition of employment , though union contracts might have to be renegotiated . Supervisors had earlier asked Bandoli to devise alternatives to the cash-incentive plan as a means of saving money . From 1990 to November , 1993 , the county paid workers $ 250 to $ 300 annually to car-pool , ride a bus , bicycle or walk to work an average of three days a week for 48 weeks . The county spent about $ 330 # 000 annually on the program , Bandoli said . Bandoli had recommended that the board approve a series of programs aimed at reaching a higher ride-share goal but said he did not expect the board to take a more stringent position . Bandoli said he will look_at ideas such_as making employees pay higher parking fees if they drive to work alone . &quot; You make people make an economic choice , &quot; he said . The county is in compliance with the current mandate at 1.38 people per car . Under state law , if the average ridership does not reach 1.5 people per car by 1997 , the county could be fined up_to $ 25 # 000 daily , Bandoli said . * ASSAULT ON SMOG : EPA unveils bold plan that raises the hackles of local officials .
