   <HEADLINE> BOULEZ , THE MELLOW YEARS ; PIERRE BOULEZ WAS ONCE A FEARED COMPOSER-CONDUCTOR , BUT TODAY HE IS A GRACIOUS , WITTY CONDUCTOR WHO IS CONSIDERATE TOWARD HIS MUSICIANS AND STILL PASSIONATE ABOUT HAVING CONTEMPORARY MUSIC IN PEOPLE ' S LIVES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The scene at the PolyGram post-Grammy party a_few weeks ago was unprecedented . An exuberant young staff_member of the once-stuffy German classical_music label Deutsche Grammophon was literally shouting the news from the rafters and inviting revelers to party . Pierre Boulez ' s recording , with the Chicago Symphony , of Bartok ' s seldom-played early ballet score &quot; The Wooden Prince &quot; and his even less-known choral work &quot; Cantata Profana , &quot; had won Grammys for best classical recording , best orchestral recording , best choral recording and best engineered recording . If one were to equate the classical_music Grammy Awards to Oscars , this grand_slam makes Boulez the equivalent of Steven Spielberg and Jane Campion rolled into one . But , ironically , the notable achievement for Boulez is that no one in classical_music , except perhaps fidgety marketing executives , really takes the Grammys very seriously . They are not sophisticated awards . They generally go_to big names , to potboiler releases or to sonic blockbusters . So what all_the shouting was about was that Boulez -- the rigorous modernist leader of the European total serialism movement in the ' 50s and composer of probably the most formidable music to actually enter into the fringes of the repertory -- was no longer scary and had even developed some mass-market appeal . Angelenos , of course , knew this long before the rest of the country caught_up_with the new Boulez , 69 , and his appearances at the Music Center this week and next would probably have been eagerly awaited with or without the Grammys . When he began biannual visits to the Los Angeles Philharmonic a decade ago , his American profile was low and his reputation was that of a new-music ogre . At that time he was still remembered as &quot; The French Correction &quot; of the New York Philharmonic , the audience-unfriendly disciplinarian who followed Leonard Bernstein as its music_director . He was feared as the tyrant of French music and something of a mad musical scientist who had become the head of IRCAM , the Space_Age computer-music facility in Paris he created after leaving the New York Philharmonic . Furthermore , the complexly organized music he wrote had gone completely out_of_fashion once Minimalism and New Romanticism had begun to dominate American music . The Los Angeles Philharmonic found , instead , a musician nearly the opposite of his reputation . He turned_out to be a gracious , witty , supporting , elegant conductor with an uncanny knack for making the most difficult music seem , if not exactly easy , at least natural . Maybe the biggest surprise of all was that Boulez proved to be uncommonly considerate toward the players . He is relaxed when conducting , because , he says , a tense conductor makes the players tense . &quot; If you don ' t care_for them , they won ' t care_for you , &quot; he advised a young conductor more wrapped_up in his manner than in the players during a conducting workshop at Carnegie Hall last year . Los Angeles no longer has Boulez exclusively in America . He now spends a month each year with the Chicago Symphony and two or three weeks with the Cleveland Orchestra . For the past three seasons he has also led special workshops in conducting or composing at Carnegie Hall . And everywhere the story is the same , with Boulez seeming to win_over everyone with whom he comes_into contact . Earlier this season in Chicago , for instance , scalpers were carrying_on a brisk business the day after Thanksgiving for Boulez ' s performance of Mahler ' s Sixth Symphony . The previous season Boulez appeared with the Cleveland Orchestra at Carnegie Hall for the kind of 20th-Century program that had so annoyed New Yorkers when he was music_director of the New York Philharmonic , and got a hero ' s welcome . So dazzled and surprised was that audience that for one of the rare times in recent memory there wasn ' t that typical New Yorker rush up the aisles at the final downbeat ( or earlier ) to be the first to get a cab or to avoid the long lines at the parking garage . And now the Grammys . Boulez himself takes all_of this new-found popularity and adulation in stride . Reached by phone recently at his home_in Paris , Boulez laughed_at the irony of his winning all those Grammys . &quot; I am not personally proud about this , &quot; he said , &quot; but I am happy because it helps this music to be much more known than it is . If many people hear , for the first time , either ' The Wooden Prince ' or the ' Cantata Profana , ' then that is a good result. &quot; He is also predictably pleased that this will perhaps help egg_on Deutsche Grammophon , which has undertaken an extensive recording project of 20th-Century works with Boulez conducting several major orchestras , into unchartered repertory . Boulez , however , attributes his recent success to the fact that he has always worked hard to obtain the right conditions for making music , and by this point in his career he has achieved them . He no longer is an administrator , having resigned both as head of IRCAM and as president of the Ensemble InterContemporain , the group he helped found in 1975 , although he remains active in both institutions . He only conducts part time , 10 to 12 weeks a year , and then with just a handful of orchestras . He goes_to Chicago , because he developed a close relationship with its music_director , Daniel Barenboim , when Barenboim led L ' Orchestre de Paris . Likewise he comes_to Los Angeles because of his longstanding friendship with L.A. Philharmonic Managing Director Ernest Fleischmann . He has begun returning annually to Cleveland because it is the first American orchestra with which he became associated , in the ' 60s . He conducts the Berlin and Vienna philharmonics because , well , who would n ' t ? But mainly , Boulez says , he only goes where he can spend two weeks or , preferably , more , so that he can develop a relationship with the players . He also goes where circumstances allow him to perform the music he cares about . Berlin , for instance , is willing to sponsor a Webern festival for Boulez , who will then record the composer ' s complete works with its orchestra . &quot; I don ' t want to make a concert just for the sake of making concerts . That does not interest me . But when there is an artistic goal , that is more satisfying. &quot; Another , for instance , is Boulez ' s upcoming two weeks in Los Angeles , where he will perform his &quot; Le Visage Nuptial , &quot; an ambitious and demanding song cycle for soloists , chorus and orchestra that cannot be properly prepared in the standard rehearsal time . &quot; But because I am in Los Angeles for two weeks , I can rehearse it for two weeks , &quot; Boulez said . &quot; I can make an easy program for the first week , and therefore can have more time to rehearse ( &quot; Le Visage Nuptial &quot; ) for the second program. &quot; ( This week ' s &quot; easy &quot; program is maybe an understatement , since it includes Bartok ' s sweeping and terrifying ballet score &quot; The Miraculous Mandarin , &quot; but Boulez has conducted the orchestra in it before. ) Nothing , moreover , better typifies Boulez than &quot; Le Visage Nuptial &quot; and his programming it . For all his new-found popularity , Boulez is still not exactly a beloved composer by the general public , which would be happiest if he stuck_to the early 20th-Century hits by Debussy , Ravel , Stravinsky and Bartok . For all_the success he had with his Cleveland Orchestra concert at Carnegie Hall last season , Boulez got a much cooler response this season when he led the Ensemble InterContemporain in the American premiere of the latest version of his &quot; . . . explosante / fixe . . . &quot; -- a 35-minute work for solo flute and ensemble , electronically expanding the flute sounds instantaneously as it is played by utilizing the latest computer_hardware and software from IRCAM . It is a rich , intricate , subtle , sensual score , but not one easily apprehended in first hearing . The audience dwindled appreciably throughout the concert . Still Boulez -- like Mahler , who was adulated as a conductor but certainly not as a composer by his audiences -- is a composer first and performer second . And , as with conducting , Boulez the composer has had to fight against his reputation for exerting calculated control over every aspect of the music . Indeed , Boulez ' s polemical domination of ' 50s serialism , in which every element of the music was mathematically predetermined , proved a technique so ferocious that he himself eventually came_to call it totalitarian rather than total serialism . But Boulez ' s music has become freer in recent years , and many of his orchestra and short chamber works have found much favor . &quot; Notations I-IV , &quot; orchestral expansions of four student piano studies , has found favor with orchestras everywhere , including in Los Angeles . But even his most rigidly structured early music , with its textures as arresting as ever-changing intricate computer imagery of fractal patterns , can seem beautiful when brilliantly played . Boulez is also as stubborn a composer as he is a conductor -- maybe more so . In both personifications he will not rest until he gets_it right , which in conducting maybe means a little extra rehearsal , while for a work like &quot; Le Visage Nuptial &quot; it has meant waiting 40 years . &quot; Le Visage Nuptial , &quot; in fact , is one of the most illuminating examples of Boulez ' s artistic personality . It is based upon an extraordinary erotic poem by Rene Char , the_French surrealist poet . Boulez describes it as an unusually narrative poem written by Char , one of the_French poets of our century he most admires and with whom he became friends . &quot; The story is very simple . The beginning of love . The climax is in the middle . Then at the end , the disenchantment and farewell. &quot; The language , however , is anything but simple . The imagery is often erotic and violent , with narrative events only implied , nothing ever spelled_out . The circumstances of its original composition in 1946 are unclear . Joan Peyser , in her 1976 biography of Boulez , implies a mysterious love_affair and a suicide_pact . Boulez has never spoken_of it . But the Boulez of that period was clearly high-strung , subject_to extreme emotions that for a long_time went unrecognized in his formally predetermined music . In fact , Boulez ' s description of &quot; Le Visage Nuptial &quot; closely parallels his artistic friendship with John Cage a_few years later , which is traced in the correspondence between the two composers recently published by Cambridge_University Press . Boulez met Cage_in Paris in 1949 , was enchanted , and struck_up an immediate friendship with the composer , who was 13 years his senior and already well known . After Cage returned to New York , an excited correspondence between the two began , with both breathlessly exchanging their ideas about the employment of chance in composition . When he finally visited Cage_in New York in 1952 , however , he found that Cage had moved_in the direction of anarchy . Disenchantment set_in , and Boulez rapidly and unsentimentally ended the correspondence . &quot; When I put it on paper in 1946 , &quot; Boulez recalled of the original version of &quot; Le Visage Nuptial , &quot; &quot; that was just for a small combination of one voice and four instruments . Going_back to this in 1953 , I thought it needs a bigger body of sound to express what I want . But when I did_it , I was in a very austere phase . I forced the score into a kind of straitjacket . I was very inexperienced in orchestration . At the same time I was very dogmatic : ' I want to do this ; I want to do that. ' And finally it was not possible to realize it correctly. &quot; When Boulez first conducted the orchestral score in 1957 in Cologne , Germany , it also happened to be the first time he had faced a large orchestra . While the reviews spoke_of a born conductor , Boulez thought something was very wrong but he says he was too inexperienced to tell if the problem was him as a conductor or composer . When he conducted it again many years later , in the late ' 70s in Paris , he knew . &quot; I stopped after one rehearsal , &quot; he explains . &quot; I thought , ' No , that ' s not possible , I must write it again. ' With the freedom I had acquired and the experience through conducting , I went_back to it with less austerity , and on the contrary I expanded the work quite a lot . But it retains exactly the same frame of action. &quot; The final form of &quot; Le Visage Nuptial &quot; is more complex , more elaborate , &quot; definitely , definitely more sensual , &quot; and less violent , which pretty much characterizes Boulez today . He doesn ' t revert to polemics much anymore because , he says , he doesn ' t have to . He is not outside shouting to get_in . He is the Establishment . Boulez feels that it is not what he wants that has changed , only that years of experience as a composer and conductor and administrator have taught him how to get_it . But experience has not made writing music any faster or easier for Boulez . Among his many projects are finishing the final sections of &quot; . . . explosante / fixe . . . &quot; -- another piece that has been years evolving for years . He has missed several deadlines for the next set of &quot; Notations , &quot; though he promises they will be ready for Chicago , which has programmed a number of Boulez works to celebrate his birthday next season . He has also promised to write an opera , to a libretto by the experimental German playwright Heiner Muller , for Daniel Barenboim to conduct in Berlin . Nor has Boulez lost any of his vision for the future . He maintains close contact with IRCAM and employs its latest technology . He has hand-picked the new music_director of the Ensemble InterContemporain , David Robertson , a young conductor from Malibu , who is little known in the United States . He is involved with a new campus of the Paris Conservatory , where the Ensemble InterContemporain will be in residence and where he is working with architects and acousticians on a new modular concert_hall . And , as he has done all his life , he is lobbying for contemporary music to be a more integral part of contemporary life and thought . He complains that modern concert_halls are old-fashioned , unchanged throughout his lifetime . He wants them more like museums , open long hours , full of resources -- books , scores , records , tapes . He is lobbying for the development of interactive CD-ROMs about contemporary music . He is always listening and glad to conduct new works that interest him . He now pays particular attention to French composers between the ages of 35 and 45 . &quot; They interest me because theirs is a very different approach from my generation . Maybe it is less didactic than we had at their age , therefore it ' s interesting to look_at the way they react . For instance , with some people I have almost 40 years difference . that ' s like me with Stravinsky , approximately 40 years difference , two generations . If I am interested I conduct them. &quot; And that is one more thing that has not changed_over the years with Boulez -- his love for the word interesting . Maybe what he finds interesting has changed , but the word has been , and remains , his highest compliment . * Pierre Boulez will conduct the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. , next Sunday at 2:30 , April 28-30 at 8 p.m. and May 1 at 2:30 . He also will give an open rehearsal Thursday at 10 a.m. For information , call ( 213 ) 850-2000 .</TEXT>
