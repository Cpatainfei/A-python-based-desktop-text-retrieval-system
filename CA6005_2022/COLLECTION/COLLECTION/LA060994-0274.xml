   <HEADLINE> WEST VALLEY FOCUS : CHATSWORTH ; PRIZED MILITARY MEMORABILIA A LINK TO THE PAST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Bruce Herman ' s Chatsworth office is a memorial to a time that is no more . The 35-year-old building owner , who works_out of his home , collects military memorabilia ranging from his favorite collection of Prussian generals ' helmets to a rare drum from the 73rd U.S. Army regiment , an African American unit that served in the Civil War . &quot; Honor was such a prized virtue then , &quot; Herman said of the Civil War era . &quot; You had men fighting to be the color_bearer and carry the flag even though the chances of being killed were great. &quot; Herman began his collection at age 10 when his grandfather -- who he describes as his best childhood friend -- began taking him to flea_markets . His grandfather told Herman war stories he ' d heard from gunfighters and Civil War soldiers he ' d known as a child and from his own grandfather , a Prussian soldier . Herman ' s ancestry is part of the reason for his love of Prussian memorabilia . His great-great-grandfather served in the Franco-Prussian War , fought from 1870 to 1871 . He also graduated first in his blacksmith class and received a pocket_watch that has been handed_down to Herman . Herman ' s collection of Prussian and Bavarian generals ' helmets are enclosed in a 6-by-6-foot glass case in his office . A mid-19th Century Prussian regimental flag with hand-embroidered silver thread serves as a backdrop for the display . Herman said he hears about items for_sale by word_of_mouth and by meeting collectors at military antique shows . Herman said he searches for items that haven ' t been restored , repainted or repaired . &quot; You can go_out and buy junk all day long , &quot; Herman said . &quot; One of the main things to a serious collector is purity. &quot; Last July , Herman went_on a relic hunt at a Revolutionary War camp in central New York . Using a metal detector , he found knife_blades , belt_buckles , a solid silver British coin and a 70-caliber musket_ball . Though Herman , a self-described frustrated curator , derives great pleasure from collecting , he said he also feels an obligation to try to preserve history . TERESA ANN WILLIS</TEXT>
