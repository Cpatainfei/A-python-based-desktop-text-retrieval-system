   <HEADLINE> IRA TRUCE REPORTEDLY NEAR , PUTTING PROTESTANTS ON EDGE ; NORTHERN_IRELAND : PRO-BRITISH MAJORITY FEARS UNION WITH SOUTH . BUT IRISH LEADER SEES ' NEW BEGINNING. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Reports that the IRA is about to call a cease-fire after a quarter-century of bloodshed put nerves on edge Tuesday in Northern_Ireland ' s majority Protestant community . Expectations of a breakthrough rose as the United States granted single-entry visas to veteran Irish_Republican_Army member Joseph Cahill and Patrick Treanor , a member of Sinn Fein , the IRA ' s political wing . Arriving in New York , Cahill said it was a private visit . But State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the visas were issued &quot; to enable Sinn Fein officials to garner support in the United States for an end to the violence in Northern Ireland. &quot; In Dublin , Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds declared , &quot; I believe we are poised for peace and in a very short time we will be able to make an entirely new beginning on this island. &quot; It was Reynolds ' most upbeat assessment of the conflict in Northern_Ireland since he and British Prime_Minister John Major unveiled their Downing Street Declaration peace blueprint Dec . 15 . That enthusiasm was not shared_in Protestant districts of Belfast , where any agreement acceptable to the IRA is automatically suspect . &quot; Sure , the_English want rid_of us . They ' ll do a deal with the IRA if the loyalist people let them . But we won ' t let them , &quot; said Jimmy Creighton , a Protestant community worker in Belfast ' s pro-British Glencairn district . But Reynolds sought to reassure anxious Protestant political_leaders and wary extremist groups that the peace plan would not force them into a union with Ireland , the goal of the IRA and Sinn Fein . In the December blueprint , the_British and Irish governments agreed that there would be no change in Northern_Ireland ' s status without the consent of a majority of its people . They also said Sinn Fein could not participate in peace talks unless the IRA permanently halted violence . Speculation about an imminent truce became intense after Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said Monday that he had met with IRA leaders and told them the time was right to &quot; break the political , constitutional and military stalemate and create the potential to eradicate the underlying causes of conflict. &quot; Speculation had swirled that a truce was likely to be declared late Tuesday or today . Most commentators predicted a temporary or indefinite truce , but a growing minority said the IRA might take the plunge London and Dublin have demanded and declare its 25-year-old war over . Preacher-politician Ian Paisley warned that any sellout of the pro-British community would propel Northern_Ireland into civil_war -- after a guerrilla conflict that has killed more_than 3 # 200 people . The IRA ' s last major truce , in 1975 , was partly brought_down by a campaign of killings by Protestants determined to end any British dialogue with Republicans .</TEXT>
