   <HEADLINE> LINDA FELDMAN ; AFTER 20 YEARS , HE ' S MAKING HOUSE CALLS AGAIN AT VENICE CLINIC</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Some people navigate their way through life plotting every step . By contrast , Dr. Bill Holden is an explorer of the opportunities that come his way . Consider how he first got involved 20 years ago with the Venice Family Clinic , a nonprofit group that offers free health_care to the poor . &quot; Phil Rossman , who started the clinic , called me , &quot; Holden says . &quot; After a_few minutes on the phone , he said , ' Oh , by the way , ' and starts to explain why he started the clinic . I remember thinking that I don ' t want to know about it . I told him I hope it ' s a success and was ready to get_off the phone and he tells me he ' s having a problem getting doctors. &quot; Holden agreed to come the following week after work . At the time , he was a 60-and-something internist with a thriving Beverly Hills practice of 20 years . Then , the Venice Family Clinic functioned only at night because during the day the premises were used by the UCLA dental_school . It had two volunteer nurses , two doctors , a pharmacist and a closet with cardboard boxes filled with doctor ' s medical samples that were collected by volunteers from physicians in the area . &quot; The nurse took me to one of the examining rooms which , of course , had a dental chair in the middle of it , &quot; Holden recalls . &quot; I sat_down and a 10-year-old comes_in . His eyes were popping_out of his head . He had Graves disease . I asked him , ' How long have you been_sick ? ' and he said , ' Two years. ' He had never been to a doctor . It really bothered me that a kid this age with a terrible problem went untreated . It really disturbed me and because of that I came_back regularly. &quot; Holden admits there were many nights over the next eight months when he was so exhausted he didn ' t want to go_to the clinic . But he knew people counted_on him and he went anyway . Then one night the nurse broke the news that he was the only doctor on_duty . &quot; I told her I couldn ' t handle the whole clinic myself and tried to leave , &quot; he said . &quot; There were 25 people waiting , some for three hours . So I stayed , saw all_the patients and arrived home after midnight . That was it . I was finished . I kissed the place goodby. &quot; But now , two decades later , Holden is back . After selling his practice three years ago , he realized he still wanted to be a doctor . So he began volunteering again at the family clinic . A lot has changed at the Venice Family Clinic , which is now housed in a new 18 # 000-square-foot facility serving 12 # 000 patients per year . Five-hundred physicians donate their time . &quot; I couldn ' t believe it , &quot; Holden said . &quot; Beautiful building and full-time doctors. &quot; Holden feels that the most important factor_in being a doctor is to like people . &quot; Most doctors dislike people , &quot; he says . &quot; can ' t wait to get_rid_of them . The good doctors are the ones who like people , the lousy ones don ' t. &quot; When Holden sees patients at the clinic he uses the same procedures he used when he was in practice . He brings them into the consulting room first and chats rather than have them wait for him wearing a paper wrap , uncomfortably perched on an examining table . Says Holden : &quot; The most important thing is treating people well. &quot; Bill Holden can ' t remember when he decided to become a doctor . He says it was not when , at the age of 17 , he lost his mother to a botched surgery or , six months later , when his father died of a heart_attack . As a kid growing_up in New York City there was only one thing which occupied him completely : playing baseball . If it weren ' t for his older brother , he says , he probably would n ' t have gone_to college . They took the subway to New York University to enroll him there but the lines were too long , so they took the train to Long_Island University , which he attended for two years until someone told him about Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia . He spent six years there , getting undergraduate and medical degrees , and returned to New York for a residency at Flower Fifth_Avenue Hospital . Over the years , Holden has taken time_out to explore countries unlikely to appear on a Club Med brochure . that ' s thanks largely to his wife , Ruth , a dedicated traveler who has taken him to Afghanistan , Borneo , China , India , Nepal , Viet Nam and Iran . Says Ruth : &quot; I usually talk him into it and then he loves it. &quot; Bill Holden has no complaints about life . Patients from 25 years ago still call him and seek his advice , he attends lectures and accompanies physicians on their rounds at Cedars Hospital -- and he sees patients at the Venice Family Clinic . Says Holden : &quot; I ' m very pleased to go_over there . When I leave I ' ve done something , accomplished something . It sounds highfalutin , but I feel I ' m paying_back what the public did for me. &quot;</TEXT>
