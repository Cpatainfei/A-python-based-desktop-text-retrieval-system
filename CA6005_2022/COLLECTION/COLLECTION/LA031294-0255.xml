   <HEADLINE> PUPILS ' EXPOSURE TO HIGH ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS ENRAGES PARENTS ; HEALTH : TRANSFORMER MAY HAVE SUBJECTED A TEACHER AND 33 KINDERGARTNERS TO POTENTIAL HAZARD , REPORT SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Parents of kindergarten students at Dixie Canyon Avenue Elementary School reacted with rage and tears Friday to a report that a school transformer had exposed their children to strong electromagnetic fields -- the subject of a scientific debate as a cause of cancer . A group of about 30 parents were told that an electrical transformer outside a bungalow classroom may have exposed 33 kindergartners and their teacher to the electromagnetic field , often shortened to EMF . Many in the group complained that it had taken the Los Angeles Unified School District more_than three months to inform parents and teachers of the potential danger . EMFs are present wherever an electric_current passes_through a wire . Several scientific studies have found a small increase in cancer rates among children living near high-current power_lines and among workers in occupations involving electricity , such_as utility line_workers and film projectionists . A smaller number of studies have found no connection , and scientists generally say a causal link between EMF and cancer has not been proven . Gathering_in the Dixie Canyon school ' s library , the parents heard a presentation by Winifred Yancy , a Los Angeles Department of Water and Power electrical_engineer who described results of a December study of the transformer ' s electromagnetic field . The study reported that the highest EMF reading -- taken at the teacher ' s chair -- was 107 milligauss . While there is no agreement on what magnetic_field exposure level -- if any -- poses a health risk , some experts have said the safe level is as low as 1 milligauss , the level that would be detected about a foot from an electric toaster in_use . EMF strengths fall_off sharply with distance from the electrical source . Neither the school district nor the DWP have guidelines for acceptable levels of EMFs . &quot; I ' m overwhelmed , &quot; said kindergarten teacher Chris Chan , fighting_back tears . &quot; Why didn ' t they let us know ? I ' ve been sitting in that chair . I don ' t want to be a statistic . I want to see my grandchildren. &quot; Yancy used an analogy to illustrate the difficulty in proving a causal link between EMFs and health_problems . &quot; A rooster crows and the temperature rises , &quot; she said . &quot; We know that the sunrise causes both events . But a crowing rooster does not cause the sun to rise. &quot; But many parents were not convinced . &quot; I ' m livid , &quot; said Jeff Fried of Sherman Oaks , who has a daughter in the class . &quot; There are no studies that say chocolate_milk causes cancer . But a number of studies say there is a relationship between electromagnetic fields and cancer. &quot; The issue was raised in late September when Fried approached the school with a concern about the proximity of several transformers -- which convert electrical voltage from 480-volt high power transmission_lines to the 120-volt domestic standard -- to the wall of the kindergarten room . School administrators informed the district and DWP took the readings Dec . 6 . District officials said a number of factors , including winter vacation and the Northridge earthquake , prevented them from getting the results of the survey to the school before Friday . &quot; I don ' t know what happened , &quot; said James Matte , who works for the district ' s office of environmental health and safety . &quot; It was a breakdown in communication . that ' s the best way to describe it. &quot; Diane Doi , director of the district ' s environmental health and safety department , which assigns EMF studies , said one other school , Mayall Street Elementary in North Hills , had high EMF levels detected last year , but the problem was corrected with fencing around the transformers to keep children at a safe distance . &quot; As far as I know , it was just one other school , &quot; Doi said . &quot; It was an isolated case. &quot; But Mike Loveridge , a facilities director for the district , said there are many transformers located next to classrooms . &quot; It depends_on the configuration of the building -- it ' s not uncommon , &quot; said Loveridge . &quot; We ' ve got them everywhere. &quot; Doi said representatives from her department will meet with maintenance officials to formulate a districtwide plan to look_into EMF levels . In the meantime , district officials plan to move a portable classroom to the Dixie Canyon campus by Monday and transfer kindergarten students to a temporary classroom until the new one is ready .</TEXT>
