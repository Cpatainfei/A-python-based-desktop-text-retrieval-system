   <HEADLINE> GUNMAN SLAIN BY UTAH DEPUTY WHO SLIPPED IN WITH HOSTAGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A gunman carrying a crude bomb took 18 people hostage Saturday at the Salt_Lake_City Library , then was fatally shot by a deputy who had snuck in among the hostages . Salt Lake County sheriff ' s Lt . Lloyd Prescott was teaching a class for police_officers in a room next to the one where the gunman took the hostages , Lt . Marty Vuyk said . &quot; He made a super move . He became the last hostage by walking in the room and closing the door behind him , &quot; Vuyk said . Prescott was dressed in a sweat_suit . He identified himself as a sheriff ' s officer after the gunman told the hostages to draw lots , apparently to determine the order in which they would be killed , said Salt Lake County Sheriff Aaron Kennard . The gunman swung his gun on Prescott and the deputy then shot him four times in the chest and wrestled him to the ground , Kennard said . None of the hostages were hurt . Two SWAT team members received minor cuts from broken glass as they rushed into the room . The gunman , identified as Clifford Lynn Draper , died at LDS Hospital , Vuyk said . The 5 1 / 2-hour ordeal began just after a group of Tibetan Buddhist monks had dismantled an intricate sand_painting they had created over four days at the library . The monks , who live_in exile in India , were to scatter the painting and throw its grains into the nearby Jordan_River . They were not taken hostage . The man leaped onto a table , pulled_out a handgun and announced : &quot; Have a nice life . Mine ' s probably over , &quot; witnesses said . Radio_station KSL quoted witnesses as saying the gunman told them he had a bomb &quot; big enough to blow_up the whole building. &quot; The man was holding a hair-curling iron with wires leading into a shoulder_bag , witness Jan Carlston said . The man held the curling iron open and threatened that the bomb would go_off if he closed it , Carlston added . The curling iron did not set_off the bomb , which was later detonated in the library by a bomb squad . During telephone negotiations with police , Vuyk said , Draper demanded money , an audience with Salt_Lake_City Police_Chief Ruben Ortega and a pardon from President Clinton . Ortega was in Arizona . Some people managed to escape as the gunman herded the hostages to the room on the second floor . Hostage Carl Robinson said Prescott suddenly showed_up as they were being herded into the room . &quot; I said : ' Get_out of here. ' He said : ' It ' s OK . I ' m with the sheriff ' s department , ' &quot; Robinson said . Draper gave a sealed letter he wanted mailed to the local Deseret News to the head Buddhist monk , who had followed the group to the second floor . The monk , who does not speak English , didn ' t know what to do with the letter and gave it to Robinson . The gunman let Robinson go free so he could mail the letter and let the monk go_with him . Robinson told police that the deputy was among the hostages .</TEXT>
