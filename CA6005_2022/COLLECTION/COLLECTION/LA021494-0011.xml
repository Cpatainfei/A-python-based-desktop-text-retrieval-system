   <TEXT> The dramatic increase in ridership on the Metrolink commuter rail system during the weeks after the Northridge earthquake is proof positive that every cloud has a silver_lining . Since the Northridge earthquake , our entire nation is talking_about Metrolink . Secretary_of_Transportation Federico Pena has continually praised the Metrolink system , stating that Metrolink is the perfect example of what works well in the time of a crisis . Additionally , he applauded Metrolink ' s successful efforts in opening_up three new stations in one week ' s time to accommodate all_the people who work in the Burbank , Glendale and downtown Los Angeles area . Fortunately for Orange County residents , on March 28 , Orange County ' s commuter rail service will join the Metrolink system with three daily round-trip train trips from Oceanside to downtown Los Angeles . Trains will stop at San Juan Capistrano , Irvine , Orange , Santa Ana , Anaheim , Fullerton and the City of Commerce before arriving in Los Angeles . Five more stations will open throughout the next two years . These future stations will be located in San Clemente , Laguna Niguel / Mission Viejo , Tustin , Buena Park and Norwalk . Additionally , the Orange County Transportation Authority is working_on implementing commuter rail from Riverside to Irvine . Metrolink predicts that about 2 # 000 riders from Orange County will use the new service when it opens in March . Like riders on other Metrolink routes , Orange County passengers may transfer free to a variety of other transit systems , including the Metro Red_Line subway in downtown Los Angeles . The Orange County Transportation Authority is rerouting commuter buses to serve the Metrolink stations along the route within Orange County . Last month ' s earthquake definitively demonstrated that Metrolink needs to be one of the many options available to Orange County commuters . In addition to a comprehensive commuter rail system , transit ways , express_buses and feeder bus systems will be implemented soon . Transportation demand management strategies such_as alternative work hours and telecommuting ( using telecommunications technology to connect workers to the main_office from their home or from a satellite office close to their home ) also need to be employed to augment existing efforts . Urban rail , as opposed to the Metrolink commuter rail system , provides local transit service throughout the day at frequent intervals with trains stopping at stations spaced a mile apart . Urban rail may be a good long-term solution to Orange County ' s transportation needs . The OCTA board of directors is being appropriately cautious , however , because there is a limited amount of funds available for urban rail . Furthermore , a determination must be made as_to whether there will be sufficient ridership to support an urban rail system . Still , an increasing concentration of jobs and higher residential densities within the county ' s urban core -- coupled with high volumes of traffic along the connecting corridors -- indicate that urban rail may be an appropriate long-term solution to traffic congestion . We also must_not forget those residents of Orange County who depend_on public_transit for their transportation . For the past 20 years , a fixed-route bus_service has been the foundation of Orange County ' s transit system . As county demographic patterns shift over the next 30 years , and as solo driving becomes more difficult and expensive , bus ridership is expected to go_up . One way to meet that increasing demand would be to gradually increase the amount of local bus_service the Orange County Transportation Authority offers . When the voters of Orange County approved Measure M , the half-cent sales tax , they called_for a comprehensive transportation plan to guide the county through today ' s transportation problems and to provide a balanced multimodal transportation network that we can now build_on for the future . The aftermath of the earthquake underscores the importance of this comprehensive plan . The aftermath also underscores the importance of a transportation plan that is so sufficiently comprehensive that it can reroute commuters around severed links in case part of the system fails . To guarantee mobility before , during and after a crisis , we have to refocus our policy on the safe and efficient movement of people , not just vehicles . Orange County ' s economic and environmental health are closely tied to its transportation infrastructure . By creating systems that are flexible and efficiently move people , goods , information and services , we can maximize the area ' s productivity and quality_of_life , and minimize environmental deterioration .</TEXT>
