   <HEADLINE> ' JUSTIFIABLE PARANOIA ' AFFLICTS LAWYERS , PSYCHOLOGIST SAYS ; STRESS : HE TRIES TO TEACH ATTORNEYS HOW TO DEAL WITH PROBLEMS THEY FACE , INCLUDING PUBLIC REVULSION , DEPRESSION , DIVORCE , ALCOHOLISM , DRUG_ADDICTION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Fifteen years ago , when Paul Messing told people he worked as a public_defender , he felt_pride . Today , he feels_like a pariah . &quot; You feel_like everybody is out_to get you , &quot; said Messing , the deputy chief of the Philadelphia public_defender ' s office . &quot; And you live it ; you live it 24 hours a day. &quot; Amiram Elwork has heard it before . Lawyers comprise half of his psychology practice in suburban Philadelphia . He has seen the effects of the stress Messing has felt : depression , divorce , suicide , anger , alcoholism , drug_addiction and a mental problem he calls &quot; justifiable paranoia. &quot; Rather than treat the problems once they have taken a toll , Elwork has begun addressing them before they occur . He has taught a course at the Widener University School_of_Law in Wilmington , Del. , called &quot; Non-Legal Challenges in the Law Practice. &quot; &quot; It ' s not your imagination that someone is out_to get you all_the time , &quot; Elwork said . Widener , where Elwork is director of the Law-Psychology Graduate Program , has billed the course as the only one of its kind offered in any law_school curriculum . On the first day of class , Elwork doused his 15 eager students with harsh realities of practicing law . He told them about several studies that found attorneys suffer from depression and substance_abuse at twice the national average . He told them associates often work 60-hour weeks to fulfill their billing requirements . He told them that by the year 2000 there will be one attorney for every 300 people ; if they get a job , it probably will not pay what they expected . They will work in a politically charged , bottom line-oriented environment that will not leave time for the intellectual musing they enjoy in law_school , he said . Their mistakes would be considered monumental . He talked_about the burnout , the disillusionment , the dissatisfaction , the lack of vacations and society ' s general dislike of lawyers . &quot; He laid it on thick , &quot; said Laura Wampler , a third-year student . &quot; I thought , ' Why didn ' t we take this class first year when we could have gotten_out of this ? ' &quot; On the second day of class , Elwork began to show the students how to avoid becoming one of the statistics . &quot; I was startled at first , &quot; said Kathy Banfield , a fourth-year evening student . &quot; But by the end of the class I said , ' This won ' t happen to me . I ' m prepared. ' &quot; No one in the class dropped_out of law_school , as far as Elwork knows . But they re-examined what area of the law they wanted to practice after learning about the strong_points of their personalities and the compatibility with various practices . &quot; It was a little frightening to see how naive the students were , &quot; said Ann Britton , a law professor at Widener who monitored the class . Before entering a practice , Cathy Sikorski did not have the insights Elwork offers his students . She quit practicing law after nine years . She said she never thought she would &quot; save the world , &quot; but she also said she never understood the workaholic environment of law . As time went_on , Sikorski began to doubt she wanted to spend the rest of her life focused almost solely on work . Five years ago , she opened_up her own business in her Pottstown home . &quot; People still say , ' You ' ll go back. ' . . . They can ' t understand giving_up a career like that , that there could be anything bigger or better , &quot; she said . The time and effort it takes_to first become a lawyer prevents many who are dissatisfied from leaving the profession . &quot; All of this happens gradually , &quot; said Philadelphia lawyer Neil Perloff . &quot; By the time you realize it ' s happening , you ' ve created a career for yourself . You also get a feeling that maybe you can change things . You see you can ' t and it impacts on your psyche . Then , it becomes to late. &quot; Many lawyers think their only alternative is to quit . Until the profession itself changes , Elwork often helps them find ways that they can continue to practice , but in a less stressful environment . &quot; Anyone who is concerned about justice , &quot; he said , &quot; should be concerned about this issue. &quot;</TEXT>
