   <HEADLINE> BY DESIGN ; SHOPPERS ' SPECIAL ; NEW TREATMENTS MAY CURB SHOPPING BINGES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> People joke about the need for a shopping fix , but it ' s not funny to everyone . Compulsive shopping affects up_to 6 % of all Americans , mostly women , with perhaps 3 million on the brink of bankruptcy , divorce or both as a result of severe addictions . Now , a small corps of experts studying the disorder has drawn_up a compulsive-shopper profile and has found that antidepressants and other mood-modifying drugs can curb the urge . The typical compulsive shopper is a 36-year-old woman who , at about age 17 , developed the habit of scooping_up clothes , shoes , jewelry and / or makeup that often go unused , says Dr. Gary Christenson of the University of Minnesota . He and his colleagues compared 24 compulsive shoppers to 24 people with normal spending patterns , discovering that the compulsive shoppers were more likely to report substance_abuse , eating disorders , depression and anxiety . Their findings were published this year in the Journal of Clinical Psychiatry . A drug called fluvoxamine , developed to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and not yet approved in the United States , looks promising as a compulsive-shopping treatment , says Dr. Donald W . Black of the University of Iowa College of Medicine . He is leading an eight-week manufacturer-sponsored study of the drug ' s effects on 10 shoppers . So far , he has given it to six women . &quot; Everybody improved , &quot; Black says . &quot; After four or five weeks on the medicine , they were doing well. &quot; They reported fewer shopping urges and ultimately stopped their compulsive shopping . The drug is believed to work , Black says , by increasing the brain chemical serotonin , which in turn decreases compulsive behavior . But once the drug is withdrawn , the problem seems to resurface . &quot; Three women are off the medicine now and it appears as though they are relapsing , &quot; says Black , who speculates that treatment must be ongoing . In another study led by Dr. Susan McElroy of the University of Cincinnati , a variety of antidepressants and similar drugs helped quell the shopping urge for nine out of 13 compulsive shoppers , at least temporarily . Fluoxetine ( Prozac ) and sertraline ( Zoloft ) were among the antidepressants given by the researchers , whose findings were published in the American Journal of Clinical Psychiatry .</TEXT>
