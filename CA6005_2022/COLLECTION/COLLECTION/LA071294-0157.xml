   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; DOLLAR FALLS AGAINST MARK , YEN ; DOW OFF ; MARKETS : ANALYSTS BLAME G-7 INACTION FOR THE WEAKNESS IN U.S. CURRENCY . YIELDS ON 30-YEAR TREASURY_BONDS RISE TO 7.73 % .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The dollar plunged Monday to its lowest level against the German mark since October , 1992 , and hit a new post-World War II low against the Japanese yen , after the United States and its allies failed to devise a plan to stabilize the greenback . Meanwhile , Treasury_bond yields rose across the board , amid expectations that economic reports due out this week will show faster growth and rising inflation -- leading to another Federal_Reserve_Board rate hike . A jump in oil and other commodity prices also hurt bonds . However , U.S. stocks closed only marginally lower Monday , largely ignoring the turmoil in bonds and currencies for a second consecutive session . The dollar ' s latest plunge took center stage in the markets : In New York , the dollar plummeted to 1.530 German marks from 1.563 on Friday and briefly traded at a 21-month low of 1.518 marks . Against the yen , the dollar closed at 97.75 , compared to 98.05 on Friday . The dollar dipped for the first time below 97 yen about midday , but it recovered later on concerns about the leadership succession in North_Korea and Japan ' s uncertain political situation . For most of the day , currency traders took their cue from the apparent lack of interest among the Group of Seven industrial nations to support the U.S. currency . The G-7 leaders concluded their annual summit Sunday in Naples , Italy , without unveiling a plan to rescue the dollar and without expressing any particular concern over its alarming decline . Traders said the leaders ' inaction confirmed the market ' s worst suspicion that the industrial nations did not perceive the defense of the U.S. currency as a major concern . Dealers said trading volume was fairly light as few large banks entered the market , exacerbating the dollar ' s downward trajectory against European currencies . Much of the activity was speculative , they said . The renewed selling in the bond market also hurt the dollar . Yields rose again , after rocketing Friday when the government reported strong job growth in June . The yield on the Treasury ' s 30-year bond rose to 7.73 % from 7.69 % on Friday , and it now is the highest since the fall of 1992 . Shorter-term yields also jumped sharply : The Treasury sold new three-month bills Monday at an average discount_rate of 4.50 % , up from 4.31 % last week and the highest in nearly three years . The surge in short-term yields suggested that investors expect the Fed to officially boost short rates soon , for what would be the fifth time this year . Michelle Laughlin , economist at the Sanwa Securities unit of Tokyo-based Sanwa Bank Ltd. , said market participants worldwide are worried that the Fed hasn ' t raised interest_rates fast enough this year to curb economic_growth and potential inflation . &quot; All market indexes right now signal a Fed policy that ' s too accommodative , &quot; Laughlin said . &quot; The Fed is behind the curve in fighting inflation. &quot; Still , analysts described bond_trading as light in_advance of government reports on June producer inflation today and on June consumer inflation Wednesday . The surprise in the markets Monday was Wall_Street ' s relative resilience despite bond and dollar markets ' losses : The Dow Jones industrials eased just 6.15 points to 3 # 702.99 , recovering on late buying from a session low of 3 # 681 . Declining issues outnumbered advancers by just 9 to 8 on the New York Stock_Exchange on light Big Board volume of 222.97 million shares . Most broad market indexes also were off only slightly . Despite the factors weighing_on stocks , optimism among some investors over second-quarter corporate profit reports kept a floor under the market , said William LeFevre , market_analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum . Also , a good showing overnight in Tokyo and in European markets , despite tensions over North_Korea ' s crisis , may have lent support to U.S. stocks . In Tokyo , the Nikkei index eased just 53.42 points to 20 # 473.09. In Frankfurt , the DAX index gained 14.81 points to 2 # 065.66 , while London ' s FTSE-100 index added 21.4 points to 2 # 983.8. Mexico_City ' s Bolsa index lost 22.77 points to 2 # 292.00. U.S. stocks were also able shake_off another jump in key commodity prices Monday . Coffee prices rocketed above $ 2 a pound to 8 1 / 2-years highs after another killer frost struck Brazil ' s coffee-growing regions . September coffee futures soared 47 cents to $ 2.35 per pound at the Coffee , Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York . In other commodity trading , crude_oil prices leaped above $ 20 a barrel for the first time in three weeks because of concerns about politically oriented labor strikes hampering Nigeria ' s oil_production . August crude_oil roared ahead by 70 cents to $ 20.18 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange . Traders said the contract was poised to test 16-month highs of $ 20.95 hit last month . But to break that level , traders said a strike scheduled for Tuesday by Nigeria ' s senior grade oil workers would have to cripple the country ' s exports . In addition , U.S. crude_oil inventories would have to remain at relatively low levels . Gold followed oil and coffee higher . July gold futures gained $ 3 to $ 387.10 an ounce on the New York Commodities_Exchange . Less Yen for the Dollar How the dollar has sunk versus the Japanese yen recently . Daily closes_in New York : Monday : 97.75 yen , down 0.30 Source : Bloomberg Business News</TEXT>
