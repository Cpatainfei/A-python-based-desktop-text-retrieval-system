   <HEADLINE> EL TORO IDEAS OTHER THAN AIRPORT NEEDED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> * What if the Orange County Board of Supervisors took a fresh look_at the conversion of the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station ? City governments are obviously split over its future . Citizens are lining_up on each side of the issue as if there were no alternatives between an international airport or residential / commercial use of the site . Business_leaders are threatening to float an initiative . It ' s time for the board to come_up with a shopping list of alternatives so that the issue is not permanently polarized . What if all small propeller-driven aircraft were moved_out of John Wayne Airport and moved to one of the shorter runways at El Toro ? The mixture of small airplanes making their base turn_into the final approach of 757s at JWA is an explosive mixture waiting for a match . The Cerritos disaster and the recent crash at the approach to John Wayne Airport are ample proof that a major disaster is awaiting us . What if the money spent to build a new Riley Terminal and all_the other related airport support features at El Toro was spent to build a rapid rail system ? This high-speed system could connect John Wayne to an El Toro transportation facility , and then run to George or Norton AFB where a commercial airport is desired . The Santa Ana River is a possible route for part of this rail_line , as are other existing rights_of_way . What if the runway at JWA was extended like LAX so that all_of the existing facilities of JWA could be used for an international airport ? Does_it really make_sense to re-create all_of them seven miles away at El Toro ? What if 20 years after the main runway at El Toro were destroyed , a quiet hypersonic aircraft was developed ? How stupid would we feel ? What if we took an idea from Monaco or Long_Beach , and ran a profitable race_car event once a year at a course designed around the taxiways and runways of El Toro ? What if the federal_government exercises its right to replace the Marine station with another government_agency because we were not mature enough or unselfish enough to do our best for the Orange County of the future ? SCOTT DENNISON San Juan Capistrano * It is distressing to see how Orange County is being split between the North County cities with their Lincoln ( Club ) financial empire and the South County cities that are contiguous to and will be impacted by the El Toro closure , touted for a new commercial airport . El Toro is just ( seven ) miles from John Wayne Airport , which is serving the area adequately . Practical and technical feasibility is being swept_under_the_rug by the subjective and highly emotional pie-in-the-sky allegations of improved lifestyle . For whom ? Certainly not the nearby residents who will be faced with the thunderous roar of super-cargo and passenger planes at all hours of the day and night . Now these high-powered and richly financed commercial airport proponents are trying to take the_matter out of the hands of the established and well-represented study commission by their petition drive . Don ' t be misled by their devious petition drive . DICK OSTERLIND Laguna Hills * The runaways at the El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station are not suitable for commercial or cargo aircraft , but this fact seems to have fallen on the deaf ears of the Lincoln Club and the North County cities . Neither the military nor most of the airlines can visualize such a conversion . They agree with Laguna Beach resident Charles J . Quilter II , a captain for a major airline and a veteran military flier for the past 33 years . Having thoroughly researched the field with which he is familiar , he concludes as follows : &quot; A key factor concerning El Toro ' s use as a commercial airport involves significant differences in takeoff procedures between airliners and tactical military jets . At El Toro , the main takeoff runways slope uphill and point to rising terrain , frequently accompanied by an unacceptable tail wind . The high performance of modern jets helps to overcome these limitations . This is not the case with airline transports who operate under civil regulations which demand certain minimum performances . One of these regulations requires airliners to be able to climb out safely with an engine_failure just before liftoff . It follows then that transports must be lightly loaded . To accomplish this , either fuel loads or passenger loads must be sacrificed . A great way to begin an international_flight ! Are there alternatives ? Yes , if you want to take_off into the teeth of John Wayne airport traffic ; are willing to impact the new residential sections with noise decibels of a new dimension ; can change the area ' s air traffic_control procedures ; are willing to suspend takeoffs at El Toro while an aircraft is_on approach . Under instrument rules , this can reduce the hourly capacity of the airport by a factor of five to 10 . An airport that can only handle relatively few arrivals and departures per hour does not have much commercial potential . If , and after the Marines leave , its best use as an airport may be for general aviation purposes . ELIZABETH H . QUILTER Laguna Beach * It was good news that a majority of the supervisors will not support an initiative proposal by the Lincoln Club to allow voters to decide whether El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station should be converted to a commercial airport . So far the supervisors have only stopped or not supported different options . When are they going_to show any leadership ? A real solution was proposed by Larry Agran ( Times commentary , Feb . 6 ) . Why has no elected official adopted , or even adapted , his brilliant proposal of an El Toro / Irvine Co . land swap ? KAY HUNTER Lake Forest * There have been heated discussions regarding what to do with the El Toro base after closing it to further military use . There are some who think the only thing to do with the base is to develop it into a commercial airport . Those who are supporting this idea do not know what they are talking_about . I have spent some 30 years in the aviation business as an airport and terminal planner for major international airlines . The conversion of El Toro into a commercial airport is &quot; not in the cards &quot; due_to many reasons , including the following : 1 . Due_to the status of economics among all airlines in today ' s market , their support of rental rates and landing fees for another airport within the close vicinity of John Wayne , Long_Beach and Ontario would be unlikely . Garden Grove and Stanton should support their closest neighboring airport , Long_Beach 2 . The runway configuration and runway usage would have to be modified to satisfy the requirements of commercial aircraft , due_to taxiway / ramp weights and take-offs and landings . Modifications would require major funding by the airlines , FAA and airport commission . Airliners require longer and thicker runways than existing at El Toro . Rather than attempt to obtain support to convert El Toro to a commercial airport , let us look_to conversion of El Toro to a more useful and needed complex that will not only benefit but enhance the entire county . Please consider the following suggestions : 1 . Transportation Center : The need for a transportation center in this location should justify conversion of some of the site to this function . Nearby location of Amtrak , and both interstates 5 and 405 would provide an excellent South County transportation interchange . 2 . New Orange County Fairgrounds : The location of the base is a very good center for the fairgrounds : Existing aircraft hangers could be reconfigured as buildings to house exhibits . 3 . Racetrack : Construction of a horse racetrack , to supplement other southern California racetracks . 4 . Construction of a theater of performing arts and amphitheater facilities may be a good community addition to this area . 5 . Sports center : A major_league sports center could possibly be utilized by the Los Angeles Raiders . Again , the thought of turning the base over to a commercial airport is totally unfounded , since the airline industry is suffering great losses and the industry could not support another airport in Orange County . C . ROY MILLER Mission Viejo * Here are a_few facts about the noise at El Toro from someone who does not live_in Santa Ana or La Habra , but near the landing_approach . The base , which most of the time operates under restricted hours , has less than 300 landings and takeoffs on the average day . The amount of loud_noise has been estimated at only 20 minutes per day . Most of the time there is little activity on weekends , and the airfield is closed on holidays for two , three or four days in a row . In comparison John Wayne Airport handles about 1 # 200 arrivals and departures each day , and about 240 are commercial carriers subjected_to the 10 p.m.-7 a.m. curfew . the remaining 960 are part of general aviation and do not have to abide_by that curfew . Now if you think single-engine planes are not noisy , you have not been along Newport Boulevard in Costa Mesa . The residents there are getting the bulk of that air traffic 24 hours a day ; or in Buena Park west of the Fullerton Airport -- they are nerve wrecking ! Sure the Marine jets can be loud at times , and on a one-on-one basis they probably are noisier ! But the volume and frequency of aircraft generating noise at El Toro with a civilian airport will be devastating . NICOLAS G . DZIPINA Aliso Viejo</TEXT>
