   <HEADLINE> AFGHANISTAN RINGS IN THE NEW YEAR WITH HEAVIEST FIGHTING IN 6 MONTHS ; VIOLENCE : HOSPITALS REPORT EIGHT DEAD AND 250 INJURED . WEEK-OLD CEASE-FIRE IS ANOTHER CASUALTY OF CIVIL WAR .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Afghanistan ' s armed rivals rang in 1994 with the heaviest fighting in Kabul in more_than six months , showering hundreds of rocket and artillery shells onto the divided , battered capital Saturday despite a cease-fire signed a week ago . The two main hospitals in the city reported that eight dead and 250 injured had been brought_in since the bombardment began at dawn , the_British news_agency Reuters reported . But heavy fighting prevented many injured from seeking assistance , and the total casualty toll was not known . After first_light , the rattle of firearms echoed through streets deserted save for tanks and armed men . Plumes of smoke marked the landing spots of shells and rockets , which rained_down especially heavily on northern and eastern neighborhoods of the city ringed by the rugged Hindu Kush . In the year and a half since Muslim rebels took power from the Communists , internecine fighting in Afghanistan has left at least 10 # 000 people dead , many of them civilians . In Kabul , buildings and much of the infrastructure left unscathed by 14 years of civil_war have been devastated . The major combatants have been troops loyal to President Burhanuddin Rabbani and forces aligned with Prime_Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar . In a statement released in the Pakistani border city of Peshawar , Rabbani claimed that Hekmatyar has now joined forces with Abdul Rashid Dostum , a powerful ex-Communist general , to try to oust him . &quot; The Communists want to undo the fruits of the jihad ( holy war ) &quot; fought by U.S.-backed Muslim insurgents against the Soviet-supported Najibullah regime , presidential spokesman Bahauddin Ziayi told the Associated Press . That development could have serious implications indeed for Rabbani , for whom Dostum ' s support has been crucial . The general , with relatively few men and the handicaps of being an ethnic Uzbek and a former Communist to boot , has few chances to emerge as supreme leader . But Dostum holds much of northern Afghanistan and is believed to be strong enough to bar anyone he opposes from winning control of the country . It was his eleventh-hour defection to the guerrillas that helped topple President Najibullah in April , 1992 . Dostum , based in the city of Mazar-i-Sharif , had ordered his troops to stay out of the bloodletting as rival factions in the guerrillas ' coalition government warred for control of Kabul . But he was said to have given orders for an offensive after jets belonging_to a Rabbani ally bombed his positions in northern Afghanistan on Friday . Reports from Kabul said Dostum ' s fighters fired salvos of rockets and artillery shells from an ancient fort south of Kabul ' s center . Pro-presidential forces , meanwhile , shot back from a hilltop in a residential_area . At least three buildings were hit in the Soviet-built Microrayon housing complex in the northeast of the city where many pro-Dostum families live . Since the fighting broke_out , Kabul has been divided into a crazy_quilt of neighborhoods held by rival factions . Ziayi , the presidential spokesman , asserted that government soldiers captured 300 rebels , five tanks and Kabul ' s airport , formerly controlled by Dostum ' s fighters . A spokesman for Hekmatyar , Haji Farid , said the onslaught was part of an Islamic rebellion against Rabbani ' s government . He claimed anti-presidential fighters had taken Kabul radio , the Finance Ministry , a strategic bridge on the outskirts of the capital and the central committee hall , next door to the presidential palace . Neither side ' s claim could be independently verified . The cease-fire announced by the Afghan Cabinet a week ago was the latest in a string of dozens of truce agreements that failed to hold .</TEXT>
