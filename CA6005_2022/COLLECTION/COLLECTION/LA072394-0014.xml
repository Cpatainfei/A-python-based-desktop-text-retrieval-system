   <HEADLINE> EUROPE ; BITTERNESS SULLIES POLISH PLANS FOR RECONCILIATION ; SOME HOPED TO HEAL WOUNDS WITH GERMANY AND RUSSIA ON 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF WARSAW UPRISING . BUT INVITATION TO LEADERS OF THOSE FORMER ENEMY COUNTRIES HAS DIVIDED NATION .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a year marked by World_War_II anniversaries across Europe , many Poles wanted their biggest commemoration to serve as an international example of reconciliation between former enemies . But the deep wounds of history have conspired against such good intentions . The upcoming anniversary of the so-called Warsaw Uprising has served instead as an unsettling reminder of how bitter many Poles remain toward their German and Russian neighbors . Polish President Lech Walesa has invited both Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin and German President Roman Herzog to the Aug . 1 ceremonies marking the 50th anniversary of the rebellion . The move has angered some veteran groups , prompted a nationwide petition drive against the visits and left the Polish electorate deeply divided . In extending the invitations , which have also gone_to British , French and American leaders , Walesa said it is time to reach_out to Germans and Russians and put to rest historic animosities , which for many Poles are_best illustrated by the tragic uprising . &quot; We will not forget what happened , &quot; said Andrzej Zakrzewski , Walesa ' s top political adviser . &quot; But at_the_same_time we want reconciliation . We do not want to enter into the new_world with a feeling of vendetta. &quot; Polish underground forces mounted the 63-day revolt against occupying German troops in 1944 in hopes of liberating the Polish capital before the advancing Soviet army claimed the territory for itself . The Nazis brutally crushed the insurrection , killing 200 # 000 Poles and systematically dynamiting most of Warsaw , including the Royal Castle , a symbol of Polish sovereignty . The Soviets ignored calls_for help and watched the carnage from the east bank of the Vistula_River , content to see the Nazis put_down the largely anti-Communist Polish resistance movement before moving_in unhindered months later . Although the uprising was a military debacle , Poles regard it as a proud moment of national honor : An ill-equipped band of citizens known as the Home Army dared to take_on Hitler ' s war machine . &quot; We view the uprising as a victory , &quot; said Jacek Milobedzki , a retired electronics engineer who fought at age 16 . &quot; A lot of what followed in Poland , including Solidarity , we believe had its roots in the uprising . Young people were brought_up knowing we needed to be independent and not subservient to anyone else. &quot; A recent public_opinion_poll shows that half of Poles want neither Herzog nor Yeltsin to attend . Urszula Krassawska , a pollster with the Center for Surveying Public_Opinion , said Poles still revere the uprising and are slow to forget &quot; the hurt of that time. &quot; Yeltsin declined his invitation but promised to send a high-level delegation , which is equally unacceptable to opponents . Herzog readily accepted but offended some Poles when he confused the uprising with the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising , a 1943 revolt in the city ' s walled Jewish quarter that was also suppressed by Nazi troops . In protest , some Home Army veterans plan to boycott the official ceremonies , and the Confederation for an Independent Poland , a nationalist opposition party , has undertaken a petition drive demanding the Germans and Russians not attend . The effort has been organized by 30-year-old party activist Tomasz Szczepanski . &quot; It is premature for gestures like this one , &quot; Szczepanski said . &quot; The Warsaw Uprising was not just a battle like Normandy , it wasn ' t even just an attempt to conquer the Home Army . It was an attempt to annihilate Warsaw and the center of Polish culture. &quot; Supporters of Russian and German participation say they are not disheartened by the protests , describing them as a healthy byproduct of Polish democracy . Only a_few years ago , Poles were not even allowed to publicly commemorate the uprising because the Communist authorities viewed it as anti-Communist .</TEXT>
