   <HEADLINE> 2 PLEAD GUILTY TO SALES OF FAKE JET PARTS ; COURTS : EXECUTIVES OF FONTANA FIRM ADMIT SELLING SUBSTANDARD ENGINE LINERS FOR USE IN SMALL , PRIVATE AIRCRAFT . THE INVESTIGATION BEGAN WITH A 1992 RAID OF AN OXNARD COMPANY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A federal fraud investigation prompted by a 1992 raid of an Oxnard firm led Monday to guilty pleas by two aircraft parts brokers , who admitted selling fake engine parts for small private jets . The brokers -- executives at Ontario Air Parts in Fontana -- pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the Federal Aviation Administration and private aircraft companies by selling cheap , counterfeit jet_engine liners from Taiwan . James A . Fishback Sr. , 60 , and Earlene C . Christenson , 45 , also acknowledged buying from now-defunct Dixon Aircraft Components of Oxnard worn military engine liners and illegally selling them for use on civilian jets , such_as the Lear jet . In a plea bargain entered in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles , prosecutors said they will recommend sentences of six months in jail and a $ 250 # 000 fine for each defendant and a $ 250 # 000 fine against the Fontana company , which is owned by Fishback . Fishback ' s attorney , Richard Sherman of Los Angeles , said the company is cooperating with the government investigation . &quot; There have been some things that have not been handled properly , &quot; Sherman said . But the defendants &quot; are not dangerous or dishonest people. &quot; The brokers sold to six companies about 60 substandard engine liners for small jets capable of carrying up_to 20 passengers , prosecutors said . Nearly all_the liners have now been recalled . &quot; This case is serious because ( defendants ) circumvented the FAA scheme of regulation , which is designed to ensure that all civilian aircraft parts are up_to specifications , &quot; Assistant U.S. Atty . George B . Newhouse said . &quot; There is a huge risk that these parts may fail in flight. &quot; The lack of federal safety checks was particularly significant in this case because engine liners are so important to a jet ' s operation , authorities said . The liners separate the extreme heat of fuel combustion from an engine ' s moving parts . Although no airline crashes have been attributed to counterfeit parts in this country , the use of unapproved parts is seen by experts as a significant problem worldwide . An aging Norwegian charter plane crashed in 1989 at least partly because of unsanctioned parts , killing 55 people , said Howard Aylesworth of the Aerospace Industries Assn . In the United States , six small general aviation planes have crashed because of the failure of parts not approved by the FAA , he said . &quot; All airplanes are manufactured to very , very high tolerances of safety , &quot; Aylesworth said . &quot; But unapproved parts compromise that margin of safety . They create an unknown safety condition. &quot; FAA spokesman Joe Doubleday , however , said he is not aware of the general aviation crashes cited by Aylesworth . He said counterfeit parts are a concern but have not proved to be an actual safety hazard because so many backups are built into jet aircraft systems . Investigators have found no crashes or equipment_failure linked to parts sold by the Fontana brokers or refurbished by Dixon Aircraft , Newhouse said . Monday ' s convictions bring_to 62 the number of fake-aircraft-parts cases successfully prosecuted by federal authorities during the last two years , said Dennis Dutch , a top investigator at the Department_of_Transportation . Counterfeit parts were his office ' s top priority for the last two fiscal_years because of a surge in complaints in 1991 , Dutch said . Inquiries have resulted in 92 indictments nationwide . About 150 more cases remain active , he said . The Fontana case follows by six months a Los Angeles grand_jury ' s 50-count federal indictment of Rudolf Augustus Dixon for defense fraud . His small Oxnard firm was closed after a raid two years ago by agents from the FBI , Department_of_Defense and Air_Force . Dixon Aircraft , which repaired worn engines for the U.S. Air_Force ' s largest cargo plane , the C-5B , was indicted on charges of failing to do required repairs , falsifying maintenance records and overcharging the government . Dixon , 57 , who remains free on bail , was also charged with selling worn-out and obsolete engine parts to commercial airlines . His case is pending . The Fontana case grew directly from evidence gathered_in the 1992 raid . According to federal charges , Fishback telephoned Dixon in 1990 to get him to modify military engine liners used in Air_Force F-5 jet fighters so they could be installed in civilian jet_engines . The military and civilian engines are similar because both are manufactured by General Electric Aircraft_Engines in Cincinnati . &quot; Dixon informed Fishback that the modification could not be lawfully performed under FAA regulations , &quot; the charges allege . But Dixon agreed to make the modifications anyway , prosecutors charge . Meanwhile , in a conspiracy that lasted at least from 1989 through 1992 , Fishback ' s firm bought numerous military engine liners from Masbe Corp . of Taiwan , removed identifying stickers and sold them for $ 7 # 500 as General Electric parts , prosecutors said . The Fontana firm made about $ 2 # 000 extra on each Taiwanese part but perhaps double that on each worn military part altered by Dixon , Newhouse said . &quot; Drug dealers might look enviously at some of these profits , &quot; he said . Prosecutors listed only two fraud victims in court documents -- Jet Sales Leasing Inc. of Columbus , Ohio , and Airwork Corp . of Millville , N.J. But authorities said evidence shows the other companies also received the counterfeit liners . Other leads from the Dixon search are still being pursued , said Gary Auer , FBI agent-in-charge in Ventura County . The inquiry began in 1991 when a Dixon employee told authorities of widespread cheating at the company .</TEXT>
