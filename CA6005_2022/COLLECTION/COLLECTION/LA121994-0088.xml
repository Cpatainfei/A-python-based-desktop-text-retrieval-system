   <TEXT> Tilting at Windmills : The California Public_Utilities Commission could resolve a highly public fight between Southern California Edison Co . and independent power producers at its scheduled hearing Wednesday in San Francisco . The utility is contesting a PUC-mandated auction in which Edison would be required to enter long-term contracts to buy electricity from independents that include wind energy , geothermal and other renewable-fuel sources.In full-page newspaper_ads and other venues , Edison has argued that it does not need the additional power and that signing the contracts would unnecessarily raise ratepayer costs by more_than $ 1 billion from 1997 through the year 2003 alone . The independents , led by the Independent Energy Producers Assn. , contend in their own ad_campaign that while Edison may_not need more electricity right away , theirs is cheaper than power now being made by some older Edison-owned facilities , which should be retired . The auction is a legacy of the 1970s oil shocks , when state agencies forged support of renewable and domestic energy sources . The auction also predates the PUC ' s proposal last spring to deregulate the electric utility industry . Edison says signing now would burden the utility with a new set of long-term financial_obligations just as it enters the uncharted world of competition . Last week , the utility asked commissioners to hold_off their decision until it completes less expensive deals to option , not buy , power from the independents .</TEXT>
