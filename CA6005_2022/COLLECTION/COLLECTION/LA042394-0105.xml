   <HEADLINE> U.S. TO RESTRICT GRAIN IMPORTS FROM CANADA ; COMMERCE : AMERICA ' S LARGEST TRADING PARTNER DENIES CHARGES OF DUMPING , THREATENS TARIFFS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The world ' s two largest trading partners edged closer to a trade war over wheat Friday after the United States said it will restrict imports of Canadian wheat , flour and barley beginning July 1 . Canada criticized the United States for not playing the free-trade game fairly and threatened to slap tariffs on U.S. chicken , wine , bourbon , pasta , canned fruits and bakery goods . U.S. Agriculture_Secretary Mike Espy said tonnage limits will be negotiated over the next 90 days , with a goal of limiting Canadian shipments to levels far lower than they are today . Espy accused Canada and its Wheat Board of dumping grain at unfairly low prices in the U.S. market . The United States contends Canada uses &quot; predatory pricing , &quot; unfairly subsidizes its wheat and hurts U.S. farmers . &quot; We feel aggrieved because of the inordinate amount of wheat that is coming_in from Canada , &quot; Espy said . &quot; We believe this ( dumping ) is the case. &quot; Canadian officials denied that Canada is dumping subsidized grain and said rising exports are the result of freer_trade between the nations and higher U.S. prices caused by last year ' s Midwest floods . &quot; We are very unhappy . We don ' t intend to cave_in , and we have not agreed with the American negotiations , &quot; Deputy Prime_Minister Sheila Copps told Parliament in Ottawa . &quot; We intend to take action. &quot;</TEXT>
