   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE ; THE OUTER LIMITS OF PROSECUTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Attacks against people because of their race , religion or sexual orientation occur with such appalling regularity they have their own designation : hate crimes . But hate-crime prosecution is more easily called_for than done . State law defines a hate crime as &quot; the interference through force or threat with an individual ' s civil_rights &quot; on the basis of race , religion , nationality or ethnic background . Also included are attacks on gays and lesbians . Prosecutors need to be vigorous in pressing hate-crime charges that they can make stick , but society cannot count_on the legal_system alone to create a climate of tolerance . THE LAYMAN ' S VIEW : Consider last week ' s gun killing in Orange County of Vernon Windell Flournoy . Sure , it was a hate crime &quot; from a layman ' s perspective , &quot; notes Huntington Beach Police_Chief Ronald E . Lowenberg , because one of the accused was a reputed associate of white_supremacists and Flournoy was African American . Accused in the killing are Jonathan Russell Kennedy , 19 , a so-called skinhead , and a 17-year-old . In addition , Kennedy is charged with the attempted murder of two Latino men last month , also in Huntington Beach . Prosecutors are considering filing hate-crime charges in both cases , but such cases can be difficult to prove . Establishing a hate crime as defined by state law requires prosecutors to prove that a suspect deliberately targeted a victim for racial or other specified characteristics . In another case , the district_attorney filed hate-crime charges in the beating death of a black_woman at a La Habra mall but dropped them when further evidence showed a dispute over a parking_space was one cause of the attack . Last week , the district_attorney upgraded charges in an attack on a black high_school student to attempted murder but declined a hate-crime prosecution on the grounds there was insufficient evidence to prove race was a motivating factor . Although to a layman it certainly looked_like a racial case , proving the case in court under the official standards is a different matter . TEACHING OUR YOUNG : At the same time , fortunately , Los Angeles and Orange counties ' human relations commissions have done_good work in documenting hate crimes , and private watchdog groups have been aggressive in spotlighting outrages and using civil_laws where applicable to thwart hatemongers . This vigilance and good police work are necessary . But equally so is education , starting at_home with instruction on diversity and the need for tolerance . School discussions , sermons from the pulpit , community meetings sponsored by service organizations -- all can help steer young people away from hate and toward a reaffirmation of democratic values . These are not easy tasks , but they are the important work we all must do_in striving to build and maintain a just society , supported by effective law_enforcement . Hate-crime cases in Orange and Los Angeles counties are yet more reminders that bigotry is dangerous , and that multicultural California cannot afford to shrug_off this corrosive and demoralizing evil .</TEXT>
