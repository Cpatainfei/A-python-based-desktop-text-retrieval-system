   <TEXT> What if I invited you to dinner , you accepted , and then I said , &quot; . . . and I ' m making my favorite dish of kale . . . . &quot; Would you suddenly remember your Aunt Maude was_due in town that night ? But had I said , &quot; . . . and I ' m making a salad of warm purplish peacock kale with shreds of Gruyere cheese , balsamic vinegar and toasted pine_nuts , &quot; Maudie might be persuaded to stay home . Now , when did you last tuck delicate leaves of summer kale into a tossed salad ? Or dress hot ribbons of frost-sweetened kale with olive_oil and lemon_juice and serve them with garlic toast ? Some of you are nodding and smiling and saying , &quot; Yesterday ! &quot; From a sheltered place or from the cold_frame you may have picked smooth , blue-green leaves of Lacinato , the mildly flavored Italian heirloom kale . Or oak-leaf purple-veined leaves of Red Russian ( a.k.a. Ragged Jack ) , a delicious American heirloom that reddens , like children ' s cheeks , in the cold . Or perhaps you harvested young crimson leaves from the center of a Chidori ornamental kale that looked_like crinkly roses bordered with green . Perhaps you ' re planning to order ornamental red and white peacock kales to sow_in summer . They make an extraordinarily lacy spray in the border , stalks of cream or rosy purple etched with blue-gray-green . Plucked young , their leaves are delicious . Arranged as garnish on a platter , peacock kale looks_like something between exotic feathers and a Martian doily . * Although it ' s not as showy , you kale cognoscenti know the value of the savoyed green culinary kale most of us see -- nay , overlook -- at the market . Have you a patch of it , with leaves ready to chop into a cream_sauce as filling for green lasagna ? Have you tried Verdura , a Dutch strain with succulent , dark , blue-green leaves ( tastiest kale I ' ve tasted ) . In the garden , curly kale looks_like giant ruffled parsley . Kale is a cool-season vegetable ; it grows and tastes best when temperatures are in the 50s and 60s , as they are now . Most kales are even happy in the 40s and 30s . And a_few sharp frosts deepen their colors and intensify their sweetness . The best timing is to start heirloom culinary kale seeds around July and hybrid ornamental kales in August , so plants can be going strong by September or October . These kales will winter over , and likely be harvestable through February . Some plants may give you delectable leaves for another year . Some may yellow in spring and send up flowers . These buds are like broccoli , so cook them up ! In gardens where there is little or no frost , you must choose a kale that grows tender and sweet without the cold . Try Dwarf Blue Curled Vates , a culinary kale with finely curled blue-green leaves . Place it in your chilliest spot . When you pick the leaves , refrigerate them in the crisper for a_few days , and you ' ll gain some of frost ' s effects . In the High Desert , sow Dwarf Blue Curled Vates in February and March . Where seasons are short , sow seeds in May and June . * But even where summers are warm , sow a_few seeds of Red Russian kale in very early spring . Give plants a coolish spot and you can harvest before the heat , even during it . It ' s worked for me . Harvest young leaves individually with a knife , taking them from near the center . Let the mature leaves stay . As you can imagine , kales have few rivals for beauty in the border . From 12 inches to 24 inches tall and usually just as wide , springtime kales like the company of daffodils and irises . Autumn kales love partying with marigolds . Kales are easy to grow . They need five hours of sunshine daily , an inch of water weekly and shelter from wind . All must have well-drained , moisture-retentive soil . Green sorts want a fertile soil to give their best , both in vigor and nutrition . In lean soil , the struggle to overcome deficiencies actually makes ornamental kales grow brighter . Kale is susceptible to aphids . Swoosh them off with a hose ( but be careful not to break the leaves ) . Past that , if there are signs of damage , consult a county agricultural_agent . And let three years pass before you grow kale in the same place again . This helps prevent disease and provides an even drain on the soil ' s resources . * Ah , but not just to look_at , these are plants to eat ! Kale is among the most nourishing of vegetables . One serving gives twice the RDA of vitamins A and C , and healthy amounts of readily available calcium and iron . Also , kale leaves don ' t shrink in cooking the way spinach and chard leaves do , so you don ' t have to harvest buckets for a meal . When the time comes that you must take_up the whole plant , peel the thick main stem , unless it ' s old and tough . You can cut it into matchsticks and treat as you would celery . So-called Chinese kale , by the way , isn ' t the familiar European sort of kale but a kissing cousin . Speaking of China , it ' s exciting to know that the rose quartz , ruby , amethyst , ivory and jade of ornamental kales adorn gardens all_over the Orient and across Europe and Britain . I wish I could tell you that the kales from these gardens come_into kitchens and are sent to tables in splendor . But I can ' t because they don ' t -- and aren ' t . Only Portugal , Scotland , Ireland , a corner in the north of Italy and pockets in Holland appreciate kale properly . The national dish of Portugal is kale and potato soup -- caldo verde . Irish cooks mix finely chopped kale with mashed potatoes and spoon it up with pools of butter -- colcannon ( which is also made with cabbage ) . In Scotland , kale is simmered in_stock and the soup is thickened with barley , oats or rice -- kale brose . An Italian spoon-stands-up-in-it soup of white_beans , pasta , tomatoes and garlic is given depth of color and taste with rags of kale -- pasta e fagioli verdi . And wearing a Greek cap , I turn a broth speckled with kale into a lemon-tangy egg-creamy avgolemono . So it ' s up_to us to rouse the gardeners of the world into growing and eating kale ! * Let ' s begin with a dish inspired by a Dutch classic . It ' s wonderful when you can have intriguing shapes of leaves in front of you . How many cooked leaves can you think_of that are more_than a nebulous heap on the plate ? Kale leaves , whether deeply cut or nattily curled , are sculpture . If you have sensational sausages -- something like the designer chicken and turkey I found the other day made with &quot; fire-roasted red_peppers , cilantro , spices , and garlic &quot; -- you can give this to friends for supper . Pass a basket of radishes , black_olives and carrot_sticks . Drink a Dutch lager . Let mellow Edam cheese follow . Then for dessert , chopped candied ginger pressed into the icing of a bittersweet_chocolate cake . And best invite Aunt Maude . . . . Sources Fresh : Curly and ornamental kales at markets with fine produce , and perhaps Red Russian at farmers markets . Mail-order seeds : &quot; Red &amp; White Peacock &quot; -- listed under Flowering Cabbage and Kale -- from Thompson &amp; Morgan , Box 1308 , Jackson , N.J. 08527-0308 . &quot; Dwarf Blue Curled Vates &quot; from Lockhart Seeds , Box 1361 , Stockton , Calif . 95205 . All others mentioned from Shepherd ' s , 6116 Highway 9 , Felton , Calif . 95018 . * Peacock kales wilt rapidly once picked , so cook them ASAP . But don ' t cook in a skillet , even with moisture . The leaves will turn drab and tough . Boiling them in a pot of water intensifies their hues and renders them tender . Unfortunately , unless the leaves are very young , the stalks are too fibrous to enjoy . To prepare and cook kale ( and other leaves with tough stalks ) , swish in lots of cold water . If home-grown , soak 30 minutes to float any aphids , then rinse well again . Fold each leaf lengthwise . Run a sharp knife along the inside of the stalk , freeing the pair of greens . Leave greens whole or chop as desired ; if stalks are tender , chop and cook separately . This is less a soup than a meal in one with its broth . Add more broth if you ' d like it soupier .
