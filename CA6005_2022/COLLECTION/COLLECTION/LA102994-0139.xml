   <HEADLINE> HUFFINGTON PLAN TO REMAKE HOUSTON SKYLINE FELL FLAT ; BUSINESS : HE SECRETLY BOUGHT UP 11 DOWNTOWN BLOCKS FOR PROJECT . BUT COLLAPSE OF OIL MARKET TOOK DREAM WITH IT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This was Mike Huffington ' s &quot; baby , &quot; the chance to leave his own mark on a city that had long revered his oil-rich father as an entrepreneurial genius . Huffington ' s vision for his hometown : To create an urban community of swank high-rise condominiums , theaters and restaurants out of a tired downtown neighborhood . Working in secret , he bought_up properties piece by piece through the 1980s and amassed 11 city_blocks , utilizing the family oil money that is now financing his campaign for the U.S. Senate . Like his headlong rush into politics , it was a move so aggressive for the conservative businessman that even close associates were left shaking their heads . But then the Texas oil market collapsed , taking with it any hopes for Huffington ' s dream development . And the property -- now dotted with boarded-up shops , overgrown fields , and lots crammed with rusted-out trucks -- sits instead as a remnant of his lucrative yet erratic two decades in business . Jim Boyd , vice_president of the company that bought_out Huffington ' s family-owned operation in 1990 for a reported $ 600 million , laughs when asked what his firm hopes to do with the once-promising land acquired in the deal . &quot; We ' d like to sell it , &quot; he said . The stalled development , representing one of the biggest land deals in Houston history , underscores central questions in the Republican congressman ' s bid to defeat Sen . Dianne Feinstein on Nov . 8 : Just how good was Mike Huffington as a businessman ? And what does his record as an oil_company executive and entrepreneur say about his ability to help lead California through tough economic times ? For the 47-year-old Huffington , the link between profit_margins and prudent public policy is inextricable . His main achievement as an oil executive and his primary mission as a U.S. senator , he said in an interview , are essentially one : &quot; Trying to cut_back the fat in the budget. &quot; With a brief political record to run_on , Huffington has made his business career a cornerstone of his Senate_campaign , holding himself up as a man who built a fortune from modest beginnings before moving to Santa Barbara less than four years ago . &quot; I am the American_Dream , &quot; he declared as he unseated a longtime incumbent congressman in 1992 . In the powerful oil and banking cliques of Texas , Huffington still carries a reputation as a tough , in-your-face negotiator who brought his Harvard Business_School organizational savvy to a family company that was rich_in gas reserves but raw in modern business know-how . But he is also remembered as a businessman who served largely as a high-ranking &quot; caretaker &quot; for his father ' s corporate empire and was often absent when trouble hit . &quot; It ' s very difficult to find specific things that Mike achieved . He didn ' t have any real track record , &quot; said John T . Brown III , a former vice_president at Huffco , the oil conglomerate that Huffington ' s wildcatter father founded . &quot; Mike ' s idea of managing the company was to preserve the family wealth . He did not take risks. &quot; Many other associates describe Huffington as an industrious , hands-on executive . He even involved himself in corporate minutia , insisting that his 140 employees keep their desks clean and avoid smoking and caffeine in the office . &quot; It was his company , &quot; said Boyd , who worked as Huffco ' s controller . Even his supporters , however , are slow to point to business successes that presaged Huffington ' s political career . Although he oversaw Huffco finances as chief financial_officer , problems arose on several fronts : Environmental : The company paid about $ 1 million in the mid-1980s to clean_up coastal wetlands on the Gulf Coast that were damaged by its oil_rigs , according to former general counsel John Patton . Huffington and other officials voluntarily paid even more to clean_up decades-old oil contamination discovered at a 400-acre site that Huffco owned just outside Houston , former executives said . Federal records show the firm also is listed as a &quot; potentially responsible party &quot; at a polluted Superfund site in Louisiana . In California , a Huffco subsidiary owned a 20 % stake in a bankrupted Paramount refinery that left a trail of environmental damage , The Times reported earlier this month . Testing has found that hazardous pollutants have spread into ground_water and soil surrounding the 60-acre site , and water quality officials say it may cost tens of millions of dollars to clean_up . Officials said that the pollution probably started decades before the Huffington company held an interest for several years in the 1980s . Legal : The U.S. Commerce_Department fined Huffco $ 250 # 000 in 1986 because it had improperly made dozens of shipments of computers and police equipment -- including shock batons , billy clubs and handcuffs -- to Indonesia . The company ran one of the world ' s largest liquefied gas operations there , and former executives say the items were shipped , without required U.S. authorization , for use by Huffco ' s overseas employees . Huffington said he took immediate steps to avoid a recurrence , but the export violations already had proved costly to his political aspirations . He said the investigation had prompted him to ask the Ronald Reagan_Administration to quietly withdraw his nomination as an assistant Commerce_secretary before the Senate could consider it . &quot; You know how Washington is -- if you have something ( potentially damaging ) like that , &quot; he said , &quot; it ' s just not worth going_through it. &quot; Financial : The company suffered major losses during his tenure on two oil projects in California and Oklahoma . The $ 135-million California project , designed to process crude_oil in Bakersfield and pipe it to Los Angeles , led to tens of millions of dollars in losses and prompted run-ins with Texas bankers and Sacramento tax officials over millions more in alleged unpaid debts . In an interview , Huffington dismissed many of these difficulties as insignificant compared to his biggest achievement -- persuading his family to sell Huffco in 1990 at what he considers its peak value . Most of the problems , he said , were someone else ' s doing . The baton and computer shipments , Huffington said , were authorized by lower-level executives without his knowledge and he was furious when he found_out . The Paramount refinery was run with little involvement from him , and he knew_nothing about its environmental problems , said Huffington , whose account was supported by others . The first he heard of Huffco ' s $ 1-million oil cleanup on the Gulf Coast or the firm ' s connection to the Superfund site in Louisiana came when a Times reporter asked about those issues in a recent interview , he said . And he and other former Huffco officials said the Bakersfield refinery was approved by his father despite Huffington ' s warnings that it could be a big money-loser . &quot; You ' re asking the wrong guy , &quot; he added . &quot; That was done_by other people . It was not one that I played an active role in at all . . . . It was not my favorite project. &quot; After Huffco was unable to repay part of a $ 15-million loan from First City National_Bank of Houston , bank executive Bob Wagner negotiated with Huffington to settle the_matter . &quot; The positive side to him was that he had a much more organized management style than his father , and he had good people around him , &quot; he said . &quot; The negative was that he got ( Huffco ) into some lousy investments . . . and he was a tough_guy to get_along_with , &quot; he said . &quot; His attitude was , ' This is our offer , guys . If you don ' t like it , take a hike. ' &quot; The bank , which later failed , wrote_off more_than $ 5 million in losses on the loan , federal records show . Huffington ' s supporters say the congressman , only now managing to escape his father ' s shadow , is rarely given credit for helping build Huffco and for using conservative fiscal_policies to protect it from the oil bust of the mid-1980s . &quot; The way ( Huffington ) approached the business could very well have saved the company from going_off a cliff , &quot; said Michael Decker , Huffo ' s former chief financial_officer . &quot; Huffco was the best-run , best-financed , best-performing independent oil_company . The ( profit ) margins were great . This was a home-run business. &quot; Huffington refused to provide records to corroborate such claims . &quot; You have to take people ' s word for it , &quot; he said . Huffington ' s business dealings did make him a rich_man . He and his wife , author Arianna Huffington , own multimillion-dollar homes on each coast , and he is thought to be worth more_than $ 70 million , his share of Huffco ' s 1990 buyout by a nationalized Taiwanese oil_company . The congressman is so well-off that he has been donating his federal salary to children ' s causes in Santa Barbara -- and he has spent more_than $ 25 million of_his_own money on the campaign . Yet less is known about his finances than those of many other major candidates because Huffington has refused repeated calls from rivals and the media to release annual tax_returns and other financial documents . He says voters are most interested in state and national issues , not his wealth . Some who have worked closely with Huffington find it incongruous that such a zealously private person has thrust himself into what has become one of the nation ' s most publicized races . &quot; I never saw Mike as a politician , &quot; said Patton , the Huffco general counsel . &quot; He was a very private person , and politics just isn ' t a game for private people , in my view. &quot; As a candidate , he has carefully chosen what to disclose about his career . His campaign provided a reporter with a list of 29 professional associates who could speak about his accomplishments . All who were interviewed spoke well of Huffington but most said they had rarely , if ever , dealt directly with him . They said they knew him primarily through his father , Roy , a geologist who forged into oil exploration in the 1950s . The response of San Antonio oilman Robert V . West Jr . was typical : &quot; I ' m a good friend really of Roy , and I know Mike through Roy , &quot; said West , a retired petroleum company founder . &quot; I think and hope that he ' s like his father , really a great American . If he turns_out half as_good_as Roy , he ' ll be doing pretty well. &quot; Huffington has clung to his privacy , even when it comes_to investments that he has had to publicly disclose . For example , he reported in a congressional conflict-of-interest statement that his ownership in a Southern California production company called Crest Films Ltd . was worth $ 500 # 000 to $ 1 million . But Crest President Pierre de Lespinois said Huffington paid &quot; definitely . . . more_than $ 1 million &quot; for his half-interest . Huffington declined to discuss the discrepancy , saying : &quot; that ' s private , it ' s a private company. &quot; Born of middle-class roots in Dallas in 1947 , Huffington says he has restlessly considered a wide range of professions over the years -- from real_estate and filmmaking to religion , teaching and , in what he now considers his true spiritual calling , politics . Amid all_the possibilities , however , oil has dominated his professional_life . After graduating from Harvard Business_School in 1972 , Huffington went_out on_his_own for four years in banking and oil investment . But after a messy legal run-in with his partners in a Texas investment_firm , he joined the family company in 1976 to work in finance . He stayed there for virtually all_of the next 14 years in high-ranking positions under his father . He took only a year ' s break to work as a deputy assistant secretary_of_defense in arms control , a position secured in part through his family ' s contributions to the Republican_Party . Fiscal prudence has been Huffington ' s professional credo , and even his personal portfolio today is built around low-risk holdings , with millions held_in U.S. Treasury_bills , state bonds , IRAs and money_market accounts , records show . His conservative philosophies became well-entrenched in Houston : Although it put him at_odds with his Huffco associates , Huffington opposed the ill-fated Bakersfield refinery because he thought it was too risky . His penchant for husbanding the company ' s resources became the stuff of legend in the office . On the eve of Huffco ' s sale to the Taiwanese , several colleagues recalled , he gathered_up desk supplies before the buyers moved_in . And his corporate billings sparked recurring tensions with Huffco ' s overseas partners . In 1971 , Huffington ' s father tapped into a major natural_gas reserve in the jungles of Indonesia , and the family struck it rich over the next two decades as a partner with the Indonesian government and other international players in a gas liquefaction operation that generated tens of millions of dollars a year in sales to Japan . From their Houston office , Huffco executives oversaw the Indonesia project and agreed to bill the partners for their administrative work . It was a profitable but contentious arrangement . &quot; Mike wasn ' t bashful about spending_money on_his_own personal ( business ) travel -- first_class and all that . As a general rule , that was all billed to the ( Indonesia ) partnership , &quot; said Paul T . Scott , former executive_vice_president at Huffco . &quot; Mike liked corporate jets and he had a corporate jet , so he used it ( and billed some of the expenses ) . Those were the perks of the job , and there was some resentment from the partners. &quot; One former Huffco official who spoke on condition of anonymity remembered an upset Huffington demanding to know why more of the official ' s time that month had ( not ) been billed to the Indonesia project . Huffington declined to discuss the billings . Although Huffco ' s Indonesian venture occupied much of his time , Huffington said , oil never generated the passion for him that it did for his father . His greater interest was in real_estate , he said , and his Houston land acquisition was seen as his brainchild . Over a period that spanned a decade , beginning in 1979 , Huffington directed a handful of associates to gradually buy_up what amounted to 11 blocks of a run-down area now dominated by the George R . Brown Convention Center . Huffington hoped the city ' s runaway growth would spill into the area , and Huffco would supply land for prime development . But even many of those closest to Huffington knew_nothing about his plans . Houston real_estate_broker David L . Cook , who helped buy the land piece by piece , remembers the intense secrecy among intermediaries handling the deal -- including code names for parcels , pseudonyms for agents , even disguised voices for phone conversations . &quot; Certainly we didn ' t want all_the landowners to know who the purchasers were , or even that there was one purchaser out there , &quot; he said . &quot; It would raise the price. &quot; Former Huffco executive Decker , who would serve as best_man at Huffington ' s wedding , says he never heard anything about the project until several years after it began . Huffington sat him down one day on a bench downtown and instructed him to take_a_look at the neighborhood of parking_lots , small shops and vacant land . &quot; Most of this , &quot; Huffington told him , &quot; is ours. &quot; In launching the land deal , Decker recalled , &quot; his vision was to really have an impact on the skyline of the city and to do something that would be a lasting achievement in its history , a visible achievement. &quot; These are the types of images that Huffington often summons in speaking_of his political ambitions as well . But in the Houston deal , the achievement never came . The bottom dropped_out of the oil market , and with it went much of Houston ' s growth . So by the time the family began shopping its vast oil-and-gas operations to bidders in the late 1980s , it was also willing to sell_off the land Huffington had worked so_long to acquire . &quot; The only mistake they made , &quot; said Houston realty agent Jenard Gross , a close friend and political backer of Huffington , &quot; was that they were a little late in the game . And of course , the oil collapse occurred so they just ended_up with a lot of land they didn ' t develop. &quot; The mistake may have proved costly . Although Huffington would not discuss the land ' s finances , associates say they believe Huffco took a substantial loss , and financial and court records appear to bear them out . The family company paid a reported $ 38 million for the land , but the Taiwanese buyers valued it at only $ 15 million in a purchase_agreement with Huffco . Even today , Huffington considers the land &quot; a fantastic investment &quot; that may yet attract a developer . He speaks in terms of sacrifice when discussing the decision to package the property with Huffco ' s oil assets in the 1990 sale . &quot; My father , if he was willing to sell the oil_business , which he loved , then I had to be willing to sell the real_estate business , &quot; he said . The downtown property &quot; was my baby , but so it was for my father when he sold his company . &quot; I thought it was the right thing to do. &quot; Huffington ' s Business Career Here are some key events in the professional_life of Republican Senate candidate Mike Huffington : * 1974 : Two years out of Harvard Business_School , Huffington starts oil investment_firm in Houston with two partners . * 1976 : After messy run-in with partners , Huffington leaves investment_firm with $ 700 # 000 buyout and joins Huffco , the Houston oil_company his father founded .
