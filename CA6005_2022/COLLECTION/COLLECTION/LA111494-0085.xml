   <HEADLINE> PROP . 187 SPONSORS SWEPT UP IN NATIONAL WHIRLWIND ; IMMIGRATION : CALLERS SEEK HELP IN CARRYING EFFORT TO OTHER STATES . SOME BELIEVE NEXT STEP IS UP TO CONGRESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Alan Nelson is running_out of c lean underwear . Barbara Coe jokes about running_off to Mexico . And Harold Ezell hardly has time to run his consulting business -- helping to obtain legal immigration status for well-to-do foreign investors willing to create new jobs in the United States . Last week ' s landslide victory of Proposition 187 has proved a dizzying experience for many of the key sponsors of the get-tough illegal immigration ballot measure . Swept into celebrity , they have been inundated by phone_calls from reporters around the world seeking reaction and from grass-roots groups across the nation hoping to launch similar movements in their own states . Flush with their success , the leaders of the so-called &quot; save our state &quot; movement are working nearly nonstop to spread the gospel . &quot; I ' ve been donating my time for 13 months to this campaign , so what ' s another week or two , &quot; said Ron Prince , who headed the pro-187 campaign committee . &quot; I just got_off the phone with the Washington , uh , I don ' t remember if it was the Times or the Post , I ' m so confused , &quot; echoed proposition co-sponsor Coe , who heads the California Coalition for Immigration Reform . &quot; I ' m drowning in calls . I think I ' m going_to run_away from home . I may run_away to Mexico. &quot; As they seek to make use of their newfound clout , the movement ' s leaders speak_of recall elections targeting officials involved in the flurry of lawsuits filed to block the measure within hours of last Tuesday ' s election . They talk_of initiatives similar to Proposition 187 being placed on ballots in Arizona , Texas and Florida . And they voice hopes that the initiative ' s success will spark similar efforts in Washington , particularly since Republicans will control the next Congress and incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich is eyeing new measures . Among their ideas are legislative action to bolster enforcement along the U.S.-Mexico border , to make_it harder for employers to hire unauthorized workers , and to terminate the few remaining federal benefits that illegal immigrants now qualify for , such_as school lunches and food for pregnant women . &quot; There ' s no need for another Proposition 187 in any other state if Congress does its job : a law that says you will ask and determine the alienage of people before you give them any government handouts , &quot; said Ezell , former western regional director of the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service . Some allies even look_to a renewed effort to reduce legal immigration , now at near-record levels . &quot; Proposition 187 is the clearest ringing bell to wake_up our national leadership on this question that we ' ve had in 100 years , &quot; said Dan Stein , executive_director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform , a Washington-based group known as FAIR that seeks restrictions on new arrivals and helped bankroll the pro-187 advertising effort . Not all observers agree that Proposition 187 will travel well , cautioning that the measure may be a California anomaly . Unlike California , gubernatorial elections in Florida , New York and Texas hardly dealt with the issue of immigration , and New York ' s mayor has publicly embraced immigrants , legal or illegal . &quot; We hope the ugliness of the debate on Proposition 187 in California is not the precursor to other ugly debates in other states , &quot; said Cecilia Munoz , senior immigration policy analyst with the National Council of La Raza , a Washington-based Latino advocacy group . &quot; We ' re going to be watchful , but the dynamics in California are very different from elsewhere. &quot; Specifically , California has absorbed both a jarring demographic shift and , more recently , a particularly stubborn recession . There was relatively little talk_about illegal immigrants posing a financial burden back in 1986 , when there were many_more undocumented people but California ' s then-robust economy was generating widespread prosperity . And nowhere else on the national scene has a leader of the stature of Gov . Pete Wilson -- who helped catapult immigration and Proposition 187 to the forefront of the state agenda -- been so anxious to take_up the divisive and racially charged issue . Much of the business_community and many Republicans remain pro-immigration , as the recent anti-187 blasts by former Cabinet secretaries Jack Kemp and William J . Bennett indicate . &quot; Republicans may rue the day if they decide to make immigration a huge , ongoing national issue , &quot; said Rick Swartz , a Washington lawyer who advises pro-immigration groups . &quot; They ' re inviting a huge fight within the Republican Party. &quot; Many questions also remain about the future role of the INS , which , under Proposition 187 , would be deluged with lists of &quot; suspected &quot; illegal immigrants reported by police , health_care workers and educators . The INS already has problems just keeping_up with the load of deportable criminal immigrants in prisons and jails . In the midst of their celebrations , the talk among the Proposition 187 crowd is buoyant , upbeat and goal-oriented . And these days , they are being talked to on network news broadcasts , &quot; Larry King Live &quot; and &quot; This Week With David Brinkley. &quot; &quot; Like it or not , California is a national trendsetter , &quot; said Ezell , a Newport Beach resident . In its grass-roots , populist appeal and potential impact , Proposition 187 is most often compared to Proposition 13 , the tax-cutting initiative spearheaded by the late Howard Jarvis . And if anyone in the Proposition 187 movement brings_to mind the memory of Jarvis , it would be Ezell , a onetime hot dog company executive who relishes the spotlight and is a comfortable , oft-humorous public_speaker . Ezell , however , comes_with his share of baggage -- a controversial tenure at the INS during the 1980s ( he once made headlines for attending a Hawaiian fete thrown by former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos , then under federal investigation ) and a caustic streak that runs counter to Jarvis ' folksy , grandfatherly image . Take Ezell ' s election night comments about the campaign rallies held by foes of the initiative : &quot; The biggest mistake the opposition made was waving those green and white ( Mexican ) flags with the snake on it . They should have been waving the American flag. &quot; Ezell said he ' s having trouble these days finding time to make a living , or spend time with his wife , Lee , and their grown daughters . &quot; The first 48 hours after the election were a killer , man , &quot; Ezell said . &quot; But I think it will start leveling out soon. &quot; Prince , a Tustin accountant who handled the day-to-day campaign , seems less camera ready . Indeed , he grows testy whenever asked personal questions . &quot; I don ' t have a personal life , &quot; Prince declared Friday as he juggled calls from reporters flooding into the campaign ' s Orange County headquarters , which long boasted a secret location because of his fear of death threats . In the wake of a campaign that featured little centralized organization , it may come as little surprise that its leaders are now , on_their_own , pursuing a variety of anti-illegal immigrant agendas . Prince , for one , is suggesting the recall of public officials who have voted to take_part in anti-187 lawsuits , even though Prince and other sponsors of the measure have long acknowledged that it would not take_effect until a flurry of lawsuits was ruled upon . &quot; The will of the people should be obeyed and it is too often thwarted by special_interest groups , &quot; Prince said . &quot; It doesn ' t make_sense for elected officials to sue the people . They should be listening to the people. &quot; The tall , 61-year-old Nelson , who has been burdened by heart trouble , could be viewed_as the elder_statesman of the movement . The national director of the INS during the Reagan_Administration , Nelson said he plans to fight for state legislation to ensure that jobs vacated by illegal immigrants rounded_up by the INS are filled by U.S. citizens or lawful immigrants , &quot; particularly those on welfare or benefit programs. &quot; &quot; The jobs could run the gamut -- from dishwasher jobs to landscaping to construction -- illegals are involved in all_of these , &quot; said Nelson , who while a Sacramento lobbyist for FAIR was long unable to push_through similar bills . As for the next week , Nelson , fresh from a national appearance on the Larry King show , plans a short victory vacation in the desert with his wife and friends . &quot; I hope to play a little golf , relax a little , &quot; he said . &quot; It ' s been quite intense lately . I haven ' t had time to get my car serviced for weeks . And I ' ve gotten_down pretty low in the underwear drawer , I can tell you that. &quot; Yorba Linda political consultant Robert Kiley , who served on the &quot; save our state &quot; committee , is seeking to market his skills to anti-illegal immigrant activists in other states . Coe said she has received calls from grass-roots activists in 18 states since Election_Day . &quot; We anticipated the passage of Proposition 187 would have a ripple effect across the nation . Right now , we feel_like we are in the midst of a tidal_wave , for goodness sake . We never in a_million years anticipated this type of response , and we ' re obviously thrilled. &quot; According to Coe , activists from states with high numbers of illegal immigrants are planning to convene in the near future to discuss a state-by-state strategy . But at this point , the &quot; save our state &quot; juggernaut remains more a shoestring vessel of public anger than a highly burnished political operation . Prince , for example , placed a caller from Los Angeles on hold the other day to take an incoming call from a reporter in Florida . The reason , he said , was to save money for the financially strapped campaign committee by not having to return a long-distance_call . Coe continues to operate her immigration reform effort from her Orange County living room , which long ago became overgrown with campaign literature . &quot; I have only one request of visitors , &quot; Coe said . &quot; If you walk into my place and you break your leg , don ' t sue. &quot; Times staff writer Martin Miller contributed to this story .</TEXT>
