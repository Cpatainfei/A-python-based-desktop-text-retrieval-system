   <HEADLINE> LIBEL AWARD AGAINST NEWSPAPER SET_ASIDE ; COURTS : JUDGE RULES VERDICT INCONSISTENT AND $ 7.5-MILLION DAMAGE AWARD EXCESSIVE AND ORDERS RETRIAL OF BUSINESSMAN ' S CLAIM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A Los Angeles judge ruled Friday that a $ 7.5-million libel award was excessive and ordered a new trial in a lawsuit by Beverly Hills attorney-businessman Leonard M . Ross against the Santa Barbara News-Press and its owner , the New York Times Co . Superior_Court Judge Harvey A . Schneider also ruled that the jury verdict was flawed by internal inconsistencies . In his eight-page opinion , Schneider rejected a motion for a defense verdict -- refusing to rule that Ross had not been libeled . Schneider said he agreed with &quot; the jury ' s conclusion that the defendants were negligent , in some respects. &quot; But in_ordering a new trial , Schneider said that was not &quot; a sufficient basis for upholding a verdict that is inconsistent and excessive. &quot; * Jurors in October had awarded Ross the damages after a four-week trial involving investigative articles on Ross ' business career . Among other things , Ross contended that the Santa Barbara paper falsely linked him to the misdeeds of his former partner , investment whiz Barry Marlin . &quot; We ' re gratified that the court has reversed the jury ' s unjustified verdict , &quot; said Rex Heinke , a lawyer for the News-Press , the New York Times and their co-defendants , reporter Kathleen Sharp and editor David McCumber . Anthony M . Glassman , Ross ' attorney , said he will file a motion for reconsideration because &quot; we think the judge has made an error. &quot; If Schneider refuses to reinstate the judgment , Glassman said he probably will challenge Friday ' s ruling before the state Court of Appeal . Filed more_than four years ago , the lawsuit stems from articles in November , 1988 , and February , 1989 , that Ross said ruined his efforts to establish a new business and social life in Santa Barbara . The reports described the business career of the man who had become the largest shareholder in Santa Barbara Savings &amp; Loan , then the city ' s largest financial_institution . Ross , 49 , contended that the articles contained four false_statements and had a defamatory &quot; tenor and tone. &quot; After deliberating 3 1 / 2 days , jurors agreed that three disputed statements were false , and awarded damages of $ 5 million for harm to Ross ' reputation and $ 2.5 million for emotional distress . The heart of Ross ' claim was that the reports falsely linked him to two federal criminal investigations that took_place in the 1970s , early in his business career , although in fact he was investigated only once . He acknowledged that the newspaper correctly stated he was investigated -- but not charged -- by a federal grand_jury , the FBI and the Organized Crime Strike Force in the early 1970s in an alleged extortion attempt against his former partner , Marlin . But Ross contended -- and jurors agreed -- that the paper falsely linked him to a subsequent investigation of investor fraud that sent Marlin to prison . It was here , however , that Schneider found the inconsistencies in the jury ' s answers to a series of special-verdict questions . While jurors said Ross had proven that &quot; the tenor and tone &quot; of the first report was that Ross was investigated along with Marlin for investor fraud , they elsewhere said Ross had not proven the falsity of a specific statement that linked him to the probe . In ruling the award excessive , Schneider noted that jurors awarded $ 2.5 million for emotional distress , although Ross never sought professional counseling and &quot; there was no testimony . . . that he suffered severe or permanent harm. &quot; * Moreover , Schneider said , &quot; the court is mindful of the chilling effect that such an award would have_on First_Amendment rights. &quot; Jurors also found Ross was libeled by a statement suggesting that he had arranged an auto accident that severely injured his former lawyer , Lynn Boyd Stites , with whom Ross had had a falling_out . Coincidentally , Schneider ' s ruling in the Ross case came a day after Stites was sentenced in federal_court in San Diego to more_than 12 years in prison for masterminding an elaborate insurance fraud .</TEXT>
