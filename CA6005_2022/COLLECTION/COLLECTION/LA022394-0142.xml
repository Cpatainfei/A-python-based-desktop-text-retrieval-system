   <HEADLINE> LILLEHAMMER / ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS ; SHORT-TRACK SKATERS WIN THEIR PROTEST</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The four women of the U.S. 3 # 000-meter short-track speedskating team were in their Olympic Amphitheatre locker_room late Tuesday , crying over the injustice of their fourth-place finish , when their coach , Jack Mortell , rushed in and said perhaps the sweetest words they will ever hear in their athletic careers . &quot; Fix your hair , &quot; he said , &quot; you got a medal. &quot; Mortell protested immediately after the race because a Chinese woman , who was not skating at the time , stepped_in front of American Nikki Ziegelmeyer , who was , and caused her to fall . But when the officials results were posted and China was listed as second and the United States as fourth , the U.S. women assumed Mortell ' s pleas had failed . &quot; I thought I was going_to cry_for the rest of my life , &quot; Ziegelmeyer said . Then came the news from Mortell that China had been disqualified and the U.S. women would be awarded the bronze medal , reserving them a place on the podium with first-place South_Korea and second-place Canada . &quot; We all had to go_back to the mirror and dry our tears , &quot; said Cathy Turner , whose bronze was her third medal in the last two Olympics . She was one of three members of this year ' s 3 # 000-meter relay team , along with Ziegelmeyer and Amy Peterson , who earned a silver medal in that race two years ago at Albertville , France , where she also won a gold medal in the individual 500 meters . These U.S. women are becoming accustomed to reprieves . Without Turner , who took a year off to become the first speedskater to tour as a headliner with the Ice Capades , they failed last year to qualify for the Olympic 3 # 000-meter relay here . But only a_few days before the Winter_Olympics began , they were informed that three teams ahead of them -- Australia , Japan and North_Korea -- had withdrawn , giving them a berth . Turner and Peterson already were here to compete in individual events , but Ziegelmeyer and the fourth relay-team member , Karen Cashman , had resigned themselves to training at the U.S. Olympic Committee ' s education center in Marquette , Mich. , for next month ' s World Championships .</TEXT>
