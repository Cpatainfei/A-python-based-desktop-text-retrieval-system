   <HEADLINE> SOVIETS WARNED AMES OF CIA ' S COMPUTER TRAPS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Soviets warned spy suspect Aldrich H . Ames in 1989 to be careful in his use of CIA computers not long after the agency began a secret computer-based program to trap any double_agents inside the CIA , prosecutors and former high-ranking CIA officials said . The warning to Ames , in a nine-page letter he received from his Soviet handlers in the summer of 1989 , is cited by CIA and FBI officials as a reason to believe that there may have been someone else inside the CIA supplying highly_sensitive information to the Russians , sources said . A former top CIA official , who asked to remain anonymous , confirmed that the agency ' s operations directorate had instituted a computerized entrapment program in 1987 after a number of American-paid Soviet agents were lost in the previous two years , suggesting that information was coming from someone inside the CIA . The warning to Ames is not the only lead that a joint CIA-FBI counterintelligence investigation is pursuing as a result of the review of documents found in his possession , sources said . A June , 1993 , search of Ames ' office discovered several top secret agency documents referring to Russian intelligence matters that had nothing to do with his job . These documents were cited last week by sources as another reason investigators believe Ames may have had accomplices in the CIA .</TEXT>
