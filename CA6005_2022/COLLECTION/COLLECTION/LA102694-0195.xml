   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 188 ; TOBACCO_INDUSTRY DROPS LOW PROFILE AND AIRS TV AD</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Scrapping their low-profile strategy , tobacco_industry backers of Proposition 188 are airing television ads , opening with a public_school educator touting the measure as the best way to stop children from smoking . The television ads open with the face of Nancy Frick , vice principal at a middle_school in the Kern County_town of Lamont , and switches to a blackboard , on which is written some of the initiative ' s provisions . Frick describes Proposition 188 as the &quot; best way to keep cigarettes away from kids &quot; -- even though health experts , physicians and the California PTA are opposed to the initiative on the Nov . 8 ballot , and say the state already has tougher laws to keep children away from cigarettes . &quot; I ' ve been working with kids for 24 years , &quot; Frick says in the ad , which aired in Los Angeles Monday and was to appear in all California television markets Tuesday . &quot; I know what motivates them , and I understand the way they think . I want to stop kids from smoking . Proposition 188 will help do that. &quot; Opponents decried the ad . Betty DeFea , on the board of the California PTA , which urges a &quot; no &quot; vote on the initiative , called it &quot; unconscionable &quot; that an educator appears on a pro-Proposition 188 advertisement . &quot; that ' s pretty sneaky of the tobacco people , &quot; DeFea said . &quot; It is totally appalling that anyone involved in the schools is coming_out on the side of tobacco . It is a terrible message to pass along to children. &quot; Frick ' s voice also is_on radio ads , speaking from a longer script , as a school_bell rings in the background . A key component of the Yes-on-188 campaign involves provisions dealing with minors ' access to cigarettes . Contacted at Mountain View Middle_School in Lamont , Frick said she decided to appear in the ads , even though she knew that Gov . Pete Wilson recently signed into law a bill aimed at combatting smoking among children . State health officials say the new law is stronger than the initiative . Frick broke_off a telephone_interview , saying that she needed to supervise children on the playground . She could not be reached again . Lee Stitzenberger , strategist for the Yes-on-188 campaign , said Frick has not been paid_for her efforts . &quot; She may well take some criticism , &quot; he said . In Lamont , Frick ' s action was approved by John Chavez , superintendent of the 2 # 600-student school district . Chavez told The Times that Frick called to ask if she could appear in the radio and television ads . &quot; I told her that as an individual you can do whatever you want , &quot; Chavez said . &quot; I think we have to take a risk if we believe_in things. &quot; Chavez said he was generally unfamiliar_with 188 , but thought that it would be &quot; one step_in the right direction &quot; toward limiting children ' s access to cigarettes . Chavez added that he did not know who was financially backing the measure . When he was told that tobacco companies were funding it , he paused and asked : &quot; Why would they cut their own throats ? &quot; Philip Morris U.S.A. , the nation ' s largest cigarette maker , has spent $ 5 million on Proposition 188 so far . R . J . Reynolds Tobacco , the nation ' s second-largest cigarette maker , has spent $ 1.6 million on Proposition 188 . The initiative , which led narrowly among likely voters in a recent Los Angeles Times poll , would repeal all local smoking bans in California and block a statewide ban on smoking in most indoor workplaces from taking_effect Jan . 1 . If Proposition 188 becomes law , business owners could set_up smoking sections and no longer be forced to ban smoking outright as they must , for example , in Los Angeles . The initiative would repeal 150 local ordinances that restrict cigarette vending_machines , and prohibit local_governments from passing new smoking restrictions . The measure also would increase penalties to a maximum of $ 2 # 000 for selling tobacco to minors , and says cigarette vending_machines could not be placed in areas accessible to minors unless they are equipped with electronic locking devices controlled by business operators . But the initiative also might force repeal of the new , tougher anti-smoking law aimed at minors . The law , set to go_into effect in January , increases fines for selling tobacco to minors to $ 6 # 000 , and seeks to give the state_Department of Health Services some authority over enforcing laws barring tobacco sales to minors . Early in the campaign , Stitzenberger said he did not plan to air broadcast spots , and would focus instead on direct-mail appeals aimed at &quot; educating &quot; voters about the initiative . He changed tactics after two major health foundations put $ 2 million into an unusual broadcast and newspaper_ad campaign aimed at presenting both sides of the debate over Proposition 188 . Stitzenberger calls the nonpartisan effort outrageous , contending that tax-exempt institutions should not be involved in a campaign . He charges that the ads , while designed to be nonpartisan , take a stand against 188 by reporting that the measure is &quot; supported by tobacco companies , and opposed by health groups. &quot; &quot; What we are going_to do is not let the airwaves be dominated by this organization , &quot; Stitzenberger said , explaining the change in strategy . The Public Media Center , a nonprofit group in San Francisco , received the $ 2-million grant from the Wellness Foundation and Alliance Health Systems Foundation to design the voter-education campaign . &quot; We actually believe_in the intelligence of the California voter , &quot; said Gary Yates , interim president of Wellness . &quot; We want to make_sure people know who was making the arguments , who the key spokes-people were and who the key supporters were. &quot;</TEXT>
