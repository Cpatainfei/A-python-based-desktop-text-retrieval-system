   <HEADLINE> UCI EAGER FOR CHANCELLOR TO END SILENCE ; EDUCATION : MANY PRAISE HER ACCESSIBILITY BUT SAY IT ' S TIME FOR HER TO ' STAND_UP AND BE COUNTED. '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Less than a year into her tenure as chancellor of UC Irvine , Laurel L . Wilkening ' s task of reshaping the young university in an age of budget_cuts , faculty buyouts and a shrinking cast of key administrators has been compared to those confronted by a mythological hero . &quot; It ' s a little like cleaning_out the Augean stables , &quot; said James Fallon , a professor of anatomy and neurobiology at UCI ' s College of Medicine . &quot; She ' s trying to divert two rivers to clean_out what was there and get things moving again . I don ' t envy her at all. &quot; As her challenges seem to mount -- tuition and fees are up , budget woes linger , some key university posts are vacant , the university ' s growth spurt has slowed and campus morale has slumped -- Wilkening has been conspicuously silent . To Wilkening , it has been more important to listen during her first year than make broad pronouncements or act precipitously . &quot; I think it would be arrogant and possibly stupid to come_in here and say ' UCI , I ' ve got the answer_for you . Just listen to me . Here ' s how it is , ' &quot; she said . &quot; People would reject that , and reasonably. &quot; But now the pressure is building for Wilkening to act . &quot; There is a general feeling among the faculty that the campus is sort of adrift , &quot; said R . Duncan Luce , distinguished professor of cognitive_science and economics and a member of the committee that helped select Wilkening . &quot; And it ' s understandable that people feel that way. &quot; While Luce and many others agreed that Wilkening gets high marks for consensus building and accessibility , very soon &quot; she ' s going_to have to stand_up and be counted , &quot; he said . Wilkening has given few hints so far of her vision of the university ' s future . But no later than this summer , she faces a series of formidable decisions that finally will tip her hand on the direction she hopes to lead the school in years to come . At immediate issue are recent recommendations from two task_forces on how UCI can slice an additional $ 10.8 million from next year ' s budget , even as it struggles to absorb another $ 13.7 in state funding cuts ordered over the past three years . Together , the reductions represent the loss of more_than 16 % of UCI ' s base budget since 1990-91 . The recommendations , which include eliminating the departments_of_education and physical_education and the program in comparative culture , have brought howls of protest from those who would be affected and a flurry of anguished comments from across the campus and community . In the face of the storm , Wilkening has sought to reassure the university . &quot; I don ' t like to be this quiet , but I thought it was important to the process , &quot; Wilkening said in an interview . To speak out prematurely , she said , would undermine the broad-based , at times impassioned , discussion that has occurred throughout the campus since the task_force reports were issued in February . A university committee is now synthesizing the comments from various groups and will deliver them to Wilkening by early June . Decisions that would affect the 1994-95 budget , including the elimination of departments , must be made before the end of June , with the rest likely to be reached during the summer . For the 17 # 139 students , 1 # 028 faculty_members and 8 # 700 employees at UCI , that means continuing to wait . &quot; It ' s a time of great concern on campus , &quot; said pharmacology Professor Sue Duckles , a former chair of the university ' s Academic Senate , which represents its faculty . &quot; A lot of things are up_in_the_air , and we ' re going through very difficult times , which creates a lot of anxiety about the future. &quot; Nine months since her arrival on campus as UCI ' s first female chancellor , Wilkening , who served as provost of the University of Washington before she was selected for the top spot at UCI , has won high marks from faculty , staff and students for her accessibility , her listening skills and the quality of her interim appointments to a growing list of key administrative openings . &quot; She even gave_out her e-mail code at a faculty meeting , &quot; one professor raved . Several also praised her ability to remain calm under tremendous pressure . &quot; Any time somebody walks into the head position of an institution undergoing this kind of stress , the challenge is enormous , &quot; said John King , an information and computer_science professor . &quot; I think she ' s done a good job . She has not been party to any panic behavior and has shown a high degree of equilibrium and poise. &quot; But Wilkening ' s continuing silence on specifics of her goals makes_it difficult to assess her tenure in any substantive way , several faculty_members said . &quot; She has said quite consciously that she is not yet trying to paint her image of the university , &quot; said Luce . The degree of anxiety on campus is evident . Several professors , speaking privately , said they even worried about whether the university under Wilkening ' s leadership was likely to remain a major research university . And they said they wished she would clarify at least this fundamental aspect of the university ' s future . Wilkening agreed , at least in part . &quot; Maybe I should have said the obvious more often , &quot; she mused , seated near an open window in her sunny , fifth-floor office . For example , Wilkening said she has no intention of veering the university from its traditional mission as a major research institution . &quot; I think people want to hear me say that . People want to know that we ' re not going_to become a liberal arts college or something , &quot; she said . &quot; It would never occur to me that we would do anything but that. &quot; The chancellor also said she is aware that morale at the university is very low , a feeling echoed in interviews across the campus . &quot; Why would their morale not be bad ? &quot; she asked . She pointed to last year ' s across-the-board salary cut , three years without raises , and the layoffs of 140 staff_members since 1992 , including 10 announced last month in the closure of the UCI printing department . In addition , about 200 senior faculty_members are now eligible to retire under the University of California ' s third voluntary retirement_program , prompting anxiety among those who remain about even greater workloads , she said . The deadline for the current buyout is Friday . &quot; The future is uncertain , &quot; Wilkening said . &quot; If people didn ' t have low morale , I would think they were not tuned_in to what was going_on . &quot; But I think our opportunities are wonderful here , &quot; she argued , praising UCI ' s employees , students and the Orange County community as_a_whole for being supportive during the recent travails . &quot; We ' re in Orange County and what could be_better in terms of our future ? It ' s a very supportive place , a place that ' s going_to grow and a very livable and exciting place to be . I think that if people can just take a little bit longer view than the last few years , our future is extremely bright. &quot; But in the coming months , Wilkening also must cope_with another challenge : how to fill a growing number of critical administrative openings . Among the open positions is the post of executive vice_chancellor , the university ' s No . 2 job . L . Dennis Smith , who had also served as acting chancellor before Wilkening ' s appointment , resigned the post this spring to become president of the University of Nebraska . Lately , the list of vacancies has grown , with the resignations just last week of UCI ' s only two female vice_chancellors . M . Anne Spence , whose position in_charge of academic_programs was recently proposed for elimination , quit April 15 to return to teaching and research . On Wednesday , Kathleen T . Jones , vice_chancellor for university advancement , announced she was resigning to take a similar post at Georgetown University in Washington . Other key openings include vice_chancellor for research and graduate studies , open since last year , and the deans of the medical and engineering_schools . Dr. Walter L . Henry , the powerful head of the medical_school who was also vice_chancellor of health sciences , resigned abruptly in December after Wilkening rejected his proposal for dividing his two-tiered position into separate jobs . In March , acting_on the recommendation of a UCI faculty committee after a review , Wilkening ousted engineering dean William A . Sirignano . The two departures have come under intense scrutiny as_many on campus try to glean signs of the chancellor ' s management style and leadership abilities . The two men had held high-profile jobs for many years and had formed strong alliances among the faculty and in the community . In both cases , colleagues have expressed some concern about the long-term impact of the administrators ' departures on the two schools . But to some , the changes also indicated that Wilkening is not afraid to show leadership and is unlikely to shrink_from making the difficult choices that await her . &quot; A chancellor has to make very tough personnel calls , &quot; said King , the information and computer_science professor . &quot; I ' m glad to see that she isn ' t afraid to make these calls and stand_by them. &quot; Ron Wilson , the university ' s ombudsman since 1977 , said Henry and Sirignano were remarkably alike -- strong , forceful , demanding leaders whose views of governance may_not have jibed with what he called Wilkening ' s more collaborative approach . Wilkening declined comment on the reasons for Sirignano ' s removal , saying she was prohibited from discussing personnel matters . She said she still did not entirely understand why Henry chose to step_down . Henry could not be reached for comment . Sirignano , who is scheduled to leave his post Sept . 1 , expressed bewilderment at the time of his removal in March , and declined further comment last week . Some on campus said they were reluctant even to attempt to assess Wilkening ' s tenure so early on . &quot; She ' s only been here a little while . She hasn ' t earned a grade yet , &quot; said Dr. Stanley van den Noort , chairman of the department of neurology . But many said they had been impressed even during their initial contacts with Wilkening , praising her openness , accessibility , intelligence and an obvious desire to listen to the concerns of those at all levels of the university . &quot; She is a very open and available person who listens to whoever wants to talk to her , &quot; said Dr. Frank Meyskens , director of the clinical cancer center . &quot; She ' s a very good communicator and is quite open about wanting to know what ' s going on. &quot; But in meetings on difficult issues , said Fallon , who chairs the faculty of the medical_school , she can also be tough . At such times , Wilkening is &quot; a give-me-the-numbers , cut the B.S. kind of person , who has no trouble getting_to the essentials , &quot; Fallon said . &quot; And that creates a very positive impression of her as a leader. &quot; Student leaders , too , were positive . David Kesselman , president of undergraduate student government at UCI , said that while the real tests are clearly to come , Wilkening so far appears to be taking student concerns seriously . John F . Ronan , editor of the New University , the campus newspaper , described the change in management style with Wilkening ' s arrival as &quot; both drastic and for the better . She ' s just a really firm believer in an open , deliberative process , &quot; he said . In the year before Wilkening ' s arrival , Ronan said , he had filed about 30 requests under the federal Freedom of Information Act in_order to obtain documents from the university administration . Since then , he has needed to file only about seven such requests . &quot; We have more access to documents now , more access to how decisions are being made , &quot; Ronan said . &quot; There ' s a real wind of change blowing through that administration building. &quot;</TEXT>
