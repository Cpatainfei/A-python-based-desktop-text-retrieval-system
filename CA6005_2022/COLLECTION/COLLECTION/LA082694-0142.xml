   <HEADLINE> COMPANY TOWN : SHAKE-UP AT DISNEY ; A WHOLE NEW_WORLD ; KATZENBERG ' S DEPARTURE SETS CHANGE IN MOTION</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The imminent departure of longtime Walt Disney Studios Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg is expected to bring revolutionary changes to both the style and structure of the movie and TV empire . During Katzenberg ' s 10 years at the helm , the studio largely reflected his famous over-the-top energy and religious zeal for saving money . Meetings routinely started at 7 a.m. or earlier , and executives marched in lock step to tough business mandates . Now , with the studio separated into three divisions , the singular image will fade . Disney also falls_off the exclusive list of Hollywood studios that have maintained their stability . In announcing Katzenberg ' s departure , Disney said animation will report to Walt Disney Co . Chairman Michael D . Eisner and board Vice_Chairman Roy E . Disney . Live-action movies have been placed under the aegis of Disney-based producer and former 20th Century Fox movie chief Joe Roth and television and telecommunications under ex-studio President Richard Frank . While the management shift is not expected to have a major impact on Disney ' s TV operations , there is widespread speculation and trepidation that Roth ' s appointment will lead to executive upheaval in the motion_picture ranks -- including production , marketing and business affairs . &quot; There ' s fear in the air here for the first time in 10 years , &quot; said a highly placed Disney executive . &quot; Nobody has ever been afraid for their job , and now everybody is. &quot; Adds another , &quot; There ' s a sense of total depression . We ' re wondering where do we go from here ? &quot; Katzenberg lunched with his successor in the studio ' s executive dining_room Thursday . Conspicuously seated in the center of the rotunda , the two seemed to be sending a clear message that the baton was being cordially passed . &quot; This is the day after a very sudden , shocking set of events , &quot; said Roth , who also met with Disney divisional heads . &quot; People have to deal with their feelings . Jeffrey was the father of the group . It ' s unrealistic to expect them to blink and say , ' OK , next. ' &quot; Wall_Street reacted calmly to the changing of the guard . Disney shares fell 50 cents Thursday to $ 42.75 in modest trading on the New York Stock_Exchange . Sources said Disney launched an all-out campaign Wednesday to assure the investment community that the company is_on solid footing , with Eisner personally calling brokerages and investors . The mood was less sanguine at the Burbank studio . After a decade at the helm , Katzenberg said , the reality of leaving is traumatic . In contrast to the stoic demeanor he adopted Wednesday , when Eisner told him he would not be getting the company ' s No . 2 spot , Katzenberg came_across as openly vulnerable . &quot; I ' m an emotional basket case today , &quot; he conceded in an interview . &quot; Since I lived my job , this was my shadow family -- essentially the same one with which I grew_up at Paramount -- and I feel an overwhelming sense of loss. &quot; If Team Disney voiced reservations about the changes , Hollywood ' s creative community was upbeat . &quot; Releasing Jeffrey Katzenberg on the industry will produce as much energy as the explosion of the first atomic_bomb . It gives new people opportunities and established people the opportunities to reinvent themselves , &quot; said Joan Hyler , senior_vice_president of William Morris Agency . Despite continued speculation that Katzenberg will land at Sony Pictures Entertainment or MCA Inc. , there was no movement on that front Thursday . And Katzenberg seemed in no hurry to make his next career move . Industry observers point_out that it was nearly 10 years to the week that a similar scenario occurred at Paramount . When Barry Diller left the studio , Eisner was overlooked for the top job by his boss , parent company Chairman Martin Davis . &quot; This is a clear case of the abused child turning_around and abusing his child , &quot; said a source who was at Paramount then . Though Katzenberg and Eisner spent a good-natured hour together Thursday morning discussing the transition , loyalists of the departing studio chief insist that matters could have been handled more delicately . &quot; There was a real ugliness to it all , &quot; said one . &quot; Whatever the board_members happen to think_of him , whatever ego clashes the two of them had , Katzenberg was the chief architect of an amazing rebirth of the studio . He met with ( Eisner ) on Wednesday morning and expected that to be the beginning of discussions about his future . Right after the meeting , he was handed a press release. &quot; Others argue that things worked_out for the best . &quot; If Jeffrey had taken the next step , it would have been a good_example of the Peter Principle : everyone rising to his level of incompetence , &quot; said a leading producer . &quot; ( Frank ) Wells was a lawyer with great Wall_Street relationships . That isn ' t Jeffrey . . . but I don ' t think Jeffrey knows that. &quot; Though Roth has been affiliated with Disney as a producer for nearly two years under his Caravan Pictures deal , his anointment is viewed with concern by some studio executives . &quot; The downside of Joe is he is an unknown , &quot; said one . &quot; For starters , Joe and ( Disney motion_pictures President ) David Hoberman don ' t have a lot of mutual respect , and ( Roth ' s partner ) Roger Birnbaum is clearly in the on-deck circle. &quot; Though Caravan has a 25-picture deal with the company , which Birnbaum will reportedly oversee , speculation has him moving_into Hoberman ' s spot at some point . Because Roth will have less responsibility than Katzenberg ( who also oversaw animation , home video , Hollywood Records and the company ' s legitimate theater ventures ) and is also mandated by Eisner to decrease live-action production , insiders fear that some senior production and marketing heads might roll . Hoberman , who met with Roth on Wednesday , acknowledged that tensions exist between him and Roth , primarily because &quot; Jeffrey put us in a situation where we were competitors. &quot; As for rumors that Birnbaum might succeed him , Hoberman was philosophical : &quot; Certainly , that ' s Joe ' s prerogative , &quot; he said , &quot; I ' m happy to collect a check -- I just signed a long-term contract -- and move on. &quot; Roth categorically denied that Hoberman will be replaced . &quot; I ' d love for Hoberman to stay , but we have to figure_out the partnership , &quot; Roth said . &quot; He ' s not Roger and I ' m not Jeffrey . Besides , Roger wants to be a producer and be autonomous. &quot; Insiders point_out that Roth ' s operating style is very different from Katzenberg ' s . &quot; Joe ' s independent production experience has given him a broad view . He runs the show -- every aspect of it , &quot; said Fox Senior Executive_Vice_President Tom Sherak . Another Fox executive added : &quot; Joe is a one-man band , which is not the traditional Disney way. &quot; A senior Disney executive forecasts changes in the company ' s infrastructure , drawing an analogy with the breakup of the Soviet_Union into separate republics . &quot; The studio has been disbanded . There was one integrated division that reported directly to one person ( Katzenberg ) , and that ' s what made us different from other studios . Now there is a motion_picture division and TV division that won ' t work hand-in-glove. &quot; Shaping the Post-Katzenberg Era With the departure of Disney Studio Chief Jeffrey Kaztenberg Wednesday , Walt Disney Co . Chairman Michael D . Eisner has split Katzenberg ' s responsibilities into motion_pictures , television and animation . A look_at the new organizational structure : FILM Joe Roth , Chairman of Walt Disney Motion_Pictures * Movie production * Distribution * Marketing * Upcoming films include : &quot; Quiz Show , &quot; produced and directed by Robert Redford , &quot; A Simple Twist of Fate , &quot; starring Steve Martin and &quot; Ed Wood &quot; starring Johnny Depp and directed by Tim Burton .
