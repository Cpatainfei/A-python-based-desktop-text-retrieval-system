   <TEXT> One afternoon in 1985 , while he was listening to an East_German band tooting out a bit of Dixieland jazz , Torgau resident Guenter Schoene was hit by what he thought was a brilliant idea . would n ' t it be a fine thing , he mused , to put_on an international jazz_festival in Torgau , right on the old stone bridge that spans the Elbe_River there ? The tune &quot; Down by the Riverside , &quot; with its anti-war lyrics -- &quot; I ' m a-going to lay_down my sword and shield / Down by the riverside / Ain ' t going_to study war no more &quot; -- would make a perfect theme_song . For Torgau , as it happens , is something more_than just a sleepy backwater of the former Eastern Bloc . It was_on Torgau ' s bridge , on April 25 , 1945 , that U.S. troops from of the 69th Infantry Division of the U.S. 1st Army , working their way eastward across Hitler ' s Germany , first encountered the Soviet troops slamming in from Poland . For the soldiers who made the link-up , it was an ecstatic moment -- proof that fascism had been crushed and that the long , calamitous war in Europe would soon be over . &quot; I never kissed so many men in my life , &quot; recalled American veteran Ben Casmere , in an oral history , &quot; Yanks Meet Reds. &quot; Together the GIs and the Soviets -- a guard division of the First Ukrainian Front -- broke_out their accordions and balalaikas , toasted each other with beer and vodka , and took an informal &quot; Oath of the Elbe , &quot; in which they vowed to do all they could to prevent another war . It was this internationalist spirit that Schoene , and other self-declared Torgau pacifists , hoped to commemorate in song . &quot; My idea was to combine the message of ' Down by the Riverside ' with the historic oath of peace that was taken here by the Elbe , and apply them to the needs of the world today , &quot; Schoene says . But now -- on the anniversary week of the famed Allied encounter -- it appears that the bridge will not be around for a fete of any kind when next year ' s 50th commemoration rolls_around . The German government is poised to tear it down . &quot; that ' s the plan , &quot; confirms Torgau Mayor Wolfgang Gerstenberg in his office on Torgau ' s tidy 16th-Century town square . &quot; The old bridge is really dilapidated . It ' s more_than 100 years old . It would cost 9 million marks ( about $ 5.6 million ) to repair it , and we don ' t have the money on hand. &quot; But such talk is not something a jazz-loving history student of Torgau will countenance . Schoene and like-minded residents of the town are fighting an eleventh-hour battle to save the bridge . &quot; It was just a historical accident that the link-up took_place here , &quot; admits Uwe Niedersen , another would-be preservationist . &quot; It could have happened anywhere . But it did happen here , and it ' s the responsibility of Torgau to keep the memory alive , and not leave it as a sentence in the history books. &quot; Few Americans today could probably even locate Torgau on a map of Europe with any confidence . But half a century ago , it was a dateline of tremendous international resonance . A photographer at the time posed a_few of the U.S. and Soviet soldiers on the rubble of the bridge -- the Germans had dynamited it as they scattered -- and snapped their pictures for newspapers around the world . The low-ranking soldiers embraced each other and danced -- the first and last such brothers-in-arms hoopla between U.S. and Soviets until the end of the Cold_War . In &quot; Yanks Meet Reds &quot; ( Capra Press ) , the oral history , 1st Lt . H.W. ( Bill ) Shank of the 104th Mechanized_Cavalry Reconnaissance Troop , 104th Infantry , recalled the scene : &quot; The Russians took the five of us to dinner in a makeshift mess_hall with a long table . We and Russian officers filled both sides of the table . A refined Russian captain sat next to me . He spoke good German , so we had fair communication . . . . &quot; The meal was macaroni and meat , salami , small raw fish , raw fat , meat covered with dough , black_bread , hard-boiled_eggs , hot_chocolate , and cookies . Bottles of vodka had been spaced on the table at regular intervals , and half a water_glass of vodka set at each place . The waiters wore light-blue tunics ; every time I took a drink from my glass , the fellow behind me would refill it . Wishing to appear equal_to my Russian hosts , I kept pouring the stuff into my boot , only to have the fellow give me more.... &quot; Of all_the experiences in my life , finding and meeting the Russians was the most memorable.... The war made people love each other so_much when it was finally over . If everyone intermingled -- like we did when we linked up with the Russians -- there could be no war. &quot; An American rifleman who was there -- an English-German interpreter named Joe Polowsky -- found himself weeping at the contrast of the warm spring sunlight on the cold bodies of dead German civilians . From that day forward , until his death in 1983 , Polowsky would stand every April 25 on the Michigan Avenue bridge in his native Chicago , buttonholing strangers and urging them to join him in renewing the Oath of the Elbe and fighting the arms race . In his will , Polowsky asked to be buried in Torgau -- a wish that was granted by the former East_German government . &quot; There will be conflicts forever and ever , but this bridge proves that people from two different systems can meet and in a short time communicate , &quot; notes Niedersehn . The East_German regime had similar ideas . It found in the Torgau bridge a handy plaything for the making of peace-and-brotherhood propaganda . Every few years , it would break_out some red bunting , enlist a military_band , roll_out some Warsaw Pact jeeps and Russian officers tinkling with medals , and hold what Schoene describes as &quot; rigid &quot; ceremonies at the Elbe . Schoene didn ' t think much of the military_bands , and believed a jazz_festival would be much better . &quot; But of course , that was impossible , &quot; he says . &quot; Our leaders weren ' t interested in letting ordinary people stage such a festival. &quot; Indeed , he adds , he once tried to snap a picture of the official Communist ceremonies and was arrested for his efforts . Then came 1989 . The Berlin Wall was knocked_down , and the East_German government collapsed . With the reunification of Germany , Schoene believed that his chance to commemorate the April , 1945 , proceedings had come at long last . But what he didn ' t reckon_on was the reunified German government ' s eagerness to bring the former East ' s roads and bridges up_to Western standards . The Bundestag in Bonn has appropriated a torrent of money for infrastructure repairs , and after four years , it is now Torgau ' s turn . Already , a call_for bids has gone_out to demolition contractors . Gerstenberg says the wrecking ball could swing as early as May . Engineer Klaus Grabein , with the roads and bridges department of the state of Saxony , says the steel in the Torgau bridge is too old to be worth saving . And repairs made after the departing Nazis dynamited the bridge were poorly done , he says . But the really fatal feature of the bridge is a stone pylon that rises out of the Elbe at midstream . In 1984 , a Czech freighter steaming down the river misread the currents , hit the pylon and sank . It blocked traffic on the river for days -- and the impact to the pylon further weakened the bridge . &quot; Someone else is free to take_over the old bridge and preserve it , &quot; Gerstenberg says , &quot; but whoever does_it has to take the middle pylon out. &quot; Niedersen and Schoene have been scrambling for the funds , but their efforts so far have been fruitless . They have been in touch with officials in local , state and federal German agencies , and even at the United Nations , which by coincidence was founded on the same day as the Torgau link-up . But no one seems to agree the bridge is worth saving . * The preservationists also tried sending a letter to the mayor of New Orleans , basing a plea for help on a purported Torgau-New Orleans jazz connection . But New Orleans has written back that it can ' t afford to ship a stone bridge across the Atlantic . Torgau ' s preservationists have even written President Clinton , asking him to come play his saxophone on the bridge , and to the conceptual artist Christo , suggesting he &quot; wrap &quot; the bridge , but to no avail . Part of the preservationists ' problem is that while the bridge is primarily of interest to Americans and Red Army veterans , it stands_in Germany . And few Germans seem much interested in lavishing funds on a structure that reminds them of the past . &quot; Conservatives think , for us , this wasn ' t the hour of victory , it was the hour of defeat , &quot; Niedersen says . At the Town_Hall , however , Mayor Gerstenberg says the demolition is strictly a matter of money and has nothing to do with banishing Nazi ghosts . &quot; Even if we had the money , I can ' t imagine spending 9 million marks on the old bridge , &quot; he says . &quot; There are so many other things to be done. &quot; Grabein , the engineer , says the state of Saxony offered to save one end of the bridge for a platform where visitors could look_out_over the water and contemplate the festivities of the hope-filled afternoon half a century before . But the preservationists have rejected that plan . &quot; Imagine if Clinton comes for the 50th anniversary and asks the mayor , ' Where is the bridge ? ' &quot; Niedersen says . &quot; Mr. Gerstenberg would have to say , ' Well , this little sign is all there is left. ' I just can ' t imagine that. &quot;</TEXT>
