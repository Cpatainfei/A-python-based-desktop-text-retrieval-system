   <HEADLINE> DELAY OF TRIAL AND BAIL DENIED FOR SIMPSON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a stunning change of tactics , lawyers for O.J. Simpson on Wednesday requested a yearlong delay in the superstar athlete ' s murder trial but made_it contingent_on his release on bail -- a move they sought to allow publicity to subside before a jury hears evidence . Despite an impassioned defense argument , however , Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito denied the request -- although he will allow Simpson ' s attorneys to renew it later . As a result , the flurry of activity accomplished little beyond temporarily rocking the murder trial , where jury selection has been under way since late last month . &quot; This is an unprecedented case that requires an unprecedented remedy , &quot; said Simpson lawyer Robert L . Shapiro , forcefully asking Ito to &quot; take_charge &quot; of the case and grant bail . Simpson ' s other lead attorney , Johnnie L . Cochran Jr. , appealed_to Ito ' s sense of grandeur , asking him to grant bail despite a dearth of case_law supporting such a move . &quot; This affords Your Honor a place in history , &quot; Cochran said . &quot; This is your opportunity. &quot; Deputy Dist . Atty . Marcia Clark responded by proposing a three-month delay but vigorously arguing that no bail was warranted . Under California law , defendants in capital cases are not entitled to bail , a fact that Clark cited to the judge in warning against defying judicial precedent . &quot; The defense invites this court into the chasm of disaster , &quot; she said of Simpson ' s effort to win bail . The afternoon bombshell in the Simpson proceedings came amid a day of fast-moving developments , some of which unfolded in open court , others behind closed doors . Among them : * In a closed courtroom Wednesday morning , Simpson addressed the judge . Although transcripts of that hearing have not yet been released , Cochran said later that Simpson told Ito that he was not fleeing on the day of his arrest , when the nation watched as he and close friend Al Cowlings led police on a low-speed pursuit through Orange County and Los Angeles . * Ito appealed_to television_programs to hold_off on broadcasting interviews with Faye D . Resnick , author of a controversial new book that purports to detail the last months of Nicole Brown Simpson ' s life . Two of three programs said they would go_ahead despite Ito ' s request , but CNN ' s &quot; Larry King Live &quot; agreed to wait . * Ito put_in place a new system for questioning prospective jurors , one that had been proposed by Deputy Dist . Atty . William Hodgman last week . Under the new system , jurors will be questioned singly and will be asked about their exposure to the book as well as other issues that might make_it difficult for them to be impartial . From the opening days of the Simpson case , publicity has dogged the proceedings , creating a series of flare-ups as Ito has attempted to insulate prospective jurors from being tainted by prejudicial publicity . But the issue exploded anew this week with the release of &quot; Nicole Brown Simpson : The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted. &quot; The book was co-authored by a National Enquirer columnist and Resnick , who describes herself as the dead woman ' s best_friend while painting a seedy and controversial portrait of her . After the book ' s release , Shapiro said he no longer believed that Simpson could receive a fair trial . Prosecutors disagreed , and both sides met with Ito in a series of conferences Wednesday in an effort to find a way to guarantee a fair trial . &quot; Measures can be taken_to ensure a fair and impartial jury , &quot; Clark said during one break_in the proceedings . &quot; We ' re exploring them now. &quot; When the two sides returned to court Wednesday afternoon , however , the defense argued that the drastic remedy of a long delay was the only way to protect the jury from contamination . That represented a dramatic turn_in the defense position , which from the start has been to argue for the speediest possible trial . Indeed , even while asking_for the delay , the defense made_it clear that it only wanted a postponement if Simpson would be allowed to go free on bail . That posed a difficult argument for Simpson ' s lawyers , however , because California law generally does not allow_for bail in cases such_as this . Under California law , a defendant is presumed ineligible for bail in a capital murder case unless the defense can show that the proof of guilt is not evident or the presumption of guilt is not great . In recent years , two California appellate_courts have ruled that the statutory presumption against granting bail to a defendant in a capital murder case also applies in a special circumstances murder case , even if the district_attorney is not seeking the death_penalty . Seeking to persuade Ito to ignore the precedents , the Simpson lawyers called_on him to rise above case_law and &quot; become a jurist. &quot; At one point , they compared him to Earl Warren , a former chief_justice of the U.S. Supreme Court . Among other things , Simpson ' s lawyers maintained that their client is entitled to bail because , contrary to prosecution arguments , he had not shown any intention to flee . Cochran referred to a session in which Simpson apparently addressed the judge directly on that subject . Although transcripts were not immediately available from that session , the remarks attributed to Simpson would be his most extensive in the case , since his comments to date have been limited to perfunctory responses and his brief statement upon entering his plea -- when he famously proclaimed that he was &quot; absolutely 100 % not guilty. &quot; Cochran ' s comments indicated that Simpson had told Ito that he had not intended to flee June 17 , the day that he first failed to surrender as scheduled and then ultimately was arrested at his Brentwood home after leading police on a long , low-speed highway pursuit . As evidence , Cochran said Simpson cited the fact that when he was spotted on Interstate 5 , he was headed back toward Los Angeles , not away . Clark countered , however , that Simpson was in fact attempting to escape that day and only changed plans when he realized that he could not succeed . She also confirmed for the first time news_reports by The Times and KNBC-TV that Simpson had a large amount of cash and a passport when he was arrested . &quot; A man in possession of a gun , passport , and $ 7 # 000 or $ 8 # 000 . . . and a disguise reasonably leads a logical person to conclude that a flight was attempted but unsuccessful , &quot; Clark said . Later , she added : &quot; The People are asking that this defendant not be given the opportunity to succeed where previously he had failed. &quot; As Clark spoke , Simpson shrugged and shook his head , visibly indicating his disagreement with her portrayal of his actions that day . After briefly recessing to review the law and recent cases , Ito turned_down the defense motion . He did so without prejudice , however , meaning that Simpson ' s lawyers can renew their request later if circumstances change . &quot; I agree with you that this is a highly unusual situation , &quot; Ito said . &quot; And I appreciate the call to judicial greatness . . . . But a trial_court has to be guided by statutes and the case law. &quot; Legal experts said Ito was_on solid_ground in that ruling . &quot; The idea of granting a continuance for a year to deal with pretrial publicity was seriously misguided because the publicity would simply have heated_up all_over again as we approached the new trial date , &quot; said UCLA law professor Peter Arenella . &quot; Moreover , there is always the possibility that during the delay more damaging prejudicial information will come_out , which would irretrievably taint all prospective jurors. &quot; Myrna Raeder , a Southwestern University law professor , agreed . &quot; I can understand ( the defense ) position , &quot; she said . &quot; But it ' s a difficult one under the law , particularly where the prosecution can point to Mr. Simpson ' s low-speed chase -- from the prosecution ' s point_of_view a risk of flight. &quot; Although Ito ' s decision Wednesday at least temporarily heads_off the chance of a trial delay , it does not resolve the judge ' s continuing concerns about publicity in the case , particularly in light of this week ' s release of the Resnick book . Referring to the book Wednesday , Shapiro said it was widely available , adding : &quot; They ' re selling the books on the courtroom doorsteps. &quot; Although some analysts believe that Ito is overreacting to the book -- noting that it is just the latest in a long series of unsubstantiated accounts about the relationship between O.J. Simpson and his ex-wife -- the judge has made_it clear that he considers its publication potentially devastating . As a result , Ito launched an extraordinary campaign to mute its effect , sending letters to the president of CBS News , as well as_to talk_show hosts Larry King and Maury Povich , asking them to not air scheduled interviews with Resnick . That request raised delicate questions of media restraint , and it produced a mixed response : CNN agreed to hold_off , while Povich and CBS said they would go_ahead with their scheduled broadcasts . &quot; The interview of Ms . Resnick , no matter what its content , will serve only to fan the already raging fires of adverse publicity and further jeopardize the parties ' right to a fair trial , &quot; Ito wrote . &quot; I hope you will find it in your conscience , corporate and otherwise , to cooperate with this request and delay this program ' s broadcast until after the jury in this case has been selected and sequestered. &quot; In the book , Resnick writes that Nicole Simpson ' s ex-husband threatened to kill her on numerous occasions , some in the months immediately before her murder . Ito did not threaten action against organizations proceeding with interviews , but his request did pose a challenge to exercise restraint . It raised issues about whether programs should give credence to Resnick ' s account despite a judge ' s request that they hold_off and about whether responsible news organizations would be undermining important constitutional principles in pursuit of a racy story . &quot; At some point news organizations have to stop citing the 1st Amendment as giving them an imprimatur to do whatever they want , &quot; said Jeff Greenfield , a media and political analyst for ABC . &quot; I do believe there are times when journalists use the 1st Amendment the way a diplomat uses his passport when he is stopped for drunk driving . We have to go beyond asking ' Do we have the legal_right to do this ? ' and ask ' Are there other things at stake ? ' &quot; Greenfield declined to comment on the merits of Ito ' s request , but some lawyers and media experts said they considered it a reasonable one . &quot; When we in the press stand behind the 1st Amendment and say ' protect us ' because we wish to air a story on Ms . Resnick , who has co-authored a book with a National Enquirer writer for money . . . we undermine our argument that we are advancing democracy , &quot; said Ken Auletta , media critic for the New Yorker . Laurie Levenson , a Loyola law_school professor and frequent commentator , said she too thought Ito ' s request was understandable , given the intense publicity that surrounds the Simpson case . &quot; I think it ' s a reasonable request , &quot; she said . &quot; He ' s asking them to show some responsibility . What a novel concept. &quot; But Everette Dennis , executive_director of the Freedom Forum for Media Studies at Columbia University , said he fears that by drawing more attention to the book , &quot; Judge Ito has given it greater credibility . It ' s become the forbidden fruit now. &quot; Indeed , two of the affected programs showed little interest in abiding_by the judge ' s request . &quot; Ms . Resnick ' s book has been the focus of a great_deal of media attention , and the contents of the book have been widely publicized , &quot; CBS News President Eric W . Ober said in a letter sent to Ito on Wednesday . &quot; Accordingly , while CBS News appreciates and respects your commitment to safeguarding Mr. Simpson ' s 6th Amendment right to a fair trial , we believe that broadcasting Ms . Chung ' s interview with Ms . Resnick is fully consistent with responsible journalism. &quot; Povich said he too had considered the judge ' s request but ultimately decided that broadcasting the interview carried little risk of influencing the trial . &quot; The Resnick book is available in bookstores , &quot; Povich said . &quot; There has been all kinds of media coverage already on the book . There are other interviews scheduled . And besides all that , the judge has already instructed his potential jurors not to watch television , listen to the radio or buy newspapers , magazines or books . So I think he ' s solved his own problem. &quot; In addition , Povich ' s show is the only scheduled appearance for Resnick before a live audience . The audience , Povich said , was &quot; very skeptical &quot; of Resnick ' s claims and peppered her with questions about her drug history and her motives for writing the book . But only CNN ' s &quot; Larry King Live &quot; agreed to postpone its broadcast . &quot; In light of the court ' s fair trial concerns , in this case CNN has decided to exercise its 1st Amendment right and will delay telecast of the interviews , &quot; the network ' s public relations office in Atlanta said . When jury selection resumes today , Ito intends to question jury panel members about any exposure to the book or to coverage of it . Times staff writers Jim Newton , Robert J . Lopez and Daniel Howard Cerone contributed to this report . * ' PRIVATE DIARY ' : Scandalous , hastily written book opens a new , lurid chapter in case . B1</TEXT>
