   <HEADLINE> NATO THREAT OF AIR STRIKES MET WITH DEFIANCE ; BOSNIA : BOMBARDMENT SHUTS DOWN SARAJEVO AIRPORT , CUTTING OFF AID . PEACE TALKS IN JEOPARDY , SERBS WARN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Serbian nationalists who have laid siege to Bosnia-Herzegovina for 22 months reacted Tuesday to a NATO threat of air strikes by bombarding Sarajevo and warning that any move to stop them might scuttle paralyzed peace talks . A mortar attack on the Bosnian capital ' s airport shut_down the vital food airlift on which Sarajevo ' s 380 # 000 trapped residents depend . U.N. officials said they could not immediately determine which side in the ruthless struggle for the capital had fired those shots . Relief flights to Sarajevo have been canceled for most of the past week because of intensified Serbian shelling of the densely populated city_center and the airport , which is under U.N. control but unable to operate when under assault . Tuesday ' s shelling , however , was said by the U.N. commander in Sarajevo to have been provoked by an initial outgoing barrage by the Muslim-led government . At a summit in Brussels , President Clinton and other leaders of the North_Atlantic_Treaty_Organization renewed a 5-month-old threat to launch air strikes against Bosnian Serbs if they persist with the strangulation of Sarajevo and expanded the warning to include other besieged enclaves . Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic showed defiance even before the NATO leaders worked_out the final wording of their threat . &quot; If the anti-Serb resolution is adopted , it will not help the peace process but would jeopardize it , &quot; Karadzic told the Bosnian Serb news_agency SRNA from his mountain stronghold in Pale . His nationalist followers kept_up their artillery assault on Sarajevo throughout the day , which the commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia , Belgian Gen . Francis Briquemont , said was instigated by government shelling . At least nine people were killed in the artillery exchange . Bosnian Serbs , Croats and the government have been engaged in Western-mediated peace talks for 17 months and are scheduled to resume the costly peripatetic meetings in Geneva next Tuesday . Karadzic , who was blamed by leaders of the European Union ( formerly the European Community ) for blocking progress at the last negotiating session in Brussels just before Christmas , underscored his warning against the NATO declaration by saying it &quot; would prompt us to reconsider land concessions offered to the Muslims. &quot; Under the mediation of EU envoy Lord Owen and his U.N. counterpart , Thorvald Stoltenberg , Karadzic and the Bosnian Croat leader , Mate Boban , have drafted a plan for dividing Bosnia into three ethnic ministates , with half of the republic going_to the Serbs , about 17 % to Boban ' s forces and one-third destined to remain under Bosnian government rule . Although Karadzic ' s rebels have yet to withdraw from any of the territory they have agreed to cede to rump Bosnia in exchange for capitulation , his comments to SRNA suggested even less of the occupied land would now be_on offer at the peace talks . NATO ' s warning , which includes possible air strikes in the besieged eastern towns of Tuzla and Srebrenica , was also aimed at pressuring the Serbs to comply with deployment and aid delivery plans of the U.N. Protection Force , which has been thwarted in its effort to rotate fresh peacekeeping troops into Srebrenica . UNPROFOR has also made little progress in getting Serbian compliance with plans to open Tuzla airport , which the Office of the U.N. High_Commissioner for Refugees needs as a staging ground for relief missions . Serbian obstacles put_up in the east and fighting between Croats and Muslims in central Bosnia have blocked aid convoys . The U.N. relief agency has expanded the amount of food airdropped to starving and isolated Muslim communities because of difficulties in transporting the crucial supplies by road , said UNHCR spokeswoman Alemka Lysinski . The Reaction in Bosnia : More Bullets The action taken Tuesday on Bosnia-Herzegovina , which is undergoing the worst fighting in Europe since World_War_II . THE ANNOUNCEMENT NATO leaders extended the threat of air strikes against Bosnian Serbs to try to force open a key airport and relieve a besieged U.N. peacekeeping unit . THE U.N. REACTION U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali &quot; welcomed the political will expressed in the final communique of the Brussels summit , which will strengthen the U.N. role and actions in favor of peace , &quot; his spokeswoman said . THE REACTION ON THE FRONT_LINES Warring factions continued to shell Sarajevo , halting relief flights into the city just hours after they had resumed , and Muslim-Croat fighting raged in central Bosnia . AIR STRIKES WOULD BE USED . . . 1 . To force open a key airport for relief flights ( Tuzla ) 2 . Relieve a trapped Canadian peacekeeping unit ( Srebrenica ) THE &quot; SAFE AREAS &quot; Six mainly Muslim enclaves were designated by the United Nations last year as &quot; safe areas &quot; to be protected . They are currently encircled by Serb artillery and cut_off from each other . The six areas : Sarajevo , Tuzla , Bihac , Srebrenica , Zepa and Gorazde . BACKGROUND Serbian rebels bent_on taking territory for a Greater Serbia have conquered 70 % of Bosnia . Croatian nationalists -- partly inspired by the Serbs ' unsanctioned land grab -- have firmed_up control over most of the rest . The toll : 200 # 000 Bosnians dead and more_than 2 million homeless . American policy precludes stationing U.S. troops in the former Yugoslavia . But the Clinton_Administration has offered to supply up_to 25 # 000 American forces to police a ceasefire in the currently unlikely event of a peace settlement .</TEXT>
