   <HEADLINE> RECREATION ; ROLL PLAYING ; GALVANIZED BY THE POPULARITY OF IN-LINE SKATING AND SEEING THE PROS ON ICE , STREET HOCKEY IS GROWING AS A HOBBY AND ORGANIZED RECREATIONAL SPORT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In 1988 , Bryan Garland took_over a recreational foot-hockey league in Buena Park . The sputtering organization was not in good_shape . After attracting a high of about 30 adult teams in the mid- ' 80s , the 10-year-old league had dwindled to just 15 entries . Today , however , Garland and his partner , Gil Morrison , can scarcely believe that this same league -- since moved to Garden Grove -- consists_of more_than 85 foot- and 190 roller-hockey teams . ( Ann Victor , director of public relations for the Anaheim Bullfrogs of the professional Roller Hockey International League , said the duo ' s California Street Hockey Assn . may be the largest organization of its kind in the country. ) &quot; We always thought we could run a successful league ( back in ' 80s ) , &quot; said Garland , who operates the league full time in conjunction with the city of Garden Grove . &quot; There were a lot of East Coast transplants from ( hockey hot beds ) Boston , New York and Chicago living_in the area . But I don ' t think any of us predicted it would become this popular. &quot; Galvanized by the recent popularity of in-line roller_skating and professional ice_hockey , street hockey is among the fastest rising recreational sports in Southern California . There are more_than a dozen adult and / or youth street hockey_leagues in and around the Orange County area . While a_few of these leagues have foot-hockey divisions , the majority of them are upstart organizations catering solely to the burgeoning number of roller-hockey enthusiasts . Some of whom are obsessed . Shari Hitt plays hockey about five days a week and is in three roller divisions in the Garden Grove league . Her Black_Widows team takes_part in both the all-women and adult rookie divisions . In the latter category , her unit goes_up against male dominated teams . She also plays_on a co-ed team . The Long_Beach resident said she has participated in a multitude of sports from volleyball and softball to skiing and mountain biking . Yet she ' s given them all up since she took_up roller hockey about two years back . &quot; There ' s no other sport that compares , &quot; she said . &quot; It uses everything you ' ve got . You have to use your physical and mental ( abilities ) . I love it . It ' s an addiction. &quot; Sally Jamison of Cypress may be the ultimate roller-hockey mom , with five boys age 8 to 15 participating in the Garden Grove league . And her in-line-skating , 6-year-old daughter is eager to join a team . Jamison doesn ' t find her children ' s passion for roller hockey difficult to fathom . &quot; They like the movement . They can use their talents as good skaters as well as their other physical skills . They want something that ' s fast-paced . It ' s not like golf. &quot; Jamison also finds comfort in the fact that roller hockey is set_up to be much safer than ice_hockey . The vast majority of recreational street-hockey leagues have non-checking rules that penalize players who deliberately use the rough body contact allowed_in ice_hockey . The plastic pucks used in adult and teen roller hockey are also lighter than the hard-rubber pucks used in ice_hockey . ( Many foot and preteen roller leagues use soft plastic balls instead of pucks. ) The rabid response to the game so impressed Garden Grove officials that the city recently built a $ 90 # 000 outdoor playing facility for the local league and community . The rink is scheduled to open Saturday . The Garden Grove Roller Hockey Park -- which contains the rink , a playground and several baseball_diamonds -- sits on Chapman Avenue , just east of Harbor Boulevard . The 180-by-85-foot street-hockey rink is longer by about 40 feet than the Garden Grove league ' s two mid-size rinks at the Chapman Sports Complex , at Chapman Avenue and Knott Street . ( The Garden Grove league plans to run games at both sites. ) Unlike the rinks at the Chapman Sports Complex , the playing facility at the Garden Grove Roller Hockey Park is a Cadillac operation , including plexiglass walls , players ' benches , penalty_boxes and a grandstand . It ' s sure to rank as one of the most attractive outdoor roller-hockey rinks in Southern California . For league moguls Garland and Morrison , the Garden Grove Roller Hockey Park arrives_at an ideal time . Their league added more_than 60 teams this year in new roller divisions for children under 6 , women , high-schoolers and college players . The organization already had firmly established categories for adult foot hockey and youth and adult roller hockey . Other Orange County communities and budding street-hockey entrepreneurs have also found themselves scrambling to satisfy a public demand for organized leagues and rinks . In Dana Point , starting a youth street-hockey program was a matter of &quot; self-preservation. &quot; According to Kevin Evans , the recreation superintendent there , &quot; We found that a lot of our tennis and basketball_courts were being utilized for makeshift hockey rinks . We were also getting complaints from the community about kids playing roller hockey in the middle of the streets . So we had a ( small , 120-by-60-foot ) roller-hockey rink built_in our tennis_court earlier this year and away we went. &quot; In Irvine last year , volleyball coach Gary Coffey decided to start a summer roller-hockey league &quot; just for the fun of it. &quot; His sons had started to play , and there was space for two small rinks in an indoor facility where he coached . The response to his Orange County Roller Hockey organization was so great that he now runs three eight-week seasons during the year . About 50 teams participate in youth and adult divisions . Coffey is negotiating to move his league into a more spacious building to accommodate larger rinks . This upward spiral of street hockey in Southern California began when Wayne Gretzky was traded to the Los Angeles Kings by the Edmonton Oilers in August , 1988 . Widely considered ice_hockey ' s best player , The Great One helped give the sport a strong identity in an area where it had long been treated with cool detachment . And during the past several years , the birth of the wildly popular Anaheim Mighty Ducks in the National Hockey_League and the Anaheim Bullfrogs and Los Angeles Blades of the fledgling Roller Hockey International League helped make street hockey even more alluring . Last season the Mighty Ducks averaged 16 # 989 fans and the Bullfrogs 10 # 100 per game at the 17 # 174-seat Pond of Anaheim . But it has perhaps been the widespread popularity of in-line skating -- particularly among kids -- that has given street hockey its biggest boost . Young skaters often acquire an interest in roller hockey . &quot; I started in-line skating first with friends when I was 13 , &quot; said Mario Cueva , 16 , who participates in an indoor league operated by Stuart ' s Roller World in Fullerton . &quot; I also did some ice_skating . Then I saw some hockey_leagues . Since I could skate and I liked hockey , I decided to join. &quot; For many adults and youths , in-line roller hockey is attractive because it encompasses many of the characteristics of ice_hockey without that sport ' s relatively high costs and inconveniences . Because there are so few ice_rinks in Southern California , ice_hockey players can find themselves paying higher fees to play late at night or early in the morning . &quot; I always wanted to play ice_hockey , but I lived_in Corona , where there is no ice_rink , &quot; said Garland , a longtime foot-hockey player . &quot; I would have had to practice in Brea at 5 a.m. a lot of times , and then I would have had to drive all_over the place to other rinks to play other teams . You ' ll see a growth in ice_hockey because of the popularity of the Kings and Ducks . More ice_rinks will get built . But it will always be an expensive sport. &quot; It can cost two to four times more per game to play ice_hockey than roller hockey in Southern California . A roller player can join a league for as little as $ 60 for a 10-game season . One youth roller-hockey organization run_by the city of San Juan Capistrano even offers scholarships and lends equipment to financially challenged families . Garland ' s Garden Grove league also offers registration discounts to some low-income families . Roller leagues usually require players to purchase their own playing gear , but some organizations provide jerseys and the more expensive goalie equipment . Once the players are outfitted and ready for the faceoff , they ' ll find the game ' s emphasis is more on skating ability than physical play . The non-checking rules and use of four skaters and a goalie per team ( as opposed to ice_hockey ' s five skaters and a goalie ) in many teen and adult leagues can make_for a fast and high-scoring game . When roller hockey is played indoors on a hard , plastic-tile surface called Sports Court , the action can be even more fevered . Stuart ' s Roller World in Fullerton and Orange County Roller Hockey in Irvine are two leagues that offer this faster playing surface . Most roller facilities have concrete or wooden floors . But just because you ' re playing on squatty little wheels instead of precarious steel blades doesn ' t mean the sport is as easy to master as an empty-net goal . Most roller-hockey players warn it requires much time and practice to become a proficient in-line skater . Because the wheels are in_line , some participants say skating can be as difficult to master as ice_skating . The major difference is that in-line skates don ' t allow_for the quick stops that can be made with ice_skates . &quot; Rather than taking the edge of your blades and biting into the ice like you do with ice_skates , you do quick turns . You do circular motions ( to stop ) , &quot; Garland explained , adding that in-line skates have made roller hockey a more enticing game because they offer players more speed and maneuverability than the old four-wheel jobbies . As for foot-hockey players , most are adults who took_up the sport before in-line skating helped make the roller game all_the rage . Many of these players remain staunch supporters of foot hockey , which generally requires better conditioning than the roller version . But just about everyone agrees that the tide of street hockey is quickly and most definitely turning toward the roller game . Even some long-time foot hockey_players are turning_in their tennis_shoes for in-line skates . Dave Tuckman ' s team , the Barbarians of the Garden Grove league , recently moved_over from the foot_soldiers . The Lake Forest computer-chip salesman underscores how tough the transition can be . He spends several nights a week just practicing skating . &quot; You have to make the commitment to learn how to skate well if you ' re going to play roller hockey , &quot; said Tuckman , a transplanted New Yorker . &quot; It ' s worth it . It ' s so_much more fun on skates . It ' s more like real hockey. &quot; Just how popular roller hockey will become is uncertain . But it ' s clearly off to a blazing start in Southern California . Even the National Hockey_League ' s current work_stoppage hasn ' t slowed roller hockey ' s momentum . And there ' s serious talk_of elevating it from a club status in high_schools to a California Interscholastic Federation sport . &quot; We ' ve had a lot of parents come_up_to us and say , ' My kids are only playing roller hockey now . We can ' t get them back into baseball , ' &quot; Garland said . &quot; It ' s such an addictive sport . Its ( growth ) is going_to be amazing . You can see it now . Two years ago you didn ' t see anyone playing it . Now you see kids on every block playing it. &quot; Primer to Roller Hockey Roller hockey , the sport in which players lace_up in-line skates and joust on indoor and outdoor rinks , is booming in Orange County . A look_at the game , the garb and the ground_rules : * ( Not-So ) Rink-a-Dink The typical rink is at least 180 feet long and 70 feet wide . Roller Hockey International , the sport ' s governing board , recommends 200 feet by 85 feet . The surface must be surrounded by at least a four-foot wall to keep the puck in_play . Center_line Faceoff spot Goal Penalty bench Player Roles Teams have four skaters -- a center , winger and two defensemen -- plus a goalie . Center Winger Defense Goalie * Rules to Roll By * Playing time : Four 12-minute quarters , 15-minute halftime ; two-minute breaks between quarters . Home team chooses goal ; teams change at halftime . * Game start : Faceoff at rink center . After a timeout : Game resumes at the faceoff spot nearest where play ceased . * Shootout : Game cannot end in a tie . Five players on each team take one shot each at guarded goal , alternating sides until all have shot . Team with best score wins . Shootout repeated until tie is broken . * Game Gear Even though players skate softly and carry a big flat stick , protective gear is a must . Here ' s what they need to get rolling : Skate Close-Up The in-line skate is the most important tool of roller hockey . Main rule : Never buy for the wheels -- they ' ll quickly wear_out and need replacing . Look_for a snug , comfortable fit and durability . Other factors : * Wheels : Larger strides mean larger wheels . Sizes range from 72 to 76 millimeters . Relative hardness of a wheel is measured in durometers . Choose a soft wheel ( 78A ) to grip surfaces better . A hard wheel ( 85A ) is great for speed . * Frames : Make certain frame can fit 76-millimeter wheel . Nylon frames are less expensive , good for beginners . Faster , power players will want to try light , aluminum frames . * Boot : Look_for a flexible yet stiff boot to prevent ankle injuries . Nylon provides immediate comfort and removable liner ( for laundering ) . * Note : Goalie can wear five-wheel skates ; all others must wear four wheels . Helmet : Vented , light plastic Elbow_pads : Molded to fit contour and movement Gloves : Thick rubber covers fingers and forearms Hip_pads : Thick padding worn under uniform Kneepads : Lightweight foam and nylon for snug fit Stick : Wood , carbon composite or aluminum ; no longer than 60 inches The Floor : Basic roller hockey surfaces : concrete , plastic-interwoven tile and wood . The Puck : A roller hockey_puck , made of plastic , is lighter than an ice_hockey puck . Beveled runners work best on smooth surfaces , flat runners on a textured surface . * Hockey Faceoff Although they are similar , roller hockey and ice_hockey do have basic differences : Roller Hockey_Players : Four skaters plus goalie Periods : Four 12-minute quarters with a halftime Final Score : Shootout breaks ties Contact : Body check constitutes a foul Ice_Hockey Players : Five skaters plus goalie Periods : Three 20-minute periods Final Score : Game can end in tie Contact : Body and hip checks allowed Sources : Roller Hockey International ; Anaheim Bullfrogs ; Roller Hockey Magazine , World Book Encyclopedia ; Researched by APRIL JACKSON / Los Angeles Times Hockey Basics These basic drills can hone hockey skills . To improve passing and shooting skills , players should practice snapping their wrists and sweeping , not slapping , the puck . Stick-Handling Drill Place 10 small obstacles in a row . Straddling the row , push puck between obstacles . Repeat , skating backward . Tip : Key is to avoid obstacles while moving puck around them ; do_it with head and eyes up rather than watching the puck . Skating Drill Standing with knees slightly bent , push_out to the side until leg is fully extended . Repeat on same side until reaching end of rink ; repeat on other leg . Tip : Skating in a straight_line on same leg for a_few hundred feet will develop muscle strength and good form . Deke Drill Tip : This basic drill helps perfect faking . Use it on goalies to make them move laterally , creating a shooting zone . Guide puck to cone at comfortable pace , lean shoulders and head one direction , then hit puck opposite way .
