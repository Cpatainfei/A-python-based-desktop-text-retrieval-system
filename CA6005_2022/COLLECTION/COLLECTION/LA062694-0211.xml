   <HEADLINE> LOOSE THREADS ; CROSS COLOURS WAS ONCE THE CLOTHING LABEL OF CHOICE FOR THE HIP HOP CROWD . BUT THE COMPANY ' S UNRAVELING WAS AS DRAMATIC AS ITS OVERNIGHT SUCCESS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So in_love , so_much in_love . . . . &quot; The sound_system at Dejaiz is pumping All-4-One ' s silken remake out into the halls of the Fox Hills Mall , reeling in young African Americans in the mood for Hugo Boss and Guess ? and Perry Ellis and Calvin Klein . At the back of the store , assistant manager Devin Smith is rummaging through a round-rack of marked-down T-shirts . &quot; Two years ago kids were running in here saying , ' You got any Cross Colours ? ' &quot; Smith finds what he ' s looking_for : an X-large T-shirt emblazoned with the Cross Colours logo -- yellow ( &quot; for the sun &quot; ) , red ( &quot; for the blood of the people &quot; ) , green ( &quot; for the earth &quot; ) and black ( &quot; for the color of our skin &quot; ) . It looks_like an African tribal banner when he holds it up . You remember Cross Colours ? Hooded sweats , baggy knee-length shorts and sueded denims printed with phrases like &quot; Stop D Violence &quot; and &quot; Educate to Elevate &quot; and &quot; Clothing Without Prejudice. &quot; It was everywhere in 1992 and so were its owners , Carl Jones , who was responsible_for the concept , and T.J. Walker , who was responsible_for the design . Autumn , 1990 , was a dicey time to start a business in Los Angeles . Real_estate was contracting . The Gulf War loomed . The whole world was watching CNN and holding its breath the day Jones and Walker started Cross Colours out of Jones ' house in the Hollywood Hills . Less than a year later , the company had shipped $ 15 million worth of orders and was employing 75 workers in a 30 # 000-square-foot office and warehouse in Vernon . Until they came_along , no one had ever mass-produced African American teen fashion . They saw a market no one else had -- young black America and its many wanna-bes -- and went_for it . But Carl Jones and T.J. Walker were more_than just fashion ' s latest flashes . &quot; Crafted with pride in South-Central Los Angeles , &quot; their promo materials boasted . Jones and Walker put their own pictures on their hangtags , so , Jones told a Los Angeles Times reporter that year , &quot; that people would know what we look_like . We weren ' t afraid to say we ' re black and design for black people. &quot; In 1992 , Jones and Walker were becoming culture heroes . &quot; It happened right when it was cool to be black and MTV was first playing rap , &quot; says Eric Wical , a former merchandise manager for Merry-Go-Round , one of the nation ' s leading clothing chains . &quot; I ' ve never seen such a lineup of stars. &quot; Arsenio Hall did his show in Cross Colours . Preteen rappers Kris Kross wore oversize Cross Colours backwards on MTV . Cross Colours dressed veterans like Stevie Wonder and newcomers like Heavy D and Mary J . Blige . At the Grammys , Parliament-Funkadelic looked dipped in Cross Colours . One day , Paula Abdul would pay Cross Colours a visit . The next day it would be Shaquille O ' Neal . &quot; It was like rock ' n ' roll combined with the garment business , &quot; one former executive remembers fondly . Cross Colours was the model of a progressive company . Women were in prominent , well-paying , decision-making positions . The work_force was probably the most integrated in the business . Jones and Walker hired inner-city teen-agers who promised to wean themselves from drugs and gangs . They put_on a benefit with KPWR , L.A. ' s leading urban music station , that raised $ 50 # 000 for job training . They gave $ 200 # 000 in clothes to the Common_Ground Foundation , a dropout prevention program in Watts . They opened &quot; Red , Black and Green &quot; warehouse stores in Pomona , Compton and Downtown . Their store next to Larry Parkers diner in Beverly Hills was Jones ' prototype for an &quot; urban Gap &quot; chain . In December , 1992 , Cross Colours moved again , this time to 150 # 000 square_feet in the City of Commerce . By now there were around 300 employees . In an article in the California Apparel News , the bible of the West Coast garment business , Jones predicted that Cross Colours would book $ 100 million in women ' s line orders alone from Merry-Go-Round in 1992 . That same month , Cross Colours surpassed Williwear as the largest African-American-owned business in the industry . In 1993 , Black Enterprise magazine named Threads 4 Life , Cross Colours ' parent corporation , its &quot; Company of the Year &quot; and placed it 10th on the magazine ' s list of 100 top black firms , ahead of Black Entertainment Television and the parent company of Essence magazine . In 1994 , Fortune magazine wrote that Jones and Walker were among &quot; America ' s smartest young entrepreneurs. &quot; Today , Cross Colours has all but disappeared , its manufacturing and warehousing operation shuttered , its vast staff a thing of the past . Creditors , including the Bank of New York and L.A. ' s Imperial Bank , are picking_over the bones . According to Ben Siegel , an attorney involved in the process , secured creditors might see a return of 50 cents or less on the dollar . &quot; Failures are common in the apparel_industry , but not as high profile as this , &quot; says Wical , &quot; not with these extremes of success and failure. &quot; In three years , a company that had captured the imagination of the industry and embodied the best hopes of a community went from start-up to $ 80 million in sales to liquidation . CARL JONES AND T.J. WALKER ARE HARD AT_WORK IN a quiet design studio in the heart of that great swatch of garment businesses that spreads south from Downtown . Their nearly identical Range Rovers are parked next to each other in a gated lot . A set of heavy Victorian couches covered in deep , rich purple and red-gold velour are among the few mementos of Cross Colours ' glory years . An old James Brown tune , &quot; It ' s a New Day , &quot; is playing softly somewhere as they greet their visitor in a small office . Samples of their new_lines hang_on the walls . Jones , now 40 , looks preppy in a button-down broadcloth shirt , polished black loafers and white socks . His hair is touched with gray . He ' s a charmer , a soft-spoken , natural-born salesman . Walker is courtly in an old-fashioned Southern way , but guarded . He lets Jones do most of the talking . Jones is philosophical about Cross Colours ' reversals . &quot; What happened to us happens to a lot of fast-growing companies in this industry , &quot; he insists , citing the recent spectacular crash-and-burn of avant-garde New York designer Stephen Sprouse . He says it ' s unlikely he ' ll ever go_back into production . &quot; Now we ' re a design company . that ' s what we do best. &quot; Jones grew_up in Watts . &quot; The riots in ' 65 happened literally outside my back door. &quot; He got his drive , he says , from his dad , an ambitious man who worked as a mechanic , ran an auto parts store and sold used cars . ( He was murdered in a robbery in 1983. ) The family wasn ' t rich , but his mom made_sure he and his brother and sister always had food on the table , clean clothes on their backs and a positive attitude . &quot; I always thought I ' d be successful if I applied myself and stayed with it . I always wanted to own nice things. &quot; As soon as the family could afford to , they moved to Inglewood . Jones says art led him to fashion . &quot; I was always intrigued with the business of it , with designers who had their own companies like Calvin Klein , Ralph Lauren and Bob Mackie. &quot; While attending El Camino Community_College in 1980 , he took a home_economics class and started making dresses . &quot; My dad thought I was crazy . He thought I had become gay. &quot; In 1982 , after graduating from L.A. Trade Tech , Jones opened a small business , silk-screening socks , T-shirts and other garments . &quot; I ' d take my little briefcase and knock_on doors and sell ' em samples. &quot; Surf wear , which is graphics-heavy , was happening at the time , so that ' s what he did , designing for Guess ? ( where he met his wife , Audrey ) , i.d. and Ocean Pacific . In 1985 , as his business started to grow , Jones advertised for a new graphic_artist . Walker was living_in his car when he answered Jones ' ad . They ' ve worked together ever since . Slight , almost frail-looking , Walker comes from a big Mississippi farm family . After studying graphic design and printmaking at Louisiana Tech , he came_to California , he says , because it was warm . In 1986 , Jones and Walker hooked_up_with a Moroccan-born , French-Canadian garment manufacturer named Orly Dahan . Together they created Surf Fetish , producing hard-core designs for the landlocked masses . After beachwear played_out , Surf Fetish added skateboarding . After that it was biker wear . &quot; Carl went_through phases with us , &quot; Dahan recalls . &quot; When I first knew him , he would dress every day like a beach bum -- white shirt and white pants . He brought a Bronco to carry his surfboard . Then he turned_to skateboarding . He pierced his ear , wore Vision Street Wear -- only black -- and skulls . Then motorcycles started happening . He buys one Harley , two Harleys , three Harleys , four Harleys . He had really , really beautiful bikes . Then he buys a Range Rover to pull his motorcycles . He wanted to buy a Harley franchise ! He rode with actors , producers , trendy people . He gets so involved in his character . But his character would change. &quot; In 1989 , says Dahan , Jones and Walker became interested in what the trade calls ethnic clothing , which means product for inner-city stores . That year , Bobby Brown ' s &quot; Every Little Step &quot; was in heavy rotation on MTV . According to Dahan , his wife took_a_look at Brown in harem pants on the video , the crotch down to his knees , and said : &quot; We can do that. &quot; They formed a new label called Fetish Blues to make the pants and , in Dahan ' s words , &quot; they blew_out of the stores. &quot; Several million dollars in_orders came from Merry-Go-Round , a 1 # 400-store chain that became a major force in young_men ' s clothing in the late ' 80s . It tripled in size by &quot; spotting new trends early and jumping_on them big-time , &quot; says Wical , and by taking_over chains like Dejaiz , which had inner-city leases , and Chess King . Intrigued by the success of the harem pants , Jones and Walker began visiting stores in Los Angeles and New York , seeing what was selling . They looked_at what filmmaker Spike Lee was doing with his Spike ' s Joint stores , which sell clothing and movie souvenirs . Walker even designed the label for Lee ' s line of clothes . When Orly Dahan talks_about Carl Jones , there ' s a shiver of awe in his voice -- a tone often reserved for those who have hit pay_dirt . &quot; Eventually , Jones understood one thing , &quot; says Dahan , &quot; that he was an African American. &quot; Jones split from Dahan in October , 1990 , to start his own company , taking Walker and others along . Dahan , now vice_president of the Fetish Group , an L.A.-based clothing company , says there are no hard feelings now . &quot; I thought it was a great idea . He saw the opportunity and did what he had to do : He lived his clothing . There was no blacker person in the world when he was doing Cross Colours than Carl Jones , &quot; he says . &quot; There was no whiter person than him when he was doing surf. &quot; Jones and Walker knew they had only a_few months to design their first collection and manufacture samples for MAGIC , the men ' s apparel show at the Las Vegas Convention Center . The spring show , when manufacturers preview their new_lines and stores are looking_for back-to-school fashions , is the year ' s biggest buy . &quot; We didn ' t have any idea what we were going_to do , &quot; Walker recalls . They got a $ 175 # 000 bank loan but that didn ' t go_far . &quot; I had a Ferrari , &quot; Jones says . &quot; I sold it . I had a collection of motorcycles . I sold them. &quot; Ultimately , Jones financed the new_line with his American Express card . Just a_few days before the show , Walker and Jones finished their first collection : jeans covered in graffiti-print ; T-shirts silk-screened with images of African masks ; overalls with an inch-wide tape of Kente cloth down the side seam . &quot; We had panic days , &quot; Jones recalls . &quot; We thought maybe we ' d hyped ourselves. &quot; They called a white_woman they knew who bought for Bullock ' s . &quot; Was it too ethnic ? &quot; they worried . &quot; Would you buy_it ? &quot; &quot; Don ' t worry , &quot; she assured them . &quot; It ' s really cool stuff. &quot; Cross Colours came_up with its slogan , &quot; Clothing Without Prejudice &quot; -- which was plastered on T-shirts , posters and hang-tags -- because , Jones explains , &quot; we wanted everybody to buy it. &quot; Just about everybody did . Cross Colours , the only black-owned company in the Convention Center , took $ 5 million in_orders -- including $ 1.5 million from Merry-Go-Round -- in four days , Jones says . DEBORAH PALMER IS STRIKING -- A 6 ' 2 &quot; BLOND aerobics instructor with the sinewy shoulders of someone who rowed in a college crew . She ' s also a men ' s clothing designer and a self-described &quot; rap maniac &quot; whose walls are covered with African masks from the collection of her mother , who is half African American . She went_to work for Cross Colours just before the ' 91 MAGIC show . &quot; The hype was already building , &quot; she recalls . &quot; You felt_like you were in the middle of a whirlwind. &quot; Titles meant almost nothing at Cross Colours -- no one had a job description and Jones frequently proffered and withdrew titles the same day -- but over the next 2 1 / 2 years , Palmer served as vice_president of production and operations , then vice_president of sales and merchandising . &quot; There was a really great street energy . Every idea was valued -- no matter whether you were white , black , yellow -- because nobody knew where it was going. &quot; Colette Bailey , an African American from the West_Side partial to Doc Martens and heavy metal , was a production assistant for Pepe jeans , but &quot; wanted the opportunity to work for a black-owned company. &quot; She became manager of Cross Colours ' children ' s division , which ended_up among its most profitable . She was also at various times the division ' s chief designer , merchandiser and production manager . &quot; The working conditions were so bad , &quot; she shakes her head ruefully . The roof leaked so badly &quot; you had to wear rubber-soled shoes when it rained. &quot; In the beginning , there was no floor_plan , no planning of any kind . Departments would spring_up everywhere . &quot; We ' d set_up a computer terminal , &quot; says Palmer , &quot; and suddenly a 15-person department would grow_up around it. &quot; Jones didn ' t even have a desk . &quot; He ' d sit in the lobby and be_on the phone , &quot; says Bailey . &quot; You ' d come_in and he ' d be working_at your desk. &quot; Every office had its own radio . Everyone was in their 20s and 30s . It went without saying , but everyone worked Saturdays because Jones and Walker always worked Saturdays . You partied with people from Cross Colours . You lived with people from Cross Colours . They were your family . &quot; It wasn ' t a job , &quot; Palmer laughs , &quot; it was an adventure . When you first started working there , you thought , ' My God , this is the most fun I ' ve ever had in my life. ' You were just on an adrenaline high all day long. &quot; In 1991 , Karl Kani was 23 years old and had been in Los Angeles for a year , selling his intricately decorated jeans out of his Hollywood apartment , shipping them to stores back in Brooklyn that specialized in black fashion . Within a month of meeting Jones , Kani was working_out of Cross Colours ' headquarters in the City of Commerce . Threads 4 Life was soon distributing the Karl Kani line : baggy jeans in orange and jade , color-coordinated T-shirts and baseball_caps -- everything stamped with &quot; Karl Kani &quot; on it blew_out of the stores , too . At the 1992 MAGIC show , Jones says , Kani ' s line did close to $ 6 million in sales . Looking_back , that show might have been Cross Colours at its most hyped . Public Enemy ' s &quot; Fear of a Black Planet &quot; boiled from the turntables in the Cross Colours booth . &quot; It was so loud the golf clothes manufacturer in the next booth couldn ' t even hear to take orders , &quot; remembers Scott Sigman , a former vice_president of production who now holds the same job for Cherokee sportswear . &quot; You couldn ' t even get_into our booth to buy anything unless you were_on the guest list. &quot; &quot; The aisles around our booth were so packed , the fire_department threatened to come_in and force everybody to disperse , &quot; Bailey recalls , still amazed . &quot; I would walk the show with T.J. and people would yell out , ' I want to work for you ! I want to work for you ! ' I had never seen people act that way around clothes before. &quot; By the end of the first day , Cross Colours had $ 10 million in_orders . By week ' s end , $ 40 million . Everything Jones and Walker touched seemed to turn_into cash . In 1992 , the 1 # 500-showroom CaliforniaMart , the largest wholesale apparel center in the world , voted Cross Colours its &quot; Rising Star &quot; award for West Coast menswear companies less than 2 years old . But , according to Deborah Palmer , problems had begun to surface . At the end of 1991 , she says , &quot; Carl and T.J. just had ( litigation ) coming_out of their ears from Spike Lee , &quot; who accused Walker and Cross Colours of knocking_off his company logo . The case was settled out of court . According to a representative of Lee ' s company , Jones agreed to change the name of Cross Colours ' parent company from &quot; Solo Joint &quot; -- it was too similar to &quot; Spike ' s Joint &quot; -- and to refrain_from using certain phrases identified with Lee -- &quot; Mo ' Fun &quot; and &quot; YA-DIG SHO-ENUFF ? &quot; on the labels . In the long_run , what probably hurt Cross Colours most was that the settlement allowed only a very limited time in which to use_up the 150 # 000 labels in its inventory . It destroyed some of them , but it also &quot; massively overproduced garments just to use_up the labels , &quot; says Palmer , who by that time was Cross Colours ' vice_president of production . As a result , retailers for the first time began to return the company ' s clothes . The company won another &quot; Rising Star &quot; award in early ' 93 . This time , however , Jones and Walker didn ' t show_up for the ceremony . They later apologized , saying they had been unavoidably detained by negotiations with Earvin ( Magic ) Johnson . A week later , in an article in the California Apparel News , Jones announced that the former basketball star had purchased an interest in Cross Colours , would become a full-time member of the organization and promote all Cross Colours products , including proposed lines of Magic Johnson sportswear and shoes . Profits from the collaboration would fund AIDS education , prevention and research . The only trouble with Jones ' announcement , says Lon Rosen , Johnson ' s agent , was that a contract had never been signed . &quot; Earvin liked Carl Jones and wanted to help a black-owned company , but it just wasn ' t a direction he wanted to go_in . The numbers were not what we expected. &quot; Those numbers would have been better had it not been for bootlegging , which had long been a problem for Cross Colours . Jones estimates that as_many as half the clothes sold with a Cross Colours label were counterfeits . His worries came_to a head at the 1993 MAGIC . Long after publication of the convention register , which told buyers where sales rooms were located , Jones decided to move Cross Colours ' booth off the main floor and into two side rooms , where , he was convinced , it would be easier to keep track of industrial spies . &quot; Nobody knew where we were , &quot; recalls Sigman , the former vice_president of production . &quot; We had to switch around everyone ' s appointments. &quot; Making matters worse , the truck bringing the samples to Las Vegas broke_down , so the new clothes arrived a day and a half late . When they finally did , Cross Colours salespeople , who had never been shown the new_line , went_into shock . Cross Colours ' trademark reds , blacks , greens and yellows had been phased_out . The new_lines featured darker washes in predominantly earth tones . Everything was less baggy , less flamboyant , less . . . well , Cross Colours . &quot; The line had to become more sophisticated , &quot; Jones argues , &quot; because the customer was becoming more sophisticated. &quot; The salespeople responded that they didn ' t know how to sell the stuff . Even the music in the Cross Colours booth that year had lost its edge -- acid jazz and A Tribe Called Quest with their soft-boy rap , &quot; I Left My Wallet in El Segundo. &quot; Some say buyers left their wallets in their pockets ; Jones says that sales exceeded $ 50 million . Jones concedes that Cross Colours frequently had difficulty delivering orders on_time and in full , but by now things were getting_worse . &quot; Promises were made , but promises were never kept , &quot; says a bitter Eric Wical . Now at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch , Wical says Cross Colours delivered half of what it had promised Merry-Go-Round so frequently that he began to order twice as much as he needed . According to Wical , Cross Colours even blew its Merry-Go-Round back-to-school delivery , traditionally the biggest sales period of the year . One of the main reasons for the slow deliveries , says a garment industry veteran who went_to work_at Cross Colours_in the summer of ' 93 , was that the company owed money to many of its suppliers . &quot; We couldn ' t get fabrics in without paying_cash , &quot; she says . &quot; One sewing contractor said he was holding 20 # 000 T-shirts until we paid him , and nobody even knew who he was. &quot; Jones was still telling the media as late as spring ' 93 that Cross Colours expected total sales that year of $ 160 million . At the same time , Cross Colours began selling its returns for cash to a jobber who in turn sold the clothes to discount outlets . Cross Colours retailers began to find themselves in competition with stores selling the same clothes at half the price . In the summer of 1993 , the Merry-Go-Round chain , which , according to the New York Times , accounted_for about 60 % of Cross Colours ' revenue , was itself sliding into Chapter 11 . Cross Colours had to start laying people off . &quot; Every other Friday was Black Friday because nobody knew who was being let_go , &quot; says Deborah Palmer . &quot; Carl called a group of us into the showroom and said everything was all_right , &quot; another ex-employee says . &quot; Nobody had to worry about their job . That afternoon we were let go. &quot; When she went_in to say goodby to Jones and Walker , they were already gone . Palmer says she and Sigman called it quits the same day . Former employees complain that the more people Cross Colours laid_off , the more new cars Jones seemed to acquire . Jones ' wife got a new Jaguar convertible . Jones himself alternated between new red and black Ferraris as he laid_off four to 15 people a week . One former client says Jones told him that he ' d traded Cross Colours fabric for a Rolls-Royce . &quot; He ' s got two Testarossas and a Corniche and I ' m trying to hold_off contractors , &quot; Sigman remembers with disgust . Jones responds : &quot; Buying and selling cars has always been a hobby of mine . It had no effect financially on Threads 4 Life . Some employees confused business and personal. &quot; Jones had turned company security over to Nation of Islam guards , but as financial pressures mounted , he decided he could no longer afford them . One of the guards , who had done security for Cross Colours before the Muslim group took_over , offered to do the job for considerably less . Soon after that , several sources say the Nation of Islam guards showed_up in_force one day , closing the loading dock doors and sealing_off the exits . &quot; People were running_for their cars , &quot; remembers Colette Bailey . Another witness says the guards accused Jones of breaching their contract and demanded $ 70 # 000 in severance pay . Jones would not confirm the amount but says he did pay them in full . Cross Colours ' new financial vice_president , who just a week prior had come_in at the behest of an increasingly nervous Bank of New York , resigned soon after . By the end of the year , Cross Colours was down to fewer than 20 employees . BUILT LIKE A BOXER , A GOLD crown on a front_tooth , Karl Kani seems to swagger even as he sits , sucking on a toothpick and answering questions in his loft on a busy L.A. street south of Downtown . Action swirls around him as employees prepare a shipment for a show in Miami . Kani stayed with Cross Colours until almost the bitter_end . But now Kani has his trademark back , and his own company , Karl Kani Infinity , which claims sales of $ 68 million in 1993 . He has emerged as a competitor -- some would even say successor -- to Cross Colours . &quot; You need to be out there seeing what ' s happening -- tellin ' people what ' s happening. &quot; Kani pauses to inspect his toothpick . &quot; People from the streets say Carl Jones ain ' t down no more. &quot; And the black press seems to agree : In a feature on &quot; ghetto chic &quot; in the April issue of Quincy Jones ' hip-hop magazine , Vibe , Cross Colours is never mentioned . Jones shrugs_off the criticism . &quot; I like to think that I am a sensitive person . But does_it upset me ? No . It ' s business . I chose this business , chose my path , and there are circumstances that go_along with it . Sometimes great , sometimes bad . It ' s part of it ; especially in the apparel business , there are problems every day. &quot; Like &quot; garmentos &quot; everywhere , he is anxious to promote his new_line . Gone are the baggy pants , the screaming colors , the bold graphics . The colors are muted in earthen tones in materials like herring-bone tweed . Pullovers with a bellows pocket in the middle of the chest would seem to be Cross Colours ' new signature . &quot; The line is still urban because that ' s where it comes from , &quot; Jones says . &quot; It ' s cleaner , the colors calmer , more natural . The line looks more rugged and it ' s a little more expensive than yesterday ' s. &quot; Jones says the clothes will be available soon at Macy ' s New York , Foot Locker and at Merry-Go-Round ( newly emergent from bankruptcy ) , as well as at stores on the Howard University campus in Washington and Dr. J ' s in Harlem and Brooklyn . He insists that he and Walker &quot; are happier today . We ' re able to get_in the studio and really design . . . . It ' s not like T.J. and I got lucky . We can still make hit records . T.J. and I are still showing , producing and manufacturing -- indirectly -- the Cross Colours label. &quot; Whether or not they still own the Cross Colours trademark -- some say a creditor took possession of it -- is a subject of much speculation upon which Jones refuses to comment . It ' s impossible to know what Carl Jones is really thinking . Is he just trying to put a happy face on a grim situation , or , as_many suggest , is he so shellshocked that he doesn ' t quite understand what ' s going_on ? Maybe he ' s simply following the cardinal rule of salesmanship : Sell yourself first . Scott Sigman says Jones called him recently to hype Cross Colours ' new_line . &quot; I haven ' t been this excited , &quot; Jones enthused , &quot; in over a year. &quot; He remains proud_of what Cross Colours accomplished . &quot; If I thought they had the drive and would bust their ass for the company , we gave a lot of African Americans an opportunity. &quot; People were able to advance faster and further at Cross Colours , he maintains , than they ever would at any other company . In their new studio , Jones ' and Walker ' s desks face each other , about 15 feet apart . Jones says he likes it that way . When they were in the City of Commerce , he says , it would take 10 minutes for him to walk to T.J. ' s office . All of Cross Colours ' brilliant press from the early ' 90s is framed and leaning_against the walls . The only prominent decoration in the room is above Jones ' desk -- a yellow autographed Andy Warhol T-shirt encased in plastic . Warhol signed it for him , Jones says , and he has kept it with him in every office &quot; for good luck. &quot; It ' s impossible not to think_of Warhol ' s remark about being famous for 15 minutes . &quot; All I can say is we ' re going forward and we ' re going to do_it a lot more carefully , &quot; Jones says . But , he admits , &quot; We ' re not naive . We know today you ' re hot , and tomorrow you ' re dead. &quot;</TEXT>
