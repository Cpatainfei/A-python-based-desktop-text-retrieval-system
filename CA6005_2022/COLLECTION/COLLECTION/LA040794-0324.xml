   <HEADLINE> YELTSIN PROPOSES ' CIVIC ACCORD ' WITH RIVALS ; RUSSIA : THE PACT WOULD BAR ATTEMPTS TO FORCE EARLY ELECTIONS OR TRIM THE PRESIDENT ' S POWERS . HE UNVEILS IT AMID NEW DOUBTS ABOUT HIS HEALTH .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Seeking political peace for the two years left in his term , Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin has unveiled a proposed &quot; civic accord &quot; that would bar any attempt to trim his powers or force early elections . But Yeltsin raised new doubts about his health by canceling a meeting Wednesday at which he was to hand the document to political_party representatives . One aide said the 63-year-old president was hobbled again , apparently by a recurring spine ailment . Since he crushed an armed rebellion last October and won enhanced powers in a constitutional referendum two months later , Yeltsin ' s influence and authority appear only to have waned . Leaders of the revolt have left prison under an amnesty law that Yeltsin tried in vain to block , and they are rallying their partisans back to the streets . Meanwhile , Yeltsin has all but dropped_out of the struggle . In the past two months , he has retreated to his dacha near Moscow , then to a Black_Sea hideaway , both times fighting what aides called the flu . They often feel compelled to deny rumors he is more seriously ill or depressed . One thing Yeltsin has made clear is that he has no stomach for more of the bare-knuckled political feuds that plagued Russia in 1992 and 1993 . His top priority now , says presidential spokesman Vyacheslav V . Kostikov , is achieving &quot; a political breather , a kind of moratorium on political passions. &quot; Yeltsin ' s draft civic accord , released late Tuesday by the Itar-Tass news_agency , proposes just that . It calls_on political_parties , labor_unions and social_groups to renounce violence and accept the constitution as it is , without amendment , until after the 1996 presidential elections . All signers would refrain_from making divisive issues of the October , 1993 , rebellion and the August , 1991 , coup attempt that tried to restore hard-line Soviet rule . They would agree not to politic inside the armed forces or make &quot; uncivilized &quot; use of the mass media . The government would respect other kinds of dissent , allow Russia ' s constituent republics and regions more independence and set_up a broad-based panel including business , labor and professional representatives to guide economic_policy . Strikes aimed at securing a bigger share of the federal budget would be banned . In a recent interview with the newspaper Izvestia , Yeltsin acknowledged that the accord , not legally binding , would be hard to enforce . &quot; If we don ' t achieve this result , I will suggest other ways , but I will not give_up , &quot; he said . Reaction to the proposal was so mixed as_to cast doubt on whether Yeltsin can rally a wide consensus by April 28 , the first deadline for signing_up . Ivan Rybkin , Speaker of the Duma , or lower house of Parliament , endorsed it in_general terms , as did leaders of some moderate opposition parties . But criticism from others was fierce . &quot; The president feels that his position is weakening by the day even under the new constitution , and he is looking_for some new document outside the constitution that would help him outsmart his opponents , &quot; said Stanislav S . Govorukhin , a leader of the middle-of-the-road Democratic Party . The Communist_Party , bent_on wresting powers from Yeltsin through constitutional amendment , accused him of trying to stack the rules_in his favor . Other politicians , even some on Yeltsin ' s side , dismissed the civic accord as a goal too utopian for a society so racked by economic upheaval . &quot; It ' s like coming_up_to a patient dying of cancer and handing him a piece_of_paper saying that tomorrow he will be healthy , &quot; said Duma Deputy Speaker Alexander D . Vengerovsky . Other politicians believe that prospects for consensus brightened in January when the Yeltsin government , mindful of the success of Communists and ultranationalists in the December parliamentary elections , shed its most radical reformers . But the post-election atmosphere , in which both sides were trying to appear conciliatory , may be dissolving . A new opposition coalition took_shape last month as the Communists and their Agrarian Party allies joined forces with former Vice_President Alexander V . Rutskoi , the main leader of the October rebellion . Freed from prison , Rutskoi is preaching an unrepentant anti-Yeltsin line and hinting he will run_for president in 1996 -- or sooner if he can force early elections . Rutskoi ' s followers have taken_to the streets peacefully but in growing numbers . In an interview published Tuesday in Pravda , Rutskoi dumped on the civic accord , saying it is time &quot; to stop playing with consensus or agreements and get_down to work -- to change the authorities by legal methods. &quot; Yeltsin had planned to counter by handing the accord to political_leaders at the Kremlin on Wednesday . But he cut_short his workday Tuesday , went_to his dacha and stayed there Wednesday . Sergei L . Loiko of The Times ' Moscow Bureau contributed to this report .</TEXT>
