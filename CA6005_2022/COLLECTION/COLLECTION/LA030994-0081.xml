   <HEADLINE> SKIING ; OLYMPIAN RACERS COME TO MAMMOTH MOUNTAIN</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Last spring , World Cup officials went_in search of a mountain for two women ' s races . The resort at Vail , Colo. , the original site , had to drop the races when it accepted an invitation to stage the World Cup_finals . Looking_to help , folks at Mammoth Mountain raised their hands , not knowing at the time just how good a deal they were getting . Today through Friday , the Eastern Sierra resort will conduct its first World Cup races , the first in California in eight years . And not only are these the first women ' s World Cup races to be held after the Olympic Games , there is now considerable home-country interest , considering the successes of U.S. skiers at Lillehammer , Norway . Among the Olympic medalists who will complete in three races -- wo super-Gs and a slalom -- are American super-G gold medalist Diann Roffe-Steinrotter and Picabo Street , the downhill silver medalist . Another super-G was added_on Friday to make_up for an earlier cancellation in Europe . Today ' s super-G will be one of the last for Roffe-Steinrotter , the 26-year-old from Potsdam , N.Y. , who plans to retire at the end of the season . &quot; It ' s going_to be hard , &quot; she said of her retirement . &quot; But I ' m ready to move on. &quot; Roffe-Steinrotter pulled_off perhaps the biggest upset of the Olympics when she won the super-G on the Kvitfjell course . Until then , she had not won an international race in eight years and was ranked only 36th in the event . Street will also be competing in her first post-Olympic races , although super-G is not her strength . She did not race the event at Lillehammer , but U.S. ski team coaches believe she can develop_into a top-level performer in the discipline . &quot; I ' m looking_forward to skiing something other_than downhill , &quot; Street said Tuesday . Mostly , Street is glad to be home . &quot; It feels awesome to ski back in the States , eating our own food , speaking our own language , being around all_the people who know who we are , &quot; she said . Germany ' s Katja Seizinger , the Olympic downhill champion , will be looking_to avenge her disappointment in the super-G , in which she crashed . Seizinger is the world ' s top-ranked skier in both events . All 15 Olympic medalists are expected to compete in the Mammoth races , including Switzerland ' s Vreni Schneider , who won three medals at Lillehammer , including the gold in slalom . Schneider has won five Olympic medals , more_than any other woman skier .</TEXT>
