   <HEADLINE> VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW : A . LEVY BANK RIVALS AIM TO CAPITALIZE ON HOMETOWN TOUCH</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s less than a month since First Interstate Bancorp , the Los Angeles-based parent of First Interstate Bank , announced plans to acquire the venerable Bank of A . Levy . But two of Levy ' s small banking rivals are already battling for parts of the business that belonged_to Ventura County ' s largest independent bank . &quot; A big chain bank has swallowed another one of Ventura County ' s local institutions , &quot; laments an advertisement run in local newspapers by Ventura-based American Commercial_Bank . &quot; For those who value personal_relationships and community banking , this is a sad trend and we ' re sorry to see them go . &quot; But personal banking is still alive and well at ACB . . . Come_Home To ACB. &quot; The ad features a picture of some of American ' s top people , noting how long each has worked for the three-office bank . Jim Beeninga , American ' s president and chief_executive , says several A . Levy customers , including business people , have already switched to American in the short time since the merger was announced . &quot; They ' ve told us they ' d rather do business with us because we ' re locally owned and independent , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m sure they won ' t be disappointed . Our loan officers and managers are authorized to make loans on the spot . Sometimes they come_to a decision in as little as five minutes . And we make_a_point of knowing people ' s names. &quot; Beeninga , incidentally , says American has no intention of following A . Levy ' s lead and being acquired by one of the giants . &quot; We feel we have a role to play , making loans as small as $ 50 # 000 to local businesses . We have mixed feelings about losing a top competitor , but we ' re going to continue just as we have in the past. &quot; Another ad , from Oxnard-based Channel Islands National_Bank , is headlined &quot; Farewell , Old Friend. &quot; Noting that things won ' t be the same without Bank of A . Levy around , Channel Islands suggests : &quot; You may be one of their loyal customers who feels that banking with a locally owned and managed financial_institution is still important . . . . So give us a call and we ' ll do everything we can to make this transition easier for you . &quot; It ' s our way of saying thanks for keeping your funds working here and believing that local banking is important. &quot; The message , signed by Channel Islands Chairman Stan Cohen and Chief_Executive Chuck Elliott , offers former A . Levy customers a free order of checks , an ATM card and an endorsement stamp for business accounts . Several days after the ad started running , Elliott said he wasn ' t sure whether it had attracted new accounts . &quot; But our lending officers tell me they ' ve been successful in setting_up appointments with business people who currently deal with Bank of A . Levy , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re hopeful that quite a_few of these people will see the advantages of dealing with a local lender. &quot; Incidentally , Channel Islands announced last week that Elliott will leave next month because he had philosophical differences with the bank ' s directors . Elliott wanted the bank to concentrate_on serving businesses and professional customers , while the bank said it wants to serve businesses , but it also wants to concentrate_on individual consumers too . For its part , Bank of A . Levy ' s agreed-upon new parent isn ' t sitting on the sidelines while local independents go_after Levy ' s business . First Interstate is running an ad itself , pointing_out that between them , First Interstate and Bank of A . Levy have assets of almost $ 1 billion in Ventura County . In an open_letter signed by Bruce G . Willison , president of First Interstate , and Marshall Milligan , president of Bank of A . Levy , Interstate promises to build &quot; on the legacy of Achille Levy and his family to become the kind of ' big community bank ' we believe he would have envisioned for the Ventura County of the 21st Century. &quot;</TEXT>
