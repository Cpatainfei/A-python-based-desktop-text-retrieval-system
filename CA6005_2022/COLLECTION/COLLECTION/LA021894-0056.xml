   <HEADLINE> TARZANA JOLT ; SHAKING UNDER NURSERY IS AMONG STRONGEST EVER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For seven or eight seconds after the Northridge earthquake , the ground beneath the Cedar Hill Nursery in Tarzana shook as violently as almost any location anywhere in recorded seismic history . It shook hard enough to send buildings airborne and hard enough to launch seismologists from around the world on a quest to explain what they consider to be one of the most puzzling aspects of the devastating temblor . Earthquakes are generally measured on the familiar scale of magnitude , but the tale of how the ground actually shook -- in what direction , how fast and how powerfully -- is told by hundreds of devices called strong-motion accelerographs deployed in buildings and in the open throughout the region . One accelerograph , on a hilltop ranch once owned by author and Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs , recorded an up-down jolt of 1.82g or nearly twice the strength of gravity . Adding_to the data ' s significance is the fact that the instrument was bolted into shallow rock , meaning that the reading was not amplified as it would have been if it had been located inside a building . The instrument also measured several spikes as high as 1.5g in all directions during a period of nearly eight seconds during the 4:31 a.m. Jan . 17 earthquake . Not only were they the highest ground-motion readings from the earthquake , they were also among a handful of the highest ever recorded . Moreover , seismologists say that sustained shaking of that magnitude is unprecedented . Even so , houses in the area sustained only minor damage -- cracks in walls and driveways and some broken windows . By studying why the readings were so high , seismologists hope to better understand earthquakes as well as the forces they exert on structures of all types . &quot; It ' s peculiar , and now they want to find_out why it is peculiar , &quot; said Ralph Herman , whose family has lived_on the ranch and nursery since 1943 . The readings have attracted experts to Herman ' s nursery from Japan , New Zealand , England and Africa . Seismologists , engineers and technicians from the U.S. Geological Survey and the state ' s Strong Motion Instrumentation Program have been there daily since they saw the abnormally high initial readings and have installed dozens of other accelerographs . They have also tested the instrument that took the first_reading . They used the additional instruments to measure ground motion from aftershocks as well as from artificially induced shear waves -- the waves of earthquake energy that cause the most damage . That work ended last weekend . So far , they have ruled_out an instrument malfunction and are confident that the accelerograph was properly anchored so that it measured actual ground movement rather than an effect caused by loose soil . Rufus Catchings , a Geological Survey seismologist who is overseeing some of the testing , said a &quot; very , very preliminary &quot; analysis of the new data indicates that the high ground-motion readings were quite localized . &quot; It doesn ' t appear to extend very far from that site , so most of Tarzana itself seems fine , &quot; he said . Further explanation will await the creation of a three-dimensional computer model of the local and regional geology and possibly years of analysis , said Tony Shakal , a seismologist who heads the state ' s strong-motion program . &quot; There ' s plenty of room for speculation and I ' m sure there is a great_deal of it going_on , &quot; Shakal said . The key question is why the ground under the ranch moved as much as it did and whether something there attracts or enhances an earthquake ' s energy . Shakal ' s hunch is that the answer will be found in some quirk of local geology . He said the ranch is in an area in which the alluvial_soils of the San Fernando Valley give_way to the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains . A layer of siltstone is 19 to 33 feet beneath the ranch . So far , he said , &quot; we don ' t know how much the unusual record . . . was_due to the site and how much was_due to the ( strength or fault movement of the ) earthquake. &quot; This is not the first time the Tarzana site has been the focus of scientific curiosity . In the magnitude 5.9 Whittier Narrows quake in 1987 , the accelerograph at the nursery recorded ground motion of 0.65g , which was stronger than what was picked_up by instruments near the quake ' s epicenter . Scientists also studied the site after that quake and determined that it was stable and that the readings were accurate . Nothing unusual was seen there in other earthquakes , such_as the magnitude 7.6 Landers and magnitude 6.7 Big Bear quakes in 1992 or the magnitude 5.8 Sierra Madre quake in 1991 . Seismologists began measuring actual ground movement in 1930 . During the Long_Beach earthquake three years later , motion equal_to one-third the force of gravity was recorded . The maximum ground-motion readings increased gradually with subsequent earthquakes , topping 1g for the first time at the Pacoima Dam during the 1971 Sylmar quake . Each time a record was set , Shakal said , seismologists were surprised and skeptical . He said the Tarzana reading &quot; was a higher value than we had expected but recording the forces of ground movement . . . during actual earthquake shaking . . . is a new idea &quot; in scientific terms . The greatest value of ground-movement readings is for earthquake engineering . If engineers can predict ground movement , they can design buildings to resist it . Civil engineers say the high readings from several locations in the Northridge earthquake , including those in Tarzana , may cause them to reconsider how buildings , dams , freeway overpasses and other structures are designed . Ground Force Earthquakes are most commonly thought of in terms of magnitude , a general measure of a temblor ' s size . How the ground actually shook-in what direction , how powerfully and for how long-is measured by sensitive but relatively simple devices called strong-motion accelerographs . The readings show the relationship to the force of gavity . 1 G = a force equal_to that of gravity .
