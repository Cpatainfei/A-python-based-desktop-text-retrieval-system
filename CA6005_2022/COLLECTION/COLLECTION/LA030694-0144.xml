   <HEADLINE> 28 HARDY SOULS VOLUNTEER TO SPEND WINTER AT THE BOTTOM OF THE WORLD ; SOUTH_POLE : THE CREW OF SCIENTISTS , METEOROLOGISTS AND OTHERS CANNOT LEAVE ANTARCTICA FOR THE NEXT EIGHT MONTHS . THEY WILL LIVE IN AN UNHEATED GEODESIC_DOME ; OUTSIDE , TEMPERATURES CAN REACH 100 BELOW ZERO .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Their home for the next eight months will be an unheated aluminum geodesic_dome 53 feet high and 160 feet wide . Most of that time , it will be winter at the bottom of the world . They will be enveloped in darkness relieved only by the eerie shimmering of the southern lights , aurora_australis . When they step outside the cramped but well-insulated living quarters , they may be greeted by temperatures 100 degrees below zero , made far colder beyond the dome by 30-knot winds . They will have no possibility of escape_from this human cocoon before late October . It ' s called wintering over . The last transport plane takes_off from the U.S. South_Pole Station ' s ice runway in late February , the end of the National Science Foundation ' s austral summer research season . Those left_behind at this remotest of all outposts are 28 carefully screened volunteers : scientists , construction workers , meteorologists and other support staff . Five are women . All have gone_through psychological testing , interactive group training and a firefighting course . Some people thrive on the adventure . Four of the 28 have done_it before . They may live harmoniously or fractiously : Groups differ from year to year . Either way , it ' s an experience they ' ll never forget . &quot; This is the best natural laboratory to study people in an extreme environment like you have in outer space , &quot; said social_scientist Jeffrey C . Johnson . &quot; A moon base will be a lot like this place. &quot; Johnson , based at East Carolina University in Greenville , N.C. , has a grant to study the social_structure of groups that winter over at the pole . &quot; What it really boils_down to , &quot; he said , &quot; is that as long as you do your work , engage socially and have a sense_of_humor , people like you. &quot; Those most likely to have problems , said Johnson , are inflexible , opinionated know-it-alls . &quot; Everybody goes_through a stage or two of pretty good depression , &quot; said Stanley P . Wisneski , who has wintered over twice , most recently as station manager in 1992-93 for Antarctic Support Associates , the company that contracts with the National Science Foundation to operate U.S. research facilities in Antarctica . &quot; Definitely , it ' s not made_for everyone , &quot; said meteorologist Ann Adams of Phoenix . She and another meteorologist will spend more time outdoors than most of the others , reading instruments and launching weather balloons . One who enjoys winter life at the South_Pole is James Stine of Beldenville , Wis . A veteran of three summers and two winters in Antarctica , Stine is an affable giant with a beard and a Mohawk haircut who manages the power_plant . &quot; If I could do one or the other , I think I ' d take winter , &quot; he said . &quot; We ' re more of a close-knit family . I like the lifestyle. &quot; Romances sometimes bloom in the austral dark . One former manager recalls three weddings that have resulted from winter pairings . For everybody , the lifestyle requires some accommodation . At its best , the South_Pole is a daunting place . It ' s a pinprick on a frozen continent the size of the United States and Mexico combined . The average mean temperature at the pole is minus 56 . In every direction , the polar landscape is a flat , white sheet . The elevation is 9 # 300 feet , but when low barometric_pressure is factored in , it feels more like 10 # 500 feet . Many newcomers suffer from altitude_sickness . Most scientific work_at the pole is done during the short austral summer season , November through January , when the sun is constantly overhead . The emphasis is_on astrophysics . Peak population is 125 , many of whom live_in a &quot; summer_camp &quot; of insulated half-circle canvas buildings outside the dome . The winter-over crew , however , squeezes into buildings inside the dome . People work together , eat together and play together . Water , made from thawed ice , is always in short supply : Showers are limited to two a week . The kitchen at South_Pole Station has a reputation for excellent cuisine . Summer and winter , all hands are expected to volunteer for serving and cleanup duties . After long work_days , the small polar community relaxes with cards , video movies , a well-stocked library , a weight room and gym , a pool_table and &quot; volley bag , &quot; a space-conserving volleyball variant using a rolled-up cloth ball in place of an inflated one . Alcohol is rationed . Drinking has been a problem with some winter-over groups . &quot; It ' s very easy for one drink to turn_into 10 , &quot; said Wisneski . &quot; The isolation is the worst thing of all , &quot; he said . &quot; If you dwell_on when you ' re leaving , you ' re going to lose your mind . The busier you keep yourself , the more enjoyable your time will be. &quot; One antidote is communication with stateside friends and family . Besides shortwave radio , there are satellite-connected telephones and computerized electronic_mail . But the best time of all is the equivalent of Christmas in July , at the depth of the dark winter , when an Air_Force C-141 Starlifter transport drops food , supplies -- and mail . The station ' s well-lit greenhouse is a popular place for people depressed by the endless darkness . Janet Phillips , the 1993-94 winter manager , has installed full-spectrum fluorescent lights , a proven remedy for seasonal blues . Because there ' s no way_out for the winter crew , regardless of the severity of a problem , a physician is always among them . &quot; This is not a fun place to be_sick , &quot; said the current one , Dr. Robert B . Lutes of Brentwood , N.H. Cold-weather complaints such_as hypothermia and frostbite are rare , Lutes said , for two reasons : excellent equipment and the good_sense to come_in out of the cold whenever possible . In the pole ' s high , frigid , super-dry atmosphere , the most common afflictions are upper-respiratory infections . Lutes dispenses plenty of antibiotics . One way or another , polar life leaves its mark on everyone who winters over . &quot; When you get_out you have to readjust to the world , &quot; said Wisneski . &quot; All of a sudden you have to worry about crossing a street , paying_for a meal , buying groceries , paying_for a bed . It ' s a big change. &quot;</TEXT>
