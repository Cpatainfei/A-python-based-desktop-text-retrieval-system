   <HEADLINE> NASA HAILS 2ND PERFECT SHUTTLE LAUNCH OF YEAR</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The shuttle Columbia soared through a clear sky and slipped into orbit Friday with five astronauts who will oversee projects similar to ones planned later this decade for a space_station . &quot; See you in half a month , &quot; shuttle commander John Casper told mission control . The four men and one woman , all space veterans , began engineering and materials experiments and prepared the shuttle robot arm for upcoming magnetic tests during the 14-day mission . NASA savored the right-on-the-mark launch , the second one this year . Mission managers delayed the flight for one day because of dangerously high winds Thursday , but the weather was ideal when the sun rose Friday . It was especially gratifying coming_after last year ' s dismal launch record . The National Aeronautics and Space Administration struggled through 10 launch scrubs in 1993 , including two engine shutdowns at the pad . NASA ' s oldest shuttle is making its 16th flight . Columbia already holds the record for the longest shuttle excursion -- an hour longer than this scheduled 13-day , 23-hour voyage -- but crew_members are hoping to surpass that with a landing delay . One extra orbit on March 18 would do_it . Columbia holds more engineering and technology experiments than have ever flown_on a shuttle , a NASA official said . The 11 primary experiments range from semiconductor production to metal melting to electric arcing -- the kind of work planned for an international space_station to be built beginning in 1997 . Nearly all_of the major experiments will be operated from the ground . The astronauts will occupy themselves with medical tests , a new magnetic grappling system for the shuttle robot arm and small , snap-together structures that will be shaken to see how the pieces hold_up under stress . The astronauts will lower Columbia ' s orbit from the present 184 miles to 120 miles by flight ' s end so scientists can see how their experiments fare at different altitudes .</TEXT>
