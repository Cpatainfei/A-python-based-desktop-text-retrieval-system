   <HEADLINE> JAPAN COALITION PULLS_BACK FROM BRINK OF COLLAPSE ; POLITICS : CONSERVATIVE LEADERS BOYCOTT TALKS TO PICK A SUCCESSOR TO HOSOKAWA . BUT THEY AGREE TO TRY AGAIN .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Japan ' s ruling coalition inched back from the brink of collapse today as both of its warring camps indicated they will try again to select a candidate for prime_minister from within their ranks . But hostilities remained high between the forces led by Japan Renewal Party official Ichiro Ozawa and those of New Party Harbinger leader Masayoshi Takemura . In the clearest sign yet of a break between the two camps , conservative coalition leaders had boycotted a meeting Monday and another today with their more liberal partners on selecting a successor to Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa . Hosokawa stunned Japan ' s political world last week by abruptly announcing his resignation amid mounting questions over questionable stock deals , loans and his personal finances . The lines between the two camps were sharply drawn when Takemura called a meeting of party heads to discuss Hosokawa ' s successor and three of the coalition members -- the Renewal Party , the Buddhist-backed Clean Government Party and Hosokawa ' s Japan New Party -- refused to attend . The three groups said the appropriate forum to discuss the issue is a meeting not of party heads but of secretaries_general , which would include Ozawa . They said they suspected that Takemura called the meeting of party heads deliberately to exclude his rival Ozawa . Some of the Japanese media pronounced the boycott the de_facto end of the coalition , an eclectic group spanning the political spectrum . Last July , its members cobbled_together a ruling majority to end 38 years of iron rule by the Liberal Democratic Party . Although the liberal side had warned that the coalition would shatter if the conservatives boycotted the meeting again today , Takemura , in a change of tactics , called_on the two sides to make a fresh_start . Yuichi Ichikawa , leader of the Clean Government Party , immediately accepted the olive_branch and vowed to try to repair the split . As chaos mounted and the power vacuum deepened , operatives in each party maneuvered to try to fashion a majority , meeting secretly with former political enemies and reaching across party_lines . A majority of the lower house of Parliament is necessary to elect a prime_minister in the case of two candidates ; a runoff is held between the top two vote-getters in the case of more_than two . Although many observers had initially focused_on Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata as Hosokawa ' s successor , former Foreign Minister Michio Watanabe assumed center stage Monday . He gave his strongest indication yet that he and his followers are ready to bolt the Liberal Democratic Party and join the Ozawa side in exchange for the prime_minister ' s post . Asked Monday about his will to do so , Watanabe declared , &quot; I have the will , the spirit and the physical strength. &quot; Watanabe began collecting signatures from party members to support his candidacy . But it looked increasingly unlikely today that Watanabe , a blunt and witty politician whose political gaffes are legendary ( he once said black Americans blithely declare bankruptcy to skip out on debts ) , could persuade enough followers to leave the party . As a result , some members of the Clean Government Party and the Renewal Party were reported having second_thoughts about splitting the coalition . In another development , LDP President Yohei Kono -- a relatively young and fresh-faced politician elevated for his reformist image -- announced today that he will run_for prime_minister . Should Watanabe decide not to bolt the LDP , another scenario being discussed is an alliance of longtime political opponents -- the Socialists and the LDP , along with the New Party Harbinger . Although such a scenario may seem improbable on its face , there are few real policy differences between conservative Socialists and liberal LDP members , said political commentator Yoshimi Ishikawa . He noted that in recent months , the Socialists have changed policies on opening Japan ' s rice market , accepted the necessity of nuclear_power and recognized South_Korea rather than only its Communist neighbor to the north . But the single largest factor driving the different alliances , he said , is Ichiro Ozawa . &quot; Eight months ago , it was LDP versus anti-LDP , &quot; he said . &quot; From today , it is Ozawa versus anti-Ozawa. &quot; Indeed , Takemura ' s New Party Harbinger issued a new policy platform Monday that further sharpens its differences with Ozawa and calls_for reshaping the political landscape from scratch . In the most conspicuous slap at Ozawa ' s ideas , the platform calls_for respecting Japan ' s war-renouncing constitution and rejecting a role for Japan as a major political or military power . It urges a more democratic , open policy-making process -- an indirect criticism of Ozawa ' s penchant for wielding power behind the scenes . But New Party Harbinger official Yukio Hatoyama said the platform is not necessarily an anti-Ozawa treatise .</TEXT>
