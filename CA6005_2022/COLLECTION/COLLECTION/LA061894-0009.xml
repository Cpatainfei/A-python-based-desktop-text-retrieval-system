The $ 67.9-billion bill , which includes funding for the Food and Drug Administration , passed_on a 278-127 vote.The Senate has yet to complete its version . The department is spending $ 3.7 million on tobacco research this year . The proposed spending cutback would cover the 1995 budget year , which starts Oct . 1 . The only exception to the research ban would be for studies of pure scientific interest to botanists and genetic researchers . More is known about tobacco genetics than any other plant . Because of that it can be used to develop genetically engineered drugs . Other anti-smoking measures in the bill include a continued ban on using government money to promote tobacco sales abroad , and a ban on smoking in clinics where poor parents and infants receive food from the government .</TEXT>
