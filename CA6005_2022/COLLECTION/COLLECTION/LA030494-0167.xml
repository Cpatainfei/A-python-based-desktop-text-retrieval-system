   <HEADLINE> RABIN TALKS TO RIGHT_WING TO STRENGTHEN COALITION ; MIDEAST : ISRAELI LEADER SAYS MASSACRE WEAKENED GOVERNMENT . BUT TSOMET PARTY OPPOSES PLO AGREEMENT ON SELF-RULE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Thursday that he is negotiating with the right-wing Tsomet Party in an effort to broaden his coalition government , even though the party opposes the agreement he signed with the Palestine Liberation Organization on Palestinian self-government . &quot; I see it as an urgent necessity to broaden the coalition basis of the government , and I intend to take action to reach that goal , &quot; Rabin declared , asserting the massacre of 48 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque last week left his minority government even weaker than before . Although Tsomet ' s incorporation in the Cabinet would bring the government five more seats in Parliament , giving it a one-vote majority , the party ' s staunch opposition to the autonomy agreement and to withdrawal from any occupied territory would throw into question Rabin ' s ability , even his willingness , to proceed with peace negotiations . The left-wing Meretz Party , a member of the governing coalition with Rabin ' s Labor_Party , voiced its strong objections to Tsomet and threatened to pull_out if Rabin brought it into the Cabinet . Founded in 1987 , Tsomet is committed to holding all_of the biblical Land of Israel , to increasing Israeli settlements on the occupied West_Bank and to a tougher line on security issues . &quot; In the severe circumstances that developed following the massacre in Hebron , Tsomet ' s joining ( the government ) will be seen as a negative message to our Palestinian partners in negotiations , to Israeli Arabs . . . and to the peace process in_general and its chances for advancing , &quot; Meretz warned . But Rabin said the coalition needed a &quot; strong base &quot; and it was &quot; unthinkable &quot; for crucial decisions on peace to be made by a minority government . Rabin now has 56 of 120 members of the Knesset , Israel ' s Parliament , in his coalition ; 44 come from Labor , 12 from Meretz . Five legislators from Arab and Communist_parties outside the government also back him . &quot; The Hebron massacre makes reliance on as wide as possible a coalition in Parliament all_the more important , &quot; Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said . &quot; We are talking_about Tsomet joining , in_effect without changing the ( government ' s ) guidelines . We will definitely regard this as an important and welcome addition. &quot; Ahmed Tibi , a senior adviser to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat , nonetheless warned that Tsomet ' s inclusion in the Cabinet would &quot; cast a shadow over the future of the peace process &quot; and would run counter to the basic agreement between Israel and the PLO . Tsomet leader Rafael Eitan is best-known as the army chief_of_staff who led Israel ' s 1982 invasion of Lebanon , a campaign now regarded_as a disastrous military adventure . He has opposed any withdrawal from territory -- whether the West_Bank , Golan Heights or Gaza Strip -- that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle_East War . Before retiring from the army in 1983 , Eitan boasted to a parliamentary committee : &quot; When we have settled the land , all_the Arabs will be able to do about it will be to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle. &quot; According to Israeli press reports of the negotiations with Rabin , Eitan would become police minister in_charge of Israel ' s internal security . He would accept the accord on Palestinian self-government with the explanation that he could better serve Israel now by joining the Cabinet to ensure minimal damage was done_in its implementation . But Rabin ' s discussions with Eitan may be a feint to force Meretz to make compromises necessary to lure Shas , an ultra-Orthodox religious party , back into the government where it has opposed liberal human_rights legislation that is a Meretz priority . &quot; We in Meretz are committed to this government , and this government has done many great things for peace , &quot; Environment Minister Yossi Sarid said . &quot; It still has great challenges ahead . &quot; We must be able to distinguish between what ' s important and what ' s less important , &quot; Sarid continued , suggesting that Meretz was prepared_for compromises on key issues , such_as women ' s rights , where it quarreled with Shas . Arye Deri , the Shas leader who resigned from the Cabinet when indicted for corruption , confidently predicted Thursday evening that not only his party would return to the government within a week but that a small , three-member parliamentary group that recently split from Tsomet would also join , leaving Tsomet in the opposition . On Thursday , Israel released 400 more Palestinian prisoners in a goodwill gesture intended to halt the violent protests that followed the Hebron mosque massacre and to persuade the PLO to return to the negotiations on implementing the autonomy agreement . But B ' Tselem , a leading Israel human_rights group , accused the army of arresting nearly as_many Palestinians as it freed in suppressing anti-Israeli demonstrations on the West_Bank and Gaza Strip . About 40 people were injured Thursday in clashes with troops . Israeli authorities also continued their crackdown on extremist Jewish settlers , issuing orders for the detention of five more of their leaders and banning 18 others from entering Palestinian areas . Settler leaders declared that they will not turn_in their army-issued weapons if ordered and will resist other measures against them .</TEXT>
