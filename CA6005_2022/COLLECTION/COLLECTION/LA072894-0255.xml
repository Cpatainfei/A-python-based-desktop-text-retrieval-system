   <HEADLINE> STUDY FINDS PERIL IN WATER_SUPPLY ; SAFETY : ABOUT 14 % OF U.S. POPULATION DRINKS FROM SYSTEMS THAT HAVE VIOLATED FEDERAL CONTAMINATION STANDARDS IN LAST THREE YEARS , RESEARCHERS SAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The drinking_water of more_than 36 million Americans , about 14 % of the nation ' s population , comes from water_systems that have reported unsafe levels of contamination during the past three years , according to a study released Wednesday by an environmental group , the Natural_Resources Defense Council . Based on data collected by the federal Environmental Protection Agency in 1992 and 1993 , the study lists California with the most people -- 2.8 million -- who are dependent_on drinking_water systems that registered contamination levels in excess of federal safe drinking_water standards . The report ' s authors arrived_at the 36 million figure by adding_up the number of people served by water_systems found to be in violation of EPA contamination limits . The study also says that about 50 million people , including 16 million Californians , depend_on drinking_water systems that failed to comply with all federal water quality regulations in_effect in 1992 and 1993 . Noncompliance increases the chance of contamination . The regulations require systems to protect watersheds from microbiological contamination and to make systems less corrosive in_order to prevent lead from leaching into tap_water . &quot; Most drinking_water systems comply with federal requirements , but today ' s report shows that there is still cause for concern , &quot; said EPA Administrator Carol M . Browner . &quot; Too many systems fail to meet basic public health standards. &quot; The study does not say how many people got sick as a result of drinking contaminated water . The author of the study , NRDC attorney Erik Olson , cited a report by the Centers_for_Disease_Control estimating that 900 # 000 people a year are made sick by inadequately treated drinking_water . According to Olson ' s report , the most common types of contamination showing_up in poorly treated water include microorganisms such_as cryptosporidium , which was responsible_for the outbreak of intestinal illness that affected 400 # 000 Milwaukee residents last year . Other contaminants cited by Olson range from pesticides and industrial solvents to toxic byproducts of the chlorine used to purify most drinking_water systems . Olson said that the widespread evidence of contamination reflects &quot; a gross under-investment in treatment facilities in most big cities. &quot; According to the NRDC ' s report , &quot; 90 % of the nation ' s large water utilities are using pre-World War I water treatment technology. &quot; These facilities , he said , fail to catch a variety of chemical contaminants as well as microorganisms . The antiquated facilities , Olson said , rely_on sand filtration supplemented by chlorine purification . High levels of chlorine byproducts , called trihalomethanes , have been detected in people with rectal and bladder cancer , he noted . The NRDC released its study in the midst of a congressional battle over proposed changes to the Safe Drinking Water Act . The NRDC and most other environmental groups argue that a coalition of municipal water agencies , which includes the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California , is trying to soft-pedal the contamination problem while it works to weaken the Safe Drinking Water Act . &quot; Some of the same people who have kept_from the public full knowledge of the extent of contamination are now mounting efforts to weaken the law that protects the public ' s health , &quot; Olson states in the introduction of the NRDC study . Proponents of the legislation argue that they are proposing the most cost-effective ways for municipal water_systems to make the most-needed improvements , and they accuse the NRDC , in its report , of making EPA data look worse than it is . &quot; This is a tactic to whip_up public support by one side of a legislative contest , &quot; said Bruce Kuebler , director of water quality for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power . Kuebler said that his department is &quot; technically &quot; in violation of the act because it is late in complying with a 1993 regulation requiring additional treatment of water stored in exposed reservoirs . &quot; Complying is going_to take us 10 years and cost several hundred million dollars , &quot; Kuebler said . &quot; So , sure , you can say that ' s a violation . But it doesn ' t mean people are drinking contaminated water. &quot; Charles Fox , director of policy development at the EPA ' s Office of Water , said that Kuebler has a point . &quot; A violation doesn ' t necessarily translate into a threat to the public ' s health , &quot; Fox said . But he also said that , in_general , the NRDC is not making too_much out of the violations compiled by EPA . &quot; It is fair to say that the violations are indicative , in many cases , of a certain public health standard not being met , &quot; he said . &quot; With a reported violation , a system is often saying , ' We don ' t have in place the facilities that can consistently provide the public the protection required under the law.
