   <HEADLINE> MOVIE REVIEW ; POST-WAR EAST_GERMAN MYTHS REVEALED IN ' PROPAGANDA '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The educational and instructional documentary footage in &quot; Strictly Propaganda &quot; ( playing weekends at the Laemmle Monica Theaters ) is chillingly funny . Wolfgang Kissel , who currently teaches at the Dresden Visual Arts_School , assembled a cross-section of representative documentaries from the archives of DEFA -- the official state film studio of the now defunct German Democratic Republic -- ranging from the immediate postwar years to the last_days of Erich Honecker in 1989 . Kissel makes no attempt to &quot; editorialize. &quot; He doesn ' t need to . The fascination of the footage is that , although it presents a sunny , upbeat view of post-war East_Germany , the real story can ' t help breaking_through the enforced joyousness . ( It ' s as if you were watching two different movies : the one that was made and the one that wasn ' t. ) The results are beyond satire . You can laugh_at a scene like the one where a citizen is encouraged to take his vacation on a steamer cruise up the Volga , or the sequence where an honored party functionary praises Stalin as the prince of peace , but the laughter catches in your craw . Documentaries are often mistakenly assumed to give us the &quot; truth &quot; but it takes a film like &quot; Strictly Propaganda &quot; to really undercut that bogus idea . It ' s difficult to imagine anyone in East_Germany falling_for much of what we see in this film , and yet , in their own crudely effective way , the DEFA filmmakers knew what they were doing . The repeated shots of blonde children romping and saluting are iconic in a way that is not so very different from the Aryan super-race imagery in Leni Riefenstahl ' s &quot; Triumph of the Will. &quot; Only the uniforms , and the salute , are different . As the years tick by in &quot; Strictly Propaganda , &quot; slight rents in the social fabric emerge . The ' 60s introduced a more &quot; questioning &quot; student into the classroom , and so we ' re treated to an instructional documentary for teachers who attempt to defend the party_line without alienating the class . There ' s also an instructional film for Berlin Wall border guards , including a re-enactment where a West German spy attempting to enter the country is tripped_up by failing to recite the opening words of the Communist Manifesto . It ' s an epic stretch from 1946 and the Soviet Occupation Zone to 1989 and the ascendancy of Gorbachev . What ' s eerie about &quot; Strictly Propaganda &quot; is that it never acknowledges the stretch . There ' s a weightlessness to the footage because it has so little connection to what was going_on not only in East_Germany , but in the rest of the world . The national portrait that emerges is &quot; The Land That Time Forgot. &quot; Or more accurately , &quot; The Land That Tried to Forget. &quot; ' Strictly Propaganda ' A First Run Features release . Director Wolfgang Kissel . Executive producer C . Cay Wesnigk . Screenplay by Kissel . Editor Peter Vatter . Running time : 94 minutes . MPAA rating : Unrated . Times guidelines : shots of post-war destruction and pro-communist propaganda .</TEXT>
