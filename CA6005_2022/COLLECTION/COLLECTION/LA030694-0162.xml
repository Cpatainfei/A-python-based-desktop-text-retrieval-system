   <HEADLINE> HUGH GRANT IS VEDDY VEDDY BUSY ; THE 33-YEAR-OLD ACTOR MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE NEXT GREAT BRITISH ROMANTIC LEADING MAN -- REMEMBER CARY ? -- BUT HE ' S WORKING_ON IT WITH THREE NEW FILMS , INCLUDING ' FOUR WEDDINGS AND A FUNERAL '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A British leading man who has the fair features to turn young_girls ' and aging matrons ' knees wobbly ; the graceful , spot-on diction that suggests breeding commensurate with beauty ; the urbane quick-wittedness that cements the intellectual desirability . . . . . . but who also , all-importantly , counterbalances all that perfection with a nervous self-deprecation , or befuddlement even , that makes him a dashing yet daffy Everyman , unthreateningly endearing to even the least secure heterosexual male . Sounds like a Grant , all_right . Mention to Hugh Grant , though , that some have suggested he might be the rightful successor to Cary as the first real romantic-comedic leading man from England to hit big here in decades and he does precisely what you ' d want an ingenuously modest Brit to do : demur . &quot; Does a romantic leading_man still exist , though , in the cinema today ? Discuss in not more_than 500 words , &quot; he says , doubtfully reposing the question . &quot; If we were still in the ' 50s or ' 60s . . . &quot; If we were still in the ' 50s or ' 60s , Grant ' s star might already have risen . The odds aren ' t terribly lopsided in the ' 90s , at that . The sleeper comedy that ' s causing all_the commotion , director Mike Newell ' s &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral , &quot; opens Wednesday , and offers Grant , 33 , his first true leading role in a film that has any likelihood of breaking_out beyond the art-house circuit . The sweet , sharp farce has him striking up romance with Andie MacDowell in a circuitous route that takes the tentative couple through a &quot; meet-cute &quot; times five , encompassing all_the title ceremonies . He also shares star billing in two other pictures opening in Los Angeles in the next two weeks , albeit in far less sexy , more reactionary parts . He plays the prototypical repressed Brit in two international productions -- John Duigan ' s &quot; Sirens , &quot; also opening Wednesday , and Roman Polanski ' s controversial &quot; Bitter Moon , &quot; which opened in Europe a year and a half ago but finally hits here March 18 . These round_out the inadvertent homage au Hugh Grant , as he puts it , and make him very probably the only actor going_with four feature_films out at once -- considering that he ' s still on screens with his small part in &quot; The Remains of the Day , &quot; as the grown godson whom Anthony Hopkins strives to teach about the birds , the bees and fishing . Off-screen as well as on , those charmed by Grant most often mention his likably self-effacing quality . &quot; I ' m gonna get_rid_of that , &quot; he announces , suddenly , when the subject comes_up . &quot; I ' m going_to efface my self-effacing quality , I ' ve decided . It ' s not a good idea in Hollywood . Too often I ' ve said , ' Oh no , no , please , it ' s a terrible film , I ' m awful in it , ' and people have taken me at my word , which is not what they ' re supposed to do at all . They ' re supposed to shout me down and say , ' On the contrary , it ' s excellent , and you ' re wonderful ! &quot; ' Grant ' s longtime girlfriend , British actress Elizabeth Hurley , who currently lives in L.A. , &quot; is furious with me when I do that , furious , &quot; he says . &quot; But I can ' t believe how people don ' t do_it here . I ' ve had lunches with people I ' ve never met before where they ' ll say just in passing , ' Yeah , I made a film two years ago which got 14 awards and was called the most exciting film since &quot; Jurassic Park , &quot; ' he says , marveling at the gaucheness of it all . &quot; Just in passing they ' ll blow their own trumpet like that , and maybe that ' s what you have to do , I don ' t know. &quot; * Well , it is amazing how many . . . &quot; I just want you to know I won the best actor prize in the Venice Film Festival in 1986 , &quot; he interrupts . ( It was for his debut lead in Merchant-Ivory ' s &quot; Maurice. &quot; ) &quot; Anyway , do go on. &quot; . . . is amazing , as we were saying , how many unsolicited verbal resumes one collects in Hollywood . &quot; And I think that ' s what gives me the creeps a bit here , actually , because I see too_much of myself in the people around me , the self-obsession , &quot; Grant says . &quot; Conversations you have here , it is literally just ' my turn_to talk_about myself , your turn_to talk_about yourself , my turn ' -- and there ' s no contact , no one has any interest in anyone else at all unless they can . . . . &quot; He suddenly hushes . &quot; This is terrible . This is the L.A. Times ! What am I doing ? What am I doing ? I love Hollywood . I ' ve liked everyone I ' ve met , &quot; he says , the rather unconvincing last bit muffled by his burying his face in his hands . He really isn ' t the first_person to have noticed it , we point_out , trying to be reassuring . &quot; No , I know , but it sounds terrible coming from a foreigner . I would hate any foreigner who had the audacity to criticize one single thing about London. &quot; And -- as someone who prefers to carry_on a bi-continental love_affair rather than do something so unnatural as resist the &quot; strange impulse to base myself where I ' m to be indigenous &quot; -- he means it . Grant complains with a resigned bemusement that one question he seems to get from a lot of American journalists is : &quot; You ' re very British , aren ' t you ? &quot; Stupid or apocryphal as the question might be , you can kind of see where it ' s coming from . * At the ' 94 Sundance Film Festival in Utah , Hugh Grant , the toast of the festival , is learning to schmooze in a big-time way . Here , &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral &quot; was the opening-night premiere and &quot; Sirens &quot; also had its stateside debut ; the buzz on Grant is prompting a lot of glad-handing on the snowy streets , with many_a glove or mitten extended in instant friendship . There ' s a beautiful Hollywood-in-Park-City scene happening as Grant puts_on his winter parka and bids adieu to Elle MacPherson , who is dressed unseasonably in a remarkable skintight bodysuit . &quot; Missing you already , &quot; Grant coos to MacPherson , blowing a kiss as he exits , eliciting a good super-model laugh . This affectation is an inside joke between the &quot; Sirens &quot; co-stars , adopted from one of Grant ' s earlier festival encounters . Indulging in such mockery seems to be his way of shielding himself from the pressure of being buttered_up as a golden_boy . &quot; Certainly I have been schmoozed , and although I ' m cynical about it now , there ' s a huge side of one which is drinking it in thinking , ' Yes , how right you are , I am a huge star. ' And I don ' t want to be disappointed , &quot; he admits , sitting_down inside a nearby ski-town coffeehouse . &quot; I know that people do talk you up a hell of a lot in Hollywood -- I ' ve had it to a smaller extent before -- and you don ' t want to come crashing down . And although I can ' t pretend I ' m not excited when they say it , I realize that I ought to take it with a really big pinch of salt . &quot; I met a person the other day from Hollywood -- I ' d known them for literally one minute -- and when I said goodby , they said , ' Missing you already. ' And , uh , that couldn ' t be true. &quot; To be fair , folks can ' t be blamed for feeling endeared to Grant after seeing &quot; Four Weddings and a Funeral , &quot; though he insists he ' s not nearly so nice as the character on screen . Variety , for instance , has come_out with the film ' s first review during Sundance , a rave that says , &quot; Grant ' s got just the combination of good looks , rueful self-disparagement , quickness and bespectacled nerdiness to carry_off refined , sophisticated screen comedy. &quot; Grant saw the film for the first time himself at the festival premiere , and says he breathed a huge sigh of relief . &quot; I don ' t think in many ways it was a perfect first time to see it , because although Salt_Lake_City ' s a lovely place , that particular audience was quite full of middle-aged religious people , and the first nine words of the film were ' f--- ' . A few people left quite near the beginning . &quot; I understood the script because I have the same sort of background as the screenwriter , Richard Curtis , and used to do quite a lot of comedy myself , and knew exactly where all_the beats and all_the timing should be . And Mike Newell was directing very deliberately against the natural sort of comic beats . So I panicked and thought , ' Are we making_it too serious ? ' &quot; But watching it , I realized he was doing exactly the right thing . In a comic scene Newell makes you play the truth , and to hell with any timing , to hell with comedy , as if we ' ll let that take_care of itself . And although that made me nervous when we were playing it , I see now he was right. &quot; As for the character , &quot; There are elements of the thing which are me -- like the chaos in my life , and I suppose to a certain extent being 33 and not being married and worrying about it a bit , &quot; he says . &quot; But the niceness is not really me , no . When people like that character , they ' re really liking Richard , the screenwriter . I think I ' m a nastier piece of work. &quot; Mike Newell , surprisingly enough , agrees . &quot; I believe him , &quot; Newell says by transatlantic phone , laughing . &quot; He is , of course , two people . And one of the sides that made both of us very nervous was that he has a very cool side to him , a side that observes with irony and candor , and not necessarily kindness , either . He ' s a very bright man , and he sees people ' s foibles and mannerisms very clearly , and you can sometimes see his eyebrow cocking at these things , and you just know that something devastating and witty and not necessarily kind is about to come_out of his mouth . &quot; Now , there is also that kind of shaggy Irish ' Oh God , another piece dropped_off me and I ' m terribly sorry ' charm to him , and it was a matter of emphasis , bringing_on one and keeping_back the other . Oddly enough , I ' m working with him again now on a new film where that polarity is exactly reversed . I want the cruel side of him and I don ' t want all that lovely , raffish charm. &quot; * In most of his films , though , Grant hasn ' t been raffish or cruel -- just constricted . He was typecast to_the_point that a recent Los Angeles magazine review of &quot; Bitter Moon &quot; referred to the actor as &quot; perpetual twit Hugh Grant. &quot; That perception might not have been entirely unreasonable based on the handful of Grant ' s films that have made_it to the United States . His starring breakthrough , &quot; Maurice , &quot; had him as a troubled young_man slowly coming_to terms with his homosexuality in the 1910s ; his next major film , &quot; Impromptu , &quot; was a bit more of a romp , but even there , as the ever-sickly composer Chopin , he was more an unwilling foil for Judy Davis ' wiles . And two of the three films opening this month have him quite repressed . &quot; Sirens &quot; features Grant as a 1930s Anglican priest who visits a painter of nudes , Sam Neill , to try to convince him to tone_down his work , only to find his very proper minister ' s wife drawn into the local sexual experimentation . In &quot; Bitter Moon , &quot; he ' s an all-too-proper Brit on a cruise_ship who ' s repelled yet captivated by Peter Coyote ' s tales of sexual abandon , his wife again resorting_to lurid satisfaction in another cabin . With &quot; Four Weddings , &quot; though , Grant ' s days as a mostly reactionary presence in films may be through , as he gets offered parts a little closer to his own dry screwball charisma or the Newell film ' s joie_de_vivre . Duigan , the &quot; Sirens &quot; director , believes one of Grant ' s most exploitable qualities is &quot; his ability to laugh_at himself , and in a way that perhaps not all that many current actors can . He ' s very open about humorous things that have happened to him ; minor humiliations , he quite relishes actually talking_about , whereas most people would probably keep them under wraps. &quot; * Back in Los Angeles a_few weeks after the Sundance Festival , Grant is holed_up at the Four Seasons Hotel , and isn ' t keeping his frustration under wraps . The second Newell film , &quot; An Awfully Big Adventure , &quot; has been confirmed as a go_in the interim , and he ' s been rehearsing himself for the Dublin shoot in his suite . &quot; When you get a role , there ' s that terrible sort of fear , am I gonna be able to do_it or not ? I ' ve been laughing like a maniac in this room for the past two days . I think the maids are quite wondering about me . He ' s got a laugh , this character , and they describe it . . . . &quot; Grant picks_up the script and reads : &quot; ' Meredith laughs his attractive , open , nervous bray of a laugh , which -- little to do with his real character -- seduces . Using it , he enslaves impressionable people. &quot; ' Says a frustrated Grant , &quot; Could you give me an ' attractive , open , nervous bray of a laugh ' ? A bray is what a donkey does , right ? Hee-haw . But what ' s an attractive bray of a laugh ? I can ' t f---ing do that ! &quot; In &quot; An Awfully Big Adventure , &quot; a comedy-drama based on a Beryl Bainbridge novel , Grant is cast rather against type as the &quot; absolutely vile &quot; antagonist , a charismatic regional theater director in 1946 Liverpool who , being both nasty and gay , inspires the very misplaced crush of a naive teen-aged actress . ( Alan Rickman is also cast unusually , as the hero. ) Grant is spending the rest of his hours in the Four Seasons reading through the dozens of scripts that his new American agent has been collecting since the Sundance buzz . He resists questions about his &quot; stock , &quot; but is prepared_for it to rise . &quot; The only place where they really adore me right now is Japan , where I think for some reason they have a thing about English gentlemen . After ' Maurice ' came_out , I got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of letters with lovely origami dragons and Japanese sweaters and things like that . There ' s a whole book in Japan called ' Hugh Grant Vol . 1 , ' and now there ' s a ' Hugh Grant Vol . 2 ' coming_out -- which I just had translated , and it ' s a very astute work . . . how I like to eat when I ' m relaxing . . . . &quot; I got a script from Japan actually the other day . The translation wasn ' t quite as_good_as it could have been . It began , ' A worker is making a hole in a statue with a dribble ' -- which I assume is meant to be a drill . And then it said , ' Peter enter ' -- Peter is my character -- ' he shout , &quot; Stot , stot , give me the dribble. &quot; ' And it was tempting in a way to do_it , without having it retranslated . &quot; But do you know , they ' re tailing off . How dare they ? When I got_back from Sundance to London , there were not nearly enough Japanese letters , not nearly . I think I ' m a bit long in the tooth for them , actually . I ' ve since discovered a lot of my presents never got_to me . My ( former ) agent intercepted them . I thought I ' d seen him in Japanese jumpers and that beautiful origami mobile hanging in his office . . . &quot; And yes , disappointingly few fan letters from the rest of the world . Only nutters , really , strictly speaking . There are a_few maniac kind of waiters or something who say , ' Hey , &quot; Lair of the White Worm , &quot; great movie , man , ' and then you know that they ' re about to go_off to McDonald ' s and machine-gun a_hundred people. &quot; * Grant has the same doubts about marriage as fame . He implies that he and Hurley may soon start living together again -- probably on home turf , given his proud nationalism -- but very much shares the hesitancy of his &quot; Four Weddings &quot; character to jump into matrimony . He also shares his movie persona ' s philosophical uneasiness about being single , though it ' s not easy to cut_through the cheekiness on these more personal subjects . &quot; You start to feel a little bit strange , don ' t you -- I mean , most of my friends from Oxford now have got paired_off . A few , I ' m delighted to see , are getting divorced . It cheers one up no end , if you have been worried about ' is there something wrong with me ? Why am I not married ? ' &quot; Did I tell you my views on marriage ? About the Von Trapp marriage and ' The Sound of Music ' ? This is my dream of a nice marriage : to be in a big schloss , with enough space so that you and your wife can avoid each other , with a lot of servants to bring the children down , in sailor_suits , preferably in step , at 6 o ' clock_in the evening , have a quick look_at them and then send them off to bed again . &quot; But I cannot seem to envision myself living_in a nice semi-detached_house in South London with two squawling children on the floor with all those hideous toys that they seem to have now . I can ' t bear those horrid primary colors -- they ' re really offensive. &quot;</TEXT>
