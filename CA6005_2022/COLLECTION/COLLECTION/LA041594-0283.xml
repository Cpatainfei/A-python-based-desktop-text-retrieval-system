   <HEADLINE> NOW SELLING : STREISAND PRIME SEATS ; POP_MUSIC : SIX AREA CHARITIES HOLDING TICKETS TO THE ANAHEIM CONCERTS SAY LACK OF PUBLICITY ON THEIR AVAILABILITY IS HURTING SALES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The frenzied public sale of Barbra Streisand tickets last month was over in a flash , but it only marked the beginning of a slow and laborious process for six area charities . As_many as 500 prime seats for each of six shows May 25 through June 4 at the Pond in Anaheim were set_aside to be sold by the organizations , providing a chance for each to make as much as $ 325 # 000 . But some of the charities are worrying that sales are going too slowly , and they blame a difficulty in publicizing the tickets ' availability . &quot; Getting the word out is hard and none of us wants to spend tens of thousands of dollars on advertising , &quot; says Richard Walden , president of Operation USA / LA Earthquake Relief , which holds 450 tickets to the June 2 concert . So far , 50 of them have been sold . Each of the charities was given the chance to pay face_value -- $ 350 -- for the tickets , which then could be sold for as much as $ 1 # 000 each . The charities ' profit from each ticket would be tax-deductible for the buyers . Walden said he and his staff have called ticket brokers in the area anonymously and have found that equivalent seats are selling for $ 1 # 200 to $ 1 # 500 . However , he said , &quot; we don ' t have the money the ticket brokers have to advertise . We ' ve been forced to be very creative about how we find people. &quot; He said his efforts have been coordinated with those of other charities to avoid an &quot; arms race &quot; ; a joint ad recently was placed in the Western edition of the New York Times . A paid ad taken_out by Operation USA will appear in Sunday ' s L.A. Times Calendar . The Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles has sold 75 of its 500 tickets , but President Charles Palmer sounded less concerned than Walden , saying he expects sales to pick_up as the concert approaches . He agreed , though , that greater publicity would make_for a more successful effort . Streisand ' s strategy for assisting charities is an unusual one . A spokesman for the singer said one goal was to partially circumvent the efforts of brokers by forcing them to compete with charities who have direct access to prime seats . * Spokespersons for all_the organizations contacted said the system has some benefits beyond a straight monetary donation . For instance , each organization will be spotlighted during one of the Anaheim concerts , leading to greater publicity and a higher profile . The effort &quot; has been a real shot in the arm for our staff , who often don ' t get this kind of recognition for their work , &quot; Palmer said . &quot; We are of course very grateful . Like many groups , we have had to operate under terrible financial straits as a result of recession. &quot; &quot; We ' re very happy about it , &quot; Walden said . &quot; Of course , we ' d prefer to be sold out. &quot; * The following charities have Streisand tickets available : For May 25 , the National Resources Defense Council / Pesticide Campaign , ( 310 ) 996-1188 ; for May 27 , the Alliance for Children ' s Rights , ( 310 ) 393-5600 ; for May 29 , Girls ' Voices Women ' s Lives , ( 310 ) 478-3002 ; for May 31 , the Legal Aid Foundation , ( 310 ) 477-0672 ; for June 2 , Operation USA / LA Earthquake Relief , ( 310 ) 559-6370 ; for June 4 , United Friends of the Children , ( 213 ) 651-2988 .</TEXT>
