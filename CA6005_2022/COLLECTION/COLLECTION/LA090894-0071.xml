   <HEADLINE> SOCCER ; SURPRISING START FOR QUALIFYING</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Some of Europe ' s most illustrious soccer nations stumbled out of the gate Wednesday as qualifying play began in_earnest for the 1996 European Championship in England . Italy , which lost to Brazil in the 1994 World Cup_final , was lucky to escape with a 1-1 tie against Slovenia in Maribor . Denmark , the defending European champion , was equally fortunate to earn a 1-1 tie with Macedonia in Skopje , where Flemming Povlsen ' s goal three minutes from the end spared the Danes ' blushes . In Bratislava , meanwhile , Slovakia held France , the 1998 World Cup host , to a scoreless tie , while Sweden , which finished third in World Cup ' 94 , managed only a 1-0 victory over Iceland in Reykjavik , thanks to Klas Ingesson ' s goal . For the next 15 months , more_than 270 qualifying games will be played involving 47 European_nations and Israel . The countries were divided into eight groups in January . England , as the host nation for the 10th European Championship , qualifies automatically . There are 15 other places to be won in the 16-team tournament to be played June 8-30 , 1996 , in eight English cities . The breakup of the former Soviet_Union , Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia has turned Europe into a continent of 50 nations , and all but two of them -- Serbia and Bosnia-Herzegovena -- are in the tournament , making_it the second-most important soccer event after the World Cup . The winner of each of the eight groups qualifies , as do the six second-place teams with the best record . The other two second-place teams play off for the last berth in the Euro ' 96 championship . Notes Wednesday ' s surprise results , combined with Israel ' s earlier 2-1 upset of Poland and Croatia ' s defeat of Estonia by the same score , underline the tight nature of the competition . No team is guaranteed of advancing to the final 16 . The Dutch got_off to a promising start Wednesday , however , when they beat Luxembourg , 4-0 , on two goals by Ronald de Boer and one apiece by Bryan Roy and Wim Jonk . Similarly , Portugal began its campaign on a winning note by scoring a 2-1 victory over Northern_Ireland in Belfast . Ireland looked convincing in a 3-0 victory over Latvia in Riga , courtesy of two goals by John Aldridge and another by John Sheridan , but Spain struggled to defeat Cyprus , 2-1 , in Limassol , and Belgium made hard work of a 2-0 victory over Armenia in Brussels . In Cardiff , Wales managed to beat Albania , 2-0 . Norway had to wait 88 minutes before it scored in a 1-0 victory over Belarus . Elsewhere , Hungary and Turkey tied_in Budapest , 2-2 ; Greece overwhelmed the Faroe Islands in Toftir , 5-1 ; Scotland defeated Finland in Helsinki , 2-0 ; Lithuania upset Ukraine by the same score in Kiev ; Romania shut_out Azerbaijan in Bucharest , 3-0 ; Austria routed Liechtenstein in Eschen , 4-0 , and Moldova beat Georgia in Tblisi , 1-0 . The qualifying schedule calls_for 11 more &quot; super Wednesdays &quot; over the next 15 months when most European national teams will be in action on the same day . If Wednesday ' s results are any indication , there are more surprises to come .</TEXT>
