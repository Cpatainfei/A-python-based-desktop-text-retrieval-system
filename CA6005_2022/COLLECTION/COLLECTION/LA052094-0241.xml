   <HEADLINE> BANKS APPROVE PLAN TO RESCUE EURO DISNEY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The 61 creditor banks of the ailing Euro Disney theme park have agreed to a financial restructuring plan aimed at reviving the debt-ridden resort , two of the banks said Thursday . Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Indosuez said a sufficient number of banks have agreed to cover 51 % of a capital boost for Euro Disney . The rescue package features a $ 1.05-billion capital increase through an offering of stock planned for this summer . Shareholders have yet to consider the overall plan . Euro Disney , 20 miles east of Paris in Marne-La-Vallee , has accumulated enormous debt since its opening just over two years ago , although it has become the favorite short-trip destination in Europe . Earlier this month , Euro Disney announced an operating loss for the first_half of 1994 of $ 183.9 million , with revenue dropping 12.4 % to $ 276 million . It has a total debt load of $ 3.7 billion . Euro Disney blames its problems on the European recession , which led to falling real_estate prices and visitors who scrimp once they get_to the park . A preliminary agreement between major creditor banks , Euro Disney and parent company Walt Disney Co. , which owns 49 % of the park , was reached March 14 , but it was contingent_on approval by the 61 creditor banks .</TEXT>
