   <HEADLINE> MORNING BRIEFING : ' 81 , ' 94 YANKEES BOTH WINNERS BUT WORLDS APART IN PERSONALITY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Those who followed the 1981 New York Yankees , the last Yankee World_Series team ( they lost to the Dodgers ) , can ' t help but notice potential similarities with this year ' s first-place Yankee club . First , writes the New York Times ' Jack Curry , Gene Michael was the manager at the beginning of the 1981 season , and he is the general_manager now . And second , the 1981 Yankees won the pennant in a season shortened by a strike . But current Minnesota Twin and famous ex-Yankee Dave Winfield , pointing to the huge characters of the old squad -- Reggie Jackson , Lou Piniella , Rich Gossage and plenty of others -- sees little comparison . &quot; Personality-wise , it ' s not even close , &quot; Winfield told Curry . &quot; You shouldn ' t even try to draw a comparison to what there was in ' 81 and now . But if you ' re talking_about winning , there it is . Other_than that , you can ' t compare things . &quot; Bullpen ? Forget about it . Media attraction as a team ? No comparison. &quot; * Trivia time : Former Dallas Cowboy running back Tony Dorsett gained 12 # 739 yards in his 12-year career and was recently inducted into the Pro Football Hall_of_Fame . How many times did Dorsett win the league rushing title ? * Bobbing for answers : Since ESPN began featuring bobbing-head dolls in commercials for baseball telecasts this year , sales of the nine-inch statues have risen dramatically , according to a report in USA Today Baseball Weekly . &quot; The commercials definitely had an impact on demand and we haven ' t been able to meet it , &quot; said Eddie Miller , vice_president of Twins Enterprise Inc. , manufacturer of the dolls . Widen &amp; Kennedy , the agency that filmed the commercials , said the smiling dolls wearing team uniforms are perfect selling points . &quot; Bobbing-head dolls represent an instant symbol that baseball fans can identify with , &quot; said Larry Frye , a creative director at Widen &amp; Kennedy . &quot; Besides , we were looking_for actors who would n ' t talk back. &quot; * Running with the Pack : Steve McMichael , longtime star defensive tackle with the hated Chicago Bears , has had little trouble adjusting to life with the Green_Bay Packers in his first training camp there . McMichael checked_out the Packer Hall_of_Fame when he got_to Green_Bay and bought a special piece of Packer gear , which he is saving to wear for the Packers ' Oct . 31 game at Soldier Field against the Bears . &quot; I ' ve got my Packer-style foam cheesehead in the truck , &quot; McMichael said . &quot; And if the defense is introduced Halloween night , I might wear it out. &quot; * Strike update : This home run-record note from Boston Globe columnist Peter Gammons : &quot; If the strike lasts until Aug . 26 , Matt Williams will still be ahead of Babe_Ruth ' s 1927 pace ( when he hit 60 home_runs in 154 games ) . &quot; * Trivia answer : Dorsett never won a rushing title . * Quotebook : Chicago White Sox shortstop Ozzie Guillen on what he plans to do during the strike : &quot; If I go_home to Venezuela , I ' ll be_on my boat . I ' ll probably read the papers one day and see the strike is over and the Sox have been playing for three days. &quot; TIM KAWAKAMI</TEXT>
