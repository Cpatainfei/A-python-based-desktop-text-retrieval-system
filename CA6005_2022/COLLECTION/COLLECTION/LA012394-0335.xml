   <HEADLINE> VOICES : THE POLITICIAN PRINCIPAL ; IN ACHIEVING DIFFICULT INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE , A MIDDLE_SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR ADHERED TO ONE OVERRIDING GOAL : THE STUDENTS ' NEEDS COME FIRST. ; GUADALUPE SIMPSON</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When I first came here I just wanted the kids to have an education equal_to middle-class or upper-middle-class kids . I just wanted us ( teachers ) to believe that the kids here could make_it and that they wanted to make_it , ( but that ) it was just more difficult . that ' s really a big vision . Then I re-evaluated , and now I take littler steps . My approach has changed dramatically . I didn ' t really analyze the way things worked or considered ( the school ' s ) very political structure . I wanted to have open discussion with teachers and talk_about instructional change . I was shocked that people didn ' t want that . There was a power_structure in place . I thought , &quot; What ' s going_on here ? &quot; I ' ve changed in what I look_for in teachers . At first I used to look_for someone who was organized and did a lesson plan and had some work ethic . But that wasn ' t enough . I mean , why is it that you ' re organized and have a pretty classroom but the kids still aren ' t going anywhere ? Now I look_for someone who has these skills but who is willing to learn new ideas and techniques and someone who believes the kids can learn . We focus our job interviews now more on a belief system than on your knowledge of English or math . We focus_on your commitment and whether you understand how difficult it is to work with kids in a poor urban_area and how demanding their needs are . that ' s most important . I started working with the teachers where they had strengths . At this school , many teachers had an interest in technology . We became part of the California Model Technology project , where the state gives money to school districts to promote technology in creative ways , and I started working with small groups of teachers who wanted me to be instrumental in helping them change and improve the instructional program . We also have an IBM building . Two-thirds of it is funded by IBM with a $ 280 # 000 grant to improve writing . All 15 teachers who work in that building have been trained by Cal State Dominguez ' s department_of_education through the California Literature Project to use computers in their teaching to enhance writing . Kids are really motivated by technology . I watched kids waiting at 7 a.m. to get_in to use a computer . It ' s a modern-day gimmick , a new way of learning . The computer entertains in a way and it ' s very non-threatening . No one is marking your paper , and when the kids sit at a computer they can write more . Maybe because no one is watching them . Teachers can go_into any child ' s work and look_at it and correct it . * Now , in_order to have a strong instructional program , you have to have a strong discipline program . If you don ' t have the discipline , then kids can ' t learn . But discipline has to be fair . Strong discipline doesn ' t mean ( to ) just punish kids . At this school with such large_numbers , some kids were being referred for discipline over and over . So I decided we needed more and better counseling so kids could learn how to take_charge of their behavior and function in a society . Slowly I got one extra counselor , then another . The parents bought_into the idea and newer teachers bought_into it . Now we have 10 counselors . For a school this size it ' s not enough , but it ' s a start . I truly believe that if you tell kids , &quot; You are really wonderful ; you are the best class in the school , &quot; the kids will believe it and they will produce . Last year I had a lot of teachers tell me , &quot; Mrs . Simpson , this class of sixth-graders is the best class I ' ve ever had. &quot; Finally one teacher figured it out . He said , &quot; This is the class ( that will graduate in ) 2000 , and they ' ve been told since kindergarten they were wonderful and they were going_to make a difference -- and they ' ve been telling them and telling them . that ' s why they ' re wonderful. &quot; There are some administrators who can get things done because they ' re politicians . I don ' t like to be a politician . I like to be a person who is an advocate for children . But to be really , really effective , to get things done , you have to be a politician and an advocate for children . I never forget that I ' m trying to do_it for children . If I ' m going_to do_it for my ego or because I want to make some teachers happy , that ' s not the way to do_it . You have to truly analyze and study how it ' s going_to better the children and how it ' s going_to better their future , and then you can fight for it . And I don ' t let anybody get_in my way . When we applied for the IBM grant we were told that the district was not going_to allow schools to apply for it individually . We already had a science grant with IBM , and IBM wanted us to apply for this grant for English . * I had to evaluate , after I had gotten all these teachers ' input and parental input , and done politics with the union , whether I was going_to take_on the district or tell these teachers and everyone that they couldn ' t do the project . So I decided I would innovatively tell the district what I had to . I basically took the district my application and just told them I didn ' t know I couldn ' t apply . I took it the very last_day and I played stupid . that ' s what we call innovative intervention . You know what my boss told me ? &quot; I ' m really proud_of you , but don ' t ever apply for a promotion because you ' re done in. &quot; I said , &quot; I didn ' t do this for a promotion . I did_it because it ' s very important for our instructional program. &quot; How do you work within the district ? You have to have a vision . You have to play politics . I guess I would have an easier time if I were not so strong-headed , but if we lose our focus that children are our No . 1 priority we can ' t do what ' s right for kids . Kids here have nothing , no parks , no recreation areas . They just have us . I read this article that said when we start fighting about the school and fighting for kids , that ' s when change is going_to happen , instead of fighting about money and power . we ' ll get there . It ' ll take a long_time , but we ' ll get there .</TEXT>
