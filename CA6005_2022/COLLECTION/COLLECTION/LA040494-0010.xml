   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : TODAY ' S TOPIC</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For hundreds of thousands of foreign students , the United States -- with its superior colleges and universities -- is still the promised land . And so , when two Japanese students -- Go Matsuura and Takuma Ito -- were gunned_down in a carjacking in San Pedro last month , their deaths became more_than two shocking murders . The young_men took with them a slice of the American_Dream . In today ' s Community Essay , writer Kinue Tokudome deplores the seemingly endless cycle of violence in the United States and she urges Americans to act immediately to get guns off their streets . To help foreign students adjust to life in the United States , most colleges and universities offer orientation_courses and counseling . Still , the culture shock can sometimes be extraordinary . In today ' s Platform , students from places as diverse as Lithuania , Pakistan and Jamaica discuss how different their lives are here compared to home . While many -- but certainly not all -- foreign students come from safer environments , it appears that few of them will return home as a result of the killings . &quot; The students I have spoken_to recognize that this random quality to violence is part of life in the United States , &quot; says Dixon Johnson , executive_director of the Office for International Students and Scholars at USC . &quot; They cope very well considering that. &quot; In fact , the Institute of International Education in New York reports that almost 440 # 000 foreign students were willing to cope_with life in the United States in the 1992-1993 school_year . The largest_number of those , more_than 57 # 000 , attended schools in California . While there is no evidence of a mass exodus as a result of the killings of the Japanese students , some educators worry that the American reputation for violence will eventually take its toll on foreign student enrollment . &quot; I think we may find students are being scared_away from California because of a whole host of things that we ' re familiar_with , &quot; says Robert Ericksen , director of International Education and Exchange at Cal State Fullerton . &quot; This incident will create more reluctance . &quot; I see countries like Britain and Australia heavily recruiting foreign students , who may turn_to those places more frequently in the future , &quot; Ericksen says . From a practical point_of_view , losing foreign students means losing the dollars they pay_for tuition . Todd Davis , director_of_research at the Institute of International Education , says about two-thirds of the foreign students attending schools in the United States pay full tuition . &quot; They help support our higher education in times of softening enrollment , &quot; Davis says . &quot; And they contribute to the local economy. &quot; More_than dollars and cents , however , educators believe foreign students contribute to the diverse fabric of campus life . Says Dr. Richard Pedersen , director of international programs at Cal Poly Pomona : &quot; Foreign students bring into a student body a knowledge about the world that most students would never get. &quot;</TEXT>
