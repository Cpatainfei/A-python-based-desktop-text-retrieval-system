   <HEADLINE> TREADING SOFTLY ; A HIGH SIERRA SNOWSHOE SHUFFLE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> For most people , snowshoeing calls to mind grizzled fur-trappers with French accents traversing the Yukon avoiding ze bair while in search of pelts of bee vair . But when my wife Kathleen and I found ourselves making like Pierre and Lulu in the Far North -- of California , that is -- we were in fact retracing some of the steps of pioneer scout Kit Carson on the first east-to-west Sierra crossing . Not that we ' d planned it that way . And not that Kit Carson could ever possibly have looked_like us , limbs akimbo , our initial rhythmic flailing eventually settling into , well , permanent rhythmic flailing . No , what we ' d originally planned was an extended weekend ski trip . I ' ve visited literally dozens of ski resorts since I began skiing a decade ago , and Kirkwood , southeast of South Lake Tahoe near Carson Pass , stood_out as having provided one of my most fun days ever . I ' d been trying to get_back ever since , and this year I wasn ' t going_to let it get_away from me . My wife and I arranged for a leisurely arrival and three full days at the resort ; her only stipulation was that the trip not be devoted solely to skiing , that one of the three days we try something entirely different . Perhaps she was thinking_about a sleigh ride . We flew into Reno Airport in early January , picked_up our rental car and began the 77-mile drive to Kirkwood . We ' d chosen the least expensive condominium , and awaiting us at the 52-unit Meadows was a decidedly functional studio , with a Murphy_bed and no hangers , but with a fireplace and kitchen that made_it perfect for romantic evenings in . ( South Lake Tahoe accommodations are also within easy striking distance , 30 miles , and often more economical. ) We prepared our own meals -- an elaborate salade Nic oise one night , for example , and the best spare ribs of our lives together -- and experimented with Australian cabernets we ' d found in a Carson City supermarket on the drive down . At 7 # 800 feet , Kirkwood Ski Resort boasts the highest base elevation of any Tahoe resort . It ' s a family-style place ; junior night life includes a slam dunk competition , and two lifts serve beginners ' terrain exclusively . Some prices had been markedly reduced since my visit several seasons ago . A first-time skier package , for example , including lift ticket , rentals and clinic -- the word lesson is studiously avoided -- has gone_down from $ 40 to $ 25 . Clinics , once $ 18 , are now $ 12 . On our first day , I explored all lifts save the double-black-diamond Wagon_Wheel , figuring I still had two days to screw_up my courage . Careening up and down the walls of Kirkwood ' s gullies was a blast . Late last year , when Kathleen was out of town , I ' d attended a slide presentation on snowshoeing at a local outfitters store . Not to mix metaphors too liberally , I was pretty hot to try my , um , foot at the sport , and so it was that we shoe-horned a day between two others on the slopes . We began it by making a beeline for Kirkwood ' s Cross_Country Center . The snowshoes , $ 10 per day , were one-size-fits-all ; poles came_with the package . The old wooden snowshoes were wide and heavy , up_to 10 pounds , and basically awkward . Newer aluminum-and-Hypalon models such_as those we wore can be less than two pounds , and agile enough to run races . Indeed , there are more_than 50 snowshoe races in the U.S. this season , most notably Alaska ' s 100-mile &quot; Iditashoe. &quot; If you can walk , you can snowshoe , so there was no need for lessons . We drove along frozen Caples Lake , out on the middle of which we spotted a fox sizing_up fish through a hole in the ice , and past the turn-off to the Schneider Cow Camp , to Carson Pass at 8 # 573 feet . We parked at the Sno-Park , and immediately knew we ' d come_to the right place , for there was a monument to &quot; Snowshoe Thom ( p ) son , &quot; a.k.a. John Tostensen , &quot; a true pioneer. &quot; Thom ( p ) son -- the spelling of his name is a matter of contention -- carried U.S. mail in winter over routes impassable by horse or wagon . We entered the Mokelumne Wilderness at the Carson Pass trail head . Signs warned about avalanche danger and described our itinerary as a 10-kilometer loop . We agreed that we could turn_back at any point . Descending into the forest , we saw no bear tracks , but any number of huge cat paws . We almost immediately lost sight of distinctive Elephants Back mountain , and simultaneously any sense of orientation . We were not exactly old_hands with a topographic map , and choosing the right trail often proved tricky . But somebody must have known that , for blue diamond cross-country markers , and blue_ribbons tied to tree_branches , helped us find our way . We followed them and were occasionally reassured by snowshoe tracks coming_back in the other direction . Of course , those could have been Snowshoe Thom ( p ) son ' s , for all we knew . My snowshoeing technique could certainly have stood some fine-tuning , since I fell not once , not twice , but three times , in each case the toe of one shoe becoming ensnared half way up the the heel of the other . ( It turns_out the shoes can easily be adjusted for us pigeon-toed folks. ) My wife experienced no such problems . We had figured that snowshoeing might be grueling , but the exertion proved similar to that of any hike . And as might be expected on any hike in any season , quick gains in elevation required the greatest effort . The trail suddenly opened onto an incredible vista . We were an hour out , and it seemed the perfect time for a PowerBar : &quot; fuel for optimum performance , &quot; the package proclaimed . Unfortunately , the bars were too cold to bite into , but they gradually thawed in the sun . * We turned another corner and Elephants Back suddenly loomed before us , resembling less an elephant ' s back than that of a humpback_whale . As we made our way along its base , the wind-swept slopes of snow offered imprints similar to those left by waves at the seashore . We sat_down on a rock and looked_out_on an environment undisturbed by motion in any direction , and confident in our notion that we were the only people as far as the eye could see . That notion was presently dispelled when two cross-country skiers skied up , just in time to take our photo with Round_Top Peak in the background . For those so inclined , the summit of Elephants Back , a couple hundred feet above , appeared an easy walk up the south flank . Since we didn ' t know what lay ahead , it seemed to come_down to a choice between taking a leisurely lunch and soaking in the utter perfection of the moment , or continuing our hike . We were awfully happy nestled there , and such moments are not to be taken lightly . We enjoyed our picnic in the snow , peppered turkey pastrami sandwiches and fruit , delicious out of all proportion . Perhaps if we ' d known then that Carson and Lt . John Fremont had actually climbed Elephants Back , and from that vantage Carson had recognized mountains bordering the coast that allowed him to chart the party ' s course to Sutter ' s Fort , we ' d have decided otherwise . And perhaps not . On our return trip , a firm sense_of_direction established , following a trail seemed decidedly less crucial . We winged it across an expanse of white until at tree_line -- in this case a stark boundary between forest and slope -- we espied a tiny blue diamond marking our way home . Instead of walking on the packed snow of the cross-country trail , however , we continued to break our own trail through the woods , making an endless succession of what every alpine skier dreams of , fresh tracks in virgin powder . Relatively loud on hard pack , the shoes now proved far quieter . With Kathleen in_the_lead , I watched the snow fly from side to side in a motion that lent her the air of a happily waddling duck . Exiting the trail head , we noticed another marker buried in several feet of snow . I could just make_out &quot; Carson , &quot; and proceeded to dig it out : &quot; On this spot . . . stood what was known as the Kit Carson tree , on which the famous scout inscribed his name in 1844. &quot; I also more closely examined the obelisk to Snowshoe Thom ( p ) son , erected as part of bicentennial projects by Nevada members &quot; of the ancient and honorable E Clampus Vitus . &quot; Among chapters listed as donors was the Transierra Roisterous Alliance of Senior Humbugs , whose acronym apparently would be TRASH . When our third morning dawned , Kirkwood ' s Wagon_Wheel lift still beckoned , and courage high , sort of , I rode it up . I also skied down , sort of .
