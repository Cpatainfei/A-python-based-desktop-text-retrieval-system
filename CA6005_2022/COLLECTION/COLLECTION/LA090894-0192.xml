   <HEADLINE> N . IRELAND PEACE A U.S. PRIORITY , GORE SAYS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Vice_President Al Gore declared Wednesday that the Northern_Ireland peace process currently under way is &quot; right at the top &quot; of the U.S. foreign_policy agenda . The vice_president met Irish Prime_Minister Albert Reynolds at Shannon Airport in Ireland during a refueling stop on his way back to Washington from a world population conference in Cairo . After a briefing from Reynolds on the state of the cease-fire announced a week ago by the_Irish Republican Army , Gore said : &quot; The American people have a dream that this peace process will succeed . It is right at the top of our foreign_policy agenda. &quot; He added : &quot; President Bill_Clinton and I stand ready , as do all_the American people , to support our British and Irish friends in their efforts to achieve peace . &quot; The President and I commend those who have worked so diligently over the past 25 years to achieve what at times seemed impossible to find -- a way to peace. &quot; Gore declared that the United States wants to help both Protestant and Roman_Catholic communities in Northern_Ireland in the search for a lasting solution to the long-running sectarian violence . &quot; Each side stands only to lose by further violence , &quot; he said . &quot; Both can gain the promise of a better , more prosperous future for their children through a just and lasting peace. &quot; The two leaders met less than 24 hours after Reynolds held a first-ever conference with Irish Republican leader Gerry Adams , head of Sinn Fein , the IRA ' s political arm . Gore and Reynolds discussed how the United States could further support the drive for peace amid speculation that an aid package of about $ 130 million will be made available by Washington . For his part , Reynolds praised the &quot; sustained and crucial support given by the U.S. Administration to the process of peace and the development of an agreed political settlement. &quot; He added : &quot; The government here attaches great importance to the continuing support of President Clinton and his Administration in_advancing the process . They have played a very , very significant role in bringing us to the present position . They have encouraged others to turn_away from violence for good. &quot; Gore said that whether the unionists , who advocate continued British rule_in Northern_Ireland , will join Reynolds ' planned National Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is a matter for them to decide but that he would encourage everyone to take_part . Meanwhile , British Northern_Ireland Secretary Patrick Mayhew said Wednesday that security levels in the province have been scaled_down since the cease-fire went_into effect . Though British Prime_Minister John Major on Wednesday continued to press for Sinn Fein to issue a &quot; clear-cut , unequivocal &quot; declaration renouncing violence , Mayhew disclosed that police and military_forces in Northern_Ireland have reduced security precautions . Mayhew said soldiers were patrolling in Northern_Ireland wearing berets instead of hard helmets . In parts of Belfast on Wednesday , there were no soldiers to be seen on patrol . Some checkpoints had been removed from roads leading into the province . The Rev . Ian Paisley , the militant unionist leader , came under criticism from other unionists in Belfast on Wednesday for his performance in a meeting with Major on Tuesday evening . Major dismissed Paisley because he would not accept the prime_minister ' s word that Northern_Ireland Protestants ' constitutional rights will be protected in any peace accord . William Ross , a leading member of the official Ulster Unionist Party , said he would take a &quot; very dim view &quot; of joining a unionist forum organized by Paisley , who heads the Democratic Unionist Party . &quot; Many members of the party are outraged , &quot; Ross said . &quot; Ian Paisley clearly set_out with the sole purpose of having a confrontation . This is not what unionism needs at this time. &quot;</TEXT>
