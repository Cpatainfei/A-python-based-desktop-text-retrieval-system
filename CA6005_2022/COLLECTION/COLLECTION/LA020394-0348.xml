   <HEADLINE> ASIANS START CELEBRATING NEW YEAR ' S IN OLD WAYS ; CULTURE : RITUALS , AND EVEN THE DATES OF THE HOLIDAY , VARY BY NATION OF ORIGIN . THE JAPANESE HAD THEIRS ALREADY -- ON WESTERN NEW YEAR ' S .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A week from today , Korean American children will take a moment to bow to senior_citizens at the Garden Grove Community Meeting Center , displaying respect for their elders in a New Year ' s ritual that will accompany traditional Korean dances and tea ceremonies . An estimated 400 people at the festival will feast on bulgogi ( barbecued beef ) and kimchi ( pickled cabbage ) . This weekend , thousands of visitors to the Vietnamese Community_Center in Santa Ana and Golden West College in Westminster will eat spring_rolls with fish sauce and watch &quot; dragons &quot; dance in honor of Tet , the Vietnamese new year . And at Irvine Valley College , Mandarin-language hip-hop music blared as students ate egg_rolls and women donned Ming Dynasty gowns of red and gold in a Chinese new year celebration held Wednesday , eight days early . From the well-known Tet festivals to the less-famous Cambodian rituals , many Orange County Asian groups will celebrate the lunar new year in upcoming days . But the traditions they observe will be as diverse as the nations they represent . &quot; It ' s the most important ( holiday ) for many Asian cultures , regardless of when ( and how ) they celebrate it , &quot; said Audrey Yamagata-Noji , a trustee of the Santa Ana Unified School District . &quot; There are certain customs , superstitions , meanings . For many Asian groups it ' s the most critical celebration of the year. &quot; Some Asian Americans will not celebrate at all this month . Japanese Americans won ' t be drinking the traditional New Year ' s Eve toso sake ( rice wine ) or eat toshikoshi ( crossing the year ) buckwheat noodles on Feb . 9 . While the Japanese observed the lunar new year in years gone_by , they have long since adopted the Western calendar -- in Japan as well as the United States . &quot; I never heard of any Japanese American group ( in Orange County ) celebrating ( the lunar new year ) , &quot; said Junko Fuji , who teaches Japanese language and culture at several Orange County community_colleges . &quot; In Japan , in remote countryside areas , they might occasionally. &quot; For Cambodian and Thai groups , planning for the New Year ' s celebration hasn ' t even begun . Those groups celebrate the new year for three days beginning April 13 . The &quot; lunar_year in Cambodian and Thai cultures is different , &quot; said Vora Kanthoul , head of the United Cambodian Community . April in Cambodia and Thailand is the hottest month , a time of relaxation and vacation after the harvest and before May rains , he said . In those three days , people visit Buddhist temples and pray , share food and play traditional games such_as Cambodian choong , ( a tossing game ) or tug-of-war . Children are expected to pay respect_to their elders by sprinkling perfume on them , said Kanthoul . In Orange County , the best-known festival is the Feb . 13-15 Vietnamese Tet celebration , which includes fireworks , gifts to children of red envelopes containing money , and colorful , traditional costumes . Chinese Americans here may celebrate the lunar new year together at private banquets , said Frank So , one of the directors of the Orange County Chinese American Chamber_of_Commerce . &quot; There ' s quite a_few Chinese Americans in Orange County , but they ' re scattered about , &quot; So said . &quot; They celebrate in their own groups. &quot; Debra Shen , an Irvine Valley College_student who attended Wednesday ' s celebration , which was staged by the campus Chinese Cultural Assn. , agreed . &quot; If not for this , I would probably not do anything for the new year , just call my parents ( in Taiwan ) , &quot; she said . Perhaps , Shen said , she would attend the Little Saigon Tet festivals . &quot; It ' s a little different -- the language , the food , &quot; she said . &quot; But I like it. &quot; Lunar Calendar Chinese legend has it that when Buddha invited all_the animals to visit him , only 12 came , led by the rat . The animals were rewarded by having years named after them in the order of their arrival . The legend also holds that a person will exhibit characteristics of the animal attached_to the year of his or her birth . The year beginning Feb . 10 is the Year of the Dog . Add in multiples of 12 from the year of your birth to determine which animal applies to you . Here are some of the reputed characteristics of the animals : 1994 Dog : Loyal , altruistic , attentive , guarded , stubborn , a critic . 1995 Boar / Pig : Honest , sociable , cultured , a pacifist , gullible , willful and wimpy . 1996 Rat : Charming , sentimental , industrious , gossipy , neurotic and quick-tempered . 1997 Ox / Buffalo : Patient , selfless , industrious , proud , bossy , vindictive and jealous . 1998 Tiger : Passionate , liberal , gutsy , fortunate , sensitive , undisciplined , conceited , rash and rude . 1999 Rabbit / Cat : Steady , ambitious , friendly , discreet , aloof , sneaky and antisocial . 2000 Dragon : Vivacious , lucky , intuitive , powerful , generous , sharp , impetuous , demanding , judgmental and stubborn . 2001 Snake : Amusing , cultured , calm , deep-thinking , possessive , lazy , vengeful . 2002 Horse : Industrious , independent , strong , eloquent , selfish , rebellious , ruthless and rude . 2003 Sheep / Goat : Stylish , lovable , generous , passive , insecure and pessimistic . 2004 Monkey : Friendly , vivacious , inventive , amusing , independent , opportunistic , devious and unscrupulous . 2005 Rooster : Lively , resourceful , adventurous , pompous , narrow-minded and impractical .
