   <HEADLINE> A WAY TO SAVE TIME , MONEY ON DYE JOBS ? ; HAIR_CARE : COLOR-ENHANCING SHAMPOOS AND CONDITIONERS PROMISE TO OFFSET FADING EFFECTS . BUT THEY DON ' T DO WONDERS FOR THE TINT OR TEXTURE OF TRESSES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The new color-enhancing shampoos and conditioners seem just right for the ' 90s . They promise to make busy women who dye their hair less dependent_on the salon , or the Loving Care , by offsetting the fading effects of sun and shampoo between treatments . Some women swear by them . But others wonder if the potential savings in time and money is worth the extra hassle . In evaluating whether these products will work for you , take_note of what they do and don ' t do . Enhancers won ' t cover roots or gray . Instead , they are designed to add color to hair previously treated with permanent color , helping to blend ends and roots between treatments . They are temporary and contain no peroxide , but they can stain tubs , towels and even hands . And , as the labels warn , they may irritate sensitive skin . Here are my impressions of a sampling of enhancers I recently put to the test on my fine , curly , easily fried , blondish hair . * Clairol Color Hold ColorRefresher , 4 ounces , $ 4.49 in drugstores . Although some of the enhancers have serious staining capability , this one left scarcely any visible color on the tub , so I used my ivory-colored towels with confidence . Nary a stain resulted . After a quick blow dry , my hair felt soft and smooth , and looked very shiny . I carefully searched for newfound gold on my ends and thought I saw some , but no one commented on a change in my hair ' s appearance . J.F. Lazartigue Colour Reflecting Hair Conditioner , 3.4 ounces , $ 31 at the J.F. Lazartigue shops in Beverly Hills and Costa Mesa . Talk_about indulgent . Between the steep price_tag and the directions stipulating that the creamy , pearlized , honey-colored mixture be left on the head for anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes , I felt totally decadent using this product . ( Pardon me while I postpone my life , I thought to myself as I waited for the minimum time to lapse. ) What the product lacked in_color effect ( negligible ) , it more_than made_up for in its conditioning ability . My hair emitted a shine , even from the slightly enhanced split_ends that appeared mended . Paul Mitchell Creatives Color Infusing Shampoo , 8 ounces , $ 9.95 at beauty_salons . Of all_the products I tried , this one appeared to have the most color_in it . I applied the prescribed small amount , whipped my hair into a frenzied lather and waited five minutes before rinsing . It stung my eyes . My newly tinted tresses were a tangled web when I finished , so I applied conditioner , as the bottle suggested . Although that helped , I wasn ' t nearly as pleased with the texture of my hair as I was with its slightly more golden color . Mastey Colour Refreshing Shampoo , 8 ounces , $ 8 at beauty_salons . This shampoo is by far the gentlest to the hair of all_the non-conditioning enhancers I tried . It was possible to use the product without following up with a conditioner . It blended the roots with my over-processed ends , and I was satisfied with the texture of my hair , but I still needed a dye job in the worst way . Aussie Intermissions Color Enhancing Shampoo , 10 ounces , $ 4.99 at drugstores . The most affordable of the shampoo enhancers I tried , this one was also the most problematic . I applied the shampoo to my palms as suggested , but a bit ran_down the side of my already wet tub and stained it to_the_point that I had to get_out the Ajax . Because the label suggested a second application , I repeated the process immediately . I noticed a marked difference in the color , but I was unhappy with the strawlike texture of my hair , even after an application of conditioner . * In my experience , the new color enhancers have a long way to go . They seem too weak to reduce the frequency of color appointments , as a Roux rinse can . And because some of them are nearly as messy as a rinse and seem to wreak havoc with already taxed tresses , the effort isn ' t worth the side_effects . With the money saved forestalling a salon appointment , you may have to invest in a deep conditioner . For now , the best bet may be a combination of enhancers : I may try the Mastey shampoo and follow it with either the Lazartigue or Clairol conditioners .</TEXT>
