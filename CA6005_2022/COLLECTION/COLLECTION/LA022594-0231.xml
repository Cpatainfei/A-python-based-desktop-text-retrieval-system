   <HEADLINE> YELTSIN TARGETS CRIME AS NO . 1 RUSSIA PROBLEM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Admitting that Russia is mired in chaos and crime , President Boris N . Yeltsin proposed a new regime of law , order and political cooperation on Thursday in his first_State of the Nation speech to the new Parliament . He struck such a conciliatory note that he did not even mention the lawmakers ' defiant vote on Wednesday to pardon all his political foes who face charges for their roles in the 1991 coup attempt and last October ' s Moscow clashes . Instead , he declared that Russia ' s period of conflict was at an end . Political battles &quot; can have only one outcome -- the destruction of Russia , &quot; said Yeltsin , looking fit if sounding a bit hoarse as he spoke in the Kremlin ' s Marble Hall . &quot; The time for the internecine struggle for Russia has fully run out. &quot; He argued that the government must rather concentrate its energy on fighting crime -- &quot; the question of the year &quot; -- and making_sure that the country ' s laws are solid and enforced . He also asserted that Russia ' s market-oriented economic reforms will continue full-force , though under better regulation . Yeltsin sounded one combative note -- on foreign_policy , a subject he addresses at_home infrequently . Henceforth Russia will assert its national interests more vigorously , he vowed , citing his government ' s recent role in the Bosnian crisis as evidence that it will not tolerate being ignored . Russia will take more responsibility for peacekeeping operations in the former Soviet_Union and for defending ethnic Russians living_in the former Soviet republics , he added . But the 49-minute televised speech offered little new overall , and its generalities prompted more_than one Parliament member to comment that it resembled a typical gust of hot_air from a Communist_Party general secretary in the old days . But it was perhaps most interesting in what it did not say . Yeltsin abandoned his old habit of accusing Communists and opposition members of causing most of the country ' s ills . He made no threats . He strove to raise his presidential role above the political fray , to become the lofty figure envisioned in the constitution who gives the country its direction and then stands_back . By admitting that his government is riddled with corruption and confusion , Yeltsin also showed a new awareness of_his_own responsibility for many of the problems that economic reforms have brought . The main slogan of his speech , &quot; Stronger Russian Statehood , &quot; amounted to a call to straighten_out the country beginning with his own bureaucrats . Economist Pavel Bunich was encouraged by what the speech did not say about the reforms : Yeltsin did not say he agreed with conservative Prime_Minister Viktor S . Chernomyrdin on the need to resort_to such drastic means as freezing prices or salaries to stem inflation . &quot; It was key that the president confirmed the continuation of the course of reforms , &quot; Bunich told the daily newspaper Izvestia . He also praised Yeltsin ' s tact in not mentioning the Parliament ' s amnesty for the alleged coup plotters and the October rebels . In the past , Yeltsin would probably have struck back at Parliament immediately . But his inability to work with his old Parliament led to the loss of more_than 140 lives in the fighting that followed his decree dissolving it last fall . On Thursday , he simply commented pointedly that social harmony does not mean &quot; forgiving everything &quot; and that mercy should not contradict the laws of morality . The fate of the imprisoned leaders of the October rebellion , including former Vice_President Alexander V . Rutskoi and former Supreme Soviet Chairman Ruslan I . Khasbulatov , remained unclear Thursday night . Yeltsin ' s spokesman , Vyacheslav V . Kostikov , said the legal battle over whether lawmakers had the right to issue the amnesty would last long enough so that the accused plotters would not be let_out in &quot; the coming weeks or months. &quot; However , Russia ' s chief prosecutor , Alexei Kazannik , indicated that as soon as he got the paperwork from the Parliament he would drop the cases against the alleged plotters as instructed and release them . The Itar-Tass news_agency carried the text of the amnesty Thursday night , satisfying the requirement that the document be published to come_into force . Relatives of some of the accused held_in Moscow ' s Lefortovo Prison waited outside in the heavy snow for hours hoping for their release , but eventually they gave_up . Lawmakers who voted overwhelmingly for the amnesty said they saw it as paving the way for greater political harmony . Yeltsin called_for exactly the same thing in his speech , but it remained to be seen whether he would go_along with letting all his worst enemies out of jail . In his speech , Yeltsin complained that during Russia ' s transition from the old Communist system to a market-driven economy , &quot; those who cheat and use violence are having a field day. &quot; Using some of his strongest language yet about the crime problem , he said &quot; the country is being swept by a crime_wave , &quot; and organized crime is trying to &quot; get the country by the neck. &quot; He called rampant bribery &quot; a grave disease of the young Russian state. &quot; &quot; Let us at long last recognize that so far we have a weak state and that there is no elementary order in the country , &quot; he said in a virtual admission of_his_own failure . As a remedy for Russia ' s many ills , he proposed the stable base of the country ' s new constitution , passed_on Dec . 12 . With that new foundation , Yeltsin argued , the country could start to build law and order , beginning with anti-crime laws passed_by the new Parliament . He also promised greater assistance to Russia ' s factories , many of which are grinding to a halt under both a tremendous tax burden and the difficulties of making_it in the market system . At the same time , he demanded a halt to the government practice of granting giant subsidies and cheap loans to whatever enterprises lobby the best . In Washington , Secretary_of_State Warren Christopher praised Yeltsin ' s speech , saying it &quot; came_down in favor of continuation of reform. &quot; &quot; From what I saw , he was in a strong , vigorous mood and made a strong , vigorous speech , which is a good sign_in itself , &quot; Christopher told the House Foreign Affairs Committee . Times staff writer Norman Kempster in Washington contributed to this report .</TEXT>
