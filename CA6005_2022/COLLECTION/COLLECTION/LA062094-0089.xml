   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; SPOTLIGHT ; NO DANCING AROUND THEIR LOVE OF SOCCER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It ' s an international melting_pot , that line outside the McDonald ' s chuck_wagon at the Rose Bowl ' s World Cup food cart . Waiting patiently for their sack of Big Macs were Fernando Bujones and his wife Maria , two ballet instructors who are in Pasadena mixing business with their love of soccer . Bujones , 39 , a guest artist with the Boston Ballet and a serious Brazil fan , is attempting to &quot; squeeze in 15 to 20 &quot; World Cup matches between tour stops during the next month . After catching Romania-Colombia and Sweden-Cameroon at the Rose Bowl , he flies to Palo Alto today for Brazil ' s Group_B opener against Russia . &quot; I say it will be 2-0 , Brazil , &quot; Bujones boldly predicted . &quot; I like their chances in the tournament , but they must be careful . Brazil has been hurt by over-predicting in the past. &quot; Bujones said Germany scares him -- &quot; They are still a team that can compete &quot; -- and tabbed Romania as a dangerous dark_horse . &quot; Gheorghe Hagi is an unbelievable powerhouse , &quot; he said . &quot; Even if Romania does not win , Hagi will have established himself as a superstar in this World Cup. &quot; Bujones smiled . &quot; As you can see , I am an avid fan. &quot; Bujones met his wife when both danced with Stuttgart Ballet . &quot; I love the World Cup , &quot; Bujones said . &quot; I love American_football too , but I think soccer should be part of the American sports scene . Maybe Americans will learn to appreciate it now so that when the World Cup comes here again , America will be able to win it. &quot; MIKE PENNER</TEXT>
