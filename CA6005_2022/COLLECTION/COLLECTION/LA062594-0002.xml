   <HEADLINE> JAPAN ' S HATA RESIGNS AS PREMIER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Facing a no-confidence motion he admitted he could not defeat , Prime_Minister Tsutomu Hata resigned today and said he would &quot; entrust my future &quot; to Parliament . Hata , elected prime_minister only eight weeks ago , said he is stepping_down to avoid a general_election that he said would have thwarted political reforms enacted last March after a five-year struggle . Choosing a prime_minister in the lower house also would enable Japan to send a leader not threatened by an ouster to the annual Group of Seven economic summit in Naples , Italy , July 8-10 , he noted in a televised news_conference . Hata ' s dramatic decision was made less than an hour before a plenary session of the lower house was scheduled to vote on a no-confidence motion submitted Thursday by the Liberal Democratic Party . If he had lost the vote , Hata would have had to dissolve the lower house and call snap elections . &quot; Japan cannot afford a monthlong hiatus in politics &quot; that such a series of events would have caused , he said . When the balloting for a new prime_minister would occur was not immediately known . Hata ' s declaration that he would &quot; entrust my future &quot; to Parliament meant he was not ruling_out running as a candidate again . But his chances of reelection appeared uncertain . With no party holding a majority , another coalition will be needed to form a government . Hata , who led Japan ' s first minority administration in decades , said he would bow to the Parliament ' s decisions in naming a new government . &quot; Our most urgent task is to form a stable government , &quot; Hata said . &quot; I want to avoid a political vacuum by every means. &quot; Last year , former Prime_Minister Kiichi Miyazawa was forced to host the Group of Seven economic summit in Tokyo in the middle of a campaign for a general_election that he called after the lower house passed a no-confidence motion against him . Hata , along with Ichiro Ozawa , his chief strategist -- both of whom bolted the Liberal Democrats to appeal for political reform -- led the rebellion against Miyazawa . A subsequent election in July sealed the end of the Liberal Democrats ' 38-year rule . Just two days ago , Hata said he was willing to resign -- but at that time , he made the offer on the assumption that the Socialist_Party , which bolted his coalition April 26 , would support him for reelection . On Friday , the Socialists withdrew that assurance , precipitating consultations and bargaining that continued until early today . Wataru Kubo , the Socialists ' secretary_general , informed Ozawa on Friday afternoon that his party would not again support Hata , reneging_on more_than a month of declarations that Hata ' s &quot; voluntary &quot; resignation would provide a face-saving prerequisite for the party ' s return to the coalition . Ozawa immediately withdrew the offer of Hata ' s resignation and went_to the prime_minister ' s office . Nearly 10 1 / 2 hours later -- at 3:30 a.m. today -- Ozawa emerged , saying only that consultations with the Socialists &quot; are not over yet. &quot; He refused to elaborate . The marathon talks suggested that Ozawa opposed Hata ' s decision to step_down . After Hata announced his resignation less than eight hours later , Socialist Chairman Tomiichi Murayama told a news_conference that his party &quot; at the moment , is not thinking_of a Socialist-Liberal Democrat coalition. &quot; Instead , he said consultations with Hata ' s coalition parties should be continued and expanded to include the splinter New Party Harbinger of Masayoshi Takemura , who served as chief Cabinet secretary in the coalition government until the departure of former Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa in April . Although the New Party Harbinger voted for Hata as prime_minister , it refused to join his Cabinet . Murayama noted that the current session of Parliament is scheduled to end Wednesday . If negotiations on a new coalition cannot be completed by then , he said , his party would support extending the session for a short period to permit election of a prime_minister . The Socialist leader agreed with Hata that a stable government with majority support is needed to cope_with a host of issues facing the nation . A Socialist return to the coalition , by itself , would give the ruling group_a razor-thin majority of only one seat in the lower house . The Socialists ' departure from the Cabinet in April left the coalition with only 37 % of the seats in the lower house . Only the necessity to enact Japan ' s 1994 budget -- which passed the upper house Thursday -- forestalled a challenge to Hata at that time . Murayama ' s specific reference_to the New Party Harbinger suggested that the Socialists might back Takemura as Hata ' s successor . But he did not rule_out backing Hata . Liberal Democrats on Friday suggested that they would be willing to support Murayama as prime_minister , with their own leader , Yohei Kono , as vice premier in a coalition between the two parties that have been at each other ' s throats since 1955 , when both came_into existence . Whether the offer was sincere or merely an attempt to thwart the Socialists ' reunion with the coalition was unclear . No Socialist has been touted as a prime_minister since 1947 . Over the years , the party gradually has shed its Marxist ideology and advocacy of a socialist_economy . But it still maintains friendly relations with Communist North_Korea , advocates strong government subsidies for welfare and favors reducing defense spending . Its opposition to an opening of Japan ' s rice market and its refusal to support an increase in a 3 % consumption tax plagued Hosokawa during his eight months in office . Both the Socialists and the Liberal Democrats have condemned what they call &quot; arbitrary , high-handed &quot; decision-making by Ozawa . But they are united on few , if any , other policies . Takemura is an archenemy of Ozawa , Hata ' s strategist . While Ozawa supports Japan playing a larger role in international politics and U.N. peacekeeping efforts , Takemura advocates Japan assuming the posture of a &quot; small country that sparkles , &quot; shying_away_from both overseas military activities and a global leadership role</TEXT>
