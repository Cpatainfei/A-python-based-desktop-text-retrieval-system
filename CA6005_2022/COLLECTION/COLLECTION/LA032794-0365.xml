   <HEADLINE> ALASKA WAKE-UP CALL ?</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Regarding James L . Vermillion ' s letter on not boycotting the state of Alaska , but appealing_to the Alaskan Division of Tourism instead ( March 13 ) : I want to point_out how much more complex it is than that . I do understand how harsh a boycott could be_on the small businesses of Alaska , but at_the_same_time we desperately need all_of those Alaskan citizens to be very active in the preservation of their native plant and animal species , in this particular case , the wolf . Perhaps a boycott could be a &quot; wake-up &quot; call to these Alaskan citizens to take the_matter of the Alaskan ecological welfare into their own hands . ANDREA DAVIS Lomita</TEXT>
