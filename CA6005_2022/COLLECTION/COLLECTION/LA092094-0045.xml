   <HEADLINE> FINANCIAL MARKETS ; DOW MANAGES SMALL GAIN AS BULLS AND BEARS SLUG IT OUT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Wall_Street ' s bulls and bears dueled to a virtual draw Monday as stocks closed mixed and speculation continued about whether the Dow will reach the 4 # 000 plateau any time soon . The Dow Jones industrial average rose modestly to 3 # 936.72 , up 3.37 points , but other popular market measures lost ground . Losers outnumbered gainers about 5 to 4 on the New York Stock_Exchange . Stock trading settled_down to a more normal pace after Friday ' s hectic session when expirations of futures and options inflated volume to the sixth-highest total ever on the Big Board . Volume on the NYSE floor came_to 272.80 million Monday , compared to 410.69 million Friday . Stability in bonds failed to inspire much equity buying . The key 30-year Treasury_bond yield dipped to 7.75 % from 7.77 % late Friday . In currency markets , the Japanese yen gained broadly on expectations that U.S. trade data for July , due today , will show a widening of America ' s deficit with Japan . The imbalance , which reached nearly $ 60 billion last year , is largely responsible_for the U.S. currency ' s persistent weakness , supplying a steady stream of Japanese-held dollars that must be exchanged for yen . In late New York trading , the dollar was quoted at 98.53 yen , down from 98.93 late Friday . Analysts said events in Haiti are unlikely to develop_into a major concern on world markets , but they said there was relief that an 11th-hour agreement avoided a U.S.-led invasion . Mixed performances by foreign markets didn ' t offer a consistent course . Prices rose in London , ended flat in Paris and fell_in Frankfurt . In Tokyo , stocks sank to their lowest depths since April . Some U.S. analysts see 4 # 000 as an elusive level for the Dow . &quot; I think it ' s going_to be difficult for the Dow industrials to get_through 4 # 000 for the balance of this year , &quot; said Ricky Harrington , senior_vice_president and technical analyst at Interstate-Johnson Lane . &quot; The market ' s strength is very selective , confined to some tech stocks and big-cap blue chips. &quot; However , others see momentum . Jim Schroeder , market_analyst at MMS International , said the market might soon break_through the record mark , but it is unlikely to stay in uncharted territory for very long . Oil prices rose sharply Monday on an unconfirmed report of civil unrest in Saudi_Arabia , the world ' s largest oil exporter . October crude_oil jumped 38 cents to $ 17.21 a barrel . The report about protests and arrests in the northern Saudi city of Buraida came from a London-based group of ex-patriot clerics and professionals who favor stricter adherence to Islamic law . Among Monday ' s market highlights : * Time Warner jumped 1 3 / 8 to 37 5 / 8 . The media-entertainment company ' s stock attracted fresh attention after a published report in USA Today said General Electric , which is exploring the possibility of selling all or part of its NBC television division , is also considering an opposite strategy of buying_Time Warner . GE fell 1 / 2 to 50 1 / 2 . * Earnings helped some individual stocks .
