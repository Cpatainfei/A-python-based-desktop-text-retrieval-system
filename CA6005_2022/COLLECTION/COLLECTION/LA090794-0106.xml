   <HEADLINE> WINNERS OF $ 33-MILLION JACKPOT READY TO BLAZE SOME NEW TRAILS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It has become a cliche . Right after carrying_off the pot of gold at the end of the state Lotto rainbow , the new multimillionaires announce that they will hang_on to their humdrum jobs , maybe re-tile the bathroom and buy mom a swell present , but other_than that remain the same old plain-living folks they always were . None of that for James and Roberta Stevens of Newbury Park . Living_out the fantasies of millions of Lotto players statewide , the Stevenses -- whose $ 33.7-million jackpot is the third biggest one-player win in Lotto history -- picked_up a new Lincoln lickety-split . Then they marched into work_at Litton Industries in Woodland Hills on Tuesday and interrupted a senior management meeting to tell their bosses : Hasta la vista , baby . And apparently to avoid tipping_off any &quot; long-lost relatives &quot; or make new friends with worthy causes to support , they then clammed_up and refused to hold a news_conference . &quot; After winning such a large amount_of_money some people want a certain degree of privacy , &quot; explained lottery spokesman Bob Taylor . In a statement distributed by the lottery , James Stevens , 51 , who until Tuesday morning was a data processing manager at Litton , said : &quot; This is the greatest day of my life. &quot; The Stevenses will receive $ 1.68 million a year before taxes for 20 years . With withholding by the lottery administration of 28 % , their check will be $ 1 # 213 , 200 , and they will still owe the remainder of a probable federal tax_rate of 39 % . Lottery winnings are exempt from state income_taxes . Their first check is expected in about three weeks . According to Taylor , James Stevens usually played five sets of favorite numbers in each of the twice-weekly Super Lotto drawings . On Saturday , during a visit with their daughter and son-in-law in Palmdale , he bought an additional $ 10 of tickets , this time allowing the Lotto computer to pick the numbers at random . While visiting friends in Riverside on Sunday , Stevens checked the winning numbers in the newspaper and realized that he was holding the winning combination : 3 , 4 , 10 , 30 , 33 and 40 . &quot; I fell on the floor , &quot; Stevens said in the statement that lottery officials distributed . &quot; We were yelling and screaming , &quot; said Roberta Stevens , 57 , who until Tuesday was an accounting manager at Litton . When they got_back to their home_in Newbury Park , they placed the winning ticket in the refrigerator . &quot; I figured that if the house burned_down that would be the safest place , &quot; James Stevens said . By nightfall Monday , they had acquired a new Lincoln , James Stevens said , and they are looking_for a bigger motor_home than their current 27-footer , because now that they don ' t have to work they plan to do a lot of traveling with their winnings . &quot; We ' re going to enjoy life and help our children , &quot; he said . Together they have five children from previous marriages . The winning ticket was purchased at the Desert View Superette in Palmdale . Store owner Sam Hawara will receive a 0.5 % bonus for selling the winning ticket , $ 168 # 500 before taxes . &quot; I feel great , &quot; Hawara said in an interview Tuesday . &quot; I had never sold a winning jackpot ticket , but I was waiting. &quot; The Stevenses are the largest single winners in Ventura County , Taylor said . The previous high was a $ 17.1-million jackpot in February , 1990 . Among single winners statewide , the Stevenses place third behind a $ 51.6-million jackpot in June , 1994 , and a $ 43.3-million prize in December , 1990 .</TEXT>
