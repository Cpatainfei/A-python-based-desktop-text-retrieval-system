   <HEADLINE> ESTONIANS AND SWEDES MOURN VICTIMS OF FERRY DISASTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> People flocked to Estonia ' s churches Sunday to honor more_than 300 relatives , friends and compatriots killed in the worst maritime disaster in the small Baltic nation ' s history . At Tallinn ' s Karli Church , people sang , prayed and shed tears for those who went_down with the ill-fated ferry Estonia in the Baltic_Sea on Wednesday . &quot; There is no answer_for why this disaster has befallen us , &quot; Pastor Gustav Piir told the congregation , which was much larger than usual . &quot; It is now a heavy burden for this nation , &quot; Piir said , his voice booming across the high vaulted ceiling . &quot; We feel helpless in the face of something we cannot explain. &quot; In a country of just 1.6 million people , virtually everyone knew a victim -- or knew someone who did . It was as if 47 # 000 people in the United States had died in a single accident . Swedes also gathered_in churches Sunday to remember more_than 500 of their compatriots who died in the tragedy . King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia led an evening memorial service at Stockholm ' s Lutheran Cathedral . &quot; Many of us have lost a neighbor or a work colleague aboard the Estonia . Words have little comfort at a moment like this , &quot; Ingvar Carlsson , the newly elected prime_minister , told the congregants , who included several survivors . Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari attended a memorial service in Helsinki ' s Lutheran Cathedral , and the Finnish Red_Cross and the Lutheran_Church took_up collections for the Estonian victims of the disaster . At the port in Tallinn where the ship began its final voyage , only to sink hours later in rough seas , people placed flowers and candles by the departure gate . Black ribbons fluttered from the radio_antennas of many cars in the old , steepled capital . At a memorial concert in the Estonia Concert_Hall on Saturday , President Lennart Meri asked : &quot; Why do we have to drink this bitter glass of pain and suffering ? &quot; There is an answer to this eternal question , &quot; he said , choking_back tears . &quot; Through suffering a person gets stronger . A nation gets stronger. &quot; Mart Laar , prime_minister of the former Soviet republic , said that the sinking of the Estonia was the worst thing to happen to his country since Red Army troops invaded in 1944 . The biggest exodus of Estonians to the West occurred then , almost 50 years to the day before the ferry catastrophe . Scores of refugees went_down in stormy weather as Soviet gunboats pursued them . Many succumbed in the same area as the Estonia . &quot; History has come_back to us in a tragic form , &quot; Laar said .</TEXT>
