   <HEADLINE> WILL OUR NORTHERN NEIGHBOR DIVORCE ? ; CANADA : A VOTE ON SEPARATIST SENTIMENT IN QUEBEC MAY DASH THE COUNTRY ' S POTENTIAL AS AN EXEMPLAR OF MULTICULTURALISM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Canada ' s possible dissolution may be an innocuous event to many outsiders , but an immense tragedy to others more directly concerned . If English-speaking and French-speaking Canadians can ' t get_along , can anyone ? No wonder the Bosnians and Serbs are having at it . Quebecers will vote Monday in an election that will turn largely on the sentiment for or against independence . Both parties have deliberately sought to focus_on such immediate concerns as unemployment to garner the most votes during a summer campaign in which most Canadians would rather be tending barbecues than listening to politicians . Quebec ' s Liberal_Party government has stridently demanded more power for the province . The opposition Parti Quebecois is committed to outright secession , and is leading in the polls . Many predict a sweeping victory that will produce an overwhelming separatist majority in Quebec ' s Legislative_Assembly . Worse , English-speaking Canada ' s frustrated cries of &quot; What does Quebec want ? &quot; seem to have been replaced , by many , with an infuriated but stone cold_sober , &quot; Let the bastards go. &quot; And well they may have to . While the polls have shown a slight decline in the PQ ' s commanding lead , they have also revealed a hardening of support among its likely voters for an immediate , post-election &quot; declaration_of_independence &quot; by the new , PQ-dominated legislature . The results and the legality of such a move would be far from certain , but such an act would almost certainly spell the end of Canada as we know it . And , while the PQ and its counterpart in the federal Parliament , the Bloc Quebecois , are talking_of a peaceful secession accompanied by the continued use of Canada ' s currency , postal system and armed forces , many English speakers and their political_leaders will have no part of this self-serving scenario . In 1968 , Canadians had high hopes . The governing Liberals had just chosen Pierre Trudeau , a dashing intellectual , to be prime_minister . He had campaigned by speaking_of a multinational state -- in Canada , that ' s the two &quot; founding nations , &quot; English and French -- and the need to tear_down walls between all cultures , races and nations . But the honeymoon soon ended . In 1970 , Trudeau invoked Canada ' s equivalent of martial_law following separatist bombings , kidnapings and murders in Quebec . Quebec elected its first separatist , Parti Quebecois government a_few years later . It lost a referendum on independence , but the caldron of anger , insults and resentment continued to boil . One round of negotiations aimed at placating Quebec followed another . Then , in 1992 , Canadians dealt a stunning -- and unexpected -- defeat to a referendum proposing constitutional amendments that would have guaranteed Quebec a place in the confederation . The headlines in Canada these days are not about whether Quebec will &quot; separate , &quot; but what its borders will be . While the United States may soon have to contend with a quasi-socialist neighbor on its north -- one that supplies much of New York City ' s electricity -- Canadians have other concerns . Will an independent Quebec grab the parts of Labrador that it once owned and has long since craved ? And what of the French-speaking suburbs of Ottawa , the seat of the governments that have poured billions into Quebec to secure its loyalty ? And what of Quebec ' s tens of thousands of indigenous people , citizens of Canada bound to -- and protected by -- the federal_government ? And then , no one is sure that the remaining provinces can -- or will -- hang_together . Canada ' s prosperous but underpopulated West seethes with resentment against the powerful East ; with Quebec ' s third of the seats in Parliament gone , would the West stand_for a new Parliament dominated by politicians from Toronto ? Finally , there ' s the specter of troops . Prime_Minister Jean Chretien could well send Canadian troops into Quebec to protect federal property or to make_sure that Quebec agrees to pay its sizable share of the astronomical national_debt . But the most prominent separatist , Lucien Bouchard , and his Bloc Quebecois constitute Chretien ' s official opposition in Parliament . Furious English-speakers have questioned whether the bloc ' s status is treasonable since it is committed to the country ' s destruction . Their anger has escalated as Bouchard traipses around the world , in his capacity as leader of the opposition and at the taxpayers ' expense , assuring foreign leaders that Canada ' s passing will be peaceful and mutual . If ever a country had potential , it ' s Canada , which the United Nations just rated as having the world ' s best quality_of_life . ( The United States barely made_it into the top 10. ) Canada has never had to bear the military or economic burdens of a superpower . It could have shown the world how two different peoples -- who once had as much in common as not -- could share a single state . In doing so , Canada could have been great . Instead , it has shown the world only how best to squander its great promise .</TEXT>
