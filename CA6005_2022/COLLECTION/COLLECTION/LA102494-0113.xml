   <HEADLINE> PROS SAY MANY NASDAQ TRADES REPORTED LATE ; SECURITIES : THE PRACTICE , A BLATANT VIOLATION OF RULES , CAN MEAN ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION . NASD SAYS IT WILL NOT TOLERATE PURPOSELY INACCURATE REPORTING .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Within minutes after the end of the trading day on Nasdaq , a peculiar thing happens . Large trades -- sometimes the biggest of the day for certain stocks -- are suddenly reported on Nasdaq ' s &quot; tape , &quot; the public running list of trades . They have an &quot; s &quot; next to them , indicating that they are being reported late . Nasdaq rules strictly require that trades be reported within 90 seconds after they ' ve been executed . The only permitted excuses for not doing so are if a trading ticket was accidentally lost or if a dealer had a computer glitch . But several prominent traders for pension and mutual_funds -- speaking out on the topic for the first time -- contend that Nasdaq market makers deliberately hold trades off the tape in what often amounts to illegal manipulation of the market . Deliberate late or false reporting , known in Wall_Street lingo as &quot; painting the tape , &quot; is one of the most blatant possible violations of Nasdaq rules . But these pension and mutual_fund traders say Nasdaq is doing little to stop the practice . And some senior officials of the National Assn . of Securities Dealers , which owns and operates Nasdaq , concur . Officially , the NASD says it will not tolerate purposely inaccurate reporting . &quot; I have no interest in having games played_on tape reporting on Nasdaq , &quot; says Richard G . Ketchum , NASD chief operating officer . Nevertheless , the NASD says it has taken no disciplinary action for late reporting this year . Harold S . Bradley , director of trading for the $ 27-billion Twentieth Century Group of mutual_funds , said deliberate delays in reporting trades , especially large trades , occur &quot; very frequently. &quot; At least 10 times in the past year , Bradley said , he has experienced market makers delaying the reporting of his trades on the public tape by as much as several hours . &quot; Any afternoon , &quot; he added , &quot; I can run_through any 10 stocks ( on Nasdaq ) and they will have ( late-reported ) sales go_up after the bell. &quot; Holly A . Stark , senior_vice_president in_charge of trading at New York-based Dalton , Greiner , Hartman , Maher &amp; Co. , a firm that manages more_than $ 3 billion for pension_funds and foundations , also says the practice is pervasive . Stark said she was disturbed to see market makers delaying reports of trades she had ordered &quot; close to a dozen times &quot; this year . At the heart of the problem is the fact that large trades , once reported , tend to make a stock ' s price move . Report of a big purchase -- or even a relatively small one in a thinly traded stock -- can make the price jump , because other market makers and public investors may think there is a sudden demand for the shares . A big sale can drive the price down . Dealers may have several motives for reporting a trade late . If a dealer has just bought a large amount of stock , for example , he may_not want competing dealers to know about the volume of shares he has added_to his inventory ; if they knew , he might not get as good a price for the stock when he goes_to resell it . Alternatively , a market maker seeking to buy 50 # 000 shares of a stock for a customer might make several separate purchases along the way to complete the order . Instead of reporting each purchase as it occurs , as Nasdaq rules require , the dealer might lump them all together and report them at the end of the day as a single 50 # 000-share trade . By keeping the individual purchases secret , the market maker will have avoided driving_up the price of the stock before completing the order . ( Indeed , some traders say , institutional investors sometimes ask market makers to improperly delay reporting trades made on their behalf. ) For individual investors , the direct effect is that they end_up paying too_much to buy or receiving too_little when they sell , says Junius W . Peake , a University of Northern Colorado finance professor who was once vice_chairman of the NASD ' s board of governors . An investor buying just after a big unreported sale , for example , may see the price of the shares drop when the trade is reported minutes or hours later . Inaccurate reporting of this sort is extremely rare on the New York Stock_Exchange , veteran traders say -- in part because computers on the NYSE floor report trades automatically . Some senior NASD officials acknowledge that deliberately late reporting of trades happens frequently on Nasdaq . William R . Rothe , a member of the NASD board of governors , said he does not dispute that such improper activity &quot; does occur &quot; -- although he says it is strictly forbidden at his firm , Baltimore-based Alex . Brown &amp; Sons , where he is head of over-the-counter trading . Rothe said there are often legitimate reasons for reporting a series of trades late early in the trading day , when a mass of orders that piled_up just before the opening may make timely reporting impossible . But he said he knows of no legitimate reason why there would be clusters of big trades reported late just after the close at 4 p.m. Eastern time . Rothe said the NASD has long been aware of complaints about late reporting . &quot; Clearly the large trades that are reported after the close of the market as ' sold ' ( market jargon for trades reported late ) is something that both the institutions and the other market participants are not happy with , &quot; he said . The NASD says it routinely looks_for evidence of late reporting when it conducts its regular examinations of market makers . However , when asked why many big trades are reported just after the close , Ketchum declined through a spokesman to respond . The pervasiveness of late reporting on Nasdaq is often most evident in the trading of smaller stocks . A random look_at relatively thinly traded stocks on two recent trading days turned_up these examples , among others : * On Oct . 14 , seven of the 17 trades during market hours in Medisense Inc. , a Waltham , Mass. , maker of home testing kits for diabetics , were reported late . * Also that day , 18 trades , representing 19 % of the trading volume in shares of New York-based Winstar Communications Inc. -- some 152 # 700 shares -- were reported late . * On Oct . 10 , just two minutes after the close , a 15 # 000-share trade was reported late in the stock of Molex Inc. -- much larger than any of the 28 trades that had been reported during the regular trading day . * The same day , a 30 # 000-share trade_in the stock of Intergraph Corp . was reported late , just after the close . That one trade represented 13 % of the day ' s trading volume in Intergraph . Spokesman James D . Spellman said the NASD would not respond to requests for information or comment about the incidents of late reporting . But he said the NASD plans to look_into the incidents . John Chiricotti , Medisense chief financial_officer , said he knew of no reason why so many trades were reported late in his firm ' s stock on Oct . 14 . Nasdaq &quot; doesn ' t tell you anything about what ' s going_on in the trading , &quot; he said . Clusters of big late trades , especially ones reported just after the close , are quite common for big Nasdaq stocks as well . Printouts of &quot; time and sales &quot; reports for one afternoon -- Oct . 14 -- show nine trades reported late in the six minutes after the market ' s close_in shares of Microsoft Corp. , the biggest company listed on Nasdaq . These included two very big trades , of 50 # 000 shares each ; the others were from 1 # 000 to 7 # 000 shares . Lotus Development had 13 trades reported late just after the close that day , including one for 25 # 000 shares ; MCI Communications had six reported just after the close . Apple Computer that day had only four late-reported trades , totaling 9 # 100 shares . But on Oct . 10 , a very heavy trading day for the stock , Apple had 12 trades reported late just after the close , including one for 25 # 000 shares and another for 20 # 000 . Microsoft Treasurer Gregory B . Maffei said he was not aware of any irregularities in trade reporting in the company ' s stock but said the firm would look_into reports of delays in posting trades . &quot; Obviously , if there are improprieties , it ' s a matter that concerns us , &quot; Maffei said . But Rebecca Seel , a spokeswoman for Lotus , said , &quot; I think the point is that Nasdaq has its own surveillance_systems , and the onus is really on them to track this kind of stuff. &quot; Apple spokeswoman Betty Taylor declined comment . Although the Securities and Exchange Commission says timely trade reporting is one of the most important elements of a fair , competitive securities market , it has done little to monitor reporting practices on Nasdaq . Two years ago , the New York Stock_Exchange , Nasdaq ' s chief rival , formally urged the SEC to look_into Nasdaq ' s trade reporting practices . But Mark D . Fitterman , the SEC ' s associate director of market regulation , confirmed that it never did so . &quot; We ' ve never seen a systemic problem with_respect_to the timeliness or accurateness of trade reporting , &quot; Fitterman said . The NASD has the power to impose large fines and suspend market makers who break the trade reporting rules . Indeed , if it can be proved that the actions were part of a deliberate plan to affect a stock ' s price , market manipulation can be prosecuted criminally . However , James M . Cangiano , the NASD senior_vice_president for market surveillance , said the organization has taken no disciplinary action this year for late reporting . Cangiano also said he could not provide figures on the percentage of Nasdaq volume reported late so far this year . After receiving requests for the data from The Times two weeks ago , he said he had his staff instead calculate late reports for a period in mid-August . During that period , Cangiano said , less than 5 % of the volume was reported late . Twentieth Century ' s Bradley said he has never gotten responses from the NASD when he has called to complain about late reporting of_his_own trades . &quot; It ' s very frustrating , &quot; he said . &quot; They ' ve never gotten_back to me. &quot; Cangiano responds that although the NASD may have owed Bradley &quot; a courtesy call , &quot; it is not obliged to disclose the results of its confidential investigations . In any event , he said , such cases are difficult to investigate . If the NASD calls a market maker who reported a large trade late &quot; and he says , ' Oh , well , I turned_on my fan and my order ticket fell on the floor , and I only found it at 4:05 , ' how do you prove that this was done willfully ? &quot; Cangiano said . * Series Reprints : A compilation of this six-part series on Nasdaq will be available from Times on Demand upon completion of the series ' publication next week .

A Pattern of Late Reporting A computer record of Nasdaq trading in shares of Microsoft Inc. on Oct . 14 shows that market makers reported nine trades out of sequence -- including two big ones for 50 # 000 shares each -- after the close of trading at 4 p.m. EDT ( 16:00 on the computer ' s big trades being reported just after the close suggests an attempt by market makers to manipulate the market .
