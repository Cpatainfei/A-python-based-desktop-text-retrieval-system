   <HEADLINE> DESPITE DIP IN VALLEY CRIME , TRAGEDIES TAKE THEIR TOLL</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Although statistically the San Fernando Valley was a safer place this year , there was no shortage of tragedy . Adding_to fears , the year began and ended with the killings of peace_officers , the very professionals on whom residents depend to keep their communities safe . In February , a rookie officer with the Los Angeles Police_Department was gunned_down outside a Northridge house by a teen-ager who also killed his father before killing himself . And this month , a fatal gun battle erupted between a robber and a Los Angeles County Safety Police_officer in the parking_lot of a Canoga Park shoe_store . Yet despite a number of high-profile crimes , 1994 statistics through Nov . 30 -- the latest available -- show that homicides fell 44 % from the same period last year , from 129 to 72 . In fact , more people were killed in car accidents in the Valley than were slain . Rapes , robberies , aggravated assaults and all property crimes except auto burglaries also fell . The Los Angeles Police_Department attributes this year ' s drop_in violent crime to the Northridge earthquake , a gang truce and the impact of community-based policing . It also happens to follow a nationwide trend . But despite the reductions in overall crime , the public ' s perception of violence has grown , in large part due_to the random nature of many high-profile crimes and because many feel their middle-class Valley neighborhoods are no longer immune . For Kenneth Brondell , a retired LAPD detective who has lived_in the Valley for nearly four decades , 1994 was the year that random violence struck_home . &quot; It used to be there weren ' t as_many guns , and people just weren ' t as violent , &quot; said Brondell , the father of slain LAPD Officer Christy Lynne Hamilton , who died in the line_of_duty this year . &quot; But nowadays , if you just happen to be walking down the street , driving your car or shopping at a mall , you become a victim. &quot; The slaying of Hamilton , a 45-year-old LAPD rookie , was one of the year ' s first murders . A bullet tore through an opening in Hamilton ' s bulletproof_vest and into her chest as she responded to a report of gunshots at the Northridge home of 17-year-old Christopher Golly . Hamilton became a victim of Golly ' s plans to kill his father , 49-year-old Steven Golly , then ambush police_officers responding to the crime , police said . Christopher Golly carried_out his fantasy on Feb . 22 , gunning_down his father and shooting at three patrol_cars with a military-style semiautomatic rifle . The gunfire struck Hamilton , who became only the second female LAPD officer to die in the line_of_duty . The troubled youth , whom friends described as a drug_user , added a twist to his plan by killing himself . Compared to last year , robberies fell 17.1 % , rapes dropped 14.3 % , followed by a slight decrease in aggravated assaults , according to LAPD statistics through November . All property crimes , with the exception of auto burglaries , also dropped this year , including a 16.2 % decline in auto thefts and a 9.3 % decrease in burglaries . In April , LAPD officials gave residents a rare glimpse into some of the worst pockets of vice and violence in the Valley , releasing detailed reports on high-crime areas . Many of the crime zones were close to Sepulveda and Van Nuys boulevards , which have long been known as magnets for prostitution and drug_traffic . Much of the violence was blamed on spreading gang activity , increased drug use and a growing pool of new victims -- illegal immigrants . As a result , the LAPD ' s five Valley divisions began for the first time to systematically track criminals and crime trends by computer . The high-tech help comes at an important juncture for the San Fernando Valley , where no neighborhood seemed safe this year : * In August , three decomposed bodies were discovered sealed inside steamer trunks in a Northridge storage facility . This week , police identified the victims as Eri Tri Darmawan , Gina Sutan Aswar and Surish Michandani , each of whom had been beaten . Police have issued an arrest_warrant for 30-year-old Harnoko Dewantono from Indonesia , suspected of committing the murders . * In October , a gunman fatally shot Reuben Ortiz , 36 , at a weekend softball_game in Van Nuys . Ortiz and three other people had gone_in search of a man who moments earlier had threatened to kill a group of their friends and family members inside a Van Nuys-Sherman Oaks Park restroom . After spotting the man at a bus_stop , Ortiz approached him armed with a baseball_bat . The man fired a gun , killing Ortiz and wounding Andrew Reyes , 37 . * A house fire led police to the discovery in October of Berneda McMackin , 77 , who had been beaten and stabbed inside her Van Nuys home . Her assailant apparently set the house on_fire to hide the crime . A few days later and a_few miles away , 72-year-old Aliza Levi died in a similar fashion after startling a burglar . * Earlier this month , Thaddeus Jackson , a popular North Hollywood middle-school teacher , was charged with murder in connection with the beating death of a man who accidentally drove into a parked truck outside Jackson ' s Reseda apartment . Jackson was one of six men charged with using pool_cues , chunks of wood and their fists and feet to beat Julio Aguilar , 23 , to death and injure his brother , Jose Aguilar , 21 . This year , violence also broke_out at Universal CityWalk , where eight people were arrested after authorities used pepper spray to break_up a melee between rival gang members who fought with fists and chairs . Celebrities even joined the fray . Oscar-winning actor Jack Nicholson was charged in February with misdemeanor vandalism and assault for allegedly using a golf_club to smash the windshield of a Mercedes-Benz during a traffic dispute in North Hollywood , according to city prosecutors . The charges were later dropped . Actor James Caan , famous for his role as a hotheaded gangster in &quot; The Godfather , &quot; was released on_his_own recognizance in March after being arrested because a rap musician accused him of pulling a gun during an argument , police said . No charges were filed . It was also a year of new crime trends . Thieves sought to get rich by stealing car air_bags , cloning cellular_telephones and hunting Valley residents with Rolex watches . During the last two weeks , LAPD officials have reported as_many as a dozen follow-home robberies . Thieves have targeted diners and holiday shoppers and followed them to their homes , where they have been robbed at gunpoint of their purses , gifts and jewelry . Other criminals chose simpler ways to make a quick buck this year . In October , police arrested Richard Siddons , 33 , of Tarzana , on suspicion of rigging his bicycle to fall_apart upon impact in a series of staged accidents . Motorists began phoning in complaints to police that they had been involved in traffic accidents with a bicyclist who asked_for money following the crashes . Siddons was convicted and sentenced to a year in jail after pleading no contest to theft charges . Meanwhile , lawmakers cracked_down on criminals with tough new methods . In August , Robert E . Hardy , a 29-year-old burglar with two prior convictions , became the first_person in the San Fernando Valley to be convicted and sentenced to life in prison under the new &quot; three strikes &quot; law . And just as it began , the year ended with the killing of a peace_officer . Thomas Worley was sitting inside his car_parked outside a Canoga Park strip mall waiting for his wife to pick_out a pair of shoes . Minutes later , he became the 11th peace_officer to be gunned_down in Southern California during the last 18 months . &quot; He gave his life , &quot; said Clifton Williams , president of the 400-member Los Angeles County Safety Police Assn . &quot; Sometimes we don ' t know why the world is like it is. &quot; ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) Traffic Toll It was a bloody year on the streets of the San Fernando Valley , where more people died in traffic accidents than were slain . Traffic accidents in the Valley claimed the lives of 84 people from January through November , a 9 % increase over the same period in 1993 . Following are additional Valley traffic statistics for the first 11 months of the year : * Driving under the influence of alcohol arrests : 4 # 285 * Traffic collisions : 15 # 555 . Of those , 1 # 113 were alcohol-related * Moving-traffic citations issued : 108 # 831 Source : LAPD traffic analysis unit of the Traffic Coordination Section .</TEXT>
