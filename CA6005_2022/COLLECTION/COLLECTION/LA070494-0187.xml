   <HEADLINE> THE PACIFIC ; WITH HIGH HOPES , SOUTH_KOREANS STEP UP PLANS FOR TRADE WITH THE NORTH ; ASIA : GOVERNMENT AND BUSINESS_LEADERS WANT JULY 25-27 SUMMIT TO DEFUSE MILITARY CRISIS , IMPROVE COMMERCIAL TIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While there ' s no such thing as a sure bet when it comes_to dealings with Pyongyang , the apparent breakthrough in the military crisis on the Korean_peninsula has companies south of the demilitarized zone thinking , however tentatively , about the pool of cheap labor on the other side . Indeed , the South_Korean government and businesses are now stepping_up plans for economic exchanges with North_Korea . Their hope is that the historic summit July 25-27 between the North ' s President Kim Il Sung and South_Korean President Kim Young Sam will defuse the military confrontation on the peninsula and improve trade ties . This will be a very tall_order , given the fact that Pyongyang has enough firepower trained on Seoul to turn the South_Korean capital into rubble . Still , Seoul is dangling some big incentives to persuade Kim to play ball with United Nations inspectors , who want to make_sure North_Korea isn ' t developing nuclear_weapons . The Seoul government said late last week that it will increase its South-North ( Korean ) Cooperation Fund , designed to help expand inter-Korean cooperation and exchanges , by $ 50 million to $ 181 million during this year and to $ 1.25 billion at some point in the future . What ' s more , South_Korean companies are also casting a covetous gaze at the North ' s low-wage work_force . &quot; We are dusting off the old business plans in the North , which have waited for a breakthrough in inter-Korean relations , &quot; said Kim Sang Nyun , a spokesman for the Hyundai conglomerate . For its part , Seoul said it will use part of its Economic Development and Cooperation Fund , another government-raised fund designed to help developing nations , for the revitalization of North_Korea ' s economy , which has contracted for four consecutive years . An official at the Economic Planning_Board said efforts will be made to implement a historic peace_treaty between the two Koreas , adopted in 1992 , if and when the summit helps clear suspicions about the North ' s nuclear program . &quot; Time is now ripe for the two economies to join hands for co-prosperity , &quot; the official said . Businesses in the capitalist South are also reactivating their old plans for business in the communist North , which were formed a_few years ago when the two states were moving toward reconciliation , but then shelved when suspicions about Pyongyang ' s nuclear ambitions started to grow . Daewoo Group Chairman Kim Woo Choong and Hyundai Group founder Chung Ju Yung visited North_Korea a_few years back and agreed to build joint_venture factories and large resort facilities there . But the plans are being held_up until a resolution of the nuclear issue can be reached . The Seoul government also bans visits by South_Koreans to North_Korea and allows only limited commercial trade through third countries . Yet if the current thaw holds , that could change . A spokesman for the Daewoo conglomerate said its chairman Kim will quickly visit the North again to pursue the delayed projects if the summit helps resolve the nuclear problem . The recent impasse may have been busted_up by the recent visit to Pyongyang by former President Jimmy_Carter . Many South_Koreans hope the summit provides needed momentum for inter-Korean economic relations . During the first five months of this year , two-way trade remained low at $ 80 million . Yet the prospects for inter-Korean economic cooperation are good . Many analysts see a combination of South_Korea ' s capital and technology with North_Korea ' s cheap labor as ideal . Suffering from serious shortages of foods , fuel , daily necessities and hard currencies , the North hopes to build a huge free_trade zone along the Tumen River bordering with Russia and China , by attracting the capital of the West . The Seoul government has promised full support to the Tumen River development project , sponsored by the United Nations Development Program . While all_of this is promising , South_Korean companies had better be patient . Given Pyongyang ' s track record for following_through on commitments to make its nuclear_energy program more transparent , dreams of economic unification are probably just that -- dreams .</TEXT>
