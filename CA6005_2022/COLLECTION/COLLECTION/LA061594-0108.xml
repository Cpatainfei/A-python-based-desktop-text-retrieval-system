   <HEADLINE> THE TIMES POLL ; FAMILY TIES PULL NEW WAVE OF EMIGRES FROM VIETNAM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> On a summer day in 1990 , then 26-year-old Hao Thi Tran , her mother and two sisters were_on a plane about to land at Los Angeles International Airport . The four women had changed into ao dais , the traditional Vietnamese dresses that are worn over flowing pants . They were anxious to be reunited with family members they had not seen in 10 years . &quot; We stepped off the plane , and they recognized us first , &quot; said Tran , the youngest of nine children . &quot; I heard someone shrieking and then they ran forward to hug us . There was so_much crying and laughing. &quot; Tran was running to the United States to be with her family , instead of running_away from political persecution , as refugees first did after Saigon fell to Communist troops in 1975 . She is part of a new_wave of Vietnamese immigrants , who are mostly single , young_women rejoining their families under the terms of agreements between Washington and Hanoi . In a Times Poll of Vietnamese residents in Southern California , 42 % of new emigres gave family reasons for emigrating and 32 % cited political ones . This is a reversal of earlier trends , when the majority of refugees left Vietnam to escape oppression . Recent immigrants -- those who have arrived in the past five years -- make_up about a third of the 861 Vietnamese adults interviewed by phone from March 28 through April 19 . The poll has a sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage_points . They are a group who are largely satisfied with what they have found in the United States . Tran , who has gotten_over the trying years of adapting to a new life in a different country and culture , is now a job counselor for other Vietnamese immigrants at the Westminster office of the Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc. &quot; Mom wanted to come_over to reunite with my older brothers and sisters , &quot; who had escaped in 1980 by boat , Tran said . &quot; I missed them , too , because we hadn ' t seen each other for 10 years . &quot; But I also knew that my life would improve in the United States , &quot; she added . &quot; And now with this job , it ' s satisfying to help people who just came_over . I know what it ' s like. &quot; * Like Tran , most other newcomers are blue-collar workers or homemakers , are unmarried and have household incomes of less than $ 20 # 000 a year . About half are adults younger than 30 and a majority of them are female . The high number of women is a new trend . Previously , there were so few that Vietnamese men roamed from state to state looking_for Vietnamese mates . &quot; The guys used to complain it was hard to find a Vietnamese wife here , &quot; said Loc Nguyen , a coordinator at Tran ' s refugee agency , who estimated that three-quarters of the refugees used to be men . According to the Immigration and Naturalization Service , women made_up 52 % of the 77 # 735 Vietnamese people who entered the United States two years ago . During the 1970s and 1980s , fewer Vietnamese girls and women fled their homeland because most escapees had to endure nightmarish trips on flimsy boats in their quest_for freedom , said Hoang Tieu , director of employee services for Catholic Charities of Orange County . At the time , few people had relatives abroad to sponsor them over . &quot; They were afraid of being robbed or raped &quot; by pirates , he said . &quot; Now more women come because most already have families living here , ( and ) now they can fly &quot; on commercial airline flights . A series of government programs have been reuniting families . In 1979 , Washington and Hanoi agreed to let residents of Vietnam reunite with immediate family members in the United States under the Orderly Departure Program . Eight years later , the Amerasian Homecoming Act admitted Vietnamese children of American soldiers . And in 1990 , the Humanitarian Operation agreement allowed former Vietnamese prisoners of re-education camps to emigrate . Most of the third group had been military officials in the old_South Vietnamese republic . Van Nguyen , 25 , of Reseda came_in 1992 under the Amerasian program with her mother , husband and her then-2-year-old daughter . &quot; Of course I miss Vietnam a lot , because it ' s my native_land . But I would never go_back there to live , &quot; she said . &quot; There , they didn ' t let Amerasians go_to school . Here I can get an education. &quot; According to the Times Poll , a large_number of the new arrivals are doing just that . They are either working toward degrees or studying English , which they consider an essential ingredient for success . On the advice of veteran immigrants already living_in the United States , some had even tried to learn their new homeland ' s language before coming_over . Because the latest emigres had relatives and friends who wrote to Vietnam telling them what to expect , they tended to be more prepared , social_workers said . &quot; The earlier wave , all_of a sudden , bam ! They had to run from the Communists , &quot; said Tieu of Catholic Charities . &quot; The newer_waves knew they had to come here and work , or go_to school . Many tried to learn English before leaving Vietnam. &quot; But preparation does little good for one category of Vietnamese immigrants : the former detainees of Communist prisons . &quot; Most are at least 50 , had suffered from years of malnutrition and slave labor , &quot; Tieu said . &quot; They are thin and look sickly . Who wants to hire them ? Emotionally , they feel washed-up . Seeing others who had come_before leading successful lives , with_children graduated with good degrees , these men feel they and their families have lost too much. &quot; Thang Dao , 56 , was imprisoned from 1975 to 1981 in a labor camp , because he had been a military_officer for the defeated side . He , his wife and 7-year-old daughter immigrated to Garden Grove two years ago . He cannot find work , he said , because of constant headaches and fatigue -- legacies from past hunger , forced labor and beatings in the re-education camps . &quot; Fitting_in is best for the young who can more easily find work , &quot; Dao said . &quot; It has not been easy for me . If you don ' t have a job , you can ' t fit_in because you ' re left_out of society ' s cycle . It ' s frustrating. &quot; Social_workers say it ' s easier to find employment for women -- mostly as seamstresses -- and men younger than their mid-50s -- as assembly workers or security_guards . * An unusual solution to the lack of work in Southern California materialized last fall : jobs in meat-processing plants in Iowa , Michigan and Nebraska . The packing houses are hiring , pay $ 6.50 an hour for entry levels , and do not require English-language skills . Catholic Charities , in conjunction with the Vietnamese Community of Orange County Inc. , has sent more_than 200 willing Vietnamese emigres to the Midwest , though the winters there are harsh for people used to tropical heat . &quot; Those companies have even hired whole families . The old , weak fathers or the women can do light work like sorting fat from the meat , not heavy chopping , &quot; Tieu said . &quot; Most of the time , they send a son first to scout out the situation . Good jobs , cheaper housing than here , so clients are willing to put_up with the cold_weather for the chance to be self-supporting . We tell them they have to be realistic and they listen to us. &quot; Social_workers often stress to new immigrants that they must face reality . &quot; I tell them the important thing after coming here is to not expect so_much , &quot; job counselor Tran said . &quot; Don ' t think this is paradise and that everything is easy. &quot; Another tip for newcomers is to not compare themselves with longtime Vietnamese residents , who have had a head_start of nearly 19 years , she said . &quot; I tell them that in the beginning , everyone is discouraged , &quot; Tran said . &quot; Other people have homes and cars , you don ' t . I say things will be normal for you , too , once you get a job . Be patient. &quot; As for the old-timers , more view newcomers in a positive light rather than in a negative one . Almost a third of the survey ' s respondents said the recent immigrants contribute to the Vietnamese community , while 20 % said they were a burden . Dao , the former detainee of Communist camps , encourages Vietnamese friends and relatives to come live here , despite the struggles . &quot; I have many friends ( in Vietnam ) who write and ask me if they should come_over , too , &quot; he said . &quot; I write plainly that if they think_of their children ' s future , and if they want to get_away from communism , then they should accept the hardships and come. &quot; * But if communism ceases to exist in Vietnam and democracy flourishes , almost a third of new arrivals in the poll said they would return to their birthplace to live , even though three-fourths of the poll respondents said they had a favorable view of the American way_of_life . So would a similar proportion of those who have lived here for years . Bau Nguyen , 33 , who has been here for 15 years , said he would rather reside in a free Vietnam than here . The United States &quot; may be very civilized , and equality may be ( the rule ) , but there are many crazy things that can happen , too , &quot; the Garden Grove machinist said . &quot; Life here has a lot of things to seduce people to extremes. &quot; Nguyen complained of clothing that is both expensive and revealing , and the seemingly rampant violence in the streets . &quot; There ' s too_much freedom for guns and bullets , &quot; he added . &quot; I don ' t want to have to worry about violence , but I do . If someone suggests a walk on the beach , I don ' t feel comfortable with the idea . There could be a racist out there who might attack you. &quot; Though Nguyen expressed wariness about prejudice , he said he has not experienced it face to face . In the poll , one out of every 11 Vietnamese said they had been the victims of discrimination . Tran , the job counselor , counts herself among the few . It happened in 1991 , when she was working_at the Community Development Council in Costa Mesa , where she helped low-income people pay bills . &quot; I loved my job there , and it helped me to learn English . My supervisors were so nice to me and I was feeling good because I was helping people , &quot; she recounted . &quot; Then this elderly white_woman came_in one day , took one look_at me and refused to be helped by me . &quot; I was so upset , &quot; Tran said . &quot; I couldn ' t work for the rest of the day . That was the first and only time I felt maybe I shouldn ' t be here. &quot; There have been no repeat instances since then , and she does not count herself among those who want to return to Vietnam to live -- no matter what regime is in place . &quot; People are so poor there , especially if there ' s no support from relatives here , &quot; Tran said . &quot; The country still lacks amenities that I ' ve become used to . Vietnam is polluted , with too_much traffic . Maybe when I ' m old and ready to retire , that ' s where I ' ll go. &quot; * That sentiment is shared by nearly half of those 50 and older , who want to spend their last_days where they were born . The young find it less appealing ; only 27 % wanted to return to their native_land to live . Nguyen , the machinist , said he recognizes there are drawbacks to Vietnam , but its slower pace allows people to enjoy life more . &quot; Here you ' re in debt all_the time , no matter if you ' re a doctor making lots of money , &quot; he said . &quot; You owe people for everything you own . And your work is not necessarily secure . You can lose your job after 10 years , that ' s normal . In Vietnam , one working person can support a family of 10 . You can ' t do that here . There , homes are cheaper and easier to buy . In general , life is just easier , more relaxing. &quot; He also would rather see his 7-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son grow_up in the land of their ancestors . &quot; They won ' t be as easily spoiled by society . Fashions and trends are slower to catch_on there . They won ' t have to become so sophisticated so fast as Western children do , &quot; Nguyen said . In contrast , Tran , the single job counselor , can only see raising future children in her new homeland . &quot; Life is fair here , &quot; she said . &quot; You work hard , you enjoy the results of your hard work . When I lived_in Vietnam , my salary as a teacher was $ 6 a month . I didn ' t dare dream of having a family . &quot; Now , I can , &quot; Tran said with a smile . Los Angeles Times Poll : New Arrivals Have Different Agenda The latest arrivals among Vietnamese immigrants to Southern California are coming for different reasons than their predecessors , and tend to be even more optimistic about their new lives than the first wave of refugees that came here almost two decades ago . &quot; What was the main reason you came_to live_in the United States ? &quot; 04 # 35 , 12 # 12 , 12 * 3 * Became permanent U.S. resident 1967-78 1979-81 Since ' 89 Political oppression in Vietnam 65 % 69 % 32 % Wanted to be reunited with family 20 12 42 Economic opportunities 7 8 11 Educational opportunities 4 5 8 Note : Totals add_to less than 100 % because not all categories are shown &quot; By what means did you leave Vietnam ?

The questions were developed in consultation with Duong Pham , a visiting lecturer at UC Irvine and UCLA , and Khao Luu , president of the Assn . of Former Vietnamese Educators Overseas . The interviewing was conducted in Vietnamese and English by Vietnamese American interviewers at Interviewing Services of America Inc. of Van Nuys . A list of Vietnamese surnames was used to draw the samples from phone directories in the six counties . Results were adjusted slightly so that the sample conforms with census information about sex , age and education . Vietnamese residents of Orange County were oversampled and a total of 502 interviews were conducted there ; 359 were conducted in the other five counties . Where Southern California results are cited , the Orange County sample is weighted to its proper proportion in the sample . The margin of sampling error for the entire sample is plus or minus 4 percentage_points . For the Orange County sample , the error is plus or minus 5 percentage_points and for the rest of the region it is plus or minus 7 points . The sampling error for other subgroups may vary . In addition to sampling error , poll results can be affected by other factors such_as question wording and the order in which questions are presented . Additionally , surname samples of this type do not allow_for the sampling of people with unlisted telephone_numbers and Vietnamese residents who do not have Vietnamese surnames .</TEXT>
