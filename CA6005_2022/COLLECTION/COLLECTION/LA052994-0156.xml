   <HEADLINE> COLUMN RIGHT / ALAN CHARLES RAUL : ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION , NOT STUPIDITY ; TOO-STRICT STANDARDS WASTE TAX MONEY NEEDED ELSEWHERE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Environmentalism isn ' t what it used to be . An awareness is building that not every program identifying itself as &quot; good &quot; for the environment delivers real value to society . Many voices are now being raised in favor of more common_sense and realism in allocating the burdens and benefits of environmental protection . So the opponents of environmental legislation have become the environmentalists themselves . The reauthorization of environmental statutes is being stalled on Pennsylvania Avenue not by conservatives , but by liberals . Their fear is that the Zeitgeist no longer favors unqualified environmentalism . The environmentalist imperative to preserve the status_quo is_best evidenced by their campaign to kill congressional reform of the Superfund law . Likewise , Congress has been stymied in reauthorizing the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Endangered Species Act . Even the bill to give the EPA Cabinet-level status was stopped in its tracks by the environmental side of the aisle . The tension between balanced and absolute environmentalism has hit a social nerve because a particular form of conservation -- the need to save money -- has become so urgent . It costs business owners , shareholders , workers and consumers , as well as state and local_governments , hundreds of billions of dollars a year to comply with the existing environmental laws enacted by Congress . This money is_well spent only if the results are worth it . There is no question that the public loathes pollution and loves the idea of a green world . But people are starting to object to policies that protect the environment stupidly . Crime can ' t be fought , children educated , cancer cured or welfare reformed if environmental-protection money isn ' t used wisely . Cleaning_up dirt at industrial Superfund sites to edible levels , forcing schools to rip asbestos from behind sealed walls or sacrificing jobs to protect subspecies can seem disproportionate to our more dangerous risks . Environmental realism seeks to find a balance by enhancing respect for honest science , private_property and state and local budgets . There is growing consensus on the common-sense need to assess risks scientifically , compare relative risks and weigh the costs and benefits of government mandates . Some reactionary environmentalists disparage the principles of &quot; risk analysis , &quot; &quot; property_rights &quot; and &quot; unfunded mandates &quot; as an &quot; unholy trinity &quot; intended to gut the environment as we know it . But if lawmakers and the public are kept_in the dark about real risks and costs , the country will continue to buy environmental protection of the wrong kinds and amounts . Common_sense is also rooted in the Constitution . The Fifth_Amendment promises that the government will not take private_property for public purposes without paying just compensation . This clause has been increasingly invoked by landowners prohibited from using their property by regulations designed to protect wetlands , species , beaches and green space . These are worthwhile public objectives . But if their cost is too_much for the public ' s coffers , why should private citizens foot the bill ? The final common-sense standard is a straightforward money question . Congress keeps passing laws that compel state and local_governments to spend billions to comply with federal mandates . Goals like safe drinking_water and clean air are good and necessary . But as Sen . John_Glenn ( D-Ohio ) has said , Congress has an insatiable impulse to pass the buck but not the bucks . Governors and mayors just cannot afford these unfunded mandates without depriving their constituents of a lot of other public_services . If the federal money isn ' t there for the taking , which it isn ' t , then the minimum that good government can do is insist on a careful ordering of regulatory priorities . The more mandates , the higher the property , sewer and water taxes -- and these don ' t hit the rich hardest . Senior environmental officials in the Clinton_Administration are uncomfortable with the Democrat and Republican legislators who want to build these standards into law . This oldthink will not wash in 1994 any more_than it did_in 1969 . Then , the National Environmental Policy Act ordered all federal decision-makers to consider environmental impacts before any major action . Surely it is no less desirable that the major impacts of environmental actions be considered just as carefully . The new environmental realism will improve , not stifle , environmental protection if results are measured in terms of_value received . No one really believes that the billions of environmental dollars spent today are spent well enough .</TEXT>
