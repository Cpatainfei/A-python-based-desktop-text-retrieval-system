   <HEADLINE> PHOTOGRAPHER LOSES APPEAL OF BIAS SUIT FILED BY GAY IN O.C.</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The state Supreme Court on Thursday rejected an appeal by a commercial photographer sued for sex discrimination after he excluded a gay couple ' s picture from a 10-year reunion book produced for the Class of 1977 at University High_School in Irvine . However , while leaving an appellate ruling against the photographer intact , the high_court withdrew the ruling as a precedent for future cases . The ruling contained criticisms by one appellate justice of the high_court ' s narrow reading of state civil_rights laws . Justices Stanley Mosk and Joyce L . Kennard cast dissenting votes to leave the appellate ruling on the books . The ruling &quot; still sends a message that discrimination against gay or lesbian couples will not be tolerated under the law , &quot; said Gloria Allred , lawyer for the Orange County man who filed the suit . The man , David Engel , is entitled to damages and attorney ' s fees as a result of the ruling . The photographer ' s lawyer could not be reached for comment . The case involed a photo company that agreed to take portrait pictures of alumni for a memory book , but refused to include a picture of Engel , a theatrical actor , and his partner , Eric Underwood . Dan Worthington , owner of the photo company , said he had a policy against taking pictures of same-sex couples because it would violate his beliefs and cost him advertising revenue . When the reunion committee objected , saying all alumni had been promised portrait pictures , Worthington decided not to publish the book . Engel ' s suit was dismissed by Orange County Superior_Court Judge David H . Brickner , who said Worthington had shown no intent to discriminate and had stated valid business justifications for his policy . But the 4th District Court of Appeal ruled 2 to 1 last October that Worthington had violated the state ' s civil_rights law . The lead opinion by Justice Sheila Prell Sonenshine said the photographer was guilty of sex discrimination because his decision was determined by the sex of Engel ' s partner . Although the policy would have applied equally to an all-female couple , Sonenshine said , &quot; equal application of a discriminatory practice makes_it no less violative of the law. &quot; The exclusion was not justified by Worthington ' s beliefs or financial concerns , Sonenshine said .</TEXT>
