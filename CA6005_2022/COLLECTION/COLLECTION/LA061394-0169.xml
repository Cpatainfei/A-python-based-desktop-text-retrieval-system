   <HEADLINE> FAMED RABBI ' S FUNERAL DRAWS THOUSANDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Stricken followers of Rabbi Menachem Schneerson bore his plain pine coffin on their shoulders Sunday before he was interred with simple prayers in a small cemetery in Queens . Around the world , disciples of the charismatic leader of the ultra-Orthodox Lubavitcher movement greeted his passing with tears , songs , hope and disbelief . Many of his supporters believed the rabbi , with his full white beard and piercing blue eyes , was the Messiah . Approximately three months after he suffered a stroke , Schneerson , the seventh in a line of Lubavitcher rebbes dating_back to 18th-Century Russia and a force in modern Israeli politics , died early Sunday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan . He was 92 , childless and , for the moment , left no clear successor . &quot; Unfortunately , there is no one , as they say , in the dugout who will take the place of this great leader , &quot; said Rabbi Shea Hecht , an important figure in the movement . On Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn , a siren sounded moments after Schneerson ' s death at 1:50 a.m. EDT and hundreds of the rabbi ' s followers gathered_in pre-dawn darkness in front of the red-brick Lubavitcher headquarters . Others surged first to the hospital . By the time of the funeral almost 15 hours later , their numbers had swollen to thousands in Brooklyn -- a sea of Hasidic men in traditional black felt hats and black coats , mothers wheeling baby_carriages , young children in their best clothes , a teen-ager dressed in black on roller_skates . Many were red-eyed from lack of sleep and weeping . As word spread around the globe , supporters in Israel , France and Britain chartered planes and rushed to the funeral . Rabbi Chaim Mentz said when he reached the airport in Los Angeles 45 minutes after hearing the rabbi was dead , he was amazed to find 500 people scrambling for tickets to New York . A long line of the rebbe ' s followers filed into the headquarters building to look through a half-open door and catch_a_glimpse of his body , lying_in his study and covered by a white cloth . Thousands , some crying hysterically , surged forward to touch the coffin when it finally emerged from the building and was placed in a van for the trip under heavy police escort to the cemetery . Some walked 10 miles to the cemetery where Schneerson , who through word_of_mouth and satellite communications transformed an isolated sect to an important force in Judaism , was interred in a small granite mausoleum . About 100 men climbed_on top of the mausoleum , open at the center , to have a better view . After the interment , Lubavitchers were allowed into the mausoleum single-file . But many of Schneerson ' s followers became impatient , and police had trouble maintaining order . Three officers and two Lubavitchers suffered minor injuries when crowds surged forward , and two Lubavitchers were arrested on charges of disorderly_conduct , police said . In Kfar Habad , the Israeli village where followers of the rabbi ' s Habad movement built a meticulous replica of his Brooklyn headquarters , people danced , drank vodka and refused to believe reports that he had died . &quot; He ' s the Messiah . He ' s not dead , &quot; one said . &quot; It ' s a test of our faith. &quot; Thousands of miles away , that sentiment was echoed over and over by many on Eastern Parkway . Although he never claimed to be the Moshiach ( pronounced Mo-she-ah ) , or Messiah , many of the rabbi ' s followers stoutly believed he was the person chosen to revitalize Judaism and bring peace , prosperity and heaven on Earth . Schneerson suffered a stroke March 10 -- his second in two years -- and his condition steadily worsened . His first stroke in 1992 had left him unable to speak and partially paralyzed . The rebbe ' s death -- to the end an incomprehensible occurrence to his most zealous followers -- left the movement without a leader . It also leaves them with the prospect of a tumultuous time of disillusionment and change before a new rebbe assumes leadership . Many of Schneerson ' s followers believed that because the rebbe was the promised Messiah , he would not die before world peace was established , all Jews gathered_in Israel , and the Temple in Jerusalem -- destroyed in 70 C.E. ( common_era ) -- was rebuilt . &quot; What will happen now is the continuation of the same , &quot; said one of the rebbe ' s advisers who spoke Sunday on the condition his name not be used . &quot; We don ' t know . You have to engage in willing suspension of disbelief . The rebbe ' s life was_full of miracles. &quot; &quot; We are going_to persist , &quot; the adviser said . &quot; What form will that take ? Whatever form it requires . we ' ll find a way to clear_away the rubble. &quot; For other Jews -- both religious and secular -- who discounted the messianic claims and saw in some of Schneerson ' s pronouncements unwelcome meddling in the political affairs of Israel , his passing will close a controversial chapter in Jewish life . Born in 1902 , Schneerson was the seventh Lubavitcher rebbe since Rabbi Shneur Zalman , the founder . Schneerson was trained as an engineer at the University of Berlin and the Sorbonne . In 1929 , he married the second daughter of the sixth Lubavitcher rebbe . Both he and his wife , Chaya Moussia , who died in 1988 , are great-great-grandchildren of the third Lubavitcher rebbe . In 1941 , he emigrated to the United States . Then , in 1951 , he succeeded his father-in-law , Rabbi Joseph Isaac Schneersohn as rebbe . Since then , the movement , which was decimated during World_War_II and the Nazi Holocaust , has become one of the world ' s most influential Hasidic sects . Its annual budget has been conservatively estimated by one of the rebbe ' s secretaries at $ 100 million . Estimates differ on its membership . While Rabbi Baruch Y . Hecht , associate director of Habad of California , puts the number at between 300 # 000 and 350 # 000 worldwide , one authority outside the movement , Prof . Samuel C . Heilman of Queens College of the City_University of New York , said there are no more_than 35 # 000 . Whatever the number , Schneerson built_up a movement whose influence went_far beyond the confines of its seemingly insular Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn , where devout men , or Hasidim , strictly observe the traditional dress code of beards and curled sideburns , and black flat-topped felt hats and black suits . ( Not all Hasidim , however , are Schneerson followers. ) In 1988 , the rebbe created a sensation that divided the Jewish world when he nearly succeeded in amending Israel ' s Law of Return to require that all who convert to Judaism follow Orthodox tradition . Shortly before Israeli elections , his movement engaged in overt politicking that resulted in five candidates for the small but ultra-Orthodox Agudat Israel party winning seats in the Knesset . When those seats were combined with those held by another small ultra-Orthodox party , Shas , they became the fulcrum on which the balance_of_power shifted between Israel ' s two major parties . The upshot was that then-Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir won the endorsement of both parties -- after acceding_to the rebbe ' s views on the Law of Return . Ultimately , however , the Knesset rejected any change in the law . In 1992 , to the consternation of some Israeli officials , the rebbe vigorously reasserted his opposition to any suggestion that Israel cede land to the Palestinians in exchange for peace -- just when peace talks began to intensify . In recent years the debate over whether Schneerson had acknowledged that he was the long-awaited Messiah divided his followers and drew dismay -- and at times scorn -- from Jews outside the sect . Many Jewish theologians have held that a potential Messiah is born every generation . Unlike the Christian belief that Jesus as Messiah was both God and man , the Messiah expected by Hasidic Jews is entirely human . In the last several years , many of Schneerson ' s followers fervently urged him to reveal himself as the Messiah to bring_about the long hoped-for messianic age . His most zealous followers argued that he did that when he nodded his assent as they sang a messianic song , &quot; King Moshiach , &quot; last year . But the rebbe ' s closest confidants , noting that he had suffered a stroke and it was hard to say what he may have intended , were adamant in discounting such claims . They did , however , acknowledge that Schneerson would definitely be a leading candidate . At one point , Schneerson himself reportedly rejected pleas to reveal himself as Messiah . &quot; I know what my work is . Don ' t give me new assignments , &quot; he told followers in 1991 , according to a book by Jerome R . Mintz , a professor of anthropology and Jewish studies at Indiana University . Whatever their differences over whether Schneerson had publicly acknowledged his messiahship , all Lubavitchers revered him and believed that he was the expected one . They worked fervently to bring_about the messianic age when Schneerson would unmistakably reveal himself as King Moshiach . They redoubled their efforts in 1991 , when Schneerson said he had done all that he could to bring_about the messianic era . Schneerson told his followers that it was up_to them and all Jews to ask what they could do to hasten the Messiah ' s arrival . The result was a reinvigorated and almost unheard of effort in Judaism , aimed at proselytization and bringing lapsed Jews back into the fold . As Schneerson grew older , such efforts intensified . Last year , for example , his adherents paid_for billboards in Southern California that said &quot; Discover Moshiach. &quot; What effect his death has_on the movement and the morale of his followers is uncertain . Last year , in an interview with The Times , Mintz said disillusionment was inevitable . &quot; Everyone has worked themselves up_to a frenzy now , &quot; he said . &quot; Of course , they ' re going to be doomed to disappointment. &quot; Heilman disagreed . He said that while some followers on the edges may fall_away , those in the core_group will declare that they must be even more faithful than ever because of Schneerson ' s death .
