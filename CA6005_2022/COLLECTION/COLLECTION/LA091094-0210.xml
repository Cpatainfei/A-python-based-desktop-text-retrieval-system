   <HEADLINE> U.S. TO SEND 2 # 000 TROOPS OFF HAITI ; CARIBBEAN : THE PENTAGON ' S DECISION DOUBLES THE NUMBER OF FORCES IN THE REGION . SOLDIERS WOULD ACT ONLY AS OCCUPYING FORCE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a further sign of U.S. intentions in Haiti , the Pentagon on Friday decided to dispatch 2 # 000 Army infantry soldiers to within eyesight of the island ' s coastline in a move that doubles the number of U.S. combat forces in the region . The soldiers , part of the 10th Mountain Division from Ft . Drum , N.Y. , are to leave Norfolk , Va. , on Wednesday aboard the aircraft_carrier Dwight D . Eisenhower and reach waters near Haiti within five days . Sources stressed here Friday night that the troops would not be part of the landing force , should an invasion take_place . Rather , they would act_as part of the multinational occupying force that would help restore order once the Haitian military chief , Lt . Gen . Raoul Cedras , is ousted and deposed Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide is returned to power . &quot; These troops are going_in no matter what , &quot; said one senior Pentagon official . &quot; The only uncertainty now is how Cedras leaves , whether he steps_down or gets stepped on. &quot; The 10th Mountain soldiers will boost to nearly 4 # 000 the number of U.S. troops stationed near Haiti . On Aug . 17 , 1 # 800 U.S. Marines landed in Puerto Rico , where they have been conducting exercises to prepare_for either an invasion of Haiti or for assignments as part of the occupying force there . &quot; These Marines can evacuate Americans or invade or help in mop-up activities , &quot; one U.S. military official said Friday . &quot; They can do anything. &quot; The 10th Mountain soldiers are specifically designed as a unit trained to fight in difficult terrain . They have a long history dating_back to campaigns during World_War_II that helped break the German resistance in northern Italy . More recently , the 10th Mountain was used to help bring_in first-aid supplies to war-torn Somalia . According to Pentagon officials , two Navy ships -- the Eisenhower and the Mount_Whitney -- were ordered Friday to return to the Norfolk naval base after leaving Wednesday for long-planned joint exercises in the Atlantic_Ocean . They are to arrive in Norfolk today and Monday , sources said , and will be prepared_for the Caribbean mission . The Eisenhower will be reconfigured to carry the soldiers , while the Mount_Whitney will be used as a command and control ship . The ships will depart Wednesday for Haiti , where sources said they are to be in place by Sept . 19 . &quot; They ' ll be right offshore within eyesight of the beach , &quot; said one senior U.S. military_leader . &quot; It will be like if you looked_out your living room window and saw company pulling_up the driveway. &quot; The source , who earlier this week said that he thought an invasion was a sure thing , said Friday that he now believes Cedras will capitulate . &quot; We ' re sending a loud and clear message that says we ' re coming_in either way . And my bet is that Cedras is going_to get the hint and be gone. &quot; In a second move Friday bolstering the U.S. military intentions in Haiti , the Pentagon ordered the preparation of five more large military cargo_ships to be used by a U.S. fleet in the threatened invasion . The move brings_to 12 the number of such ships now being activated to carry heavy_weapons , supplies and troops to Haiti . The 12 cargo_ships , which are stationed at various ports along the Eastern and Southern seaboards , have been ordered to be ready next week to load military weapons . The ships are manned by civilian crews and are under contract to the Navy . They can be activated on short notice ; all are nearly 700 feet long and can travel at high speed . In addition , the Navy already has nine warships near Haiti , along with the 1 # 800 Marines . On Friday , the Marine detachment practiced storming beaches amid grenade and mortar shell fire at Vieques , Puerto Rico , as part of a practice invasion . Most speculation has been that any invasion by 10 # 000 troops , most of them from the United States , would occur between late September and mid-October .</TEXT>
