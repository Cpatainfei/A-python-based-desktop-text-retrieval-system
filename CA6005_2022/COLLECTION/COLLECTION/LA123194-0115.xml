   <HEADLINE> U.S. PILOT STANDS BY ' CONFESSION ' TO N . KOREANS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> American military pilot Bobby Hall flew home to Florida on Friday after telling U.S. military officials that he stood_by the handwritten &quot; confession &quot; he gave to his North_Korean captors , a statement that many U.S. officials had believed was counterfeited in classic Cold_War style for propaganda purposes . Hall , held captive in North_Korea for 12 days after his military helicopter veered into the demilitarized zone that separates North and South_Korea , was to arrive_at MacDill Air_Force Base in Tampa on Friday night , then drive_home with his family to nearby Brooksville . His release to American officials defused a crisis that had threatened a pending nuclear agreement with North_Korea and jeopardized a recent diplomatic thaw in relations on the volatile peninsula . Soon after he was freed , Hall told U.S. military aides that his widely publicized statement was &quot; an accurate depiction &quot; of his views on the Dec . 17 incident , according to a senior Pentagon official . Hall ' s written explanation , released by North_Koreans on Wednesday , acknowledged a &quot; criminal action &quot; by flying into their airspace and was filled with other harsh language that led U.S. officials to believe that its aim was to demonstrate American transgressions . While that was clearly the North_Koreans ' hope , Hall ' s account suggested that the North_Koreans finally gave_up their attempts to get what they wanted . Quoting Hall , the Pentagon official said the North_Koreans had asked him for a statement and had &quot; obviously wanted much stronger language &quot; when he stated that he had unintentionally wandered into North_Korean airspace . Although there was some &quot; back and forth discussion , &quot; the North_Koreans ultimately accepted the account that Hall was willing to sign , the official said . Hall was under some &quot; mental duress &quot; from simply being unexpectedly in the North_Koreans ' hands , the official said . But he &quot; was under no physical duress to sign the statement , &quot; the official said . He said Hall was generally &quot; well treated &quot; in North_Korea , was &quot; well fed , got lots of rest. &quot; A medical_examination in Seoul also showed him to be in good_condition , officials said . Pentagon officials asserted that Hall ' s account supported the official U.S. view of the events -- &quot; he was lost and strayed unintentionally into North_Korea , &quot; as one official put it . Hall ' s debriefing also provided new details of the grounding of the aircraft , which killed Hall ' s co-pilot , David M . Hilemon . But it left other mysteries unsolved . Hall told military aides that , although the motor failed , forcing him to descend from a height of somewhat less than 1 # 000 feet , he saw no direct_evidence that the North_Koreans had fired on his helicopter . The helicopter apparently &quot; did not break_up in flight &quot; nor did Hall see any tracer_bullets , the official said . * Pentagon officials said they believe that the helicopter was probably shot down , although they do not so far have enough evidence to say so conclusively . However , the Associated Press , quoting an unidentified source , said that Hall told officials that he was the target of North_Korean fire after straying across the border . Hall , according to the source , heard or saw some kind of explosion on Hilemon ' s side of the helicopter -- apparently from antiaircraft artillery_fire or a surface-to-air_missile . Pentagon officials on Friday said that Hall was able to land the craft by maneuvering it while the blade continued to rotate , a technique that helicopter pilots practice during training . After it landed , the helicopter burned . Pentagon officials also produced a chart showing navigational details of Hall ' s flight over the 2 # 000-meter-wide demilitarized zone . The chart suggested that Hall veered from his course because he had mistaken a group of topographic features -- rivers , roads and other terrain -- for a spot referred to as Checkpoint 84 . But Hall was unable to shed any light on how his co-pilot died . Hilemon ' s body was returned earlier this week to his family in Washington state . Results of an autopsy will not be available for another two weeks , officials said . Nor have military officials made a decision on whether to charge Hall for losing his way on what they have described as a routine mission . Senior military officials in Korea are conducting a fact-finding mission on his conduct , but it is unclear when they will offer their recommendations to Secretary_of_Defense William J . Perry . Hall was scheduled to undergo further debriefing as he flew Friday from Korea to Japan , and then to Alaska , before arriving in Florida . Hall was to spend the New Year ' s holiday with his family before returning to duty at some future date . At a news_conference Friday morning , Hall ' s wife , Donna , said that she eagerly anticipated a &quot; very quiet , very private &quot; reunion . In a phone_call from South_Korea before his departure , &quot; he said he was treated fine , &quot; she said . Meanwhile , with Hall out of the North_Koreans ' hands , U.S. officials were offering blunter assessments of what the North_Korean regime had gained from holding Hall for nearly two weeks . Winston Lord , assistant secretary_of_state , asserted that the North_Koreans &quot; didn ' t achieve any of their objectives &quot; with Hall ' s detention . They wanted an official apology and to establish direct peace talks with the United States . &quot; None of these objective were achieved , &quot; he said on the CBS &quot; This Morning &quot; program . U.S. officials , who declared their &quot; sincere regret &quot; for the incident to gain Hall ' s release , were more circumspect in their statements until he was freed . Still unclear was how much Hall ' s detention would cloud prospects for the $ 4-billion nuclear accord with North_Korea , which comes_to a vote_in January in Congress . The complex deal would give North_Koreans Western nuclear technology and a temporary fuel_oil supply in exchange for giving_up plutonium development and their nuclear_weapons program . While analysts from both political_parties said they expect the Hall incident to raise new charges that the North_Koreans cannot be trusted , most members who are criticizing the proposal are still not pledging outright opposition . Senate Majority_Leader Bob Dole ( R-Kan. ) , hailing Hall ' s return , stopped short of saying that he will oppose the accord . &quot; Congress has a responsibility to determine if this deal , which includes legitimizing and providing assistance to the North_Koreans , is in the best interests of the United States and the American people , &quot; Dole said in a statement . In South_Korea , ambiguities in the agreement that led to Hall ' s release provoked fears that the Pyongyang regime may manipulate the accord to its future benefit . The Chosun Ilbo , a major Seoul-based newspaper , expressed concern in an editorial that U.S.-North Korean discussion of the prisoner issue &quot; may infringe our sovereignty. &quot; &quot; We have every right to be alerted , &quot; the editorial said . &quot; We suspect that the United States , having been obsessed with an early repatriation of Bobby Hall , may perhaps have made itself a weak negotiator. &quot; Concern in Seoul centers_on U.S. agreement to try to avoid such incidents in the future through discussions in an &quot; appropriate forum. &quot; Many South_Koreans fear that this may mean routine bilateral contacts between North_Korean and U.S. military_forces , a goal long sought by the North . Ever since the 1950-53 Korean_War , the Communist government in Pyongyang has sought to portray the key conflict on the Korean_Peninsula as being between the North and United States . This stance is intended to relegate South_Koreans to the role of virtual colonial subjects of the United States , thereby shifting the diplomatic balance_of_power to the benefit of the North .
