   <HEADLINE> RELUCTANT NOVICE : WINNING AT LOSING ; VISITING A DIETITIAN RESULTS IN A CUSTOM DIET -- COOKIES INCLUDED -- AND INSPIRING WORDS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Like many overweight Americans , I ' m trying to wake_up and smell the tofu , even if I ' d rather have an Egg McMuffin . The extra pounds I ' ve gained over 10 years of marriage are an unwelcome albatross around my neck , even if most of them have , ahem , settled elsewhere on my endomorphic frame . I have a file full of diet recipes and a pantry full of artificial sweetener . But my submission to Mrs . Fields , among other temptations , always seems to get_in the way of permanent progress . Having tried the liquid_diet route without lasting success ( like Oprah ) , I decide to try nutrition counseling . A good friend of mine lost 77 pounds and has kept it off for five years through exercise and counseling . She tells me the best way to get my money ' s worth is to seek_out a registered dietitian . Anyone can call themselves a nutritionist , but a registered dietitian has a bachelor ' s degree . They are also required to intern for six months to a year at a teaching hospital . Look_for the R.D. accreditation after their name . I make an appointment with Joan Levinthal , a registered dietitian in Woodland Hills with 15 years experience . Until our appointment , she asks me to keep a list of the foods I eat for two weekdays and one weekend day , and note if my eating habits vary on Saturday or Sunday . She also asks me to write_down foods I like to eat and list any medications taken regularly , including vitamins . This sounds easy enough . However , on the day I begin the list I find myself trying to eat only sensible foods to impress her . Even this pressure doesn ' t completely curb temptation , though . I still want my cookies and , agonizing with pen to paper , record each and every one . Finally , after two days of recording my meals , I head to Woodland Hills for my consultation . I down a submarine_sandwich and a Diet Coke as I drive . I park my car as I dust the bread crumbs off of my blouse . Popping_in a mint to offset possible onion breath , I catch sight of the dietitian ' s personalized license_plate : Diets 4 U . I prepare to say hello tofu and goodby pizza . Levinthal ushers me into her office , and I am seated near her desk equipped with a computer terminal . Behind me is a table of healthy packaged foods such_as butter substitutes and sweeteners . We chitchat a moment , and she works_up to the dreaded question : How much do I weigh ? My mind races . Do I give her my driver ' s license weight or the real_thing ? I come clean with the truth . She then says , &quot; Would you mind stepping_on the scale ? &quot; Oh no ! How can I tell her to subtract at least two pounds for my lunch ? Onto her hospital-style scale I hop . YIKES ! I am seven pounds heavier than I thought . I express some surprise , and think_of blaming at least some of it on my lunch , but decide to let sleeping subs lie . Levinthal explains that the only way to achieve weight loss success is to write_down personal reasons for wanting to lose and posting them in critical places -- on the refrigerator , in a car , at a desk . Friends and family should be supportive as well , she says , by laying_off the greasy potato_chips and slippery barbecued ribs . I nod , wondering how to explain this to my Fred Flintstone of a husband who knows our butcher by his first_name and owns a monogrammed meat brand . I admit to her that vanity is my primary motivation : I want to look better in my clothes . Levinthal seems pleased with my reasons and comments that they are positive goals , unlike losing_weight for a concerned doctor . She then asks to see the list of foods I like . When she sees kung pao chicken on it , she says she believes that the popular Chinese dish has as much fat in it as four Quarter Pounders from McDonalds . Ouch ! Much to my surprise , however , she does not lecture me about my cookie addiction . She then calls_up a program on her computer and punches_out a personalized three-day diet for me that includes several of my favorite foods -- popcorn , meatless burgers and even cookies ! I am amazed not only at the foods in the diet but the amount of food I can eat -- four times a day -- and still keep my intake at 1 # 350 calories . But the amount of some of the foods is significantly less than I normally eat . And the cookies I am allowed are not those I would normally buy . While the diet won ' t be painless , it doesn ' t sound unreasonable , either . I tell her I think I can do_it , and she looks_at me with confidence and says , &quot; Of course you can. &quot; Hearing that helps me to believe it . We wrap_up the hour with a quick discussion about some of the fat and sugar substitutes available , many of which she has free samples to distribute to clients . I take_home a plastic bag full of goodies including butter substitutes and a folder with my diet in it . Levinthal ' s introductory one-hour consultation with diet program is $ 60 . She recommends weekly visits for support in the first month , tapering_off to bimonthly visits until an individual ' s goal is reached . Follow-up visits cost $ 30 each . Like any dieter , I realize my battle is an uphill one . And while Molly McButter isn ' t exactly fabulous , I bet it tastes delicious if you eat it wearing a bikini .</TEXT>
