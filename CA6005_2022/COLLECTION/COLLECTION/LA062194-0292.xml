   <HEADLINE> WORLD CUP USA ' 94 / THE FIRST ROUND ; BRAZIL DESERVES SOME EXTRA POINTS FOR STYLE ; GROUP_B : THE SCORE WAS ONLY 2-0 , BUT THE DOMINANCE OF RUSSIA WAS MUCH MORE COMPLETE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> It was like the giant spectator wave that kept rolling_around and around old Stanford Stadium Monday . It was the Brazilian soccer team , and its debut in the World Cup resembled one of those old Western movies , where the cavalry keeps charging and charging and charging . To Russian goaltender Dmitri Kharine , Brazil must have seemed like a team of hundreds . That Kharine gave_up only two goals in Brazil ' s 2-0 victory is commendable , considering most of the 15 other shots Brazil took were viable , close-in scoring chances . He actually gave_up only one goal during continual play -- that to Romario -- and another on a penalty kick to Rai , after one of his defenders actually was called_for one of the frequent muggings perpetrated on Brazil ' s forwards . Asked if he thought he ' d had a chance to stop Romario ' s goal , which came_in the 26th minute off a corner_kick from Bebeto and was achieved despite Russian defender Vladislav Ternavsky ' s grabbing everything but Romario ' s car keys , Kharine said , &quot; I guess you could say I had a chance , but it was Romario. &quot; In other words , this was no mere mortal he was being asked to stop . There rests the gist of a problem that the favored Brazilians face in this event . Not only are they expected to win , they are expected to do so both convincingly and artistically . It is a pedestal of great height resting_on a narrow , slippery base . The great expectations spring from the fanaticism of followers perhaps unlike any others in the world . They wear yellow shirts , paint their faces green and chant and bang drums for hours before the game and for hours after it . And they travel worldwide , turning most Brazilian games into Brazilian home_games . Monday , they flooded the streets and neighborhoods around Stanford Stadium before the game , waving their flags , singing their songs and teasing the traffic_cops . Then they flooded the stadium , where attendance was announced at 81 # 061 and where the dominant color was yellow . They love their team and they love their fun . But they are also soccer fans , which means they love to win and they have a ready target in case they don ' t . After providing thunderous applause to greet their team , Brazilian fans greeted the introduction of Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira with mostly silence , then a scattering of boos . The second area of expectation is more subtle , and , if you are Brazil ' s soccer team , almost unfairly burdensome . Simply put , world and U.S. soccer officials badly need World Cup ' 94 to be a smash hit . A successful U.S. pro league will make the sport truly global , not to mention filthy rich . But that is unlikely to be achieved with anything less than a shocking result from the U.S. team or a spectacular athletic show by a spectacular athletic team . Since the U.S. prospects of going_past the round of 16 -- or even getting_to it -- are not great , that leaves the hope for a spectacular team . Enter Brazil . All of this showed clearly in the aftermath of Monday ' s 2-0 victory . Brazil had dominated , outclassed and totally defeated the Russians . Had it been a baseball_game , it would have been 16-1 . But it was greeted mostly with shrugs . Russian Coach Pavel Sadyrin said , &quot; It is always bad to lose , but today , it was more explainable. &quot; In other words , the Brazilians are so good , it is OK to lose to them . Brazilian midfielder Rai said , &quot; This was expected by the Brazilian people , and now , in our next games , we will be more free flowing. &quot; Contributing to the sea of yellow in Stanford Stadium Monday were yellow hats , thousands of them , produced and somehow mass distributed by Nike , the master of never missing a marketing trick . They read , &quot; Just Do It , Brasil. &quot; For the Brazilians in World Cup ' 94 , that ' s more_than merely a slogan . It ' s a mandate .</TEXT>
