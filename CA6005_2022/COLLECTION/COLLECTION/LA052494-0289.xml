   <TEXT> The tobacco_industry began what is expected to be a vigorous counterattack against the government assault on smoking Monday as R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co . launched a public relations campaign to &quot; bring some balance to the debate surrounding second-hand smoke and other issues surrounding cigarettes. &quot; In full-page advertisements in major U.S. newspapers , the company insisted that nonsmokers are routinely exposed to &quot; very little &quot; second-hand smoke . The ads claimed that in a month a nonsmoker living with a smoker would be exposed to environmental smoke that was , on average , the equivalent of smoking 1 1 / 2 cigarettes in a month . &quot; A nonsmoking waiter working eight hours a day , five days a week &quot; for a month would be exposed to the equivalent of two cigarettes , according to the ads . &quot; And a nonsmoker sharing a modern office with a smoker would , on average , be exposed to the equivalent of 1 1 / 4 cigarettes &quot; in a month , the ads concluded . The company ' s action came at a time when smokers are under an unprecedented siege by the federal_government , states and other forces . Two weeks ago , tobacco proponents suffered a significant defeat when the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on health and the environment approved a measure that would impose widespread restrictions on smoking in public facilities . Also , the Labor_Department has proposed rules to prohibit smoking in the workplace , and the Pentagon has announced that it will do so in its work sites worldwide . Most of these initiatives have been fueled by the decision of the Environmental Protection Agency to classify second-hand smoke as a &quot; Class A carcinogen , &quot; meaning that it is an indisputable cause of cancer . The EPA and an array of medical and public health experts have called second-hand tobacco smoke a cause of lung_cancer and heart_disease in nonsmokers and of asthma in children . The agency has estimated that such environmental smoke causes about 3 # 000 lung_cancer deaths in nonsmokers annually and that as_many as 300 # 000 children younger than 18 months become sick every year from smoke . The industry has challenged the EPA ' s ruling , saying that the agency did not conduct any original research and its conclusions were based on flawed science . EPA Administrator Carol M . Browner lashed_out at the Reynolds campaign Monday , saying that it &quot; will not distract the public from the real issue : that second-hand smoke poses a serious health problem. &quot; Dr. Chris Coggins , a toxicologist who is a scientist with Reynolds , said that the company ' s calculations are based on measuring nicotine levels in the air , since it is a compound found both in mainstream smoke and second-hand smoke and is &quot; the only commonly used second-hand smoke marker that is specific to tobacco. &quot; The ads urged discussion rather than government intervention , saying that &quot; the solution to most smoking issues can be found in accommodation. &quot;</TEXT>
