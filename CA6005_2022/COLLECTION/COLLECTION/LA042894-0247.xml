   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ALBUM ; CRUSADERS MOBILIZE TO SAVE SACRAMENTO ' S SHADY CHARACTER ; THE ENEMY OF THEIR PRIZED ELM_TREES IS A DEADLY DISEASE BROUGHT INTO NEIGHBORHOODS BY A TINY BEETLE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> There are times when the heat is unbearable here , when the brisk march of life slows to a woozy crawl . During those times , the people give_thanks to the trees . Without them , Sacramento would be a pitiful place , just another flat , dreary smudge on California ' s dun-colored plain . With them , the locals can survive the broiling days of August -- and regale visitors with the dubious boast that their town is second only to Paris in per capita trees . But all is not well in the urban forest . Its beloved giant -- the elm -- is in peril , plagued by a beetle that threatens to turn the so-called City of Trees into the City of Stumps . No bigger than a matchstick tip , the beetle infects its defenseless hosts with Dutch_elm_disease , a scourge that has decimated tree populations throughout the East and Midwest . If it continues to spread unchecked , the disease could wipe_out half of Sacramento ' s 25 # 000 elms in the next 10 years . Already , 122 have succumbed . &quot; Without the trees , our city would become a heat_sink , another version of Bakersfield , &quot; said Marguerite Crouse , an elm-addicted retiree . &quot; Imagine long blocks with the summer sun just pouring in . We ' d be exposed , baked. &quot; Crouse intends to ensure that this dreadful fate does not come_to pass . When a state program that combatted Dutch_elm_disease was abolished last year , she got busy , mobilizing Sacramentans into a unique save-the-elms army . Their intentions are noble , but their success is by no means assured . Dutch_elm_disease is a wily old beast , one that has confounded arborists since 1922 , leaving 100 million ravaged tree corpses in its wake . * Dan Pskowski is making his morning rounds , doing a_few root inspections and examining some &quot; suspect &quot; elms for wilting or other signs of distress . Pskowski is Sacramento ' s municipal arborist . The health of 100 # 000 city-owned trees rests_on his shoulders . The elms are easy to spot , with girths bigger than a bear_hug and towering lime-green crowns that soften the city ' s hard edges and bland walls . Aside from its beauty , the elm is a trooper among trees . Hardy , fast-growing and long-lived , it stands_up well to the myriad abuses of city life . Cramped growing conditions , pollution , trunk wounds inflicted by careless drivers -- nothing fazes the mighty elm . Because of such traits , the trees were planted abundantly up through the 1920s . Downtown , elms line_block after block , their branches often arching to touch over the street . The leafy tunnels are aesthetically striking , but horticulturally hazardous : Dutch_elm_disease can spread from tree to tree through interwoven roots . Pskowski has stopped his truck in a glaring patch of sun . &quot; See that blank spot ? &quot; he says sadly , pointing to a pathetic strip of brownish grass that marks a break_in a long row of cooling elms . &quot; We lost two right there . Without them , the sun just beats right in . The whole picture is changed. &quot; Dutch_elm_disease is caused by a fungus carried_on the feet of a beetle that burrows beneath a tree ' s bark to feed . Once infected , an elm releases a gooey gel , trying to block the fungus ' spread . Instead , the goo merely clogs the tree ' s water-conducting vessels . Starved of liquid and nutrients , it dies within months . First identified in the_Netherlands in 1922 , the disease made its U.S. debut in 1930 , after crossing the sea with shipments of infested European_elm logs . As the logs moved by rail from Atlantic ports to inland veneer mills , the fungus spread , eventually killing half the elms in the East and Midwest . California was spared until 1975 , when an ailing tree was found in Sonoma County . Since then , Dutch_elm_disease has made a steady march south as far as Gilroy , near Monterey . ( So far , Southern California has escaped its blight . A single Beverly Hills elm tested positive in 1977 , but no additional victims have been found. ) In 1990 , Sacramento got hit , and tree deaths have increased exponentially here in the years since . Things are almost certain to get_worse ; a state program that deployed field crews to detect diseased elms was killed by budget_cuts last summer , leaving cash-strapped cities and ill-trained homeowners to cope on_their_own . Jesse Rios , a pest specialist with the California Department of Forestry , is not optimistic : &quot; Unless some miracle happens , &quot; he warns , &quot; tree mortality will quickly increase and the disease will spread throughout the state. &quot; * Across the street from Marguerite Crouse ' s home is a park , where a lively basketball_game is under way almost every spring afternoon . Sixteen stately elms form a lush fringe around the grassy square . Crouse inspects the 100-foot-tall trees several times each week . A retired state budget analyst , she has reason to fear the Dutch_elm plague . As a child in New Jersey , and later in Wisconsin , she watched as entire forests of urban elms were mowed_down after the beetle moved_in . &quot; It was devastating , &quot; she recalled . &quot; Elms are such noble , dignified trees . When they go , the place is never the same. &quot; And so Crouse has launched a crusade to do what most American cities have failed to do -- save the elms . In a program reminiscent_of the crime-fighting concept of Neighborhood Watch , she is training homeowners to identify at-risk elms so they can be speedily removed before the fungus spreads . The project also will hire crews -- perhaps youths from the California Conservation Corps -- to survey trees between May and September , when the beetles are most active . Though the disease can never be eliminated , Crouse hopes losses can be kept to 1 % a year . The major hitch is money . The local utility , recognizing the energy-saving value of trees , has pitched_in heartily , and the Sacramento Tree Foundation is helping_out as well . But Crouse is still well short of her $ 150 # 000-a-year goal . Another danger is community inertia . Though Sacramentans love their trees , Crouse says , the elms &quot; look so large and dependable , people just assume they will always be there. &quot; Jean Shaw-Connelly , for one , is already on board . She lives_in a neighborhood called Elmhurst , on a boulevard where elms lock limbs to form a dense canopy a mile long . A Presbyterian minister , Shaw-Connelly believes trees are more_than an attractive piece of landscape , more_than an energy-conserving tool , more_than a welcome friend in the heat . &quot; The trees , &quot; she says , &quot; are a catalyst to form community . In places that have no trees , people stay in their air-conditioned houses . But here , we come_out and mingle under this graceful canopy of shade . The trees allow us to get_to know one another. &quot; Dutch_elm_disease struck Elmhurst in 1992 , and two old giants on Shaw-Connelly ' s street have already died . &quot; There is grieving , &quot; she said , &quot; real grieving , when a tree comes_down . You know , it ' s just like losing a neighbor. &quot;</TEXT>
