   <HEADLINE> MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO : EUROPEAN STOCKS SLUMP , BUT PAIN MAY BE LOCALIZED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> American investors in European stocks and bonds experienced a bad case of deja_vu last week : European markets plunged on growing fears that interest_rates there have bottomed . Earlier this year , it took an actual boost in short-term rates by the Federal_Reserve_Board to send U.S. stocks reeling . In Europe , all it took last week was for German central_bank President Hans Tietmeyer to suggest that the Bundesbank may be finished cutting_short rates for now . Mindful of Germany ' s still-languishing economy , Tietmeyer said nothing about raising rates . Yet investors reacted with horror at the thought that European short rates might stop falling , after only 20 months of Bundesbank-led cuts . At about 5 % now , the yield on 3-month German treasury_bills is_well above the 4.25 % yield on U.S. T-bills -- even though Germany ' s economy is weak while the U.S. economy is strong . Rattled by Tietmeyer , the Frankfurt stock_market ' s DAX index slumped 109 points for the week , to 2 # 140.99 Friday -- a drop of 4.8 % , or the equivalent of the Dow industrial index losing 180 points from its current 3 # 757.14. Because the Bundesbank largely calls the tune for interest_rates across Europe , most of the region ' s other stock_markets also went_down hard . In London , the FTSE-100 stock index tumbled 5.1 % for the week ; Milan ' s Mibtel index dove 5.9 % . Worse , in some respects , was the reaction in European bond markets to Tietmeyer ' s comments . In Britain , the yield on the benchmark 15-year government_bond closed at 8.50 % Friday , up from 8.18 % just three days earlier . But while investors were dumping European securities , other world markets paid scant attention . In fact , North_American , South_American and Asian stock_markets generally finished higher last week or unchanged . Other markets ' ability to ignore Europe ' s turmoil may be a sign that international investing has become a stock-picker ' s game again -- unlike last year , when virtually all foreign markets rocketed . As markets go their separate ways , U.S. investors will find international investing more challenging , but also potentially more rewarding . If you can recognize bargains among individual markets , or you ' re in a foreign mutual_fund that has proved its savvy as a global stock-picker , you should earn above-average returns . * So far in 1994 , a good defense has been the best offense in foreign investing . Early this year , the smart_money was selling stocks in Hong Kong , Singapore , Bangkok and other Southeast Asian markets after their 60 % -plus gains in 1993 . Those markets began to dive in January , and only recently have they shown signs of bottoming . Meanwhile , the Japanese stock_market has been this year ' s big surprise . The Nikkei index has jumped 19.3 % year-to-date , fueled by the perception that Japan ' s economy is bottoming after three difficult years . Until last week , European stock_markets had held the middle ground between Southeast Asian markets ' plunge and Japan ' s hot streak . Most European markets were off marginally for the year , though with the dollar ' s weakness American investors still were making money there . Does last week ' s selloff suggest European stocks are poised for a meltdown ? Many international stock fund managers don ' t think so . For the most part , fund managers still believe there ' s room for short- and long-term European interest_rates to fall , because the Continent ' s economy is only beginning to emerge from recession . On Friday , in fact , the Bundesbank ' s Tietmeyer tried to allay investors ' fears by telling a radio interviewer in Germany that &quot; it can be taken_for granted &quot; that the Bundesbank will keep cutting money_market rates , even if it makes no additional cuts_in its official discount_rate . But European stocks now face other obstacles , fund managers admit . John Hickling , who runs the Boston-based Fidelity Overseas fund , says too many European firms are trying to raise money with new stock offerings . &quot; There ' s supply coming from everywhere , &quot; he warns . Political risk is also high , with German elections looming this year . Pressure on politicians in Germany ( and across Europe ) to use government spending to bring_down double-digit unemployment_rates may keep inflation concerns at the forefront , in turn keeping bond yields artificially steep . Lastly , there ' s the issue of valuation : Many European markets look expensive because corporate earnings remain depressed while stocks have rallied since 1992 . Nonetheless , European stock bulls expect their markets to follow the U.S. script : As the economy improves , the bulls see investors flocking back to European industrial stocks , which have the most to gain from an economic turnaround . For example , Hickling ' s fund has about half its assets in Europe , mainly in industrial giants such_as auto_makers Volvo and Peugeot , and energy / petrochemical leaders such_as Elf Aquitaine and Total . Madelynn Matlock , manager of the Bartlett Value International fund in Cincinnati , has 59 % of her fund ' s asset in Europe . She expects investors to eventually return to such industrial names as Tampella , a Finnish maker of mining equipment , and to French construction materials firm Saint Gobain . Jeff Russell , co-manager of the Smith Barney International Equity fund in New York , argues that European stocks still don ' t reflect the future earnings benefit from corporate restructurings still in_full_swing there -- a couple years behind the U.S. restructuring binge . His fund , about 45 % invested in Europe , has targeted stocks in Italy , Ireland and other countries that depreciated their currencies 18 months ago . That depreciation made those countries ' exports more competitive , giving their companies a head_start in Europe ' s recovery , Russell says . But some international stock fund managers contend that the best place to put new money to work today isn ' t Europe , but the beaten-down emerging markets of Asia and Latin_America . Norman Kurland , head of Pioneer International Growth fund in Boston , is only 35 % invested in Europe . He finds more allure in markets such_as Mexico , South_Korea and Thailand , especially after their selloffs this year . If you want to bet_on global growth , Kurland argues , it makes more sense to invest now in Asia or Latin_America . Expansions in the United States and Europe , he says , will be magnified in already-booming emerging economies that are major exporters to the developed world . And emerging markets ' stock valuations are once again reasonable , he says . Comparing World Markets How key world stock_markets performed last week , and their year-to-date performances . Also included is each market ' s price-to-earnings ( P-E ) ratio , based on estimated 1994 earnings , and price-to-book value , which measures stock prices as a multiple of underlying asset value . Stock indexes used are the principal indexes in each country , measured in local currency ; P-Es and price-to-book are Morgan Stanley estimates . 05 # 15 , 13 # 13 , 10 # 12 * 2 * Key stock index chng. : P-E on Price to Market Last week ' 94 to date ' 94 est . book_value Mexico + 2.8 % -4.5 % 14 2.3 Japan + 2.1 % + 19.3 % 72 2.2 Canada + 0.7 % + 0.2 % 43 1.7 United States + 0.5 % -2.0 % 18 2.6 Argentina + 0.4 % + 2.7 % 16 2.8 Korea + 0.4 % + 9.9 % 17 1.3 Australia -0.1 % -3.3 % 15 1.7 Malaysia -0.1 % -21.6 % 25 3.8 Hong Kong -1.7 % -20.3 % 12 2.0 Spain -2.2 % + 2.5 % 17 1.4 Germany -4.8 % -5.5 % 54 2.3 France -4.9 % -9.6 % 26 1.7 Britain -5.1 % -13.2 % 17 2.3 Italy -5.9 % + 16.3 % 32 1.8 Source : Morgan Stanley Capital Intl. ; Times research</TEXT>
