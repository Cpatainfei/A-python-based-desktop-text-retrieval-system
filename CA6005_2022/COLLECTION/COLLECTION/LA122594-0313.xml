   <HEADLINE> NEW KEYBOARDS TRY DIVIDING TO CONQUER TYPING INJURIES ; ERGONOMICS : SALES OF THE MORE EXPENSIVE UNITS ARE SLOW AND THERE IS LITTLE MEDICAL DATA YET TO SHOW THAT THEY WORK .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Mounted on the edge of a desk , the prototype looks_like a conventional computer_keyboard on life support after surviving an ax attack . Dividing the keyboard into halves attached_to rods and hinges , the custom keyboard allows typists to rotate the two sides to position their hands vertically , as if holding a basketball , instead of using it in the flat , horizontal position demanded by a conventional keyboard . Like many alternative designs that have been introduced as PC use has spread into homes and offices across the country , the adjustable keyboard being developed by Irvine-based Genovation Inc. is meant to reduce typing stress by allowing users to change their posture and hand position as they work . &quot; If repetition is the problem , variation is the solution , &quot; said Kevin Conway , a Santa Rosa physical_therapist who holds three patents on the device . Conway began work_on it about three years ago after treating a stream of data-entry workers , newspaper reporters , cash-register clerks and other workers who complained of hand , wrist and arm pain after using a computer terminal all day . But are such typist-friendly devices ahead of the curve or ahead of their time ? Even Conway agrees that the medical justification for such keyboards is spotty . Lawsuits will likely have as great an influence as government regulation in determining how soon these alternative keyboards are adopted as standard equipment by companies and home users . Despite a favorable response to its prototype at industry trade shows , Genovation executives are not sure whether they will put the design into production . At a retail price Genovation estimates at $ 500 to $ 600 , Conway ' s keyboard would be pricier than a basic , $ 100 adjustable model built_in conjunction with software giant Microsoft Corp . * Joseph Meshi , Genovation ' s executive_vice_president , said he also worries that aside from Microsoft ' s design , most of the other so-called ergonomic keyboards -- those designed to better fit users ' hand and wrist movements -- aren ' t selling well . Most manufacturers of such keyboards are small start-up companies , which do not release data on their sales or profitability . &quot; What we ' re hearing from the market , and the reason I ' m a little bit negative about this , is that companies are buying small quantities of these keyboards and supplying them only for those people ( employees ) who insist on having them , &quot; he said . Instead , the Irvine-based company may stick_to its core business of making related products like key pads for cash-registers and add-on key pads for laptop_computers . Only when major PC makers begin to include adjustable keyboards as part of their original equipment will they catch_on with users and companies , Meshi said . Today just a_few PC manufacturers include the Microsoft keyboard , which divides the letter keys of a standard keyboard into two angled sections . And last year Apple Computer began offering a split keyboard of its own that sells for $ 115 . In fact , neither Genovation nor any of the current manufacturers of ergonomic keyboards make medical claims of the usefulness of their devices for avoiding repetitive stress injuries . Instead , they say only that the various hand positions allowed by their products will permit more comfortable typing by encouraging better posture . &quot; The science is extremely complicated , and the number of variables involved are so numerous , it ' s very difficult to draw an exact cause-and-effect relationship between the computer_keyboard and symptoms of physical problems , &quot; says Jeffrey Szmanda , president of the Health_Care Keyboard Co . of Wauwatosa , Wisc . The company recently obtained approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market its device to people already suffering from disabilities . It is only because it has such approval , Szmanda said , that his company dares to mention &quot; cumulative-trauma disorders &quot; in the manual that accompanies its $ 795 keyboard . If companies are reluctant to tout the medical effectiveness of their products , they are only following the uncertainty expressed by the California Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board last month when it voted 6-0 against a measure that would have established the country ' s first comprehensive ergonomics program for office workers . James Smith , a RAND Corp . economist and one of the board_members who voted against the proposal , said some action is probably needed to deal with rising injury rates , but that there hasn ' t been enough study of the hardware that might be required . &quot; The future is that you have to deal with it . There ' s no question that there ' s going_to be a growing workplace health_problem , &quot; he said . But until he sees additional data on how much alternative keyboards would help , Smith said he can ' t vote to impose standards on companies . &quot; It ' s really lowbrow science we ' re seeing at this point . &quot; It ' s hard to distinguish science from advocacy. &quot; Smith said he expects the board will continue to discuss standards in coming months . And the federal_government may issue its own regulations or guidelines on ergonomic standards by the end of this year as well . * Regulators like the state ' s health board have also been hesitant because government_agencies have collected few statistics to measure rates of keyboard-caused injuries or of whether such injuries are growing . According to the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics , of the 89 # 875 cases of repetitive motion injuries that resulted in one or more lost work_days in 1992 , 11 # 111 were associated with typing or repetitive key entry . For many of those workers , the injuries can be severe and career-destroying . Costa Mesa resident Pam Allison , 28 , suffered nerve damage and carpal_tunnel_syndrome after working as a secretary for 10 years for several companies . No longer able to type or write for long periods , or even open jars , she is now developing a home child-care business . &quot; When it first happened , I didn ' t know what to do . This was how I made my livelihood , &quot; she said . &quot; Of course I thought it would n ' t happen to me. &quot; Prodded by the rise of such cases , 1992 was the first year the Department_of_Labor broke_down keyboard-injury statistics . That is also the only year it has tabulated the figures . Repetitive-motion disorders are reported far more frequently by blue-collar employees , such_as those who work in meat-packing plants , knitting mills and auto factories , according to the bureau . In lieu of more conclusive data or medical studies about injuries from keyboard use , the growth of product-liability lawsuits against computer manufacturers -- now numbering in the thousands -- have become the main measure of the seriousness of the problem . * Earlier this year , Compaq Computer Corp . won a lawsuit brought by a Houston secretary who claimed that her injuries left her unable to work . In another case , scheduled to go_to trial the first week of January , a Hastings , Minn. , school district employee is seeking damages for the injuries she claims were caused by using keyboards on IBM and Apple PCs for several years . The plaintiff is represented by Levy , Phillips &amp; Konigsberg , a New York firm that represents about 2 # 000 plaintiffs in various keyboard injury cases against manufacturers of PCs and other equipment . Danielle Goodman , a lawyer at the firm , said most of the plaintiffs are women , which mirrors the Labor_Department statistics that show 10 times as_many women as men are injured by keyboard use . The obvious difference , Goodman said , is that most of the secretarial and administrative support jobs that involve continuous typing are held by women . &quot; We ' re arguing that there ' s been enough scientific literature that at least should have put the defendants on notice that their keyboards were dangerous , &quot; Goodman said in an interview . &quot; The defendants take the position that there ' s a lot of uncertainty . . . but they should at least have a duty to ask more questions than they did &quot; of their equipment ' s safety , she said . Apple declined to comment on the case or to release sales figures for its split keyboard . But other equipment manufacturers say they are concerned about the added costs of including such keyboards with their products as competition increasingly focuses_on costs . &quot; We don ' t want to add costs to our machines that we don ' t see having an obvious benefit , &quot; said Joan Tharp , a spokeswoman for Hewlett-Packard Co . &quot; There isn ' t much customer demand for these things . If we had a clamoring for them , it might be different , &quot; she said . The most notable enthusiasm for the keyboards comes from Microsoft itself , which says it has sold more_than 100 # 000 of the $ 99 Microsoft Natural keyboard in two months and that its suppliers don ' t have the manufacturing capacity to keep_up with demand . Such popularity surprises even Microsoft . &quot; Keyboards get a low mind-share from customers , &quot; said Keith Kegley , a Microsoft product manager . &quot; They approach it as something they don ' t want to think_about , they simply get used to it and deal with it . In the end , their bigger interest is to use them. &quot; Microsoft considered making a more complex , more adjustable keyboard , he said , but &quot; the problem was that people felt as if they were looking_at a contraption . Adjustability has to be subtle. &quot; Microsoft ' s success with its keyboard may break_open a larger market for smaller companies , said Shirley Lunde , vice_president for marketing of Kinesis Corp . in Bothell , Wash. , which sells a $ 390 keyboard whose keys are mostly contained in two concave pods . With larger distributors beginning to pay_attention , she said , overall sales may rapidly increase . A privately held company with revenues of under $ 100 million , Kinesis does not disclose exact sales or profit figures , Lunde said . One point all sides can agree on is that even if the sales of alternative keyboards continue to grow , it is doubtful they alone would reduce injury rates . Dr. David Rempel , director of the University of California ' s ergonomics program in Richmond , said more studies are needed to conclude whether any particular design can prevent injury , or even to see how those injuries are caused . &quot; If you can demonstrate that there ' s a health edge with a certain design , you would force every keyboard manufacturer to adopt your design . But that would have to be a very well-done , convincing study , and there are no such studies , &quot; he said . &quot; The next question is : Given that there are no studies like that underway , what will change users ' opinions about whether they need an input-device ? I think they ( users ) will retreat to how well it works , whether it has any bells and whistles , &quot; he said . Microsoft ' s success probably has more to do with features that make_it specialized for the company ' s popular Windows operating system than with it ergonomic effectiveness , he said . Rempel , who was a member of the committee that drafted the standard rejected by the state ' s safety board , said he was not surprised that it didn ' t pass . More studies are needed to show what particular type of keyboard and positioning can actually reduce injury rates , he said . &quot; If you just pose the question , ' What kinds of keyboards work ? ' you can get everybody and their brother inventing a design with no biomedical understanding &quot; of what reduces injuries , he said . * For typists , the costs of the alternative designs are hard to balance against the fear of developing career-ending injuries . Marylou Remy , owner of 9 to 5 Etc. , a West Los Angeles secretarial service , said she had been concerned about her own heavy typing for years but couldn ' t afford an alternative keyboard until Microsoft ' s went_on sale earlier this year . &quot; I kept putting_off buying it . It ' s funny that even though you know it ' s better for you -- or you think you know it ' s better for you -- that the price is still a consideration . $ 500 is still $ 500 , &quot; she said . After using the Microsoft keyboard for week , Remy returned it , saying the keys required too_much pressure to type . ( BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC ) The Trouble With Typing Nearly 90 # 000 cases of repetitive motion injuries serious enough to require one or more days_off work occured at U.S. businesses and factories in 1992 , the only year for which such information is available . One in eight of these injuries was caused by typing or key entering , and most of those injured typing were women . All repetitive motion injuries : Men : 34.7 % Women 65.3 % Repetitive typing : Men : 8.5 % Women : 91.5 % Repetitive use of tools : Men : 54 % Women : 46 % Days Lost More_than one-third of the 11 # 111 typing inuries caused the individual to miss a month or more of work . Days_off the job : 1 day : 4.6 % 2-6 days : 22.8 % 7-20 days : 25.6 % 21-30 days : 12.0 % More_than 30 days : 35.0 % Occupational Hazard More that 80 % of the typing problems were suffered by those working in technical , sales and administrative support positions , and half resulted in carpal_tunnel_syndrome . Injuries per job category and resulting problem : Technical , sales andadministrative support : 9 # 180 Managerial and professional : 1 # 162 Operators , fabricators and laborers : 454 Precision production , craft and repair : 184 Service : 96 Other : 35 Total : 11 # 111 Nature of the Injury Carpal_tunnel_syndrome : 5 # 658 Tendinitis : 1 # 425 Soreness , pain : 890 Fractures : 16 Bruises , contusions : 12 Back pain : 11 Other : 1 # 894 Total : 11 # 111 Source : Bureau of Labor Statistics ; Researched by ROSS KERBER , Los Angeles Times .</TEXT>
