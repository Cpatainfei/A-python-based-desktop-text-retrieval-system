   <HEADLINE> D.A. SAYS CLINIC OWNER WANTED TO SAVE SELF , NOT PATIENT ; COURTS : HER ACTIONS WERE TO AVOID DETECTION IN WOMAN ' S DEATH DURING AN ILLEGAL ABORTION , PROSECUTOR CHARGES . DEFENDANT SAYS SHE DID ALL SHE COULD TO KEEP HER ALIVE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A prosecutor accused abortion clinic owner Alicia Hanna of being more concerned about protecting herself than saving the life of a patient who began foaming at the mouth during an illegal abortion . Hanna , who is accused of murder , testified Tuesday that she had no time to call_for help as the woman lay dying in her clinic . Deputy Dist . Atty . Richard King questioned Hanna about why she had walked or run past a phone in the clinic at least three times , but failed to dial 911 or ask either of her two assistants to call paramedics . &quot; You were more concerned about avoiding detection than saving that woman ' s life -- weren ' t you ? &quot; King asked . &quot; that ' s not true , &quot; Hanna shot back . &quot; I was trying to save her life . I did everything in my power to save her . I didn ' t have a chance ( to dial 911 ) . It was too fast. &quot; King responded : &quot; The real reason was you didn ' t want paramedics to come_out and see what was going on. &quot; Hanna , who not a doctor , is accused of attempting to perform an illegal abortion on 27-year-old Angela Nieto Sanchez , a mother of four from Orange . Authorities say the woman died at the clinic on Jan . 19 , 1993 , and Hanna dragged the body to the parking_lot to hide it in the trunk of a car . She is_on trial in Orange County Superior_Court on charges of murder , two counts of performing an illegal abortion and one count of attempting an illegal abortion . Prosecutors alleged that Hanna injected Sanchez with an unknown drug and refused an assistant ' s pleas to call 911 after Sanchez began vomiting and having trouble breathing . During cross-examination by the prosecutor Tuesday , Hanna admitted giving abortions to eight other women by injecting them with Methergine . The drug is commonly used in Mexico and other countries to induce uterine_contractions and spontaneous_abortions . But Hanna denied performing an abortion on Sanchez or giving her any drug that could have killed her . Hanna testified that Sanchez appeared to be high on drugs when she arrived_at her clinic . She said she gave the woman a Valium to settle her nerves , but Sanchez suddenly became ill , a reaction Hanna attributed to an allergy or to a lethal mixture of Valium with other drugs Sanchez may have been using . As Sanchez began gasping for breath , Hanna said , she ran_into a hallway in the clinic to get a vial of Narcan , and injected her with the prescription_drug hoping to reverse what she thought was an allergic_reaction to Valium . When that failed , Hanna said , she gave the patient mouth-to-mouth resuscitation , then went_into another room to retrieve an oxygen tank and an oxygen_mask . Nothing she did could save her , Hanna testified . King pointed_out that Hanna also took the time to call her husband for help , but not to dial 911 . Hanna said she called her husband , who also works in the medical_profession , to ask him to bring another oxygen tank because the one she had tried to use was empty . &quot; I was not thinking straight , &quot; Hanna said . &quot; In my mind , I still had hope of bringing her back to life. &quot; &quot; You knew your husband would not expose you , didn ' t you ? &quot; King responded . King also accused Hanna of lying at least eight times to police and Sanchez ' s family members about how Sanchez had died to avoid prosecution . Hanna admitted all_of the lies . &quot; Could you just tell us why you have decided to tell the truth now ? &quot; King asked . &quot; The truth is , I have found the Lord , &quot; Hanna said . &quot; I am walking with the Lord and have made a commitment to tell the truth. &quot; Earlier , under questioning by her own attorney , Hanna said she was sorry_for her actions . &quot; If I had to do_it over again , I would call 911 , &quot; she said . &quot; If it would have been able to save her , I would have , I would have. &quot; Hanna is expected to take the witness_stand again on Wednesday .</TEXT>
