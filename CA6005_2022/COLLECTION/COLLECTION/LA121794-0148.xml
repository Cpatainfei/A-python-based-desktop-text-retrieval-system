   <HEADLINE> ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY ; INVESTORS JOCKEY FOR WINNING EDGE IN A GAME WITH FEW RULES</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> What has become crystal_clear in the nation ' s largest municipal bankruptcy is that many investors in Orange County ' s ill-fated investment portfolio are going_to lose money , lots of it . What is unclear is whose ox is going_to be gored . Will the billions of dollars lost by departed Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L . Citron be divided evenly among those with money in the fund , or will some end_up far down in a pecking order , shouldering more of the financial_loss than others ? In an ordinary business bankruptcy , there is a firm division between secured creditors , those who extended credit against a guarantee or collateral , and unsecured creditors , generally suppliers of goods and services . Secured creditors are the ones most likely to get their money . But in the case of Orange County ' s investment pool , municipal bankruptcy law sets no priority between the competing claims of the Newport-Mesa Unified School District , with almost $ 80 million in the fund , Judge Margaret R . Anderson ' s retirement nest_egg and the special $ 8-million fund that had been set_aside to replace the county Fire_Department ' s aging fleet of trucks . Nor does_it distinguish between the managers of the $ 1.3-million fund to protect gnatcatcher habitat , Operation Santa Claus , which has $ 10 # 000 in the pool , and the Orange County Transportation Authority , with $ 1 billion on the line . All must fend_for themselves with few hard and fast rules_in an emerging battle over the $ 5.4 billion that remains in the pool . Already , scores of investors are exploring legal arguments in an attempt to show they deserve to recover more_than others who placed money with the county treasurer . &quot; There are lots of competing parties with competing demands . Unwieldy is perhaps too mild a term to describe what ' s happening , &quot; said professor Dan Schechter , a bankruptcy expert at Loyola Law_School in Los Angeles . &quot; There is a strong argument that there will be a hierarchy of creditors . But this is an area of new law . There is no set priority on anything . I mean , the county could end_up giving everyone a 27 % haircut. &quot; There are 187 governmental entities that have funds in the investment portfolio that Citron managed as well as thousands of individuals who invested retirement_funds and court settlements . Who eventually recovers money and in what amount will be determined largely by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and the county creditors committee , which was picked Wednesday by bankruptcy Trustee Marcy J.K. Tiffany . The panel is made_up of representatives from the fund ' s major institutional investors , including the Orange County Department_of_Education , the County Transportation Authority , the County Sanitation Districts , the Transportation Corridor Agencies , the city of Irvine representing all county cities , and the city of Mountain View , representing municipalities outside the county . The creditors committee is responsible_for developing a disbursement and recovery plan that is acceptable to the competing interests that sit on the committee , as well as a host of subcommittees . In addition , investors and creditors can ask the Bankruptcy Court to order the county to release funds or grant them priority for recovering their original investments . Bankruptcy lawyers anticipate that many of those involved will make their pitch to the creditors committee or the Bankruptcy Court . Complex negotiations to work_out compromises will also occur , they say . &quot; Circling the wagons is part of the game , &quot; said Richard Levin , who for 16 years was a bankruptcy attorney with Stutman , Treister &amp; Glatt , the Los Angeles law_firm now representing Orange County . &quot; You have a lot of people who have lost money or stand to lose lots of money . Of course , they are going_to fight. &quot; Under Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy statutes , all parties involved are supposed to be treated equitably , bankruptcy lawyers say . No one can be granted priority for removing funds or being paid unless the creditors committee or a bankruptcy judge agrees to it . &quot; Bankruptcy does not look_at deservedness or whether you invested voluntarily or involuntarily , &quot; Levin said . &quot; The fundamental principal of distribution is equality . If you have no collateral , you are part of the great unwashed. &quot; The lawyers also say it could very well turn_out that the losses are shared pro rata -- that is , everyone will lose a percentage equal_to what they had in the fund .</TEXT>
