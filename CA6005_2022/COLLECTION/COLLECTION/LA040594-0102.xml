   <HEADLINE> LAPD SLOW TO ENACT MANY CHRISTOPHER PANEL REFORMS ; POLICE : MONEY , BUREAUCRATIC SNAFUS ARE MAIN BARRIERS . OVERSIGHT COMMISSION SAYS COMMITMENT IS STILL STRONG .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dozens of Los Angeles Police_Department reforms recommended more_than two years ago by the Christopher Commission remain stalled by budget shortfalls , bureaucratic snafus , stalled labor negotiations and , in some cases , a lack of resolve , according to police officials and department documents . But members of the city ' s Police Commission and department insiders say that the push for reform has been reinvigorated in recent months , propelled by pressure from the commission and by a growing trust between department officials and the commissioners . &quot; There was some waffling in the beginning , &quot; Police Commission President Gary Greenebaum said . &quot; But we ' ve made clear that we will not be sidestepped on these issues , and things are starting to pop. &quot; The 100-plus recommendations of the Christopher Commission -- named for its co-chairman , Warren Christopher , who is now secretary_of_state -- have become the guiding document of the city ' s police reform advocates . They see it as the standard for judging the LAPD ' s willingness to respond to the communities it serves . As a result , the halting progress of the reforms has alternately encouraged and angered department critics . Among the reform proposals still not in place : * A recommendation that the LAPD more carefully track officers ' complaint histories , which the department proposes to do using a computer_system , has been stalled by budget hang-ups . Police_commissioners say they intend to break the impasse by funding the system out of their budget . * A proposal to add a civilian member to police disciplinary boards was approved by city voters , but it is opposed by many officers . Two years after voters backed the idea , it is still in the planning stages . * A department order dealing with a controversial practice of forcing suspects to lie on the pavement while they are searched still has not been distributed to officers , even though the LAPD said in late 1992 that it was forthcoming . &quot; People like myself are very disappointed in the pace of reforms , &quot; said Joe R . Hicks , executive_director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles . &quot; We have a chief who certainly sends a better message from the top , but this is a culturally entrenched bureaucracy that moves very slowly , that is very resistant to change. &quot; The reasons for delays are varied . In most cases , money is the chief obstacle . But recent analyses prepared by Police Commission staff also cite confusion about some proposals and the need to resolve personnel questions with the Police Protective League . In other instances , the holdups are the result of bungling : A much-heralded plan to install video cameras in some police_cars was set_back for almost six months even after cameras were donated because the Police_Department did not have enough tapes . Once the tapes were donated , officials could not work_out the logistics for picking_up the tapes and installing the equipment in police_cars . The pilot_project was finally launched about three weeks ago . &quot; It took a little while to get_it going , &quot; Police_Chief Willie L . Williams conceded recently . &quot; A few of us got gray hairs. &quot; Although that program is at last under way , other reform recommendations remain stalled . That concerns some department critics and some LAPD officials as well , and it has raised questions about whether the Police_Department is prepared to move ahead on the central recommendation of the Christopher Commission , retooling the LAPD so that its officers practice a more community-oriented style of policing . One telling example of the difficulties faced by reformers has been the struggle to build a computerized tracking system to monitor complaints against police_officers . The Police Commission has repeatedly approved creation of the system -- the Officer Behavioral Indicator Tracking System , known as OBITS -- only to be turned_away at City_Hall or to encounter resistance from police_officers who worry that OBITS will unfairly characterize their records . From the start , money has been at the heart of the debate . According to department estimates , the system would cost about $ 39 # 000 to get started . City officials , who oversee about 30 # 000 employees and an annual budget of nearly $ 4 billion , pleaded poverty . The LAPD , with 10 # 000 employees and a budget of more_than $ 500 million , also said it was too strapped to pay_for it . So despite protestations from department outsiders and the Police Commission , years went_by without any progress toward implementing OBITS . Now , in a gesture of frustration and determination , members of the commission -- whose staff of 63 consumes about $ 3 million a year -- say they are prepared to vote today to break the logjam by dipping_into their own funds and paying_for the system . &quot; That should send an important signal to this department about how important this is , &quot; Greenebaum said . &quot; We wanted to make this symbolic act. &quot; Although OBITS has , for some , become a symbol of the city ' s unwillingness to fully embrace the reform efforts , other proposals have been implemented and have substantially changed the way certain aspects of the Police_Department work . Most notable are the procedures for hiring and firing the chief of police . In the closing days of Daryl F . Gates ' tenure as chief , he and the Police Commission engaged in a divisive power struggle over the commission ' s attempts to oust him . But when Los Angeles voters approved Charter Amendment F in 1992 , they overhauled the system for hiring and firing the chief , as well as other basic aspects of department management . Unlike his predecessor , Williams was hired to serve a five-year term , renewable at the pleasure of the commission . And unlike Gates , Williams can be fired by the commission , with the concurrence of the mayor . Other significant changes have occurred as well . Among other things , improved cultural awareness training is taught at the Police_Academy , new procedures for background checks are being employed for LAPD applicants and supervisors are held to tough new standards when it comes_to the behavior of subordinates . All of that has heartened reform proponents . &quot; I think the reforms are going as well as can be expected , given that we have no money , &quot; Commissioner Art Mattox said . &quot; There ' s a real commitment to make these changes. &quot; But Mattox and other police officials acknowledge that much remains to be done . And most concede that the pace of reform slackened last year . The previous commission -- led by several outspoken reform advocates -- wound down its tenure over the summer , and some department officials waited to see in which direction the new commission headed . That uncertainty was magnified by the mayoral race , as Richard Riordan was conspicuously silent on the issue of police reform during the campaign . His decision not to reappoint any of the five commissioners and his appointment of Police Protective League President William Violante -- a well-known critic of Williams -- redoubled the sense that Riordan had little commitment to reforming the department . Once in office , however , Riordan and Violante took pains to emphasize the mayor ' s devotion to the reforms . &quot; The mayor is committed to implementing the Christopher Commission report , &quot; Violante reiterated last week . &quot; He ' s absolutely committed. &quot; Similarly , the new police_commissioners set_out from the start to demonstrate their resolve on the issue . Greenebaum was a leader of the Charter Amendment F campaign , and the other commissioners quickly joined him in pressing the department for evidence of progress . &quot; Initially many people in the department did not know where we were coming from , &quot; Commission Vice_President Deirdre Hill said . &quot; Now they understand. &quot; Deputy Chief Lawrence Fetters , whose candor has impressed commission members , acknowledged during a recent hearing that some critics blame the LAPD for dragging its feet . But he told the commissioners that he does not believe the department is resisting the changes . &quot; One could come_away with the impression that the department has stonewalled these recommendations , &quot; Fetters said . &quot; Quite the contrary , I find that everyone is fully supportive. &quot; Over the past few months , commission members have received oral and written briefings on the progress of the reforms -- a process that is scheduled to conclude this month . A review of those meetings and documents reveal that although more_than one-third of the recommendations are fully implemented , dozens more are not in place or only partially implemented . Take the area of training officers how and when to use force -- one of the central questions surrounding the Rodney G . King incident and the one that has underlain three trials growing out of it . Three years after that infamous altercation , the LAPD still has not completed a manual to revisit the issues of what force police_officers may use under what circumstances . That angers many officers , some of whom express confusion over what kinds of force are authorized and what kinds could lead to punishment , even prosecution . &quot; There are not clear-cut guidelines for officers in this area , &quot; said Danny L . Staggs , president of the protective league and a former training officer . &quot; that ' s created a lot of concern among the rank and file. &quot; Similarly , a Christopher Commission recommendation that the LAPD review its policy on &quot; proning out &quot; suspects -- making them lie on the pavement during searches -- was promised in late 1992 . &quot; A year later , the order is still ' in the review cycle , ' &quot; Police Commission staffers concluded . &quot; This is a critical issue , and the order should be completed and disseminated immediately. &quot; Although commissioners say the order should be released soon , the delay has baffled people inside and outside the department . In other areas , the explanations for inaction are all too obvious . Most times , it comes_down to money . The Christopher Commission recommended pay incentives to encourage officers to work patrol ; that would cost money , and no such bonuses have been offered . The commission recommended that probationary officers receive special instruction on verbal skills ; the department claims it would take 22 sergeants and $ 2.3 million to fully carry_out that recommendation , so it has languished . Other reforms would cost relatively little , but have met with different kinds of resistance . A proposal to put a civilian member on police boards of rights -- the department ' s chief disciplinary bodies -- concerns some police_officers and remains the subject of negotiations with the police union . And a recommendation to make easily understood , multilingual complaint forms available throughout the city has been only partially achieved . A recent commission audit found that the forms were available at only seven of the 29 sites and that Korean and Chinese versions were out_of_stock . Reform advocates credit the department with some positive steps_in the wake of the King beating , but they worry about how much remains to be done . Some question the LAPD ' s resolve when it comes_to carrying_out the remaining tasks . And they are particularly concerned about the implementation of community-based policing , a law_enforcement model that emphasizes crime prevention and community relations . &quot; What community-based policing is about is the cultural transformation of the LAPD , &quot; said Constance L . Rice , western regional counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund . &quot; That simply has not happened. &quot; Police Commission staffers have raised questions on that front as well . In their analysis of the LAPD ' s reforms , commission staffers note : &quot; The department ' s definition of and plan for community-based policing seems vague . A clear understanding of what community-based policing is and how it will be implemented should be communicated to department members. &quot; In December , Williams distributed a special order that for the first time spells_out the department ' s vision of community-based policing . Even that is mostly a blueprint and is short on specifics , and commissioners say the idea is being taught mostly by the example of a_few highly regarded department leaders . Deputy Chief Mark Kroeker , the popular commanding_officer of South Bureau , has aggressively pushed community policing , winning accolades from the commissioners . But they concede that more needs to be done to pass the message to the rank_and_file . &quot; Somebody like Mark Kroeker , it ' s his nature , &quot; Greenebaum said . &quot; He ' s the perfect guy to be doing this . But the ideas have to be written_down , institutionalized and implemented. &quot; None of that will come quickly , Greenebaum and others agree . But few now question the determination of the Police Commission to lobby for reform , and most observers express optimism that in time , the vast majority of the Christopher Commission recommendations will be put_in place . &quot; We will not be deterred , &quot; Greenebaum said . &quot; We consider this our primary public_trust , and we intend to carry it out. &quot; Reforming the LAPD In the wake of the 1991 beating of Rodney G . King , the Christopher Commission conducted an extensive review of the Los Angeles Police_Department , focusing_on issues that involved the use of force by police_officers . The commission produced more_than 120 recommendations for reform . Here is are some key recommendations and their status : * Recommendation : The chief of police should serve a five-year term , renewable at the discretion of the Police Commission only once . The commission should have the authority to fire the chief , with the concurrence of the mayor and subject_to an override by the City_Council . * Status : In place . Voters adopted the recommendations as part of Charter Amendment F . Chief Willie L . Williams was hired under those terms . * Recommendation : The Police Commission staff should include an inspector_general responsible_for overseeing citizen complaints and monitoring internal affairs investigations , among other duties . * Status : Commissioners have recently begun reviewing proposals for designing and filling such a position . * Recommendation : The department should try to put video and audio equipment in police_cars on an experimental basis . * Status : In place . Last October , DARE America donated 36 video cameras to launch a pilot_program . But the department at first could not buy enough tapes to make the system work , and then it struggled to install the equipment . The first ones were put_in cars last month . * Recommendation : The department should address problems created in minority communities by the unnecessary use of the &quot; prone out &quot; tactic , in which suspects are ordered to lie on the ground while officers search them . * Status : Chief Williams says a special order on the tactic has been prepared and is being reviewed . In its December , 1992 , update on the reforms , the department said the same thing , however , and no order has yet been disseminated . * Recommendation : The LAPD should adopt the community-based policing model and implement it , albeit carefully , throughout the department . * Status : In progress . Police Commission staff concluded that the LAPD &quot; definition of and plan for community-based policing seems vague. &quot; * Recommendation : Officers should be retested psychologically during their careers . * Status : Not in place . The department opposes this recommendation . KEEPING SCORE The Police Commission has monitored reform efforts . In its recent review the commission analyzed roughly 90 categories of recommendations -- and found that another 30 or so proposals had been carried_out . Of the 90 : * 28 are fully implemented . * 38 are partially implemented or are in place and being expanded . * 5 require negotiations with the police union before they can be implemented . * 19 have not been implemented , some for budget reasons , others because the department opposes them , among other reasons . Note : The above categories do not always reflect the department ' s official view . In some cases , the commission staff and department disagree , and in some cases the department calls reforms &quot; in_progress &quot; even though little if anything has been done to implement them .
