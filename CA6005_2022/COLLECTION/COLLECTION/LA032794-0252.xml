   <HEADLINE> JAMES FLANIGAN : A STABLE MEXICO STILL GRAPPLING WITH CHANGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Is Mexico chronically unstable ? Is there something really wrong there ? It may seem that way to many Americans and to even more worried Mexicans as the country has been hit with one breakout of violence after another , culminating last week in the killing of Luis Donaldo Colosio , the presidential candidate of the Party of the Institutionalized Revolution , or PRI , which has ruled Mexico for 65 years . The irony is that the PRI , set_up to represent a consensus of farmers , workers and other major groups , has ruled since 1929 in the name of stability . Now that stability is breaking_up because change , as it must , is coming_to an economy that has been run_on political patronage . For clues to what is really happening , look_at the Soviet_Union , another society that was ruled for seven decades by a single party and where today 15 separate republics are struggling with economic reality . Mexico ' s PRI , to be sure , has not been a vicious , totalitarian ruler like the Communist_Party . But just as the party in the Soviet_Union ruled every village and town through local bosses , so the PRI official in every town in Mexico had part ownership in most of the industry and power over practically all_the jobs . Mexico ' s industry for decades has been heavily state-influenced , and often state-owned . And the country has remained grievously underdeveloped . Fewer than 30 % of Mexico ' s people are even listed in the labor_force -- where more_than 40 % of most developed countries ' people are in the work_force ( the U.S. figure is 47 % ) . It has been an economy of farm labor and small manufacturing , with a river of subsidies from the central government keeping people in jobs but not really employed . Official statistics say that one quarter of Mexico ' s workers are underemployed . Still , coming_off a feudal_system of landed estates and serf labor that was overthrown in 1910 , Mexico knew spurts of progress . But the economy stalled out_in the 1960s . Change might have come then but oil was discovered in the Bay of Campeche . Mexico had an oil boom in the 1970s , at which time it also borrowed heavily from U.S. and international banks . Then , after world oil prices fell , Mexico had a spectacular bust in 1982 . that ' s when change began , with the economic modernization programs of President Miguel de la Madrid , who served from 1982-88 . There were 1 # 155 state-owned companies in Mexico when de la Madrid took_office ; today there are about 200 , and they are being sold into private hands under President Carlos Salinas de Gortari . Mexico ' s companies are being forced to compete with global industry -- a change underlined this year as Mexico entered the North_American Free_Trade Agreement with the United States and Canada . Change can be painful . &quot; This is the first recession in 50 years in which Mexicans actually lost their jobs , &quot; says Jorge Castaneda , a political_scientist and author who teaches at universities in Mexico and the United States . In the past , jobs were financed by tax_revenue . Now subsidies are being phased_out and there is pain in Mexican villages . Muttering is heard that Salinas ' market-oriented reforms , like those of Boris Yeltsin in Russia , are leaving the poor behind . Many Mexicans fear unrest in those villages . They recall Mexico ' s history after the 1910 Revolution , when the country was torn by bloody civil strife . The PRI was set_up in 1929 to bring an end to that strife . But such fears are overblown . Modern Mexico has been adapting to change for more_than a decade . The industrial improvement is_well along , helped by more_than $ 4 billion a year in foreign business investment -- part of a far larger annual total of foreign investment in Mexican stocks and bonds . The current hard_times result in part from the long recession in the United States , which is the best customer for Mexico ' s exports and also a haven for Mexican laborers who come north for work and send money back home . Now that the U.S. economy is growing again , Mexico will benefit . Still , questions arise . Why isn ' t Mexico growing on its own ; why haven ' t years of foreign investment created jobs to replace those displaced by reform ? The country wasn ' t ready to receive the investment . Mexico still lacks infrastructure for modern industry . The road where Colosio was killed was unpaved , as are so many roads in Mexico because successive governments have not made the necessary infrastructure investments . Instead money went_to subsidies . Agriculture was subsidized to keep food prices low for industrial workers in the cities . Poland , under communism , tried the same scheme -- which failed in Poland as it has in Mexico . Now both countries are trying to reform . In other ways , the Mexican economy never grew_up . Land was distributed to the peasants in 1910 but as a sacred trust . They couldn ' t borrow against it to set_up a business , nor could they sell their small holdings . So credit never grew , small business finance was stunted . A simple contrast to South_Korea and Taiwan speaks volumes . In those successful Asian economies , private industry has funded almost all research and development . Companies have developed technology and are globally competitive . In Mexico , private industry has contributed almost nothing to R &amp; D ; government has done the spending , but it has been an ineffectual pittance . But if all this is so , why are U.S. companies , and all_of world business , so interested in Mexico ? Because of the country ' s imminent promise . The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , noting the investments that have been made to modernize Mexico ' s economy , predicts surging growth for the country in the mid-1990s . The Mexican government has made some smart moves -- such_as investing 13 % of its budget in education . As a result , almost 90 % of Mexico ' s population is literate -- a far higher ratio than the United States . Mexico ' s 88 million people have the potential to become a tremendous consumer economy . Do the math . Mexico today has economic output per person that is only one-sixth of such smaller countries as Spain or New Zealand or tiny Ireland . Yet unlike those countries , Mexico has a special relationship with the United States thanks to NAFTA -- and that means open access to the world ' s largest market and flows of investment from the world ' s largest financial system . Is Mexico unstable ? No , it is going_through the pain of entering the modern_world economy , which may be less forgiving than the subsidized system of the past , but will be far more rewarding and more secure .</TEXT>
