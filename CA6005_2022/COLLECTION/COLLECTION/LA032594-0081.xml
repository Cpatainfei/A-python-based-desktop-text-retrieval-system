   <HEADLINE> ROAR OR SOAR ; * UNIVERSAL STUDIOS AND MAGIC MOUNTAIN DO BATTLE WITH TWO NEW ATTRACTIONS : JURASSIC PARK EXHIBIT AND BATMAN COASTER .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Batman versus Tyrannosaurus Rex . A clash of the titans ? A script only Hollywood could love ? No , a pair of attractions at Magic Mountain and Universal Studios , both of which are based on popular movies , both of which debut this Saturday . Call it : &quot; The super-hero and the dinosaur grapple for tourist dollars. &quot; In the foothills of Valencia , Magic Mountain has erected its most expensive coaster yet , the Batman ride , a twisting contraption that features a high-speed , suspended design . That means riders are strapped in from above with their feet dangling as they embark_on a dizzying succession of loops , corkscrews and turns . &quot; You can feel the blood draining from your head , &quot; said Bill Kern , an Anaheim coaster fan who took a preview ride and found this experience enjoyable . &quot; You can ' t really relate this to any other coaster . It ' s amazing the things they can do with the technology. &quot; The same might be said at Universal , where the tour celebrates its 30th anniversary with Jurassic Park -- Behind the Scenes . Steven Spielberg has donated his private collection of notes , models and gadgetry for an extensive peek at the Oscar-winning visual and sound_effects that went_into this box-office monster . The exhibit runs_through May and serves as a precursor for yet another film-based attraction , a Flintstones stage show that starts in June . As an opening act , Jurassic Park packs enough to entertain even industry-savvy locals . Housed in sound stage 29 , where much of the movie was filmed , it begins with the towering park gate . Smoky air and a rumbling score re-create the feel of the movie , while overhead lighting grids remind guests that this is a chance to look beyond the screen . &quot; We worked with Spielberg as far as which tricks he wanted to reveal , &quot; said Don Burgess , who produced the attraction . Such &quot; tricks &quot; garnered three technical Oscars earlier this week . &quot; Steven loaned us just about everything in his warehouse. &quot; That includes storyboards and continuation scripts , the blueprints for the film . Video monitors show everything from selected scenes -- with commentary -- to a discussion between the director and &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; author Michael Crichton . Even more impressive are the creatures themselves . A full-size velociraptor stands overhead . A brachiosaur pokes its immense head through a wall of brush . A triceratops lies on its side , breathing slowly . Later we learn that Buster , a pet dog , provided the breathing sounds for the film . * There is also a wardrobe display and a section on computer animation . In the control_room , guests sit at interactive computer panels and pretend to check the dinosaur park ' s perimeter fences and weather_forecasts . &quot; We want people to get a feel_for this , &quot; Burgess said , &quot; to understand how movies are made. &quot; The Batman ride , by contrast , seeks to extend the myth of the film . Magic Mountain is undergoing a multiyear renovation , dividing itself into themed areas . So the new coaster is surrounded by six acres of rusted mock factories and sooty tenement facades . &quot; It ' s the grime and decay , the greed and avarice of Gotham City , &quot; said Kevin Barbee , a park designer . &quot; It ' s a darker vision , something I don ' t think Disneyland would do. &quot; Guests file through a storm drain . Twists of industrial-gray track rise above this bleak landscape . From close proximity , the coaster ' s most noticeable features are its ski lift-style chairs . This configuration allows_for greater G-forces as the ride clatters at 50 m.p.h. through two outside loops -- traveling outside rather than inside the looped track -- and something called a &quot; heartline spin. &quot; &quot; We flip you 360 degrees while your heart stays_at relatively the same point . You feel as if you ' re floating , &quot; said Jim Seay , the coaster ' s engineer . &quot; So , during the loop you ' re hitting 4 Gs and then you come_into a 0-G spin. &quot; With no surrounding car and no floor , Batman offers a sensation of flight that is particularly vibrant for riders in the front seats . It is a surprisingly smooth , if not disorienting , journey . And it is over in a blurry two minutes as riders burst through a wall of steam into Batman ' s cave . that ' s the big ending that Hollywood craves .
