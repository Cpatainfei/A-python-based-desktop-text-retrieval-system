   <HEADLINE> JUDGE , IN STUNNING MOVE , VOIDS GRAND_JURY PROBE OF SIMPSON ; COURTS : JURIST SAYS PANEL HAS BECOME AWARE OF POSSIBLY PREJUDICIAL MATERIAL AND SEALS ALL RECORDS . PRELIMINARY HEARING IS SET FOR THURSDAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In a stunning and apparently unprecedented legal development in the O.J. Simpson double murder case , the supervising judge of the Los Angeles Superior_Court on Friday stripped the grand_jury of its role , closing_off a possible indictment of the jailed football legend . Judge Cecil J . Mills ruled that some people on the 23-member panel had &quot; become aware of potentially prejudicial matters &quot; -- presumably tapes of emergency calls to 911 in which a man identified as Simpson is heard screaming obscenities after kicking_in the door of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson ' s home . Mills issued the order after O.J. Simpson ' s attorney Robert L . Shapiro filed an unusual motion to halt the secret legal_proceedings . Citing the unique circumstances of a compelling case blanketed in media attention -- and saying he must &quot; protect the due_process rights of Mr. Simpson and the integrity of the grand_jury process &quot; -- Mills ended the panel ' s involvement in the case , sealed all related records and ordered jurors not to discuss any details about the case learned in five days of closed-door hearings . The latest , extraordinary turn_in the 13-day saga that has captivated the nation means that Simpson , who has been charged with two counts of murder , will proceed to a preliminary hearing scheduled to begin Thursday . The supervising judge , who took the unusual step of personally intervening in proceedings under the purview of other jurists , said he acted after conducting a personal inquiry , apparently interviewing grand_jury members . In nationally televised proceedings in which Simpson made his third court appearance this week , Mills said he found that jurors had been exposed to possibly prejudicial information &quot; not officially presented to them by the district attorney. &quot; One juror who requested anonymity acknowledged that he heard tapes of the 911 calls while watching TV at_home , and he believed that other jurors had too . But he said the tapes were never brought_up in the jury room , or among fellow jurors in casual conversation , at least in his presence . &quot; I would be surprised if there weren ' t any who did not see it , &quot; he said . &quot; The only way you could avoid it was not watch TV. &quot; Mills ' action followed a morning hearing in another court where Shapiro cited erroneous reports about a bloody ski_mask supposedly found at the crime scene as an example of law_enforcement creating innuendo about his client , who has pleaded not_guilty . Deputy Dist . Atty . Marcia Clark acknowledged in court Wednesday that no such mask was recovered . But on Friday she disclosed that &quot; a blue knit cap was found &quot; at the foot of one of the victims outside Nicole Simpson ' s Bundy Avenue townhouse . Clark accused Shapiro of grandstanding for holding numerous news_conferences and trying to win sympathy for the ex-football star by having his friend Robert Kardashian read what appeared to be a suicide note June 17 , while Simpson was a fugitive . With the case continuing to play_out in the free-for-all jury room of public_opinion as well as the staid courts of law , both sides put a favorable face on Friday ' s developments . Dist . Atty . Gil Garcetti called a news_conference to insist that the dismissal of the grand_jury was not a setback for his office . &quot; I don ' t see any loss , &quot; he said . But the balance of victory Friday clearly appeared to be Simpson ' s . His lawyers had been angling to avoid a grand_jury indictment , which would preclude a speedy preliminary hearing where witnesses and evidence could be challenged . Shapiro and his team want to gauge the strength of the case against the 46-year-old actor and sports commentator , who stands accused of killing his Nicole Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman in a knife attack the night of June 12 . &quot; We are very pleased the judge agreed with our position , &quot; Shapiro told reporters packed in the hallway outside Mills ' courtroom . &quot; We look_forward to finally presenting this evidence in a public courtroom . . . to hearing live testimony under oath from the witnesses. &quot; Later at a news_conference , Garcetti said that in his 25 years in the district_attorney ' s office , he had never heard of or seen the recusal of a grand_jury . He insisted that he initiated the process that led to Mills ' order , saying he did not learn of Shapiro ' s motion until half an hour after his meeting with Mills on Friday morning . Garcetti said he went_to the supervising judge about the same time Shapiro filed his motion because he was concerned about the pervasiveness of the coverage in the case . &quot; I did this because I ' m interested in justice , &quot; Garcetti said . &quot; I wanted to be sure the grand_jury proceeding was going_forward fairly. &quot; He said he was particularly concerned about heavy coverage of the chilling tapes of the 911 calls , even though grand jurors had been told not to view , listen to or read any reports about the Simpson case . Garcetti acknowledged that he had another motive as well . If the grand_jury issued an indictment , and later it was revealed that members had been exposed to prejudicial information , it could undermine the indictment , he said . Shapiro declined to discuss Garcetti ' s portrayal of the events . The grand_jury is scheduled to be disbanded Thursday , when its term expires . The judge ' s order applied only to the Simpson case ; the panel presumably will be allowed to conclude any pending work_on other matters . At times Friday , the already remarkable case appeared to be careening through a new zone of confusion and miscommunication . Superior_Court Judge Lance A . Ito , who heard the arguments on Shapiro ' s motion at a morning hearing , was not aware that Judge Mills , at that very moment , was holding another hearing to determine if the grand jurors knew things about the case that had not been formally presented to them by the district_attorney ' s office , Garcetti said . Ito and Mills did not return calls to their offices seeking comment . During the hearing before Ito , Simpson ' s team went_on the offensive . Shapiro accused prosecutors of misconduct in releasing information that he contended prejudiced grand jurors , including the release of the tapes of calls to 911 . &quot; Clearly , everything that was said on the tape . . . would be inadmissible , &quot; Shapiro argued . In court papers , Shapiro went_on to cite other examples of what he called &quot; prejudicial and improper expressions of personal opinions by prosecutors , and uncorrected false and misleading descriptions of evidence uncovered in the investigation of this case. &quot; Shapiro recounted Clark ' s categorization of Simpson as the sole murderer and Garcetti ' s speculation that the former football star might admit killing his ex-wife and her friend but would claim a defense similar to that of the Menendez brothers . &quot; The district_attorney ' s office has improperly released , and massive publicity has been given by the media , to inadmissible evidence in this case , the best example of which was the massive airing on virtually all television and radio_stations in Los Angeles of the 911 tape , &quot; Shapiro said . &quot; Before any charges were brought or conclusive tests could be run , the public was made aware of bloodstains on driveways , matching blood_types , bloody gloves and the alleged weapon that was revealed to be a military shovel that was later dismissed and called a knife , which has never been found , &quot; Shapiro argued in papers filed with the court . Simpson defense co-counsel and constitutional law expert Gerald F . Uelmen , appearing at Shapiro ' s side in Ito ' s courtroom , said &quot; the barrage of publicity &quot; surrounding the Simpson case has been &quot; unprecedented. &quot; But Clark said the district_attorney ' s office had done nothing improper . &quot; Robert Shapiro has lost no opportunity to exploit coverage in this case to get sympathy for his client , &quot; she said . &quot; He has been no stranger to the spotlight. &quot; Famed defense_attorney F . Lee Bailey said Friday that Shapiro and Uelmen consulted with him before filing the motion to dismiss the grand_jury . Bailey said the first case cited was a 1966 case he handled , Sheppard vs . Maxwell , involving Dr. Sam Sheppard . In that case , Bailey said , the prosecution &quot; repeatedly made evidence available to the news media that was never offered at trial. &quot; What Shapiro argued Friday , Bailey said , was that &quot; it ' s just as bad to do that with a grand_jury as with a trial jury. &quot; Shapiro also has consulted Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz on the case , Bailey said . The controversy over the release of the tapes , which has prompted outraged calls from the public to police and prosecutors , also continued . Garcetti said he was surprised by the release of the tapes and disagreed_with City Atty . James Hahn ' s decision to comply with news media requests under the state Public Records Act . Sources close to Hahn ' s office indicated that there had been some miscues . They said the city attorney ' s office -- before authorizing the tapes ' release -- thought that police had spoken with officials of the district_attorney ' s office , and determined that the tapes of calls to 911 would not be used in the current murder investigation , and could therefore be released . &quot; I think we thought that had been done , that this had been run_by them and that the D.A. ' s office had no problem with the release of the materials , &quot; said a source within the city attorney ' s office . &quot; I think we were given bad information by the LAPD. &quot; Officially , the Police_Department tartly declined to join in the finger-pointing . &quot; James Hahn ' s office can blame it on whoever they want to blame it on , &quot; said Lt . John Dunkin , an LAPD spokesman . &quot; The Los Angeles Police_Department has no further comment on the matter. &quot; But privately , police sources angrily placed the blame on their counterparts in the district_attorney and city attorney ' s offices . One said that police were vehemently against releasing the 911 tapes despite media pressure . The source said police officials asked the district_attorney ' s office to give them a good reason not to release them -- such_as the ongoing murder investigation -- but said prosecutors supported their release . Garcetti said that someone from the LAPD informed Deputy Dist . Atty . David Conn that the department planned to release reports from past incidents involving Nicole and O.J. Simpson . Garcetti said no mention was made of the explosive audiotape , and said Conn referred the police to the city attorney for advice on what they should release . Garcetti did not fault Conn ' s actions in the_matter . The release of the tapes -- one from an incident in 1989 , the other from 1993 -- also triggered speculation about why law_enforcement authorities had retained them , and whether they were part of some ongoing investigation of Simpson ' s turbulent relationship with his wife , which had prompted many domestic dispute calls to police over the years . But police and city officials said Friday that under the city ' s records retention schedule , audiotapes of emergency calls to 911 must be saved for a minimum 15 months before they can be reused . So the tape-recording of an October , 1993 , call from Nicole Simpson was in department storage , they said . The tape documenting her call during a 1989 incident came not from the Police_Department , which had destroyed its copy , but from the files of the city attorney ' s office , which keeps case records for a minimum of five years , department representatives said . The incident recorded was prosecuted by city attorneys , resulting in Simpson pleading no contest to spousal abuse . The grand juror interviewed by The Times could not say whether the tape had any impact on his colleagues , but said it had no effect on him . &quot; But I didn ' t understand it except you could hear him shouting in the background , &quot; the juror said . &quot; The quality of the tape was poor. &quot; The juror said that grand jurors were not admonished by their deputy district_attorney adviser not to watch TV . &quot; We weren ' t warned against it . . . . They told us not to watch any programs about the grand_jury activities . This was just news . It was a surprise to us when it came on. &quot; The juror would not say how close the jury was to an indictment , nor would he offer his opinion on the case . Asked about the evidence presented to the jury , the juror declined to discuss any specifics , but said : &quot; Almost everything that the jury knows has been reported in the paper . &quot; I would say if you read the papers , you know everything the grand_jury knows. &quot; The juror said that he was not polled by the judge before his decision to dismiss the jury . But the jury said that the judge ' s order was read privately to the jury before being read in the courtroom . &quot; It ' s a real relief to be off the case , &quot; the juror said . &quot; The character of the case was so distasteful. &quot; Asked why , he said : &quot; Because they were vicious murders . &quot; I ' m glad it ' s over. &quot; Times staff writers Leslie Berger , Frederick M . Muir , Richard Lee Colvin and Josh Meyer contributed to this story .</TEXT>
