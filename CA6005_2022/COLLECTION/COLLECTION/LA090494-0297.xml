   <HEADLINE> MAJOR CHANGES IN THE MINORS ; NEVER A DULL MOMENT ON BASEBALL ' S NEWEST FRONTIER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Step aside , Tim Fortugno . For years , the Cincinnati Reds ' reliever has lived with the ignominious fact that as a minor_leaguer he was traded for a gross of baseballs . At long last , Fortugno may live it down . Dave Maloney , general_manager of the independent Beaumont , Tex. , Bullfrogs of the first-year Texas-Louisiana League , last month traded three-dozen baseballs and a 35-inch bat for a pitcher . This undoubtedly qualifies as wondrous news for Fortugno and Maloney , but not necessarily for Zack Raney of San Francisco , the pitching chattel in_question . &quot; ( Raney ) had the 10th-lowest earned-run average in the league , &quot; Maloney said , gloating openly . &quot; It was a great trade. &quot; Wheel and deal , scratch and claw . Independent teams like the Bullfrogs , seeking a place in the minor-league milieu , are doing whatever it takes and then some to remain afloat . Operating without funding from major_league organizations , independents are breaking_out the bells and whistles in an effort to fill the stands . In many regions , legions of fans are turning_out to view the offbeat , novel product . For independent players , the leagues mean , well . . . . &quot; Never a dull moment , &quot; said Pete Kuld , a Chatsworth High graduate who plays in the independent Northern League . Independents are an amalgamation , a hybrid . The Valley region could soon join the independent fray if the proposed Golden State League , which hopes to place a team in the Antelope Valley , comes_to fruition next summer as organizers plan . According to reports , as_many as nine independent leagues may be operational by 1995 . Nine leagues staffed by players with nine lives . Independent players , often as not , are hoping for one last shot at climbing an organizational tree . It begins in the independent bushes , where for many , it will end . Kuld is an independent graybeard at age 28 . But experience must count for something , right ? A catcher for the Thunder Bay , Ont. , Whiskey Jacks , Kuld has walloped 26 homers to obliterate the league record of 17 set_in 1970 , during the league ' s first incarnation . In fact , he has broken the minor-league short-season record and still has one game remaining . As much as any player , he personifies what the independent Northern League is all about : Reclamation and rejuvenation . Generally , fans buying tickets to see a minor-league affiliate are watching players on the ascent . The majority of those in the independent ranks have been jettisoned or bypassed because they didn ' t make an affiliated team ' s organizational grade . Kuld played in four organizations and reached double-A with San Diego , Oakland and Texas . Yet he never played in more_than 75 games in a season . &quot; I felt I was never given a real opportunity in minor-league ball , &quot; he said . &quot; I ' m wearing this uniform because I still want to play in the major leagues. &quot; In 1992 , Kuld hit . 228 for the Texas_Rangers ' double-A affiliate in Tulsa and was released on April 1 , 1993 . When he signed with Cleveland in 1987 after his junior season at Pepperdine , Kuld gave himself five years to make_it to the majors . The itinerary has been severely modified . The ticket to the bigs is now open-ended . &quot; If I can put this uniform on every day , I ' ll keep running_around until they say I can ' t play anymore or my body breaks_down , &quot; he said . A break of a different sort would be welcome news . Independent players hope to be spotted by a big_league organization , which sometimes will purchase the player ' s contract and breathe new life into an inert career . Kuld has heard whispers that scouts from a_couple_of organizations , in dire need of help behind the plate , might be interested in his services . Nothing concrete , though . Other career paths end here . Former Dodger Pedro Guerrero , who plays for the Northern ' s Sioux Falls ( S.D. ) Canaries , also wants to be picked_up by a big_league club . The free-spending Guerrero , who pays_for his own plane_tickets in lieu of taking the team bus , said he might be the only guy in pro ball who ' s paying_for the privilege of playing . Not necessarily . Northern League players earn an average monthly salary of $ 1 # 000 , which doesn ' t go_far , even in the Dakotas . &quot; By the time you pay rent , food and all_the things you need to survive , we ' re all paying to play , &quot; Kuld said . Kuld isn ' t the only area player who is making_noise in a last-ditch effort to catch_on . Mike Hankins , a Simi Valley High graduate , is playing_at one of the northernmost pro outposts on the continent -- Winnipeg , Ont . His batting_average is among the northernmost , too . Hankins , an infielder for the Winnipeg Goldeyes who played triple-A ball for the New York Yankees , led the Northern League in hitting for much of the summer . Hankins is batting . 326 , third-best in the league . Kevin Farlow ' s playing career began with a bang when he was chosen City Section 4-A Division player of the year as a sophomore at Kennedy High in 1985 . Farlow , 25 , a shortstop who played in the San Diego farm system , is in his second season at Sioux_City of the Northern and is batting . 276 with eight homers . &quot; You have rookies who didn ' t get picked in the draft and they ' re hungry , &quot; said Farlow , a member of Cal State Fullerton ' s 1990 College World_Series team . &quot; Then you have guys like me , who had our taste of organized ball . &quot; We ' re just out here to have fun and win a championship . We ' re here because we love the game. &quot; Steve Morales , 23 , was one of the unwanted . Morales , a right-handed_pitcher from Cal State Northridge , missed his senior year because of elbow problems in ' 93 . Scouts were predictably disinterested . Morales ( 2-1 , 3.72 ) plays for St . Paul of the Northern League . Former Northridge teammate Greg Shockey , released by the Minnesota Twins , is batting . 316 for Duluth-Superior of the Northern . Duluth-Superior ' s Mark Skeels , a catcher from Thousand Oaks , is batting . 210 . Whle the independent ranks often represent the last outpost of baseball opportunity , there are reasons for optimism . Infielder David Waco , a Chatsworth High graduate who played_at UC Santa Barbara , is one of approximately 40 players who have used the Northern League as a stepping stone to affiliated baseball . Waco , 24 , played alongside Guerrero last summer at Sioux Falls before he signed with the Philadelphia Phillies in the spring . Waco , for one , thinks the Northern compares favorably with affiliated Class-A leagues , including the South Atlantic , where Waco started the 1994 season . &quot; I thought it was terrific , &quot; Waco said of his Northern experience . &quot; The ballparks were great , the competition was good and so were the fans . I had a blast. &quot; He hit a_few blasts , too , a storied part of Waco ' s wild independent ride . Sioux Falls staged a promotion last year in which a grand_slam hit during a predetermined inning meant a new car for a lucky fan . Waco came_to bat with the bases loaded in the long-ball inning and turned_to Guerrero , who was_on deck . &quot; I ' m going_deep , &quot; Waco said . He did , but the guy who won the $ 15 # 000 car didn ' t exactly dig deep to show his gratitude . &quot; He didn ' t give me squat , &quot; Waco groused . &quot; The next day , he drove right by me . He practically ran_over me. &quot; Waco ' s reward came later . He earns $ 1 # 200 a month at Class-A Clearwater , Fla. , roughly twice his salary in the Northern , he said . He is batting . 322 with 24 RBIs in 87 at-bats . To say the least , independents are using every promotional trick in the book to put bodies in the stands . Former big-leaguers like Dennis ( Oil Can ) Boyd , Leon Durham and Guerrero dot Northern League rosters , but the real theatrics are saved for between innings . The Northern ' s franchise in St . Paul , which boasts comedian Bill Murray as a part-owner , has a trained pig that brings baseballs to home_plate . And you thought Schottzie was a nuisance . &quot; It ' s a pretty famous pig , &quot; Kuld said , sarcastically . &quot; It comes_out and ( messes_up ) the field and it ' s really great. &quot; Predictable fare from team President Mike Veeck , son of the late Bill Veeck , who staged a_few promotional doozies in his time . At Sioux Falls , players throw balls at the headlights of an auto from 90 feet . If a player shatters a headlight , a fan wins cash . The spotlight , obviously , is_on entertainment -- particularly since independents can trot_out few legitimate big_league prospects . So they dazzle ' em with trinkets , baubles and atmosphere . &quot; At this level , it ' s 90 % promotion , &quot; Maloney said . Nothing beats the stunt pulled by the Sioux_City Explorers of the independent North Central League , though . In mid-summer , CBS talk_show host David Letterman sent one of his neighbors from New York City , Mujibur Rahman , on a tour across the heartland . Somehow , Letterman ' s producers talked the Explorers into allowing Rahman to suit up . He not only wore the uniform for one game , he was named starting pitcher , even though he ' d never played ball in his life . Sioux_City bullpen coaches gave him a crash course in pitching . When the starters trotted to their positions , Rahman , completely bewildered , ran to first_base . Redirected , he threw one pitch -- to the backstop screen -- and was mercifully relieved . Maloney , who worked for the proposed Golden State League for six months before taking_over Beaumont ' s front office in June , pulled a headline-grabbing stunt last month . Maloney scattered 750 baseballs across the outfield before a game and lined_up 250 fans on each foul_line . Somewhere in the outfield grass was a ball autographed by Beaumont Manager Charley Kerfeld . The whistle blew and a frenetic free-for-all ensued . A 17-year-old boy who found the autographed ball received a half-carat diamond pendant . Nice haul . &quot; I think he gave it to his mom , &quot; Maloney said . Moms , dads , sons , daughters . . . and geezer relievers ? Former big_league relief ace Juan Berenguer , 39 , is player-coach for the Minneapolis Loons and leads the independent North Central League in saves with 20 . Imagine Berenguer walking to the mound to make a pitching change -- while wearing a mitt . It lends new meaning to the coaching phrase , &quot; Gimme the ball. &quot; For Mike Teich , the credo was more like , &quot; Give me a chance. &quot; Teich took a flyer on a league that didn ' t yet exist . A left-handed_pitcher , Teich was released by the Pittsburgh Pirates ' organization after 12 appearances in 1993 , despite a respectable ERA of 3.50 and a 1-0 record . Late last spring , he got a call from Jason Felice , who like Teich attended El Camino Real High . Felice was player-coach of a team in the first-year Great Central League , and he asked Teich to join . Teich agreed and became a member of the Regina Cyclones , one of two Canadian entries in the six-team Great Central , another independent league . Canada , eh ? Truth be told , Teich wasn ' t sure where he was going and couldn ' t even recall the name of the league when first asked by his father . He didn ' t know Saskatchewan from Sasquatch . &quot; I knew_nothing about ( the league ) , &quot; Teich said . &quot; A guy called , gave me the information , and I said , ' Why not ? ' &quot; I went_into it totally blind. &quot; He and his mates have opened some eyes in the league , which pays players around $ 1 # 000 a month , Teich said . Teich ' s teammates at Regina include former Birmingham High standout Danny Larson and Master ' s College pitcher Mike Smith . Larson ranks second in the league in batting at . 333 and Smith is second in victories with seven . What ' s more , Felice hit a pair of homers in the season opener and leads the circuit with 15 . He may be the hottest hitter in pro ball . Over 29 games of the second_half , he has 12 homers and 50 runs batted in . Felice , 32 , is leading the league in the triple-crown categories with six games left . His closest competition comes from teammate Dennis Hood , who is right on his tail in batting average . &quot; Maybe I ' ll bench him , &quot; said Felice , who hopes to pursue a career as a manager . &quot; I ' ll rig it so I win. &quot; Nobody from Regina ' s 22-man roster has been picked_up by an affiliated club . that ' s OK with Teich , an assistant baseball_coach at Agoura High who will continue working toward a degree at Cal State Northridge at season ' s end . Unlike many in the independent ranks , he ' s actually looking ahead . &quot; Most of the guys want to hook_on , but I never really looked_at it that way , &quot; said Teich , who is 5-2 with an earned-run average of 3.81. &quot; I was just looking_for something fun for the summer. &quot; Independent ball has been a hoot for players and fans alike in dozens of instances . While the Northern has been the runaway winner in terms of notoriety and attendance , the eight-team Texas-Louisiana also has fared well . The franchise in Mobile , Ala. , has averaged a robust 3 # 105 and six of eight teams are averaging 1 # 400 or better nightly . Beaumont , the team Maloney was hired to resuscitate , is averaging 760 . Maybe it ' s the heat . Beaumont is about 30 miles from the sweltering Gulf_of_Mexico . Such are the outposts of independent ball . &quot; You know it ' s humid when you step_out of an air-conditioned car and your glasses fog_up immediately , &quot; said Maloney , who worked for the San Diego Padres for 21 years . &quot; You know it ' s humid when it ' s 95 degrees and raining. &quot; The independent barometer fluctuates wildly in many respects . Some leagues aren ' t exactly noted for their first-class accommodations . The Ohio-based Frontier League , in its second year , evidently is as Spartan as the name implies . Said former Frontiersman Travis Barbary , who now plays for an affiliated team : &quot; In the Frontier we had to drive our own cars . You were supposed to get money for gas , but they gave us coupons for Hardee ' s or something like it. &quot; Road hotels , which included a fraternity_house , were &quot; horrible . . . just terrible. &quot; All things considered , life in the wild Frontier still beat the alternative : A 9-to-5 job . Barbary ' s independent brethren undoubtedly would concur . &quot; Things like that made everyone pull_together , &quot; Barbary said . &quot; It was really , really fun . I had a great time. &quot;</TEXT>
