   <HEADLINE> DOW SLIPS AS TECHNOLOGY ISSUES DROP</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Blue_chip stocks closed slightly lower Tuesday , weathering a selloff in technology stocks that sent the Nasdaq market into a tailspin . Yields on Treasury_bonds fell and prices rose for the fifth time in the past six trading days after the Federal_Reserve_Bank bought government_securities to boost banking system reserves , in turn persuading others to buy . A government report of low wholesale inflation in March also provided a degree of support to the bond market , easing investor concerns about today ' s much-anticipated report on consumer prices . The dollar and gold rose slightly . The Dow Jones industrial average was down 7.14 points to end at 3 # 681.69 , while the Standard &amp; Poor ' s list of 500 stocks fell 2.30 to 447.57. In the broader market , declining issues led advances 1 # 242 to 876 on New York Stock_Exchange volume of more_than 256 million shares . The Nasdaq index , heavily weighted by technology stocks , was off 8.89 points at 739.22. Semiconductor stocks were hurt by a report of its industry association that said its so-called book-to-bill ratio was unchanged at 1.13 in March . That means that for every $ 100 of products shipped , manufacturers received $ 113 in new orders . Many analysts had expected a stronger performance -- from 1.16 to 1.2. The book-to-bill ratio is often taken by investors as an indication of demand in the entire technology sector , analysts said . If demand for chips is weak , the thinking goes , it must be elsewhere in the industry as well . The Labor_Department report that producer prices rose 0.2 % in March underscored the fact that any real inflationary pressures have not yet emerged in the economy , analysts said . The financial markets are watching the Labor_Department reports closely because the Federal_Reserve has nudged interest_rates higher twice this year to try to stop inflation from accelerating . The price of the Treasury ' s main 30-year bond rose 11 / 32 point , or $ 3.44 cents per $ 1 # 000 in face_value . Its yield , which moves_in the opposite direction , fell to 7.20 % from 7.23 % on Monday . Among the trading highlights : * Technology shares were battered on all markets . Motorola reported first-quarter earnings of $ 1.03 a share , up from 72 cents a year ago . Analysts had expected higher earnings , and the stock tumbled 4 1 / 2 to 95 1 / 2 on the NYSE . On Nasdaq , Intel lost 3 7 / 16 to 65 3 / 4 . Microsoft lost 2 1 / 4 at 84 3 / 4 , Micron Technology dropped 4 7 / 8 to 86 1 / 2 and Texas Instruments shed 5 5 / 8 to 73 . * McDonnell Douglas ' stock rose sharply in what analysts said was a reaction to a potential $ 400-million contract award to launch satellites for the Iridium space-based communications project . McDonnell ' s stock rose $ 3.375 to close at $ 111.75 on the NYSE . In other markets : * The dollar rose against most major currencies as traders shrugged_off news that White_House economic adviser Robert Rubin said the Administration is not trying to drive the yen higher against the dollar . Despite his comments , many market players still believe the Administration will back a stronger yen to help shrink the U.S. deficit if the market-opening effort fails . So they bid the yen higher . In London , the dollar rose to 103.55 yen . In New York , it closed at 103.65 yen , up from 103.45. * On the New York Commodity_Exchange , gold closed at $ 378.50 an ounce , up 60 cents . * Crude_oil prices finished lower after briefly flirting_with $ 16 per barrel . May delivery of light , sweet crude_oil settled at $ 15.75 per barrel , down 12 cents .</TEXT>
