   <HEADLINE> NATIONAL AGENDA ; STRUGGLING WITH THE ' TAJIK PROBLEM ' ; RUSSIANS STILL PROP UP THE CENTRAL ASIAN REPUBLIC , BUT THEY ARE ALSO FLEEING IT IN RECORD NUMBERS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> From the watchtower at Border Post 12 , a sentry scans the arid plain . A mile away on the horizon , shimmering in the afternoon heat , is the Pyandzh River and beyond it Afghanistan . &quot; The most volatile border in the world , &quot; said an aide to Tajikistan ' s head_of_state . Border Post 12 -- in fact , the entire Tajik side of the 750-mile frontier -- is commanded by Russians . Once the Soviet_Union ' s border , it is too vital to Moscow ' s sense of security to be abandoned to the newly independent and warring Tajiks . &quot; If we leave here , the war will follow us home , &quot; said Sgt . Vladislav N . Rodinov , 19 , the Russian who maintains the alarm_system that detects Tajik guerrillas from across the river as they approach a 10-foot-high border fence . Said Gen . Grigory A . Besmertny , &quot; This border is Russia ' s border. &quot; Three years after the Soviet_Union broke_up , Russians are still masters of this Central Asian republic , more so than anywhere else in their former empire . They prop_up the Tajik government , supply its currency , dictate its foreign_policy , bear the brunt of its guerrilla war . Russian diplomats help draft speeches for Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov . For all Moscow ' s clout , however , Tajikistan has become unbearable for most of the Russians who colonized , urbanized and industrialized it in Soviet days . In numbers exceeding those from any other former Soviet republic , the ethnic Russians are fleeing war , insecurity , economic hardship and nascent Tajik nationalism . Moscow ' s conflicting neo-colonial impulses -- to control this little country even as Russians abandon it -- have deepened Tajik resentment . In effect , Russian policy has reduced Tajikistan and its 5.5 million people to a military buffer protecting Russia from the chronic clan warfare , gun running and drug smuggling that spill_over from unruly Afghanistan , the violent arena that humbled the Soviet army in the 1980s . Even as Russian diplomats join in efforts to make_peace , many here believe that Russian military involvement has escalated the civil_war , which pits a ruling regional clan of Tajik Communists and their 8 # 000-member army against 5 # 000 guerrillas from rival Tajik clans led by democrats and Muslims . More_than 20 # 000 people have died in two years of fighting . &quot; Tajikistan was a beautiful , warm and friendly part of the world -- always enough food and never any bad words from the Tajiks until now , &quot; said Antonina A . Sofyanov , a Russian who came_to this country in 1939 at age 12 . Now 67 and fretful , she is trying to sell her garden apartment and vineyard in the best district of Dushanbe , the Tajik capital , for $ 1 # 000 in rubles , about what it will cost to ship her belongings to Russia by rail . Rubles are in such short supply that Sofyanov , still employed as a bookkeeper on the Tajik state payroll , has not received her salary since February . Her Russian husband last collected a monthly retirement pension in May . The couple decided to emigrate after she got_up one day at 3 a.m. to stand_in line for bread , only to have a Tajik insult her . &quot; Go_away and our life will get better , &quot; he snarled at her . &quot; All our problems are because of you Russians. &quot; &quot; The Russians built this country , &quot; Sofyanov said , recalling the incident . &quot; Now we have to go. &quot; Indeed , where a Muslim village stood 70 years ago , Russian emigrants founded the Tajik capital . They constructed one of the world ' s biggest aluminum plants , fueled it with Central Asia ' s most potent hydroelectric station and diverted the water through tunnels to turn the arid landscape green . &quot; Our first doctors were Russians , our first engineers , drivers , communications workers , scientists , writers , composers , &quot; said Sultan Mirzoshoyev , President Rakhmonov ' s chief_of_staff . The country remained so dependent_on Russians that their exodus is crippling the economy and public_services . Of the 500 # 000 Russians in Tajikistan before the civil_war began in 1992 , at least 320 # 000 have left , according to the Russian Embassy in Dushanbe . The exodus parallels the post-Soviet migration home of Russians from all_the new neighboring republics and is the largest reported from any of them . Many of the remaining 180 # 000 Russians here simply have nowhere to live or work in their homeland , which has a housing shortage and growing unemployment itself . To raise money for the next week ' s food , they set_up informal sidewalk bazaars to sell their clothing and other possessions . Outside the fortress-like headquarters of the Russian army ' s 201st Motorized Rifle Division in Dushanbe , a ragged Russian veteran of World_War_II was stooping by a garbage_dump , collecting severed fish heads in a plastic bag . The headquarters itself is a thriving imperial enclave within a poor colony . The Russian army , with its large complement of border troops here , is in the midst of a buildup and is one of the few institutions in Tajikistan that pays salaries on_time . Russia has 17 # 000 border troops here , backed by 6 # 500 soldiers of the 201st Division who guard factories , dams and other guerrilla targets . Having helped the Rakhmonov clan seize the government from its rivals two years ago , the Russian army now portrays itself as a neutral broker and defender of the border , striving to win U.N. endorsement and funding as a peacekeeping force . Privately , officers say their real mission here is to preserve Russian hegemony . &quot; Whoever comes_to power in Tajikistan must bow to us , &quot; said a Russian commander in Dushanbe . But other voices in Moscow are warning that Russia ' s patronage -- $ 70 million this year alone -- is not unlimited . The Russian Economics Ministry in Moscow , after first welcoming Rakhmonov ' s decision to stay in the &quot; ruble zone , &quot; has balked at the high cost of supporting Tajikistan and set conditions that may force Dushanbe to issue its own currency . Worried that the military buildup is not working , Russia ' s Foreign Ministry successfully pressured Rakhmonov to start peace talks with the opposition . Although the talks last month produced a temporary cease-fire , a final political settlement seems far away . &quot; I don ' t think the Russians particularly want to be the colonial masters of Tajikistan , &quot; said a diplomat in Dushanbe . &quot; I think they see Tajikistan as a black_hole . They have a commitment here that they would rather not have . . . . &quot; Moscow ' s ambivalence makes the shrinking Russian community here all_the more uneasy with its Tajik neighbors . Vladimir P . Kondur , a Russian scientist who has lived_in Tajikistan for 32 years , described with dismay how nine of his 11 Russian neighbors have moved_out of a Dushanbe apartment_building , giving_way , he said , to Tajiks who play loud music and let their children defecate in the hallways . &quot; They don ' t belong here . They ' re not cultured , &quot; he insists . For all_the complaints , Russian civilians have not suffered nearly as much as Tajiks in the war . They are no longer targeted or openly threatened by the guerrillas . In fact , opposition spokesmen say they now accept the need for long-term Russian border protection and other assistance . But even as they worry about the Russian exodus , Tajik authorities have resisted proposals to let Russians take dual citizenship , to restore Russian as an official language and to give Russians representational quotas in Parliament . Sergei L . Loiko , a reporter in The Times ' Moscow Bureau , contributed to this article . Rich History The Republic of Tajikistan , which declared independence from the Soviet_Union in 1991 , is in a region that has changed hands many times . The Tajiks are descendants of Iranian-speaking people who entered Central Asia as early as 2000 BC . They were incorporated into the Persian_Empire and later the empire of Alexander the Great . In the 10th Century , Turkic-speaking peoples overran Central Asia . Many Tajiks were assimilated then , with their culture surviving mainly in the mountains . Later , the Tajiks were brought under_control of the Emirate of Bukhara , then Afghanistan in the 18th Century and finally the Russian Empire in the 1860s . After the 1917 Russian_Revolution , the Red Army claimed most of the territory of modern Tajikistan . In 1922-23 , the Tajiks led an unsuccessful revolt against Communist rule .
