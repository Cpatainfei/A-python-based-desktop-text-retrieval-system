   <HEADLINE> PROFILE ; ANN-MARGRET FOLLOWS HER INSTINCTS WITH ' HEART '</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Ann-Margret doesn ' t like to repeat herself . &quot; I just don ' t like to do something I have done before , &quot; explains the five-time Golden Globe Award winner and former Oscar and Emmy nominee . &quot; I ' m instinctive and ( a script ) has to just grab me emotionally. &quot; Over the past three decades , Ann-Margret , 53 , has become one of the most versatile actresses in film and TV . She ' s portrayed such diverse characters as a sweet teen-ager in 1963 ' s &quot; Bye Bye Birdie , &quot; a terminally ill mother in the 1983 TV movie &quot; Who Will Love My Children ? , &quot; the fragile Southern belle Blanche DuBois in the 1984 TV remake of &quot; A Streetcar Named Desire , &quot; and a plantation matriarch in the 1993 CBS miniseries &quot; Queen. &quot; Two weeks ago , viewers watching the CBS miniseries &quot; Scarlett &quot; saw Ann-Margret as the glamorous Belle Watling , the madame and confidante of Rhett Butler . Her latest film , &quot; Following Her Heart , &quot; premiering Monday on NBC , finds her as a lonely , plain-Jane widow on a journey of self-discovery . On this rainy afternoon , Ann-Margret is relaxing on the floral couch in the living room of her impressive Benedict Canyon home , which she shares with her husband and co-manager of 27 years , Roger Smith . Also residing in the house are a 14-year-old Maltese named Sugar and a cat named Birdie . Ann-Margret is friendly and chatty , especially about the NBC movie . &quot; Following Her Heart &quot; finds her playing Ingalill , a Swedish woman who has been trapped in a loveless , arranged marriage for more_than 30 years . She was just a teen-ager when she married her older , stern husband Anders ( Morgan Sheppard ) . The couple moved from Sweden to North_Dakota . Anders spends most of his time lavishing attention on his pet parakeet while he keeps a tight rein on Ingalill . The only bright light in their marriage is their daughter Nola ( Alexandra Powers ) , who is married to a womanizer . When Anders dies of a heart_attack , Ingalill , who teaches piano and sings , decides to take a bus tour to Nashville so she can finally meet her longtime pen_pal with whom she has been writing songs . While on the tour she quite literally lets_down her hair and falls_in_love with a kind widower ( George Segal ) . &quot; Following Her Heart &quot; was directed by Oscar-winning actress-director Lee Grant , someone Ann-Margret has long wanted to work with . &quot; I met Lee seven or eight years ago , &quot; Ann-Margret recalls . &quot; She wanted me to do this thing I couldn ' t do because I was doing something similar ; I have always wanted to work with her . And this thing came_up . I thought it would be a good project. &quot; For many reasons . &quot; First of all , it is a Cinderella story , &quot; she says with a smile . ' But it ' s every woman ' s story . The writer ( Merry Helm ) , I don ' t now if you know this , is not a Hollywood person . She lives_in North_Dakota . It is her first screenplay . I really liked the script . I thought it was real charming . It ' s a fairy tale. &quot; According to Ann-Margret , Helm wrote it with her in mind . But Helm got Ann-Margret ' s native country wrong . &quot; She thought I was Norwegian , &quot; says Ann-Margret , who was born Ann-Margret Olsson in Valsjobyn , Sweden . Ann-Margret and her parents , Gustav and Anna , came_to America in the late ' 40s . &quot; All the names ( in the script ) were Norwegian . I said , ' If I do this , we will have to change all_the names. ' So they did that. &quot; Her mother also was very involved in the project . &quot; I am always joking that my mom should get screen credit for this because she coached the gentleman who played my husband , Morgan Sheppard , in his Swedish accent . She has a very strong Swedish accent , and , of course , I have lived with that accent all my life . So this is really the first time I have ever done a version of her accent in a film. &quot; &quot; Following Her Heart &quot; doesn ' t fit into today ' s usual TV movie fare -- it is not culled from the headlines and Ingalill is not the typical woman in jeopardy . &quot; It is just very moving , &quot; she says . &quot; The whole family can see this . I know a lot of people in the big cities can be cynical . But I think they can really breathe a sigh of relief if they see this . It is uplifting. &quot; And the message , she says , is a good one . &quot; It doesn ' t matter how old you are , you can do something for the first time. &quot; When Ingalill , who is nicknamed Lena by her vacation tour mates , leaves North_Dakota , it is the first time she ' s &quot; ever had her hair down , &quot; says Ann-Margret . &quot; The first time she ' s ever gone_in a restaurant . The first time she has ever really been in_love . The first time she has ever had makeup on . Everything is ' no ' to her . ' No , I can ' t do this . No , I can ' t do that , ' because that ' s the way it has been all_of her life . Now , everything is open_to her . She has never sung before people before . She never really had anything to drink before. &quot; Ann-Margret laughs.. &quot; One of my favorite things is when she is a little ( tipsy ) , she says , ' Slow gin fuzz. ' &quot; &quot; Following Her Heart &quot; also marks the first time Ann-Margret has sung in a TV movie ( who can forget her sing-alongs with Elvis on the big screen ? ) And she plays the guitar here . &quot; Roger was teaching me how to play the guitar , &quot; she says , laughing . &quot; You know how a man should never teach his wife how to drive ? Remember that ? I must say he was really sweet about it because he has been playing guitar all_of his life. &quot; What Ann-Margret found especially interesting about the project was that the film was &quot; about a woman . It was written by a woman , directed by a woman , one of the producers was a woman , the production manager was a woman . I thought_back to when I did ' Pocketful of Miracles ' in 1961 . There were just four women behind the scenes : the hairdresser , the wardrobe girl , the body makeup girl and a script girl . And on this , there must have been 40 ! It was incredible to see . We have come a long way. &quot; &quot; Following Her Heart &quot; airs Monday at 9 p.m. on NBC .</TEXT>
