   <HEADLINE> TIME TO ERASE TAPE FORMAT FROM POP REPERTORY ? ; MUSIC INDUSTRY : TOWER RECORDS BEGINS PHASING_OUT CASSETTES BY CUTTING INVENTORY AND REDUCING ORDERS IN ITS 87 STORES . OTHER RETAILERS DISPUTE IDEA THAT THE POPULAR FORMAT IS BECOMING OBSOLETE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Just five years after American pop fans said goodby to vinyl albums , one of the nation ' s showcase retailers says it is time to pull the plug on another contemporary pop trademark : cassettes . In a dramatic move , Tower Records , the first chain to usher_in compact_discs , has already begun slowly phasing_out the tape format by cutting cassette inventory and reducing orders in its 87 stores . &quot; The cassette is_on the verge of extinction , &quot; said Stan Goman , senior_vice_president of the Sacramento-based Tower chain , which expects to be completely out of the cassette business within two years . &quot; I may be a bit myopic , but the way I see it , prerecorded tapes are fast approaching the fate of vinyl. &quot; Other retailers , however , expressed surprise this week at Tower ' s decision -- and disputed the idea that cassettes are obsolete . &quot; We consider the cassette_tape to be an extremely viable product and anticipate it to be around for at least another five years , &quot; said Arnie Bernstein , president of the music division of Musicland , the nation ' s largest record retail_chain . &quot; Tapes don ' t have the same problems as LPs when competing with compact_discs . Cassettes offer consumers an economically priced portable medium unlike any other on the market. &quot; Mike Murray , vice_president and general_manager of the music division of the Ft . Lauderdale-based , 520-outlet Blockbuster chain , agreed . &quot; We have no intention of quitting the cassette business and would be more_than happy to accommodate any customer Tower turns away. &quot; Industry debate over the future of cassettes intensified in recent weeks as 1993 figures showed that cassette sales accounted_for less than 46 % of the recording industry ' s $ 9-billion business , down from 61 % five years ago . Last year ' s figure was an all-time cassette low since the tapes became popular in the late ' 70s -- down 8 % from 1992 , according to SoundScan , the research firm that tabulates computerized data for the music business . However , figures show , tape remains the configuration of choice for more_than half of the nation ' s rap and country fans and continues to dominate sales in mass merchant stores such_as K mart and Target . Tower ' s retreat from cassettes -- which represented only 20 % of the chain ' s ' 93 sales total -- is based on the stores ' unique position in the retail market , says Goman . The firm derives more revenue from catalogue sales than its competitors and specializes in classical_music -- a genre in which all but the Top 50 selling albums is no longer available on cassette . Goman says as tapes continue to lose ground to the compact_disc , record companies will stop manufacturing cassette versions of catalogue albums in pop , rock and other genres . He and other industry_analysts attribute the shift in consumer allegiance to the better sound , greater durability and ease of programming of CDs . The vinyl album disappeared , retailers say , because it could not compete with the superior home audio experience delivered by the compact_disc . Indeed , more_than 42 % of American households have switched from the turntable to the CD_player since the CD ' s advent in 1984 . But most consumers who purchase albums on cassette listen to them in cars or on portable players -- not at_home , recording industry surveys suggest . Although sales for CD car and portable players are_on the rise , few industry_analysts expect them to overtake rival cassette_players before the turn_of_the_century . So far , music fans have failed to respond to alternative high-tech formats such_as Sony ' s mini disc machine and Philips ' digital compact cassette ( DCC ) player . &quot; Portability and price are the two critical issues here , &quot; said Jay Berman , chief_executive_officer of the Recording Industry Assn . of America , the Washington trade organization whose member companies manufacture about 95 % of the recordings sold in the United States . &quot; People have grown accustomed to the relatively inexpensive price of Walkmans and until something comes_along to compete with that , I just don ' t see the cassette disappearing. &quot; But Goman feels other factors will also work against the cassette in coming months , notably the recent threat of price-slashing from discount_houses such_as Best Buy and_Circuit City , which sell Top 40 compact_discs below cost for $ 10 . Such competition is forcing record chains to reduce superstar CDs to $ 11.98 -- only $ 1 more_than the suggested list_price of top-line cassettes . &quot; The only way the record companies can save the cassette is to drop the price , but what do you think the chances are that they ' re going to do that ? &quot; said Goman , who intends to eventually replace cassettes at Tower with book , video and CD-ROM products . &quot; The only reason that tape is still a factor_in the U.S. is that the industry has yet to come_up with an economically feasible way to make compact_discs portable . Mark my words : When that day arrives , you can put a fork in it , mister , because it ' ll be done. &quot;</TEXT>
