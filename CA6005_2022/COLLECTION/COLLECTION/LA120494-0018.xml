   <HEADLINE> COMMENTARY ; ON-LINE AT_HOME : ONE MORE WAY TO KEEP A LOYAL FAN HOOKED</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> You ' ve just finished watching &quot; Melrose Place &quot; and would love to dish the dirt about Amanda ' s hairdo , wardrobe or skillful abuse of men . But office cooler chat is a long , bleak nighttime away . So you sidle_up to a source of instant gratification : the computer that will carry you into cyberspace to meet fellow &quot; Place &quot; junkies . Or fans of &quot; The Nanny. &quot; Or Mike Judge , creator of &quot; Beavis and Butt-head. &quot; Or Peter Jennings , who answered Election_Day questions via computer . Or talk-show host Greg Kinnear . Increasingly , on-line services such_as Prodigy , CompuServe , America Online and Delphi are helping TV networks open_up a brave new_world of marketing and promotion -- ummm , we mean communication . The Internet , a worldwide amalgam of computer_networks that is free to the public , is also abuzz with TV chatter . &quot; This gives a network an opportunity to build loyalty , to have a closer personal_relationship with viewers , &quot; says Prodigy executive Barbara Bellafiore Sanden , who oversees on-line services for about 40 cable and broadcast networks . And possibly attract more viewers ? The recent success of the science-fiction film &quot; Stargate &quot; has been credited in part to an aggressive on-line campaign . &quot; It ' s a little early to tell , but that ' s part of what we ' re all betting on : This is another promotional tool to cut_through all_the clutter out there , &quot; Sanden says . It ' s also , she notes , a way for networks to dip their toes into much-discussed interactivity , using computers for now instead of TV_sets . So-called &quot; bulletin_boards &quot; that let computer users talk amongst themselves are a longtime on-line staple . In the past year , a growing number of actors , producers and network executives have begun sitting_down for keyboard chats as well . Entertainment , as much as information , is the goal . Asked by one fan if he ' d ever had a paranormal experience , producer Chris Carter of Fox ' s &quot; The X-Files &quot; replied : &quot; I was audited by the IRS once . Beyond that , I ' d have to say no. &quot; Fran Drescher , star of the CBS sitcom &quot; The Nanny , &quot; offered this advice on breaking_into show_business during a recent on-line Q &amp; A : &quot; Start young , get_into a play ... or have a relative with the last_name Sheen or a brother with the last_name Baldwin. &quot; A producer or network may browse through bulletin_board comments to sample viewer comment . And it can be widespread : One &quot; X-Files &quot; fan logs_in to Delphi from the North_Pole ; others come aboard from Australia . &quot; What I get from it is a certain , immediate feedback from people who are watching the show , a visceral reaction to what we ' re doing , &quot; says Carter , a regular reader of computer chat . &quot; It ' s like going_to a good party and having a spirited debate , &quot; he says . &quot; There ' s a lot of fun , frivolous stuff out there , like the ' David Duchovny Estrogen Brigade ' and the ' Gillian Anderson Testosterone Brigade , &quot; ' Carter says , naming on-line fan clubs for his series ' stars . Networks are beginning to use information gleaned from the computer in decision-making ; Fox compiles a memo for department_heads based on on-line comments , says network executive Charles Kennedy . Networks also are pumping a stream of goodies and enticements out_to cement the bond between viewers and programs and , in some cases , to turn computer flow into cash flow . CBS , in conjunction with automaker Ford , created a Prodigy promotion for the miniseries &quot; Scarlett &quot; that included giving_away a free car . At this point , the on-line universe is small compared to the 98 % of U.S. homes with television . Prodigy , one of the leading on-line services , has about 2 million members , who pay $ 9.95 for five hours on-line and $ 2.95 an hour thereafter . But it ' s a potent group of consumers , claims Sanden : Members tend to be affluent and better-educated . And when they ' re sitting in front of their computers , not watching television , is that a network cause for concern ? &quot; I think this probably makes people more interested in television , &quot; says Matt Jacobson , a Fox executive responsible_for network Delphi activities . Perhaps the apogee of the Computer Age has come .</TEXT>
