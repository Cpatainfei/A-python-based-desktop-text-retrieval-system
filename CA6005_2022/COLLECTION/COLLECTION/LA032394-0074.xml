   <HEADLINE> COUNTYWIDE FOCUS : U.S. FUNDS SOUGHT FOR PIPELINE STUDY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Concerned with recent oil spills , Ventura County officials are seeking federal funds to conduct an inventory of local oil_pipelines to find danger_zones . &quot; Oil has always been a major issue in this county , &quot; Supervisor Maggie Kildee said during board comments at the supervisors ' meeting Tuesday . &quot; We need to get a handle on the pipelines . How old are they ? How long have they been in place ? &quot; Kildee directed Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg to secure federal funds for the inventory and return to the board with his findings . She also requested that Wittenberg form a panel with county officials and oil_company representatives to find ways to prevent future spills . &quot; It should be an interesting study , &quot; Wittenberg said . Over the past three months , three oil spills in Ventura County have raised questions about the reporting system that state officials and environmentalists rely_on to safeguard sensitive habitats . The latest spill , a 30 # 000-gallon mixture of light crude_oil and water , wound its way down a Santa Paula canyon and into the Santa Clara River on Saturday after overflowing from a Unocal storage_tank . In December , 84 # 000 gallons of thick crude leaked into McGrath Lake near Oxnard after a state park ranger and six other law_enforcement agencies ignored early reports of the spill . Bush Oil Co . executives admitted that a pipeline leaked for three days before it was noticed . And last week , local prosecutors served a search_warrant at a Texaco facility in Ventura , suspecting that the oil_company failed to report the true extent of a 370 # 000-gallon release of a petroleum byproduct . Officials with the state_Department of Fish and Game said they believe that the contaminant leaked from a ruptured Texaco pipeline near School Canyon Road north of Ventura . &quot; There are a lot of old pipelines people have forgotten about , &quot; said Supervisor Susan K . Lacey . &quot; Those are the ones we need to look at. &quot; TINA DAUNT</TEXT>
