   <HEADLINE> CAMPAIGN ' 94 : ISSUES AND ANSWERS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Three candidates are running in the Nov . 8 election to represent the 34th state Senate District . They are Democrat Donna L . Chessen of Garden Grove , Libertarian Thomas E . Reimer of Orange and Republican Rob Hurtt , the incumbent , of Garden Grove . &quot; Three Strikes &quot; Crime Law Chessen : &quot; I favor ' three strikes. ' It ' s a giant step toward telling criminals that there are mandatory consequences for breaking the law . I think there should be penalties at least as stringent for all crimes and , in some instances , I favor ' one strike and you ' re out. ' There certainly are other avenues we should pursue as well in the war against crime . I support crime prevention , education , rehabilitation and more police on the street . But none of it works without enforcing stricter penalties. &quot; Reimer : &quot; The ' three strikes ' initiative has many flaws in it . The basic reason for even proposing it is because most everyone is frustrated by our legal_system . We have an inconsistent system of punishment and retribution whereby violent crime is punished less severely than victimless_crime . If a murderer would be sentenced , and no parole given except in unusual cases , we would n ' t need a ' three strikes ' initiative . One ' strike ' would be enough as determined by a court . Crimes with victims should require compensation to the victims and their families by the perpetrator. &quot; Hurtt : &quot; In the Legislature , I was a co-author of AB 971 , the ' three strikes ' measure signed by the governor . I also fully support Prop . 184 , the ' three strikes ' measure that will appear on the ballot . Critics who contend we cannot afford this new law have been proven wrong . The Office of Planning and Research estimates the ' three strikes ' law will save the state $ 23 billion by keeping dangerous felons off the streets , where they were costing society lives and dollars . Additionally , I released a report itemizing how we can incarcerate more prisoners , saving billions of dollars. &quot; Save Our State Initiative to Curtail Benefits to Illegal Immigrants Chessen : &quot; I am sympathetic to the SOS proposal . Like many Californians , I am concerned that full implementation could increase public health risks and hurt innocent children . I am also concerned the measure could jeopardize billions of dollars in federal funds . However , it is my belief that the full SOS initiative will never be completely implemented . By the time it is sorted through the courts and the federal_government , some of the provisions will be modified or thrown_out . . . . The SOS measure will put the issue on the front burner and force the Legislature and the federal_government to meet their responsibilities . For that reason , I am inclined to support it. &quot; Reimer : &quot; I am opposed to the SOS initiative . The purpose is to eliminate the cost due_to illegal immigration . This may_not be accomplished according to some studies . It will become discriminatory and helps promote animosity toward other nationalities . . . . The best way to settle this problem is to eliminate the welfare_state . Encouraging people to receive benefits and entitlements causes poorer people to leave their country and come here only to collect from our system . This country was founded on a moral work ethic where anyone can become successful . I see nothing wrong with a more open border policy provided we require people to support themselves. &quot; Hurtt : &quot; I am fully supportive of Prop . 187 , the SOS initiative , because it is the only way the people of California can express to the federal and state_government that illegal immigration must stop . The initiative route is the final one we can take , as the federal_government has failed to relieve this mandate . Granted , this isn ' t the only wasteful spending in our government , but it is a good place to begin reforming how our valuable tax dollars are spent. &quot; Single-Payer Health Initiative Chessen : &quot; The single-payer plan on the ballot includes massive tax increases for businesses and wage_earners ; I can ' t support that . I would support health_care reform that provides all citizens with access to basic coverage without jeopardizing broader coverage for people who want it . No matter what the health_care proposal , however , we must demand that it produce better coverage , not additional bureaucracy and paperwork. &quot; Reimer : &quot; A single-payer health plan is a giant step toward socialism . The private sector has been proven to provide more service for the dollar than any government bureaucracy ever has . We definitely have flaws in the system . One problem is a legal_system overburdened by medical lawsuits . If we could encourage binding arbitration wherever possible , it would help . Another problem is deductibility of insurance_premiums is allowed only for corporations and large businesses , not for an individual or self-employed_person . Perhaps the biggest problem is the lack of competition in the medical establishment . . . . If more people bought their own insurance and paid_for their own care , they would be more responsible and selective in services. &quot; Hurtt : &quot; I strongly oppose Prop . 186 . This is perhaps the single most destructive initiative to ever appear on our ballot . The tax increase for this socialized system would be $ 40 billion -- the largest tax increase in any state ' s history . It is estimated that the payroll tax increase alone would cost California 300 # 000 lost jobs over the next four years . By socializing medicine and insuring everyone , regardless of legal residency , California would become a magnet for the uninsured sick for the entire country , and perhaps world . Our health_care system is not broken , so don ' t ' fix ' it. &quot; Future Uses for El Toro Marine Corps Air_Station Chessen : &quot; I support anything that would have the greatest ability to create jobs and turn_around our economy . I hope we can develop a new commercial airport and protect the rights of neighboring residents and local taxpayers while creating new jobs , businesses and revenue. &quot; Reimer : &quot; The El Toro base gives us an excellent opportunity to make Orange County a more productive area , and to help California business in_general . . . . I would like to see the land sold to private interests , for they would develop it more profitably with the best use of the land than any government bureaucracy would . A master_plan suggested by local_governments , including a commercial and / or private airport , is the best way to achieve this. &quot; Hurtt : As a state legislator , I have no jurisdiction over this matter . However , as a local business owner , I feel the ( commercial airport ) idea has merit . This option should not be ruled_out , as there could be great benefits to Orange County in terms of long-term business development and job creation opportunities . This project will ultimately have a major impact on our county ' s future and we must make the best decision possible as we plan to strengthen Orange County ' s role as an economic powerhouse in the next century. &quot;</TEXT>
