   <HEADLINE> JOURNEY ON THE INFORMATION SUPERHIGHWAY ; SIMPLICITY FOR THE MASSES ; THE FOCUS IS_ON MAKING INTERACTIVE SERVICES CHEAPER , EASIER TO USE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Nobody wants to maneuver through a computer maze just to watch a movie . But if the builders of the information superhighway package their services well , using them will be easier than driving to the neighborhood video store . Relatively few people use the interactive services that are already available because they are complicated , limited in capacity , costly -- or just boring . &quot; So_much of this information is around in written form now , but people don ' t use it , &quot; said Doug Patton , president of industrial design firm Patton Design in Irvine . &quot; The focus should be_on how new services can be used for greater simplicity , ease of use and personification of technology. &quot; Patton ' s firm has developed several remote_controls , including one for Time Warner Inc. ' s test of interactive services later this year in Orlando , Fla . Here are the main services that will be offered in Orange County this year and beyond . Some will be new ; others will be packaged more conveniently . MOVIES Surveys show that movies on demand -- being able to order any movie from a huge library and have it appear on a home screen instantaneously -- will be the most popular service on interactive TV . Consumers will prefer to watch programs at their leisure rather than search through 500 channels . Initial systems won ' t offer instant service . However , Pacific Bell will test a concept , dubbed near-movies-on-demand , in Milpitas this spring in which it will air recent box_office hits every half-hour . Customers will be able to tune to whichever channel starts showing the film at the time they prefer . Cable companies and DirecTv , which plans to offer 150 channels by satellite , are intent_on providing a similar service , designed as an alternative to renting movies from video stores . A key to success will be keeping prices low , said analyst Bruce Ryon at Dataquest Inc. in San Jose . Surveys show that consumers don ' t want to pay more_than the $ 4 average video-store rental fee price or more_than $ 20 a month for movies on demand . VIDEO_GAMES Besides movies , video_games seem to be a star attraction . Most cable-TV stations will offer the Sega Channel when it debuts this year . The channel will allow home users to download games through their TV_sets to their video-game systems . Sega will test its service in 12 markets first to iron_out its pricing structure . It will be available in Orange County and the rest of the nation this fall . For perhaps $ 15.95 a month , subscribers could access $ 2 # 000 worth of games , said Tim Bajarin , chief analyst of Creative Strategies International , a multimedia consulting_firm in San Jose . At first , the Sega Channel will only make games available ; it will not be interactive . Players won ' t be able to compete with each other long distance , mainly because the technology is not widely available yet for games to be played without tedious delays . Players can already square_off on multiplayer networks such_as Genie ' s Air Warriors . Johnny Wilson , editor of Computer_Gaming World magazine in Anaheim Hills , regularly squares_off on the Air Warrior multiplayer air combat game on his home computer . He has never met in_person most of his fellow pilots , but he meets them in cyberspace via computer modem . &quot; The interaction between humans is where the games become interesting , &quot; he said . &quot; You ' re playing against someone who is thinking . There are some phenomenal tele-communities on the networks . You even have the equivalent of roving gangs protecting their turf. &quot; ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION CompuServe and other on-line computer services have attracted more_than 4 million subscribers nationwide , partly because of a feature known as electronic_mail . Messages can be sent from one computer_screen to another instantaneously , allowing people to correspond without using &quot; snail mail , &quot; or regular postal_service . Such communication appeals_to many people who enjoy chatting with others far away under the anonymity of different &quot; handles &quot; used by citizens-band radio operators . Others see the potential for taking_part electronically in the democratic process by setting_up , say , interactive school_board meetings at which officials would receive and answer questions by E-mail . By the middle of 1995 , Pacific Bell will be offering videophone service to the first homes_in Orange County on its new fiber-optic network . Their usefulness will be limited , however , until large_numbers of people own them . Videophones are available now but send and receive their signals very slowly . Federal regulations do not allow phone_companies to provide video programming now , but several bills now moving through Congress would change the rules . Cable-TV companies also have plans to offer videophone service once they upgrade their networks . HOME SHOPPING Shopping by television now is tedious -- it can take hours for something to show_up on the screen that the viewer might want to order . But as screen navigation systems are developed and more channels are offered , viewers will eventually be able to peruse entire video catalogues at_home . Such service won ' t be available for a_few years until the networks have enough storage capacity for libraries of catalogues . INTERACTIVE MEDIA Thanks to Cable News Network and Headline News , viewers are accustomed to watching the latest events on TV around the clock . And America Online , a fast-growing on-line service with 600 # 000 subscribers , is already delivering the San Jose Mercury News to subscribers almost anywhere . Eventually , viewers will be able to pause the evening newscast in mid-sentence and skip to the next story if they want ; or pre-program the broadcast so that they receive only stories on a particular topic , such_as finance or sports . If such services can be offered at low prices , as advocates hope , almost everyone will be able to become a publisher . David Scott Lewis , an Irvine resident and editor of an electronic magazine distributed on the worldwide computer_network known as the Internet , hopes eventually to offer an electronic magazine with video images . Right now , the network can accommodate only text_files and still pictures .</TEXT>
