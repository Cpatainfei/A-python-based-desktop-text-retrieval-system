   <HEADLINE> GARDEN FRESH ; GINGER : THE UNDERGROUND SPICE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> This morning , chatting with a friend about ginger , she mentioned that she took a hand of ginger and . . . . I ' d forgotten that wonderful expression , &quot; a hand of ginger. &quot; Squint your eyes and the plump root with many stubby branches might conceivably be a hand , but that asks_for poetic_license . Considering the value of a hand , ginger ' s license is granted . Ginger ' s sweet , hot , catch-in-the-throat pungency is indispensable , after all , around the world . Ginger was born in the tropics and its complex flavors blend well with the simple flavors relished in hot climates . Ginger with crab and shrimp . Ginger with white-fleshed fish and pork . Ginger with dried legumes -- central to India ' s vegetarian cuisines . Ginger with almost every fruit and vegetable on Earth . When ground dried ginger found its way to cooler climates , its brilliance in baked_goods was discovered ( this was little known in the not-big-on-baking tropics ) . I can ' t imagine life without gingerbread . As a girl , I baked it every Christmas for years , pouring the fragrant batter into molds shaped like butterflies and Christmas_trees , ginger boys and ginger girls . One Christmas after I grew_up , I replaced powdered_ginger with grated fresh -- glorious . * Besides its heavenly ways with flour , ginger has special affinities for garlic , cilantro and chilies . Bruce Cost , the knowledgeable writer on Asian cuisine , notes this in his book &quot; Ginger , East to West &quot; ( Addison-Wesley ) . One of the things this collection of delightful recipes and lore taught me is that when ginger ' s skin is thin , you needn ' t peel it . Another -- it had never occurred to me -- is that I can dry thin peeled slices of mature ginger in the sun , then grind them in the blender for ultra-fresh spice . Ginger is a handsome plant . The bright green leaves are long , flat and narrow , and their thin round stalks grow three feet tall , like some kind of bamboo . The leaves have a wonderfully gingery flavor too , and they ' re a big reason why I grow the plant . I slice thin ribbons of young leaves and add them to salads and fruit cups , toss them in stir-fries , and use long ribbons to tie bundles of snap_beans or slender leeks or skinny wedges of zucchini -- a pretty presentation . We also wrap chunks of sea_bass in young ginger leaves , fix them with a bamboo skewer and grill them , making a packet that is entirely edible . Sometimes in spring , ginger bears small yellowish flowers touched with purple , but they ' re infrequent and indifferent blooms . They are edible , however . In recipes , the petals of one ginger flower can be substituted for one tablespoon of chopped root . ( By now , some of you must be wondering why I ' ve called ginger a root when it ' s a rhizome -- a fleshy stem that sends shoots_up and roots down . Well , I agree that it ' s a rhizome when I ' m thinking_of it as part of a plant , but when I ' m cooking , like most people I think_of it as a root. ) * Being native to the tropics , ginger revels in warmth but not blazing sun , humidity but not soggy soil -- and the soil must be super-rich in humus and well-drained . You can start your plants with ginger rhizomes from an organic produce stand ( those from the supermarket may have been treated not to sprout ; to be absolutely sure of a crop , buy rhizomes from a nursery ) . Choose pieces that are plump and fresh with lots of little knobs , which are the sprouting points . Although fastest growth is from plants started in early spring , rhizomes grow all summer long . For each plant , use a knobby piece the size of a large egg . If cut , let the cuts dry , then set the piece knobby side up in moist rich soil or compost just beneath the surface . Warmth speeds growth , so I start the rhizomes in a pot and set it by the stove . I water the soil well , then cover it with a_few inches of straw or coarse leaves -- something light that lets_in air but conserves moisture . Until there are sprouts , I water only enough to keep the soil moist . When sprouts appear , the pot goes_in our warmest sunniest corner -- whether indoors or out , depending_upon the time_of_year -- and I remove the mulch . When leaves are growing vigorously , the plant needs lots of water ; the soil must be kept just this side of wet . Feed ginger with a weak fish emulsion monthly . To create a gingery environment , pile heat-gathering rocks around a patch in the warmest part of your garden that gets sun in the morning , then bright shade the rest of the day . Add humidity to the air with a_couple_of inches of ground bark around the plant . Wave the hose fitted with a misting nozzle over the plant and mulch every morning , and in the afternoon too , if the air is dry . * If your garden is frost-free , you can grow ginger in the ground the year around . For a hedge of ginger , which is lovely behind tuberous_begonias , set plants a hand ' s-breadth apart . If you get frost , either grow plants in the ground through summer , then pot them up and bring them indoors for cold_weather , or grow your ginger in a pot from the start . Ultimately each plant needs a container 15 inches wide by a foot deep -- about 1 3 / 4 cubic_feet of soil mix , which must be rich and fast-draining . In a slightly bigger pot , you can give ginger a brilliant border of impatiens ( Busy Lizzie ) . Give ginger in pots the same situation in the garden as in the ground . Ginger grows well indoors , given light , warmth and humidity . The kitchen and bathroom are the moistest rooms in the house , and a cozy sunny spot in one of them is ideal . For added humidity , set the pot on a large tray of pebbles several inches deep , with water just below the surface . Another reason I grow ginger is to harvest it at the baby stage . Whereas the skin of the ginger at the supermarket is tan and papery , baby ginger ' s is translucent and sheer . The flesh of mature ginger root is fibrous , but baby ' s is succulent . The older the roots , the more their bite and snap , so baby ginger tastes mild as May . In China , young ginger is sliced_into coins or matchsticks and stir-fried as a vegetable on its own . Given its wants , ginger races -- you can be harvesting baby roots in three to four months . But before then , if you grow several plants , treat yourself to a handful of ginger shoots -- snip them at a_few inches and toss with snow_peas in a stir-fry . For larger roots with deeper flavor , wait at least five months or up_to eight or nine months to harvest . Plant a piece of the root and start the process over . * As a deciduous perennial , ginger goes dormant in winter , its leaves dying_back . At that point , keep the plant warm , but only give minimal water until early spring , when you ' ll water and wait as before . Your harvest of ginger root will stay_fresh for several weeks in the refrigerator ' s vegetable drawer . Wrap it in a paper_towel and tuck it in a plastic food bag ( the paper_towel absorbs moisture that might produce mold ) . My friend of the ginger hand freezes small pieces and then grates them still frozen , since the ginger will turn mushy when thawed . I keep nuggets of peeled ginger on reserve in a jar of Sherry in the refrigerator -- they stay plump indefinitely , and the tipple adds warmth in cooking . Perhaps the best way to keep ginger is to candy it , then dip it in bittersweet_chocolate . It lasts ages in an airtight box . Right . Sources Fresh : There are mature roots in every supermarket -- buy the plumpest . Look_for baby ginger in Asian markets from early summer to early autumn .

It may be prepared hours in_advance , adding the garlic before serving . To serve with something not steamed , cook unpeeled garlic_cloves in simmering salted water until tender , about 15 minutes , then peel and press into the sauce . Steaming is one of the leanest and most satisfactory ways to cook fish -- it ' s certainly the fastest and easiest . You ' ll need a heat-proof 9 1 / 2-inch plate that ' s 3 / 4-inch deep . Set the plate on a large Chinese steamer or cake rack over a wok , or directly in an 11-inch skillet that ' s about 2 inches deep . Pour 1 inch of hot water in the wok and 1 / 2 inch of hot water in the skillet . Bring to a boil , reduce the heat until the water simmers , lay_in the fish , then cover and start timing .
