   <HEADLINE> NEWS ANALYSIS ; THE CREDITS AND DEBITS OF KATHLEEN BROWN , TREASURER ; POLITICS : SHE IS SEEN AS INFORMED , VIGILANT . BUT MUCH OF HER RECORD RESTS_ON ECONOMIC FACTORS BEYOND HER CONTROL .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> When Kathleen Brown was running_for state_treasurer four years ago , she unleashed a withering attack against her predecessor , Tom Hayes . Speaking with her own blend of charm and tough-minded confidence , she turned their televised 1990 debate into a death blow to Hayes ' election chances . She blamed him for a &quot; backlog &quot; of billions of dollars in un-issued state bonds ; for earning a lower interest_rate on a multibillion-dollar pool of state money than earlier treasurers ; for the political activities of his chief_of_staff , and for his failure to rid the state ' s largest pension_fund of hundreds of millions of dollars in junk_bonds . Now , four years later , Brown is running_for governor with the theme &quot; America ' s best treasurer to revive America ' s worst economy. &quot; But just how good a treasurer has Kathleen Brown been ? And how does she compare to her predecessor ? Brown claims to have breathed new life into a lethargic branch of government . &quot; What I am most proud_of is reviving the treasurer ' s office from what had become a sleepy bureaucratic backwater and making_it a leader in financial management and prudent but proactive investment strategies , &quot; she said in a recent interview . Yet measured by the same standards that she held Tom Hayes to , her record is decidedly mixed : * There continues to be a backlog of approved but un-issued state bonds -- $ 6.2 billion as of March 31 -- whittled_down from the $ 7 billion figure that she used to bludgeon Hayes in 1990 . However , the Brown-era gap could double if voters approve the $ 5.9 billion in bonds on the June ballot and perhaps more in November . In fact , there is always a delay , sometimes of several years , between voter approval and bond sales , no matter who is treasurer . * Earnings on investments have plummeted , because interest_rates generally have dropped . Today , the $ 26-billion pool of idle state and local_government funds is earning only about 4.5 % . In the Hayes era , a smaller pool was earning returns of more_than 8.5 % . Brown now boasts that the $ 4 billion earned in her first three years is &quot; a state record. &quot; But in a three-year span , her immediate predecessors earned close to $ 5 billion . In her attack on Hayes , Brown charged that Orange County ' s $ 7.5-billion investment pool had outperformed the state fund . That continues to be true now that Brown is managing the state ' s portfolio . * Brown charged that Hayes ' top deputy , the late B.T. Collins , was actively involved in running his campaign . However , soon after she was elected , she named her own campaign manager and onetime fund raiser , Beverly Thomas , as assistant treasurer . Although it is common for politicians to name campaign aides to high posts , sources say that Thomas was instrumental in starting_up Brown ' s race for governor . Thomas denies any campaign role and says she is only one of many to whom Brown turns for political advice . * Within months of taking_office , Brown kept her campaign promise and pushed the Public Employees ' Retirement System board to sell_off $ 434 million in high-yield or &quot; junk &quot; bonds . The $ 80-billion fund liquidated the bonds , taking a $ 50-million loss . Some board_members concede that the loss could have been reduced if the pension system had held the bonds longer . &quot; You never know how the market will turn_out , &quot; said board_member Charles Valdes . Brown ' s claim to being &quot; America ' s best treasurer &quot; -- a flourish of campaign rhetoric -- is based on an award she received last year as one of the country ' s &quot; most valuable public officials &quot; from the now-defunct bimonthly newspaper City &amp; State . Among earlier winners was Los Angeles County Chief Administrative Officer Richard B . Dixon , who was forced to resign from office under a cloud a_few years later . Former City &amp; State editor Ellen Shubart credits Brown with bringing vigor and innovation to her elected office . But in an interview , she expressed surprise at Brown ' s claim . &quot; I would hesitate to say that any one who won any award was the best , &quot; Shubart said . As treasurer , Brown serves as the state ' s banker -- cashing the state ' s checks , investing idle funds , and borrowing money by issuing bonds to operate state_government and build offices and highways . She also sits on the boards of the mammoth public employees and teachers retirement systems , as well as dozens of other boards and commissions . It is an important job and it carries with it the power to award millions of dollars in state business . And yet , in many respects , the performance of the treasurer ' s office is outside the control of the officeholder . Return on investments and bond interest_rates rise and fall with the economy , and are affected by decisions about the state ' s budget hammered_out in the Capitol between the governor and the Legislature . Key operations of the treasurer ' s office -- investments and bond sales -- remain in the hands of civil_servants installed in their jobs by the late Jesse Unruh , who piloted the office into the modern era . Brown has nonetheless claimed credit for &quot; historically low interest_rates &quot; on state bond issues , even though those rates reflect a nationwide drop during her brief tenure in office . &quot; It ' s like Willard Scott taking credit for the weather , &quot; said Gov . Pete Wilson ' s campaign press secretary , Dan Schnur . In her campaign ads and in press_releases , Brown also has been crowing about the jobs created by the $ 12 billion in bonds she has sold in her 40 months in office . However , as treasurer , Brown merely sells the bonds . Each bond issue must first be approved by the Legislature and governor -- and often requires a vote of the people as well . She also has taken credit for defending the state ' s credit rating -- avoiding a drop from AAA in her initial year in office during the first of a series of state budget crises . She has met regularly with the New York-based rating agencies ever since , describing the financial problems facing the state , but with less success . All three major rating agencies have taken California bonds down a_few notches . Standard &amp; Poor ' s now ranks California as A + -- near the bottom of the states . No one suggests that the fall from the highest rank is Brown ' s fault . &quot; A lot of the story for the state of California has been the recession , &quot; said David MacEwen , who manages government_bond portfolios for the Benham Group , a mutual_fund that buys a sizable volume of state bonds . &quot; There ' s no way to correlate that with her job as treasurer. &quot; Those who do business with her office -- underwriters , investors and credit rating agency representatives -- praise the 48-year-old Brown for her knowledge , accessibility and strong appointments to key posts . In an interview , Brown spoke with authority about the functions of her office and the continual need for vigilance in protecting the interests of taxpayers , particularly when dealing with the investment_bankers who sell the state ' s bonds . &quot; Bankers run_on a fear and greed continuum , &quot; she said . &quot; If you neglect the fear ( of losing the state ' s business ) , the greed takes over. &quot; Among her accomplishments and innovations : * Dedicating a portion of the $ 26 billion in idle state and local funds she controls to investments in California home mortgages and small businesses . Calling it the Cal-Vest program , Brown has directed $ 695 million to purchase California mortgages -- enough for 5 # 000 homes and apartments -- and $ 80 million to cover loans for about 200 small businesses , most of them in the Los Angeles area . * Changing the way the state borrows money each year to tide it through periods of cash shortages . Instead of borrowing all_the money at a single flat rate , she has borrowed a portion at a lower , variable rate . Last year , when the state borrowed $ 2 billion in this way , taxpayers saved several hundred_thousand dollars on the deal . In other years the savings has been as much as $ 4 million . * Spreading_out the treasurer ' s office bond sale and investment business to include firms headed by minorities , women and disabled veterans . State law sets a goal of 23 % of bond sale fees going_to such firms . Last year , Brown saw_to_it that 21 % reached the targeted businesses . Brown , like Hayes before her , boasts of making the selection of underwriters on major bond issues &quot; competitive , &quot; although only certain bonds are sold to the highest bidder among competing syndicates of investment_bankers . In other cases , Brown chooses among competing firms after reviewing qualifications , but without any formal bidding . In one such competition by qualifications , Brown replaced Bank of America with New York-based Lehman Brothers as the managing underwriter on the annual short-term note sales . Over three years , the winning firm managed the sale of $ 20 billion in notes and collected $ 6 million in fees for its efforts . In 1991 and again in 1992 , many of the largest investment banking firms in the country submitted statements of their qualifications along with estimates of their fees . Treasurer ' s office records show that the Lehman Brothers ' estimates were higher than Bank of America and several other competitors both years . And campaign records show that Lehman Brothers ' West Coast managing director , Catherine Pfeiffenberger , personally contributed $ 4 # 000 to Brown ' s campaign from 1989 through 1992 . Neither Pfeiffenberger nor a Lehman Brothers spokesman would comment on the firm ' s efforts to win state business . Brown vigorously defended Pfeiffenberger and Lehman Brothers and denied that contributions played a role . &quot; She ' s one of the best bankers in the business , &quot; Brown said . When Brown announced her decision to return the business to Bank of America after a similar competition this year , she declared , &quot; I am continuing my commitment to keep California dollars working for us here at home. &quot; If it was important to place the business with a California firm , why had she taken the business away from Bank of America three years ago ? Brown said that she shifted the business because the bank &quot; had not done a good job. &quot; &quot; I ' m a strict grader , &quot; she said . &quot; I ' m very tough on investment bankers. &quot; Brown was the first California treasurer to hire an outside firm as financial adviser on bond deals , making the selection after reviewing qualifications from a number of competitors . The business went_to Public Resources Advisory Group -- a firm that has done similar work across the country . Generally , investment_bankers contacted by The Times said that the firm has performed well . The firm and its principals contributed $ 11 # 900 to Brown ' s campaign -- much of it before the firm got the state ' s business . Despite her generally mild demeanor , Brown has exhibited a scrappiness at times -- some would call it peevishness -- in dealing with critics . In one case , the issue was College Saver bonds -- which Brown has touted in press_releases and public statements as a &quot; carefree &quot; way to save for a child ' s education . She has sold $ 70 million of the bonds , which were first marketed by her predecessor . A number of financial planners contacted by The Times are critical of such bonds when used by families to save for a young child ' s college education . These experts say there are other long-term investments that stand a better chance of keeping_up with college costs that have been rising twice as fast as the general rate_of_inflation . &quot; Generally speaking , particularly with very young children , investors need to assume considerably more risk , &quot; said Jonathan Pond , a Boston-based financial planner and author . &quot; I hate to be cynical , &quot; Pond said , &quot; but it ' s a way for states in weakened financial situations to raise money from the unsophisticated investor. &quot; But in 1991 , when Peter A . Roberts of the College Savings Bank of Princeton , N.J. , took_out ads attacking Brown and the College Saver bonds with similar arguments , the treasurer lashed_out at him . ( Roberts was making a pitch for federally insured certificates_of_deposit sold by his bank that are pegged to a college cost inflation index. ) Brown personally sent letters to publishing executives urging them to stop running the ads she found offensive . Newsweek pulled one of the ads . But the Wall_Street Journal told her in a letter that &quot; our readers are astute enough to make their own decision. &quot; An angry Brown scrawled the words &quot; wimp out &quot; across the letter , according to her testimony in a related court case . In the same case , she was asked what her reaction was to Roberts ' ads . Responded Brown , &quot; It made me really grumpy. &quot; * Times research librarian Maloy Moore also contributed to this story .</TEXT>
