   <HEADLINE> JAPAN LAWMAKERS ELECT HATA PRIME_MINISTER ; POLITICS : NEW LEADER EARLIER WARNED NATION OF INDIRECT TAX INCREASES EXCEEDING PLANNED INCOME_TAX REDUCTIONS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Former Foreign Minister Tsutomu Hata , 58 , a self-described &quot; coordinator &quot; whose lack of enemies made him the only candidate acceptable to the myriad parties of Japan ' s coalition , was elected prime_minister today by the lower house of Parliament . With 274 votes , Hata won by a margin of 23 votes , against 207 for Yohei Kono , president of the opposition Liberal Democratic Party who , like Hata , once bolted the LDP . Communist Chairman Tetsuzo Fuwa got 15 votes , and six other votes were invalid . Seven lawmakers were absent and two seats are vacant . Despite haggling within the &quot; rainbow &quot; coalition during both the last three months under former Prime_Minister Morihiro Hosokawa and a 14-day post-resignation power and policy struggle , Hata polled 12 more votes than Hosokawa received last Aug . 6 when the first coalition since 1948 was voted into power . On Sunday , Hata warned taxpayers that future increases in indirect_taxes will exceed planned reductions in income_taxes , ultimately raising the overall tax burden in Japan . In an interview with the Nihon Keizai newspaper , Hata said new revenue sources are needed to cope_with the aging of Japan ' s society , in which more retirees will have to be supported by a smaller work_force . Despite a $ 57-billion decrease in income and residential taxes , enacted in March and due_to be extended , a larger overall tax burden is inevitable , he said . Increasing deficits in the budget to fund the income_tax cuts would be dangerous , he added . Hata ' s remarks , which put a priority on budget-balancing , contrasted with requests from Clinton_Administration officials , who have been prodding Japan to cut income_taxes as an economic stimulus to promote imports . But in other interviews , Hata promised to reduce government regulations &quot; to help open markets and create new industries. &quot; Hata also said that now is not the time to revise laws to enable Japan to implement any sanctions imposed against North_Korea . The U.N. Security_Council has threatened such action to punish the Stalinist state for impeding inspections of its nuclear facilities . Foreign Ministry officials earlier said that amendments of existing laws would be necessary to halt the flow of at least $ 600 million a year in remittances from Japan to North_Korea -- an action that U.S. Defense_Secretary William J . Perry said last week would be &quot; one of the most important elements of sanctions &quot; against North_Korea . The new prime_minister was to form a new Cabinet today . Its first task will be to launch parliamentary deliberations on the 1994 budget that is already three months behind schedule . The deliberations , however , won ' t begin until May 9 . A chain of national_holidays -- what the Japanese call &quot; Golden Week &quot; -- begins Friday and ends May 5 . Most businesses plan to shut_down on the non-holiday days of May 2 and 6 to give employees 10 days_off in a row , including the weekends . Despite a 10-point platform that coalition party deputies hammered_out Friday after seven days of bitter debate , Hata will face a major challenge in dealing with a split that pits his own Renewal Party , Hosokawa ' s Japan New Party and the Buddhist-backed Clean Government Party against the Socialists , former Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura ' s New Party Harbinger and the middle-of-the-road Democratic Socialist_Party . Although Takemura said his 15-member group would vote for Hata for prime_minister , he warned that his party will not automatically vote for bills that the Cabinet submits to Parliament . The party boycotted negotiations on the new platform . By the end of June , the new prime_minister must enact the budget , win an agreement on a major overhaul of Japan ' s tax_system and come_up with a sweeping economic program to fulfill a promise to the United States to substantially reduce Japan ' s $ 141-billion global trade surplus , including a $ 60-billion imbalance with the United States . Hata said Sunday that he would present the economic program , as scheduled , to President Clinton when they meet in Naples , Italy , at a July summit of seven major industrialized nations .</TEXT>
