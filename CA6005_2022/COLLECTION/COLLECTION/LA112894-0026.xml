   <HEADLINE> SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOICES / A FORUM FOR COMMUNITY ISSUES : COMMUNITY ESSAY ; ' LANGUAGE KEEPS RACISM ALIVE ' ; DICTIONARIES AIM TO CLARIFY WORDS . BUT SOME SEEMINGLY ORDINARY DEFINITIONS MAY FOSTER UNCONSCIOUS RACIAL BIAS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> While sitting at the computer , having finished the task at_hand , I decided to explore the word-processing program . I started looking_up words and stumbled on ethnic . I had learned this word years ago , but had eliminated it from my vocabulary , though I had kind of forgotten why . The reason became apparent when the meaning came_up on the screen as &quot; heathen , &quot; an uncivilized , unreligious person . Part of the justification for enslaving Africans was that church authorities labeled them heathens . When Europeans began exploring , they discovered other people in the world , all_of whom were people_of_color . European scholars did not equate these people as being equal_to them , so they labeled them &quot; ethnics. &quot; This is still a common practice . This same terminology is used in today ' s major universities : ethnology , ethno-history , ethnomusicology , ethnic arts . Next I typed in black . To my amazement , I discovered it defined as &quot; forbidding , menacing , threatening , evil , wicked &quot; and more . This could explain why many people may have negative attitudes toward black people . Thumbing through the Dictionary of Word Origins , I looked_up negro , a term formerly used for African Americans . To my surprise , the book said &quot; see denigrate , &quot; which was defined as &quot; to physically turn something black. &quot; This myth , which claims black people are cursed , was erroneously thought to come from the Bible and was the main rationale for the enslavement of African people . My exploration then prompted me to call_up white , which was defined as &quot; morally and spiritually pure , innocent , harmless , free from evil , Caucasian , &quot; and , according to Webster ' s New World Dictionary and Collegiate versions , &quot; a member of an ultraconservative or reactionary political group. &quot; Several folks might get a laugh out of those definitions . But when the laughing stops and reality sets_in , one has to consider the futility of this kind of terminology . If white people are taught this kind of vocabulary from cradle to grave , how can they fail to develop a false sense of superiority ? Generation upon generation will pass this mistaken assumption on to_the_point where it becomes second nature . Similarly , when African Americans are taught the same vocabulary , a sense of inferiority , hopelessness , and &quot; to hell with society , I am going_to be as destructive as possible &quot; can set_in . Couple that with being taught that black people have done nothing of worth , and that blacks are nothing , and you have set_up a very volatile future . Racism is a mental_illness . Many of us fall victim to it because the language we use keeps it alive , in many instances , unconsciously . The challenge we face is to make a conscious effort not to allow rotten language and concepts to be part of our behavior . Words hurt , especially when they perpetuate negative attitudes toward a group of people because of the color of their skin . The excuse &quot; I didn ' t know that , &quot; no longer holds_up . When unsure of a particular word , we can do what our parents and teachers told us and look it up in the dictionary . But we must also keep_in mind that even the dictionary can subscribe_to the tenets of racism . Our scrutiny must be constant .</TEXT>
