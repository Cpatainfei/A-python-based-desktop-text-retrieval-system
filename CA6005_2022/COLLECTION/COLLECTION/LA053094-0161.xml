   <HEADLINE> HIRING MORE POLICE IN HOUSTON PAYS OFF AS OVERALL CRIME_RATE IN CITY PLUMMETS ; LAW_ENFORCEMENT : MAYOR , OFFICERS CLAIM COMMUNITY-BASED APPROACH WASN ' T WORKING . THEY SAY MORE COPS ON THE STREETS MEAN MORE ARRESTS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> These days , Mayor Bob Lanier sits comfortably in his City_Hall office , his black Western-style boots plopped on his desk and a stack of charts and graphs in his lap . He likes to talk statistics ; he revels in numbers , and he can spin_off facts about Houston as fast as a Texas tornado . But there is one statistic he cherishes most : The city ' s overall crime_rate has plummeted more_than 30 % since he was elected three years ago . Lanier credits the sharp decline not to &quot; new-fangled ideas &quot; such_as community-based policing but to hundreds of newly hired police_officers whose sole purpose is to go_out in uniform every day and make arrests . &quot; I don ' t look_on police_officers as social_workers , &quot; he said , espousing ideas that run counter to what other big cities , such_as Los Angeles , are trying to do . &quot; I don ' t expect a police_officer to go_to a neighborhood and figure_out a drainage problem or a ditch problem . I expect him to do police work. &quot; Down the street at police_headquarters , Police_Chief Sam Nuchia is equally plain-spoken . &quot; When I took_over , &quot; he said , &quot; we quit using the terminology ' neighborhood-oriented policing. ' Instead I declared that we were going_to make_it as tough on the criminals as we possibly could. &quot; Just a_few years ago , before Lanier and Nuchia moved_into their jobs , Houston was considered a model for community policing -- a concept that has caught_on in other big cities looking_to rebuild public_trust in their police_departments . While Los Angeles is only slowly implementing the program as recommended by the Christopher Commission after the 1991 beating of Rodney G . King , Houston officials claim to have learned the hard way that the effort never really paid_off . The perception here is that instead of reducing crime , community policing fueled a deep resentment among officers , did little to boost the public ' s trust of the police and ultimately cost the two biggest champions of the policy -- the police_chief and the mayor -- their jobs . Houston never had an episode as divisive in police-community relations as the King case . But there were past controversies nevertheless . A Latino man drowned after he was handcuffed by police and forced to swim in the bayou . A &quot; throw-down &quot; weapon was planted on a suspect after he was shot by police . To turn the tide , Houston in 1982 brought_in its first outside police_chief , who also happened to be its first minority chief , just as Los Angeles did_in hiring Willie L . Williams from Philadelphia in 1992 . Lee P . Brown , who served as Houston ' s chief until 1990 , made neighborhood-oriented policing a hallmark of his administration . It was designed to make police_officers more aware of community concerns , to get them out of the patrol_cars and into neighborhood meetings and other civic ventures . Proponents say it works best when officers walk their beats , meet residents and business owners and enlist the public in crime-prevention efforts . Brown was followed by Chief Elizabeth Watson , a 20-year veteran who stayed until 1992 . She embraced many of Brown ' s programs , but her tenure was troubled . Because of the oil bust in eastern Texas and the subsequent economic downturn here , the city under then-Mayor Kathryn J . Whitmire put a freeze on the hiring of officers , closed the police_academy and did not grant police pay raises . The police , in turn , began ridiculing neighborhood-oriented policing , saying that its initials actually stood_for &quot; Nobody On Patrol. &quot; Morale sunk and senior officers began leaving for other cities where old-fashioned police work was still practiced . When Whitmire lost to Lanier in the fall of 1991 , police_officers unfurled a banner downtown proclaiming : &quot; Ding , Dong . The Witch Is Dead. &quot; &quot; The previous administration was penny-wise and pound-foolish , &quot; Nuchia said . &quot; They saved money on the budget , but they also allowed the strength of the department to go_down at a time when we needed it most. &quot; Watson , who now preaches community policing as chief of police in nearby Austin , Tex. , said her administration did not fail rank-and-file police_officers . She said she was only trying to inject new ideas that would enhance the city ' s crime-fighting efforts until the economy recovered . &quot; Community policing makes us all better crime solvers , &quot; she said . &quot; We develop information in the community . We develop technology and communication with the public . We can do more things in the long_run so that we don ' t have to keep going_back to the same crime scene. &quot; Lanier , a wealthy businessman , ran_for mayor on a promise to beef_up the police ranks . &quot; That was the only campaign issue , &quot; he said . He was elected in November , 1991 , and one of his first appointments was Nuchia , then an assistant U.S. attorney who earlier had worked as a junior police administrator in Houston . Almost immediately they froze their predecessors ' plans to expand community policing , such_as putting officers in &quot; storefront &quot; substations around the city where they would be more accessible to residents . Lanier , in_order to reopen the police_academy and start hiring officers , scuttled a proposed downtown monorail system and saved $ 50 million . &quot; That was a goddamn Tinkertoy , &quot; he said . He said he picked_up another $ 50 million by restructuring the city ' s debt and saved $ 50 million more by improving its revenue-collection system . So far , the department has grown from 3 # 900 sworn officers to 4 # 800 . Now Lanier is seeking a four-cent sales tax to boost the force to 5 # 200 officers . From 1991 to today , murder and rape each dropped 15 % , according to Police_Department statistics . Robbery was down 22.5 % ; theft down 25 % ; burglary down 41.2 % , and auto theft down 42.5 % . Even with aggravated assaults up 12.5 % ( the only category to see a rise ) , the total crime_rate dropped 30.3 % . In addition , police response_times to crime scenes shortened , from 6.1 minutes on major calls to 4.4 minutes . Police morale , meantime , went_up , particularly when Lanier and Nuchia found two small pay raises for officers . The chief and the mayor suggested that Los Angeles , which appears to be going_in the opposite direction , also might be_better served by increasing its police_force before embarking_on new community programs . &quot; I don ' t want to tell them their business , &quot; Lanier said , &quot; but I think they have a big problem . They don ' t have enough police . that ' s going_to strain any additional duties . It ' s going_to strain things. &quot; In last year ' s campaign , Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan pledged to add 3 # 000 police_officers in four years , a promise he has since trimmed to 2 # 855 in five years . So far , however , attrition has canceled_out much of the new hiring . Nevertheless , Riordan ' s LAPD expansion plan calls_for the bulk of the buildup to occur in the last three years of the five-year program . Recently , the City_Council approved the addition of 450 officers as part of Riordan ' s proposed 1994-95 budget . But even in Houston , not everyone credits the team of Lanier and Nuchia with reducing crime . Stephen L . Klineberg , a sociologist at Rice University here , said other factors , such_as the turnaround in the local economy , can do more to halt crime than just adding police_officers . He added that the public ' s fear of crime rises when cadres of officers are seen on the streets . &quot; There ' s no evidence that more police automatically reduces crime , &quot; he said . &quot; If you have more police , you report more crime and so arrests go_up . And if you target one area of the city with more police , crime just moves to another area. &quot; In contrast , he said , a community working with its police can bring_about an overall sense of security that cold crime statistics cannot . &quot; Community police makes a lot of sense , &quot; he said . &quot; If you know you have a police_officer . . . in your neighborhood working to reduce crime , that goes_a_long_way to satisfying your fears. &quot; Laura Virgadamo and Tiny Allison , both active in a neighborhood association in the historic Houston Heights area , said they believe that adding police_officers is actually the best community policing available , simply because more police can answer more calls . Virgadamo said she moved from the suburbs back to the inner_city because she believes that the added police presence makes the city safer . And Allison , who coordinates a citizens patrol to support the police , said she is amazed at how much faster the police_cars respond . &quot; We used to have to wait hours , &quot; she said . &quot; Once , I waited four hours for a police_officer after a car was stolen . They were all too busy. &quot; In the North Loop area of the city , the Rev . Robert Jefferson , a school_board member and chairman of COMAC ( Coalition of Ministers Against Crime ) , recently called a meeting to discuss the last_day of the school_year next month . In past years , numerous fights and stabbings , even drive-by_shootings , had broken_out when school let_out for the summer . Police found themselves overwhelmed with problems . Tensions are again high this year , especially since a 14-year-old Latino gang member was stabbed to death and another youth was shot in a gang_fight at a Houston theme park . Eleven uniformed officers and an assistant police_chief participated in Jefferson ' s meeting , mapping out strategy on how to protect the schools this year . They promised an impressive show of force , and the ministers were clearly pleased . &quot; The more blue we have , &quot; Jefferson said , pointing to the uniformed officers , &quot; the stronger we will be. &quot; The night before , as a crowd of gang members and other mourners attended the wake for the youth who was stabbed , a phalanx of patrol officers and undercover detectives kept watch across the street . The officers said they believed that it was their presence that kept a rival gang from driving by and shooting the mourners . &quot; Things are pretty good right now , &quot; said Officer Damian Garcia , a young patrolman who came_on the force three years ago , just when Lanier and Nuchia were beginning to reinvent the Houston Police_Department . &quot; Things are not out of control . We ' re not running to shooting after shooting. &quot; His colleague , Officer Robert ( Bobbie ) King , who works the police gang detail , agreed . He said he was a young patrolman here when community-based police was all_the rage , and he didn ' t like it . &quot; The mayor wants us out now writing tickets and patrolling the city , &quot; King said . &quot; And that beats neighborhood policing . That didn ' t work . Not here in Houston . Not as long as we didn ' t have enough officers to get our crime down first. &quot;</TEXT>
