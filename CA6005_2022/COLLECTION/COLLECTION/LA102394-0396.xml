   <HEADLINE> THE WORLD ; THE NORTH_KOREAN NUCLEAR DEAL : MISTRUST -- AND VERIFY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Four months ago , North_Korea ' s nuclear ambitions set the country on a direct course for confrontation with the United States . Today , if all goes according to plan , the accord reached last week between Washington and Pyongyang may well be a breakthrough that , as President Bill_Clinton said , will help achieve &quot; an end to the threat of nuclear proliferation on the Korean Peninsula. &quot; But the roller-coaster history of dealings with Pyongyang , coupled with its reluctance to pursue reconciliation with South_Korea , suggest another possibility : Charlie Brown ( the United States ) , again persuaded by Lucy ( North_Korea ) that she will hold the football upright so he may kick_off , learns yet again that Lucy is all too eager to pull the football away at the last second . The accord , fleshed_out with a secret side note , is a framework of phased-in steps for freezing and eventually rolling back North_Korea ' s nuclear-weapons program . It also contains a package of economic , political and security benefits that the United States and its allies would give North_Korea in exchange for ending its quest to build bombs . As with most such agreements , however , the_devil is in the details , and some of them are disconcertingly vague . Specifically , the United States would arrange for an international consortium , largely paid_for by South_Korea and Japan , to replace North_Korea ' s plutonium-producing graphite reactors with more proliferation-resistant light-water reactors , at a cost of about $ 4 billion . In addition , Washington would take the lead in meeting North_Korea ' s oil needs during the 6- to 10-year interval required to install the new reactors ; lift its trade_embargo against Pyongyang ; open a liaison office in the North_Korean capital as a first_step toward full diplomatic relations , and provide assurances against the threat or use of nuclear_weapons . For its part , North_Korea would agree to a verifiable freeze , monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency , and fulfill its Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty commitments . It would not restart its 5-megawatt reactor , from which it pulled fuel rods last May . ( The rods , which , if reprocessed , could produce several bombs worth of plutonium , sit in cooling ponds under the IAEA ' s gaze. ) It would seal and no longer operate its reprocessing facility , where it actually manufactures plutonium . Finally , Pyongyang will stop construction on 50- and 200-megawatt graphite reactors , which , if completed , could produce enough plutonium to make a dozen bombs a year . Enter the_devil : What about North_Korea ' s nuclear past ? The train of events producing the nuclear crisis began in late 1992 , when an IAEA lab analysis revealed that North_Korea had done more reprocessing -- hence , acquired more plutonium -- than it had declared . U.S. intelligence agencies had reportedly provided satellite photos of two hidden nuclear-waste sites , where reprocessing could take_place . It was the agency ' s demand to enter these sites that moved North_Korea to threaten withdrawal from the non-proliferation regime . In last week ' s agreement , Pyongyang promised to allow the IAEA to do whatever is necessary to uncover the true history of its weapons program -- but not for another five years or more . Similarly , the near-term fate of the fuel rods remains clouded . It is this large gap in implementation that has spawned some legitimate criticism of , and some partisan sniping at , the accord . There is certainly some cause for concern . But despite its flaws , the agreement , on balance , is defensible . It offers a step-by-step program for building good_faith that , if implemented , would result in a major achievement -- turning_off and ultimately dismantling North_Korea ' s weapons program before it attains the capability to produce dozens of nuclear devices . In fact , by mothballing its reprocessing facility , which is permitted under the Non-Proliferation Treaty , the agreement is more stringent than IAEA norms . To be sure , it is irritating that North_Korea , caught lying and cheating , is now being rewarded . But the non-proliferation system is a discriminatory and imperfect one . And while the North_Korean case may encourage potential bomb builders like Iran to play a similar game , the circumstances on the heavily armed Korean_Peninsula are so dangerous and unique that bending the rules there may_not prove as costly as some fear . After all , although the IAEA has the legal authority to conduct special inspections , it is not standard procedure . Indeed , apart from Iraq , which lost a war , it has never really done so . There is a still larger problem . For the accord to work , North_Korea must fulfill a set of agreements it signed_in December , 1991 , with South_Korea . The nuclear issue is part of the larger question of Korean reunification . Outspoken criticism of the United States by South_Korean President Kim Young Sam reflects his anxiety that Pyongyang is trying to drive a wedge between Washington and Seoul to manipulate North-South relations . But there are some hopeful signs . The new regime in Pyongyang appears to view the nuclear agreement with the United States as a means to bolster its political legitimacy following the death of Kim Il Sung . After loudly rejecting a light-water reactor from South_Korea , the North now appears to accept the reality that Seoul must be involved . And Seoul , meantime , has retreated somewhat from its skepticism and welcomed the nuclear accord , and even started to talk_about more economic cooperation with the North . New political minefields sown by North_Korea no doubt lie ahead . The Administration should thus adhere to a strict interpretation of the agreement and maintain a vigilant &quot; mistrust but verify &quot; attitude . But given the alternatives , the accord is worth pursuing , and if implemented , an important step_forward for nuclear non-proliferation. *</TEXT>
