   <HEADLINE> GREENSPAN VOWS FAST RATE HIKE IF INFLATION BUILDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Federal_Reserve_Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday that the U.S. economy shows no signs of accelerating inflation , but he warned that the central_bank will move quickly to boost interest_rates again if it appears that price pressures are building . Greenspan told the Senate Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs Committee that he sees scattered evidence of the kinds of scarcities that eventually can fuel inflation : shortages of certain workers , such_as truck_drivers and construction specialists , and increases in the costs of some raw_materials . But so far , he said , &quot; we do not see any evidence of costs flowing through into final prices. &quot; &quot; I said it back in May and I say it again today , &quot; Greenspan told the committee , recalling his recent congressional testimony and underlining his insistence that the economy is in good_shape and growing at a reasonable pace without overheating , even after absorbing four interest-rate increases engineered by the Federal_Reserve between February and May . However , he acknowledged that the decline in the dollar against the Japanese yen and the German mark , about 5 % since he last testified , will raise the price of_imported goods , increasing inflationary pressures . The Fed must remain vigilant , he said , because the United States has only a small amount of slack industrial capacity and &quot; it is an open question whether our actions to date have been sufficient to head_off inflationary pressures and thus maintain favorable trends in the economy. &quot; Greenspan ' s warnings about possible further interest_rate hikes took a toll in the financial markets . Stocks declined , as the Dow Jones average of key industrial issues dropped 21.04 points to close at 3 # 727.27. Interest_rates in the bond market had been falling_for three weeks , but began rising after Greenspan ' s testimony . Yields rose across the board , with the key 30-year Treasury_bond closing at 7.54 % , up from 7.46 % on Tuesday . Greenspan ' s testimony was accompanied by the issuance of the central_bank ' s semiannual report , which disclosed the Federal_Reserve ' s strategy of keeping its targets for monetary growth basically unchanged from this year . The Fed expects that its efforts will restrain the &quot; central tendency &quot; of inflation to a range between 2.75 % and 3 % for this year , and between 2.75 % and 3.5 % for 1995 , the report said . Retail prices paid by consumers rose 2.7 % last year , the best performance in the fight against inflation since 1986 . Greenspan and his Federal_Reserve colleagues are engaged in a delicate and difficult balancing act , hoping that this year ' s interest_rate hikes have taken the speculative steam out of the financial markets and slowed the rapidly expanding economy to a healthier pace of moderate growth . The Fed ' s offensive in raising rates was an early strike to head_off future troubles . There was no imminent inflationary threat , but the Fed governors were fearful that the rapid_growth in business output and consumption during the final quarter of 1993 and early this year could have produced a burst of higher prices a year or 18 months later . However , if the economy ' s performance seems &quot; unduly constrained &quot; later , the Fed can reverse policy with minimal risk and quickly drive down interest_rates , providing a rapid stimulus to growth , Greenspan told the committee . Easing_up on the monetary brakes is much easier to do than combatting inflation after it already has spread through the economy , a painful lesson learned during the last 15 years , the Fed governors believe . &quot; We are looking_at a complex economy with a rate_of_growth which has been extraordinary , &quot; Greenspan said . &quot; If we are simmering_down to more long-term , sustainable levels ( of growth ) , that is all to the good . We ' re trying to get an economy which is balanced over time. &quot; This approach -- hiking rates now to avoid inflation later -- was berated as unduly cautious by two Democratic members of the committee , Sens . Paul S . Sarbanes of Maryland and Jim Sasser of Tennessee . &quot; I strongly disagree_with the Federal_Reserve policy -- I am still at_a_loss to find evidence of an overheating economy , &quot; Sasser said . Sarbanes held_up several large-scale reproductions of editorial cartoons , each showing a caricature of Greenspan as worried and fearful of economic_growth . Sasser and Sarbanes were particularly critical of the higher interest_rates because of the impact on the housing_industry , where some customers are priced out of the market with any upward move_in mortgage rates . The rising cost of a mortgage has forced many Americans , &quot; especially young couples , &quot; to forgo their dream of homeownership , Sasser said . Housing starts plunged 9.8 % in June to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.35 million , down from a revised figure of 1.5 million in May , the Commerce_Department reported Wednesday . Housing starts have fallen_for three straight months . Home mortgage rates , which fell to 6.74 % last fall , a 25-year low , reached 8.7 % last week . Sen . Barbara Boxer ( D-Calif. ) , was more diplomatic in her dialogue with Greenspan , avoiding any direct criticism of the Fed chairman . She urged him to avoid cracking_down too hard on business expansion . &quot; We look_to your leadership ; we don ' t want to choke_off a recovery that in our state is nascent , &quot; Boxer said . &quot; We can ' t go_back to high interest rates. &quot; California is lagging behind the rest of the nation in economic recovery as it slowly moves away from a dependence on military contracts , Boxer said . * MARKET REACTION : Bond yields rose and stocks fell after Greenspan ' s remarks . D1 Greenspan Impact Federal_Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan ' s talk_of higher interest_rates ahead this year depressed financial markets , which had been rallying in recent days . A glance at what happened : STOCKS : Prices fell , with the Dow Jones industrial average ending down 20.40 points at 3 # 727.91. Declining issues outnumbered advancing stocks about 2-to-1 on the New York Stock_Exchange . BONDS : Treasury_bond prices , a barometer of investor confidence and inflation fear , were sharply lower in late afternoon trading . The benchmark 30-year bond fell nearly $ 9 per $ 1 # 000 in face_value , as its yield rose to 7.54 % . DOLLAR : The dollar fell against major currencies in New York trading following the stock and bond market drops . In New York , the dollar traded at 98.65 Japanese yen , down from 99.25 late Tuesday , and 1.5650 German marks , down from 1.5680 marks Tuesday . COMMODITIES : Most commodity markets seemed little affected by Greenspan ' s comments . Gold prices declined ; corn and soybean futures prices fell sharply ; and wheat futures were mostly lower . The Commodity Research Bureau index , an indicator of inflationary trends in basics ranging from grain to oil , was down 2.30 to 231.90 .</TEXT>
