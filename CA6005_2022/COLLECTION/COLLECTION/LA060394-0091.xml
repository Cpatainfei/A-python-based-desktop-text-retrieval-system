   <HEADLINE> 2 MEN PLEAD GUILTY IN CUT-RATE AIRLINE TICKET SCAM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Technology has made_possible many things , as any con_man can attest . For instance , thanks to science you can now steal almost anything : phone_numbers , credit , whole identities . But turning technology into ill-gotten gain still requires the same old-fashioned and risk-prone grifting skills . Which is how two Los Angeles area scalpers of cut-rate plane_tickets ended_up convicted this week on a long-running , multimillion-dollar scam involving stolen phones , faked identities , credit_card numbers pinched from the trash at a rental car firm , and a phony claim that they were doctors whose transplant patients needed emergency transportation . In separate cases , Keith Wayne Thompson , 39 , of Compton and Roderick Shawn Williams , 34 , of Lakewood pleaded guilty in federal_court Wednesday to 12 and 11 counts , respectively , of wire fraud . Prosecutors said the two unemployed men had been scalping stolen plane_tickets as far back as 1987 , and their arrests were the result of a long-term investigation by the U.S. Secret_Service into the unauthorized use of credit_cards . Assistant U.S. Atty . Stephen Larson said the two men knew each other , and ran virtually identical operations , but did not appear to be in business together . Their network of operatives , runners and middlemen was extensive , Larson said . Although the counts to which they pleaded guilty amounted only to a little over $ 26 # 000 in fraud , the two men and their associates were running a variety of scams that cost the airlines as much as $ 13.5 million in the past six years , Larson said , citing Secret_Service and airline estimates . &quot; They spent most of the money they made on cars and luxuries , &quot; Larson said . &quot; So they don ' t have a big bank_account with which they can make restitution . The money is gone , and the airlines and travel_agents and credit_card companies are left holding the bag. &quot; Larson said that Thompson , who has prior convictions for forgery and credit_card fraud , obtained discount airline tickets by calling travel_agencies near hospitals , using one of several cellular_phones that had either been stolen or encoded with a &quot; cloned &quot; computer chip bearing someone else ' s telephone billing information . Posing as &quot; Dr. Tom Powers , &quot; Larson said , &quot; ( Thompson ) would tell the agent that my patient so-and-so has a transplant operation , and needs to fly immediately. &quot; Then , Larson said , Thompson would give the agent the &quot; patient ' s &quot; credit_card number over the phone -- reading the name , number and expiration date_from a credit slip he or one of his operatives had pilfered , usually from a trash_bin at an Avis Rent-a-Car outlet in Los Angeles . Rarely was the &quot; doctor &quot; questioned , Larson said . Then , he said , Thompson would resell the tickets for as much as 70 % of face_value . His clients were people who had heard of him by word_of_mouth . Thompson and Williams ran little risk of capture because their customers used the tickets before the credit_card holders realized they had been wrongly charged , the prosecutor said . Investigators had difficulty tracing the sale because the names and the phone_numbers they had left with travel_agents belonged_to someone else . Eventually , the number of complaints involving the scam drew the attention of the Secret_Service , Larson said , and with the aid of telephone wiretaps and surveillance , the two were caught and they confessed .</TEXT>
