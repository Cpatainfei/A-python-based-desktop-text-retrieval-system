   <TEXT> PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat , triumphant in his &quot; journey of return &quot; after 27 years of exile , called_on Palestinians on Friday to put aside their differences and build &quot; a democratic and free homeland. &quot; Arafat , setting_out the tasks of the new Palestinian Authority , pledged that the agreement the Palestine Liberation Organization signed with Israel on limited autonomy for the Gaza Strip and the Jericho district in the West_Bank would be expanded to all_of the West_Bank and eventually would bring independence . On a day of drama and history , Arafat was sober , businesslike , almost in_awe_of the scale of the problems that he faces in turning this impoverished strip of land into the paradise that many of his people expect will come from self-rule . After crossing the border from Egypt in midafternoon , Arafat addressed a rally of about 70 # 000 in front of the building that will house the Palestinian Authority ' s legislature . He then plunged into a night of meetings with political_leaders from the Gaza Strip and West_Bank . Dropping the fiery rhetoric that marked his speeches as a guerrilla leader , Arafat bluntly warned his people : &quot; We have a very hard task ahead -- to build our country , to reconstruct our institutions , to recover from the ( Israeli ) occupation. &quot; Yet there was also reflection among Palestinians on the significance of Arafat ' s return -- the launch of the Palestinian Authority , the first_step toward statehood , the symbolic return of the exiled Palestinian people . &quot; This is my new day of birth , &quot; said Intisar Wazir , widely known as Umm Jihad , the social_affairs minister in the Palestinian Authority . &quot; This day reminds me of all_the years of sadness and tragedy of the Palestinian people when it was outside its homeland . This day reminds me of my husband , Abu Jihad ( the late Khalil Wazir ) , and all_the others who fell_in the Palestinian struggle . And I am wishing for the moment when true and full peace will reign between Israelis and Palestinians. &quot; The Gaza Strip presents a formidable challenge to Arafat ' s ambitions , to Palestinian hopes for both prosperity and democracy and to peace in the Middle_East . More_than 850 # 000 people , many of them refugees from old Arab villages in what is now Israel , are crammed in its 140 square_miles . Living conditions here are squalid . Many people have not been employed for years and barely subsist . This poverty and desperation bred the original Palestinian revolution , then the intifada , the 1987 uprising against Israeli occupation that ultimately led to the peace accord between Israel and the PLO . Arafat , escorted to the Gaza border by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , walked across at Rafah at midafternoon , gesturing with a &quot; V &quot; for victory sign . He dropped to his knees to kiss the ground and to pray . He was quickly engulfed by scores of Palestinian police_officers , disappearing for a while , his black-and-white headdress barely visible , before the officers raised him aloft to the cheers of jubilant supporters . As Arafat ' s fast-moving motorcade reached Gaza City , which was decked in Palestinian flags and welcome banners , tens of thousands of people poured into the streets to cheer him . As they assembled in front of the legislative_council building , people joined in songs and folk_dances and cheered the PLO leader wildly when he appeared . Crowds tore through security fences to get closer to the stage . People fired guns into the air in celebration . The chaos in Gaza City brought renewed fears of an assassination attempt against Arafat , and Israel Army radio reported that a man with a gun hidden in a camera was arrested while trying to kill Arafat here . Asked whether there was an assassination attempt on Arafat , Nabil Shaath , a top aide , replied with a laugh : &quot; The only way to assassinate Arafat today was by over-kissing him. &quot; Mohammed Dahlan , Palestinian head of preventive security in the Gaza Strip , said there had been no arrest , as did Maj . Gen . Nasser Yussuf , commander of the Palestinian police . Jewish settlers had sought to protest Arafat ' s visit to Gaza but found themselves barred by Israeli troops from entering the autonomous area of Gaza . Instead of demonstrations , they had to content themselves with signs denouncing him as a terrorist and demanding , &quot; Death to the Murderer ! &quot; But Arafat ' s welcome here was clear as parents brought young children to see and hear the Palestinian leader -- a chance to be present at history . &quot; With spirit , with blood , we sacrifice for you , Abu Ammar , &quot; the crowd chanted , using Arafat ' s nom_de_guerre . &quot; My loved ones , my family , my clan , my tribe , my people , my brothers , &quot; Arafat began , his voice thick_with emotion . &quot; Here we are , and on this day we meet for the first time together on the soil of Palestine in struggling Gaza. &quot; Arafat acknowledged that the struggle continues , in fact , because Israel still holds as_many as 6 # 000 Palestinian prisoners . &quot; We have refused to make concessions on any prisoner or inmate , &quot; he declared . &quot; We reject bargaining . The issue of the prisoners is the most important issue for us . It will not be possible for us to rest without them being among us. &quot; The PLO chairman reached_out to Palestinian opposition groups , notably the Islamic fundamentalists , in an appeal for national unity ; he warmly greeted Dr. Haidar Abdel-Shafi , one of Gaza ' s most distinguished leaders and one of Arafat ' s most persistent critics , and kissed him eight times . And prompted by Wazir , Arafat saluted the young generation of Palestinians who led the six-year uprising against Israeli rule here and in the West_Bank , paving the way for the negotiations on self-rule . &quot; My heartiest blessing to the children of the stones , to the heroes of the stones , &quot; Arafat said , acknowledging that the stone-throwers who challenged Israeli soldiers in the streets had in practice succeeded where his guerrilla army had failed . The second pledge Arafat made was to expand the area of Palestinian autonomy until it covers the rest of the West_Bank , which is still occupied by Israel . &quot; We are going from here , from Gaza to the al Ibrahimi mosque ( in Hebron ) , going_to Janin , to Nablus , Tulkarm , Qalqiliya , Bethlehem , Beit Sahur , Beit Jala and Ramallah , and then , then Jerusalem , Jerusalem , Jerusalem , &quot; he said , promising to &quot; liberate &quot; the Arab section of the city . Although such comments normally arouse the ire of Israelis , who proclaim Jerusalem their &quot; united and eternal capital , &quot; Foreign Minister Shimon Peres reacted calmly . &quot; He can say anything he wants , but he must act according to what is in the agreement , &quot; Peres said . &quot; We cannot act_as the censors of his dreams . As long as he acts in accordance with the agreement , meaning that he negates and prevents terror , and departs from the Palestinian charter and accepts all_the work rules_in Gaza and Jericho , it is OK. &quot; In his speech , Arafat told the Israelis , his partners in the search for a Middle_East peace : &quot; With Mr. ( Yitzhak ) Rabin , we signed the peace of the brave , and I say to them , the peace of the brave needs more bravery , more courage from everyone so that we can protect it and peace continues. &quot; Peres observed in Jerusalem : &quot; The test is in the doing , and as things have been done until now , things are going beautifully . . . . Until now it must be said that of all_the Palestinian leaders , Arafat , as they say in English , delivered the goods. &quot; Arafat will also visit the West_Bank self-rule enclave of Jericho during his current visit , Shaath told reporters Friday . He said Arafat will go_to Paris on Tuesday . * RELATED STORIES : A10 , A12</TEXT>
