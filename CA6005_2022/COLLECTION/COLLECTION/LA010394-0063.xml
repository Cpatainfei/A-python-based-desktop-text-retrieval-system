   <HEADLINE> STREET SMART : DESPITE NAME CHANGES , LOMA STREET WILL STRETCH TO ANAHEIM</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Dear Street Smart : I read in the paper that there ' s a proposal to connect Loma Street at the Orange-Anaheim border to Loma Street at the Orange-Villa Park border . But the 1994 Thomas Bros . guide for Orange County says Loma Street is to connect to the Mesa Dump Road in Orange . Which is it ? Greg Bales Anaheim In a sense , both scenarios are correct . Loma Street takes_on a couple different names , but from stem to stern it starts at the Orange-Villa Park border and will eventually extend_to the Orange-Anaheim border . Beginning at the southern end in the city of Orange , Cannon Street becomes Loma Street . Still in Orange , Loma Street continues north along the eastern border of Villa Park and becomes Mesa Dump Road . But it doesn ' t stop there . If you ' ll look closely at your Thomas Bros . guide , you ' ll see that Mesa Dump Road will turn_back into Loma Street and go_on to connect with Imperial Highway in Anaheim . Work to connect Loma Street with Imperial Highway is currently underway , said Bernie Dennis , traffic engineer for the city of Orange . The Orange County Transportation Authority is holding several public forums and hearings on transportation projects . This week , the public is invited to two forums to learn about and comment on the Imperial Highway Smart Street project . The first forum will be from 5 to 8 p.m. Wednesday at Imperial Middle_School , 1450 S . Schoolwood Drive , La Habra . The second forum will be from 5 to 8 p.m. Thursday at Canyon High_School , 220 S . Imperial Highway , Anaheim . Smart Street enhancements include traffic_signal coordination , roadway widening , raised medians , and bus turnouts . The forums will enable residents and business owners to learn more about planned improvements on Imperial Highway . While there will not be a formal presentation , information and exhibits detailing the project will be available . Also , representatives from OCTA and local cities will be available to answer questions . OCTA also is soliciting public comment on proposed changes to the transit service it offers people with disabilities who cannot access regular buses . An annual public hearing will be at 9 a.m. Jan . 10 in the Orange County Planning_Commission Hearing Room , Hall of Administration , 10 Civic Center Plaza , Santa Ana . This public hearing will focus_on minor service improvements and will raise issues to be considered in the next update . In addition to the hearing , OCTA will conduct a two-month public outreach campaign during February and March to inform riders and social_services agencies of the authority ' s services . For additional information , call OCTA at ( 714 ) 636-RIDE or at ( 800 ) 636-RIDE from outlying areas of the county . * The Measure M Citizens Oversight Committee will hold its annual public hearing at 6 p.m. Jan . 11 in the Orange County Hall of Administration Planning_Commission Room at 10 Civic Center Plaza in Santa Ana . The hearing will give an overview of Measure M expenditures during the past year and an update on the status of Measure M projects . The public will have an opportunity to comment and share their ideas regarding Measure M projects and programs . The citizens committee consists_of Orange County residents who monitor expenditures of Measure M , the half-cent transportation sales tax passed_by local voters in 1990 . Each year , the committee holds a public hearing to determine if provisions of the Measure M ordinance are being met by OCTA .</TEXT>
