   <TEXT> To hear &quot; can ' t Get No Satisfaction , &quot; punch 1 : The Rolling Stones had launched into a tune at the Rose Bowl when a spectator pulled_out her portable phone and dialed a friend . Then she held_up the phone and pointed it toward the stage . &quot; He ' s a big Stones fan , but he couldn ' t make_it to the concert , &quot; she explained to a seat-mate . &quot; Next best thing. &quot; * The search continues : Here are more suggestions from readers in their noble quest to find a name for the studio created by Steven Spielberg , David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg . * The Three Egos ( Zachary Charles , Rodney Simard , Aaron Wolfe , who all offered variations on that theme. ) * Ft . Knox Studios ( Patricia Hayes ) * We Are the World , Inc. ( Mark Miller ) * 800-Pound Gorilla Studios ( &quot; As in , they can name it whatever they want and build it wherever they want. &quot; ) ( Loren Lester ) * &quot; Once there was a studio called Miracle Productions , which had the corporate slogan , ' If it ' s a fine movie , it ' s a Miracle , &quot; ' writes David Danziger . &quot; For some strange reason the firm failed . The name is now available to the current triumvirate. &quot; * All wet : An ad for bathroom_tissue caught the eye -- but not the fancy -- of Pat Garrett of Studio City , Pat Davey of Northridge and Marguerite Olsen of West Hills . * Material for the next &quot; I Hate Cats &quot; book : Mike Calzone of Whittier , meanwhile , found an area where extreme measures are required when parking one ' s feline . Reassuring news : The other day we speculated that the Los Angeles Police_Department requires a bit of backup help at its substation in the Larchmont area . We were referring to the Westec Security sticker in the substation ' s front window . Well , we ' re happy to report that crime hasn ' t become that bad . An LAPD spokesman wrote to say that the department requires no such assistance -- the sticker merely &quot; shows the cooperation between the private security patrols which service the community and the Los Angeles Police Department. &quot; How did the FBI miss this one ? After the selection of the princesses who will comprise the Royal Court for the 1995 Tournament of Roses Parade , the outraged Pasadena Weekly said : &quot; Congrats to all_the members who hail from San Marino , Arcadia , La Canada and South Pasadena . Is it just us or is something missing here ? Like maybe someone from PASADENA ? Maybe they should start calling themselves the San Marino Tournament of Roses. &quot; * Back to the Stones : A couple of ex-youths from the ' 60s sat in the sold-out Rose Bowl in San Marino -- excuse us , Pasadena . They were surrounded by tens of thousands of fans -- fans in the seats , fans milling_around in the aisles , fans clogging the tunnels . Once , the atmosphere would have electrified the two Baby_Boomers . Now , as they surveyed the scene , one of them remarked : &quot; Hey , man , if either of us had a heart_attack , we ' d never get_out of here. &quot; miscelLAny Tuition for the 1994-95 year at USC is $ 17 # 230 , not to mention $ 6 # 482 for room and board . When the school opened in 1880 , tuition was $ 24 to $ 30 per year . Of course , there weren ' t as_many scholarships back then .</TEXT>
