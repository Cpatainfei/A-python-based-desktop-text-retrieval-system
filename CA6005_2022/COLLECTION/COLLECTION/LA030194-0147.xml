   <HEADLINE> PLO TO SEEK U.S. HELP IN PRESSURING ISRAELIS ; MIDEAST : PALESTINIANS WANT CURBS ON JEWISH SETTLERS BEFORE TALKS RESUME . JERUSALEM ALSO VIES FOR SUPPORT .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As Israel sought U.S. assistance in preserving advances made so far in negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization and with its Arab neighbors , PLO officials said Monday that they will probably send a delegation to Washington to push for more curbs on Jewish settlers in the Israeli-occupied territories as a prelude to resuming stalled peace talks . Concluding two days of crisis talks after last week ' s massacre of 48 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque , the PLO Executive Committee was preparing to name a small group of envoys to meet with Clinton_Administration officials to try to win support for further security controls on Israeli settlers . The PLO said it will also ask the United States to press for international protection forces in the occupied territories and a full investigation , under international auspices , of the Israeli army ' s role in the attack and its aftermath . Syria , Jordan and Lebanon have announced that they are also pulling_out of the peace talks in response to the massacre , the worst incident of violence in Israel ' s 27-year occupation of the West_Bank and Gaza Strip . &quot; They have to understand the whole peace process has lost its credibility , &quot; PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat said in an interview early today . &quot; We are not asking_for the moon . From the beginning , we have only been asking_for the accurate and honest implementation of the Declaration of Principles we signed_in September. &quot; Arafat said he will make a decision on the delegation to Washington after meeting today with a special envoy dispatched by Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin . Arafat said that the Palestinians expect the Americans to exert the necessary pressure on Israel to make_it possible to resume the peace talks . Yasser Abed-Rabbo , head of the PLO information department , warned that &quot; either we get guarantees or the Palestinian people will not back anymore the peace process. &quot; In Israel , officials also warned they will not make major concessions out of a sense of guilt for the massacre in Hebron . Although senior Israeli officials said they had anticipated that the PLO and the other Arabs would suspend the talks to protest the massacre at a West_Bank mosque last week by an Israeli settler , they said they were not confident of Israel ' s ability to restart them without U.S. mediation . &quot; We , directly , would have a hard_time persuading the Syrians and the Lebanese to return to the talks , &quot; Deputy Foreign Minister Yossi Beilin said . &quot; And concerning the PLO , this would not be easy , not at all . The next step should be the intervention of the Americans. &quot; In Washington , State_Department spokesman Mike McCurry said the United States is ready to discuss the tattered peace process with PLO envoys . But he gave no indication that the Administration will pressure Israel into new concessions to meet the Palestinians ' demands . McCurry said the PLO ' s key demand for international observers to protect Palestinian civilians from Israeli settlers could be met by modifying a provision -- originally intended to send_in international economic advisers -- of the agreement Israel and the PLO signed_in Washington last September . But he made_it clear that the United States will not pressure Israel to accept that interpretation of the pact . Israel ' s plea for U.S. intervention overrides its strong preference previously for direct negotiations with the PLO and other Arabs . Western diplomats suggested that it reflected serious concern by Israeli Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin that the gains so arduously won in recent months might be lost as a result of the massacre . Speaking_to the Israeli Parliament on Monday , Rabin pledged to &quot; continue the peacemaking.. . . We will accelerate the talks , the contacts and the negotiations , and even if it takes time , peace will come. &quot; Addressing Palestinians , Rabin said : &quot; We are near to the conclusion of the next stage in the negotiations for peace . We already see the finish_line . A little more effort , a little more readiness , a little more goodwill by you , the Palestinians , and by us , and we will be victorious . We have no other path , only that of peace . There is nothing without it. &quot; But Rabin ruled_out major concessions in response to the massacre or to get the talks restarted . &quot; The abominable murder in Hebron and the feeling of loss and sorrow will not change our fundamental positions regarding the security of Israel and its citizens , including the Jewish settlers in Judea and Samaria ( the West_Bank ) and the Gaza Strip , &quot; he said . But in discussions with Foreign Minister Shimon Peres , Rabin relented on the question of the international peacekeeping force demanded by the PLO , according to Israeli officials ; he would accept such a contingent if it was agreed to in negotiations on Palestinian self-government . Israel would continue to reject an international force sent as a result of a U.N. resolution , they said . Many PLO officials are calling_for an end to the &quot; Gaza-Jericho first &quot; agreement signed_in September calling_for an interim period of self-rule in two enclaves of the occupied territories . But Arafat has clearly been looking_for a realistic set of demands that would allow the negotiations , which had been near fruition before the massacre , to get_back on track . Israel ' s pledge over the weekend to crack_down on extremist settlers , arresting their leaders and disarming their most dangerous elements , has met with an unwelcome reception in Tunis , where PLO officials believe the measure will do nothing to protect Palestinians from the large_number of armed settlers who do not belong_to those groups . &quot; I was expecting yesterday they would have something from the ( Israeli ) Cabinet to cool_down the situation , &quot; Arafat said . &quot; But as we say in Arabic , ' What came_down from the mountain ? A mouse. ' &quot; Abed-Rabbo emphasized that the demand for security &quot; is not an offer &quot; but a bottom_line . &quot; This is not a bargaining question . The safety of every single Palestinian is not a question of bargaining or negotiation. &quot; He said that without these guarantees , &quot; this is something that might motivate us to ask our people to carry weapons in_order to protect themselves. &quot; PLO officials said the envoys would not meet with Israeli officials but would meet with the Administration &quot; to discuss requirements for resumption of the peace talks. &quot; Abed-Rabbo said the PLO is delaying adoption of a final strategy until it evaluates the Security_Council response to the weekend attack . The council continued to deliberate on a possible resolution on the massacre late Monday . Murphy reported from Tunis and Parks from Jerusalem .
