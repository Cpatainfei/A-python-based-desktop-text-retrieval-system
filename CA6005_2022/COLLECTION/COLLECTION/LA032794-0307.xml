   <HEADLINE> LAW TAKES_AIM AT PREVENTING LEAD-PAINT HAZARDS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The dangers of lead_poisoning , especially to young children , have long been documented . Until now , however , most prevention efforts have been haphazard or ineffective at lowering the number of poisoned children . But a new federal law adopted in the fall of 1992 is changing the strategies for dealing with the lead problem nationwide . The Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 , or Title X as it ' s called , will touch just about everyone and is considered the most comprehensive lead_poisoning prevention legislation in decades . Title X imposes its requirements on federally owned , insured and assisted housing . But its far-reaching requirements will create a much-needed infrastructure for battling the lead-based paint hazards that will affect private_property owners as well . One of the most noticeable aspects of the law is its preventive approach to the lead problem . Most policies regulating lead hazards in housing require a child to become sick before action is taken . Title X ' s focus is to find and fix the hazard before a child becomes ill . At the same time , Title X also takes_into_account the impracticalities of targeting all lead-based paint for removal , as it exists in much of the nation ' s residential housing . &quot; Half the U.S. housing stock has lead paint , &quot; said Don Ryan , executive_director of the non-profit Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning in Washington . &quot; If you say you don ' t want lead paint in there , half of us are going_to be living_in tents. &quot; Moreover , total elimination of lead-based paint hazards can be extremely costly and financially debilitating for property_owners . As a result , many orders for cleanup in communities with strict lead policies have backfired , as landlords and other property_owners who are unable to finance the work were forced to abandon the property . To encourage more lead clean-up , Title X shifts the focus from total abatement to &quot; lead hazard reduction , &quot; which includes interim measures as well as more thorough abatement of six specific lead-based-paint hazards defined in the law . &quot; Title X changed the ballgame on what will have to be abated , &quot; said Ron Morony , deputy director of the Office of Lead-Based Paint Abatement and Poisoning Prevention for the department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) . &quot; One of its major thrusts is that it ' s going_to get_together a good , reliable infrastructure . Right now , in L.A. , if have a poisoned child it ' s not clear how you can find a reliable contractor. &quot; And that ' s the case in most communities throughout the United States . Yet , nationwide , 57 million privately owned homes and apartments built before 1980 contain lead paint , according to a 1990 HUD study . Of those , HUD officials say , 3.8 million are considered a &quot; priority hazard &quot; because young children live_in them and because they contain lead paint that ' s peeling or deteriorating . Under California ' s mandatory disclosure law , a seller aware that lead paint exists in a home , must disclose that information . But a Title X provision that takes_effect in October , 1995 , will take that several steps further . That provision will require that prospective buyers or tenants of a pre-1978 housing unit receive a warning and a pamphlet on lead hazards as well as a disclosure . Buyers will have 10 days to arrange for a risk assessment . Gary Rochlin , owner of Venice-based Lead Tech , a lead paint inspection and abatement firm said even now , before the more stringent disclosure and warning requirements , lead paint has become a priority to some buyers who are aware of the 1995 requirements . &quot; We ' ve literally knocked two homes out of escrow because of lead , &quot; he said . &quot; You can buy a home with lead in it , but you are going_to be ultimately responsible_for it. &quot; Next month the Environmental Protection Agency is required to create a &quot; model state program &quot; so states can develop their own lead-based paint programs that will include contractor training , certification and licensing programs based on national standards . Gov . Wilson signed legislation in October , 1993 , that will put California in compliance with Title X and bring_about the development of a viable lead abatement industry here , so those saddled with lead-burdened houses and apartments in the future will be able to find qualified contractors to do the work . Until then , property_owners are_on their own . &quot; It ' s a scary situation right now because we don ' t have regulations , &quot; said Debra Carlton , vice_president of research for the 23 # 000-member California Apartment Assn . &quot; Lead paint for our 1994 agenda is at the top of the list. &quot;</TEXT>
