   <TEXT> It is a cool fall evening , only minutes after the last glow of an afternoon sunset has faded behind the cloak of night , and as you sit in the darkness waiting , you hear them coming . Leaves that were clinging_to life just days ago now lay dead beneath the skeletal branches , crying_out involuntarily as they are smashed under the feet of the approaching creatures . Soon , the leaves grow silent , and you know that the monsters are there , right there , outside your door , and that they will not go_away until you have looked_into their ghastly faces , and satisfactorily answered the eternal question : &quot; Trick_or_treat ? &quot; Oh , yeah , it ' s Freddy Krueger , or Jason , the Mummy or the Werewolf , maybe even the_devil himself . If the entrepreneurial ghouls have their way , and parents in your neighborhood are tacky enough to let their kids wear them , it could be the mask of O.J. staring back at you . But if this Oct . 31 is like most others during the past six decades , ever since Hollywood got its voice and put the scream in Halloween , you are sure to be visited by the perennial masters of the dark , the id and the ego of the Living Dead , Frankenstein ' s monster and Count Dracula . * If you ' re really paying_attention , the faces stamped_out in latex are those of Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi , whose performances in Universal ' s seminal 1931 talking horror movies , &quot; Frankenstein &quot; and &quot; Dracula , &quot; set the images of the characters forever . In the 63 years since &quot; Frankenstein &quot; and &quot; Dracula &quot; were released , there have been countless remakes , knockoffs , spoofs and parodies . There are 32 movies with Dracula in the title available right now on video , 29 with Frankenstein , and scores more featuring either those characters or monsters sporting similar MOs . Frankenstein ' s monster and the vampire who inspired Count Dracula were conceived in novels , illustrated in magazines , given life on stage , transported to the silver_screen and broadcast over the airwaves . Their stories have been told and retold , their powers and personalities subjected_to a_thousand whims of reinvention . They flourished during the Great Depression , survived World_War_II ( and Abbott and Costello ) , saw aliens from outer space , psycho-killers , and devils of every denomination come_in and out of vogue . They have even survived face-to-face confrontations with each other , and , at the end of the day , remain the dominant figures of modern horror fiction . And they are about to go_after each other again , at least at the box_office . On Friday , TriStar opens &quot; Mary Shelley ' s Frankenstein , &quot; directed by Kenneth Branagh and starring Robert De Niro as the monster . A week later , Warner Bros . trots_out Neil Jordan ' s &quot; Interview With the Vampire , &quot; with Tom Cruise playing the vampire Lestat . As this is being written , there is no advance word on the comparative quality of the two films , but the smart_money says the vampire movie will win the 1994 monster-off . Not just because Cruise is a bigger box-office star than De Niro , but because the prevailing social environment is more suited to the seductive wiles of vampires , and to the pleasures and dangers of sex , than to the raw terror of the walking dead and the theme of science run amok . Let ' s face it , Frankenstein ' s monster , as we have come_to know him in film , is an NFL lineman , a lumbering ox who is all scar tissue and brute force , trudging along without any supernatural , social or intellectual skills . Even though Shelley had him pining for a sweetheart , it ' s hard to imagine what he ' d have done with her . In contrast , Dracula and his literary variants have been depicted as suave , sensual , alluring figures who move with the grace of the wind , and though they become petulant over the presence of garlic , crucifixes and mirrors , they remain relatively free_of the constraints of nature . As monsters , they seem to make strange bedfellows , yet they have sort of marched two abreast throughout 19th- and 20th-Century culture . They were , if legend has it right , even conceived on the same weekend in 1816 , under the same roof , perhaps under the influence of the same drugs , in a villa near Lake Geneva , where Mary Shelley , her husband Percy Bysshe Shelley , Lord Byron and a Dr. Polidori got_together to exchange ghost stories . During that decadent house_party , Shelley reportedly saw the image of a scientist reanimating a corpse in a dream , while Dr. Polidori began a story that would produce his 1819 novella , &quot; The Vampyre. &quot; Shelley ' s monster and Dr. Polidori ' s vampire were conceived as sort of freakish peers , products of_their_own excessive environment . Though feminist writers have suggested that Shelley ' s story was an allegory about the male desire to procreate without having to put_up with women , she gave the more reasonable explanation that she was stimulated by theories of how electricity might be used to raise the dead . In any event , the original monster that her Dr. Victor Frankenstein assembled from spare_parts found in graveyards and morgues was an intelligent creature who , though he looked a fright , could function within society . He could speak several languages , and was driven not by some quest_for spiritual light , like that big lug Boris Karloff played , but by anger and revenge , a desire to smash the godhead science that made him . Dr. Polidori ' s vampire was also a product of the author ' s cultural background , a suave rake whose nocturnal lifestyle and perverse pleasures seem only a_few degrees removed from the lives of some early 19th-Century aristocrats . Bram Stoker , a product of the Victorian Era , scruffed up the vampire ' s image and buried Polidori ' s sexual imagery in his 1897 novel , &quot; Dracula , &quot; making the count a pasty , decrepit old_man . He is about as seductive as a mosquito , a thief in the night , slipping into the boudoirs of sweet-blooded maidens , and feasting as they sleep . The vampire became even more ghastly in F . W . Murnau ' s 1922 silent_movie , &quot; Nosferatu , &quot; an unauthorized adaptation of &quot; Dracula , &quot; featuring a rat-faced , long-eared Count Orlock . Shortly after that , Hungarian actor Bela Lugosi combined some of the aristocratic bearing of Dr. Polidori ' s vampire with the Transylvanian mystery of Stoker ' s Dracula in a hugely successful stage production , then reprised it in Tod Browning ' s 1931 movie , and the character , as he is most commonly known , was born . That same year , Frankenstein ' s monster underwent a personality change . Shelley ' s story was too horrific for movie audiences trying to get used to the shock of people talking in movies , let alone screaming . And by then , mad scientists trying to play god seemed a realistic threat to rational people . So Universal turned the monster into a pure victim of science , the confused creation of a mad grave robber , who killed only by accident , or when threatened . &quot; Dracula &quot; and &quot; Frankenstein &quot; launched a decade of horror movies in Hollywood , and spawned sequels -- &quot; Dracula ' s Daughter &quot; and &quot; The Bride of Frankenstein &quot; -- considered today to be better than the originals . But the onslaught of competitive monsters , plus the advent of the atomic age , shunted the classics aside , or turned them into comic relief in &quot; Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein , &quot; or into gentle suburbanites in &quot; The Addams Family &quot; and &quot; The Munsters. &quot; England ' s Hammer Films made a series of blood-soaked but fairly faithful Frankenstein and Dracula movies in the ' 50s and ' 60s , and with the 1974 &quot; Young Frankenstein , &quot; Mel Brooks made what may be the best and most affectionate genre spoof in Hollywood history . But the monsters ' images could use some sprucing_up , which is what they may be about to get . Branagh ' s version of the Frankenstein story hews closely to Shelley ' s original story line , which has the monster murdering the doctor ' s brother and wife and chasing him halfway around the world . And Jordan ' s adaptation of &quot; Interview With the Vampire &quot; will be a major disappointment if it doesn ' t capture the seductive atmosphere of Rice ' s novel . The oddity of the two subjects is that while &quot; Frankenstein &quot; began life as the philosophical work -- a cautionary tale about man going_against nature -- and the vampire stories as pure horror entertainment , they have temporarily switched positions in the ' 90s . Even though man is tinkering with nature as he never has before , society is less panicked by what science might accomplish than by what it cannot . The vampire stories , with their inherent linking of sexuality , blood and death , the mystery and power of the combination , make them seem as if they are allegories foretold . As ridiculous as things got_in Francis Ford Coppola ' s over-the-top 1992 &quot; Bram Stoker ' s Dracula , &quot; it was impossible to watch the count ' s infecting of Mina with his blood and not see it as a sign of the times . There may come a time when the mad scientist reclaims his ranking as a fearsome menace -- there are people out there we don ' t want to see cloned , for instance -- but for now , Dr. Frankenstein seems a benign threat , and his monster goes comparatively gentle into the night .
