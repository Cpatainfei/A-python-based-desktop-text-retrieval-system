   <TEXT> TELEVISION VCRs Are Humming : Viewers might grumble about what ' s available on network TV but the season really isn ' t that bad , according to Dorothy Swanson , founder-president of the nonprofit Viewers for Quality Television . &quot; The really telling answer is that people ' s VCRs are very busy , &quot; she said . &quot; I think they ' re beginning to see that it is a pretty good season. &quot; Two new fall shows that Swanson ' s 3 # 000-member group especially likes are the hospital drama &quot; ER &quot; on NBC and CBS ' &quot; Under Suspicion , &quot; which features Karen Sillas as a lone female detective struggling to succeed in a male-dominated police_precinct . In its semi-annual survey of members , which Swanson says drew about 1 # 000 replies , Viewers for Quality Television selected only those two shows for its &quot; fully endorsed &quot; list , where they join a dozen programs that were previously named . Dropped from the list were &quot; Seinfeld &quot; and &quot; Sisters , &quot; which now are given &quot; qualified support , &quot; meaning they have the potential to join the elite . New fall shows added_to the qualified list are &quot; Chicago Hope , &quot; &quot; Due South , &quot; &quot; My So-Called Life &quot; and &quot; Party of Five. &quot; The viewers ' group , based in Fairfax Station , Va. , gave its full endorsement to five NBC series , five CBS series , three on ABC and only one -- &quot; The X Files &quot; -- on Fox . MOVIES Sundance Lineup : Sixteen documentaries and 18 dramatic films have been selected for showing at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival Jan . 19-29 in Park City , Utah , it was announced Monday . Among the documentaries : &quot; I Just Wasn ' t Made_for These Times &quot; ( directed by music producer Don Was , about former Beach Boy Brian Wilson ) , &quot; A Litany for Survival : The Life &amp; Work of Audre Lorde &quot; ( Michelle Parkerson ) and &quot; Complaints of a Dutiful Daughter &quot; ( Deborah Hoffmann ) .

The festival is sponsored by the Sundance Institute , which was founded in 1981 by Robert Redford . * Together Again ? : Meanwhile , Paul Newman says he and Redford would like to make another movie together . &quot; We ' ve been looking_for a script we want to do for 20 years , and we ' ve never been able to find one , &quot; Newman told New York Newsday . The two were paired in &quot; The Sting &quot; in 1973 and &quot; Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid &quot; in 1969 . Newman will next be seen in &quot; Nobody ' s Fool , &quot; in which he plays a ne ' er-do-well construction worker who rents a room from Jessica Tandy , her last screen role . The movie is to be released Christmas_Day . STAGE Yankee Heads to Long_Beach : Luke Yankee has been named producing artistic director of Long_Beach Civic Light_Opera , replacing producer Barry Brown , who resigned earlier this year . A former artistic director of Struthers Library Theatre in Pennsylvania and assistant to Harold Prince on the Broadway production of &quot; Grind , &quot; Yankee recently staged the Florida premiere of &quot; Oleanna &quot; at Coconut Grove Playhouse and is directing a workshop production , &quot; Swanson on Sunset , &quot; scheduled to open at the Cinegrill in Hollywood next week . Yankee will start his duties Dec . 8 , but Brown will produce the first two shows of the coming season , &quot; Can Can &quot; and &quot; Ain ' t Misbehavin ' . &quot; MUSIC A Homecoming for Mehta : Conductor Zubin Mehta said he waited &quot; for more_than 30 years &quot; to bring the Israel Philharmonic orchestra to his native India . On Sunday , the wait was rewarded when Mehta and his musicians won the cheers of a New Dehli audience of 7 # 000 . It was the first time an Israeli orchestra had appeared in India -- the two countries did not have full diplomatic relations until 1992 . Mehta has been music_director of the group since 1977 and formerly conducted the New York and Los Angeles philharmonic orchestras . Sunday ' s event was billed as a &quot; Concert for Peace &quot; to commemorate the 125th anniversary of the birth of independence leader Mohandas K . Gandhi . * Upgrading the Bowl : In the first phase of a renovation now under way at Hollywood Bowl , the seating_area directly below the stage , formerly called &quot; the pool section , &quot; will be newly configured , and will offer larger boxes , wider seats and personal valet services , the L.A.
