The British Sunday newspaper quoted a Sudanese doctor in Cairo as saying Carlos had been admitted to a private hospital in Khartoum and that French agents seized him after he was rendered unconscious by anesthesia . Liposuction is a common cosmetic operation in which doctors vacuum fat out from under the skin .
