   <HEADLINE> CLINTON PROPOSES $ 25 BILLION MORE FOR THE MILITARY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> President Clinton , seeking to blunt a Republican attack on the politically explosive issue of U.S. military readiness , Thursday proposed spending $ 25 billion more over the next six years to bolster military preparedness and modernization of weapons . The proposal is Clinton ' s first major policy initiative since the GOP victory in the Nov . 8 elections . It would finance more training and equipment maintenance , grant new cost-of-living pay increases , upgrade military housing and expand child-care services . The President also announced that he will ask Congress in January for an extra $ 2.3 billion for the current year ' s defense budget to help reimburse the military for peacekeeping and rescue operations , which it says has siphoned_off money needed to maintain readiness . Although Administration officials insisted that the increases had been in the works for months , the timing of the announcement -- which Clinton made at a Rose_Garden ceremony flanked by the Joint Chiefs_of_Staff -- clearly was intended as a preemptive strike against the GOP . Restoring many of the defense cuts that Clinton had made earlier was Item No . 6 in the 10-point &quot; Contract With America &quot; that Republicans used to help seize control of the House in last month ' s election . The GOP had been planning a push for more defense spending in 1995 . Only two weeks ago , the Pentagon was forced into the embarrassing admission that five key Army divisions already had suffered significant declines in readiness as a result of the cash flow problems , despite earlier assertions by top officials that preparedness levels were high . White_House and Pentagon officials declined to say how the President would find the money needed to pay_for the increase -- by cutting domestic programs , proposing new tax_hikes or allowing the federal budget_deficit to grow . But Andrew F . Krepinevich , director of the Defense Budget Project , a nonpartisan defense-monitoring group , said that , with the overall federal budget now so tight , Clinton may be forced &quot; to stand his priorities on their head . . . and raid his domestic programs. &quot; Reaction from Republicans was muted . Rep . Floyd Spence ( R-S.C. ) , the expected chairman of the House Armed Services Committee next year , said that he was heartened by the announcement but that defense spending still falls_short_of what is needed . Sen . Strom Thurmond ( R-S.C. ) , who is expected to head the Senate Armed Services panel , expressed similar sentiments . &quot; We have a readiness problem now and we will have a readiness problem after the President ' s initiative , &quot; he said . He called Clinton ' s plan merely &quot; a good start. &quot; There was some dispute over how far the initiative would go_to close the gap between the long-term goals of Clinton ' s defense_program -- to enable the military to fight two major regional wars nearly simultaneously -- and what he actually has budgeted_for defense . John M . Deutch , deputy secretary_of_defense , told reporters that by delaying or reducing weapons programs the Administration could eliminate the gap , which is now officially estimated at $ 49 billion over the six-year period . But many outside analysts disagreed . Administration officials listed four separate parts of the initiative : * Some $ 2.7 billion over five years to boost morale and retention rates by improving military housing conditions , expanding child_care , welfare and recreation programs and providing an extra pay allowance for personnel stationed in high-cost areas . * About $ 12.5 billion during the period to provide maximum cost-of-living_allowances to military_personnel -- an increase that the Administration eliminated as a cost-cutting move_in its first defense budget but was later forced by Congress to provide . * Up to $ 9.8 billion in additional funds , most of it toward the end of the decade , for modernizing the armed forces by buying new , presumably high-technology weapons to replace aging aircraft , warships , tanks , missiles and guns . * A request for an emergency appropriation in January -- probably for about $ 2.3 billion -- to reimburse the services for money spent carrying_out peacekeeping and rescue missions . Without these funds , they would have to cut training and maintenance . Officials said that the money earmarked for readiness would be used to restore regular training schedules , reduce backlogs at military depots and maintenance facilities and buy more special munitions . It also is expected to go_to train more relief crews to help alleviate strains on military_personnel who are in units that are constantly on_the_go , such_as Airborne Warning and Control_Systems aircraft , Patriot air-defense missile battalions and Navy frigates . In addition to restoring operation and maintenance funds , the money is expected to reduce the number of major new weapons programs that the Pentagon is likely to have to delay or cut_back . In a memorandum to service chiefs last August , Deutch asked_for proposals for cutting or postponing as_many as 10 such projects , including the Air_Force ' s proposed new F-22 jet fighter , to help finance the pay hike and readiness programs , though he gave no dollar total for the cuts . On Thursday , however , he said that the cutbacks probably would not exceed $ 10 billion or $ 12 billion , a figure he described as sharply reduced from the undisclosed target he had anticipated before . For all_the White_House hoopla over the $ 25 billion , officials disclosed that almost three-fourths of the money would not be disbursed until fiscal 1999 , three years after Clinton ' s current term in office . As a result , despite the President ' s new package , overall defense spending still is expected to decline through fiscal 1997 before finally turning_up again . By 1999 , it would rise 1 percentage_point more rapidly than inflation . At the briefing for reporters , Deutch denied suggestions that the President ' s proposal is designed to preempt the Republicans . &quot; This program has not been adjusted because of elections , &quot; he said . &quot; It is the same program that was provided_for before. &quot; However , officials conceded that Thursday ' s announcement was unusual . It was made two full months before Clinton ' s budget is scheduled to be unveiled , a marked departure from the traditional method of disclosing such decisions as part of the regular budget submission . Republicans and many nonpartisan analysts described the measure as an attempt to provide a short-term fix .</TEXT>
