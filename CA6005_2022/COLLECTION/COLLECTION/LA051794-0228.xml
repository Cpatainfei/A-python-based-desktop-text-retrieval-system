   <HEADLINE> ARGENTINA LINKS EX-NAZI CASE , THATCHER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Argentina said Monday that former British Prime_Minister Margaret Thatcher should be extradited for the 1982 sinking of one of its warships in the same way a former Nazi SS officer is being extradited from Argentina . &quot; If the extradition of former SS officer Erich Priebke is being requested on the grounds that the Jewish Holocaust was a war_crime , so was the sinking of the cruiser General Belgrano , and in that case Argentina should request the extradition of former British Prime_Minister Thatcher , &quot; the independent NA news_agency quoted President Carlos Saul Menem as telling a news_conference . The sinking of the_Argentine cruiser during the 10-week Falklands War claimed 323 lives among its crew of 1 # 093 . About 6 million Jews were killed by the Nazis . Menem was speaking in the mountain resort of Bariloche , 1 # 000 miles south of Buenos Aires , where police last week arrested Priebke after he admitted taking_part in the Ardeatine Caves massacre in Italy during World_War_II . Priebke , 81 , who like many Nazis found a haven in Argentina after the war , had been living for decades in Bariloche , a town with a large German community . Argentina is still awaiting the official extradition request from Italy for Priebke for his part in Italy ' s worst World_War_II atrocity . Argentina and Britain have resumed full diplomatic relations since the 1982 war . Menem , his country ' s second elected president since the return to democracy in 1983 , had recently been seeking an official invitation for a state visit to Britain .</TEXT>
