   <HEADLINE> BIOSPHERE PROJECT AIR SEALS BROKEN ; ENVIRONMENT : TWO FORMER INHABITANTS ARE SUSPECTED OF OPENING_DOORS TO CONTAMINATE THE ECOLOGY EXPERIMENT . ONE SAYS SHE ACTED FOR SAFETY REASONS , NOT SABOTAGE .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The air_locks of Biosphere 2 , a controversial ecology experiment 35 miles outside Tucson , were thrown open Monday in what a spokesman called an attempt to sabotage the $ 150-million project by contaminating it with fresh air . Pinal County sheriff ' s officials said Monday they were looking_for two members of the previous crew who spent two years inside Biosphere 2 . They are suspected of opening the doors , breaking the seals and smashing half_a_dozen oxygen valves before dawn Monday . This emptied the mammoth artificial lungs that equalize air_pressure within the 3.15-acre enclosed complex . One of those two , marine biologist Abigail Alling , said in an interview Monday that she &quot; flushed &quot; the Biosphere air for safety purposes , but added , &quot; I did not sabotage the experiment. &quot; Alling spoke by phone from an undisclosed location in Arizona . Though Alling claimed that the project was &quot; terminated , &quot; other officials said it is continuing . Seven researchers from five countries are still living inside the Biosphere , normally sealed from the outside world , in an attempt to operate a self-sustaining environment as a possible prototype for space colonization . Air , water and waste are recycled . Chris Helms , a project spokesman , denied that the experiment was over , and John B . Corliss , the project ' s science director , said the incident would have little impact on the research under way when the dome was breached . About 20 outside scientists are involved in various aspects of the project , from rain_forest ecology to coral_reef studies . &quot; The Biospherians were enthusiastic about continuing , &quot; Corliss said . &quot; that ' s the present plan. &quot; &quot; We don ' t know how much air was exchanged , but it is a significant exchange , &quot; Corliss said . But he added , &quot; From my point_of_view , the effect on the ongoing research was minimal , since it can be measured. &quot; The incident came just three days after Texas billionaire Edward P . Bass , the financier behind the project , took court action to oust the management team that conceived and built the sprawling , high-tech greenhouse as a microcosm of Earth . Alling , who spent two years as a crew_member inside the dome , tending its tiny self-contained ocean , said after the attack Monday , &quot; The Biosphere experiment was terminated this morning out of concern for the safety of the Biospherians and the system . &quot; It is categorically not sabotage , &quot; she said . &quot; I flushed the Biosphere air to be sure that the safety of Biospherians and the system would not be in jeopardy during this trial period. &quot; Alling and Mark Van Thillo , who ran most of the life-support equipment , were wanted by local police for questioning in connection with the early morning incident . Belia Fessenden , a spokeswoman for the Pinal County sheriff ' s office , said that someone who identified herself as Alling called the Biosphere around 4 a.m. and claimed responsibility for damaging the equipment . &quot; If in fact these people did commit trespass and criminal damage , they will face charges of violating a federal_court order that was issued late last week , &quot; Fessenden said . &quot; They ' ll be turned_over to the U.S. marshal ' s office for violating a federal_court order . And we will charge them ourselves with trespass and criminal damages. &quot;</TEXT>
