   <HEADLINE> THE NATION ; DILUTING INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS IS NO WAY TO FIGHT CRIME</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> As part of his seemingly tireless efforts to outdo Republicans on law-and-order issues , President Bill_Clinton recently asked Atty . Gen . Janet Reno to find ways to circumvent a federal judge ' s injunction forbidding random police searches of apartments in a federal housing_development in Chicago . Clinton could have assured tenants that the federal_government would do all it could do to provide whatever level of policing was needed to stop the violence at the complex . Instead , the President pandered to police and public impatience with rising crime : He urged the department responsible_for prosecuting officers who violate people ' s constitutional rights to assist the police in evading the Constitution . The Taylor Homes_in Chicago was the scene of so many gang shootings that some tenants , in desperation , asked police to sweep the complex and , without warrants , search apartments for firearms . The random searches , however , produced more resentment than illegal firearms . Judge Wayne Anderson blocked any more searches on the ground they violated the Fourth Amendment ' s protection against unreasonable search and seizure . The government then did what it should have done_in the first place : It increased the number of police in the community , and the shootings stopped . The attorney representing the tenants conceded that the searches were the &quot; wrong issue. &quot; Providing adequate security was -- and is -- the real answer . Ironically , the police could have been more effective in Chicago if they had acted legally . The courts have ruled that cops may frisk a person suspected of carrying a weapon . Accordingly , gang members who lived_in the Chicago housing complex could have been frisked and arrested if they were found to illegally possess a weapon . Furthermore , if the Chicago police had been working closely with the community , the information necessary to secure search_warrants may have been readily available . What is especially troubling about the Administration ' s apparent desire to get_around Fourth Amendment protections is that it plays into our country ' s history of mistreating non-whites . It was only in 1961 , in Mapp vs . Ohio , that the U.S. Supreme Court put police on final notice that the courts would no longer turn_a_blind_eye toward random searches . Dollree Mapp was a black_woman . The Cleveland police falsely claimed they had a search_warrant when they pushed into her home over the objections of her lawyer . The officers searched her house , eventually finding some obscene photos . She was arrested . The Supreme Court , in Mapp , found this conduct shocking , observing that such misconduct had continued despite previous court rulings denouncing brutal police methods . The Chicago experience , and the history it reawakens , once again underlines how much harder it is to make democracy work_through good government and community commitments than to engage in anti-crime rhetoric . The omnibus crime bill now working its way through Congress is a good_example of how rhetorical fever can overcome sound_judgment and experience -- at the expense of democracy . The bill establishes federal death_penalties for many crimes , among them the non-violent crime of drug trafficking . The federal_courts are already inundated with non-violent drug cases . Burdening them with trying capital-punishment cases , which take years to adjudicate , will crash the system . If for no other reason than the courts would be paralyzed , the bill should be rejected . But the legislation contains other equally bad provisions . Putting 100 # 000 more cops on the street sounds good -- but when they are assigned across the country , 24 hours a day , seven days a week , they will not be visible enough to have much impact . Then , too , no one in Washington seems to want to discuss who will pay_for these officers once the one-to-three-year federal funding expires . The crime bill also continues the incremental federalizing of crimes that used to be a local responsibility -- such_as car-jacking , low-level drug crimes , and gang activities and assault -- just because the victim is a federal employee . Despite such federal law-enforcement failures as the Drug Enforcement Agency ' s inability to control drug_abuse , Congress keeps assuring the public that they will be safer because federal officers can now make arrests in local crimes . All these things are rapidly pushing us toward a national police_force -- an idea once regarded_as a threat to our freedom . The Clinton_Administration is fond of saying that there is a need for &quot; smarter &quot; work by agencies of criminal justice , but it seems to be promoting &quot; dumber &quot; expanded bureaucracies . There is no need for any dilution of individual rights that took centuries to achieve . The murderers striking the most terror in the hearts of people during this century have not been serial_killers like Ted Bundy . They have been governments that have killed millions of their citizens in the name of social order . The authors of the Bill of Rights knew the danger and drafted a document for our protection . We should not let panic about crime erode it. *</TEXT>
