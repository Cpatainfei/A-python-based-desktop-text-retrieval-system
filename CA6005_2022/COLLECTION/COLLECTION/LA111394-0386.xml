   <HEADLINE> TRAVEL INSIDER : AIRLINES TAKING MEASURES TO SIZE_UP YOUR LUGGAGE ; AIR_TRAVEL : USING &quot; SIZING BOXES &quot; AND OTHER GAUGES , THE INDUSTRY HAS BEGUN TO STRICTLY ENFORCE LIMITS ON CARRY-ON BAGS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Attention , air travelers who hog overhead luggage space : This could be the fall and winter of your discontent . Part of this is predictable ; the holiday season always brings an increase in carry-on baggage , since many passengers are reluctant to trust fragile gifts to the vagaries of airline and airport luggage handling systems . But this year , that seasonal crunch will be intensified by the airline industry ' s new shuttle mentality . In its efforts to compete with Southwest Airlines and its no-frills service , the Shuttle by United service that opened last month in California has been streamlining boarding procedures and strictly limiting the size and amount of baggage that travelers can carry aboard . USAir did the same about a year ago . Continental Airlines , though its shuttle service is focused in the eastern United States , may tighten enforcement on non-shuttle service as well . In most cases , the carry-on limits are the same as they have been for years ; they ' ve just never been strongly enforced . Now , as you arrive_at the airport , the first sign of the new carry-on squeeze probably will be a metal-framed &quot; sizing box , &quot; designed to accommodate allowable carry-on items only . The second sign could be a cursing infrequent flyer , who until now has been getting_away with flagrant violations of airline limits . A third sign could be the satisfied smiles of travelers who have played by the rules for years , and suffered for it . &quot; People who bring too_much on the aircraft impose on everybody , &quot; said Chris Chiames , spokesman for the Air Transport Assn. , a Washington-based group that represents the airline industry.. Flight_attendants are glad about the new trend , too . For years they ' ve warned about safety threats posed by overloaded bins and told tales of passengers struck on the head , but been given little help by their employers in dealing with the consequences of lax carry-on enforcement . In a 1992 survey of 1 # 385 flight_attendants for various airlines by the Assn . of Flight_Attendants , 60 % reported that their airline ' s carry-on program worked poorly , and 83 % called passengers with large bags a major problem . Now , much of the responsibility for enforcing limits has moved to customer service agents at the gates , who supervise the sizing boxes . There ' s still cause for concern among rule-abiding passengers , though , because there is no industry standard on carry-on limits . Most airlines draw_the_line at two carry-on pieces , but on many commuter flights , the limit is one , and everyone ' s dimension limits seem to be just a little different . If you ' re facing a flight on an unfamiliar airline and you ' re hoping to carry baggage aboard , call to ask the maximum dimensions , and number of carry-on items allowed . At Southwest Airlines , where sizing boxes have been standard gate equipment since 1971 , spokeswoman Linda Burke Rutherford reported no changes in enforcement or customer behavior . She also noted that deep discount fares on Southwest ' s California flights have led to full loads , which means a shortage of carry-on room for the last passengers in the boarding line . &quot; Sometimes , if you ' re among the last several people to board , we may be out of overhead bin space , &quot; Rutherford said . If the item can ' t be wedged under the seat in front of you , you may be asked to check it . Southwest ' s maximum carry-on dimensions : 16 inches in_height , 10 inches width , 24 inches length . In Southern California , the changes are most prominent at United Airlines , which began its Shuttle by United service in Los Angeles on Oct . 1 . ( Phoenix becomes the 10th city in the system on Dec . 1. ) United has placed sizing boxes at all participating airports . There have been some complaints , acknowledged airline spokesman Tony Molinaro , but United reported no substantial problems . If the first month ' s figures from Shuttle by United are an indication , it ' s unlikely that the airline will be backing_away from these new procedures anytime soon . In its first 30 days , Shuttle by United reported that 71 % of its seats were filled , about 5 % more_than on United ' s traditional service . The airline also reported that 96 % of its shuttle arrivals were within 15 minutes of the scheduled time -- about 8 % better than for other United flights . United ' s maximum carry-on dimensions : 14 inches in_height , 9 inches in_width , 22 inches in_length . At USAir , officials started using sizing boxes nationwide about a year ago , when the airline debuted its own quick-turnaround service . USAir ' s maximum carry-on dimensions : 45 inches in combined height , width and length . Unlike its competitors , USAir also specifies a carry-on weight limit : 45 pounds , for up_to two pieces combined . At Continental Airlines , said spokesman David Messing , &quot; The main reason that we want people to be more aware is that we ' ve found that stowage problems are contributors to departure delays. &quot; Sizing boxes and other signs of tight enforcement are more obvious at eastern airports served by Continental Lite shuttle flights , but Messing said the airline is hoping to take what it learns about efficiency from Continental Lite and use it in Los Angeles and other destinations . Continental ' s maximum carry-on dimensions : 45 inches in combined height , width and length.Illustration by J . D . CROWE</TEXT>
