   <HEADLINE> ASIA ' S RESPONSE TO AIDS MARKED BY FEAR , DENIAL ; HEALTH : CONTINENT ' S HIV INFECTIONS MAY HIT 10 MILLION BY 2000 . MANY DOCTORS IN JAPAN REFUSE TO TREAT VICTIMS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Toshihiro Oishi is very lonely . Oishi is one of only two self-acknowledged AIDS victims in Japan . Two others came_out of the closet as well , but they have died , leaving Oishi and one other as the lone public symbols of Japan ' s 764 AIDS patients and 3 # 075 HIV-positives . The young photographer , who contracted AIDS from blood products used to control his hemophilia , is nearly blind in one eye , the result of a cytomegalovirus infection . But he is still vigorous , devoting his free_time to bringing AIDS awareness to Japan . It is a difficult fight . &quot; It is not easy for a person with AIDS or HIV to live_in Japanese society , &quot; Oishi said . &quot; Japanese society is still very far from being ( empathetic ) to persons with AIDS and HIV , as evidenced by the fact that , since my announcement ( at last year ' s AIDS conference in Berlin ) , no Japanese with AIDS or HIV has made his or her disease known to the public. &quot; Oishi addressed last Sunday ' s opening session of the 10th International Conference on AIDS . His talk struck a poignant chord at the meeting , which was marked by pessimism about the spread of the disease and a scattering of encouraging , if preliminary , scientific results . During his speech , Oishi asked everyone in the audience who was HIV-positive or who had AIDS to stand . The group received a warm and sustained round of applause from the audience , which included Crown_Prince Naruhito and Crown_Princess Masako . But behind this appearance of openness , observers say , is an undercurrent of fear and distrust , a bitter resentment of the &quot; Westernized morals &quot; that many Japanese believe lie behind the impending AIDS epidemic . A significant number of physicians in Japan refuse to treat AIDS victims , and many hospitals will not accept them , government officials acknowledge . &quot; We have a proven history of extremely intense discrimination against AIDS , &quot; said Dr. Kenzu Kiikuni of Tokyo Women ' s Medical College . &quot; that ' s got_to change. &quot; This contradictory attitude of public openness but private rejection of AIDS as a public health_problem is typical of the Eastern response to the disease at the first_AIDS conference held_in Asia , experts say . Public health officials from throughout the region talk_of educational_programs , condom distribution and other proactive measures , but in private they deny that their countries are threatened . &quot; The denial here is as great as it has been anywhere else in the world , &quot; said Dr. Michael H . Merson , head of the World_Health_Organization ' s Global Programme on AIDS . But the facts fly in the face of the denial . In the last 12 months , according to WHO , 3 million more people worldwide have become infected with the human_immunodeficiency_virus , which causes AIDS . &quot; The cumulative number of HIV infections to date exceeds 17 million worldwide , &quot; said Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima , director-general of WHO . &quot; If the present trend continues , the figure will . . . reach 30 ( million ) to 40 million by the year 2000. &quot; Asia will carry an increasing share of that burden . In the past year , the number of AIDS cases in Southeast_Asia has risen from 30 # 000 to 250 # 000 . Moreover , WHO predicts that the number of HIV infections in all_of Asia -- now about 2.5 million -- could quadruple to 10 million by 2000 . The suffering from the disease will be economic as well as human . According to McGraw Hill , the New York-based publisher and information service purveyor , the epidemic could cost Asian economies up_to $ 52 billion directly and in lost productivity through the end of the decade . But that is &quot; only half of the story , &quot; according to Dr. Arata Kochi , head of WHO ' s Tuberculosis Programme . &quot; It gets a lot worse &quot; when tuberculosis is considered in the equation . Fully 30 % of Asians -- as_many as 50 % in some regions -- are infected by the TB bacterium , but live their lives without becoming sick because the bacteria are trapped inside blood_cells &quot; like a cobra in a basket with the lid fastened_on , &quot; Kochi said . &quot; HIV is like an evil genie that goes_around the body pulling the lids off all_the millions of baskets. &quot; An HIV-positive person who is already infected with TB is 30 times more likely to get sick with tuberculosis than one who is HIV-negative , he said . And each of those people who get sick , if not treated , will infect 10 to 20 additional people within a year . &quot; In Asia , the number of annual TB deaths in ( HIV- and TB- ) infected people is doubling every three years , &quot; he said . &quot; We expect Asia to surpass Africa in the number of annual TB / HIV deaths by the year 2000. &quot; Merson said : &quot; We have a very narrow window of opportunity to prevent an ( AIDS ) epidemic in Asia and it is closing fast. &quot; Perhaps the most pessimistic of all at the meeting was Dr. Jonathan M . Mann of Harvard_University , who was the first head of WHO ' s Programme on AIDS . Even if all_the envisioned educational and control programs were implemented in developing countries , he said , they would fail to halt the impending catastrophe because they do not take_into_account human_rights issues , especially the rights of women . Of the estimated 1.4 million people who contracted AIDS last year , more_than a third were women , according to the Global AIDS Policy Coalition , based at Harvard_University . Although HIV-infected men now outnumber HIV-infected women 3 to 2 , according to WHO , the gap is closing and &quot; equality &quot; should be reached by the turn_of_the_century . And a cruel , ironic equality it is . Throughout the developing world , speakers said , women are subject_to the whims of fathers , brothers , husbands and pimps , with no divorce or inheritance rights of_their_own . Men often feel no responsibility to the women -- whom they view_as little better than disposable property -- and thus are immune to exhortations to use condoms and adopt other safe_sex practices . In Kenya , women are taught that when sex is not engaged in to conceive children , its purpose is to give pleasure to men , said Dorothy Onyango , a member of the International Community of Women Living With HIV and AIDS , a grass-roots network . Although male promiscuity puts married_women at risk , many Kenyan women are afraid to raise the subject of condom use for fear of embarrassing their husbands -- or , worse , sparking suspicion that they themselves are cheating . &quot; With husbands , it ' s unheard-of to use a condom , &quot; Onyango said . &quot; He will beat you , thinking you have been with someone else. &quot; &quot; Disempowered people are vulnerable , &quot; said WHO ' s Merson . &quot; ( Consider ) the untold numbers of women who fear infection from their partner , but do not have the power to insist on condom use or the economic power to leave the relationship. &quot; &quot; No matter how hard we try , traditional public health programs cannot make_up for the negative impact of this difference in societal status and realization of rights , &quot; Mann said . &quot; A group of women lawyers in Uganda has convinced me that the first_step in fighting AIDS must be to rewrite the divorce and inheritance statutes. &quot; The plight of women extends_to their children , growing numbers of whom are being orphaned or born with HIV . WHO estimates that more_than 5 million children under age 10 will lose their mothers to AIDS before the end of the decade . Because of the threat to children , one of the most exciting pieces of news at the conference , which ended last week , was the recently reported National Institutes of Health study showing that the anti-HIV drug AZT can reduce the transmission of the virus from infected mothers to children by two-thirds . But Dr. James Balsley of NIH cautioned that the long-term effects of the therapy on the children have not been determined and that the success of the approach may drop as AZT-resistant strains of the virus become more common in the population . &quot; What we are saying today may_not be true in several years , &quot; said Dr. Yvonne Bryson of UCLA . But perhaps the most important roadblock to widespread AZT use in developing countries is the cost of the drug ( $ 3 # 500 per year for regular use ) and need to infuse higher levels of it during childbirth . &quot; ( In the future ) , we have to make these treatments affordable and feasible , &quot; Balsley said . Other , isolated bits of good news were scattered through the conference . Dr. Paul Volberding of UC San Francisco reported findings that seem to resolve some of the questions that have dogged use of AZT . The bottom_line , he said , is that AZT prolongs life if given after an AIDS patient ' s CD4 count -- a measure of the health of the immune_system -- has dropped below 500 cells per microliter of blood . Administering it earlier , he said , provides no additional benefit . Several other researchers reported encouraging results with new antiviral drugs , especially the second-generation versions of the so-called protease inhibitors . These drugs , which block an enzyme that is intimately linked to viral replication , are just now entering clinical trials . &quot; It ' s going_to be a slow , evolutionary process , &quot; said Dr. Michael Saag of the University of Alabama at Birmingham . &quot; Under the best scenario , three years from now we may be getting excited by a certain combination of drugs , &quot; he said . But he cautioned that it would be more like eight years before scientists knew for_sure if they worked effectively . Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious_Diseases suggested that , in some cases , clinicians might be going_in the wrong direction . While the focus of gene therapy , vaccines and other approaches is to bolster the patient ' s underactive immune_system , he says part of the problem may be an overreaction of components of the immune_system . If so , it might be more beneficial to suppress certain immune functions . That approach was apparently supported by two papers presented by Dr. Jean-Marie Andrieu and his colleagues at the University of Paris . They reported that giving AIDS patients the immune-suppressing steroid Prednisolone in one study , and the anti-rejection drug cyclosporin A in a second , prevented progression of disease in small numbers of subjects . Twenty-seven patients who received cyclosporin showed no significant loss of CD4 cells during an average of 11 months of treatment . Fauci applauded the results , but cautioned against a rush to use the drug . &quot; There is a thin line between good and bad &quot; immune suppression , he said , and it is not clear where that line is . Researchers also drew hope from studies of so-called long-term survivors , people who have been infected by HIV for 10 , 12 or even 15 years without developing full-blown AIDS . Such individuals represent less than 5 % of the HIV-positive population . Dr. David Ho of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research_Center in New York said there are at least two important factors_in long-term survival . One is infection by a weaker strain of HIV -- what Ho termed &quot; a wimpy virus. &quot; The second is an unusual capacity of the individual ' s CD8 cells , a form of white_blood_cell , to control replication of the virus in the body . Dr. Jay A . Levy of UC San Francisco said he is very close to isolating a protein from CD8 cells , called CD8 antiviral factor , which will hold the virus in check . Ho and other researchers said identification of this protein could be one of the most important developments in AIDS research to date . And in a move unusual in today ' s competitive research atmosphere , he called_on funding agencies to give Levy more money . Although some advances have been made in AIDS research , scientists are not yet close to a cure , according to Dr. Peter Piot , president of the International AIDS Society . He concluded : &quot; Let us face the fact that AIDS is no longer an outbreak but has become endemic in many countries , and will be an integral part of the human condition for a very long_time to come. &quot;</TEXT>
