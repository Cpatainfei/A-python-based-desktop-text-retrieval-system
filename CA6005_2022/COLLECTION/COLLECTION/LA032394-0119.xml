   <HEADLINE> TRADE_DEFICIT UP 50 % ON RECORD DROP IN EXPORTS ; COMMERCE : EVEN WITH SERVICES ADDED IN , IMPORTS OUTPACED EXPORTS BY $ 6.3 BILLION IN JANUARY , GOVERNMENT SAYS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The U.S. trade_deficit soared 50 % in January , driven by a record decline in exports , the government said Tuesday . The jump from the previous month occurred even though the scale for measuring the nation ' s trade posture was expanded to include its surplus in exported services and deficit in imported merchandise . The rate of increase , the largest in nearly a year , raised a red flag that trade tensions could mount in coming months . However , the $ 6.3-billion January trade_deficit was far from the highest in recent months . The Commerce_Department , adjusting figures from earlier months to include services as well as merchandise , said the January deficit fell_short_of the $ 7.2-billion monthly average for all_of 1993 . The monthly deficit in 1993 ranged from a high of $ 8.5 billion in October to a low of $ 4 billion in January . The services trade surplus grew slightly in January , but the small improvement was overwhelmed by a $ 2.3-billion increase in the merchandise trade_deficit . Merchandise exports plunged $ 2.7 billion , surpassing the previous record of $ 1.8 billion in 1986 . The $ 6.3-billion trade_deficit &quot; is a big number , &quot; said Jeffrey Schott of the Institute for International Economics in Washington . &quot; The significant story is that you had a sharp increase in 1993 over 1992 , and that trend is not abating . We could see a higher trade_deficit this year than last. &quot; In 1993 , the United States imported $ 132 billion more in goods than it exported . Alan Stoga , an economist at Kissinger &amp; Associates in New York , found a silver_lining . The decline in exports reflects the weak economies of many of America ' s trading partners , he said , while persistently high U.S. imports are &quot; a clear sign of the strength of the U.S. economy. &quot; The measurement of the trade_balance was changed to include services to better reflect the overall trade picture and the significant role that non-traditional business_activities play in the global economy . Services include a wide variety of economic activities such_as transportation , insurance , education , advertising , research and engineering . They represent 29 % of U.S. exports , up from 18 % in 1980 . Merchandise includes the more traditional products of an economy : agricultural and manufactured goods , as well as commodities . &quot; What we learned today was that our trade position in the world reflects a wider variety of forces in addition to those involving the flows of merchandise , &quot; Commerce_Secretary Ronald H . Brown said in a statement .</TEXT>
