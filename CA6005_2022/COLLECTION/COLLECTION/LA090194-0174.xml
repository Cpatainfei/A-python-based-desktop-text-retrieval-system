   <TEXT> Murder_suspect John J . Famalaro waived extradition Wednesday and could be transported to Orange County as early as today to face charges he bludgeoned a Newport Beach woman and kept her nude , handcuffed corpse in a freezer for three years . Famalaro , 37 , answered in a loud , steady voice when Yavapai County Superior_Court Judge Raymond W . Weaver Jr . asked whether he was prepared to return to California . &quot; I am , your honor , &quot; Famalaro replied . Weaver then ordered Famalaro into the custody of Costa Mesa police and the former house_painter , wearing an orange jail uniform , his hands and ankles shackled , shuffled from the courtroom . Law_enforcement officials have remained tight-lipped about Famalaro ' s travel_plans . Arizona defense_attorney Thomas K . Kelly said he believes the process will be kept secret because of safety concerns for Famalaro , one of Orange County ' s most notorious murder_suspects . The former Lake Forest resident has pleaded not_guilty to the charges against him . He faces a possible death sentence if convicted of killing Denise Huber , 23 , who disappeared in June , 1991 . Her body was found July 13 in a freezer stowed inside a stolen rental truck parked in the driveway of Famalaro ' s country_club home_in Dewey , near Prescott . Court documents made public Wednesday also reveal the lengths Famalaro allegedly went_to in_order to keep the freezer operating . When moving the appliance earlier this year from Orange County to Yavapai County , Famalaro stopped several times at various stores to plug_in the freezer , according to court records . An acquaintance of Famalaro ' s , Jason Clabaugh , told detectives he helped Famalaro make the move_in exchange for $ 100 and a return flight to California , according to court records . Clabaugh -- who said his mother once dated Famalaro -- said Famalaro insisted on plugging the freezer in_for at least an hour at a time . Famalaro claimed he did not want meat and groceries to spoil in the freezer , which was duct-taped shut , according to the records . Authorities found the freezer in the same condition when they discovered it at Famalaro ' s home . Clabaugh also told authorities he also helped Famalaro move the freezer in the summer of 1992 from a storage facility in Laguna Hills to a storage_locker in San Clemente , according to the records filed_in support of Famalaro ' s extradition . Huber was last seen alive on June 3 , 1991 , as she was returning home from a rock_concert . Her car broke_down on the Corona del Mar Freeway less than two miles from her home . Famalaro , who once was enrolled in the Los Angeles County Sheriff ' s training academy for reserve officers , was arrested after law_enforcement officers investigating a report of a stolen truck in his driveway found the body . Jurisdiction later shifted to Orange County when authorities said they discovered traces of Huber ' s blood in a Laguna Hills storage facility where Famalaro was living at the time of her disappearance . Authorities said they believe that Famalaro kidnaped , lured or forced Huber to the facility , and bludgeoned her . Some law_enforcement officials speculate Famalaro may have been posing as a police_officer , using a homemade uniform found in his home . Documents filed_in support of a search_warrant show Famalaro purchased the 23-cubic-foot freezer on June 10 , 1991 -- just days after Huber ' s disappearance -- and charged the $ 562.49 total to his American Express charge_card . The appliance was delivered to the Laguna Hills storage facility on June 12 , 1991 . A delivery receipt was signed &quot; J . Famalaro , &quot; according to the records made public Wednesday . The blood at the storage facility and the purchase of the freezer have led authorities to believe Huber was murdered shortly after her abduction and kept_in the freezer ever since .</TEXT>
