   <HEADLINE> SKATING FIGURES AS FOCAL POINT OF CBS ' WINTER GAMES COVERAGE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> In January of 1984 , a month before it would televise the Winter_Olympics at Sarajevo , Yugoslavia , ABC agreed to pay $ 309 million for rights to the 1988 Winter_Olympics at Calgary , Canada . The deal , made in Lausanne , Switzerland , left a sour taste in the mouths of Roone Arledge and other ABC executives . They believed they had been had . The bidding was turned_into an open auction by Barry Frank , acting_as a consultant to the International Olympic Committee , and it pushed the price higher than anyone believed possible . The $ 309 million was three times greater than the $ 91.5 million ABC had paid_for the Sarajevo Winter Games . Donna de Varona , who was then Arledge ' s assistant , recalls that Frank had ABC over a barrel . &quot; Roone was very big on motivating the troops , and losing out on the Calgary Olympics one month before the Sarajevo Olympics would have killed morale , &quot; De Varona said . &quot; Frank knew he could take Roone to the wall. &quot; Frank got his price , but the Calgary Winter Games would be the last Olympics televised by ABC . By agreeing to pay so_much , ABC took itself out of the bidding for the 1988 Summer Olympics at Seoul , Korea , which went_to NBC for $ 400 million . De Varona recalls that Arledge told IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch that , at these prices , there was no way one network could televise two Games in the same year , as ABC had done during the years it billed itself as &quot; the network of the Olympics. &quot; If Arledge was right , one network would always be automatically eliminated from the bidding . There was a solution , however . Arledge suggested that the IOC stagger the Winter and Summer Olympics , holding one every two years instead of both every four years . The IOC , normally a slow-moving , cautious group , acted quickly . Meeting at Lausanne in October 1986 , the IOC , prompted by Samaranch and its 11-member executive board , broke a 70-year-old tradition and rather quietly and without much fanfare agreed to stage a Winter Games in 1994 and continue thereafter at four-year intervals . So now CBS , only two years after televising the Winter_Olympics at Albertville , France , will be televising another . Only last month , CBS also won the rights to the 1998 Winter Games at Nagano , Japan , with a bid of $ 375 million , which was $ 80 million more_than the rights fee for this month ' s Winter_Olympics at Lillehammer , Norway . CBS has lost the NBA , major_league baseball and the NFL , but now it can bill itself as &quot; the network of the Winter Olympics. &quot; &quot; We feel that we have the experience and the confidence in our production and sales staffs to do the Winter_Olympics better than anyone , &quot; said Neal Pilson , president of CBS Sports . &quot; NBC knows the Summer Olympics , and that gives them an advantage there. &quot; And the new setup -- an Olympics every two years -- is good for everyone in television . &quot; There are only positives , &quot; said Mark Harrington , CBS ' vice_president in_charge of Olympic coverage . Mike Klatt , coordinating producer of TNT ' s coverage , echoed that sentiment . The big pluses are ( 1 ) it spreads_out sales , meaning sponsors aren ' t asked to support two Olympics in one year ; and ( 2 ) it spreads_out promotional aspects . It would seem also to be a plus for viewers . They no longer will have a four-year wait for an Olympic competition . * CBS will devote 120 hours to the Lillehammer Winter Games , with 50 hours in prime_time . TNT will add 45 hours of supplemental weekday coverage of the event , which opens next Saturday and runs_through Feb . 27 . CBS generally will have three blocks of coverage , with a fourth added_on some weekend days . Weekdays , coverage will run 7 to 9 a.m. , 8 to 11 p.m. and 12:37 to 1:37 a.m. TNT ' s weekday coverage will run from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. With Lillehammer nine hours ahead of the West Coast , almost all_of CBS ' programming will be tape-delayed . Some of TNT ' s will be live . Greg Gumbel will be the host of CBS ' prime-time coverage , replacing Tim McCarver and Paula Zahn , who split that chore at Albertville in 1992 . Rick Gentile , CBS ' senior_vice_president of production , admits that the &quot; fit wasn ' t right &quot; with McCarver and Zahn . Of Gumbel , he said , &quot; He ' s an easy look and listen , a good traffic_cop , personable and a good_story teller. &quot; Oversimplifying it , Gumbel said , &quot; My job is to make_sure I don ' t make people throw up. &quot; He added : &quot; I ' m no genius . If it was up_to me , I ' d mount the goalie on the goalie-cam ( rather than the other way around ) . &quot; Gumbel ' s younger brother , Bryant , was the prime-time host for NBC at the 1988 Seoul Olympics . Similarities between Greg and Bryant are only coincidental . If Bryant is three-piece suits , Greg is jeans and a T-shirt . But don ' t bad-mouth Bryant to Greg . &quot; One time someone came_up_to me and said : ' You ' re not the jerk your brother is , ' &quot; Greg said . &quot; My response was , ' Have you ever met my brother ? ' He said he hadn ' t , so I told him he didn ' t know what he was talking about. &quot; Gumbel co-anchored the weekend morning broadcasts from Albertville in ' 92 . Zahn returns for the Lillehammer Games . She and Harry Smith will co-anchor the weekday morning telecasts ; Andrea Joyce and Jim Nantz will handle the weekend daytime slots and Pat O ' Brien will again be host of the late-night shows . Hosts for TNT include John Nabor , Nick Charles and Fred Hickman . Executives of CBS and TNT will meet each weekday to decide which network gets what . CBS has priority . TNT ' s Klatt said his network will devote considerable time to hockey , with a complete or almost-complete game each day . Figure_skating figures to be CBS ' big sport .</TEXT>
