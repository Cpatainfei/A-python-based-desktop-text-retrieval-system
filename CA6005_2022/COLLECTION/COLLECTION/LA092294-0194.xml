   <HEADLINE> COMPTON TO CREATE OFFICE FOR RACIAL CONCERNS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> After nearly two months of simmering racial tension between blacks and Latinos , the Compton City_Council has agreed to create an Office of Human Relations . Latino activists had requested a human relations office that would deal exclusively with Latino concerns . City_Council members , however , decided that the office should be concerned with all ethnic_groups after Samoan residents complained about possibly being excluded , council_members said . Other changes sought by Latinos -- including a tougher affirmative_action plan and creation of a civilian police review board -- were delayed or met with strident objections during a sometimes acrimonious meeting Tuesday night . After more_than two hours in the pre-council meeting workshop , Latino activist Pedro Pallan had mixed feelings on what was the first meeting between city leaders and the United Coalition of Compton . &quot; Well , I ' m optimistic , &quot; said Pallan , president of the coalition . The Latino coalition was formed after a videotape , depicting a black police_officer beating a Latino teen-ager July 29 , was released to the media . The tape , repeatedly broadcast on local television_stations , sparked several demonstrations in front of City_Hall last month by Latinos who accused the city of racism . The harsh words of those protests left some city officials , almost all_of whom are black , with lingering bitterness . &quot; The City_Council , the personnel board and everybody here is being accused of discriminating against Latinos , &quot; City Clerk Charles Davis said before storming out of the workshop . &quot; I think you ' re trying to intimidate this council , and I think it ' s wrong. &quot; Davis ' reference_to the city ' s personnel board reflected the major focus of tension between the two groups : perceived racism in the city ' s hiring practices . Coalition members presented officials with statistics , put_together by the city for a federal commission , showing that since 1986 the number of Latinos in the city ' s work_force has hovered around 10 % . During the same period , blacks have held about 78 % of the jobs . Between the 1980 and 1990 censuses , however , Compton ' s black population dropped_by 21 % and the number of Latinos rose by 131 % . City officials now estimate the Latino population at 51 % . Assistant City_Manager Paul Richards countered with his own statistics showing that Latino employees outnumber blacks working for some city contractors and in many of the area ' s shopping plazas . That comparison angered most coalition members . &quot; You ' re mixing red apples with green apples , &quot; Pallan said . &quot; We ' re talking_about public and private institutions . They ' re different. &quot; Mayor Omar Bradley also became upset during the exchange , saying , &quot; If you don ' t want to give us credit where we have made strides , then you ' re not negotiating in good faith. &quot; The city ' s promise to revise its 20-year-old affirmative_action plan to include target dates by which more Latino employees should be hired was put_on hold by the council after both sides said they needed time to study the lengthy document . Other changes sought by Latinos , such_as creation of a civilian police review board and a request that the coalition be given the power to appoint members to the city ' s boards and commissions , met with strident opposition . Councilwoman Marcine Shaw said she was unwilling to give_up her &quot; hard-earned right &quot; to make appointments , which are made only by the council . Then Shaw and other council_members objected to a police review board , largely because the coalition said the board should have the authority to discipline police misconduct . &quot; My husband was a police_officer , &quot; Councilwoman Jane D . Robbins said . &quot; So you know I ' m not going_to be happy with that. &quot; The Office of Human Relations was reluctantly agreed to by coalition members and unanimously approved by the council . Both sides agreed to meet again , in hopes of finding common_ground on some of the lingering issues .</TEXT>
