   <HEADLINE> CENTERPIECE : INN FOR A REAL TREAT ; COUNTY B &amp; BS LET YOU ESCAPE WITHOUT VENTURING FAR FROM HOME . THE SETTINGS ARE PASTORAL , ACCOMMODATIONS ELEGANT TO COZY . AND ALL OFFER A BIG DOSE OF CHARM .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> So you want to get_away from it all . Just for a night or two . No cooking , no cleaning , no kids , no chaos . No time . No time to drive to that little getaway four hours up the coast . No time to fight the Los Angeles traffic and fly to that little getaway . What to do ? Stay right here in Ventura County . Book yourself a room at a bed and breakfast inn . There are at least seven operating in the county , including the two newest ones in Santa Paula . Feeling romantic ? How about the Madame Pompadour room at La Mer in Ventura . Along with the elegant French decor , you get an ocean view , wood-burning stove , balcony and private entrance . Feeling sultry ? Check_out the Casablanca room at the Fern Oaks Inn in Santa Paula , where the canopied wicker bed lends a tropical feel , and you can watch the moon rise over the mountains from a private veranda . Bed and breakfast retreats are_on the rise in California . But they ' re not the casual European-style bargain spots they were once patterned after . Now they are somewhere between cute and elegant , and the prices are up there with the nicer hotels . In California alone there are 760 B &amp; B ' s ( more_than 500 north of Monterey ) , with a burst of new ones in the last five years , according to the California Assn . of Bed and Breakfast Inns . Why the popularity ? People can no longer afford to take the traditional two-week vacation , so they scout out spots they can get_away to for two days , according to Cheryl Eigenhuis , owner of the Fern Oaks Inn . &quot; They don ' t want to spend all their time on_the_road , &quot; said Eigenhuis , whose clientele is mostly from the Los Angeles area , but with a surprising number from Ventura County . One local was Mary Doll of Santa Paula , who splurged on her 40th birthday and spent the night there with her husband , Dan . That would have been special enough , but the couple also invited friends to stay overnight and enjoy a catered dinner Eigenhuis prepared_for the occasion . &quot; We all had breakfast in the morning , &quot; Doll said . &quot; I had all my friends around me . It was a great birthday. &quot; If you decide to try_out a B &amp; B , here ' s what you ' ll need to know : * Expect to pay an average of $ 120 a night , according to the association ' s state-wide estimate . In Ventura County , the cost ranges from a low of $ 50 for a room with a shared bathroom , up_to $ 155 . * Most inns now provide rooms with private bathrooms . The owners agree that people are more hesitant these days to share a bathroom with strangers . * Although some places will serve you breakfast in bed , be prepared_for the communal breakfast , which brings you face to face with strangers over coffee_cake and Belgian_waffles . &quot; People make friends -- they exchange addresses , &quot; said Gisela Baida , who owns La Mer with her husband , Mike . * Expect a cozier ambience than a hotel , a historical flavor , antiques and collectibles , complimentary wine or tea in the afternoon , distinctive rooms , better quality linens , libraries and usually a congenial owner on the premises . * Don ' t expect a television or telephone in the room , swimming_pool , fax machine , gift_shop or someone to carry your luggage to your room , which often is up a flight of stairs . * In older inns ( and most of them are ) be prepared_for thin walls . This was a drawback for a Ventura couple whose stay_at a local B &amp; B was crimped by the chatty couple in the next room . There may be other pitfalls . Dave and Terri Slone , who celebrated their 15th anniversary recently at La Mer , will tell you about the B &amp; B they once stayed in along the central coast . &quot; It was at the on-ramp to the 101 , &quot; Terri Slone said , &quot; and the 18-wheelers . . . . &quot; Bed and breakfast inns have transformed over the last 10 or 20 years , according to Sandy LaRuffa , director of the state association , based near Santa Cruz . What was then a sideline for someone with a big house and a spare bedroom or two is now a full-blown business . &quot; It ' s moved from being a hobby to the professional arena .

Doris Scott and her late husband Bud built the 5 # 000-square-foot Spanish-style home themselves in 1968 , modeling it after a Colonial hacienda they had seen in a village in northern Mexico . It was the 1984 Summer Olympics that drew them into the bed and breakfast business . When the call went_out for Ojai Valley residents to open their homes to athletes , the Scotts did exactly that . Afterward , they expanded the guest quarters . Now there are seven rooms -- three in the main house , two in a converted caretaker ' s home , and two others on the grounds . The buildings are part of a seven-acre estate they call the Gardens of Perpetual Spring , so named for the 2 # 000 flowers , shrubs and trees the family has planted .

On weekends there is a two-night minimum . For information , call 646-4528 . VENTURA La Mer : If you want a taste of Europe , come_to La Mer .

The only television is in the parlor . For information , call 643-3600 . Bella Maggiore Inn : This bed and breakfast inn has more of a hotel feel to it than the others , perhaps because it has 24 rooms and it ' s wedged into a downtown business block . Named for Lake Maggiore in northern Italy , the inn has a European ambience that visitors experience as soon as they see the carved stone on the front of the building and the window awnings . Inside , the lobby has an impressive Italian chandelier , grand_piano , artwork and a fireplace . But the inn ' s most stunning feature is the large ivy-covered courtyard where guests eat breakfast at private tables . Nearby a fountain spews water , and the trees overhead filter the sunlight . Here guests get a full breakfast -- omelets , French_toast or maybe Greek-style eggs -- along with a cold buffet of fruit , bagels and muffins , cereal and yogurt . Recently the inn opened its courtyard dining to the public too . Upstairs , the rooms all have telephones and televisions . They are not decorated with antiques and collectibles but they do have some charming touches , such_as the hand-painted scrollwork on the walls . Another charming , not to mention historical , touch is a ghost named Sylvia , who , as legend has it , was a prostitute during the 1940s . She fell on hard_times and hanged herself , the story goes . Now believers say her presence is felt in the aroma of cheap rose perfume . The building was renovated in 1984 , and has been managed by owners Tom and Cyndi Wood since then . In the 1920s and 1930s , it was &quot; El Nido Hotel. &quot; The building was designed by Albert C . Martin , who also designed Ventura ' s City_Hall and Grauman ' s Chinese Theater in Los Angeles .
