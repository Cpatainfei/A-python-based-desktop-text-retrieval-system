   <HEADLINE> TABLE_TALK ; OPINION BREAKER ; BRUCE AMES : STANDING BY HIS SCIENTIFIC GUNS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> &quot; Would you like a coffee ? &quot; asks Bruce Ames sociably . It might seem an odd offer . Ames is famous for having pointed_out that a cup of coffee contains 10 milligrams of natural carcinogens . As a matter_of_fact , Ames , who is 65 , likes coffee . He and his Italian wife collect old espresso machines , and he brews a respectable cup . Besides , Ames never meant to scare people away from coffee . He was making_a_point about pesticides : Ten milligrams is how much artificial pesticide residue the average person ends_up ingesting in a year . In other words , eating non-organic produce for a year is no more dangerous than drinking one cup of coffee . And what ' s the harm in that ? Ames ' scientific credentials are imposing : chief of the microbial genetics section at the National Institutes of Health , chairman of the biochemistry department at University of California , Berkeley , member of the National Academy of Sciences . He has published 300 science papers , won numerous scientific awards and served on the board of directors of the National Cancer Institute . At one time , he was a well-known critic of pesticides and synthetic food_additives such_as saccharin . &quot; There is no question that society is going_to pay_for all_the pesticides that have been used in the past , &quot; he told the New York Times ominously in 1977 , &quot; through increases in birth_defects and cancer , but no one knows exactly what the price will be and when it will be paid. &quot; * But about 15 years ago he started casting doubt on the idea that pesticides pose a major health risk . Today he ' d go_further and suggest that panic about the dangers of technology leads to policies that are not just inappropriate but downright dangerous to our health . He sits in his office in Berkeley , surrounded by ceiling-high cases full of books and periodicals , and tells how his ideas developed , beginning the tale in the mid-1960s , when he was still at the National Institutes of Health , years before he became either an opponent or an advocate of pesticides . &quot; I was always sort of half in genetics and half in biochemistry , &quot; he says . &quot; We were mutating bacteria to see how ( genetic ) regulatory pathways worked . I was interested in how genes got turned_on and turned_off . &quot; And then at one point , as a sort of side project , I started wondering about all_the new chemicals coming_into the environment . I was reading too many labels on potato_chip packages , &quot; he says , chuckling . &quot; I thought if some of these chemicals were mutagens ( agents that change genes ) , that would n ' t be good . &quot; In those days , people didn ' t know what was causing cancer . There was an old theory that chemicals that caused cancer were mutagens -- they were working by mutating the DNA . But a lot of carcinogens turned_out not to be mutagens , and people said no , carcinogens are working in some mysterious way , but not as mutagens . &quot; Now , being a geneticist , all my intuition said mutagens had to be carcinogens . Cancer is when you have a cell that is different in some way , and the way you get that is by mutating it . Then in the cancer field a_few people started showing that , say , benzopyrene , which is a very un reactive compound , isn ' t the real carcinogen . It ' s metabolized in the body into other chemicals , and some of those are reactive. &quot; * Ames had developed a simple test ( see box ) that for many purposes replaced the older way of finding_out whether a chemical might be carcinogenic . Before Ames , the only way to test for carcinogenicity was to try a chemical on animals , mostly rats or mice , for several years to see whether any of them developed cancer . Typically , the amount of the chemical given would be the Maximum Tolerated Dose ( MTD ) , which is just less than the amount that would kill them outright by poisoning . Since virtually all chemicals are poisonous at very high doses , Ames and many other scientists believe that MTD tests do not show that a chemical is carcinogenic at low doses , only that cells may become cancerous under extreme stress . Ames also stresses that MTD levels bear no relationship to the amount of a chemical a person encounters in the real_world . However , MTD tests were mandated by the so-called Delaney Clause , an addition to the 1958 Federal Food , Drug and Cosmetic Act , which makes_it illegal for processed foods to contain any detectable amount of a chemical that has ever been found to cause cancer , no matter how high a dose it took . Many authorities believe the Delaney Clause imposes an unrealistic standard of safety ; last year Carol Browner , administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency , spoke_of replacing it with a &quot; negligible risk &quot; standard . &quot; An animal cancer test costs a_million dollars and takes two or three years , &quot; says Ames , &quot; and ( the Ames test ) was something you could do_in an afternoon . Companies are desperate to weed out bad chemicals -- it ' s bad for business to poison people -- and they ' re right on top of things , because it ' s their own money that ' s involved . So the minute our test came_out and we showed that most of the classical carcinogens could be picked_up as mutagens , every company in the world dealing with chemicals wrote for the strains , and thousands of labs all_over the world use our test. &quot; Ames says he never thought_about patenting the test , so he ' s never made a penny from it . At any rate , the test made him famous and a hero of the anti-pesticide movement . * But in the late 1970s , his thinking changed . &quot; I got_into the field because I was thinking_about synthetic chemicals , &quot; he says . &quot; But synthetic chemicals are just a drop_in the bucket compared to the chemicals in the natural world . People started using our test and finding there were mutagens in celery and in a cup of coffee . The natural world is_full of mutagens . &quot; Then the whole environmental movement came_up -- ' If it ' s man-made , it ' s bad ; if it ' s natural , it ' s fine. ' Well , that didn ' t fit with anything I knew about toxicology , so I became increasingly suspicious of this kind of thing . &quot; Every plant has 50 or 100 chemicals that it uses to kill_off insects or predators . Plants don ' t have claws or teeth or immune_systems and they can ' t run_away . How do they defend themselves ? Chemical_warfare . Practically all_of plant evolution is chemical_warfare . We ' ve pointed_out that 99.9 % of the pesticides we encounter are natural. &quot; * As a toxicologist , Ames saw no reason to expect these natural pesticides to be safer than synthetic pesticides , to which they ' re often chemically related . &quot; People say , ' Oh , ( these natural pesticides ) have been around , we can deal with them. ' But the way we deal with them is by general defenses that are good against synthetics too . Animals don ' t deal with chemicals one at a time , because they need to deal with tens of thousands of natural poisons. &quot; Having concluded that synthetic pesticides were not the danger he had once suspected , Ames turned his inquiry to the causes of cancer . &quot; I started talking with the best epidemiologists , &quot; he says . &quot; Cancer is very complicated , so it ' s taken a long_time to sort all this out . Now I think we understand most of the causes of cancer , and we know how to prevent a lot of cancer . &quot; The incidence of cancer goes_up very sharply with age . Mice live two years ; by the end of their life span about a third of them have cancer . Monkeys live 20 or 30 years ; by the end of their life span about a third of them have cancer . People live 80 or 90 years ; by the end of our life span , about a third of us have cancer. &quot; The sharp upturn toward the end of life , says Ames , suggests that cancer isn ' t just caused by getting exposed to mutagens ; the cells themselves must be getting less resistant . &quot; If you ask evolutionary biologists why there is aging , &quot; he says , &quot; they ' ll say aging is trade-offs . They don ' t think that animals die_out of altruism , to make room for others . That doesn ' t fit anything they know about evolutionary biology . &quot; It ' s trade-offs , and the main trade-off is between reproduction and maintenance . Animals put a lot of their energy into reproduction -- they reproduce fast and get_out their children -- and maintaining the body takes second place . Plus , in the old days , humans were dying early of disease and infections , they only lived to be 30 or 40 . Now that we ' ve conquered all those diseases , we ' re living long enough to get cancer. &quot; * It turns_out that our own metabolism exposes us to danger , because it ' s based on one of the most reactive chemicals , oxygen . When a cell burns fat or carbohydrates to get energy , the byproducts include not only water but unstable compounds related to water that have extra electrons in the molecule : hydrogen superoxide , hydrogen_peroxide , hydroxyl_radical . These &quot; free_radicals &quot; quickly unload their spare electrons on other molecules in the cell ; when the other molecule is DNA , it can mean trouble . &quot; A trillion molecules of oxygen go_through each cell per day , &quot; says Ames . &quot; A current estimate is that only 100 # 000 of them actually wound some part of the DNA strand , and the cell has DNA repair mechanisms that fix all but about 1 # 000 oxidative hits a day . &quot; So that ' s pretty good , when you think_about it . But that means every day you ' re accumulating 1 # 000 more lesions ( wounds ) in every cell , so by the time you ' re old , we find a_few million oxygen lesions per cell . And when the cell divides , those turn_into mutations , or some percentage of them does . Most mutations don ' t matter , but some are in key genes and then you have cancer. &quot; These days Ames is particularly interested in the importance of diet . &quot; I think that ' s where the gold is , &quot; he says . &quot; Gladys Block , a professor at Berkeley , has analyzed 172 epidemiological studies from around the world , and what comes_out overwhelmingly is that fruits and vegetables protect you against cancer . If you compare the group eating the most fruits and vegetables with the group eating the least -- most being four or five portions per day and least being zero or one -- the difference is two- to three-fold for practically every type of cancer . Fruits and vegetables are our source of antioxidants , such_as Vitamin_C and carotenoids and a good_part of our Vitamin_E . &quot; The studies suggest that antioxidants protect not only against cancer but against heart_disease , against cataracts , against certain kinds of brain dysfunction . And it makes_sense to me , because there ' s all this oxidant damage going_on to your DNA , to your proteins , to your lipids , that we can measure . * &quot; If you ask top epidemiologists what the causes of cancer are , they ' ll say about a third is_due to smoking , about a third is_due to bad diet . About a third is_due to chronic infections such_as hepatitis-B virus , hepatitis-C virus -- they cause liver cancer , the main cancer in China and Africa . About 20 % is_due to hormones -- this is going_to add_up to more_than 100 % because cancer is multi-causal . And then a little bit is_due to occupation , a_few percent , and pollution , I think , less than 1 % . &quot; All this has made Ames more critical than ever of the anti-pesticide movement . &quot; Pesticides lower cancer rates , &quot; he insists , &quot; because they make fruits and vegetables cheaper and people buy more of them . &quot; It ' s all a matter of where you want to put the money . EPA regulations are costing 2 % of the GDP , according to EPA ' s own figures . We ' re talking_about hundreds of billions of dollars . They ' re trying to save a hypothetical life for $ 50 million per life saved , but you could give that money to the Highway Department and save a life for , say , $ 300 # 000 , improving a freeway . If you put the money into basic research , you ' re probably saving a life for $ 100 # 000 . And I think ( the life saved by EPA ) is a hypothetical life anyway . &quot; Life is very complicated . And to simplify all these things and just sell scare stories , all it does is kill people , because it diverts resources from more important things . &quot; With all_the scare stories , people don ' t know what ' s important anymore . And it turns_out what ' s important is what your mother told you : Don ' t smoke , eat a good diet , settle_down and live a moderate life . Your mother was right. &quot;</TEXT>
