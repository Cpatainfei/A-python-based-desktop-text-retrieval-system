   <TEXT> Cook seafood in eight minutes with no frying pans in an electric oven with recycled heat . Warm_up a room with a flick of the wrist . Read by the light of a bulb that lasts 3 # 000 hours and go_to_sleep knowing your computer will turn itself down when you leave it unattended . Such energy-saving techniques were showcased at Southern California Edison ' s energy convention and trade show Tuesday at the Long_Beach Arena . Some 180 exhibitors , including the Environmental Protection Agency , NASA and dozens of Los Angeles and Orange County companies displayed products and services designed to push Southern California ' s industries into an energy-efficient future . An estimated 5 # 000 visitors are expected to attend the two-day convention , concluding today , which features 31 conference sessions on topics ranging from supermarket refrigerators to hazardous waste . As electric-powered carts glided around the building , scores of business people wandered through the exhibit hall looking_for conservation ideas . Many said they were impressed by the examples of technology . &quot; I ' m taken_aback . It ' s awesome , &quot; said Kevin Deeley , building engineer for Matsushita Co . in Cypress . He had taken_note of the air-conditioning systems offered by various companies , where many rooms can be controlled by one single AC-heating unit called a &quot; ventostat. &quot; &quot; The energy savings would be phenomenal , &quot; he said , adding that he was considering implementing it for his 73-room building . Jim Corbett , Cal State Fullerton ' s central plant and utilities manager , discussed the campus ' s recent $ 6-million lighting and temperature make-over as an example of what homes and businesses could do to save energy . If homeowners did similar make-overs on their homes , they could apply for lending programs that allow the cost of such energy-efficiency devices to be added_to the mortgage . Savings from lower energy use would go_to pay_back the loan , according to exhibitors of the California Home Energy Efficiency Rating_System Inc. , a nonprofit corporation of utility companies and consumer groups in Costa Mesa . Spokeswoman Wendy Lloyd said the program , which was introduced to California last year , has given_out 30 mortgages and 12 # 000 free ratings in Northern California , where the program began . Most of the products offered , such_as infrared cooking appliances , remote-controlled temperature gauges , computers and printers programmed to shut themselves down from 180 to five watts of power when unused , an electronic ballast that offer 10 % brighter light than fluorescent_lamps at half the wattage and refrigerators with less ozone-depleting fluorocarbons have been_on the market for some time . But exhibits at this convention offered the latest and most sophisticated among those available , said Southern California Edison spokesman Bruce Mayo . &quot; It ' s not so_much about new technologies as about new applications of technologies , &quot; he said .</TEXT>
