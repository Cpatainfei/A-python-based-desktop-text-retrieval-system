   <TEXT> Toshiba America Information_Systems Inc. said Wednesday that it has started a new unit to buy copier and facsimile_machine dealerships across the nation . The creation of Topac USA Inc. , a wholly owned subsidiary of Toshiba , comes as large_numbers of independently owned copier and fax dealers are being bought_up by large regional retail distributors such_as Danka Business Systems in Florida and Alco Standard Corp . in Pennsylvania , analysts said . As a result , manufacturers like Toshiba are concerned about major distributors shutting them out of the channels by favoring only certain brands . Owning dealerships directly is one solution for them , said Pete Davidson , a market researcher and newsletter publisher based in Burbank . Already , the Topac subsidiary has acquired an independent Atlanta dealer , Omni Business Products Inc. Omni has been the largest Toshiba dealer in the Atlanta area for more_than six years . &quot; This is the first of several acquisitions that we intend to make to strengthen our distribution of office automation equipment , &quot; Atsutoshi Nishida , Toshiba America ' s president , said in a statement . The division will be headed by Dennis Eversole , who will continue to hold his current position as senior_vice_president of Toshiba America . Davidson characterized Irvine-based Toshiba America as a &quot; second-tier &quot; maker of fax and copy machines , trailing such brands as Panasonic , Sharp and Canon in market share . Because of that , he said , Toshiba must take extra steps to ensure that retailers are carrying its equipment . &quot; It ' s reaching a point where they cannot count_on independent dealers &quot; because of the consolidation in the industry , Davidson said . Toshiba America , a subsidiary of Japanese technology giant Toshiba Corp. , has annual sales of about $ 2 billion . Toshiba ' s New Venture To make_sure that its copiers and fax machines are available in retail_stores , Toshiba America Information_Systems has established a subsidiary that will buy office equipment dealerships .
