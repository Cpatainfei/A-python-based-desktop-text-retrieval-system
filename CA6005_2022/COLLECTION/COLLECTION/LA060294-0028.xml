   <HEADLINE> LIFE &amp; TIMES / WENDY MILLER : BEAUTY -- AND BRAINS -- COUNT IN THIS PAGEANT</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A pretty girl may be like a melody , but Mickey Stueck is more interested in intelligence and personality . Those are the qualities she , as pageant director , looks_for in the girls and young_women who compete in the Miss Moorpark / Miss Moorpark Teen Queen Pageant . Free-lance writer Leo Smith spent several weeks with Stueck and the contestants of the pageant to write this week ' s centerpiece story . Besides brains and character , Smith found other qualities to admire in these young_women : determination and versatility . &quot; They all had to balance schoolwork with the intensive three weeks of preparation , &quot; he said . &quot; And some had to throw_in final_exams , work and other extracurricular_activities . Stephanie Sill was hoarse one night because she had spent a good portion of the day screaming at a pep_rally . And one of the other contestants , Karen Blum , had to take_off her softball cleats before going_on stage to dance . She was always juggling the pageant responsibilities with her softball. &quot; And their energy , at least when Smith was around , never flagged . &quot; It was kind of amazing how dedicated the contestants were throughout , &quot; Smith said . A local pageant of this kind is a puny undertaking compared to a Miss USA or even a Miss California contest , nonetheless it takes a huge commitment . &quot; I know the general public tends to forget what goes_into the making of any production -- there ' s the time and energy , and there ' s also the pride , &quot; he said . &quot; The contestants and the volunteers involved really wanted it to be a quality show. &quot; So what about all_the backstage intrigue -- the false eyelash tuggings , the hair_mousse tamperings , the bodice ripping that we all assume is part of a beauty pageant ? &quot; What struck me in particular was the bond that most of the contestants had with one another . It really seemed like one extended family , &quot; Smith said . &quot; There was a tremendous camaraderie , which is something pageant director Stueck emphasizes when discussing the pageant . The contestants really seemed to be more nervous for each other_than they were for themselves . You ' d see each of them at one time or another show a desire to win , but for the most part it seemed more like a show than a contest. &quot; If you think you are ready for a beauty pageant but feel you can ' t take your thighs with you , fashion columnist Kathleen Williams writes_about a new cream that seems to have flown off the shelves in local stores since it debuted in the spring . This cream contains an asthma medication that , proponents say , promises to smooth_out the puckers and dimples and give you smoother , sleeker legs . Now all you have to do is figure_out how to get_down the ramp in those stiletto_heels .</TEXT>
