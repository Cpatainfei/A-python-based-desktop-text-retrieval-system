   <HEADLINE> EUROPE : FIVE YEARS LATER ; FIVE YEARS AFTER THE FALL OF THE WALL ; COMMUNIST EUROPE COLLAPSED IN A FEW MONTHS . BUT REBUILDING THE LIVES OF ITS PEOPLE IS A PROCESS THAT WILL TAKE MANY YEARS .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> November 9 , 1989 , the day the Berlin Wall fell and the world changed forever . Not even the most astute saw it coming . As Hungary ' s foreign_minister in the late summer of 1989 , Gyula Horn gave the order to let visiting East_Germans use his country to do a 400-mile end_run around the Berlin Wall , a move now seen as the beginning of the end for hard-line communism in Europe . &quot; I hadn ' t realized that such historical change would come_after that , &quot; Horn now says . Far to the east in his Moscow office , former Soviet President Mikhail S . Gorbachev looks_back at might-have-beens . &quot; The process could have gone_in a different way if East_Germany had changed , had opened_up to the world , &quot; he claims , recalling how he urged that country ' s leadership to steer a reform course . &quot; ( Communist_Party leader Erich ) Honecker rejected it . So did most of his entourage . And they lost. &quot; And how they lost . The breathtaking speed of East_Germany ' s demise , the sudden opening of the Berlin Wall and the rapid-fire collapse of similar regimes in Czechoslovakia , Bulgaria and Romania , all within a period of six weeks , left Europeans on both sides of the ideological divide euphoric , dizzy and woefully unprepared for the challenges of a post-Cold War world . To be sure , half a Continent has won its freedom , the military doctrine of mutually assured destruction belongs_to history and few would turn the clock back if they could . Yet no one believed it could all be so hard . Extended visits by Times correspondents to five communities in four nations paint a new , often troubling picture of post-Cold War Europe as it struggles for a new direction . What they found is a patchwork of hope , success , worry , fear and a_few pockets of total despair . They found that with socialism ' s barriers to wealth and its protection from poverty stripped away , communities -- and nations -- in the formerly Communist east are gradually separating into winners , losers and those just trying to hang_on . For the Polish industrial town of Plock , five years of freedom have brought the first millionaire , the first homeless shelter and a simple , hard truth about life without communism : No job is secure . &quot; If you are not good at your job , you will lose_it , &quot; said 20-year-old factory_worker Teresa Bonatowska . &quot; And even if you are good at your job , you may lose it. &quot; Western cash injections running at $ 100 billion a year have generated economic liftoff for eastern Germany , but the weight of history still divides Germans in other ways . &quot; I can ' t pick my countrymen , but I have more in common with Belgians and Dutch ( than with eastern Germans ) , &quot; notes Rainer Scherer , a technical_school employee in the west German city of Pforzheim . In parts of southeastern Europe , such_as the onetime Romanian industrial stronghold of Vaslui , the end of communism has only made untenable conditions worse . There , official unemployment is 37 % , and the quest_for a better life remains mired in a rut of mistrust , manipulation and defeatism . Across Romania ' s western border , the disintegration of Yugoslavia and the horrors of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina have destroyed more_than a nation and its people . They have shaken the Continent ' s belief in itself and ended the myth that Europe had moved beyond such barbarity . But whatever their experience since 1989 , one truth is agreed upon by all Europeans : Putting the Old_World back together again will take far longer than anyone initially could have imagined . &quot; I used to be very impatient , &quot; recalls Vaclav Havel , the Czech revolutionary who is now his country ' s president . &quot; Everything seemed to be moving slowly , but in the end , I have ... come_to understand that everything needs its time. &quot; TYLER MARSHALL</TEXT>
