   <HEADLINE> LILLEHAMMER : ' 94 WINTER_OLYMPICS ; HOCKEY_TEAM TRIES AGAIN FOR VICTORY ; HOCKEY : SWEDEN ' S PUCK-POSSESSION GAME AND STRONG DEFENSE PRESENT A STIFFER CHALLENGE THAN U.S. HAS FACED IN THREE TIES .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Having perfected the art of tying games , the U.S. Olympic hockey_team felt no need to practice Friday . In truth , Coach Tim Taylor gave his players a day_off to spend with friends and families . With a game today against Sweden , the tournament ' s second-seeded team and Group_B co-leader at 2-0-1 , Friday figured to be their last chance to relax for a while . Good_fortune , favorable calls and desperation on the power_play allowed them to rally for ties_in their first three games against France , Slovakia and Canada . They will need all those factors and more against Sweden , which blends playmaking and intelligent defense in a high-paced , dynamic style . The United States was 0-1-2 in pre-Olympic play against Sweden , including a 3-3 tie_in their last meeting , Feb . 9 at Goteborg , Sweden . Their most recent Olympic encounter was a 3-3 tie at Albertville in 1992 . No American team has beaten Sweden in the Olympics since a 6-3 victory in 1960 at Squaw Valley . Sweden holds a 3-0-2 edge since then . &quot; They play a puck-possession game and they also , when they don ' t have the puck , clog_up the neutral zone very well and play a strong defensive system that all_the players are committed to , &quot; Taylor said . &quot; You go_into this knowing , No . 1 , offensively you ' re not going_to have the puck a lot and , No . 2 , when you do have the puck , you ' re going to be facing a formidable defensive system . . . . &quot; You try , obviously , to be very good defensively . You go_into the game knowing Sweden is probably going_to have the puck more_than we are . We have to have a good game_plan against their neutral-zone trap . France was actually doing something similar to what I think we ' ll see from Sweden. &quot; Following Taylor ' s preordained plan , goaltender Mike Dunham , who started the tournament-opening 4-4 tie with France but backed_up Garth Snow in the next two games , will be back in goal today . It seems a curious decision , made by calculation rather than reacting to circumstances . Snow , who has five games of NHL experience , played exceptionally well against Canada , stopping a penalty shot and blunting a dangerous two-on-one chance in the waning minutes . Snow also has been a calming presence for the young American team in the last two games , with 59 saves in 65 shots . Taylor had said before the Games that he might stick_with one goalie instead of alternating if one became hot , and it ' s difficult to be hotter than Snow was Thursday . By contrast , Dunham , who at 21 is three years younger than Snow and lacks his teammate ' s NHL experience , acknowledged he was nervous against France and might have played better . Taylor became defensive when questioned about his choice and said the change was not a condemnation of Snow ' s play , but an expression of confidence in both goalies . He cited Dunham ' s strong past play against Sweden . Dunham saved 64 of 68 shots in the last two games , a loss to Sweden ' s B team and the 2-2 tie with a squad that will strongly resemble today ' s . &quot; I think Mike is a very capable and confident goaltender and I don ' t think he plays defensively . . . , &quot; Taylor said . &quot; I told you all along we have two goalies who are very capable of starting each game. &quot;</TEXT>
