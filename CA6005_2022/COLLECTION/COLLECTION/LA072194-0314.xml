   <HEADLINE> MAO , STALIN GAVE KIM OK TO WAGE WAR , DOCUMENTS SAY</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Shortly after North_Korea completed a memorial ceremony Wednesday for its late leader , Kim Il Sung , South_Korea offered a different recollection of him through Soviet documents that show he plotted the 1950-53 Korean_War with the approval of Moscow and Beijing . Seoul ' s Foreign Ministry released documents that Russian President Boris N . Yeltsin had given President Kim Young Sam during a visit to Moscow in June . They showed that Soviet dictator Josef Stalin and Chinese leader Mao Tse-tung approved Kim Il Sung ' s attack on South_Korea in June , 1950 . Three months later , when Kim asked Stalin for troop support from the Soviet_Union , China and other Communist nations , the Soviet dictator told him , &quot; Ask China. &quot; Chou En-lai , then China ' s prime_minister and foreign_minister , wanted to reject the request . But the documents show that he was overruled , according to Seoul ' s Foreign Ministry . Chinese troops entered the war in late October , 1950 . The release , in summary form , of 216 Korean War-related Soviet government records -- along with the full texts of what were called &quot; four key documents &quot; -- appeared to be timed to counteract moves among a small minority of South_Koreans to pay tribute to Kim Il Sung as a nationalist . Their disclosure , which officials here concede will upset North_Korea , also underscored earlier indications that the Seoul government is not interested in quickly rescheduling a first-ever North-South summit that Kim Young Sam and Kim Il Sung had agreed upon before the North_Korean leader ' s death July 8 . North_Korea informed the South on July 11 that it would be forced to &quot; postpone &quot; a meeting between the leaders of the two governments , which , if now held , presumably would be attended by Kim Jong Il for the North . To the surprise of South_Korean officials , Kim Jong Il , who has never delivered a speech , again remained silent during the 75-minute memorial ceremony that appeared to be designed to consolidate support for him as his father ' s successor . Kim ' s silence and his haggard appearance spurred South_Korean media to speculate that the new &quot; Dear Leader &quot; was ill . But some analysts interpreted the memorial ceremony as the official conclusion of mourning and predicted that another occasion would be created for Kim ' s debut . Officially , North_Korea has not announced Kim ' s assumption of three key positions that were held by his father .</TEXT>
