   <HEADLINE> COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS : FOUNTAIN VALLEY ; ORDINANCE ALLOWS CITY TO ASK BINGO AUDITS</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> A new city ordinance allows denial of a permit to hold games if an organization has violated state or local bingo laws in the past five years . In addition , the revised ordinance recently adopted by the City_Council allows the city to require an audit of a bingo organization ' s financial records at the group ' s expense , City Atty.Alan R . Burns said . Bingo ordinance revisions will go_into effect immediately . The city could require an audit if it wanted to verify an organization ' s expenses relating to bingo games and to ensure money is going toward charitable causes , Burns said . The Police_Department or city Finance Department are not_able to perform the financial audit to verify contributions and expenses . In most cases , however , an independent audit will not be required because most bingo games are put_on by small local high_school booster clubs and other local charities , Burns said . City forms for bingo permits will also be revised to provide more information about the use of bingo money . Officials said changes in the ordinance will help the city make_sure that only legitimate bingo operations are conducted here . According to city officials , one organization conducting bingo games in the city has been found to have commingled bingo money and paid salaries from bingo proceeds , violating state and local bingo laws.DEBRA CANO</TEXT>
