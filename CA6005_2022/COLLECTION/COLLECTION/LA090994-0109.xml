   <HEADLINE> RABIN OFFERS PLAN FOR PARTIAL GOLAN PULLBACK</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> Prime_Minister Yitzhak Rabin , seeking to break the prolonged stalemate in peace negotiations with Syria , put_forward a plan Thursday for an immediate but limited Israeli pullback in the Golan Heights in a test of Syria ' s willingness to live_in peace with the Jewish state . Rabin said Israel would then want , as part of that test , a three-year period to develop diplomatic relations and other ties before proceeding with a more substantial but phased withdrawal from the region . Although Syria has rejected with disdain all Israeli offers of a phased or partial withdrawal during nearly three years of talks , officials here stressed that the new proposal was an opening position and would improve significantly in the give_and_take of negotiations . Immigration Minister Yair Tsaban of the leftist Meretz Party described Rabin ' s offer as the most far-reaching Israel has made . Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer , a retired general and Rabin confidant , added , &quot; This is indeed the opening Israeli position. &quot; &quot; We are_on the very verge of actual negotiations , &quot; Ben-Eliezer said following a special Cabinet meeting in Tel Aviv . &quot; We are just waiting for ( U.S. Secretary_of_State Warren ) Christopher to come_to the region , and determining the positions of both sides so that actual negotiations will begin. &quot; Discussions with Syria are scheduled to resume in a week , when Christopher arrives for what Israelis hope will be an intensive shuttle between Jerusalem and the Syrian capital of Damascus . Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said he hopes agreement will be reached during the shuttle on Cabinet-level negotiations brokered by the United States . * A treaty with Syria is considered the final and essential element of Israel ' s search for peace with its Arab neighbors . Despite progress with the Palestinians and Jordan over the past year , Israel will have succeeded in securing its position in the Middle_East and in building a strategic buffer against the advance of militant Islam only when it has settled with Syria . Farouk Shareh , Syria ' s foreign_minister , said in a Dutch television interview rebroadcast in Israel on Thursday evening that his country still wants a full withdrawal , in return for which it is ready for &quot; a full and warm peace . . . even this year. &quot; But he criticized the Rabin proposal . &quot; He ( Rabin ) spoke about the withdrawal within three years . . . . But we think from a realistic point_of_view , from a logistical point_of_view and because of the small size of the Golan Heights , there is no need for a long period to conclude the withdrawal , &quot; Shareh said . Rabin , however , stopped well short of meeting this demand . Outlining the proposal after days of press speculation and his own hints , he emphasized the shallowness of the initial pullback in the Golan , perhaps without the removal of any of the Israeli settlements there , the &quot; testing period of three years &quot; and then a phased withdrawal to borders still to be negotiated . But Israeli officials , commenting on the flexibility of the new proposal , suggested that all elements -- the extent of withdrawal , the timetable , the security guarantees , the criteria for &quot; full normalization &quot; of relations -- were negotiable . Rabin , one senior official noted , &quot; had not said no to total withdrawal and , in fact , had implied that our settlements on the Golan would have to be removed in later stages. &quot; Another said , &quot; The vast majority of the Golan will go_back -- that is now clear to all. &quot; &quot; In any case , it ' s a sign that the Israeli government is sending messages and I think a very pragmatic approach to the Syrian side , &quot; Tsaban commented after the Cabinet meeting , &quot; and we are now ( awaiting ) what will be the response of the Syrian side. &quot; * Rabin was quickly engulfed in protests -- from Israeli settlers in the Golan , from the right-wing opposition and , most ominously , from hawks within his own Labor_Party who said they would fight to retain the region even if it brought_down the present government . &quot; We are against decisions that in my opinion endanger the survival of the state of Israel , &quot; said Avigdor Kahalani , a Labor member of the Knesset , or Parliament , and a retired general who fought in the Golan , warning against any retreat from the territory . Seven Labor members of the Knesset said they would support legislation requiring 70 of the 120 members_of_Parliament and then 65 % of voters in a national referendum to endorse any significant withdrawal from the Golan , which Israel effectively annexed in 1981 . * Hagai Merom , a leader of the Labor caucus in the Knesset , said this opposition would seriously undermine Rabin ' s ability to negotiate . &quot; The Syrians will come and say to the prime_minister , ' Look , you are shackled -- you don ' t even have a majority in the Knesset . Even in your own party , there are members who do not accept the possibility that you can pass such a proposal , ' &quot; Merom said . Benjamin Netanyahu , chairman of the Likud Party , convened a meeting of opposition parties and forced the Knesset ' s recall from its summer recess to debate the issue next week . &quot; We want peace with Syria , but peace with the Golan Heights , not peace without it , &quot; Netanyahu said . &quot; What has kept the peace between us and Syria in the Golan Heights over past years is that we are holding Damascus with an iron clamp : The cannon and tanks of Israeli forces are within spitting distance of Damascus . This is what keeps the peace , and the citizens of Israel do not want to abandon it. &quot; Israeli settlers in the region accused Rabin of secretly agreeing to withdraw over the three years from all_of the strategic plateau . They asserted that Israel is planning to dismantle 25 settlements in the first stage of the withdrawal and the remaining eight in the three years that follow . About 13 # 500 Israelis live_in the region . &quot; The negotiations between Syria and Israel are in the most advanced stages . . . and a breakthrough is expected in the very near future , &quot; the Golan Settlers Committee said . The settlers are planning an emergency meeting Saturday night to rally opposition to any withdrawal that brings dismantling of their communities . Rabin replied that he was not committed to any final borders . &quot; We have no agreement with the Syrians on the line we will reach at the end of negotiations , &quot; he declared in a statement . Ministers said Rabin was deliberately vague on whether the eventual withdrawal might be determined from the beginning -- as in the 1979 treaty in which Israel gave_up the Sinai for peace with Egypt -- or would be subject_to negotiations after peaceful relations were established . * But Environment Minister Yossi Sarid expressed doubt that Syria would conclude an agreement without knowing the final borders . &quot; Without determining from the beginning the final line of withdrawal the whole process will be impossible , &quot; he said , but added that an agreement involving a &quot; painful withdrawal &quot; could be reached with Syria before the end of the year .</TEXT>
