   <HEADLINE> AN AMERICAN EXPORT SUCCESS STORY ; IN EUROPE , AUSTRALIA AND RUSSIA , POPULAR AMERICAN SERIES ARE BEING RECAST AND RE-SHOT AS HOME-GROWN PROGRAMMING . IN MANY CASES , AUDIENCES DON ' T HAVE A CLUE</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The rangy former soccer star-turned-housekeeper waltzes blithely into the bathroom , towel in_hand , and stops_dead in his tracks . His boss -- a leggy advertising executive , normally high-powered but considerably less so reclined stark_naked in her bath -- lets_out a scream that would have undone the starchiest of her boarding school matrons . He retreats , she scrambles for cover , glaring . The laugh track explodes . If there ' s an odd sense of deja_vu to this scene , it ' s for good reason . Substitute a stockier Tony Danza as an ex-baseball player and Judith Light as a Madison Avenue advertising executive and &quot; Who ' s the Boss ? &quot; comes clearly into focus . In Britain , across Europe , Australia and even Russia , American television series are being resurrected , recast and re-shot as home-grown programming . &quot; Who ' s the Boss ? &quot; becomes &quot; Ein Job fur Leben &quot; on RTL in Germany and &quot; The Upper_Hand &quot; on ITV ' s Channel 3 in Britain . &quot; Maude &quot; turns_up in France 2 as &quot; Maggie. &quot; Italian viewers tune into &quot; L ' Ultimo Minuto , &quot; oblivious to the fact that &quot; Rescue 911 &quot; is the American precursor . &quot; Sesame Street &quot; is transferred from a Brooklyn brownstone to a train_station in its Norwegian adaptation and to a bazaar in the Arab version -- two of the 14 different international takes_on the PBS children ' s series . And in Russia and Australia , audiences shadow investigative reporters copied directly from &quot; 60 Minutes. &quot; This latest wave of American television exports is reformatted , as opposed to dubbed programs . They use local actors and sets and are shot from the original scripts , which have been translated and adapted by local writers and producers . In many cases , audiences have not a clue that they are watching recycled clones of American shows . &quot; If ' The Upper_Hand ' were a car , &quot; offers the show ' s producer , Christopher Walker , in an irresistible metaphor , &quot; it looks and feels British and drives like a British car , but under the hood is a huge American V-8 engine . It ' s the engineering that ' s American , the pace and the drive that moves the stories along . The factories out_in Hollywood producing these shows know what they ' re all about . We ' re benefiting from that engineering. &quot; For years , the flow had been in the opposite direction , with U.S. television producers liberally adapting British series -- &quot; Man About the House &quot; became &quot; Three ' s Company , &quot; &quot; Till Death Do Us Part &quot; turned_into &quot; All in the Family &quot; and &quot; Steptoe and Son &quot; was reborn as &quot; Sanford and Son. &quot; Several years ago , however , Walker began casting_about for new series for Britain ' s ITV network , the largest private television chain , and wound_up in Hollywood . &quot; Without making any bones about it , &quot; he says from his London studio , &quot; there was a dearth of new concepts here . Let ' s be honest : If we were brimming with wonderful , comic ideas , we would not have bothered hopping_on a plane to go looking elsewhere. &quot; Walker settled_on &quot; Who ' s the Boss ? &quot; because of its class and ethnic conflicts , its sexual tensions and the flight from the inner_city that motivates the Danza character -- all elements with which British audiences could intuitively identify . &quot; It also had kids in pivotal roles , &quot; he explains , &quot; and this was especially appealing since it was so rare for British sitcoms. &quot; &quot; The Upper_Hand &quot; has scored an enormous success , garnering 10 million viewers every week for the past 3 1 / 2 years , frequently making_it the No . 1 situation_comedy in the country . Long pilloried by the guardians of European culture but lapped_up by the European consumer , dubbed U.S. television series have been slipping of late . Local audiences no longer sit rapt watching the antics of characters , plots and sets that may be light_years from their daily lives and concerns . For just these reasons , reformatted shows have been surging forth like velociraptors . &quot; There ' s no question that reformatting has been growing exponentially over the past few years , &quot; says Paul Bricault , a Los Angeles-based media analyst with Paul Kagan Associates . &quot; A good ballpark guess would be that it accounts_for at least $ 60 million- $ 70 million of the total $ 1 billion of overseas television sales . &quot; There are a number of reasons for this growth . Dubbed American series are no longer scoring the best ratings and European broadcasters that are now making substantial revenues can afford to develop programming. &quot; Another less obvious incentive is that reformatted shows neatly sidestep European quotas for American-produced series . In France , for example , 60 % of programs must be produced in Europe . Since the reformatted series qualify as European productions , they enable European broadcasters to air American-style programs without filling their quotas . At the same time , American distributors benefit from extending the market longevity -- not to mention the profit_margins -- of American series that might otherwise be restricted . Depending_on your point_of_view , this reformatting phenomenon is either the latest glove across the face or the great video hope , a bridge enabling fledgling local programming to gain its footing . &quot; They are the first_step in national production , &quot; says Nicholas Bingham , president of Columbia-TriStar International Television . &quot; They help develop an industry which can obviously compete with American imports. &quot; Columbia-TriStar is among the most active reformatters , licensing &quot; Married . . . With Children , &quot; &quot; Who ' s the Boss ? &quot; and &quot; Maude , &quot; among other series . Other major packagers include NBC , CBS , the Dutch company Endemol Entertainment , Monaco-based Grundy Worldwide and U.S. games developer Fremantle International . &quot; Reformatting is a very important part of our strategy , &quot; Bingham explains . &quot; We cannot expect to remain exporters of American programs forever ; we need to become more involved in promoting local productions. &quot; &quot; Sesame Street &quot; has been reformatting its shows for 20 years , and its 14 international editions appear in 30 different countries . The American producers studiously avoid any hint of cultural or religious bias -- down to eliminating U.S. cars and flags -- and collaborate with local broadcasters on matching the educational focus of the shows to each country ' s school curriculum . &quot; In Germany , the emphasis is_on cognitive learning , numbers and math , &quot; explains &quot; Sesame Street ' s &quot; Baxter Urist . &quot; But next door in Holland , the Dutch concentrate_on Dutch culture . They want to ensure that recent immigrants understand the language of their adopted country. &quot; Formatting setups vary genre to genre and country to country . Game_show adaptations , for example , are the most straightforward , sitcoms the most problematic . King World ' s &quot; Wheel of Fortune &quot; airs in 25 countries with very little variation . &quot; We provide the local broadcasters with what we call the bible , &quot; explains King World president Fred Cohen , &quot; and they follow the game_plan -- how to get contestants , the questions , etc . Once the show is up and running , we check it every few months to insure they ' re adhering to our production values . It ' s much like being a master licensee for Benetton or McDonald ' s. &quot; Reality shows generally undergo more radical surgery . CBS ' hour-long &quot; Rescue 911 &quot; appears in Italy as a three-hour marathon titled &quot; L ' Ultimo Minuto , &quot; with the original protagonists of the dramatized re-creation brought_in for live interviews before a studio audience . &quot; It has the look and feel of a variety_show as much as a reality show , &quot; says James Warner , president of CBS Enterprises . &quot; that ' s the custom ; that ' s what Italians are used to watching . &quot; Typically on these shows , we change the title , provide access to all_of our segments , provide production expertise . We encourage our clients to find a local host and produce their local segments . Some countries dub our segments , some subtitle them , using the same video shot in the U.S. Their segments mirror ours so they all seem to have come from the same source . &quot; For CBS , reformatting is definitely growing . From our standpoint , it ' s the most effective way to market the reality programming that has taken_hold internationally . Overseas broadcasters are looking_for ways to access our material , and giving it a local identity does that. &quot; Not incidentally , these adaptations give new -- and very lucrative -- life to old formula series . Licensing fees for situation_comedies run_around $ 10 # 000 per episode , according to Bricault ; game_shows around $ 7 # 000 , and reality shows close to $ 5 # 000 . When production_costs are added_on , a reformatted episode of &quot; Who ' s the Boss ? &quot; in Germany , for example , will run about $ 200 # 000 , compared to $ 50 # 000 for the dubbed version . To Helmut Thoma , managing director of RTL , Germany ' s largest private television network , the quadrupling in price is worth it . &quot; A dubbed series is perceived as foreign and has only a limited ratings potential , &quot; Thoma points_out . &quot; But if you turn this same foreign series into a German version , the ratings potential is two or three times higher. &quot; Given the fact that two of the series RTL has reformatted so far -- &quot; Who ' s the Boss ? &quot; and &quot; Married . . . With Children &quot; -- have bombed , these are the words of a true believer . ( Encouraged by the success of another foreign adaptation , &quot; The Restless Years , &quot; an Australian series developed by Grundy , Thoma is ready to embark next on a reformatted &quot; Maude. &quot; ) The RTL executive is the first to admit that the local versions suffered from fundamental problems . &quot; There ' s no tradition of sitcoms here , &quot; Thoma explains . &quot; Finding the writers in Germany is very difficult and the German actors simply didn ' t understand the scripts . Even the sets looked more American than German . The audiences could not relate to the shows at all. &quot; With &quot; Who ' s the Boss ? &quot; Thoma found frankly that &quot; the German actors were not as_good_as the Americans. &quot; The hybrid set posed another stumbling_block . John Barber , the show ' s American producer , recalls his dismay at befuddled German audiences recoiling from it , protesting : &quot; What is this ? It ' s an American house with German furniture. &quot; The final shot in the foot was the network ' s ill-advised slot for the reformatted weekly show -- three hours after the daily dubbed version . Ignominiously , the German adaptation drew consistently poorer ratings , and the German press ridiculed it with headlines reading : &quot; Beware forgery. &quot; The adaptation process was fraught with growing pains and cultural confusions , starting with the series ' initial premise . &quot; I have to be a bit careful about stereotyping the German sense_of_humor , but the Germans can be extremely rigid , &quot; Bingham delicately observes . &quot; I remember one conversation where someone objected , ' Ah , but in Germany , women do not have male housekeepers. ' And we answered , quite tongue in cheek , ' Really , how surprising , in Britain and the United States , nearly all women have male housekeepers. ' We had a little difficulty explaining to them that ' s part of the fun and fantasy of the thing. &quot; The next major hurdle was training German scriptwriters how to write for this new animal -- the totally unfamiliar situation_comedy -- using German actors who had never before played in them . &quot; Part of the process that makes American sitcoms so contemporary is giving feedback to the writers on how the show is actually coming_to_life , &quot; explains Barber . &quot; This proved very confusing to the writers and the cast , since in German TV , the finished script is considered untouchable . Still , they ended_up adapting quite well , taking risks no one had ever asked them to take before. &quot; The series was produced in Berlin with a cast drawn from all_over the country . Despite a fleeting resemblance to Tony Danza , his German counterpart lacked Danza ' s energy and stage presence . &quot; We had to find ways of protecting him more so he would not be overwhelmed and would be as attractive to women as Danza , &quot; says Barber . In the adaptation process , American institutions are Germanized : Thanksgiving dinner might become the pre-Lenten carnival celebration Fasching ; a suburban outdoor barbecue set instead in a beer garden . Generally speaking , about 75 % of the jokes go_over with foreign audiences with simple translation . But as Bingham points_out , &quot; It ' s easier to do sitcoms that are not full of one-liners , but where the emphasis is_on the situation more_than the jokes driving the comedy. &quot; Occasionally , what seem to be sure-fire routines in one country draw an absolute blank in others . &quot; Sesame Street ' s &quot; Urist recalls one memorably frustrating meeting with producers of the Mexican version screening a skit entitled &quot; What ' s Alive. &quot; &quot; Tully was hopping_up and down , crying_out : ' Pick me , pick me ! ' We were dying with laughter and the Mexicans were stone-faced . How do you teach a sense_of_humor ? &quot; he asks rhetorically . For the_British &quot; Who ' s the Boss ? &quot; Walker ultimately had to jettison all_the scripts that were centered around American high_schools . &quot; The whole culture of cheerleaders , proms and football jocks doesn ' t readily translate to an English environment , &quot; he explains . By contrast , episodes where the ex-footballer is ridiculed at an exclusive boarding_school and an equally exclusive golf_club were another story . The producer found that &quot; shows based on social snobbery worked better in Britain than in the original. &quot; &quot; People say that Brits and Americans are divided by a common language , but a lot of the jokes did transfer . The main thing I toned_down were the vulgar elements -- that sort of slapstick , physical humor. &quot; If the American formula continues to draw audiences , why not simply -- and more cheaply -- make a close study of American series and write your own ? By and large , this has not happened -- for the practical reason that this imitative , unauthorized borrowing generally does not work as well . In cases where it does , it has struck fear and resentment in the executive suites and has undoubtedly nudged American distributors to speed_up the pace of licensing reformat deals . NBC ' s Todd Leavitt , executive_vice_president of NBC International , can barely contain his contempt for European -- and particularly French -- spinoffs . &quot; After the dubbed version of ' Saved by the Bell ' proved such a great success in France , there was a whole crew of ' derivative ' products like ' Helene et les Garcons ' ( ' Helen and the Boys ' ) that were French versions of our shows , without the time and attention to plot we take , &quot; he complains from the network ' s Burbank office . &quot; They would shoot an episode in two days and eventually the show gobbled_up 60 % of the audience share . &quot; Where our shows use between eight to 15 writers doing 22-24 episodes a year , the_French situation_comedy will have two to four writers churning_out 50 episodes and more a year . Where we spend north of $ 600 # 000 per episode , the_French will spend the equivalent of $ 125 # 000. &quot; Voila : another convincing argument encouraging American distributors to turn_to format licensing -- heading foreign producers off at the pass while simultaneously stretching_out the profitable life of long-running series . &quot; The big advantage to reformatting American shows , &quot; says Peter Brouwer , president of Endemol Entertainment , B.V. , &quot; is that you know you have a proven success on your hands. &quot; Endemol ' s latest project is an upcoming adaptation of &quot; The Mary Tyler Moore Show &quot; for the German network RTL Plus . &quot; This is a whole new way of working with American distributors , &quot; Brouwer maintains . &quot; It ' s a shift in the industry that the European Commission very much favors . They want to take_advantage of American television expertise and let European writers and producers master the story structures themselves . It ' s a great boon to the European television industry . &quot; The key to success , &quot; he adds , alluding to the failure of earlier reformatted series in Germany , &quot; is not to let audiences know they are watching reformatted American shows. &quot;</TEXT>
