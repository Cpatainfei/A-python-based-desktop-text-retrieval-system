   <HEADLINE> CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS ; GOVERNOR ; BROWN-GARAMENDI MEDIA WAR GROWS INCREASINGLY BITTER</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The media war in the Democratic gubernatorial campaign grew increasingly bitter Thursday as John Garamendi ' s campaign denounced as false a Kathleen Brown ad accusing the insurance commissioner of possibly costing a woman her old-age pension . In another new ad , Brown contends that Garamendi flip-flopped on the death_penalty -- 18 years ago . Garamendi emphatically denied changing his views on the death_penalty , and the Brown campaign had seemingly inconclusive support for the contention . Brown ' s television commercials this week -- her first direct response to Garamendi ' s underdog attacks -- were broadcast as the campaign headed into the final weekend before Tuesday ' s primary . Garamendi has tried to use Brown ' s personal opposition to the death_penalty to leverage an upset for the Democratic nomination for governor . Brown , consistently the leader in opinion polls , has contended that her personal views are not relevant because she pledges to enforce the death_penalty , if elected , just as rigorously as would Garamendi or Republican Gov . Pete Wilson . Brown began running the pension ad to counter any Garamendi surge as the campaign closed . In the ad , 64-year-old Helen McGrath of Concord appears on the screen saying that after her husband died , she depended_on payments from an Executive Life_Insurance Co . policy to help her in her old_age . Then she adds , &quot; Because of John Garamendi , I don ' t know that I ' ll see any of these payments in my lifetime. &quot; But the state Insurance Department said Thursday that McGrath already had received a $ 52 # 500 payment in October , 1991 , and is guaranteed to get_at least $ 231 # 900 of the original $ 270 # 000 she had banked on . She may ultimately get all $ 270 # 000 on basically the same schedule as first promised , department spokesman Bill Schulz said . &quot; Really ? &quot; McGrath said to a reporter who relayed the news . &quot; How wonderful , if true . I ' ll believe it when I see it . . . . It would be nice if they put it in writing. &quot; But Schulz said McGrath and thousands of other policyholders who opted for a replacement annuity plan from the successor to Executive Life had signed documents acknowledging the proposed payments and schedule . Asked why she said in the TV ad that &quot; I don ' t know if I ' ll see any of these payments in my lifetime &quot; when she already had gotten $ 52 # 500 , McGrath responded , &quot; Fifty-two thousand -- big deal. &quot; John Whitehurst , Brown ' s campaign press secretary , said , &quot; She ' s talking_about her future payments , &quot; although that was not clear in the ad . In his fourth month as insurance commissioner in 1991 , Garamendi seized Executive Life on the grounds that it was sinking into insolvency under a heavy debt of junk_bonds . Critics accused him of selling_off Executive Life assets at bargain prices , but Garamendi said he had to act_as he did under state law requiring him to protect policyholders ' investments . He says that 92 % of all policyholders eventually will recoup their full investments . Also on Thursday , Brown began running an ad that opens with an announcer ' s statement : &quot; What John Garamendi doesn ' t want you to know -- Garamendi opposed the death_penalty . Flip-flopped . Then said it couldn ' t solve the problem. &quot; Garamendi insisted that he never had opposed the death_penalty in his public life , going_back to his first run_for the state Assembly in 1974 . Every vote on the death_penalty during his 16-year career in the Legislature was in support it , campaign manager Darry Sragow said . The major sources of the Brown allegation were one paragraph from a story in the Stockton Record in 1974 and one paragraph from the same newspaper in 1976 when he ran_for the state Senate . The 1974 article quoted Garamendi : &quot; To say you are going_to solve crime with the death_penalty , an issue 2 years old , is not realistic . The death_penalty is not an issue . Neither is marijuana . To say these are important issues is naive. &quot; In 1972 , the U.S. Supreme Court declared the death_penalty unconstitutional , wiping_out all pending death sentences . Garamendi voted to reinstate the death_penalty when the issue came_up in the Senate in 1977 and , after then-Gov . Edmund G . ( Jerry ) Brown Jr . -- Kathleen Brown ' s brother -- vetoed the bill , Garamendi voted to override the legislation , Sragow said . Sragow said all_the reports stem from an erroneous reading of the 1974 Stockton Record article . To support their position , Brown campaign officials urged reporters to contact state Sen . Patrick Johnston ( D-Stockton ) , who managed Garamendi ' s 1974 Assembly race , and Doug Watts , who ran the campaign of the GOP candidate . Johnston , who has been_on less than friendly terms with Garamendi recently , said in a telephone_interview that he could not recall Garamendi &quot; speaking in opposition , or in support of the death penalty. &quot; Watts , reached in New York City , said that &quot; Garamendi was clearly against the death_penalty . . . . Clearly one of our big issues that he never refuted at the time was that he was opposed to the death_penalty . It was pretty classic bleeding-heart stuff for those days. &quot; Brown campaign officials said Garamendi also flip-flopped by saying the death_penalty is needed to solve today ' s crime problems . They quoted a 1989 Garamendi statement made in response to a proposal by then-Gov . George Deukmejian to extend the death_penalty to those who commit first-degree murder during drug-related crimes : &quot; Does anybody for a minute believe the death_penalty or a longer sentence is going_to solve the problem ? &quot; Brown has said that one reason for her personal opposition to the death_penalty is that she does not believe it deters violent crime .</TEXT>
