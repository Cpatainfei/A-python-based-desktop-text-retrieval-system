   <HEADLINE> BUILDING A NETWORK FOR BLACK LEADERSHIP ; POLITICS : THE ANNUAL MEETING OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS PUTS THE PROBLEMS AND PROGRESS OF AFRICAN AMERICANS IN CENTER STAGE -- FOR A WEEK , ANYWAY .</HEADLINE>
   <TEXT> The Congressional Black Caucus ' 24th Annual Legislative Conference is ground zero of black political meetings . From its epicenter in the serpentine lobby of the Washington Convention Center to its informal outposts in nearby hotel suites and cocktail_lounges , the luminaries of black political life sparkle with the prestige that comes_to those holding an elected or appointed position in the federal_government . But to appreciate the glitz of this gathering , you must first understand something : For 51 weeks a year , few people beyond the limited and isolated world of inside-the-Washington-beltway know -- or , so it seems , care -- much about the African-American lawmakers on Capitol_Hill . During this one special week , however , the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation -- a nonprofit educational and policy-making wing of the black lawmakers -- does its darndest to place the caucus at the hub of the political universe . For the 40 black caucus members -- 39 House members ( including the non-voting delegate from the District_of_Columbia , Eleanor Holmes Norton ) and one senator , Carol Mosely Braun of Illinois -- the conference , which ended late Saturday night , is a celebration of their existence . Here are selected sights and sounds of black legislators and their friends at_work and play : * Rep . Kweisi Mfume ( D-Md. ) glides past the bank of television_cameras and the crush of well-wishers . He is late . The introductions of his colleagues seated on the riser are done as Mfume ascends to the head table . He prepares himself to deliver his 1994 Legislative State of Black America address , to officially open the five-day conference . Mfume , chairman of the black caucus , is the most charismatic icon of the week and , perhaps , its most influential . His term ends in two months when the current legislative session closes . This speech -- with its references and quotations from President Abraham_Lincoln , the Rev . Martin_Luther_King Jr . and the Hon . Elijah Muhammad -- is his valedictory_address . &quot; Unlike many in this room , &quot; he says , his almond-shaped eyes narrowing into slits , &quot; I came_out of a disjointed family structure . I grew_up in the worst possible conditions : I became homeless after my mother ' s death , hit the streets and dropped_out of school , flirted_with every temptation that was around , became a teen parent before my time , felt left_out and victimized. &quot; Life turned_around &quot; because of a blessing . . . ( I ) found myself , &quot; he says . And the challenge of the black caucus is to live_up_to its conference theme -- &quot; Embracing Our Youth for a New Tomorrow &quot; -- to reform political institutions so other young black people may live_by his example . Mfume adds that his tenure as leader of the black caucus was bittersweet . &quot; Many Americans see the black caucus as this wide-eyed , crazy , pinko-Communist , liberal , twisted group that can ' t think for itself , that ' s out of step with everybody , everything and has nothing better to do except to stand_up and to put forth and to advance positions. &quot; The fact of the_matter : &quot; We exist because we have no choice , &quot; Mfume says . &quot; We all would like to believe we could live to see the day there would not be a need for the Congressional Black Caucus . Ladies and gentlemen , that day has not arrived. &quot; * This year ' s conclave is special because the caucus membership is swollen with new-found influence and power -- indeed , black federal lawmakers in the age of Clintonian governance are a growth_industry , enjoying a historic , high-water_mark for black political leadership . In 1970 , when the Congressional Black Caucus was organized , there were 13 members , a record achievement unmatched since Reconstruction . More_than 2 # 700 people attended the first CBC legislative dinner held_in 1971 at the Sheraton-Park Hotel in Washington . Then as now , the affair was showy , causing concern among the organizers and participants that a $ 100-a-plate dinner &quot; signaled a catering to rich corporations and the abandonment of our commitment to the poor , &quot; Rep . William Clay ( D-Mo. ) wrote in &quot; Just Permanent Interests : Black Americans in Congress 1870-1991 , &quot; his semi-autobiographical history of the Caucus . Amelia Parker , CBC executive_director , calculated off the top of her head that 25 # 000 people would participate in conference activities . Allowing_for multiple counting ( assuming everyone does everything every day ) , her figure jibes with an unofficial estimate of 5 # 000 registrants for the week of panel_discussions , receptions and meals . * Busy with other matters , Parker is in no mood to answer questions or sit still for an interview . But when asked about how difficult it would be for people to get tickets to the convention-sponsored events , Parker stops in her tracks to set the record straight . From the earliest days down to the present , suggestions of elitism at its annual meetings will extract a rebuttal . &quot; There are 67 events at this convention , all_of them are free and open_to the public except three of our fund-raising events , &quot; she says . &quot; There are brain trusts ( meetings ) and panels on a wide range of issues that are intended to benefit and empower all African Americans , so it would do us a great disservice to only focus_on how hard it is to get tickets to the fund-raisers. &quot; There are , in fact , a wide array of activities , meetings and panel_discussions . Most go unnoticed , Parker says , citing the Wednesday morning breakfast where caucus members served homeless people in a Washington shelter . Her unspoken message is loud and clear : the CBC does more_than party during this week . Those fund-raisers -- two fashion shows , a cocktail reception and a black-tie awards dinner -- do draw the biggest crowds and most media attention , she notes . &quot; But those events are the only way we can raise money for scholarships for young people , &quot; Parker says . &quot; They pay_for the educational and public policy activities of the caucus . It is most unfair to suggest that this is just about expensive partying when 99 % of what happens is free. &quot; * Overheard in a corridor : &quot; I guess they think we ' re the X-generation because of our Malcolm X caps. &quot; There are young people everywhere . Fraternity-boy types in power suits and kente-cloth neckties . High-school-aged girls jotting notes furiously on lined paper . Freshly minted professionals whispering into cellular_telephones . It is early morning and a spotlighted event is about to take_place . Since Bill_Clinton rode to the White_House on town_hall meetings aimed at young folks , it seems everybody is trying to corner that market with the same approach . CBC-style , it is a celebrity-attended discussion titled on &quot; Generation X : Black Voices of Reason , Rage and Responsibility. &quot; Keeping faith with the convention theme and seeking to break perceptions held by many young blacks of Establishment leaders as out-of-touch old fogies , this convention struck a hip vogue . In addition to the Generation X town_hall , there was a mentor lunch for 200 Washington-area high_school students , a mock Congress where students from across the nation drafted and passed laws as though they were U.S. Representatives and workshops on issues such_as hip-hop culture . * No one dared arrive here without those ubiquitous 3-inch-by-2-inch slips_of_paper embossed with their name , title , phone_number and , increasingly , e-mail address . Dealing business_cards with one hand and raising a cocktail glass with the other is a skill conventioneers master early . Ask DeNatalie Phillips , vice_president for public relations at Atlanta-based World African Network , a 2-year-old firm that programs news about the African continent to U.S. cable providers . She draws business_cards from her pocket faster than Billy the Kid unholstered his six-shooter . Standing on line waiting to enter a ballroom where Vice_President Gore spoke at a Democratic National Committee luncheon for the black lawmakers , Phillips shuffles cards to a variety of congressional aides , reporters , business_executives and politicians . &quot; If we had endless pockets , we would spend a lot of money on advertising , &quot; she says . &quot; But we have to make the most of our limited resources . Hence , we come here to meet with key decision_makers in African-American community . We ' re trying to maximize opportunities to meet with people who influence other African-American people . &quot; Here , &quot; she says , &quot; take my card. &quot;</TEXT>
